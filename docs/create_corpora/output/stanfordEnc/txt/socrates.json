All our information about him is second-hand and most of it\nvigorously disputed, but his trial and death at the hands of the\nAthenian democracy is nevertheless the founding myth of the academic\ndiscipline of philosophy, and his influence has been felt far beyond\nphilosophy itself, and in every age. Because his life is widely\nconsidered paradigmatic not only for the philosophic life but, more\ngenerally, for how anyone ought to live, Socrates has been encumbered\nwith the adulation and emulation normally reserved for religious\nfigures – strange for someone who tried so hard to make others\ndo their own thinking and for someone convicted and executed on the\ncharge of irreverence toward the gods.  Certainly he was impressive,\nso impressive that many others were moved to write about him, all of\nwhom found him strange by the conventions of fifth-century Athens: in\nhis appearance, personality, and behavior, as well as in his views and\nmethods.  \n\n\n\nSo thorny is the difficulty of distinguishing the historical Socrates\nfrom the Socrateses of the authors of the texts in which he appears\nand, moreover, from the Socrateses of scores of later interpreters,\nthat the whole contested issue is generally referred to as the\nSocratic problem. Each age, each intellectual turn, produces a\nSocrates of its own. It is no less true now that, “The\n‘real’ Socrates we have not: what we have is a set of\ninterpretations each of which represents a ‘theoretically\npossible’ Socrates,” as Cornelia de Vogel (1955, 28) put\nit. In fact, de Vogel was writing as a new analytic paradigm for\ninterpreting Socrates was about to become standard—Gregory\nVlastos’s model (§2.2), which would hold sway until the mid\n1990s. Who Socrates really was is fundamental to virtually any \ninterpretation of the philosophical dialogues of Plato because Socrates is the dominant figure\nin most of Plato’s dialogues.\n\n\n\nStandards of beauty are different in different eras, and in\nSocrates’s time beauty could easily be measured by the standard of the\ngods, stately, proportionate sculptures of whom had been adorning the\nAthenian acropolis since about the time Socrates reached the age of\nthirty. Good looks and proper bearing were important to a man’s\npolitical prospects, for beauty and goodness were linked in the popular\nimagination. The extant sources agree that Socrates was profoundly\nugly, resembling a satyr more than a man—and resembling not at all\nthe statues that turned up later in ancient times and now grace\nInternet sites and the covers of books. He had wide-set, bulging eyes\nthat darted sideways and enabled him, like a crab, to see not only what\nwas straight ahead, but what was beside him as well; a flat, upturned\nnose with flaring nostrils; and large fleshy lips like an ass. Socrates let\nhis hair grow long, Spartan-style (even while Athens and Sparta were at\nwar), and went about barefoot and unwashed, carrying a stick and\nlooking arrogant. He didn’t change his clothes but efficiently wore in\nthe daytime what he covered himself with at night. Something was\npeculiar about his gait as well, sometimes described as a swagger so\nintimidating that enemy soldiers kept their distance. He was\nimpervious to the effects of alcohol and cold weather, but this made him an\nobject of suspicion to his fellow soldiers on campaign. We can safely\nassume an average height (since no one mentions it at all), and a\nstrong build, given the active life he appears to have led. Against the\niconic tradition of a pot-belly, Socrates and his companions are\ndescribed as going hungry (Aristophanes, Birds 1280–83). On\nhis appearance, see Plato’s Theaetetus 143e, and\nSymposium 215a–c, 216c–d, 221d–e; Xenophon’s\nSymposium 4.19, 5.5–7; and Aristophanes’s Clouds 362.\nBrancusi’s oak sculpture, standing 51.25 inches including its base,\ncaptures Socrates’s appearance and strangeness in the sense that it\nlooks different from every angle, including a second “eye”\nthat cannot be seen if the first is in view. (See the Museum of Modern Art’s\n page on Brancusi’s Socrates\n which offers additional views.) Also true to Socrates’s reputation for\nugliness, but less available, are the drawings of the contemporary Swiss artist, Hans Erni. \n\nIn the late fifth century B.C.E., it was more or less taken for\ngranted that any self-respecting Athenian male would prefer fame,\nwealth, honors, and political power to a life of labor.  Although many\ncitizens lived by their labor in a wide variety of occupations, they\nwere expected to spend much of their leisure time, if they had any,\nbusying themselves with the affairs of the city. Men regularly\nparticipated in the governing Assembly and in the city’s many courts;\nand those who could afford it prepared themselves for success at\npublic life by studying with rhetoricians and sophists from abroad who\ncould themselves become wealthy and famous by teaching the young men\nof Athens to use words to their advantage. Other forms of higher\neducation were also known in Athens: mathematics, astronomy, geometry,\nmusic, ancient history, and linguistics. One of the things that seemed strange about\nSocrates is that he neither labored to earn a living, nor participated\nvoluntarily in affairs of state. Rather, he embraced poverty and,\nalthough youths of the city kept company with him and imitated him,\nSocrates adamantly insisted he was not a teacher\n(Plato, Apology 33a–b) and refused all his life to take money\nfor what he did. The strangeness of this behavior is mitigated by the\nimage then current of teachers and students: teachers were viewed as\npitchers pouring their contents into the empty cups that were the\nstudents. Because Socrates was no transmitter of information that\nothers were passively to receive, he resists the comparison to\nteachers. Rather, he helped others recognize on their own what is\nreal, true, and good (Plato, Meno,\nTheaetetus)—a new, and thus suspect, approach to\neducation. He was known for confusing, stinging and stunning his\nconversation partners into the unpleasant experience of realizing\ntheir own ignorance, a state sometimes superseded by genuine\nintellectual curiosity. \n\nIt did not help matters that Socrates seemed to have a higher opinion\nof women than most of his companions had, speaking of “men and\nwomen,” “priests and priestesses,” and naming\nforeign women as his teachers: Socrates claimed to have learned\nrhetoric from Aspasia of Miletus, the de facto spouse of Pericles (Plato,\nMenexenus); and to have learned erotics from the priestess\nDiotima of Mantinea (Plato, Symposium). Socrates was\nunconventional in a related respect. Athenian citizen males of the\nupper social classes did not marry until they were at least thirty,\nand Athenian females were poorly educated and kept sequestered until\npuberty, when they were given in marriage by their fathers. Thus the\nsocialization and education of males often involved a relationship for\nwhich the English word ‘pederasty’ (though often used) is\nmisleading, in which a youth approaching manhood, fifteen to\nseventeen, became the beloved of a male lover a few years older, under\nwhose tutelage and through whose influence and gifts, the younger man\nwould be guided and improved. It was assumed among Athenians that\nmature men would find youths sexually attractive, and such\nrelationships were conventionally viewed as beneficial to both parties\nby family and friends alike. A degree of hypocrisy (or denial),\nhowever, was implied by the arrangement: “officially” it\ndid not involve sexual relations between the lovers and, if it did,\nthen the beloved was not supposed to derive pleasure from the\nact—but ancient evidence (comedies, vase\npaintings, et al.) shows that both restrictions were often violated\n(Dover 1989, 204). What was odd about Socrates is that, although he\nwas no exception to the rule of finding youths attractive (Plato,\nCharmides 155d, Protagoras 309a–b; Xenophon,\nSymposium 4.27–28), he refused the physical advances of even\nhis favorite (Plato, Symposium 219b–d) and kept his eye on\nthe improvement of their, and all the Athenians’, souls (Plato,\nApology 30a–b), a mission he said he had been assigned by the\noracle of Apollo at Delphi, if he was interpreting his friend\nChaerephon’s report correctly (Plato, Apology 20e–23b), a\npreposterous claim in the eyes of his fellow citizens. Socrates also\nacknowledged a rather strange personal phenomenon, a\ndaimonion or internal voice that prohibited his doing certain\nthings, some trivial and some important, often unrelated to matters\nof right and wrong (thus not to be confused with the popular notions\nof a superego or a conscience). The implication that he was guided by\nsomething he regarded as divine or semi-divine was all the more reason for other\nAthenians to be suspicious of Socrates. \n\nSocrates was usually to be found in the marketplace and other public\nareas, conversing with a variety of different people—young and\nold, male and female, slave and free, rich and poor—that is,\nwith virtually anyone he could persuade to join with him in his\nquestion-and-answer mode of probing serious matters. Socrates’s\nlifework consisted in the examination of people’s lives, his own and\nothers’, because “the unexamined life is not worth living for a\nhuman being,” as he says at his trial (Plato, Apology\n38a).  Socrates pursued this task single-mindedly, questioning people\nabout what matters most, e.g., courage, love, reverence, moderation,\nand the state of their souls generally. He did this regardless of\nwhether his respondents wanted to be questioned or resisted him.\nAthenian youths imitated Socrates’s questioning style, much to the\nannoyance of some of their elders. He had a reputation for irony,\nthough what that means exactly is controversial; at a minimum,\nSocrates’s irony consisted in his saying that he knew nothing of\nimportance and wanted to listen to others, yet keeping the upper hand\nin every discussion. One further aspect of Socrates’s much-touted\nstrangeness should be mentioned: his dogged failure to align himself\npolitically with oligarchs or democrats; rather, he had friends and\nenemies among both, and he supported and opposed actions of both (see\n§3).   \n\nThe Socratic problem is a rat’s nest of complexities arising from the\nfact that various people wrote about Socrates whose accounts\ndiffer in crucial respects, leaving us to wonder which, if any, are\naccurate representations of the historical Socrates.  “There is,\nand always will be, a ‘Socratic problem’. This is\ninevitable,” said Guthrie (1969, 6), looking back on a gnarled\nhistory between ancient and contemporary times that is narrated in\ndetail by Press (1996), but barely touched on below. The difficulties\nare increased because all those who knew and wrote about Socrates\nlived before any standardization of modern categories of, or\nsensibilities about, what constitutes historical accuracy or poetic\nlicense. All authors present their own interpretations of the\npersonalities and lives of their characters, whether they mean to or\nnot, whether they write fiction or biography or philosophy (if the\nphilosophy they write has characters), so other criteria must be\nintroduced for deciding among the contending views of who Socrates\nreally was. A look at the three primary ancient sources of information\nabout Socrates (§2.1) will provide a foundation for appreciating\nhow contemporary interpretations differ (§2.2) and why the\ndifferences matter (§2.3). \n\nOne thing is certain about the historical Socrates: even among those\nwho knew him in life, there was profound disagreement about what his\nactual views and methods were. Apart from the three primary sources\nbelow, there were those called ‘minor Socratics’, not for\nthe quality of their work but because so little or none of it is\nextant, about whose view of Socrates we shall probably never know\n much.[2]\n After Socrates’s death, the tradition became even more disparate. As\nNehamas (1999, 99) puts it, “with the exception of the\nEpicureans, every philosophical school in antiquity, whatever its\norientation, saw in him either its actual founder or the type of\nperson to whom its adherents were to aspire.” \n Our earliest extant source—and the only one who can claim to\nhave known Socrates in his early years—is the playwright\nAristophanes.  His comedy, Clouds, was produced in 423 when\nthe other two writers of our extant sources, Xenophon and Plato, were infants. In the\nplay, the character Socrates heads a Think-o-Rama in which young men\nstudy the natural world, from insects to stars, and study slick\nargumentative techniques as well, lacking all respect for the Athenian\nsense of propriety. The actor wearing the mask of Socrates makes fun\nof the traditional gods of Athens (lines 247–48, 367, 423–24),\nmimicked later by the young protagonist, and gives naturalistic\nexplanations of phenomena Athenians viewed as divinely directed (lines\n227–33; cf.  Theaetetus 152e, 153c–d, 173e–174a;\nPhaedo 96a–100a).  Worst of all, he teaches dishonest\ntechniques for avoiding repayment of debt (lines 1214–1302) and\nencourages young men to beat their parents into submission (lines\n1408–46). \n\nIn favor of Aristophanes as a source is that Xenophon and Plato were\nsome forty-five years younger than Socrates, so their acquaintance\ncould only have been in Socrates’s later years. One may reasonably\ndoubt that the life and personality of Socrates was so consistent that\nPlato’s characterization of a man in his fifties and sixties should\nutterly undo the lampooning account of the younger Socrates found in\nClouds and other comic poets. More to the point, the years\nbetween Clouds and Socrates’s trial were years of war and\nupheaval, so the Athenian intellectual freedom of which Pericles\nboasted at the beginning of the war (Thucydides 2.37–39) had been\neroded completely by the end (see §3). Thus, what had seemed\ncomical a quarter century earlier, Socrates hanging in a basket\non-stage, talking nonsense, was ominous in memory by then. \n\nComedy by its very nature is a tricky source for information about\nanyone. A good reason to believe that the representation of Socrates\nis not merely comic exaggeration but systematically misleading is that\nClouds amalgamates in one character, Socrates, features now\nwell known to be unique to other particular fifth-century\nintellectuals (Dover 1968, xxxii-lvii). Perhaps Aristophanes chose\nSocrates to represent garden-variety intellectuals because Socrates’s\nphysiognomy was strange enough to be comic by itself. Aristophanes\ngenuinely objected to what he saw as social instability brought on by\nthe freedom Athenian youths enjoyed to study with professional\nrhetoricians, sophists (see §1), and natural philosophers, e.g.,\nthose who, like the presocratics, studied the cosmos or nature. That\nSocrates eschewed any earning potential in philosophy does not seem to\nhave been significant to the great writer of comedies. Aristophanes’s\ndepiction is important because Plato’s Socrates says at his trial\n(Apology 18a–b, 19c) that most of his jurors have grown up\nbelieving the falsehoods spread about him in the play. Socrates calls\nAristophanes more dangerous than the three men who brought charges\nagainst him in 399 because Aristophanes had poisoned the jurors’ minds\nwhile they were young. Aristophanes did not stop accusing Socrates in\n423 when Clouds placed third behind another play in which\nSocrates was mentioned as barefoot; rather, he soon began writing a\nrevision, which he published but never produced. Aristophanes appears\nto have given up on reviving\nClouds in about 416, but his attacks on Socrates\ncontinued. Again in 414 with Birds, and in 405 with\nFrogs, Aristophanes complained of Socrates’s deleterious\neffect on the youths of the city, including Socrates’s neglect of the\n poets.[3] \n Another source for the historical Socrates is the soldier-historian,\nXenophon. Xenophon says explicitly of Socrates, “I was never\nacquainted with anyone who took greater care to find out what each of\nhis companions knew” (Memorabilia 4.7.1); and Plato\ncorroborates Xenophon’s statement by illustrating throughout his\ndialogues Socrates’s adjustment of the level and type of his questions\nto the particular individuals with whom he talked. If it is true that\nSocrates succeeded in pitching his conversation at the right level for\neach of his companions, the striking differences between Xenophon’s\nSocrates and Plato’s is largely explained by the differences between\ntheir two personalities. Xenophon was a practical man whose ability to\nrecognize philosophical issues is almost imperceptible, so it is\nplausible that his Socrates appears as such a practical and helpful\nadvisor because that is the side of Socrates Xenophon witnessed.\nXenophon’s Socrates differs additionally from Plato’s in offering\nadvice about subjects in which Xenophon was himself experienced, but\nSocrates was not: moneymaking (Xenophon, Memorabilia 2.7) and\nestate management (Xenophon, Oeconomicus), suggesting that\nXenophon may have entered into the writing of Socratic discourses (as\nAristotle labeled the genre, Poetics 1447b11) making the\ncharacter Socrates a mouthpiece for his own views. His other works\nmentioning or featuring Socrates are Anabasis,\nApology, Hellenica, and Symposium. \n\nSomething that has strengthened Xenophon’s prima facie claim\nas a source for Socrates’s life is his work as a historian; his\nHellenica (History of Greece) is one of the chief\nsources for the period 411–362, after Thucydides’s history abruptly\nends in the midst of the Peloponnesian wars. Although Xenophon tends\nto moralize and does not follow the superior conventions introduced by\nThucydides, still it is sometimes argued that, having had no\nphilosophical axes to grind, Xenophon may have presented a more\naccurate portrait of Socrates than Plato does. But two considerations\nhave always weakened that claim: (1) The Socrates of Xenophon’s works\nis so pedestrian that it is difficult to imagine his inspiring fifteen\nor more people to write Socratic discourses in the period following\nhis death. (2) Xenophon could not have chalked up many hours with\nSocrates or with reliable informants. He lived in Erchia, about 15\nkilometers and across the Hymettus mountains from Socrates’s haunts in\nthe urban area of Athens, and his love of horses and horsemanship (on\nwhich he wrote a still valuable treatise) seem to have taken up\nconsiderable time. He left Athens in 401 on an expedition to Persia\nand, for a variety of reasons (mercenary service for Thracians and\nSpartans; exile), never resided in Athens again. And now a third is in\norder. (3) It turns out to have been ill-advised to assume that\nXenophon would apply the same criteria for accuracy to his Socratic\ndiscourses as to his\n histories.[4]\n The biographical and historical background Xenophon deploys in his\nmemoirs of Socrates fails to correspond to such additional sources as\nwe have from archaeology, history, the courts, and literature. The\nwidespread use of computers in classical studies, enabling the\ncomparison of ancient persons, and the compiling of information about\neach of them from disparate sources, has made incontrovertible this\nobservation about Xenophon’s Socratic works. Xenophon’s memoirs are\npastiches, several of which simply could not have occurred as\npresented. \n  Philosophers have usually privileged the account of Socrates given by\ntheir fellow philosopher, Plato. Plato was about twenty-five when\nSocrates was tried and executed, and had probably known the old man\nmost of his life. It would have been hard for a boy of Plato’s social\nclass, residing in the political district (deme) of Collytus within\nthe city walls, to avoid Socrates. The extant sources agree that\nSocrates was often to be found where youths of the city spent their\ntime. Further, Plato’s representation of individual Athenians has\nproved over time to correspond remarkably well to both\narchaeological and literary evidence: in his use of names and places,\nfamilial relations and friendship bonds, and even in his rough dating\nof events in almost all the authentic dialogues where Socrates is the\ndominant figure. The dialogues have dramatic dates that fall into\nplace as one learns more about their characters and, despite\nincidental anachronisms, it turns out that there is more realism in the\ndialogues than most have\n suspected.[5]\n The Ion, Lysis, Euthydemus, Meno,\nMenexenus, Theaetetus, Euthyphro, the frame\nof Symposium, Apology, Crito,\nPhaedo (although Plato says he was not himself present at\nSocrates’s execution), and the frame of Parmenides are the\ndialogues in which Plato had greatest access to the Athenians he\ndepicts. \n\nIt does not follow, however, that Plato represented the views and\nmethods of Socrates (or anyone, for that matter) as he recalled them,\nmuch less as they were originally uttered. There are a number of\ncautions and caveats that should be in place from the start. (i) Plato\nmay have shaped the character Socrates (or other characters) to serve\nhis own purposes, whether philosophical or literary or both. (ii) The\ndialogues representing Socrates as a youth and young man took place,\nif they took place at all, before Plato was born and when he was a\nsmall child. (iii) One should be cautious even about the dramatic\ndates of Plato’s dialogues because they are calculated with\nreference to characters whom we know primarily, though not only, from\nthe dialogues. (iv) Exact dates should be treated with a measure of\nskepticism for numerical precision can be misleading. Even when a\nspecific festival or other reference fixes the season or month of a\ndialogue, or birth of a character, one should imagine a margin of\nerror. Although it becomes obnoxious to use circa or\nplus-minus everywhere, the ancients did not require or desire\ncontemporary precision in these matters. All the children born during\na full year, for example, had the same nominal birthday, accounting\nfor the conversation at Lysis 207b, odd by contemporary\nstandards, in which two boys disagree about who is the\nelder. Philosophers have often decided to bypass the historical\nproblems altogether and to assume for the sake of argument that\nPlato’s Socrates is the Socrates who is relevant to potential\nprogress in philosophy. That strategy, as we shall soon see, gives\nrise to a new Socratic problem (§2.2). \n\nWhat, after all, is our motive for reading a dead philosopher’s words\nabout another dead philosopher who never wrote anything himself?  This\nis a way of asking a popular question, Why do history of philosophy?\n—which has no settled answer. One might reply that our study of\nsome of our philosophical predecessors is intrinsically\nvaluable, philosophically enlightening and satisfying. When we\ncontemplate the words of a dead philosopher, a philosopher with whom\nwe cannot engage directly—Plato’s words, say—we seek to\nunderstand not merely what he said and assumed, but what his\npropositions imply, and whether they are true. Sometimes, making such\njudgments requires us to learn the language in which the philosopher\nwrote, more about his predecessors’ ideas and those of his\ncontemporaries. The truly great philosophers, and Plato was one of\nthem, are still capable of becoming our companions in philosophical\nconversation, our dialectical partners.  Because he addressed\ntimeless, universal, fundamental questions with insight and\nintelligence, our own understanding of such questions is\nheightened. That explains Plato, one might say, but where is Socrates\nin this picture? Is he interesting merely as a predecessor to Plato?\nSome would say yes, but others would say it is not Plato’s but\nSocrates’s ideas and methods that mark the real beginning of philosophy\nin the West, that Socrates is the better dialectical guide, and that\nwhat is Socratic in the dialogues should be distinguished from what is\nPlatonic (§2.2). But how? That again is the Socratic\nproblem. \n If it were possible to confine oneself exclusively to Plato’s\nSocrates, the Socratic problem would nevertheless reappear\nbecause one would soon discover Socrates himself defending one\nposition in one Platonic dialogue, its contrary in another, and using\ndifferent methods in different dialogues to boot. Inconsistencies\namong the dialogues seem to demand explanation, though not all\nphilosophers have thought so (Shorey 1903). Most famously, the\nParmenides attacks various theories of forms that the\nRepublic, Symposium, and Phaedo develop and defend. In some\ndialogues (e.g., Laches), Socrates only weeds the garden of\nits inconsistencies and false beliefs, but in other dialogues (e.g.,\nPhaedrus), he is a planter as well, advancing structured\nphilosophical claims and suggesting new methods for testing those\nclaims. There are differences on smaller matters as well. For example,\nSocrates in the Gorgias opposes, while in the\nProtagoras he supports, hedonism; the details of the relation\nbetween erotic love and the good life differ from Phaedrus\nto Symposium; the account of the relation between knowledge\nand the objects of knowledge in Republic differs from the\nMeno account; despite Socrates’s commitment to Athenian law,\nexpressed in the Crito, he vows in the Apology that\nhe will disobey the lawful jury if it orders him to stop\nphilosophizing. A related problem is that some of the dialogues appear\nto develop positions familiar from other philosophical traditions\n(e.g., that of Heraclitus in Theaetetus and Pythagoreanism in\nPhaedo). Three centuries of efforts to solve the Socratic\nproblem are summarized in the following supplementary document: \n Contemporary efforts recycle bits and pieces—including the\nfailures—of these older attempts. \n  Until relatively recently in modern times, it was hoped that\nconfident elimination of what could be ascribed purely to Socrates\nwould leave standing a coherent set of doctrines attributable to Plato\n(who appears nowhere in the dialogues as a speaker). Many\nphilosophers, inspired by the nineteenth century scholar Eduard\nZeller, expect the greatest philosophers to promote grand,\nimpenetrable schemes. Nothing of the sort was possible for Socrates,\nso it remained for Plato to be assigned all the positive\ndoctrines that could be extracted from the dialogues. In the latter\nhalf of the twentieth century, however, there was a resurgence of\ninterest in who Socrates was and what his own views and\nmethods were. The result is a narrower, but no less contentious,\nSocratic problem. Two strands of interpretation dominated views of\nSocrates in the twentieth century (Griswold 2001; Klagge and Smith\n1992). Although there has been some healthy cross-pollination and\ngrowth since the mid 1990s, the two were so hostile to one another for\nso long that the bulk of the secondary literature on Socrates,\nincluding translations peculiar to each, still divides into two camps,\nhardly reading one another: literary contextualists and analysts. The\nliterary-contextual study of Socrates, like hermeneutics more\ngenerally, uses the tools of literary criticism—typically\ninterpreting one complete dialogue at a time; its European origins are\ntraced to Heidegger and earlier to Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. The analytic study of\nSocrates, like analytic philosophy more generally, is fueled by the\narguments in the texts—typically addressing a single argument or\nset of arguments, whether in a single text or across texts; its\norigins are in the Anglo-American philosophical tradition. Hans-Georg\nGadamer (1900–2002) was the doyen of the hermeneutic strand, and\nGregory Vlastos (1907–1991) of the analytic. \n  Faced with inconsistencies in Socrates’s views and methods from one\ndialogue to another, the literary contextualist has no Socratic\nproblem because Plato is seen as an artist of surpassing literary\nskill, the ambiguities in whose dialogues are intentional\nrepresentations of actual ambiguities in the subjects philosophy\ninvestigates. Thus terms, arguments, characters, and in fact all\nelements in the dialogues should be addressed in their literary\ncontext. Bringing the tools of literary criticism to the study of the\ndialogues, and sanctioned in that practice by Plato’s own use of\nliterary devices and practice of textual critique (Protagoras\n339a–347a, Republic 2.376c–3.412b, Ion, and\nPhaedrus 262c–264e), most contextualists ask of each\ndialogue what its aesthetic unity implies, pointing out that the\ndialogues themselves are autonomous, containing almost no\ncross-references. Contextualists who attend to what they see as the\naesthetic unity of the whole Platonic corpus, and therefore seek a\nconsistent picture of Socrates, advise close readings of the dialogues\nand appeal to a number of literary conventions and devices said to\nreveal Socrates’s actual personality. For both varieties of\ncontextualism, the Platonic dialogues are like a brilliant\nconstellation whose separate stars naturally require separate\nfocus. \n\nMarking the maturity of the literary contextualist tradition in the\nearly twenty-first century is a greater diversity of approaches and an\nattempt to be more internally critical (see Hyland 2004). \n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Vlastos (1991, 45–80) recommended a set of\nmutually supportive premises that together provide a plausible\nframework in the analytic tradition for Socratic philosophy as a\npursuit distinct from Platonic philosophy. Although the premises have\ndeep roots in early attempts to solve the Socratic problem (see the\nsupplementary document linked above), the beauty of Vlastos’s\nparticular configuration is its fecundity. The first premise marks a\nbreak with a tradition of regarding Plato as a dialectician who held\nhis assumptions tentatively and revised them constantly; rather, \n\naccounting for many of the inconsistencies and contradictions among\nthe dialogues (persistent inconsistencies are addressed with a complex\nnotion of Socratic irony.) In particular, Vlastos tells a story\n“as hypothesis, not dogma or reported fact” describing the\nyoung Plato in vivid terms, writing his early dialogues while\nconvinced of “the substantial truth of Socrates’s teaching and\nthe soundness of its method.” Later, Plato develops into a\nconstructive philosopher in his own right but feels no need to break\nthe bond with his Socrates, his “father image.” (The\nremainder of Plato’s story is not relevant to Socrates.) Vlastos\nlabels a small group of dialogues ‘transitional’ to mark\nthe period when Plato was beginning to be dissatisfied with Socrates’s\nviews. Vlastos’s third premise is \n\nThe evidence Vlastos uses varies for this claim, but is of several\ntypes: stylometric data, internal cross references, external events\nmentioned, differences in doctrines and methods featured, and other\nancient testimony (particularly that of Aristotle). The dialogues of\nPlato’s Socratic period, called “elenctic dialogues” for\nSocrates’s preferred method of questioning, are Apology, Charmides,\nCrito, Euthyphro, Gorgias, Hippias Minor, Ion, Laches, Protagoras,\nand book 1 of the Republic. The developmentalists’ Platonic\ndialogues are potentially a discrete sequence, the order of which\nenables the analyst to separate Socrates from Plato on the basis of\ndifferent periods in Plato’s intellectual evolution. Finally,\n \n\n“As Plato changes, the philosophical persona of his Socrates is\nmade to change” (Vlastos 1991, 53)—a view sometimes\nreferred to as the “mouthpiece theory.” Because the\nanalyst is interested in positions or doctrines (particularly as conclusions from,\nor tested by, arguments), the focus of analysis is usually on a\nparticular philosophical view in or across dialogues, with no\nspecial attention given to context or to dialogues considered as\nwholes; and evidence from dialogues in close chronological proximity\nis likely to be considered more strongly confirming than that from\ndialogues of other developmental periods. The result of applying the\npremises is a firm list (contested, of course, by others) of ten\ntheses held by Socrates, all of which are incompatible with the\ncorresponding ten theses held by Plato (1991, 47–49). \n\nMany analytic ancient philosophers in the late twentieth century mined\nthe gold Vlastos had uncovered, and many of those who were productive\nin the developmentalist vein in the early days went on to constructive\nwork of their own (see Bibliography). \n\nIt is a risky business to say where ancient philosophy is now, but an\nadvantage of an entry in a dynamic reference work is that authors are\nallowed, nay, encouraged to update their entries to reflect\nrecent scholarship and sea changes in their topics.  For many analytic\nphilosophers, John Cooper (1997, xiv) sounded the end of the\ndevelopmentalist era when he described the early- and middle-period\ndialogue distinctions as “an unsuitable basis for bringing\nanyone to the reading of these works. To use them in that way is to\nannounce in advance the results of a certain interpretation of the\ndialogues and to canonize that interpretation under the guise of a\npresumably objective order of composition—when in fact no such\norder is objectively known. And it thereby risks prejudicing\nan unwary reader against the fresh, individual reading that these\nworks demand.” When he added, “it is better to relegate\nthoughts about chronology to the secondary position they deserve and\nto concentrate on the literary and philosophical content of the works,\ntaken on their own and in relation to the others,” he proposed\npeace between the literary contextualist and analytic developmentalist\ncamps. As in any peace agreement, it takes some time for all the\ncombatants to accept that the conflict has ended—but that is\nwhere we are. \n\nIn short, one is now more free to answer, Who was Socrates really?\nin the variety of ways that it has been answered in the past, in one’s\nown well-reasoned way, or to sidestep the question, philosophizing\nabout the issues in Plato’s dialogues without worrying too much about\nthe long toes of any particular interpretive tradition. Those seeking\nthe views and methods of Plato’s Socrates from the perspective of what\none is likely to see attributed to him in the secondary literature\n(§2.2) will find it useful to consult the related entry on\n Plato’s shorter ethical works. \n\nThe larger column on the left below provides some of the biographical\ninformation from ancient sources with the dramatic dates of\nPlato’s dialogues interspersed [in boldface]\nthroughout. In the smaller column on the right are dates of major\nevents and persons familiar from fifth century Athenian history.\nAlthough the dates are as precise as allowed by the facts, some are\nestimated and controversial (Nails 2002). \n Socrates’s tribe was Antiochis, and his deme was Alopece\n(south-southeast of the city wall). Assuming that his stoneworker father,\nSophroniscus, kept to the conventions, he carried the infant around the\nhearth, thereby formally admitting him into the family, five days after\nhe was born, named him on the tenth day, presented him to his\nphratry (a regional hereditary association) and took\nresponsibility for socializing him into the various institutions proper\nto an Athenian male. Literacy had become widespread among males since\nabout 520, and there were a number of elementary schools teaching boys\nto read and write, along with the traditional gymnastics and music, by\nthe 480s (Harris 1989, 55), so we can be confident that Socrates\nreceived a formal education and that Plato was not exaggerating when he\ndescribed the young Socrates as eagerly acquiring the philosopher\nAnaxagoras’s books (scrolls, to be more precise, Phaedo\n98b). \n Athens was a city of numerous festivals, competitions, and\ncelebrations, including the Panathenaea which attracted visitors to the\ncity from throughout the Mediterranean. Like the Olympics, the\nPanathenaea was celebrated with special splendor at four-year\nintervals. [450 Parmenides] Plato depicts the\nnineteen-year-old Socrates in conversation with the great visiting\nphilosophers from Elea, Parmenides and Zeno, at one of the Greater\nPanathenaea festivals, in late July or early August of 450. \n\nThis brings us to the spring and summer of 399, to Socrates’s trial\nand execution. Twice in Plato’s dialogues (Symposium 173b,\nTheaetetus 142c–143a), fact-checking with Socrates took place\nas his friends sought to commit his conversations to writing before he\nwas executed. [spring 399 Theaetetus] Prior to the\naction in the Theaetetus, a young poet named Meletus had\ncomposed a document charging Socrates with the capital crime of\nirreverence (asebeia): failure to show due piety toward the\ngods of Athens. This he delivered to Socrates in the presence of\nwitnesses, instructing Socrates to present himself before the king\narchon within four days for a preliminary hearing (the same magistrate\nwould later preside at the pre-trial examination and the trial). At\nthe end of the\nTheaetetus, Socrates was on his way to that preliminary\nhearing. As a citizen, he had the right to countersue, the right to\nforgo the hearing, allowing the suit to proceed uncontested, and the\nright to exile himself voluntarily, as the personified laws later\nremind him (Crito 52c).  Socrates availed himself of none of\nthese rights of citizenship. Rather, he set out to enter a plea and\nstopped at a gymnasium to talk to some youngsters about mathematics\nand knowledge. \n\nWhen he arrived at the king archon’s stoa, Socrates fell into a\nconversation about reverence with a diviner he knew, Euthyphro\n[399 Euthyphro], and afterwards answered\nMeletus’s charge. This preliminary hearing designated the official\nreceipt of the case and was intended to lead to greater precision in\nthe formulation of the charge. In Athens, religion was a matter of\npublic participation under law, regulated by a calendar of religious\nfestivals; and the city used revenues to maintain temples and shrines.\nSocrates’s irreverence, Meletus claimed, had resulted in the corruption\nof the city’s young men (Euthyphro 3c–d). Evidence for\nirreverence was of two types: Socrates did not believe in the gods of\nthe Athenians (indeed, he had said on many occasions that the gods do\nnot lie or do other wicked things, whereas the Olympian gods of the\npoets and the city were quarrelsome and vindictive); Socrates\nintroduced new divinities (indeed, he insisted that his\ndaimonion had spoken to him since childhood). Meletus handed\nover his complaint, and Socrates entered his plea. The king-archon\ncould refuse Meletus’s case on procedural grounds, redirect the\ncomplaint to an arbitrator, or accept it; he accepted it. Socrates had\nthe right to challenge the admissibility of the accusation in relation\nto existing law, but he did not, so the charge was published on\nwhitened tablets in the agora and a date was set for the pre-trial\nexamination. From this point, word spread rapidly, probably accounting\nfor the spike of interest in Socratic conversations recorded\n(Symposium 172a–173b). [399 Symposium\nframe] But Socrates nevertheless is shown by Plato spending\nthe next day in two very long conversations promised\nin Theaetetus (210d).\n[399 Sophist, Statesman] \n\nAt the pre-trial examination, Meletus paid no court fees because it\nwas considered a matter of public interest to prosecute irreverence. To\ndiscourage frivolous suits, however, Athenian law imposed a heavy fine\non plaintiffs who failed to obtain at least one fifth of the jury’s\nvotes, as Socrates later points out (Apology 36a–b). Unlike closely\ntimed jury trials, pre-trial examinations encouraged questions to and\nby the litigants, to make the legal issues more precise. This\nprocedure had become essential because of the susceptibility of juries\nto bribery and misrepresentation. Originally intended to be a\nmicrocosm of the citizen body, juries by Socrates’s time were manned by\nelderly, disabled, and impoverished volunteers who needed the meager\nthree-obol pay. \n\nIn the month of Thargelion [May-June 399 Apology] a\nmonth or two after Meletus’s initial summons, Socrates’s trial occurred.\nOn the day before, the Athenians had launched a ship to Delos,\ndedicated to Apollo and commemorating Theseus’s legendary victory over\nthe Minotaur (Phaedo 58a–b). Spectators gathered along with\nthe jury (Apology 25a) for a trial that probably lasted most\nof the day, each side timed by the water clock. Plato does not provide\nMeletus’s prosecutorial speech or those of Anytus and Lycon, who had\njoined in the suit; or the names of witnesses, if any\n(Apology 34a implies Meletus called\nnone). Apology—the Greek\n‘apologia’ means ‘defense’—is\nnot edited as are the court speeches of orators. For example, there\nare no indications in the Greek text (at 35d and 38b) that the two\nvotes were taken; and there are no breaks (at 21a or 34b) for\nwitnesses who may have been called. Also missing are speeches by\nSocrates’s supporters; it is improbable that he had none, even though\nPlato does not name them. \n\nSocrates, in his defense, mentioned the harm done to him by\nAristophanes’s Clouds (§2.1). Though Socrates denied\noutright that he studied the heavens and what is below the earth, his\nfamiliarity with the investigations of natural philosophers and his\nown naturalistic explanations make it no surprise that the jury\nremained unpersuaded. And, seeing Socrates out-argue Meletus, the jury\nprobably did not make fine distinctions between philosophy and\nsophistry.  Socrates three times took up the charge that he corrupted\nthe young, insisting that, if he corrupted them, he did so\nunwillingly; but if unwillingly, he should be instructed, not\nprosecuted (Apology 25e–26a). The jury found him guilty. By\nhis own argument, however, Socrates could not blame the jury, for it\nwas mistaken about what was truly in the interest of the city\n(cf. Theaetetus 177d–e) and thus required instruction. \n\nIn the penalty phase of the trial, Socrates said, “If it were\nthe law with us, as it is elsewhere, that a trial for life should not\nlast one but many days, you would be convinced, but now it is not easy\nto dispel great slanders in a short time” (Apology\n37a–b).  This isolated complaint stands opposed to the remark of the\npersonified laws that Socrates was “wronged not by us, the laws,\nbut by men” (Crito 54c). It had been a crime since\n403/2 for anyone even to propose a law or decree in conflict with the\nnewly inscribed laws, so it was ironic for the laws to tell Socrates\nto persuade or obey them (Crito 51b–c). In a last-minute\ncapitulation to his friends, he offered to allow them to pay a fine of\nsix times his net worth (Xenophon Oeconomicus 2.3.4–5),\nthirty minae. The jury rejected the proposal. Perhaps the\njury was too incensed by Socrates’s words to vote for the lesser\npenalty; after all, he needed to tell them more than once to stop\ninterrupting him. It is more likely, however, that superstitious\njurors were afraid that the gods would be angry if they failed to\nexecute a man found guilty of irreverence. Sentenced to death,\nSocrates reflected that it might be a blessing: either a dreamless\nsleep, or an opportunity to converse in the underworld. \n\nWhile the sacred ship was on its journey to Delos, no executions were\nallowed in the city. Although the duration of the annual voyage varied\nwith conditions, Xenophon says it took thirty-one days in 399\n(Memorabilia 4.8.2); if so, Socrates lived thirty days beyond\nhis trial, into the month of Skirophorion. A day or two before the\nend, Socrates’s childhood friend Crito tried to persuade Socrates to\nescape.  [June–July 399 Crito] Socrates\nreplied that he “listens to nothing … but the argument that\non reflection seems best” and that “neither to do wrong or\nto return a wrong is ever right, not even to injure in return for an\ninjury received” (Crito 46b, 49d), not even under threat\nof death (cf. Apology 32a), not even for one’s family\n(Crito 54b). Socrates could not point to a harm that would\noutweigh the harm he would be inflicting on the city if he now exiled\nhimself unlawfully when he could earlier have done so lawfully\n(Crito 52c); such lawbreaking would have confirmed the\njury’s judgment that he was a corrupter of the young (Crito\n53b–c) and brought shame on his family and friends. \n\nThe events of Socrates’s last day, when he “appeared happy both\nin manner and words as he died nobly and without fear”\n(Phaedo 58e) were related by Phaedo to the Pythagorean\ncommunity at Phlius some weeks or months after the execution.\n[June–July 399 Phaedo] The Eleven, prison\nofficials chosen by lot, met with Socrates at dawn to tell him what to\nexpect (Phaedo 59e–60b). When Socrates’s friends arrived,\nXanthippe and their youngest child, Menexenus, were still with him.\nXanthippe commiserated with Socrates that he was about to enjoy his\nlast conversation with his companions; then, in the ritual lamentation\nexpected of women, was led home. Socrates spent the day in\nphilosophical conversation, defending the soul’s immortality and\nwarning his companions not to restrain themselves in argument,\n“If you take my advice, you will give but little thought to\nSocrates but much more to the truth. If you think that what I say is\ntrue, agree with me; if not, oppose it with every argument”\n(Phaedo 91b–c). On the other hand, he warned them sternly to\nrestrain their emotions, “keep quiet and control\nyourselves” (Phaedo 117e). \n\nSocrates had no interest in whether his corpse was burned or buried,\nbut he bathed at the prison’s cistern so the women of his household\nwould be spared from having to wash his corpse. After meeting with his\nfamily again in the late afternoon, he rejoined his companions. The\nservant of the Eleven, a public slave, bade Socrates farewell by\ncalling him “the noblest, the gentlest, and the best” of men\n(Phaedo 116c). The poisoner described the physical effects of\nthe Conium maculatum variety of hemlock used for citizen\nexecutions (Bloch 2001), then Socrates cheerfully took the cup and\ndrank. Phaedo, a former slave echoing the slave of the Eleven, called\nSocrates, “the best, … the wisest and the most upright”\n(Phaedo 118a). \n\nOnce one has begun to read about Socrates in Plato’s dialogues, one\nbegins to realize that the old philosopher is an icon of popular\nculture who has inspired diverse associations and whose name has been\nappropriated for all manner of different purposes: Socrates is a crater\non Earth’s moon; Socrates is a barefoot rag doll made by the Unemployed\nPhilosophers Guild; Socrates is a European Union education and training\nprogram; Socrates is the fifth movement of Leonard Bernstein’s Serenade\nfor Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp, and Percussion, after Plato’s\nSymposium; Socrates is a sculpture park in New York City; and\neSocrates is a business enterprise. Allusions to Socrates abound in\nliterature, history, and political tracts, and he has been a subject\nfor artists since ancient times. Among the more famous paintings are\nRaphael’s\n “School of Athens”\n at the Vatican and David’s\n “Death of Socrates”\n at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Socrates’s influence was\nparticularly notable among the U.S. founders, as the following short\ncollection of quotations demonstrates: \nHad every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly\nwould still have been a mob.—James Madison, Federalist\nNo. 55 \n On July 6, 1756, during the French and Indian War, Washington chose\n‘Xanthippe’, the name of Socrates’s wife, for the\ncountersign at Fort Cumberland.—Carl J. Richard, The\nFounders and the Classics \n When, therefore Plato puts into his [Socrates’s] mouth such\nparalogisms, such quibbles on words, and sophisms as a schoolboy would\nbe ashamed of, we conclude they were the whimsies of Plato’s own foggy\nbrain and acquit Socrates of puerilities so unlike his\ncharacter.—Thomas Jefferson, Letter to William Short \n Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.—Benjamin Franklin,\nAutobiography \n I found this [Socratic] method the safest for myself and very\nembarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore, I took\ndelight in it, practiced it continually, and grew very artful and\nexpert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions\nthe consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in\ndifficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so\nobtaining victory that neither myself nor my causes always\ndeserved.—Benjamin Franklin, Papers \n Like Benjamin Franklin, the English romantic era poets were taken\nwith Socrates as a model for moral behavior and pressed the comparison\nwith Jesus. Percy Bysshe Shelley, who refers to Socrates as “the\nJesus Christ of Greece” (line 33, fragments of\n“Epipsychidion”), wrote a splendid translation of Plato’s\nSymposium (O’Conner 2002); and John Keats wrote in 1818,\n“I have no doubt that thousands of people never heard of have\nhad hearts completely disinterested: I can remember but\ntwo—Socrates and Jesus.” George Gordon, Lord Byron, gives\nthe ghost of Socrates a walk-on part in his play, The Deformed\nTransformed where two characters disagree over what is\nsignificant about Socrates: \n Arnold:\n \n     What! that low, swarthy, short-nosed,\nround-eyed satyr,\n \n \n     With the wide nostrils and Silenus’ aspect,\n\n \n     The splay feet and low stature! I had better\n\n \n     Remain that which I am. \n Stranger:\n \n           \n         And yet he was\n\n \n     The earth’s perfection of all mental beauty,\n\n \n     And personification of all virtue. \n\nIn contemporary political life, and internationally, Socrates is\ninvoked for widely variant purposes. In his 1963 “Letter from\nBirmingham Jail,” Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote, “To a\ndegree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced\ncivil disobedience.” The South African statesman, Nelson\nMandela, eleven of whose twenty-seven prison years were spent at hard\nlabor in rock quarries, describes the efforts of the prisoners to\neducate themselves by forming study groups in the quarries. “The\nstyle of teaching was Socratic in nature,” he says (Long\nWalk to Freedom), with questions posed by leaders to their study\ngroups. Equally contemporary, but contemptuous of Socrates, is the\nintroduction of the\n Al Qaeda Training Manual\n (Department of Justice translation, ellipses in original): \n The confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes\ndoes not know Socratic debates …, Platonic ideals …, nor\nAristotelian diplomacy. But it knows the dialogue of bullets, the\nideals of assassination, bombing, and destruction, and the diplomacy\nof the cannon and machine-gun. \n\nPhilosophers and students of philosophy with a desire to see how\nSocrates is viewed outside the discipline might wish to consult the\nfollowing supplementary document:\n","contact.mail":"nails@msu.edu","contact.domain":"msu.edu"}]
