This sense is typically set apart by the notion\nof basic desert and is defined in terms of the control in\naction needed for an agent to be truly deserving of blame and\npraise. Some moral responsibility skeptics wholly reject this notion\nof moral responsibility because they believe it to be incoherent or\nimpossible. Others maintain that, though possible, our best\nphilosophical and scientific theories about the world provide strong\nand compelling reasons for adopting skepticism about moral\nresponsibility. What all varieties of moral responsibility skepticism\nshare, however, is the belief that the justification needed to ground\nbasic desert moral responsibility and the practices associated with\nit—such as backward-looking praise and blame, punishment and\nreward (including retributive punishment), and the reactive attitudes\nof resentment and indignation—is not met. Versions of moral\nresponsibility skepticism have historically been defended by Spinoza,\nVoltaire, Diderot, d’Holbach, Priestley, Schopenhauer,\nNietzsche, Clarence Darrow, B.F. Skinner, and Paul Edwards, and more\nrecently by Galen Strawson, Derk Pereboom, Bruce Waller, Neil Levy,\nTamler Sommers, and Gregg D. Caruso. \n\n\nCritics of these views tend to focus both on the arguments for\nskepticism about moral responsibility and on the implications\nof such views. They worry that adopting such a view would have dire\nconsequences for our interpersonal relationships, society, morality,\nmeaning, and the law. They fear, for instance, that relinquishing\nbelief in moral responsibility would undermine morality, leave us\nunable to adequately deal with criminal behavior, increase anti-social\nconduct, and destroy meaning in life. Optimistic skeptics,\nhowever, respond by arguing that life without free will and basic\ndesert moral responsibility would not be as destructive as many people\nbelieve. These optimistic skeptics argue that prospects of finding\nmeaning in life or of sustaining good interpersonal relationships, for\ninstance, would not be threatened. They further maintain that morality\nand moral judgments would remain intact. And although retributivism\nand severe punishment, such as the death penalty, would be ruled out,\nthey argue that the imposition of sanctions could serve purposes other\nthan the punishment of the guilty—e.g., it can also be justified\nby its role in incapacitating, rehabilitating, and deterring\noffenders.\n\n\nTo begin, it is important to first get clear on what type of moral\nresponsibility is being doubted or denied by skeptics. Most moral\nresponsibility skeptics maintain that our best philosophical and\nscientific theories about the world indicate that what we do and the\nway we are is ultimately the result of factors beyond our control,\nwhether that be determinism, chance, or luck, and because of this\nagents are never morally responsible in the sense needed to justify\ncertain kinds of desert-based judgments, attitudes, or\ntreatments—such as resentment, indignation, moral anger,\nbackward-looking blame, and retributive punishment. This is not to say\nthat there are not other conceptions of responsibility that can be\nreconciled with determinism, chance, or luck. Nor is it to deny that\nthere may be good reasons to maintain certain systems of punishment\nand reward. Rather, it is to insist that to hold people truly\ndeserving of blame and praise, punishment and reward, would be to\nhold them responsible for the results of the morally arbitrary or for\nwhat is ultimately beyond their control, which is fundamentally unfair\nand unjust. Other skeptics defend the more moderate claim that in any\nparticular case in which we may be tempted to judge that an agent is\nmorally responsible in the desert-based sense, we lack the\nepistemic warrant to do so (e.g., Rosen 2004).  \nDerk Pereboom provides a very helpful definition of the kind of moral\nresponsibility being doubted by skeptics, which he calls basic\ndesert moral responsibility and defines as follows: \nFor an agent to be morally responsible for an action in this sense is\nfor it to be hers in such a way that she would deserve to be blamed if\nshe understood that it was morally wrong, and she would deserve to be\npraised if she understood that it was morally exemplary. The desert at\nissue here is basic in the sense that the agent would deserve to be\nblamed or praised just because she has performed the action, given an\nunderstanding of its moral status, and not, for example, merely by\nvirtue of consequentialist or contractualist considerations. (2014a:\n2) \nConsistent with this definition, other moral responsibility skeptics\nhave suggested that we understand basic desert moral responsibility in\nterms of whether it would ever be appropriate for a hypothetical\ndivine all-knowing judge (who didn’t necessarily create the\nagents in question) to administer differing kinds of treatment (i.e.,\ngreater or lesser rewards or punishments) to human agents on the basis\nof actions that these agents performed during their lifetime (see\nCaruso & Morris 2017; cf. G. Strawson 1986, 1994). The purpose of\ninvoking the notion of a divine judge in the afterlife is to instill\nthe idea that any rewards or punishments issued after death will have\nno further utility—be it positive or negative. Any differences\nin treatment to agents (however slight) would therefore seem warranted\nonly from a basic desert sense, and not a consequentialist\nperspective. \nMost moral responsibility skeptics distinguish between\nconsequentialist-based and desert-based approaches\nto blame and punishment (see, e.g., Nadelhoffer 2011; Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Morris, forthcoming; cf. Vargas\n2012a, 2015 who rejects this distinction as too simplistic).\nConsequentialist-based approaches are forward-looking in the sense\nthat agents are considered proper targets of reprobation or punishment\nfor immoral actions on the grounds that such treatment will, say,\nprevent the agent (or other agents) from performing that type of\naction in the future. Desert-based responsibility, on the\nother hand, is considered to be backward-looking and retributivist in\nthe sense that any punitive attitudes or treatments that are deemed\nappropriate responses for an immoral act/decision are warranted simply\nby virtue of the action/decision itself, irrespective of whatever good\nor bad results might follow from the punitive responses (see Morris,\nforthcoming). Understood this way, basic desert moral responsibility\nrequires a kind of power or ability an agent must possess in order to\njustify certain kinds of desert-based judgments, attitudes, or\ntreatments in response to decisions or actions the agent performed or\nfailed to perform. These reactions would be justified on purely\nbackward-looking grounds and would not appeal to consequentialist or\nforward-looking considerations, such as future protection, future\nreconciliation, or future moral formation. It is this kind of moral\nresponsibility that is being denied by moral responsibility skeptics\n(e.g., Pereboom 2001, 2014a; G. Strawson 1986; N. Levy 2011; Waller\n2011, 2014; Caruso 2012; Vilhauer 2009a,b, 2012; Sommers 2009; Focquaert, Glenn, & Raine\nforthcoming). \nImportantly, moral responsibility skepticism, while doubting or\ndenying basic desert moral responsibility, is consistent with agents\nbeing responsible in others senses. For instance,\nattributability responsibility is about actions or attitudes\nbeing properly attributable to, or reflective of, an agent’s\nself. That is, we are responsible for our actions in the\nattributability sense only when those actions reflect our identity as\nmoral agents, i.e., when they are attributable to us. Since\nattributability makes no appeal to basic desert or backward-looking\npraise and blame, it remains independent of desert-based\naccountability (see Shoemaker 2011, 2015; Watson 1996; Eshleman 2014)\nand is consistent with moral responsibility skepticism. \nThe answerability sense of responsibility defended by Thomas\nScanlon (1998) and Hilary Bok (1998) is also claimed by some skeptics\nto be consistent with the rejection of basic desert (see Pereboom\n2012, 2014a; cf. Jeppsson 2016a). According to this\nconception of responsibility, someone is responsible for an action or\nattitude just in case it is connected to her capacity for evaluative\njudgment in a way that opens her up, in principle, to demands for\njustification from others (Scanlon 1998; Bok 1998; Pereboom 2014a).\nWhen we encounter apparently immoral behavior, for example, it is\nperfectly legitimate to ask the agent, “Why did you decide to do\nthat?” or “Do you think it was the right thing to\ndo?” If the reasons given in response to such questions are\nmorally unsatisfactory, we regard it as justified to invite the agent\nto evaluate critically what her actions indicate about her intentions\nand character, to demand an apology, or request reform. \nAccording to Derk Pereboom (2014a), a leading moral responsibility\nskeptic, engaging in such interactions is reasonable in light of the\nright of those harmed or threatened to protect themselves from immoral\nbehavior and its consequences. In addition, we might have a stake in\nreconciliation with the wrong doer, and calling her to account in this\nway can function as a step toward realizing this objective. We also\nhave an interest in her moral formation, and the address described\nfunctions as a stage in the process. On this forward-looking reading,\nanswerability responsibility is grounded, not in basic desert, but in\nthree non-desert invoking desiderata: future protection, future\nreconciliation, and future moral formation (see Pereboom 2014a). \nBasic desert moral responsibility has also been distinguished from\ntake charge responsibility (Waller 1989, 1990, 2004, 2011,\n2014). Bruce Waller, for instance, has argued:  \nJust deserts and moral responsibility require a godlike\npower—the existential power of choosing ourselves, the godlike\npower of making ourselves from scratch, the divine capacity to be an\nuncaused cause—that we do not have” (2011: 40).  \nYet, he maintains,  \nyou [nevertheless] have take-charge responsibility for your own life,\nwhich is a responsibility you deeply value and enjoy\nexercising… (2011: 108).  \nTaking responsibility is distinguished from being morally\nresponsible in that, if one takes responsibility for a particular\noutcome it does not follow that one is morally responsible for that\noutcome. One can take responsibility for many things, from the mundane\nto the vitally important. For example, one can take responsibility for\nteaching a course, organizing a conference, or throwing a birthday\nparty. The responsibility taken, however, is profoundly different from\nthe moral responsibility that would justify blame and punishment,\npraise and reward (Waller 2011: 105; Pereboom 2001: xxi). \nWhile some philosophers may claim (or assume) that taking\nresponsibility entails being morally responsible (e.g., Smilansky\n2012), this seems to conflate a very important distinction. To take\nresponsibility for, say, organizing a conference, is to agree to put\nforth the effort needed to achieve a certain set of goals or\ntasks—e.g., inviting speakers, putting out a CFP, reserving the\nspace, etc. If the conference were to fail for reasons completely\noutside the control of the agent—say there was a major snowstorm\nthat day and several of the speakers could not make it—it would\nremain a separate and open question whether the agent who took charge\nfor organizing the conference was deserving of blame for the failure.\nFor many, the intuition is rather strong that she is not, especially\nin cases where the reasons for failure are external to the agent\n(e.g., a snow storm, canceled flights, etc.). But skeptics would\ncontend that the same remains true when the failure is due to the\nagent’s own flaws (e.g., their laziness) since in a naturalistic\nworld devoid of miracles these too are the result of factors outside\nthe control of the agent (e.g., determinism, chance, or luck). \nNow that we understand the kind of moral responsibility being doubted\nor denied by skeptics, we can examine the arguments for moral\nresponsibility skepticism. Traditionally, the concept of moral\nresponsibility has been closely connected to the problem of free will.\nIn fact, many contemporary philosophers simply define free will in\nterms of the control in action needed for moral responsibility (though\nan epistemic condition for moral responsibility is generally also\nadded)—see, for example, Pereboom (2001, 2014a), G. Strawson\n(1986, 1994), Campbell (1957), Clarke (2005a), N. Levy (2011),\nRichards (2000), Caruso (2012), Nahmias (2012), Mele (2006), Sommers\n(2007b, 2009), Vargas (2013), Wolf (2011), Vilhauer (2009a), Callender\n(2010). According to these theorists, the concepts of free will and moral responsibility stand or fall together. And while there are a few notable exceptions to defining\nfree will in this way—namely John Martin Fischer’s\nsemi-compatibilism (Fischer & Ravizza 1998; Fischer 2007)\nand Bruce Waller’s reverse semi-compatibilism (2015)—even\nthese philosophers nevertheless acknowledge that moral responsibility,\nas an independent concept, can be threatened by the same kind of\nconcerns as free will (e.g., determinism, indeterminism, chance, and\nluck). I will examine each of these threats in turn.  \nCausal determinism, as it is commonly understood, is roughly\nthe thesis that every event or action, including human action, is the\ninevitable result of preceding events and actions and the laws of\nnature. The traditional problem of free will and determinism\ncomes in trying to reconcile our intuitive sense of free will with the\nidea that impersonal forces over which we have no ultimate control may\ncausally determine our choices and actions. [I should note that a\nrelated problem arises with regard to God’s foreknowledge (see\nthe entry on\n foreknowledge and free will).]\n In the past, the standard view advancing moral responsibility\nskepticism was hard determinism: the view that causal\ndeterminism is true, and incompatible with free will and moral\nresponsibility—either because it precludes the ability to do\notherwise (leeway incompatibilism) or because it is inconsistent\nwith one’s being the “ultimate source” of action\n(source incompatibilism). For hard determinists, libertarian\nfree will is simply impossible because human actions are part of a\nfully deterministic world and compatibilism amounts to a\n“quagmire of evasion” (James 1884; see the entry on\n arguments for Incompatibilism). \nHard determinism had its classic statement in the time when Newtonian\nphysics reigned (see, Spinoza 1677 [1985]; d’Holbach 1770), but\nit has very few defenders today—largely because the standard\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics has been taken by many to\nundermine, or at least throw into doubt, the thesis of universal\ndeterminism. This is not to say that determinism has been refuted or\nfalsified by modern physics, because it has not. Determinism still has\nits modern defenders (e.g., Honderich 1988, 2002) and the final\ninterpretation of physics is not yet in (see, for example, the entry\non\n Bohmian mechanics).\n It is also important to keep in mind that even if we allow some\nindeterminacy to exist at the microlevel of our existence—the\nlevel studied by quantum mechanics—there would still likely\nremain determinism-where-it-matters (Honderich 2002: 5). That\nis,  \nAt the ordinary level of choices and actions, and even ordinary\nelectrochemical activity in our brains, causal laws govern what\nhappens. It’s all cause and effect in what you might call real\nlife. (Honderich 2002: 5)  \nNonetheless, most contemporary skeptics tend to defend positions that\nare best seen as successors to traditional hard determinism. \nOne of these positions is hard incompatibilism, which\nmaintains that whatever the fundamental nature of reality, whether it\nis deterministic or indeterministic, we lack basic desert\nmoral responsibility. Hard incompatibilism amounts to a rejection of\nboth compatibilism and libertarianism. It maintains that the sort of\nfree will required for basic desert moral responsibility is\nincompatible with causal determination by factors beyond the\nagent’s control and also with the kind of indeterminism\nin action required by the most plausible versions of libertarianism\n(see Pereboom 2001, 2014a). \nThe argument for hard incompatibilism can be sketched as follows:\nAgainst the view that free will is compatible with the causal\ndetermination of our actions by natural factors beyond our control\n(i.e., compatibilism), most hard incompatibilists maintain that there\nis no relevant difference between this prospect and our actions being\ncausally determined by manipulators (e.g., Pereboom 2001, 2014a). [For\nadditional arguments against compatibilism, see the entry on\n arguments for incompatibilism.]\n Against event-causal libertarianism, hard incompatibilists\ngenerally advance the “luck” or “disappearing\nagent” objection, according to which agents are left unable to\nsettle whether a decision/action occurs and hence cannot have\nthe control in action required for moral responsibility (Pereboom\n2001, 2014a; 2017c; Waller 1990, 2011, N. Levy 2008, 2011; for\nnon-skeptics who advance similar objections see Ekstrom 2000; Mele\n1999a, 2017; Haji 2001). The same problem, they contend, arises for\nnon-causal libertarian accounts since these too fail to\nprovide agents with the control in action needed for basic desert\n(Pereboom 2014a). While agent-causal libertarianism could, in\ntheory, supply this sort of control, hard incompatibilists argue that\nit cannot be reconciled with our best physical theories (Pereboom\n2001, 2014a; Waller 2011; Harris 2012; cf. N. Levy 2011)\nand faces additional problems accounting for mental causation. Since this exhausts the options for views on which we have the sort of free will needed for basic desert moral responsibility, hard incompatibilists conclude that moral responsibility skepticism is the\nonly remaining position. \nCritics of hard incompatibilism include both compatibilists and\nlibertarians. See, for example, the entries on\n compatibilism,\n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will, and\n arguments for incompatibilism.\n I will here only briefly discuss one possible compatibilist\nreply—the attempt to block the conclusion of the manipulation\nargument, one of the main arguments employed by hard incompatibilists\nand other incompatibilists. \nMost manipulation arguments introduce various science-fiction-like\nscenarios, or manipulation cases, aimed to show that agents who meet\nall the various compatibilist conditions for moral responsibility can\nnevertheless be subject to responsibility-undermining manipulation.\nThese arguments further maintain that these manipulation cases\nresemble in the relevant ways agents in the normal (non-manipulated)\ndeterministic case. They go on to conclude that if agents fail to be\nmorally responsible in the manipulated cases they also fail to be\nmorally responsible in the normal deterministic case (see Pereboom\n1995, 2001, 2014a; Mele 2008; Todd 2013; for a less demanding version\nof the argument, one that aims to show only that the manipulation in\nquestion is mitigating with respect to moral responsibility,\nsee Todd 2011).  \nConsider, for example, Pereboom’s famous “four-case”\nargument. The argument sets out three examples of actions that involve\nmanipulation, the first of which features the most radical sort of\nmanipulation consistent with all the leading compatibilist conditions,\neach progressively more like the fourth, which is an ordinary case of\naction causally determined in a natural way. The challenge is for the\ncompatibilist to point out a relevant and principled difference\nbetween any two adjacent cases that would show why the agent might be\nmorally responsible in the latter example but not the former. Here,\nfor instance, is the second case: \nPlum is just like an ordinary human being, except that a team of\nneuroscientists programmed him at the beginning on his life so that\nhis reasoning is often but not always egoistic, and at times strongly\nso, with the intended consequence that in his current circumstances he\nis causally determined to engage in the egoistic reasons-responsive\nprocess of deliberation and to have the set of first and second-order\ndesires that result in his decision to kill White. Plum has the\ngeneral ability to regulate his actions by moral reasons, but in his\ncircumstances, due to the strongly egoistic nature of his deliberative\nreasoning, he is causally determined to make his decision to kill. Yet\nhe does not decide as he does because of an irresistible desire.\n(2014a: 77) \nIs Plum morally responsible in the basic desert sense for killing\nWhite? Defenders of manipulation arguments say “no.” They\nfurther argue that there is no relevant difference between this case\nand mere causal determinism. By comparing this case to the other three\ncases—the final case being just like the above except that\nnatural deterministic causes have taken the place of the\nneuroscientists—Pereboom and others argue that it is simply\nirrelevant whether Plum’s psychological states\nultimately trace back to intentional agents or non-intentional causes.\nWhat does matter, and what is responsibility-undermining, is that in\nall four cases the agent’s actions are ultimately the result of\nfactors beyond their control. \nIn response, compatibilists adopt either hard-line or\nsoft-line replies (see McKenna 2008). Hard-line replies grant\nthat there is no relevant difference between agents in the various\nmanipulated scenarios and ordinary (non-manipulated) agents in\ndeterministic settings, rather they attack the intuition that agents\nare not morally responsible in the manipulated cases. They maintain\nthat as long as the various compatibilist conditions for moral\nresponsibility are satisfied, manipulated agents are just as free and\nmorally responsible as determined agents—despite what might be\nour initial intuition. Soft-line replies, on the other hand, try to\ndifferentiate between the various cases. They search for relevant\ndifferences between the cases, differences that would account for why\nmanipulated agents are not free and morally responsible, but\nnon-manipulated and causally determined agents are. There are,\nhowever, problems with both types of replies. \nThe main worry people have with the hard-line approach is that it\nconflicts too deeply with our intuitions about the relevant class of\nmanipulation cases (Capes, forthcoming). Many people find it highly\nimplausible that someone like Plum could be morally responsible in the\nbasic desert sense for his behavior given how the behavior came about\n(cf. Fischer 2011, 2014; McKenna 2008, 2014, 2017; Sartorio 2016;\nTierney 2013, 2014; Capes 2013; Haji & Cuypers 2006). The main\nworry with the soft-line approach, on the other hand, is that any\ndifference identified as the relevant one between manipulated agents\nand ordinary determined agents may be a difference that applies only\nto current manipulation cases but not future cases. For example, most\nextant manipulation cases involve external agents who act as\nintentional manipulators, whereas this is missing in the normal case\nof natural determinism. Proponents of soft-line replies might\ntherefore be tempted to point to this as the relevant difference.\nSetting aside for the moment the potential question-begging nature of\nthis move, the reply also suffers from the fact that new manipulation\narguments have recently been devised that avoid external agents\naltogether. \nA similar problem confronts soft-line replies that point to\nresponsibility-conferring conditions not specified in a particular\nmanipulation case (Lycan 1987; Baker 2006; Feltz 2012; Murray &\nLombrozo 2017). That is, even if one could point to a relevant\ndifference between an agent in an extant manipulation case and an\nagent in the naturally-determined case, this may only serve as an\ninvitation for proponents of the manipulation argument to revise the\nvignette on which their argument is based so that the agent now\nsatisfies the relevant condition on which the soft-liner insists\n(Capes, forthcoming). The challenge, then, for defenders of the\nsoft-line approach is to show that there is some kind of requirement\nfor free action and moral responsibility that can be satisfied by\nagents in deterministic settings but which cannot (in principle) be\nsatisfied by agents in manipulation cases. [For a recent attempt at\nsatisfying this challenge, see Deery and Nahmias (2017); for a reply,\nsee Capes (forthcoming).]  \nAnother argument for moral responsibility skepticism, one that makes\nno appeal at all to determinism or indeterminism, was first introduced\nby Friedrich Nietzsche (1886 [1992]) and later revived and fleshed out\nby Galen Strawson (1994, 2011). This argument maintains that free will\nand ultimate moral responsibility are incoherent concepts, since to be\nfree in the sense required for ultimate moral responsibility we would\nhave to be causa sui (or “cause of oneself”) and\nthis is impossible. Nietzsche, for example, writes: \nThe causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has been\nconceived so far; it is a sort of rape and perversion of logic. But\nthe extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly\nand frightfully with just this nonsense. The desire for “freedom\nof the will” in the superlative metaphysical sense, which still\nholds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated; the\ndesire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one’s\nactions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and\nsociety involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa\nsui and, with more than Baron Munchhausen’s audacity, to\npull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of\nnothingness. (1886 [1992] sec. 21) \nGalen Strawson makes a similar case for the impossibility of moral\nresponsibility with his so-called Basic Argument (1986, 1994,\n2011). The central argument can be summarized as follows: \nThe expanded version of the argument runs as follows (Strawson\n2011): \nThis argument trades on some strong and commonsense intuitions.\nIt’s intuitive to think that one is initially the way one is as\na result of heredity and early experience—and it’s\nundeniable that these are factors for which one cannot be held in any\nway responsible (morally or otherwise). Yet, it also makes sense to\nthink that one cannot at any later stage of life hope to accede to\ntrue or ultimate moral responsibility for the way one is by trying to\nchange the way one already is as a result of one’s genetic\ninheritance and previous experience, since both the particular way in\nwhich one is moved to try to change oneself, and the degree of\none’s success in one’s attempt to change, will be\ndetermined by how one already is as a result of one’s genetic\ninheritance and previous experience. And any further changes that one\ncan bring about only after one has brought about certain initial\nchanges will in turn be determined, via the initial changes, by\none’s genetic inheritance and previous experience. Such is\nStrawson’s argument for the impossibility of moral\nresponsibility. \nWhile this argument is simple, eloquent, and rather intuitive, it has\nbeen widely criticized by compatibilists and libertarians alike (see,\ne.g., Hurley 2000; Clarke 2005a; Bernstein 2005; Fischer 2006; Kane\n2000; Coates 2017; for replies see Istvan 2011; Parks 2009). Some\ncritics question Strawson’s notion of ultimate\nresponsibility, which he defines as  \nresponsibility of such a kind that, if we have it, then it makes\nsense to suppose that it could be just to punish some of us with\n(eternal) torment in hell and reward others with (eternal) bliss in\nheaven. (2011: 43)  \nOthers critics challenge the claim that in order to be responsible for\none’s actions, one has to be the cause of oneself. In the\nopposite direction, others try to escape from the regress of the\nargument by making sense of the possibility of self-creation\n(Bernstein 2005; see also Kane 1996; Lemos 2015; Roskies 2012). Others\nstill attack the claim that if what one does when one acts for a\nreason is to be up to one, then how one is mentally, in some respect,\nmust be up to one (Clarke 2005a). Finally, some simply suggest that accounts of free action\nare often meant to be accounts of precisely how it can be\nthat, even if it is not up to an agent how she is mentally, her action\ncan still be up to her, she can still have a choice about whether she\nperforms the action, even when she acts for reasons (Mele 1995:\n221–27). \nDefenders of the Basic Argument have attempted to counter these\nobjections in a number of ways. Some respond by arguing, contra\nFischer (2006), that the Basic Argument does not rely on the premise\nthat an agent can be responsible for an action only if she is\nresponsible for every factor contributing to that action (see\nIstvan 2011). Others argue, in response to Mele (1995) and Clarke\n(2005a), that it is highly counterintuitive to believe that an agent\ncan be morally responsible for an action when no factor contributing\nto that action is up to that agent (Istvan 2011). In response to the\nsuggestion that certain versions of agent-causal libertarianism can\nimmunize the agent to the Basic Argument (see Clarke 2005a), they\nargue that such accounts actually fail to do so (Istvan 2011). Lastly,\nsome defenders of the Basic Argument recast the argument in a form\nthat eliminates certain problems associated with Strawson’s\noriginal version and offer additional thought experiments to bolster\nits underlying assumptions (see Parks 2009). \nAnother argument that maintains that regardless of the causal\nstructure of the universe we lack free will and moral responsibility\nholds that free will and basic desert moral responsibility are\nincompatible with the pervasiveness of luck (see N. Levy\n2009a, 2011; cf. Haji 2016). This argument is intended not only as an\nobjection to event-causal libertarianism, as the luck\nobjection is, but extends to compatibilism as well. At the heart\nof the argument is the following dilemma: either actions are subject\nto present luck (luck around the time of the action), or they\nare subject to what Thomas Nagel (1979) influentially named\nconstitutive luck (luck that causes relevant properties of\nagents, such as their desires, beliefs, and circumstances), or both\n(N. Levy 2011). Either way, luck undermines moral responsibility since\nit undermines responsibility-level control. This is what Neil Levy\ncalls the Luck Pincer and it can be summarized as follows\n(Levy 2011: 84–97; as summarized in Hartman 2017: 43): \nUniversal Luck Premise: Every morally significant act is\neither constitutively lucky, presently lucky, or both. \nResponsibility Negation Premise: Constitutive and present\nluck each negate moral responsibility. \nConclusion: An agent is not morally responsible for any\nmorally significant acts.  \nLet us examine the argument in more detail, focusing first on what\nexactly is meant by “luck.” \nWhile there are several competing accounts of “luck” in\nthe literature, the Luck Pincer is couched in terms of a modal account\n(N. Levy 2011; cf. Pritchard 2005, 2014; Driver 2012; Hales 2015,\n2016; Latus 2000, 2003; Hartman 2017; Zimmerman 1987, 2002, 2009;\nCoffman 2015; see also entry on\n moral luck).\n The modal account, as developed by Levy (2011), defines luck by way\nof possible worlds without reference to indeterminism or determinism,\nand it classifies luck as either chancy or not\nchancy. An agent’s being chancy lucky is defined\nas follows:  \nAn event or state of affairs occurring in the actual world is chancy\nlucky for an agent if (i) that event or state of affairs is\nsignificant for that agent; (ii) the agent lacks direct control over\nthe event or state of affairs; and (iii) that event or state of\naffairs fails to occur in many nearby possible worlds; the proportion\nof nearby worlds that is large enough for the event to be chancy lucky\nis inverse to the significance of the event for the agent. (N. Levy\n2011: 36) \nOn the other hand: \nAn event or state of affairs occurring in the actual world that\naffects an agent’s psychological traits or dispositions is\nnon-chancy lucky for an agent if (i) that event or state of affairs is\nsignificant for that agent; (ii) the agent lacks direct control over\nthat event or state of affairs; (iii) events or states of affairs of\nthat kind vary across the relevant reference group, and…in a\nlarge enough proportion of cases that event or state of affairs fails\nto occur or be instantiated in the reference group in the way in which\nit occurred or was instantiated in the actual case. (N. Levy 2011:\n36) \nNote that the first two conditions are the same for an agent’s\nbeing chancy and non-chancy lucky—i.e., (i)\nsignificance, and (ii) lack of direct control. And\nwe can say that an event is significant for an agent if she\ncares about the event and it can have either good or bad significance\nfor her (N. Levy 2011: 13). It may, for instance, be chancy whether I\nhave an odd or even number of hairs on my head at 12 noon, but it\nwould be strange to say that this is a matter of luck since we\ngenerally reserve the appellation “luck” for events that\nmatter (N. Levy 2011: 13)—i.e., we do not generally\nspeak of entirely trivial events as lucky (i.e., as good or bad for an\nagent). With regard to the second condition, we can say that an agent\nhas direct control over an event if the agent is able (with\nhigh probability) to bring it about by intentionally performing a\nbasic action and if the agent realizes that this is the case (N. Levy\n2011: 19; cf. Coffman 2007). \nTo help understand how the third condition differs in the two\ndefinitions—i.e., the modal condition (chancy luck) and\nthe uncommon instantiation condition (non-chancy\nluck)—lets consider some examples. A paradigmatic example of a\nchancy lucky event is Louis’s winning the lottery. This is\nbecause (i) he lacks direct control over winning the lottery since\nthere is no basic action that he can perform to bring it about, (ii)\nthe event of his winning the lottery is also at least minimally\nsignificant, and (iii)—the modal condition—in most close\npossible worlds with a small divergence from the actual world, Louis\ndoes not win. On the other hand, Elaini may be non-chancy lucky for\nbeing a genius with a high IQ in comparison with her peers (Hartman\n2017: 44–46). This is because (i) Elaini lacks direct control\nover being a genius, (ii) it is significant for her, and\n(iii)—the uncommon instantiation condition—being a genius\nis not commonly instantiated in that reference group (assuming, of\ncourse, that most of her actual peers are not geniuses). \nTo these three conditions, we can now also add the distinction between\npresent luck and constitutive luck. We can say that\nan agent’s decision is the result of present luck if a\ncircumstantial factor outside of the agent’s control at or near\nthe time of action significantly influences the decision. Such\ncircumstantial factors could include the agent’s mood, what\nreasons happen to come to her, situational features of the\nenvironment, and the like. For instance:  \nOur mood may influence what occurs to us, and what weight we give to\nthe considerations that do cross our mind…Our attention may\nwander at just the wrong moment or just the right one, or our\ndeliberation may be primed by chance features of our environment. (N.\nLevy 2009a: 245; see also 2011: 90)  \nIn contrast, we can say that an agent’s decision is the result\nof constitutive luck if that decision is partially settled by her\ndispositional endowment, which is outside of her control (N. Levy\n2011: 87). Finally, while present luck is limited to cases of chancy\nluck, constitutive luck can be a subspecies of both chancy and\nnon-chancy luck since it can refer to a disposition that an agent\npossesses in either a chancy or a non-chancy way (N. Levy 2011:\n87). \nWith these definitions in place we can now return to the Luck\nPincer and see how libertarian and compatibilist accounts fare\nagainst it. Libertarian accounts famously face the problem of\nexplaining how a decision or action can be free, given the libertarian\ndemand for indeterminacy immediately prior to directly free action.\nMoral responsibility skeptics and compatibilists alike have long\nargued that such indeterminacy makes the action unacceptably chancy,\nin a way that is responsibility-undermining (see, e.g., N. Levy 2009a,\n2011; Mele 1999a,b, 2006; Haji 2002, 2004, 2005, 2014; van Inwagen\n2000; Pereboom 2001, 2014a; for some replies see\nKane 1999; Clarke 2005b; Mele 2017). And it is argued that this\napplies to both event-causal and agent-causal versions of\nlibertarianism (see Mele 2006; Haji 2004, 2016; N. Levy 2011). The\nkind of luck that is problematic here is present chancy luck,\nsince the agent’s putatively “free” decision is\nchancy (i.e., the same decision would fail to occur in many nearby\npossible worlds), significant, and the circumstantial factor outside\nof the agent’s control (i.e., the indeterminate event(s)) occurs\njust prior to the decision.  \nPeter van Inwagen (2000) makes vivid the lack of control a libertarian\nagent has over genuinely undetermined events by considering what would\nhappen if God rolled back the relevant stretch of history to some\npoint prior to an undetermined event and then allowed it to unfold\nonce more (N. Levy 2009a: 238). Since events would not unfold in the\nsame way on the replay as they did the first time round, since these\nare genuinely undetermined, and nothing the agent does (or is) can\nensure which undetermined possibility is realized, the outcome of this\nsequence (in this case the agent’s decision) is a matter of\nluck. Such luck, skeptics argue, is responsibility-undermining. \nCompatibilist accounts of moral responsibility, on the other hand, are\nvulnerable to their own powerful luck objection (N. Levy 2009a, 2011;\nHaji 2003, 2016; cf. Vargas 2012b). We can divide compatibilist\naccounts into two main categories: historical and\nnon-historical. Historical accounts are sensitive to the\nmanner in which an agent comes to be the kind of person they are, in\nthe circumstances in which they find themselves (see Mele 1995, 2006;\nFischer & Ravizza 1998). If an agent, for instance, decides to\ndonate a large sum of money to Oxfam, historical accounts of moral\nresponsibility hold that it is important how the agent came to have\nsuch a generous nature and make the decision they did—for\nexample, did the agent have a normal history and acquire the\ndisposition to generosity naturally, or did a team of neuroscientists\n(say) engineer them to have a generous nature? Non-historical\naccounts, on the other hand, maintain that moral responsibility\ndepends instead on non-historical factors—like whether an agent\nidentifies with his/her own desires (Frankfurt 1971) or the quality of\nan agent’s will (Scanlon 1998). \nThe main problem with historical accounts is that they cannot\nsatisfactorily explain how agents can take responsibility for their\nconstitutive luck. The problem here is analogous to the problem raised\nby manipulation arguments (N. Levy 2009a, 2011). Manipulated agents\nare the victims of (very bad) luck: the manipulation is significant\nfor them, they lack control over its (non-) occurrence, and it is\nchancy, in as much as there are nearby possible worlds in which the\nmanipulation does not occur (N. Levy 2009a: 242). The problem of\nconstitutive luck is similar in that an agent’s\nendowments—i.e., traits and dispositions—likewise\nresult from factors beyond the agent’s control, are significant,\nand either chancy or non-chancy lucky. A historical compatibilist\ncould respond, as they often do to manipulations cases, that as long\nas an agent takes responsibility for her endowments,\ndispositions, and values, over time she will become morally\nresponsible for them. The problem with this reply, however, is that\nthe series of actions through which agents shape and modify their\nendowments, dispositions, and values are themselves significantly\nsubject to present luck—and, as Levy puts it, “we cannot\nundo the effects of luck with more luck” (2009a: 244). Hence,\nthe very actions to which history-sensitive compatibilists point, the\nactions whereby agents take responsibility for their endowment, either\nexpress that endowment (when they are explained by\nconstitutive luck) or reflect the agent’s present luck, or both\n(see N. Levy 2009a: 247, 2011). \nIf this argument is correct, present luck is not only a problem for\nlibertarianism it is also a problem for historical compatibilism. And\nwhile present luck may be a bigger problem for libertarians,\nsince they require the occurrence of undetermined events in the causal\nchain leading to free action, the problem it creates for historical\ncompatibilists is nonetheless significant. With compatibilism, we need\nto assess the implications of present luck in conjunction\nwith the implications of constitutive luck. When we do, we see that\nthough it might often be the case that the role played by present luck\nin the decisions and actions of compatibilist agents is relatively\nsmall, it is the agent’s endowment—directly, or as\nmodified by the effects of present luck, or both—which explains\nwhy this is so (N. Levy 2009a: 248). An agent’s pre-existing\nbackground of reasons, desires, attitudes, belief, and\nvalues—against which an agent deliberates—is the endowment\nfrom constitutive luck, inflected and modified, to be sure, but\ninflected and modified by decisions which either express\nconstitutive luck, or which were not settled by the endowment, and\ntherefore were subject to present luck (N. Levy 2009a: 248).\nHence, the Luck Pincer: actions are either the product of constitutive\nluck, present luck, or both.  \nNon-historical accounts, on the other hand, run into serious\ndifficulties of their own with the epistemic condition on control over\naction. The epistemic condition maintains that moral responsibility\nfor an action requires that the agent understands that, and how, the\naction is sensitive to her behavior, as well as appreciation of the\nsignificance of that action or culpable ignorance of these facts (N.\nLevy 2011: ch.5; cf. Rosen 2003, 2004, 2008; Zimmerman 1997, 2009;\nVargas 2005a). Because the epistemic condition on control is so\ndemanding and itself subject to the Luck Pincer, non-historical\naccounts of compatibilism (as well as other accounts that may survive\nthe above arguments) face a serious challenge (see N. Levy 2011,\n2009b). Consider cases of non-culpable ignorance. Imagine, for\ninstance, that a 16th century surgeon operates on a patient\nwithout washing his hands or sterilizing his equipment, and as a\nresult his patient gets an infection and dies. The surgeon would not\nbe blameworthy in this situation because he was non-culpably ignorant\nof the risks of non-sterilization, since germ theory was not\nestablished until much later. In this and other cases of non-culpable\nignorance, the fact that agents are ignorant of the relevant details\nis frequently a matter of luck—either present luck or\nconstitutive luck or both. \nWe can say that non-culpable ignorance is chancy lucky when an agent\nfails to know that p (where p is significant for\nher), lacks direct control over whether she knows that p, and\nin a large proportion of nearby possible worlds does know that\np. Lets say I drop my daughter Maya off at a friend’s\nhouse for a play date. She has a peanut allergy and I forget to inform\nthe other parent, Dolores, at the time of drop-off. When I get to the\ncoffee shop, I realize this and immediately text Dolores about the\nallergy, but because I’m in a “dead zone” the\nmessage does not go through. Not having received my text, Dolores\nproceeds to give the kids a snack with peanut butter in it, resulting\nin Maya having a near-fatal reaction. Dolores’ non-culpable\nignorance in this case is chancy lucky since in a large portion of\nnearby possible worlds she would have received the text. The\n16th century surgeon example, on the other hand, is better\nseen as an example of non-chancy luck, since his ignorance is the\nresult of bad luck inasmuch as beliefs about germs vary across agents\nin different historical periods (the relevant reference group here),\nrather than nearby possible worlds.  \nSince non-culpable ignorance is responsibility-undermining and much\nmore common than philosophers typically think, it gives additional\nforce to the Luck Pincer. Thanks to luck, distant or present, agents\nwho perform wrongful actions typically lack freedom-level\ncontrol over their actions because they fail to satisfy the epistemic\ncondition on such control (N. Levy 2011: 115–16). In cases of\nunwitting wrongdoing, there often is no plausible candidate for a\nculpable benighting action that could ground blameworthiness\n(N. Levy 2011: 131). Furthermore, it is often the case that we cannot\nreasonably demand of agents that they do not act in ways that express\ntheir epistemic vices (N. Levy 2011: 126). When an agent does not see\nthat she is managing her moral views badly, it would be unfair to\nblame her for doing wrong if she had no internal reasons for omitting\nher bad behavior. This is because, when an agent is managing her moral\nviews badly from the point of view of objective morality, it\nis often the case that her subjective moral values and\nbeliefs—which ex hypothesi she does not know are\nwrong—are governing herself in a perfectly rational and\nconsistent way. Since these internal moral values and beliefs are\nthemselves a matter of luck—either present, constitutive, or\nboth—we once again arrive at the Luck Pincer. It would seem,\nthen, that present luck, constitutive luck, or both, swallows all, and\nboth libertarian and compatibilist accounts fail to preserve moral\nresponsibility. \nFor some objections to the Luck Pincer, see Talbert (2013, 2016),\nHartman (2017), Hales (2016). For a different argument based on luck for the conclusion that agents are far less morally blameworthy than we have hitherto\npresumed, see Haji (2016). For a compatibilism that is responsive to\nconcerns of luck but that resists full-blown skepticism about free\nwill and moral responsibility, see Paul Russell’s free will\npessimism (2017).  \nIn addition to these philosophical arguments, there have also been\nrecent developments in the behavioral, cognitive, and neurosciences\nthat have caused some to take moral responsibility skepticism\nseriously. Chief among them have been findings in neuroscience that\nputatively indicate that unconscious brain activity causally initiates\naction prior to the conscious awareness of the intention to act (see,\ne.g., Libet et al. 1983; Libet 1985, 1999; Soon et al. 2008; Wegner\n2002) and recent findings in psychology and social psychology on\nautomaticity, situationism, and the adaptive\nunconscious (see, e.g., Bargh 1997, 2008; Bargh & Chartrand\n1999; Bargh & Ferguson 2000; T. Wilson 2002; Doris 2002). \nThe neuroscientific threat to moral responsibility originates with the\npioneering work of Benjamin Libet and his colleagues. In their\ngroundbreaking study on the neuroscience of movement, Libet et al.\n(1983) investigated the timing of brain processes and compared them to\nthe timing of conscious will in relation to self-initiated voluntary\nacts. They found that the conscious intention to move (which they\nlabeled W) came 200 milliseconds before the motor act, but\n350-400 milliseconds after readiness potential (RP)—a\nramp-like buildup of electrical activity that occurs in the brain and\nprecedes actual movement. These findings lead Libet and others to\nconclude that the conscious intention or decision to move cannot be\nthe true cause of action because it comes too late in the\nneuropsychological sequence (see Libet 1985, 1999; Wegner 2002; Soon\net al. 2008; Pockett 2004; Obhi & Haggard 2004; Haggard &\nEimer 1999; Roediger, Goode, & Zaromb 2008). For some scientific\nskeptics, these and other findings (e.g., Soon et al. 2008) suggest\nthat the causal efficacy of the kind of willing required for free will\nand moral responsibility is an illusion (e.g., Wegner 2002). \nThere are, however, powerful objections to this interpretation of the\nneuroscientific findings. Some critics argue that there is no direct\nway to tell which conscious phenomena, if any, correspond to which\nneural events (Mele 2009). In particular, it is difficult to determine\nwhat the readiness potential corresponds to—is it, for instance,\nan intention formation or decision, or is it merely\nan urge of some sort? Al Mele (2009), for instance, has\nforcefully argued that the readiness potential (RP) that precedes\naction by a half-second or more need not be construed as the\ncause of the action but rather is best interpreted as the\nbeginning of forming an intention to act. On this reading,\nconscious intentions can still be causes. Other critics have pointed\nto the “impossible demand” of Libet-like experiments (N.\nLevy 2005), or the unusual nature of its experimental design (Nahmias\n2002, 2011), or to its irrelevance to moral responsibility (N. Levy\n2014a), or to alternative explanations that are less threatening\n(Rosenthal 2002; Dennett 2003). These objections have led many\ncontemporary philosophers (including many skeptics) to reject the\nneuroscientific argument for moral responsibility (see, e.g., Pereboom\n& Caruso forthcoming; N. Levy 2005, 2014a; Morris 2009).  \nThere are, however, other scientific threats to moral responsibility\nbesides those posed by neuroscience. Recent work in psychology and\nsocial psychology on automaticity, situationism, and\nthe adaptive unconscious, for instance, has shown that the\ncauses that move us are often less transparent to ourselves than we\nmight assume—diverging in many cases from the conscious reasons\nwe provide to explain and/or justify our actions (see, e.g., Nisbett\n& Wilson 1977; T. Wilson 2002; Doris 2002; Bargh 1997, 2008; Bargh\n& Chartrand 1999; Bargh & Ferguson 2000; Kahneman 2011). These\nfindings reveal just how wide open our internal psychological\nprocesses are to the influence of external stimuli and events in our\nimmediate environment, without knowledge or awareness of such\ninfluence. They also reveal the extent to which our decisions and\nbehaviors are driven by implicit biases (see, e.g., Uhlmann &\nCohen 2005; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz 1998; Nosek et al. 2007)\nand other unconscious System-1 processes (Kahneman 2011). No longer is\nit believed that only “lower level” or “dumb”\nprocesses can be carried out non-consciously. We now know that the\nhigher mental processes that have traditionally served as\nquintessential examples of ‘free will’—such as\nevaluation and judgment, reasoning and problem solving, and\ninter-personal behavior—can and often do occur in the absence of\nconscious choice and guidance (Bargh & Ferguson 2000; T. Wilson\n2002; Kahneman 2011). \nWhile these findings may not be enough on their own to establish\nglobal skepticism about moral responsibility, they represent a\npotential threat to our everyday folk understanding of ourselves as\nconscious, rational, responsible agents, since they indicate that the\nconscious mind exercises less control over our behavior than we have\ntraditionally assumed. Even some compatibilists now admit that because\nof these findings “free will is at best an occasional\nphenomenon” (Baumeister 2008: 17; see also Nelkin 2005; Herdova\n2016). This is an important concession because it acknowledges that\nthe threat of shrinking agency (Nadelhoffer 2011) remains a\nserious one independent of the neuroscientific concerns discussed\nabove. The deflationary view of consciousness which emerges from these\nempirical findings, including the fact that we often lack transparent\nawareness of our true motivational states, is potentially agency\nundermining and could shrink the realm of morally responsible action\n(see N. Levy 2014a; Nadelhoffer 2011; King &\nCarruthers 2012; Sie & Wouters 2010, Brink 2013; Caruso 2015a; cf. Vargas 2013;\nK. Levy 2015; McKenna & Warmke forthcoming; Ciurria 2013; Mele\n& Shepherd 2013). A major point of disagreement, however, is over\nwhether consciousness is necessary for moral responsibility, and, if\nso, what role or function it must serve (cf. N. Levy 2014a; Shepherd 2012, 2015a,b,c; Searle 2000, 2001; Hodgson 2005, 2012; Sher 2009; Doris 2002, 2015; Nahmias 2002;\nSmith 2005, 2008; Sifferd 2016).  \nLastly, independent of the two more specific concerns mentioned above,\nthere is also the more general insight, more threatening to\nagent-causal libertarianism than compatibilism, that as the brain\nsciences progress and we better understand the mechanisms that\nundergird human behavior, the more it becomes obvious that we lack\nwhat some have called “soul control” (see Clark 2013).\nNaturalists about the mind argue that there is no longer any reason to\nbelieve in a non-physical self which controls action and is liberated\nfrom the deterministic laws of nature; a little uncaused\ncauser capable of exercising counter-causal free will. While most\ncontemporary philosophers, including most compatibilists, have long\ngiven up on the idea of soul control, eliminating such thinking from\nour folk psychological attitudes may not be so easy and may come at a\ncost for some. There is some evidence, for example, that we are\n“natural born” dualists (Bloom 2004) and that, at least in\nthe United States, a majority of adults continue to believe in a\nnon-physical soul that governs behavior (Demertzi et al. 2009;\nFahrenberg & Cheetham 2000; World Values Survey 1991–2004; Riekki et al. 2013). To whatever extent, then, such dualistic thinking is present in our folk psychological attitudes about free will and moral\nresponsibility (cf. Nadelhoffer 2014; Mele 2014), it is likely to come\nunder pressure and require some revision as the brain sciences advance\nand this information reaches the general public (see, e.g., Greene\n& Cohen 2004). Of course, how and in what direction this revision\nwill occur is an open empirical question—e.g., some may adopt a\nrevisionism about free will and moral responsibility\n(à la Vargas 2005b, 2009, 2007, 2012a) while other may opt for\na more eliminativist response (à la Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Waller 1990, 2011; Strawson 1986; Caruso 2015b). \n[Note: While most anti-skeptical arguments focus on objections to the\nmanipulation argument, the luck objection, the Basic Argument, the\nLuck Pincer, etc., some recent anti-skeptical arguments have also\nfocused on the role of reference and alternative ways of thinking\nabout free will and moral responsibility. See, for example, the\narguments of Shaun Nichols (2013, 2015; Nichols et al. 2016) and \nOisín Deery (2015)\non reference and preservationism,\nKelly McCormick (2013, 2016) on anchoring reference in the context of\nresponsibility talk, and Manuel Vargas on preferring\nrevisionism to eliminativism (2005b, 2009, 2007,\n2012a).] \nTurning now to the practical implications of moral responsibility\nskepticism, we can ask, what would happen if we came to accept this\nview? In recent years a small industry has grown up around precisely\nthis question. Since disbelief in moral responsibility would clearly\nhave profound consequences for our interpersonal relationships,\nsociety, morality, meaning, and the law, it’s important to\nquestion whether these consequences would be (on the whole) good or\nbad. Critics of moral responsibility skepticism fear that it would\nundermine morality, leave us unable to adequately deal with criminal\nbehavior, increase anti-social conduct, and/or destroy meaning in\nlife. Moral responsibility skeptics, on the other hand, offer up a\nnumber of different views—including illusionism\n(Smilansky 1999, 2000), disillusionism (Nadelhoffer 2011),\nand optimistic skepticism (e.g., Spinoza 1677 [1985];\nPereboom 1995, 2001, 2002b, 2009, 2011, 2013a, 2014a; Waller 1989,\n1990, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2014; Sommers 2007a,b; Caruso forthcoming-b; N.\nLevy 2011; Vilhauer 2009a,b, 2012, 2013a,b; Milam 2016, 2017; Smuts\n2014; Morris, forthcoming). \nIn recent years, empirical attempts have been made to test the\npractical implications of moral responsibility skepticism. One widely\ncited study found that diminishing belief in free will, which is\nostensibly related to moral responsibility, caused participants to\n“cheat” more on a problem solving task (Vohs &\nSchooler 2008). Another study found that participants who were asked\nto read anti-free will prompts behaved more aggressively than\nparticipants exposed to neutral or pro-free will prompts (Baumeister,\nMasicampo, & DeWall 2009). Another indicates that reduction in\nbelief in free will correlated with reduction in monitoring of errors\n(Rigoni, Pourtois, & Brass 2015). And two additional studies found\nthat diminishing free will belief impairs learning from negative\nemotions (Stillman & Baumeister 2010) and causes participants to\nexhibit more negative attitudes toward out-group members (Zhao, Liu,\nZhang, Shi, & Huang 2014). Such findings seem to suggest that\ndiminished belief in free will and moral responsibility would indeed\nhave negative consequences. Yet such a sweeping conclusion may be too\nhasty. \nFirst, some have criticized these studies on philosophical and\nmethodological grounds (see, e.g., Miles 2013; Caruso, forthcoming-b;\nMorris, forthcoming). The “cheating” study, for instance,\nhas failed to replicate on a number of occasions (Carey & Roston\n2015; Open Science Collaboration 2015; Zwaan 2013\n[see Other Internet Resources]) and the passages\nused to prompt anti-free will belief have been criticized for not\nbeing representative of what most free will and moral responsibility\nskeptics claim (Morris, forthcoming). There is also the question of\nwhether the negative effects tested in these studies indicate anything\nabout the long-term consequences of moral responsibility\nskepticism. Most of these effects are short-lived and temporary. But\nas people become more acquainted with the skeptical perspective, and\nas they come to understand what it does and does not maintain, it\nremains possible that these effects would fade over time.  Lastly,\nthere is also a growing body of evidence in the opposite direction\nsuggesting that certain positive effects may follow from free\nwill and moral responsibility skepticism (Carey & Paulhus 2013;\nNadelhoffer & Tocchetto 2013; Krueger et al. 2014; Shariff et\nal. 2014; Caspar et al.  2017). \nA recent study by Shariff et al. (2014), for instance, found that\npeople with weaker belief in free will endorsed less retributive\nattitudes regarding punishment of criminals, yet their\nconsequentialist attitudes about punishment were unaffected. They also\nfound that learning about the neural bases of human behavior, either\nthrough reading popular science articles or taking an undergraduate\nneuroscience course, similarly reduced people’s support for\nretributive punishment. The same connection between belief in free\nwill and increased punitiveness has also been found in a number of\nother studies (see, e.g., Carey & Paulhus 2013; Clark et al. 2014;\nAspinwall, Brown, & Tabery 2012; Pizarro, Uhlmann, & Salovey\n2003). Additional studies have found that\nwhere belief in free will is strongest we find increased\nreligiosity and increased commitment to a cluster of\npotentially dangerous political beliefs and attitudes such as Just\nWorld Belief and Right Wing Authoritarianism (see Carey\n& Paulhus 2013; Nadelhoffer & Tocchetto 2013). The belief in a\njust world, for instance, is the belief that we live in a world where\npeople generally get what they deserve. But stronger commitment to\njust world belief is problematic since it correlates with the tendency\nto blame the victims of misfortunes for their own fate (see Lerner\n& Simmons 1966; Lerner 1965, 1980; Lerner & Miller 1978;\nWagstaff 1983; Furnham & Gunter 1984; Furnham 2003; Harper &\nManasse 1992; Montada 1998). \nGiven the mixed results of these empirical studies and the fact that\nthey tell us very little about any long-term consequences of adopting\nthe skeptical perspective, the real-life practical implications of\nmoral responsibility skepticism remain an open question. Perhaps, as\nthese studies indicate, it would have both good and bad\nconsequences. In which case, the practical question would shift to the\noverall balance—i.e., whether, on the whole, the\nconsequences would be good or bad. Or perhaps adopting the skeptical\nperspective would over time reduce or eliminate any initial\nnegative reactions—i.e., after an initial adjustment period,\npeople would come to terms with the new reality and their behavior\nwould normalize. An illustrative analogy might be made here with\nsimilar concerns voiced in the past about disbelief in God. It was\nlong argued (and perhaps still is argued in certain quarters of\nsociety) that if people were to come to disbelieve in God, the moral\nfiber of society would disintegrate and we would see a marked increase\nin anti-social behavior. These fears, however, have not materialized,\nas society has grown more secular over time. \nThe debate over the philosophical and practical implications of moral\nresponsibility skepticism nevertheless continues, and there is even\nsome debate among skeptics themselves. \nIllusionism is the view that while we lack free will and\nmoral responsibility, we should nonetheless promote belief in\nthese notions since to disbelieve in moral responsibility would have\ndire consequences for society and ourselves (see Smilansky 1999, 2000,\n2002, 2013). According to Saul Smilansky, one of the lead proponents\nof illusionism, most people not only believe in actual possibilities\nand the ability to transcend circumstances, but have  \ndistinct and strong beliefs that libertarian free will is a condition\nfor moral responsibility, which is in turn a condition for just reward\nand punishment (2000: 26–27; for more on the folk psychology of\nfree will and moral responsibility, cf. Nichols & Knobe 2007;\nNichols 2004; Deery et al. 2013; Sarkissian et al. 2010; Nahmias et\nal. 2005; Nahmias et al. 2007; Murray & Nahmias 2014).  \nSmilansky and other proponents of illusionism go on to argue that\nwhile our commonplace beliefs in free will and desert-entailing moral\nresponsibility are illusions, if people were to accept this truth\nthere would be wide-reaching negative intrapersonal and interpersonal\nconsequences. It would be devastating, they warn, if we were to\ndestroy such beliefs since the difficulties caused by “the\nabsence of ultimate-level grounding” are likely to be great,\ngenerating “acute psychological discomfort” for many\npeople and “threatening morality” (Smilansky 2000: 166).\nTo avoid such deleterious social and personal consequences, and to\nprevent the unraveling of our moral fabric, illusionism contends that\npeople should be allowed their positive illusion of free will and\nmoral responsibility—i.e., we should not take these beliefs away\nfrom people, and for those of us who have already been disenchanted,\nwe ought simply to keep the truth to ourselves. \nIn direct contrast to illusionism, is disillusionism: the\nview that to the extent that folk intuitions and beliefs about the\nnature of human cognition and moral responsibility are mistaken,\nphilosophers and psychologists ought to do their part to educate the\npublic—especially when their mistaken beliefs arguably fuel a\nnumber of unhealthy emotions and attitudes such as revenge, hatred,\nintolerance, lack of empathy, etc. (Nadelhoffer 2011: 184). Proponents\nof disillusionism typically point to the benefits of a world without\nmoral responsibility. They cite the many instances in which moral\nresponsibility practices are counterproductive from a practical and\nhumanitarian standpoint—notably in how they stifle personal\ndevelopment, encourage punitive excess in criminal justice, and\nperpetuate social and economic inequalities (see Waller 2011; N. Levy\n2012, 2015; Morris, forthcoming). They maintain that if we abandon moral responsibility “we can look more clearly at the causes and more deeply into the systems that shape individuals and their behavior” (Waller 2011: 287), and this\nwill allow us to adopt more humane and effective interpersonal\nattitudes and approaches to education, criminal justice, and social\npolicy. \nA policy of disillusionism is present in the optimistic\nskepticisms of several leading moral responsibility skeptics\n(e.g., Spinoza, Pereboom, Waller, Levy, Caruso, Harris, Vilhauer,\nMilam, and Morris). These optimistic skeptics maintain that life\nwithout basic desert moral responsibility is not only possible, but\nalso preferable. Prospects of finding meaning in life or sustaining\ngood interpersonal relationships, for instance, would not be\nthreatened (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller 2011; Sommers 2007a; Milam 2016, 2017). They further maintain that morality and moral judgments would remain intact (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller 1990, 2004). And although retributivism and severe punishment, such as the death penalty, would\nbe ruled out, they argue that the imposition of sanctions could serves\npurposes other than the punishment of the guilty—e.g., it can\nalso be justified by its role in incapacitating, rehabilitating, and\ndeterring offenders (see Pereboom 2001, 2013b, 2014a; N. Levy 2012,\n2015; Caruso 2016, 2017, forthcoming-a; Pereboom & Caruso\nforthcoming; Corrado 2013, forthcoming-a; Vilhauer 2013a,b; Focquaert,\nGlenn, Raine 2013, forthcoming; Murtagh 2013). \nOne concern people have with moral responsibility skepticism is that\nit would threaten our personal relationships and the fulfillment in\nlife that they provide. P.F. Strawson (1962) famously argued that our\njustification for claims of blameworthiness and praiseworthiness is\ngrounded in the system of human reactive attitudes, such as\nmoral resentment, indignation, guilt, and\ngratitude. Strawson contends that because our moral\nresponsibility practices are grounded in this way, the truth or\nfalsity of causal determinism is not relevant to whether we\njustifiably hold each other and ourselves morally responsible.\nMoreover, if causal determinism were true and did threaten these\nattitudes, as some moral responsibility skeptics are apt to maintain,\nwe would face instead the prospect of the cold and calculating\nobjective attitude, a stance that relinquishes the reactive\nattitudes and treats individuals as objects to be manipulated and\nfixed for consequentialist ends. Strawson argues that adopting the\nobjective attitude would rule out the possibility of the meaningful\nsorts of personal relationships we value (see also Wolf 1981, 1990).\nSummarizing the Strawsonian concern, then, we can say that adopting\nglobal skepticism about moral responsibility, assuming it was\npsychologically possible, would undermine expressions of our\ninter-personal reactive attitudes essential to good personal\nrelationships, and would jeopardize our intra-personal reactive\nattitudes such as guilt and repentance, which are\ncrucial to personal moral development. \nMoral responsibility skeptics generally respond to this Strawsonian\nconcern in two ways. One response argues that, contra Strawson, it\nis possible to adopt the objective attitude in a way that\nrespects persons and does not hinder our personal relationships\n(Sommers 2007a). The second and more common response acknowledges that\nStrawson may be right about the objective attitude, but denies that\nskepticism about moral responsibility requires us to reject all the\nreactive attitudes (Pereboom 1995, 2001, 2014a; Waller 1990, 2006, 2011; Milam\n2016). This latter approach maintains that the attitudes we most want to retain either are not\nundermined by moral responsibility skepticism because they do not have\npresuppositions that conflict with this view, or else they have\nalternatives that are not under threat. And what remains does not\namount to Strawson’s objectivity of attitude and is sufficient\nto sustain the personal relationships we value. \nPerhaps no one has done more to develop this second line of reply than\nDerk Pereboom (see 1995, 2001, 2002a,b, 2009, 2012, 2013a, 2014a). He\nargues, for instance, that while certain kinds of moral anger, such as\nresentment and indignation, would be undercut if\nmoral responsibility skepticism is true, these attitudes are\nsuboptimal relative to alternative attitudes available to us, such as\nmoral concern, disappointment, sorrow, and\nresolve. The expression of these replacement attitudes can\nconvey the same relevant information as moral anger but in a way that\nis less harmful and consistent with the denial of basic desert moral\nresponsibility. Expression of resentment and indignation “often\nfails to contribute to the well being of those whom it is\ndirected” and is “apt to have harmful effects”\n(Pereboom 2014a: 180). Moral anger frequently is intended to cause\nphysical or emotional pain, and can give rise to “destructive\nresistance instead of reconciliation” (Pereboom 2014a: 180). As\na result it has the potential to damage or destroy relationships. It\nalso often leads to excessively punitive and counterproductive social\npractices and policies (see Waller 2011, 2014; Carey & Paulhus\n2013; Nadelhoffer & Tocchetto 2013; Shariff et al. 2014). [For\nadditional arguments against moral anger and the benefits of\nrelinquishing it, see Flanagan (2016) and Nussbaum (2016).]  \nGuilt also appears to be one of the reactive attitudes\nimperiled by moral responsibility skepticism since it involves the\nsupposition that one is blameworthy in the basic desert sense for an\nimmoral action one has performed. Strawsonians fear that absent guilt\nwe would not be motivated to moral improvement after acting badly, and\nwe would be kept from reconciliation in impaired relationships.\nFurthermore, because guilt is undermined by the skeptical view,\nrepentance is also ruled out, because feeling guilty is a\nprerequisite for a repentant attitude. It is unclear, though, whether\nguilt is really needed to perform the functions mentioned above.\nSuppose instead of guilt an agent acknowledges that she has acted\nimmorally and she feels deep sorrow for what she has done, and as a\nresult she is motivated to eradicate her disposition to behave in this\nbad way (see Waller 1990: 165–66). Such a reaction, skeptics\ncontend, can secure the good that guilt can also secure, and it is\nwholly compatible with the skeptical perspective (see Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Waller 1990; cf. Bok 1998). Furthermore, since self-guilt can\noften be crippling and counterproductive for moral development, an\napproach that avoids guilt may actually be more successful in bring\nabout the desired change in agents (Sommers 2007a).  \nAnother reactive attitude that some think would be threatened by moral\nresponsibility skepticism is gratitude. Gratitude arguably\npresupposes that the person to whom one is grateful is praiseworthy in\nthe basic desert sense for a beneficial act (cf. Honderich 1988:\n518–19). But even if this is so, certain aspects of gratitude\nwould not be undercut, and these aspects would seem to provide what is\nrequired for the personal relationships we value (Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Sommers 2007a). Gratitude involves being thankful toward the\nperson who has acted beneficially. This aspect of gratitude is in the\nclear—e.g., one can be thankful to a young child for some\nkindness without supposing that she is praiseworthy in the basic\ndesert sense. And while gratitude also often involves joy as a\nresponse to what someone has done, skepticism about moral\nresponsibility does not yield a challenge to being joyful and\nexpressing joy when others act beneficially, so this too is in the\nclear. \nOf course, some of the recommended transformations in emotional\nattitudes may not be possible for us. In certain situations refraining\nfrom resentment or moral anger may be beyond our power, and thus even\nthe committed skeptic might not be able to make the change the\nskeptical view suggests. Yet, a committed skeptic need not eliminate\nthese attitudes completely to accept the conclusion that agents are\nnever deserving of praise and blame, she must attempt instead not to\nengage or entertain them (Sommers 2007a: 328;\nRussell 1992: 296). Shaun Nichols (2007), for example, invokes the\ndistinction between narrow-profile emotional responses, e.g.,\nlocal or immediate emotional reactions to situations, and\nwide-profile responses, which are not immediate and involve\nrational reflection (see also Pereboom 2014a). We might expect to be\nunable to appreciably reduce narrow-profile moral anger as an\nimmediate reaction upon being deeply hurt in an intimate personal\nrelationship. In wide-profile cases, however, diminishing or even\neliminating moral anger is open—or, at least, we can disavow it\nin the sense of rejecting any force it may be assumed to have in\njustifying a harmful response to wrongdoing. This\nmodification of moral anger, skeptics contend, might well be\nadvantageous for our valuable personal relationships, and it has the\npotential to bring about the equanimity that Spinoza (1677 [1985])\nthought skepticism about free will and moral responsibility, more\ngenerally, would secure (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; cf. Russell\n2004). \nSince moral responsibility skepticism would require us to reject our\nordinary view of ourselves as blameworthy and praiseworthy in the\nbasic desert sense, critics also fear that it would undermine\nmorality. Peter van Inwagen, for example, writes: \nI have listened to philosophers who deny the existence of moral\nresponsibility. I cannot take them seriously. I know a philosopher who\nhas written a paper in which he denies the reality of moral\nresponsibility. And yet this same philosopher, when certain of his\nbooks were stolen, said, “That was a shoddy thing to\ndo!” But no one can consistently say that a certain act was a\nshoddy thing to do and say that its agent was not morally\nresponsible when he performed it. (1983: 207) \nFellow libertarian C.A. Campbell agrees and asserts that denying moral\nresponsibility would destroy “the reality of the moral\nlife” (1957; quoted from Waller 2004: 427). The view that moral\nresponsibility is required for morality is not limited, however, to\nlibertarians. Susan Wolf also contends that if we deny moral\nresponsibility, then we must  \nstop thinking in terms of what ought not to be. We would have to stop\nthinking in terms that would allow the possibility that some lives and\nprojects are better than others. (1981: 386)  \nAnd compatibilist W.T. Stace flatly states, “it is certain that\nif there is no free will [and basic desert moral responsibility] there\ncan be no morality” (1952). Similar remarks can be found\nthroughout the literature—see, e.g., Copleston (1965: 488),\nMurphy (1988: 400), Hintz (1958), Rychlak (1979), Babbitt (1999: 88),\nand Smilansky (2000, 2005). \nThe notion, though, that moral responsibility is a necessary condition\nfor morality may not be as clear as these philosophers contend and is\ndirectly challenged by most skeptics (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller\n1989, 2004, 2011, 2014; Sommers 2007a; see also Haji 1998, 2002). First, it’s unclear what exactly these critics mean when they say that ‘morality’\nwould be undermined by moral responsibility skepticism. Are they\nclaiming that axiological judgments about intrinsic good and evil,\naretaic judgments concerning virtue, deontic judgments about moral\nobligations, right and wrong, etc. are all undermined? If so,\nthat would be an extreme claim. Even if we came to hold that a serial\nkiller was not blameworthy due, lets say, to a degenerative brain\ndisease, skeptics contend that we could still justifiably agree that\nhis actions are morally bad (Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller 2004, 2011). Judgments of moral goodness and badness need not require an agent who is blameworthy or praiseworthy, they simply\nrequire grounds by which we can differentiate between the two types of\njudgments. If one were a Calvinist, for example, they could point the\ntranscendent moral law as a way to judge while simultaneously\nrejecting all moral responsibility (Waller 2004: 428). Less exalted\nmoral systems, such as utilitarianism or Kantianism, provide\nalternative ways of grounding moral judgments. Of course, if one were\nto adopt a Kantian test of universalizability while rejecting the rest\nof Kant’s moral views (which do presuppose agents are morally\nresponsible), it would hardly be an orthodox Kantian view. But, as\nseveral skeptics have noted, the denial of moral responsibility is not\ninconsistent with the principles of Kantian moral rationalism (see\nWaller 2004: 429; Vilhauer 2013a,b; Pereboom 2014a). It is arguable, then, that\naxiological judgments of moral goodness and badness would not be\naffected by moral responsibility skepticism (Haji 1998; Pereboom 2001,\n2014a), and this may be sufficient for moral practice. \nNonetheless, critics might question that if determinism precluded\nbasic desert blameworthiness, would it not also undercut judgments of\nmoral obligation? Kant famously argued that “ought implies\ncan,” and that if the moral law commands that we ought\nto perform some action, it “inescapably follows” that we\nmust be capable of performing that action (1793 [1998: 94];\n1781 [1998]: A548/B576). And G.E. Moore, following Kant, argues that\none “cannot say of anyone that he ought to do a certain thing,\nif it is a thing which it is physically impossible for him to\ndo” (1922: 317). But if ‘ought’ implies\n‘can,’ and if because determinism is true an agent could\nnot have avoided acting badly, it would be false that she ought to\nhave acted otherwise (see Nelkin 2011: 100–101; cf. Jeppsson\n2016b). Furthermore, if an action is wrong for an agent just in case\nshe is morally obligated not to perform it, determinism would also\nundermine judgments of moral wrongness (Haji 1998). \nThere are, however, a number of possible ways to respond to this\ncriticism. One is to argue, as Waller (2004, 2011) does, that while\nthe ‘ought implies ‘can’ principle (OIC for short)\nis widespread and deeply entrenched, it is nonetheless false (see also\nSinnott-Armstrong 1984; Ryan 2003; Graham 2011). In fact, recent work\nin experimental philosophy suggests that the principle may not be as\nintuitive as philosophers think. Buckwalter and Turri (2015), Mizrahi\n(2015a,b), Chituc et al. (2016), Henne et al. (2016), and Turri\n(2017) have all run experiments testing ordinary “folk”\nintuitions about the link between moral requirements and abilities.\nThey each independently found that commonsense morality rejects the\nOIC principle for moral requirements, and that judgments about moral\nobligations are made independently of considerations about ability. By\ncontrast, they also found that judgments of blame were highly\nsensitive to considerations about ability, which suggests that\ncommonsense morality might accept a “blame implies can”\nprinciple or that judgments of blame may play a modulatory role in\njudgments of obligation (see Buckwalter & Turri 2015; Chituc et\nal. 2016). These empirical findings support Waller’s claim that\nthe OIC principle is a philosopher’s invention infected by\nmistaken assumptions about moral responsibility (cf. Kurthy &\nLawford-Smith 2015; Kurthy et al. 2017; Cohen forthcoming; Graham\n2011; Zimmerman 1996). \nAnother option for skeptics is to accept the OIC principle but adopt\nan axiological understanding of ‘ought’ and an\nepistemic reading of ‘ought implies can’\n(Pereboom 2014a). On this reading of the principle, when we say that\nan agent ‘ought to x,’ we are simply making an axiological\njudgment about x and recommending that the agent perform x at some\nfuture time. When we say ‘ought implies can,’ on the other\nhand, we mean that it is epistemically open to the agent that\nshe will develop the requisite motivation to x, and in this sense\ncan perform x. Furthermore, the axiological and epistemic\ncomponents are connected in that the recommendation made by the\naxiological judgment may itself contribute causally to producing the\nmotivation (Pereboom 2014a: 140). Of course, this is not the\n‘ought’ of obligation Kant and others may have had in\nmind, since given the assumption of determinism and that determinism\nprecludes alternatives, when one tells an agent that she ought to\nrefrain from performing an action of some type in the future,\nit’s not the ‘ought’ of specific action demand, but\nrather the ‘ought’ of axiological evaluation that is\nlegitimately invoked (Pereboom 2014a: 141). Pereboom calls this the\n‘ought’ of axiological recommendation (2014a:\n141), and it should not be understood as presupposing a route actually\nassessable to an agent, via reasons for action, to her acting in some\nrelevant way. All that is required for the legitimate use of\n‘ought,’ on this account, is that one be unsure\nepistemically about whether such a route is accessible, and in most\nreal-life cases this requirement is satisfied since we lack certainty\nabout the future (cf. Nelkin 2014; for reply see Pereboom 2014b).  \nFrom the skeptical perspective, then, morality is not about\nbackward-looking assessments of blameworthiness and praiseworthiness,\nsince these are rejected. Rather, morality is forward-looking and\nfunctions by invoking the ‘ought’ of axiological\nrecommendation, the epistemic sense of the notion of\n‘can,’ and (at least in the case of Pereboom (2014a,\n2017b)) a forward-looking notion of blame grounded in the goods of\nprotection, reconciliation, and moral formation. While critics may\nfear this is still not enough since morality must be capable of\ngrounding backward-looking judgments of blameworthiness and\npraiseworthiness, the skeptic’s conception of morality may\nnevertheless be sufficient for the vast majority of our moral\npractices. [Cf. Fischer 2004; Athanassoulis 2005; Edmundson 2007;\nRosen 2004; Moya 2010; Morris 2015] \nOne last practical concern about moral responsibility skepticism is\nthat it is unable to adequately deal with criminal behavior and that\nthe responses it would permit as justified are insufficient for\nacceptable social policy. This concern is fueled by two factors. The\nfirst is that one of the most prominent justifications for punishing\ncriminals, retributivism, is incompatible with moral\nresponsibility skepticism. The second concern is that alternative\njustifications that are not ruled out by the skeptical view per se\nface independent moral objections. Critics contend that these moral\nobjections are decisive. Skeptics about moral responsibility, on the\nother hand, argue that non-retributive alternatives exist that are\nboth ethically defensible and practically workable (see, e.g.,\nPereboom 2001, 2013b, 2014a; N. Levy 2012, 2015; Caruso 2016; Corrado 2001,\n2013, 2014, 2017,, forthcoming-a,b; Vilhauer 2013a,b; Focquaert,\nGlenn, Raine 2013, forthcoming; Shaw 2011; Murtagh 2013). \nWithin the American criminal justice system, the most prominent\njustification for criminal punishment is retributivism. This\nretributivist justification for\n punishment\n maintains that punishment of a wrongdoer is justified for the reason\nthat she deserves something bad to happen to her just because\nshe has knowingly done wrong—this could include pain,\ndeprivation, or death. For the retributivist, it is the basic\ndesert attached to the criminal’s immoral action alone that\nprovides the justification for punishment (see, e.g., Moore 1997;\nBerman 2008, 2013). This means that the retributivist position is not\nreducible to consequentialist considerations nor in justifying\npunishment does it appeal to wider goods such as the safety of society\nor the\n moral\n improvement of those being punished. A number of sentencing\nguidelines in the U.S. have adopted desert as their\ndistributive principle, and it is increasingly given deference in the\n“purposes” section of state criminal codes, where it can\nbe the guiding principle in the interpretation and application of the\ncode’s provisions (see Robinson 2008). Indeed, the American Law\nInstitute recently revised the Model Penal Code so as to set desert as\nthe official dominate principle for sentencing. And\ncourts have identified desert as the guiding principle in a variety of\ncontexts, as with the Supreme Court’s specifying retributivism\nas the “primary justification for the death penalty” (see\nRobinson 2008: 145–146; see also the entries on\n legal punishment and\n retributive justice.)\n  \nWhile there may be independent reasons for rejecting retributivism,\nreasons that have nothing to do with free will and moral\nresponsibility, it is clear that moral responsibility skepticism is\nincompatible with the retributive justification for punishment since\nit does away with the idea of basic desert. If agents do not\ndeserve blame just because they have knowingly done wrong, neither do\nthey deserve punishment just because they have knowingly done wrong\n(Pereboom 2014a). The challenge facing moral responsibility\nskepticism, then, is to explain how we can adequately deal with\ncriminal behavior without the justification provided by retributivism\nand basic desert moral responsibility. While some critics contend this\ncannot be done, moral responsibility skeptics point out that there are\nseveral alternative ways of justifying criminal punishment (and\ndealing with criminal behavior more generally) that do not appeal to\nthe notion of basic desert and are thus not threatened by the\nskeptical perspective. These include deterrence theories, moral\neducation theories, punishment justified by the right to harm in\nself-defense, and incapacitation theories. \nDeterrence theories are typically classified as a subspecies of\nconsequentialist theories of punishment. Consequentialist theories\nattempt to justify punishment as the best means to achieving certain\nindependently identifiable goods (see, e.g., Bentham 1823; J. Wilson\n1983; Walker 1991; see also entry on Legal Punishment). While\ndifferent consequentialist theories explain the final good or goods at\nwhich all our actions aim differently, the most plausible immediate\ngood that a system of punishment can bring about is the reduction of\ncrime. For this reason, consequentialist theories generally suggest\nthat punishment can help to reduce crime by deterring, incapacitating,\nor reforming potential offenders. Deterrence theories, in particular,\nhold that punishment can serve the dual purposes of deterring future\nbad or illegal behavior in the individual (him or herself) who is\npunished, as well as deter others from similar acts (Ellis 2003, 2005;\nHoskins 2011). Such theories are perfectly consistent with moral\nresponsibility skepticism since they are forward-looking and make no\nappeal to notions of just deserts and blameworthiness. \nThe most common objection to consequentialist deterrence theories is\nthat they would allow for manifestly unjust punishments. For example,\nexcessively harsh punishment of the guilty or punishment of the\ninnocent could in principle be justified if it were to effectively\nserve the aim of deterrence and crime reduction (see McCloskey 1957;\nHart 1968; Nozick 1974; Ten 1987; Smilansky 1990; Primoratz 1999;\nPereboom 2001, 2014a; Honderich 2006; Boonin 2008; Brooks 2012). This is\nsometimes called the use objection since it holds that\nconsequentialist theories allow, at least in principle, for the\nuse of persons to achieve certain desirable ends, in\nviolation of the Kantian intuition that persons should be treated as\nends-in-themselves. There are, however, a number of common responses\nto this objection. One is to argue that such ‘unjust’\npunishments would be justified if they would really produce\nthe best consequence (e.g., Smart 1973: 69–72; Bagaric &\nAmarasekara 2000; taken from Duff & Hoskins 2017). Another is to\nargue that in the real world it would be extremely unlikely that such\npunishment would ever be for the best, and even less likely that the\nstate could be trusted to reliably pick out those rare cases in which\nthey would be—thus the criminal justice system should adopt the\nview that such punishment is wrong and unjustifiable (see Rawls 1955;\nHare 1981; paraphrased from Duff & Hoskins 2017). Finally, some\nreply that a richer or subtler account of the ends that the criminal\nlaw should serve will generate suitable protections against unjust\npunishments (see Braithwaite & Pettit 1990; Tadros 2011). \nAnother approach consistent with skepticism about moral responsibility\nis moral education theories. These theories typically maintain that\npunishment can be justified only if it benefits the person being\npunished. An analogy is sometimes drawn with the justification for\npunishing children—i.e., children are typically not punished to\nexact retribution, but rather to educate them morally. Jean Hampton,\nfor instance, writes, “punishment should not be justified as a\ndeserved evil, but rather as an attempt, by someone who cares, to\nimprove a wayward person” (1984: 237). On Hampton’s moral\neducation account, punishment is justified if and only if it gets the\nwrongdoer  \nto reflect on the moral reasons for [the law’s prohibition] so\nthat he will make the decision to reject the prohibited action for\nmoral reasons, rather than for the self-interested reason of\navoiding pain. (1984: 212)  \nCritics, however, object on number of different grounds. Some point\nout that while moral education may be one plausible aim of\npunishment, it is not the “full and complete\njustification” Hampton (1984: 209) and others claim it to be\n(see Dagger 2011). Others argue that it is far from evident that\npunishing adult criminals is similarly likely to result in moral\nimprovements (Pereboom 2001: 162–3; 2014a: 161). Children and\nadult criminals differ in significant respects—i.e., adult\ncriminals, unlike children, typically understand the moral code\naccepted in their society, and children are generally more\npsychologically malleable than adults criminals are (Pereboom 2014a:\n162; 2001: 163).  \nWhether or not moral education theories succumb to these objections\n(cf. Drucker 1986; Shook 2004; Shafer-Landau 1991; Dagger 2011), there\nis another non-retributive alternative available to moral\nresponsibility skeptics: an incapacitation account based on the right\nof self-defense analogous to the justification for quarantine. This is\nthe approach favored by Pereboom and Caruso, and it draws on a\ncomparison between treatment of dangerous criminals and treatment of\ncarriers of dangerous diseases (Pereboom 2001, 2013b, 2014a, 2017a;\nCaruso 2016, 2017, forthcoming-a; Pereboom & Caruso\nforthcoming). In its simplest form, it can be summarized as follows:\n(1) Moral responsibility skeptics claims that criminals are not\nmorally responsible for their actions in the basic desert sense; (2)\nplainly, many carriers of dangerous diseases are not responsible in\nthis or in any other sense for having contracted these diseases; (3)\nyet, we generally agree that it is sometimes permissible to quarantine\nthem, and the justification for doing so is the right to\nself-protection and the prevention of harm to others; (4) for similar\nreasons, even if a dangerous criminal is not morally responsible for\nhis crimes in the basic desert sense (perhaps because no one is ever\nin this way morally responsible) it could be as legitimate to\nincapacitate him as to quarantine the non-responsible carrier of a\nserious communicable disease. \nThis account differs from the previous ones in two important ways.\nFirst, although one might justify quarantine (in the case of disease)\nand incapacitation (in the case of dangerous criminals) on purely\nutilitarian or consequentialist grounds, Pereboom and Caruso resist\nthis strategy. The incapacitation of dangerous criminals is instead justified on the ground of the right to harm in self defense and defense of others—a right that\narguably has broader appeal than consequentialism. They contend that\nthis justification makes the view more resilient to objections,\nespecially the use-objection mentioned above (Pereboom 2017a). This is because, as it is illegitimate\nto treat carriers of a disease more harmfully than is necessary to\nneutralize the danger they pose, treating those with violent criminal\ntendencies more harshly than is required to protect society will be\nillegitimate as well. Furthermore, innocent people could not be\nincapacitated on this account since they pose no direct threat to\nothers. \nSecond, the quarantine model places several constraints on the\ntreatment of criminals (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a). First, as less dangerous diseases justify only\npreventative measures less restrictive than quarantine, so less\ndangerous criminal tendencies justify only more moderate restraints.\nIn fact, for certain minor crimes perhaps only some degree of\nmonitoring could be defended. Secondly, the incapacitation account\nthat results from this analogy demands a degree of concern for the\nrehabilitation and well-being of the criminal that would alter much of\ncurrent practice. Just as fairness recommends that we seek to cure the\ndiseased we quarantine, so fairness would counsel that we attempt to\nrehabilitate the criminals we detain. If a criminal cannot be\nrehabilitated, and our safety requires his indefinite confinement,\nthis account provides no justification for making his life more\nmiserable than would be required to guard against the danger he poses.\nFinally, there are measures for preventing crime more generally, such\nas providing for adequate education and mental health care, which the\nmoral responsibility skeptic can readily endorse. The public\nhealth-quarantine model proposed by Caruso, for instance, extends\nthe quarantine analogy into the arena of public health and attempts to\nprioritize prevention and social justice. It calls for a shift away from\nthe myopic focus on punishment and toward a more holistic approach to\ncriminal behavior aimed at addressing the causal determinants of crime\nand the social injustices that give rise to crime. (For criticisms of\nthe quarantine model, see Corrado 1996; Smilansky 2011, 2017; Lemos\n2016; Tadros 2017). \nGiven the various non-retributive options available to moral\nresponsibility skeptics—for additional options see Corrado\n(2001, 2013, 2014, 2017, forthcoming-a,b), Vilhauer (2013a,b), N. Levy\n(2012, 2015)—it would be hasty to conclude that the skeptical\nperspective leaves us unable to adequately deal with criminal\nbehavior. It may even be the case, as many skeptics are apt to\npropose, that rejecting retributivism and basic desert would allow us\nto adopt practices and policies that are more humane and effective.\n","contact.mail":"gcaruso@corning-cc.edu","contact.domain":"corning-cc.edu"}]
