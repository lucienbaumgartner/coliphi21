He was deeply influenced by Walter\nBurley’s logico-ontological system and Wyclif’s metaphysics. His major\nextant work, a commentary on the Categories, heavily depends\non Burley’s last commentary on the Categories and Wyclif’s\nDe ente praedicamentali. Yet he was able to develop new\nlogical and semantic theories as well as the general strategy adopted\nby the Oxford Realists, as he methodically substituted reference to\nexternal objective realities for reference to linguistic and/or mental\nactivities.\n\n\n\nNot a great deal is known of Robert Alyngton’s life. Most of the\ninformation about him comes from Emden 1957–59. From 1379 until 1386,\nhe was fellow of Queens College (the same Oxonian college where Wyclif\nstarted his theological studies in 1363 and Johannes Sharpe taught in\nthe 1390s); he became Magister Artium and, by 1393, doctor of\ntheology. He was chancellor of the University in 1393 and 1395. In 1382\nhe preached Wyclif’s religious and political ideas in Hampshire\n(McHardy 1987). He was rector of Long Whatton, Leicestershire, where he\ndied by September 1398.  \n\nAccording to Emden 1957–59 and Ashworth & Spade 1992, Alyngton\nwas of considerable repute as a logician. Among his extant works, the\nfollowing can be mentioned (the most complete list of his writings is\nfound in Bale 1557–59 [pp. 519–20]): \n\nThe point of departure of every realist interpretation of\nthe Categories is the notion of being (ens) in its\nrelationship to the ten categories, as Realists considered the\ncategorial table to be a division of beings.  Like Burley, Alyngton\naffirms that (i) the division into categories is first of all a\ndivision of things existing outside the mind, and only secondarily of\nthe mental concepts and spoken or written terms which signify them,\nand (ii) things belonging to one categorial field are really distinct\nfrom those belonging to another—for instance, substances are\nreally distinct from quantities, qualities, and relations, quantities\nare really distinct from substances, qualities, and relations, and so\non (In Cat., cap. de numero et sufficientia\npraedicamentorum, Conti pp. 251, 252–53). \n\nUnfortunately Alyngton does not define being; yet, what he says about\n(1) the subject of the Categories (the real categorial being\nwhich can be signified by simple expressions, namely terms (In\nCat., cap. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum ,\np. 252), and (2) analogy (In Cat., cap. de\naequivocis, ms. London, Lambeth Palace 393, fol. 70r–v) seems to\nentail that, like Wyclif, he also thinks of being as a sort of an\nextramental reality proper to everything (God and creatures;\nsubstances and accidents; universal and individual items; things,\ncollections of things, and states of affairs) according to different\nmodes and degrees. \n\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all the realist authors,\nwith the only notable exception of Duns Scotus, regarded categorial\nitems as composed of two main aspects: the inner nature or essence,\nand their peculiar mode of being or of being predicated (modi\nessendi vel praedicandi). They maintained that the categorial\ntable divides categorial items according to their modes of being\n(or of being predicated) and not according to their inner natures (or\nessences). In particular, Thomas Aquinas (Sententia super Metaphysicam, liber V, lectio 9) based his method of finding the ten Aristotelian categories on the differences\nof modes of being predicated, and recognized three fundamental\nmodes of being predicated: essentially, proper to substances, when\nthe predication indicates what a given thing is; accidentally, proper to\nquantities, qualities, and relatives, when the predication indicates that\nsomething inheres in a subject; and externally, proper to the remaining\nsix categories, when the predication indicates that something which\ndoes not inhere in the subject nevertheless affects it. On the contrary Albert the Great (Liber de praedicamentis, tr. I, cap. 7) and Simon of Faversham (Quaestiones super librum Praedicamentorum, q. 12) based their method of finding the categories on the differences of modes of being. They admitted two fundamental modes of being: being by itself, proper to substance; and being in something else, proper to the nine genera\nof accidents. The latter was subdivided into being in something else\nabsolutely, proper to quantities and qualities, and being in something\nelse in virtue of a relation to a third thing (esse ad aliud), proper to the remaining seven categories. Walter Burley, whose last commentary on\nthe Categories is, along with Wyclif’s De ente\npraedicamentali, the main source of Alyngton’s commentary on\nthe Categories, recalled two ways of deducing the ten\nAristotelian categories, both based on the various levels of\nsimilarity among their own modes of being. Alyngton follows very\nclosely Burley’s first way of deriving the ten categories. In his\nopinion, there are two fundamental modes of being proper to things:\nbeing by itself, which characterizes substances, and being or inhering\nin something else, which characterizes accidents. The latter is\nsubdivided into three less general modes: being in something else in\nvirtue of its matter; being in something else in virtue of its form;\nand being in something else in virtue of the whole\ncomposite. Something can inhere in something else in virtue of its\nmatter, form, and composite according to three different ways: from\ninside (ab intrinseco), from outside (ab\nextrinseco), and partially from inside and partially from outside\n(partim ab intrinseco et partim ab extrinseco). If something\nis in something else in virtue of its matter and from inside, then it\nis a quantity; if from outside, it is a where; if partially from\ninside and partially from outside, it is an affection. If something is\nin something else in virtue of its form and from inside, then it is a\nquality; if from outside, it is when (quando vel\nquandalitas); if partially from inside and partially from\noutside, it is an action. If something is in something else in virtue\nof the whole composite and from inside, then it is a relation; if from\noutside, it is a possession (habitus); if partially from\ninside and partially from outside, it is a position (In Cat.,\ncap. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum,\npp. 252–53). \n\nAlyngton’s choice implies an anti-reductionist approach to the matter,\nwhich is confirmed by the solution of the problem of what properly\nfalls into the categorial fields. According to the standard realist\nconception, not only the accidental forms, such as whiteness, but also\nthe compounds they cause when inhering in substances, such as a\nwhite-thing (album), fall into the categories. Burley thought\nthat whilst the accidental forms properly fall into the categories,\nthe aggregates made up from a substance and an accidental form do not,\nsince they are beings per accidens, wanting in real unity. In\nhis opinion, such an aggregate may be said to fall into a certain\ncategory, the category into which its accidental form falls, only by\nreduction, in virtue of the accidental form itself.  On the contrary,\nWyclif maintained that the aggregates built up by a substance and an\naccidental form fall per accidens into both the category of\nsubstance and the category which the accidental form at issue belongs\nto (cf. Wyclif, De ente praedicamentali, cap. 1,\npp. 3–4).  Alyngton combines in an original way the two slightly\ndifferent opinions of Burley and Wyclif. He affirms that a thing can\nbe said to belong to a category in a threefold way: by itself, by\naccident (per accidens), and by reduction (per\nreductionem).  Something is in a category by itself if and only\nif the highest genus of that category is predicated by itself and and\ndirectly (in recto) of it (In Cat., cap. de\nnumero et sufficientia praedicamentorum, p. 259). In other words,\nif and only if the highest genus of that category is one of the\nconstitutive elements of the essence of the thing at issue. Accidental\nforms belong per se to the nine categories of accidents\n(In Cat., cap. de relativis, p. 300). Something is\nin a category by accident if and only if it is an aggregate from a\nsubstance and an accidental form. Such aggregates belong per accidens\nboth to the category of substance and to the category in which its\naccidental form is by itself (In Cat., cap. de numero et\nsufficientia praedicamentorum, p. 259; and cap. de\nrelativis, p. 300).  Something can be in a category by reduction\nin two different ways: in a broad sense (large) and in a\nstrict sense (stricte). Something is in a category by\nreduction large if and only if it is an aggregate, and the\nhighest genus of a certain category is predicated only indirectly of\nit. Something is in a category by reduction\nstricte if and only if it is not an aggregate, and, (a) like\ndifferences, it is a component of the reality of a thing which is in a\ncategory by itself, but the highest genus of that category is not\npredicated of it; or (b) it is the privation correlated to a certain\nproperty which, in turn, is in a category by itself; or (c), like\nextra-categorial principle such as God, the unity, and the point, it\nsomehow instantiates the mode of being proper to a certain categorial\nfield, but the highest genus of that category is not one of the\nconstitutive elements of the essence of that thing (In Cat.,\ncap. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum,\npp. 259–60). \n\nFundamental to Alyngton’s deduction of the categories and solution of\nthe problem of what falls into the categorial fields (and how) is a\nclose isomorphism between language (mental, written, and spoken) and\nthe world. Like Burley and Wyclif, he was firmly convinced that our\nthought is modelled on reality itself, so that it reproduces reality\nin all its elements, levels, and inner relations. Therefore, one of\nthe best ways of understanding the world lay for him in an accurate\ninvestigation of our notions and conceptual schemes, as they show the\nstructure of the world. A logical consequence of this conviction was\nhis strong propensity towards reification: he hypostatises the notion\nof being and considers equivocity, analogy, and univocity not only as\nsemantic relations between terms and things, but also as real\nrelations between extra-mental items (In Cat., cap. de\naequivocis, ms. London, Lambeth Palace 393, fols. 69v–70r). \n\nAccording to the common interpretation of the opening passage of the\nCategories, equivocal terms are correlated with more than one\nconcept and refer to a multiplicity of things sharing different\nnatures, whereas univocal terms are correlated with only one concept\nand refer to a multiplicity of things sharing one and the same nature.\nIn his last commentary on the Physics (after 1324), Burley\nhad maintained that the term ‘being’ is at the same time univocal and\nequivocal with respect to the categories, as a single concept\ncorresponds to it (broadly speaking univocity), but the categorial\nitems share it in different ways, according to a hierarchy of value\n(broadly speaking equivocity)—see his Expositio in libros octo\nPhysicorum, lib. I, tr. 2, cap. 1, ed. Venice 1501,\nfols. 12vb-13ra. In turn, Wyclif had admitted three main types of\nequivocity: by chance (a casu), analogical, and generic, the\nsecond of which applies to the relationship between being and\ncategories (De ente praedicamentali, cap. 2). Alyngton\nrecognises four main kinds of equivocity: by chance; deliberate (a\nconsilio); analogical; and generic. Equivocals by chance are\nthose things that just happen to have the same name, but with\ndifferent meanings and/or reasons for imposing the name. Those things\nare deliberate equivocals which have distinct natures but the same\nname, and are subordinated to different but correlated concepts. Those\nthings are analogical which share the nature signified by their\ncommon name in various degrees and/or ways. Generic equivocals are\nthose things which share the same generic nature in the same way, but\nhave distinct specific natures of different absolute value (In\nCat., cap. de aequivocis, fol. 70r-v). So, within\nAlyngton’s system, what differentiates analogy from univocity is the\nway in which a certain nature (or property) is shared by a set of\nthings: analogous things share it according to different degrees\n(secundum magis et minus, or secundum prius et\nposterius), univocal things share it all in the same manner and\nto the same degree (In Cat., cap. de univocis,\nfol. 71v). Alyngton argues that being is not a sort of genus in\nrelation to the ten categories, since it does not manifest their\nessence, nor is it predicated univocally of them; being is analogous\nin relation to the ten categories. It is the basic stuff of the\nmetaphysical structure of each reality, which possesses it in\naccordance with its own nature and level in the hierarchy of essences\n(In Cat., cap. de numero et sufficientia\npraedicamentorum, pp. 255–56). \n\nAmong the many kinds of beings (entia) that Alyngton admits, the most important set is that consisting of universal items. Universals are among the most disputed topics in Medieval philosophical literature. Like Wyclif and the other Oxford Realists, Alyngton claims that universals fully exist outside the mind and are really identical-to and formally distinct-from the individuals which instantiate them. Like Albert the Great whom he quotes by name, Alyngton recognizes three main kinds of universals: \n\nThe ideas in God are the causes of formal universals, and formal\nuniversals are the causes of intentional universals. Furthermore, like\nBurley and Wyclif, Alyngton holds that formal universals actually\nexist (in actu) outside our minds, and not potentially only\n(in potentia) as moderate realists thought (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 279)—even if, unlike Burley, he maintains they are really\nidentical with their individuals, for otherwise it would be impossible\nto explain, against the Nominalists, why and how individual substances\nshow different and more or less close kinds of similarity among\nthemselves (In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp.\n267–68). \n\nAccording to Alyngton, who depends here on Avicenna and Wyclif, formal\nuniversals are common natures in virtue of which the individuals that\nshare them are exactly what they are—as the human species is the\nform by which every man formally is a man. Qua natures, they\nare prior, and so indifferent, to any division into universals and\nindividuals. Universality (universalitas or\ncommunicabilitas) is as it were their inseparable property,\nbut not a constitutive mark of the nature itself (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, fol. 101v). As a consequence,\nformal universals can be conceived of in two different manners: as\nfirst intentions or as second intentions. In the former case, they are\nnatures of a certain kind and are identical with their individuals\n(for example, man is the same thing as Socrates). In the latter case,\nthey are properly universals (that is, something that can exist in\nmany things and can be shared by them), and are distinct from their\nindividuals considered qua individuals, because of opposite\nconstitutive principles (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 268). Therefore, universals are really\n(realiter) identical to, but formally (formaliter)\ndistinct from their individuals. In fact, universals are formal causes\nin relation to their individuals, and individuals are material causes\nin relation to their universals. Thus three different kinds of\nentities can be qualified as formal universals: \n\nAlyngton accepts the traditional realistic account of the\nrelationship between formal universals and individuals, and, like\nWyclif, improves it by defining its logical structure more accurately, in order to avoid the inconsistencies stressed by Ockham and his followers.\nAlyngton thought that a universal of the category of substance could\ndirectly receive only the predications of substantial forms more common\nthan itself. On the other hand, accidental forms inhering in\nsubstantial individuals could be predicated only indirectly\n(essentialiter) of the substantial form itself that those\nindividuals instantiate, predicated indirectly through and in virtue of\nthe individuals of that substantial form. So his description of the\nlogical structure of the relationship between universals and\nindividuals demanded a redefinition of predication. Alyngton was\nprobably the first to ameliorate Wyclif’s theory of predication by\ndividing predication into formal predication (praedicatio\nformalis) and remote inherence (inhaerentia remota) or\npredication by essence (praedicatio secundum essentiam).\nRemote inherence is grounded in a partial identity between subject and\npredicate, which share some but not all metaphysical constituents, and\ndoes not demand that the form signified by the predicate term be\ndirectly present in the entity signified by the subject term. On the\nother hand, such a direct presence is needed by formal predication.\n“Man is an animal” and “Socrates is white” are instances of formal\npredication; “(What is) singular is (what is) common” (singulare\nest commune) and “Humanity is running” (humanitas est\ncurrens) are instances of remote inherence, as according to\nAlyngton it is possible to attribute the property of being running to\nthe form of humanity if at least one man is running. However, he makes\nsure to use as a predicate term a substantival adjective in its neuter\nform, because only in this way can it be made apparent that the form\nsignified by the predicate term is not directly present in the subject,\nbut is indirectly attributed to it, through its individuals (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, pp. 288–90). \n\nThese remarks on the relations between forms and substances bring us\nto the core of Alyngton’s ontology: the doctrine of substance,\ndeveloped in the fifth chapter of his commentary on the\nCategories. Alyngton’s treatment can be divided into two main\nparts. (i) The first attempts to clarify what characterizes substance,\nand therefore what falls by itself into that category; (ii) the second\nis concerned with the distinction between primary (or individual) and\nsecondary (or universal) substances. \n\nAlyngton lists seven opinions about the nature and mode of being of\nsubstance, the last of which he supports. \n\nWyclif’s position about the nature of substance implies that the\ndistinction between potency and act is, from the point of view of\nmetaphysics, the most fundamental distinction, of which that between\nform and matter is but one example. As (i) prime matter is pure\npotentiality, while form is act, and (ii) the distinction between\npotency and act is wider than that between matter and form, the latter\nis a particular case of the former. In fact, according to Wyclif, the\ndistinction between potency and act runs though the whole of creation,\nsince it applies also to any kinds of spiritual creatures, whereas the\ndistinction between matter and form is found only in the corporeal\ncreatures. On the contrary, Alyngton seems to interpret the\ndistinction between potency and act as a particular case of the\ndistinction between matter and form, since he constantly explains the\nmeaning of the opposition potency-act in terms of the opposition\nbetween matter and form in a crucial passage that he quotes from\nWyclif’s De ente praedicamentali (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 267 [= Wyclif, De ente\npraedicamentali, cap. 5, pp. 38–39]).  The result is a sort of\nuniversal hylemorphism, since in this way matter and form serve as\nprinciples in the order of being as well as in the order of\nbecoming. All the more so because Alyngton seems to accept the thesis\nthat (angelic) intelligences are not pure forms existing by\nthemselves, but formal principles necessarily joined to the matter of\nthe heavens in such a way as to make up living beings (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, p. 264). \n\nA second consequence of this approach to the problem of the nature of\nsubstance is that, within his system, primary substances alone are\nsubstances properly speaking. This conclusion is confirmed by his\nanalysis of the distinctive mark (proprium) of substance:\nwhile remaining numerically one and the same, being capable of\nadmitting contrary properties, the modification taking place through a\nchange in the subject itself of the motion at issue. Alyngton appears\nto think that this description is satisfied only by primary (that is,\nindividual) substances (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\nfol. 104v). Secondary substances therefore are per se in the\ncategory of substance only insofar as they are constitutive parts of\nprimary substances. Thus, secondary substances belong to the category\nof substance by virtue of the individual substances that instantiate\nthem, since they are not formally substances. In fact, unlike primary\nsubstances, secondary substances are forms, and consequently\nincomplete entities with an imperfect and dependent mode of\nexistence. They require composite substances in order to properly\nexist. No form as such, not even the substantial ones, is formally a\nsubstance, since no form as such has (i) the capacity of underlying\npotency and act, and (ii) matter and form as its inner\nconstituent. Secondary substances are related to primary substances as\nformal principles of the latter. It is in this way that humanity and\n(say) Socrates are linked together. For this reason no secondary\nsubstances as such are totally identical with primary substances\n(In Cat., cap. de substantia, p. 280; see also\npp. 281 and 282–283). As a consequence, while ‘man is\nanimal’ (‘homo est animal’) is a sentence\nto which a formal predication corresponds in the world, a predication\nby essence matches ‘humanity is animality’\n(‘humanitas est animalitas’). Any (individual)\nman is an animal because of the form of humanity present in him qua\nits essential constituent, albeit the form of humanity as such is not\nthe principle of animality. Therefore, humanity is not formally\nanimality nor rationality, even though it is animality plus\nrationality (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\npp. 283–284; see also cap. de quantitate,\nfols. 106v–107r). \n\nPrimary substances are the substrate of existence of any other kinds\nof categorial being, as nothing exists in addition to primary\nsubstances but secondary substances and accidents, which both are\nforms present in individual substances. Like Aristotle\n(Categories 5, 2b5–6), Alyngton can therefore affirm that\nprimary substances are the necessary condition of existence for any\nother items of the world: nothing could exist, if primary substances\nstopped existing (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\np. 286). This does not mean, however, that it would be possible to\nfind in the world a primary substance (i) that would not belong to a\ncertain species, and (ii) without any accident inhering in it. It\nmeans that, from the point of view of full existence, accidents and\nsecondary substances always presuppose primary substances, as to be a\nprimary substance is to be an autonomous singular existing item\n(hoc aliquid), whilst (i) to be a secondary substance is to\nbe a quale quid, that is, an inner and essential\ndetermination (or form) of a primary substance, and (ii) to be an\naccident is to be an outer determination or aspect of a primary\nsubstance (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\nfol. 101v). \n\nSince Alyngton thinks of primary substances as the ultimate substrates\nof existence in relation to anything else, the only way to safeguard\nthe reality of accidents as well as their distinction from substance\nand from each other, while at the same time, to affirm their\ndependence on substance in existence, was to conceive of them as forms\nof the substance itself, and therefore as something existentially\nincomplete. Accordingly, like Wyclif, he insists that quantity,\nquality, and relations, considered as abstract accidents, are forms\ninherent in primary substances, whereas, if considered from the point\nof view of their actual existence as concrete items, they are not\nreally distinct from the substance in which they are present, but only\nformally, as they are modes of substances. So, the chief features of\nAlyngton’s treatment of accidents are his twofold consideration of\nthem as abstract forms and as concrete properties as well as his\ncommitment to their objective reality, since, in his opinion, they are\nmind-independent items of the world in both cases. Hence, the main\ngoals of his reading of the chapters 6–8 of the Aristotelian treatise\nare showing the ordered internal structure of the chief categories of\naccidents, and reasserting their reality and real distinction from the\ncategory of substance, against those thinkers, like Ockham and his\nfollowers, who had attempted to reduce quantity and relations to mere\naspects of material substances. \n\n1. (Quantity) According to the standard realist\ninterpretation of the Aristotelian doctrine of the categories,\nfollowed also by Alyngton among the nine genera of accidents, quantity\nis the most important one, as it is the basis of all further\naccidents, since quantity orders material substances for receiving\nquality and the other accidental forms (In Cat., cap. de\nquantitate, fol. 106r). On the contrary, Ockham had claimed that\nit was superfluous to posit quantitative forms really distinct from\nsubstance and quality, since quantity presupposes what it is intended\nto explain, that is, the extension of material substances and their\nhaving parts outside parts. As an accident, quantity needs substance\nas its substrate of inherence (cf. Ockham, Expositio in librum\nPraedicamentorum Aristotelis, cap. 10.4, in Opera\nphilosophica, vol. 2, pp. 205–24). Like Burley and Wyclif,\nAlyngton denies that material substance can be actually extended\nwithout the presence of the general form of quantity in it, thereby\naffirming its necessity. Hence, he tries to confute Ockham’s\nargumentation. He thinks that the existence of quantity always implies\nthat of substance, but he also believes that the actual existence of\nparts in a substance necessarily implies the presence of a general\nform of quantity in it, really distinct from the substance (say\nSocrates) in which it inheres, and formally distinct from the fact,\ngrounded on the substance at issue, that this same substance is a\nquantified thing. For Alyngton, what characterizes quantity and\ndifferentiates it from the other accidental forms, and in particular\nfrom quality, are the following features: (1) being the appropriate\nmeasure of anything, and (2) being an absolute entity which makes it\npossible that material substances actually have parts outside parts\n(In Cat., cap. de quantitate, fols. 106v, 107r,\n114v). \n\nIf the highest genus of the category of quantity is a form, the seven\nspecies Aristotle enumerates (line, surface, solid, time, place,\nnumber, and speech) clearly are not. Alyngton tries to meet this\ndifficulty by reformulating the notion of quantified-thing\n(quantum), and by proposing a method for deducing the seven\nspecies of quantity from the highest genus (a sort of sufficientia\nquantitatum). He considers the seven species Aristotle lists not\nas quantitative forms, but as the most proper and primary bearers of\nthe quantitative nature, revealed by the highest genus of the\ncategory. In fact, encouraged by the Aristotelian distinction between\nstrict and derivative quantities (Categories 6,\n5a38–b10), like Burley, he distinguishes two different ways of\nbeing quantified: by itself and accidentally (per\naccidens). Only the seven species of quantity would\nbe quanta by themselves, while any other quantum\nwould be such per accidens, and so indirectly, because of its\nconnection to one (or more) of the seven quanta per se\n(In Cat., cap. de quantitate, fol. 116r). \n\nIn Alyngton’s view, the seven species of quantity correspond to the\nseven possible ways of measuring the being (esse) of the\nmaterial substance. In fact, substance has two main kinds of being:\npermanent and in succession. And both of them can be either discrete\nor continuous. In turn, the being permanent and continuous of material\nsubstance can be measured either from inside or from outside. If from\ninside, then in three different modes: according to one, two or all\nthe three dimensions proper to material substances. In the first case,\nthe measure is line, in the second surface, and in the third solid. If\nit is measured from outside, then it is place. The being of material\nsubstance which is permanent and discrete is measured by numbers. The\nbeing which is in succession and continuous is measured by time. And\nfinally, the being of substance which is in succession and discrete is\nmeasured by the quantity called ‘speech’ (oratio)\n(In Cat., cap. de quantitate,\nfol. 107r–v). \n\nAlyngton’s derivation of the seven species of quantity from a unique\nprinciple common to them is unconvincing, but extremely interesting,\nnonetheless, as it clearly shows that he wants to stress the unity of\nthe category of quantity, which at first appears heterogeneous, and\nto trace the problem of reality and real distinction of quantities\nback to that of the nature and status of its distinctive mark. \n\n2. (Relations and Relatives) Aristotle’s treatment of\nrelations in the Categories and in the Metaphysics\nis opaque and incomplete. Because of this fact, in Late Antiquity and\nthe Middle Ages many authors tried to reformulate the doctrine of\nrelatives. Alyngton’s attempt is the most interesting among those of\nthe Late Middle Ages, as he was the only one able to work out a\nconcept of relation conceived of as an accidental form which is in\nboth the relatives at once, even if in different ways (In\nCat., cap. de relatione, p. 296). Consequently his\nnotion of relation can be considered the ontological equivalent to our\nmodern functions with two variables, or two-place predicates, whereas\nall other authors of the Middle Ages had thought of relations in terms\nof monadic functions. \n\nAccording to Alyngton, whose account partially differs from those of\nBurley and Wyclif, in the act of relating one substance to another four\ndistinct constitutive elements can be singled out: \n\nThe foundation is the main component, since it (i) joins the relation\nto the underlying substances, (ii) lets the relation link the\nsubstrate to the object, and (iii) transmits some of its properties to\nthe relation. Unlike Burley and Wyclif, Alyngton affirms that not only\nqualities and quantities, but substances too can be the foundation of\na relation (In Cat., cap. de relatione, p. 291). \n\nOn this basis, Alyngton can define relations of reason while\neliminating from their description any reference to our mind and using\nobjective criteria only, based on the framework of reality itself. In\nfact, he maintains that what characterizes relations of reason is the\nfulfillment of at least one of these conditions: (i) either the\nrelation’s subject of inherence or its object is not a substance;\n(ii) the object is not an actual entity; (iii) the foundation of the\nrelation is not an absolute being—that is. a substance, a quantity,\nor a quality (In Cat., cap. de relatione,\npp. 291–92, and 294–95). \n\n3. (Quality) The chapter on quality is the least complex and\ninteresting part of the whole commentary, since Alyngton is faithful\nto Aristotle’s text and doctrine, and sometimes even offers rather\nunproblematic analyses and elucidations. The main general topic he\ndeals with is the internal structure of the category. \n\nIn the first lines of the eighth chapter of the Categories\n(8a25–26) Aristotle observes that quality is among those things\nthat are spoken of in a number of ways—an affirmation which seems to\nimply that quality is not a highest genus, as, according to Aristotle\nhimself, what is spoken of in a number of ways always gathers in\nseveral different natures. Furthermore, the Stagirite speaks of four\nspecies of quality (habits and dispositions, natural capacities and\nincapacities, affective qualities and affections, figures and\nshapes), without explaining how they are related to one another and to\nthe highest genus of the category.  No Aristotelian commentator had\never thought that quality was spoken of in many ways purely\nequivocally. Therefore no Aristotelian commentator had ever presumed\nthat the term ‘quality’ could have several different (but connected)\nmeanings. On the contrary, they unanimously took for granted that it\nhad a unique ratio, common to all the items belonging to the\ncategory. They disagreed, however, about the status and hierarchical\norder of the four species mentioned by Aristotle. For example, Albert\nthe Great held that quality at once and directly splits up into the\nfour species, which would all be equally far from the highest\ngenus. Duns Scotus, Ockham, and Walter Burley maintained that the so\ncalled ‘species’ of the quality were not properly species (or\nintermediate genera), but modes of quality, since many singular\nqualities would belong to the first three species at the same time,\nas, unlike species, modes are not constituted by opposite\nproperties. Alyngton rejected both opinions. The latter because it\ncompromises the actual goal of a correct categorial theory, and the\nformer because it does not fit in with the standard infracatagorial\nstructure described by Porphyry in his Isagoge. Consequently, he\ninserts an intermediate level between the highest genus of the\ncategory and the four species by claiming that quality is first of all\ndivided into perceptible (sensibilis) and non-perceptible\n(insensibilis) qualities. Affective qualities and affections,\nfigures and shapes stem from the former kind of quality, while habits\nand dispositions, natural capacities and incapacities derive from the\nlatter. In fact, (1) figures and shapes are those perceptible\nqualities which inhere in substances because of the mutual position of\nits quantitative parts, while affective qualities and affections\ninhere in substances because of the form itself of the substantial\ncomposite. (2) Natural capacities and incapacities are inborn\nnon-perceptible qualities, while habits and dispositions are due to\nthe activity, both physical and, if it is the case, intellectual, of\nthe substance in which they inhere (In Cat., cap. de\nqualitate, fol. 130r). \n\nNot until the end of the fourteenth century did anyone claim\nextramental reality for second intentions, not even Walter Burley.\nAccording to him, second intentions are concepts that have a\nfoundation in the extramental world, but are not “things” in the\nproper sense of the term. This account implied that the keystone of\nmedieval realism, the principle of one-to-one correspondence between\nlanguage and the world, has to suffer an exception, since no common\nnature matches second intention terms. It was just in order to do away\nwith this exception that Alyngton (then followed by William Penbygull,\nRoger Whelpdale, and John Tarteys) hypostatized second intentions,\nheavily modifying the standard theory of the status of second\nintentions. In fact, Alyngton not only considers second intentions as\nobjective, but clearly hypostatizes them, speaking of them in terms of\nreal determinations joined to the modes of being of extramental things\nand directly inhering in them (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, pp. 268–69). As a consequence, he conceives of logic\nas an analysis of the general framework of reality, since according to\nhim logic turns on structural forms (aimed at building up semantic\ncontents), which are, as forms, independent of both such contents and\nof the mental acts by which they are learned. It is through these\nforms that the network connecting the basic constituents of the world\n(individuals and universals, substances and accidents) is disclosed to\nus (In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp. 278–79). The\nstrategy that supports this choice is evident: as in the case of\nrelations of reason, Alyngton is trying to substitute references to\nexternal reality for references to mental activity. In other words, he\nseeks to reduce epistemology to ontology. From a logical point of\nview, this means that the same interpretative pattern is employed in\norder to account for both the semantic power of proper names and\ncommon terms (that is, those expressions that refer to a class of\nindividuals), and first and second intentions. Like proper names,\ncommon terms also primarily signify and label a unique object—that\nis, a common nature. But unlike the object signified by a proper name,\nthe reality of the common nature is distributed among many individuals\nas their main metaphysical constituent, since it determines the\ntypical features of the individuals themselves. By associating common\nterms with such objects as their main referent, Alyngton thinks he can\nexplain the fact that a common term can stand for and label many\nindividuals at once.  Only in this way does he believe we can grant\nthe value of our knowledge, which otherwise lacks an adequate\nfoundation (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\nfols. 101v–102v). \n\nStill, this procedure, so strong and powerful, leads to a paradox when\napplied to terms of second intention by which we speak of singular\nobjects considered as such—that is, terms (or expressions) like\n‘first substance’ (substantia prima),\n‘individual’ (individuum), and so on. In fact,\naccording to Alyngton (and many other Realists of that period), a\ncommon term is always matched by a common nature really existing in\nthe world. Therefore, as the term ‘individual’ appears to\nbe common, since it can stand for a multiplicity of things, it should\nsignify an extramental common nature shared by them. As a consequence,\nwe would have to admit the existence of an individual common\nnature, that is a (self-contradictory) entity present in all the\nindividuals as the cause of their being individuals. Alyngton, who\nwould not give up the principle of the one-to-one relation between\nphilosophical language and the world, could remove this paradox only\nby classifying this kind of term among atomic (discreti)\nterms—that is, terms or nominal syntagms, like\n‘Socrates’ or ‘this man’ (hic homo),\nthat refer to individuals and not to sets of individuals. According to\nAlyngton, there are three main kinds of atomic terms: \n\nThe rule that terms can be listed as common ones if and only if they\nsignify a common nature is safe, but at the cost of a counterintuitive\ncategorization of their semantic power. In fact, according to\nAlyngton’s account, saying that Socrates and Plato are first\nsubstances simply means that (i) each one is what he is, and that (ii)\nwhat each one is is a non-universal substance. This is a solution that\nentails that to be an individual is not a positive state of affairs,\nbut a negative one, and therefore connects Alyngton’s ontology with\nHenry of Ghent’s theory of individuation. \n\nAlyngton’s metaphysics is an interesting example of that partial\ndissolution of the traditional doctrine which took place in between\nthe end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth\ncenturies. Within Alyngton’s ontology, the relationships between\nprimary (or individual) substances and secondary (or universal)\nsubstances, and between substances and accidents (both abstract and\nconcrete) as well as the inner natures of essential and accidental\npredications are so different from their Aristotelian originals that\nthe general meaning of the categorial doctrine is deeply\nmodified. According to Alyngton, formal-and-essential predication and\nformal-and-accidental predication would correspond to Aristotle’s\nessential and accidental predications respectively. But he regards\nremote inherence as more general than formal predication. Therefore,\nin his system formal predication is a sort of sub-type of remote\ninherence. This means that he recognises a single ontological pattern,\nfounded on a partial identity, as the basis of every kind of\npredicative relation. Thus, formal-and-essential predication and\nformal-and-accidental predication are very different from their\nAristotelian models, as they express degrees in identity as well as\nremote inherence. As a consequence, the relationships between\nsubstance and accidents and between individuals and universals (and\nhence the ontological status of universal substances and that of\naccidents) are completely changed. In Alyngton’s view, both concrete\naccidents, qua modes of individual substances, and universal\nsubstances, qua the main components of the natures of individual\nsubstances, are really identical-to and formally distinct-from primary\nsubstances. Moreover, in the Categories Aristotle\ncharacterizes primary substances as those beings which are neither\npresent in a subject nor predicable of a subject, and considers the\ncapacity of underlying accidents as the constitutive principle of\nsubstance, while Alyngton defines primary substance as what (i) is apt\nto underlie potency and act, and (ii) has matter and form as its inner\nfoundations, and explicitly affirms that underlying accidents is only\na derivative property of substance. Finally, because of his strong\npropensity towards hypostatization, he interprets Aristotle’s theory\nof homonymy, synonymy, and paronymy as an ontological theory about\nreal items and not as a semantic one about the relations between terms\nand things. Alyngton conflates the real and logical levels into one:\nlike Burley and Wyclif, he considers logic as the theory of the\ndiscourse on being (ens), turning on structural forms and\nrelations that exist in the world and are totally independent of the\nmental acts by which they are grasped. It is through these structural\nforms and relations that the network connecting the basic items of\nreality (individuals and universals, substances and accidents) is\nclearly disclosed. Yet, because of his peculiar ideas on substance and\npredication, his world is different from those of Burley and of\nWyclif.","contact.mail":"alessandro.conti@cc.univaq.it","contact.domain":"cc.univaq.it"}]
