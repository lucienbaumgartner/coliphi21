Not only\ncan we see our body and touch it, but we also have several inner\nreceptors that convey information about the position of our limbs, the\nbalance of our body, and its physiological condition. Unlike external\nperception, the inner sensory flow never stops and cannot be\nvoluntarily controlled. Thus, an important amount of information is\nconstantly available whether we want it or not, whether we pay\nattention to it or not. In that respect, our body qualifies as the\nobject that we know best. Yet, despite numerous sources of\ninformation, the phenomenology of bodily awareness is limited. In\npainful and learning situations, our body appears at the core of our\ninterest, but when we walk in the street, we are rarely aware of the\nprecise position of our legs and of the contact of the floor on our\nfeet. Schwitzgebel (2007), for instance, asked how frequently\nparticipants wearing a device beeping at random intervals had tactile\nexperiences in their left foot just before the beeping sound. He found\na high variability in the answers, but one participant reported\ntactile sensations only 16% of the time. Our conscious field is\nprimarily occupied by our environment, instead of the bodily medium\nthat allows us to perceive it and to move through it. Hence, the most\npermanent and preponderant object in life may also be the most elusive\none (Leder 1990; Merleau-Ponty 1945; O’Shaughnessy 1980).\n\n\nOne may then question whether we are completely unaware of it. Except\nin rare illusory or pathological cases, we never feel fully\ndisembodied. James (1890: 242), for instance, claims that we are\nconstantly conscious of the presence of our body, although at the\nmargin of the stream of our consciousness: \n\n\n\n\nOur own bodily position, attitude, condition, is one of the things of\nwhich some awareness, however inattentive, invariably accompanies the\nknowledge of whatever else we know. \n\n\n\nSimilarly, Gurwitsch (1985: 60) asserts: \n\n\n\n\nWe are immediately and directly aware of our body, at least in\nmarginal form, at every moment of our lives, under all circumstances,\nand at whatever place we might happen to find ourselves. \n\n\n\nBut what is the content of this marginal body consciousness? It seems\nto be reducible to the “feeling of the same old body always\nthere” or to a mere “feeling of warmth and intimacy”\n(James 1890: 242). But can we go beyond this rough and metaphorical\ndescription?\n\n\nAlthough for a long time the exclusive province of phenomenology\n(Husserl 1913; Gurwitsch 1985; Merleau-Ponty 1945; Henri 1965; de\nPreester 2007; Gallagher 2005; Legrand 2006; Mishara 2004; Carman\n1999), bodily awareness has attracted more and more attention from\nphilosophers from all traditions, leading among others to several\nmonographs and multidisciplinary volumes (for instance, see\nBermúdez et al. (eds.) 1995; Knoblich et al. (eds.) 2005;\nFulkerson 2014; Vignemont & Alsmith (eds.) 2017; Bermúdez\n2018; Vignemont 2018; Guillot\n& García-Carpintero (eds.) forthcoming; Tsakiris & de\nPreester (eds.) 2018; Vignemont, Serino et al. (eds.) forthcoming). This\nruns in parallel with a boom of research in cognitive neuroscience. In\nparticular, bodily illusions have raised a wide range of philosophical\nquestions about the underlying mechanisms of bodily self-awareness,\nquestions that are still open nowadays. For instance, it has been\nfound that if one looks at a rubber hand, while one’s own hand\nis hidden, and both the rubber and the real hands are synchronously\nstroked, one can report feeling as if the rubber hand were one’s\nhand (Botvinick & Cohen 1998). The rubber hand illusion has been\ntaken as the key for understanding bodily self-awareness. Yet, after\nmore than twenty years of research, what have we really learnt about\nthe body and the self?\n\n\nThe entry first describes the special way one has of knowing\none’s body from the inside. After comparing it with visual\nawareness and assessing its epistemological significance, it will ask\nwhether it should be understood as a form of perception. The entry\nwill then discuss the involvement of mental representations for bodily\nawareness, specifically exploring its relation with action and the\nnotion of body schema. In the last section, the entry will review\nseveral accounts of the sense of bodily ownership.\n\nThe body is a material entity located in space and time in the same\nway as a rock, a tree or a bird. But do we perceive and experience our\nbody like those other objects? Most philosophical interest for bodily\nawareness has come from its peculiarities. It is precisely because we\nassume that we are aware of our body differently from other objects\nthat it raises many questions. But what makes it unique? The most\nintuitive answer is that it bears a special relation to the self, and\nto self-awareness. As noted by O’Shaughnessy (1980: vol. 1, p.\n138),  \nNow there is every reason for expecting it to be a highly unusual\nrelation. For we are talking about the epistemological link\nbetween a man and in all probability himself qua material object! and\nin any case the one object in the universe that is his own body. Is\nnot that likely to be unusual?  \nHowever, although introspectively familiar, it is hard to exactly\npinpoint the nature of the specific relation. One way to characterize\nit is to say that many bodies, including our own, can appear to us\nfrom the outside but only our own body appears to us from the\ninside. Most definitions of the inside mode then amount to little\nmore than list the internal ways of gaining knowledge about our body.\nHowever, it is not clear that they form a unified category. What they\nhave in common is that they seem to all guarantee that bodily\njudgments are immune to error through misidentification relative to\nthe first-person. But are body senses the only ones to guarantee\nbodily immunity and are bodily judgments still immune when the grounds\nof bodily awareness are multimodal? \nMost discussions on bodily sensations focus on the privileged relation\nthey have with the subject’s body and assume a unified account\nfor bodily awareness, as if it made no difference whether one feels\npain, touch or hunger. However, there are clear physiological,\nphenomenological, and epistemic differences among them. Here is a\nbrief overview of the specificities of each type of bodily\nsensations: \nTactile sensations are mediated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors\n(see Entry on Touch). Touch carries information both about the object\none is in contact with and about the body part in contact (Katz 1925;\nFulkerson 2014; Richardson 2013; Vignemont and Massin, 2015). For\nsome, it is the most important sense because it gives us an\nexperiential access to the reality of the world we are in contact\nwith:  \nThere is no commoner remark than this, that resistance to our muscular\neffort is the only sense which makes us aware of a reality independent\nfrom ourselves. (James 1880: 29; see also Armstrong 1962; Condillac 1754; Maine de\nBiran, 1812)  \nHowever, there is a large debate in the literature about how to\ndistinguish touch from other senses. For instance, are thermal\nsensations tactile sensations or not? Should one distinguish sensory\ntouch and affective touch (McGlone et al. 2014)? \nProprioceptive experiences provide information about the\nposition and movement of the body, although the notion of\nproprioception is sometimes enlarged to refer to all bodily sensations\n(Bermúdez 1998). The mechanisms of proprioception include\nmuscle spindles, which are sensitive to muscle stretch, Golgi tendon\norgans, which are sensitive to tendon tension, and joint receptors,\nwhich are sensitive to joint position. One question is whether these\nsignals give rise to sensations or not (Anscombe 1962). \nThe sense of balance depends on vision, touch, and more\nimportantly on the vestibular system in the inner ear, which\nprovides information about the balance of the body. It includes three\nroughly orthogonal semicircular canals, which are sensitive to motion\nacceleration as our head moves in space, and two otolith organs, which\nare sensitive to the pull of gravity. It replies to two questions: (1)\n‘Which way is up?’ and (2) ‘Where am I\nheading?’. As for proprioception, one may question whether there\nis a phenomenology of balance. Besides cases of dizziness, there seems\nto be indeed a paucity of vestibular experiences in normal consciousness.\nThe vestibular system has been ascribed a major role for self-location\nby anchoring the subject to her location and in orienting the subject\nin the world (Wong 2017).  \nPain raises many challenges for philosophers (see Pain\nentry), and the variety of painful experiences makes the problems even\nmore complex (Corns 2014). From a physiological level, we have\nnociceptors on the skin that respond to dangerously intense\nmechanical stimuli, to mechanothermal stimuli or to thermal and\nchemical stimuli. According to the dominant theory, noxious signals\nare inhibited, enhanced or distorted by various factors via a gating\nmechanism at the level of the spinal cord that controls the amount of\nsignals from the periphery to brain structures and via a central\ngating mechanism (Melzack & Wall 1983). A major issue is to\naccount for both the sensory component of pain, which represents the\nfelt location and intensity of the sensation, and for the affective\ncomponent, its unpleasantness, which motivates protective behaviors.\nTo do so, recent representationalist theories propose that pain has\nevaluative content (Bain 2013) or imperative content (Klein 2015;\nMartinez 2011; Hall 2008). \nInteroceptive awareness provides information about the\nphysiological condition of the body in order to maintain optimal\nhomeostasis, namely, cardiovascular, respiratory, energy (feeding and\nglucose), and fluid (electrolyte and water) balances. It has been\nrecently suggested that interoception plays a major role for grounding\nthe “bodily self” (Damasio 1999; Craig 2003; Seth 2013;\nTsakiris & de Preester 2018). There is, however, a debate on how\nto define interoception (Ceunen, Vlaeyen, & Van Diest 2016). Does\nit include only information about the homeostatic state of the\norganism, as originally proposed by Sherrington (1906), or any\nsensation with an affective component, thus including pain and\naffective touch, as recently assumed by Craig (2003)? \nDavid Armstrong (1962) has been the only one to offer a taxonomy of\nall these bodily experiences. He draws a first contrast between\nbodily sensations and bodily feelings. Sensations,\nsuch as touch and pain, are local whereas feelings, such as thirst,\nhunger, fatigue, sleepiness, dizziness, and shortness of breath, are\nglobal. For instance, you can distinguish the local sensation of\npinprick at the tip of your index finger with the diffuse feeling of\nfatigue in your whole body. Or consider the case of thirst: it reveals\nthe general state of the entirety of your body missing water. More\ngenerally, interoceptive feelings inform us about the welfare of the\norganism as a whole. Their spatial principle of organization is thus\nholistic. Within the category of bodily sensations, Armstrong further\ndistinguishes transitive and intransitive bodily\nsensations. One experiences a mind-independent object in transitive\nsensations, as in touch, but it does not seem so in intransitive ones,\nas in pain. As described by Reid (1764: 56),  \nIf a man runs his head with violence against a pillar … he\nfeels nothing in the stone but feels a violent pain in his head. It is\nquite otherwise when he leans his head gently against the pillar, for\nthen he will tell you that he feels nothing in his head, but feels\nhardness in the stone. \nTo Armstrong’s list, one may add what has been called\nexistential feelings (Ratcliffe 2008; Billon 2015). All those bodily\nsensations listed above describe the ‘anecdotal’ state of\nthe body, so to speak, that is, the state of the body that keeps\nchanging (e.g., its posture, its temperature, its movement, and so\nforth). However, there is another aspect of bodily awareness, which is\nless directly connected to sensory receptors, and which concerns the\nenduring state of the body, its ‘fundamental’ properties.\nImagine having a terrible nightmare in which you are floating in the\nsky but then suddenly start falling down. After waking up, you become\naware that you are alive and that all your limbs are intact. You are\naware of your body being here in your bedroom, no longer floating up\nin the sky. You also regain awareness that this body has two legs and\ntwo arms that can cycle and swim, but that cannot fly. You are finally\naware that this body is of a highly peculiar significance for you: it\nis yours, or maybe even it is you. It includes the sense of bodily\npresence (awareness of one’s body as being here), the sense of\nbodily ownership (awareness of one’s body as being one’s\nown), and the sense of bodily agency (awareness of one’s bodily\ncapacities for action). These senses are rarely at\nthe forefront of consciousness because they normally do not vary, and\nthus do not attract attention. \nDespite their differences, all bodily experiences seem to display the\nsame epistemological signature: they ground the immunity to error\nthrough misidentification relative to the first-person of bodily\nself-ascriptions. Self-ascription of a property is said to be immune\nto error if and only if one cannot rationally doubt who instantiates\nthe property when one has gained information about the property in the\nappropriate way (although one can be mistaken about the property that\none ascribes to oneself) (Shoemaker 1968; Evans 1982). For instance,\nif I think that I am anxious because I feel anxious, my thought is\nimmune to error through misidentification of the subject. But if I\nthink that I am anxious because my psychoanalyst told me so, my\nthought is not immune to error. Indeed, the psychoanalyst may have\nconfused me with another patient, who is the person suffering from\nanxiety. To be immune, my thought must be grounded in introspection,\nthat is, on a way of gaining information about one’s mental\nstates from the inside. The question is whether the\nself-ascription not only of mental properties, but also of physical\nproperties (such as body posture) can be immune to error in such a\nway. Consider the following example. I form the judgment that my legs\nare crossed while I am seated around a small table with several other\npersons. Can I rationally doubt that they are mine? If I make this\njudgment on the basis only of my seeing legs, then I can confuse my\nlegs with the legs of the person seated next to me. By contrast, if I\nmake this judgment because I feel my legs as being crossed, then the\nanswer is negative. The inside mode of body senses guarantees immunity\nto error (IEM) because they provide a privileged informational access\nto one’s own body only. Because of this privileged relation, the\njudgement “my legs are crossed” is not grounded in the\njudgement “these legs are crossed” and in the\nidentification “these legs are mine”. Proprioceptive\nexperiences suffice to justify bodily self-ascriptions such that no\nintermediary process of self-identification is required\n(Bermúdez 1998; Brewer 1995; Cassam 1995; Evans 1982). \nBodily IEM has been taken by some as evidence that the self is\nembodied. For instance, Evans (1982) and Cassam (1997) use bodily IEM\nas an argument against the Cartesian view of the self. In a nutshell,\none can self-ascribe bodily properties as well as mental properties to\nthe self without self-identification. Hence the object of such\njudgments, the self, is not a Cartesian ego, but a bodily subject of\nboth mental and physical properties. However, others wonder if one is\nentitled to draw such a metaphysical conclusion from the\nepistemological fact of bodily IEM (Chen 2011; J. Smith 2006). Some\nfurther deny that bodily self-ascriptions display the same type of IEM\nas mental self-ascriptions (Shoemaker 1968; Coliva 2012). The IEM of\npain self-ascriptions, for instance, is said to be absolute or\nlogical. On this view, there is no possible world in which one can\nfeel pain and be mistaken about who is feeling pain. By contrast, one\ncan easily conceive a case of a cross-wiring scenario such that A is\nconnected through A’s proprioceptive system both to A’s\nbody and to B’s body. Then A can feel B’s legs being\ncrossed. The question then is whether this cross-wiring scenario\ninvalidates bodily IEM. One can also wonder about actual breach of\nbodily IEM, such as the rubber hand illusion in which subjects\nself-ascribe a hand that does not belong to them (Mizumoto &\nIshikawa 2005). However, one might reply that none of these thought\nexperiments or bodily illusions show that bodily sensations fail to\nguarantee IEM because the epistemic grounds of bodily self-ascriptions\nin these cases differ from ordinary somatosensory judgments (Salje\n2017; Vignemont 2012). At most, they show that bodily IEM is only\nde facto (Evans 1982). \nTo recapitulate, although the debate of IEM has mainly focused on the\nascription of mental states, the ascription of bodily properties\nraises three major questions: (i) Can bodily self-ascriptions be\nimmune to error, and if so, what are the appropriate grounds that\nsecure bodily IEM? (ii) Is bodily IEM of a different type from mental\nIEM? (iii) Does bodily IEM reveal the bodily nature of the self? \nAs just seen, it is generally assumed that vision, and other external\nsenses, do not guarantee bodily IEM. Ernst Mach famously reported\nstepping onto a bus and noticing a man who looked like a shabby\npedagogue. In fact, he was seeing himself in a large mirror at the far\nend of the bus (Mach 1914). Conversely, if we see a broken arm, we can\nmistake it for our own, although it is another person’s arm that\nis mixed up with ours (Wittgenstein 1958). On the basis of such\nexamples, it is said that no judgement based on external senses is\nimmune to error through misidentification. There is a gap between\nvisually knowing that a body is F and visually knowing that it\nis my own body that is F. Consequently, when people discuss\nbodily awareness, they rarely mean the visual awareness one can have\nof one’s body. \nSome, however, are opposed to such a contrast between external senses\nand body senses. For instance, the psychologist Gibson (1979) argues\nthat even while looking at the external world, our visual experiences\ncarry information about our own body:  \nI maintain that all the perceptual systems are propriosensitive as\nwell as exterosensitive, for they all provide information in their\nvarious ways about the observer’s activities… Information\nthat is specific to the self is picked up as such, no matter what\nsensory nerve is delivering impulses to the brain. (Gibson 1979: 115)\n \nThe fact is that when I have the visual experience of a tree in front\nof me, I cannot have the following doubt: “someone is standing\nin front of a tree, but is it I?” (Evans 1982: 222). Evans\nconcludes that visual experiences of the external world from an\negocentric perspective guarantee the IEM of self-locating judgments\n(Cassam 1995; Bermúdez 1998; Peacocke 2012; Schwenkler 2014).\nLikewise, one may argue that visual experiences of the body\ncould also guarantee IEM in some ecologically valid situations (Evans\n1982: 220 fn 26; Peacocke 2012).\nProprioception guarantees bodily IEM because of some biological facts\nabout the human body (i.e., the proprioceptive neural system is\nconnected only to one’s own body). In the same vein, one may\nsuggest that there are some other basic biological facts that secure\nthe link between certain visual contents and one’s own body. For\ninstance, I can see my nose if I close one eye and I cannot doubt that\nthis is my own nose when I see it from this specific angle.  \nThe fact that the inside mode exclusively results from body senses,\nwith no influence from external senses, has also been questioned by\nrecent empirical evidence (Stein & Meredith 1993; Ernst 2006; van\nBeers et al. 1999; Welch & Warren 1980). Information from one\nmodality can affect information in another modality. Multisensory\neffects occur very early on in sensory processing and they are often\nautomatic and mandatory. Consequently, the ‘normal’ way of\ngaining bodily self-knowledge is not on the basis of body senses only,\nbut rather on the basis of their integration with vision. Take the\nrubber hand illusion, which results from the incorrect integration of\nsomatosensory information and visual information about the rubber\nhand. It induces not only a sense of ownership for the rubber hand,\nbut also proprioceptive drift (i.e., one mislocalizes one’s hand\nin the direction of the location of the rubber hand) and referred\nsensation of touch (i.e., one feels touch on the rubber hand). It can\nbe explained by three major facts about the sensory systems. First,\noptimal estimates of bodily properties require combination of\ninformation from various sensory channels. Second, vision can dominate\nover proprioception and touch because it often offers more accurate\nand precise spatial information. Third, visual information can affect\nthe phenomenal content of bodily experiences. What we feel is\ndetermined not only by information from body senses, but also by\ninformation from external senses. Our access to the intrinsic\nproperties of our body is also partly based on vision. Although\nO’Shaughnessy (1989: 56) claims that that our body image is\nnothing more than a collection of information from body senses, it has\nbeen found that blind individuals have a less accurate representation\nof the size of their body parts compared to sighted individuals\n(Kinsbourne & Lempert 1980: 37). The fact is that vision is the\nonly sensory modality that can directly and reliably (though not\nperfectly) process size information (Longo & Haggard 2010). As\nconcluded by the neurologist Schilder (1935: 38) a long time before\nmultisensory research had started to take off:  \nIt is not the case that the schema of the body has two different\nparts, the one optic and the other tactile. It is in essence a\nsynaesthesia (…) The synaesthesia, therefore, is the normal\nsituation. \nThe notion of multimodality has become of interest to philosophers\nonly recently (Bennett and Hill, 2014; O’Callaghan 2020).\nUnfortunately, there is already little agreement in philosophy on the\nway to individuate the modalities themselves, let alone on how to\nunderstand multimodality. One crucial question is whether these\nmultisensory effects show that vision plays only a causal\nrole in fixing the spatial content of bodily experiences or whether\nbodily experiences are constitutively multimodal (Vignemont\n2014). One may also ask whether some features can be represented only\nthanks to multisensory integration (Briscoe forthcoming). A final\nquestion is whether multimodality comes at the cost of bodily IEM. If\nbodily self-ascriptions are grounded not only in the body senses,\nwhich secure IEM, but also in vision, which does not always guarantee\nIEM, then can one still claim that bodily self-ascriptions are immune\nto error? \nThe previous section highlighted that I am aware from the inside only\nof my own body. Does it prevent bodily awareness to be perceptual? Do\nthe body senses qualify as sensory modalities? Aristotle lists only\nfive of them (sight, hearing, touch, olfaction, smell) and if we added\nthe body senses, we would end up with possibly more than ten. The\nquestion then is whether these so-called body senses behave like\nsensory systems that lead to perceptual experiences. At first sight,\nit may seem that some types of bodily experiences (like touch) are\nperceptual, but not others (like pain, tickles, itches, thirst or\nhunger) because they seem subjective and incorrigible (Aydede 2009).\nBut even if we focus on transitive bodily sensations, they differ from\nvisual experiences on several respects. They are continuously active\nand they function largely outside consciousness. They often do not\nappear to provide a sensory field in which perceptual objects can be\npresented (Martin 1992, 1993; Wong 2017). Finally, there are important\nepistemic asymmetries, bodily sensations appearing as less reliable\nthan visual sensations (Munro forthcoming). \nSome of the worries outlined above may just evaporate if one gives up\ntheories of perception that treat vision as the paradigm of sense\nperception. It is indeed controversial that every external sense,\nincluding olfaction for example, meets all the constraints posited by\nvisuo-centric models and more recent works on perception go beyond\nvision (e.g., McPherson (ed) 2011; Matthen (ed) 2015; Gatzia &\nBroogard (eds) 2020). Furthermore, what implications, if any, do\nmultisensory effects have for the perceptual debate? In brief, as\noutlined in the previous section, I am aware that legs are crossed on\nthe basis of the integration between vision and proprioception. Does\nthe involvement of visual information suffice to make my sense of\nposture perceptual? \nThis section will focus on four issues: the notion of the body as a\nperceptual object, the spatial peculiarities of bodily awareness, the\nalleged epistemic failure for bodily sensations to ground bodily\nknowledge, and the relationship between bodily awareness and\naction. \nMcGinn (1996: 8) claims: “bodily sensations do not have an\nintentional object in the way perceptual experiences do”. His\nview is shared by many, for at least two reasons: (i) the body cannot\nboth anchor our perception of the world and be an object of perception\nfor risk of infinite regress; and (ii) the body senses do not need to\nidentify and reidentify the body since they give information about\nnothing else. \nThe first objection comes from Merleau-Ponty (1945: 92), who claims:\n“The body is not one more among external objects”. He\ndraws the distinction between the objective body made of muscles and\nbones, and the lived body (corps propre), that is, the body\nthat we experience in pre-reflective awareness. He argues that the\nlived body is not an object that can be perceived from various\nperspectives, left aside or localized in objective space. On the\ncontrary, it is the zero-point (Husserl 1913), from which one can see\nthe objective space. If one were to adopt an objective stance on the\nlived body, then the objectified body could no longer anchor the way\none perceives the world. Likewise, Gallagher (2003) argues that bodily\nexperiences should not be understood in perceptual terms. Using\nWittgenstein’s distinction between the self as a subject and the\nself as an object, Gallagher argues that the lived body must be\nconceived as subject. Only then can it ground our conscious experience\nof the world. However, subjectivity is not incompatible with\nintentionality. Arguably, one can perceive the self as a subject\n(Bermúdez 1998). Furthermore, the lived body can be a\nperceptual object without being transformed into an object among\nothers. Dokic (2003), for instance, claims that bodily sensations\ndisplay a special kind of perceptual awareness, but it is\nstill perceptual. \nThe second objection against the perceptual model follows from\nShoemaker’s (1994) standard model of perception. On his view,\none key condition of perception is that the way of gaining information\nallows for identification and re-identification of the perceived\nobjects. The difficulty with the body senses is that they seem to give\naccess only to a single object, namely, one’s body. Several\nanswers have been offered to this objection. For instance, Schwenkler\n(2013) replies that the body senses still convey facts about different\nobjects insofar as they convey facts about different parts of the\nbody. It is not clear, however, whether this suffices to refute the\nobjection. Martin (1995), on the other hand, defends what he calls the\nsole-object view, according to which bodily sensations are only about\none’s body and when they are not, they are illusory or\nhallucinatory. Still, on his view, this does not prevent bodily\nsensations to be perceptual. One indeed experiences one’s body\nas a bounded object. By becoming aware of bodily boundaries, one then\nbecomes aware of a larger space that contains one’s body as well\nas other objects (see also Bermúdez 1998). \nOne can also question the perceptual character of bodily sensations on\nthe basis of their peculiar spatiality. We experience sensations\n“at-a-part-of-body-at-a-point-in-body-relative-space”\n(O’Shaughnessy 1980). In Bermúdez’s (2005) terms,\nbodily sensations have both A-location (i.e., bodily frame of\nreference independent of the posture of the body) and B-location\n(i.e., external frame relative to the posture of the body). But how to\naccount for A and B-location? As Merleau-Ponty (1945: 98) warns,\n“ordinary spatial relations do not cross” the experience\nof the space of the body. It seems indeed that the way we experience\nbodily space does not follow some basic spatial rules (Coburn 1966;\nVesey 1964; Margolis 1966; K. Baier, 1964; Holly 1986). For instance,\nthe pain that I feel in my thumb is not felt in my mouth when my thumb\nis in my mouth (Block 1983). Nor does it seem to make sense to claim\nthat the pain in my thumb is far from the pain in my foot. How can one\nenvisage accounting for bodily space in terms of Cartesian reference\nframe when one cannot provide a center of this frame, nor suggest axes\non which one could compute distances and directions (Bermúdez\n2005)? One may conclude that the claim that one feels pain in\nthe finger does not indicate the location of the sensation, but rather\nthe state of the finger (Noordhof 2001; for discussion see Tye 2002).\nOne may then question whether bodily\nsensations themselves are intrinsically spatial. According to the\nLocal sign theory, as defended in the 19th century by psychologists\nsuch as Wundt, Titchener and James, each sensible nerve gives rise to\nits own characteristic sensation that is specific to the body part\nthat is stimulated but spatial ascription does not derive from the\nspatial content of bodily sensations themselves. As described by James\n(1890: 798), the Local sign theorists deny  \nthat there can be in a sensation any element of actual locality, any\ntone as it were which cries to us immediately and without further ado,\n“I am here”, or “I am there”.  \nHowever, there seems to be no non-spatial differences between\nsensations in one’s right and left hands (Holly 1986;\nO’Shaughnessy 1980; Margolis 1966; Coburn 1966). How then do I\nfeel the right or the left hand to be touched? And how to account for\nsensations felt to be located in phantom limbs (K. Baier 1964)? It is\nhard to explain spatial ascription of bodily sensations if bodily\nsensations are not intrinsically spatial. \nAccording to A. D. Smith (2002), perception requires the possibility\nof achieving different perspectives on perceptible objects through\nself-movement. This comes with the existence of perceptual constancies\n(see Burge 2010 for the importance of perceptual constancies).\nHowever, unlike other perceptual objects, the body cannot be felt from\ndifferent perspectives. Smith thus claims that bodily sensations are\nmere sensations; they do not count as perceptual. Likewise, Matthen\n(forthcoming) distinguishes within the sense of touch the tactual\nsensation on one’s skin and the haptic perception of the object.\nThese are two distinct types of experiences and only haptic\nexperiences are truly spatial, and thus truly perceptual. On the\ncontrary, Martin (1992) claims that there is no reason to draw a\ndistinction within tactile experiences: one can simply shift\none’s attention from the bodily side to the exteroceptive side\nof the same perceptual experience (see also O’Shaughnessy 1989).\nNonetheless, according to Martin (1992), touch differs from vision\ninsofar as it has no unified tactile field equivalent to the visual\nfield (see also Richardson 2013; Hopkins 2011). \nA different type of criticism of the perceptual model of bodily\nawareness can be found in Wittgenstein (1978), and later Anscombe\n(1962). They claim that the ability to report how the limbs are\nlocated and how they move does not depend on sensations of position.\nIt thus differs from perceptual knowledge. I know that the sky is blue\nin virtue of having a visual experience of the blueness of the sky but\nI know that my legs are crossed independently of any sensation.\nAccording to Anscombe, bodily knowledge cannot be grounded in\nsensations because only sensations whose content is\n“independently describable” can play an epistemic role.\nThe sense of position is thus what Anscombe calls a kind of knowledge\nwithout observation: “It is without observation, because nothing\nshews him the position of his limbs” (Anscombe 1957: 13). \nThe interpretation of the notion of knowledge without observation has\ngiven rise to many debates. A first concerns Anscombe’s\nepistemological theory. Why do contents have to be independent to\nground judgments? The second problem is that it seems that her\nargument ultimately relies on her phenomenological intuitions:\n“no question of any appearance of the position to me, of any\nsensations which give me the position” (Anscombe 1962). However,\none may question this claim on the basis of bodily illusions (Harcourt\n2008; for a reply, McDowell 2011). For instance, if the tendon of the\nbiceps is vibrated, one can “feel” one’s arm moving\nthough one knows the arm actually remains still. But does that suffice\nto show that the sensation is independently describable? The problem\nis that the notion of independent description is not clear. Why does\n“the visual impression of a blue expanse” (Anscombe 1962:\n57) qualify as independent but not the impression of one’s arm\nmoving? It may sometimes be difficult to see why bodily awareness does\nnot fall into the same category as perceptual awareness. \nInterestingly, both the phenomenological and the analytic traditions\nthat reject the perceptual model emphasize the role of action and\nbodily know-how in their account of bodily awareness. Anscombe\ndescribes knowledge without observation as a form of practical\nknowledge. In a nutshell, knowing that your legs are crossed is not\nfeeling them to be crossed; it is knowing how to uncross them. Along\nthe same lines, Merleau-Ponty claims that the lived body is a space of\npossibilities for actions. There is, however, a major difference. For\nthe phenomenologist tradition, what we feel is determined by\nwhat we know how to do. For Anscombe, on the contrary, we do not feel\nanything. Instead, one should say that what we report is\ndetermined by what we know how to do. Furthermore, the emphasis on\naction does not necessarily entail giving up the perceptual model of\nbodily awareness and one should be careful distinguishing the two\nclaims. \nTwo main sensorimotor views of perceptual awareness have indeed\nrecently been proposed (see Entry on Action-based theories of\nperception). According to the enactive approach, perceptual\nexperiences consist in sensorimotor expectations (O’Regan &\nNoë 2001; Noë 2004; Hurley 1998; Thompson 2005;\nO’Regan 2011). According to the dispositional approach, the\nspatial content of perceptual experiences is made possible by\ndispositions to act (Evans 1982; Brewer 1995; Briscoe 2009; A. J. T.\nSmith 2009; Mandrigin forthcoming). Despite apparent similarities, the\ntwo views make different claims. The enactive view aims to account for\nconsciousness in general, for its phenomenal character (O’Regan\n2011). By contrast, the dispositional account applies only to\negocentric content. Furthermore, the enactive view makes a\nconstitutive claim: bodily experiences are inseparable from\nsensorimotor expectations (for discussion of the constitutive claim,\nsee Block 2005). By contrast, the dispositional view does not claim\nthat the spatial content represents dispositions to act. It only makes\n“a claim about the conditions under which a visual experience\nwill have such content” (Briscoe 2014: 208).  \nA major challenge for the sensorimotor approaches is to account for\ndissociations between perception and action. Such dissociations have\nbeen found for vision, leading Milner and Goodale (1995) to propose\na dual model of visual processing: the ventral pathway is dedicated to\nconscious perception whereas the dorsal pathway is dedicated to\nvisuomotor transformation perception. Dissociations have also been\nreported in the case of bodily awareness. For instance, patients with\nnumbsense have no tactile awareness, but retain a surprising ability\nto point to where they were touched (Paillard et al., 1983; see also\nAnema et al. 2009 for further dissociation). The rubber hand illusion\nas well indicates that bodily know-how can be at odds with bodily\nexperiences: participants accurately grasp the stimulated hand with\ntheir opposite hand at its real location, and not at the illusory\nlocation that they report (Kammers et al. 2009). Proponents of the\nenactive view may have difficulties accounting for this type of\nresults, which indicate that sensorimotor knowledge is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for bodily experiences (Vignemont 2011).\nHowever, perception-action dissociations are less problematic for the\ndispositional view (Mandrigin forthcoming). \nWe have just asked whether bodily awareness requires action. But one\nmay also ask whether action requires bodily awareness\n(O’Shaughnessy 2000; Wong 2015). Action requires detailed\ninformation about the long-term and short-term properties of the\nbodily effectors. But does the information need to reach the threshold\nof awareness, even at the margin? Action requires fast processing of\ninformation, whereas bodily awareness takes time. Furthermore,\ndeafferented subjects who have no kinaesthetic and tactile awareness\nof their body retain their ability to control their movements as long\nas they receive visual feedback. Hence, kinaesthetic experiences do\nnot seem to be necessary for action. The body is not always\nimmediately present in all its details to the subject, even when\nacting. Yet as Descartes pointed out, we are not like pilots in a\nship. The difference is that we are able to feel our ship from the\ninside. Hence, there must still be a connection, still to be explored,\nbetween our capacity to act directly with our body and our capacity to\nfeel our body from the inside (Wong 2015). \nWhen one discusses the relationship between bodily awareness and\naction, one frequently appeals to the notion of body schema.\nIt is used, however, in many different ways. One of the main\ncontroversies is whether it should be conceived as a specific type of\nmental representation of the body. For Merleau-Ponty (1945), and more\nrecently for Gallagher (2008), the body schema should be conceived as\na sensorimotor function, devoid of intentional content. Their\ndefinition is in line with a general trend in the last thirty years\nthat rejects the necessity to posit representations in the\nmind (Gallagher 2008; Thelen & Smith 1994; Turvey & Carello\n1995; van Gelder 1995; Thompson 2005; Zahavi & Parnas 1998). On\nthis view, representations are inadequate because they are too costly\nand they are unnecessary because they can be easily replaced by\nsensorimotor loops. The body ca be conceived as “its own best\nmodel”, to use Brooks’s (1991) expression. If biological\nsystems only know what they need to in order to get their job done\n(Clark 1997), is the body really something that the brain needs to\nrepresent in this sense? All that may be needed is to pay attention to\nit (Kinsbourne 1995; Hochstetter 2016). \nUntil the end of the 19th century, bodily awareness was typically\nunderstood in terms of a bundle of internal bodily sensations. Bonnier\n(1905) first introduced the term schema to refer to the\nspatial organization of these bodily sensations. But it was only in\nHead and Holmes (1911)’s fundamental paper (discussed in the\nnext section) that one finds the first systematic analysis of the\nway(s) the brain represents the body. They initiated what might be\ncalled the representationalist approach to bodily awareness\n(e.g., O’Shaughnessy 1980; Bermúdez 1998; Vignemont\n2018; Carruthers 2008;\nAlsmith forthcoming; Murillo Lara 2018). Proponents of the\nrepresentationalist approach claim that in order to account for bodily\nawareness one needs to appeal to mental representations of the body.\nAccording to a minimal definition, a body representation is an\ninternal structure that has the function to track the state of the\nbody and encode it, that can misrepresent it and that can be decoupled\nfrom it. It plays the role of model that represents in virtue of its\nresemblance to the structure of the body (Alsmith forthcoming; Gadsby\n& Williams 2018). Now the question is why positing such internal\nmodels. \nThe first reason is to account for disturbances in bodily awareness.\nMost of the literature on body representation can be found in patient\nstudies (Head & Holmes 1911; Lhermitte 1942; Cole & Paillard\n1995, Schwoebel & Coslett 2005; Sirigu et al. 1991; Gadsby 2017).\nWith the help of the notion of body representation, and thus of body\nmisrepresentation, one can easily explain how the way the body is\nexperienced can be at odds with the physical reality of the body. On\nthe one hand, amputated patients can still feel the presence of their\nabsent limb because the physically missing limb is still represented.\nOn the other hand, patients with xenomelia can wish their perfectly\nhealthy limbs to be amputated because these limbs are not incorporated\nin their body representation (Hilti & Brugger 2010). \nThe second reason focuses on the spatial organization of bodily\nawareness (Bonnier 1905; O’Shaughnessy 1980, 1995; Murillo Lara 2018).\nOver an extended period, all bodily experiences share the same spatial\ncontent of the structural shape of the body. To account for this\ncommonality, O’Shaughnessy posits the existence of a long-term\nbody image that plays a structural role in spatially shaping bodily\nexperiences. One may then propose a hierarchical model of body\nrepresentations on the model of Marr’s theory of vision: the\nprimal sketch, the 2.5D sketch, and the 3D sketch (Marr 1982). At each\nstep, more information is extracted from the original sensory input\nuntil it switches from a viewer-centered perspective to an\nobject-centered perspective. At each stage, the representation of the\nbody gains in complexity and spatial richness (Longo 2017; Haggard et\nal. 2017). The level of the primary somatosensory area (SI)\ncorresponds to the primal body sketch, which takes the shape of a\n“homunculus” (Penfield & Rasmussen, 1950). Although it\ngenerally follows natural anatomical divisions, associating cortical\nareas to specific parts of the body, some are over-represented (e.g.,\nhand), and others under-represented (e.g., torso). Furthermore, the\nhomunculus does not represent anatomical contiguity (e.g., the\nhand-specific area is next to the face-specific area). Consequently,\nthe primal body sketch cannot play the role of supplying information\nabout body metrics and configuration (Medina & Coslett 2016). This\nis done at a higher level of integration (integration among body parts\nand among multiple sensory sources), at which a kind of 3D body sketch\nis generated. Its function is to reliably covariate with the spatial\norganization and dimensions of the body and its segments, in order to\nspatially organize information coming from the body senses. This level\nof body representation is partly independent from online inputs. \nThe body model thus seems to play an explanatory role. It remains\nunclear, however, what kind of representation it consists in. On one\ninterpretation, it can be conceived as a kind of scenario in\nPeacocke’s (1992) sense. A scenario is a nonconceptual,\nanalogue, unit-free, spatial representation that uses a set of\nlabelled axes in relation to body parts. Peacocke describes scenarios\nthat depict the subject’s environment, but arguably, one can\nhave a scenario that depicts the subject’s body, with similar\nproperties. On another interpretation, it can be conceived as an\naction-orientated representation (Brewer 1995; Bermúdez 2005):\n \nThe intrinsic spatial content of normal bodily awareness is given\ndirectly in terms of practical knowledge how to act in connection with\nthe bodily locations involved. (Brewer 1995: 302) \nNow one may ask whether we have only one model that depicts the whole\nbody or whether it is sufficient to have a collection of local models\n(Alsmith forthcoming). Try, for instance, using a hand to touch your\nfoot whilst using the other to touch your face. To perform this task,\nis it sufficient to have local body models that represent individual\nbody parts? Or do we also need a global body representation whose\nfunction would be to structure these local representations? \nOne may further ask whether one can functionally defined different\ntypes of body representations. One single body representation does not\nseem to suffice to account for the variety of bodily disorders and for\nthe variety of aspects of bodily awareness. There needs to be more,\nbut how many? In 1911, Head and Holmes present the first taxonomy of\nthe representations of the body. In addition to what they call a body\nimage, which constitutes the conscious percept of the body, they\ndistinguish two types of unconscious representations, called body\nschemata: one records every new posture or movement whereas the other\nmaps the surface of the body on which sensations are localized.\nHowever, for a long time, the terms of body schema and body image had\nbeen used interchangeably (see Schilder 1935, for instance), whereas\nthe fine-grained distinction between the two types of body schema had\nalmost completely disappeared. Nonetheless, since the eighties there\nhas been a renewal of interest for distinguishing various types of\nbody representation (O’Shaughnessy 1980; Paillard 1999;\nGallagher 1986), although there is little agreement, neither on the\nway to individuate the distinct types of body representations, nor on\ntheir precise number. Here is a sample of the\ncharacteristics that have been used so far to distinguish them: \nThese distinctions give rise to different taxonomies (e.g., Schwoebel\n& Coslett 2005; Sirigu et al. 1991; Paillard 1999; Dijkerman &\nde Haan 2007; O’Shaughnessy 1980; Gallagher 1995), which\nsometimes lead to opposite interpretations of the very same bodily\ndisorders. For instance, personal neglect (i.e., lack of exploration\nof half of the body) has been interpreted as resulting from a deficit\nof body schema (Coslett 1998), or from a deficit of body image\n(Gallagher 1995).  Furthermore, although most taxonomies rely on\nneuropsychological dissociations, it does not seem likely that they\ncan account for all bodily disorders. Even three types of body\nrepresentation might not suffice to explain all the possible\ndissociations. On the other hand, one may wish to avoid a\nquasi-infinite list of body representations. \nEven the definition of the body schema, which appears the less\ncontroversial notion, often remains vague. The term ‘body\nschema’ functions as a general term that groups together various\nbody representations intervening at different stages in motor control,\nrepresenting short-term or long-term body properties, used for\npositive or negative affordances. It is commonly defined as the representation of the body\nfor action. But many states can contribute to action planning,\nincluding some very high-level states. Imagine for instance that you\nwant to cut a cake into six equal slices. To do so, you can exploit\nyour mathematical knowledge that 360 degrees divided by 6 equals 60\ndegrees. This knowledge can guide your hand while splitting the cake.\nYour ability to do maths can thus play a role in guiding your action,\nbut clearly, the body schema must be more intimately connected to\naction. What makes the body schema so special? The type of information\nthat it represents? The way this information is represented? Or the\nfunction of the representation? Furthermore, the distinction between\nthe body schema and the body image has become the stock in trade of\nmuch recent work in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy. Yet little\nis known about the interactions between these two types of body\nrepresentations (Gadsby 2018; Pitron,\nAlsmith, & Vignemont 2018). In our everyday life the body we\nperceive does not conflict with the body we act with. One needs to\naccount not only for dissociations in rare cases, but also for\nconvergence most of the time. \nAccording to Peacocke (2014, 2017), we must distinguish among three\ndegrees of self-representations: \nTheories of the sense of bodily ownership try to answer the\nfollowing question: how does one go from degree 0 to degree 2, from a\nproprioceptive experience with the nonconceptual content [this leg is\nbent] to a proprioceptive judgment with the conceptual content [my leg\nis bent]? These theories pursue two objectives. First, to avoid\npositing new phenomenal properties unless necessary (Wu forthcoming).\nSecondly, to account for empirical data. On the one hand, the rubber\nhand illusion provides an experimental window in what is required for\none to experience a hand as one’s own. On the other hand, one\nneeds to understand how it is possible for an individual not\nto experience one’s limb as one’s own in disownership\nsyndromes, as in somatoparaphrenia (Romano & Maravita 2019), depersonalization disorder (Billon\n2017), Cotard syndrome (Billon 2015, 2016), and xenomelia (Brugger et\nal. 2013), as well as in chronic pain (Moseley et al. 2012) and\ncomplex post-traumatic disorder (Ataria 2018). The interpretation of\nthese various results, however, is controversial (Alsmith 2015; Wu\nforthcoming; Bradley forthcoming; Chadha 2018), and at most one can\nonly offer an inference to the best explanation. \nThe notion of myness, which can be defined as the de se\nproperty of belonging to the subject, has recently attracted\nincreasing attention in the literature (Guillot 2017; Guillot &\nGarcía-Carpintero forthcoming). The hypothesis then is that one\nexperiences one’s body as one’s own in virtue of having a\nfeeling of myness. Nonconceptual myness content can then provide\nrational ground for conceptual myness content. The myness hypothesis,\nhowever, is not without raising a number of controversies and most\nrecent views have rejected it (Alsmith 2015; Bermúdez 2011;\nChadha 2018; \nMartin 1995; Vignemont 2020; Wu forthcoming). A first worry concerns\nthe origin of myness. Unless one posits myness as an irreducible\nprimitive phenomenal property (Billon 2017), the nonconceptual myness\ncontent itself requires explanation. Another worry is that it does not\nseem salient in our phenomenology. Chadha (2018) argues that by\ndefault, the content of bodily experiences is not self-referential. On\nher view, disownership syndromes do not result from the lack of\nmyness, but from an unusual feeling of the hand not being one's\nown. One may also argue that the feeling of myness is not\ncompatible with a parsimonious conception of the admissible contents\nof perception, according to which only low-level somatosensory\nproperties such as pressure, joint angle, and temperature can be\nrepresented in the content of bodily experiences. Finally,\nBermúdez (2011, 2015, 2018) appeals to Anscombe’s\nargument for knowledge without observation. He argues that one cannot\ngive a separately describable description of the feeling of myness,\nwhich thus cannot constitute a legitimate ground for ownership\njudgments. \nDenying the existence of myness feelings, however, does not entail\ndenying the phenomenology of ownership:  \nownership is phenomenologically salient … when we experience\nour bodies we experience them as our own … there is a\nphenomenology of ownership. (Bermúdez 2015: 38)  \nIn other terms, it makes a phenomenological difference when one is not\naware of one’s body as one’s own and when one is not. The\nquestion then is how to best interpret this phenomenological\ndifference: in sensory terms (Wu forthcoming; Bermúdez 2011;\nMartin 1995; Dokic 2003), in cognitive terms (Alsmith 2015), in\nagentive terms (Peacocke 2017), or in affective terms (Vignemont\n2018). \nAccording to what Bermúdez (2011: 167) calls the deflationary\nconception,  \nthe sense of ownership consists, first, in certain facts about the\nphenomenology of bodily sensations and, second, in certain fairly\nobvious judgments about the body (which we can term judgments of\nownership).  \nLikewise, Martin (1995: 278) states that the sense of ownership is not\nan additional quality to the sensory qualities of bodily experiences\nand that it is “somehow already inherent within them”. For\ninstance, in the rubber hand illusion participants do not report only\nownership towards the rubber hand, but also referred tactile\nsensations on the fake hand. One may then argue that experiencing the\nrubber hand as one’s own is nothing more than feeling sensations\nin it (Wu forthcoming). One intuitive way to spell out the\ndeflationary conception is indeed in spatial terms: “when one\nfeels a bodily sensation to have a location there is no issue over\nwhose body it appears to belong to” (Martin 1992: 201). Martin\nclaims that the spatial phenomenology can account for the sense of\nownership because there is an identity between one’s own body\nand the body in which one locates bodily experiences. According to the\nsole-object view that he defends, for an instance of bodily experience\nto count as an instance of perception, it must indeed be an experience\nof what is in fact the subject’s actual body. However, one can\nbe aware of the boundaries of one’s body without being aware of\nthe boundaries of one’s body qua one’s own (Dokic\n2003; Serrahima forthcoming). A further problem for all\ndeflationary conceptions comes from dissociation between bodily\nsensations and the sense of ownership. They indeed\npredict that it is inconceivable for one to experience sensations in a\nlimb and fail to experience this limb as one’s own (Martin 1995;\nDokic 2003). However, it has been found that patients with\ndisownership syndromes can still experience some bodily experiences\n(e.g., Moro et al. 2004). The question then is whether this type of results can\ninvalidate the deflationary conception or not (Bradley\nforthcoming). \nInstead of appealing to the way one perceives one’s\nbody, one can appeal to the way one thinks about one’s\nbody in order to account for the sense of ownership:  \nA cognitive account of the sense of ownership holds that one\nexperiences something as one’s own only if one thinks of\nsomething as one’s own. (Alsmith 2015: 881)  \nThe cognitive conception does not preclude the existence of a\nphenomenology of ownership, at least if one grants the possibility of\ncognitive phenomenology (as in noetic feelings, for instance). \nThe question then is how to account for the fact that the sense of\nownership (or its lack) is cognitively impenetrable. Participants in\nthe rubber hand experiment are aware that the rubber hand is a fake\nhand and they rarely endorse the belief that the rubber hand is their\nown hand. Vice-versa: some patients know that their hand belongs to\nthem, and yet it still seems to them as if it did not, as\ndescribed by this patient: ‘my eyes and my feelings don’t\nagree, and I must believe my feelings. I know they look like mine, but\nI can feel they are not, and I can’t believe my eyes’\n(Nielsen 1938: 555). Cognitive impenetrability is classically taken as\nthe signature of experiential states. For instance, in the\nMüller-Lyer illusion one cannot help but experience the two lines\nas being different despite having the belief that they are actually of\nthe same size. However, there are attitudes other than feelings and\nsensations that can be immune to the influence of beliefs (McDowell\n2011). The question then is what kind of attitude: propositional\nimagination (Alsmith 2015), agreement towards a proposition (Wu\nforthcoming), perceptual seeming (Lyons 2011), or alief (Gendler\n2008). Whatever attitude it may be, it will have to be not only\ncognitive impenetrable, but also beyond the subject’s control.\nSubjects cannot decide at will to experience the rubber hand illusion.\nIn the case of disownership syndromes, it also seems that the attitude\nthey are in should be affectively-loaded. Patients indeed are greatly\ndistressed when they report that they do not feel their hand as their\nown. \nMany theories appeal to the notion of action in relation to the sense\nof ownership, and even more to the sense of disownership. The fact is\nthat disownership syndromes often involve some more or less extreme\nmotor impairment. Most somatoparaphrenic patients are paralyzed, and\nthose who are not suffer from the Anarchic hand sign (that is, they\ncannot control their limb, which seems to have a will of its own).\nPatients frequently complain about the uselessness of their\n‘alien’ limb. There are then several ways the agentive\nconception has been spelled out: in terms of body schema (Vignemont\n2007), agentive feelings (B. Baier & Karnath 2008), or general\nagentive ability (Peacocke 2017). The challenge that the various\nversions face is that the sense of bodily ownership can be preserved\nin patients who are paralyzed or who have lost the awareness of their\nactions as their own. For example, anarchic patients report that they\nhave no control over their limbs but they still claim that their limbs\nbelong to them (Marchetti & Della Salla 1998). The rubber hand\nillusion is also difficult to account for agentive conceptions. It has\nbeen shown that there is no agentive contrast between synchronous and\nasynchronous conditions, not only at the phenomenological level\n(subjects report no agentive feelings toward the rubber hand, Longo et\nal. 2008), but also at the sensorimotor level (the way they perform\ntheir movements is not altered by the illusion, Kammers et al. 2009).\nPeacocke’s (2017) agency-involving account may then seem the\nmost promising because it appeals to the notion of action at a\nrelatively high level of generality. On his view (Peacocke 2017: 293),\na subject can experience that this is her own hand if and only if: \nParalyzed patients still know what it is like to act and that should\nbe sufficient for them to still feel their inert limbs as their own\n(Peacocke 2019). One might also say that in the rubber hand illusion,\nparticipants know what it is like to act with a hand in general\nalthough they do not feel they could act with this specific rubber\nhand. However, this account puts so few constraints on what it\ntakes to experience one’s body as one’s own, that one may\nwonder how it is even possible to lose the sense of bodily ownership.\nWhat is the agency-involving difference between the paralyzed patients\nwho deny ownership and those who do not?  \nThese last 20 years have seen an explosion of experimental work on\ninteroception. Recent accounts of interoception have highlighted its\nrole for self- awareness, positing it at the core of what is sometimes\ncalled the “sentient self” (Craig 2003), the “proto-\nself” (Damasio 1999), the “embodied self” (Seth\n2013), or the “material me” (Tsakiris 2017). Even\nDescartes in his Meditations on First Philosophy take\ninteroceptive feelings to be the key for our unique relationship with\nour body:  \nNature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger,\nthirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a\nvessel. (Descartes 1641 [2016] Meditation VI, p. 56)  \nHowever, even if interoception can ground some notion of the self, it\nis not clear that it is specifically involved in the sense of bodily\nownership. Imagine a creature that only receives interoceptive\nsignals. It receives information about its body, and its body only.\nBut there is a difference between self-specificity (information\nexclusively about the body that happens to be one’s own) and\nself-reference (awareness of the body qua one’s own).\nThe problem is that on the basis of interoception only, there is no\nneed to discriminate the inside from the outside since the body is\nonly an inside. It is so fixated on its own body that it can dispense\nwith representing whose body is hungry or thirsty. The fact is that\none usually says “I am thirsty”, without any reference to\nbodily ownership, let alone to the body. \nThere is, however, another way to spell out the affective conception\nwithout appealing to interoception. Instead it appeals to the notion\nof affective significance (Vignemont 2018). On what is called the Bodyguard hypothesis, there is a\nspecific affective phenomenology that goes over and above the sensory\nphenomenology of bodily experiences. It expresses the unique value of\nthe body for the self, a value that is evolutionarily rooted. In\nbrief, survival involves preservation of one’s body. The sense\nof ownership then individuates the one body that matters to the\nsubject for self-preservation more than anything else. In line with\nthis view, it has been found that participants who report ownership\nfor the rubber hand display an increase of arousal when the rubber\nhand is under threat (Ehrsson et al. 2007). Vice-versa, patients with\nsomatoparaphrenia show no increase in arousal when they see the hand\nthat they felt as alien under threat (Romano et al. 2014). \nOne may object that evolutionary significance is only a consequence of\nthe fact of bodily ownership: this body matters because it is mine.\nConsequently, affective phenomenology should be just the consequence\nof the sense of bodily ownership: I feel that this body matters\nbecause I am aware that it is mine. However, one may reply that what\nhappens to the body that has this significance happens to me. Why is\nit so? One possibility is that it is because I am my body or more\nsimply because we evolved in a world such that for the self to\nsurvive, its body must survive. Hence, for my body to have such\nsignificance is for it to be the body to protect for the\norganism’s evolutionary needs. Biology here provides an\nindependent ground to the notion of significance. The impact on what\nhappens on this body for oneself gives immediate ground for labeling\nit as one’s own. Hence, one is entitled to judge that this is\none’s own body when one feels that this body matters in this\nspecial way, because under normal circumstances the body that matters\nin such a way is one’s own body. \nBodily awareness reveals a new rich territory for philosophical\nexploration in its own right, but it also provides a new approach to\ngeneral issues of perception, action, self and space. Empirical\nresearch on body representations, bodily sensations, bodily illusions,\nand self-awareness has grown exponentially. A comprehensive\nunderstanding of bodily awareness will likely require taking on board\nits insights.","contact.mail":"frederique.de.vignemont@ens.fr","contact.domain":"ens.fr"}]
