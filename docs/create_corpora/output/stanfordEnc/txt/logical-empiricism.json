It had several\ndifferent leaders whose views changed considerably over\ntime. Moreover, these thinkers differed from one another, often\nsharply.  Because logical empiricism is here construed as a movement\nrather than as doctrine, there is probably no important position that\nall logical empiricists shared—including, surprisingly enough,\nempiricism.  And while most participants in the movement were\nempiricists of one form or another, they disagreed on what the best\nform of empiricism was and on the cognitive status of empiricism. What\nheld the group together was a common concern for scientific\nmethodology and the important role that science could play in\nreshaping society. Within that scientific methodology the logical\nempiricists wanted to find a natural and important role for logic and\nmathematics and to find an understanding of philosophy according to\nwhich it was part of the scientific enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe following discussion of logical empiricism is organized under five\nheadings:\n\n\n\nThe term ‘logical empiricism’ has no very precise\nboundaries and still less that distinguishes it from ‘logical\npositivism’. It is therefore hard to map.\n‘Logical empiricism’  here  includes  \nthree groups: (1) the Vienna Circle, here taken broadly to include\nthose who were part of various private discussion groups, especially\nthat around Moritz Schlick, and also the members of the more public\nErnst Mach Society (Verein Ernst Mach), (2) the smaller, but perhaps\nmore influential Berlin Society for Empirical Philosophy (later called\nthe Berlin Society for Scientific Philosophy), and (3) those \ninfluenced by or who interacted with members of the first two groups and\nshared an  intellectual kinship with them. Besides \nVienna and Berlin, there were important centers of the movement in\nEngland, France, Scandinavia, at several universities in the U.S., and even\n China. This characterization \n includes thinkers who disagreed with doctrines\nespoused by members of the original groups and even some who defined\nthemselves in opposition to the movement. This results in a vague\nboundary, but it suffices to identify a movement in which a large\nnumber of able philosophers self-consciously participated and to\ndistinguish logical empiricism from other movements. \n\nIt does not, however, distinguish logical empiricism from logical\npositivism, and it is doubtful that any principled such boundary can be\ndrawn along doctrinal or sociological lines (Uebel 2013). Usually when distinctions are drawn, ‘logical empiricism’ is\nthe wider term. Members of the Berlin group never used the term\n‘positivism’ about themselves, but did use it concerning\nsome unnamed Viennese in stressing their differences from the\nlatter. In any case, these differences, even if real, were\nsmaller than the differences within the Vienna Circle on one hand or\nwithin the Berlin group on the other. ‘Positivist’ is\na term usually applied by opponents of various\ndoctrines. It was used by some of the Viennese logical\nempiricists about themselves but generally with caution and in\nstressing the differences between their own views and those of the\n19th century positivists. The one philosopher who\nwould have unhesitatingly described himself as (having been) a logical\npositivist was A.J. Ayer. \n\nAnother way of mapping the boundaries of logical empiricism is to list\nthe specific philosophers who were centrally or peripherally part of\nit. This included many of the most important philosophers of the\nmid-twentieth century. \n Hans Hahn, Moritz\nSchlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Otto Neurath were leaders of the Vienna\nCircle, and Kurt Gödel regularly attended its meetings. The\nlist of its members, visitors, and interlocutors is staggering, including\n A.J. Ayer, Herbert Feigl, Philipp\nFrank, Hans Hahn, Carl Hempel, Karl Menger, Richard von Mises, Ernest\nNagel, Karl Popper, W.V. Quine, Frank Ramsay, Hans Reichenbach, Alfred\nTarski, Friedrich Waismann, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, among many others. Not all of\nthese would admit to being part of the logical empiricist movement, of\ncourse, but a case can be made that all contributed to it. The\nBerlin Society for Empirical (or Scientific) Philosophy was, as stated,\nsmaller but perhaps more influential. Led by Hans Reichenbach, it\nincluded Kurt Grelling, Walter Dubislav, Kurt Lewin,\nRichard von Mises, Paul Oppenheim, and others. Hempel took his doctorate\nin Berlin, working with Reichenbach until the latter was forced\nto leave in 1933. Hempel also spent time in Vienna and Prague. Of course, among the foremost associates of the Berlin\nSociety was Albert Einstein, who was also in Berlin also until\n1933. \n\nThere was also an important group of logicians in Warsaw of which\nAlfred Tarski is the best known. Tarski interacted significantly\nwith the logical empiricists in Vienna, Berlin, and the U.S., but it is\nmore reasonable to classify the Polish logicians as an allied group\nrather than include them within the logical empiricist movement. \n\nBecause of the catastrophic dislocations of Europe in the 1930s, the\nmain focus of the logical empiricism moved from central Europe to\nAmerica by the close of that decade. Erkenntnis, the main\njournal of the movement, which had been edited by Reichenbach and\nCarnap, ceased publication by 1940. In 1930 Feigl moved to the\nU.S., and Carnap moved to Chicago in 1936. Hempel came to Chicago\nand Menger to Notre Dame in 1937. The ensuing years witnessed a\nmassive exodus to America from central Europe. Reichenbach\narrived in the U.S. in 1938 after five years in Turkey.\nAlso in 1938 Gustav Bergmann and Philipp Frank emigrated. Edgar\nZilsel came in 1939. Alfred Tarski was on a visit to the U.S.\nwhen Poland was invaded in 1939, and so he stayed. And by 1940 Richard\nvon Mises was also in America. \n\nIn the U.S., these exiles were joined by the Americans Nelson\nGoodman, Charles Morris, W.V. Quine, Ernest Nagel, and, after the war,\nby Reichenbach’s UCLA students Hilary Putnam and Wesley\nSalmon. Adolf Grünbaum can also be considered as clearly in\nthe Reichenbach lineage. And Wilfrid Sellars was, in his early\nyears, a close associate of Feigl. The American incarnation of\nthe logical empiricist movement enjoyed generally good relations with\nthe American pragmatists, not only because many of the logical\nempiricists had a strong pragmatist component to their philosophy, but\nalso because the pragmatists and logical empiricists shared a common\nconcern for empirical methodology in the service of social\nreform. Institutionally, the movement was represented in most\nmajor American universities, and such journals as Philosophy of\nScience (with Carnap and Feigl on the Editorial Board and\nReichenbach and Schlick on the Advisory Board) and Philosophical\nStudies (founded and edited for many years by Feigl and Sellars)\nprovided ample outlet for their publications. In addition, the\nInter-Scientific Discussion Group was founded by Philipp Frank at\nHarvard. That grew into the Institute for the Unity of Science,\ncalled by some the Vienna Circle in exile. Meanwhile in Chicago\nthe Encyclopedia of Unified Science was established with\nNeurath, Carnap, and Morris as its editors. \n\nBut even from late 30s onward the movement was hardly limited to\nAmerica. Ayer remained in England. Wittgenstein returned to\nCambridge in 1929, but with regular visits to Vienna, including those\non which he discussed issues surrounding a strong version of\nverificationism with Schlick and Waismann. Popper fled to New\nZealand in 1937, and in 1946 moved to the London School of\nEconomics. Neurath fled from Vienna to the Hague and then again\nin 1940 to England, where he remained till his death in 1945.\nFriedrich Waismann went to England in 1937. In 1939 Rose Rand, a\nless well-known member of the Vienna Circle, fled to England and then\nin 1954 emigrated once more to the U.S. There were\nlike-minded thinkers in Scandinavia (such as Jørgen\nJørgensen, Eino Kaila, and Arne Naess) and as far away as\nArgentina (H.A. Lindemann) and China (Tscha Hung). \n\nIt is impossible to say when logical empiricism ceased to be\nsufficiently cohesive to be identifiable as a continuing\nmovement. Certainly by 1960 a great many philosophers, including many\nwho had earlier clearly been part of the movement, were identifying\nthemselves in opposition to what they took to be logical\nempiricism. And some members simply changed their minds or pursued\ndifferent projects. Logical empiricism probably never commanded the\nassent of the majority of philosophers in either Europe or America,\nand by 1970 the movement was pretty clearly over—though with\nlasting influence whether recognized or not. In the 1980s there was a\nresurgence of historical interest in logical empiricism. That\nhistorical interest continues to clear away many of the caricatures\nand misconceptions about the logical empiricists. Among the major\nresults of this work is the recognition of the tremendous variety and\nsubtlety of views represented within the movement and the fact that\nmany of the arguments later deployed by critics of logical empiricism\nhad been pioneered by the logical empiricists themselves. \n\nGiven the emphasis on science and its technical apparatus, social\nrenewal, clarity and rationality of belief, functionality, and above\nall the palpable sense of doing philosophy in an importantly new way,\nit is reasonable to associate logical empiricism with other forms of\nEuropean modernism in the 1920s and 30s, such as Neue Sachlichkeit in\nart and the Bauhaus in architecture and design, and with mid-century\nmodernism as well as with political liberalism, from the New Deal to\nthe Great Society in the United States. There have been\nrecognizably modernist developments in various fields including\nphilosophy for centuries. \n\nWith a movement as large and complex as logical empiricism a great many\nfactors went into raising the questions it would address, making them\nseem urgent, and making it seem as though the intellectual resources it\nwould need to address these questions were either at hand or could be\ndeveloped. \n\nOne long-term process with profound implications was the steady\ndeparture of the various sciences from philosophy to form autonomous\ndisciplines. By early in the twentieth century mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, biology, and the social sciences were all pursued\nprofessionally and independently from philosophy. And psychology\nwas just separating from philosophy.\n Yes, there were polymaths who could and did pursue a science\nand philosophy professionally. Those were increasingly rare, though\nsingle-discipline scientists did from time to time make\nphilosophic-seeming pronouncements. But they did so from outside\nthe field. This pattern of steady departures raised the pressing\nquestion: What sort of thing remained behind? Once mathematics\nand the empirical sciences all left, what was left for philosophy? \n\nThe nature of philosophy was always a vexed philosophic question, but\nnow it was particularly insistent. Surely there was no domain of\nempirical facts that philosophy could call its own. All that real\nestate had been parceled out. One answer available at\nthe time that logical empiricism flourished was that the genuinely\nphilosophic remainder after the departure of the sciences is somehow\ndeeper than the empirical sciences and gets at matters, perhaps\ncultural ones, that are more profound and important than anything that\nempirical science even can address. This is either because on\nthis conception philosophy has a mode of access or\n“evidence” that the empirical sciences do not and cannot\nhave, or because the very idea of fidelity to evidence and punctilious\nargument is somehow small-minded. \n\nThe logical empiricists found this answer unappealing. Indeed, this\nconception of philosophy is precisely what Carnap means by\n‘metaphysics’. (As a consequence, what Carnap meant by\nthat word is different from what late twentieth and early twenty-first\ncentury philosophers generally mean in describing their own work as\nanalytic metaphysics.) The logical empiricists were eager to conceive\nof their enterprise as scientific and to engage in philosophy only\ninsofar as it was also scientific. This science need not be\nempirical and need not include all that was traditional in\nphilosophy that had not been incorporated into the independent\nsciences. The decision to be scientific can hardly be the end of the\nstory. It requires rather better and more detailed answers to\nquestions about what scientific methods are, how the mathematical (and\nother apparently non-empirical sciences) fit together with the\nempirical ones, and what, more precisely, philosophy’s role was. \n\n A\nsecond series of developments that raised questions for logical\nempiricism to address were developments in the sciences themselves,\nespecially the rise of non-Euclidean geometries in mathematics and the\nestablishment of relativity theory in physics. These posed a\nserious challenge to what would otherwise be an attractive scientific\nphilosophy, namely some version of Kantianism. Kant had\nrecognized that the best of modern science was often mathematical in\ncharacter and had labored to integrate both geometry and arithmetic\ninto our empirical picture of the world. He had held that we\ncould not represent the world except as a Euclidean structure and hence\nEuclidean geometry was, a priori, a permanent feature of any future\nphysics. The demonstration that non-Euclidean pure\ngeometrical structures were as consistent as Euclidean ones and that\nspaces can indeed be represented as a non-Euclidean manifolds was one\nhalf of the problem. The other half came when Einstein argued\nconvincingly that physical space was best described as a non-Euclidean\nmanifold of non-constant curvature. Plainly Euclidean geometry\ncould not be guaranteed a future physics. Modern mathematical\nlogic also posed a problem for other Kantian claims, but not in the\nsame wrenching way. \n\nMany logical empiricists started out as neo-Kantians: Reichenbach,\nCarnap, Schlick, and even Hempel (until he studied with Reichenbach,\nwho by that time had revised his view). The difficulties with\ngeometry and relativity certainly do not refute all forms of\nneo-Kantianism, but the difficulties are quite real nonetheless. The\nneed is to understand how mathematics can be integrated into what is\notherwise an empirical enterprise, i.e., physics, chemistry, biology,\netc. Addressing this need was to be a major part of the logical\nempiricist program. \n\nThe background of logical empiricism described so far has been confined\nto the academic world, but events outside that domain shaped the\nmovement as well. World War I was an unmitigated disaster for\ncentral Europe, followed by economic turmoil in the 20s\nand political upheavals of the 30s. It is hard to exaggerate\nthese changes. Monarchies that had stood for centuries\ndisappeared overnight and their empires disintegrated. This level\nof political convulsion had not been seen since the French Revolution,\nand that earlier upheaval was comparatively confined. Cultural\nchanges were equally profound, and these were reflected by radical\ndepartures in the arts such as painting, music, and architecture, and\neven more importantly in new modes of living. \n\nThe logical empiricists were no mere bystanders.  They, or\nat least the main leaders of the movement, were politically and\nculturally engaged. Even more important, this engagement was\naccompanied by the conviction that their cultures were incapable of the\nnecessary reform and renewal because people were in effect enslaved by\nunscientific, metaphysical ways of thinking. Such ways of\nthinking might be exemplified in theology, in the racial hatreds of the\nday, in conceptions of property, and in traditional ideas about the\n“proper” roles of men and women in society. So to\narticulate a “scientific world conception” and to defend it\nagainst metaphysics was not just to express an academic position in the\nnarrow sense. It was a political act as well; it was to strike a\nblow for the liberation of the mind. To articulate scientific\nmethods and a scientific conception of philosophy was the essential\nfirst step in the reform of society and in the emancipation of\nhumankind (Carnap 1958/2017, Creath 2009, Uebel 2012. \n\nIf all of this sounds like something out of the 18th century\nEnlightenment, the analogy was not lost on the logical empiricists\nthemselves. André Carus has argued that this is\nexactly what Carnap had in mind by “explication” (Carus\n2007). Neurath frequently drew parallels between the logical\nempiricists’ anti-metaphysical program and the earlier\nEnlightenment ambitions. Certainly Kant had inveighed against the\nmetaphysics of his time, and the anti-metaphysical tradition remained\nstrong within the scientific community through the 19th\ncentury. \n\nThe point so far was not to ask whether the logical empiricists were\nright in any of this. That question will come up later. So far the\nissue has been only to see the motivations that the logical\nempiricists had—and from their point of view—for\naddressing certain questions and for thinking that answers to those\nquestions were urgently needed. None of this, however, says why the\nlogical empiricists thought they had or could have the means to answer\nthese questions. To that we now turn. \n\nSince Newton the most paradigmatic examples of empirical science were\nthose claims, usually quantitative ones, that were properly inferred\nfrom or appropriately confirmed by experience. Speaking very\ninformally, these are the ones that we have good reason to believe or\nat least better reason to believe than the available\nalternatives. The problem, of course, is to specify the form of\nproper inferences, the form of an appropriate confirmation relation,\nand/or the structure of good reasons. The task is daunting, but\nlogic in a suitably broad sense seems to be the right tool. Still\nspeaking informally, logic seems to give us the structure of (good)\nreasoning. There are other conceptions of logic, of course, but\nthis is a standard one and pretty well describes what the movement\nneeded. \n\nIf logic was the tool that was wanted, it was newly ready for\nservice. The progress of modern mathematical logic from Bolzano\nthrough Russell and beyond was truly impressive. Arguably, it\ncould now express all parts of classical mathematics. Besides the\nfirst order predicate calculus one would need either set theory or\nhigher order logic, but these were recent developments as well.\nLogic, like the empirical sciences, was progressive and could be\napproached cooperatively by more than one investigator. In\nOur Knowledge of the External World (1914) Russell had even\npositioned logic as the locus of scientific method in\nphilosophy. It is small wonder then that those who were looking\nfor something scientific in what was left of philosophy turned to\nlogic. Wittgenstein’s no-content theory of logic in the\nTractatus (1921/1922) was tantalizingly suggestive about how\nmathematics could be integrated into an overall empirical theory of the\nworld. Wittgenstein also expressed a radical verificationism in\nthe early 1930s in his conversations with Schlick, Waismann, and other\nmembers of the Vienna Circle. Many of the logical empiricists in\nturn could see in some version of that verificationism the ideal tool\nwith which to carry out their anti-metaphysical program. There\nwas, naturally, much left to accomplish, but even with\nGödel’s results one could expect that further impressive\nstrides in logic could be made. Indeed, much was accomplished\neven if the perfect account of scientific reasoning proved\nelusive. Perfection is elusive in all the sciences, but that is\nno reason for despair. \n\nThe logical empiricist movement is the sum of the interwoven\ntrajectories of its members, so one way of describing that movement is\nto trace those various trajectories. To do so in detail for all\nthose involved would take rather longer than the movement lasted.\nThat would be inappropriate for one entry in an encyclopedia,\nespecially one in which entries for many of the members will appear\nindependently. The thumbnail sketches of the work of some\nrepresentative figures below show the breadth and international\ncharacter of the movement. While the list is long, it covers only\na small fraction of those involved and leaves out many important\nthinkers. \n\nIt is not possible in an essay of this scope to trace all the\nissues that the logical empiricists addressed or even to treat any one\nof them with completeness. What is possible is to highlight some\nsalient issues, clear away some misconceptions about them, and\nsketch a bit how those issues were developed over time. The first\nis a related set of concerns: empiricism, verificationism, and\nanti-metaphysics. The second is the logical empiricists’\ntreatment of logic and mathematics as analytic. Third is the\nrelated issues of the unity of science and reduction. And\nfinally, comes the issue of probability. Given what has already\nbeen said, the reader should be aware that none of the doctrines\ndiscussed below was shared by all members of the logical empiricist\nmovement. \n\nSince antiquity the idea that natural science rests importantly on\nexperience has been non-controversial. The only real questions about\nthe sources of scientific knowledge are: Are there parts of\nscience that do not rest on experience or rest also on something other\nthan experience? If so what account can we give of those\nparts? And to the extent that science does rest on experience how\ncan we know that it does? There is another question about science\nrelated to these, though not strictly about the sources of science, and\nthat is: Why, in making claims about the world, should we be scientific\nas opposed to say mystical? The difficulty is that any scientific\nanswer to this last question would reasonably be thought to beg the\nvery question it purports to address. \n\nLong before the twentieth century the prevailing opinion was that\nEuclidean geometry, standard mathematics, and logic did not rest on\nexperience in any obvious way. They were largely presupposed in\nour empirical work, and it was difficult to see what if anything might\ndisconfirm them. Geometry was a special case and might be handled\nin different ways that we shall not discuss here. That leaves\nlogic and mathematics. \n\nIf Frege and Russell were right, then mathematics could be thought\nof as expressing no more than logical truths and handled in whatever\nway logic was to be treated. For Frege both mathematics and logic\nwere analytic, but that, even if true, does not provide the needed\nanswers. Wittgenstein’s no-content theory of logic\nsuggested that all of the real claims, the ones that had genuine\ncontent, could be appropriately supported by experience, and the\nlogical and hence mathematical claims had no content to support.\nThis seemed to open the way for a thoroughgoing empiricism in\nwhich the logical and mathematical fit in with the ordinary claims of\nphysics and biology in a harmonious way. The next subsection\nabout analyticity discusses the question of whether the needed\ndistinctions can be drawn. \n\nIn developing his theory of types Russell said in effect that some\nexpressions that seem to be sentences in fact say nothing at all.\nThis is because, despite appearances, they are not grammatically well\nformed. Wittgenstein found this suggestive. In the\nTractatus he suggested that much else was nonsense as well\nincluding traditional metaphysics and supposed claims about the\n“higher”. When in late 1929 Wittgenstein\nproposed (Waismann 1967/1979), in conversations with Schlick and\nWaismann, a strict verificationism as a basis for identifying the\nlegitimate parts of discourse, this seemed to the logical\nempiricists to be a very attractive tool for setting aside the\nunscientific parts of philosophy. \n\nThis does not mean, however, that all logical empiricists or even\nall members of the Vienna Circle accepted the strict verificationist\nview that in order to be meaningful a claim must be implied by a finite\nnumber of observation sentences. Even though those observation\nsentences need not be true, this view had the drawback that so-called\nlaws of nature would not be meaningful on this criterion. Schlick\nwas prepared to bite the bullet and hold that laws were not statements\nat all but principles of inference. Others were not prepared to\ngo so far and sought more liberal formulations. This more liberal or\n“left” wing of the Vienna Circle included Carnap, Philipp\nFrank, Hahn, and Neurath. Carnap does not seem to have been a\nstrict verificationist even in the Aufbau (1928/1967). \n\nOver the years a great many different formulations of verificationist\nprinciples ensued. Most of them came to a bad end rather quickly,\nand this is sometimes taken as a convincing argument that any form of\nverificationism is utterly misguided. Perhaps, but we should be\ncautious. There are undoubtedly many different features joined in\nany one of the proposals, and even a sequence of failures may not show\nwhere to place the blame. The central idea behind verificationism\nis linking some sort of meaningfulness with (in principle)\nconfirmation, at least for synthetic sentences. The actual\nformulations embodied not only such a link but various particular\naccounts of confirmation as well. Now confirmation is a complex\nmatter, and it is unlikely that we shall have the final satisfactory\naccount any time soon. This should not persuade us, however, that\nthere are no satisfactory accounts of confirmation any more than our\ncurrent lack of the final physics should convince us that there are no\nphysical facts of the matter. So even a string of failures in\nformulating verificationist principles may mean no more than that the\nembedded accounts of confirmation are too simple but the link between\nmeaningfulness and confirmation is nevertheless sound. \n\nEven if we set this caution aside, there may be parts of\npersistently employed strategy that lead to persistent failure.\nThese parts and failures might be avoidable. To see how this may\nbe so we will compare what is perhaps the most famous formulation of\nthe verificationist principle, in Ayer 1936, with a later one, in\nCarnap 1956. A.J. Ayer had visited the Vienna Circle from late\n1932 on into 1933, returning home for the summer term. While in\nVienna he attended meetings of the Circle and overlapped for five weeks\nwith Quine. Neither Carnap nor Neurath were there at the time, so\nthe left wing of the Circle was not fully represented. When Ayer\nreturned to England he published Language, Truth, and Logic in\n1936. Even immediately it was widely discussed, and after the war\nsales were spectacular. For many in England this book was the\nepitome of logical positivism and remains so. \n\nAyer was careful to restrict his criterion of meaningfulness to synthetic sentences and\nto demand only in principle confirmation. And the formulation seems\nvery natural: Confirmation is a feature that applies to sentences (or\ngroups of them) and not to sub-sentential parts, and for an empiricist\nthe content that a synthetic sentence has would be empirical\ncontent. So it would seem that to have empirical content a\nsentence, A, should either directly imply some observational\nsentence or add to the observational content of some other sentence,\nB. That is, the conjunction of A and B\nshould imply some observational sentence not implied by B\nalone. This formulation may be natural, but it is also fatally\nflawed. It would declare any sentence whatsoever as meaningful: For\nany sentence A and any observation\nsentence O, A would be meaningful because it could\nbe conjoined to A ⊃ O. The latter would not in\ngeneral imply O, but the conjunction would. \n\nOther more elaborate formulations followed along the same lines, and\nother more elaborate counterexamples appeared just as fast.\nHempel reviewed the situation twice within about a year (Hempel 1950\nand 1951). First he concluded that it was a lively and promising\nline of research and later concluded that it was not promising at\nall. In retrospect it may be that the problems arise because we\nwere led by the fact that confirmation is a feature that applies to\nwhole sentences into thinking that the level at which to apply the\ncriterion was the level of whole sentences. Now a sentence with\nmeaningless parts might well pass some test especially if the test\ninvolves its being combined with other sentences that can have\nmeaningless parts. So one way to avoid this difficulty is to try\nto find a formulation that applies the test at the level of basic\nexpressions, those that can be thought of as “not having\nparts” so to speak. \n\nThis is the strategy that Carnap employed in “The Methodological\nCharacter of Theoretical Concepts” (1956).  Observational terms\nare assumed to have empirical content.  Logical terms are assumed to\nhave none. And all defined terms are assumed to be replaced by their\ndefinitions. If for some basic, non-logical term there is a sentence\nthat contains that term as its only non-logical element and if that\nsentence implies some observation sentence, then that sentence has\nempirical content and so does its only non-logical term. If we have\nestablished that each term from some set, K, is empirically\nsignificant we might test still further terms by seeing whether those\nfurther terms can add to what is sayable with terms\nfrom K. Carnap’s actual definition is quite complicated, but\nit does seem to avoid the difficulties of its predecessors. It also\nallows an account of why those predecessors ran into trouble, viz., that they\napplied at the level of whole sentences (naturally enough) rather than\nto elementary terms. \n\nNot long after Carnap’s definition was published David Kaplan\ndevised what seemed to be counterexamples. They became fairly\nwell known, but they were not published until 1975. Shortly\nthereafter it was shown (Creath 1976) that either Carnap’s\ndefinition is not open to the counterexamples as presented or it can be\npatched in a very natural way so that it avoids them. This does\nnot show that there are no counterexamples or that there are no other\nfeatures of the definition to which one might object. But it does\nshow that the situation is not as dire as Hempel supposed in 1951. \nWe need to address another issue in considering\nverificationism, the persistent criticism that it is\nself-undercutting. The argument for this claim goes like\nthis: The principle claims that every meaningful sentence is\neither analytic or verifiable. Well, the principle itself is\nsurely not analytic; we understand the meanings of the words in it\nperfectly well because we understand our own language. And we\nstill do not think it true, so it cannot be true in virtue of\nmeaning. And it is not verifiable either (whatever we choose\n‘verifiable’ to mean). \n\nThis sounds more compelling than it is. Ayer understood the\nprinciple to be a definition, defining a technical term,\n‘meaning’. If so, then the sentence expressing the\nprinciple would indeed be analytic. So the self-undercutting\ncharge strictly fails. But so construed and with nothing else\nsaid about it the principle would not have the same punch as\nbefore. Why should a metaphysician care whether his or her\nutterances lack some technical feature? \n\nCarnap explicitly takes up the “self-undercutting”\ncharge against verifiability in Philosophy and Logical Syntax\n(1935), and he is not interested in introducing a new technical\nterm, ‘meaning’, so or in denying this new  technical property to\nunverifiable sentences. Carnap is careful to distinguish the\nlanguage for which the verifiability principle is given from the\nmeta-language in which we talk about that language. This\nmeta-language would be the language in which the principle would be\nexpressed. This may seem to offer another strategy against the\n“self-undercutting” charge because the principle applies to\na different language than that in which it is expressed. This is not\nCarnap’s strategy. Carnap fully understands that if the\ngeneral verificationist strategy is followed, there will also be a\nverificationist principle expressed in the meta-meta-language governing\nthe meta-language. \n\nCarnap’s real defense of the principle was achieved by changing the\nnature of the discussion. By 1935 Carnap had introduced an important\nnew element into his philosophy called the Principle of\nTolerance. Tolerance is a radical idea. There is no uniquely correct\nlogic (1934/1937 xiv–xv). Empiricism is a convention (Carnap,\n1936/1937 33). Perhaps more precisely each of the various versions of\nempiricism (including some sort of verificationism) is best understood\nas a proposal for structuring the language of science. Before\ntolerance, both empiricism and verificationism are announced as if\nthey are simply correct. Correspondingly, what Carnap called\nmetaphysics is then treated as though it is, as a matter of brute\nfact, unintelligible.  But what is announced thus dogmatically can be\nrejected equally dogmatically. Once tolerance is in place, alternative\nphilosophic positions, including metaphysical ones, are construed as\nalternative proposals for structuring the language of science. \n\nNone of them is the uniquely correct one, and no theoretical\nargument or evidence can show that it is. Nor can theoretical\narguments or evidence show that it is false. Neither proposals\nnor languages are the sort of thing to be true or false. Instead,\nproposals call for practical decisions and practical arguments rather\nthan for theoretical reasons or evidence. Carnap believes that\nthere are indeed very good practical reasons for adopting the proposal\nof verificationism, for choosing a language of science in which all\nsubstantive (synthetic) claims can, at least in principle, be brought\nbefore the court of public experience. The reason is that if we\ndo not require this, the result is “wearisome\ncontroversies” that there is no hope of resolving. That, he\nthinks, is the sad history of attempts to get beyond science, and it is\njust too painful. \n\nIf the proposals constituting some version of verificationism are\nadopted, then in the language thus constituted it will be analytically\ntrue that there are no synthetic sentences that are both unverifiable\nand meaningful. The notion of meaning here is not some new\ntechnical invention. Rather, ‘meaning’ is used in\nsomething like the ordinary sense. No grammatically well-formed\nsentence of this new language violates the verifiability\nprinciple. And the principle itself is completely safe. \n\nThought of in this way the verifiability principle does not describe\nnatural language, it is not intended to. It is intended to reform\nlanguage to make it a more useful tool for the purposes of\nscience. Carnap is under no illusion that natural languages are\nfree from metaphysics. Nor is he under the illusion that\ndefenders of the sort of metaphysics he targets will readily step up to\nthe challenge of presenting precise rules of grammar and inference.\n \n\nThere is one other change that tolerance brings to Carnap’s\nown vocabulary. Before tolerance, verificationism is stated in\nsuch a way that violations would count only as unintelligible\ngibberish. With tolerance in place, Carnap is prepared to imagine\nnon-empiricist languages, though of course he thinks they are very\nunwise. So instead of saying that \nsentences in non-empiricist languages are meaningless, he\nsays that they are empirically meaningless. And that has a very different\nflavor. There is no weakening of his defense of empiricism, but\nit is put on a somewhat different footing. \n\nLogic, mathematics, and mathematical geometry had traditionally\nseemed to be confirmationally “different”. Indeed it\nis hard to indicate any conditions under which any parts of them would\nbe disconfirmed. Leibniz had called them truths of reason.\nHume said that they represented relations of ideas. Kant had held\nthat the truths in these areas were a priori. Mathematics and\ngeometry were not analytic for Kant, but logic was. Kant had two\ncriteria of analyticity, apparently thinking them equivalent. First, in\nsubject-predicate sentences, an analytic sentence is one in which the\nconcept of the predicate is contained in that of the subject.\nSecond, an analytic sentence is one whose denial is\nself-contradictory. This seems to include not only the sentences\nwhose surface logical form would be of the required sort but also those\nthat can be got from such logical truths by making substitutions that\nwere conceptually equivalent. The more modern rough analog of\nthis is to say that the analytic sentences are those that are true in\nvirtue of logic and definition. \n\nFrege certainly developed logic beyond that which was available to\nKant, but he did not think of himself as changing the analytic status\nof it. Logic is after all the only avenue we have for giving\nmeaning to the notion of (logical) contradiction. Of course Frege\nalso attempted to reduce mathematics to logic (including both first and\nsecond order logic), and insofar as that reduction was successful it\nwould have implied that mathematics was analytic as well. Frege\nsaid little of geometry, but for him it was synthetic a priori. \n\nCarnap had not only studied with Frege, but like many of the logical\nempiricists he had started out as a neo-Kantian as well. So\nespecially in view of Russell’s relatively more successful\nattempt at reducing mathematics to logic, it was perhaps natural that\nCarnap would consider both mathematics and logic as analytic.\nGeometry could be handled in several different ways that we will not\ndiscuss here. But from fairly early on there was widespread\nagreement among the logical empiricists that there was no synthetic a\npriori, and that logic and mathematics and perhaps much else that\nseemed impervious to empirical disconfirmation should be thought of as\nanalytic. The point of drawing the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction, then, is not to divide the body of scientific truths or to\ndivide philosophy from science, but to show how to integrate them into\na natural scientific whole. Along the way the distinction\nclarifies which inferences are to be taken as legitimate and which are\nnot. If, as Carnap and Neurath were, you are impressed by\nDuhemian arguments to the effect that generally claims must be combined\nin order to test them, the analytic-synthetic distinction allows you to\nclarify which combinations of claims are testable. \n\nIf analytic, a sentence is true in virtue of the conventions of\nlanguage. In saying that, however, we must pause to confront two\nwidespread confusions. First, Quine alleges (1963, 385f) that the\nnotion of analyticity was developed and purports to explain for both\nKant and Carnap how certainty is possible. In fact\ncertainty has little or nothing to do with analyticity for the leading\nlogical empiricists. In saying that such claims are based on\nconvention they were explicitly calling attention to the revisability\nof conventions and the sentences that owed their meanings to those\nconventions. Second, nowadays any talk of convention is likely to\nprompt the response: “But that cannot be! No proposition\ncan be made true by our conventions or decisions.” Unless\nit is a proposition about conventions, this second sentence of the\nresponse is true. But it is also completely irrelevant.\nAnalyticity applies to sentences rather than\npropositions. Our conventions and decisions can and do affect\nwhat expressions mean and thus what sentences mean. Once the meaning is\nspecified, it may well be that any sentence that has this meaning would\nbe true even if, for example, the point masses of the universe were\narranged quite otherwise than they in fact are. These are the\nanalytic sentences. No claim is being made that meaning causes\nanything or that convention makes anything true. The\n“making” image here is out of place. It is just that\nin these cases the truth value of the sentence may well be functionally\ndependent on meaning alone. If it is, then in this special sense,\ntruth value depends on meaning, and that depends on convention.\nOther sentences whose meanings are specified might well be true or\nfalse depending on how things in the external world, so to speak, are\narranged. In this other category of sentence the truth value is\nnot functionally dependent on meaning alone. They are the\nsynthetic sentences. Now this puts matters extremely\ninformally. But at least the nature of the confusions over\ncertainty and convention should be clear. \n\nIn the Logical Syntax of Language (1934/1937) Carnap\ndefined ‘analytic’ in a new way in order to circumvent\nGödel’s incompleteness results. The method used was to\ndistinguish between a derivation relation (the relation that holds\nbetween some premises and what can be got from them in a finite number\nof steps) and a consequence relation. The latter is an\nessentially semantic relation that holds between some premises and some\nother claim such that on all valuations under which the premises are\nall true, so is that other claim. This definition bears a\nstronger resemblance to Tarski’s account in (Tarski\n1936b/1956). In any case, Carnap is able to show that for any\nsentence of pure mathematics either it or its negation is a consequence\nof the null set of premises. This leaves Gödel’s\nresults completely intact as they concerned what is provable, that is,\nderivable from the null set of premises or from any one consistent\naxiomatization of mathematical truths. \n\nAs noted above, another innovation of Logical Syntax is the\nPrinciple of Tolerance. While it reflects a long-standing\nattitude on Carnap’s part, the principle itself is new.\nLater Carnap was to say that the Principle of Tolerance was\n“perhaps better called the principle of conventionality”\n(Carnap 1942, 247), that is, the conventionality of linguistic\nforms. Tolerance stabilizes the verification principle as well as\nCarnap’s empiricism, and it reinforces the idea that the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction is always relative to a particular\nlanguage (Creath 2009). \n\nIn the late 1950s Carnap began exploring (1963a and 1966) how a notion\nof analyticity might be developed for novel theoretical terms where\nthe theories in which those terms are embedded are presented by means\nof a system of postulates. It is not clear that the account he\ndeveloped was intended to supersede his earlier account. In any case\nCarnap’s suggestion is as follows (where for convenience terms are\nused autonymously): Let T be the totality of theoretical\npostulates, and C be the totality of mixed sentences (the\nsentences of the theory containing both antecedent and novel\nterms). Also let\nR(TC) be the Ramsey sentence for TC, that\nis, the result of replacing each of the non-observational terms\nin TC with predicate variables and closing that open sentence\nwith corresponding existential quantifiers. R(TC)\n⊃ TC can, Carnap says, be thought of as the analytic\nsentence for the theory, that is, a sentence that gives to the\ntheoretical terms of TC their meaning. Over the last decade,\nthis idea of Carnap’s has provoked considerable discussion that has\nnot yet been resolved. Whatever worries there may be concerning this\npart of Carnap’s view, they are distinct from the more famous concerns\nraised by Quine. \n\nQuine began having doubts about analyticity about 1940, though he\nseems not to have been firmly committed against it until later.\nIn any case his doubts were not published until 1951 in his famous\npaper “Two Dogmas of Empiricism”. Quine’s\nreaders have understood his arguments in many different ways. The\nmost general form of his complaint is that ‘analytic’ so\nfar lacks the appropriate tie to observational criteria that\nCarnap’s own account of theoretical terms in empirical science\nwould demand. More specifically, where there has been an attempt\nat such a general criterion it has resulted in either a “drastic\nfailure as tended to admit all or no sentences as analytic, or there\nhas been a circularity” (Quine 1963, 404) of a kind that defines\n‘analytic’ in terms that themselves lack the appropriate\nempirical criteria and so can be accounted for only by appeal to\nanalyticity itself. \n\nThis complaint falls far short, as Quine well understood, of a proof\nthat Carnap’s appeal to analyticity was doomed. First, it\nrelies on the demand that theoretical terms must satisfy some empirical\nsignificance criterion. Many people at the time, including some\nwho followed Quine in rejecting analyticity, also rejected any general\nempirical significance demand for theoretical terms. Second, one could\naccept the demand for theoretical terms in physics or chemistry and\ndeny, as Carnap did, that the demand applied to his own work.\nThis is because Carnap saw himself as working in an area within\nmetamathematics rather than in empirical linguistics. Third,\nQuine did not pretend to have considered all of the possibilities for\nthe explication of analyticity. And so it may be possible to meet\nQuine’s demands to the extent that they are legitimate.\nFourth and finally, Quine seems in Roots of Reference (1974)\nto have provided an explication for ‘analytic’ that meets\nhis demand for empirical/behavioral criteria without inducing either\nthe drastic failure or the circularity envisioned above. \n\nThere is another somewhat independent thrust to Quine’s\ncampaign against analyticity. In the last section of “Two\nDogmas” (1951) Quine gives an extremely attractive sketch for an\nalternative epistemology that apparently makes no appeal to\nanalyticity. Insofar as that sketch can be filled out\nsuccessfully it would constitute a dispensability argument against\nanalyticity. Whether it can be thus filled out, however, remains\nto be seen. \n\nQuine’s other provocative theses, including especially his\nclaims about the indeterminacy of translation, while relevant to his\nassessment of analyticity, would carry us too far afield to consider\ntheir ramifications here. As with most topics in philosophy there\nis no uniform agreement in the literature as to whether the notion of\nanalyticity is or can be made sufficiently clear for use in scientific\nphilosophy. Nor is there such agreement that Quine’s\nepistemological sketch can be satisfactorily filled out. Both\napproaches have their defenders and their detractors. But between\nthem they seem to be the most promising avenues for integrating the\nlogic-mathematical part of science with the more straightforwardly\nempirical parts. Since Carnap is and Quine can be argued to be\nwithin the logical empiricist tradition, this progress toward such\nunification can be counted as part of the legacy of the movement. \n\nThe commitment of some of the logical empiricists to the unity of\nscience has been in recent years often discussed but less often\nunderstood. One hears in conversation that it was a sort of\nrearguard action designed to preserve as much as possible of a\nphenomenalist version of ontological reduction. One reads in\nprint that it can be refuted by the obvious fact that the various\nsciences have quite distinct theoretical vocabularies (Suppes\n1978). Both reactions are misplaced. \n\nIt was the left wing of the Vienna Circle, and above all Otto Neurath,\nthat championed the unity of science. They also promoted\nphysicalism, anti-foundationalism, and a generally naturalistic\nviewpoint. A main focus of their activities from the late 30s was\nThe Encyclopedia of Unified Science edited by Neurath in\nEurope and Carnap and Charles Morris in Chicago. A great many\nphilosophers of many different persuasions participated in that\nproject. The project may have been unified science, but they did\nnot have a completely unified view of what that project was. Here\nwe will discuss the Neurath and Carnap versions of it to see what their\ncentral concerns were. \n\nNeurath seems to have had two primary motivations to advance under\nthe banner of the unity of science. First, he was concerned that\nthere be no a priori methodological cleavage between the natural and\nthe social sciences. On the social scientific side he was\nconcerned that these sciences not condone some private, mysterious mode\nof insight (empathy) whose results could not be checked against more\nordinary public observation. Such a methodology would be a harbor\nfor metaphysics. On the natural scientific side, he was concerned\nto point out that, for Duhemian and other reasons, the situation is\nmuch messier than is sometimes supposed, and so invidious comparisons\nby natural scientists at the expense of social science were\nunwarranted. \n\nSecond, because Neurath was socially and politically engaged he was\nconcerned that the various sciences be connected in such a way that they\ncould be used together to solve complex human and social\nproblems. For this, considerable overlap of vocabulary was\nneeded, and this he called a “universal jargon”. \n\nIn recent years it is sometimes claimed that Neurath meant by the unity\nof science what some contemporary philosophers have defended as the\ndisunity of science. One cannot rule this claim out a\npriori. But the often substantial differences among the current\ndefenses of disunity make evaluating this claim difficult. It is\nfair to say, however, that Neurath was suspicious of grand hypotheses,\nfamiliar since the 19th century to derive all of chemistry,\nbiology, psychology, and the social sciences (in that order) from a few\nbasic principles of physics. It is unclear whether this stems\nfrom a general opposition to system building, since he was eager to\ndevelop inferential connections among the various sciences.\nPerhaps this is better expressed as an opposition to\nspeculative system building and to the idea that there is only\none way of systematizing our science than to systematicity as such. \n\nCarnap’s position on unity is different from Neurath’s,\nbut they overlap. Carnap distinguished the unity of the language\nof science from the unity of the laws of science. He wanted to\ndefend the former and to say what would be required for the\nlatter. As far as the unity of the language of science, Carnap\ndid in the Aufbau try to initiate a program for defining all\nof scientific concepts on the basis of a very small number of basic\nconcepts, perhaps only one basic concept. That does afford a\ncertain conceptual economy, but it is now generally held by Carnap\nscholars (see especially Friedman 1987 and Richardson 1998) that\nontological reduction and reduction to a phenomenalist basis was far\nfrom his motive. Carnap explicitly acknowledged that another\nsystem of definitions, one with a physicalist basis, might also be\npossible. Instead of ontological economy and a phenomenal basis,\nCarnap’s project seems to have been the more Kantian one of\nindicating how semantic intersubjectivity is possible: How can it be\nthat, even though I have only my own experiences and you have only\nyours, we can nevertheless share a common body of concepts? The\nanswer is given in terms of shared inferential structure and\nidentifying any given concept with a unique place within that shared\noverall structure. This is a highly holistic conception of\nconcepts and it depends on thinking of the body of scientific\ncommitments as a whole, as a unity. \n\nThe Aufbau was largely drafted before Carnap joined the\nVienna Circle. Once there and under some influence from Neurath, Carnap\ncampaigned more insistently for physicalism and for the unity of\nscience. They seemed often to be two sides of the same coin. From 1933\nonward there was a succession of monograph series with ‘Unified\nScience’ in the title. Until his death in 1945, Neurath was in\neach case the main editor and Carnap either the associate editor or\none of the associate editors. The International Encyclopedia of\nUnified Science, begun in 1938 is undoubtedly the most famous of\nthese. Carnap’s own essay on this topic “Logical Foundations of\nthe Unity of Science” (1938) was printed as part of the very\nfirst number in the encyclopedia. \n\nThe dates here are relevant because by the time of this essay Carnap\nhad already decided (Carnap 1936–37) that theoretical terms\ncould not in general be given explicit definitions in the observation\nlanguage even though the observation reports were already in a\nphysicalist vocabulary. The partially defined theoretical terms could\nnot be eliminated. This seems to have caused Carnap no consternation\nat all, and it never seems to have occurred to him that there was any\nconflict whatever between this result and the unity of science.  This\nis because by this point the elimination of concepts was not the point\nof the exercise; their inferential and evidential integration was. \n\nIn the 1936–37 article, “Testability and Meaning” Carnap\ncalled the partial definitions themselves “reduction\nsentences” and the system of definitions of theoretical terms,\nboth partial and complete, as a reduction of the theoretical terms to\nthe observational basis. Plainly he means by the word\n‘reduction’ something other than what we currently mean,\nnot that there is anything univocal about current uses of the\nword. By ‘reduction’ of vocabulary\nA to vocabulary B Carnap means the specification of the\ninferential relations that would allow us to say what sentences or\ncombinations of sentences in A would count as evidence for\nsentences in B. \n\nThis is also the key to what Carnap means by the unity of the\nlanguage of science. The language of science is unified, no\nmatter how different and exotic its various technical vocabularies may\nbe, when each of its terms is reduced to (can be tested in) a common\npublic observation vocabulary. The call for the unity of the\nlanguage of science, then, amounts to no more than the demand that the\nvarious claims of the separate sciences should be publically testable\nin a common observation language. Controversies will of course\narise as to what the observational vocabulary should be and what are\nthe acceptable forms of linkage. Carnap’s demand for unity\nin the language of science abstracts from those controversies to\nconcentrate on the goal of public testability. That does not seem\nto be an unreasonable demand. \n\nThe unity of the language of science so far discussed is quite a\ndifferent issue from the unity of the laws of science. And Carnap’s\nattitudes toward them are quite different. The latter issue concerns\nthe extent to which the laws of one special science can be inferred\nfrom those of another. Carnap tries to articulate what would be\ninvolved in such a unification, but he nowhere says that such a unity\nis either possible or mandatory. Finding any sort of inferential\nconnections among sets of laws would be welcome of course. But the\nquestion of how much unity there is, if any, among the various\nsciences is an empirical question that philosophers are ill equipped\nto answer. Philosophers should not make pronouncements, especially in\nadvance of having putative laws in hand, either that scientific laws\nare unified or that they are not. A certain modest deference to the\nempirical facts that philosophers generally do not have, again, does\nnot seem unreasonable. \n\nTaking unity as a working hypothesis, as some philosophers have done, amounts\nto looking for inferential and nomological connections among\nvarious sets of laws, but not to the assertion that such connection will be\nfound. Even if we accept the idea that such connections would be\nwelcome if found, the question of whether one should spend significant\neffort in looking for them is not thereby answered. That would be\na difficult and delicate practical question of how to apportion one’s\nresearch effort that for the purposes of this essay we must set\naside. \n\nThere are two broad approaches to probability represented in logical\nempiricism. One of these, the so-called frequentist approach,\nhas an extensive 19th century history and was\nfurther developed from about 1920 onward by Richard von Mises and Hans\nReichenbach. The other is the epistemic approach to\nprobability. This goes back at least to Laplace at the end of the\n18th century. In the 20th century Rudolf\nCarnap, who explored what he called logical probability, and Frank\nRamsey and Richard Jeffrey whose accounts can be distinguished from\nCarnap’s and are often called subjective probability, all\ndefended the epistemic approach. While Ramsey visited the\nVienna Circle he was not much influenced by its members on these\nmatters. By contrast, Jeffrey studied and later collaborated with\nCarnap but also made significant contributions of his own. \n\nIt is natural to begin thinking about probabilities with a simple\nmathematical account that takes as its point of departure various games\nof chance involving cards, dice, or coins. Bettors have long\nnoted that some outcomes are much more likely than others. In\nthis context it is convenient to take the probability of a kind of\noutcome to be the ratio of such outcomes to all possible\noutcomes. Usually for reasons of symmetry in the physical set up,\nthe possible outcomes are assumed to be equally likely. Where\nthat assumption happens to be true or nearly so the empirical results\nof, say, a great many throws of a pair of dice tends to be close to\nwhat the simple mathematical account would suggest. Conversely,\nwhere the outcomes deviate from the expected ratios, bettors begin to\nsuspect that the dice, coins, and cards (or the manipulations of them)\nare not all that they seem. The suspicion is that the outcomes\nare not equally likely and that the simple mathematical account does\nnot apply. \n\nThese facts suggest both two limitations of the simple account and\nthe beginnings of a way around them. The first limitation is that\nthe account applies only where the outcomes can be partitioned into\nalternatives that are equally likely. This is not the case when\ndice are loaded or in such real world cases as radioactive decay or\nweather forecasting. A second limitation is that the account, in\ndescribing the possible outcomes as equally likely, implicitly appeals\nto the very probability notion for which clarification was\nsought. The realization that we can sometimes discover the\nfalsehood of the assumption of equal likelihood and make a much more\nreasonable estimate of probability by making a large number of trials\nis very suggestive. And from his dissertation onward Reichenbach\nworked out a variety of imagined physical models that could guide ones\nthinking about probability in useful ways. The result is what is\noften called the frequency theory of probability (or sometimes the\nstatistical frequency theory or the limit frequency theory). \n\nEven a perfectly fair coin in an odd number of flips will never\nresult in exactly the same number of heads and of tails. When the\ncoin is fair and the number of flips is even, an outcome perfectly\nbalanced between heads and tails is not guaranteed either. So,\neven on the assumption that the probability of the coin’s coming\nup heads does not change over the course of the trials, we need to be\ncautious. A larger number of flips might make us more confident\nthat the ratio we have seen is close to the “actual” value,\nbut there is no finite number of flips after which we can say that the\nobserved ratio is exactly right. We will never make an infinite\nnumber of flips either, and in actual cases a large finite number of\nflips might so erode the coin as to bias the coin and discredit the\nresult. Notwithstanding these limitations on an actual series of\ntrials one can imagine an infinite series of trials and define a notion\nof probability with respect to it. This raises its own\ndifficulty, namely that ratios are not defined for infinite\ncollections. They would be defined, however, for any finite\ninitial segment of such an infinite series, thus giving a sequence of\nratios. If this sequence of ratios settles down on a limit, the\nprobability of the coin showing a head given that it has been flipped\ncan be defined as the limit of the ratio of heads to total flips as the\nnumber of flips goes to infinity. \n\nWhile probability thus defined has a somewhat counterfactual\ncharacter, that is not an obvious defect. Moreover, this notion\nof probability applies perfectly well to biased coins and loaded dice,\nas well as to radioactive decay. On the surface at least it also\nseem to avoid using the notion of probability in its own definition,\nand in these respects it seems to be an important improvement over the\nsimple mathematical model with which we began. The definition\nlocates the probability objectively “out in nature” so to\nspeak, and this comports well with Reichenbach’s scientific\nrealism. \n\nA problem that remained troublesome concerns the fact that one often\nwants to assign probabilities to particular events, events that in the\nnature of things cannot be repeated in all their particularity.\nThus it is unclear how a frequency theory of probability is to be\napplied to such individual cases. This is often called the\nproblem of the single case. It is a little difficult to assess\nhow serious this is, because in actual practice we often have no\ndifficulty in making probability assignments to single cases.\nSuppose we are interested in the probability of rain tomorrow.\nTomorrow will never be repeated, and we want to estimate the\nprobability now. What we do is to look back through the records\nto find days relevantly like today and determine in what fraction of\nthose cases those days were followed by rainy days and use that as our\nestimate. Even if we are comfortable with this practice, however,\nit is another matter to say why this should give us a reasonable\nestimate of the value of the limit involved in a logically impossible\ninfinite sequence. This problem of the single case was much\ndiscussed, and Wesley Salmon made progress in dealing with it.\nIndeed, Salmon’s account of statistical explanation can be viewed\nas a substantial mitigation of the problem of the single case (W.\nSalmon 1970). \n\nThere are residual difficulties in making estimates of the\nprobabilities on the basis of finite evidence. The problem is\nthat even when we are assured that the sequence of ratios has a limit,\nwe have no a priori grounds for saying how close the current ratio is\nto that limit. We can boldly estimate the limit by means of the\nso-called “straight rule”. This just takes the most\nrecent ratio as the desired estimate. This is a good practical\nsolution where the number of trials is already high, but this does not\nreally say why the estimate should be good, how good it is supposed to\nbe, or how many trials would be high enough. In addition, the\nstraight rule can yield counterintuitive results where the number of\ntrials is small. \n\nThough there are these issues outstanding, frequency theories\ndefine a concept of probability indispensable for quantum theories and\nfor a wide variety of other applications in the natural and social\nsciences. It was not the only concept of probability to be\ndeveloped by the logical empiricist tradition. The primary other\nsuch concept was the epistemic conception of probability. We will\nbegin with Carnap and then move to those who developed a subjectivist\naccount. \n\nCarnap is addressing a different issue than was addressed by von\nMises and Reichenbach. Instead of focusing on physical phenomena\nand ratios within them, Carnap focuses on arguments and takes as his\npoint of departure the widespread conviction that some arguments are\nstronger, in varying degrees, than others, even for the same\nconclusion. Similarly some bodies of evidence can give us more\nreason to believe a given conclusion than would another body of\nevidence. Carnap sets as his task the development of a\nquantitative concept of probability that will clarify and explicate\nthese widespread convictions. Such a quantitative concept would\nbe an extraordinarily useful tool, and it would be a useful successor\nto our ordinary, somewhat scattered notions of confirmation and\ninduction. \n\nCarnap approaches the problem by first considering extremely limited\nartificial languages and trying to find a confirmation function that\nwill work for that. If he succeeds he would then try to develop\nan account that would work for a broader and richer range of\nlanguages. In this his approach is like that of a physicist\ndeveloping a physical theory for the highly artificial situation of a\nbilliard table or air track and then broadening the theory to deal with\na wider range of cases. In Carnap’s case, however, it is\nsomewhat unclear what success would be in an artificial language very\nmuch unlike our own. In any case, Carnap is not trying to describe\nour linguistic habits but to clarify or even to replace them with\nsomething more useful. \n\nAs early as Logical Syntax (Carnap 1934/1937,\n244/316–17) Carnap had suggested that Wittgenstein’s remarks in\nthe Tractatus about ranges (Tractatus, 4.463) might\nbe a starting point for thinking about probability. By 1945\nCarnap also distinguished the two approaches described here, insisting\nthat they were not competitors but were attempting to explicate two\ndifferent concepts of probability. One need not choose one as the\nonly concept; both concepts were useful. Reichenbach, by\ncontrast, never conceded that both concepts were needed and insisted\nthat his frequency notion could serve all epistemic purposes for which\nany notion of probability is needed. \n\nCarnap’s general strategy was first to identify a broad class\nof confirmation functions, as subjectivists Ramsay and de Finetti were\nalso to do, and then find a natural way of limiting this class still\nfurther. The confirmation functions have to meet some basic\nmathematical conditions. The axioms that state these conditions\npartially define a function, and this function can be interpreted in a\nnumber of ways. Carnap himself lists three in Carnap\n1950. In (1955), John Kemeny (one of Carnap’s\ncollaborators and later a co-inventor of BASIC programming language and\nstill later president of Dartmouth College) gave an argument that\npersuaded Carnap that it was more fruitful to think of the function as\nindicating fair betting quotients rather than evidential support.\nThis took Carnap even closer in conception to the work of such\nsubjectivists as Ramsey and de Finetti. Indeed, the discussion of\nfair betting quotients, and related issues of Dutch book arguments had\nbeen initiated by de Finetti. \n\nIn Logical Foundations of Probability (1950) Carnap had\ndiscussed Bayes’ theorem and promised to expand the discussion in a\nsecond volume. Carnap’s interest in Baysianism grew,\nbut that second volume never materialized, quite possibly because rapid\ndevelopment of the field was still under way at the time of\nCarnap’s death. As his work proceeded Carnap tended to\nexplain probabilities by reference to events and propositions rather\nthan speak overtly about sentences. A similar change appears in\nthe rest of Carnap’s work as well. It is not clear,\nhowever, whether this amounts to a major change of view or a change in\nwhat he sees as the most felicitous mode of expression. As the\nyears progressed Carnap tended to see the remaining differences between\nhimself and his subjectivist co-workers as chiefly differences in\nemphasis. In any case the subjectivist tradition is now dominant\nin philosophical discussions of probability (Zabell 2007, 293).\nRichard Jeffrey whose own work arose out of logical empiricism carried\non that tradition for 35 years after Carnap’s death.\nJeffrey himself made major contributions including a principle for\nupdating ones beliefs when the evidence one learns is not\ncertain. The world knows this principle as “Jeffrey\nconditionalization”; he called it simply “probability\nkinematics”. \n\nPopper’s view of probability, his propensity theory, differs from\neither of the two approaches discussed above.  Unlike the epistemic\napproach of Carnap and others, Popper was not trying to\nclarify inductive relations because he did not believe that there are\ninductive inferences.  Theories can be corroborated by their passing\nsevere tests, but they are not thereby inductively confirmed or made\nmore probable. For a discussion of whether there are any significant\nsimilarities between Popper’s idea of corroboration and the ideas of\ninductive confirmation that he rejects, see (Salmon 1967, 1968). \nPropensities are thought of as tendencies of a physical event or state\nto produce another event or state.  Because propensities are to be\nfeatures of external events and not, to use Hume’s phrase, relations\nof ideas, the propensity theory and the statistical-frequency theory\nare sometimes grouped together as accounts of chance.  Popper has\nspecifically applied propensities to single non-repeatable events\n(1957), and that suggests that the concept of propensity does not\ninvolve any essential reference to long sequences of events.  Popper\nhas also taken propensities as producing outcomes with a certain limit\nfrequency (1959).  This does suggest a rather closer tie to the\nstatistical frequency approach.  Later philosophers developed both\nsorts of propensity theories, single-case theories and long-run\ntheories. (Gillies 2000) And like other approaches to probability and\ninduction all these views remain controversial.  While we will not\ndiscuss the relative merits of the various approaches further, those\nwho are interested in Popper’s views in this area should look at the\nmany papers on probability, induction, confirmation, and\ncorroboration, and Popper’s replies, in The Philosophy of\nKarl Popper (Schilpp 1974). \n\nIn 1967 John Passmore reported that: “Logical positivism,\nthen, is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever\nbecomes.” (1967, 57) Earlier in the same article he had\nequated logical positivism with logical empiricism, so presumably that\nwas dead too. At that time few would have disagreed with\nPassmore, even though Carnap was still alive and active. But in\nspeaking of this movement Passmore was referring not to a movement but\nto specific doctrines, and his interpretation of them was much\ninfluenced by Ayer. Even so, Passmore conceded that the movement\nhad left a legacy and that “the spirit which inspired the Vienna\ncircle” persisted. It still does. \n\nPart of the movement’s legacy lies in contemporary philosophy\nof science. In the US nearly all philosophers of science can\ntrace their academic lineages to Reichenbach. Most were either\nhis students or students of his students and so on. His\nscientific realism inspired a generation of philosophers, even those\nclearly outside the movement. Even the reaction against various\nforms of realism that have appeared in recent decades have roots in the\nlogical empiricist movement. Moreover, philosophers of science\nare expected to know a great deal of the science about which they\nphilosophize and to be cautious in telling practicing scientists what\nconcepts they may or may not use. In these respects and others\ncontemporary philosophers promote a kind of naturalism, and by so doing\nthey follow both the precept and the example of the logical\nempiricists. \n\nThere are other issues where the legacy of logical empiricism is\nstill visible. Two different approaches to probability are still\nunder discussion. One of them explores the objective chances of\nexternal events; this investigation follows in the tradition of the\nfrequency theory of Reichenbach and von Mises. The second\napproach has an epistemic conception of probability as exemplified by\nCarnap. S.L. Zabell summarizes the current situation as\nfollows: \n\nThere is also a continuing concern for how the various sciences fit\ntogether. Some have scouted theoretical unification and others a\nmore pluralistic model, just as the logical empiricists did.\nThere was for a while a vogue for the disunity of science. Some\neven said that their conception of the disunity of science is just what\nNeurath meant by the unity of science. Parts of the discussion\nwere intended as challenges to logical empiricism, but often the\narguments used were pioneered by the logical empiricists\nthemselves. \n\nFor the 30 years after Passmore’s report metaphysics became ever more\nvisible in philosophy. It was a diverse development, but in the\nself-conceptions of many of its most prominent practitioners there was\nno attempt to shun science or logic or to think that metaphysics had\naccess to facts that were deeper than or beyond those that a proper\nscience could reach. So the metaphysics that blossomed was not\nnecessarily of the sort that Carnap and others combated. Most recently\nthere are some in meta-ontology that want to reconsider and reconnect\nwith Carnap’s ontological caution. \n\nEven in its heyday many philosophers who on either doctrinal or\nsociological grounds can be grouped with the logical empiricists did\nnot see themselves that way. We should not expect philosophers today\nto identify with the movement either. Each generation finds its place\nby emphasizing its differences from what has gone before. But the\nspirit of the movement still has its adherents. There are many who\nvalue clarity and who want to understand the methodology of science,\nits structure, and its prospects. There are many who want to find a\nnatural home within a broad conception of science for conceptual\ninnovation, for logic and mathematics, and for their own study of\nmethodology. And importantly there are those who see in science a\nprospect for intellectual and social reform and who see in their own\nstudy of science some hope for freeing us all from the merely habitual\nways of thinking “by which we are now possessed” (Kuhn\n1962, 1).  These are the motives that define the movement called\nlogical empiricism. As Twain might have said, the reports of its death\nare greatly exaggerated.","contact.mail":"creath@asu.edu","contact.domain":"asu.edu"}]
