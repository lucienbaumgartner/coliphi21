However, as\nscholars have come to reassess in the last several years the\nphilosophical importance of early German Romanticism—both as\nsomething of a counter-movement to German Idealism and as a\ncontributing factor within idealism’s development—so interest in\nSchlegel’s distinctive philosophical contribution to his era has\nincreased. The entry below will consider the philosophical aspects of\nSchlegel’s development and their relation to his contributions to\nliterary theory and practice.\n\nThe youngest of five sons, Schlegel was born in Hanover into a\ndistinguished and culturally prominent literary family. His father,\nJohann Adolf Schlegel, was both a clergyman and literary figure; his\nuncle, Johann Elias, was a dramatist and aesthetic theorist; and his\nelder brother by five years, August Wilhelm, was to become the great\nGerman translator of Shakespeare and one of the most prominent\nliterary critics of the time. \nSchlegel attended the universities of Göttingen and Leipzig,\noriginally to study law, but his intellectual interests began to\nwiden, centering especially on classical literature, and he turned\nafter 1793 to a life of literary freelancing. In the succeeding couple\nof years, he wrote several early essays on Greek literature amid plans\nfor a history of classical poetry. Only one volume of the intended\nlarger study was published, in 1798, as Geschichte der Poesie der\nGriechen und Römer, but the essay “On the Study of\nGreek Poetry” (Über das Studium der griechischen\nPoesie, finished 1795, but not published until January 1797),\nwith its sharp distinction between ancient and modern modes of\nliterature, is taken to be representative of this early,\n“classicist” phase of Schlegel’s intellectual life. \nAn important influence on the young Schlegel was Caroline Böhmer,\nfuture wife of his brother (and ultimately of F. W. J. Schelling).\nSchlegel met her initially in 1794 in Dresden, and her life\nexperience—the daughter of a famous Göttingen professor,\nshe had become pregnant by a French officer in occupied Mainz and been\nimprisoned as a revolutionary—had a particular effect on the\nawakening of his interest in political and social issues. In the\nsummer of 1796, Schlegel moved to join his brother and new wife in\nJena, the city which, since Fichte’s momentous arrival two years\nprior, had become perhaps the liveliest intellectual scene in all of\nGermany. Schlegel remained in Jena for almost a year, but then moved\nto Berlin, where he became a regular visitor to the salons of\nHenriette Herz and Rahel Levin and established contact with several\nimportant figures of the Romantic movement. Among them were Friedrich\nSchleiermacher, who became Schlegel’s roommate and collaborator on a\nnumber of intended projects, including the translation of Plato’s\ndialogues (a project that in the end only Schleiermacher would\nactually carry out); the writers Ludwig Tieck and Wilhelm Heinrich\nWackenroder; and the poet Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis), who had\nbeen a fellow student with Schlegel in Leipzig and who was partly\nresponsible for opening up the philosophical problems of Fichtean\nidealism to the young Schlegel. \nAmong the works most famously associated with Schlegel’s name from\nthis period is the project of the journal Athenaeum, which\npublished in the years 1798–1800 a set of fragments written by\nboth Schlegel brothers, Novalis and Schleiermacher. During his time in\nBerlin, Schlegel also began a relationship with Dorothea Veit,\ndaughter of Moses Mendelssohn, who had left her banker husband Simon\nVeit in 1798. The publication in 1799 of Schlegel’s novel\nLucinde, with its frank (though by today’s standards hardly\nrisqué) portrayal of a sexual liaison widely thought to be\nautobiographical became for Schlegel a major scandal. \nIn September 1799, Schlegel left Berlin to join his brother and\nCaroline again in Jena. He gave lectures on transcendental philosophy\nat the University of Jena from October 1800 to March 1801, although\nthese were apparently not well-received. (Among those in the audience\nfor some of those lectures was probably Hegel, newly arrived in Jena,\nbut there is considerable dispute about what Hegel—a bitter\nrival of Schlegel’s for the remainder of his life—may or may not\nhave gained from hearing them.) \nSchlegel remained in Jena until December 1801, and his departure on\nthis occasion came at a time which marks a significant turning point\nin the history of Romanticism: the end of the “Jena\ncircle” and its collaborations. Novalis had died in March, and\nSchlegel had become somewhat distanced from his brother and Caroline.\nAfter a time in both Berlin and Dresden, Schlegel moved to Paris in\nJune 1802, where he founded another new journal, Europa, and\nturned significant attention to the figurative arts. Among other\nthings, Schlegel wrote accounts of the paintings in the Louvre and\nbegan, at the behest of the notable art collectors Sulpiz and Melchior\nBoisserée, a series of lectures on art and art history. \nSchlegel and Dorothea moved to Cologne in 1804, where Schlegel studied\nGerman Gothic architecture, gave lectures on the development of\nphilosophy (Die Entwicklung der Philosophie) and turned, with\nsome hopes of finally establishing himself in an academic position, to\na new intellectual interest: the study of Sanskrit and Hindu religious\nwritings. Schlegel’s work on the grammatical connections between\nSanskrit and the Indo-European languages, published as On the\nLanguage and Wisdom of the Indians (Über die Sprache und\nWeisheit der Indier, 1808), represents an important moment in the\ndevelopment of the study of comparative grammar (a term which Schlegel\nhimself coined in the text). \nThe study of Hindu thought marked an important shift in the\ndevelopment of Schlegel’s religious thought, as did a second and\nimportant event of the Cologne period: his conversion, together with\nDorothea, to Catholicism, in April 1808. The shift in Schlegel’s\nreligious stance corresponded with an apparently new political one as\nwell. \nIn March of 1809 he was appointed to a position in the Austrian civil\nservice and moved to Vienna, where he was to live for the rest of his\nlife. \nDuring these Austrian years, Schlegel was, among other things, the\neditor of an anti-Napoleonic newspaper, founder of two other prominent\njournal projects (the Deutsches Museum and\nConcordia) and an apparently popular public lecturer on a\nwide range of topics. Metternich asked him in 1813 to draw up\nproposals for a future German constitution, and Schlegel served (until\nhe was recalled) as first secretary of the Austrian legation to the\nDiet of Frankfurt. He died in Vienna in January 1829. \nSchlegel’s intellectual biography begins in what is usually\ninterpreted as a “classicist” phase. In his early\nStudium essay, Schlegel claimed that Greek poetry was\n“beautiful” while modern poetry was only\n“interesting” (interessant): ancient poetry\nstrove for an ideal and was “objective,” while modern\npoetry was “characteristic” and strove for an originality\nthat was “individual” or “mannered.” (A\nsimilar distinction, as many critics have noted, can be found in\nSchiller’s contemporaneous work On Naive and Sentimental\nPoetry. Schlegel apparently arrived at his distinction\nindependently, although when he did encounter Schiller’s essay, it\nprompted him to reconsider his approach to more contemporary\nliterature: see Eichner 1970, chapter 2, and Schlegel’s later preface\nto the Studium essay.) \nIn the years following the Studium essay, Schlegel moved not\nonly to a distinction between the classical and the romantic, as\nopposed to that between the ancient and modern, but moreover began\ndistinctly to privilege the romantic. What Schlegel meant by the term\n“romantic” (romantisch) and its apparent cognate\nRoman (usually translated as “novel,” but having\namong the Romantics a much wider sense) has long been disputed.\nPerhaps under the influence of Herder (see Eichner 1956), Schlegel saw\nthe historical origins of “the romantic” in the wide\nmixture of forms and genres that characterized medieval literature and\ntook it as the point of departure for a genre-transcending notion that\nallows even Shakespeare’s plays or Dante’s Commedia to be\nclassified as Romane. Seen from this historical perspective,\nthe Roman becomes the central dividing line between ancient\nliterature and the literature of the current age: Greek poetry, he\nclaimed in 1800, “began with and finally again converged in\nepic; our poetry began with and finally again will converge in the\nRoman.” \nThe shift between Schlegel’s classicist and romantic phases presents\nan interpretive challenge that is frequently discussed in the\nliterature. On the one hand, scholars have stressed that what Schlegel\nnow commends in romantic poetry are the very same facets he had\npreviously condemned (for example, Eichner 1970, 49, who lists here\nthe tendency toward the purely imaginative; the mixing of genres; the\ntrend toward didacticism, irony and parody; the fusion of poetry and\nphilosophy). On the other hand, many have noticed that there are seeds\nin the Studium essay of the later view—Schlegel’s\npraise of poets like Dante, Goethe and Shakespeare often seems at odds\nwith the essay’s valorization of ancient poetry. \nOne of the most important expressions of Schlegel’s claims for the\nromantic can be found in the much-discussed\nAthenaeumsfragment 116: Romantic poetry is said there to be a\n“progressive, universal poetry, … the only kind of poetry\nthat is more than a kind, that is, as it were, poetry itself: for in a\ncertain sense all poetry is or should be romantic.” The task of\nsuch poetry, he claims in this fragment, should be to “fuse\npoetry and prose, inspiration and criticism, the poetry of art and the\npoetry of nature; and make poetry lively and sociable, and life and\nsociety poetical; poeticize wit and fill and saturate the forms of art\nwith every kind of good, solid matter for instruction, and animate\nthem with the pulsations of humor.” In a similar vein, he raises\nthe stakes for what should be achieved by the genre that is not merely\na genre—the novel: a “genuine theory of poetry would be a\ntheory of the novel,” he claims. \nSchlegel does seem to acknowledge at times that his claims for the\nromantic border on the overly expansive (or, some would prefer, on the\ninherently incomplete or uncompletable). In a 1793 letter to his\nbrother, he said: “I cannot send you my explanation of the word\n‘romantic’ because it would be 125 sheets long”\n(cited in Beiser, 1992, 410, n 67). Schlegel’s bold envisioning of the\nromantic and the Roman are, however, part of a larger project\nin poetics and aesthetics concerned with finding a standard of\njudgment appropriate to the individuality of artistic and literary\nworks. \nThe aesthetic standard that Schlegel develops—perhaps best\nexpressed in his claim that “criticism is not to judge works by\na general ideal, but is to search out the individual ideal of\nevery work” (Literary Notebooks, 1733)—owes debts\nboth to Herder’s notions of the historical and cultural uniqueness of\nindividuals (Eichner, 1970, 42) and to Kant’s stress in the\nCritique of Judgment on the impossibility of judging beauty\naccording to some external rule (see Eichner, 1970,\n35–36, for an account of Schlegel’s successive readings of the\nthird Critique). Schlegel worked out his new criterion of the\n“individual ideal of every work” in three important early\n(1796) critical essays reviewing the work of Jacobi, Georg Forster and\nLessing that give a reader a sense of his distinctive approach as\nstylist and literary theorist (Wilhelm von Humboldt called Schlegel’s\nmethod in the Jacobi essay one of “reviewing the whole\nman”—i.e., the man visible precisely in his work).\nLikewise, Schlegel applies his approach to critical judgment in a\nfamous review of Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister, where he insists\nthat the novel “not only judges itself but describes\nitself.” \nGiven the importance Schlegel attaches within his romantic poetics to\nthe novel and to the novel which gives itself its own criterion,\ncritics have often examined Schlegel’s own novelistic efforts in light\nof his theoretical stance. The scandalous and unfinished\nLucinde, subtitled “Confessions of a Blunderer,”\nwas, according to Schlegel, an attempt at “shaped, artistic\nchaos,” a work that was meant to be “chaotic and yet\nsystematic.” Part of the achievement of its “shaped\nchaos” is that Lucinde presents, within the form of a\nnovelistic work itself , a romantic ‘contest’ of competing\nnovelistic possibilities (see, for example, the interpretation of the\nfamous chapter on the “Allegory of Impudence” in Behler\n1993). \nThe notion of the individual work as giving itself its own\ncriterion—a notion that appears later in the hermeneutic\ntradition and in Benjamin’s famous essay on the concept of\ncriticism—is one of a number of distinctive new facets of\nromantic poetics and aesthetics. Stylistically, Schlegel and the\nRomantics also made much of the notions of the literary fragment, the\nconcept of irony, and of wit and allegory, as well as a revised notion\nof the literary genres. \nThe fragment is among the most characteristic figures of the Romantic\nmovement. Although it has predecessors in writers like Chamfort (and\nearlier in the aphoristic styles of moralists like Pascal and La\nRochefoucauld), the fragment as employed by Schlegel and the Romantics\nis distinctive in both its form (as a collection of pieces by several\ndifferent authors) and its purpose. For Schlegel, a fragment as a\nparticular has a certain unity (“[a] fragment, like a small work\nof art, has to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world and be\ncomplete in itself like a hedgehog,” Athenaeumsfragment\n206), but remains nonetheless fragmentary in the perspective it opens\nup and in its opposition to other fragments. Its “unity”\nthus reflects Schlegel’s view of the whole of things not as a totality\nbut rather as a “chaotic universality” of infinite\nopposing stances. \nIf a literary form like the fragment opens up the question of the\nrelation between finite and infinite, so do the literary modes of\nallegory, wit and irony—allegory as a finite opening toward the\ninfinite (“every allegory means God”), wit as the\n“fragmentary geniality” or “selective\nflashing” in which a unity can momentarily be seen, and irony as\ntheir synthesis (see Frank 2004, 216). Although impressed with the\nSocratic notion of irony (playful and serious, frank and deeply\nhidden, it is the freest of all licenses, since through it one rises\nabove one’s own self, Schlegel says in Lyceumfragment 108),\nSchlegel nonetheless employs it in a way perhaps more reminiscent of\nthe oscillations of Fichtean selfhood. Irony is at once, as he says in\nLyceumfragment 37, self-creation, self-limitation, and\nself-destruction. \n“Philosophy is the true home of irony, which might be defined as\nlogical beauty,” Schlegel writes in Lyceumfragment 42:\n“for wherever men are philosophizing in spoken or written\ndialogues, and provided they are not entirely systematic, irony ought\nto be produced and postulated.” The task of a literary work with\nrespect to irony is, while presenting an inherently limited\nperspective, nonetheless to open up the possibility of the infinity of\nother perspectives: “Irony is, as it were, the demonstration\n[epideixis] of infinity, of universality, of the feeling for\nthe universe” (KA 18.128); irony is the “clear\nconsciousness of eternal agility, of an infinitely teeming\nchaos” (Ideas 69). A literary work can do this, much as\nSchlegel’s Lucinde had, by presenting within its scope a\nrange of possible alternate plots or by mimicking the\nparabasis in which the comic playwright interposed himself\nwithin the drama itself or the role of the Italian buffo or\nclown (Lyceumfragment 42) who disrupts the spectator’s\nnarrative illusion. (Some of the more striking examples of such\nmoments of ironic interposition in the works of Schlegel’s literary\ncontemporaries can be found in the comedies of Tieck—where, as\nSzondi (1986) argues, it is not merely the actor or playwright who\n“steps out” of his usual role, but in some sense the very\nrole itself.) \nAlong with his somewhat idiosyncratic appropriation of literary modes,\nSchlegel offers a theory of the literary genres which undergoes\nconsiderable revision as he attempts to take account both of the\nhistorical development of forms and particularly of the rise of the\nmodern novel. Moving from the pragmatic classifications of the\nEnlightenment to a philosophically oriented theory of the genres,\nSchlegel shifts from a view on which the drama (as\n“objective-subjective”) develops out of\n(“objective”) epic and (“subjective”) lyric to\none on which the epic in fact unites the other two classical modes\n(Szondi 1986, 85–86). The new stress on the epic genre\ncorresponds with his sense of the Roman or novel as the\n“modern epic” which transcends the traditional genres and\nwith a fluid sense of genre classification itself: “One can just\nas well say that there exist infinitely many [genres] as that\nthere exists only one progressive poetical\ngenre.” \nIn all of Schlegel’s writing about literary and artistic modes\nand genres, there is also a powerful return to formative questions\nabout the relations art bears to its sometimes rivals in philosophy\nand religion. Schlegel of course revived questions about the\nphilosophical shape of literature and the literary shape of philosophy\nthat ultimately run back to Plato’s “ancient\nquarrel” (Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy 1978). And, like his fellow\nRomantics Novalis and Schleiermacher, he also closely linked art and\nreligion in ways that picked up fundamental issues in the religious\ndiscourse of his time (see Ziolkowski 1990, Smith 2019 and Hampton\n2019): the relation of the infinite and finite (‘only he can be\nan artist who has his own religion, an original perspective on the\ninfinite’ [KFSA 2.257]) and the notions of symbol and myth and\ntheir connection to an increasingly pluralistic religious world\n(Dieckmann 1959, Speight 2019).  \nLike many other members of the generation which came intellectually of\nage in the 1790s—a group which includes not only the idealist\nphilosophers Schelling and Hegel but also the poets Novalis and\nHölderlin—Schlegel’s philosophical interests were framed\naround a concern for somehow uniting Fichtean freedom of the subject\nwith Spinozistic holism. It is likely that Schlegel attended Fichte’s\nWissenschaftslehre (Theory of Scientific Knowledge)\n“nova methodo” lectures in Jena starting in October 1796,\nand he was guided at least in part in his study of the new idealistic\nphilosophy by Novalis, whose own Fichte Studies represent a\nfascinating window onto the effect that Fichte had on this generation.\nNovalis and Schlegel had a famous conversation about idealism in the\nsummer of 1796, and both attempted to articulate an opposition to the\nreliance on a single first principle which they thought characterized\nthe philosophical efforts of Reinhold and Fichte to set Kantian\nphilosophy on a systematic basis. (This Romantic contribution to the\nanti-foundationalist Grundsatzkritik of the 1790’s has long\nbeen a neglected aspect of research on the development of German\nIdealism, as has the work of those philosophers—such as Immanuel\nNiethammer, Carl Immanuel Diez, Johann Benjamin Erhard and Friedrich\nKarl Forberg—who pursued a similar line of thought against\nReinhold and Fichte.) \nPhilosophers interested in Schlegel’s early engagement with the\nproblems of German Idealism have, in addition to his published works,\ntwo rich but tantalizingly incomplete textual resources to draw upon:\na set of fragments, the so-called “Philosophical\nApprenticeship” (Philosophische Lehrjahre), which date\nfrom 1796 and reveal Schlegel’s study not only of Fichte and Spinoza\nbut also of Winckelmann, Herder and Kant (this collection remained\nunpublished until the critical Schlegel edition of 1963), and notes\nfrom Schlegel’s Lectures on Transcendental Philosophy at Jena\nin 1800–01. \nSchlegel’s critique of first-principle philosophy is rooted (like\nNovalis’) in a sense of the ungraspability of the absolute or\nunconditioned. (As Novalis puts it in the first of his\n“Pollen” fragments: “Everywhere we seek the\nunconditioned [das Unbedingte], but find only things\n[Dinge].”) More specifically, Schlegel holds, against\nReinhold and Fichte, that “there are no first principles that\nare universally suitable [zweckmässig] companions and\nguides to truth” (KA XVIII.518, #13): even\n“self-evident” propositions can be doubted and so require\ndemonstration (thus opening up an infinite regress), and any\nproposition can be proved in an “infinite” number of ways.\nFor Schlegel “every proof is infinitely perfectible”\n(KA XVIII, 518, #9), and the task of philosophy is not one of\nsearching to find an unconditioned first principle but rather one of\nengaging in an (essentially coherentist) process of infinite\nprogression and approximation. \nPhilosophy on Schlegel’s view must thus begin with skepticism and tend\ntoward the absolute; the idealists have found no way to the latter\nthat avoids the difficulties of the former. Against Fichte’s attempts\nat system-building, Schlegel proposes a notion of what he calls an\nalternating proof (Wechselerweis): “In my system the\nultimate principle [der letzte Grund] is actually a\nreciprocal proof [Wechselerweis]. In Fichte’s [it is] a\npostulate and a conditional proposition” (KA XVIII,\n521). \nThe Schlegelian philosophy that results from this engagement with\nidealism is non-foundationalist, holistic and historical (see Beiser\n2003, 123–26). Schlegel himself describes his philosophical\napproach as resembling both a circle and epic poetry because it must\nforever “begin in the middle”: “Philosophy must have\nat its basis not only an alternating proof [Wechselbeweis]\nbut also an alternating concept [Wechselbegriff]. In the case\nof every concept, as in the case of every proof, one can in turn ask\nfor a concept and a proof of the same. For this reason, philosophy,\nlike an epic poem, must start in the middle, and it is impossible to\npursue philosophy piece by piece starting from a first piece which is\ngrounded and explained completely in and through itself. It is a\nwhole, and thus the path to recognizing it is no straight line but a\ncircle” (KA XVIII, 518). \nRecent work has emphasized the Kantian inheritance that lies behind\nSchlegel’s notions of irony (Rush 2016, who sees Schlegel as\nradicalizing Kantian regulativism in a way that makes it “more\ncontingent, historical and pragmatic”) and of a\n“progressive universal poetry” (Ameriks 2014). Others have\nstressed the importance of Schlegel’s philosophical work in ways\nthat open up his broader concerns with life and the world of organic\nbeings ( see the discussion of Schlegel’s later work in Section\n6 below, as well as Gorodeisky 2011 and Nassar 2014, 2015). As argued\nbelow, these larger interests can be seen particularly in\nSchlegel’s contributions to ethical, social and political\nphilosophy. \nAlthough Schlegel’s importance for ethical, social and political\nphilosophy has often been ignored or unjustly criticized, recent\ninterpreters have shown how Schlegel took himself as offering a\nresponse to a number of key challenges in the philosophical ethics of\nhis era, from Jacobian worries about nihilism (Gorodeisky 2011) to\nKantian rigorism and dualism (Crowe 2010). For the young Schlegel,\nconsideration of ethical and political matters was never far removed\nfrom consideration of the aesthetic. Like Schleiermacher and the young\nHegel, Schlegel puts a strong emphasis in his early ethical writings\non the notion of love. In his essay “On the Limits of the\nBeautiful” (Über die Grenzen des Schönen,\n1794), he argues that love is the highest form of aesthetic enjoyment\nand can only be realized between free and equal beings (Beiser 1992,\n248). Part of Schlegel’s larger political animus lay always (in early\nas well as late phases of his career) in a refashioning of the\nrelationship between the sexes. In his early phase, Schlegel shared\nwith other Romantics a sense of the political and social importance of\nthe revolutionary period. In his “Essay on the Concept of\nRepublicanism occasioned by the Kantian Tract Perpetual\nPeace” (Versuch über den Begriff des\nRepublikanismus, 1797), a commentary on sections of Kant’s\nPerpetual Peace, Schlegel moves to a far more democratic view\nof politics than Kant defended: Schlegel advocates not only the\n“necessarily democratic” nature of republicanism and the\n“majesty” of the people as expressed in a majority, as\nwell as the “political imperative” of making all nations\nrepublican, but—especially decisive against Kant’s restrictions\non political activism—argued that insurrection was legitimate in\ncertain cases. Schlegel’s political radicalism in this period comes\nmuch closer to Fichte than Kant and, in fact, rivals the claims for\nuniversal extension of suffrage advocated by Herder and Georg\nForster. \nIt is all the more striking, of course, that the politics of the later\nSchlegel, as he takes up a position in the Austrian court, turn\ndecisively more conservative. His late essay “Signature of the\nAge” (Signatur des Zeitalters, 1820) attacks the twin\nevils of idealism and British-American parliamentary government. As\nopposed to the machine-like state, Schlegel advocates as his ideal an\n“organic” Christian state consisting of\n“corporations” that form a living whole around the monarch\n(church, school, family, guild—a series of social institutions\nsimilar to that visible in the corporatist philosophy espoused in\nHegel’s philosophy of right during the same time period). \nIn the final twenty years of his life in Vienna, Schlegel followed on\nthe success of his brother’s famous Lectures on Dramatic Art and\nLiterature, given in that city in 1808,with several lecture\nseries of his own. He lectured on modern European history (1810),\nancient and modern literature (1811), the philosophy of life (1827),\nthe philosophy of history (1828) and the philosophy of language\n(1828–1829, a lecture series that was never completed because of\nSchlegel’s death). \nGiven Schlegel’s conversion and the more conservative tendency of his\nlater political thought, commentators have often raised questions\nabout the continuity between the earlier romantic phase and Schlegel’s\nlater work. Blanchot puts this line of questioning most sharply: \nThere is, to be sure, a rather different style and tone evident in\nmany of Schlegel’s later writings and lectures. In some of the lecture\nseries, there is a good deal of repetition and argumentative\nflaccidity of a sort the young Schlegel would no doubt have sharply\ncriticized. But it is far from clear that Vienna represented simply a\nphase of ossification in Schlegel’s intellectual life or even a turn\naway from the most important philosophical and literary concerns of\nthe young romantic. The literary lectures reveal interesting shifts in\nhis treatment of the literary genres (Eichner 1970, 117–23), the\nphilosophy of life pleads not unconvincingly for a\n“modest” conception of philosophizing that avoids the\nexcesses of merely abstract or empirical points of departure (Schlegel\n1847), and the philosophy of language insists upon the essentially\ndialogical character of human thought and expression (Schlegel\n1847).","contact.mail":"casp8@bu.edu","contact.domain":"bu.edu"}]
