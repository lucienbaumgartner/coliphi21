Philosophical literature in English amounted to a few\nmonographs and a single collection of papers devoted solely, or\nlargely, to questions to do with terrorism. Articles on the subject in\nphilosophy journals were few and far between; neither of the two major\nphilosophy encyclopedias had an entry. The attacks of September 11 and\ntheir aftermath put terrorism on the philosophical agenda: it is now\nthe topic of numerous books, journal articles, special journal issues,\nand conferences.\n\n\n\nWhile social sciences study the causes, main varieties, and\nconsequences of terrorism and history traces and attempts to explain\nthe way terrorism has evolved over time, philosophy focuses on two\nfundamental—and related—questions. The first is\nconceptual: What is terrorism? The second is moral: Can terrorism ever\nbe morally justified?\n\n\n\nPhilosophers have offered a range of positions on both questions.\nWith regard to the problem of defining terrorism, the dominant approach\nseeks to acknowledge the core meaning “terrorism” has in\ncommon use. Terrorism is understood as a type of violence. Many\ndefinitions highlight the experience of terror or fear as the proximate\naim of that violence. Neither violence nor terror is inflicted for its\nown sake, but rather for the sake of a further aim such as coercion, or\nsome more specific political objective. But there are also definitions\nthat sever the conceptual connection of terrorism with violence or with\nterror. With regard to the moral standing of terrorism, philosophers\ndiffer both on how that is to be determined and what the determination\nis. Consequentialists propose to judge terrorism, like everything else,\nin light of its consequences. Nonconsequentialists argue that its moral\nstatus is not simply a matter of what consequences, on balance,\nterrorism has, but is rather determined, whether solely or largely, by\nwhat it is. Positions on the morality of terrorism range from\njustification when its consequences on balance are good, or when some\ndeontological moral requirements are satisfied, to its absolute, or\nalmost absolute, rejection.\n\n\n\nPhilosophers working in applied philosophy have also sought to\ncomplement the discussions of terrorism in general with case\nstudies—studies of the role and rights and wrongs of terrorism\nin particular conflicts, such as “the Troubles” in\nNorthern Ireland (George 2000; Simpson 2004; Shanahan 2009), the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict (Gordon and Lopez 2000; Primoratz 2006;\nKapitan 2008; Law (ed.) 2008), and the bombing of German cities in\nWorld War II (Grayling 2006, Primoratz 2010).\n\n\n\nThe history of terrorism is probably coextensive with the history of\npolitical violence. The term “terrorism”, however, is\nrelatively recent: it has been in use since late 18th century. Its use\nhas repeatedly shifted in some significant respects. Moreover, in\ncontemporary political discourse the word is often employed as a\npolemical term whose strong emotional charge occludes its somewhat\nvague descriptive meaning. All this tends to get in the way of\nsustained rational discussion of the nature and moral standing of\nterrorism and the best ways of coping with it. \n\nWhen it first entered public discourse in the West, the word\n“terrorism” meant the reign of terror the Jacobins imposed\nin France from the fall of 1793 to the summer of 1794. Its ultimate aim\nwas the reshaping of both society and human nature. That was to be\nachieved by destroying the old regime, suppressing all enemies of the\nrevolutionary government, and inculcating and enforcing civic virtue. A\ncentral role in attaining these objectives was accorded to\nrevolutionary tribunals which had wide authority, were constrained by\nvery few rules of procedure, and saw their task as carrying out\nrevolutionary policy rather than meting out legal justice of the more\nconventional sort. They went after “enemies of the people”,\nactual or potential, proven or suspected; the law on the basis of which\nthey were operating “enumerated just who the enemies of the\npeople might be in terms so ambiguous as to exclude no one”\n(Carter 1989: 142). The standard punishment was death. Trials and\nexecutions were meant to strike terror in the hearts of all who lacked\ncivic virtue; the Jacobins believed that was a necessary means of\nconsolidating the new regime. This necessity provided both the\nrationale of the reign of terror and its moral justification. As\nRobespierre put it, terror was but “an emanation of\nvirtue”; without it, virtue remained impotent. Accordingly, the\nJacobins applied the term to their own actions and policies quite\nunabashedly, without any negative connotations. \n\nYet the term “terrorism” and its cognates soon took on\nvery strong negative connotations. Critics of the excesses of the\nFrench Revolution had watched its reign with horror from the start.\nTerrorism came to be associated with drastic abuse of power and related\nto the notion of tyranny as rule based on fear, a recurring theme in\npolitical philosophy. \n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, there was a shift in both\ndescriptive and evaluative meaning of the term. Disillusioned with\nother methods of political struggle, some anarchist and other\nrevolutionary organizations, and subsequently some nationalist groups\ntoo, took to political violence. They had come to the conclusion that\nwords were not enough, and what was called for were deeds: extreme,\ndramatic deeds that would strike at the heart of the unjust, oppressive\nsocial and political order, generate fear and despair among its\nsupporters, demonstrate its vulnerability to the oppressed, and\nultimately force political and social change. This was\n“propaganda by the deed”, and the deed was for the most\npart assassination of royalty or highly placed government officials.\nUnlike the Jacobins’ reign of terror, which operated in a\nvirtually indiscriminate way, this type of terrorism—as both\nadvocates and critics called it—was largely employed in a\nhighly discriminate manner. This was especially true of Russian\nrevolutionary organizations such as People’s Will or Socialist\nRevolutionary Party (SR): they held that it was morally justified to\nassassinate a government official only if his complicity in the\noppressive regime was significant enough for him to deserve to die,\nand the assassination would make an important contribution to\nthe struggle. Their violence steered clear of other, uninvolved or\ninsufficiently involved persons. Some instances of “propaganda by\nthe deed” carried out by French and Spanish anarchists in the\n1880s and 1890s were indiscriminate killings of common citizens; but\nthat was an exception, rather than the rule. The perpetrators and some\nof those sympathetic to their cause claimed those acts were\nnevertheless morally legitimate, whether as retribution (exacted on the\nassumption that no member of the ruling class was innocent) or as a\nmeans necessary for the overthrow of the unjust order. Accordingly, in\ntheir parlance, too, the term “terrorism” implied no\ncensure. When used by others, it conveyed a strong condemnation of the\npractice. \n\nThe terrorism employed by both sides in the Russian Revolution and\nCivil War was in important respects a throwback to that of the\nJacobins. The government set up in Russia by the victorious Bolsheviks\nwas totalitarian. So was the Nazi rule in Germany. Both sought to\nimpose total political control on society. Such a radical aim could\nonly be pursued by a similarly radical method: by terrorism directed\nby an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and\ndefenseless population. Its success was due largely to its arbitrary\ncharacter—to the unpredictability of its choice of victims. In\nboth countries, the regime first suppressed all opposition; when it no\nlonger had any opposition to speak of, political police took to\npersecuting “potential” and “objective\nopponents”. In the Soviet Union, it was eventually unleashed on\nvictims chosen at random. Totalitarian terrorism is the most extreme\nand sustained type of state terrorism. As Hannah Arendt put it,\n“terror is the essence of totalitarian domination”, and\nthe concentration camp is “the true central institution of\ntotalitarian organizational power” (Arendt 1958: 464,\n438). While students of totalitarianism talked of terrorism as its\nmethod of rule, representatives of totalitarian regimes, sensitive to\nthe pejorative connotation of the word, portrayed the practice as\ndefense of the state from internal enemies. \n\nHowever, state terrorism is not the preserve of totalitarian\nregimes. Some non-totalitarian states have resorted to terrorism\nagainst enemy civilians as a method of warfare, most notably when the\nRAF and USAAF bombed German and Japanese cities in World War II (see\nLackey 2004). Those who designed and oversaw these campaigns never\npublicly described them as “terror bombing”, but that was\nhow they often referred to them in internal\ncommunications. \n\nAfter the heyday of totalitarian terrorism in the 1930s and 1940s,\ninternal state terrorism continued to be practiced by military\ndictatorships in many parts of the world, albeit in a less sustained\nand pervasive way. But the type of terrorism that came to the fore in\nthe second half of the 20th century and in early 21st century is that\nemployed by insurgent organizations. Many movements for national\nliberation from colonial rule resorted to it, either as the main method\nof struggle or as a tactic complementing guerrilla warfare. So did some\nseparatist movements. Some organizations driven by extreme ideologies,\nin particular on the left, took to terrorism as the way of\ntrying to destroy what they considered an unjust, oppressive economic,\nsocial and political system. This type of terrorism is, by and large,\nindiscriminate in its choice of target: it attacks men and women of\nwhatever political (or apolitical) views, social class, and walk of\nlife; young and old, adults and children. It shoots at people, or blows\nthem up by planting bombs, in office buildings, markets, cafes,\ncinemas, places of religious worship, on buses or planes, or in other\nvulnerable public places. It also takes people hostage, by hijacking\nplanes and in other ways. \n\nAs “terrorism” has by now acquired a very strong\npejorative meaning, no-one applies the word to their own actions or to\nactions and campaigns of those they sympathize with. Insurgents\npracticing terrorism portray their actions as struggle for liberation\nand seek to be considered and treated as soldiers rather than\nterrorists or criminals. They often depict their enemy—the\nalien government, or the agencies of the social, political and economic\nsystem—as the “true terrorists”. For them, the test\nof terrorism is not what is done, but rather what the\nultimate aim of doing it is. If the ultimate aim is liberation\nor justice, the violence used in order to attain it is not terrorism,\nwhereas the violence aiming at maintaining oppression or injustice, or\nsome of the “structural violence” embodying it, is. On the\nother hand, governments tend to paint all insurgent violence with the\nbrush of “terrorism”. Government spokespersons and\npro-government media typically assume that terrorism is by definition\nsomething done by non-state agents, and that a state can never be\nguilty of terrorism (although it can sponsor terrorist organizations).\nFor them, the test of terrorism is not what is done, but\nwho does it. When a state agency uses violence, it is an act\nof war, or reprisal, or defense of the security of the state and its\ncitizens; when an insurgent group does the same, it is terrorism. Under\nthese circumstances, one person’s terrorist is indeed\nanother’s freedom fighter, and public debate about terrorism is\nlargely conducted at cross purposes and to little effect. Attempts of\nthe United Nations to propose a definition of “terrorism”\nthat could be accepted by all states and embedded in international law\nso far have been frustrated by the same sort of relativism. Islamic\ncountries would accept no definition that allowed national liberation\nmovements in the Middle East and Kashmir to be portrayed as terrorist,\nwhereas Western countries would accept no definition that allowed for\nstate agencies to be guilty of\nterrorism. \n\nThe evaluative meaning of “terrorism” has shifted\nconsiderably more than once. So has its descriptive meaning, but to a\nlesser degree. Whatever else the word may have meant, its ordinary use\nover more than two centuries has typically indicated two things:\nviolence and intimidation (the causing of great fear or terror,\nterrorizing). The dominant approach to the conceptual question in\nphilosophical literature reflects this. Terrorism is usually understood\nas a type of violence. This violence is not blind or sadistic, but\nrather aims at intimidation and at some further political, social, or\nreligious goal or, more broadly, at coercion. \n\nThat is how (political) “terrorism” is defined by Per\nBauhn in the first philosophical book-length study in English: \n\nAnother good example of a mainstream definition is provided in\nC.A.J. Coady’s article on terrorism in the Encyclopedia of\nEthics: \n\nYet another example is the definition proposed by Igor\nPrimoratz: \n\nThese definitions put aside both the question of who the actor is\nand the question of what their ultimate objectives are, and focus on\nwhat is done and what the proximate aim of\ndoing it is. They present terrorism as a way of acting that could be\nadopted by different agents and serve various ultimate objectives\n(most, but perhaps not all of them, political). It can be employed by\nstates or by non-state agents, and may promote national liberation or\noppression, revolutionary or conservative causes (and possibly pursue\nsome nonpolitical aims as well). One can be a terrorist and a\nfreedom fighter; terrorism is not the monopoly of enemies of freedom.\nOne can hold high government or military office and design or\nimplement a terrorist campaign; terrorism is not the preserve of\ninsurgents. In this way much of the relativism concerning who is and\nwho is not a terrorist that has plagued contemporary public debate (see\n1.1.4 above) can be overcome. \n\nBeyond concurring that violence and intimidation constitute the core\nof terrorism, the definitions quoted above differ in several respects.\nDoes only actual violence count, or do threats of violence also\nqualify? Must terrorist violence be directed against life and limb, or\ndoes violence against (some) property also count? Does terrorism always\nseek to attain some political goal, or can there be non-political (e.g.\ncriminal) terrorism? All these points are minor. There is also one\nmajor difference: while Coady and Primoratz define terrorism as\nviolence against non-combatants or innocent people, respectively,\nBauhn’s definition includes no such restriction. Definitions of\nthe former type can be termed “narrow”, and those of the\nlatter sort “wide”. Philosophical literature on terrorism\nabounds in instances of both types. \n\nShould we adopt a wide or a narrow definition? A wide definition\nencompasses the entire history of “terrorism” from the\nJacobins to the present, and is more in accord with current ordinary\nuse. A narrow definition departs from much ordinary use by restricting\nterrorist violence to that directed at non-combatants or innocent\npersons. Thus it leaves out most of 19th century “propaganda by\nthe deed” and political violence perpetrated by Russian\nrevolutionaries which they themselves and the public called\nterrorist. \n\nFor these reasons, historians of terrorism normally work with a wide\ndefinition, and social scientists do so much of the time. But\nphilosophers may well prefer a narrow definition. They focus on the\nmoral standing of terrorism and need a definition that is particularly\nhelpful in moral discourse. Morally speaking, surely there is a\ndifference—for some, a world of difference—between\nplanting a bomb in a government building and killing a number of highly\nplaced officials of (what one considers) an unjust and oppressive\ngovernment, and planting a bomb in a tea shop and killing a random\ncollection of common citizens, including children. While both acts\nraise serious moral issues, these issues are not identical, and running\nthem together under the same heading of “terrorism” will\nlikely hamper, rather than help, discerning moral assessment. \n\nNarrow definitions are revisionary, but (unlike those discussed in\nthe next section) not implausibly so. They focus on the traits of\nterrorism that cause most of us to view the practice with deep moral\nrepugnance: (i) violence (ii) against non-combatants (or,\nalternatively, against innocent people) for the sake of (iii)\nintimidation (and, on some definitions, (iv) coercion). In highlighting\n(ii), they relate the issue of terrorism to the ethics of war and one\nof the fundamental principles of just war theory, that of non-combatant\nimmunity. They help distinguish terrorism from acts of war proper and\npolitical assassination, which do not target non-combatants or common\ncitizens. It does not matter very much whether the victims of terrorism\nare described as “non-combatants” or “innocent\npeople”, as each term is used in a technical sense, and both\nrefer to those who have not lost their immunity against lethal or other\nextreme violence by being directly involved in, or highly responsible\nfor, (what terrorists consider) insufferable injustice or oppression.\nIn war, these are innocent civilians; in a violent conflict that falls\nshort of war, these are common citizens. \n\nTalk of involvement of individuals and groups in injustice or oppression raises the question: is the injustice or oppression at issue, and thus the standing of\nthose implicated in it, to be determined by some objective criteria, or\nfrom the point of view of those who resort to violence? Coady chooses\nthe former option. He approaches terrorism from the standpoint of just\nwar theory and its principle of noncombatant immunity.\n“Combatants” is a technical term designating agents of\naggression or, more broadly, “dangerous wrongdoers” or\n“agents of harm”; they are legitimate targets of\npotentially lethal violence. All others are noncombatants, and enjoy\nimmunity from such violence (Coady 2004). This approach may not be\ndifficult to apply in war, where the wrong or harm at issue is either\naggression that needs to be repelled, or systematic and large-scale\nviolations of human rights that provide the ground for humanitarian\nintervention. Issues of injustice or oppression that arise in an\ninternal conflict that falls short of war, however, tend to be highly\ncontentious: what some consider an imperfect, but basically morally\nlegitimate political and social order, others may see as the epitome of\ninjustice and oppression that must be overthrown, if need be by\nviolence. Under such circumstances, when a highly placed political\nofficial is killed by insurgents, that may be characterized (and\ncondemned) by many as an act of terrorism, while the insurgents and\nthose sympathetic to their struggle may reject this characterization\nand portray (and justify) the killing as political assassination. \n\nIn order to avoid this kind of relativism, Primoratz puts forward a\nview that in one important respect takes on board the standpoint of the\nterrorist. The direct victims of terrorism are innocent in the sense of\nnot being responsible, on any credible understanding of responsibility\nand liability, for the injustice or oppression the terrorists fight\nagainst—not responsible at all, or at least not responsible to\nthe degree that makes them liable to be killed or maimed on that\naccount. The injustice or oppression at issue need not be real; it may\nbe merely alleged (by the terrorists). Being responsible for a merely\nalleged great injustice or oppression is enough for losing one’s\nimmunity against violence, as far as the type of immunity and innocence\nrelevant to defining terrorism is concerned. According to the traditional version of\njust war theory one does not lose immunity against acts of war only by\nfighting in an unjust war, but by fighting in any war. Similarly, one does not lose immunity against political\nviolence only by holding office in or implementing policies of a\ngravely unjust government, but by holding office in or implementing\npolicies of any government: as King Umberto I of Italy said after\nsurviving an assassination attempt, such risk comes with the job.\nMembers of these two classes are not considered innocent and morally\nprotected against violence by those attacking them; the latter view\ntheir acts as acts of war proper or of political assassination,\nrespectively. If the terrorists subscribe to a credible view of\nresponsibility and liability, then, when they attack common citizens,\nthey attack people innocent from their own point of view, i.e.,\ninnocent even if we grant the terrorists their assessment of the\npolicies at issue. (This is not to say that those who consider a\ngovernment to be gravely unjust have a moral license to kill its\nofficials, but only that if they do so, that will not be terrorism, but\nrather political assassination. We can still condemn their actions if\nwe reject their judgment of the policies at issue, or if we accept that\njudgment, but believe that they should have opposed those policies by\nnonviolent means. But we will not be condemning their actions\nqua terrorism.) \n\nOn this account, not only real, but also merely alleged injustice or\noppression counts in determining the innocence of the victims and\ndeciding which acts are acts of terrorism; thus such decisions are not\nhostage to endless debates about the moral status of contested\npolicies. Nevertheless, a residue of relativity remains. The account\npresupposes a certain understanding of responsibility and liability: a\nperson is responsible for a state of affairs only by virtue of that\nperson’s voluntary, i.e., informed and free, act or omission that\nhas a sufficiently strong connection with that state of affairs, and\nthereby becomes liable to some proportionately unfavorable response.\nProvided the terrorists accept some such understanding of\nresponsibility and liability, they kill and maim people they themselves\nmust admit to be innocent. To be sure, some militant organizations\nresort to violence which we perceive as terrorist, yet object to the\nlabel. They profess a view of responsibility and liability based on\nextremely far-fetched connections between states of affairs and human\nchoices and actions, and argue that entire social classes or nations\nare responsible for certain policies and practices and all their\nmembers are liable to be attacked by deadly violence (for more on this, see 2.1 below).\nSuch arguments can only be regarded as preposterous. We should insist\non viewing their actions as terrorist, although they reject this\ndescription. It is not clear how this residue of relativity could be\nremoved (Primoratz 2013: 16–21). \n\nSome object to defining “terrorism” as violence against\nnon-combatants or innocent persons. They argue that doing so runs\ntogether the question of the nature of terrorism and that of its moral\nstatus, and begs the moral issue by making terrorism unjustified by\ndefinition. We should rather keep these questions separate, and take\ncare not to prejudge the latter by giving a wrong answer to the\nformer.  What is needed is a morally neutral definition of terrorism,\nand that means a wide one (Corlett 2003: 114–20, 134–35;\nYoung 2004: 57). But it is doubtful that “terrorism” can\nbe defined in some morally untainted way. The wide definitions these\nphilosophers adopt contain the word “violence”, which is\nitself morally loaded. A narrow definition is not completely morally\nneutral, as violence against the innocent is clearly morally\nwrong. But what is clear is that such violence is prima facie\nwrong. The definition implies a general presumption against terrorism,\nnot its sweeping moral condemnation in each and every instance,\nwhatever the circumstances and whatever the consequences of desisting\nfrom it. The definition does not rule out that in certain\ncircumstances it might not be wrong, all things considered. Ethical\ninvestigation is not preempted: a particular case of terrorism still\nneeds to be judged on its merits. \n\nAnother way of settling the issue of wide vs. narrow definition is\noffered by Georg Meggle. He adopts a wide definition of terrorism, and\ngoes on to distinguish two different types: terrorism in the strong\nsense, which deliberately, recklessly, or negligently harms innocent\npeople, and terrorism in the weak sense, which does not. Obviously, the\nmoral assessment of the two types of terrorism is going to be\nsignificantly different (Meggle 2005). \n\nThe vast majority of cases almost anyone without an ax to grind\nwould want to classify as “terrorism” exhibit the two\ntraits implied in ordinary use and highlighted by mainstream\nphilosophical definitions such as those quoted above: violence and\nintimidation. But philosophical literature also offers definitions that\nleave out one or the other core component. \n\nSome seek to sever the connection between terrorism and violence.\nCarl Wellman defines terrorism as “the use or attempted use of\nterror as a means of coercion”. Terrorism is often associated\nwith violence, but that is because violence is a very effective means\nof intimidation. Yet “violence is not essential to terrorism and,\nin fact, most acts of terrorism are nonviolent” (Wellman 1979:\n250–51). The last claim seems false on any non-circular interpretation.\nThere may be many acts generally considered terrorist that do not\ninvolve actual violence, but are meant to intimidate by\nthreatening it; but that is not enough to support the notion\nof “non-violent terrorism”, which seems odd. So does\nWellman’s example of “classroom terrorism”: a\nprofessor threatens to fail students who submit their essays after the\ndue date, causes panic in class, and thereby engages in terrorism. \n\nRobert E. Goodin offers a similar account, emphasizing the political\nrole of terrorism: terrorism is “a political tactic, involving\nthe deliberate frightening of people for political advantage”\n(Goodin 2006: 49). This, he claims, is the distinctive wrong terrorists\ncommit. Whereas on Wellman’s account one can commit an act of\nterrorism without either engaging in or threatening violence, merely by\nmaking a threat in order to intimidate, on Goodin’s account one\nneed not even make a threat: one acts as a terrorist by merely issuing\na warning about the acts of others that is meant to intimidate. This,\ntoo, seems arbitrary, although it makes sense as a step in an argument\nmeant to show that “if (or insofar as) Western\npolitical leaders are intending to frighten people for their own\npolitical advantage, then (to that extent) they are\ncommitting the same core wrong that is distinctively associated with\nterrorism” (Goodin 2006:\n2). \n\nIt has also been suggested that terrorism need not be understood as\ninducing terror or fear. According to Ted Honderich, terrorism is best\ndefined as “violence, short of war, political, illegal and\nprima facie wrong” (Honderich 2006: 88). This definition\nmight be thought problematic on several counts, but the idea of\n“terrorism” without “terror” seems especially\nodd. The two are connected etymologically and historically, and this\nconnection is deeply entrenched in current ordinary use. Intimidation\nis not the morally salient trait of terrorism (pace\nGoodin), but it is one of its core traits that cause most of us to\ncondemn the practice. We might consider severing the connection if\nHonderich offered a good reason for doing so. But he supports his\nhighly revisionary definition by the puzzling claim that to define\nterrorism as violence meant to intimidate is to imply that terrorism is\nparticularly abhorrent and thereby “in effect … invite a\nkind of prima facie approval or tolerance of war”\n(Honderich 2006: 93). \n\nCan terrorism be morally justified? There is no single answer to\nthis question, as there is no single conception of what terrorism is.\nIf we put aside definitions that depart too much, and for no compelling\nreason, from the core meaning of “terrorism” (such as those\ncited in 1.2.3), we still need to decide whether the question assumes a\nwide or a narrow understanding of terrorism. A narrow conception of\nterrorism seems to be better suited to ethical investigation (1.2.2).\nMoreover, philosophers who work with a wide definition typically hold\nthat terrorism that targets non-combatants or innocent persons is much\nmore difficult to justify than “selective” terrorism which\nattacks only those who cannot plausibly claim innocence of the\ninjustice or oppression at issue (and which accordingly does not count\nas “terrorism” on a narrow definition of the term). The\npresent discussion therefore focuses on terrorism understood as\nviolence against innocent civilians or common citizens, intended to\nintimidate and thereby to achieve some further (political) objective\nor, more broadly, to coerce. \n\nOne might try to justify some acts or campaigns of violence of this\nkind in two ways. One could argue that the victims may be\nnon-combatants or common citizens, but nevertheless are not innocent of\nthe wrongs the terrorists are fighting against. Alternatively, one\ncould concede the innocence of the victims and argue that attacks on\nthem are nevertheless justified, either by their consequences on\nbalance, or by some deontological considerations. \n\nIf the former line of argument is successful, will it prove too\nmuch? In showing that an instance of violence was justified because\nthose targeted were not really innocent, we will have shown that the\nact or campaign of violence at issue was actually not a case of\nterrorism. This may be merely a matter of semantics. There is a much\nmore damaging objection. A terrorist act is characteristically the\nkilling or injuring of a random collection of people who happen to be\nin a certain place at a certain time. Arguments to the effect that\nthose people are not innocent of the wrongs the terrorist fights\nagainst will therefore have a very wide reach, and accordingly\nwill be based on some simplistic conception of collective responsibility.\nThese arguments will be of the sort offered, for example, by the 19th\ncentury anarchist Emile Henry. He planted a bomb at the office of a\nmining company which, if it had exploded, would have killed or injured\na number of people who did not work for the company, but lived in the\nsame building. He also planted a bomb in a café that did go off,\ninjuring twenty people, one of whom later died of his injuries. At his\ntrial, Henry explained: “What about the innocent victims?\n[…] The building where the Carmeaux Company had its offices was\ninhabited only by the bourgeois; hence there would be no innocent\nvictims. The whole of the bourgeoisie lives by the exploitation of the\nunfortunate, and should expiate its crimes together” (Henry 1977:\n193). When commenting on the second attack, he said: \n\nThis is an utterly implausible view of responsibility and liability.\nIt claims that all members of a social class—men and women,\nyoung and old, adults and children—are liable to be killed or\nmaimed: some for operating the system of exploitation, others for\nsupporting it, and still others for benefiting from it. Even if, for\nthe sake of argument, we grant the anarchist’s harsh moral\ncondemnation of capitalist society, not every type and degree of\ninvolvement with it can justify the use of extreme violence. Giving the\nsystem political support, or benefiting from it, may be morally\nobjectionable, but is surely not enough to make one liable to be blown\nto pieces. \n\nAnother, more recent example, is provided by Osama Bin Laden. In an\ninterview in the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001 he\nsaid: \n\nThis, too, is a preposterous understanding of responsibility and\nliability. For it claims that all Americans are eligible to be killed\nor maimed: some for devising and implementing America’s policies,\nothers for participating in the political process, still others for\npaying taxes. Even if, for the sake of argument, we grant Bin\nLaden’s severe condemnation of those policies, not every type and\ndegree of involvement with them can justify the use of lethal violence.\nSurely voting in elections or paying taxes is not enough to make one\nfair game. \n\nAttempts at justification of terrorism that concede that its victims\nare innocent seem more promising. They fall into two groups, depending\non the type of ethical theory on which they are based. \n\nAdherents of consequentialism judge terrorism, like every other\npractice, solely by its consequences. Terrorism is not considered wrong\nin itself, but only if it has bad consequences on balance. The\ninnocence of the victims does not change that. This is an instance of a\ngeneral trait of consequentialism often highlighted by its critics, for\nexample in the debate about the moral justification of legal\npunishment. A standard objection to the consequentialist approach to\npunishment has been that it implies that punishment of the innocent is\njustified, when its consequences are good on balance. This objection\ncan only get off the ground because consequentialism denies that in\nsuch matters a person’s innocence is morally significant in\nitself. \n\nThose who consider terrorism from a consequentialist point of view\ndiffer in their assessment of its morality. Their judgment on terrorism\ndepends on their view of the good to be promoted by its use and on\ntheir assessment of the utility of terrorism as a means of promoting\nit. There is room for disagreement on both issues. \n\nKai Nielsen approaches questions to do with political violence in\ngeneral and terrorism in particular as a consequentialist in ethics and\na socialist in politics. The use of neither can be ruled out\ncategorically; it all depends on their utility as a method for\nattaining morally and politically worthwhile objectives such as\n“a truly socialist society” or liberation from colonial\nrule. “When and where [either] should be employed is a tactical\nquestion that must be decided … on a case-by-case basis …\nlike the choice of weapon in a war” (Nielsen 1981: 435). Nielsen\nhas a wide definition of terrorism, but his examples show that the\ninnocence of the victims of terrorism makes no difference to its\njustification—that is, that his conclusions apply to terrorism\nin both the wide and narrow sense. In his view, \n\nHistorical experience, in Nielsen’s view, tells us that\nterrorism on a small scale, used as the sole method of struggle in\norder to provoke the masses into revolutionary action, is ineffective\nand often counterproductive. On the other hand, terrorism employed in\nconjunction with guerrilla warfare in a protracted war of liberation\nmay well prove useful and therefore also justified, as it did in\nAlgeria and South Vietnam. (For an earlier statement of the same view,\nsee Trotsky 1961: 48–59, 62–65.) \n\nNicholas Fotion also uses a wide definition of terrorism. He, too,\nis a consequentialist (although some of his remarks concerning the\ninnocence of many victims of terrorism might be more at home in\nnonconsequentialist ethics). But he finds standard consequentialist\nassessments of terrorism such as Nielsen’s too permissive. If\nsome types of terrorism are justifiable under certain circumstances,\nsuch circumstances will be extremely rare. Terrorists and their\napologists do not perform the requisite calculations properly. One\nproblem is the “higher good” to be promoted by terrorism:\nmore often than not, it is defined in ideological terms, rather than\nderived from settled preferences or interests of actual people. But for\nthe most part Fotion discusses the issue of means. If a terrorist act\nor campaign is to be justified instrumentally, it must be shown (1)\nthat the end sought is good enough to justify the means, (2) that the\nend will indeed be achieved by means of terrorism, and (3) that the end\ncannot be achieved in any other way that is morally and otherwise less\ncostly. Terrorists not only, as a matter of fact, fail to discharge\nthis burden; Fotion argues that, with regard to terrorism that\nvictimizes innocent people, it cannot be discharged. All direct victims\nof terrorism are treated as objects to be used—indeed, used \nup—by the terrorist. But \n\nIn reply, terrorists can claim that they advisedly sacrifice valued\nhuman beings for a higher good. But for this claim to carry any\nconviction, they would have to show that they have no alternative. Yet,\nFotion argues, they always have the alternative of taking on\nthe opponent’s military establishment, and often also have the\noption of going after government officials responsible for the wrongs\nthey object to, instead of attacking innocent persons. That kind of\nterrorism may sometimes be justified, whereas terrorism that targets\ninnocent people never is. \n\nWithin a nonconsequentialist approach to morality, terrorism is\nconsidered wrong in itself, because of what it is, rather than only\nbecause (and insofar as) its consequences are bad on balance. But this\nis not to say that this approach leaves no room whatever for morally\njustifying certain acts or campaigns of terrorism. Indeed,\nnonconsequentialist discussions of terrorism also present a range of\npositions and arguments. \n\nA nonconsequentialist might try to justify an act or campaign of\nterrorism in one of two ways. One might invoke some deontological\nconsiderations, such as justice or rights, in favor of resorting to\nterrorism under certain circumstances. Alternatively, one might argue\nthat the obvious, and obviously very weighty, considerations of rights\n(of the victims of terrorism) and justice (which demands respect for\nthose rights) may sometimes be overridden by extremely weighty\nconsiderations of consequences—an extremely high price that\nwould be paid for not resorting to terrorism. For the\nrejection of consequentialism is of course not tantamount to denying\nthat consequences of our actions, policies, and practices matter in\ntheir moral assessment; what is denied is the consequentialists’\nclaim that only consequences matter. \n\nVirginia Held operates with a broad notion of terrorism, but her\njustification of terrorism is meant to apply to terrorism that targets\ncommon citizens. Her discussion of the subject focuses on the issue of\nrights. When rights of a person or group are not respected, what may\nwe do in order to ensure that they are? On one view, known as\nconsequentialism of rights, if the only way to ensure respect of a\ncertain right of A and B is to infringe the same\nright of C, we shall be justified in doing so. Held does not\nhold that such trade-offs in rights with the aim of maximizing their\nrespect in a society are appropriate. Yet rights sometimes come into\nconflict, whether directly or indirectly (as in the above\nexample). When that happens, there is no way we can avoid comparing\nthe rights involved as more or less stringent and making certain\nchoices between them. That applies to the case of terrorism\ntoo. Terrorism obviously violates some human rights of its\nvictims. But its advocates claim that in some circumstances a limited\nuse of terrorism is the only way of bringing about a society where\nhuman rights of all will be respected. \n\nEven when this claim is true, that is not enough to make resort to\nterrorism justified. But it will be justified if an additional\ncondition is met: that of distributive justice. If there is a society\nwhere the human rights of a part of the population are respected, while\nthe same rights of another part of the population are being violated;\nif the only way of changing that and ensuring that human rights of all\nare respected is a limited use of terrorism; finally, if terrorism is\ndirected against members of the first group, which up to now has been\nprivileged as far as respect of human rights is concerned—then\nterrorism will be morally justified. This is a justification in terms\nof distributive justice, applied to the problem of violations of human\nrights. It is more just to equalize the violations of human rights in a\nstage of transition to a society where the rights of all are respected,\nthan to allow that the group which has already suffered large-scale\nviolations of human rights suffer even more such violations (assuming\nthat in both cases we are dealing with violations of the same, or\nequally stringent, human rights). The human rights of many are going to be\nviolated in any case; it is more just, and therefore morally\npreferable, that their violations should be distributed in a more\nequitable way (Held 2008). \n\nIt might be objected that in calling for sacrificing such basic\nhuman rights as the right to life and to bodily security of\nindividual victims of terrorism for the sake of a more just\ndistribution of violations of the same rights within a group\nin the course of transition to a stage where these rights will be\nrespected throughout that group, Held offends against the principles of\nseparateness of persons and respect for persons (Primoratz 1997:\n230–31). In response, Held argues that \n\nAn argument for achieving a just distribution of rights violations is\nnot necessarily about groups; it can be an argument about the rights\nof individuals to fairness (Held 2008: 89–90). (For further\nobjections to Held’s argument, see Steinhoff 2007: 125–30; Nath\n2011.) \n\nIn Held’s justification of terrorism, it is justice that\nrequires that inescapable violations of human rights be more evenly\ndistributed. There is a different way of allowing for the use of\nterrorism under certain circumstances within a nonconsequentialist\napproach to the ethics of violence. It could be argued that, as far as\njustice and rights are concerned, terrorism (or, in Held’s\nterminology, the kind of terrorism that targets the innocent) is never\njustified. Furthermore, considerations of justice and rights carry much\ngreater weight than considerations of good and bad consequences, and\ntherefore normally trump the latter in cases of conflict. However, in\nexceptional circumstances considerations concerning \nconsequences—the price of not resorting to terrorism—may be\nso extremely weighty as to override those of justice and rights. \n\nMichael Walzer offers an argument along these lines in his discussion\nof “terror bombing” of German cities in World War II. In\nearly 1942, it seemed that Britain would be defeated by Germany and\nthat its military could not prevail while fighting in accordance with\nthe rules of war. Britain was the only remaining obstacle to the\nsubjugation of most of Europe by the Nazis. That was “an\nultimate threat to everything decent in our lives, an ideology and a\npractice of domination so murderous, so degrading even to those who\nmight survive, that the consequences of its final victory were\nliterally beyond calculation, immeasurably awful” (Walzer 2000:\n253). Thus Britain was facing a “supreme emergency”: an\n(a) imminent threat of (b) something utterly unthinkable from a moral\npoint of view. In such an emergency—a case of the “dirty\nhands” predicament that so often plagues political action (see\nWalzer 1973)—one may breach a basic and weighty moral principle\nsuch as civilian immunity, if that is the only hope of fending off the\nthreat. So for more than three years, the RAF, later joined by the\nUSAAF, deliberately devastated many German cities, killed about\n600,000 civilians and seriously injured another 800,000 in an attempt\nto terrorize the German people into forcing their leadership to halt\nthe war and surrender unconditionally. By early 1943 it was clear that\nGermany was not going to win the war, and all subsequent terror\nbombing lacked moral justification. But in its first year, in Walzer’s\nview, the terror bombing of Germany was morally justified as a\nresponse to the supreme emergency Britain was facing.  Walzer then\nexpands the notion of supreme emergency to apply to a single political\ncommunity facing the threat of extermination or enslavement, and\neventually to a single political community whose “survival and\nfreedom” are at stake. For “the survival and freedom of\npolitical communities—whose members share a way of life,\ndeveloped by their ancestors, to be passed on to their\nchildren—are the highest values of international society”\n(Walzer 2000: 254). \n\nHere we have two different conceptions of supreme emergency. The\nthreat is imminent in both, but the nature of the threat differs: it is\none thing to suffer the fate the Nazis had in store for peoples they\nconsidered racially inferior, and another to have one’s polity\ndismantled. By moving back and forth between these two types of supreme\nemergency under the ambiguous heading of threat to “the survival\nand freedom of a political community”, Walzer seeks to extend to\nthe latter the moral response that might be appropriate to the former.\nYet whereas genocide, expulsion, or enslavement of an entire people\nmight be thought a moral disaster that may be fended off by\nany means, its loss of political independence is, at most, a\npolitical disaster. If a polity to be dismantled lacks moral\nlegitimacy, its demise may well be a moral improvement. But even if a\npolity does have moral legitimacy, a threat to its “survival and\nfreedom” falls short of “an ultimate threat to everything\ndecent in our lives”. If so, its military cannot be justified in\nwaging war on enemy civilians in order to defend it. (On supreme emergencies generally see, for instance, Statman 2006.) \n\nThere is another, less permissive position constructed along similar\nlines, but based on a more austere view of what counts as a moral\ndisaster that might justify resort to terrorism. Contrary to what many\nfighters against social or economic oppression, colonial rule, or\nforeign occupation believe, evils of such magnitude that they can\njustify indiscriminate killing and maiming of innocent people are\nextremely rare. Not every case of oppression, foreign rule, or\noccupation, however morally indefensible, amounts to a moral disaster\nin the relevant sense. Nor does every imminent threat to “the\nsurvival and freedom of a political community” qualify, contrary\nto what Walzer has argued. However, if an entire people is subjected to\nextermination, or to an attempt at “ethnically cleansing” it\nfrom its land, then it is facing a true moral disaster and may properly\nconsider terrorism as a method of struggle against such a fate. In view\nof their enormity and finality, extermination and “ethnic\ncleansing” of an entire people constitute a category apart. To be sure, resorting to\nterrorism in such a case will be morally justified only if there are\nvery good grounds for believing that terrorism will succeed where\nnothing else will: in preventing imminent extermination or “ethnic\ncleansing”, or stopping it if it is already under way. Cases\nwhere both conditions are met will be extremely rare. Indeed, history\nmay not offer a single example. But that does not mean that that no act\nor campaign of terrorism could ever satisfy these conditions and thus\nturn out to be justified. Accordingly, terrorism is almost\nabsolutely wrong (Primoratz 2013: chapter 6). \n\nBoth the “supreme emergency” and the “moral\ndisaster” view will justify a resort to terrorism only when that\nis the only way to deal with the emergency, or to prevent the disaster,\nrespectively. Just how certain must we be that terrorism will indeed\nachieve the goal, while no other method will? One might argue that when\nin extremis, we cannot apply stringent epistemic standards in\ndeciding how to cope—indeed, if we cannot really know what will\nwork, we must take our chances with what might. This is Walzer’s\nview: in such a predicament, we must “wager” the crime of\nterrorism against the evil that is otherwise in store for us.\n“There is no option; the risk otherwise is too great”\n(Walzer 2000: 259–260). It may be objected that this position\nhighlights the enormity of the threat, while failing to give due weight\nto the enormity of the means proposed for fending off the \nthreat—the enormity of terrorism, of deliberately killing and maiming\ninnocent people. When that is taken into account, the conclusion may\nrather be that even in extremis, if terrorism is to be\njustified, the reasons for believing that it will work and that nothing\nelse will must be very strong\nindeed. \n\nSome hold that terrorism is absolutely wrong. This position, too,\ncomes in different versions. Some philosophers work with a wide\ndefinition of terrorism, and argue that under certain circumstances\n“selective” terrorism that targets only those seriously\nimplicated in the wrongs at issue may be justified (Corlett 2003, Young\n2004). This seems to suggest that terrorism which is not selective in\nthis way—that is, terrorism in the narrow sense—is\nnever justified. Yet this does not follow: there is still room for\narguing that terrorism of the latter type can be justified by further\nconsiderations, such as those of “supreme emergency” or\n“moral disaster”. \n\nPer Bauhn does not leave it at that. He attempts to show that\nterrorism that targets non-combatants or common citizens can never be\njustified by deploying a slightly amended version of Alan\nGewirth’s ethical theory. Freedom and safety are fundamental\nprerequisites of action and therefore must be accorded paramount\nweight. The need to protect them generates a range of rights; the right\npertinent here is “an absolute right not to be made the intended\nvictims of a homicidal project” all innocent persons have\n(Gewirth 1981: 16). When the absolute status of this right is\nchallenged by invoking supreme emergency or moral disaster, Bauhn\nargues that there is a moral difference between what we are positively\nand directly causally responsible for, and what we are causally\nresponsible for only indirectly, by failing to prevent other persons\nfrom intentionally bringing it about. We are morally responsible for\nthe former, but (except in certain special circumstances) not for the\nlatter. If we refuse to resort to terrorism in order not to target\ninnocent persons, and thus fail to prevent some other persons from\nperpetrating atrocities, it is only the perpetrators who will be\nmorally responsible for those atrocities. Therefore we must refuse\n(Bauhn 1989: chapter 5). \n\nStephen Nathanson seeks to ground the absolute immunity of civilians or\ncommon citizens and the absolute prohibition of terrorism which it entails in a\nrule-consequentialist ethical theory (Nathanson 2010:\n191–208). Adopting civilian immunity, rather than adopting any other\nrule regulating the matter or having no rule at all, is the best way\nto reduce the killing and destruction in armed conflict. Moreover, the\nbest consequences will be achieved by adopting it as an absolute rule,\nrather than as a rule allowing for exceptions in supreme\nemergencies. The idea of supreme emergency is vague. The criteria for\nproffering supreme emergency exemptions are liable to be applied in\narbitrary and subjective ways. Finally, there is the slippery slope\nargument: “permitting [departures from the rule of civilian\nimmunity, including terrorism] even under the direst circumstances\nwill lower the bar for justifying such acts … broadcast the message\nthat such behavior may sometimes be justified and … thus lend its\nweight to increasing the use of such methods” (Nathanson 2010:\n207).  \n\nHowever, one can adopt rule-consequentialism as one’s ethical theory\nand yet view the immunity of civilians or common citizens and the\nattendant prohibition of terrorism as very stringent, but not absolute\nmoral rules. Thus Richard B. Brandt and Brad Hooker do not view this\nimmunity as absolute. They argue that a set of moral rules selected\nbecause of the good consequences of their adoption should include a\nrule that allows and indeed requires one to prevent disaster even if\nthat means breaking some other moral rule. Even such a stringent moral\nrule as the prohibition of deliberate use of violence against innocent\npeople may be overridden, if the disaster that cannot be prevented in\nany other way is grave enough. (See Brandt 1992: 87–88,\n150–51, 156–57; Hooker 2000: 98–99,\n127–36). There is thus some convergence at the level of\npractical conclusions between their understanding of the immunity of\ncivilians or common citizens and the “moral disaster”\nposition outlined above (2.3.2).","contact.mail":"igorprim@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
