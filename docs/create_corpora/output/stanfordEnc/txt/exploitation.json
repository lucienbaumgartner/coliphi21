It is to use\nanother person’s vulnerability for one’s own benefit. Of\ncourse, benefitting from another’s vulnerability is not always\nmorally wrong—we do not condemn a chess player for exploiting a\nweakness in his opponent’s defense, for instance. But some forms\nof advantage-taking do seem to be clearly wrong, and it is this\nnormative sense of exploitation that is of primary interest\nto moral and political philosophers.\n\n\nExploitation can be transactional or structural. In\nthe former case, the unfairness is a property of a discrete\ntransaction between two or more individuals. A sweatshop that pays low\nwages, for example, or a pharmaceutical research firm that tests drugs\non poor subjects in the developing world, might be said to exploit\nothers in this sense. But exploitation can also be\nstructural—a property of institutions or systems in\nwhich the “rules of the game” unfairly benefit one group\nof people to the detriment of another. As we will see below, Karl Marx\nbelieved that the economic and political institutions of capitalism\nwere exploitative in this sense. And some contemporary feminists have\nargued that the institution of traditional marriage is exploitative\ninsofar as it preys upon and reinforces pernicious forms of inequality\nbetween men and women (Sample 2003: Ch. 4).\n\n\nExploitation can also be harmful or mutually\nbeneficial. Harmful exploitation involves an interaction that\nleaves the victim worse off than she was, and than she was entitled to\nbe. The sort of exploitation involved in coercive sex trafficking, for\ninstance, is harmful in this sense. But as we will see below, not all\nexploitation is harmful. Exploitation can also be mutually beneficial,\nwhere both parties walk away better off than they were ex\nante. What makes such mutually beneficial interactions nevertheless\nexploitative is that they are, in some way, unfair.\n\n\nIt is relatively easy to come up with intuitively compelling cases of\nunfair, exploitative behavior. Providing a philosophical analysis to\nsupport and develop those intuitions, however, has proven more\ndifficult. The most obvious difficulty is specifying the conditions\nunder which a transaction or institution may be said to be unfair.\nDoes the unfairness involved in exploitation necessarily involve some\nkind of harm to its victim? Or a violation of her moral rights? Is the\nunfairness involved in exploitation a matter of procedure, substance,\nor both? And how, if at all, are facts about the history of the agents\ninvolved or the background conditions against which they operate\nrelevant to assessing charges of exploitation?\n\n\nAlthough the term “exploitation” appears not to have been\nused to describe unfair advantage-taking prior to the 19th\ncentury, there are nevertheless extensive discussions of the themes\nand problems that characterize contemporary discussions of\nexploitation in the history of philosophy. Those themes include the\nnotion of justice and injustice in economic exchange, the role of\nlabor in the creation of value, and the justification and abuse of\nprivate property, especially in capital and land. \nConcerns about exploitation often take the form of unfair economic\nexchange. Attempts to specify the principles that render an exchange\nfair or unfair can be traced back at least as far as Aristotle, who\nargued that a just exchange will embody a kind of reciprocity such\nthat the values of the goods exchanged are proportional\n(Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Part V). But while the notion of\nproportionality is intuitively appealing, it is somewhat unclear\nprecisely what Aristotle had in mind by it, or what the most\ndefensible explication of the idea would be. To borrow\nAristotle’s own example, if a shoemaker and a builder trade, how\nmany pairs of shoes is proportional to a single house? \nIn the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, we find the beginnings of a\nmuch more sophisticated and promising approach to questions such as\nthis. In his Summa Theologiae, Aquinas sought to answer the\nquestion of “whether a man may lawfully sell a thing for more\nthan it is worth?” The “worth” of a thing, for\nAquinas, was its just price. And the just price, according to Aquinas,\nappears to have been simply the prevailing market price (Summa\nTheologiae, part 2, second part, question 77; see also de Roover\n1958 and Friedman 1980). Rather than relying on some fixed notion of\nproportionality, Aquinas’ just price will be responsive to\nconsiderations of supply and demand. But not just any price\nthat two individuals mutually agree upon will be deemed just on\nAquinas’ standard. Thus, a seller who takes advantage of fraud,\nor a temporary monopoly, to charge an excessive price for an item\nwould be acting unjustly, insofar as his price is in excess of the\nprice at which similar goods typically sell in the relevant market.\nBut Aquinas saw nothing inherently sinful in selling a good for more\nthan one paid for it, or with charging enough to earn a profit, or to\ncompensate for risks involved in the productive process. Seeking\nprofit for its own sake may involve a certain sort of\n“debasement”, but profit can also be sought in order to\nfulfill necessary or even virtuous ends. \nLater Scholastics would devote considerable attention to developing\nand refining the notion of the just price. Of special concern was the\nprice attached to the lending of money, or interest. Since the\nfounding of the Catholic church, it was widely regarded as sinful for\nlenders to charge interest on their loans, and so-called\n“usury” was prohibited by canon and often by secular law.\nMuch of the concern regarding usury seems to have been driven by the\nidea that the charging of interest involves an inequitable\nexchange—lenders give something to borrowers, but demand back\nmore than they have given. But Aquinas seems to have been particularly\nconcerned that borrowers would often be driven to take out loans out\nof necessity, and thus that their consent to the exchange is not fully\nvoluntary (Summa Theologiae, part 2, second part, question\n78). \nThe much later natural law theorist John Locke also took up questions\nregarding just and unjust prices, not in either of his well-known\ntreatises on government but in a lesser known tract titled,\nVenditio. Locke, even more explicitly than Aquinas, saw the\njust price as being equivalent to “the market price at the place\nwhere he sells” (Locke 1661: 340). The relativity of the just\nprice to the particular market in which the transaction takes place is\nimportant. For Locke argued that if two ships sailed laden with corn,\none to Dunkirk where there is a near famine taking place, and the\nother to Ostend where normal conditions obtain, it would not be unjust\nfor the merchant to sell at a significantly higher price in the former\nlocation than in the latter (so long as the higher price is one that\nthe buyers can afford). If the merchant did not charge a\nhigher price, Locke argued, then two problems would result. First, it\nis likely that the merchant’s goods would simply be bought by\nspeculators and resold on a secondary market, thereby simply\nredirecting the profit into somebody else’s hands without doing\nanything to improve the situation of buyers. And second, if merchants\ncannot charge a high price in “good” markets to cover\ntheir losses in “bad” ones, they will soon operate at a\nnet loss and this will, Locke claims, “quickly put an end to\nmerchandising” (Locke 1661: 342). \nWhat would be unjust would be for the merchant to sell an\nitem to a particular individual for a price higher than the general\nmarket rate as might happen, for instance, if that individual is in\nparticular distress. Thus, Locke holds, if anchors typically sell for\na certain price, say 100 pounds, then it would be unjust\n(exploitative) to charge the captain of a distressed ship 5000 pounds\nfor an anchor, simply because one knows he will be compelled to pay\nit. The just price is the going market rate, where that rate is\ndetermined by the general features of supply and demand, and\nnot the particular needs or vulnerabilities of any particular buyer or\nseller. \nInterest in exploitation as a feature of economic exchange is thus\nalmost as old as philosophy itself. It was not until the\n19th century, however, that exploitation as a feature of\nemployment relationships came to be a subject of\nphilosophical and political concern. In a sense, of course, the\nemployment relationship is simply another instance of economic\nexchange, with the laborer selling his or her work in exchange for\nmoney in the form of wages. But two ideas led many people to think\nthat there was something special about labor. The first was a belief\nthat labor is the ultimate source of all economic value. The second\nwas the belief that labor morally entitles the laborer to the full\nvalue of that which he or she has produced. \nMore will be said about the first of these ideas in the discussion of\nMarx’s theory of exploitation, below. The second idea, and its\nconnection to the idea of labor exploitation, is perhaps best\nillustrated by the theory put forth by the 19th century\nliberal Thomas Hodgskin. For Hodgskin, as for Locke from whose ideas\nhe drew heavily, the right of private property is a natural,\npre-political right. That right consists in  \nthe right of individuals, to have and to own, for their own separate\nuse and enjoyment, the produce of their own industry, with\npower freely to dispose of the whole of that in the manner most\nagreeable to themselves. (Hodgkin 1832: 24)  \nBut while the natural right of property is based on labor, there is\nalso an artificial right of property that is based on nothing\nmore than legislative force. That artificial right cements in place,\nthrough the machinery of government, property claims that had their\norigins not in labor but in violence, conquest, and theft. And it\nthereby enables capitalists to profit without labor, simply by virtue\nof their (illegitimate) control of the means of production (Reeve\n1987b). \nFor Hodgskin, capitalists exploit workers in precisely the same way\nthat landlords exploit their tenants. In both cases, one person is\nentitled to a stream of revenue simply by virtue of their legal claim\nof ownership (Hodgskin 1832: 97). The money the landlord earns as rent\ncomes from the wages the tenant earns as a laborer, just as the money\nthe capitalist earns as profit comes from the sale of products\nproduced by his laborers. In both cases, one person is able to live as\na parasite off the productive activities of others, all because the\nstate actively suppresses the natural right of laborers to the full\nproduct of their labor, in favor of the artificial right of property\nestablished by violence. \nEven before Marx, then, we see in the 19th century a tight\nconnection between theories of exploitation and theories of class and\nof class conflict. Marx himself credited the “bourgeois\neconomists” of the French Industrialist school with\nhaving pioneered the economic analysis of class struggle (Marx\n& Engels 1965: 69). For members of that school, the two great\nclasses into which society was divided were productive\nlaborers and unproductive social parasites. The class of\nproductive laborers was understood broadly to encompass not only those\nwho exerted physical labor to create tangible goods and services, but\nanyone who worked to make goods more useful than they would otherwise\nbe—so laborers, yes, but also entrepreneurs,\narbitrageurs, and even capitalists in their role as managers\nand overseers of investments. The unproductive classes, in contrast,\nconsisted of those who consume value but do not produce it, such as\nthe army, the government, and the state-supported clergy (Raico 1977:\n395). \nAccording to Industrialists such as Charles Comte and Jean-Baptiste\nSay, the unproductive classes are able to maintain themselves by using\nthe coercive power of government to forcibly extract resources from\nthe productive. Taxes and tariffs were the most obvious forms such\n“plunder” could take, but the same goal could also be\nachieved by special protections for favored industries including the\nlimited conferral of monopoly power (Say 1964: 146–147). \nFor both Hodgskin and for the Industrialists, then, the state was a\nkey agent in facilitating the exploitation of one class of individuals\nby another, and the most certain way to end exploitation was therefore\nto sharply limit the power of the state and to strengthen the\n“natural” right of private property. But not all theorists\nof the 19th century saw things this way. For Ricardian\nSocialists such as John Bray, ending exploitation would require\nensuring that all persons have equal access to the means of\nproduction, and thereby guaranteeing a system of equal exchange based\non the labor theory of value (Bray 1839). While Hodgskin and the\nIndustrialists sought to purify capitalism from statist interference,\nBray and his fellow socialists sought to eliminate it altogether. \nBy far the most influential theory of exploitation ever set forth is\nthat of Karl Marx, who held that workers in a capitalist society are\nexploited insofar as they are forced to sell their labor power to\ncapitalists for less than the full value of the commodities they\nproduce with their labor. \nFor Marx, however, exploitation was a phenomenon that characterized\nall class-based societies, not only capitalism. Indeed, it is\nfeudal society, not capitalism, where the exploitative nature of class\nrelations is clearest. Under feudalism, it is readily apparent that\nserfs use some of their labor power for their own benefit, while\nanother part (the corvée) is used for the benefit of\nthe feudal lord. In contrast, under slavery workers appear to\nwork entirely for the benefit of their masters (though in reality a\npart of their labor goes toward providing for their own subsistence).\nAnd under capitalism workers appear to work entirely for the\nbenefit of themselves, selling their labor to capitalists as free\nindependent contractors (Cohen 1978: 332–3). \nIn reality, Marx thought, workers’ labor under capitalism is\nneither truly voluntary nor entirely for the benefit of the workers\nthemselves. It is not truly voluntary because workers are\nforced by their lack of ownership of the means of production\nto sell their labor power to capitalists or else starve. And workers\nare not laboring entirely for their own benefit because capitalists\nuse their privileged position to exploit workers,\nappropriating for themselves some of the value created by\nworkers’ labor. \nTo understand Marx’s charge of exploitation, it is first\nnecessary to understand Marx’s analysis of market prices, which\nhe largely inherited from earlier classical economists such as Adam\nSmith and David Ricardo. Under capitalism, Marx argued, workers’\nlabor power is treated as a commodity. And because Marx subscribed to\na labor theory of value, this means that just like any other commodity\nsuch as butter or corn, the price (or wage) of labor power is\ndetermined by its cost of production—specifically, by the\nquantity of socially necessary labor required to produce it. The cost\nof producing labor power is the value or labor-cost required for the\nconservation and reproduction of a worker’s labor power. In\nother words, Marx thought that workers under capitalism will therefore\nbe paid just enough to cover the bare necessities of living. They will\nbe paid subsistence wages. \nBut while labor power is just like any other commodity in terms of how\nits price is determined, it is unique in one very importance respect.\nLabor, and labor alone, according to Marx, has the capacity to\nproduce value beyond that which is necessary for its own\nreproduction. In other words, the value that goes into the commodities\nthat sustain a worker for a twelve-hour work day is less than the\nvalue of the commodities that worker can produce during those\ntwelve hours. This difference between the value a worker produces in a\ngiven period of time and the value of the consumption goods necessary\nto sustain the worker for that period is what Marx called surplus\nvalue. \nAccording to Marx, then, it is as though the worker’s day is\nsplit into two parts. During the first part, the laborer works for\nhimself, producing commodities the value of which is equal to the\nvalue of the wages he receives. During the second part, the laborer\nworks for the capitalist, producing surplus value for the capitalist\nfor which he receives no equivalent wages. During this second part of\nthe day, the laborer’s work is, in effect, unpaid, in precisely\nthe same way (though not as visibly) as a feudal serf’s\ncorvée is unpaid (Marx 1867). \nCapitalist exploitation thus consists in the forced appropriation by\ncapitalists of the surplus value produced by workers. Workers under\ncapitalism are compelled by their lack of ownership of the means of\nproduction to sell their labor power to capitalists for less than the\nfull value of the goods they produce. Capitalists, in turn, need not\nproduce anything themselves but are able to live instead off the\nproductive energies of workers. And the surplus value that capitalists\nare thereby able to appropriate from workers becomes the source of\ncapitalist profit, thereby “strengthening that very power whose\nslave it is” (Marx 1847: 40). \nIn the first volume of Capital, Marx presents a series of\nformulas representing a tight relationship between labor,\nexploitation, and capitalist profit. According to Marx, the value of a\ncommodity is a function of three factors: constant capital (\\(C\\), the\nlabor value of nonlabor means of production such as machines,\nbuildings, and raw materials), variable capital (\\(V\\), the labor\nvalue of the labor power of workers involved in production), and\nsurplus value (\\(S\\)). Since surplus value comes from the exploitation\nof labor (rather than machines or land), Marx defined the rate of\nexploitation as the ratio of surplus value over variable capital\n\\((S/V)\\). Of course, different industries will employ different mixes\nof labor and other factors of production—of variable and\nconstant capital. Marx referred to this mixture as the organic\ncomposition of capital, and defined it as \\(C/V\\). But since\ncapitalist profit is generated by the exploitation of labor, it seems\nto follow that industries that employ a greater proportion of labor\n(of variable over constant capital) should therefore earn a higher\nrate of profit. Thus, Marx defined the rate of profit as\n\\((S/(C+V))\\), which is equivalent to the rate of exploitation divided\nby the organic composition of \\(\\textrm{capital} + 1\\). This last\nproposition has been referred to by Jon Elster as the\n“fundamental equation of Marxian economics” (Elster 1986:\n67). \nMarx’s analysis of the rate of profit seems to entail that\nlabor-intensive industries will be more profitable than industries\nthat rely to a greater extent on constant capital. But this conclusion\nis clearly empirically false (Böhm-Bawerk 1898), and moreover\nincompatible with Marx’s assumption of a competitive economy in\nwhich investments will adjust so as to equalize the rate of profit\nbetween industries (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Buchanan 1985: Ch. 3). Marx\nhimself recognized this fact, and sought to address it in the third\nvolume of Capital by dropping the assumption of volume 1 that\nvalue and price are equivalent, and showing instead\nhow value can be transformed into price through some more\ncomplicated process. Whether Marx’s attempted solution to this\n“transformation problem” was successful, however, is a\nmatter of great controversy (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Samuelson 1971;\nKliman 2007). \nMarx’s theory of exploitation appears to presuppose that labor\nis the source of all value. But the labor theory of value to which\nMarx and early classical economists subscribed is subject to a number\nof apparently insurmountable difficulties, and has largely been\nabandoned by economists in the wake of the marginalist revolution of\nthe 1870s. The most obvious difficulty stems from the fact that labor\nis heterogeneous. Some labor is skilled, some labor is unskilled, and\nthere does not appear to be any satisfactory way of reducing the\nformer to the latter and thereby establishing a single standard of\nmeasure for the value of commodities. Moreover, the labor theory of\nvalue appears to be unable to account for the economic value of\ncommodities such as land and raw materials that are not and could not\nbe produced by any human labor. Finally, and perhaps most fatally,\nMarx’s assumption that labor has the unique power to create\nsurplus value is entirely ungrounded. As Robert Paul Wolff has argued,\nMarx’s focus on labor appears to be entirely arbitrary. A\nformally identical theory of value could be constructed with\nany commodity taking the place of labor, and thus a\n“corn theory of value” would be just as legitimate, and\njust as unhelpful, as Marx’s labor theory of value (Wolff 1981).\nTherefore, if, as some have alleged, Marx’s theory of\nexploitation is dependent on the truth of the labor theory of value,\nthen a rejection of the labor theory of value should entail a\nrejection of Marx’s theory of exploitation as well (Nozick 1974;\nArnold 1990). \nNot everyone agrees, however, that Marx’s theory is\ndependent on the labor theory of value in this way. G.A. Cohen, for\ninstance, argues that Marx’s theory of exploitation is not only\nindependent of the labor theory of value, but incompatible\nwith it (Cohen 1979: 345–6). Marx’s account of\nexploitation is premised on the claim that value created by workers is\nappropriated by capitalists. But the labor theory of value holds that\nthe value of an object is a function of the labor that would be\ncurrently required to produce it, regardless of how much\nlabor actually went into producing it. Paradoxical as it may seem, the\nlabor theory of value is incompatible with the claim that labor alone\ncreates value. \nThe real problem with exploitation, on Cohen’s view, is not that\ncapitalists appropriate value that is created by labor. It\nis, rather, that capitalists appropriate some of the value of the\nproducts that are created by labor. Labor may not produce\nvalue, but it is the only thing that produces what has value,\nand this is all Marx needs to get his account of exploitation off the\nground (Cohen 1979: 354). \nBut even if Cohen’s account of exploitation avoids commitment to\nthe labor theory of value, it nevertheless remains committed to the\nMarxian idea that exploitation should be understood as the forced\nappropriation of surplus value. And there are at least two respects in\nwhich this commitment is problematic. First, it is unclear whether\nexploitation necessarily involves the forced transfer of\nsurplus value. Marx’s account asserts that the laborer is forced\nto work for capitalists because the only alternative is starvation.\nBut suppose the government provides a safety net sufficient to ensure\nthat workers’ subsistence needs are met. If someone chooses to\nwork in order to earn discretionary income, it still seems possible\nthat they could be exploited by a capitalist who appropriates some of\nthe value of the product the laborer creates (Kymlicka 2002: 179). A\nlaborer can be exploited, we might think, by being paid an\nunfair wage even if that laborer is not forced to\nwork. \nSecond, it is unclear whether all cases involving the forced transfer\nof surplus value are necessarily exploitative, at least in the\nordinary sense of involving a moral wrong. Suppose that governments\ntax workers and use some of the proceeds to provide support for\nchildren or the infirm. If it is exploitative for capitalists to\nappropriate some of the value of the objects produced by workers, is\nit not also exploitative for government to do so through the mechanism\nof taxation? Some libertarians have argued that this is precisely how\nwe should understand the coercive power of government. For Cohen,\nhowever, the fact that Marx’s account of exploitation appears to\nbe committed to the libertarian idea of that workers own their labor\nand the products they produce with that labor—that is, to the\nlibertarian idea of self-ownership—is deeply problematic (Cohen\n1995: Ch. 6). \nIn its broadest sense, transactional/micro-level exploitation involves\nan agent, A, taking unfair advantage of another agent,\nB. Taking unfair advantage, in turn, can be understood in two\nways. First, it can refer to some dimension of the outcome of the\nexploitative act or transaction. In this case, we say that the\ntransaction is substantively unfair. Second, to say that\nA takes unfair advantage of B may imply that there is\nsome sort of defect in the process by which the unfair outcome has\ncome about, for example, that A has coerced B or\ndefrauded B or has manipulated B. In this case, we say\nthat the transaction is procedurally unfair. \nThis section examines several elements or possible elements of\ntransactional exploitation: the benefit that exploitative transactions\nconfer upon A, the harm they cause to B, various notions\nof substantive and procedural unfairness, and the unjust background\nconditions against which exploitative transactions may take place. \nWhen A exploits B, A gains some benefit\nfrom interacting with B. We can see the relevance of the\n“benefit to A” by contrasting exploitation with\nother forms of wrongdoing, such as discrimination, abuse, and\noppression. Let us say that A discriminates against B\nwhen A wrongly deprives B of some opportunity or benefit\nbecause of some characteristic of B that is not relevant to\nA’s action. There was a period in American history in\nwhich many women became public school teachers because they were\ndenied the opportunity to enter other professions such as law and\nmedicine. To the extent that society benefitted (in one way) from the\npool of highly qualified public school teachers, the discrimination\nmay have been exploitative, even if unintentionally so. But if\nA refuses to hire B solely because of B’s\nrace, then it would be odd to say that A exploits B, for\nA does not gain from the wrong to B. \nConsider abuse. It has been alleged that medical students are\nfrequently abused by verbal insults and denigration and that this\nabuse may leave long-lasting emotional scars. It is also sometimes\nclaimed that medical interns are exploited, that they work long hours\nfor low pay. The contrast is just right. There is no reason to think\nthat anyone gains (in any normal sense) from abuse, but it is at least\nplausible to think that the hospitals or patients gain from the\nexploitation of interns. \nLet us say that A oppresses B when A deprives\nB of freedoms or opportunities to which B is entitled.\nIf A gains from the oppressive relationship, as when A\nenslaves B, then A may both oppress and exploit\nB. But if A does not gain from the oppression, the\noppression is wrong but not exploitative. We might say that the\nunemployed are oppressed, but unless we could specify the ways in\nwhich some gain from their lack of employment, the unemployed are not\nexploited. Marxists would claim that capitalists pay exploitative\nwages to the employed precisely because there is a “reserve\narmy” of the unemployed with whom the employed must compete. But\nthat merely confirms that they are exploited because the oppression\ngenerates a gain to the capitalist class, and it is the employed who\nare exploited and not the unemployed that make such exploitation\npossible. \nClearly, an exchange still counts as exploitative even if A\ndoes not benefit on net. If A derives unfair benefit\nfrom his interaction with B, but suffers unforeseen costs such\nthat she ends up worse-off after the interaction than she was before,\nthen A has still exploited B. Less clear is the question\nof whether A must derive any actual benefit at all, or whether\nit is enough that A merely intend to benefit. Suppose\na sweatshop owner works his employees ruthlessly in order to extract\nas much profit as he can from the workers’ labor, but that the\nproduct the laborers produce turns out, due to an unforeseen turn of\nevents, to have zero market value. Have the sweatshop workers\nnevertheless been exploited?  \nRelated to the question of whether A’s intent to benefit\nis sufficient for exploitation is the question of whether\nA’s intent to benefit unfairly is\nnecessary for exploitation. Is it possible to exploit someone\nby mistake? Can one foresee that one’s interaction will be\nexploitative without intending it to be so? If so, is A still\nculpable? (Ferguson 2016b) \nExploitation thus involves A unfairly benefitting from an\ninteraction with B. But what exactly does it mean to benefit\nunfairly? One natural response to this question is to\nconceive of unfairness as benefitting A at B’s\nexpense. Perhaps exploitation advances the interests of\nA while harming B. Exploitation, thus\nunderstood, is a kind of parasitism. Or, as Allen Buchanan defines it,\nexploitation is “the harmful, merely instrumental utilization of\nhim or his capacities, for one’s own advantage or for the sake\nof one’s own ends” (Buchanan 1985: 87). \nCertain paradigmatic cases of exploitation clearly fit this analysis.\nSlavery is an exploitative relationship, and one that clearly harms\nslaves for the benefit of their masters. But as Alan Wertheimer has\nnoted, some exploitation appears to be mutually advantageous\nrather than harmful (Wertheimer 1996: 14). Someone who charges a hiker\nlost in the desert $1,000 for a bottle of water takes unfair advantage\nof her. Nevertheless, the transaction is one from which both\nparties emerge better off relative to how they would have been, had\nthe transaction not taken place. The seller has traded away something\nshe values less (the bottle of water) for something she values more\n($1,000). But so has the buyer. If the water is necessary to save her\nlife, and if she values her life more than the $1,000 she gives up to\nsave it, then she too is better off with the transaction than without\nit. \nIn this way, exploitation is importantly different from coercion, even\nthough both coercion and exploitation can involve individuals\naccepting proposals that appear to make them better off relative to\nsome baseline. In a paradigmatic case of coercion—a mugger who\ndemands “your money or your life”—the victim is\nbetter off handing over the money than losing her life. But she would\nbe better off still if the mugger had never showed up to make her\nproposal at all. In contrast, the stranded hiker would be considerably\nworse off if her exploiter never showed up. Coercion\ncharacteristically involves threats by which the coercer\nproposes to make her victim worse off unless she does as the\ncoercer demands. Exploitation, in contrast, often involves\noffers by which the exploiter proposes to make her victim\nbetter off if she does as the exploiter proposes. \nThere is, however, one important sense in which even an exploiter\ncould be said to harm her victim. Relative to a baseline of no\ntransaction at all, exploitation often makes its victim better off.\nBut relative to a baseline of a fair transaction,\nexploitation leaves its victim worse off. In this sense, an\nexploiter’s gain does, contra Joel Feinberg, come at the\nvictim’s expense (Feinberg 1988: 178). For even when both\nparties gain from the transaction, the victim of exploitation gains\nless than she should because some of the “cooperative\nsurplus” to which she is by fairness entitled has been captured\nby the exploiter. \nExploitation therefore does not necessarily harm its victim in the\nsense of making her worse off than she would have been, had the\nexploiter never interacted with her at all. Rather, it makes its\nvictim worse off than she should have been, had she been\ntreated fairly. As with similar cases involving coercion, the precise\ndetails of our analysis thus depend on the relevant baseline against\nwhich we choose to compare B’s situation after the\ninteraction. But these details probably do not matter much as far as\nour all-things-considered moral evaluation is concerned. Whether we\nchoose to say that exploitation involves A making B\nbetter off, but not as much better off as A should have made\nB; or whether we say that it involves making B worse off\nthan B should have been, the final verdict is the same\n(Wertheimer 1996: 22–23). \nIn the sense in which we are using the term, exploitation necessarily\n(conceptually) involves unfairness. Our sense of exploitation is thus\na moralized term. To judge that someone is engaged in\nexploitation is already to pass a moral judgment on them—to say\nthat they are acting wrongly (at least in a pro tanto sense).\nNot all uses of “exploitation” are moralized in this way.\nAs we noted at the beginning of this entry, some ordinary language use\nof the term implies no moral judgment whatsoever. And it is possible\nto develop a philosophically sophisticated account of exploitation\nthat is relevant to moral judgment, without being moralized\n(Goodin 1987). \nStill, even if exploitation is not conceptually unfair, it is\ncharacteristically so. In some cases, this unfairness is the result of\nsome procedural defect in the transaction—call this\nprocedural unfairness. In other cases, the unfairness is a\nfeature of what is agreed to, rather than how the agreement\nis reached—call this substantive unfairness. \nA transaction will be exploitative due to procedural unfairness when\nA unfairly utilizes or creates a defect in the process of the\ntransaction with B in way that benefits A at\nB’s expense (though see the previous section for an\nanalysis of “at B’s expense”). So, for\ninstance, if A deceives B regarding the nature of the\ngood A is selling, in a way that leads B to pay more for\nthat good than B otherwise would have, we can say that A\nhas taken unfair advantage of B—that A has\nexploited B. Or if A unfairly pressures B to\nagree to A’s proposed terms—threatening to\nphysically hurt B or someone B loves, for\ninstance—we can again say that A has exploited\nB. \nBut while we can (correctly) say that A has exploited\nB in these situations, we could also say, more directly and\nmore clearly, that A has defrauded or coerced\nB. That is, we already have a rich set of more\nnarrowly-tailored terms for identifying the ways in which A\nmight undermine the validity of B’s consent to the terms\nof their agreement. For this reason, it seems superfluous—and\nindeed, it is rare—to describe these sorts of procedural defects\nas “exploitative”. At least when A creates\nthe defect from which he benefits, we usually have a better term\navailable to describe the specific form of his wrongdoing. \nThe label “exploitation” seems more appropriate when\nA unfairly takes advantage of an existing defect\n(Jansen and Wall 2013). A teenage boy who trades five pennies for his\n5 year-old brother’s single quarter exploits his brother insofar\nas he takes unfair advantage of his ignorance of monetary units. But\nhe does not coerce him, nor does he necessarily deceive him.\nSimilarly, a psychotherapist who takes advantage of his\npatient’s therapy-induced romantic feelings to engage in sexual\nrelations can be said to exploit his patient, even if there is no\noutright fraud or deception in the interaction (and even if the\nsubstantive “terms” of their relationship are in no way\nunfair). In these cases, exploitation seems to be the most apt\ndescription for the wrongdoing. \nThere is widespread agreement among philosophers and legal theorists\non the broad categories of behavior that render a transaction\nprocedurally unfair, even if there is (as always) persistent\ndisagreement about borderline cases of coercion, fraud, etc. In\ncontrast, there is much less agreement regarding those conditions that\nrender a transaction substantively unfair. \nOne of the most intuitively appealing criteria of fairness in exchange\nis equality. A fair exchange, it is tempting to say, is an\nequal exchange. But equal in terms of what? \nAlthough Marx took pains to deny he was giving an account of justice\n(let alone fairness), much of the intuitive force of his account of\nlabor exploitation seems to rely on the idea that a fair exchange will\nembody equal transfers of socially necessary labor. It is\nbecause the objects produced by the worker embody more socially\nnecessary labor than the wages he receives in exchange for producing\nthose objects that the laborer is exploited. And other\nlate-19th century theorists such as Josiah Warren and\nStephen Pearl Andrews made this moral claim explicit. “It is\nclear”, wrote Andrews,  \nif [an] exchange is not equal, if one party gives more of his own\nlabor—either in the form of labor or product—than he\ngets of the labor of the other…that he is oppressed,\nand becomes, so far as this inequality goes, the slave or subject of\nthe other. (Andrews 1852: 52–53)  \nBut even though a theory of labor-time as the basis of fair exchange\nis in principle distinguishable from a labor theory of economic value,\nthe former is subject to many of the same problems as the latter. How,\nfor instance, should the difference between skilled and unskilled\nlabor time be accounted for in determining a fair exchange? Between\neasy and difficult labor? Labor is not homogenous, and this makes it\nill-suited to serve as a currency of fair exchange. \nIf labor is the wrong place to look for a criterion of fair exchange,\nperhaps economic value would be better. A fair trade, on this\nview, involves the exchange of equally valuable goods or services. And\nan unfair trade involves the exchange of goods or services of unequal\nvalue. To return to an earlier example, someone who sells a bottle of\nwater to a hiker stranded in the desert for $1,000 takes unfair\nadvantage of her. And part of what makes the exchange unfair is that\nthe bottle of water simply isn’t worth nearly $1,000. B\nis giving up far more than she gains in exchange. \nOr is she? Once we give up on the 19th century notion that\neconomic value is an objective property of commodities, and embrace\ninstead that value is a function of the subjective preferences of\neconomic agents, the problem with this analysis becomes readily\napparent. Economic exchange is only possible precisely because\ndifferent agents assign different values to the same object. I sell\nyou my old television for $75 because I’ve bought a new set, and\nto me, the old television is worth less than the $75. You pay the $75\nbecause you just moved into a new place and, to you, the $75 is worth\nless than the television. Neither of our valuations is the\n“right” one. Our preferences simply differ, and so it is\npossible for us to both walk away from the deal\nbelieving—correctly!—that we have gotten more than we have\ngiven up. \nCooperative exchanges create what economists call a “social\nsurplus”. Suppose, to continue the television example, that\nI’d be willing to take anything equal to or greater than $50 in\nexchange for my television, and that you’d be willing to pay\nanything equal to or less than $100 for it. If, after bargaining, we\narrive at a sale price of $75, then I give up something I value at\n$50 in exchange for $75, and come away $25 richer, and you give up $75 in exchange for something you value at $100 and\nwalk away $25 richer. All together, we’re $50 richer.\nThat’s the social surplus. \nThis suggests one final possible egalitarian analysis of fair\nexchange. Perhaps what makes an exchange is fair is not that the\nobjects traded have equal economic value, but rather the equal\ndivision of the social surplus created by the exchange of objects of\nunequal subjective value. Exploitative exchanges, in contrast, are\nthose in which one party commands a disproportionately large share of\nthe social surplus, leaving the other party with an unfairly small\nshare. For example, suppose that an employer gains $10 per hour worth\nof value from an employee’s labor. An employer like that could\nafford to pay its workers $9 per hour and still make a profit. But if\npotential employees have nowhere else to go, why should the employer\npay that much? Why not pay employees as little as she can get away\nwith—maybe $3 an hour, just barely over the subsistence level of\n$2? In this case the employment relationship would generate a social\nsurplus of $8. But $7 of that surplus would go into the pocket of the\nemployer, while only $1 goes to the laborer. Might not that lopsided\ndivision of the social surplus be precisely what’s unfair, and\nthus exploitative, about this kind of labor? \nPerhaps. But the unequal division of the social surplus cannot explain\nall cases of exploitation—including some of the most\nparadigmatic. To see this, let us return once more to the case of the\nlost desert hiker. A offers to sell B a bottle of water\nfor $1,000. This would appear to be a clear instance of an\nexploitative proposal. But it is not, as suggested above, because the\nwater bottle is worth less than $1,000 to B. Indeed,\nit is probably worth far more! Most people put a fairly high value on\ntheir continued existence. So, suppose B values not dying at $1\nmillion. In that case, B gives up something he values at $1,000\nin exchange for something he values at $1 million. A, in turn,\ngives up something he values at close to $0 in exchange for something\nhe values at $1,000. The exchange creates a social surplus of $1\nmillion, but fully 99.9% of that surplus goes to B,\nleaving A with a mere .1%. If exploitation consists of grabbing\nthe lion’s share of the social surplus of an exchange, then we\nare forced to conclude that thirsty B is actually exploiting\nwater-selling A—an unlikely result! \nIt is thus difficult to specify an egalitarian criterion of fairness\nthat explains the wrongfulness of exploitation across a range of\ncases. For this reason, most current theories of exploitation are not\nfundamentally egalitarian in nature. Some, like those put forward by\nAllen Wood, Ruth Sample, and Jeremy Snyder, are based in the Kantian\nidea of respect for persons. Sample, for instance, defines\nexploitation as “interacting with another being for the sake of\nadvantage in a way that fails to respect the inherent value in that\nbeing” (Sample 2003: 57). According to Sample, one can fail to\nrespect the inherent value of others in several distinct ways. One way\ninvolves failing to respond appropriately to the unmet basic needs of\nothers. Respect for others imposes upon us an imperfect duty of\nbeneficence, a duty that Jeremy Snyder argues is\n“specified” when we come face to face with particular\nothers and thereby takes on a perfect, strict form (Snyder 2008: 390).\nWhen we encounter others whose basic needs are unmet, we should help\nthem because of the inherent value they possess as a human being. But\nthe exploiter sees in the unmet basic needs of others not a cry for\nhelp but as an opportunity for profit. \nSample’s and Snyder’s respect-based accounts are\nsimultaneously more narrow and more broad than fairness-based accounts\nof exploitation. They are broader insofar as they will condemn as\nexploitative transactions that might pass as non-exploitative on a\nfairness approach. Selling a bottle of water at a normal market price\nto the hiker lost in the desert, for instance, might be fair but still\ninsufficiently responsive to the hiker’s unmet basic need for\ndrink. But the accounts are also considerably narrower than\nfairness-based accounts insofar as the range of goods or transactions\nto which they apply is more circumscribed. On both Sample’s and\nSnyder’s accounts, for instance, it is not wrongfully\nexploitative for a seller to use his knowledge of a buyer’s\nunusually strong desire for a painting to charge that buyer an\nextremely high price. Because the buyer’s basic needs are not\nimplicated, charging a high price in this sort of cases does not\nsignal disrespect for persons, even if the price is one that would\notherwise appear to be unfairly high. \nSample’s account, like Goodin’s, holds that taking\nadvantage of certain kinds of vulnerability is wrongfully exploitative\nregardless of how those vulnerabilities came about. But as Benjamin\nFerguson has noted, this has the potential to create a certain kind of\nmoral hazard problem (Ferguson 2016b). Suppose that A knows\nthat, should he become vulnerable for whatever reason, B will\nbe obligated to constrain B’s advantage over\nA—perhaps by selling B goods for less than the\nnormal market price. Given this knowledge, A might be tempted\nto take a risky gamble, knowing that if it doesn’t turn out\nwell, B will be obligated to partly subsidize A’s\nloss. In effect, B’s obligation toward A puts\nB in a position of vulnerability, a vulnerability that A\nhas the potential to unfairly take advantage of. In other words,\nA’s obligation not to exploit B renders A\nvulnerable to exploitation by B! In order to avoid\nthis difficulty, it seems necessary to limit the kinds of\nvulnerabilities that trigger the obligation to constrain one’s\nadvantage, perhaps by ruling out vulnerabilities for which the agent\nis morally responsible. \nMany have found plausible Marx’s claim that employment\nrelationships under capitalism are exploitative. But perhaps Marx was\nwrong to locate that exploitation in the particular details of the\ncapitalist-employee relationship. After all, what makes exploitation\npossible at all on Marx’s view is a feature of the macro level\ndistribution of property in society—specifically\ncapitalists’ monopoly over the means of production. Marx’s\nformal theory of exploitation, however, makes no explicit mention of\nthis property relation, focusing instead entirely on the interaction\nbetween capitalists and laborers at the point of production. The\nresult, according to John Roemer, is a theory that is focused too much\non the micro level of particular employment relationships and not\nenough on the macro level background of inegalitarian property\ndistribution against which those relationships take place (Roemer\n1982). \nOn Roemer’s analysis, capitalist exploitation is essentially a\nform of social parasitism. One group (the capitalists) are made better\noff by the existence of a second group (workers), but that second\ngroup is made worse off by the existence of the first. More\nformally, according to Roemer’s account, we may say that a group\n\\(S\\) is exploited by \\(S'\\) if and only if all of the following three\nconditions are satisfied: \nSuppose workers form the coalition \\(S\\), and capitalists form the\ncoalition \\(S'\\). Workers are exploited, on Roemer’s view,\nbecause property rights in the means of production are monopolized by\ncapitalists. If workers were to withdraw from society with a per\ncapita share of society’s alienable assets, including the\nmeans of production, they would be better off than they are right now\n (condition 1\n is satisfied). If capitalists were to withdraw with only\ntheir per capita share of society’s alienable assets, they would\nbe worse off since some of their currently held share would go to\nworkers\n (condition 2\n is satisfied). Finally, if workers to withdraw from society with only\nthe assets to which they are entitled under their existing legal\nregime—their bodies and their labor—then capitalists would\nbe worse off, since they would no longer be able to profit by\nexploiting workers labor\n (condition 3\n is satisfied). What this shows is that the existing distribution of\nproperty makes capitalists better off at workers’ expense. It is\na parasitic, exploitative arrangement. \nRoemer’s account coheres well with the intuitive sense of\nexploitation as unfair treatment over a wide range of cases. In cases\nwhere we think that an inegalitarian distribution of property has been\nunjustly produced, then a system that puts that distribution\nto use to benefit one class at the expense of another will seem\nwrongfully exploitative. This, presumably, is the point of\nMarx’s account of the “primitive accumulation” of\ncapital, which aims to show that capitalists’ monopoly over the\nmeans of production is the product of violence and theft rather than\nhard work and thrift (Marx 1867: Ch. 26). \nBut even if actually existing capitalism’s history is tainted in\nthis way, it is possible to imagine an inegalitarian distribution of\nproperty emerging, in Robert Nozick’s language, “from a\njust situation by just steps” (Nozick 1974: 151). Suppose a\nsociety begins with an egalitarian distribution and evolves, through a\nmix of voluntary choices and luck—but no procedural injustices\nsuch as force or fraud—into a society with significant\ninequalities. Such a society might contain a relatively poor coalition\n\\(S\\) that would do better if it appropriated some of the alienable\nproperty belonging to relatively wealthy \\(S'\\) and withdrew with a\nper capita share of society’s alienable assets\n (condition 1).\n And \\(S'\\) would, in turn, be worse off if it was able to withdraw\nwith only a per capita share of those assets\n (condition 2).\n Finally, if \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are engaged in mutually beneficial\nexchange in the present society, then \\(S'\\) might well be worse off\nif \\(S\\) were to withdraw from society, even if \\(S\\) took only its\nown assets\n (condition 3).\n A society such as this satisfies all of Roemer’s conditions for\nexploitation. But it is far from clear that there is anything wrongful\nor unjust in it. \nRoemer’s account also runs into the same difficulty as those\nMarxist accounts that view the forced transfer of surplus value as\nnecessarily exploitative. It seems forced to condemn a society in\nwhich the able-bodied and well-off are taxed to support children and\nthe infirm as exploitative, since the able-bodied would be better off\nif they withdrew with their own resources, while children and the\ninform would be worse off (Elster 1982). Roemer attempts to grapple\nwith this problem by stipulating that exploitation involves something\nmore than the satisfaction of\n conditions 1 through 3,\n and suggests that the missing condition might be a relationship of\n“dominance” of the exploiter over the exploited. But as\nWill Kymlicka has noted, this stipulation seems  \nad hoc, since [it is] disconnected from the ‘ethical\nimperative’ that [Roemer] identifies as the basis of\nexploitation theory (Kymlicka 2002: 204 n. 13). And Roemer himself\nadmits that lack of clarity regarding the concept of dominance\nprevents his account from being a “satisfactory analytical\naccount of exploitation. (Roemer 1982: 304 n. 12). \nEven if Roemer’s account were entirely satisfactory on its own\nterms, however, it would still seem to leave a large, important class\nof questions about exploitation unanswered. Precisely because\nRoemer’s account is focused on “macro” issues\npertaining to the distribution of property in society, it has little\nto say about “micro” issues regarding how individuals\ntreat each other within the framework created by that distribution\n(Ferguson and Steiner 2016: 13–14). Intuitively, it seems\npossible for individuals to treat each other exploitatively even\nwithin a just distribution of property; and it likewise seems possible\nfor individuals to treat each other fairly within an unjust\ndistribution of property. That Roemer’s account does not address\nthese issues of micro-level treatment is not necessarily a flaw in the\ntheory. But it does suggest, at the very least, that a different or\nmore comprehensive theory of exploitation is necessary to supplement\nRoemer’s exclusively macro-level approach. \nGiijs van Donselaar’s account of exploitation is based on the\nidea that exploitation is a form of harmful parasitism. An\nexploitative relationship, for Donselaar, is one that involves\n“worsening the position of others in bettering one’s\nown” (van Donselaar 2009: 7). In such a relationship, A uses and benefits\nfrom B, but B would be better off if A had never\nexisted or never interacted with him at all. So, for example, if\nA homesteads a plot of land by mixing his labor with it only\nbecause he knows B wants the land and will be willing to pay\nhim a large sum of money for it, then A exploits B in\nthe Donselaarian sense. Or, similarly, if A proposes to build a\nsecond story to his home only because his neighbor B will be\nwilling to pay him not to do it in order to preserve his view, then\nA exploits B. In cases like these, A acts within\nhis rights, but he “abuses” his rights to extract benefits\nfrom B. \nIntuitively, there seems to be something unfair about the kinds of\nactivities van Donselaar has identified as exploitative. But there are\nalso activities that satisfy his criteria for exploitation that do not\nseem intuitively unfair. Many cases of ordinary market competition,\nfor instance, involve situations of this sort. Suppose that A\nand B compete for a job and that A, being the more\nhighly qualified candidate, is offered the position. A accepts,\nand then offers B a job as her secretary. In this situation,\nA gains by interacting with B, but B would be\nbetter off if A never existed at all. Likewise, if B is\na disabled citizen who is offered a taxpayer-financed stipend by the\ngovernment, then B benefits from the existence of taxpayer\nA, while A is worse off than she would be if B\nhad never existed. As Richard Arneson notes, “one man’s\nparasitism is another man’s distributive justice” (Arneson\n2013: 9). \nThe second challenge faced by van Donselaar is nearly identical to a\ndifficulty we discussed above with John Roemer’s\nproperty-relations account of exploitation. And as we have seen,\nRoemer himself suggested one way of avoiding the\ndifficulty—namely, adding a dominance condition to his\naccount of exploitation. Intuitively, capitalists at least have the\ncapacity to dominate their employees, but disabled people\nliving on a pension do not dominate taxpayers, nor do they have the\ncapacity to do so. \nNicholas Vrousalis elaborates on what he sees as a tight connection\nbetween the concepts of exploitation and domination (Vrousalis 2013).\nAccording to Vrousalis, A exploits B if and only if\nA and B are embedded in a systematic relationship in\nwhich A instrumentalizes B’s vulnerability to\nextract a net benefit from B. And A dominates B\nif A and B are embedded in a systematic relationship in\nwhich A takes advantage of his power over B, or the\npower of a coalition of agents A belongs to, in a way that is\ndisrespectful to B. Exploitation, then, is a particular form of\ndomination—domination for self-enrichment. Capitalists exploit\nworkers insofar as they treat workers as objects, using their power\nand workers’ vulnerability to extract value from workers, all\nembedded in the systematic relationships of a capitalist economy. \nVrousalis’s focus on systems is intended to\nrehabilitate the most defensible elements of a broadly Marxian theory\nof exploitation, and to establish exploitation as a concept distinct\nfrom mere unfairness (Vrousalis 2014). But divorcing exploitation from\nunfairness has its cost, for there are examples that fit\nVrousalis’s schema for exploitation that do not seem unfair, and\nbecause they do not seem unfair, do not seem wrongful. If A is\na monopoly provider of heating oil, and B lives in a cold\nclimate, A has power over B and B is vulnerable.\nBut, intuitively, A does not have to take advantage of\nthat vulnerability. A could sell to B at a fair\nprice—i.e., a price lower than the maximum price that B\nwould, if necessary, be willing to pay. If she does so, A will\nstill extract a net benefit from B, thereby satisfying\nVrousalis’s definition of exploitation. But it is far from\nobvious that A will have acted in any way wrongly (Arneson\n2013: 4). \nIn addition to failing to respond appropriately to others’ basic\nneeds, Sample also argues that exploitation can take the form of\ntaking advantage of past injustice (Sample 2003: 74). If A uses\nthe fact that B is disadvantaged as a result of past injustice\nfor his own profit then, Sample argues, A has failed to treat\nB with respect and has exploited him for his own gain. \nIn setting forth this claim, Sample builds a certain\nhistorical element into her account of exploitation. What\nmatters, on her view, is not merely whether a person in a position of\nvulnerability is taken advantage of, but how it came about\nthat such advantage-taking was possible. \nOther exploitation theorists have made similar claims. Hillel\nSteiner’s account of exploitation, for example, holds that\nexploitation occurs when A gains more from an interaction, and\nB gains less, than they would have were it not for the\nexistence of a prior injustice (Steiner 1984). So, for example, if\nA hires B as a laborer and is able to pay B a low\nwage of $2 per hour only because A (or someone else) has\npreviously unjustly deprived B of alternative sources of labor,\nthen A has exploited B. If, on the other hand, the\nexplanation for B’s earning only $2 does not\ninvolve injustice—if B simply does not have very valuable\nskills, or if there is a large supply of (not unjustly) unemployed\nlaborers, then a $2 wage, no matter how insufficient it might be to\nmeet B’s needs, and no matter how much more A\ncould afford to pay, is not exploitative. \nOn the other hand, some theorists have argued that the source of\nvulnerability is irrelevant to the exploitative nature of a\ntransaction. Robert Goodin, for instance, argues that exploitation\nconsists in “playing for advantage in situations where it is\ninappropriate to do so”, and involves a violation of the moral\nnorm of “protecting the vulnerable”. Importantly, Goodin\nholds that this norm applies “regardless of the particular\nsource of their vulnerability” (Goodin 1987: 187). Thus, whether\na worker is economically vulnerable because of a past injustice or\nwhether her vulnerability derives from a normal fluctuation of the\nbusiness cycle is irrelevant. To use that vulnerability to press\none’s own advantage is exploitative. \nSimilarly, Matt Zwolinski argues that whether an exchange is\nexploitative or not depends on the terms of the transaction itself,\nnot on how the parties came to be in their respective ex ante\npositions. Cases like the desert hiker, Zwolinski argues, show that\nexploitation can occur in the absence of past injustice and thus that\ntaking advantage of past injustice is not a necessary component of\nexploitation. And neither is it a sufficient condition, for we can\nimagine cases where parties gain from past injustice without thereby\nengaging in exploitation. If B’s home is unjustly burned\nto the ground by an arsonist, and a contractor A charges\nB a normal market price to rebuild it, then A has not\nexploited B, despite the fact that A has profited from\nthe injustice suffered by B (Zwolinski 2012: 172). \nThe primary task of a theory of exploitation is to set forward the\ntruth conditions for the claim, “A exploits\nB”. Beyond this purely conceptual project, however, there\nremain two more straightforwardly normative tasks. Adopting\nterminology from Alan Wertheimer, we can describe the first of these\ntasks as providing an account of the moral weight of\nexploitation, where moral weight refers to the intensity of\nexploitation’s wrongness. The second task is to provide an\naccount of the moral force of exploitation, where moral force\nis understood to refer to “the various moral upshots of reasons\nfor action that exploitation might or might not involve for parties to\nthe transaction or for society” (Wertheimer 1996: 28).  \nWhen exploitation is harmful and nonconsensual, issues of both moral\nweight and force are relatively unproblematic. Whatever the added\nmoral importance of the gain to A from the harm to B, it\nis certainly at least prima facie wrong for A to harm\nB and it seems that the state is at least prima facie\njustified in prohibiting or refusing to enforce such transactions. But\nexploitation that takes place in the context of mutually advantageous\nand consensual transactions presents a more difficult set of problems.\nFirst, regarding the issue of moral weight, it might be thought that\neven if a transaction between A and B is unfair, there\ncan be nothing seriously wrong about an agreement from which\nboth parties benefit, particularly if A has no obligation to\nenter into any transaction with B. At the very least, it seems\ndifficult to show how a mutually advantageous (but unfair) interaction\ncan be morally worse than no-interaction at all since, ex\nhypothesi, there is no party to the transaction for whom it is\nworse. In the recent literature on exploitation, this thought has been\nformulated more precisely as the “non-worseness\nclaim”: \nNWC: Interaction between A and B cannot be worse than\nnon-interaction when A has a right not to interact with\nB at all, and when the interaction is mutually advantageous,\nconsensual, and free from negative externalities (Wertheimer 1996,\n2011; Zwolinski 2009; Powell and Zwolinski 2012). \nMost exploitation theorists are skeptical that the NWC is correct\n(Wertheimer 1996; Bailey 2010; Arneson 2013; Barnes 2013; Malmqvist\n2016). For if it were, then it would seem to be a mistake to blame\nindividuals who engage in certain forms of mutually beneficial\nexploitation—for example, those who engage in “price\ngouging” by selling electrical generators to victims of natural\ndisasters at inflated prices. (Zwolinski 2008). After all, we usually\nwould not blame those individuals if they stayed home and did nothing.\nBut, so long as people are willing to pay the high prices (and no\ncoercion or fraud is involved), both parties are better off with the\ntransaction than without it. So how could it be morally worse to\nprovide those customers with some benefit than it is to\nprovide them with no benefit at all? \nOf course, the NWC need not lead to a deflationary account of the\nwrongness of exploitation. It could, instead, lead to an\ninflationary account of the wrongness of non-interaction. In\nother words, we can account for the NWC’s claim that mutually\nbeneficial exploitation is not worse than non-interaction\neither by saying that mutually beneficial exploitation is\nless wrong than we thought it was, or by saying that\nnon-interaction is worse than we thought it was: by saying that price\ngougers are less blameworthy than we thought, or by saying that those\nwho stay home and do nothing to help victims of disaster are\nmore blameworthy than we thought. \nEven if mutually beneficial exploitation really is a serious moral\nwrong, however, it might not be a kind of wrong that can justify state\nintervention (Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 9). In other words, the question of\nthe moral force of exploitation cannot be settled entirely by\nreference to its moral weight. Suppose A is a price gouger who\nsells bottles of water to disaster victims for $12 each. Even if\nA acts wrongly or fails to act virtuously, it is arguable that\nA does not harm anyone or violate anyone’s rights, and\nonly harm or rights violations justify state intervention. If the\nstate cannot force A to sell the water to B, it might be\nthought completely irrational for the state to prohibit\nA and B from entering into a consensual and mutually\nadvantageous transaction. \nMoreover, there is a real danger that preventing mutually beneficial\nbut exploitative transactions will wind up “consigning the\nvulnerable person to an even worse fate than being exploited”\n(Wood 1995: 156). After all, persons who are exploited are taken\nadvantage of because of some antecedent vulnerability—a lack of\naccess to clean drinking water, in the example above. Preventing\nexploitative transactions by itself does nothing to alleviate\nthis vulnerability. Indeed, by depriving vulnerable parties of one\npossibility for improving their situation by engaging in a\nmutually beneficial transaction, such interference might actually\nexacerbate it. \nPerhaps this view is correct. Bracketing arguments based on\nexternalities, it seems perfectly plausible to maintain that the state\nis justified in interfering with transactions only if one party is\nviolating the other’s rights. That said, those who invoke the\nconcept of exploitation frequently maintain that such exploitation\nprovides a reason for state intervention. For example, when it is\nclaimed that commercial surrogacy exploits the birth mothers, the\ncritics typically argue that surrogacy contracts should be\nunenforceable or entirely prohibited. Similar things are said about\nthe sale of bodily organs. Those who make such arguments do frequently\nclaim that the transactions are nonconsensual or harmful, but they\nseem prepared to make such arguments even if the transactions are\nconsensual and mutually advantageous. \nOn what grounds might we justify interfering with consensual and\nmutually advantageous exploitative transactions? It might be thought\nthat we could interfere on paternalistic grounds. A paternalistic\nargument could not justify interfering with exploitative transactions\nif the exploitative transaction is advantageous to B and if\ninterference is not likely to result in a transaction that is more\nbeneficial to B. For paternalism justifies interfering for\nsomeone’s good, and this interference would not be to the\ntarget’s benefit. But there might be situations in which\nB knows enough to agree only to those exploitative transactions\nthat are beneficial (as compared with no transaction), but does not\nknow that less exploitative transactions are available. And so there\nmay be a “soft paternalist” justification for interference\nwith some mutually advantageous exploitative transactions. \nWe might also justify interfering with exploitative transactions on\nstrategic grounds. Suppose that A enjoys a monopoly position,\nsay, as a potential rescuer of B. If we prohibit A from\ncharging an exorbitant price for his services, then A might\noffer his services for a reasonable price. This argument would not\njustify interfering in a highly competitive market, for, under such\nconditions, A would not and could not offer his services for a\nbetter price. But there may be numerous situations in which such\nstrategic arguments can work (Wertheimer 1996). \nIt is worth noting, however, that prohibiting exploitative\ntransactions is not the only way in which the state or other moral\nagents might attempt to respond to its wrongful nature. Prohibition is\nan example of what Allen Wood describes as “interference”.\nBut in addition to interference, Wood suggests that we can think of\nredistribution as a way in which third parties such as the\nstate might attempt to prevent exploitation (Wood 1995: 154). After\nall, exploitation is only possible because B is in a position\nof vulnerability relative to A. One way to prevent\nexploitation, then, is to address this vulnerability directly—to\nchannel resources to B so as to remove the hardship that makes\nhim vulnerable to exploitation in the first place. If workers in the\ndeveloping world had an adequate social safety net to fall back on,\nfor instance, they would be less inclined to accept a job with the\nharsh conditions of a sweatshop, and therefore less vulnerable to\nexploitation by their employers. \nQuestions about exploitation arise in a wide variety of different\ncontexts, not just in the domain of political philosophy but in\nvarious areas of applied ethics as well such as business ethics,\nbiomedical ethics, and environmental ethics. In addition to the topics\ndiscussed briefly below, the concept of exploitation has played a\ncentral role in debates over payday lending (Mayer 2003), clinical\nresearch in the developing world (Hawkins and Emanuel 2008), markets\nfor human organs (Hughes 1998; Taylor 2005), guest worker programs\n(Mayer 2005), and price gouging (Zwolinski 2008).  \nSome theorists, such as Philippe van Pairjs, have argued that justice\nrequires that the state institute a universal basic income (UBI). A\nUBI is a cash transfer, funded by taxes, that would be paid to all\ncitizens regardless of need, and regardless of whether they are\nworking, or even willing to work (van Parijs 1995). Against this, some\ncritics have charged that a basic income would facilitate a form of\nexploitation. As Stuart White argues,  \nwhere others bear some cost in order to contribute to a scheme of\ncooperation, then it is unfair for one to willingly enjoy the intended\nbenefits of their cooperative efforts unless one is willing to bear\nthe cost of making a relevantly proportionate contribution to this\nscheme of cooperation in return. (White 1997: 317–318) \nAs is so often the case in dealing with exploitation claims, assessing\nthis objection requires us to grapple with a complicated mix of\nempirical and normative claims. On the empirical side, for instance,\nwe might ask whether a basic income really would lead to a\nnet increase in reciprocity-violating transfers. Some theorists have\nargued that a basic income would actually increase incentives to work\nrelative to currently existing welfare programs, by lowering the\neffective marginal tax rate faced by low-wage workers (Tobin 1966).\nOthers have emphasized the role of unpaid labor in the economy, such\nas domestic labor, and argued that a basic income would lead to a\nfairer application of the reciprocity principle than welfare systems\nthat condition benefits on doing paid work (Pateman 2004).\nNormatively, the objection challenges us to think about both what the\nideal of reciprocity requires and how it fits within a system of\nbroader distributive justice. Some advocates of basic income have\nargued that a liberal-egalitarian theory of justice is correct and\nrequires an equal distribution of scarce resources such as land rent\nand the rent component of wages (van Parijs 1997: 329). Reciprocity\nmay be an important political value, such theorists argue, but it is\none that is to be applied only after people have been given\nwhat they are due at the basic level of justice. \nThe term “sweatshop” is usually used to refer places of\nemployment that utilize low-skill workers, often in the developing\nworld, and that are characterized by low wages, long hours, and unsafe\nworking conditions. In many cases, sweatshops produce goods on\ncontract for large, multinational enterprises, who then sell those\ngoods to customers in wealthier societies. \nMany critics see sweatshop labor as highly exploitative. A large part\nof the debate over this claim has focused on the issue of wages.\nCritics claim that sweatshops have a moral obligation to pay a living\nwage to their workers. This duty is grounded in the extreme need of\nsweatshop workers, the fact that sweatshops and the multinational\nenterprises with which they contract rely on them to produce the goods\nthat they sell, and the fact that the multinational enterprises are\nprofitable enough that they can afford to increase workers’\nwages without jeopardizing the health of their business (Meyers 2004;\nSnyder 2008). Some critics, however, see sweatshops’ low wages\nas merely one symptom of a broader failure to respect workers as\npersons who are ends in themselves. That failure of respect manifests\nitself in sweatshops violation of legal labor standards, their\nexposure of workers to physically dangerous conditions, and their\nabuse and coercion of workers on the job (Arnold and Bowie 2003:\n227–233). \nOnce again, a number of difficult empirical and normative issues come\nout in this debate. The empirical issues include not only questions\nabout what conditions in sweatshops are actually like—how low\nwages actually are relative to other firms in the developing economy,\nfor instance—but what effects various attempts to remedy\nsweatshop conditions would actually have. Would a higher legal minimum\nwage improve workers’ overall well-being, or would it instead\nlead to layoffs and plant relocations (Powell and Zwolinski 2012)? On\nthe normative side, the Non-Worseness Condition seems to pose an\nespecially significant challenge to critics of sweatshop labor. If\nsweatshops, by providing jobs and capital infusion in the developing\nworld, provide some benefit to workers there, how can they be\nacting in a morally worse way than wealthy firms that do not outsource\ntheir production at all, and thus provide no benefit to needy\nworkers abroad (Zwolinski 2007; Preiss 2014)? Another question: even\nif we grant that sweatshops exploit their workers, and that\nexploitation is a significant moral wrong, might it be a wrong that is\nall-things-considered justifiable if sweatshop labor nevertheless\nconfers considerable benefits on current workers, and plays an\nimportant role in economic growth? In other words, how much weight\nshould a valid claim of exploitation have in our overall judgment of\nthe justice of a practice or of a set of institutions that permit that\npractice? \nCommercial surrogacy is a practice in which a woman is paid to become\npregnant as a result of either artificial insemination or the\nimplantation of an already fertilized egg, and to surrender her\nparental rights to the intended parent(s). In the United States, most\nsurrogacy arrangements are purely domestic affairs (with both the\nintended parents and the surrogate being citizens of the United\nStates), but a significant number are international, in which the\nsurrogate mother is often a citizen of a much poorer country. \nBoth types of surrogacy arrangement have been subjected to criticism\non a number of distinct grounds. Some have argued that surrogacy\ninvolves an objectionable form of “commodification”, while\nothers have argued that the practice is harmful to children, or to\nwomen as a class. But many have also argued that the practice exploits\nthe women who serve as surrogates. In the case of international\nsurrogacy, this charge is usually based on the bad circumstances and\nlow pay of the women who serve as surrogates. The lack of alternative\nsources of employment has been said to undermine women’s\nconsent, and the compensation they receive is often extremely low\ncompared to the pay received by American surrogates for the same\nservice—sometimes as low as 10%. \nIn the case of domestic surrogacy, critics charge that surrogate\nmothers are young and do not fully understand the physical and\npsychological risks that attend the services they are agreeing to\nprovide. As a result, the arrangement might be harmful on net to them\ndespite the fact that they consent to it. Or, even if it is not\nharmful on net, the payment they receive might be inadequate\ncompensation for the costs they incur, thus rendering surrogacy a case\nof mutually beneficial but unfair and exploitative exchange (Tong\n1990). \nQuestions of fair compensation for surrogates raise many of the same\nissues, and give rise to many of the same debates, as are found in the\nliterature on sweatshop labor (Wilkinson 2003). But unlike the sort of\nlabor that takes place in sweatshops, some critics believe that\ncommercial surrogacy arrangements are intrinsically wrong. If\nwomen’s reproductive labor is not the sort of service that\nshould be sold at any price, then commercial surrogacy may\ninvolve a kind of exploitation insofar as it entices women to engage\nin an activity that is harmful to their moral character (Anderson\n1990; Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 4).","contact.mail":"mzwolinski@sandiego.edu","contact.domain":"sandiego.edu"}]
