Sanches gained\nnotoriety through his controversial text, That Nothing is\nKnown. His skeptical ideas concerning what could be known of the\nphenomenal world, influenced the work of other philosophers like\nRené Descartes. In fact, in the last twenty-five to thirty\nyears, his work has at last been acknowledged as having served as a\nbackground source of Descartes’ refutation of scepticism. Sanches was\nnot only a philosopher; he was also a physician, and a professor of\nmedicine – a fact that doubtlessly tempered his scepticism. In\nrecent years, there has been a growing interest in Sanches, as he has\ncome to be seen as a significant philosopher in the history of\nscepticism, along with Montaigne, Descartes, and Hume. Some\ncontemporary thinkers have gone as far as comparing his notion of\nlanguage and metaphysics to that of someone like Wittgenstein.\n\n\nFrancisco Sanches/Sánchez (1551–1623) was a physician and\na philosopher. As professor of both medicine and philosophy at the\nUniversity of Toulouse, he was the author of a number of treatises on\nboth medicine and philosophy, but gained notoriety as the sceptical\nphilosopher who penned Quod Nihil Scitur (1581), or\nThat Nothing is Known (1988, TNK). As a philosopher who took\na sceptical view of knowledge, and who famously ended his writings\nwith the Latin interrogative “quid?” even the\nquestion of whether he was Portuguese or Spanish by birth, has been\nthe subject of much debate. This has led to the confusing dual\nspelling of his last name: with an “s” by Luso-Brazilian\nscholars (Sanches); with a “z” by Spanish scholars\n(Sánchez); and commonly with an “s” (with some\nexceptions) by English-language scholars. Here the latter spelling\nwill be used solely in keeping with English language scholarship and\ntranslations, while referring to Sanches, as an Iberian philosopher.\nThis confusion over his rightful birth place, is curiously reflected\nin Elaine Limbrick’s Introduction to That Nothing is\nKnown, where she refers to him as “the Portuguese\nphilosopher and doctor” on page 1 and then a few pages later\nwrites that “Francisco Sanches (Franciscus Sanchez) was probably\nborn on July 16, 1551, in Tuy, a city of northwestern\nSpain…” (Limbrick 1988: 4): situated across the border\nfrom the Portuguese city of Braga, with which it shared an archdiocese\n(Cazac 1903, 1904). Supposedly, a distant cousin of Michel de\nMontaigne, and born to a family of “conversos” (Orden\nJiménez 2012, in Other Internet Resources), in 1562 the Sanches\nfamily moved to the Bordeaux region where the cultural and political\nclimate was much more amicable towards Jews and converts (Limbrick\n1988: 5). It was in Bordeaux that Sanches attended the prestigious\nCollège de Guyenne between the years 1562 and 1571. The\nCollège de Guyenne, whose course of study ranged from secondary\nschool to college, included a curriculum that emphasized the rhetoric\nof Aristotle and the scholastics.  \nThe existence of higher groups in philosophy and of public lectures in\nGreek and mathematics indicates the overlapping of school and\nuniversity, (Woodward 1906: 143)  \nwhich gives one some idea as to the kind of education Sanches received\nat the Collège. And in effect, the first two years of college\nlevel courses included the study of Aristotelian logic and natural\nphilosophy (based on the Physica and on De\nCaelo). \nMoreover, the teaching of Aristotle, as Michel Reulos has pointed out,\nfocused on manuals and commentaries on “the Philosopher”\nrather than on the actual works of Aristotle (Reulos 1976: 149); and\nthat in turn, had mostly to do with the fact that relatively little of\nAristotle (and much less of Plato) had been translated into Latin. The\ntranslated excerpts were put at the service of the study of theology\n(1976: 152), and the way in which Aristotle was taught, says Reulos,\ndid not change until the early 1600s, when due to the influence of\n Petrus Ramus (1515–1572),\n the study of Aristotle in the colleges began to emphasize a return to\nthe texts themselves, and deemphasize the medieval commentaries (1976:\n154). This explains two major factors regarding Sanches’ early\nacademic background in light of his work: On the one hand, the\nfluidity of his Latin and on the other, Sanches’ own\nacknowledgment that the target of the attack in That Nothing is\nKnown was not so much Aristotle, but rather the scholastic use of\nAristotle. In contrast to the style of Scholastic logicians,\nSanches’ style is direct, informal, and devoid of rhetorical\nflourishes. And yet while Sanches approvingly cites the Spanish\nhumanist, Juan Luis Vives’ (1492–1540) criticism of the\nnon-sense produced by the Scholastic dialecticians who only knew\nAristotle “through Latin translations and commentaries”, argues Limbrick (TNK: 29), Petrus Ramus, on the other hand, fails to get mentioned, due to the latter’s wish to fuse rhetoric with\ndialectic and more significantly, reconfigure the Galenic method so as\nto “ascend” from particulars to universals (Ong 1958\n[1983: 257–258]). For it’s a noteworthy fact that in 1571\nSanches went to study medicine at La Sapienza in Rome: where\n Galen\n was one of the key figures of medical studies. And to a great extent\none could argue that Sanches’ empiricist scepticism can best be\nunderstood against the background of Galen’s inductive method\nand his own training as a physician. Medical pedagogy at La Sapienza\nunderscored the importance of observation while giving much less\nweight to logic and dialectic; in other words, it centered its\nteachings on Galen’s method as exemplified in the Ars\nmedica, and underplayed the Aristotelian logic and natural\nphilosophy of the scholastics; a factor that doubtlessly, impacted on\nSanches’ philosophy. Sanches, however, did not graduate from La\nSapienza. Instead, two years later, in 1573, he returned to the south\nof France, to conclude his studies at the more pedagogically\nconservative University of Montpellier, which like La Sapienza\nconcentrated primarily on Galenic theory (and secondarily on\nHippocrates) (Limbrick 1988: 63). And on 13 July 1574 he received his\ndoctorate from the University of Montpellier, where he unsuccessfully\ntried to secure a position as chair in the Medical Department.\nDisappointed with internal and external (religious) politics, Sanches\ngained employment at the University of Toulouse (1575) where he\nremained until his death in 1623, as professor of both medicine and\nphilosophy. \nSanches wrote treatises on medicine and philosophy, and of his\nphilosophical works, only two were published in his lifetime, Quod\nnihil scitur (1581; That Nothing is Known) and\nCarmen de cometa anni M.D.LXXVII (1578; Poem of the Comet\nof 1577). The other philosophical writings were published by his\nsons in 1636, and they included De longitudine et brevitate vitae,\nliber; In liber Aristotelis physiognomicon commentarius;\nand De diviniatone per somnum, ad Aristotelem. All of which\ncan be found in the various editions of his philosophical\noeuvre—see the discussion at the beginning of the\nBibliography. \nAlthough occasionally there may be references to a variety of texts,\nfor reasons of space, the focus here will be on Carmen de\ncometa [Poem of the Comet] and the Letter to Christopher Clavius,\nfor they best serve as a bridge to Quod nihil scitur/That\nNothing is Known (QNS/TNK), the work that made Sanches\nfamous and continues to be studied; either because of its own\nintrinsic merits or in connection with\n René Descartes’ (1596–1650)\n “radical doubt”, and other sixteenth and seventeenth\ncentury sceptics like Pierre Charron (1541–1603) or\n Montaigne.\n The essay will consequently begin with Carmen de cometa\n(1578)/Poem of the Comet, move to Sanches’ “Letter to\nChristopher Clavius”, and will lastly deal with Quod nihil\nscitur (1581)/That Nothing is Known (1988, TNK). \nAs Elaine Limbrick points out, Sanches wrote Carmen de cometa anni\nM.D.LXXVII in the style of Lucretius’ De rerum\nnatura or The Nature of Things. His two main targets\nwere (1) Francesco Giuntini’s Discours sur ce que menace\ndevoir advenir la comete apparue à Lyon le 12 de ce mois de\nNovembre de 1577. laquelle se voit encores à present, a\ntreatise that proposed that the comet of 1577, and comets in general,\nwere prophetic phenomena of bad things to come, such as plagues and\nthe deaths of kings; and (2) Aristotelian notions of the heavens, the\nspheres, and the place of comets within this hierarchical,\nastronomical ontology. \nIt is indeed telling that Sanches begins the Carmen de cometa\nin a mocking and critical tone on the question of knowledge. He\nwrites:  \nWhy do you pretend to know such profound things you, impulsive youth?\nTo what end do you pretend to know these things, you trembling old\nage? Thus I want to show above all else that the long-haired star\ncannot predict anything. And even if it could predict, it would not\nprovide any knowledge. It serves no purpose. So why want what is\nuseless? (CC: 143: 1–2; 146: 25–27, my translation)  \nThis is the scepticism that frames the Poem of the Comet. \nFirstly, we have Sanches’ view of comets, more or less derived\nfrom Aristotle’s notions of the heavens and the place of comets\nwithin them. For Aristotle comets were celestial bodies inhabiting the\nspace between the Earth and the upper heavenly spheres. They were\ncreated by hot dry exhalation that emanated from the terrestrial\nsphere, and clashed, as it were, with the movement of the heavenly\nsphere (Meteorologica 344a8–33); or as Aristotle\nexplained: if the exhalation extended in all directions it was called\na “comet or long-haired star”, and if it extended\nlengthwise only it was called a “bearded star”.  \nNow when as a result of the upper motion there impinges upon a\nsuitable condensation a fiery principle which is neither so very\nstrong as to cause a rapid and widespread conflagration, nor no feeble\nas to be quickly extinguished, but which is yet strong enough and\nwidespread enough; and when besides there coincides with it an\nexhalation from below of suitable consistency; then a comet is\nproduced, its exact form depending on the form taken by the\nexhalation—if it extends in all directions it is called a comet\nor long-haired star, if it extends lengthwise only it is called a\nbearded star. (344a15–26 51) \nThe fact, thereby, that comets were conceived objects of secondary\nimportance in the great hierarchy of the heavenly spheres, reduce\ntheir ontological significance for Sanches. How could such unimportant\nphenomena prophecy great events and determine the actions of rational\nbeings? Since comets were the product of dry exhalations “with\nexcessively weak forces” that occurred at great distances from\nthe earth, they “could not be the cause of anything” (CC:\n194: 658–661, my translation). “What could your\nlong-haired star achieve then? What can that miniscule breath with its\ndim light, transmit to us from the heights of the heavens” (CC:\n666–669). The answer for Sanches, as would be expected, was\n“nihil”. Nowhere was it observable that comets\nwere either signs or final causes (cf. Orden Jiménez 2003) In\nshort, comets were not natural phenomena with consciousness that\n“gave greater importance to kings than to common citizens”\n(CC: 174–174: 409–410); and they certainly could not be\nthe cause of human actions, for then they would obviate free will.\n \nThe free mind is not subject to laws, and neither are its own acts: it\ncan turn either way; at times the soul turns to a certain thing, and\nat times to others…Why do you persist that the long-haired\nstars can predict harmful arguments or cruel poisons in my life? No\none can foretell what is subject to free will. (CC: 170:\n336–339, 342–346)  \nAnd he adds:  \nReligion and the habits of our souls are free acts of our will. What\neffects can celestial bodies have on free acts? What is the relation\nbetween our mind and a bearded star? Celestial bodies have not been\ngiven any power over the mind…. (CC: 171: 354–359, my\ntranslation)  \nReligion, and even more so, “good acts” can only be\nattributable to free will. Or to put it another way, morality is\ncontingent on free will. If God were to put special powers into comets\nsuch that they could influence human actions, then comets—these\nmaterial objects—would be superior to humans. Humans would be\nthe playthings of comets, and “good acts” qua\ndetermined acts would no longer be good. On the other hand, human acts\nwould be subject, to what in the Middle Ages was deemed as\n“Fortuna”, predestination, and to some extent\nprovidence. \nFinally, there is Sanches’ tacit criticism of a theory based on\nnothing more than a syllogistic argument that fails to prove any\nconnection between comets and human actions, not to mention, any\nconnection between the appearance of a comet as a cause, and its\nputative effects on human actions, death, harvests, and diseases. For\nhow many years could go by before a comet was witnessed, asked\nSanches, and still harvests failed, earthquakes rattled the earth, and\nkings died? Not to mention the fact that comets were often witnessed\nby certain peoples around the globe and not by others. Did that mean\nthat if the comet were only seen by the peoples of India, it would\nonly have an effect on that particular population, and not on the\npeoples of the south of France? If comets only predicted certain\nthings, one was left to ask: why these and not others? And what is\nmore, why could they not equally be the cause of good things?\n“There is no reason for it”, says Sanches (CC: 186: 563).\nAnd as such, at the very core of Sanches’ poem, lies the kernel\nof his scepticism. After all, the Poem of the Comet of 1577 and\nThat Nothing is Known were written at nearly the same time.\nIn this respect, Sanches’ Poem is an attack on Ptolemaic\nastrology, which anticipated Pierre Gassendi’s (1592–1655)\ncriticisms of astrology’s vis-à-vis its threat to the\nnotion of free will (Sarasohn 1996: 99). Interestingly, Sanches and\nGassendi shared what Popkin calls a “constructivist\nscepticism” (1964: 17); which in both cases resulted from their\nanti-Aristotelianism and scientific empiricism (Popkin 1964:\n86–87). As such, then, from this perspective, Carmen de\nCometa/Poem of the Comet ought to be considered one of\nSanches’ philosophical works, and one which sheds light upon his\nmore popular Quod nihil scitur/That Nothing is Known. \nJust as everything else that has to do with Sanches, there is even\nuncertainty as to the date the Letter to Christopher Clavius was\nwritten. Raymond Delassus, Sanches’ disciple, and first\nbiographer, dates the letter to around 1575, while J. Iriarte believes\nthat the latter was written much later, in 1589, in which case it\nwould place the writing of the letter at least eight years after the\npublication of Quo nihil scitur (1581). Given, however, that\nClavius’ translation and commentary on Euclid’s\nElements was published in Rome in 1574, it would seem that\nthe former date of 1575, makes much more sense. It stands to reason\nthat Sanches would have responded to Clavius’ commentary soon\nafter its publication rather than fifteen years later, especially when\nso much of what is in the letter is implicitly related to\nSanches’ epistemology in Quod nihil scitur. In that\nsense the Letter to Clavius constitutes a debate between those who\nlike Clavius believed that the truths of mathematics were a\npriori and indubitable, and thinkers like Sanches who held an\nanti-Platonist, empiricist view of the world. A few quotes from\nClavius’ Opera mathematica and from Sanches’s\nLetter help us to understand the debate. Clavius wrote: \nSince the mathematical disciplines treat things which are considered\nwithout any sensible matter (although they are actually impressed in\nmatter), it is clear that they occupy the intermediate place between\nmetaphysics and natural science…If the nobility and preeminence\nof a science is truly judged by virtue of the certainty of the\ndemonstrations it uses, undoubtedly the mathematical disciplines will\noccupy the first place among all. (quoted in Sasaki 2003: 56) \nBy the time that Descartes wrote the Meditations,\nClavius’ view concerning what he called the\n“preeminence” of mathematics was generally accepted. It\nwas the prevailing view that something like Euclid’s theorems\nwere time-tested to be demonstrably true. And indeed it was for this\nreason that Mersenne suggested to Descartes that he present his\narguments in his Second Replies in geometrical fashion, in the form of\nDefinitions, Postulates, Axioms, Common Notions, Propositions and\nDemonstrations (Dear 1995: 44–45). But at the end of the\nsixteenth century, Sanches would have none of it. Probably influenced\nby what he had read of\n Carneades’\n sceptical-empiricist critique of mathematics’ universal truths\n(cf. Cicero, Academica 2.116–118; Sextus Empiricus,\nAgainst the Professors Book III: “Against the\nGeometers”), Sanches anonymously challenged the\n Platonist mathematics\n of the most renowned mathematician of the age. In the guise of a\nmodern day Carneades, Sanches wrote: \nIn my opinion… lest the senses should fail us, we should\nattempt to get whatever we can get through the eyes, with the help of\ncompass and rule, and not get into long, complicated demonstrations\nthat often make things more confusing. Far is it for me to praise an\noverabundance of complex and long demonstrations, by which we often\nmake more obscure that which in itself was clear. (LC: 300: #10, my\ntranslation) \nFor Sanches, therefore, the geometrical sign functions in the same way\nas the thing represented. In other words, geometry, for Sanches, is\nthe science of phenomenal objects of perception. Here Jean-Paul\nDumont’s explanation of the way in which\n ancient scepticism\n understood phenomena may aid in contextualizing Sanches’ own\nview. For the ancient sceptics, writes Dumont:  \nThe phenomenon is not a subjective representation that exists only for\nthought, or for the imagination of the perceiving subject. The\nphenomenon is a material reality or, if one prefers, a body. (1972: 8)\n \nThis Protagorean scepticism—and rejection of Platonism—is\nexemplified in Sanches’ critique of Proclus’\n(412–485 CE) commentary on Proposition XIV of Euclid’s\nElements. \nSanches had addressed his critique of Proclus’ commentary in an\nearlier letter he sent to Clavius. However, while this first letter\nwas lost, the extant letter, “Ad. C. Clavium Epistola”,\ndemonstrates his dissatisfaction with Clavius’ Scholastic appeal\nto consecrated authority or Proclus. In the first letter, Sanches\ncongratulates Clavius for his ability to demonstrate some of\nEuclid’s propositions, with fewer words than Proclus and even\nEuclid. In keeping with common opinion, he believes it is a virtue to\nstate things as clearly as possible in order to avoid unnecessary\nconfusion “especially in mathematics, where we should understand\nas much as possible through the use of our senses” (LC: 300:\n#10, my translation). \nWhile the first part of the paragraph above refers to the virtue of\nbrevity, the second, and more important part of it, has to do with\nSanches’ empiricist notion of mathematics, for this is the basis\nof Sanches’ direct critique of Proclus, and indirectly of\nClavius. Sanches writes to Clavius:  \n… [Proclus] says that angles ACF and angle ACE are equal to two\nright angles, to which you respond that such angles should be added\nseparately and not in terms of one being part of the other, and that\nin this way, they are equal to two right angles. We had already come\nto that response to in previous discussion on the matter, and we agree\nthat we have refuted it [Proclus] satisfactorily. Nevertheless, we\nwill demonstrate it now with greater clarity. (LC: 301: #12) \nAnd from here, Sanches, with more than a touch irony, similar to that\nexhibited in many parts of QNS/TNK, says the following: \nSuppose I said that the eminent Clavius with his own head is a Janus\nwith two heads, would anyone believe me? Suppose that a father common\nto you and me, were to leave you in his testament two parcels of\narable lands, the ones that are two right angles, and made me the\nexecutor, would you be satisfied if I gave you the equivalent of the\nland represented by angle ACF\n [figure 1],\n which according to Proclus’ demonstration equals two right\nangles? But on the other hand, we would have to consider this, for the\nquestion is one of geometry, which is to say, of measuring the\nland. (LC: 301: #12, my emphasis) \nFigure 1 \nHere we witness Sanches turning to the etymology of geometry\n(γεω\nμετρία), meaning: the measurement\nof the land or earth (terrae mensura), followed by a second\nexample, which much like the first is based on a pragmatist view of\nmathematics\n [figure 2]. \nFigure 2 \nIf you were to purchase a piece of cloth of the length AB, in order to\nmake a jacket, and the merchant were to give you a piece of cloth of\nsize CD alleging that that CD and CE were equivalent to AB,\ndon’t you think the jacket would come out too short? (LC: 301:\n#12, my translation). \nHe summarily concludes:  \nIf one were to proceed in this fashion in all mathematical matters, in\nwhich way would math be different than other deceiving disciplines?\n \nProclus was a Pythagorean and Platonic philosopher, the author of two\ncommentaries on Plato’s Timaeus and the\nParmenides. For Proclus mathematical objects—and that,\nof course, included the objects of geometry—were not derived by\nway of abstraction from sensible particulars, but rather from ideas\nalready contained in the mind. And it was this very kind of\n“dogmatic” philosophy that Sanches opposed. For Sanches\nconcepts were either unprovable outside of their circular discursive\nlanguage (e.g., the syllogism), or easily dismissed through the\nsenses, as in the two cases mentioned above. It is for this reason\nthat one can justly qualify Sanches’ philosophy as being\nempiricist and sceptical at once. Clavius, the addressee of the\nletter, was clearly against of the sceptics’ conception of\nknowledge. Chikara Sasaki writes:  \nClavius seems to have known to some extent how the skeptics attacked\nhuman knowledge. He is also reported to have reacted against a\nskeptical attitude in astronomy, which took an instrumental view\nconcerning the status of astronomical hypothesis, defending a kind of\nrealist philosophy together with Johannes Kepler. (Sasaki 2003: 58)\n \nAnd Clavius himself in opposition to Pyrrhonism wrote: \nUnless one was revived by the recognition and knowledge of arithmetic,\ngeometry and dialectic (these arts had been established by\nforefathers), he would almost arrive at the undecidedness of the\nPyrrhonists (they were philosophers who decided nothing but doubted\neverything). (Clavius quoted in Sasaki 2003: 58) \nAlmost as a challenge, then, Sanches ended his letter to Clavius, with\nthe following words:  \nDo not ask who I am, for I am another Carneades [214–129/8 BCE]:\nwho rather than being a friend of glory, is a friend of the truth and\nof you. Goodbye. (LC: 305 #18)  \nThis, in a nutshell, describes his brand of scepticism, which rather\nthan being absolute in its denial of truth is a denial of certainty\nand perfect knowledge, and the Scholastic belief that the Aristotelian\nsyllogism guaranteed access to truth. For Sanches the truths of the\nsyllogism and dialectic were the immanent truths of (self-referential)\nlanguage, and nothing else. \nSanches, the self-proclaimed follower of Carneades, begins\nQNS/TNK with the famous quote from Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics: “‘Mankind has an inborn desire to\nknow’” (TNK: 166, quoting Met. 1, 980a). As\nElaine Limbrick points out:  \nThis quotation from the first line of Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics ironically prefaces a treatise whose entire\npurpose is to destroy the Aristotelian system of knowledge by pointing\nout the inadequacies of the Aristotelian scientific methodology and\nthe failure of most ancient philosophers to formulate a theory of\nknowledge leading to absolute truth. (TNK: 166–167, note 8)  \nBut the irony doesn’t stop there. Also ironic is the fact that\nThat Nothing is Known, marks a turning point in\nphilosophy—as did Descartes’ Meditations on First\nPhilosophy sixty years later—from an emphasis in\nmetaphysics to one in epistemology; a philosophical turn often\nassociated with the birth of Western modern philosophy. To the person\nfamiliar with Descartes’ Discourse on the Method (1637)\nthe opening paragraph of That Nothing is Known may appear\nsomewhat surprising, since the methodical doubt expressed in the first\nperson, conversational tone in the Discourse (Part II) seems\nalmost directly lifted from Sanches’ QNS/TNK (more on\nSanches and Descartes in\n §4).\n The French historian of philosophy, Étienne Gilson was among\nfirst to note the similarity of the language employed by both thinkers\nto give personal voice to their distinct notions of scepticism (Gilson\n1925: 267–268). Sanches wrote: \nMy own lot has in no way differed from that of other men. From my\nearliest years I was devoted to the contemplation of Nature so that I\nlooked into every-thing in great detail. At first my mind, hungry for\nknowledge, would be indiscriminately satisfied with any diet that was\nproffered to it; but a little later it was overtaken by indigestion,\nand began to spew it all forth again. Even at that period I was\nseeking to find some sustenance for my mind, such that my mind could\ngrasp it completely and also enjoy it without reservations; but no one\ncould appease my longing. I pored over the utterances of past\ngeneration of men, and picked the brains of my contemporaries. All of\nthem gave me the same answer, yet they brought me no satisfaction at\nall. Yes, I admit that some of them reflected a kind of shadow-image\nof the truth, but I found not one who gave an honest and full report\nof the judgments one ought to form concerning facts [res].\nSubsequently I withdrew into myself; I began to question everything,\nand to examine the facts themselves as though no one had ever said\nanything about them, which is the proper method of acquiring\nknowledge. I broke everything down into its ultimate first principles.\n(TNK: 167) \nFrom this point on, Sanches who begins by taking on Scholastic\nAristotelianism, states that his treatise will be written in simple,\nplain language. “Accordingly you are not to look in me for an\nelegant, polished style” (TNK: 171). He could write, if he\nwanted to, in such a style, he tells his reader, but he refuses to do\nso because “Truth slips away while we substitute one word for\nanother and employ circumlocutions—for this is verbal\ntrickery” (TNK: 171). If that is what the reader wants then she\nshould turn to the elegant language of the rhetoricians like Cicero.\n \nAnd you should not ask me to quote many authorities, or to treat my\nauthorities with deference; deference is rather the mark of a servile,\nuntrained mind than of one that is truly investigating the Truth.\n(TNK: 171–172)  \nThe aim of such statements was clearly to criticize and to distinguish\nhimself from the Aristotelian emphasis on rhetoric as practiced by the\nScholastics. Rather than follow Aristotle, or any other authority, he\nwrote,  \nI shall follow Nature alone. Authority bids us believe,\nwhereas Reason demonstrates; the former is more suited to\nfaith, the latter to the sciences. (TNK: 172)  \nHere his notion of science is highly significant, because it is this\non which his scepticism rests. Science, as becomes clear by the end of\nThat Nothing is Known, has to do with rational demonstrations\nbased on facts or things (rerum) that come to us from the\nsenses (the eyes), albeit imperfectly. What Sanches seems to find most\ndifficult to “swallow” are metaphysical statements and\narguments that cannot be proven, except syllogistically by accepting\ntheir first principles on faith. Concepts that do not “possess\nan understanding of natural phenomena [“res\nintelligas”, QNS: 92]” are “inventions”,\nsays Sanches; “for who could understand non-existent\nthings?” (TNK: 168). The list of such abstract concepts include:\n“Democritus’s Atom, Plato’s Ideas,\nPythagoras’s Numbers, and Aristotle’s Universals, Active\nIntellect, and Intelligences” (TNK: 168). He addresses himself,\nhe says, only to those who are “‘not bound by an oath of\nfidelity to any master’s words,’” but rather\n“assess the facts for themselves, under the guidance of\nsense-perception and reason” (TNK: 168). Having said this, he\nends the introduction to\nQNS/TNK, just as he did the Poem of the Comet, with the\nsceptical “Quid?” or What? \n“I do not know even this one thing, namely that I know\nnothing”, is the opening sentence of the treatise (TNK: 172).\nSanches, next considers whether this is a paradoxical or contradictory\nprinciple of scepticism. For if you know how to establish\nthat you do not know anything, it follows that you already know\nsomething. Furthermore, he argues, if you “have understood the\nambiguity of the inference, you have clearly perceived that nothing is\nknown” (TNK: 173). And nothing is known, clearly because such\nambiguities only point to the fact that language does not give us\naccess to absolute knowledge. Dialectical, logical, and linguistic\nentanglements such as the one mentioned above only proves his point.\nThus in an allusion to Aristotle’s Metaphysics\n(995a30), he asks his reader to help him “untie this knot”\n(TNK: 173). This marks the beginning of his critique of Aristotelian\nnominalism. \nFor Sanches names are arbitrary, and therefore they can in no way\ndefine “the nature of things”, or their essences. Now, if\nyou argue that you can use definitions to demonstrate the\nnature of a thing, “then show me one such”, responds\nSanches. In a manner that recalls some twentieth century philosophers\nof language, Sanches questions whether words like Being, Substance,\nand Essence mean anything at all beyond the circularity of their\ndefinitions, and whether we even understand what we mean when we\nemploy them. For example, with respect to the notion of Being, he\nwrites:  \nYou will say that you will not define this being, for it has no higher\ngenus to which it belongs. This I do not understand, nor do you. You\ndo not know what Being is; much less do I. (TNK: 175)  \nTo muddy the waters even more, we often use different names to refer\nto the same thing (res), e.g., “Being, Substance, Body,\nLiving, Animal, Man, and finally Socrates” to refer to humans.\nThis way a human being “who is something large, solid, and\nperceptible by the senses” becomes an incomprehensible,\nconceptual abstraction. \nIn fact, not only do we not know anything through language, we do not\neven know what is “‘knowledge’\n[scientia]” (TNK: 177). Statements such as\nAristotle’s “Knowledge is a mental disposition, acquired\nby demonstration” only beg the question, what is “a mental\ndisposition”? And this, says Sanches, he does not know, so\nAristotle’s definition of knowledge has failed to provide any\nkind of knowledge about what constitutes knowledge. “You are\nattempting to force me into a linear series of categorical\npropositions”, writes Sanches as though he were playing some\nkind of language game with another philosopher (player); and\ncontinues, “from these continually onwards, to Being—and\nwhat that is, you do not know” (TNK: 178). In this\nmanner all questions of knowledge are reduce to categorical\npropositions, and what are categorical propositions, if not “a\nlong series of words” (TNK: 178). Now, if such a term as a\n“mental disposition” is obscure, so is, to the same\ndegree, the definition of a “demonstration”, says Sanches.\nFor a demonstration is defined as a “‘syllogism’\nthat gives birth to knowledge” and so judges Sanches in his\nTribunal of Truth, “You have been guilty of a circular argument,\nand have deceived me just as you have deceived yourself” (TNK:\n181). Not to mention, that there simply is “no science\n[scientia] of syllogism”. And there is no science, or\nknowledge that can be derived from the syllogism because all of\nAristotle, including the Metaphysics, is nothing but an\ninquiry about a name, as for  \nexample whether substance can be predicated of a man…And\ninasmuch as no one can know this for sure, there is no knowledge,\neither of things [“rerum”, QNS: 101] or words\n[“verborum”, QNS: 101]. (TNK: 183) \nWe begin and end with particulars. In other words, with material\nobjects of perception: like this table before me, and not any\nsort of Platonic Form of table.  \nIndividuals alone exist, and can be perceived; it is only of\nindividuals that knowledge can be possessed, and only from individuals\nthat it can be sought,  \nargues Sanches.  \nIf this is not so, show me where those ‘universals’ you\nspeak of occur in nature; you will admit that they occur in the\nparticulars themselves. (TNK: 213)  \nSanches is clearly a nominalist. In fact, midway through\nQNS/TNK, he writes in capital letters: “KNOWLEDGE IS\nPERFECT UNDERSTANDING OF A THING” (TNK: 200). As Joseph Moreau\npoints out in “Doute et Savoir chez Francisco Sanches”\n(1960), this conception of knowledge or science as the “absolute\nand perfect” understanding of a thing, is a left-over of ancient\nthought (1960: 37). But again, in any case, such “perfect\nunderstanding” only means apprehending all the qualities of a\nparticular object of perception. It does not mean apprehending the\nobject or the thing-in-itself, to put it in Kantian terms. Sanches\nwrites: \nThe sense perceives only the outward appearance of things, and does\nnot attain understanding (I am for the moment applying the word\n“sense” to the eye). It is the mind that receives\nimages from the sense, and considers them. If the sense was deceived,\nso is the mind; but if not, what follows next? The mind regards only\nthe images of things, which the eye has taken in; it studies them from\nthis side and from that, and turns them about, putting the questions\n“What is this?” and “Whence comes its nature?”\nand “Why”—and no more than this, for it too sees\nnothing that is certain. (TNK: 236) \nNot only does sensory perception fail to give us the answers to\nquestions of essences, natures, and origins (of noumena), it\nalso fails to give us certainty; for all we perceive are\n“accidents…the most commonplace of all existents”\n(TNK: 237). We can only make inferences, says Sanches, from the\n“accidents” of “compound bodies”. The\nimpediment to knowledge, he interestingly states, does not reside in\nthe object, but rather in the perceiving subject who cannot access\nthings themselves.  \nExperience is in every instance deceitful and difficult. Even if it is\npossessed perfectly, it only reveals the external aspect of events; in\nno way does it reveal the natures of things. (TNK: 278)  \nSanches continues: \nIn respect to the natures of things, it [judgment] reveals them only\nby speculation; and since it has not ascertained them by means of\nexperience, not only does it too fail to reach the thing itself, but\nsometimes it forms an opinion in exactly the wrong sense. (TNK:\n278) \nObviously if we do not have access to the things themselves, but only\nto the outward appearances of particulars, we cannot come to know\nthings by their causes either: “Whence comes its nature?”\nas he says. We are told, states Sanches, that knowledge means\nunderstanding something by its causes. But this cannot be the case and\nthe example he gives to illustrate his point, is that of the\nfather-son causal relation from Aristotle’s Physics\n194b30: “the father is the cause of the child”. But this,\nargues Sanches, does not lead to any kind of knowledge about the\nchild, “for what does my father contribute to an understanding\nof me?” (TNK: 195). Nothing. The infinite regress\nrequired by the notion of causes applies no less to universals than it\ndoes to particulars. For even if one were to stop at God, as\n“both the first cause and the final end of all things”\n(TNK: 196), and avoid the infinite, in  \navoiding the infinite you fall into what is infinite and measureless,\nincomprehensible, ineffable and beyond the reach of the understanding.\n(TNK: 196)  \nAnd yet, according to you, says Sanches to his reader, this Being that\nis admittedly beyond your understanding “is the cause of\neverything; and therefore, according to your definition, understanding\nof Him is necessary for the understanding of His works”, which\nonly proves that “you know nothing” (TNK: 196). It was\nthis, Sanches’ fideism that probably saved him from a fate\nsimilar to that of Giordano Bruno’s. Sanches’ target was\nAristotelian epistemology, never faith. He denied not only knowledge\nof efficient and first causes, but also of material and formal causes.\nAristotle’s answers to sundry philosophical matters failed to\nconvince him. When Aristotle wrote in the Posterior Analytics\nthat “[s]ome hold that, owing to the necessity of knowing the\nprimary premises, there is no scientific knowledge” (1.3\n72b5–6), he was addressing the very sceptical notion of\nknowledge held by someone like Sanches. “Our own\ndoctrine”, wrote Aristotle, “is that not all knowledge is\ndemonstrative: on the contrary, knowledge of the immediate\npremises is independent of demonstration” (1.3\n72b18–20, my emphasis). But this is exactly the problem for\nSanches; for if primary and immediate premises do not require\ndemonstration, that means one has perfect knowledge of them, as one\nwould of first causes (like God), but that is not true. And if one\ndoes not have perfect knowledge of primary and immediate premises,\nthen where do they come from? What makes an indemonstrable primary\npremise the guarantor of knowledge? Nothing, answers Sanches. Primary\npremises are inventions that we need to take on faith in order to\nelude an infinite regress, and end up in the kind of scepticism that\nAristotle wanted to avoid. However, if, as Aristotle proposed,\n“demonstration must be based on premises prior to and better\nknown than the conclusion” (1.3 72b25–26), and\ndemonstrations were based on premises that were themselves arbitrary\ninventions, then demonstrations were not to be taken as reflecting\nperfect knowledge, or as Sanches would have it, any knowledge at all.\nSanches writes: \n“Knowledge is acquired by demonstration”: this in turn\nassumes a definition. Now, definitions cannot be proved, but\nhave to be believed; therefore demonstration based on\nassumptions (ex suppositis) will produce knowledge of a\nsuppositious kind, not sound exact knowledge…So the conclusions\nto be drawn from these first principles will be things assumed, not\nthings known. (TNK: 201) \nTherefore Aristotle’s statement in the Posterior\nAnalytics that “since the object of pure scientific\nknowledge cannot be other than it is, the truth obtained by\ndemonstrative knowledge will be necessary” (1.3 73a2–23),\nwas epistemologically insufficient for Sanches. Such necessity would\nmerely be the syllogistic necessity of a conclusion following from\narbitrary premises. But beyond the logical, there was also a\npsychological dimension to Sanches’ scepticism, which is\nimplicit in the rhetorical tone of QNS/TNK, and the ever\npresent other, to whom the treatise is directed. The tone vacillates\nfrom exasperation to despair at not being able to know more than what\nis derived from the language and the senses. Sanches dramatically\nstates: \nHow unhappy our situation is! We are blind in the midst of light. I\nhave often reflected about light, but always given up without thinking\nit through or understanding or comprehending it. It is the same if you\nreflect on the will and the intellect and other objects that are not\nperceived by means of the senses. (TNK: 243) \nAnd in words that anticipate Descartes’ certainty regarding the\nexistence of the cogito (cf. Cottingham 1998: 9), he\ndeclares:  \nOf this I am sure, that I am at this moment thinking of the words that\nI am writing, and that I wish to write them, and long for them both to\nbe true and win your approval; (TNK: 243)  \nbut  \nwhen I try to reflect on what this thinking is, and this wishing, and\nthis longing…then my thinking quite fails me, my wishing is\nfrustrated, and my yearning grows ever greater while my concern also\nincreases. (TNK: 243)  \nAll this initially reminds us of Descartes; but later in a pessimistic\ntone, he goes on to say that it is this epistemological uncertainty,\nthis wish to understand (cognitio) “inward ideas”\nand the impossibility of attaining such knowledge and understanding\nbeyond the senses that drives him to despair. “I see nothing\nthat I could seek to lay hold on, or might possibly grasp” (TNK:\n243), he writes in frustration. Then in a moment that recalls\nVives’ scepticism (cf. Casini 2009), he ponders: if I am\n“incapable of comprehending [even] the self” perfectly,\nhow am I “to comprehend the most abstruse secrets of Nature,\namong which are included spiritual things…?” (TNK: 239).\nClearly, argues Sanches, no one doubts that scientific knowledge\n(scientia) ought to be perfect, but there is nothing, not\neven in Nature, that is perfect (TNK: 289). And yet this does not lead\nSanches to the equanimity or ataraxia\n(ἀταραξία) of the Stoics.\nInstead his impassioned scepticism encourages the active search for\nknowledge. To that end, he ends his treatise with the exhortation:\n“To work” (TNK: 290) and asks his imaginary interlocutor\nto teach him what he knows, while he sets to do the double work of\nexamining “Things” while questioning everything\nthat ought to be questioned. Like the Poem of the Comet the\ntreatise’s final word is the interrogative: Quid?/What? \nOne topic of debate regarding Sanches’ scepticism revolves\naround the question of whether he was an Academic sceptic like\nCarneades with whom he identified himself in his letter to Clavius\n(§2.2) or whether his scepticism was\nof the Pyrrhonian variety as Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) claimed it\nto be in his Dictionary entry on Sanches (1697 [1820: 76]). However,\nthe distinction between Pyrrhonian and Academic scepticism has not\nalways been clear (cf.  Striker 1996: 140–141,\n148–149). For Popkin (1964), Sanches’ scepticism unlike\n Pyrrho’s \n (c. 360 BCE–c. 270 BCE) or\n Sextus Empiricus’ (c. 160\n CE–c. 210 CE), does not call for the suspension of judgment\n “but rather the more full-fledged negative dogmatism of the\n Academics” (Popkin 1964: 41). Popkin continues:  \nThe Pyrrhonists, with their more thoroughgoing scepticism, could\nneither assent to the positive theory of knowledge, nor to the\ndefinite conclusion that nihil scitur. (Popkin 1964: 42)\n \nBut this characterization of Sanches’ “nihil\nscitur” does not seem completely correct either, for it did\nnot mean, as previously suggested, that absolutely nothing was known.\nInstead Sanches presented it as a diagnosis, pertinent on the one\nhand, to the medical treatment of the body and on the other, to\nphilosophical inquiry concerning the things (rerum) that\ncould indeed be known with some degree of certainty (Lupoli 2009).\nNow, while Limbrick, like Popkin, also views Sanches as an Academic\nsceptic, she, on the other hand emphasizes the notion of Carneadean\nprobabilism and its connection to Sanches’ “medical\npractice” (1988: 79). To the point, it is not clear that Sanches\nhad any direct knowledge of Sextus Empiricus’ work; what is\nevident, nevertheless, is that he was familiar with Galen’s\nwork, which seems to have influenced his own empiricist\nscepticism. \nAdmittedly, pairing Sanches with Galen may at first seem rather odd,\ngiven the latter’s rejection of scepticism. In “My Own\nBooks” he wrote that he wished to learn “the science of\nlogical proof” (GAL2: 18) and the method by which to recognize\nwhether a particular proof was sound or not. To accomplish such, he\nsays, he turned to “the best-reputed Stoic and Peripatetic\nphilosophers of the time” (GAL2: 18), but their conflicting\nlogical theories culminated in confusion.  \nIndeed, as far as these teachers were concerned, I might well have\nfallen into a Pyrrhonian despair of knowledge, if I had not had a firm\ngrip of the disciplines of geometry, mathematics, and\narithmetic…. (GAL2: 18)  \nAnd yet while Galen divided the different approaches to knowledge into\nroughly that of the Rationalists (or Dogmatists), the Empiricists, and\nthe Methodics, his scientific method was a mix of each one of them,\nemphasizing a marriage between theory and empiricism. In his\nintroduction to Galen: Selected Works, P. N. Singer writes:\n \nThe Empiric school, which was founded in the mid-third century BC by a\nfollower of Herophilus [335 BC–280 BC], was influenced by\nSceptical philosophy, and represented an attempt to engage in the art\nof medicine with as little as possible in the way of theoretical\npostulates. (Singer 1997: xiv)  \nThis almost seems as a corollary to Sanches’ sceptical rejection\nof the theoretical, dogmatic postulates of the Aristotelian syllogism\nand Plato’s Ideas.  \nDenying the possibility of true knowledge concerning the body, the\nEmpiric’s view is that the doctor must rely on experience\n(peira) and precise observation\n(tērēsis)…. (1997: xiv)  \nIn that light, if indeed it was the mathematical disciplines that\nsaved Galen from falling into a Pyrrhonian despair concerning\nknowledge, it is because his vision of mathematics seems to have had\nthe function of proving along with experience (or experimentation)\ntheories necessary to arrive at correct diagnoses, and not because he\nenvisioned mathematics as an abstract, Platonic discipline. \nThus, what prima facie seems to be a major difference between\nGalen and Sanches regarding the truths mathematics may not be so great\nafter all. Doubtlessly, Galen was an Aristotelian philosopher and\nphysician, who subscribed to Aristotelian logic and definitions,\nwhereas Sanches was not and did not; and yet much like Sanches he\ndoubted that any knowledge of the noumenal world (e.g., God,\nthe substance and immortality of the soul, etc.) was possible.\nInterestingly, Galen’s “An Outline of Empiricism”\nbegins with the following sentence:  \nAll doctors who are followers of experience, just like the\nphilosophers who are called Sceptics, refuse to be called after a man,\nbut rather want to be known by their frame of mind. (GAL1: 23)  \nSuch a statement bears resemblance to Sanches’ questioning of\nuniversals for the very much the same reason; that is to say, because\nthe experience of things (rerum) is always the experience of\nparticulars and not of universals (like Man). Galen later explains:\n \nWe say that the art of medicine has taken its origin from experience,\nand not from indication. By “experience”, we mean the\nknowledge of something which is based on one’s own perception,\nby “indication”, the knowledge which is based on rational\nconsequence. For perception leads us to experience, whereas reason\nleads the dogmatics to indication. (GAL1: 24)  \nEarlier empiricists, argues Galen, viewed perception and experience as\nboth the activity of seeing for oneself (autopsia) and as\ncognition, and that is how he thought medical practice ought to be\nconducted (GAL1: 25–26). Here we have Galen the physician and\nthe philosopher who wrote: “The best doctor is also a\nphilosopher” (GAL2: 30–34), and the Galen who was to be a\npredecessor of Sanches. But Galen was not alone in being a philosopher\nand a physician. His contemporary Sextus Empiricus seems also to have\nbeen both. \nIn section XXXIV of Outlines of Scepticism, Sextus Empiricus\nposed the question “Is medical empiricism the same as\nscepticism?” (SE-OS: 62: 235), to which he answered that if\nempiricism made assertions about “the inapprenhensibility of\nunclear matters” then it could not be the same as scepticism,\nand the same applied to scepticism, for scepticism was precisely a\nrejection of belief in things that could not be proven (dogmatism).\nNowhere else did these two modes of thought function better, wrote\nSextus Empiricus, than in medicine. He argued: \nThey might rather adopt, as it seems to me, what is called the Method,\nfor this alone of the medical schools seem to practice no rashness in\nunclear matters and does not presume to say whether they are\napprehensible or inapprehensible, but it follows what is apparent,\ntaking thence, in line with Sceptical practice, what seems to be\nexpedient. (SE-OS: 63: 236–237). \nMedicine, then, for Sextus Empiricus was what medicine would equally\nbe for the late sixteenth century Sanches: a combination of empiricism\nand scepticism. Medicine took as much from philosophical scepticism,\nas philosophical empiricism took from medicine. Galen’s above\ncritique of “indications” or indicans (cf.\nMaclean 2002: 308–310)—which bears a certain similarity to\nSanches’ critique of demonstration and naming—is best\nexplained by Sextus Empiricus: \nA sign is indicative, they say, if it signifies that of which it is a\nsign not by having been observed evidently together with the thing it\nsignifies but from its proper nature and constitution (as bodily\nmovements are signs of the soul). That is why they also define this\nsign as follows: An indicative sign is a pre-antecedent statement in a\nsound conditional, revelatory of the consequent. There being two\ndifferent sorts of signs…we argue not against all signs but\nonly against indicative signs, which seem to be a fiction of the\nDogmatists. For recollective signs are found convincing by everyday\nlife: seeing smoke, someone diagnoses fire, having observed a scar, he\nsays that a wound was inflicted. (SE-OS: 93: 101, 102) \nTo put it Sanchean terms, indicative signs are helpful when they\nrefer to particular things (rerum) in the world; and\nthey are unhelpful when they refer to the dogmatic notion of\nuniversals. Just as Carmen de Cometa/Poem of the Comet was\nwritten to dispel the notion of comets as signs of bad things to come,\nDe divinatione per somnum, ad Aristotelem, rejects the idea\nthat any knowledge can be attained by way of demonic states,\nprophecies, or dreams. In John Owen’s quirky but insightful\nbook, The Skeptics of the French Renaissance, one of the\ncharacters of the dialogue says at the very beginning of the chapter\non Sanches that  \n[i]n an age when science and medicine was mixed up with astrology,\ndivination, charms, and an enormous farrago of superstitious nonsense,\nSanchez held up to his brother physicians the torch of a true Science\nfounded upon experiment, and a due recognition of natural laws. (1893:\n617)  \nThis is obviously significant for its recognition of the importance of\nthe scientific method in Sanches’ elaboration of his scepticism.\nHere both Damian Caluori and Limbrick agree that Sanches’s\ncritique of Aristotelianism and his proposed scepticism was “not\nonly of theoretical concern” (Caluori 2007: 45), but a practical\none that sought “the answer to the question of the right\nscientific method to be used in the quest for true knowledge”\n(Limbrick 1988: 25). And while Caluori argues that his empiricist\nscepticism was Pyrrhonian in nature, what is clear for both Caluori\nand Limbrick is that his scepticism was by no means absolute, and that\nfundamental to his rejection of Aristotelianism was his medical\ntraining where particular things needed to be perceived and analyzed\nnot by their names or definitions but rather by the external qualities\nthat they presented to the senses, since such practical matters as\ndiagnoses needed to be made, and cures needed to be prescribed and\nadministered. In comparison to the treatment of the body, such a thing\nas the content of his mind would have seemed much less important to\nSanches. \nThe division of the world into one of external and internal realities,\nis one of the notions that Sanches and Descartes share. Where they\neach end up, is, of course, completely different. What is similar, on\nthe other hand, is their starting point; that is to say, the way they\narticulate the radical doubt with which they begin their respective\ninquiries; and for that reason Sanches has often been considered a\nprecursor of Descartes. It is undeniable that the personal expression\nof their scepticism as found both in That Nothing is Know\n(1581) and the Discourse on the Method (1637) share more than\na coincidental resemblance. Pamela Kraus points out in her\nintroduction to the Discourse on Method [DM], that\nthe word “discours” had a wider meaning in the seventeenth\ncentury signifying among other things “‘talk’ or\n‘conversation’” ([DM: 1]).  But this was not\nthe case for Sanches, who wrote Quod nihil scitur over forty\nyears earlier, and whose conversational style was in the service of a\ntreatise aimed at the Aristotelianism of his time, and particularly at\nthe Aristotelian notion of demonstrative truths. What is indeed\nstriking are the passages in the Discourse that seem to be\ndirectly lifted from the Iberian philosopher’s 1581\ntreatise. Here are two examples: the first from Sanches, the latter\nfrom Descartes: \nMy own lot has in no way differed from that of other men. From my\nearliest years I was devoted to the contemplation of Nature so that I\nlooked into everything in great detail. At first my mind, hungry for\nknowledge, would be indiscriminately satisfied with any diet that was\npreferred to it…Subsequently I withdrew into myself; I began to\nquestion everything, and to examine facts themselves as though no one\nhad ever said anything about them, which is the proper method\n[“modus”, QNS: 92] of acquiring knowledge. I\nbroke everything down into its ultimate first principles. Beginning as\nI did, my reflection at this point, the more I reflected the more I\ndoubted. (TNK: 167) \nHere is Descartes in the Discourse:  \nFrom my childhood I have been nourished upon letters, and because I\nwas persuaded that by their means one could acquire a clear and\ncertain knowledge of all that is useful in life, I was extremely eager\nto learn them. But as soon as I had completed the course of study at\nthe end of which one is formally admitted to the ranks of the learned,\nI completely changed my opinion. I had found myself beset by so many\ndoubts and errors that I came to think I had gained nothing from my\nattempts to become educated but increasing recognition of my\nignorance. (Descartes 1637 [PWD: 112–113]) \nHe will later say that among the steps included in his method is the\ndirection of his mind into the “simplest and most easily known\nobjects in order to ascend little by little, step by step, to\nknowledge of the most complex” (1637 [PWD: 120]), which even if\nit is not exactly what Sanches meant by “first principles”\n[“extrema principia”, QNS: 92], it does sound a\nlot like it. \nIn any case, one of the first to note the similarities in tone, and\neven to go as far as to declare Sanches a precursor of Descartes was\nÉtienne Gilson in his commentary on Discours de la\nméthode (1925). More than Charron or the Montaigne of\nApologie de Raimond Sebond (1580), it is Sanches, says\nGilson, who seems to have had the greater impact on Descartes’\ndoubt and his response to the sceptical position (1925: 267, 268;\nPaganini 2009: 254–255), given the “striking parallelism\nof their respective experiences” (1925: 267, my translation). In\nfact, the linking of their names in the seventeenth century at the\nuniversities of Utrecht, Groningen and Leiden, says Limbrick, is what\nled them to be considered Pyrrhonian sceptics with atheistic leanings\n(TNK: 82). What nonetheless remains unknown is when and how Descartes\ncame across Quod nihil scitur. In Les premières\npensées de Descartes (1979), Henri Gouhier conjectures\nthat Descartes might have come across Quod nihil scitur\nsometime during his student years at La Flèche\n(1606–1614), or read the 1618 Frankfurt edition of the treatise\n(1979: 116), “when he was in Frankfurt for the coronation of the\nEmperor Ferdinand II in 1619” (Limbrick 1988: 83). According to\nLimbrick the Frankfurt 1618 edition of Quod nihil scitur\nseems to have impacted the European philosophical scene, and to have\ncontributed to Sanches’ reputation as a leading Pyrrhonian\nsceptic (1988: 85). What is not at all convincing is that Descartes\nwould have been apprised of Sanches’ treatise through a letter\naddressed by someone by the name of Huebner (supposedly an English\ndoctor), to Marin Mersenne. \nThis letter of August, 1641, can be found in Correspondance du P.\nMarin Mersenne, religieux minime. X, Du 6 août 1640 à fin\ndécembre 1641 (1967: 730) wherein the author praises\nSanches’ ingenious exaggerations concerning the possibility of\nacquiring perfect knowledge, and criticizes Cartesianism for not being\nable to advance (“non progreditur”) beyond its\n“hyperbolical doubt” (1967: 730) . But again, the letter\nis too late to serve as proof of Descartes’ knowledge of\nSanches’ treatise prior to the writing and publication of the\nDiscourse. Its intended target seems to have been an\nobjection to the perceived scepticism of the Meditations.\nThus, if Mersenne informed Descartes of Huebner’s letter\ncomparing his work to that Sanches’s, then the letter would only\nhave apprised Descartes that he was being compared with the Iberian\n“Pyrrhonist”, which would not have made Descartes very\nhappy, given that by this time he had grown tired of answering\nobjections and trying to explain why his method was instead intended\nto dispel scepticism and ground a science on clear and distinct ideas\n(Mullin 2000: 8). Therefore, if we can imagine Descartes being upset\nabout being compared with Sanches, one can at least partially\nunderstand why he would be so, and would “refuse” to\nanswer the objection (Mullin 2000: 8). It has been conjectured, for\ninstance, that Descartes might have been thinking of Sanches when he\nwrote in the Discourse that the reason for his undertaking\nwas not to imitate or to copy “the sceptics, who doubt only for\nthe sake of doubting” but rather “to reach\ncertainty” (1637 [PWD: 125]). Significantly, while most\nscholars of Sanches’ work have noted the similarities between\nSanches and Descartes, for others like Joseph Moreau (1960) and\nJoaquim de Carvalho (1955), there are significant differences. These\nsimilarities displayed in two parallel columns in the introduction to\nSanches’ Opera philosophica (1955: xxx–xxxiii),\nmerely establish, argues Carvalho, a “correlation of\nwords” (1955: xxxiii, my translation). One important difference\nbetween the two thinkers, says Carvalho, is that although Sanches\ndoubts our perfect knowledge of external things, he never doubts their\nexistence. This obviously was not the case for Descartes, for whom the\nsearch for certainty was the search for whatever knowledge could be\nacquired through the light of reason, and not through the senses. Thus\nfor Moreau one major difference between them was their opposing views\nconcerning the truths of mathematics (1960: 30–34): for Sanches\na posteriori and dubitable; for Descartes a priori\nand indubitable. What they did share was a rejection of the Scholastic\nappeal to external authority. For Descartes, the opinions of others\ncould never lead to the kind of certainty only a mind\n(cogito) reflecting on the content of its own thoughts could\nreach; and for Sanches the opinions of scholarly\nauthorities—however illustrious—did not help us to arrive\nat perfect knowledge. The assumed “knowledge” of the\nauthorities was derived from syllogistic and demonstrative logic,\nwhich depended on the circularity of its definitions and premises\n(verba) to arrive at their conclusions concerning things\n(rerum). More often than not, these Aristotelian scholars\nwith their verbal gymnastics created great confusion out of what was\notherwise clear, even to a child. \nThough a number of Sanches’ contemporaries accused him of\nadvocating a radical form of Academic scepticism that led to\natheism—as also occurred with Descartes—Sanches’\nsceptical project was not, as it may first seem given the title of the\ntreatise, either dogmatic or wholly destructive. And on this vital\npoint Richard H. Popkin (1963: ix; 1964: 42) and Gianni Paganini\n(2009: 249) concur. For Paganini, in fact,  \nSanches’s Quod nihil scitur contains, besides a\nskeptical demolition, also a pars construens, which seems\nparticularly relevant in order to understand the Cartesian certainty\nabout reflexive knowledge, typically the cogito. (2009: 249)\n \nThe personal crisis experienced by Sanches and Descartes which\nmotivated their epistemological inquiry concerning what could and\ncould not be known with certainty, was responded to by means of\nself-reflection. In both cases, albeit with very different approaches,\nthe self was the only legislator of certainty, and the only thing that\ncould be counted upon in founding a science: in Descartes’ case,\nfounded on unquestionable internal, logical principles (“I\ncannot doubt my own existence”), and in Sanches’\ncase, founded on the material things (rerum) the I\nperceives, albeit imperfectly. Significantly, what constituted the\ncertainty of the internal states for Descartes did not constitute\ncertainty for Sanches, and moreover such “certainty” could\nnot serve as the foundation of a true science. In this respect,\nwhereas the late sixteenth century Sanches was operating within a\npre-Galilean Weltanschauung, Descartes undertaking studies in physics\nand astronomy that paralleled those of Galileo and\n“Galilean” science with its emphasis on mathematical\ndemonstration. For Descartes, mathematics was the language of Nature,\nand even physical things or “natural phenomena” were\nmathematical, as he stated in the “Principles of\nPhilosophy” (1644 [PWD: 247]). This was clearly not the case\nfor Sanches, who in his letter to Clavius\n (§2.2),\n denied the universal and a priori truths of mathematics,\nreducing mathematics to mere empirical measurement. In short, if\nDescartes’ method culminated in the “indubitable”\ntruths of mathematics placed at the service of sciences like physics,\noptics, and astronomy, Sanches’ sceptical method, with its\nacceptance of imperfect knowledge, culminated in the probable and\nempirical “truths” of the science of medicine. Descartes,\nthe philosopher, mathematician, and physicist; Sanches, the\nphilosopher and physician: the former emphasized the mind over the\nbody (res cogitans over res extensa), and the latter\nthe body over the mind. \nDoubtlessly, such a generalization can only be taken so far; for\nDescartes too wanted to “replace the speculative philosophy\ntaught in the schools” with a “practical philosophy”\nthat would employ his method even in an applied science like medicine,\nwhose primary goal was to maintain the health of the body: “the\nchief good and the foundation of all the other goods in life”\n(1637 [PWD: 142–143]). Most importantly was (1) their equal\nconcern with formulating a method that would allow them to arrive at\nknowledge of the world, and (2) the constructive aspect of their\nrespective scepticism, which in both cases was a starting point. And\nthough it seems by all accounts that Descartes integrated\nSanches’ autobiographical narrative into the Discourse on\nthe Method, without due attribution, their projects were quite\ndifferent: one epistemologically based on sense perception, the other\nmetaphysically based on internal (a priori) first principles.\nIronically, it has been argued that Descartes turned “first\nphilosophy” into epistemology. \nRegardless of the extent of the debt Descartes owed Sanches, great or\nsmall, it is undeniable that even as a background figure in Cartesian\nstudies, Sanches holds a noteworthy place firstly in the history of\nscepticism, and secondly in the history of modern philosophy. Possibly\nthanks to Limbrick and Thomson’s English edition of Quod\nnihil scitur, Sanches was at last acknowledged as a source in\nCartesian studies in Ariew, Cottingham, and Sorell’s\nDescartes’ Meditations: Background Source Materials\n(1998). Here, along with some new translations of selected passages\nfrom Quod nihil scitur, John Cottingham writes that  \nthough Sanches, unlike Descartes, proposes no new method for the\nacquisition of knowledge, he does produce some interesting\nanticipations of the Cartesian approach, particularly when he\ndistinguishes between “external” objects of cognition and\nthe “inner” objects of the mind (e.g., its own inner\nawareness of its willing and thinking. (Cottingham 1998: 9)  \nBut this is as much as Cottingham is willing to concede to Sanches,\nfor ultimately Sanches remains for him a man “trapped in the\ninescapable ignorance of the pre-Enlightenment world” (1998: 9).\nIn some ways this has been the unfortunate fate of Sanches until very\nrecently: to be considered an interesting but insignificant\nphilosopher. This in part is due to the fact that the history of\nphilosophy used to be presented as a series of ex nihilo\nevents bearing the names of Plato, Aristotle,\n Immanuel Kant (1724–1804),\n etc., as though one day there was nothing and then the next day there\nemerged, for example, the figure/event we know by the name of Kant.\nBut fortunately philosophy is no longer presented or taught this way.\nTherefore, if Sanches was not a major philosopher, the originality of\nhis work, for example, combining “medieval epistemological ideas\nand ancient sceptical habits of thinking” (Yrjönsuuri 2000:\n243)—certainly impacted the work of other philosophers of his\ntime and beyond. However, because no else would pay attention, certain\nearly twentieth century Portuguese and Spanish thinkers, often for\nnationalistic reasons, turned Sanches into the Spanish or Portuguese\n“precursor” of Descartes, Bacon, Hobbes, and Kant.  \nOne such writer was Teófilo [Teophilo] Braga (1843–1924),\na philologist and essayist, who was the second elected president of\nthe first Portuguese Republic (1911–1914). Not surprisingly,\nthen, in his 1881 essay “O portuguez Sanches, precursor do\npositivismo” (The Portuguese Sanches, precursor of positivism)\nBraga presented Sanches as precursor of\n Francis Bacon (1551–1626)\n and the nineteenth century positivism of\n Auguste Comte (1798–1856).\n And because Braga viewed Comte as a representative of the values of\nscience and republicanism, the “Portuguese Sanches”\n(supposedly “born in Braga”) Sanches served as the perfect\nprecursor of the positivist ideas Braga himself embraced. \nIn Spain, Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo argued in his essay\n“De los orígenes del criticismo y del escepticismo y\nespecialmente de los precursores españoles de Kant”\n(1918, On the origins of critique and scepticism and especially in the\nSpanish precursors of Kant) that given the similarity of the opening\npages of Descartes’s Discourse on the Method and\nSanches’ Quod nihil scitur, it was obvious that\nCartesianism was in large part the product of ideas stolen from\nSpanish philosophy (1918: 186). But nowhere in the essay does\nMenéndez y Pelayo prove this, or bother to consider the\ndifferences between Sanches and Descartes. As to Kant’s debt to\nSanches, he has little to say on this matter, except that some of\nSanches’ ideas about God, eternity, and the creation of the\nworld, anticipated Kant’s notion of the antinomies (1918: 195).\nFinally, the only thing that he says with some level of sobriety with\nrespect to Kant and Sanches, is that they both made manifest the idea\nthat one can believe in God without having to believe in metaphysics\nor logical demonstrations (1918: 196), and that was probably in order\nto accommodate philosophy with Spanish Catholicism. \nInterestingly, thirteen years earlier, in 1905, Eloy Bullón y\nFernández, wrote in Los Precursores españoles de\nBacon y Descartes that Sanches had anticipated Descartes,\nBacon, and Comte (1905: 181). But here the tone is more conciliatory\nand sober, and Bullón y Fernández takes the trouble to\ncall attention not only to similarities, but also to the differences\nbetween these thinkers. He recognizes, for instance, that while both\nSanchez and Descartes begin their project with a critique of\nscholasticism, and particularly, a critique of the appeal to\nauthority, their initial battle call, Sanches’ dismissal of\nmetaphysics and its replacement with empiricism was not shared by\nDescartes (1905: 170); and neither was it by Bacon, despite the\nlatter’s questioning of the syllogism in the Novum\nOrganum. What, according to Bullón y Fernández,\nSanches shares with Bacon is a belief in the observation of things\n(res) over the analysis of words (verba). And one\ncan certainly hear echoes of Sanches in aphorism XIII from the\nNovum Organum when Bacon writes:  \nThe syllogism is not applied to the principles of the sciences, and is\nof no avail in intermediate axioms, as being very unequal to the\nsubtlety of nature. It forces assent, therefore, and not things\n[res]. (1620 [1902: 13–14])  \nWhere they part ways is that while Sanches did not trust the senses,\nBacon believed that one could arrive at certain truths through the\nobservation of natural phenomena, and thereby avoid “the\narrogance of dogmatism, and the despair of scepticism” (1620\n[1902: 5]). Now, what Sanches had in common with Kant, says\nBullón y Fernández, is that neither one nor the other\nbelieved that the mind was capable of apprehending the things\nthemselves (1905: 179). \nWhat is missing from all these studies of Sanches who posit him as\nprecursor of this or that major philosopher—from Braga (1881) to\nBullón y Fernández (1905), Menéndez y Palayo\n(1918), and Fernando A. Palacios (1972: 23–28) to Carlos Mellizo\n(1982: 52–64)—is a certain lack of rigor. More fruitful\nwould be to consider Sanches as a representative of modern scepticism\nwith roots going back to ancient scepticism—someone whose form\nof scepticism impacted modern philosophy, even in cases where it went\nunacknowledged, as in the case of Kant. To this point, Dumont writes\nthat Kant’s silence was historical in his dismissal of\nPyrrhonist and Academic scepticism; in his lack of knowledge regarding\nSextus Empiricus; and in designating Hume as the only author\nrepresentative of scepticism (1972: 73): as though Hume was not\nhimself responding to sceptics like Sextus Empiricus or Carneades. But\nas M.F. Burnyeat explains in “The Sceptic in his Place and\nTime”, in Kant’s silence regarding the sceptics,\nscepticism itself became “the name of something internal to the\nphilosopher’s own thinking, his alter ego as it were”\n(1987: 35).  \nTwo philosophers who did acknowledge the importance of scepticism for\nphilosophy were\n G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716)\n and\n G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831;\n 1801 [1985]). As a matter of fact, in response to a letter by French\nmathematician, Pierre Varignon (1654–1722), who had asked him\nfor some clarification on what he meant by\n“infinitesimal”, Leibniz reference’s Sanches’\nQuod nihil scitur and his challenge to Clavius with some\nadmiration. Such scepticism, he says to Varignon, is important because\nit keeps mathematics from becoming a dogmatic science (cf. de Olaso\n1987: 149–150). The questions raised by sceptics like Sextus\nEmpiricus and Sanches, says Leibniz, are key for “establishing\nsound foundations for a science” ([1702 [1970: 544]). Leibniz\nwrites:  \nI have often thought that a reply by a geometrician to the objections\nof Sextus Empiricus and to the things which Francis Sanchez, author of\nthe book Quod nihil scitur, sent to Clavius, or to similar\ncritics, would be more useful than we can imagine. (1702 [1970: 544])\n \nThus perchance, in Leibniz’s generous appreciation of the\nsceptics’ challenge to dialectical and metaphysical dogmatism,\nlies the answer to what Dumont calls Kant’s\n“silence”: that which according to the author of the\nCritique of Pure Reason did not need to be named, because it\nwas always at the heart of the philosophical enterprise. \nIn the Introduction to Scepticism from the Renaissance to the\nEnlightenment, the editors Richard H. Popkin and Charles B.\nSchmitt write that “Little effort seems to be made to study the\nclassical formulations, and the development of these from Sextus at\nleast to Hume and Kant” (1987: 10); and while that may certainly\nbe true, even less effort has been made to include twentieth century\nphilosophers. In the introduction to Que nada se sabe,\nFernando A. Palacios states that for Sanches there was no difference\nbetween logic and rhetoric, as they both culminated in a series of\nlanguage games (1972: 24). Now, it would certainly be wrong to take\nthis analogy too far without due rigorous study, but there are moments\nin Sanches’ scepticism regarding the truths of metaphysics and\nlanguage that remind one of the\n Wittgenstein\n of the Philosophical Investigations (cf. Fogelin 1981).\n“Sanchez’s Quod nihil scitur almost reads like a\ntwentieth century text of analytic philosophy”, wrote Popkin\n(1964: 41). And here, for example, such a comparison, and there are\nmany (e.g., Mikko Yrjönsuuri’s with the homunculus\nof philosophy of mind “who understands mental\nrepresentations”, 2000: 239), could be a worthwhile starting\npoint. The history of scepticism is inseparable from the history of\nphilosophy, and the history runs backwards and forwards. In that\nhistory, Francisco Sanches, even as a “minor” figure, had\nsubstantial things to say about philosophy, and we need to overcome\nthe traditional assessments of Sanches, such as J. Iriarte’s\n(1940: 449–451) or Frederick Copleston’s for whom Sanches\n“was prevented by his sceptical attitude from making positive\nand constructive suggestions” (1953: 230). Quite to the\ncontrary, I agree with Agostino Lupoli (2009) that Sanches’\nscepticism was constructive and mitigated, and was intended as a form\nof intellectual therapy. Hence the “Quid?” with which he\nended his writings, and with which all philosophy worthy of the name\nbegins.","contact.mail":"rperez@hunter.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"hunter.cuny.edu"}]
