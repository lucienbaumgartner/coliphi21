The\nbeginnings of Arabic philosophy coincide with the production of the\nfirst extensive translation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics,\nwithin the circle of translators associated with the founder of Arabic\nphilosophy, al-Kindī. The so-called “early” or\n“classical” phase of falsafa ends with the\nlargest commentary on the Metaphysics available in Western\nphilosophy, by Ibn Rushd (Averroes). The following\n“golden” age of Arabic thought continues to be primarily\nconcerned with metaphysics, turning from the effort of interpreting\nthe intricacies of Aristotle’s canonical text towards the\nprocess of assimilating the model of metaphysical science first\noutlined by al-Fārābī and then implemented by Ibn\nSīnā (Avicenna).\n\n\nIn the incipit of the Metaphysics according to the\nArabic way of ordering the books of this work (book Alpha Elatton,\nchapter 1), Arabic philosophers could even find the justification of\ntheir Greek pedigree and their raison d’être in a\npredominantly religious society: philosophy is said there to be\nconstitutively a “search” and to be directed towards a\ngoal—truth—that surpasses human individual capacities both\nobjectively, for its extremely wide scope, and subjectively, for the\nweakness of man’s cognitive faculties, thus obliging its\nfollowers to join their efforts with all previous and present\ninvestigators of truth. This explains the large fortune of this\nproemium, and of the similitude accompanying it (the human intellect,\nwith respect to the most knowable things, is like bats’ eyes\nwith respect to daylight), not only in philosophy, but also in\ntheology and literature, to such an extent that its different versions\ncan be taken as specimens of the various understandings of the nature\nand possibilities of falsafa, and of the degree of its\ndependence on Greek thought, in the history of Arabic-Islamic\nphilosophy.\n\n\nThis impression of centrality is confirmed by the large number and\ngreat variety of works pertaining to metaphysics written in\nArabic—translations of the basic Greek texts, different kinds of\ncommentaries on the translated material, original works with various\ndegrees of comprehensiveness and doctrinal depth, etc.—all of\nwhich provide clear evidence of the intellectual vivacity and the\nproductive energy of this philosophical area. Such an intensive\nreflection on metaphysics leads to what represents the specific Arabic\ncontribution to the history of this discipline, namely the progressive\ndevising of a new standard of metaphysics, in which this discipline\nassumes the form of a comprehensive and articulated synthesis of the\nGreek heritage, undergoes a process of epistemological\nrefinement—in terms of definition of scope, coherence of\nstructure, rigorousness of arguments, etc.—and ascends to the\nrole of cornerstone of philosophy. This process brings forth a real\n“second beginning” of metaphysics in the history of\nphilosophy, whose model eventually prevailed in philosophical circles,\ndespite occasional criticisms motivated by an anachronistic desire to\ndefend the Greek legacy in its uncontaminated form. Non-philosophical\nforms of knowledge—above all revealed theology—also had to\nconfront the challenge posed by metaphysics. The vigorous and\nlong-lasting impact of this metaphysical paradigm in non-Arabic and\nnon-Muslim cultural areas, like the Latin-Christian and the\nHebrew-Jewish, attests to its great doctrinal and epistemological\nattractiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above considerations show that the fate of metaphysics as a branch\nof philosophy in the Arabic speaking world and in Muslim societies\ncoincides, by and large, with the reception, transmission and\ntransformation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics. The\nanti-Aristotelian tendencies of the early phase of Arabic philosophy,\nmarked by the adoption of a decidedly Platonic stance in metaphysics\nand the consequent rejection of Aristotle’s teaching, evident in\nthe views of Abū Bakr Muḥammad Ibn Zakariyāʾ\nal-Rāzī (d. ca. 925), remained a local and short-lived\nphenomenon. In mainstream Arabic philosophy, the Metaphysics\nrepresented for centuries the centerpiece of the corresponding\ndiscipline. Aristotle’s work is the only Greek work mentioned in\nconnection with metaphysics in the Arabic classifications of the\nsciences. No other Greek metaphysical work was translated and\ncommented upon in the same continuous, widespread and multiform\nmanner, or quoted so often and extensively in original treatises.\nOther vehicles of Greek metaphysical thought, like the Theologia\nAristotelis, whose avowed aim was to make Aristotle’s work\ncompatible with Islamic creationism by means of the Neoplatonic\ndoctrine of emanation, stress from the outset the primacy of the\nMetaphysics as the fundamental text of metaphysics, and\nfictively portray Aristotle as the author of the adaptation of the\nPlotinian material by means of which the desired completion of the\nMetaphysics is performed. If the\nMetaphysics—as well as the entire Aristotelian\ncorpus—underwent a gradual eclipse in post-Avicennian\nArabic philosophy, this was not due to a decline of its prestige, but\nto the success of Avicenna’s incorporation of the text and the\ndoctrine of Aristotle’s work in his new encyclopedia of the\nphilosophical sciences, The Cure or Healing\n(Al-Šifāʾ) where he constantly stresses his\nreliance on the teaching of the “First Master” (Aristotle)\nand his disciples. \nSchematically, Arab authors adopted three main ways of approaching the\ntext of Aristotle’s Metaphysics, corresponding to three\ndifferent literary genres. The first approach, which can be called\n“taxonomical”, is found in classificatory essays whose\ngoal is to outline the content of the Metaphysics and to\nclarify its place in the Aristotelian corpus, and to indicate\nthe position of the discipline of metaphysics in the system of\nknowledge. The “exegetical” approach is represented by\ncommentaries that aim at explaining, with different degrees of\nliteralness and comprehensiveness, the content of the\nMetaphysics. The tendency to adaptation, finally, is visible\nin metaphysical treatises that reformulate the doctrine of\nAristotle’s work and are intended as original elaborations,\nregardless of the degree of dependence on their Greek model. All main\nauthors who considered metaphysics approached Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics, to different extents and degrees, from these\nvarious perspectives. \nFrom the doctrinal point of view, Arabic interpreters of the\nMetaphysics debated three basic theoretical issues. First of\nall, they reflected on the scientific configuration of the discipline\npresented by Aristotle in his work, with special focus on fundamental\naspects such as its subject-matter (namely the issue of whether\nmetaphysics is a philosophical theology, or an ontology, or both),\nstructure, method, and position in the system of knowledge. This\nconsideration of the epistemic status of metaphysics took into account\nan enlarged Aristotelian corpus, which included within\ntheoretical philosophy a mathematics based on Euclid and Ptolemy\n(since Aristotle himself wrote no treatise on mathematics), and\ncomplemented the Metaphysics with pseudo-Aristotelian\nNeoplatonic metaphysical works (the Plotinian Theologia\nAristotelis and the Proclean Liber de causis). The\nsecond concern is the investigation of specific doctrines related to\nthe distinct issues within the Metaphysics. The prominent\ntopics within the study of being qua being, or ontology, are\nthe various aspects of the theory of essence, like the clarification\nof its relationship with form and substance, the discussion of the\nepistemological and ontological status of universals, etc. Of central\nimportance in cosmology is the debate about the eternity vs. the\norigination of the world, and the mode of the universe’s\nproduction by the First Principle, whether by way of emanation from\nIts own essence or creation ex nihilo. In philosophical\ntheology, finally, the features that Aristotle ascribes to the divine\nUnmoved Mover, with particular regard to Its unity, necessity and\nintellectual nature, provide the starting-points for far-reaching\ndevelopments. The third concern is the discussion of the relationship\nof the philosophical theology contained in Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics with Islam, namely the assessment of the degree\nof compatibility between the rational conception of the divinity\ntransmitted by Greek philosophy, on the one hand, and the image of God\nconveyed by Islamic prophetic revelation, on the other. The assumption\nof the oneness of truth, common among Arabic philosophers, allows the\nmetaphysical part of philosophy to provide a rational and coherent\naccount of the same divine realm disclosed by revelation, thereby\nputting it in competition with Islamic theology. The results of these\nthree doctrinal concerns are interconnected, since a certain view of\nmetaphysics as a science, and a certain stand on specific doctrinal\npoints, can enhance or reduce the affinity of metaphysics with Islamic\nreligion and the possibility of its integration into Muslim culture. A\nconception of metaphysics that limits the scope of this science to\nphilosophical theology and minimizes the relevance of the general\ndoctrine of being is particularly apt to underscore its compatibility\nwith Islam. By contrast, a view of metaphysics in which the\nontological dimension, in addition to the theological, plays a\nprominent role, and in which the First Principle’s properties\nare discordant, rather than congruent, with the Islamic divine\nattributes, goes in the opposite direction. \nThe different textual approaches and theoretical solutions to the\naforementioned problems are assumed here as guidelines for the\narticulation of the history of the Arabic reception of the\nMetaphysics. On this basis, seven main chronological periods\ncan be roughly distinguished. The first five phases culminate in the\nsixth, i.e., in Avicenna, who emerges, at the present stage of\nresearch, as the turning point of the history of Arabic\nmetaphysics. \nThe translation activity regarding the Metaphysics continued\nuninterruptedly for three centuries (the ninth to the eleventh), with\nthe production of several Arabic versions of Aristotle’s text,\nsome of which might have depended on Syriac intermediaries, and the\ninvolvement of a number of different translators, belonging to the\nmain schools of Arabic philosophy. These translations display\ndifferent degrees of inclusiveness (from integral versions of\nAristotle’s work to translations of its single books) and\nliteralness (from strict word for word procedures to styles more akin\nto paraphrase). Cumulatively, the Arabic translations of the\nMetaphysics evidence the intention of making the entire text\nof Aristotle’s work accessible to Arabic readers, extending the\ntranslation activity from the main bulk of the work towards more\nperipheral books, like Alpha Meizon (I) and Nu (XIV). Equally clear is\nthe effort to provide an Arabic version increasingly faithful to the\nGreek original and more respondent to philosophical clarity, and a\nspecial focus on the repeatedly translated book Lambda (XII). Also\nremarkable is the inclusion in the translation activity of the main\navailable Greek commentaries on the Metaphysics, namely those\nof Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius (less certain is the case\nof Syrianus’ commentary), whose explanations of book Lambda\n(and, in the case of Syrianus, Beta (III)) were translated together\nwith the corresponding books of Aristotle’s work. Since other\nGreek works intimately related to Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics were also translated into Arabic—like\nTheophrastus’s On First Principles, the metaphysical\nsection of Nicholas of Damascus’s On the Philosophy of\nAristotle, Alexander of Aphrodisias’s On the Principles\nof the Universe, the De aeternitate mundi contra\nAristotelem and other cosmological writings of\nPhiloponus—the entire Greek exegetical tradition of the\nMetaphysics, from Aristotle’s first disciples\n(Theophrastus) to his last interpreters/reformers (Philoponus), was\navailable to Arabic-speaking scholars. \nOn account of its long duration, the high rank of the scholars it\nengaged, and the breadth of its scope this area of the overall\ntranslation movement from Greek into Arabic cannot be reduced to a\nmere preliminary phase of the Arabic reception of the\nMetaphysics, but rather provides a specimen of the main\ntrends that characterized the first centuries of its history. \nAl-Kindī (d. after 870) engaged in a taxonomic approach to\nAristotle’s corpus, on the basis of a number of\nunidentified Greek sources of Neoplatonic heritage (Treatise on\nthe Quantity of Aristotle’s Books and What is Required to Attain\nPhilosophy, Risāla fī kammiyyat kutub\nArisṭāṭālīs wa-mā yuḥtaǧu\nilayhi fī taḥṣīl al-falsafa). In this\ntreatise, he expresses an ambivalent view of the place of the\nMetaphysics in the corpus, by presenting\nAristotle’s work as the culmination of a four-fold division of\nphilosophy into mathematics, logic, physics, and metaphysics, but also\nas preliminary to the knowledge of ethics. The description of the\ncontent of the Metaphysics is limited to the part of this\nwork dealing with philosophical theology (the study of immaterial\nthings), and contains explicit references to Islamic tenets such as\nGod’s oneness, the divine names, and providence. \nDue to the loss of what might have been a specific commentary on the\nMetaphysics (attested under the title of Inclusive\nPhilosophy, Falsafa dāḫila), the exegetical tendencies\nof al-Kindī can only be guessed. His extant works on metaphysics\nindicate the adoption of the paraphrase as explanatory technique, and\na special attention to book Alpha Elatton (II, the first book of the\nMetaphysics in the Arab tradition), intended as introductory\nto the theological themes of book Lambda. \nAl-Kindī’s main metaphysical treatise (Book on First\nPhilosophy, Kitāb fī l-falsafa\nal-ūlā, only partially extant) displays monotheistic\nconcerns (the insistence on the theme of God’s unity, with\nrecourse to a model of the God-world relationship reminiscent of the\nNeoplatonic metaphysics of Theologia Aristotelis and\nLiber de causis), and the adoption of the doctrine of the\ncreation of the universe in time (derived from Philoponus). The\nexplicit encomiastic references to Aristotle occurring at the\nbeginning (with extensive paraphrastic excerpts of\nMetaphysics Alpha Elatton) and the abrupt switch to the\nthemes of Book Lambda (albeit treated in an un-Aristotelian vein)\nconfirm that the one-sided theologizing approach to the\nMetaphysics is directed at showing the compatibility of Greek\nmetaphysics with Islamic religion. Thus, al-Kindī often portrays\nphilosophy in general, and metaphysics in particular, as the\ndiscipline deputed to give full articulation and rational explanation\nto the miraculous conciseness of the prophetic message (besides the\ncentral section of On the Quantity of Aristotle’s\nBooks, see also the Epistle on the Explanation of the\nProsternation of the Extreme Body and its Obedience to God,\nRisāla fī l-Ibāna ʿan suǧūd al-ǧirm\nal-aqṣā wa-ṭāʿatihī\nli-llāhi). \nThe view of metaphysics as essentially a science of the divine being,\nrather than of being in general, and the intent of underscoring its\naffinity, once assimilated with philosophical theology, with Islam,\nwas also characteristic of al-Kindī’s direct disciples and\nthe “school” of authors inspired by his teaching or\ndependent on his same sources. This is evident both in classifications\nof the sciences (Qusṭā ibn Lūqā, d. 912; Ibn\nFarīġūn, 10th century, the Rasāʾil\nof the Iḫwān al-Ṣafāʾ, written around\n961–986; Miskawayh, d. 1030), and in independent treatises\nrelated to metaphysics (see Abū Sulaymān\nal-Manṭiqī al-Siǧistānī, d. ca. 985, and his\nschool; Abū l-Ḥasan Muḥammad ibn Yūsuf\nal-ʿĀmirī, d. 992). \nAccording to historical sources, Ṯābit ibn Qurra (d. 901)\nmight have revised the translation into Arabic of Themistius’\nparaphrase of Metaphysics Lambda. More importantly, this\nauthor wrote the first known extant Arabic commentary on the\nMetaphysics, still glossed by Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) four\ncenturies later, according to the method of concise exposition\n(talḫīṣ), i.e., isolating the most relevant\npoints of the commented text. This commentary shares with\nal-Kindī’s works a special regard for the place of\nphilosophical theology within metaphysics, since it focuses on book\nLambda of Aristotle’s Metaphysics. Also Kindian is the\neffort to accommodate Islamic monotheism, by insisting on the oneness\nand willful action of God, and by adopting the Porphyrian theme of the\nharmony between Aristotle’s and Plato’s teaching. At\nvariance with al-Kindī, by contrast, is Ṯābit’s\nendorsing of the doctrine of the eternity of the world, rather than\nits creation in time, against Philoponus, and the minimal reliance on\nNeoplatonic writings. The background of the commentary is decidedly\nAristotelian, with some possible influence of the Peripatetic\ncommentators (most notably Themistius, who however is never\nmentioned); nonetheless, Ṯābit revises some crucial tenets\nof Aristotle’s philosophical theology, by understanding, for\nexample, the First Mover as the first cause not only of the motion of\nthe universe, but also of its existence. \nBesides more traditional overviews of the works of Aristotle and the\nplace of the Metaphysics among them (What Ought to be\nPremised to the Learning of Aristotle’s Philosophy, Mā\nyanbaġī an yuqaddama qabla taʿallum falsafat\nAriṣṭū; Aristotle’s Philosophy and Its\nParts, Falsafat Arisṭūṭālīs\nwa-aǧzāʾ falsafatihī),\nal-Fārābī (d. 950) also provided taxonomic accounts in\nwhich the Metaphysics is related to the system of the\nphilosophical and Islamic sciences, rather than to the Aristotelian\ncorpus of writings. In the most important and influential\nessay of this type, the Enumeration of the Sciences\n(Iḥṣāʾ al-ʿulūm), he portrays\nmetaphysics as a discipline having a precise method (demonstration)\nand an articulated structure, in which a full-fledged ontology (the\nstudy of being qua being) in its different aspects precedes,\nfirst, a part dealing with the foundation of the other sciences and,\nsecond, a philosophical theology concerned, among other things, with\nIslamic issues such as God’s attributes, divine names and\nactions. In all these classificatory treatises, the position of the\nMetaphysics with respect to the other works of Aristotle, or\nof metaphysics with respect to the other philosophical disciplines, is\nnot stable, but varies according to the particular perspective that\nal-Fārābī adopts: significantly, in some of them\nmetaphysics is presented as the culmination of the entire system of\nknowledge, for example, in The Philosophy of Aristotle. \nThe consideration of the entire Metaphysics, and the view of\nmetaphysics as universal science, are the pivotal elements of the\nshort introduction to the Metaphysics written by\nal-Fārābī, following the model of the Prolegomena of\nGreek Late Antiquity and the teaching of Ammonius Son of Hermeias and\nhis Aristotelian school in Alexandria. This essay, On the Goals of\nthe Sage [= Aristotle] in Each Treatise of the Book Marked by\nMeans of Letters [= Metaphysics] (Maqāla\n… fī Aġrāḍ al-ḥakīm fī\nkull maqāla min al-kitāb al-mawsūm\nbi-l-ḥurūf), represents the first integral exegesis of\nthe Metaphysics extant in Arabic and reveals\nal-Fārābī’s dependence on the epistemology of the\nnewly translated Posterior Analytics.\nFārābī’s use of a style of exegesis stemming from\nthe Peripatetic tradition is a manifestation of his affiliation with\nthe coeval school of Baghdad Aristotelians. The main point of the work\nis that metaphysics is more encompassing than, and not reducible to,\nthe philosophical theology of book Lambda. Following this aim,\nal-Fārābī first rejects the attempts to interpret\nAristotle’s work along Neoplatonic and monotheistic lines (in\nthis he has probably in mind al-Kindī’s theologizing\nconception of metaphysics), and advocates a type of explanation akin\nto that of the Greek commentators (Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius). Then he derives from the universal nature of metaphysics,\nunderstood as the science having being qua being as its\nsubject-matter, indications regarding its scope (it incorporates a\npart on philosophical theology, namely on the doctrine of the first\ncauses of being), as well as on its oneness as an universal science\n(there cannot be more than one universal science), its name (by being\nmore general than physics it is also “after” physics) and\nits overall content. Finally, he concludes with a brief description of\neach of the books of Aristotle’s work known to him, in which the\ncontent of book Lambda is summarized with no religious overtones. In\nthis way, al-Fārābī extracts from Aristotle’s\nwork a coherent and all-encompassing outline of an “ideal”\nscience of metaphysics; this project will guide the following\ngenerations of Arabic metaphysicians, in particular Avicenna, to build\na new science of metaphysics according to Farabian parameters. \nIn al-Fārābī’s main works on political\nphilosophy, philosophical theology is the only part of metaphysics\nthat functions as preliminary—together with human noetics,\nman’s destiny in the after-life, and prophecy—to the\naccount of the organization of the ideal state (Principles of the\nOpinions of the Inhabitants of the Virtuous City, Mabādiʾ\nĀrāʾ Ahl al-Madīna al-Fāḍila).\nOther works of his, on the other hand, deal specifically with\nontological themes. Among them, the Book of Letters\n(Kitāb al-Ḥurūf, which is not, properly\nspeaking, a commentary on the Metaphysics, despite the title\nechoing one of the Arabic names of Aristotle’s work) follows a\npattern analogous to that of Book Delta (V) of the\nMetaphysics; the treatise On One and Unity\n(Fī l-wāḥid wa-l-waḥda) is thematically\nlinked to Book Iota (X); the refutation of Philoponus’ criticism\nof Aristotle is a reassessment of the thesis of the eternity of the\nworld. Scattered references to the Metaphysics, with regard\nto distinct topics, surface also in the famous Book on the\nAgreement of the Opinions of the Two Sages, the Divine Plato and\nAristotle (Kitāb al-Ǧamʿ bayna raʾyay\nal-ḥakīmayn Aflāṭūn al-ilāhī\nwa-Arisṭūṭālīs), which resumes the\nPorphyrian theme of the harmony between Aristotle’s and\nPlato’s views, that had been taken up by al-Kindī and\nṮābit ibn Qurra, but seems alien to\nFārābī’s conception of the history of philosophy.\nFor this and other reasons, the Farabian authorship of this treatise,\ndespite the manuscript evidence, has been repeatedly questioned in\nrecent scholarship. \nThe view that metaphysics is the universal science of being\nqua being, and thus exceeds the boundaries of philosophical\ntheology by including it as one of its parts, functions in\nal-Fārābī to underscore the irreducibility of\nmetaphysics to Islamic religion: at the level of content, metaphysics\nranges over a thematic spectrum wider than the Muslim creed; on\nepistemic grounds, the demonstrative method of metaphysics (and of\nphilosophy in general) is superior not only to the rhetorical and\npoetical character of prophetic discourse, but also to the dialectical\nprocedures of Islamic theology (kalām). This helps to\nexplain why al-Fārābī does not indulge in the\nphilosophical explanation of the Qurʾān, and why in\nthe political works does he treat topics pertinent to religion from a\nstrictly philosophical point of view, with no concession to religious\nterminology or theological motives. \nThe Metaphysics held an undisputable importance for the\nschool of Christian Aristotelians that flourished in Baghdad during\nthe X–XI centuries, who took over from the Aristotelian scholars\nof Alexandria the project of providing a systematic commentary on\nAristotle’s works. Many members of this school—starting\nfrom its founder, Abū Bišr Mattā ibn Yūnus (d.\n940), through to its later leader, Abū Zakariyāʾ\nYaḥyā Ibn ʿAdī (d. 974), and to one of its last\nrepresentatives, ʿĪsā ibn Zurʿa (d.\n1008)—contributed decisively to the translation of the\nMetaphysics into Arabic. Moreover, some of these authors\nare credited with the translation into Arabic of parts of the main\nGreek commentaries on the Metaphysics (Alexander of\nAphrodisias and Themistius on book Lambda, by Abū Bišr\nMattā), or they were reported to be familiar with the Arabic\ntranslation of further Greek commentaries on Aristotle’s work,\nas well as with treatises on metaphysics by some of Aristotle’s\nimmediate disciples (for example, Yaḥyā Ibn ʿAdī\nwas said to be familiar with the commentary on book Beta by Syrianus\nand the original treatise on metaphysics by Theophrastus of Eresus).\nFinally, numerous literal commentaries on the Metaphysics,\nfollowing in the footsteps of Alexander of Aphrodisias’\nexegetical style, were produced within the school. Thus, later sources\ninform us that Abū Bišr Mattā commented on books\nAlpha Elatton, Βeta (III) and Theta (VIII) of the\nMetaphysics; he is also quoted in Avicenna’s exegesis\nof book Lambda (XII). Yaḥyā Ibn ʿAdī’s\ncommentary on book Alpha Elatton is extant. Abū l-Faraǧ ibn\nal-Ṭayyib’s (d. 1043) commentary on the\nMetaphysics, preserved in fragments in Hebrew translation, is\nfamous for its length and its extremely detailed character, an\nexegetical style decidedly resented by Avicenna. \nThe literal style of exegesis allowed Yaḥyā Ibn\nʿAdī to introduce religious concerns into his\nMetaphysics commentary. The broadly speaking\n“Platonic” theories of some of his treatises devoted to\nontological issues, like the postulation of divine forms within the\ndiscussion of the mode of existence of universals, can be seen as\nPlatonizing solutions to Aristotelian problems, rather than signs of\naffiliation to non-Aristotelian philosophical traditions. \nOutlines of metaphysics, of various lengths, can be found in\nAvicenna’s treatises on the classifications of the sciences, as\nwell as in the surveys of the different branches of philosophy\ninterspersed in many of his other works. These epistemological\nsketches are substantiated in his summae, a literary genre of\nwhich he can be considered the inventor. In all these\n“encyclopedias” of philosophy—addressed to different\naudiences and displaying various formats, methodologies and\nstyles—metaphysics constitutes, together with logic and natural\nphilosophy, a permanent and pivotal part of philosophy. In those\nwritten in Arabic, after the propaedeutic treatment of logic, the\nsequence of theoretical disciplines is given—along traditional\nlines—as natural philosophy, mathematics, and metaphysics, or\nsimply as natural philosophy and metaphysics, with mathematics\nfrequently omitted. By contrast, in the Persian summa, Philosophy\nfor ʿAlāʾ al-Dawla\n(Dānišnāmah-yi ʿAlāʾī),\nand possibly also in the incompletely extant Eastern\nPhilosophy (Al-Ḥikma al-mašriqiyya), the\norder is reversed and, as Avicenna himself avows, much more original:\nmetaphysics constitutes the beginning, rather than the end, of\ntheoretical philosophy. These two opposite arrangements are in fact\ncompatible and underscore complementary aspects of the primacy of\nmetaphysics within theoretical philosophy: metaphysics is last in the\norder of learning as the pinnacle of philosophical instruction, while\nit is first in the order of reality on account of the supreme rank of\nthe things it deals with. \nIn Avicenna’s literal commentaries on the philosophical\ncorpus, most of which are lost, metaphysics represents the\nsection about which we are best informed by either Avicenna himself or\nhis disciples (e.g., The Available and the Valid,\nAl-Ḥāṣil wa-l-maḥṣūl), or by\nthe surviving portions (e.g., Book of the Fair Judgment,\nKitāb al-Inṣāf). Judging from the extant\nfragments, conciseness and selectiveness appear to have been the\nstylistic and methodological hallmarks of Avicenna’s exegesis of\nthe Metaphysics. \nAvicenna’s original adaptation of the Metaphysics can\nbe best appreciated in the metaphysical sections of his\nsummae of philosophy, which combine the taxonomical and\nexegetical approaches to Aristotle’s work (see\n section 1),\n with the main intent of updating and upgrading Aristotle’s\nmetaphysical model. On the one hand, in so far as they are collections\nof the different branches of philosophy, and expound metaphysics\ntogether with logic, natural philosophy, and mathematics, these works\ngive metaphysics a precise position in the system of the philosophical\ndisciplines. On the other hand, they provide an explanation of\nAristotle’s text by incorporating it into Avicenna’s own\ndiscourse by means of a report which modifies the formulation of the\noriginal text and changes the arrangement of its parts. More\nimportantly, they adapt the scientific profile and the specific\ncontent of the Metaphysics to new epistemological\nrequirements, to the doctrinal progress of post-Aristotelian\nphilosophy, and to the Islamic setting with which metaphysics is now\ncalled to interact. Specifically, they adjust the tentative scientific\nconfiguration assigned to Metaphysics by Aristotle himself to\nhigher epistemological standards; they refine the doctrine of the\nMetaphysics and mold it with theories taken from other\nauthors and works within the Aristotelian tradition, or from the\nfruits of Avicenna’s own mind; and they make the final treatment\nof philosophical theology in metaphysics compliant with religious\nconcerns and the theological agenda of the Islamic milieu in which\nAvicenna’s summae are produced. \nAmong Avicenna’s summae, the most extensive,\ninfluential, and, by the author’s own admission, the most\ndependent upon Aristotelian sources is the Book of the\nCure/Healing (Kitāb al-Šifāʾ). The\n“traditional” character of the work, however, far from\npreventing originality, allows the reader to observe more keenly the\nauthor’s subtle and wide-ranging adaptation of the Aristotelian\nmodel and his free disposal of the received material. This applies to\nmetaphysics in an eminent way. The metaphysical section of the\nCure/Healing, The Science of Divine Things\n(Ilāhiyyāt), comes at the end of a massive work\nconsisting in a collection of twenty-two volumes, which is unique\namong Avicenna’s summae not only with regard to length\n(more than 5000 pages in the current printing of the Arabic text, one\nof the longest works ever written in the history of philosophy) but\nalso because it is the only summa that contains both a\nfull-fledged mathematics before metaphysics, and an extensive\ntreatment of practical philosophy as an appendix to metaphysics. In\nthis way, only in The Science of Divine Things, metaphysics\nfigures as a real cornerstone of the entire philosophical curriculum,\nboth with respect to what precedes (logic and the other two parts of\ntheoretical philosophy), and with respect to what follows (practical\nphilosophy). \nAs to the text of the Metaphysics, Avicenna uses several\nArabic translations of Aristotle’s work, and adopts various\ntechniques for quoting it: his way of referring to the\nMetaphysics is usually very selective in content and free in\nstyle, although in a few cases his quotations become continuous and\nresemble a real paraphrase. This latter case happens with\nMetaphysics α, 2, which Avicenna cites in its entirety,\nwith explicative expansions, in the eighth treatise, introducing into\nthe paraphrase frequent references to the Metaphysics\n(“First Teaching”) and its author (“First\nTeacher”), as well as an explicit mention of book Alpha Elatton\nitself, and defending the doctrines at stake by offering solutions to\na series of possible objections. Within the ninth treatise, the same\nspecial treatment is given, to a lesser degree, to Metaph.\nΛ, 6–10. \nThe liberty with which Avicenna reports the text of the\nMetaphysics is paramount to his effort of adapting it to a\nnew context. With respect to Aristoteles’ work, The Science\nof Divine Things exhibits three radical aspects of modification.\nAvicenna changes, first of all, the “form”, i.e., the\nscientific profile, of Aristotle’s work. Accordingly, he also\nmodifies its “content”, namely the disposition and\ndoctrinal purport of the individual treatises of the work. These two\nmodifications are concomitant with a third, more general, change,\nregarding the position and role of the science of metaphysics in the\nsystem of the sciences. The change regarding the “form”\naffects all the fundamental aspects of a science singled out by\nAristotle in the Posterior Analytics: the theme of\nmetaphysics, its structure, and its method. The content of the\nMetaphysics, on the other hand, is reworked by means of a\ndifferent arrangement of its parts, the integration of\nAristotle’s thought with subsequent metaphysical speculation,\nboth Greek and Arabic, the introduction of some original key\ndoctrines, and a treatment of the divine realm very attentive to the\nconcerns of Islamic religion and theology. The change regarding the\nsystemic function of metaphysics, finally, involves a precise view of\nits relationship with the other sciences as both foundational and\ncrowning discipline, thus overcoming Aristotle’s veto in the\nPosterior Analytics on the subalternation under a single\nscience of all other disciplines. Cumulatively, in these three ways\none observes on Avicenna’s part a thorough and radical revision\nof the authoritative text on metaphysics, which can be rightly\nregarded as a sort of second “edition” of the\nMetaphysics, or second “beginning” of the Western\nmetaphysical speculation. \nIn the context of the epistemological reshaping of the metaphysics,\nAvicenna shows first that the subject-matter of this science conforms\nto all the different characteristics that Aristotle assigns to it in\nthe Metaphysics. Thus, metaphysics is a study of the First\nCauses and God (cf. Metaph. Α, 1, 981b28–29;\nΑ, 2, 982b9–10), since the First Causes and God are its\n“goal”. But it is also a study of “the\nexistent” (cf. Metaph. Γ, 1, 1003a20–26),\nsince “the existent qua existent” is its\nsubject-matter. Finally, metaphysics is a study of immaterial and\nunmoved things (cf. Metaph. Ε, 1, 1026a13–23),\nsince both the First Causes and God, and “the existent\nqua existent” are realities of this kind. This\nharmonization of Aristotle’s different points of view is\nundertaken with the intent of conforming metaphysics to the\nepistemological canons of the Posterior Analytics, which\nposit the subject-matter as the fundamental element of every science.\nAvicenna is the first thinker in the history of philosophy to have\ndevoted a distinct and articulated treatment to the issue of the\nsubject-matter of metaphysics, whose later impact on Arabic and Latin\nphilosophy has been enormous, insofar as it settled the issue of how\nmetaphysics can be both an ontology and a philosophical theology. The\nother aspects of the scientific reform of metaphysics introduced by\nAvicenna are also the result of applying the epistemological\nrequirements of the Posterior Analytics to this discipline.\nIn this way, Avicenna bestows on metaphysics an articulated and\ncoherent structure, based on the main elements that the Posterior\nAnalytics spell out as fundamental to every science: the parts,\nproperties, and principles of its subject-matter, and a method that\nis, as much as possible, demonstrative, in keeping with the\nPosterior Analytics’ claim that demonstration is the\nmost perfect type of proof. \nAs to the recasting of the content of the Metaphysics in\nThe Science of Divine Things, Avicenna quotes all the\nfourteen books into which the Metaphysics is traditionally\ndivided (apart, perhaps, from book Κ), but according to an order\nthat is strikingly different from that of Aristotle’s work. In\nThe Science of Divine Things, however, Avicenna not only\nmodifies the content of the Metaphysics; he also integrates\nthemes taken from other sources, either from other Aristotelian\nwritings; or from texts belonging to the Greek and Arabic Peripatetic\ntradition, in which Aristotle’s Metaphysics was\ncommented, elaborated, and expanded; or from his own cultural context.\nIn this last respect, the philosophical theology of The Science of\nDivine Things includes a series of themes familiar to the Muslim\naudience of the work (the existence of God, His attributes,\nprovidence, theodicy, man’s destiny in the afterlife, prophecy\netc.), which are treated on a strictly philosophical basis, but with\noccasional recourse to examples, terminology, and scriptural\nquotations of clear Islamic provenance, used to confirm the rational\nconclusions reached. This, together with the theological views debated\nthroughout the work, indicates Avicenna’s intention to show that\nthe philosophical world-view expressed in metaphysics is not contrary\nor alien to the Islamic one, and that it can provide rational access\nto some of the tenets of the Muslim creed. The Science of Divine\nThings, however, is not the mere sum of its many sources. Within\nthe framework of metaphysics, Avicenna introduces original doctrines,\nsome of which are narrower in scope and occur in localized parts of\nthe work, while others are recurrent and serve to connect and unify\nits various themes. Most notorious among this latter category\nare—besides the already mentioned account of the subject-matter\nof metaphysics—the distinction between essence and existence in\ncreated beings, which is the theoretical leitmotif of the work, and\nthe metaphysical proof of God’s existence, grounded in\nAvicenna’s view of the subject-matter of metaphysics and of\ncausation, and placed at the beginning of the section on philosophical\ntheology (chapters 1–3 of treatise VIII). The distinction\nbetween essence and existence is the most famous among\nAvicenna’s own doctrines and underlies many themes of\nAvicenna’s metaphysics: it justifies, for instance, the\ndifference between the primary concepts “thing” (i.e.,\n“that which has an essence”) and “existent” at\nthe beginning of the work; it grounds the theory of universals\n(universality is an attribute that belongs to an essence not as such,\nbut when this latter exists in the human mind, abstracted from the\nextra-mental things in which it is instantiated); and it leads to the\nfundamental characterization of God as the only being that has no\nessence apart from existence, or whose essence is totally identical to\nits existence. Equally important in The Science of Divine\nThings is the proof of God’s existence, which is announced\nat the beginning of the work (I.6) and completed towards its end\n(VIII.1–3). It involves a precise view of the relationship\nbetween metaphysics and natural philosophy, being properly\nmetaphysical and independent from the conclusions reached in physics;\nit turns out to be original with regard to the other metaphysical\nwritings of Avicenna, because it is based not only on a precise\ndoctrine of the Metaphysics (the finiteness of causal chains\nin Metaph. α, 2), but also on the text itself of this\nchapter of Aristotle’s work, as we have seen. \nAs to the role of metaphysics among the sciences, this discipline for\nAvicenna holds a position of eminence with respect to all other\nbranches of philosophy. The series of disciplines constituting the\nŠifāʾ amounts to a concrete classification of the\nsciences: in it, metaphysics functions as the “queen of the\nsciences” that ascertains the principles taken for granted by\nall the other sciences, and interconnects and orders hierarchically\nthe system. Metaphysics is foundational insofar as it is the universal\nscience of the existent qua existent (ontology). The\nscientific principles assessed by metaphysics are, on the one hand,\nthe logical laws common to all the sciences (the axioms), and the\nuniversal concepts that every science uses without examining them (the\nprimary concepts like “existent”, “thing”,\n“necessary”, “one”). On the other hand,\nmetaphysics clarifies the principles that are proper to each of the\nparticular sciences, i.e., their specific assumptions or hypotheses.\nThus, metaphysics proves the very existence and the mode of existence\nof the subject-matters of the other sciences (for example, the\nexistence of universals and categories in logic, of matter and form in\nnatural philosophy, and of discrete and continuous quantity in\nmathematics). \nIn Avicenna, all the previous trends of the Arabic tradition of the\nMetaphysics converge and find their synthesis. This is\nparticularly manifest in the philosophical theology that invariably\nconcludes his accounts of metaphysics in the summae and that\nfinds its most lucid expression in The Science of Divine\nThings. In this section, Avicenna reiterates the connection\nbetween Metaph. α, 2 and Λ, 6–10 that is\ntypical of al-Kindī’s selective way of approaching the\nMetaphysics, while also incorporating procedures of\nexplanation ad litteram and by way of questions (per\nmodum quaestionis) of Metaph. α, 2 that are\nreminiscent of the Baghdad Aristotelians’ exegetical method, and\ndiscussing a sequence of themes that mirrors the structure of the\ntheological philosophy of al-Fārābī’s political\ntreatises. The Aristotelian core of this section is then expanded by\nmeans of accretions taken from Alexander of Aphrodisias’ and\nThemistius’ works on metaphysics (the Aristotelian commentators\nmentioned by al-Fārābī and translated into Arabic by\nthe Baghdad Aristotelians), and from the pseudo-Aristotelian,\nNeoplatonic works that were commonly appended to the\nMetaphysics in Arabic philosophy, i.e., the Plotinian\nTheologia Aristotelis and the Proclean Liber de\nCausis, produced within al-Kindī’s circle. As a\nresult, Avicenna’s metaphysics harmonizes al-Kindī’s\nemphasis on the theological component of the Metaphysics with\nal-Fārābī’s vindication of the foundational role\nof ontology; by the same token, Avicenna reconciles\nal-Fārābī’s view of metaphysics as a science\nmodeled on the epistemology of the Posterior Analytics with\nthe Baghdad Aristotelians’ project of an integral explanation of\nAristotle’s text. In this way, the congruence of metaphysics\nwith Islamic theology is not realized in a “Kindian” way,\ni.e., by limiting the scope of this discipline to a part of the\nMetaphysics, but depends, in a more “Farabian”\nvein, upon the entire work of Aristotle once its inner structure has\nbeen properly underscored. Likewise, the task of conforming\nmetaphysics to the methodological standards of the Posterior\nAnalytics is accomplished at the same time as the goal of\nelucidating the textual obscurities and the interpretative problems of\nthe Metaphysics. \nThe other metaphysical summae by Avicenna single out and\nemphasize particular aspects of the overarching architecture of\nmetaphysics displayed in The Science of Divine Things. Thus,\nThe Book of Pointers and Reminders (Kitāb\nal-Išārāt wa-l-Tanbīhāt) underscores\nthe importance of philosophical theology within metaphysics by\nexpanding it with respect to a much thinner ontology; the Persian\nThe Book of Science for ʿAlāʾ-al-Dawla\n(Dānešnāme-ye ʿAlāʾī)\nplaces metaphysics as first theoretical discipline (before natural\nphilosophy and mathematics), after the preliminary logic, in order to\nsignal its priority in the system of the sciences; the lost\nmetaphysics of The Easterners\n(Al-Mašriqiyyūn) or The Eastern\nPhilosophy (Al-Ḥikma al-mašriqiyya) might\nhave assigned a clear-cut epistemological role to the divide between\nontology and philosophical theology within metaphysics by splitting\nmetaphysics into two distinct sciences corresponding to these two\nparts. The metaphysics of The Book of Salvation\n(Kitāb al-Naǧāt), finally, though structurally\nsimilar to The Science of Divine Things, differs from it in\nspecific points and formulations, in so far as it incorporates\ndoctrines from Avicenna’s previous metaphysical works. \nBesides the overall treatment of metaphysics in the summae,\nAvicenna investigates particular metaphysical areas in specific\ntreatises, such as the Book of Provenance and Destination\n(Kitāb al-Mabdaʾ wa-l-maʿād), which\nfocuses, within metaphysics, on philosophical theology, or the\nEpistle of Immolation about Destination (Al-Risāla\nal-aḍḥawiyya fī amr al-maʿād), which\nconcentrates on a specific topic of philosophical theology, or in\nallegorical writings, such as the Ḥayy Ibn\nYaqẓān or the Epistle of the Bird\n(Risālat al-Ṭayr). Various issues pertaining to\nmetaphysics are extensively debated in works that contain his\nreflections on key philosophical themes, such as the Notes\n(Taʿlīqāt), or that derive from the teaching\nactivity and the dialectical practices performed within his circle,\ni.e., the Discussions\n(Mubāḥaṯāt). Related to metaphysics are\nthe specific essays ascribed to Avicenna and devoted to the\nphilosophical and allegorical interpretation of some Qur’anic\nverses, whose authenticity however remains to be assessed. \nThe pivotal position of Avicenna in the history of Islamic philosophy\nemerges in all clarity if we consider that the three approaches to\nAristotle’s Metaphysics considered here\n(classification, commentary, adaptation), as well as the main schools\nof thought of the formative period (the Kindian, on the one hand, and\nthe Farabian-Baghdadian, on the other), ended or began to wither with\nthe rise of Avicenna’s metaphysics. Although the text of\nAristotle’s Metaphysics continued to circulate in\nArabic after the eleventh century, the metaphysical works of Avicenna\ngradually superseded the Metaphysics as the text to be\ncopied, commented upon, and evaluated (either favorably or\ncritically), until Avicennism replaced Aristotelianism by\nincorporating it. Likewise, in the post-Avicennian tradition, issues\nregarding Avicenna’s distinction between essence and existence,\nand the primacy of the former over the latter, are widely debated, and\nthe prerogatives of an Avicennian philosophical theology over Islamic\ndialectical theology, or kalām, to be the discipline\nmore properly entitled to speak about God, hold pivotal\nimportance. \nThe reception of Avicenna’s metaphysics in subsequent Arabic\nthought is multifaceted, and detailed work in this immense area has\nonly begun in recent decades. Previous scholarship has established the\nfollowing landmarks: \nFirst, a clear distinction between the direct vs. the indirect\ninfluence of Avicenna’s metaphysics, i.e., between those who\nactually consulted his works, and those whose knowledge depended on\nearlier readers of Avicenna. A case of the latter are the two very\ninfluential text-books of Coranic schools (madrasas), Aṯīr\nal-Dīn al-Abharī’s (d. 660H/1262 or 663H/1265),\nHidāyat al-ḥikma, and Naǧm al-Dīn\nal-Kātibī al-Qazwīnī (d. 1276),\nḤikmat al-ʿayn, whose metaphysical sections are\nlargely dependent on Avicenna. \nSecond, three main attitudes towards Avicenna’s metaphysics in\npost-Avicennian Arabic philosophy can tentatively be outlined:\nacceptance; revision; and rejection of Avicenna’s standpoint. A\ndecidedly pro-Avicennian camp is represented by a network of scholars\nencompassing at least three generations of school members who\nexplicitly connected themselves with Avicenna’s teaching.\nSignificantly, some of these direct disciples of Avicenna, like\nAbū l-ʿAbbās Faḍl Ibn Muḥammad\nal-Lawkarī (V-VI/XI-XII c.), are the models to which later heirs\nof Avicenna’s metaphysics ideally refer (see, for instance,\nĠiyāṯ al-Dīn Manṣūr ibn Muḥammad\nḤusaynī Daštakī Šīrāzī,\nd. 948H/1542). \nOn the opposite side, a “conservative” reaction to\nAvicenna’s metaphysics (and to Avicenna’s philosophy in\ngeneral) was represented by the efforts of reinstating the\npre-Avicennian status of this discipline. This goal was pursued in\nvarious ways. Some, like Šihābaddīn\nal-Suhrawardī (d. 1191) and the fabricators of Arabic\nPseudo-Platonica in the twelfth century, took Pythagoras’ and\nPlato’s thought as true philosophy, thus supplanting the\nAristotelian tradition to which Avicenna belonged. Others, like Ibn\nRushd/Averroes (d. 1198), whose three commentaries on the\nMetaphysics contain recurrent criticisms of Avicenna,\nredirected attention to the Aristotelian Metaphysics itself,\nwith the aim of restoring the original purport of Aristotle’s\nfoundational text against Avicenna’s innovations. Still others,\nsuch as ʿAbd al-Laṭīf al-Baġdādī (d.\n1231), conceived metaphysics as a mere juxtaposition of the Kindian\nand Farabian perspectives on metaphysics, where Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics inaugurates a curriculum of works that includes\nthe Liber de causis and the Theologia Aristotelis,\nas in al-Kindī, but also has an ontological dimension, as in\nal-Fārābī, so that the Avicennian synthesis is reduced\nto its constituents. In addition to these anachronistic attempts that\nsurface both in the East and in the West of the Muslim world and are\nadvanced by philosophers in the strict sense, there were also the\nattacks launched against philosophy in general, and metaphysics in\nparticular, by Muslim theologians, most famously by Abū\nḤāmid al-Ġazālī (d. 1111) in The\nIncoherence of the Philosophers (Tahāfut\nal-Falāsifa). Significantly, however, all the critics of\nAvicenna, regardless whether philosophers or theologians, are also\nindebted to his thought, and in their eyes Avicenna’s\nmetaphysics represents metaphysics tout court. \nA further intermediate line of influence, which is the one that\nultimately prevails, is the fruitful and positive\n“contamination” of Avicenna’s metaphysics with\nsystems of thought originally foreign to it. This trend towards\ncombining approaches and developing in new directions takes place, for\nexample, with regard to the theory of illumination (Muḥammad Ibn\nMaḥmūd al-Šahrazūrī, 2nd half\nof the VII/XIIIc.), or to sufism (Muḥyīʾ al-Dīn\nIbn ʿArabī, d. 1240; Ibn Sabʿīn of Murcia, c.\n1217–1270; Ṣadr al-Dīn al Qūnawī,\n1207–1274). But the most noteworthy aspect of this\ntendency—which possibly starts in the cultural environment where\nal-Ġazālī was formed—is the adoption of\nAvicenna’s metaphysics by Muslim theologians or\nmutakallimūn. In general, the tendency to integrate\nAvicenna’s metaphysics into new doctrinal settings represents\nthe most interesting area of the reception of Avicenna’s\nthought, since it requires a thorough revision of Avicenna’s\noriginal stance to adapt it to an illuminationist, mystical, or\ntheological context. Together with the trends towards acceptance or\nrejection, this tendency to revise stretches over a period which is\nmuch longer than the pre-Avicennian phase of falsafa. \nThird, in a diachronic perspective, within the vast scenario of the\nreception of Avicenna’s philosophy, after the first main period\nof impact already singled out in scholarship (from Avicenna’s\ndeath until the middle of the VIII/XIV c.), further later significant\nphases of influence in different areas of the Islamic world (Persia,\nIndia, Ottoman empire) are emerging. Of course, this temporal\nprogression and this geographical expansion also involve\nmetaphysics. \nA key factor in the evaluation of the later impact of\nAvicenna’s metaphysics is the assessment of those of his works\nwhich mainly influenced later reflections on metaphysics, their ways\nof transmission, and their audience, since each of them, as we have\nseen, conveys a particular version and format of metaphysics. Among\nthem, the metaphysical section of the Book of Pointers and\nReminders has been singled out in scholarship because of the\nproliferation of independent commentaries on this work from the late\nXII until the early XVIII century by leading figures of Arabic-Islamic\nphilosophy like Faḫr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 1209) and\nNaṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (d. 1274).\nScholars attribute the success of Avicenna’s Pointers and\nReminders to doctrinal, stylistic, and chronological factors.\nDoctrinally, Avicenna’s use of the essence-existence distinction\nto support the distinction between what is intrinsically necessary in\nsomething (like its essence) and what is extrinsically necessary in it\n(like its existence) was particularly obvious in the Pointers and\nReminders. Stylistically, the work’s abbreviated and\nallusive style invites elaboration and commentary. Chronologically,\nthis was Avicenna’s final comprehensive work and therefore could\nbe presented as the definitive expression of his views. For these\nreasons, the Pointers and Reminders are currently considered\nto be the work of Avicenna privileged by subsequent Muslim\nphilosophers (including the mutakallimūn). \nThe Science of Divine Things also played an important role in\nspreading Avicenna’s metaphysics among later advocates of this\ndiscipline. This is evident from its extensive manuscript tradition,\nthe vast exegetical activity devoted to The Cure/Healing, and\nthe frequent and widespread quotations of The Science of Divine\nThings among post-Avicennian authors. Transmitted by a huge\nnumber of manuscripts (more numerous and older than the ones of the\nPointers and Reminders currently known), The Science of\nDivine Thing and the other parts of the Cure/Healing\nwere copied uninterruptedly for nine centuries, from the end of V/XI\ncentury, a few decades after Avicenna’s death, until the XIV/XX\ncentury. Its exegetical tradition is first attested in the form of\nmarginalia, which never circulated independently from manuscripts\nbefore the X/XVI c. The earliest extant “commentaries” on\nthe text are in fact collections of marginal glosses of this kind,\nwhich gained independent circulation in self-standing book format at\nthe time of a new-born interest in The Cure/Healing, and of\nan apparent loss of interest in the Pointers and Reminders,\nwhose commentatorial activity starts decreasing then: the\ntaʿlīqāt of Ġiyāṯ al-Dīn\nDaštakī Šīrāzī and of\nṢadrā al-Dīn (Mullā Ṣadrā)\nal-Šīrāzī (d. 1640) are noteworthy instances of\nthis trend. Later lemmatic commentaries, like the one by\nMuḥammad Mahdī ibn Abī Ḏarr al-Narāqī\n(d. 1794/5), cover only parts of The Science of Divine\nThings, since the work in its entirety—455 pages in the\ncurrent printing—was too huge to be commented upon in this way,\nand no one has ever commented integrally on even one of the twenty-two\nbooks of The Cure/Healing, let alone the summa in\nits entirety. Finally, The Science of Divine Things is\nabundantly quoted by a wide array of scholars and writings, and even\nthe commentators on the Pointers and Reminders cite\nit—as they do with The Cure/Healing in general—as\nthe reference work to be consulted in case of theoretical\nuncertainties or for doctrinal integrations and developments. \nIn this context, the metaphysical sections of The Book of Science\nfor ʿAlāʾ-al-Dawla and of The Book of\nSalvation should also be taken into account. The former work\nobtained wide resonance since it was taken as model and incorporated\nby al-Ġazālī in his exposition of philosophy (The\nAims/Doctrines of the philosophers, Maqāṣid\nal-Falāsifa), a conduit for Avicenna’s metaphysics in\nthe West as well. The latter work was copied in manuscripts at a very\nancient stage, and it was commented upon by important scholars like\nẒāhir al-Din Ibn Funduq al-Bayhaqī (d. 1169–1170) and\nFaḫr al-Dīn al-Isfarāʾinī\nal-Nīsābūrī (fl. VI/XII c.). \nAt the present stage of research, we can tentatively conclude that no\nsingle work of Avicenna conveyed his metaphysical thought to later\ncenturies, although it is premature to assess how, when, and where\nthese different writings interacted and competed in transmitting\nAvicenna’s view of metaphysics, and which of them enjoyed the\nstatus of Avicenna’s most influential metaphysical work. Among\nthem, the manuscript diffusion, the commentatorial activity, and the\nconsideration and esteem of The Science of Divine Things\ndeserve special attention, since they cross the centuries and\nrepresent an uninterrupted trail of post-Avicennian philosophy, from\nAvicenna’s first disciples until today. Such a continuity looks\nunattested in the case of the other metaphysical works by Avicenna. In\nthe continuum represented by the circulation of The Science of\nDivine Things, one may discern a peak: this is the Safavid era in\nIran (XVI-XVIII c.), which—if we decide to call\n“golden” the period 1100–1350—can be labelled\nthe “platinum” age of the reception of Avicenna’s\nmetaphysics through The Science of Divine Things. But this\npeak has firm roots in previous centuries, especially in the\nkey-figure of Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī and\nhis school, and extends both backwards and forwards, according to a\ncomprehensive view of post-Avicennian falsafa. \nThe study of Arabic metaphysics can be approached from a variety of\ninterconnected perspectives. On the one hand, a group of historical\nissues emerges, such as the ways according to which the\nMetaphysics was transmitted into Arabic and integrated in the\nculture of its new environment, the synergy of its transmission with\nthe Arabic reception of other fundamental works of Aristotle (above\nall the Posterior Analytics, but also the\nCategories), and the continuation in Arabic philosophy of the\nmain Greek paradigms of interpretation of the Aristotelian\ncorpus, such as the Athenian background of\nal-Kindī’s philosophy vs. the Alexandrian heritage of the\nAristotelians of Baghdad, or the purer Peripatetism of\nal-Fārābī vs. the Platonizing Aristotelianism of\nYaḥyā Ibn ʿAdī and his followers. On the other\nhand, the epistemological reflection on metaphysics as a science\nundertaken by Arabic philosophers, in the effort to transform\nAristotle’s still imperfect discipline into a full-fledged and\nrigorous scientific discourse, discloses a theoretical area of\ninvestigation that produces a progressive switch of attention from the\nMetaphysics (with capital “M”) to metaphysics\n(with lower-case “m”). Outside the narrower scope of\nphilosophy and its history, it is interesting to note how the\nintroduction of a foreign pagan discipline, like metaphysics, into a\nmonotheistic social context, like the Islamic one, determines either\nthe accordance or the antagonism between philosophical theology and\nrevealed theology, or, in other words, between the quintessence of\nfalsafa, on the one hand, and the speculation of\nkalām, on the other. The study of the ways in which this\nconfrontation took place in the Islamic culture of the Middle Ages may\nshed light on the contemporary debate on the relationship between\nreason and faith and contribute to the promotion of dialogue among\ndifferent cultures.","contact.mail":"a.bertolacci@sns.it","contact.domain":"sns.it"}]
