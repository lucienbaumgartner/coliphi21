One is to focus on how the main topics of logic evolved and\nwere shaped within Peirce's framework.  This ‘bottom-up’\napproach not only provides us with genuine insight into Peirce's\nlogic, but also contributes to another, even greater body of\nresearch—Peirce's philosophy.  However, the bottom-up method\nfaces a serious obstacle because the enormous nexus of Peircean ideas\nis difficult to unravel and separate.\n\nThe other approach is to highlight Peirce's\nachievements in logic and to locate Peirce's contributions\nwithin the context of modern logic.  This ‘top-down’ approach\nhas merit both in its defined scope and in its appeal to those who are\ninterested in the development of logic in general.  On the other hand,\nthe top-down approach carries with it the risk of isolating Peirce's\nlogic from his greater philosophy.\n\nThe entry aims to mix these two methods so that we may present\nPeirce's logic both for Peirce scholars and for those interested in\nthe development of modern logic. Without getting lost in Peirce's\nambitious blueprint for philosophy, we will connect his main views in logic\nwithin his own philosophy so that a coherent picture of Peirce's logic\nmay emerge.  We single out the common theme of Peirce's various\ncontributions to modern logic, namely, to extend logic, as\ncharacterized by the following three different dimensions:\n\nextension of the scope of formalism: from propositional to\npredicate logic (discussed in Section 2),\n\nextension of kinds of systems: from symbolic to diagrammatic\nsystems (discussed in Section 3), and\n\nextension of semantic values: from two-valued to three-valued\nlogic (discussed in the supplement\n Peirce's Three-Valued Logic).\n\n\nThough these three contributions of Peirce's logic have been discussed\nin the literature (see generally Houser et al. 1997), the main goal of the\npresent entry is to provide the reader with a wide perspective by\noutlining themes which run through his three ambitious enterprises.\nBy carefully examining how Peirce proposed each of the three historical\nachievements, we find that Peirce was determined to carry\nout an important mission—to extend the horizon of logic.\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce was a philosopher, but it is not easy to\nclassify him in philosophy because of the breadth of his work.  Logic\nwas one of the main topics on which Peirce wrote.  If one focuses on\nlogic, however, it becomes apparent that Peirce's concept of logic and\nhis work on logic were much broader than his predecessors', his\ncontemporaries', and ours.  Peirce located logic in his large\narchitectonic framework of philosophy, which is why some philosophers\nstrongly believe that Peirce's logic cannot be properly understood\nwithout understanding his pragmatism and his semiotics, to mention but\ntwo of his other contributions.  Even within the traditional\nboundaries of logic, Peirce made too many contributions to outline in\na single article. Acknowledging the nature of this next-to-impossible task, we focus\non Peirce's revolutionary achievements as follows: extending the\nhorizon of logic in two dimensions, one from monadic properties to\nrelations and the other from symbolic to diagrammatic systems. While\nthe former contribution has positioned Peirce as a founder of modern\nlogic along with Frege, it took much longer for Peirce's latter\nachievement to receive proper attention from logicians. The main goal\nof this entry is not only to present Peirce's accomplishments in\nextending both logic and logical systems, but also to explore the\nrelation between these two novel developments. In the next section, we locate the root of Peirce's introduction of\nquantifiers and bound variables. Starting with his 1870 paper\n“Description of a Notation for the Logic of Relatives, Resulting\nfrom an Amplification of the Conceptions of Boole's Calculus”\n(DNLR), we follow the steps Peirce took until he presented the final\nform of his first-order logic in his 1885 paper “On the Algebra\nof Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notations.” Our\nfocus is on the main motivation behind Peirce's search for a new logic\nrather than on the details of the final product that could represent\nrelations.  Interestingly enough, we find that the same\ngoal—when viewed from a slightly different angle—is also a\ndriving force behind Peirce's new diagrammatic system, Existential\nGraphs (‘EG’ henceforth), that is, how to represent\nrelational states of affairs in a better way. This is the topic of\nthe third section. Again, it is important to\nremember that Peirce's Existential Graphs are not just an expansion of\nlogical languages but also underline Peirce's new approach to logic\nand formalization. \n\nFinally, there is a brief discussion of Peirce's notes on developing\nsemantics for three-valued logic in the supplement:\n  Peirce's Three-Valued Logic.\n Independently of one another, Peirce and Frege introduced quantifiers\nand bound variables in a large leap from the traditional\nAristotelian logic to modern logic. What is the essence of the leap\nmade by Peirce and Frege?  Is it just a matter of introducing new\nnotation, i.e., quantifiers and variables, so that we may more easily\nformalize our reasoning?  Nobody could deny the power of formalization\nwhich has led early 20th century mathematicians to surprising\nachievements and\n results.[1] If so, modern logic would simply be Aristotelian logic plus\nquantifiers/variables. This would equate one of Peirce's main\ncontributions to logic to the simple increase of the scope of\nformalization. Thus, those who believe that increasing the scope of\nformalization is equivalent to increasing the scope of logic would\nagree with this evaluation. While acknowledging the enormous impact of the adoption of\nquantifiers and bound variables on the world of logic and mathematics,\nwe will explore Peirce's insight behind the new formalism. In\nthis section, we will show how Peirce's conviction about the novelty\nof the logic of relatives led him to the invention of\nquantifiers/variables. Hence, quantification theory, according to\nPeirce, is not a matter of an extension of formal vocabulary, but an\nexpansion into territory that is qualitatively different from what\nAristotelian logic covers. Peirce's 1885 paper “On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution\nto the Philosophy of Notations” has been considered to be the\nplace where Peirce's quantification theory was fully presented.  This\nis why we hear that there is a six year interval between\nFrege's Begriffsschrift (1879) and Peirce's quantification\ntheory.  Since Peirce was not aware of Frege's work on the topic, it\nis correct give credit to both logicians for their work on the\nfoundations of modern logic.  Nonetheless, there are two main reasons\nwhy Frege's contribution to the foundations of modern logic is\ndistinctive: (i) Frege's Begriffsschrift was published before\nPeirce's “On the Algebra of Logic,” and (ii) Frege\npresented a logical system equipped with axioms and rules. Though\nthe matter is controversial, we do not plan to pursue it in this\nentry. But the story has some twists.  One is that Peirce's 1870 paper\nexhibits his struggle for the essential feature of modern\nlogic—the algebra of relations and quantified phrases, as we\nwill see in section 2.1.  The other interesting\nfact is that Peirce's work and notations were much better known to\ncontemporary logicians, and we had to wait for Russell to reintroduce\nFrege's first ‘discovery’ of quantifiers (Putnam 1982).\nFor example, Ernst Schröder's Vorlesungen über die\nAlgebra der Logik (1895) adopted Peirce's notation.  Hence,\nstrictly speaking, the Frege-first view seems to be a more recent\nphenomenon than Peirce's/Frege's era. Some Peirce scholars have also claimed that Peirce's invention of\nquantifiers is a product of Peirce's own philosophy of logic, which is\ndifferent from\n Frege's.[2]\nHintikka's (1997) proposal to explain a main difference between\nFrege's and Peirce's contribution to modern logic is quite intriguing.\nBorrowing van Heijenoort's distinction between Boole's logic as a\ncalculus and Frege's universality of logic, Hintikka locates Peirce in\nBoole's camp, calling it the model-theoretic tradition.  Unlike\nFrege's view of the universe, the model-theoretic tradition allows us\nto reinterpret a language and thus assign different universes to\nquantifiers. Acording to Hintikka, Peirce's development of modal logic\nis a good piece of evidence to show how fruitful Peirce's way of\nunderstanding quantifiers could be (Hintikka 1997).  At the same time,\nHintikka suggests that the recent Frege-first view is symptomatic of a\nlarger prejudice against the model-theoretic tradition and a\nbias towards the\nuniversalist tradition of logic.  Some have speculated that the\nsomewhat unique and unfortunate circumstances surrounding Peirce's\nlife might be related to his reputational lag. Perice had no regular\nacademic job and no luck with the publication of the major portion of\nhis work on logic; he was unpopular among mainstream academics, and a\ncertain obscurity was found in his writings. It is not a goal of the present entry to settle this debate. The\npoint is not to determine who deserves the credit as the founder of\nmodern logic, but rather to appreciate the novelty of the contribution\nthat each logician made to overall development of modern logic.  In\nwhat follows, we focus on Peirce's own developments and aim to show\nthat Peirce's insight about special features of relations (as opposed\nto non-relations, i.e., properties) is the main driving force behind\nhis inventions of both his quantification theory and his graphical\nsystems.  Hence, we claim that Peirce's invention of\nquantifiers/variables is not just an introduction of new notation, but\na reflection of Peirce's deep insight into a new logic to come.\nFirst, we will examine how Peirce's work on relations transformed into\nquantification theory. Peirce's 1870 paper “Description of a Notation for the Logic\nof Relatives, Resulting from an Amplification of the Conceptions of\nBoole's Calculus” (DNLR) is the first place where Peirce\npresented the logic of relations in a full length, and his 1885 paper\n“On the Algebra of Logic: A contribution to the Philosophy of\nNotations” is where his quantification theory was presented\nin a comprehensive together with axiomlike\n “icons”.[3] As the title suggests,  DNLR extends the territory of logic from non-relations to\nrelations while remaining faithful to Boole's algebraic\nnotation.[4]\n First, it is well-known\nthat a problem with Boole's existential propositions (as opposed to\nuniversal propositions) motivated Peirce and others to go beyond\nBoole's logic.[5]\n  It is\nsomewhat instructive to compare the following three notations for\nAristotelian\n statements:[6] \nIt is clear that all three logicians had quantification (i.e.,\n“all” and “some”) in mind, but it is far from\nclear whether Boole's problematic representation of existential\nstatements caused Peirce to invent or move on to a notation for\nquantifiers and variables in something like a first-order logic. In\nlight of Mitchell's more elaborate representation for two-dimensional\npropositions (Mitchell 1883: 87), some who believe that this is the\ncase have argued that Mitchell's use of quantifiers was the direct\nsource for Peirce's introduction of quantifiers and bound variables\n(Geraldine Brady 1997).  There is a strong possibility that Mitchell\ninfluenced Peirce's notation for quantifiers and bound variables\n(which appear in his 1885 paper).  But, we need to note that\nMitchell's subscript does not function as a bound variable.  More\nimportantly, this view might overlook one crucial aspect of Peirce's\nquantification logic, namely his effort to mathematize and/or\nformalize relations.  Hence, we cannot talk about Peirce's\nquantification logic without mentioning De Morgan's influence, in\nparticular with regards to his writing on relations in logic. The following picture emerges: Inspired by Boole's algebra of\nlogic, but at the same time taking his father's (Professor Benjamin\nPeirce) negative view of logic\n seriously,[7]\nPeirce explored a way to extend Boole's spirit to a larger domain of\nour reasoning.  The title of the 1870 paper spells out the project:\n“Description of a notation for the logic of relatives, resulting\nfrom an amplification of the conceptions of Boole's calculus of\nlogic.” The paper started with mentioning De Morgan's work on\n  relations (1864)\n but after several examples concluded that\n“[t]his system [De Morgan's system] still leaves something to be\ndesired.” By praising Boole's work in the next sentence, Peirce\nhinted at his plan to bring in the algebra of logic to improve the\nshortcomings of De Morgan's system.  On the other hand, Boole's\nalgebra of logic is “restricted to that simplest and least\nuseful part of the subject, the logic of absolute\nterms” (DNLR CP:3.45). Hence, Peirce's project is \n \nto\ninquire whether it [Boole's algebra of logic] cannot be extended over\nthe whole realm of formal logic … [and] to show that an affirmative\nanswer can be given to this question. (DNLR CP:3.45)\n \n What\ndoes he mean by ‘the whole realm of formal logic’?  Peirce answers:\n“Deductive logic can really not be understood without the study\nof the logic of relatives” (1902 CP:3.641). Correctly believing that traditional Aristotelian logic was too\nlimited to be used for comprehensive deductive reasoning, Peirce\nsought to extend the algebra of logic beyond monadic predicates (which\ncorrespond to Boole's classes) so that our reasoning involving\nrelations could be formalized in a system. In that sense, Peirce's\npioneering work on modern logic started in the 1870 paper. This is not\nto raise the Frege-first or Peirce-first debate again, but rather to\ndraw our\nattention to the goal of Peirce's project—that is, to broaden the\nscope of formalization in logic. Peirce's main contribution to modern\nlogic does not simply lie in the\nintroduction of new vocabulary for quantifiers and bound variables, but\nalso in his\nsharp appreciation of the distinction between properties and\nrelations. Peirce's early insight into the importance\nof reasoning involving relations is a key element in understanding the\ndifference between Peirce's and Frege's developments of first-order\nlogic.[8]\nFurthermore, in the next section we will show how Peirce's obsession\nwith the logic of relations led him to the invention of Existential\nGraphs. Peirce intuited a fundamental difference between the logic of\nnon-relatives versus the logic of\nrelations.[9]\nPeirce makes an insightful remark about the distinct logical nature for\nrelations when negation is combined: \n \n[W]hile in non-relative\nlogic negation only divides the universe into two parts, in relative\nlogic the same operation divides the universe into\n2n parts, where n is the number of objects in\nthe system which the relative supposes. (1880 CP:3.221) \n \nSuppose P is a monadic predicate (which is\nnon-relative).  Then, given an object in the universe, we know it is\neither P or not-P.  However, in the case of\nrelations, negation complicates the division of the universe.  With a\nbinary relation on a given pair of\nobjects,[10]\nthere are four possible combinations, depending on whether it is\n“yes” or “no” to first and second elements of\nthe pair.  In the same manner, a ternary relation has eight ways\nto carve up the given universe.  It seems obvious that the\ncomplication that relations bring in our reasoning pushed Peirce to\ndevelop new notational systems.  In other words, Peirce's invention of\nquantifiers and bound variables was an outcome of his struggle to\nexpand the scope of formalization to cover relations.  Merrill's\nparagraph is a nice summary for the matter: \nIt is widely recognized that Peirce's two most important contributions\nto logic were the logic of relations and the theory of quantification.\nIt is also clear that these two aspects of his logic are closely\nconnected, since Peirce's search for an adequate logic of relations\nstimulated his development of quantification theory.  The\nquantification complexities of many relational statements cried out\nfor quantifiers.  (Merrill 1997: 158) Hence, Peirce and Frege approached the project of modern logic from\ndifferent directions: Peirce struggled with the formalization of\nreasoning involving relations and produced the representation of\nquantifiers/variables, while Frege aimed to present a system\ncomprehensive enough to represent arithmetic.  Peirce's battle for a\nnew system of logic between 1870 and 1885 could remind us that\npropositional logic is as powerful as monadic predicate logic, and\nthat quantifiers are needed for non-monadic predicates.  In the entry\nof Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology (1902), Peirce\nhimself summarizes the literature on the logic of relatives in the\nfollowing way:\n His 1870 paper is far from being a final product of modern logic,\nbut represents a milestone as the first attempt to formalize relations\nand to introduce quantified phrases. As Peirce states at the beginning\nof the paper, the goal of the project is to apply Boole's algebra of\nlogic to the realm of relations which De Morgan was interested in. As\nwe now know, first-order logic is a logic of relations insofar as\nquantifiers and bound variables are dispensable for a logic of monadic\npredicates.  Along with a notational distinction between monadic\nversus relational predicates in terms of plain fonts and italics,\n“lw” denotes “whatever is lover of a\nwoman” (DNLR CP:3.68) and “lw”\nmeans “a lover of every woman” (DNLR CP:3.77). By\nconnecting multiplication with the phrase ‘every’ and\naddition with ‘some,’ the following passage is a precursor\nfor the notations which appear in his 1885 paper:  \nFrom this [Π′ ≺ Σ′, where Π′\nsignifies logical multiplication and Σ′ signifies logical\naddition] it follows that sw\n≺ sw [i.e., a servant of every woman is a servant\nof a woman] … From this we have (ls)w\n≺ lsw [i.e., a lover-of-a-servant of every woman is\na lover-of-a-servant of a woman]. (DNLR CP:3.97) These notations and algebra led Dipert to the following statement:\n \nC.S. Peirce was the first person in the history of logic to use\nquantifier-like variable-binding operators (briefly in 1870, W2, 392f,\npre-dating Frege's Begriffsschrift (1879)). (Dipert\n2004: 290)  However, the limit of the project of the 1870 paper is clear.  It\ndoes not present a calculus for the logic of relations: \n \nI\nregret that I am not in a situation to be able to perform this labor\n[a calculus, or art of drawing inferences based on the notation I am\nto describe]. (DNLR CP:3.45) \n \nHence, as Dipert said, \n \nthis [no\nconcern with axioms for logic or any ordering of theorems] causes for\nthe modern reader an appearance of casualness, even sloppiness.\n(Dipert 2004: 297) \n \nHere is Putnam's\n observation:[11] \nPeirce gave no system of axioms for first-order logic, although\nhis “existential graphs” are a complete proof procedure\nfor first-order logic (an early form of natural\ndeduction). (Putnam 1982: 298) \n \nWhile a good portion of that\npaper was devoted to classification among relations, the paper has\nimportant notions which became consistent themes throughout Peirce's\nnumerous writings on logic: assigning logical interpretations to\nmathematical (i.e., algebraic in this case)\noperations,[12]\nrelations as sets of ordered pairs, logical sum and logical product,\ncompositions among relations, and matrix\nrepresentation.[13] In a more comprehensive and survey-style\npaper written ten years later entitled  “On the algebra of\n logic” (Peirce 1880).\nwe find the introduction of Σ and Π\nto express logical sums and logical products, and existential and\nuniversal quantifiers, respectively (1880 CP:3.223, 3.247, 3.249).\nInterestingly enough, Peirce again focuses on compositions of\nrelations and predicts when complexity arises, which must have pushed\nhim to the invention of a new notation.  In\n 1882,\nwe see the\nappearance of these two quantifiers with bound variables:\n \nIf\nl denotes any general dual relative, then the coefficient of\nthe pair I:J in l is written\n(l)i j. (CP:3.309)  \nEvery relative term, x, is separable into a part\ncalled ‘self-x,’ Sx, such that Sx =\nΣx(x)ii(I : I).\n(CP:3.310) One more significant step towards the completion of Peirce's\nnotation of first-order logic was taken in his 1883 appendix\n“The logic of\n relatives.”\n Even though it is not a complete paper but\nrather a note, the key notions of his new notation are spelled out more\nclearly than in previous papers.  A relation is modeled by a pair of\nobjects: \n \nA dual relative term, such as ‘lover,’\n‘benefactor,’ ‘servant,’ is a common name\nsignifying a pair of objects. (1883 CP:3.328) \n \nEven though the basic\nidea for ordered pairs existed in the 1870 paper, we can see more\nclearly how it is combined with quantifiers and bound variables in the\n1883 Note (CP:3.329): A general relative may be conceived as a logical aggregate of a number\nof such individual relatives.  Let l denote “lover”;\nthen we may write l = ΣiΣj(l)ij(I : J) \nwhere (l)ij is a numerical coefficient, whose\nvalue is 1 in case I is a lover of J, and 0 in the\nopposite case, and where sums are to be taken for all individuals in\nthe universe.  (1883 CP:3.329) \nWith these tools, Peirce started formalizing sentences which require\nmultiple quantifiers: Thus, ΣiΣj(l)ij > 0 means that something is a lover of something; and ΠiΣj(l)ij > 0 means that  everything is a lover of something. (1883 CP:3.351) \nIn the same paragraph, another significant move was made toward the\nmodern style of first-order logic, that is, to remove algebraic\nrepresentation: We shall, however, naturally omit, in writing the inequalities, the\n‘> 0’ which terminates them all; and the above two\npropositions will appear as \n ΣiΣj(l)ijand\n ΠiΣj(l)ij (1883 CP:3.351) It is worthwhile to note that multiple quantifiers, i.e., both\nuniversal and existential quantifiers, are introduced in one sentence,\nand as we all know, this complicates the matter a great deal.  It did\nnot escape Peirce's attention: The logic of relatives is highly multiform; it is characterized by\ninnumerable immediate inferences, and by various distinct conclusions\nfrom the same sets of premises. … The effect of these\npeculiarities is that this algebra cannot be subjected to hard and\nfast rules like those of the Boolian calculus; and all that can be\ndone in this place is to give a general idea of the way of working\nwith it. (1883 CP:3.342) \nWhen the relative and non-relative operations occur together, the\nrules of the calculus become pretty complicated. (1883 CP:3.351) \nObviously, Peirce noticed a fundamental difference between the logic\nof non-relatives and the logic of relatives, which corresponds to a\ndifference between propositional and first-order logic.  I suspect\nthis is one of the reasons why Peirce did not share Frege's interest in\ndeveloping an axiomatic system—at least for a while—until his EG was\ninvented.  For the rest of the Note, Peirce presents examples in the\nnew notation involving multiple quantifiers (1883 CP:3.352–3.357). \nBy reading one of Peirce's best-known logic papers, the 1885 paper\n“On the algebra of logic: A contribution to the philosophy of\n notation” (1885a),\n  we realize that as far as first-order logic goes,\nthe key concepts and vocabulary were already formed in his previous\nwork discussed above.  We also note that the goal of the 1885 paper\noutlined in the first section is more or less the same as the proposal\nmade in his 1870 paper: “The first is the extension of the power\nof logical algebra over the whole of its proper realm” \n(1885a CP:3.364). Also, he almost reiterates the limit of the project which he\n“regrets” in 1870: “I shall not be able to perfect\nthe algebra sufficiently to give facile methods of reaching logical\nconclusions” (1885a CP:3.364). That is, we should not expect a\nfull-blown deductive system in this paper, but “I can only give\na method by which any legitimate conclusion may be reached and any\nfallacious one avoided” (1885a CP:3.364). He carries out his promise\nin section 3 of the paper by suggesting a list of methods of\ntransformation, which is not complete.  The following are some of the\nrules involving\n quantifers (1885a CP:3.396):[14] So far, we have argued that Peirce's insight on relations pushed\nhim to extend the territory of logic from monadic,\nnon-relational, propositional logic to relational\nquantification logic.  This represented the beginning of modern logic as we\nknow it.  In this section, we take up a different angle of Peirce's\nadventure—to extend forms of representation from\nsymbolic systems to\ndiagrammatic systems. Believing that this aspect of Peirce's project is\nnot yet fully appreciated, we present a story where his two different\nkinds of extension—one from non-relations to relations and the\nother from\nsymbolic to diagrammatic—are connected with each other. In spite of Peirce's own evaluation of EG as ‘my chef\nd'oeuvre,’ EG had to wait to be understood for a half century\nuntil two philosophers—Don Roberts and Jay Zeman—produced\ntheir impressive \n work.[15] \n In the 1980's, EG was receiving attention\nfrom new disciplines—computer science and artificial\nintelligence—thanks to John Sowa's novel application of EG to\nknowledge representation.  More recently, interdisciplinary research\non multi-modal reasoning has drawn our attention to non-symbolic\nsystems (see, e.g., Barwise & Allwein (eds.) 1996 and Barwise\n& Etchemendy 1991) and EG, not surprisingly, occupied the top of\ntheir list.  In that context, Shin (2002) focused on differences\nbetween symbolic versus diagrammatic systems and suggested a new way\nof understanding the EG system, though this was criticized in\nPietarinen 2006. \nWhile Peirce mainly presented linear expressions in his official writings from 1870 to \n 1885,[16]\n the notation adopted in Frege's\n1879 Begriffsschrift is more iconic; it is at least not as\nlinear as Peirce's in the above period.  However, it is Peirce, not\nFrege, who invented a full-blown non-symbolic system for first-order\nlogic—Existential Graphs.  As the EG system has been\ninvestigated more rigorously, philosophical questions involving\nPeirce's invention of the system have been raised as well.  The\ndiscovery of EG's power and novelty has naturally led us to other\nparts of Peirce's philosophy.  Why and how did the invention of EG\ncome about?  What does EG reveal about Peirce's view of logic and\nrepresentation? Many of us have pointed out Peirce's theory of signs, which classifies\nsigns as being of three kinds—symbols, indices, and \n icons—as the foremost theoretical background for Peirce's\n EG.[17]\n It is natural to connect Peirce's interest in icons with his invention of\ngraphical systems.  We do think the connection is real, and the more we\nexplore his view on signs the better we understand his EG (Shin 2002:\n22–35).  But we do not think his sign theory could provide us\nwith everything we need for the story of EG.  There is a big gap\nbetween Peirce's talk about\n icons[18]\n and his invention of full-blown graphical systems; something else \nhas to be brought into the picture to explain how Peirce arrived\nat EG from his talk about icons. From a slightly different perspective, van Heijenoort's's\ndistinction between Boole's calculus ratiocinator  versus\nFrege's lingua characteristica\ncould be related to the topic.\nAgreeing with both Hintikka's and Goldfarb's evaluation that Peirce\nbelongs to Boole's tradition, Shin found a connection between the\nmodel-theoretic view of logic (where Boole and Peirce are placed) and\nEG's birth (see Shin 2002: 14–16, and Pietarinen 2006). However,\nPeirce's awareness of the re-interpretation of language is necessary,\nbut not sufficient,\nfor his pursuit of a different form of representation. While the\nacknowledgment of the possibility of different models of a given system\nwas presupposed by Peirce's project for various kinds of systems, not\nevery Boolean has presented multiple systems. Without challenging these existing explanations involving Peirce's\nEG, in this entry we bring in one overlooked but crucial\naspect of Peirce's journey to EG so that our story may fill in part of\nthe puzzle of Peirce's overall philosophy.  Peirce's mission for a new\nlogic started with the question of how to represent relations, which led him to invent\nquantifiers and bound variables, as we discussed in the previous\nsection. We claim that the same commitment—that is, to represent relations in a\nlogical system—was a main motivation behind Peirce's search\nfor a new kind of sign system: the iconic representation of\nrelations.  Peirce's work on Euler/Venn diagrams provides us with\nanother piece of evidence to support our claim that the main\nmotivation behind EG was to represent relations.  While improving Venn\nsystems, Peirce realizes that the following defect cannot be\neliminated: \n[T]he system [Venn's] affords no means of exhibiting reasoning, the\ngist of which is of a relational or abstractional kind.  It does not\nextend to the logic of relatives.  (Peirce 1911 CP:4.356) \nAgain, we do not think this is the crucial ingredient for the\ncreation of EG, but one key element which works well with\nhis theory of signs and his model-theoretic view of logic. Peirce's graphical representation was first published in his 1897\npaper “The Logic of Relatives”.  After\nhis own new notation came out in 1885 as seen above, why did Peirce\nrevisit the logic of relations?  The first paragraph of the paper\nprovides a direct answer: \nI desire to convey some idea of what the new logic is, how two\n“algebras,” that is, systems of diagrammatical\nrepresentation by means of letters and other characters, more or less\nanalogous to those of the algebra of arithmetic, have been invented\nfor the study of the logic of relatives, and …. (1897 CP:3.456) Two things should be noted.  One is that diagrammatic systems are\nalso called ‘algebra’ by Peirce.  That is, according to\nPeirce, algebra is not limited to symbolic systems.  The other is that\nPeirce makes it clear that two different forms of algebra carry\nout the new logic of relations, not new logics. In thinking about the scope of the logic of relations, the question\narises: Why did Peirce feel the need for another form of\nrepresentation different from the 1885 notation?  “I must\nclearly show what a relation is” (1897 CP:3.456). The clear\nunderstanding of ‘relations,’ Peirce believes, is a guide\nfor his excursion into different forms of logical systems.  To the\nreader's surprise, Peirce devotes three sections to the three grades\nof meaning presented in his well-known paper “How To Make Our\nIdeas \n Clear” (1878).\n\n(See the entry on\n Peirce's Theory of Signs.) The first grade of understanding the word ‘relation’\ncomes from our ordinary experience, and the second grade is to have a\nmore abstract and general definitional understanding.  According to\nPeirce, that is not enough to achieve a full understanding of the word\n‘relation’. Finally, Peirce's hallmark of the pragmatic\nmaxim leads us to the third grade of clarity: \nIt appears, then, the rule for attaining the third grade of clearness\nof apprehension is as follows: Consider what effects, which might\nconceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our\nconception to have. Then the whole of our conception of those effects\nis the whole of our conception of the object. (1878 CP:5.402) \nIn order to understand what a relation is, we need to know what\nfollows from it.  Then, the question is how we know what its\nconsequences are.  Here is one answer given by Peirce in the 1897\npaper, as far as the term “relation” goes: \nThe third grade of clearness consists in such a representation of the\nidea that fruitful reasoning can be made to turn upon it, and that it\ncan be applied to the resolution of difficult practical problems.\n(1897 CP:3.457) \nTherefore, how a relation is represented is crucial in figuring out\nwhat follows from a relational state of affairs.  Better\nrepresentations will yield more ‘fruitful reasoning’ and\nhence will be more helpful for solving practical problems.  It is\nobvious that in the paper Peirce intends to search for\nmore desirable  representations.  Importantly, in section 4\nwhen the third grade of clearness of the meaning\n‘relation’ is discussed, diagrammatic representation of\nrelations makes its first appearance. Influenced by A. B. Kempe's graphic \n representation,[19]\n Peirce finds an analogy between relations and chemical compounds:\n \nA\nchemical atom is quite like a relative in having a definite number of\nloose ends or ‘unsaturated bonds,’ corresponding to the\nblanks of the relative. (1897 CP:3.469)\n \n A chemical molecule\nconsists of chemical atoms, and the manner in which atoms are connected with one\nanother is based on the number of loose ends of each atom.  For\nexample, chemical atom H has one loose end and chemical atom O has\ntwo.  So, the following combination is possible, and it is a\nrepresentation of the water molecule, H2O: \nAn analogy to the logic of relations goes like this, putting Peirce's\nideas into more modern terms: A proposition consists of names (proper\nnames or indices) and predicates, and each predicate has a fixed\narity.  For example, the predicate ‘love’ needs two names\nand ‘gives’ three.  Hence, the following diagrammatic\nrepresentation is grammatical and it is a representation of the\nproposition “John loves Mary.” Peirce created a novel and productive analogy in representation\nbetween chemistry and the logic of relation by adopting the doctrine\nof valency as the key element for the analogy, as shown in the above\ntwo diagrams.  Believing that this graphic style of representation\nwould help us conceive the consequences or effects of a given relation\nin a more efficient way, Peirce presents Entitative Graphs, which is a\npredecessor of\n EG.[20] EG keeps the representation of a relation developed in Peirce's\n1897 paper, and it remains as his final and the most cherished notation\nfor the logic of relations (CP: 3.456–3.552). EG consists of\nthree parts—Alpha, Beta, and Gamma—which respectively correspond roughly to\npropositional, first-order, and modal logic.  After\npresenting the Alpha system in a formal way, we discuss the Beta\nsystem of EG focusing on Peirce's novel ideas in expanding a\npropositional graphic system to a quantificational graphic system.\nFor more details, we recommend works on EG by Roberts, Zeman, Sowa,\nand Shin. Below we introduce Alpha Graphs as a formal system in a standard\nway, that is, to present its syntax (inductively) and its semantics\n(recursively).  In order to place Peirce's graphic systems in the\ntraditional well-developed discourse of logic, we introduce an\nintermediate stage, that is, to read off Peirce's graphs into symbolic\nlanguage.  This will make Peirce's graphs more accessible, and at the\nsame time support our claim that Peirce extended forms of\nrepresentations under the same scope of logic. As a result, the reader might notice some differences between\nPeirce's terminology and ours since some of Peirce's terms are\nmodified versions of familiar phrases.  Inevitably we will end up\nsimplifying many of Peirce's ideas behind EG.  We also would like to\nemphasize that this is not the only way to approach Peirce's EG.  For\nexample, some claim that game-theoretic semantics were foreshadowed by\nPeirce, and thus  argue for a more dynamic understanding of EG from the\ngame-theoretic point of view (Burch 1994; Hilpinen 1982; Hintikka\n1997; Pietarinen 2006). \nHere we present two equivalent reading methods for the system.  The\nEndoporeutic reading algorithm, formalized based on Peirce's\nsuggestion, is a traditional way to understand EG.  An alternative\nreading method, the Multiple reading algorithm, was more recently\npresented to approach EG in a more efficient way (for more details,\nsee Shin 2002, §4.3). \nEach of these two readings has its own strength.  The Endopreutic\nreading assures us that the Alpha system is truth-functionally\ncomplete, since it has power to express conjunction and negation.\nHowever, this traditional method has been partly responsible for the\nfollowing two incorrect judgments about Alpha diagrams: (i) There is\nnot much difference between the Alpha system and a propositional\nlanguage with only two connectives, ∧ and ¬, except that\nAlpha diagrams have cuts instead of symbolic connectives.  (ii) When\nit comes down to practical use, we have no reason to adopt the Alpha system\nover propositional languages with more connectives justlike how we do not want to use only two\nconnectives in a language. Challenging these misconceptions, the Multiple readings algorithm\nshows that Alpha diagrams do not have to be read off as a sentence\nwith ‘∧’ and ‘¬’ only, but can be\ndirectly read off in terms of other connectives as well.  Two\nquestions may be raised: (i) Is there a redundancy in the Multiple\nreadings method?  For example, is 4(b) above dispensable in terms of 3\nand 4(a)?  (ii) Does this new reading show that the Alpha system is\njust like a propositional language with various connectives? Let us answer these questions through the following simple\nexample: The Endoporeutic reading allows us to get the first reading only,\nbut we may obtain different sentences by the Multiple Readings.  Of\ncourse, all of these sentences are logically equivalent.  Here is an\ninteresting point: In the case of symbolic systems, we need to prove\nthe equivalence among the above sentences by using inference rules.\nBut, derivation processes are dispensable in the case of the Alpha\nsystem when the Multiple readings are\n adopted.[22]\n  Hence, having the clause 4(b) above in\naddition to clauses 3 and 4(a) is not redundant, but instead\nhighlights a fundamental difference between Alpha diagrams and a\nsymbolic language with various connectives (see Shin 2002:\n§§4.3.2, 4.4.4, and 4.5.3). \nSince we have the semantics for propositional logic and our reading\nmethods translate Alpha diagrams into a propositional language, we can\nlive without the direct semantics.  However, if one insists on the\ndirect semantics: \nSince it is a deductive system, we need inference rules (see Roberts\n1973: 40–45). \nEmphasizing the symmetry both in erasure versus insertion and in even\nversus odd number of cuts, Shin rewrote the rules (2002,\n84–85): \nFor examples of deduction sequences, refer to Roberts' pp. 45–46 and\nShin 2002, p. 91.  In §2, we showed that formalizing relations was a key motivation\nbehind Peirce's new logic—first-order logic.  In §3.1, we\nestablished a connection between Peirce's own pragmatic maxim and his\ngraphic representation of relations.  Peirce did not aim to present a\nnew logic by inventing a graphic system, but rather to present another\nnew notation for the logic carried out by quantifiers and bound\nvariables.  He almost took it for granted that a graphic\nrepresentation of relations helps us observe their consequences in a\nmore efficient way.  Hence, the Beta system may be considered to be\nthe final stop of Peirce's long journey, which started in 1870 at the\nlatest. We will not go into the formal details of the Beta system in this\nentry but will instead refer to Chapter 5 of Shin, where three slightly different\napproaches to Beta graphs—Zeman's, Roberts', and Shin's—are\ndiscussed at a full length.  While Zeman's reading is comprehensive\nand formal, Roberts' method seems to appeal to a more intuitive\nunderstanding of the system.  Taking advantage of the merits of these\ntwo existing works, Shin developed a new reading method of Beta\ngraphs and reformulated the transformation rules of the\n system.[24]\n  Her approach focuses on visual features\nof Beta graphs and highlights fundamental differences between symbolic\nversus diagrammatic systems.  In the remaining part of the entry, we\nwould like to examine how the essence of the logic of relations is\ngraphically represented in the Beta system so that the reader may\nplace EG in the larger context of Peirce's enterprise. The introduction of quantifiers and bound variables is believed to\nbe one of the key steps of first-order logic in symbolic\nsystems.  This is why some logicians take Peirce's 1885 paper “On\nthe Algebra of Logic: A contribution to the Philosophy of\nNotations” to be the birthplace of modern logic. If this is the case, then how does\nPeirce represent quantifiers and bound variables in Beta graphs? Interestingly enough, when Peirce considered a graphic system his\nfirst concern was representation of relations, not representation of\nquantifiers.  As we said in §3.1, Peirce\npresented diagrammatic representation based on an analogy to chemical\nmolecules for a full understanding of relations.  Hence, the arity of\na predicate is represented by the number of lines radiating from the\npredicate term.  Next, Peirce extends the use of a line to connect\npredicates: \nIn many reasonings it becomes necessary to write a copulative\nproposition in which two members relate to the same individual so as\nto distinguish these members.…  [I]t is necessary that the signs\nof them should be connected in fact.  No way of doing this can be more\nperfectly iconic than that exemplified in [the following graph] \n(1903b CP:4.442): \n \nThe line connecting two predicates, representing one and the\nsame object, is called a line of identity by Peirce.  That\nis, the sameness is represented visually in Beta\ndiagrams.[25] In\nthe case of a symbolic language, we may adopt one and the same\nquantified variable-type to represent the identity.  For example, the above\ndiagram says ∃x(x<A\n∧ B<x), and hence, the variable-type x\n(roughly) corresponds to the identity line.  However, the same\nvariable-type is not sufficient for expressing the sameness in other\ncases, e.g., ∃x(x<A\n∧ B<x) →\n∃x(x<C). The way universal and existential statements are represented in the\nBeta system highlights a difference between graphic and symbolic\nsystems.  Rather than adopting one more syntactic device for\nquantification, Peirce relies on the following visual features: \n[A]ny line of identity whose outermost part is evenly enclosed refers\nto something, and any one whose outermost part is oddly\nenclosed refers to anything there may\n be. (1903b CP:4.458[26]) \nLet us borrow the two following graphs from\n Roberts (1973: 51):[27] \n\n \nThe first graph (where the outermost part of the line is evenly, zero,\nenclosed) says that something good is ugly, and the second graph\n(where the outermost part is enclosed once) says that everything good\nis\n ugly.[28] How about the scope problem which arises when multiple quantifiers\nare used?  In the case of a symbolic system, the linear order takes\ncare of the problem.  Peirce's solution for EG is to read off another\nkind of visuality: The less enclosed the outermost part of a line is,\nthe larger the scope that the line gets. Roberts' following example illustrates the scope matter nicely\n(1973: 52): The first graph says ∀x(Catholic(x)\n→∃y(Adores(x,y) ∧\nWoman(y))) and the second\n∃y(Woman(y) ∧\n∀x(Catholic(x)\n→ Adores(x,y))).  In the first graph, the\nline whose outermost part is oddly enclosed is less enclosed than the\nline whose outermost part is evenly enclosed. Therefore, the universal\nquantifier has larger scope than the existential quantifier.  In the\nsecond graph, it is the other way around. \nLet us summarize three interesting features of the Beta system:","contact.mail":"Sun-Joo.Shin@yale.edu","contact.domain":"yale.edu"}]
