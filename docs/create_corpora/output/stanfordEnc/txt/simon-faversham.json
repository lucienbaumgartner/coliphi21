He is considered a modist, among other things because of\nhis use of the notions of modi praedicandi and modi\nessendi in his commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories (cf. Marmo 1999). Simon’s work as an\nAristotelian commentator heavily relies on Albert the Great’s\nparaphrases on the Aristotelian corpus. Simon’s\nquestion-commentaries often portray key medieval discussions in a\nsomewhat undeveloped state. But in some issues, such as the discussion\non empty reference, he exhibits good philosophical analysis and\nresourcefulness. Simon’s works are also of great historical\ninterest because they represent an important stage in the development\nof thirteenth-century philosophical ideas. His corpus is relatively\nunexplored, and although an important part of it is extant, a large\npart is also unedited.\n\n\nSimon of Faversham was born circa 1260 in Faversham, a seaport town in\nKent,\n England.[1]\n He became master of arts at the University of Oxford, but he taught\nat the Arts faculty of the University of Paris in the1280s, where\nprobably most of his works were produced, even if he may have revised\nsome of them after his return to Oxford in 1289. Later in his life\nSimon became a Doctor of Theology at the University of Oxford. After\nhis return to England, he held several clerical offices: he became\nsub-deacon at Croydon in 1289, and deacon at Bocking and rector of\nPreston in 1290. Simon became chancellor of the University of Oxford\nin 1304. In 1305, archbishop Winchelsey named him archdeacon of\nCanterbury, the highest ecclesiastical appointment in England for\nnon-priests. After giving up this post, Simon was named rector of\nReculver, but soon after he lost his appointment to the candidate of\nthe Papal Curia. Simon died in 1306 in a trip to the Papal curia,\nwhere he was going to fight the loss of his appointment as rector of\nReculver. \nSimon’s philosophical corpus consists mostly of commentaries on\nthe Corpus Aristotelicum. His logical works are undoubtedly\nthe most thoroughly studied, and consist of the following\ncommentaries: \nMost of these are edited. 4, 6 and 9 are only extant in manuscript\nform, but there are partial editions of 4 and\n 6.[2] \nSimon’s works on Aristotle’s natural philosophy are\nconsiderably less studied, and consist of the following\ncommentaries: \nMost of these are extant only in manuscript form. Only 12.1 has been\nfully edited (Ebbesen 2013). The questions on De anima III\n(Sharp 1934) are also edited, although only from one manuscript.\nFinally, there are partial editions of 10 and\n 15.[3] \nLike most thirteenth-century commentators on the Logica vetus\n(Boethius’s Latin translations of Porphyry’s\nIsagoge and Aristotle’s Categories and De\ninterpretatione, together with Boethius’s commentaries on\nthese texts), Simon of Faversham begins his commentary with a\nprologue, which treats of the subject matter of logic and the division\nof logic, corresponding to the division of Aristotle’s\nOrganon into eight(!)\n treatises.[4] \nSimon belongs to the logical tradition of the last quarter of the\nthirteenth-century, which considers the subject matter of logic to be\nthe methods of knowledge acquisition (modi sciendi): the\nintellectual operations whereby we can proceed from something known to\nthe knowledge of something unknown. These methods are definition,\ndivision, and, most importantly, syllogistic reasoning (In\nIsag.: prologue). Accordingly, logic is neither a purely\ntheoretical science, as it does not consider essences or quiddities,\nnor a purely practical science, as its aim is not practical action. As\na science, logic is rather instrumental to the proper functioning of\nthe theoretical sciences (In Isag.: q.1). \nAs it is commonly the case, Simon also holds that logic is about\nlogical intentions (cf. In Isag.: q.2). But Simon’s\nlogic of intentions is not nearly as developed as what we find in\nlater masters such as Radulphus Brito. Logical intentions are notions\nthat can be applied to the knowledge of quiddities. According to\nSimon, the intellect forms these intentions from the ways things\npresent themselves to it (i.e., from apparentia). Thereafter,\nthe intellect attributes different intentions to different things\naccording to different properties. For instance, after having noticed\nthat some ways of being are common to several things, the intellect\nforms the logical intention of species, after which the intellect can\napply this intention to the concept of man and express this act with\nthe assertion ‘man is a species’. Consequently, despite\nnot being a theoretical science, logic is ultimately grounded in the\nproperties of things from which logical intentions are taken (In\nIsag.: q.2).  \nAs regards the division of logic, which is more precisely a division\nof syllogistic reasoning, Simon’s commentary is noteworthy in\none regard: following in the footsteps of Giles of Rome, Simon\nconsiders rhetoric and poetics to be parts of logic, i.e., to function\nby way of syllogisms. A syllogistic argument is divided based on the\nvarying degrees of certainty of its premises (In Isag.:\nprologue). It is also remarkable that, in his commentary on the\nSophistical Refutations, Simon includes the alethic modality\nof the conclusion as a further criterion for the division of\nsyllogistic reasoning (In SE: prologue). Hence, if the\nstarting point of reasoning is a mere suspicion\n (suspicio),[5]\n the syllogistic reasoning is rhetorical and the conclusion will also\nbe a suspicion (such reasoning is dealt with in the\nRhetoric). If it “proceeds from fictitious elements\nthat portray horror or pleasure” (In Isag.: prologue),\nthe reasoning is poetic and the conclusion will be an estimation\n(aestimatio) (such reasoning is dealt with in the\nPoetics). If it proceeds from probable knowledge, the\nreasoning is dialectical and the conclusion will be an opinion or\nbelief (such reasoning is dealt with in the Topics). If it\nproceeds from the knowledge of essential causes and proper attributes,\nthe reasoning is demonstrative and the conclusion will be certain and\ninfallible knowledge (such reasoning is dealt with in the\nPosterior Analytics). Finally, if it proceeds from knowledge\nthat seems to be true, but is not, the reasoning is sophistical and\nthe conclusion will be an error (deceptio) (such reasoning is\ndealt with in the Sophistical Refutations). \nIn addition to this division of syllogistic reasoning into five kinds,\nlogic also studies common aspects of syllogistic reasoning, the moods\nand figures of the Prior Analytics. \nFinally, logic is also concerned with the simple thoughts out of which\nthe premises of syllogistic reasoning are composed. In the\nCategories, those simple thoughts are considered insofar as\nthey are related to a category of being. In the De\ninterpretatione those same concepts are considered insofar as\nthey are the subject and predicate of a mental composition or division\n(In Isag.: prologue). \nSimon also joins in the medieval discussion of the signification of\nwords—whether they signify things or thoughts—a discussion\nprompted by Aristotle’s claim in the first chapter of the De\ninterpretatione that words signify thoughts. Simon clearly\nopposes the Boethian tradition, which defends the immediate\nsignification of thoughts, and sides with those who claim that words\nsignify\n things.[6] \nFollowing a division first attested in Porphyry, Simon divides words\ninto first and second imposition. Words of first imposition are given\nas names of quiddities, which have being independently of a knowing\nsubject. Words of second imposition are given as names of logical\nintentions, the being of which depends on a knowing subject. Words of\nsecond imposition clearly signify thoughts, so the controversy does\nnot concern them. Rather, it concerns words of first imposition, such\nas ‘man’ and ‘stone’. \nFor Simon, words of first imposition do not signify a thought but a\nquiddity. His argument goes as follows: \nIt is remarkable that, in Simon’s view, ‘x’\nsignifies x only if both the expression-condition for the\nspeaker and the comprehension-condition for the listener are met. This\ndouble condition for signification, typical of the last quarter of the\nthirteenth century, represents a break with respect to the more\nexpression-oriented notion of signification common in the second and\nthird quarters of the century (Marmo 1999).  \nNow, following the Avicennian idea that being—mental or\nactual—is an accident of essences, Simon also makes clear that\n‘x’ does not signify quiddities according to their\nexistence in the external world. In other words, ‘man’\ndoes not signify a particular man, but man as a quiddity. This part of\nthe argument goes as follows: \nConsequently, Simon also holds that words of first imposition the\nreferents of which are all destroyed do not lose their signification,\nbecause, for a word to signify, its significate—the\nquiddity—simply needs to be thought, and a quiddity can continue\nto be thought even after the destruction of all its instances. \nSimon also takes part in the medieval discussion of whether truth is a\nproperty of thoughts or things. Simon gives a solution typical of the\nperiod, according to which truth is above all a property of the\nknowing subject who is in possession of a true thought (In\nPerih.: q.6). \nSimon accepts the common medieval definition of a true thought as one\nthat is in agreement (adequatio) with things, an agreement\ndetermined by the way things are. However, unlike other\nthirteenth-century masters of arts (e.g., Robert Kilwardby and\nRadulphus Brito), Simon maintains that this agreement concerns the\nsecond, and composite, operation of the intellect—composition\nand division—as well as the first, and simple, one—the\napprehension of quiddities (In Perih.: q.6). Hence, while\nother masters hold that truth can only obtain between composite\nobjects (i.e., composite thoughts and composite things), Simon holds\nthat, since the intellectual apprehension of a quiddity is naturally\nin agreement with this quiddity, it is also susceptible of being true\n(In Perih.: q.6). Regarding the truth of composite items,\nhowever, Simon’s position is remarkably elegant, as is evident\nfrom his discussion of empty reference in his commentary on the\nPrior Analytics. \nSimon’s position as regards empty reference is crucially\ndifferent from the one held by modists such as Boethius of Dacia and Radulphus Brito,\nwho claim that the truth-makers of essential predications, as\n‘man is an animal’, are real things in the external world,\nso that ‘man is an animal’ would be false if no man\n existed.[7]\n Simon, however, claims that it is true, supporting his claim with a\ncareful account of truth-determination. According to him, for an\nessential predication such as ‘man is an animal’ to be\ntrue, it suffices that the quiddities expressed by the subject and the\npredicate are understood and signified. They must be understood\nbecause ‘man is an animal’ expresses the mental\ncomposition of man and animal, which evidently requires man and animal\nto be understood (Ebbesen 1987: 159). They must also be signified\nbecause otherwise, ‘man is an animal’ would have no\ncontent at all—it cannot simply express an empty thought.\nHowever, ‘man’ and ‘animal’ do not need to\nrefer to or signify real things in the external world. \nThe latter claim is shown as follows: assertions of the form ‘S\nis\n P’[8]\n involve the relevant mode of being of the significate of the\npredicate (henceforth ‘of the predicate’). In assertions\nwhere real accidents are predicated (e.g., being white, running,\netc.), the relevant mode of being of the predicate is actual\nexistence; therefore, their truth-makers must be real things in the\nexternal world (Ebbesen 1987: 160). Likewise, in assertions where\nlogical intentions are predicated (e.g., belonging to a species or\ngenus), the relevant mode of being of the predicate is mental\nexistence; therefore, their truth-makers are thoughts. But in\nessential predication, the relevant mode of being is neither actual\nnor mental existence, because essences are notionally independent of\nany sort of existence; therefore, the truth-makers are simply the\nquiddities understood and subsequently signified by the subject and\npredicate (Ebbesen 1987: 160). Therefore, ‘man is an\nanimal’ is true even when no real man exists, simply because\nbeing an animal is a definitional part of being a man.  \nSimon’s general psychology is standard Aristotelian doctrine, in\nmany aspects derived from Albert the Great’s and Aquinas’s\npsychological teachings. However, as we shall see, Simon sometimes\nconflates their views, suggesting he was not entirely aware of their\nopposition. Thus, Simon holds that the rational soul is the\nsubstantial form of the human body because it is that on account of\nwhich humans can perform their proper operation, i.e., intellection.\nHowever, unlike the substantial form of purely material things, the\nsubstantial form of a human being does not emerge from a natural\narrangement of matter, but is given to the human body as its\nperfection by an external source, i.e., by the first cause. Simon then\ndescribes the soul both as the perfection (like Albert) and as the\nsubstantial form (like Aquinas) of the human body, but seems unaware\nof the conflict between Albert’s and Aquinas’s positions.\nFor Albert, who wants to avoid psychological materialism, the soul is\nthe perfection, and not the form, of the human body; a soul that is\ngiven to it by God. For Aquinas, however, who wants to make the\nrational soul the defining element in a human being, the soul must be\nthe intrinsic substantial form of the human body, which is\nnonetheless separable after the body’s death. It remains unclear\nwhether Simon intentionally conflated the two views, and if so,\nwhether he thought the two views could be somehow reconciled. \nThe rational soul has three faculties—vegetative, sensitive and\nintellectual—of which the sensitive and the intellectual are\ncognitive. The sensitive faculty is bodily because its operations\nfully depend on bodily organs. It includes the external\nsenses—touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight—as well as\nthe so-called internal senses—common sense, phantasia\nand memory. By contrast, the intellectual faculty is separate, i.e.,\nwith respect to the body, because it does not depend for its operation\non bodily organs, even though it is triggered by a representation\nobtained from the senses. Accordingly, Simon, like Albert and Aquinas,\nrejects the position of those who, like Avicenna and Averroes, posit\nsome kind of metaphysical separation of the intellect from the human\nbody. \nAccording to Simon, the intellect is the faculty of the rational soul\nwhereby it thinks. Simon, who follows the Aristotelian doctrine\nclosely, holds this faculty to be immaterial, passive, and separate.\nIt is separate because it does not need to use an organ in order to\nperform its operation of intellection. It is also passive, but not in\nthe same sense matter is passive. In fact, there are two senses in\nwhich something is passive: it can receive forms with or without\nundergoing qualitative change. Like matter, the intellect receives\nforms because it needs an intelligible object on which to perform its\nproper operation. But matter is passive in a further and more\nfundamental sense: when brought to act by a form, it suffers\nqualitative change. The intellect, however, does not suffer\nqualitative change, but is simply actualized. Accordingly, the\nintellect is passive simply because it is potential with respect to\nthe act of intellection. And precisely because it does not suffer\nqualitative change when it is brought to act, the intellect is also\nsaid to be immaterial. \nThe intellectual faculty, i.e., the intellect, comprises a passive\ncapacity—the possible intellect—and an active\ncapacity—the agent intellect, which is the intrinsic active\nprinciple of the act of intellection (In De an.: q.13). The\nproper operation of the passive capacity is apprehension, i.e., the\nassimilation of quiddities through the reception of intelligible\nforms. In turn, the proper operation of the active capacity is\nabstraction, i.e., the production of intelligible forms which trigger\nthe operation of the possible intellect (In De an.:\nq.13). \nIntellection is the proper operation of an intellect that comprises\nboth a passive and an active capacity. Hence, the psychological\nmechanisms of intellection include the abstraction performed by the\nagent intellect and the apprehension produced in the possible\nintellect (In De an.: q.16). \nThe primary object of intellection is a quiddity presented to the\nintellect in the form of an intelligible species (In De an.:\nq.10). Since forms are material and particular in both external things\nand sensory representations (phantasmata), and since the\nintelligible object must be immaterial and universal, the intellect\nmust produce an immaterial object to represent those forms under the\naspect of universality—the intelligible species. The intellect\ndoes this through the act of abstraction performed by its active\ncapacity, the agent intellect (In De an.: q.12). \nThe agent intellect endows the quiddity with intelligibility: through\nits act of abstraction it makes universal and immaterial the material\nand particular quiddity in the sensory representation (In De\nan.: q.12 and q.16). Simon, however, wavers between different\ndescriptions of the act of abstraction. On one hand, he describes it\nas similar to the act of illumination, so that just as light enables\nthe eye to see and the visible object to be seen, so the agent\nintellect enables the possible intellect to think and the quiddity in\nthe sensory representation to be thought (In De an.: q.12).\nConsequently, he seems to consider intellection as similar to the act\nof vision. Nonetheless, the similarity is not complete, because the\nvisible object is visible in itself, whereas the quiddity in the\nsensory representation must be made intelligible by the agent\nintellect. On the other hand, Simon describes the act of abstraction\nas the extraction of an intelligible species from the sensory\nrepresentation, a species that is ‘re-positioned’ in the\npossible intellect, thus actualizing its act of apprehension (In\nDe an.: q.16). Later commentators would reject one or the other\nmodel of abstraction depending on the extent of their realism about\nessences. Thus, the Averroist master John of Jandun rejects the\nillumination model because there is no way for something that exists\nin a bodily organ to be made universal, whether by illumination or\notherwise, while remaining in that organ. Radulphus Brito, however,\nrejects the ‘re-positioning’ model because it fails to\nexplain the transfer of a form from the material to the immaterial\nrealm. Simon, it seems, is again unaware of the conflicts each model\nfaces, as well as of the difficulties that would arise from holding\nboth. \nSince Simon’s commentary on the Parva naturalia does\nnot contain commentaries on De sensu and De memoria,\nthe best place to reconstruct his views on the physiological and\npsychological mechanisms of sensory cognition is his commentary on\nDe somno et vigilia, which also covers De insomniis\nand De divinatione per somnum. Question 13* of this\ncommentary provides broad accounts of the physiological and\npsychological mechanisms of dreams and divination in dreams (ed.\nEbbesen 2013).  \nAccording to Simon, dreams are produced by the common sense from\nimages (idola) sent to it by the phantasia. Dreams,\nhowever, have different origins, stemming either from the human being\nhimself or from celestial bodies. If from the human being, they either\nstem from his body or soul. Dreams stem from someone’s body when\nthe powers of a bodily organ are affected by the choleric or\nphlegmatic humors (two of the four bodily fluids in Hippocratic\nmedical doctrine). When the organs are thus affected, the\nphantasia forms images that are in agreement with those\nfluids and sends them to the common sense. A person can then dream\nthat she is on fire, for example, if the choleric humor is dominant.\nDreams stem from someone’s soul when during sleep the soul is\naffected by a memory, e.g., of a friend who is far away. A person can\nthen have a melancholic dream about her friend. \nDreams with their origin in the celestial bodies explain the\npossibility of divination in dreams. Such dreams originate from an\ninflux the human body receives from the celestial bodies. Thereafter,\nthe phantasia forms images in agreement with the influx and\nsends them to the common sense. When the organ of the common sense is\naffected by those images, the common sense produces likenesses of\nthings that will happen. Thus, thanks to the influx of the celestial\nbodies, humans can foresee future things in dreams, for instance,\nrelated to war or the fertility of the land. According to Simon, who\nfollows in Averroes’s footsteps, this sort of dream is divinely\ngiven to humans because they lack the cognitive insight to know future\nthings that are useful or harmful. The premonitory dream, however,\ndoes not provide an exact sign of the future thing. In fact, the\ndiviner must interpret her dream in order to judge what the dream is\nsupposed to signify. Since divination is part of astrology, a good\ninterpretation requires that one understand properly both the\nmechanisms of dreams and celestial bodies (Ebbesen 2013: 144). When\nproperly interpreted, divination in dreams provides accurate\ninformation about the future: \n… it is infallibly true that the images formed by the\nphantastic power [i.e., the phantasia] are signs of such\neffects, and that these effects occur by necessity unless a stronger\nmotion supervenes, which … hinders those effects …\n(Ebbesen 2013:\n 145)[9] \nSo, unless something unexpected happens that changes the course of\nevents, a properly interpreted dream originating from the celestial\nbodies is an almost certain indication that a useful or harmful future\nevent will take place. \nSimon did not write a commentary on Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics, or, if he did, it did not survive. However, his\npositions on some crucial metaphysical discussions can be found in his\ncommentaries on Porphyry’s Isagoge and on\nAristotle’s Categories. Here we will sketch his views\non two related issues: universals and individuals, and essence and\nbeing. \nAccording to Simon, universality is a notion the intellect attributes\nto some quiddities that exhibit the capacity to inform several\nindividuals. Take, for instance, Socrates. Socrates presents himself\nas a being endowed with reason and sensation. The soul realizes that\nreason and sensation are found in multiple individuals, so it takes\nbeing a rational animal—being a man—as a unified thing\nthat is proper to many individuals. So, on one hand, being a\nman really inheres in Socrates, and as such it exists only\nparticularly. On the other hand, the intellect considers being a\nman as a unity that can occur in several individuals, and as such\nbeing a man is a universal, and more specifically, a species.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Avicenna, Simon considers two modes of\nbeing of quiddities: a particular mode in individuals and a mental\nmode as the content of concepts to which the notion of universality is\napplied. In this sense, universals are merely notional or\nintellectual, as everything that exists in the external world is\nparticular: \n… man according to existence outside the soul is not a species,\nbecause according to external existence it is particular, but it is a\nspecies according to existence in the soul. In fact, the intellect\ngrounds the intention of the species in the consideration of the\nnature of man as one in many. (In Isag.:\n q.4)[10] \nIn other words, universality is a mode of understanding such\nquiddities as exhibit the capacity to inform several individuals: \n… we must not posit a universal man because he exists\nuniversally. Rather, [man] is universal because it is understood\nuniversally, when [the intellect] sets aside all the individuating\nconditions. (In Isag.:\n q.5)[11] \nIt is also noteworthy that the quiddity need not actually inform\nseveral individuals. Indeed, Simon also holds that the intellect can\napply the notion of species to a quiddity informing only one\nindividual, as in the case of the sun or the moon. Simon grounds his\nposition not only on the examples of these celestial bodies but also\nwith the following argument: \nIn sublunary beings, however, the species is in fact always\ninstantiated in several individuals. Simon’s explanation of this\nfact also reveals his position on the principle of individuation.\nAccording to him, in sublunary beings a single individual is never the\nactualization of the whole matter that can be actualized by its\nnature: \nWhy are there several instances of sublunary beings? … because\nall the matter pertaining to one species is not found in one\nindividual. … But in superior beings all the matter pertaining\nto one species is found in one individual. (In Isag.:\n q.26)[12] \nThe multiplication of individuals of the same kind is caused by the\nexistence of several chunks of matter that can be actualized by the\nsame nature through a quantitative division of matter (In\nIsag.: q.26). But this is only the principle of individuation of\nsublunary, material, beings. Superior, immaterial, beings are\nfundamentally individual, as Simon tells us in his commentary on\nDe anima: \n… particulars are twofold: some by matter, some by subsistence\n(the intelligences are particular in the latter way). Hence, I say\nthat my intellect is particular, not by matter, but by subsistence,\ninasmuch as it is a power subsistent per se and not the act of a body.\n(In De an.:\n q.8)[13] \nSimon seems to hold a twofold account of individuation: there is\nindividuation by a quantitative division of matter, which explains the\nindividuation of material beings; and individuation by subsistence,\nwhich explains the individuation of immaterial beings such as\ncelestial bodies, intelligences and the human intellect. Simon\nundoubtedly introduces his twofold account to circumvent the\nAverroistic solution to the question of the individuation of superior\nbeings via the introduction of spiritual matter. \nIn question 20 of his commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories, Simon argues that substances are either compound\nor simple. In addition, all created substances are a composition of\nessence and being. Compound substances are also composed of matter and\nform. The reason why all created substances are composed of essence\nand being is that being is not part of their essence, but given to\nthem extrinsically by the first being. Thus, Simon strongly suggests\nthat he is committed to the real distinction between essence and\nbeing. \nHowever, as John Longeway pointed out in an earlier version of this\nentry, Simon changes his mind about this. This change is evident in\nquestion 49 of his second commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics, where he addressed the question whether being is\nsomething added to essence. Here, Simon objects Aquinas’s claim\nthat being is something added to essence with the following argument:\n \nEven so, Simon still holds that being is something added to created\nbeings. But how, if not as something real? Since we can understand\nwhat a thing is without considering its possible modes of being (i.e.,\nactual, mental etc.), it seems that there is indeed a distinction\nbetween essence and being (cf. Longeway 2000: 9). So, the distinction\nis either notional or real. It is not real, as was shown with the\nargument above. Therefore, the distinction must be notional: since the\ndefinition of an essence does not include being at all, being must be\na notion added to this definition, a notion that refers to the\nrelation of a substance to its cause (cf. Longeway 2000: 10–11).\nHence, we can think of a substance as some kind of thing (e.g., a man)\naccording to its essence (esse essentiae), but we can also\nthink of it as something that exists in a causally ordered reality,\naccording to its being in an effect (esse in effectu) (cf.\nLongeway 2000: 13). \nFinally, in question 27 of his commentary on the Categories,\nSimon straightforwardly opts for the analogy of the predication of\nbeing across the ten Aristotelian categories. Being is not univocally\npredicated as the genus of the categories because it is not univocally\npredicated of substance and accident. In fact, accidents do not have\nbeing without qualification because they only have quiddity in\nrelation to substances, and so their being depends on the being of\nsubstances. But being is not purely equivocal with respect to\nsubstance and accident either, because accidents have being in a\ncertain respect thanks to their relation to substances. Being, then,\nis analogous to substance and accident: it is primarily predicated of\nsubstances and secondarily predicated of accidents.
