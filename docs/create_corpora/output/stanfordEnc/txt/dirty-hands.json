This question poses what has become known amongst\nphilosophers as the problem of dirty hands. There are many different\nstrands to the philosophical debate about this topic, and they echo\nmany of the complexities in more popular thinking about politics and\nmorality. All, however, involve the idea that correct political action\nmust sometimes conflict with profound moral norms. This entry seeks to\nunravel these strands and clarify the central normative issues about\npolitics that the cry of ‘dirty hands’ evokes. Beginning\nwith an illustrative passage from a renowned 19th century\nEnglish novel, the essay traces the dirty hands tradition back to\nMachiavelli, though its present vogue is owed mostly to the writings\nof the distinguished American political theorist, Michael Walzer.\nWalzer’s views are explored in the light of earlier theorists such as\nMachiavelli and Max Weber and certain vacillations in his intellectual\nposture are briefly discussed. This leads to the posing of five issues\nwith which the entry is principally concerned. First, is the dirty\nhands problem simply confused and its formulation the merest\ncontradiction? Second, does the overriding of moral constraints take\nplace within morality or somehow beyond it? Third, can the cry of\ndirty hands be restricted wholly or principally to politics or does it\nspeak equally to other areas of life, and, where politics is\nconcerned, do only the principal agents get dirty hands or do their\ncitizens share in the taint? This is the problem of scope. Fourth, how\nare the circumstances that call for dirty hands best described?\nFifth, the dirty hands problem has affinities with the problem raised\nby moral dilemmas, but the question is: should those similarities be\nallowed to obscure significant differences?\n\n\n\nIn the course of addressing these issues, the dirty hands challenge is\nalso distinguished from that of political realism, with which it has\nsome affinities, and the resort to role morality to render dirty hands\ncoherent is discussed, as is the issue of the desirability of shaming\nor punishing dirty hands agents. The relevance of “threshold\ndeontology” is explored, and it is suggested that much of the\npoint of invoking dirty hands comes from an ambiguous attitude to\nabsolute moral prohibitions, combining a rejection of them with a\ncertain wistful attachment to their flavour.\n\n\n\nAnthony Trollope’s novel, The Way We Live Now, is a\nbiting critique of the corruption of late Victorian morals. One of its\ncentral characters, the shallow Lady Carbury, at one point voices her\nconviction that the praiseworthy deeds of the powerful escape the\nnormal categories of morality. Commenting on the character of the\nnovel’s dominant figure, the grand swindler Melmotte, she says to\nher journalist friend Mr. Booker: \n\n“If a thing can be made great and beneficent, a boon to\nhumanity, simply by creating a belief in it, does not a man become a\nbenefactor to his race by creating that belief?” \n\n“At the expense of veracity?” suggested Mr. Booker. \n\n“At the expense of anything?” rejoined Lady Carbury with\nenergy. “One cannot measure such men by the ordinary\nrule.” \n\n“You would do evil to produce good?” asked Mr.\nBooker. \n\n“I do not call it doing evil….You tell me this man may\nperhaps ruin hundreds, but then again he may create a new world in\nwhich millions will be rich and happy.” \n\n“You are an excellent casuist, Lady Carbury.” \n\n“I am an enthusiastic lover of beneficent audacity,”\nsaid Lady Carbury… \n\nContemporary moral and political philosophy suffers from no lack of\nenthusiastic admirers of “beneficent audacity”. At one end\nof a spectrum are those consequentialists who are so captivated by the\nprospect of the new world of “happy millions” that they\nthink it obscurantist to object to any evil means needed to achieve\nit—indeed, they agree with Lady Carbury in not calling such\nmeans evil. At the other end of that spectrum, stand the rather more\nreluctant advocates of “dirty hands” who think that some\nvery good ends, such as the aversion of catastrophe, require the doing\nof evil, but unlike Lady Carbury, they insist on calling it evil,\nthough necessary evil. And like Lady Carbury, they rather think that\nthe agents who so dirty their hands cannot be measured “by the\nordinary rule.” Even so, like W.H. Auden in his poem\n“Spain”, they think such agents doing what current\ncircumstances make “necessary” should accept the guilt\nthat their immoral actions earn. As Auden puts it: \n“To-day the deliberate increase in the chances of death,\nThe conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder.” \n\nThe dirty hands tradition dates back to Machiavelli, though its\npresent currency is largely owed to the American political theorist\nMichael Walzer who gave it the title of dirty hands in an influential\narticle “Political Action: the Problem of Dirty Hands”, in\nwhich he coined the term “dirty hands” adapting it from\nJean Paul Sartre’s play of the same name (Walzer 1973).  Later, Walzer\nused the idea, though not the term, in his book Just and Unjust\nWars (1977) in which he argued that an appeal to “supreme\nemergency” could not only explain but justify the Allied terror\nbombing of German cities in the early stages of World War II (Walzer\n1977a, 267–68). For these early stages, roughly (it seems, for Walzer\ngives no date) up to the end of 1941, the deliberate massacre of\nthousands of German non-combatants was required by supreme emergency,\neven though it was gravely immoral. The prospect and likelihood of a\nNazi victory were so dire for the lives and communal values of those\nfacing defeat that the price of severe immorality was worth paying. In\nthe subsequent conduct of the war, Walzer argued, the city bombings\nwere simply immoral (as were the city bombings of Japan, including the\natomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and could not be justified\nby supreme\n emergency.[1]\nWhen Walzer later revisited the\ntopic of supreme emergency, he made it clear that it was a case of\ndirty hands, indeed he seems to have come to the view that\nonly something like the circumstances of supreme emergency\ncould provide a dirty hands justification. So he says, in the later\ndiscussion of supreme emergency, that the doctrine of dirty hands is\nthat “according to which political and military leaders may\nsometimes find themselves in situations where they cannot avoid acting\nimmorally, even when that means deliberately killing the\ninnocent.” And again: “…dirty hands aren’t\npermissible (or necessary) when anything less than the ongoingness of\nthe community is at stake, or when the danger that we face is anything\nless than communal death” (Walzer 2004a, 46). \n\nThe first thing to notice about this is that the identification of\nsupreme emergency and dirty hands represents a dramatic shift from\nWalzer’s view in his original article, and this shift reflects a\nsignificant ambiguity in the dirty hands tradition. Walzer’s\naccounts of supreme emergency vary somewhat in the treatments in\nJust and Unjust Wars and in the later article,\n“Emergency Ethics” (and we shall attend to this later) but\nin both accounts the necessity to override deep moral constraints only\narises in conditions approaching catastrophe. In the original 1973\npaper, however, the trigger for dirty hands is nowhere near as\nextreme. One example there, with intriguing contemporary\nrelevance, concerned a political leader’s need to torture a\nsuspected terrorist in the hope of preventing the likely killing of\nhundreds of innocent people. This falls well short of the criterion of\nsupreme emergency in Walzer’s later writings where the trigger is\nthe devastation of whole peoples and/or their ways of life. Moreover,\nWalzer’s other example in the original paper was of a good\ndemocratic politician bribing a corrupt ward boss to deliver him votes\nwith the promise of improperly delivered school construction contracts.\nHere not only is the moral violation much less profound than in the\nformer case, but the emergency could hardly be considered\n“supreme” in any sense even if we allow that the votes are\nneeded to win an important election and that the politician is\ngenuinely motivated to do good when elected. In Walzer’s initial\ntreatment, there is also some ambiguity in the use of the term\n“dirty hands” since he sometimes uses it for any\nconspicuous immorality as well as the more interesting and technical\nsense we are concerned with. So he says “It is easy to get\none’s hands dirty in politics and it is often right to do\nso” (Walzer 1973, 174). The first clause seems to point to the\nwidespread temptation to resort to immorality where the second\nindicates that it isn’t always right to do so, hence demarcating\na positive normative sense of “dirty” from a merely\ndescriptive sense. The use of “often” shows the more\nconcessive attitude to the scope of dirty hands in contrast to\nWalzer’s later view. \n\nEarlier writers concerned with the need for politicians to dirty their\nhands with immoral behaviour show some of this vacillation, sometimes\nstressing the extreme stakes that are involved, but more often\nappearing to view the political process generally as above morality,\nor at least operating with a different morality. (“One cannot\nmeasure such men by the ordinary rule”). John M. Parrish in an\ninteresting and far-ranging book (Parrish, 2007) shows that there are\nelements of the concern about the generally challenging nature of\npolitics for morality as early as\nPlato’s Republic. Parrish’s understanding,\nhowever, of what constitutes dirty hands is often so broad as to\nobscure some of the distinctions, ambiguities and problems arising\nfrom current philosophical discussions. to be fair, he is interested\nin charting a sort of pre-history to the contemporary debate, and\nadmits that “the problem may have changed over time” so\nthat there is “a succession of dirty hands problems”\n(Parrish, p. 18). Even so, some of the apparently morally troubling\nexamples he discusses from ancient intellectual sources have none of\nthe marks of the contemporary problem. Augustine’s insistence,\nfor example, that even a justly waged war is morally regrettable is\naccompanied by the untroubled argument that the warrior whose cause\nand intention is just does not sin at all (i.e., violate any moral\nobligation) in killing his enemy. Parrish’ emphasis on the idea\nthat political life is pervasively morally problematic, however, does\nfind echoes in early modern treatments that foreshadow the\ncontemporary dirty hands discussion. One such influential treatment is\nthat of Machiavelli. So Machiavelli thinks that the ordinary processes\nof politics require that the Prince “must learn how not to be\ngood”, though he should maintain the appearance of virtue and\nindeed behave virtuously when the cost is low (Machiavelli 1513,\n52). Max Weber stresses the way that regard for consequences must\ndominate the thinking of the politician as contrasted with ordinary or\nreligiously inspired ethics. This contrast lies behind the opposition\nWeber discerns in “Politics as Vocation” between “an\nethic of responsibility” and “an ethic of ultimate\nends”. Although the terms in which Weber frames the contrast\ntend to confuse rather than clarify the issues, it is probable that\none thing he has in mind for the “ultimate ends” side of\nthe conflict is an ethic involving absolute prohibitions; he sees\nthese as being in tension with an outlook geared to counting\nconsequences. As Weber puts it: “there is an abysmal contrast\nbetween conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of ultimate\nends-that is, in religious terms, ‘the Christian does rightly\nand leaves the results with the Lord’-and conduct that follows\nthe maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give\nan account of the foreseeable results of one’s action”\n(Weber 1919, 120). The starkness of this contrast is one source of\nconfusion since, as we shall see later, absolutists are not totally\nindifferent to consequences — not all their ethic consists of\nabsolute prohibitions-and non-absolutists need not be obsessed only\nwith consequences. But Weber is adamant that it is impossible in\npolitics to adhere generally to any absolutist ethic of ultimate ends,\nlargely because of what he sees as the central role of violence in\npolitics. In spite of Walzer citing him approvingly (up to a point) in\nhis original article, Weber does not seem to hold anything like\nWalzer’s mature view. He does not think that an ethic of\nultimate ends suffices most of the time, but gives way in conditions\nof supreme emergency; rather his view appears to be that the ultimate\nends ethic is quite generally inadequate to politics. In fact,\nWeber’s belief that violence is central to the operation of\npolitics is exaggerated, though understandable in the circumstances in\nwhich he wrote, but if it were true it might give his position more\naffinity with Walzer’s idea of supreme emergency. The difference\nwould remain that, although violence may well be a factor in\nestablishing supreme emergency, Walzer’s mature understanding of\nsupreme emergency requires more than simply incursions of\nviolence. \n\nThis ambiguity about the extent of the need for dirty hands is\nreflected in much of the literature on the topic. Numerous writers\nhave followed early Walzer (and some elements in both Machiavelli’s\nand Weber’s treatment of political morality) in regarding politics as\na zone in which, to quote Neil Levy, “dirty actions are part and\nparcel of ordinary political life”. Levy adds:\n“Politicians must make deals, compromise with interests they\nabhor, distribute favours and neglect relationships” (Levy 2007,\n52–3, endnote 26). A number of these things are no doubt regrettable\nor distasteful in varying degrees, but whether they are immoral\ndepends on what the deals are, what the favours involve, how deep the\ncompromise runs, and how damaging the neglect is (and to what sort of\nrelationship). Much of what various writers regard as the need for\ndirty hands in politics is dubiously an issue of immorality at all. In\norder to maintain power and get important work done, a politician may\nhave to appoint a member of a party in coalition with his own to an\nimportant Ministry ahead of a trusted colleague in his own party who\nhas better credentials for the job. This is disappointing and painful\nto him and his colleague and clearly less than ideal (even though the\nappointee is, we may suppose, competent enough) but I do not think the\nact can be seen as immoral. To call it morally disagreeable is to\nsignal the fact that certain valuable relations and ends are put under\nstrain by it, but it is clearly not is the same league as torture,\nmurder, or gross deceit.   \n\nBernard Williams does indeed distinguish levels of gravity in the\nsinning required of politicians in his exploration of the scope of\ndirty hands, but he also suggests that the politician’s necessary\nimmoralities are very common and distinctive. He distinguishes between\nthe morally “disagreeable or distasteful” and the morally\ncriminal, the latter being subsumed under a broad category of what he\ncalls “violence” (Williams 1978, 71). Although Williams\nallows that some political actions that are popularly believed to be\nmorally dubious, may well be morally acceptable when circumstances are\nproperly understood, he casts a pretty wide net for the morally\ndisagreeable. It involves such things as “lying, or at least\nconcealment and the making of misleading statements; breaking\npromises; special pleading; temporary coalition with the distasteful;\nsacrifice of the interests of worthy persons to those of unworthy\npersons; and (at least if in a sufficiently important position)\ncoercion up to blackmail” (Williams 1978, 59). Yet it is\nunlikely that all of these, as so generally described, are morally\nwrong in all circumstances. True, some philosophers have held as much\nfor some of these—Augustine, Aquinas and Kant for lying, and\nKant for promising—but surely lying is acceptable in extreme\ncircumstances such as the need to protect an innocent person from a\nmurderer, and even coercion (depending on the definition) isn’t always\nmorally wrong, witness the coercive detention of people reasonably\nsuspected of contagious disease that they are unaware of. It seems\nthat most, if not all the things Williams mentions are in the category\n“normally morally wrong but morally permissible in certain\ncircumstances”. Even blackmail might be in this category since\nblackmailing a vicious criminal in order to secure the freedom of his\nvictim might (perhaps depending on the kind of blackmail) be morally\npermissible. Notions like regret or remorse are sometimes invoked to\nshow that what had to be done was nonetheless immoral, but apart from\nthe fact that an act such as the blackmail of a vicious criminal need\nnot even be regrettable, there are many things one can rightly regret\nhaving to do that are not immoral, for example, punishing a child by\nwithdrawing privileges. Remorse strikes a stronger, more moralised\nnote, but for that very reason one should be careful not to confuse it\nwith various feelings of discomfort, regret or sorrow for having to do\ncertain things. Further investigation of the nature and appropriate\nconditions for remorse is interesting and difficult, but beyond the\nscope of this discussion, and its role as a criterion of dirty hands\nseems at best inconclusive. \n\nThe idea that dirty hands (in contrast to sheer bad behaviour and\ncorrupt activity) are commonplace in politics is highly dubious, but\njust how extensive the reach of this phenomenon is in politics is\ndifficult to determine, and would be best considered on a case by\ncase, or perhaps category by category, fashion. Clearly, the most\nobvious, and I think the most interesting category is that described\nby Williams with the term “violence” (though that has the\ncontentious, and I think unfortunate implication that all violence is\nimmoral). This covers the acts that Walzer’s later argument seeks to\ncapture with his term “supreme emergency”. His terminology\nand his later practice make the scope of dirty hands pretty\nrestricted, perhaps more so than Williams intended, but I will follow\nhis example and focus on really grave injustices like murder, torture,\nrape or slavery that are said to be warranted in conditions of extreme\nemergency.  \n\nFirst, however, it is worth noting that enthusiasm to detect the sway\nof dirty hands can lead to misdescription of some complex, disturbing\nmoral situations. An interesting example of this has been explored by\nJennifer Rubenstein in connection with problems facing International\nNGOs providing aid in emergency situations such as the refugee camps\nin the Congo. INGO agents have found that their provision of food and\nmedicine is often exploited by warring factions within refugee camps\nand elsewhere (see also some of Fiona Terry’s discussion and examples\nin Terry 2002). This confronts them with often agonising decisions\nabout whether to cease aid and leave the areas of distress because of\nthe harm this exploitation generates, including continuation of\nviolent conflict. If they leave they abandon suffering people, but if\nthey stay, then they contribute unintentionally to great harms that\nothers inflict on innocent people. Such problems are often described\nwith the vocabulary of “dirty hands”, but, as Rubenstein\nargues, this description is misplaced since, for one thing, the aid\nagencies do not themselves intentionally do harm to avoid some great\nevil or achieve some great good. Rubenstein proposes a category of\n“spattered hands” to describe these situations in order to\nemphasise that the soiling is contributed by the actions of others\n(Rubenstein 2014, Chapter 4). We cannot examine the adequacy of her\nnew category here, but she seems right that the examples are\nmisdescribed as dirty hands.  \nIt will be apparent from all this that the dirty hands problem needs\ninitially some conceptual clarification; this should proceed with a\nview to five issues. First, there is the question whether the dirty\nhands scenario makes any sense at all; perhaps it is just a muddle.\nSecond, there is the related question whether the overriding that dirty\nhands involve (or purport to involve) takes place within morality or\nsomehow beyond it. Third, there is the question whether dirty hands are\nnecessitated only or primarily by politics. Fourth, how are the\ncircumstances that call for dirty hands best described? Fifth, there is\nthe issue of the relation of the dirty hands problem to that of moral\ndilemmas and the requirements of some form of moral absolutism. \nLet us examine these in turn. The structure of dirty hands is such that\nit seems to involve a contradiction or paradox. The advocate of dirty\nhands says in effect that it is sometimes right to do what is wrong,\nand this seems tantamount to saying that some act is both wrong and not\nwrong. But the dirty hands theorist is not saying that it is wrong in\nsome respects and right in others, nor that what would normally be\nwrong is here right. Rather, it is the whole act in context that is\nboth categorically wrong and not wrong. In the dirty hands scenario we\nare asked to believe that doing X is morally wrong and yet it\nis palpably right to do it. As Walzer has more recently written of his\nown position, it is both “provocative and paradoxical”\n(Walzer 2004a, 33). Kai Nielson has urged the point even more\nstrongly, but something of the sort has puzzled many who contemplate\nthe problem. The category of dirty hands, as described by Walzer and\nsome others is, according to Nielson “a conceptual confusion with\nunfortunate moral residues” (Nielson 2000, 140). Clearly\nsuch a dismissal would come naturally to a utilitarian or most\nconsequentialists who would simply declare the dirty hands decision to\nbe one in which a right act (that producing the best consequences in\nterms of preference satisfactions, overall increase in happiness or\nwhatever) has been done though it may have been distressing to do it.\nNielson disavows utilitarianism and calls himself a “weak\nconsequentialist” but the upshot is much the same. He thinks that\ndirty hands situations confront an agent with a choice of two evils and\nthe agent should always choose the lesser evil. No doubt, in acting\nagainst what in other circumstances is a deep moral constraint, the\nagent will experience distress; she will “feel guilty” but\nfeeling guilty is not to be confused with being guilty (Nielson 2000,\n140). \nFrom the opposite direction the problem can also be resolved by the\ndenial that the hands should become dirty. An insistence on the\ninviolability of some moral prescriptions makes the paradox disappear\nas neatly as the Nielson manoeuvre. If we hold to the prohibition on\nintentionally killing the innocent, for example, in the face of crises\nlike that supposed by Walzer to necessitate the bombing of German\ncities in the early phase of World War II, then there are no dirty\nhands to have. Such a position is often called absolutist. Absolutist\npositions have been explicitly held by many philosophers, notably\nAugustine, Aquinas, and Kant, and implicitly perhaps by many more. The\nposition involves complexities that we will examine later. \n\nBoth these responses agree in holding that moral reasons rightly\ndominate all others. Another way of defusing the strong appearance of\ncontradiction is to hold that morality is not the only legitimate\ndeterminant of right action and that some other determinant may\noccasionally properly trump it. This provides one answer to the second\npoint of clarification mentioned earlier. Dirty hands problems do not\narise within morality but rather when morality clashes with\nsome other rational necessity of a profound kind that correctly\noverrules\n it.[2]\nThe overruling must inspire regret,\npossibly remorse, but it is nonetheless clear that the overruling is in\norder, indeed required. Here, it is important to acknowledge that the\noverruling in question is not merely a description of what often\nhappens. It is common knowledge that the demands of morality are often\nenough overridden by other persuasive demands, such as imperatives of\nself-interest, careerism, political advantage and friendship. It may\neven be that politics is an arena in which such overpowering happens\nmore commonly than elsewhere, so that participation in it is fraught\nwith moral hazard that requires an exceptional moral character to\novercome. Nonetheless, the importance and challenge of the dirty hands\nscenario is not that hands get dirty from time to time, but that it is\nright that they do so. \nIf we allow that non-moral “oughts” can sometimes trump\nmoral ones then the dirty hands position may be restated as holding\nthat, in circumstances of extremity, reasons of “necessity”\n(or whatever) defeat important moral reasons. This seems to be one\nplausible construal of Machiavelli when he talks of the necessity that\nrulers must learn how not to be good. Of course, he has the model of\nChristian morality in mind when he calls for its overriding and so may\nbe understood as opposing one form of morality to another, but a good\ndeal of his discussion can be treated as elevating “reasons of\nstate” above morality. This is a rejection of the idea that moral\nreasons dominate all other reasons. \nIt may be useful here to distinguish between dominance and\ncomprehensiveness. Most moral theorists hold that morality is both\ncomprehensive and dominant, that is, it relevant to all decisions and\nwhere relevant it defeats all other reasons. One could however hold\nthat morality is comprehensive but not dominant, or dominant but not\ncomprehensive, or indeed neither dominant nor comprehensive. Our\npresent inquiry is concerned with the first two options. The ideas of\ndominance and comprehensiveness express somewhat different pictures of\nthe status of morality, though an exalted understanding of morality\noften draws on both. Morality’s dominance would consist in its\ntrumping all other considerations whenever it is relevant to them,\nwhereas morality’s comprehensiveness consists in its being\nuniversally relevant whether it trumps other considerations or not. On\nthe present interpretation, dirty hands theorists accept\nmorality’s comprehensiveness (at least with respect to the\ndomains they are concerned with) but reluctantly reject its dominance\nfor one class of decisions. \nWe might usefully contrast this with the position of the school of\nthinkers called “political realists” whose outlook has some\naffinity with the dirty hands theorists to the point that the two are\nsometimes confused. Realists are often viewed (and often present\nthemselves) as rejecting the comprehensive relevance of morality by\nreference to something special about politics or international\nrelations. So we find E.H. Carr stating as “the realist\nview” that “no ethical standards are applicable to\nrelations between states…” (Carr 1962, 153). Other realists\ncome close to this, though their views are clouded by uncertainties\nabout morality’s provenance (as indeed are Carr’s). Arthur\nSchlesinger Jr., for instance, claims: “The raw material of\nforeign affairs is, most of the time, morally neutral or ambiguous. In\nconsequence, for the great majority of foreign-policy transactions,\nmoral principles cannot be decisive” (Schlesinger 1971,\n73).The influential American realist, Hans Morgenthau, is anxious\nto separate politics from morality by maintaining “the autonomy\nof the political sphere.” He recognises the autonomy of other\nspheres such as economics, law and morality, but insists that the\npolitical realist must “subordinate these other standards to\nthose of politics” (Morgenthau 2006, 13). Here, he echoes\nthe position of the German conservative thinker Carl Schmitt by whom he\nwas clearly influenced. Schmitt became embroiled with the Nazi Party in\nthe 1930s and enjoyed (if that is the word) some fame for a time as a\ntheoretician for the Nazi cause. These quotations all suggest the idea\nthat politics, or some significant area of it, such as international\nrelations, falls quite outside the provenance of morality, thus denying\nmorality comprehensiveness, though the reference to morality’s\nfailure to be “decisive” hints at a denial of\ndominance. There are many obscurities in the stance of political\nrealism, and this is not the place to unravel them, but in spite of the\nambiguities in pronouncements of the leading theorists in the school,\nand in spite of some continuity between their outlook on politics and\nthat of the dirty hands theorists, it is clear that the realist’s\nattitude to morality usually has quite a different flavour to that of\nthe dirty hands\n theorists.[3]\nPart of this is captured by the\ndifference between the denials of comprehensiveness and dominance, and\nthis connects with the fact that when realists reject moral\nconsiderations they do so with no deep sense of regret or remorse for\nhaving done what is morally wrong. \nThe denial of dominance preserves a certain coherence for morality\nsince it is not, as it were, at odds with itself; it is at times and in\ncontext at odds with something else which, following both Machiavelli\nand Walzer, might be called “necessity”. But what is this\nnecessity? Clearly, it is not meant to be some form of deterministic\nnecessity, since it would have been possible for the British leadership\nin World War II to have rejected the policy of city bombing outright,\nas their declared policy prior to the war had indicated they would do,\na policy that their initial bombing practices indeed\n respected.[4]\nYet\nthere is a trace of this deterministic thought in the idea of supreme\nemergency with its implication of something that overwhelms the normal\npower of morality. We might recall in this connection Thomas\nHobbes’s argument that moral dictates cannot apply when they\nwould lead to self-destruction. Hobbes’s idea is that the\nrationality of self-preservation, which itself gives rise to morality,\nmakes acting on morality null and void when acting on it would defy\nself-preservation. As Hobbes puts it: “The laws of nature oblige\nin foro interno; that is to say, they bind to a desire that\nthey should take place: but in foro externo: this is to the\nputting of them in act, not always. For he that should be modest, and\ntractable, and perform all he promises, in such time, and place, where\nno man else should do so, should but make himself a prey to others, and\nprocure his own certain ruin, contrary to the ground of all laws of\nnature, which tend to nature’s preservation” (Leviathan,\nCh. XV, p. 99). \nHobbes certainly does paint a totally isolated scenario for the person\nwho would obey the moral law—“where no man else should do\nso”—and one might wonder whether the institution of\npromising could even exist in so bleakly uncooperative “time and\nplace” as he supposes. But presumably a sufficient number of\nnon-cooperators would serve to make one “a prey to others”\nand procure “certain ruin”, and it is the necessity of\navoiding some such ruin that motivates the supreme emergency story,\neven though it is collective rather than individual ruin that lies at\nits heart. Hobbes’s exemption from the need to practice morality\n(rather than desire its operation) makes most sense on a contractarian\nview of morality or in connection with those moral obligations that are\ndependent upon agreement (even if other obligations are not). In a\nworld in which hardly anyone kept their promises or adhered to their\ncontracts, the sense of such commitments would dissipate and entering\ninto what shell remained of them might be folly indeed, and very likely\nfutile as well. But many other areas of morality are not like this, and\nso even where adherence to moral imperatives may be perilous in the\nextreme, it may not be the folly that Hobbes’s comments make it\nseem. One woman who survived Belsen, Hanna Levy-Haas, records in her\ndiary a philosophical debate she had in the camp with a fellow Marxist,\nProfessor K who argued the somewhat Hobbesian case (embellished with\nMarxist terminology) that morality did not apply in the camps because\nit was superseded by the survival imperative. She rejected his argument\nbecause it required her “simply to compromise with the enemy, to\nbetray one’s principles, to deny spiritual values in the\ninterests of saving one’s skin” (Levy-Haas 1982, 65).\nThese comments indicate at the very least that the idea of “total\nruin” is open to interpretations that see the abandonment or\ndegrading of moral integrity as itself a primary ingredient in such\nruin. \nThis excursion into the world of the Leviathan nonetheless helps give\nsome sense to the idea that the practice of morality might be suspended\nfor a time and hence morality itself moved aside by an external\nnecessity. It thus helps show a way that the dirty hands story might be\nredeemed from incoherence, even if the idea that morality should\nsometimes be dominated by an external necessity proves unacceptable.\nThe dirty hands position might then be coherent but false. So Hanna\nLevy-Haas could understand the Professor’s argument, but found\nreason to reject it. \n\nAnother route out of paradox would be to hold that the clash\ndepicted by dirty hands theorists occurs within morality. Here, the\nidea might be that morality itself is not entirely coherent or\nself-consistent. In certain extreme circumstances, one powerful strand\nin morality comes into conflict with another. Even more clearly,\nWeber’s distinction between the ethics of ultimate ends and that\nof responsibility points in this direction. His idea is expressed\nsomewhat opaquely, but he seems to be claiming that there are two\nstrands in morality, or two types of morality, such that one may be\napplicable to ordinary life, but must yield to the other in matters\npolitical, especially those that involve difficult choices in a context\nof violence. Several passages in Walzer’s discussion tend in this\ndirection. He holds that a morality of rights and a morality of\nconsequences or utility co-exist in our moral outlook in such a way\nthat although rights trump utility in normal circumstances, a\n“utilitarianism of extremity” rightly overrides the\nmorality of rights in some rare circumstances. As he puts it: in a\nsituation of supreme emergency, “a certain kind of utilitarianism\nreimposes itself”, this being “the utilitarianism of\nextremity” set against “a rights normality” (Walzer\n2004a, 40). \nThis contrast between a rights ethic (or other deontological ethic) and\nutilitarianism is one way of locating the clash within morality itself.\nAnother way is by having recourse to role morality: within morality\nitself there are general moral principles, rules etc. and then special\nmoral requirements dictated by significant social roles. These can come\ninto conflict, as when the lawyer’s obligation to provide her\nclient with the best defence and to preserve confidentiality can\nconflict with the demands of impartial justice. So it might be argued\nthat the political role has obligations and rights special to it that\noverride more general moral obligations and rights. When it comes to\nthe immensely important role of political leadership, we “cannot\nmeasure such men by the ordinary rule” as Lady Carbury puts it.\nThis manoeuvre has the advantage of capturing something important in\nthe dirty hands literature (and it is also present in the realist\nliterature), namely, the emphasis on the special moral significance of\nthe role of political leadership. Walzer, for instance, places great\nweight upon “what political leaders are for.” Talking\nof political and military leaders, he says, “The effect of the\nsupreme emergency arguments should be to reinforce professional\nethics, and to provide an account of when it is permissible (and\nnecessary) to get our hands dirty” (Walzer 2004a, 42). An\ninitial problem with this sort of move is that the special duties and\nrights of social roles are underpinned by general moral considerations\nsince it is only those roles that can be morally supported by quite\ngeneral moral considerations that will have a role morality. We may\ndescribe the code of the Mafia thug as the morality of his role, but\nusually it is mores rather morality being described. Even if it is a\nrequirement of his role that a Mafia hit-man must murder anyone who\nsnitches to the police, this is hardly a moral imperative of any sort.\nAnd where there are genuine moral duties to a role, and they are\nendorsed by broader moral considerations, we do not believe that this\nendorsement cannot itself be overruled by other general moral\nobligations. The requirements of professional confidentiality, for\ninstance, can be so overridden, as when medical confidentiality\nregarding a doctor-patient communication stands in the way of saving a\nlife. The famous Tarasof case is instructive in this respect. It\nconcerned a counsellor at the University of California at Berkeley who\nlearned from his client that he planned to kill his ex-girl friend. The\ncounsellor was sufficiently worried that he broke confidentiality to\ntell the police who investigated but took no further action. The girl\nfriend (Tarasof) was duly murdered by the client, and a court later\nheld that the counsellor should have gone further and notified Tarasof\nor her family of the\n danger.[5]\nOther courts have been less\ndemanding, but there is a general recognition that the professional\nduty of client confidentiality can be overridden by more pressing moral\ndemands. \n\nIndeed, the structure of the role morality defence of the dirty hands\nstory provides a curious inversion of the role morality logic since\nthat logic requires that emergency situations allow or even demand the\noverturning of the role duties by the more general demands of a deeper\nmorality. By contrast, the dirty hands scenario requires the role\nmorality to triumph over the deeper moral outlook that gives sense to\nthe morality of role itself. Here we find yet another paradox\ngenerated by the dirty hands category. It could only be resolved by\nthe insistence that the political role is unique among roles since in\nits case its moral power somehow transcends the general morality. (Or,\nif the dirty hands scenario applies beyond the political, it will be\none of a small set of roles that is unique.) In fact, there is a\nstrong strand of this political exceptionism inherent in the dirty\nhands story. Yet how could the political role have such a status? We\nmight expect such an exaltation of the role from one such as Schmitt,\nbut in fact Walzer himself is drawn to it. Walzer’s position has been\ncited as treating the dirty hands conflict as involving a clash\nbetween a rights ethic and a utilitarianism of extremity, but the\nfollowing quote puts his position much more in the role morality\narena. He says in his later treatment: “No government can put\nthe life of the community and all its members at risk, so long as\nthere are actions available to it, even immoral actions, that would\navoid or reduce the risk….That is what political leaders are\nfor; that is their first task” (Walzer 2004a, 42). Furthermore,\nthe significance of this task is cashed out in terms of the supreme\nvalue of the specific “moral community” to which the\npolitical leader belongs. The leader’s obligations will involve\ncalculations of utility, but, in extremis, his or her ultimate\nresponsibility to that community trumps universalist utilitarian\ncalculations as well as specific deontological constraints. When the\n“ongoingness” of a community’s way of life is threatened\nthen the prospect is that of “a loss greater than any that can\nbe imagined, except for the destruction of humanity itself”\n(Walzer 2004a, 43). These claims, if true, would certainly establish a\npre-eminent, if not unique, significance for the political role, so\nthey need close examination. \n\nWalzer’s two quotes stress significantly different values that\nhe has a tendency to conflate. The first is that of life itself for all\nmembers of the community, the second that of the continuity of a\n“way of life”. Survival is at issue in both cases but the\nsignificance and weight that each survival should have is surely very\ndifferent. The prospect of universal massacre understandably puts\nstress upon anything constraining the scope of actions to prevent it,\nbut the prospect of forced alterations, set-backs or radical changes to\na way of life must be less threatening. Even a relatively benign\nforeign occupation may involve extensive and very regrettable changes\nto the way of life of the occupied community perhaps in the form of\nrestrictions on traditional freedoms, such as those of political speech\nor religious expression, and a degraded position of citizenship\nvis-a-vis the occupiers. Yet throughout history modified life styles\nhave evolved for such communities that make for the possibility of at\nleast coping and even some flourishing. It is not at all obvious that\nslaughtering innocent people is justified in order to avoid such an\noutcome, or even outcomes notably worse on the same scale. \nEven if dirty hands were permitted only to political communities facing\nextreme situations, it is not at all clear that the exemption should\nonly be available to political communities that have states. Walzer\ndoes not exactly say this, but his pro-state bias is evident in his\ndiscussion of supreme emergency in Just and Unjust Wars. Early\nin that discussion, he says, for instance, “Can soldiers and\nstatesmen override the rights of innocent people for the sake of their\nown political community? I am inclined to answer this question\naffirmatively, though not without hesitation and worry” (Walzer\n1977, 254). Further, in a different essay on terrorism, Walzer\nrejects arguments on behalf of terrorism by non-state agents that are\nvery similar to those that he accepts as legitimating the bombing of\nGerman cities. For example, he claims that the familiar terrorist\nexcuse that they had no alternative in the face of oppression is only\n“a pretence.” As he puts it: “‘Last\nresort’ has only a notional finality; the resort to terror is\nideologically last, not last in an actual series of actions, just last\nfor the sake of the excuse” (Walzer 2004b, 54). Yet no such\nscepticism is expressed about the no alternative and last resort\njustifications offered by governments who use terrorism in supreme\nemergency. \n\nBut political communities other than states may surely face supreme\nemergencies, even allowing for the difficulties in interpreting the\nconcept, so the way is open in principle for sub-state terrorism to be\njustified. This is a position that Walzer somewhat reluctantly seems\nnow (in a parenthesis to a later reprinting of the terrorism article)\nto concede, though it goes somewhat against the grain of the article\nitself. The parenthetical comments, published in 2004, are:\n“Would terrorism be justified in a ‘supreme\nemergency’ as that condition is described [by Walzer in the\nearlier chapter called ‘Emergency Ethics’]. It might be,\nbut only if the oppression to which the terrorists claimed to be\nresponding was genocidal in character” (Walzer 2004b, 54). There\nare difficulties in matching the complex meanings of\n“genocide” to Walzer’s communitarian account of\nsupreme emergency. For one thing, a Nazi victory would probably not\nhave meant genocide for the British community yet, according to Walzer,\nthey were facing supreme emergency. So, the sources of his differential\ntreatment of state and sub-state terrorism remain a puzzle. \n\nHe goes on to deny that any actual recent terrorism has\nbeen “a means for avoiding disaster” rather than merely a\n“reaching for political success” (Walzer 2004b, 54).  So\nthe supreme emergency/dirty hands exemption seems available, given\nsignificant qualifications concerning probability of success, for\nterrorists aiming to save a communal way of life. In a later paper\nagain, Walzer allows for exceptional cases in which sub-state\nterrorism might be excusable though not justifiable; he imagines as\nexcusable “a terrorist campaign by Jewish militants against\nGerman civilians in the 1940s—if attacks on civilians had been\nlikely (in fact they would have been highly unlikely) to stop the mass\nmurder of the Jews” (Walzer 2006, 7). The shift from justifiable\nin the earlier quotation to excusable in the later clearly needs more\nexplanation; Walzer seems hesitant, if not confused in his resort to\nthese categories. Nonetheless, on Walzer’s own grounds, there would\nseem to be a case, given some likelihood of success, for the\nemployment of terrorism by Palestinian groups seeking to salvage what\nremains of their community’s way of life from the ravages of Israeli\noccupation, settlement and military attack. It is perhaps pertinent to\nthis prospect that the Palestinians refer to their dispossession and\nongoing sufferings at the hands of Israel as “al-Nakba”:\nthe catastrophe. No doubt, their achieving that prospect would involve\nsome sort of “reaching for political success” but this\nhardly counts against its status as a response to supreme emergency.\nThe point here is not to make any particular claims about the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, but rather to stress the idea, noted\nearlier, that Walzer’s move to a criterion of genocide is puzzling as\nthe sole interpretation of what a threat to the continuity of a\ncommunal way of life could mean.\n \nWalzer’s tendency to run together the categories of excuse and\njustification needs some comment because it is symptomatic of the\ntensions inherent in the dirty hands scenario. He realises in the 1973\narticle that it is important to distinguish them. Citing J.L. Austin,\nWalzer remarks that “the two can seem to come very close\ntogether…but they are conceptually distinct…an excuse is\ntypically an admission of fault; a justification is typically a denial\nof fault and an assertion of innocence” (Walzer 1973, 170;\nWalzer 1974, 72). Yet dirty hands acts involve both an admission of\nfault and a justification. This tends to collapse the distinction\nsince what is justified needs no excuse and the unjustifiable is\nsometimes excusable. Walzer’s discussion for the most part clearly\ntreats the dirty hands decisions as justified in some sense, whatever\nis said about its role as excuse. It is notable that at least one\ncommentator, Tamar Meisels, explicitly rejects the account in terms of\njustification in her discussion of terrorism and torture but she\naccepts dirty hands as providing grounds for excuse (Meisels 2008a,\n213–221). Yet not only is this an unlikely interpretation of the\ntradition, but it renders the category of dirty hands far less\ninteresting philosophically and ethically.\n \n\nThe discussion of the importance and extent of political community\nleads naturally to the question whether the need for dirty hands can be\nrestricted to the political sphere. If hands must be dirtied to avoid\nwidespread massacre, on the one hand, or damage to the\nmoral-cum-political continuity of a community’s way of life, then\nwhy not to avoid the unjustified killing of individuals or small groups\nor the drastic disruption of individual or small group’s way of\nliving. Why should the political community and the political role take\nsuch dramatic precedence over such significant groups as families and\ntheir associated roles? For that matter, why should it take precedence\nover the individual’s need for survival regardless of role? The\nanswer to this is not entirely clear. In Walzer’s discussion of\nsupreme emergency and the World War II city bombings, he confronts this\nquestion but his discussion is marked by what he himself calls\n“hesitation and worry”. It is also marked by appeals\nto what people are “likely to feel”, “what is not\nusually said” and similar phrases. He says: “…it is\nnot usually said of individuals in domestic society that they\nnecessarily will or that they morally can strike out at innocent\npeople, even in the supreme emergency of self-defense. They can only\nattack their attackers. But communities, in emergencies, seem to have\ndifferent and larger prerogatives. I am not sure that I can account for\nthe difference, without ascribing to communal life a kind of\ntranscendence that I don’t believe it to have” (Walzer\n1977, 254). Nor, he thinks, can it simply be a matter of the numbers.\nYet he persists with the superiority of the political community:\n“We might better say that it is possible to live in a world where\nindividuals are sometimes murdered, but a world where entire peoples\nare enslaved or massacred is literally unbearable. For the survival and\nfreedom of political communities—whose members share a way of\nlife, developed by their ancestors, to be passed on to their\nchildren—are the highest values of international society”\n(Walzer 1977, 254). Leaving aside the quibble that an individual facing\nmurder won’t find it possible to live on if she is actually\nmurdered when perhaps she refuses to kill the innocent in order to\nsurvive, we might question the sensitivity of ignoring the way any\nmurder victim’s close relatives find her death unbearable and the\nprospect of living on an agonising one. We might also wonder why\n“we” don’t find it unbearable to slaughter hundreds\nof thousands of innocent people to preserve the survival and freedom of\nour political communities. Nor is the reference to “the highest\nvalues of international society” particularly compelling. Where\n“international society” refers to the society of states, as\nWalzer seems often to mean, then it is not surprising that such states\nhold their survival as a pre-eminent value, but non-state agents may\nunderstandably have different priorities. A mother scrounging for the\nsurvival of her children in the desperate conditions of a third-world\nslum or primitive refugee camp may just as plausibly see herself coming\nunder what Walzer calls, in connection with political communities,\n“the rule of necessity (and necessity knows no rules)”\n(Walzer 1977, 254). \n\nIn his original article on dirty hands, Walzer allows in passing\nthat the phenomenon he is exploring might have a place beyond politics.\nSo, he says: “I don’t want to argue that it is only a\npolitical dilemma. No doubt we can get our hands dirty in private life\nalso, and sometimes, no doubt, we should. But the issue is posed most\ndramatically in politics…” (Walzer 1974, 76). This\nconcession has, however, little influence on his developed position\nwhich is focused wholly on extreme emergency in political contexts.\n(The original article is, after all, called, “Political Action:\nthe Problem of Dirty Hands”.) Other writers have been puzzled by\nthe heavy concentration on politics. Michael Stocker, for one, rejects\nthis restriction (Stocker 2000, 32–3).\nStocker also argues that the dirty hands phenomena, though distinctive\nin various ways, exhibit quite common features of moral conflicts more\ngenerally, and partly for this reason he thinks there is no logical\nincoherence in the dirty hands story. Stocker argues that what he calls\ndouble-counting, i.e., giving moral weight to impossible oughts, and\nallowing for non-action-guiding act evaluations, is a central feature\nof dirty hands, but is not restricted to them since they occur\n“across the board” of moral thinking and deciding. \n\nHowever it should be located, the phenomenon of dirty hands can be\neasily assimilated to that of moral dilemma, but this is an\nassimilation that should be resisted. Someone confronted with a\nsupreme emergency is indeed in what is often colloquially called\n“a moral dilemma” in the sense that she faces a disturbing\nand difficult choice situation, but that does not make it a moral\ndilemma in a philosophically interesting sense. In common parlance all\nsorts of situations that cause initial uncertainty and require hard\nmoral thinking to sort out are called moral dilemmas, as philosophers\nwho teach or consult on business ethics are fully aware. This usage is\nharmless enough, but the philosophical usage of the term points to a\nmore disturbing situation and one that needs to be distinguished from\ndirty hands. Both the categories of dirty hands and moral dilemma\ninvolve agonising choice in which there will be grave moral loss\neither way. The most salient difference between the categories is that\na moral dilemma arises only when the choice is such that neither horn\nis decisively supported by morality, indeed morality speaks equally\nagainst both. (There is a parallel dilemma for non-moral normative\ncontexts, if there be any, where normative reasons speak equally\nagainst doing p or doing not-p.) Whichever way the\nagent chooses, her action is unjustified and there is no question of\none course being more necessary or demanded than the other. By\ncontrast, the dirty hands choice is always dictated as the\n“necessary” course: in the context of political\nemergencies, the community defence always wins the day even over\ninnocent lives. This is the special feature that marks off dirty hands\nfrom moral dilemmas. \n\nA relatively unexplored question concerns whether anything more\ninformative than a reference to “emergency”, supreme or\notherwise, can be provided to illuminate the typical circumstances in\nwhich it is claimed that hands must be dirtied. One line of\nclarification that might be attempted would be to scrutinise more\ncarefully various broad situations in which moral action might be\nespecially under strain in political contexts. A first suggestion might\nbe that politics is essentially a zone of compromise, and it is the\npressure of compromise that creates the need for dirty hands. It is\ncertainly true that compromise is a pervasive feature of political\nlife, but compromise is hardly unique to politics, nor is it\nnecessarily a pressure for immoral conduct. Indeed, it is arguable that\nthe capacity to compromise is an essential moral ingredient in all\nsuccessful cooperative endeavours, since, apart from its instrumental\nvalue, it shows respect for other reasonable participants in public\naction. Nonetheless, compromise clearly has its morally dangerous side\nas indicated by our use of “compromised” to characterise\nsomeone whose principles have been sullied to an extent that makes them\nuntrustworthy. Since a compromise is a sort of bargain where parties\nsacrifice some good objectives in order to gain others, it raises a\nquestion about how far such deals can go, and this brings us into dirty\nhands territory. Another situation, related to our earlier discussion\nof Hobbes, is that of moral isolation. As noted there, the fact that\ngeneral adherence to morality has to a considerable degree broken down,\nmight not give as great a dispensation from moral constraints as Hobbes\nsupposes, but at least it poses starkly the rationale for compliance. A\nthird situation that seems relevant here and needs further exploration\nis that of extrication. Politicians, and others, often find themselves\nin situations where they have inherited, or are otherwise constrained\nby, the decisions and policies of others (or even their previous\nselves) that they now judge unwise or even gravely immoral. So, for\nexample, they may seek to end an unjust war to which their predecessors\nhave committed the nation, but immediate cessation and withdrawal may\nnot be desirable from several perspectives, including a moral point of\nview. They may very well think that the best extrication strategy\nrequires a temporary continuation of the war, unjust as it is, with a\nview to a withdrawal that better secures the rights of innocent people\nand makes the withdrawal politically possible. Obviously, what such\nsituations might allow in terms of continued immorality needs to be\nspelled out in more detail than space allows here, but equally, it\nseems clear that there is a potential for dirty hands discussion that\nmoves fruitfully beyond the often-vague generalities of\n“emergency” or “extremity”. \nThe discussion of extrication raises another point about dirty hands\nthat is seldom addressed. Dirty Hands scenarios are often constructed\nvery specifically as giving the agent narrow choices restricted by\nexternal circumstances over which she has no present control. The\nspecific scenario is often then generalised as though those external\ncircumstances, or ones very like them, are immutable for an agent with\nthat sort of background (e.g., a politician). This is, however,, too\nstatic and inflexible a view of moral contexts, roles and agent\ncapacities. In the extrication story above, the politician’s\n“necessary immorality” is forced upon her by the circumstances she has\ncreated or inherited, but the point of invoking extrication morality\nwithin the dirty hands problematic is to insist on possibilities of\ntemporary involvement in evil and the need to change the circumstances\nthat require such involvement. The ruler bent on extrication must\npersist in waging an unjust war only because at that time there is no\nother way that she can end the war by changing the context. But this\nrestriction should be seen here and in other dirty hands situations as\ncreating a moral imperative for the agent or others to change the\nbackground against which the moral crisis has arisen so that similar\nsituations are unlikely to recur. In the unjust war example, the\npolitician might use eventual success in ending the war to change\ncolonial or neo-colonial policies that fed the resort to war, to\nremove over-belligerent personnel from the defence establishment,\nrethink alliances that played a part in promoting the unjust war, and\nso on. Courage, imagination and luck may be needed to realise the\nrelevant possibilities, but without making efforts at relevant\nchanges, the agent’s appeal to necessity when invoking the dirty\nhands plea should ring hollow. \n\nMost of the discussion of dirty hands concentrates upon the situation\nof the individual political leader who must dirty his or her hands,\nbut another interesting question concerns the dirt on the hands of\ncitizens themselves when their leaders act thus on their behalf. This\nis particularly acute for democratic citizens to whom representative\ntheory applies more plausibly than to citizens of an autocracy. In\nWalzer’s original discussion, he insists that part of the tension,\neven agony, of the dirty hands problem arises from the fact that we,\nthe governed, want our leaders to be virtuous, but also want them to\nhave the sort of character that can act against deep moral principle\nwhen the supreme emergency arises. Of the politician who dirties his\nhands in a good cause but realises he is acting immorally, Walzer\nwrites: “Because he has scruples of this sort we know him to be\na good man. But we…hope that he will overcome his\nscruples…We know he is doing right when he makes the deal\nbecause he knows he is doing wrong” (Walzer 1973, 166; 1974,\n68). But if so, our endorsement would seem to have some implication for\nour own hands. This is not an implication that Walzer fully explores,\nthough he does say in the last sentence of his original article when\ndiscussing the need to penalise dirty hands that we can’t punish the\ndirty hands of the principal agents “without getting our own\nhands dirty, and then we must find some way of paying the price\nourselves” (Walzer 1973, 180; 1974, 82).   \n\nVarious other writers have however explored the implication, either\ndirectly or as part of the discussion of the supposed need to\n“punish” dirty hands (for this topic see below). Most\nrecently David Archard complains that “…there has been\nlittle discussion of the putative complicity, and thus also dirtying\nof hands, of a democratic public that authorizes politicians to act in\nits name” (Archard 2013, 777). Here he echoes an earlier\nposition taken by Martin Hollis and also similar claims made by Dennis\nThompson. As Hollis puts it: “Political actors, duly appointed\nwithin a legitimate state, have an authority deriving finally from the\nPeople. Currently that means from you and me.… When their hands\nget dirty, so do ours” (Hollis 1996, 146–7). Like Walzer\nthey assume that somehow the ruled require the rulers to dirty their\nhands, and this opens the way to distribute some degree of\nresponsibility or “dirt” to them. \n\nTaking Walzer’s claim first, it is not at all obvious that\n“we” want or hope that our leaders will violate deep moral\nprohibitions where they judge it necessary to achieve important\npolitical ends or avoid very bad outcomes, even if they remain\nconscious of their wrongdoing. No doubt some of us do and some of us\ndon’t, but the issue is not really one of counting the preponderance\nof desire in the community; it is rather whether there is something\ninherent in the relation of the democratic citizenry to its leadership\nthat authorizes the leaders to dirty their hands in the relevant\nway. Archard explicitly argues for such an authorization, claiming\nthat it is this authorization that gives the citizens a share in the\ntaint of dirty hands. Hollis, Dennis Thompson, Neil Levy and Janna\nThompson rely upon some similar link.  \n\nBut what exactly is this the nature of this authorization? It must be\nmore than simply giving certain people the authority to govern on our\nbehalf since that seems compatible with implicit or explicit\nrestrictions upon what they can or cannot do. Clearly, Archard needs\nsome strengthening of what the authorization allows; he tries to\nachieve this by using the idea of a division of labor. Specifically,\nhe argues that there is a both a political and a moral division of\nlabor (Archard 2013, 782). The political is relatively\nuncontroversial: it is the thesis that efficiency is best served by\nthe legitimate, multiple tasks required in a community being divided\nand the task of governing is one of them. This makes no further\nnormative claims about restrictions or entitlements related to the\nexercise of those tasks, and is compatible with most forms of\ngovernment. The moral division asserts that the different roles in\nsociety carry with them different moral prerogatives and duties\nappropriate to the different roles. But whatever the merits of such\nrole morality, it is not clear that it permits rulers to do anything\nat all that they believe will fulfill the purposes of their\nrole. Combining the idea of role with that of authorization cannot\nshow that the authorized role player is entitled to use whatever means\nhe or she judges the only effective way of achieving the role’s\npurposes. If it did, then authorizing a debt collector would seem to\nimply that the agent may torture the debtor if that is the only way to\ncollect a significant debt.  \n\nIt might be conceded that this is ludicrous in the debt-collecting\nexample, but that the political role is different because of the very\nhigh stakes, not only for the politicians, but for the democratic\ncitizens. Yet we have already seen that it is hard to contain the\ndirty hands story within the realm of the political, and very few\npolitical decisions are momentous enough to give politics a status\nsufficiently privileged to exempt its practitioners, through that\nrole, from those deep moral constraints that restrict the\ndebt-collector or other agents in non-political life.  Indeed,\nconsciousness of these facts helps explain why Walzer has\nprogressively tightened the conditions in which dirty hands apply. So\nthe question about authorization must focus on whether\n“we” can plausibly be said to have authorized violations\nof deep moral principle in supreme emergency situations. Dennis\nThompson insists we do when he says that the dirty hands politician\nacts “not only for us, but with our consent—not only in our name\nbut on our principles” (Thompson 1987, 18). \n\nThis confident answer to the question is not however supported by\nargument or even survey, and seems to assume unanimity amongst the\n“we” of a pluralistic, democratic community that is\nunlikely to obtain. Dennis Thompson relies upon the legitimacy of the\ndemocratic process and citizens’ assent to its outcomes, but, aside\nfrom any general problems with consent theory, the ruler’s dirty hands\nacts are often enough illegal or unconstitutional, as in the case of\ntorture, or in violation of declared policies that got the ruler\nelected. Moreover, what we want of our political leaders will\npresumably depend upon who “we” are and what moral and\npolitical principles “we” hold. Suppose a dirty hands\ndecision has been made by the leaders to torture an innocent child in\norder to extract information from the child’s radical parent about a\n“ticking bomb” (and suppose that this is a genuine dirty\nhands decision and not one flawed by lack of knowledge or ignoring of\npreferable alternatives) then it is plausible to hold that those\ncitizens who think that the moral politician should violate his (and\ntheir) deep moral objections to torture in such circumstances must\nshare in the guilt or shame that should attach to the politician. But\nthere will surely be many citizens who either think that the moral\nviolation should not have occurred, even in these circumstances, or\nwho think that the prohibition is not as deep as commonly supposed and\nhence that the politician’s decision is right but not immoral. It is\nimplausible to hold that both these groups are implicated in dirty\nhands in the way Archard and others suggest that all democratic\ncitizens, merely by being citizens, are.   \n\nMoreover there is a further question underlying the question of\nconsent or authorization or expectation, namely that concerning what\nwe ought to want, expect or authorize and what principles we ought to\nhave. This is the question whether politicians ought to get their\nhands dirty, in any sense of “ought” that carries ultimate\nweight. If the politicians are right (in certain, presumably extreme,\ncircumstances) to dirty their hands and they are right to do it on our\nbehalf, then at least those of us who agree that it is right are\ninvolved in what they do and have some responsibility for it. Indeed,\nwe are more than tainted, we are complicit.  \n\nEmphasizing the shared guilt of citizens has implications for a\nfurther issue, concerned with how the dirty hands perpetrator should\nbe treated after the event. Walzer argues that the politician’s\ngenuine guilt means that she should suffer a penalty or a shaming for\nhaving done what “we” want her to do (Walzer 1973,\n177–8; 1974 79–80). Others have taken a similar line\nthough the position has been criticized by, for example, Tamar Meisels\nand Neil Levy (Meisels 2008a, 227 and Levy 2007 throughout). There are\nserious problems about moral responsibility in claiming that a dirty\nhands agent who does what is morally wrong because he must should be\npunished or publicly disgraced. After all, if the freedom to act is a\nprecondition of moral responsibility and therefore blame, then the\ndirty hand agent who does what is (all-things-considered) necessary\nand somehow right seems immune to the criticism involved in\nblame. (For further elaboration of this and related objections see\nLevy 2007; also Meisels 2008a, 226–27.) The point here, however,\nis that, even if it is proper to blame and shame for dirty hands,\nthen, on the supposition that all citizens share in the taint,\nselecting only one to shame seems distinctly unjust, indeed massively\nhypocritical.  While the rest of us rejoice and celebrate the happy\nconsequences of our agent’s necessary misdeed, she is shunned or\nworse. As already noticed, Walzer does think that punishing the dirty\nhands conduct of the principal agents makes our own hands dirty\n(though he doesn’t seem to think that our original authorization of\nthe conduct does this). He doesn’t elaborate the point, but it opens\nup intriguing prospects since presumably we dirty “our”\nhands in punishing these agents precisely because, in some sense, they\nare “innocent” or at least do not deserve punishment\nbecause they have acted “rightly”. This opens up bizarre\npossibilities of regress since “we” now should have to pay\na further price for inflicting a price on ourselves when we have done\nthe right (but immoral) thing in punishing ourselves, and so on and\non. It seems the spreading of responsibility for dirty hands to the\ngoverned community merely adds to worries about the coherence of the\nconcept.  \nClaims of shared guilt or taint raise further questions about the\nresponsibility that democratic citizens as well as their leadership\nhave for remedying the evil done to the victims of the dirty hands\ndecision. Stephen de Wijze (de Wijze, 2018) argues that not only must\nthe leadership try to justify their decision to their constituents,\nbut they and all their democratic citizens are liable to make\nrestitution to victims for the “necessary” harm done by the dirty\nhands decision. Admittedly, he thinks that that although the citizens\nare complicit their “moral pollution” is generally less than the\nleadership. Even so, they are obliged to make amends to the victims of\nthe decision. All citizens, he argues, even those dissenting from the\ndecision, must “share in the moral burden, and contribute to the\nappropriate restitution” (de Wijze, 2018, 144). So they must pay “some\npenalty” perhaps in the form to increased taxation to effect\nreparations. \nThere is some plausibility in the claim that even strongly dissenting\ndemocratic citizens incur some restorative and other moral obligations\nas a result of their leaders’ dirty hands behaviour, but support\nfor this claim need not resort to dubious extensions of the idea of\ncollective guilt or moral taint. Membership in a democratic political\ncommunity (or even in some non-democratic ones) creates a set of\nrelationships that involve forms of identification such that a degree\nof pride can be taken in good decisions by the leadership and by\nfellow citizens and a degree of shame or alienation at bad ones. None\nof this mans that the dissenting citizen is in any way morally\nresponsible for those decisions, but what it may mean is that the\ndissenting citizen has some special moral responsibility to criticise\nthose decisions, including the dirty hands ones that she rejects, and\nto do what is possible, in spite of her lack of pollution or guilt, to\nrepair the bad effects. Responsibility for bad acts should be\ndistinguished from responsibility to remedy or compensate for them,\nthough it is a complex matter how to sketch the lineaments of this\ndistinction. \n\nBoth dirty hands and moral dilemmas challenge the idea that some\nmoral prohibitions or negative duties are “absolute” though\nthey do so in different ways. If we deny that there are moral rules or\nprohibitions that stand whatever the context, then it will not be\nsurprising that deep moral prohibitions may be legitimately overridden\nin some circumstances. Indeed, many contemporary moral theories, other\nthan utilitarianism, insist that such overruling remains a permanent\npossibility. The intuitionism of W.D. Ross and his followers, for\ninstance, insists that all duties and obligations are prima facie. It\nis always possible that the prima facie duty not to kill the innocent\nwill clash with some other prima facie duty, such as the duty to\npromote wellbeing or the ruler’s duty to preserve the state or\nprotect the community, and then one’s actual duty will be the\noutcome of weighing the respective force of the clashing prima facie\nduties. One might thus see the dirty hands story as merely a version of\nthis outlook, a version that insists that only a very great weighting\non the other side of the balance can tip the scales against some very\nsignificant prima facie obligations. Using terminology of Thomas\nNagel’s, dirty hands would instantiate “threshold\ndeontology” with a very high threshold for certain action types.\nTo make this assimilation would be to take much of the sting out of the\ndirty hands story, both because dirty hands would be part of a more\ncommonplace moral perspective rather than a quite special ethic for\nemergencies, and because there seems to be no room in threshold\ndeontology, or what has been called “balanced exceptionism”\n(Coady 2004, 778–9; Coady 2008, 285–7, 299). for the idea that one has\ndone wrong in doing what is nonetheless right. There may be a sense of\nregret that one cannot avoid doing something that was prima facie\nwrong—it would be more comfortable if one’s prima facie\nduties did not conflict and therefore need resolution—but no\nwrong can be attributed to you if you have done the\nbalancing\n conscientiously.[6]\nThe balanced exceptionist can of\ncourse acknowledge that some prima facie duties are stronger than\nothers, and hence some presumptive wrongs carry more heft than others.\nIndeed, the balancing story commits its supporters to this\nacknowledgement since there would be no point to the talk of balancing\nas a procedure for decision unless there were such differences of\nweight. But the fact remains that the granting of exemption from the\nprohibition on intentionally killing the innocent is part of a normal,\neven routine, business of balancing presumptive obligations in order to\nfind what is finally obligatory or prohibited. If the scales tell you\nthat it is morally permitted or even morally obligatory intentionally\nto kill the innocent, then in these circumstances it cannot be wrong to\ndo\n so.[7] \n\nIn fact, there is an interesting comparison here with\nutilitarianism. As we have seen, it is common to contrast balanced\nexceptionism or threshold deontology with utilitarianism and to\nestablish dirty hands as a form of deontology (or intrinsicalism) that\nyields to the utilitarianism of extremity. But there may be room for a\nutilitarian version of the threshold story, even possibly the dirty\nhands story.  Surely a sophisticated version of utilitarianism, such\nas rule or indirect utilitarianism, can have room for the idea that\nduties, virtues etc. cannot be overridden by ordinary calculations of\nutility since to allow this would be to risk too much overall\ndisutility. It is only in situations of dire or “supreme”\nemergency that the disutility of abiding by the prohibitions or rules\nwould be great enough to override the utilitarian value of keeping to\nthe\n rule.[8]\nSo, depending upon\nthe empirical facts and calculations, a utilitarian can admit a role\nfor thresholds, supreme emergencies, and even dirty hands. But while\nthis might give us a utilitarian version of threshold deontology, it\nwill not do as a version of dirty hands, since the utilitarian\noverriding at the supreme emergency stage will involve a decision that\nis simply right, and not in any sense right but still wrong. The only\nsense in which it remains wrong is that weak sense, akin to that\nattributed to Ross in endnote 35, in which it would have been wrong but\nfor the supreme emergency. For the utilitarian, (as indeed for Ross)\nthere is no real moral remainder, though there may be some room for\npsychological discomfort. \n\nThe moral remainder and the remorse it generates signals the tribute\nthat dirty hands pays to moral absolutism. While actually rejecting\nmoral absolutes, the dirty hands theorist remains entranced by the\nsignificance they give to certain moral constraints. But how do we\ndecide whether moral absolutism should be rejected? It is difficult in\nthe nature of the case to see what could resolve a dispute between\nabsolutists and non-absolutists. Absolutists do not typically regard\nall moral prohibitions as absolute; they restrict their claim to a few\nsuch prohibitions, such as those against intentional killing of the\ninnocent, rape and (for some theorists) torture. Their opponents claim\nthat, even for these cases, emergency scenarios can be imagined in\nwhich “our” intuitions accept the legitimacy of such acts.\nWhere absolutists don’t reject the scenarios as merely fantastic\n(as some certainly are), they simply have different intuitions about\nthe force of the examples. Moreover, they can point out that most moral\ntheorists, including their opponents, are absolutists about some moral\nissues. Utilitarians allow no exceptions “whatever the\ncircumstances” to their basic rule of maximising satisfactory\noutcomes, Rawlsian contractualism gives an absolute priority to certain\nprinciples of liberty, and similar points apply to other theories\nnormally opposed to absolutism. It might be replied that the level at\nwhich absolutism applies is different, and this is true since the\nabsolutist endorses specific moral prohibitions such as that on murder\nor torture whereas the other theories are usually absolute at a more\nabstract level. Yet it is unclear why this is an important difference,\nor why, if it is, it should count against the absolutist. After all, it\nis surely plausible that our conviction that murder or torture is\nalways wrong has more authority than any conviction that we should\nalways maximise the greatest happiness of the greatest number or always\nmaximise preference satisfaction. Moreover, some specific moral\nprohibitions seem proof against even fantastic counter-examples, e.g.,\nthe principle that it is wrong to torture an innocent child for fun.\nBut, even here, it may be hazardous to underestimate the ingenuity of\nphilosophers in constructing bizarre counter-examples. Clearly, more\nremains to be said about the nature of a defensible (or objectionable)\nabsolutism, but our discussion at least serves to indicate the\nsignificance of absolute prohibitions for the framing of dirty hands\nscenarios. \nWalzer’s attitude to absolutism is (as it has to be) one of\nrespectful rejection. He says: “I don’t believe that\nterrorism can ever be justified. But I also don’t want to defend\nan absolute ban. ‘Do justice though the heavens fall’ has\nnever seemed to me a plausible moral position” (Walzer 2006, 7).\nElsewhere, he says, after claiming that absolutism is “very old,\nperhaps older than anything else in our moral understanding”,\nthat at the point of disaster or supreme emergency “absolutism\nrepresents, it seems to me, a refusal to think about what it means for\nthe heavens to fall” (Walzer 2004a). Such a refusal can indeed be\nrepresented as obtuse, but when we come to cash out contemporary\nthinking about falling heavens we might think about the issue of\ntorture, an issue that was one of Walzer’s earliest examples\ngenerating dirty hands. The easy acceptance since September 11, 2001,\namongst some intellectuals of the recourse to torture in situations of\nemergency, frequently it would seem far short of “supreme”,\nhas raised questions of the relevance of absolutism even on the part of\nthose who had previously endorsed dirty hands or exceptionism of some\nsort. So, Henry Shue, for instance, always a strong opponent of\ntorture, had nonetheless allowed in his original treatment of the issue\nthat torture might be morally permissible in certain\n“extreme” circumstances (Shue 1977–78). But in a\nrecent article, Shue criticises his own admission and the widespread\nintellectual acceptance of torture in extremis as a resort to\n“dreamland” (Shue 2006). By this he means that the\nphilosophers’ stories about “ticking bomb” scenarios\nare basically fantasies that distract from the reality of moral\nassessment in the real world. Shue’s opposition is now, as a\nmatter of practice, resolute and absolute. Others have also expressed a\ncommitment to a sort of absolutism in connection with torture. Bob\nBrecher, for example, provides a criticism of the ticking bomb scenario\n(which is basically the scenario Walzer uses in his original paper on\ndirty hands) and from a purely consequentialist perspective endorses\nthe need for an absolute condemnation of torture (Brecker 2007). So the\ndebate about torture largely engendered by the “war on\nterror” has revived interest in the credentials of moral\nabsolutism, although much about the nature and types of absolutism\nremain in need of clarification. In any event, there is clearly reason\nto approach the topic of dirty hands with a degree of suspicion\nregarding Lady Carbury’s enthusiasm for “beneficent\naudacity” and her contempt for measuring exceptional people by\nthe “ordinary rule” appropriate to the rest of us.","contact.mail":"t.coady@unimelb.edu.au","contact.domain":"unimelb.edu.au"}]
