His\nsystem had several consequences which Mally regarded as surprising but\ndefensible. It also had a consequence (“A is obligatory if and\nonly if A is the case”) which Menger (1939) and almost all later\ndeontic logicians have regarded as unacceptable. We will not only\ndescribe Mally’s system but also discuss how it may be repaired.\n\nIn 1926, the Austrian philosopher Ernst Mally (1879-1944) proposed the\nfirst formal system of deontic logic. In the book in which he\npresented this system, The Basic Laws of Ought: Elements of the\nLogic of Willing, Mally gave the following motivation for his\nenterprise: \nAs Mally’s words indicate, he was not primarily interested in deontic\nlogic for its own sake: he mainly wanted to lay the foundation of\n“an exact system of pure ethics” (eine exakte reine\nEthik). More than half of his book is devoted to the development\nof this exact system of ethics. In the following, we will, however,\nconcentrate on the formal part of his book, both because it is its\n“hard core” and because it is the part that has attracted\nthe most interest. \nMally based his formal system on the classical propositional calculus\nas formulated in Whitehead’s and Russell’s Principia\nMathematica (vol. 1, 1910). \nThe non-deontic part of Mally’s system had the following vocabulary:\nthe sentential letters A, B, C, P and Q (these symbols refer to states\nof affairs), the sentential variables M and N, the sentential\nconstants V (the Verum, Truth) and Λ (the\nFalsum, Falsity), the propositional quantifiers ∃ and\n∀, and the connectives ¬, &, ∨, → and ↔.\nΛ is defined by Λ = ¬V. \nThe deontic part of Mally’s vocabulary consisted of the unary\nconnective !, the binary connectives f and ∞, and the sentential\nconstants U and ∩. \nf, ∞ and ∩ are defined by: \nMally did not only read !A as “it ought to be the case that\nA.” Because a person’s willing that a given state of affairs A\nbe the case is often expressed by sentences of the form “A ought\nto be the case” (for example, someone might say “it ought\nto be the case that I am rich and famous” to indicate that she\nwants to be rich and famous), he also read !A as “A is\ndesirable” or “I want it to be the case that A.” As\na result, his formal system was as much a theory about Wollen\n(willing) as a theory about Sollen (ought to be the case).\nThis explains the subtitle of his book. In modern deontic logic, the\nbasic deontic connective O is seldom read in this way. \nWe have just described one respect in which Mally’s deontic logic was\ndifferent from more modern proposals. There are two other conspicuous\ndifferences: \nMally adopted the following informal deontic principles (Mally 1926,\npp. 15-19): \nMally did not offer much support for these principles. They simply\nseemed intuitively plausible to him. \nMally formalized his principles as follows (Mally 1926,\npp. 15-19): \nAxiom IV is strange: \nFor these reasons, we replace Axiom IV by the following\n axiom:[2] \nMally could hardly have objected to this version of Axiom IV\nbecause it is equivalent with his theorem (23′), i.e., V f U, in\nvirtue of Def. f. In the following “Axiom IV”\nwill always refer to our version of Axiom IV rather than Mally’s.\n \nUsing Def. f, Axioms I-V may also be written as follows\n(Mally 1926, pp. 15-19 and p. 24): \nMally derived the following theorems from his axioms (Mally 1926,\n pp. 20-34).[3] \nMally called theorems (1), (2), (7), (22) and (27)–(35)\n“surprising” (befremdlich) or even\n“paradoxical” (paradox). He viewed (34) and (35)\nas the most surprising of his surprising theorems. But Mally’s reasons\nfor calling these theorems surprising are puzzling if not\nconfused. \nConsider, for example, theorem (1). Mally interpreted this theorem as\nfollows: “if A requires B, then A requires everything that is\nthe case” (Mally 1926, p. 20). He regarded this as a\nsurprising claim, and we agree. However, Mally’s interpretation of (1)\nis not warranted. (1) only says that if A requires B, then A requires\nthe Verum. The expression “if A requires B, then A\nrequires everything that is the case” is to be formalized as \nThis formula is an immediate consequence of (1) in virtue of\nAxiom I. In other words, Mally should have reasoned as follows:\n(1′) is surprising; but (1′) is an immediate consequence\nof (1) in virtue of Axiom I; Axiom 1 is uncontroversial; so\n(1) is to be regarded as surprising.\n \nA similar pattern is to be seen in many of Mally’s other remarks about\ntheorems which surprised him. He generally read too much into them and\nconfused them with some of the consequences they had in his\nsystem: \nThe latter sentences, which seem to identify being obligatory with\nbeing the case, are surely the most surprising of our\n“surprising\n consequences.”[4] \nHowever, (34) and (35) do not assert that being obligatory is\nequivalent with being the case, for the latter statement should be\nformalized as A ↔ !A. The latter formula is a theorem of Mally’s\nsystem, as will be shown in a moment, but it is not to be found in\nMally’s book. \nMally regarded theorems (28)–(32) as surprising because of their\nrelationships with certain other surprising theorems: \nMally’s list of surprising theorems seems too short: for example, (24)\nis equivalent with A → !A in virtue of Def. f. But A →\n!A may be paraphrased as “the facts ought to be the case,”\nan assertion which Mally regarded as surprising (Mally 1926,\np. 24). So then why didn’t he call (24) surprising? Did it not\nsurprise him after (22)? \nEven though Mally regarded many of his theorems as surprising, he\nthought that he had discovered an interesting concept of\n“correct willing” (richtiges Wollen) or\n“willing in accordance with the facts” which should not be\nconfused with the notions of obligation and willing used in ordinary\ndiscourse. Mally’s “exact system of pure ethics” was\nmainly concerned with this concept, but we will not describe this\nsystem because it belongs to the field of ethics rather than deontic\nlogic. \nMally’s enterprise was received with little enthusiasm. As early as\n1926, it was noted that “Mr. Mally’s deductions are frequently\nso amazingly obtuse and irrelevant that (despite his elaborate\nsymbolic apparatus) it is only necessary to state one or two of them\nto show how far his discussion has strayed from its self-appointed\ntask” (Laird 1926, p. 395). \nIn 1939, Karl Menger published a devastating attack on Mally’s system.\nHe first pointed out that A ↔ !A is a theorem of this system. In\nother words, if A is the case, then A is obligatory, and if A ought to\nbe the case then A is indeed the case. As we have already noted in\nconnection with theorems (34) and (35), Mally made the same claim in\ninformal terms, but the formula A ↔ !A does not occur in his\nbook. \nMenger’s theorem A ↔ !A may be proven as follows (Menger’s proof\nwas different; PC denotes the propositional\ncalculus). \nFirst, A → !A is a theorem: \nSecond, !A → A is a theorem: \nBecause A → !A and !A → A are theorems, A ↔ !A is a\ntheorem as well. \nMenger gave the following comment: \nThis result seems to me to be detrimental for Mally’s theory, however.\nIt indicates that the introduction of the sign ! is superfluous in the\nsense that it may be cancelled or inserted in any formula at any place\nwe please. But this result (in spite of Mally’s philosophical\njustification) clearly contradicts not only our use of the word\n“ought” but also some of Mally’s own correct remarks about\nthis concept, e.g. the one at the beginning of his development to the\neffect that p → (!q or !r) and p → !(q or r) are not\nequivalent. Mally is quite right that these two propositions are not\nequivalent according to the ordinary use of the word\n“ought.” But they are equivalent according to his theory\nby virtue of the equivalence of p and !p (Menger 1939,\np. 58). \nAlmost all deontic logicians have accepted Menger’s verdict. After\n1939, Mally’s deontic system has seldom been taken seriously. \nWhere did Mally go wrong? How could one construct a system of deontic\nlogic which does more justice to the notion of obligation used in\nordinary discourse? Three types of answers are possible: \nThe first two suggestions turn out to be sufficient, so the third\nproposal is overkill.\n \nIn the following we will point out three facts:\n \nFirst, if Mally’s deontic principles are added to a system in which\nthe so-called paradoxes of material and strict implication are\navoided, many of the “surprising” theorems (such as (34)\nand (35)) are no longer derivable and A ↔ !A is no longer\nderivable either (section 8).\n \nSecond, if Mally’s deontic principles are added to a system in which\nthe so-called law of the excluded middle is avoided, the unacceptable\nconsequence A ↔ !A is no longer derivable, but almost all\ntheorems that Mally derived himself are still derivable (section 9).\n \nThird, if Mally’s deontic principles, e.g., Def. f and\nAxiom I, are slightly modified, the resulting system is almost\nidentical with the system nowadays known as standard deontic logic\n(section 10).\n \nMally’s informal postulates (i)–(iii) and (v) are conditionals or\nnegations of conditionals, i.e., of the form “if … then\n—” or “not: if … then —.”\nFøllesdal and Hilpinen (1981, pp. 5-6) have suggested that\nsuch conditionals should not be formalized in terms of material\nimplication and that some sort of strict implication would be more\nappropriate. But this suggestion is not altogether satisfactory, for\nboth A → !A and A ↔ !A are derivable in the very weak system\nS0.90 plus I′ and III′, where\n→ is the symbol of strict\n implication.[7] \nIn systems of strict implication the so-called paradoxes of material\nimplication (such as A → (B → A)) are avoided, but the\nso-called paradoxes of strict implication (such as (A & ¬A)\n→ B) remain. What would happen to Mally’s system if both\nkinds of paradoxes were avoided? This question can be answered by\nadding Mally’s axioms to a system in which none of the so-called\n“fallacies of relevance” can be derived (see the entry on\n relevance logic). \nIn the following, we will add Mally’s axioms to the prominent\nrelevance logic R. The result is better than in the\ncase of strict implication: most of the theorems which Mally regarded\nas surprising are no longer derivable, and Menger’s theorem A ↔\n!A is not derivable either. But many “plausible” theorems\ncan still be derived. \nRelevant system R with the propositional constant t\n(“the conjunction of all truths”) has the following axioms\nand rules (Anderson & Belnap 1975, ch. V; ↔ is defined\nby A ↔ B = (A → B) & (B → A)): \nA relevant version RD of Mally’s deontic system may\nbe defined as follows: \nRD has the following properties. \nAlthough most of Mally’s surprising theorems are not derivable in\nRD, this has nothing to do with Mally’s own reasons\nfor regarding these theorems as surprising. They are not derivable in\nRD because they depend on fallacies of relevance.\nMally never referred to such fallacies to explain his surprise. His\nconsiderations were quite different, as we have already described. \nRD is closely related to Anderson’s relevant deontic\nlogic ARD, which is defined as R\nsupplemented with the following two axioms (Anderson 1967, 1968,\nMcArthur 1981; Anderson used the unary connective O instead of !): \nAnderson’s system has several problematical features (McArthur 1981,\nGoble 1999, 2001) and RD shares most of these\nfeatures. But we will not go into this issue here. It is at any rate\nclear that RD is better than Mally’s original\nsystem. \nIt was recently pointed out that it is also possible to base Mally’s\ndeontic logic on intuitionistic propositional logic\nIPC rather than classical propositional logic\n(Lokhorst 2013; see also Centrone 2013). \nHeyting’s intuitionistic propositional calculus IPC\nhas the following axioms and rules (see Van Dalen 2002 and the entry\non\n intuitionistic logic): \nIf we add to these axioms and rules the following: \nAbbreviations: ¬ A = A → ⊥, A ↔ B = (A → B)\n& (B → A), T = A → A, \nthen we can formulate ID (an intuitionistic\nreformulation of Mally’s deontic logic) as IPC plus\nMally’s axioms I – V and \nAxiom VI follows from Mally’s theorem (12d) (see Mally 1926, ch. 2,\nsec. 5, p. 29 and Morscher 1998, p.\n 122).[18] \nFACT 1. ID can alternatively be axiomatized as\nIPC plus axioms !A ↔ ¬ ¬ A and\n (34).[19] \nFACT 2. A ↔ !A is a theorem of\n MD.[20] \nIn modern deontic logic, P A (“it is permitted that A”) is\ndefined as P A = ¬ !¬ A. If we adopt this definition,\nID provides !A ↔ P A (because\nIPC provides ¬ ¬ A ↔ ¬ ¬ ¬\n¬ A). Mally did not discuss permission. His approval of !A →\n¬ !¬ A (which is usually regarded as characteristic for\ndeontic logic) is clear from Mally 1926, ch. 4, sec. 10, p. 49,\nad (V). \nMally objected to !(A ∨ B) → (!A ∨ !B) and Menger objected\nto A ↔ !A (see Mally 1926, ch. 2, sec. 4, p. 27, ad (II)\nand the quote in Section 6 above). ID avoids these\nobjections: \nFACT 3. Neither !(A ∨ B) → (!A ∨ !B) nor !A → A is a\ntheorem of\n ID.[21] \nOnly one of the theorems presented by Mally is not derivable in\nID, namely (13b): ¬ (A & ¬ !B) ↔\n(¬ A ∨\n !B).[22] \nFACT 4. For any extension X of ID (in the language of\nID): X provides (13b) if and only if X provides !(A\n∨ B) → (!A ∨\n !B).[23] \nID plus (13b) does not provide !A →\n A.[24] \nThe intuitionistic reformulation of Mally’s deontic logic that we have\nproposed is successful in so far as it avoids both Menger’s and\nMally’s own objections while preserving almost all the theorems that\nMally noticed himself. However, it is unacceptable as a system of\ndeontic logic in its own right. We mention only two reasons: \n1. Theorem A → !A is intuitively invalid. No deontic system,\nexcept Mally’s, has this theorem. \n2. It is unclear how permission is to be represented. If we use the\nstandard definition (P A = ¬ !¬ A), then P A ↔ !A is a\ntheorem, but P A and !A are not equivalent according to the ordinary\nuse of the words “permitted” and\n“obligatory.” \nThe relevantist reformulation of Mally’s system that was discussed\nabove does not have these defects. \nAlthough ID is unacceptable as a system of deontic\nlogic, it does make sense as a system of lax logic, as we will\nnow show. Lax logic is used in the areas of hardware verification in\ndigital circuits and access control in secure systems, where !\nexpresses a notion of correctness up to constraints. The term\n“lax” was chosen “to indicate the looseness\nassociated with the notion of correctness up to constraints”\n(Fairtlough and Mendler 1997, p. 3). There is a considerable\nliterature on lax logic (Goldblatt 2011). \nPropositional lax logic PLL is defined as\nIPC plus (A → !B) ↔ (!A → !B)\n(Fairtlough and Mendler 1997, p. 4, Lemma 2.1). Lax logic\nPLL* is PLL plus !A ↔ ¬\n¬ A (Fairtlough and Mendler 1997, p. 23). \nFACT 5. ID is an alternative axiomatization of lax\nlogic PLL* plus\n (34).[25] \nMally’s deontic logic and lax logic arose from quite different\nconsiderations. It is therefore remarkable that the intuitionistic\nreformulation of Mally’s logic that we have discussed is identical\nwith lax logic PLL* plus (34). \nInstead of changing the non-deontic propositional basis of Mally’s\nsystem, one might also modify the specifically deontic axioms and\nrules. This might of course be done in various ways, but the following\napproach works well without departing too much from Mally’s original\n assumptions.[26] \nFirst, regard f as primitive and replace Mally’s definition of f in\nterms of → and ! (Def. f, the very first specifically\ndeontic postulate in Mally’s book) by the following definition of ! in\nterms of V and f : \nSecond, replace Axiom I, which may also be written as (B →\nC) → ((A f B) → (A f C)), with the following rule of\ninference: \nWe may then derive: \nThe so-called standard system of deontic logic KD is\ndefined as PC supplemented with 1-4 (except that ! is\nusually written as O: see the entry on\n deontic logic),\n so the new system is at least as strong as KD. It is\nnot difficult to see that it is in fact identical with\nKD supplemented with OU (Mally’s Axiom IV) and\nthe following definition of f : A f B = O(A → B). In modern\ndeontic logic, the notion of commitment is sometimes defined\nin this way. \nIn the new system, Mally’s theorems have the following status. \nThere were only 12 mismatches in the case of RD, so\nthe new system does less justice to Mally’s deontic expectations than\nRD did. But it agrees better with his general outlook\nbecause it is still based on classical propositional logic, a system\nto which Mally did not object (not that he had much choice in the\n1920s). \nMany of Mally’s surprising theorems are derivable in\nKD, but they have, as it were, lost their sting:\nthose theorems lead to surprising consequences when combined with\nMally’s Axiom I and his definition of f , but they are completely\nharmless without these postulates. \nThe standard system of deontic logic has several problematical\nfeatures. The fact that each provable statement is obligatory is often\nregarded as counterintuitive, and there are many other well-known\n“paradoxes.” The revised version of Mally’s system shares\nthese problematical features. But we will not discuss these issues\nhere. The standard system is at any rate better than Mally’s original\nproposal. \nMally’s deontic logic is unacceptable for the reasons stated by Menger\n(1939). But it is not as bad as it may seem at first sight. Only\nrelatively minor modifications are needed to turn it into a more\nacceptable system. One may either change the non-deontic basis to get\neither a system that is similar to Anderson’s system or a system that\nis identical with intuitionistic or constructive propositional logic\nwith double negation as an obligation-like operator, or apply two\npatches to the deontic postulates to obtain a system similar to\nstandard deontic logic. \nSome authors have refused to view Mally’s deontic logic as a\n“real” deontic system and say that they “mention it\nonly by way of curiosity” (Meyer and Wieringa 1993, p. 4).\nThe above shows that this judgment is too harsh. It is only a small\nstep, not a giant leap, from Mally’s system to modern systems of\ndeontic logic, so Mally’s pioneering effort deserves rehabilitation\nrather than contempt.","contact.mail":"g.j.c.lokhorst@tudelft.nl","contact.domain":"tudelft.nl"}]
