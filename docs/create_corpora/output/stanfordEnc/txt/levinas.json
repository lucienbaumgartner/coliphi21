Whereas traditionally first philosophy\ndenoted either metaphysics or theology, only to be reconceived by\nHeidegger as fundamental ontology, Levinas argued that it is ethics\nthat should be so conceived. But rather than formulating an ethical\ntheory, Levinas developed his philosophy in opposition to\nboth these aforementioned approaches. It takes the form of a\ndescription and interpretation of the event of encountering another\n person.[1]\n Giving rise to spontaneous acts of responsibility for others, the\nencounter unfolds, according to Levinas, at a precognitive level,\nthanks to what he called our embodied\n “sensibility”.[2]\n That is why a phenomenology of intersubjective responsibility would\nbe ‘first’ philosophy; viz., in the sense of\ninterpretively reconstructing a level of experience precursive to both\nreflective activity and practical interests. \n\n\nSome commentators have called Levinas’ work an ethics of ethics,\nothers a meta-ethics, while still others have urged that his thought\ncan accommodate many ethical theories, from intuitionism to\nrationalism (see below). However that may be, his work is in\nongoing, critical dialogue with three philosophers: Husserl,\nHeidegger, and Hegel. Given these targets—as well as\nphilosophical interlocutors like Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty—Levinas’ philosophy begins from an enlarged\nconception of lived embodiment and a powerful extension of\nHusserl’s technique of suspending conceptualization to reveal\nexperience as it comes to light. He is also indebted to Heidegger for\nhis hermeneutics of being-in-the-world. \n\nBooks published posthumously: \nThis entry will follow Levinas’ career chronologically, as his\nconcepts evolve. In what follows, we will emphasize the following\narguments and themes: (1) why Levinas’ is a unique first\nphilosophy; (2) how he developed his investigation of the lived\nconditions of possibility of our concern with ethical reasoning; and\n(3) the originality of his adaptation of phenomenology and his\nexistentialist hermeneutics of pre-intentional embodied\nintersubjectivity. In this entry, attention is focused throughout to\nthe contribution of commentators, with a view to providing a gateway\nto recent secondary literature. \nLevinas published his thesis, The Theory of Intuition in\nHusserl’s Phenomenology, in 1930. It was the first\nbook-length introduction to Husserl’s thought in French. By\nfocusing on the theme of intuition, Levinas established what\nphilosophical readers find notably in Husserl’s Ideas I\nand II (published in 1913 and, for Ideas II, partially in\n1930): every human experience is open to phenomenological description;\nevery human experience carries meaning from the outset, and can be\nexamined as a mode of intentionality (Ideas II: §56 h and\n§§57–61). The following year, he published his\nco-translation of Husserl’s Cartesian Meditations, in\nwhich Husserl had laid out a systematic presentation of transcendental\nphenomenology. In the 1930s, Levinas continued to publish studies of\nthe thought of his two principal teachers, Husserl and Heidegger.\nThese included the essays “Martin Heidegger and Ontology”\n(EDE: 53–76) and the extensive “The Work of Edmund\nHusserl” (DEH: 47–89). In the 1930s and 1940s, his\nphilosophical project was influenced by Husserl’s\nphenomenological method, whose foundation arguably lay in the\ncentrality of the “transcendental ego” (Ideas I:\n§49). However, suspicious of the intellectualism of\nHusserl’s approach to essences (phenomenological\n“eidetics”), Levinas gravitated toward Heidegger’s\nmore worldly approach to existence in Being and\n Time.[3]\n Between 1930 and 1935, he will nevertheless turn away from\nHeidegger’s approach to being and transcendence and develop the\noutlines of a new ontology. As we shall see, he will reconceive\ntranscendence as a need for escape from existence, and work out a\ndifferent analysis of lived time in that project. \nLevinas’ first original essay, On Escape (De\nl’évasion, 1935), examined the relationship between\nthe embodied (sentient) self and the intentional\n ego[4]\n from the perspectives of physical and affective states including\nneed, pleasure, shame, and nausea. In this succinct philosophical\nwork, Levinas was less concerned than was Heidegger with the question\nof existence as it opens up before us when we experience the\ndissolving of things in the world in anxiety (he-BT:\n §40).[5]\n Levinas’ question was not: “Why is there being instead of\nsimply nothing?” His concern was to approach existence\ndifferently, through the (human) being as Heidegger had also done, but\nin light of more embodied experiences like the above-mentioned ones\n(OE: §6). Enlarging Heidegger’s hermeneutics of\nbeing-in-the-world, Levinas gave priority to lived moods and physical\nstates that revealed existence as oppressive and indeterminate.\nIndeed, in escapism and its various aesthetic expressions, we discover\nhumans’ failed attempts to get away from the being that they\nthemselves are. “Escape”, he wrote,  \nis the need to get out of oneself, that is, to break that most radical\nand unalterably binding of chains, the fact that the I [moi]\nis oneself [soi-même]. (OE: §1)  \nIn the two imbricated dimensions of human life, sentient-affective and\nintentional, our experience of being comes to pass, in the\nrelationship between body and egoic consciousness. \nLevinas’ youthful project approached transcendence secularly, in\nlight of humans’ irreducible urge to get past the limits of\ntheir physical and social circumstances. His transcendence is less a\nquestion of cognition reaching reality or humans seeking to pass\n‘beyond’ themselves (respectively he-BT: §§43,\n10) than transcendence attempted through sensuous evasions. This quite\nmaterialist approach to transcendence is nevertheless motivated by the\nquestion of our mortality and finite being, but unlike Heidegger, it\nalso examines the enigma called infinity. \nLevinas thus accepted Heidegger’s arguments that a human being\nexperiences itself as if thrown into its world (he-BT: §38),\nwithout cognitive mastery over its birth and death. Heidegger’s\nhuman being, or Da-sein (being-there), lives out its time\nprojecting itself toward its diverse possibilities. It flees its\nuncanny thrownness by distracting itself in social pursuits, a\nposition that Levinas will not adopt. On the other hand, the\nprojective element of transcendence, which Heidegger described in\nThe Basic Problems of Phenomenology\n (he-BPP)[6]\n as merely a “stepping over to … as such”, was of\ngreat interest to Levinas. But he would enquire: to what and from what\nare we ‘stepping over’? Levinas then observed:  \n[M]odern sensibility wrestles with problems that indicate … the\nabandonment of this concern with transcendence. As if it had the\ncertainty that the idea of the limit could not apply to the\nexistence of what is … and as if modern sensibility\nperceived in being a defect still more profound. (OE:\n§1, emph. added) \nHis argument here concerns a conceit of our ‘modern’\nsensibility (and philosophy); namely, that we presume we could\nthoughtfully frame a better conception of being, wherein existence was\nin some sense self-sufficient. What Levinas calls the\n“insufficiency of the human condition” (OE: §1)\nsimply denotes the limitation of our existence, whose transcendence,\nwhen understood as escape, promises that we might somehow surpass it,\nas if through an infinite experience. When transcendence is removed\nfrom theological or metaphysical frameworks (i.e., secularized as\nHeidegger’s “stepping over”), then we grasp it in\nits historical context-dependency, as the illusions of a finite being\npondering pure self-sufficiency. Reconceived in this way, the entire\nquestion of transcendence changes, revealing the struggle to get out\nof our all too finite existence. That is why Levinas asks: “[Is]\nthe need for escape not the exclusive matter of a finite\nbeing? … Would an infinite being have the need to take leave of\nitself” (OE: §2)? In short, is our first response to\nmortality not the urge to take leave of our existence, if\nperiodically? This question is not so different from Heidegger’s\nconception of inauthenticity. But unlike Heidegger, true authenticity\ndoes not lie in securing our freedom for our most personal\npossibility, death. Levinas argued that we can approach death as\npossibility only through that of others and that we grasp being as\nfinite by way of their mortality. On the other hand, when secularized,\nthe idea of infinity refers to something absolute in human\nconsciousness (OE: §1), which motivates our repeated efforts at\nescaping ourselves into various ecstasies. This is clearly a\nconception of being different from Heidegger’s. Later, of\ncourse, Levinas will attribute infinity to a different experience,\nthat of the unbounded quality of the face of the other. However,\nintersubjectivity is little discussed in the 1935 essay. The encounter\nwith the other first comes into view as a theme in his 1940s works (TO\nand EE). Significant here, nevertheless, are the following two points:\n(1) Levinas’ argument that Heidegger’s conception of\nexistence is specific to a history, that of German thought and that of\nhermeneutics; (2) to be an embodied psyche is to struggle with the\nlimits of one’s facticity or existential situation, and it is\nthere that the question of being as our existence initially\narises. \nHeidegger’s Da-sein confronted the question of being\nwhen it found itself brought before itself in anxiety (he-BT:\n§40). In contrast, Levinas proposed other ways by which the gap\nnarrows between being itself and the beings that we are. Following his\nleitmotif of our recurrent urge to escape, Levinas examined\nthe invariable disappointments following our attempts at transcending\nour existence: the aforementioned states of need and pleasure give way\nto a sobering up or disillusionment. In affective and physical states\nlike shame and nausea, the bodily self is experienced as a substance\ntrapped in its stifling existence and desperate for a way out.\nCommentator Jacques Rolland has explored Levinas’ return to the\nbody, to concreteness, escape, and the way in which he deformalized\neven Heidegger’s hermeneutics (OE: 29–32). Rolland adds\nthat this approach was inspired by Levinas’ critical meditation,\npublished one year earlier (1934), on the materialist “blood and\nsoil” philosophy popular with National Socialism (RPH). As\nregards stifling existence, when Levinas refers to being, it is as\nongoing presence, rather than the event of disclosure that Heidegger\ndescribed. It remains a matter of debate whether this interpretation\nof being constitutes a step back to an older metaphysics prior to\nHeidegger’s innovations, or not (Franck 2008: 31). \nWhether we choose to take Levinas’ approach to being as\ndeformalizing Heidegger or as inspired by him, commentators often\nunderscore its fresh empiricism. Megan Craig compares the early works\nof Levinas with the “radical empiricism” of William James\n(Craig 2010: xv). Lisa Guenther, in turn, has examined embodiment and\nthe experience of maternity in the later Levinas (2006: 119–136,\nsee §3.4.5). From the outset, the “fact of existing”\nrefers to philosophically unexplored phenomena of our embodiment, our\naforementioned I-self (moi-soi) dualism. \nPolemically, Levinas urged that the most extreme state he described,\nnausea, amounts to being-there, what Husserl’s phenomenology\ncalled “self-positing”: “… nausea posits\nitself not only as something absolute, but as the very act of\nself-positing: it is the affirmation itself of being” (OE:\n§6). Other forms of self-positing occur, of course, as this event\nrefers to the experience of unity between the embodied self and the\nego of intentions, or indeed between what Raoul Moati compared with\nthe “first-” and the “third-person”\nperspectives (2012 [2017: 38–71]). Thus, in immediate\nexperience, I am my joy or my pain, provisionally, just as I\nmay observe myself joyful, like a third person. Nevertheless, our\nvarious efforts to get out of our concrete situations are not the same\nas what Heidegger deemed projections toward new possibilities, wherein\nour death lies at the end of all the others, as the ultimate limit, or\n“possibility of impossibility” (he-BT: §50). For\nLevinas, by contrast, escape represents a positive, dynamic need. In\nthis youthful work, he also rethinks need as fullness rather than as\nmere privation. As we indicated, he is working toward a different\nunderstanding of existence itself. Whether it is characterized by\npleasure or suffering, need is the very ground of that existence. A\nsecular transcendence responds to need, promising a path toward\n“something other than ourselves” (OE: §3), which is\nwhy the deep motivation of need is to get out of our finite condition.\nAlready by 1935, Levinas’ ontology has displaced\nHeidegger’s being in light of the dynamic relation between the\nsentient self and the intentional ‘I’; it has refocused\nattention on the present over Heidegger’s emphasis on the\nfuture, and explored new modes by which we experience the being that\nwe are. \nReconceived as need, pleasure, and nausea, our attempts at\ntranscendence open access to an experience of time different from both\nAristotle’s “measure of motion”, and the fullness of\nawaiting (the anticipated moment or khairos that Heidegger\ndeveloped in his early work). Pleasure and pain are intensities:\n“something like abysses, ever deeper, into which our\nexistence … hurls itself” (OE: §4). The priority of\npresent-time, concentrated into an extended now-moment is opened up\nthrough sensibility and affectivity. In pleasure as in pain, we\nneed—not out of lack—but in desire or in\nhope. “Pleasure is … nothing less than a concentration\nin the instant” (OE: §4). Over Heidegger’s ongoing\nopenness to possibility (he-BT: §31), the present of embodiment\nhere receives existential priority. Levinas’ emphasis on the\npresent is a theme he never\n abandons.[7]\n Moreover, though he adapts it from Husserl’s phenomenology of\n“psychic reality”, he will also enrich\n it.[8] \nIn sum, Levinas’ early essay is structured around his\nreconceptualization of fundamental existential categories. If\nHusserl’s transcendental ego returns as the “I” of\nintentions in Levinas, it remains that the embodied self has\ngreat importance as the locus or situation from which egoic\ntranscendence arises (i.e., we wake up as if out of our sleeping body,\nour soi). If the self and “I” duality is where\nthe weight of being shows itself most clearly, most affectively, then\nthe precedence Heidegger accorded to the world and to being qua call\nare decisively displaced. As indicated earlier, the latter’s\nfocus on being, as the event of disclosure and withdrawal, is\ninterpreted by Levinas in a pre-Heideggerian fashion, as the constant\npresence which Heidegger had characterized skeptically as\nmetaphysical. Levinas approaches that presence through modalizations\nprovided by sensations and affects that were unexplored by either\nHeidegger or Husserl. \nIn 1935, Levinas was convinced that through sensation and states of\nmind we also discover the futility of getting out of existence. In the\nphysical torment of nausea, we experience being in its simplest, most\nburdensome neutrality. To this, Levinas adds three provocative themes.\nFirst, if being is disclosed only through the being that we are, then\nany being that seeks to escape itself because it feels trapped in its\nown facticity, is a “creature”, carrying “the\nstigmatum of [finite] existence” (OE: §8). Second, nausea\nis not simply a physiological event. It shows us dramatically how\nexistence can encircle us on all sides, to the point of submerging us.\nAs Rolland observes, in that case social and political life may also\nnauseate us. Third, if being is experienced in its pure form as\nweighty indeterminacy, then we can neither bypass it (following the\n“aspirations of Idealism” [OE: §8]), nor even simply\naccept it as passive subjects. Being is existence, and it is firstly\nour existence. The mark of creaturely existence is need and,\nby extension, a struggle with being. Levinas concludes polemically,\n \n[e]very civilization that accepts being—with the tragic despair\nit contains and the crimes it justifies—merits the name\n“barbarian”. (OE: §8)  \nThe question remains: how shall we best think through the sensuous\nneed to transcend being? Embodied need is not an illusion; is\ntranscendence one? Levinas will answer this question fully in\n1961. \nThe 1940s writings extend Levinas’ innovations in ontology,\nalways with recourse to interpretations of embodiment and against\nHeidegger’s philosophy of existence which, for Levinas, entails\nengagement with being as “participation” without\n alterity.[9]\n These writings inflect his notion of transcendence, away from the\nimagined transcendence of evasion and pleasure, toward eros\nand the promise of the birth of a\n child.[10]\n This requires he explore alterity, understood as the feminine other\n(EE: 86). \nIn Existence and Existents (1947) and Time and the\nOther (1947), being now has a dual aspect, of light and of dark\nindeterminacy. It is as though being were divided between the being of\na created world and the darkness out of which light was\n brought.[11]\n This shifts phenomenological focus onto being as light and\nvisibility, in which we constitute objects, and being as the dark\nturmoil that we experience in insomnia. Levinas’ attempt to\nexpand the sense of the embodied Da-sein, and reconsider the\ndistinction between being and Da-sein (existence and the\nperceptual open that we are) has also changed. Following\nHusserl’s transcendental phenomenology, in which a multi-layered\n“I” directs intentional focus like a center from which our\nattention radiates, Levinas’ embodied ego is neither preceded\nnor outstripped by its world. The corporeal self [soi],\nhenceforth called the “hypostasis”, is its own ground;\ni.e., we awaken out of ourselves, into light; we proceed with our\nprojects (EE: 61–86; TO: 51–55). We fall asleep, curled\nabout ourselves, thereby exiting our conscious existence. Embodied\nconsciousness thus begins and ends with itself. As such, it is both\ndependent on and independent from its environment, and Levinas will\nurge that the subject, upon awakening, uses and masters being. \nIn the middle period essays, the partial transcendences of pleasure\nand desire, already sketched in 1935, receive fuller development and\nvariations. The meaning of transcendence focuses on a new temporality\npromised by desire and “fecundity”, or the birth of the\nson (EE: 100; TO: 91–92). The son incarnates alterity in a\ncurious way. He is, in a sense, his father and not his\nfather. However, his birth opens a focus on the future. No longer\nconceived as one of open possibilities, as Heidegger had argued, the\ntime opened by the son responds to two basic limitations on our\nunderstanding and representation: death and the other person. While\nnot denying Heidegger’s intuition about death as the\n“possibility of impossibility”, Levinas repeats his\nearlier argument that we witness death only in the death of the other.\nBut even as such it escapes everyday understanding. Hence Levinas will\nqualify death as an alterity as radical as that of the other human\nbeing who confronts me.  \nIn death the existing of the existent is alienated. To be sure, the\nother that is announced does not possess this existing as the subject\npossesses it; its hold over my existing is mysterious. It is not\nunknown but unknowable. (TO: 75)  \nOf course, we can and do constitute the other an alter ego.\nYet such constitution by phenomenological analogy never exhausts his\nfundamental difference (TO: 78–79). In so arguing, Levinas\nproposes to radicalize Husserl’s “other”, of whom\nthe latter said that he or she is “an analogon of\nmyself, [yet also] not an analogon in the habitual\nsense” (hu-CM §44: 92-96). \nTwo reversals should be noted, here, relative to 1935. First, against\nHegel’s conception of work as the dialectic of spirit\ntransforming nature, Levinas describes labor phenomenologically as\neffort and\n fatigue,[12]\n again highlighting his distinction between the embodied, working self\nand the cognitive ego. The second reversal concerns moods themselves.\nIn Heidegger, anxiety, joy, and boredom were states of mind, with\nanxiety as the privileged mood by which humans are confronted with\nthemselves, their lack of ground, and with the question of their\nexistence. In his middle period, Levinas will expand the experience of\nbeing to moods now including horror. Nighttime being reveals an\nindeterminate dark presence that is not pure nothing. “The\nhorror of the night, as an experience of the there-is, does not then\nreveal to us a danger of death, nor even a danger of pain” (EE:\n57). Therefore pure being can never be just Heidegger’s lighted\nclearing. And our existence in the world requires stronger embodiment\nthan an eye and a hand that reaches to grasp objects\n“ready-to-hand” (Heidegger). Once again, Levinas recurs to\nbodily states, this time including fatigue, indolence, insomnia, and\nawakening. In the first three, the aforementioned gap between the\nembodied self and the intentional I increases. Upon awakening, the\nembodied ego (soi-moi) reasserts its mastery over things and\neven its own bodily torpor. But for Levinas being in the world is less\na matter of utility and Heidegger’s phenomenon of\n“falling” into distraction, than one of love of life and\nsheer enjoyment (he-BT:\n 179).[13]\n This, too, is part of Levinas’ critique of Heidegger, for whom\nour concern for the world often coexists with instrumentalist\nrelationships with things. In search of variations on being as a call\nor a revelation, and in privileging the basic subjectivity (or\n“hypostasis”) capable of raising itself above being (now\nunderstood as the neutral “there is”), Levinas is en\nroute to his secular philosophy of alterity and\ntranscendence. \nIt bears recalling that, in phenomenology, light plays figurative and\nliteral roles, from Husserl’s daylight as the condition for\noptimal perception (Ideas II §18) to his metaphor for the\nintentional “ray” directed like a spotlight upon an\nobject, to Heidegger’s lighted opening that is Da-sein\nitself (he-BT: 171). Levinas in turn underscores the\n‘work’ of light as able to suspend, phenomenologically,\nthe traditional distinction between subjective and objective:\n“due to the light an object, while coming from without, is\nalready ours in the horizon which precedes it” (EE: 41).\nConsequently, intelligibility is well figured by light.\nPhenomenological evidence is guaranteed by lighted\ncircumstances—albeit for someone. Whereas Heidegger\ndefined Da-sein almost operationally (“by its very\nnature, Dasein brings its ‘there’ along with\nit” [he-BT: 171]), Levinas returns to the Moderns’\nprinciple “every object presupposes a subject”.\nMoreover, while the being of Da-sein is itself light and\n“disclosedness” (he-BT: 171), the being of Levinas’\nhypostasis is characterized by its living cycle of drowsing, sleeping,\nwaking, and acting. Thus, if being is equated with illumination, for\nLevinas it must also include the dark anonymity of night (EE: 54). It\nis both gift (Heidegger’s es gibt) and “there\nis” (Blanchot’s il y a, as taken up by Levinas).\nConsequently, the question that inaugurates fundamental ontology: Why\nis there being instead of simply nothing? is not Levinas’\nprimary concern. Nothingness, understood as pure absence, may be\nthinkable, but it cannot be experienced. Indeterminate, nocturnal\nbeing remains ‘something’. As the “there is”,\nbeing fills in all spatial and temporal intervals, whereas\nconsciousness arises out of it thanks to its self-originating\nawakening and focus. This is Levinas’ first\ncomprehensive sketch of being as a totality, in which the\nself-ego dyad appears as the limited transcendence of neutral being.\nOver the course of his analyses, this self-ego will hearken to a call.\nHowever, the call comes not from being but from an alterity that\nLevinas compares with death itself. “Just as with death, I am\nnot concerned with an existent, but with the event of\nalterity” (TO: 87, emph. added). With “the event of\nalterity”, however, there is the call of the other person,\nnotably female, experienced as desire, need, even\n generosity.[14]\n These works set the stage for later descriptions of world, facticity,\ntime as now-moment, transcendence in immanence, and transcendence\ntoward a future fecundity in the family. They constitute the core of\nLevinas’ first major work, Totality and Infinity: An Essay\non Exteriority.  \nTotality and Infinity was written as Levinas’\nDoctorat\n d’État.[15]\n His concept of transcendence provides us a useful point of departure\nin Totality and Infinity, provided we understand his debt to\nHusserl’s phenomenology. Husserl understood transcendence in\nseveral ways, of which one significant dimension was that typical of\nconsciousness extending toward, and encountering, the worldly objects\nat which it aims. After Husserl, Heidegger will define transcendence\nas the essence of our existing in the world; Da-sein is\nalways already in the world among things, according to a worldly\ntranscendence or being out-there. Sartre followed Heidegger in this,\nurging that “transcendence is a constitutive structure of\nconsciousness” (Sartre 1943 [1992: 23]), and his concept of\nconsciousness is similarly in the world and ingredient in our\nactions. \nFor Levinas, these senses of transcendence are acceptable but not\nprimary. Instead, he aligns transcendence with exteriority, in the\nsense of what lies outside myself but eludes my comprehensive\nknowledge: the other person (TI:\n 49).[16]\n The encounter with the other is an encounter with a visible thing, of\ncourse. But this other speaks to me, implores or commands me.\nIn responding, I discover my responsibility to them. This is the\nground of ethics or indeed our concern with ethics as the good of the\nother person. \nAs Levinas argues, when ethics goes in search of its existential\nground, before any consideration of utility, virtue, or duty, it\ndiscovers the intersubjective enactment of responsibility, which\nresists being integrated into accounts in which the other is a\nuniversal other to whom it is my duty, for example, to act\nethically or in the hope of increasing the happiness of the\ncollectivity. Utility, virtue, and duty are crucial to ethical\ndebates. Yet Levinas is pointing to their common lived origin\nin the irreducibility of the face-to-face encounter. \nMichael Morgan has discussed Levinas’ existential basis of\nethics in relation to the three ethical schools just indicated (2007).\nHe reminds us that Levinas is working at a pre-theoretical and\nembodied level that represents the impetus behind ethical\nsystems forged through reflection, tradition, and critique. In that\nsense, Levinas’ objective is simultaneously phenomenological and\nhermeneutical: he describes the encounter with the other,\nargues that it imposes a limit on object constitution, and\ninterpretively traces ethics back to the birth of\nintersubjective meaning. As opposed to Heidegger’s inaugural\nquestion of being, Levinas’ concern is with the exteriority or\ntranscendence of the other who addresses me. Consistent with\nMorgan’s claim, Diane Perpich has argued that the face-to-face\nin Levinas gives rise to a “normativity without norms”\n(2008: 126–127). For his part, Steven Crowell observes that the\nnormativity of the face is also epistemic; it is the ground\nfor the objectivity of any perception because, if the other did not\nface me and call my experience into question, I would never encounter\na “sense of the normative, of standards against which the\nvalidity of my experiences can be judged” (Crowell 2015: 574).\nIndeed, the first normativity I experience, prior to reflection,\ncorresponds to an affect (TI: 294), which accompanies my experience of\nthe other’s exteriority. At the same time, I respond to that\nother. As Levinas writes,  \n[l]anguage makes possible the objectivity of objects and their\nthematization. Already Husserl argued that the objectivity of thought\nconsists in being valid for everyone. To know objectively is therefore\nto constitute my thought in such a way that it already contain[s] a\nreference to the thought of others. What I communicate therefore is\nalready constituted in function of others. (TI: 210, emph. added) \nThus, Levinas’ existential phenomenology of the face-to-face is\nrelevant to contemporary ethics above all insofar as ethics is\nconcerned with its own grounds in lived intersubjectivity. We can even\nnote parallels between Levinas and some contemporary ethicists. For\nexample, the neo-Kantian, Onora O’Neill, bases the rationality\nof practical reason on a “minimal but authoritative\ndemand”, which implies that the ethical principles I espouse\nnever be irrational so that another person could not similarly adopt\nthem. Levinas might say that the “authority” motivating\nsuch demands is experienced like an effect of the other’s\ntranscendence (O’Neill 1996: 51–57). Moral intuitionists\nlike David Wiggins and John McDowell have, similarly to Levinas,\nfocused on our sensibility when it comes to grasping moral truths. In\ndiscussing authentic education, McDowell argues that acquiring an\nethical sensibility makes possible our intuitions of what is right and\ngood. It even fosters a flourishing rational will able to discern\nbona fide ethical requirements (McDowell 1998, Wiggins 1987\n[1998]). Both McDowell and Wiggins share with Levinas an effort to\nenrich the perspective on the subject as a purely rational agent,\nalthough Levinas reconstructs the intersubjective, existential origins\nof that agency. \nIt goes without saying that the philosophical influences and debates\nof the above-mentioned ethicists are different from Levinas’.\nDespite this difference, however, Morgan (2007) and Jean-Michel\nSalanskis have both underscored the importance—for the\njustification of any ethics—of scrutinizing its\nexistential conditions. Salanskis asserts that Levinas’\narguments tally with what he calls “the three requirements to\nwhich any philosophical exposition of morality must respond”.\nThese are:  \nduty as irreducible to being, as Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein\nexperienced and expressed it. [And ethics, secondly,] must\nnevertheless favor the … designation of an objective\nduty, not relative to a subjective or psychological trace (such\nrelativity being precursive to the dissolution of morality pure and\nsimple). [Thirdly,] duty must be felt; it is not really duty\nunless it is mine. (Salanskis 2006: 63, my trans.)  \nIf ethics refers to the study or to a system of moral principles, then\nLevinas provides a phenomenology of the everyday genesis of these\nprinciples. Salanskis calls this “a new philosophy of\nmorality” (2006: 31–73). \nIn turn, Gabriela Basterra has recalled that Kant’s moral law,\nunderstood as the basis of a positive feeling and as the object of our\ngreatest respect (Achtung) is cognized a priori, and\neven the respect we experience for it is not of empirical\norigin. Respect is thus a unique affect that motivates my will to\nfollow the moral law, though it is not a feeling in an\nempirical psychological sense (Kant 1788 [2002]). Instead, it is\nsomething that affects me, and Basterra compares it to the affection\nthat Levinas identifies as the interruption of my activity by the\nother who faces me (Basterra 2015). Once again, the two philosophies\nare different, notably because they entail distinct approaches. But it\nremains that, like Kant’s a priori, we cannot\nassimilate the motivation experienced before the face of the other to\na subjective state or to an objective concept. \nTotality and Infinity unfolds around phenomenological\ndescriptions of being, depicted initially as nature or forces in\nconflict (TI: 21–22). However, our being in-the-world also\nentails the enjoyment of natural elements and love of life (TI:\n110–115). “We live from ‘good soup’, air,\nlight, spectacles, work, ideas, sleep, etc.… These are not\nobjects of representations. We live from them” (TI: 110).\nLevinas also reframes labor as the creation of a store of goods thanks\nto which the other can be welcomed (TI: 157–161, 205), rather\nthan solely as the mastery or humanization of nature. Because we take\njoy in living and in creating a home, our lives are not firstly like\nHeidegger’s “care” (Sorge; TI: 112).\nInstead, we live nourished and can receive the other into our space.\nOn the basis of these descriptions, transcendence as defined above\ncomes to pass in several stages. First, the onset of the\nother—as the expression of the face—interrupts our free\nactivity (and willing) and calls us to account for ourselves (TI: 198,\n291), something Levinas calls “goodness” (TI:\n 200).[17]\n Second, in thereby responding, the subject approached by the other\nengages in an act that opens the possibility of dialogue. The\nunfolding of dialogue expands the social relationship, and Levinas\nargues that social life preserves a residuum of the initial\n“ethical” encounter with the face. Intersubjective\ndialogue entails conversation, teaching, and at a more general level,\nliterary or philosophical discourse (TI: 51, 57, 251–52,\n295). \nOver the course of this expansion, the trace of responsibility is\nattenuated and conundrums arise concerning the well-being of\nothers and conflicts within the community. These\nrequire deliberations about justice and fairness. For instance: what\ndoes justice for the other(s) mean? Should it above all concern the\nreparation of wrongs? Can responsibility for an other coexist with\ndisinterested equity? Or is justice ultimately in service to the\nstronger and opposed to responsibility? Now, because it can clearly be\ninterpreted as all these things, justice sometimes appears as\nintermediary between Levinas’ aforementioned ontology of worldly\nforces in conflict (or elementary being) and acts of responsibility.\nThis would tally with Aristotle’s two conceptions of justice,\nfirst as political and second, as unbidden ‘decency’,\ntò epiekes, meaning to accept receiving less than\none’s share. Aristotle himself defined the combination of the\ntwo as complete virtue (Nicomachean Ethics, 1130a,\n119 and\n 1137b7–11).[18]\n There would thus be an interesting precedent to Levinas’\nquestion of the relationship between responsibility and justice in\nAristotelian virtue ethics. \nLevinas’ argument in Totality and Infinity unfolds up\nto the question of justice and then takes an unanticipated tack.\nRather than pursuing justice as it is refined through civil society\ninto the State, Levinas focuses on a smaller-scale institution, the\nfamily, arguably common to all humanity. It is presumably in the\nfamily rather than in the State that the responsibility described in\nthe face-to-face encounter is most clearly enacted. If the family is\nconsolidated by the birth of the child, then, as Levinas puts it, it\nis the father who elects and calls the child to responsibility, just\nas the child grows up serving his siblings in a way more personal than\nthat prescribed by the impersonal justice of States. According to\nLevinas, this justice carries a specific temporal\nmodalization: “The unique child, as elected one, is accordingly\nat the same time unique and non-unique. Paternity is produced as an\ninnumerable future”, as open posterity (TI: 279). In this\npenultimate section entitled “Beyond the Face”, the\nphenomenology of the family thus inserts the responsibility\nexperienced in the face-to-face into a micro-society, in which\nquestions of justice may arise, but with a new emphasis on future\ntime. \nTotality and Infinity does not devote attention to clock time\nor to the time of universal (or Hegelian) history. Because Levinas\nbegins his analyses with the concept of being as virtually aligned\nwith material causality and strife, the experience of\n‘subjective’ time as the interruption by the face is not\nyet social time. History, too, seems to be a metaphysician’s\nhistory. In his “Preface”, Levinas describes history as\nviolence, punctuated by extremes of war and temporary peace (TI:\n21–23). Morgan has argued that this makes Levinas’\napproach to ethical intersubjectivity anti-naturalistic, at least to\nthe degree that naturalism is tied to a Hobbesian mechanistic ontology\nand by extension an ego-centered anthropology (Morgan 2011: 246).\nLevinas would be the last, however, to deny the self-interest of our\ndrives and instincts. To the contrary, only an intersubjectivity\ninaugurated by the other’s summons interrupts these behaviors\n(Morgan 2011: 246). Yet Levinas also envisions an alternative history\nin which it is possible to bear witness to wrongs undergone by\npersons. These wrongs may not be recorded in the official history of\ngovernments, but their attestation prolongs the discussion of human\nsensibility invested by responsibility. Levinas writes,  \nHistory is worked over by the ruptures of history, in which a judgment\nis borne upon it. When man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted\nfrom history. (TI: 52) \nLevinas’ phenomenological account of time thus contains three\nlevels, an initial one equivalent to formal historicist time; a second\nlevel comparable to Husserl’s universal flow of immanent\n time-consciousness,[19]\n and a third temporality that is episodic and affectively colored,\nwhich he calls an interruption or rupture.  \n[The] discontinuity of the inner life interrupts historical time\n[notably in the face-to-face encounter]. The thesis of the primacy of\nhistory constitutes an option for the comprehension of being in which\ninteriority is sacrificed. The present work proposes another option\n(TI: 57).  \nThe aforementioned interruption of our immanent consciousness qua\ntime-flow by the other, an interruption that Levinas says\ncharacterizes our “inner life”, is aligned with the\nexperience of transcendence. \nUnlike Heidegger, who explained the subject in terms of\nDa-sein—itself an ongoing transcendence toward the\nworld in which Da-sein “comes toward itself\nfuturally” (he-BT:\n §69)[20]\n in facing the possibility of its mortality—Levinas situates his\nvery concrete transcendence in the interruption of the first\ntwo temporal levels. Indeed, whereas Heidegger gradually translated\nhis conception of the silent call of being (to Da-sein) into\nthe notion of the event (Ereignis) in the 1930s, Levinas\nmakes his interruption an intersubjective affair or rather\nthe basis of ethical intersubjectivity. For him, the encounter with\nthe other is not an ontological event in Heidegger’s\nsense. Neither is it like an occurrence that breaks up the historical\nstatus quo, modifying the course of history into a\n‘before’ and ‘after’, in function of its\nmagnitude. Nevertheless, Levinas does argue that the encounter with\nalterity may leave a trace in historical\n time.[21]\n Now, because the interruption brings to light a basic personal\nresponsibility for an other, a host of responses are possible post\nfacto, from welcoming that other with hospitality to attempting\nto get him out of our way. Be that as it may, a trace of the\ninterruption persists in the subject, like a grain of sand in an\noyster or a preconscious motivation to bear witness to the\nother’s suffering. Jill Stauffer has recovered some of these\n‘traces’ in her research on the testimonies of those\ndeprived of human rights (2015: 40–43, 56–58, 61–64,\n91 inter alia). \nFlowing out of the temporal interruptions that leave affective\nmnemonic traces in persons, the ground of social existence in Levinas\ndoes not resemble the solipsism for which Heidegger was sometimes\ncriticized. Our life with others is never a flight from what should be\nthe resolute assumption of our mortality (Heidegger’s\n“inauthenticity”), nor even moments disappearing in a\nteleology of expanding socio-political groups that culminate in the\nState (Hegel, sometimes Husserl). As individuals, we are always\nalready in social relations, marked by a remainder of responsibility.\nWe have always already been impacted by the expression (or face) of an\nother. Yet, because the immediacy of this impact resists\nconceptualization, we tend to overlook the force the other’s\naddress has on us (as facial expression or words). We carry on, in our\nrespective spheres, apparently motivated by desires and projects, some\nof which entail the kind of quests for mastery and recognition that\nHegel described. Nevertheless, in Totality and Infinity,\nthese quests are as if undercut by “metaphysical desire”\n(TI: 33–34, 114, 148ff.), which Levinas defines as “a\ndesire [for the other] that cannot be satisfied”. As he\nexplains, “we speak lightly of desires satisfied, or of sexual\nneeds, or even of moral and religious needs” (TI: 34). However,\nmetaphysical desire “desires beyond everything that can simply\ncomplete it. It is like goodness—the Desired does not fulfill\nit, but deepens it” (TI: 34). This under-layer of our everyday\ndesires comes to light in the faltering of our will to mastery as\nexperienced in the face-to-face encounter. The other’s facial\nexpression or bodily posture affects me before I begin to reflect on\nit. As indicated, it is dual: a command and a summons. Naked and\ndefenseless, the face signifies, with or without words, “Do not\nkill me”. It opposes a passive resistance to our desire for\nmastery wherein our freedom asserts its sovereignty (TI: 84). Levinas\nspeaks of the face of the other who is “widow, orphan, or\nstranger”. While these are biblical figures, he argues that we\nencounter them concretely even before transcribing them into religious\nallegory (TI: 76–78). Indeed they invest our freedom as the\npossibility of giving. \nIt is as summons and injunction that expression precipitates\ntranscendence. If I am self-sufficient in my everyday activities and\nperception, then this is because I am a being that inhabits\noverlapping worlds in which my sway is largely decisive for me. The\npassive resistance of the face alters this sway through an affective\nmood not unlike one Levinas had explored in 1935: shame. In shame, we\nexperience our freedom as unjustifiable. In thus being as if lifted\nout of its concerns, the “I” offers an account to the\nother, who is thereby treated as if higher than that “I”\nwhen considered in its personal sovereignty. For that reason as well,\nthe “I”, singled out and addressed by the other, is chosen\nor as if “elected” to respond (TI: 245–246, 279). It\n“transascends” (35, 41) or rises to the other, answering\n“here I am” (EI: 106). Levinas argues that this instant of\n“election” belongs to a temporal order different from that\nof everyday existence: the moment of enactment of a “good beyond\nBeing” (TI: 80, 102–104, 292–293). \nIt is impossible to set up a temporal order of succession or\nalternation between being and the good beyond being. For humans, the\ngood comes to pass almost trivially and in everyday contexts. Of\ncourse, as readily as responsibility and generosity may be glimpsed in\nhuman affairs, cruelty and competition are also obvious. Given this,\nLevinas seeks support for his intuition about the good in at least two\nmoments in the philosophical tradition wherein its occurrence and\nirreducible value have been identified: Plato’s Idea of the\ngood, and Descartes’ infinite substance, which points beyond\nitself to an unknowable cause. However, that humans\nexperience moments of inexplicable generosity, even enact them\nspontaneously, is a fact that would remain enigmatic within an\nontology of competing drives or merely utilitarian desires. In that\nrespect, the trace of the good is present within existence as the\npossibility that something other than rivalries and\ninstrumentalization take place intersubjectively. \nAs Levinas understands it, transcendence has the non-metaphysical\ncharacteristic of an interruption, a relation in nuce, and\nwhat he now calls “infinity”. Insofar as infinity denotes\nwhat is non-limited, uncircumscribable, it refers to the unpredictable\nquality of a face’s expression (TI: 5). As he writes,  \n[t]o think the infinite, the transcendent, the Stranger, is hence not\nto think an object. But to think what does not have the lineaments of\nan object is in reality to do more or better than think. (TI: 49)  \nSo far as infinity has a positive sense, then, it has that sense as\nour unquenchable desire for sociality. Thus, before we interpret it as\n“God” or reify it as a summum ens, the idea of\ninfinity is rooted in an everyday encounter whose implications are\nclearest at the sensuous-affective level, and even somewhat resemble\nHusserl’s explorations of spontaneous empathy\n(Einfühlung as radicalized in the 1930s notes on\nintersubjectivity [Husserliana, vols. 13–15 (Husserl\n1973a,b,c)]). Rather than Husserl, however, Levinas refers to the\nFrench phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s conception of\nlived intersubjective flesh, urging that this corporeal intertwinement\nis part of our “fundamental\n historicity”,[22]\n that is, part of the sedimented experiences that contribute to our\ngrasp of new situations. Rich with the accumulation of past\nexperiences, intersubjective sensibility proves to be the locus of\nrelationality and transcendence in 1961. \nIn the fourteen years separating Existence and Existents and\nTime and the Other from Totality and Infinity, we\nsee both continuities and differences. If Heidegger had begun what he\nconceived to be a hermeneutic deformalization of Husserl’s\nphenomenological consciousness, seeking what “lies hidden”\nbeneath phenomena (he-BT: §7c), then Levinas extended this\ndeformalizing gesture already in 1947, arguing that light itself is\nincipient meaning, suspending the opposition between the a\npriori and the a posteriori. By 1961, it is the\nexperience of the face-to-face encounter that destabilizes the a\npriori-a posteriori dichotomy by urging that, in the\nface-to-face, the third party (humanity) looks at me through\nthe eyes of the other. This is because the non-spatial\n“proximity” that is the interruption of our flowing\ntime-consciousness takes place with an unnoticed spontaneity like that\nof the blinking of an eye, yet nevertheless leaves a trace.\nConsciousness always takes up after these instants of interruption and\nreconnects itself as a homogeneous flow. Thus the good beyond being is\nnot radically separated from existence in 1961. Consequently and to\nrepeat, this affair is a human one. Any philosophical translation of\nconcrete embodied life must therefore approach the human subject as it\nemerges through its relations with others, even though the\nintersubjective situation entails both my particularization through\nelection and a loss of egoic mastery. This is in line with many of\nMerleau-Ponty’s analyses, some of them inspired by Husserl,\nalthough Merleau-Ponty argues against transcendental subjectivity,\nurging that the classic phenomenological “I” constituting\nits world alone will drift toward an unwanted absoluteness. It could\nthus never be alone and must be approached existentially (mp-PP:\n365). \nWhereas in Existence and Existents, Levinas voiced “the\nprofound need to leave the climate of [Heidegger’s]\nphilosophy” (EE: 4), by 1961 he will have done so, albeit not\nwithout significantly reworking Heidegger’s fundamental\nontology. As we have seen, Levinas envisages being as constant,\nneutral presence and, at times, like a Hobbesian state of nature.\nDerrida reminds us that this pre-Heideggerian conception is close to\nKant’s notion of existence understood as conflictual intensities\n(1997 [1999: 49, 86]). That is why, in its natural expression, being\ntakes on almost a mechanistic quality in Levinas. In social and\ninstitutional senses, being is conceived as the encompassing of\nindividuals and communities by the State. On the latter depend\nsecurity and property, life and death. But in the\n“Preface” to Totality and Infinity, Levinas\ncompares the State with systematic philosophy: as the\n‘organon’ of politics, the State manages commerce\nand conflicts, just as it declares wars. Similarly, Hegel’s\nidealist dialectics oversees and integrates sensibility and cognition,\npassing from the individual to the collective, and expressing the\nmovement of Geist or Spirit, itself (TI: 21–23;\n36–38; 87–88). \nOverall, Levinas’ most sustained criticisms target fundamental\nontology. As we have seen, leaving the “atmosphere” of\nHeidegger’s thought motivates his return to more traditional\nconceptions of being. To be sure, Levinas was skeptical about deriving\nan ethics from ontology. Certainly, such an ethics could not limit\nitself to Heidegger’s Mitsein, that sociality into\nwhich Da-sein flees when troubled by its uncanny\ngroundlessness (its being thrown into-the-world). Having attempted,\nfrom 1935 onward, to deformalize Heidegger’s being-there and its\nstates of mind or moods (Befindlichkeiten), that is, down to\nmore embodied experiences of shame, desire, hunger, and\nnausea, Levinas’ conviction is that Da-sein remains too\nformal an entity to exist in a world in which intersubjectivity is\nmore substantial than a mere refuge from the anxious care of\ngroundlessness (he-BT: 232). Indeed, although for Heidegger anxiety\nindividuates us and discloses our possibility for “the freedom\nof choosing … and taking hold of [ourselves]” (he-BT: 232),\nthis process remains solipsistic in the sense that it is our freedom\nand our mortality that are in question. When intensified,\nAngst reveals the groundlessness of our being-there,\nultimately freeing us for the most radical question: why might there\n‘be’ anything at all? Against Heidegger, Levinas\nunderstands this framing as tantamount to a hermeneutic universe in\nwhich the idea of our authentic possibility concerns only death and\nunderestimates the significance of the encounter with the other\nperson. Only through a different hermeneutics, which reveals human\nexistence as embodied and interpersonal, can we conceptualize\nthe opening to responsibility that the encounter with the other\ncreates. \nIn this respect, and despite his debt to Heidegger, Levinas stands\ncloser here to the French existentialists and to Charles Taylor, whose\nconception of the corporeal self is moral “through and\nthrough” (Morgan 2007: 169). However, unlike Taylor, Levinas\ndoes not endorse a plurality of strong values, because the\nencounter with the other is the primary condition for him. While\nTaylor’s philosophy is influenced by Christianity, a significant\ndebate has been ongoing for over a decade about Levinas’\nphilosophy and its relationship to Judaism. It has been suggested that\nLevinas’ critique of Heidegger’s ontology as a\n“philosophy of the Neuter” (TI: 298) relies on decisive\nattention paid to the influence of “Jerusalem” over that\nof “Athens” in the Western philosophical tradition.\nScholars like Shmuel Trigano have traced a number of crucial\nLevinasian “philosophemes” to Jewish positions, notably as\nexpressed by Philo and Maimonides (Trigano 2002: 145–178). On\nthe other hand, commentators like Leora Batnitzky have argued that,\nwhen compared with the thought of Leo Strauss, for whom Jewish\nphilosophy still holds a place for “revelation”,\nLevinas’ work largely rehabilitates the tradition of Modern\nphilosophy—and with it a secular, almost political, project\n(Batnitzky 2006: 4). Despite this, and in light of Totality and\nInfinity, she comes close to Trigano when she argues that Levinas\ntends to ignore important political questions, including that of the\nJewish State, which has dire consequences for his thought, because\n \nto think politics is urgent in an undertaking [such as\nLevinas’], since it amounts to thinking through the criterion of\nethical validity of the universalization project … with regard to\nthe other and with regard to self …. (Batnitzky 2006:\n173–174) \nLevinas’ recourse to Descartes’ Meditations may\nwell justify Batnitzky’s qualifying his thought as Modern. More\nimportant is that his argument that ethics is first philosophy (TI:\n29, 47, 304) runs into the difficulty of universalizing our\npre-intentional “experience” of spontaneous responsibility\ntoward the other. Hence, in Totality and Infinity, the\ntransition from the micro-sociality of the face-to-face encounter to\nsocial existence more broadly occurs through language as teaching and\ndialogue (TI: 194–197; 201–203). As indicated, Levinas\nwill open still another path to universalization, through the family,\nin his final section “Beyond the face” (TI:\n267–280). Despite this second path, the question remains how it\nis that, through the eyes of the other, the whole of humanity looks at\nme (TI: 213). Gillian Rose first criticized this limited\nuniversalization of responsibility as lacking important\nsocio-political mediations (1992). Ernst Wolff has investigated this\npassage toward universality in light of Levinas’ evolving\nconception of liberal society, from a skeptical stance toward a more\npositive appraisal (2007). \nBy focusing on temporal mediations (rather than social or spatial\nones), Levinas does provide a partial universalization of\nresponsibility by way of the aforementioned phenomenon of the family.\nThis choice, resembling the solidarity through love found in\nHegel’s early theological writings, works responsibility out in\nterms one might today consider traditional or patriarchal, i.e.,\nthrough paternal election and the service of the son to his brothers.\nIntroducing this discussion, Levinas admits:  \nThe acuity of the problem [of universalization] lies in the necessity\nof maintaining the I in the transcendence [of the face-to-face] with\nwhich it hitherto seemed incompatible [given its self-interests]. (TI:\n276)  \nThat is, although the face-to-face is a momentary interruption, the\ntrace of responsibility needs to be received and assured in a more\ndurable way, which leads Levinas to assert that “the fecundity\nof the I is its very [temporal] transcendence” (TI: 277). That\nis, thanks to the time of generations, an ego surpasses\nitself through its children (TI: 277). Thus, while this\nunder-determined time of generations “adds something new to\nbeing, something absolutely new” (TI: 283), the child, it\nprovides a partial mediation between the affective instant of\nresponsibility and the creation of institutions and practices apt to\nensure that the ethical trace has a potential for universality. \nBoth Rose (1992) and Derrida have pointed toward the difficulty of\nintroducing ethics into questions of justice and politics in this way\n(Derrida 1964 [1978: 121, 133–136]). Part of the difficulty here\nlies in the tension between universalization understood as the ethical\ncultivation of humanity, versus universalization understood as\nproviding an ethical inflection to politics broadly conceived. For\nLevinas, the passage of responsibility into politics is invariably\nfragile, because ethical language is frequently absorbed or imitated\nby political rhetoric. Yet, in 1961, the question of how\nresponsibility and election experienced in the family\npasses—without tribalism—into a vaster history and public\nspace remains under-thematized; notably, as it concerns demands for\nsocial justice and equality. Levinas partly responds, urging\nthat the notion of fraternity is not firstly biological or\ngenetic, but intersubjective; it flows out of face-to-face\nencounters—and what he calls the human kinship forged by\n“monotheism” (TI: 214), by which he means the ethical core\nor essence of Judaism. He argues,  \nThe very status of the human implies fraternity and the idea of the\nhuman race. Fraternity is radically opposed to the conception of a\nhumanity united by resemblance, a multiplicity of diverse families\narisen from the stones cast behind by Deucalion, and which, across the\nstruggle of egoisms, results in a human city. (TI: 214)  \nThis unification in difference is created only when monotheism results\nin a law that equalizes those obliged by it. Indeed, as we have seen,\nLevinas similarly traces what he calls originary\n“religion” to the face-to-face, following his\nphenomenological genealogy (TI: 40). Commentators have nevertheless\ninsisted that, unless ethics can correct or amend justice on the basis\nof a subject’s experience of responsibility, the possibility of\nuniversalization stands open to doubt (Wolff 2007: 383–399). And\nfor many commentators, interpersonal responsibility remains the\nexception not the rule. It may be subject to codification, though that\nwould be the concern of ethical theory, which is not Levinas’\npriority (see Morgan 2007: 238). \nTwo dilemmas thus arise in Totality and Infinity. It is an\nopen question whether they are laid to rest in Otherwise than\nBeing. They concern first the dichotomy between what was\ntraditionally called free will versus nature, and second the\nsocio-cultural mediations between families and States. In the first\ncase, it may be surprising that Levinas characterizes human existence\nin terms resembling those of physiological determinism, that is, in\nterms of drives and the interests attaching to them. For him, the\nproblem of reconciling freedom and nature would above all be one of\ninterrupting the activity of the drives, which is the bodily substrate\nof consciousness and contributes to its dynamic temporal unity.\nUnderstanding the will, then, does not begin with freedom so much as\nwith something closer to conatus essendi or even to a will to\npower (i.e., with something “natural”). Levinas proves\nclose to Kant here. For the latter, the motivation to\ndisregard one’s interests in favor of the moral law\nlies in the unique affect called Achtung. Kant urged that\nAchtung be considered in its negative and positive aspects:\nnegatively, as attention or freedom from sensuous\ndistraction. In its positive sense, Achtung corresponds to\nreverentia, respect, understood as the freedom to grasp the\nlaw as something eminently worthy of adherence, despite its\nconstraining quality. Moreover,  \nthe presentation of something as determining basis of our\nwill humbles us in our self-consciousness when we compare it with\nthe sensible propensity of our nature. (Kant 1788 [2002: 45]; Nancy\n1983 [2004: 142]; Basterra 2015: 91–98)  \nAs the focus of attention and motivation, Achtung is unique\nin that it is what Kant calls an intellectual affect (Kant\n1788 [2002: 66]). It has no direct relationship to our bodily make up,\nwhich, as we know from Levinas, is indissociably tied up with drives\nand instincts. When thus motivated, practical reason determines itself\nto act out of respect for a law indemonstrable by theoretical reason,\nthereby discovering freedom in the performance of its moral act. It is\nonly then, post facto, that freedom is found to have reality,\nthrough obedience. \nBasterra has argued that Kant’s ethics affords us an important\ninsight into the question of nature versus freedom in Levinas. Whereas\nfor both, the will follows its natural course (desires and emotions),\nsomething outside it may compel it toward ethical behavior or\nresponsibility. For Kant, the categorical imperative does not\n“belong” to the self-positing subject, but rather\naddresses them as if from without and elicits humility. For\nLevinas, it is the face of the other that addresses us thus and\nfocuses our attention, prior to our considering that face’s\nempirical qualities (sex, ethnicity, etc.; Basterra 2015:\n125–126). \nLet us now turn toward the second dilemma: the fraught relationship\nbetween ethics and politics. In 1961, Levinas characterizes politics\nand drives as unfolding in a parallel fashion. Both are sites for the\nmanifestation of the will to persist in being. He doubts that politics\n“left to itself” can become or long remain ethical (TI:\n300; Wolff 2007: 129). However, he remarks that justice can be\naddressed as a demand posed to some States, notably liberal\nones. \nThis does not solve the problem of mediations, yet suggests that it\nmay be misguided. After all, what do the mediations ultimately serve,\nif not the finality of the State as overarching protector and\n regulator?[23]\n Levinas was aware of this. In 1951, in his first published article on\nthe State of Israel, he did not hesitate to forestall accusations of\nidolatry even against a Jewish State. Arguing philosophically\nthat the “State is not an idol because it precisely permits full\nself-consciousness”, he added that modern humans\n“acknowledge [their] spiritual nature … when acting in the\nservice of the State and in their dignity as\n citizens”.[24]\n This is indeed why, he added, the decline of organized religions is\ntied to the advent of modern States. Here and elsewhere, he recognized\nthat a State, and preeminently one founded on a religion, embodied a\nparadox whose solution—in Israel’s case at\nleast—could only be found in an approach to religion as the\nsymbolic pendant of ethical responsibility (DF: 218). He\nthereupon added the more existential claim that  \nthe Jewish people craved their own land and their own State, not\nbecause of the abstract independence which they desired, but because\nthey could then finally begin the work of their lives. (DF: 218)  \nClearly, this is not an exhaustive solution to the problem of\nmediations between family (or ethnicity) and the State (or\npolitics). \nCommentators have taken various positions on Levinas’ politics.\nHoward Caygill’s Levinas and the Political was the\nfirst systematic, critical study thereof. Caygill emphasized\ninconsistencies in Levinas’ texts on politics and Israel, and\npointed to his “problematic fusion of rabbinics and\nHegelianism” (2002: 79–93). Morgan and Salanskis have\nrecently argued that politics can stand within both history\nand a certain idealism, at least insofar as one understanding of\n“Israel” acknowledges Jewish particularity as carrying the\npossibility of universalization, thanks to the Biblical\nprophets’ call for justice (Morgan 2016: 250ff; Salanskis 2006;\nsee also Salanskis 2016). It bears noting that by 1984 Levinas will be\nmore generous toward European liberal States, and more willing to\ntrace the genealogy of liberalism back to a Biblical conception of\nresponsibility. In “Peace and Proximity” (1984), he\nventured,  \nEurope is not a simple confluence of two cultural currents. It is the\nconcreteness where theoretical and biblical wisdom do better than\nconverge. The relation with the other … that is, with peace[,]\ncomes a reason that thematizes, synchronizes, and synthesizes, that\nthinks a world and reflects on being, concepts necessary for the peace\nof humanity. (col-BPW: 168) \nOtherwise than Being grew up around its core fourth chapter,\nentitled “Substitution” and first published in 1968 (OBBE:\n 99–129).[25]\n It is a justifiable simplification to say that Levinas’ concept\nof substitution corresponds to that of responsibility, explored this\ntime as immanent relationality rather than “my”\nresponse to the face, understood as exteriority. In this\nwork, Levinas uses the term\n“intériorité” repeatedly, which the\ntranslator renders as “inwardness”, perhaps to avoid\nintroducing spatial binaries (OBBE: 28, 87, 92, 108, 119). The work is\nnot about inner-outer dichotomies, much less cognitive operations, or\nobject-memories of events or things. It has little to do with what we\ndiscover phenomenologically through reflection.\n“Inwardness” denotes a bodily life as if haunted by\nothers, which is also now called “proximity” (OBBE:\n81–94). Comparable in this to Husserl’s horizon of\napperceptions, inwardness entails a spectrum of affective tones.\nPerhaps unlike Husserl, these tones require recourse to discursive\nfigures that Levinas now borrows from psychology, poetics,\nhermeneutics, even theology and dogmatics (e.g.,\n“obsession”, “persecution”,\n“recurrence”, “too tight in its skin”,\n“exile”, “maternity”, “love”, and\nfinally “expiation” and\n “kenosis”).[26]\n While thus concerned with intersubjective affectivity in its\nimmediate passive undergoing, substitution is manifest in action or\npraxis, a domain in which we experience\n immediacy.[27]\n By 1974, then, transcendence, understood as the other\n“outside”, has become transcendence-in-immanence, in a\nsense closer to Merleau-Ponty’s account of intercorporeity,\nwhich similarly urged that philosophies of embodiment should never\noppose immanence and transcendence (mp-PP: 308). For Levinas,\nthe concept of the other would still have some reference to the face\nas expression and exteriority, but it would denote\nprincipally the “inwardness” of non-object forming\nmemories, whose affective return or “recurrence”\ncomplexifies the linear time-structure of Husserl’s\nphenomenological consciousness (OBBE: 88). \nOtherwise than Being opens with a general overview of the\nargument, in which being and transcendence are also named\n“essence” and “disinterest”. Emphasizing the\nprocessual quality of being, Levinas will refer to it equivalently as\n“being” or “essence”, venturing that\nhe might even have used the dynamic form essance (OBBE: 187\nnote 1). Responsibility will be focused and discussed as the condition\nof possibility of all verbal signification (OBBE: 43–47). But\nthe themes of conversation and teaching recede into the background. He\nnow makes a more strategic use of the body as flesh, that is, as a\nlocus with simultaneously an inside and an outside, as in\nMerleau-Ponty. Subjectivity is again framed affectively as the coming\nto pass of responsibility, although this time the phenomenological\nanalysis of intentionality is analyzed into its primitive layer of\nsensibility that Levinas calls “pre-originary susceptiveness\n[susception pré-originaire]” (OBBE: 122,\n136–138). For him, that means that subjectivity always entails\npre-cognitive dimensions that are from the outset intersubjectively\nconditioned. The other has become other-in-the-same, as indicated. But\nthe other-in-the-same is not objectively different from the\nfactical other who faces me, because neither are objects and both are\nexpressions or modes of alterity. As we will see, the\nother-in-the-same describes a pre-thematic “investiture”\n(because I never know when I first experienced this other in\nme; OBBE: 125): “All my inwardness is invested in the form of a\ndespite-me, for-another” (OBBE: 11). In Otherwise than\nBeing, Levinas has returned to Husserl’s inquiries into\npassive synthesis, to the latter’s perplexities about the\nstretch of retentions of passive experiences, about the unbidden\nspontaneity of our associations, and the near-infinity of sensuous\nhorizons—all part of a process unfolding in what Husserl called\nin 1926 “a phenomenology of the so-called unconscious”\n(Husserl 2001: 201 and “Appendix 19” 512–519). In\nlight of this return, we should not approach interiority and\nexteriority as opposed terms, but as dimensions of intersubjectivity\nand the inhabitation of a self by alterity. \nThe second chapter approaches Heidegger’s discussion of language\nas the way in which being becomes, the way it temporalizes (he-BT:\n §68).[28]\n Levinas revisits Heidegger’s argument that the logos\ngathers up being and makes possible its unveiling\n(alētheia). He will argue that the lapse of time\nbetween lived immediacy and its reflective representation is\nnever fully gathered by the logos. Therefore, the\ntemporal lapse poses a challenge to language understood as\nHeidegger’s gathering and it falls, much the way that\ntranscendence as interruption did in 1961, outside the realm of being,\neven though Levinas still considers being a process of totalization,\nsomething all-encompassing. This rethinking of the lapse along with\ntranscendence-in-immanence will be Levinas’ ultimate\nmodification of Heidegger’s project. Together, the lapse and\nthis new conception of transcendence do ultimately pass through\nlanguage as words addressed. I will come back to this. For now,\nsuffice it to say that it is the inhabitation of a self by alterity\nthat forms the sensuous conditions of possibility of speech. Thus it\nis not being that addresses us through language, it is a quite\ndifferent alterity. \nTwo additional innovations in Otherwise than Being include:\n(1) the proposed phenomenological reduction to the birth of meaning in\na bodily self that carries what it cannot identify as\nproperly itself (the “other”, affectively). This appears\nto be a radicalization of Husserl’s discussion of the\npre-reflective ego in Ideas II (§58, “Supplement\n12” §§2–3). Whereas Husserl emphasized the basis\nof the ego in its ongoing flow of lived experience, which he said was\n“lawful”, Levinas focuses on the discontinuity of time\nconsciousness (see also Franck 1981 [2014: 149–166]). (2) A\nhermeneutics of the self, emerging through intersubjective contact in\nwhich the “proximity” of the other elicits passive\n“substitution” and opens onto spontaneous communication\n(OBBE: 113–121). In what suggests an attempt at deepening\nHusserl’s concept of empathy (Einfühlung; OBBE:\n125), the figures of proximity, recurrence, and substitution\ncharacterize the intersubjective intertwining that makes communication\npossible: “Communication would be impossible if it should have\nto begin in the ego, a free subject, to whom every other would be only\na limitation that invites war” (OBBE: 119). Indeed, prior to\nspoken or written language, prior to signs reciprocally exchanged,\n“we suppose that there is in the transcendence involved in\nlanguage a relationship that is not empirical speech, but\nresponsibility” (OBBE: 120). As “my pre-originary\nsusceptiveness”, the nature of intersubjective\nsensibility shares its time-structure with strong passions, sometimes\nindeed with trauma (OBBE: 122–124). As Levinas writes:  \n[this susceptiveness] describes the suffering and vulnerability of the\nsensible as the other in me …. the ipseity [also known\nas embodied selfhood] has become at odds with itself in its return to\nitself. The self-accusation of remorse gnaws away at the closed and\nfirm core of consciousness … fissioning it  \nin its temporal unity (OBBE: 124–125). Consequently,\nvulnerability and sensitivity to trauma not only provoke retreat into\nself but heighten our awareness, however tenuous, of our connection\nwith the other(s), and they motivate our bearing witness. Thus the\naffective in-habitation of my self by others precedes speech-acts and\nspeech-communities. If the reverse were the case; that is, if a de\nfacto community were posited as prior to the event of words\naddressed, then this would presuppose what it was meant to show: the\ngenesis of speech-acts (OBBE: 92). Instead, ‘beneath’\nwords proffered lies a fundamental vulnerability that psychology might\ninterpret as a predisposition to witnessing, from oneself to the\nother. Levinas calls this vulnerability the “Saying”\n(OBBE: 149–152). It is both precursive to words uttered in the\nform of address (i.e., pre-linguistic), and it would accompany\ncommunication like its affective horizon. The duality of Saying and\nSaid is a new concept in Levinas’ late work. \nBuilding on the exploration of proximity begun in chapter three,\nchapters four and five evince a tone more somber than any found\nhitherto in Levinas’ œuvre. This is in keeping\nwith the dedication of the book, written in Hebrew and in French,\nwhich announces that it will be a work of mourning. While Derrida\ncharacterized Totality and Infinity as a phenomenology of\nhospitality (Derrida 1997 [1999: 21]), Otherwise than Being\ncommemorates the “victims of the … hatred of the other\nman”. It develops the parallel between semiotic\n“substitution” of a word for a thing (or the signifying\nfunction of all language) and the spontaneous substitution of myself\nfor an other (implied by a spectrum of acts of self-sacrifice), which\nLevinas calls the one-for-the-other (OBBE: 45–50, 70–74,\n119–129). Whereas Heidegger had explored the hermeneutics of\nDa-sein, for whom communication unfolds thanks to our (as\nDa-sein) taking or equivalently offering “this [thing\nor word] as that [thing]” (he-BT: §31), Levinas will\narguably set Heidegger’s “as” into his\n “for”:[29]\n Heidegger’s “this as that” becomes\nLevinas’ “one for the other” of\nsubstitution. While responsibility expressed the unfolding of the\nintersubjective affects that Levinas compared to Plato’s\n“Good beyond Being” in 1961 (TI: 292–293,\n304–307), the good of substitution is more ambiguous, occurring\n“on the brink of tears and laughter” (OBBE: 18), yet also\n“glorious” (OBBE: 94, 140–144). \nThe experience of time characteristic of trauma, and mourning, does\nnot take the place of Husserlian phenomenology’s\nflowing-yet-always-also-present (strömend-stehend)\n time-consciousness,[30]\n any more than it replaces the succession and uninterruptedness of\nclock time. If what-is results from the self-giving of things to the\nfocus of phenomenological attention, and if together they invariably\nfind a place in the formal flow of time-consciousness, then even for\nHusserl what-is, i.e. being, must temporalize. Husserl had always\nurged that, insofar as there is appearing, there is being as well\n(hu-CM: §46; also see Heidegger, he-BT: §7). For Heidegger,\nbeing temporalized through Da-sein, which was\nout-ahead-of-itself or oriented toward its future. Yet if, in both\ntheir cases, being unfolds temporally, then for Levinas, our\nsensibility shows a different temporal character, because the\nsensibility called the other-in-the-same returns and repeats rather\nthan flows. Like trauma and mourning, responsibility in its new somber\ntones recurs without definitively halting the flow of\ntime-consciousness. This is why Levinas referred to the cluster of\nconcepts around substitution as adverbial: they pass through\nbeing (understood as verbal or processual) and its time, and they\nmodify it. Indeed, when being is understood as the verbal dynamism\nexpressed by “essence”, then responsibility and\nsubstitution can only be compared to ad-verbs. Hence the title,\nautrement, other-wise or ‘otherly’ than being\n(OBBE: 35). \nThe final half of chapter five recurs to the performative register of\nlanguage to convey the tension of a consciousness striving to\nconsolidate itself in the wake of alterity as affective investiture,\nby which its passivity slowly becomes active witnessing. This opening\nout of inward affects becoming gestures of generosity motivates\nOtherwise than Being’s recourse to a new, performative\nlanguage. Thus, Levinas adds,  \nand I still interrupt the ultimate discourse in which all the\ndiscourses are stated, in saying it to one that listens … That is\ntrue of the discussion I am elaborating at this very moment. (OBBE:\n 170)[31] \nAware of the seemingly artificial quality of calling his authorial\nwitness “immediate”, Levinas’ claim is nevertheless\nmore than a literary artifice. Basterra compares it to Kant’s\nidea of autonomy, which shows itself only when we follow a law that\n“exceeds and addresses the subject”, motivating our\nethical act (Basterra 2015: 126). Earlier in her study, she\nhad argued that the intellectual affect of Achtung was\ncapable of focusing our attention and opening us to a respect\ncomparable to Levinas’ Saying, which he also calls\n“sincerity”. For pure reason, autonomy “is therefore\nan illusion”, but it is one only insofar as that which is not\nintrinsically part of my interests can still motivate me to\nact. Thus pure reason erroneously supposes that my ethical gesture\ncame from me (Basterra 2015: 129). Levinas provides us a\ncrucial hermeneutics of the intersubjective origin of this Kantian\n“illusion”. He sets our misinterpretation of heteronomy as\nautonomy in Kant’s practical reason into a hermeneutic register,\nreferring to the sincerity and substitution underlying the words we\noffer: “It is in the risky uncovering of oneself, in sincerity,\nthe breaking up of inwardness … exposure to traumas,\nvulnerability” that I bear witness to, and for another (OBBE:\n48). Again, it does not come from us. Levinas finds illustrations of\nsuch witnessing in many places, from the justice imperative of the\nprophets to the concern of Latin American clerics over the events\nunfolding in Chile in 1973 (OGCM 81–82). \nAs in his 1935 discussion of need and nausea, Otherwise than\nBeing argues that lived sensibility often overflows\nrepresentation. And again, Levinas suggests sensuous modes different\nfrom Heidegger’s Befindlichkeiten (see\n §2.2 above),\n in which all understanding takes place for Heidegger (he-BT: 17).\nIndeed, interwoven layers of affectivity are unfolded in Otherwise\nthan Being. Levinas explores the sensuous-affective\nproto-experience of the other in light of new moods, writing:\n“Remorse is the trope of the literal sense of sensibility. In\nits passivity is erased the distinction between being accused and\naccusing oneself” (OBBE: 125). Unlike Existence and\nExistents, wherein light overcame the distinction between\nsubjects and objects, allowing the subject to make the object\nintelligible within its horizon of appearing (EE: 41), Otherwise\nthan Being approaches transcendence in sensuous and temporal\nterms, arguing inter alia for the insistence of a past that\neludes thematization (OBBE: 122–123). In that sense,\ntranscendence for an embodied being is always\ntranscendence-in-immanence. The affective “experience” of\nmy relations with particular others is thus preserved as a trace or\npre-thematic reminiscence of the flesh, as “a relationship with\na singularity without the mediation of any principle, any\nideality” (OBBE: 100). Invoking Otherwise than Being\n(OBBE: 105–107), John Llewelyn has called this affective\ndimension of invested selfhood, or “ipseity”, a\n“‘deep’ saying” that “bears witness to\nwhat is neither recollected nor forgotten in the epistemic\nsense of these terms when [or once] it is represented as a\nsign” (Llewelyn 2002b:\n 135).[32] \nAs indicated, Otherwise than Being problematizes\nLevinas’ earlier, more ontological approach on the basis of\nHusserl’s inquiries into passive syntheses and\nEinfühlung (empathy). There is good reason for this.\nResponsibility denoted an event that repeats, and even increases as it\nis assumed (already TI: 100–101). In Otherwise than\nBeing, however, the question of immanence and passivity arises in\nregard to responsibility’s unremarked persistence and its\naffective upwellings in us. This is because the status of a memory of\nsensuous events, which affect us before we represent them, is\nelusive. For the phenomenologist, it might correspond to an\napperception or horizon, in the sense of something not directly\nperceived. Thus Levinas also insists that, unlike the apperceptions\nHusserl was able to explore thanks to the reduction he set on\n memory,[33]this affective past continues to elude thematization because\nit was never an intentional object at all, and because memories of our\nlived flesh precede the consolidation of our ego (OBBE:\n144–147). John Drabinski has explored this\n“pre-history” in light of Levinas’ reprise of\ngenetic phenomenology (2001: 185–206). Theodore de Boer\napproaches it as an echo of both Rosenzweig and Jewish prophetism\n(1997: 87–100). Of course, Levinas is aware that such a\ntemporality is open to skeptical critique. He even reminds us that\nskepticism itself obeys an ethical imperative to deconstruct\nphilosophy and with it, all totalizing discourses, whether they are\nlogical or political (OBBE: 168–170). \nLevinas does not propose a solution to the conundrum of how\nnon-objective memories can be translated into objects for\nphilosophical reflection. His aim is to deconstruct dialogue down to\nits embodied condition of possibility, and this leads to a discussion\nwhich is not so unlike Husserl’s genetic inquiries into\n“proto-intentionality [Urintentionalität]”\nexplored in the 1920s. Unlike Husserl, however, he does not aim at a\nsystem consisting of levels of drives and affects formatted by higher\negoic structures (Husserl, E Manuscript III 9/5a, cited in\nhu-GDP: lixff). Yet he does exploit a difficulty that beset\nHusserl’s early phenomenology of time-consciousness, one that\nwould argue in favor of Levinas’ 1974 conception of\n“diachrony”, or the interruption that he equates with\ntranscendence-in-immanence. This was the paradox of sensation in\nrelation to intentionality that Husserl identified in Appendix 12 of\nhis lectures on internal time consciousness (Hua 10:\n 130–133).[34]\n In his 1965 essay, “Intentionality and Sensation” (DEH:\n135–150), Levinas focused on the gap (i.e., diachrony) between\nbodily sensation entering intentionality and sensation as\npre-conscious bodily processes. He recalled the paradox that the\nsensuous origins of intentionality lay outside\nintentionality’s field or reach, in the body, even as the\nongoing alterations of sensation forge our feeling of ongoing temporal\nprogression. To be explicitly experienced, sensation thus had\nto intentionalize. Yet much of its prior, bodily existence eludes our\nconsciousness. \nLevinas compared this dual, conscious-preconscious status of\nsensibility to his idea of a pre-intentional “receptivity of an\n‘other’ penetrating into the ‘same’, [in sum,\nto our intersubjective] life and not [to] ‘thought’”\n(DEH: 144). As already broached by Husserl, this sensuous\n“other” will support Levinas’ 1974 arguments for the\naffective interruptions of the even flow of time-consciousness, and\nhis claim that intersubjective affects overflow the framework of all\nrepresentational\n consciousness.[35]\n Sophie Veulemans has fruitfully compared Levinas’ diachrony\nwith Bergson’s approach to the “new” in the midst of\nduration (Veulemans 2008). Rudolf Bernet, in turn, equates the newness\nof the phenomenological instant with “the root of all alterity\nand all difference” in Levinas, which allows Bernet to urge that\nthe intersubjective investiture of the subject “will always\n[prove] unthinkable in a philosophy of consciousness” (Bernet\n2002: 92). Following his argument, phenomenology would not have\nadequately thought through the sensuous way “in which the other\nliberates the subject from its captivity within\n … immanence” (Bernet 2002: 93). \nOtherwise than Being involves an innovative discussion of\nsignification. Given Levinas’ hermeneutic insight that language\nis not merely a system of words paired up with pre-existing, objective\nrealities, but instead brings reality to light, language and time will\nhave analogous functions. That is, both make meaning possible as the\nrealization of our world. Indeed, while Heidegger had argued that\nbeing resonates in (poetic) language, as the verb “to be”,\nLevinas, as we have seen, had counter-argued for an otherwise than\nbeing that showed itself in ad-verbial meaning. Yet, if the\nrelationship between language and being is fully encompassing, even in\na sense mystical, as it is for Heidegger, then either Levinas’\notherwise than being looks like mere speculation, or it simply inheres\nin being or participates in its verb-like transcendence. Either way,\nfundamental ontology thereby proves primordial and weakens\nLevinas’ claims. Yet for the latter, transcendence in fact\npoints to the temporality that, as we have seen, already differs from\nphenomenology’s totalizing flow or the way Heidegger’s\nbeing temporalizes through Da-sein (i.e., as\nout-ahead-of-itself toward its ownmost possibility; OBBE:\n169–170, 178–182). The lapse of time between the\npre-intentional sensuous moment and its intentionalization denotes the\ntranscendence that Levinas also equates with “the Saying”\n(OBBE: 37–55). His discussion of the Saying correlates with his\ntreatment of sincerity, introduced already in Existence and\nExistents. Otherwise than Being radicalizes his notion\nof sincerity, insisting that the structure of sensibility is always as\nif punctuated by sensuous lapses. It is thanks to such time lapses\nthat we are open and able to communicate because, as we have seen,\nproximity is an affective mode that motivates dialogue. While\nall sensuous lapses are not necessarily openings to\nintersubjective communication, proximity and vulnerability are the\nloci of transcendence-in-immanence and the birth of\nsignification (whether words are actually uttered or not). For\nLevinas, there is more in living affectivity than Heidegger’s\nconception of being speaking through language captured. This is clear\nthe moment we understand signification originally as an affective\nproto-intentionality and not as some thought, already formulated, that\nthe I thereupon chooses to communicate to another (OBBE: 43). \nLevinas thus conceives language as more than denotation and\ndescription. Already verbs escape the coupling of words with things\nthat we find in the case of the noun. “In the verb of apophansis\n[predication], which is the verb properly so called, the verb\n‘to be’, essence resounds and is heard” (OBBE: 41).\n“Red reddens” without requiring conversion into\npropositions; sounds resound in music and poetry. Nevertheless, a verb\ncan be converted into a noun, thereby losing its processual\nquality.  \nThrough the ambiguousness of the logos … the verb par excellence\n[‘being’] in which essence resounds … is nominalized,\nbecomes a word designating and sanctioning identities, assembling\ntime … into a conjuncture. (OBBE: 42)  \nThus, even the verbality or event-like quality of being can take on a\nnominal form, such as in “a being”. Levinas calls\nthis convertibility “the amphibology of being and\nentities” (OBBE: 43). While this back-and-forth reference\nexpresses the danger of taking being for a thing—a danger about\nwhich Heidegger warns us—the amphibology also fails to grasp\nfully the reflexive quality of verbs like se dire, understood\nas “to say” but in a passive sense, as though one were\nsaying oneself, self-communicating. Levinas then sets\nhis ethical-hermeneutic “reduction” on the\nreflexive particle se, urging that, although being\n“speaks” through the logos, the se\npoints toward an intersubjective mode of our embodied sensuous\npassivity (OBBE: 43–45). This passivity is enigmatic because the\nse is not a verb and cannot really be made into a noun. It is\nin its enigmatic structure that the vulnerability that arises in\nproximity as if grounds signification, and words said, to another. To\nthis reflexive se, or “self”, corresponds our\npassivity, as it occurs in the temporal lapse called\n“diachrony”. Diachrony thus expresses our sincerity toward\nthe other and a certain transcendence: “the spirit hears the\necho of the otherwise” (OBBBE: 44). With the adverb\n(“otherwise”), a modalization of fleshly\ninvestiture momentarily escapes the nominalization flowing out of the\naforementioned amphibology between verbs and nouns, between being and\na being. Here we find the ultimate sense of transcendence,\nwhich Levinas compares with Merleau-Ponty’s “fundamental\nhistoricity”, those unremarked, passive bodily sedimentations\nthat make up our selfhood (OBBE: 45). \nLevinas’ later work, notably Otherwise than Being, has\nbeen characterized as hermeneutic. Focusing on the discussions of the\nother-in-the-same and passivity in that work, commentator Giuseppe\nLissa provides an apt description of Levinas’ interpretive\nproject. By investigating the depths of consciousness, by comparing\nits passivity to the process of ageing, Levinas investigates a  \nreality unknowable, but perhaps interpretable by a thinking that no\nlonger claims to be an exercise in knowledge … because this\nthinking is engaged in the search for a meaning that precedes all\nknowledge.  \nLissa concludes that Levinas intimates a meaning that, in\n“preceding [knowledge], founds it, orients it, and to some\ndegree justifies it” (Lissa 2002: 227). For him, Levinas’\nturn to hermeneutics largely dates from his abandonment of his\nphenomenology of “exteriority”, as the subtitle of\nTotality and Infinity indicates: An Essay on\nExteriority. As we have seen, insofar as the search for meaning\nunderlying intentional object-constitution (and other modes of\nintentionality) presupposes a meaning only incipiently\ngrasped—which corresponds to Heidegger’s rethinking of\nhermeneutics in light of Da-sein’s basic\nunderstanding—Levinas appears to owe a debt both to\nHeidegger’s existential\n hermeneutics[36]\n as well as to a much older, polyphonic practice of reading: Talmudic\nthought as interpretively elaborating Jewish law (Halakhah)\nand recounting and parsing narratives (Aggadah). Because this\nhermeneutics differs from that of Christian theology by giving\nsignificantly less weight to philosophical justifications of\nfaith, it is worth our turning briefly to it. \nLevinas presented twenty-three Talmudic readings in the context of the\nColloques des intellectuels juifs de langue française.\nHowever, in 1957, at the first meeting of the colloquium, he merely\nparticipated in the debates. Salomon Malka reminds us of one of his\nprofoundly hermeneutic observations:  \nJudaism is not a religion, the word doesn’t exist in Hebrew; it\nis much more than that, it is an understanding of being. The\nJews introduced into history the idea of hope and that of a\nfuture …. Moreover, Jews have the sentiment that their\nobligations toward the other person come before their obligations in\nregard to God. (Malka 2002: 42, my trans., emph. added)  \nThis remark already shows us two important things. First, that Judaism\nmight be an “understanding of being” implies that this\nunderstanding is profoundly aware of its finitude and, by extension,\nhas to be an ongoing process. It helps us grasp how it is that Levinas\nfound resources in Heidegger’s hermeneutics, both utilizing\nand criticizing its approach. Second, that our obligations to\nthe other person somehow come before duties toward God (from rituals\nto norms), and occasionally also abrogate these duties, already opens\na secular, or better, a human-oriented dimension within Judaism. \nThe relationship between Levinas’ thought, its Jewish\ninfluences, and phenomenological philosophy has given rise to multiple\nevaluations. Martin Kavka argues that “Levinas understood both\nJudaism and Western philosophy as engaging in structurally similar\nforms of thinking” (Kavka 2010: 20–21). He situates the\nstructural similarity in that “both [these intellectual\ncorpuses] consist of texts that point to what cannot be brought to\npresence” and consequently work on, or between, the dimensions\nof reference, explanation, and hermeneutic pre-comprehension (cf.\nOuaknin 1993: 225 [1995:\n 155–156]).[37]\n Yet Kavka adds that Levinas’ relationship to the Jewish canon\nis also “inherently muddy”, though it is also clear that\nthere is more than one canon, more than a single\ninterpretation thereof. Indeed, both Michael Fagenblat and Kavka agree\nthat “it is not clear … that … a ‘new\ndirection’ in Jewish philosophy is [ever] really new”\n(Kavka 2010: 21). Moreover, Fagenblat has argued that Levinas’\nethics prolongs, in a phenomenological-hermeneutic register,\n“the dispersal of [modern approaches to the] Judeo-Christian God\nin social life” (Fagenblat 2010: 196).[38]\n He also examines the hermeneutic extension that Otherwise than\nBeing gives to Totality and Infinity. Both commentators\nsuggest that Levinas’ increasingly critical stance toward the\nepistemological and foundationalist aspects of Husserlian\nphenomenology motivated him to extend his hermeneutic recourse beyond\nHeidegger’s Existenzphilosophie toward Jewish thought,\nincluding Neo-Platonic currents and Maimonides (Fagenblat 2010:\n97–110).[39],[40]\n But it can also be argued that Levinas’ hermeneutics begins\nwell before Otherwise than Being. His reinterpretation of\nbeing-in-the-world, the meaning of facticity, the creation of a\ndwelling, and even his reading of eros and the family in 1961\nentail interpretive choices, indebted to at least two significant\nhermeneutic themes: Heidegger’s interpretation of our\npre-comprehension of existence and Franz Rosenzweig’s approach\nto Jewish life in The Star of Redemption (Rosenzweig 1921\n[2005]). \nIn 1961, Levinas wrote that Rosenzweig’s Star of\nRedemption was “too often present in this book\n[Totality and Infinity] to be cited” (TI: 28), and\nnumerous are the commentaries on the presence of Rosenzweig in\nLevinas’\n work.[41]\n It is important to recall that Rosenzweig had been a scholar of Hegel\nuntil the experience of the trenches in World War I motivated his\nrethinking of idealist political philosophy and Christian universality\nmore broadly. The Star of Redemption is a complex work\nanalyzing the respective tasks of Jewish and Christian wisdom and\nritual. Peter Eli Gordon argues that Rosenzweig is  \na post-Nietzschean philosopher, in that, like Heidegger, he denies\nthat human meaning is intelligible independent of a life-context.\nTemporal hermeneutics thus replaces the transcendental search for\nessence. (Gordon 2003: 185)  \nThe same could be said of Levinas. Since he conceives temporality in\nhuman terms (as opposed to eternity or stasis), meaning\nitself can only be approached in light of time. Readers familiar with\nRosenzweig’s “new thinking” may know that he\nsituated one of the principal hermeneutic differences between Judaism\nand Christianity in the way their theologies\n‘temporalized’: Christianity being oriented around the\nlife and death of the incarnate God, an event whose occurrence lies in\nthe past; Judaism, on the other hand, being future-oriented, awaiting\nthe messiah (who does not come). \nLevinas took up the question of meaning and temporality in a way\nsomewhat different from both Rosenzweig and Heidegger. In 1961, as we\nhave seen, his phenomenology of hospitality proceeded on the\npresent-time of love of life and the encounter called the\nface-to-face. However, the place where he explicitly uses the term\n“phenomenology” therein concerns precisely a secularized\nmessianic future. This is the chapter entitled “Phenomenology of\nEros”, which deploys “a phenomenological model for the\nultimate term of our desire”, as Fagenblat puts it (2010:\n93). The argument would be this: before eros is sublimated in\ncivil society, eros and (sometimes) the family bring to light\nour concern with others in their particularity and difference,\nindependently of their biological or social roles. We can take the\nfamily as a “model” here, in the Frankfurt School’s\nsense of\n \nan intellectual construction … [whose elements] are borrowed from\nempirical experiences that have already shown their worth such that\nthe elements used appear henceforth obvious. (Broch 2008: 43)  \nThe phenomenology of eros opens a future of\n“election” within the family and perhaps beyond it.\nDespite the apparent heterosexism of his formulations, Levinas\nintroduces abiding concern for singularity and uniqueness by defining\nthe figure of paternity as the possibility of electing each son in his\nspecificity, even as the latter may serve (and clash with) his\nbrothers. Consistent with a model, the family is both figure and\nreality. It serves Levinas’ hermeneutic secularization of\nmessianic future-time through the succession of generations.\nInterestingly, eros unfolds “phenomenologically”\nin much the same way as did the proto-experience of the “there\nis” (il y a). That is, it unfolds in a darkness\noverlooked by phenomenologies that rely on light and the universal\nevidence that light enables (TI: 256). There would consequently be a\nneglected underside to the phenomenological account of\nobject-constitution, which precedes and accompanies\nintentionality’s encounter with objects. And that\nrequires hermeneutics. \nLike Fagenblat, scholars from David Banon to Marc-Alain Ouaknin have\nexplored the hermeneutic dimension of Levinas’ thought, even\nbeyond his Talmudic readings that delve into the many-voiced debates\nbetween the rabbis of the Mishna and the Gemara (the oldest and\nsubsequent transcriptions of Jewish oral traditions; Banon 1987).\nIndeed, as Ouaknin points out, in the case of Talmudic and Biblical\nhermeneutics, Levinas always considered the eminence of a\nbook—what defines it as “the Book”—to be less\nits themes than its structure. Levinas focuses “on the\nstructure of the Book of books inasmuch as it allows for exegesis\n[hermeneutics], and on its unique status of containing more than it\n contains”.[42]\n Hermeneutics is thus engendered by excesses of potential\nmeaning over senses already printed on the page, or even discerned by\nthe reception traditions of the work. It would thus be the specific\narchitecture of the book that conditions its reception. Moreover, the\nparallelisms that we have seen—between the Saying and the Said\nand between temporal diachrony and synchrony—are also\nfound at the literary level in Biblical and Talmudic texts, with their\nopenness to ongoing interpretation. Levinas even equates\n“revelation” with the call of the text to each\nreader or listener, who thereby becomes responsible for its\ninterpretation. “The Revelation as calling to the unique within\nme is the significance particular to the signifying of the\nRevelation” of the text, which is understood as dialogical to\nits core. Here we see the structural analogy between the call of the\nother and my response that begins as Saying, as opening to words\naddressed. Levinas adds,  \nthe totality of the true is constituted from the contribution of\nmultiple people, the uniqueness of each act of listening carrying the\nsecret of the text; the voice of the Revelation, as\ninflected … by each person’s ear, would be necessary to the\n‘Whole’ of the truth. (BTV: 133–134)  \nHermeneutic truth here becomes the responsibility of an open\ncommunity, as much as an invitation to participation extended to each\npossible listener. That is why Levinas could urge that Scripture be\nunderstood as a call to respond as readily as could proximity,\nsubstitution, and responsibility, all of which similarly express the\nethical investiture that results in words offered. \nLevinas’ hermeneutics might nevertheless be deemed immanent,\nconcerning one book and one community. Although commentators like\nBatnitzky find in Levinas a project for a modern politics, and thus\nfor universality, others are skeptical about her claim. Trigano\nobjects that Levinas’ ethics unfolds out of a sort of non-site,\nstarting with the category of the singular. “For Levinas”,\nhe argues,  \nit is ethically imperative to think the singular in order that the\nhorizon of the other person arise. The universal is, in effect, a\ndangerous game that can lead to totality and to the negation of the\nother person. To decide in favor of the singular is to avoid such a\ndevelopment  \nand with it, a politics (Trigano 2002: 173). In short, the original\nhermeneutic turn that Levinas gives to Husserlian and Heideggerian\nphenomenologies has left commentators with questions about the\nrelationship between an immanent hermeneutics and one concerned with\npolitics as the sphere of the universal. These questions imply\ndiscussions about politics in our time from which Levinas\nwould have refrained in his time, in the wake of the Shoah, when\npolitics seemed less important than questions of the survival and\nfuture of Jewish communities. Yet this apparent absence of politics\nexplains why Michel Haar (1991: 530) asked of Levinas whether his\nethics could really unfold outside any site, outside any positive\nreciprocity, and outside all objectivation (cited by Trigano 2002:\n175, note 79). Indeed, Trigano criticizes Levinas, urging that the\ndialectical relationship between singular experience and universal\nmeaning (and institutions) implies that philosophy should have a\nminimal relationship to politics,  \nwhich is the very field in which the disjunction between the universal\nand the singular … is established, and this disjunction—so\nfar as it is at once the separation of the same and the other and\n[yet] also the path of their alliance … is the very condition of\npossibility of the other. (Trigano 2002: 176)  \nOn Trigano’s account, it follows that Levinas’\nhermeneutics only partly responded to Jews’ post-war need for\nthe universalization of their experience, at a human level\nencompassing both theory and politics (Trigano 2002: 176). This does\nnot contradict Batnitzky’s reading, which considers\nLevinas’ œuvre as a whole. But it can certainly be\nargued that universalization in Levinas’ ethics remains largely\nformal. On this question turns the important matter of what it means\nto develop a Jewish philosophy. And it is fair to say that\n \nthe universal, the neo-Kantian ethicization of Judaism emerged in\nruins from the Shoah, the more so that the essential question of\npolitical philosophy today is that of the place of the singular within\nthe political universal. (Trigano 2002: 177)  \nIf we accept this claim, then any comparison between Levinas and a\npre-Shoah Jewish thinker goes only part way toward addressing the\nproblem of Jewish hermeneutic philosophy today. \nJacques Derrida once called Totality and Infinity a\n“treatise on hospitality” (1997 [1999: 21]). As we have\nseen, Levinas’ 1961 work approached being as war or a conflict\nof wills that persist in their existence like the philosophical\ntradition’s concept of conatus essendi (the will to\npersist in being). Neutral existence or the there-is (il\ny a) denoted indeterminate nocturnal being, which gives way to\nthe diurnal being called “the elemental” (sunlight, winds,\nrain). As noted, being in Levinas thus entails both dynamic forces and\na conception of natural processes and causality. However, hospitality,\nalso called “metaphysical desire” (TI: 33), cannot be\ngrounded on such forces, much less on a conception of the will as\nbased on drives of self-preservation or self-expansion. And, because\nhospitality is elicited by the other—and is\nnon-reciprocal—it does not presuppose an original social\nexchange, much less moral sentiments or innate emotive capacities for\nempathy or compassion. If it did, there would be no question of\nescaping a so-called natural order of existence. That is why\nLevinas—aware that the concept of nature has a debated\nhistory—characterizes both our response to the other and, in\n1974, proximity, as “pre-natural signification” (OBBE:\n68). He explains,  \n[i]n renouncing intentionality as a guiding thread toward the\neidos [formal structure] of the psyche … our analysis\nwill follow sensibility in its pre-natural signification to the\nmaternal, where, in proximity [to what is not itself], signification\nsignifies before it gets bent into perseverance in\nbeing in the midst of a Nature. (OBBE: 68, emph. added)  \nIn order to clarify this, Levinas had to develop further concepts. In\n1961, he referred to our desire for the other as\n“religion” (“the bond … established between the\nsame and the other” that does not totalize) and as\n“transascendence”. “Transcendence, like desire and\ninadequation, is necessarily a transascendence” (respectively\nTI: 41, 35). By 1974, Levinas calls “illeity” the value\nand dignity of responding to another person. He defines illeity as\n \na neologism formed with il (he) or ille, [whereby\nalterity] indicates a way of concerning me without entering into\nconjunction with me. (OBBE: 12; also 13–16, 147–162)  \nBeyond the concept of the third party introduced in Totality and\nInfinity, “illeity” also refers to something\nabsolute, even divine, in the other. We can see here how our\nresponsibility to the other person thus almost stands in the place of\nour responsibility to God, which, as we have seen, is an important\nhermeneutic dimension of Judaism. \nThe question remains, as it did already in Totality and\nInfinity: How do responsibility and transcendence thereupon enter\ninto the ongoing flow of time and the totality of being? And how does\nan investiture of this affective intensity pass into rationality? As\nin the 1961 work, we find in 1974 that the “third\nparty”—denoting both other people and the reprise of\nintentionality—similarly “looks at me through the eyes of\nthe other” (TI: 213). Here too the passage to reason, social\nexistence, and objective time occurs because the temporal lapse called\n“diachrony” is invariably reabsorbed by intentional\nconsciousness. On this point, Levinas accords Husserl his argument\nthat affects are always on the verge of becoming intentional (Hua 10:\nAppendix 12). The responsibility and fraternity, which are now\nformulated as the unfathomable other-in-the-same, still leave a\ntrace in social relations. And, faithful to his 1961 project, the\ntrace is not framed as metaphysical. It is found, rather, in our\nconcern for restorative justice, even for modest equity. This concern\nfor justice does not erase the Hobbesian or Machiavellian nature of\nhuman drives. In 1974, however, the difficulty of holding together the\npassive temporality (which Levinas likens to ageing, [OBBE: 54])\nwith the flowing time of intentional consciousness and social\nrationality, has become more obvious. Levinas inquires, “Does a\nface abide in representation and in proximity; is it\ncommunity and difference?” (OBBE: 154, emph. added).\nUndecidable, this is a question for us as well:  \nThe third party introduces a contradiction in the saying whose\nsignification before the other until then went in one direction\n[toward the singular other]. It is of itself the limit of\nresponsibility and the birth of the question: What do I have to do\nwith justice? A question of consciousness. (OBBE: 157) \nWith the return to a philosophy of consciousness and representation,\nthe indispensable figure of the trace that Levinas has introduced\nbecomes attenuated. As we have seen, to confront eventual skepticism\nabout the trace, he enacts his witness in a literary here and\nnow. His figural performance points not toward another world or to a\nbeing different from that discussed by Heidegger, so much as to the\nintensities and vulnerability of pre-conscious affectivity.\nLevinas’ writing thus appears to come down to a poetics of the\ninexpressible. Nevertheless, since he also demands that we reflect on\nintersubjectivity from a standpoint outside the face-to-face\nencounter, his work gives us a double task: conceptualization\nand the as-if of an enacted here-and-now. Still, justice does\nnot only come down to the question “what do I have to do with\njustice?” It entails an additional explanatory move that Levinas\ncannot make. This move would have to account for what the\nother means to the third party, and why third parties insist that\n“I” also receive just treatment. These are questions\nrequiring a systematic perspective, outside the now-moment in which\n“I” emerge and enact my witness, affectively invested by\nalterity (OBBE: 158). \nThe equalizing situation from which comparison, justice, and\nnormativity can be deduced is beyond Levinas’ immediate\nconcern. Such a situation is that of objective consciousness. This is,\nfor example, the approach adopted by Hegel in the Phenomenology of\nSpirit, which he calls the “for-us” or the\nexternalist standpoint (Hegel 1807 [1977: §25]). Levinas thus\nsimply marks this standpoint, which is for him a conundrum, saying,\n \n[t]he relationship with the third party is an incessant correction of\nthe asymmetry of proximity in which the face is looked at. There is\nweighing, thought, objectification … in which my anarchic\nrelationship with illeity [transcendence] is betrayed … There is\nbetrayal of my anarchic relation with illeity, but also a new\nrelationship with it: it is only thanks to God that, as a\nsubject incomparable with the other, I am approached as an other by\nthe others, that is, “for myself”. (OBBE: 158, emph.\nadded)  \nWould Levinas’ “thanks to God” then stand in the\nplace of Hegel’s “for-us” account? \nCommentators differ on the interpretation of the phrase “thanks\nto God”. In his subsequent use of the expression, Levinas sets\nthese words between quotation marks. Franck interprets the new concept\nof illeity as denoting the force of proximity and the dignity\nof my investiture by the other. It is the  \nHe [illeity] in whose trace the Thou or the face that intends and\nassigns me signifies … [But] the He … does not point toward\nanother world in which the phenomenological and ontological orders\nwould nevertheless prevail … [Rather, as Levinas says,] “it\nis the … Infinity of the absolutely other, escaping\nontology”. (Franck 2008: 109, my trans.)  \n“Illeity” thus points to an indeterminate place or source,\nthe sheer dignity of the other who faces me, or the other always\nalready motivating my saying. Yet despite this, Levinas sometimes\nextends illeity to the possibility of my receiving justice\nfrom other people. He writes, “thanks to God\n[Il] … I am approached as an other by the others”\n(OBBE: 158). But, of course, even if universal justice is\n“thanks to God”, this God is not part of\nbeing (OBBE: 162)—a claim familiar to both negative theology and\nto Maimonides’ ultimate approach to God through human action.\nLevinas is fully aware of the paradox he introduces into\n“illeity”. And he clearly knows the theological reversion\nto praxis that Maimonides proposes at the end of his\nGuide of the Perplexed: “The only positive knowledge of\nGod of which man is capable is knowledge of the attributes of\naction” \n (Fagenblat 2010: 113).[43]\n As Levinas puts it, “to know God is to know what must be\ndone” (DF: 17). It is not to know some being or even to erect a\nregulative idea. The dignity and force of illeity thus share an\nimportant connection with what we might call our enacting God\nthrough responsibility to the other or through justice. Another word\nfor this is “holiness”, whether this comes from me in the\nform of the Saying or from the others as justice toward me. \nHere lies the point at which a reading begins that bridges the\nphilosophical and the religious—above all the\nTalmudic—dimensions of Levinas’ thought. Indeed, as he put\nit in his 1966 article “Infinity” (AT: 53–76):  \nAn entire strain of contemporary philosophy, setting out from the\nirreducibility of the interpersonal to relations of objectivity,\nthematization, and knowledge, is situated in the religious tradition\nof the idea of the infinite … even when it expresses itself in a\ndeliberately and rigorously atheistic way. (AT: 76, emph.\nadded) \nThat suggests that whether we approach it atheistically or\nreligiously, the tension between interpersonal relations and\nobjectivity implies the third party and by extension a social\nrelationality which is indissociable from justice and politics. But it\nis not clear that Levinas ever decided whether politics implied above\nall war or the means toward a peaceable State. In his late essay\n“Peace and Proximity” (1984; col-BPW: 161–169),\nLevinas expressed an attitude surprisingly favorable to the idea of\nthe politics which, when the State is a liberal one, evinces palpable\naspects of the trace of responsibility in its policies.  \nIt is not without importance to know—and this is perhaps the\nEuropean experience of the twentieth century—whether the\negalitarian and just State [and its politics] in which the European is\nfulfilled … proceeds from a war of all against all—or from\nthe irreducible responsibility of the one for the other. (In Rolland,\ned. 1984, 346, my trans.)  \nOf course, the notion of a just politics has meant different things\naccording to the form the State takes, whether totalitarian,\nauthoritarian, or\n liberal.[44]\n Given his evocations of a pluralist or multilayered existence in\nTotality and Infinity (TI: 19, 80, 306), Levinas’\nargument that justice is marked by the trace of responsibility seems\nto accord relatively well with liberal theories of political justice\nand sovereignty. As is well known, Anglo-American theorists of\nsovereignty and politics emphasize that individuals live in multiple\nsocial associations, which impose a host of responsibilities on them.\nA pluralistic socio-political existence diminishes the emphasis on\nsovereignty as concentrated in the State alone. Be that as it may,\nLevinas’ notion of a trace of responsibility within justice does\nnot explain how other people, not just I, can be said to be ethically\n“invested” by responsibility. That I receive justice from\nthem thus remains “thanks to God”. Moreover, what is true\nof ethical systems may well be true of political ones. That is,\nfollowing his comprehensive comparison of Levinas’ philosophy\nwith contemporary theories of ethics, Morgan admits:  \nI do not think that Levinas would favor any particular moral\nsystem—say, some form of Kantian morality or of\nconsequentialism, insofar as it is a system. (2007: 456,\nemph. added)  \nThis may be true of any form of political regime as well, because for\nLevinas politics attempts to forge systems—as he says, to\ntotalize (TI: 15, 21, 292–305). We have seen above Rose’s\nneo-Hegelian objection that Levinas’ ethics lacks mediations\nsufficient to have real implications for politics\n (§2.3.4).\n Recently, Salanskis has nevertheless proposed a surprising\n“mediation”, found in Judaism itself, arguing that the\nlatter provides an “idealist horizon liable to interest all\nof humanity”, because it ties this horizon narratively\n“to a practical and intellectual testing\n‘laboratory’, that of the life of a people”\n(Salanskis 2016: 129, note 68). This claim suggests that there is a\nproto-political project in Biblical and Talmudic Judaism, though\nSalanskis leaves unexplored the further implications of his\n“laboratory”. As to the political implications of the\nTalmud’s pluralism of rabbinic voices, which is part of\nSalanskis’ laboratory, Levinas does at times emphasize the\nimportance of Jewish thought entering into “universal\nhistory”, even while promoting responsibility for others and the\nethics of messianic awaiting (DF: 96). For example, in his Talmudic\nreading entitled “Messianic Texts” (1962), he justifies\nthe creation of a Jewish State on the basis of the possibility of\nprotecting both messianic patience and a Talmudic education to\nresponsibility, despite the violence implied by Israel becoming\none State among others, within universal and secular history\n(also see Morgan 2016: 256–265, responding to Kavka 2015). \nLet us focus for a moment more directly on this question of justice in\nJewish thought. Insofar as we can speak of one Jewish\nphilosophical tradition, notably a modern one, the question of justice\nforms the core of its approach to the prophetic message. In\nthat respect it would certainly have a political dimension; or, at the\nleast, a social-existential one. It may be that to answer the question\nof the politics (in the minimal sense of State policies) liable to\nemerge from Levinas’ ethics requires that we pay close attention\nto his philosophical anthropology, i.e., to his conception of\nthe human condition or what it means to be a human being. Recently,\nSarah Hammerschlag has returned to Levinas’ captivity notebooks\nin which he jotted his wartime insights into Judaism as he lived it\nthen:  \nJ. [might be compared to] a splinter in the flesh. One might live\nwithout it, but if one didn’t have [this source of suffering],\nmy life [would be deprived] of its acuity … or fallen back into\ninfancy. (LO1: 172, my trans.)  \nThis conception of a Jewish “anthropology” corresponds not\nto particular Jews, but to our human condition when we understand it\nas a condition largely received, passively and without our\nexplicit choice. As Hammerschlag and Fagenblat have urged, this human\npathos, consistent with a pluralistic ontology, might well be\napproached as an existential category (Hammerschlag 2012:\n 389–419).[45]\n This too is why Levinas characterized Judaism as “an\nunderstanding of being”, rather than as a religion. Yet this\ncategory may surprise us if we overlook the fact that a definitive\npart of our existence does comes from without, i.e., through the\ninternalization of the life of our community, its founding texts, but\nalso through social and political characterizations of us\n(antisemitism, racism, sexism). \nApproached as unbidden passivity, of course, the existential category\ncalled Judaism raises the question of other passive ascriptions and\ntheir implications for the question of what it means to be a\nhuman being. If, by 1974, politics and the third party are largely\nsynonyms for “humanity” for Levinas, then we must conclude\nthat politics has, by extension, become more for him than the conflict\nand strife he described in his preface to Totality and\nInfinity (TI: 21–25). Politics would have to take seriously\na pluralistic humanism, as well as the condition of passive\nascriptions including racism. The implication is that one may\nsometimes have a choice, in one’s actions, about whether\npolitics is indeed a war of all against all or the site in which\ntraces of justice toward the other can be demanded. However that may\nbe, some commentators have raised the concern that\n“humanity” for Levinas looks basically like\nHusserl’s rationalist ideal of humanity (Husserl 1954 [1970:\n275], cited by McGettigan 2006: 16). This would be the humanity of\nEurope, and beneath that, one flowing out of the intertwined\nvoices of “Athens” and\n “Jerusalem”.[46]\n To be sure, the Biblical prophets demanded justice (and repentance)\nfrom their wayward communities. But political justice requires a\npublic space, an agora in which the agorein (public\nspeaking) gives rise to categories of thought\n(kat’agorein means to accuse publicly). \nThis dual preoccupation with justice as rectitude, and justice as\ncivic virtue, seems to suggest that together Athens and Jerusalem give\nus a comprehensive approach to politics, as both practice and ideal.\nDrabinski and Fred Moten have questioned this universality (Drabinski\n2011: 165–196), and with it the category of\n“being-Jewish”, in favor of an emphasis on the passivity\nintrinsic to a multiplicity of human situations, including\nrace, ethnicity, and gender. Moreover, as Moten cautions, passivity\ncan be readily observed in our relations to things rather\nthan persons. He thus adds that the Bible and the Greeks, although\noften presented as “the whole world”, thereby become a\nteleological reflection that expresses an unacknowledged European\nmalaise, wherein the non-European receives the status of a\nmere object (Moten 2018: 9, 11). Attributing this to the transcendence\ntoward-the-world of phenomenological intentionality, which shares some\nof the blind spots of the colonial enterprise, Moten discusses the\nobject-like passivity of being on the receiving end of multiple\nracisms, including Levinas’ own “unintended racism”.\nIf we take his concern seriously, then passivity as a category of\nbeing-human strains against being attributed to Jews alone. In turn,\nthis raises the philosophical-anthropological question of situational\npassivities, the very idea of humanity, and those “beings”\nthat inhabit worlds unacknowledged by the European tradition (Moten\n2018: 17). While this is a critique of Levinas, Moten also invites us\nto expand the latter’s anthropological category of being-Jewish,\nand to ask ourselves what kind of politics might flow out of such an\n expansion.[47] \nSubsequent to Otherwise than Being,Levinas’ works\nreturn to and refine his major themes. These works include\nTranscendence and Intelligibility (1984), In the Time of\nthe Nations (1988), Entre Nous (1991), and Alterity\nand Transcendence (1995), all of which are collections of essays\nfrom various periods between 1951 and 1989. However, the first of\nthese collections to appear, entitled Of God Who Comes to\nMind (1982), contains the important essay “God and\nPhilosophy” (1975; OGCM: 55–78), which is a critical\nconfrontation with the God of Descartes and Malebranche, and a subtle\ndebate with Heidegger. This essay is followed by the transcript of a\ntwo-hour discussion with professors from the University of Leyden\n(OGCM: 79–99), in which social problems infrequently addressed\nby Levinas are\n raised.[48]\n Despite the wide temporal gamut run by these publications, we find\nfew new developments, other than a clearer resolve to address the\nambiguity intrinsic to the signifier “God” (OGCM:\n§§10–13, 17–19), and the verbal dynamics of\nbeing (corresponding to Heidegger’s Wesen), henceforth\ncharacterized by Levinas’ neologism\n“essance” (OGCM: 43–51). \nHowever, Franck has detected a profound divergence in these new\ndevelopments. In a highly sophisticated reading of the essays and\ninterviews written or given after Otherwise than Being, he\nnotes that the tension between the two aforementioned conceptions of\njustice (that of 1961 and that of 1974) has come to look like an\nepistemological inconsistency. This inconsistency is due to\nLevinas’ later choice to hold justice and (empirical) social\nlife at a significant distance from each other. Indeed, by\nprogressively aligning justice with transcendence, Levinas runs into\nan important difficulty after 1974. That is, either justice belongs to\nresponsibility from the outset (1961), whereupon the “third\nparty” refers simply to the tendency of intentional\nconsciousness to reconnect any sensuous gaps in itself, or\nresponsibility and transcendence firstly require justice in\norder to be pondered and communicated. In other words, for Franck,\neither justice and responsibility are co-originary, in which case\nresponsibility cannot leave a trace in justice and being, or\nresponsibility itself presupposes justice, a constituted\nworld, and linguistic concepts. In the first case, that of aligning\nresponsibility and justice, the third party would simply denote\neveryday consciousness (TI). In the second case, justice would in fact\ngravitate toward illeity, the “He-ness” of the absent God\n(OBBE and after). Once again, in the first case and in terms of lived\ntime, the third party is indeed largely simultaneous with the other,\ngiven our social life and context. As Franck explains, we clearly live\nin society and any phenomenological description must operate\nwithin reflection, which is also the domain called the third party.\nBut in the second case, if we hold the third party close to illeity,\nthen the question why I receive justice “for\nmyself” from others can only be answered\nquasi-theologically, as “thanks to God”. Yet this second\noption shifts our attention from justice within social life toward the\nenigma posed by the fact that I do receive justice from\nothers thanks to some near-miraculous concern of theirs for me. But\nthen, should justice for all refer to our social and legal contexts or\nrather to an absolute called illeity? Mobilizing extensive arguments,\nFranck shows that this difficulty comes into a crude light in the late\nworks. And indeed, if the later Levinas chooses to hold these two\nconceptions together, then justice is both social and in some sense\ndivine, like a godly justice or a theopolitics (Franck 2008: 239). If\nit is the latter, then Levinas’ hermeneutics of an ethical\n“otherwise than being” just amounts to an abstraction\nrooted essentially in theology.  \nAs if anticipating Franck’s strong, structural critique, Levinas\nstaked out a surprising claim for the social simultaneity of the other\nand the third party in a 1982 interview entitled “Philosophy,\nJustice, and Love” (EN: 103–122). He there argues,  \nI do not live in a world where there is but one ‘first\ncome’. There is always a third [party] in the world; he too\nis my other, my neighbor. Consequently, it matters to me to know\nwhich of the two passes first: is the one not the persecutor of the\nother? Must men, [although understood] as incomparable, not be\ncompared? Justice is thus prior here to taking the\nother’s fortunes upon oneself. (EN: 103–104, emph. added)\n \nThe supposed priority of the other would thus depend on one’s\napproach, which can be ethical or socio-juridical. Indeed, the problem\nof priority is further complicated by the fact that, as early as 1974,\nLevinas cited Isaiah 57:19, deliberately inverting the order of the\nterms, “neighbor” and “the one far away”. He\nthus writes, “Peace to the neighbor and to the distant\none” (OBBE: 157). Eleven years later, he corrects his citation\nin an interview entitled “On Jewish Philosophy” (1985;\nITN: 167–183): “‘Peace, peace, to him that is far\noff and to him that is near’, says the Eternal”. And he\nadds,  \nOutside the one who is near … he who is far off compels\nrecognition. Outside the other there is the third party. He is\nalso an other, also a neighbor. But which is the closest\nproximity? […] There must be knowledge of such things! (ITN:\n172, emph. added) \nAs a critical reader of Levinas, Franck appears to be the only\ncommentator who has raised Levinas’ later remarks to the status\nof epistemological inconsistency. Franck argues cogently that if we\nmust be able to determine whether the third party is also an other, or\na persecutor of others, or a criminal, then justice must\nprecede responsibility, rather than the reverse. That is,\nrather than responsibility grounding justice thanks to the trace it\nleaves within justice, the latter must have priority (2008,\n240–242). Franck’s objection has important implications\nfor the relationship between ethics and politics in Levinas. We live\nin human society, and we cannot escape that, he says. But does this\nnot imply that it is impossible to set justice decisively outside\npolitics, and as if outside ontology, as Levinas’ later work\nseems to do? That also means that we can never separate the sincerity\nthat Levinas calls “the Saying” (or le dire) from\nthe very words (le dit) that express and describe it. We\ntherefore need words, and intentionality, to make what Levinas\ncharacterized as the pre-thematic into a theme (OBBE: 99). We even\nneed words to stabilize the affect called sincerity or the Saying.\nFailing words, sincerity and with it proximity are simply\nabstractions, philosophical constructions. There is nothing wrong\nper se with such philosophical constructs, if that is what\nthese concepts are. It is illegitimate, however, to argue that they\nprecede intentional consciousness and even reflection. \nNow, given Otherwise than Being’s\nrapprochement between the third party and illeity, must the\nthird party not admit two distinct, even irreconcilable senses? The\n1961 sense would still refer to social existence and the moderation of\nresponsibility, while the 1974 sense would henceforth point to a\nradically absent Il, also called “God”. This too\nhas consequences for the question of justice—i.e., whether it is\nprimary to Levinas’ existential ethics, or secondary and largely\nderivative from responsibility. As we know, the Jewish tradition, and\nothers as well, holds the judge responsible for fair decisions; this\nspecialist of laws is also a member of the community and must obey the\nLaw he adjudicates. This is more than simply a platitude; the\njudge’s dual status casts light on the competing priorities of\nresponsibility versus justice. To explain his positions Levinas recurs\nto Psalm 82: “God stands in the divine assembly, among the\ndivine beings. He pronounces judgment”. In other words, only if\nilleity refers to a transcendent absolute, viz., “God in the\ndivine assembly”, can the third party (understood as the others\nor society) be raised above an everyday social function and confer on\njustice something like a regulative idea able to preserve a trace of\ntranscendence. \nLevinas’ reference to Psalm 82 is less surprising than we might\nsuppose. Echoing Carl Schmitt’s Political Theology,\nFagenblat points out, firstly, that all the important concepts in\nmodern statehood theory are secularized religious ideas. But,\nsecondly, the secularization process does not stop with statehood\ntheory, “a similar phenomenon applies to secular moral\nconcepts” (Fagenblat 2010: xi, emph. added). \nIn short, “God”\nis the crucial name for an absolute, indispensable to justice\nunderstood as an ongoing project. To be sure, for Franck, the\nreference to a “God” who judges is less a problem of\nsecularization than a reason why it is impossible to argue\nfor the priority of responsibility over justice. And this is\ntrue whether the priority is defined as ontological or\npractical. But Franck fails to acknowledge that Levinas is aware of\nthis tension. In “Philosophy, Justice, and Love”, Levinas\ndraws a complex portrait of the third party as “God” based\non a new, and crucial, distinction between the meaning of\n“God” as Elohim and “God” as the\nTetragrammaton (YHWH; EN:\n 108).[49]\n In the rabbinic tradition, Elohim, God of justice, first\ncreated the world. That world did not survive by itself; that is,\nwithout the “supplement” provided by YHWH, the God of\nmercy. Hence, the necessity of a second creation where justice was\nmore than equal treatment. \nGiven the mythic alignment of Elohim with justice, and YHWH\nwith mercifulness, Levinas argues that illeity has two\npossible modalizations: justice or equity; mercy or compassion. The\npriority of one God thus depends on the perspective we adopt: justice\nwould belong to ontology, compassion to an ethical perspective. For\nFagenblat, the ethical priority emerges as the possibility of creating\nand safeguarding meaning—by extension, as creation tout\ncourt (2010: 44–53). \nThat is, in Biblical symbolism, when read in the\nrabbinic tradition, a world created first on justice (as equality and\ncomparison) does not survive, because demands for equality (and with\nthem, for blind justice) are unceasing and do not admit an outside or\ntranscendent term allowing for considerations beyond bilateral\ncomparison. It is the transcendent term, the outside as it were, that\nmotivates justice to strive asymptotically towards an idea. That is\nwhy Levinas observes that being human implies that we are certainly\nborn into a social world, a world of many others and third parties.\nBut we are sustained, and individuated, by mercy. Moreover, mercy\nrepresents, for justice, the trace of responsibility. This becomes\nclear only when one reads Levinas’ philosophy together with his\nTalmudic texts. \nFor this and other reasons, the all-important question of the priority\nof responsibility as against justice must be approached as a complex\none, in part dependent on lived circumstances. From the\n“metaphysical” perspective that Levinas defined as desire\nfor the other in Totality and Infinity (TI: 39),\nresponsibility and proximity come first (EN: 107–108). From the\nperspective of practice and our living-in-society, justice stands\ncloser to ethics and may sometimes precede it. Gérard Bensussan\nhas pondered this question in light of the Christian tradition in the\nWest, for which Judaism already represents an alterity—in text\nand in act; for example, when the Passover seder re-enacts the escape\nfrom enslavement in Egypt, it ritually recalls: “strangers we\nwere, and thus, strangers we are”, even now (Bensussan\n2008: 78). A more rigorously philosophical reckoning may require that\nthe relationship between the two perspectives, justice and mercy, be\nfurther clarified. Be that as it may, this is one point on which the\nJewish writings of Levinas enrich, even ground, his philosophical\narguments. \nCommentators have differed on the comparative importance of\nLevinas’ major works, Totality and Infinity and\nOtherwise than Being. Some have urged that we see in them two\nsides of a single coin: that of responsibility experienced in the\nface-to-face encounter and that of the insistence of an affective\ntrace that interrupts flowing time as conceived by classical\nphenomenology (Peperzak 1993: 7). Other commentators have argued that\nOtherwise than Being is Levinas’ magnum\n opus,[50]\n a study on the intersubjective pre-conditions of language indebted\nto, yet diverging from, Heidegger’s investigations of the poetic\nlogos (in which man dwells and being is intimated; Heidegger\nhe-EHP: 59–64). As we have seen, Derrida called Totality and\nInfinity a “treatise on hospitality” (see\n §2.4.1 above)\n and devoted, in sum, more attention to it than to Otherwise than\nBeing, although the latter work was in part a response to\nDerrida’s criticisms in “Violence and Metaphysics”\n(Derrida 1964 [1978]). There is little question that the novelty of\nOtherwise than Being lies in its three innovations: (1) the\nanalyses and tropes for transcendence-in-immanence (recurrence,\nproximity, obsession, persecution, and substitution); (2) the\ndeconstruction of language understood as the site in which existence\nis said and explained, and (3) Levinas’ “wager” of\nstepping out of philosophical reasoning into a performative register\nthat both “says” and “unsays” itself by turns\n(OBBE: 167). \nDespite these innovations, Levinas’ philosophical project\nremains largely constant: to rethink the meaning of existence in\nterms of the ethical transcendence of the other. To that end, he\nconsistently revisited Husserl’s phenomenological method. He\nreconceived Heidegger’s ontological difference as an irreducible\nseparation between being and the good we enact. He had extensive,\noften undeclared recourse to the profound, anti-totalizing intuitions\nof religious life found in Franz Rosenzweig’s new thinking. By\nreason of his opposition to systems-thought, Levinas never adhered\nuncritically to any one philosophy.  \nA common thread runs through his philosophy and his Talmudic readings.\nTranscendence is one of his words for the spontaneity of\nresponsibility for another person. Responsibility is experienced in\nconcrete life and is variously expressed, from words like “here\nI am” to apologies and self-accounting. This is the case,\nLevinas argues, even before a de facto command is heard or\nreflected on. This surprising proposition hearkens to the debated\nmeaning of Jews “receiving the Torah before knowing what was\nwritten in it” (NTR: 42–43). Levinas names this\nresponsiveness Platonically the “Good beyond being”. We\nperform that good, that trace of the infinite, because\ninstances of answering to or for another are everyday events, though\nthey may not appear typical of natural or self-interested behaviors.\nAbove all, we do not choose to be responsible. Responsibility\narises as if elicited, before we begin to think about it, by the\napproach of the other person. Because this theme is found in his\nphilosophy as well as in his interpretations of Talmudic passages,\nLevinas’ thought has, at times, left both Talmud scholars and\nphilosophers dissatisfied. For some Talmudists, his thought seems\nsecularly humanistic, with “infinity” suggesting a\nclandestine concept of divinity. No stranger to Mishna and Gemara\n(Talmud), his interpretations are less preoccupied with traditional\ninter- and intra-textuality, than with the ethical content of\nthe teachings therein. To philosophers skeptical of him,\nLevinas’ thought reinterprets Heidegger’s hermeneutic\ncircle of facticity in a metaphysical vein. Indeed, its\nanti-foundationalist approach to responsibility, as the pre-reflective\nstructure of the embodied, intersubjective “self”\n(soi), appears to these critics to lie between phenomenology\nand religious thought, even if it lacks specific dogmatic commitments.\nAs we have seen, in his later philosophy, the seemingly metaphysical\nconcept of illeity expresses my emotive experience of a\n“power” or an affective excess greater than I can contain.\nIn this way, it also resembles Descartes’ “light so\nresplendent” (Descartes 1641 [1911], Meditation V). But\nit is precisely in these tensions, between the Jewish religious and\nphilosophical traditions, on the one hand, and his\nphenomenological-existential thinking-of-the-other, on the other hand,\nthat Levinas’ originality lies.","contact.mail":"bettina.bergo@umontreal.ca","contact.domain":"umontreal.ca"}]
