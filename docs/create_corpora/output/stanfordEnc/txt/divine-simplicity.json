Vallicella","entry":"divine-simplicity","body.text":"\n\n\nAccording to the classical theism of Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas and\ntheir adherents, God is radically unlike creatures and cannot be\nadequately understood in ways appropriate to them. God is simple in\nthat God transcends every form of complexity and composition familiar\nto the discursive intellect. One consequence is that the simple God\nlacks parts. This lack is not a deficiency but a positive feature. God\nis ontologically superior to every partite entity, and his\npartlessness is an index thereof. Broadly construed,\n‘part’ covers not only spatial and temporal parts (if any)\nbut also metaphysical ‘parts’ or ontological\nconstituents. To say that God lacks metaphysical parts is to\nsay inter alia that God is free of matter-form composition,\npotency-act composition, and existence-essence composition. There is\nalso no real distinction between God as subject of his attributes and\nhis attributes. God is thus in some sense\nidentical to each of his attributes, which implies that each\nattribute is identical to every other one. God is omniscient, then,\nnot in virtue of instantiating or exemplifying omniscience —\nwhich would imply a real distinction between God and the property of\nomniscience — but by being omniscience. And the same\nholds for each of the divine omni-attributes: God is what he\nhas as Augustine puts it in The City of God, XI, 10.\nAs identical to each of his attributes, God is identical to his\nnature. And since his nature or essence is identical to his existence,\nGod is identical to his existence. This is the doctrine of divine\nsimplicity (DDS). But how are we to understand ‘identity’ in this\ncontext? Is it an equivalence relation governed by the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals? Or is it some ‘looser’ form of\nsameness? These are important questions but ones that cannot be\naddressed in this entry except in passing. \n\n\nDDS is represented not only in classical Christian theology, but also\nin Jewish, Greek, and Islamic thought. It is to be understood as an\naffirmation of God’s absolute transcendence of creatures. God is not\nonly radically non-anthropomorphic, but radically unlike creatures in\ngeneral, not only in respect of the properties he possesses, but also\nin his manner of possessing them. It is not just that God has\nproperties no creature has; the properties he has he has in a way\ndifferent from the way any creature has any of its properties. God has\nhis properties by being them. Unique in his mode of\nproperty-possession, God is also unique in his mode of existence and\nin his modal status. He is not just one necessary being among others.\nHis metaphysical necessity, unlike that of other necessary beings, is\ngrounded in his simplicity. The actually infinite set of natural\nnumbers is presumably a necessary being, along with each of its\nmembers, but neither set nor members are necessary in virtue of being\nontologically simple. So while one may say that the simple God exists\nin all metaphysically possible worlds, that is no account of his\nunique mode of necessity, which is grounded in his simplicity. God is\nnecessary because he is simple and not because he exists in all\nmetaphysically possible worlds. And while one may say that the simple\nGod is or exists, God is not an existent among existents or a being\namong beings, but Being (esse) itself in its prime instance\nand in this respect different from every other being (ens).\nUnique in all these ways, God is uniquely unique. He is not\nunique as one of a kind, but unique in transcending the distinction\nbetween kind and member of a kind. God is unique in his very mode of\nuniqueness. The simple God, we could say, differs not only in his\nattributes, but also in his very ontological structure, from any and\nall created beings.\n\nWhat could motivate such a strange and seemingly incoherent doctrine?\nOne central consideration in its favor derives from the Anselmian\ndefinition of God as maximally perfect, as that than which no greater\ncan be conceived. A God who was less than maximally perfect would not\nbe an absolute reality and an appropriate object of worship. A God who\nwas less than ultimate and absolute would be an idol. Now an absolute\nreality must be a se, from itself, and so not dependent on\nanything distinct from itself either for its nature or for its\nexistence. If God had properties in the way creatures have them,\nhowever, he would be distinct from them and so dependent on them. This\nis the case whether one thinks of a property of x as a\nconstituent of x, or as an entity external to x to\nwhich x is tied by the asymmetrical relation (or\nnonrelational tie) of instantiation. If the properties of x\nare constituents or ontological (proper) parts of x, then\nx will depend on them in the same way that any whole composed\nof parts depends on its parts. But if x is tied to its\nproperties by the asymmetrical relation of instantiation, it is still\nthe case that x will depend on them: if x is\nF in virtue of x’s instantiation of F-ness,\nthen F-ness is a logically prior condition of x’s\nbeing F. In sum, the divine aseity would seem to require that\nGod be rather than have his attributes. \nOne can also arrive at the simplicity doctrine via the divine\nnecessity. As maximally perfect, as that than which no greater can be\nconceived, God must be a metaphysically necessary being, one that\ncannot not exist. A necessary being is one whose possibility entails\nits existence, and whose nonexistence entails its impossibility. But\nwhat could be the ground of this necessity of existence if not the\nidentity in God of essence and existence, possibility and actuality?\nSaying that God exists in all metaphysically possible worlds does not\nprovide a ground, but merely a graphic Leibnizian representation, of\nthe notion of necessary being. The possible worlds representation also\ndoes not distinguish the necessity of God from that of an abstract\nobject such as the set of even primes. God is not just another\nnecessary being among necessary beings; he is uniquely necessary as\nthe source and ground of everything distinct from himself, including\nall non-divine necessary beings. Indeed, God is uniquely unique, i.e.,\nunique in his mode of uniqueness, in that he is not one of a kind, or\nnecessarily one of a kind, but unique in transcending the\nkind-instance difference altogether. A divine being cannot possess\ncontingent modal status: if God exists, then he is necessary, and if\nhe does not exist, then he is impossible. So if God exists, then there\nis a very tight connection between the divine nature and the divine\nexistence. The simplicity doctrine in its traditional and strongest\nform assays this ‘tightness’ as identity. The divine\nsimplicity thus grounds the divine necessity. God is necessary because\nhe is simple. It is easy to see that the divine simplicity also\ngrounds God’s possession of essential properties. God has his\nattributes essentially because he is identical to his attributes.\nNothing is more essential to a thing than something to which it is\nidentical. \nA third motivation for DDS lies in the fact that it provides a\nsolution to the ancient Euthyphro dilemma first presented by Plato in\nhis eponymous dialog. Does God command the good because it is good,\nand forbid the bad because it is bad, or is the good good and the bad\nbad because God commands/forbids it? If the former, God’s willing\nwould be subject to an external standard logically antecedent to God\nto the detriment of the divine sovereignty. If the latter, the content\nof morality would be arbitrary because subject to God’s free will. On\nDDS, however, the dilemma is a false alternative. If God is goodness\nitself in its prime instance, then he is not subject to a standard; he\nis the standard. And if God, being simple, just is his willing, then\nhe cannot will anything other than the good and the appearance of\narbitrarity vanishes. See Feser (2009, 129) who draws on Stump\n(2003). \nNote that while the traditional approach to divine simplicity is in\nterms of identity, this approach is open to what Dolezal (2011,\n136–144) calls the “harmonist challenge” according\nto which, on one variation, that of Immink (1987), the divine\nattributes are not identical but necessarily equivalent. Dolezal also\ncounts Swinburne (1994) among the harmonists. Harmonism will not be\ndiscussed further in this entry. See Dolezal (2011) for competent\ncritique of harmonism and for an overall excellent defense of DDS.\n \nBesides perfection and necessity, immateriality, eternity, and\nimmutability also seem to point to simplicity as their ground. Because\nGod is simple, he cannot have parts and so cannot have material or\ntemporal parts. And because God is simple, he cannot harbor any\nunrealized potentialities, and so must be immutable. The centrality of\nDDS to medieval philosophical theology is shown by its position in the\norder of topics in Aquinas’ Summa Theologica. It occurs as\nQuestion 3 right after Question 2 on the existence of God. \nThe very notion of an ontologically simple being will be dismissed by\nmany as self-evidently incoherent. Among theists, there are those who\nwill argue that DDS does not cohere with some other theistic\ncommitment such as the doctrine of the Trinity. The main concern of\nthis article is not with such intramural coherence questions, but with\nthe question of whether or not DDS is coherent at all. This broad\ncoherence question is not whether the doctrine is true, or even\npossibly true; the question is whether it is possible for us to think\nit without obvious contradictions and category mistakes. Ultimately,\nthe broad coherence question concerns the sort of general metaphysical\nframework that would allow DDS to be discussed as a live option as\nopposed to being dismissed as incoherent from the outset. \nA central threat to coherence is the question of how a thing could be\nidentical to its properties. Alvin Plantinga (1980, 47) maintains that\nif God is identical to his properties, then he is a property, and they\nare a single property, in which case God is a single property. Given\nthat properties are abstract entities, and abstracta are causally\ninert, then God is abstract and causally inert — which is of\ncourse inconsistent with the core tenet of classical theism according\nto which God is the personal creator and sustainer of every contingent\nbeing. No abstract object is either a person or a causal agent. No\nabstract object can be omniscient, or indeed know anything at all.\nMore fundamentally, no abstract entity can be identical to any\nconcrete entity. God as person and creator is concrete. Abstracta and\nconcreta are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. Nothing can be\nboth. Objections similar to Plantinga’s have been raised by Richard\nGale (1991, 23 ff.), William Hasker (2016, 703) and others. \nIt is easy to see that Plantinga-style objections will not appear\ndecisive to those who reject his metaphysical framework. Indeed,\nPlantinga’s accusations of category mistake may strike students\nof the main medieval proponents of DDS as so many misunderstandings based on a foisting of a foreign framework on their ideas.\nPlantinga, along with many other philosophers, thinks of individuals\nand properties as belonging to disjoint categories connected by an\nexternal relation of exemplification. Individuals are causally\nefficacious concreta whereas properties are causally impotent\nabstracta. Such an approach to ontology renders the divine simplicity\ninconceivable from the outset. For if God is a concrete individual and\nhis nature (conceived perhaps as the conjunction of his\nomni-attributes) is an abstract property, then the general ontology\nrules out any identity or sameness of God and his nature. Any such\nidentity or sameness would violate the separateness of the two categories.\nTo identify an unexemplifiable concretum with an exemplifiable\nabstractum would amount to a category mistake. At most, a\nPlantinga-style approach allows for God’s exemplification of\nhis nature where the (first-level) exemplification relation, unlike\nthe identity relation, is asymmetrical and irreflexive and so enforces\nthe non-identity of its relata. In short, if God exemplifies his\nnature, then God must be distinct from his nature, just as Socrates\nmust be distinct from his nature. God’s nature is then something he\nhas, by exemplification, not, pace Augustine, something he is\nby some form of identity or sameness.  \nSince a Plantinga-type approach to ontology rules out DDS from the\noutset, no sophisticated adherent of the doctrine will adopt such an\napproach. The DDS defender will embrace an ontology that\naccommodates an ontologically simple being. Indeed, as Nicholas\nWolterstorff (1991) notes, classical proponents of DDS such as Aquinas\nhad a radically different ontological style, one that allowed for the\ncoherent conceivability of DDS. They did not think of individuals as\nrelated to their properties as to abstracta external to them, but as\nhaving properties as ontological constituents. They, and some atheist\ncontemporaries as well, think in terms of a “constituent\nontology” as opposed to what Wolterstorff calls a\n“relation ontology” or what might be called a\n“nonconstituent ontology”. Bundle theories are\ncontemporary examples of constituent ontology. If properties are\nassayed as tropes and a concrete particular as a bundle of tropes,\nthen these tropes or abstract particulars are parts of concrete\nparticulars when suitably bundled. Properties so assayed are brought\nfrom Plato’s heaven to earth. The togetherness or compresence of\ntropes in a trope bundle is not formal identity but a kind of\ncontingent sameness. Thus a redness trope and a sweetness trope in an\napple are not identical but contingently compresent as parts of the same\nwhole. A model such as this allows for an extrapolation to a necessary\ncompresence of the divine attributes in the case of God. Aquinas, the\ngreatest of the medieval proponents of DDS, is of course an\nAristotelian, not a trope theorist. But he too is a constituent\nontologist. Form and matter, act and potency, and essence and\nexistence are constituents of primary substances. Essence and\nexistence in sublunary substances such as Socrates are really distinct\nbut inseparably together. Their unity is contingent. This model\npermits an extrapolation to the case of a being in which essence and\nexistence are necessarily together or compresent. Constituent ontology, as\nmurky as it must remain on a sketch such as this, at least provides a\nframework in which DDS is somewhat intelligible as opposed to a\nPlantinga-style framework on which DDS remains wholly unintelligible.\nThe arguments for DDS amount to arguments against the nonconstituent\nontological framework. \nAdopting a constituent ontology will not, by itself, bring DDS into\nthe clear. Suppose properties (whether assayed as universals or as\ntropes) are ontological parts of the ordinary (thick) particulars that\nhave them and that this having is understood quasi-mereologically as a\nkind of part-whole relation rather than as an exemplification relation\nthat spans the abstract-concrete divide. This would still leave us\nwith the puzzle of how a whole could be identical to one of its proper\nparts, and the related puzzle of how two distinct proper parts could\nbe identical to each other. Construing properties as parts of the\nthings that have them does not, by itself, show how there could be a\nsimple being. But if properties are parts, then at least Plantinga’s\ndismissal of DDS on the ground that nothing concrete can be identical\nto anything abstract can itself be dismissed. \nWhat is needed to render DDS coherent is a particular version of\nconstituent ontology according to which a thing’s nature is a unitary\nconcrete item and a constituent of the thing. In the case of material\nbeings, the nature will be together with some individuating\nconstituent such as signate or designated matter (materia\nsignata). Material beings are individuated and diversified by\ntheir signate matter. Thus Socrates and Plato, though the same in\nnature, differ numerically in virtue of their different portions of\nmateria signata. Matter makes them individuals, and matter\nmakes them numerically diverse individuals. God, however, being\nimmaterial, is not individuated by anything distinct from his nature,\nand so can be said to be a self-individuating nature. As\nself-individuating, there is no real distinction between God and his\nnature. In Thomist terms, in God nature and suppositum are\nidentical.(ST I, q. 3, art. 3) The divine nature is not an\nabstract object related across an ontological chasm to a concrete\nindividual;the divine nature is a self-individuating concrete unitary\nnature. For Plantinga, the nature of a thing is a conjunctive property\nthe conjuncts of which are those properties the thing exemplifies in\nevery possible world in which it exists. On this approach, the divine\nnature is ‘cobbled together’ or constructed out of God’s essential\nproperties. But then the divine nature is logically and ontologically\nposterior to those properties. Clearly, no defender of DDS will think\nof natures in this way. He will think of the divine nature as\nlogically and ontologically prior to the properties, and of the\nproperties as manifestations of that unitary nature, a nature the\nradical unity of which cannot be made sense of on Plantinga’s\napproach. None of this is spectacularly clear, and plenty of questions\nremain; but it is not obviously incoherent as DDS would be on the\napproach of Plantinga. And our question, you will recall, is\nconcerned solely with coherence. \nOne can see from the foregoing that Plantinga-type objections are not\ncompelling. The reason, again, is that DDS cannot be made sense of within a nonconstituent ontology.  It can be made sense of, assuming it can be made sense of, only within a constituent ontology, the style of ontology presupposed by its main defender, Aquinas. A nonconstituent ontologist like Plantinga may be\nrepresented as arguing by Modus Ponens: If God exemplifies his nature,\nthen he is distinct from it; God exemplifies his nature; ergo, God is\ndistinct from his nature, and DDS is false. But the constituent\nontologist is justified in switching to Modus\nTollens: If God exemplifies his nature, then he is distinct from it;\nGod is not distinct from his nature; ergo, God does not exemplify his\nnature but has his nature by being identical with it. \nWe have just seen how God can be identical to his nature where\n“can be” is elliptical for “can be conceived without\nobvious incoherence.” But there are two other problems that also\npose a serious threat to the coherence of DDS. One concerns how God\ncan be identical to his existence, the other how the divine attributes\ncan be identical to each other. \nTaking the first question first, on a Plantinga-style approach, it\nmakes no sense to say that God is identical either to existence or to\nhis existence. For Plantinga, existence is a first-level\nproperty that everything exemplifies. Given that\n“exemplifies” picks out a two-term irreflexive and\nasymmetrical relation, God cannot be identical with existence. Nor can\nGod be identical to his existence. The latter is presumably a\nstate of affairs, an abstract object, and no concretum can be\nidentical with an abstractum on pain of violating the separateness of\nthe concrete and abstract realms. There are, however, plenty of\nreasons (Vallicella 2002, Ch. 2) to reject the view that existence is\na first-level property and the ontological schemes that entail it. One\nintuition that many share is that existence is not one of an\nindividual’s properties, but that in virtue of which it has any\nproperties in the first place: it is more like the unity or cohesion\nof an individual’s properties (Vallicella 2002, Ch. 6). \nAnother route to the identity of God with his existence is via the\ndivine necessity. Although it is true to say that a contingent being is one that exists in some, but not all, metaphysically possible worlds, that is not what makes a contingent being contingent. What makes a contingent being contingent is the real distinction in it between essence and existence. What makes an absolutely necessary being necessary, then, is the lack of such a distinction. God, who has his necessity from himself\nand not from another, is therefore identical to his existence. One can say, if one likes, that God exists in all metaphysically possible worlds, but that is true only because in God essence and existence are the same.  The divine simplicity is the ground of the divine necessity. Given the way our minds work, we cannot think of God without distinguishing between essence and existence; but that is our affair and not God’s.\nIn reality, God is his existence.  \nThe foregoing may explain how it is conceivable without obvious\nincoherence that God and his nature and God and his existence be\nidentical, but how does it answer the second question? How does it\nexplain the conceivability without obvious incoherence of the identity\nof the divine attributes with each other? If each attribute is\nidentical to God, then each attribute is identical to each other by\nthe Transitivity of Identity. For example, if God = omniscience, and\nGod = omnipotence, then omniscience = omnipotence. But how could each\nattribute be identical to God? If we can understand how each attribute\ncan be identical to God, then we can understand how each can be\nidentical to every other one. \nWe have already seen how, if we embrace a constituent approach to\nontology, the divine nature can be coherently conceived as identical\nto God. Being immaterial, there is nothing in God to distinguish him\nfrom his nature. So he is identical to his nature. The divine nature\nis, or can be thought of as, a property. So there is at least one\nproperty that is self-instantiating: it has itself as its sole\ninstance, and indeed as its sole possible instance. If this is\ncoherently conceivable, then the same will be true of perfect\nknowledge, perfect power, and so on: if instantiated, these attributes\nare self-instantiated in every possible world and by the same thing in\nevery possible world (Vallicella 1992). Thus not only is the divine\nnature identical to an individual, each divine perfection is identical\nto an individual, namely God, whence it follows that each perfection\nis identical to every other one. \nA structurally similar approach is suggested by Christopher Hughes.\nThink of first-level properties as David Lewis (1986, 50 ff.) does: as\nsets of actual and possible individuals. Then the property of being\nred will be the set of all actual and possible red individuals and the\nproperty of being perfectly powerful will be the set consisting of all\nactual and possible perfectly powerful individuals. But there is only\none such individual, God. Only God is perfectly powerful and only God\ncan be perfectly powerful. So perfect power = {God}. As Hughes (1989,\n65) notes, Quine holds that a singleton and its member are identical.\nIf so, then perfect power = {God} = God. It should be added that if we\nhave already abandoned nonconstituent ontology with its rigid\nbifurcation of the concrete and the abstract according to which the\ntwo realms are disjoint, then we no longer have a reason to argue that\na concrete individual and its singleton must be distinct on the ground that the\nformer is concrete while the latter is abstract. Constituent ontology\nallows for a sort of ‘coalescence’ of the concrete and the\nabstract, the particular and the universal. Indeed, such a coalescence\nis what we find in the simple God who is in some sense both concrete\nand abstract in that he is a nature that is its own suppositum. \nThus there appears to be justification for the move from perfect power\n= {God} to perfect power = God. And similarly for perfect knowledge,\netc. In this way one can render coherent the notion that the\nperfections constitutive of the divine nature are identical with one\nanother. For if each is identical to God, then each is identical to\nevery other one. \nWilliam Mann cites a couple of difficulties that arise if the divine\nattributes are said to be identical to each other. The first is that\nif God = wisdom, and God = life, then wisdom = life. But wisdom and\nlife are not even extensionally equivalent, let alone identical. If\nTom is alive, it doesn’t follow that Tom is wise (Mann 2015,\n23). The second difficulty is that if God is wisdom, and Socrates is\nwise by participating in wisdom, then Socrates is wise by\nparticipating in God. But this smacks of heresy. No creature\nparticipates in God (Mann 2015, 23). The problem arises if the divine\nattributes are thought to be universals. \nEnter property instances. It is one thing to say that God is wisdom,\nquite another to say that God is God’s\nwisdom. God’s wisdom is an example of a property\ninstance. And similarly for the other divine attributes. God is not\nidentical to life; God is identical to\nhis life. Suppose we say that God = God’s wisdom, and God =\nGod’s life. It would then follow that God’s wisdom = God’s life, but\nnot that God = wisdom or that wisdom = life. So if we construe\nidentity with properties as identity with property instances, then we\ncan evade both of the above difficulties. Mann’s idea, then, is that\nthe identity claims made within DDS should be taken as Deity-instance\nidentities (e.g., God is his omniscience) and as instance-instance\nidentities (e.g., God’s omniscience is God’s omnipotence), but not as\nDeity-property identities (e.g., God is omniscience) or as\nproperty-property identities (e.g., omniscience is omnipotence).\nSupport for Mann’s approach is readily available in the texts of the\ndoctor angelicus (Mann 2015, 24). Aquinas says things like,\nDeus est sua bonitas, “God is his goodness.” \nBut what exactly is a property instance? If the concrete individual\nSocrates instantiates the abstract universal property wisdom, then two\nfurther putative items come into consideration. One is the\n(Chisholmian-Plantingian as opposed to Bergmannian-Armstrongian) state\nof affairs, Socrates’ being wise. Such items are abstract, i.e., not\nin space or time. The other is the property instance, the wisdom of\nSocrates. Mann rightly holds that they are distinct. All abstract\nstates of affairs exist, but only some of them obtain or are actual.\nBy contrast, all property instances are actual: they cannot exist\nwithout being actual. The wisdom of Socrates is a particular, an\nunrepeatable item, just as Socrates is, and the wisdom of Socrates is\nconcrete (in space and/or time) just as Socrates is. If we admit\nproperty instances into our ontology, then the above two difficulties\ncan be circumvented. Or so Mann maintains. \nBut then other problems loom. One is this. If the F-ness of God = God,\nif, for example, the wisdom of God = God, then God is a property\ninstance. But God is a person. How could a person be a property\ninstance? From the frying pan into the fire? How could the stupendous\nand super-eminent reality of God be reduced to something as\nontologically flimsy as a property instance? The problem displayed as\nan inconsistent triad: (a) God is a property instance; (b) God is a\nperson; (c) No person is a property instance. \nMann solves the triad by denying (c) (2015, 37). Some persons are\nproperty instances. Indeed, Mann argues that every person is a\nproperty instance because everything is a property instance. (2015,\n38) God is a person and therefore a property instance. If you object\nthat persons are concrete while property instances are abstract,\nMann’s response is that both are concrete (2015, 37). To be\nconcrete is to be in space and/or time (2015, 37). Socrates is\nconcrete in this sense, but so is his being sunburned. \nIf you object that persons are substances and thus independent items\nwhile property instances are not substances but dependent on\nsubstances, Mann’s response will be that the point holds for\naccidental property instances but not for essential property\ninstances. Socrates may lose his wisdom but he cannot lose his\nhumanity. Now all of God’s properties are essential: God is\nessentially omniscient, omnipotent, etc. So it seems to Mann that “the\nomniscience of God is not any more dependent on God than God is on the\nomniscience of God: should either cease to be, the other would also.”\n(2015, 37) This is scarcely compelling: x can depend on y even if both\nare necessary beings. Both the set whose sole member is the number 7\nand the number 7 itself are necessary beings, but the set depends on\nits member both for its existence and its necessity, and not vice\nversa. Closer to home, Aquinas held that some necessary beings have\ntheir necessity from another while one has its necessity in itself. I\nshould think that the omniscience of God is dependent on God, and not\nvice versa. Mann’s view, however, is not unreasonable. Intuitions\nvary. \nMann’s argument for the thesis that everything is a property\ninstance involves the notion of a rich property. The rich property of\nan individual x is a conjunctive property the conjuncts of\nwhich are all and only the essential and accidental properties, some\nof them temporally indexed, instantiated by x\nthroughout x’s career (2015, 38). Mann tells us that for\nanything whatsoever there is a corresponding rich property. From this\nhe concludes that “everything is a property instance of some\nrich property or other” (38). It follows that every person is a\nproperty instance. The argument seems to be this: (a) For every\nconcrete individual x, there is a corresponding rich property\nR. Therefore, (b) for every concrete\nindividual x, x is a property instance of some rich\nproperty or other.  Therefore, (c) For every concrete\nindividual x, if\nx is a person, then x is a property instance. \nVallicella (2016, 379) argues that the move from (a) to (b) smacks of\na non sequitur absent some auxiliary premise. Let it be granted\narguendo that for each concrete individual x there is\na corresponding rich property R. And let it be granted that\nthere are property instances. So, in addition to Socrates and wisdom,\nthere is the wisdom of Socrates. Recall that this property instance is\nnot to be confused with the abstract state of affairs, Socrates’\nbeing wise.  From what has been granted it follows that for each x\nthere is the rich property instance, the R-ness\nof x. But how is it supposed to follow that everything is a\nproperty instance? Everything instantiates properties, and in this\nsense everything is an instance of properties; but this is not to say\nthat everything is a property instance.  Socrates instantiates a rich\nproperty, and so is an instance of a property, but it doesn’t\nfollow that Socrates is a property instance.  Something seems to be\nmissing in Mann’s argument.  \nThere is of course no chance that Professor Mann is confusing being an\ninstance of a property with being a property instance. If a\ninstantiates F-ness, then a is an instance of the property\nF-ness; but a is not a property instance as\nphilosophers use this phrase: the F-ness of a is a\nproperty instance. So what do we have to add to Mann’s argument\nfor it to generate the conclusion that every concrete individual is a\nproperty instance? How do we validate the inferential move from (a) to\n(b)? Let ‘Rs’ stand for Socrates’ rich\nproperty. We have to add the claim that there is nothing one could\npoint to that could distinguish Socrates from the property instance\ngenerated when Socrates instantiates Rs. Rich property\ninstances are a special case of property instances. Socrates cannot be\nidentical to his wisdom because he can exist even if his wisdom does\nnot exist. And he cannot be identical to his humanity because there is\nmore to Socrates that his humanity, even though he cannot exist\nwithout it. But since Socrates’ rich property instance includes\nall his property instances, why can’t Socrates be identical to\nthis rich property instance? And so Mann’s thought seems to be\nthat there is nothing that could distinguish Socrates from his rich\nproperty instance. So they are identical. And likewise for every other\nindividual. But it is arguable that it is a mistake to hold that every\nperson is a property instance. Here (Vallicella 2016 379–380) is one\nargument. \nRich Properties and Haecceity Properties. Socrates can exist\nwithout his rich property; ergo, he can exist without his rich\nproperty instance; ergo, Socrates cannot be a rich property instance\nor any property instance. The truth of the initial premise is fallout\nfrom the definition of ‘rich property.’ The R\nof x is a conjunctive property each conjunct of which is a\nproperty of x. Thus Socrates’ rich property includes (has\nas a conjunct) the property of being married to Xanthippe. But\nSocrates might not have had that property, whence it follows that he\nmight not have had R. (If R has C as a conjunct,\nthen necessarily R has C as a conjunct, which implies\nthat R cannot be what it is without having exactly the\nconjuncts it in fact has. An analog of mereological essentialism holds\nfor conjunctive properties.)  And because Socrates might not have had\nR, he might not have had the property instance of R. So\nSocrates cannot be identical to this property instance. What Mann\nneeds is not a rich property, but an haecceity property: one that\nindividuates Socrates across every possible world in which he\nexists. His rich property, by contrast, individuates him in only the\nactual world. In different worlds, Socrates has different rich\nproperties. And in different worlds, Socrates has different rich\nproperty instances. It follows that Socrates cannot be identical to,\nor even necessarily equivalent to, any rich property instance. An\nhaecceity property, however, is a property Socrates has in every world\nin which he exists, and which he alone has in every world in which he\nexists. Now if there are such haecceity properties as\nidentity-with-Socrates, then perhaps we can say that Socrates is\nidentical to a property instance, namely, the identity-with-Socrates\nof Socrates. Unfortunately, there are powerful arguments for rejecting\nhaecceity properties (Vallicella 2002, 99–104). So we ought to\nconclude that concrete individuals cannot be identified with property\ninstances, whence follows the perhaps obvious proposition that no\nperson is a property instance, not God, not me, not Socrates. \nTo conceptualize a simple God it seems we must assign him to some\nfamiliar category or other. But how is this possible if, as DDS\nimplies, God is utterly sui generis and unique in his very mode\nof uniqueness? It might not be possible at all, in which case silence\nmight be the most appropriate response. But let’s not give up just\nyet. Vallicella (1992) suggests that God is assimilable to a\nself-exemplifying property, a Platonic Form. Hughes goes nominalist\nwith his idea that God is something like a singleton set. Mann\nassimilates God to a property instance or trope. Hugh McCann,\nrejecting Mann’s view, proposes that we think of God as a concrete\nstate of affairs. Such are to be distinguished from abstract states of\naffairs. Contrast Booth’s assassinating Lincoln with\nBooth assassinating Lincoln. Both are states of affairs, but\nonly the former is concrete in the sense of causally active/passive.\nWhereas the former is an act (act-token), the latter is an act-type.\nThe former was causally efficacious; the latter is disbarred from\ncausal efficacy by its ontological category. McCann’s proposal,\nthen, is that God be thought of as a concrete state of affairs along\nthe lines of Michaelangelo’s creating of the Sistine\nChapel’s ceiling. \nThus is concretion secured, but whither simplicity? A concrete state\nof affairs such as Socrates’ being pale is a complex both the\nsubject and the property constituent of which are necessary for its\nidentity.  Property instance or tropes, by contrast, are simples: the\npaleness trope in Socrates, though it cannot ‘migrate’ to\nPlato, does not have Socrates as a constituent and so is not tied to\nthe philosopher for its identity. Now McCann is well aware that the\nontological complexity of concrete states of affairs does not comport\nwell with divine simplicity. But he thinks it is the best we can\ndo. \nAlthough McCann doesn’t say it, it seems to follow from his\nwhole approach that God cannot be a member of any extant ontological\ncategory: he cannot be a universal or a set or a trope … or a\nconcrete state of affairs. Indeed, if he is absolutely sovereign, then\nGod must somehow be the creative source of the ontological categories\nthemselves, how many they are and what they are, and not merely the\nsource of the natures (essences) of the members of categories. God\nmust transcend all categories. Taken to the limit, absolute\nsovereignty would seem to imply absolute transcendence— and\nabsolute ineffability. Clearly, this is what the simplicity doctrine\nculminates in and is meant to preserve. So there is a tension here if\nnot a contradiction: it cannot be true both that God is beyond all\nontological categories and is a member of the category of concrete\nstates of affairs. But if we are to have any conception of God at all,\nwe must force him into some extant category or other, and for McCann\nthe category of concrete state of affairs is the best we can do. One\nwalks a tightrope when one attempts to avoid negative theology with\nits “nothing can be said positively about God.” Citing\nvarious texts of Aquinas, Eleonore Stump (2016, 195–198) shows that\nradical agnosticism about the divine nature is unwarranted. To know\nwhat God is not, one must have some knowledge of what God is. The\nclaim that God is not a body, for example, rests on such affirmations\nas that God is the prime mover and is purely actual. \nSo far we have explored how God can be (i) identical to his nature,\n(ii) identical to his existence, and (iii) such that his\nomni-attributes are identical to one another. But a very serious\nproblem remains, a problem that arises when we consider properties\nshared by God and creatures. It is obvious that the divine perfections\ncannot be shared with creatures: only God is perfectly powerful, wise,\ngood, and so on. But there must be some properties that God and\ncreatures share if God is not to be a wholly other than creatures and\nout of all relation to them. These shared properties, however, pose a\nthreat to DDS. The problem in a nutshell is to reconcile the divine\ntranscendence, of which DDS is an expression, with the need for some\ncommensurability between God and creatures. The problem, in other\nwords, is to find a way of preserving transcendence while avoiding a\nself-vitiating negative theology according to which nothing can be\npositively affirmed of God, not even that he exists. \nGod is powerful, but so is Socrates. The use of ‘powerful’\nin ‘God is powerful’ and ‘Socrates is\npowerful’ is not equivocal. That God is perfectly powerful while\nSocrates is imperfectly powerful does not alter the fact that both are\npowerful. Whether a thing is perfectly powerful or imperfectly\npowerful, it is powerful. There is a difference in degree of power,\nbut the difference in degree seems to presuppose (and thus entail) a\nsameness in respect of being powerful. Now if God and Socrates are\nboth powerful, then God has a property with which he is not identical,\nnamely, the property of being powerful, and this contradicts DDS. For\nif God is identical with the property of being powerful, then he\ncannot share this property with Socrates. The argument, then, is\nthis: \nFrom (1) together with the premise that God is perfectly powerful, it\nfollows that \nBut among creatures we also find agents of varying degrees of power,\nso it is also true that \nIt follows from (2) and (3) that \nIf x and y share a property P, then\nP is distinct from both x and y.\nTherefore, \nGraham Oppy (2003) suggests a way to defeat the foregoing argument.\nOppy (in effect) rejects the inference from (2) and (3) to (4). Given\nthe truth of ‘God is powerful’ and ‘Socrates is\npowerful,’ it does not follow that there is a property expressed\nby the predicate ‘powerful’ that is shared by God and\nSocrates. On Oppy’s approach, both sentences are true, and the\npredicate ‘powerful’ has the same sense in both sentences.\nThere is no equivocation and no analogy either. It is just that there\nis no one property that is expressed by the predicate in its two\noccurrences. If this right, then there is no warrant for (4) and the\nabove argument against DDS collapses. \nOppy is not denying that many predicates express properties; he is\ndenying that all do. Taking a page from David Armstrong (1978), he is\nsaying that predicates and their senses provide no sure guidance as to\nwhat properties (Armstrongian immanent universals) the world contains.\nIt follows that the ontological structure of the truth-maker of a true\nsentence cannot be read off from the syntactic structure of the\nsentence of which it is the truth-maker. Therefore, the fact that our\ntwo sentences (3) and (4) have the form a is F does not\nwarrant the conclusion that the respective truth-makers have the\nstructure: particular-exemplifying-same universal. Oppy writes: \nThe idea is essentially this. Suppose that something is an H\nif and only if it is either an F or a G. One can\neasily see that if a is H and b is\nH, it does not follow that there is some one property that\nthey share. For it might be that a is H in virtue of\na’s exemplifying F-ness and b is H\nin virtue of b’s exemplifying G-ness. Applied to\nSocrates and the simple God: Socrates is powerful in virtue of\nexemplifying P1 while God is powerful in virtue of\nexemplifying P2. Thus there is no one property,\nthe property of being powerful, that both exemplify. So (4) above is\nfalse, and the argument against DDS collapses. Since a full defense of\nOppy’s defense of DDS is beyond the scope of the present entry, we\nshall focus on a second way of defusing the objection.  \nThe above argument against DDS requires the assumption that if\nx is perfectly F, then x is F.\nThis is highly plausible but not quite obvious, since as Barry Miller\n(1996, Ch. 5) argues, ‘perfect’ might be an\nalienans adjective. An alienans adjective is one\nthat shifts, alters, alienates, the sense of the noun that it\nmodifies. Thus ‘decoy’ in ‘decoy duck’ is an\nalienans adjective: from the fact that a thing is a decoy\nduck one cannot infer that it is a duck in the way in which one can\ninfer from the fact that a thing is a male duck that it is a duck. So\nif ‘perfectly’ in ‘perfectly powerful’ is an\nalienans adjective, then God can be perfectly powerful\nwithout being powerful, and the above objection to DDS collapses. \nAt first glance, this may appear to be a senseless suggestion. Power\nis an attribute that admits of degrees. Perfect power is therefore\nquite naturally viewed as the maximal degree of power. So viewed,\nperfect power is generically identical with any submaximal degree of\npower. According to Miller, however, there is an important distinction\nbetween a limit simpliciter and a limit case. A limit simpliciter\ndiffers merely in degree from that of which it is the limit\nsimpliciter, whereas a limit case differs absolutely from that of\nwhich it is the limit case. Thus the limit simpliciter of an\nF is an F, while the limit case of an F is\nnot an F. What Miller argues is that the divine perfections\nare limit cases, not limits simpliciter, of such properties as power\nand knowledge. As such, they have nothing generically in common with\nthe corresponding attributes in creatures. \nTo appreciate the limit simpliciter/limit case distinction, consider\nthe speed of moving bodies. It has an upper limit, the speed of light.\nThis is a limit simpliciter. But the lower limit, namely the speed 0\nkm/sec, is a limit case and not a limit simpliciter. Whereas the upper\nlimit simpliciter is a speed, the lower limit case is not a speed. A\nparticle moving at 0 km/sec is not moving. For a second example,\nconsider the series: 3-place predicable, 2-place predicable, 1-place\npredicable. Since a predicable (e.g., “___ is wise”) must\nhave at least one place to be a predicable, a 1-place predicable is a\nlimit simpliciter of the ordered series of predicables.\nAlthough talk of zero-place predicables comes naturally, as when we\nspeak of a proposition as a zero-place predicable, a zero-place\npredicable is no more a predicable than negative growth is growth.\n“Zero-place” is an alienans adjective like\n“negative” in “negative growth.” So a\nzero-place predicable is not a limit simpliciter of the series in\nquestion, but a limit case of this series: it is not a member\nof the series of which it is the limit case. It nevertheless stands in\nsome relation to the members of the series inasmuch as they and the\nway they are ordered point to the limit case (Miller 1996, p.\n8). \nThe idea, then, is that God’s power is not the maximum, or limit\nsimpliciter, of an ordered series of instances of power, but the limit\ncase of power. This implies that God’s power is not an\ninstance of power any more than a zero-place predicable is a\npredicable. No doubt this will surprise the perfect-being theologians,\nbut, in mitigation, it can be said that God’s power, though not an\ninstance of power, is that to which the ordered series of\npower-instances points, and is therefore something to which\nthe members of that series stand in a definite relation. \nMiller’s approach allows us to reject the premise of the above\nargument. The premise stated in effect that anything that is perfectly\npowerful is powerful. But if Miller is right, and God’s power is not\nthe limit simpliciter of an ordered series of instances of power, and\nthus itself an instance of power, but is instead a limit case\nof power, then what is perfectly powerful need not be an instance of\npower. \nGod is the absolute. An absolute cannot lack anything nor does it have\nany need to develop itself: it is, eternally, all that it can be. This\nimplies that there is no act-potency distinction in God, no unrealized\npowers or potentialities. In the classical phrase, God is actus\npurus, pure act, wholly actual. James Dolezal puts it very well\nwhen he writes, “The consideration of God as ipsum esse\nsubsistens and actus purus is crucial for any confession\nof God’s absolute existence” (Dolezal, 214).  \nBut to uphold the divine absoluteness, it is also necessary that God\nbe libertarianly free in his production of creatures. He must be free\neither to create or not to create. For suppose that the divine nature\nis such that God must create.  Then God would depend on the created\nworld to be himself and to be fully actual. He would need what is\nother than himself to be himself. This entanglement with the relative\nwould compromise the divine absoluteness. God would need the world as\nmuch as the world needs God. Each would require the other to be what\nit is. But then God would not be absolute (Dolezal, 210) Therefore, God\nmust be free to either create or not create \nSo God must be both simple and free to be absolute. But it is very\ndifficult to understand how a simple being could be free in the\nunconditional ‘could have done otherwise’ sense. If God is\nsimple, then he is pure act, as was explained at the beginning of this\nentry. It follows that God is devoid of unrealized powers,\npotentialities, or possibilities. To act freely, however is to act in\nsuch a way that one (unconditionally) could have done otherwise, which\nimplies unrealized possibilities of divine action. Now Dolezal’s\nview is that it is not only difficult to reconcile simplicity and\n(libertarian) freedom, but impossible for us, at least in our present\nstate. “Though we discover strong reasons for confessing both\nsimplicity and freedom in God, we cannot form an isomorphically\nadequate notion of how this is the case” (210). In footnote 55\non the same page, Dolezal brings up wave-particle duality: light\nbehaves both like a particle and like a wave. We have good reason to\nbelieve that it is both despite the difficulty or impossibility of\nunderstanding how it could be both. On the basis of the quotation and\nthe footnote it seems fair to Dolezal to pin the label\n‘mysterian’ on him, at least with respect to the\nsimplicity-freedom problem which is only one sub-problem within the\ndivine simplicity constellation of problems.  God is both simple and\nfree, and he must be both to be God; it is a mystery, however, how he\ncould be both. \nIf we have good reason to believe that p is true, and good\nreason to believe that q is true, then we have good reason to\nbelieve that p and q are logically consistent (with\neach other) despite an absence of understanding as to how\nthey could be mutually consistent. What is actual is possible whether\nor not one can render intelligible how it is possible. For example,\nmotion is actual, hence possible, despite one’s inability in the teeth\nof Zenonian considerations to understand how it is possible. Many\nsimilar examples could be given. \nAnd so a mysterian move suggests itself: We are justified in\nmaintaining both that God is simple and that God is free despite the\nfact that after protracted effort we cannot make logical sense of this\nconjunction. If we have good arguments for both limbs of what appears\nto be a logically contradictory dyad, it could be that the\ncontradiction is merely apparent. The fact that the conjunction\n— God is simple and God is free — appears to us, and\nperhaps even necessarily appears to us, to be or rather entail an\nexplicit logical contradiction is not a compelling reason to reject\nthe conjunction. It is a reason, perhaps even a good reason, but not a\nrationally compelling one. For it may be that our cognitive\narchitecture saddles us with irremediable cognitive limitations that\nmake it impossible for us to understand how God could be both simple\nand libertarianly free. The mysterian is not a dialetheist: the\nmysterian does not claim that there are true contradictions. Like the\nrest of us, the mysterian eschews them like the plague. The mysterian\npoint is rather that a proposition’s non-episodic and chronic\nseeming to be a contradiction does not suffice for its rejection. For\nit may well be that certain truths are inaccessible to us due to our\nmental limitations and defects, and that among these truths are some\nthat appear to us only in the guise of contradictions, and must so\nappear in this life. The religious mysterian can bolster the point by\nreferencing the Fall.  Sin, after all, may be expected to have noetic\nconsequences. Of course, Dolezal’s mysterian move cannot be\nreasonably made unless the extant attempts to reconcile simplicity and\nfreedom are failures. That they are failures is not difficult to\nbelieve. So mysterianism is up and running despite its own\nproblems. What might these be?  \nFirst, if a (conjunctive) proposition’s seeming, after careful and\nrepeated scrutiny, to be or entail an explicit logical contradiction\nis not sufficient, or at least good enough, evidence of its being a\ncontradiction, what would be? To put it another way, one’s inability to\nexplain how it could be true both that p and that q\ndoes seem to be pretty good (non-demonstrative) evidence that\np and q are not both true. Now it was noted above\nthat the actual is possible whether or not one can explain how it is\npossible.  Granted, but if one cannot explain the ‘how,’\ndoubt is cast on the actuality. The tables can be turned. How\nadjudicate between these opposing lines of argument: A:\nBecause X is actual, X is possible, whether or not\nanyone can explain how it is possible! B: Because no one can explain\nhow it is possible, it is not possible, and therefore not actual! \nSecond, if all extant attempts to reconcile simplicity and freedom\nfail, it does not follow that there isn’t a solution right over the\nhorizon. How can a mysterian rule out the possibility of a future\nsolution? The mysterian seems committed to saying that it is\nimpossible (at least in this life) that there be a solution. How can\nhe be sure of this? \nThird, if a proposition appears under careful scrutiny to be or entail\na contradiction, then is there even a proposition before the mind? If\nyou require for x’s salvation that x believe that\nGod is one and God is three, what exactly are you demanding\nthat x believe? Before x can affirm a proposition as\ntrue x must understand it, but how can x affirm as true\na proposition that appears necessarily false? Such a\n‘proposition’ is arguably not a proposition at\nall. God is simple but free appears to be in like case. As a\nmatter of pure logic, there are of course necessarily false\npropositions: take the members of a contradictory pair of propositions\nand conjoin them, e.g.,\nsnow is white & snow is not white. This necessarily false\nproposition is arguably not a possible object of belief because of our\ncharitable tendency to re-interpret blatant contradictions in some\ninnocuous way. When our hermeneutical charity is thwarted, however, we\nsuspend belief, not in a proposition, but in a putative\nproposition’s being a proposition, or in a verbal\nformula’s expressing a proposition. \nLike Dolezal, Eleonore Stump thinks of God as self-subsistent Being\n(esse). If God is absolutely simple, and not just simple in\nthe uncontroversial sense of lacking material parts, then God must be\nself-subsistent Being. God is at once both Being and something that\nis. He has to be both. If he were Being (esse) but not a\nbeing (id quod est), he could not enter into causal\nrelations. He could not do anything such as create the world,\nintervene in its operations, or interact with human persons. Such a\nGod would be “religiously pernicious” (Stump 2016, 199).\nIndeed, if God were Being but not a being, then one could not sensibly\nmaintain that God exists. For if Being is other than every being, then\nBeing is not. (It is instructive to note that Martin Heidegger, the\nfamous critic of onto-theology, who holds to the “ontological\ndifference” of Being (Sein) from every being\n(Seiendes) ends up assimilating Being to Nothing\n(Nichts).) On the other hand, if God were a being among\nbeings who merely has Being but is not (identically) Being, then he\nwould not be absolutely transcendent, worthy of worship, or\nineffable. Such a God would be “comfortingly familiar” but\n“discomfitingly anthropomorphic” (Miller 1996, 3). It is\nnot clear that DDS is susceptible of a satisfactory articulation\nacceptable to most theists. There is no reason to be sanguine. But if\nsuch could be achieved then we would have a via media between\nthe Scylla of negative theology according to which nothing can be\ntruly said or known about God and the Charybdis of an anthropomorphic\ntheology according to which “… God’s properties are\nmerely human ones, albeit extended to the maximum degree\npossible” (Miller, 1996, 3). \nThe problem, of course, is to explain how God can be both\nBeing esseand something that is ens. This is\nunintelligible to the discursive intellect.  Either Being is other\nthan beings or it is not. If Being is other than beings, then Being\ncannot itself be. That would imply that God, who must be Being itself\nto be absolute, cannot be. If, on the other hand, Being just is beings\ntaken collectively, then God could only be a being among beings and\nnot the absolute reality. To the discursive intellect the notion of\nself-subsistent Being is contradictory. For the idea here is that\nBeing itself is a being, a very special being no doubt, but\nnonetheless a being, something that is. One response to the\ncontradiction is simply to deny divine simplicity. That is a\nreasonable response, no doubt. But might it not also be reasonable to\nadmit that there are things that human reason cannot understand, and\nthat one of these things is the divine nature? “Human reason can\nsee that human reason cannot comprehend the quid est of\nGod.” (Stump 2016, 205) \nOn one reading of Stump, she, like Dolezal, makes a mysterian move, and she,\nlike Dolezal (2011, 210, fn 55), invokes wave-particle duality. We\ncannot understand how light can be both a wave phenomenon and also\nparticulate in nature, and yet it is both:  \nIf the defender of DDS is driven to mysterianism, many will consider\nthis a desperate jump from the frying pan into the fire. Dolezal, for\nexample, holds that God must be both simple and libertarianly free to\nbe absolute despite the apparent contradiction. How God can be both\nsimple and free must remain a mystery. William Hasker balks:\n“This won’t do, of course” (2016, 19). His “of\ncourse” is of course a bit of bluster, but one feels his\npain. “The argument Dolezal has given quite straightforwardly\nentails that the doctrine of divine simplicity is false\n…” (2016, 19). This is not an unreasonable thing to say,\nbut is it compelling? Does it force a rational person to abandon DDS?\nIs it so compelling that DDS can be dismissed as a mistake, a\ncorrectable error in reasoning that one falls into due, perhaps, to\ninattention to certain obvious truths? Not quite. \nHasker takes the apparent contradiction to be real. But can he exclude\nthe possibility that the contradiction is merely apparent? His view\ncomports well with the notion that God is a being among beings. But\nfor those who hold that the divine transcendence requires that God\ntranscend beings in his mode of existence, his mode of\nproperty-possession, his mode of necessity, and his mode of\nuniqueness, it may seem more likely that the apparent contradictions\nthat arise when we think about God reflect our structural inability to\nthink of him as anything other than a very special being among\nbeings. \nFor Stump, God is esse and God is also id quod est.\nThese claims, though apparently contradictory, must both be affirmed.\nThe apparent contradiction arises because of a “deficiency in\nour mode of speaking” (Stump 2016, 207). She presumably means\nthat this deficiency is in this life irremediable and ineluctable. In\nreality, however, there is no contradiction; the laws of logic apply\nto God, “and not just anything can be correctly affirmed of\nGod” (2016, 207).\n \nHasker is unimpressed: \nStump could agree with Hasker that she does not present us with\n“a coherent view of God’s nature,” but then that is\nprecisely what her position implies cannot be had. Our mode of\nspeaking about God is necessarily defective and inaccurate. If we\ncould speak accurately, then … \nThe issue that divides Hasker and Stump and the parties they represent\nis perhaps impossible to resolve. Hasker demands a “coherent\nview of God’s nature,” one that satisfies and can be\nseen to satisfy the exigencies of the discursive\nintellect. Hasker demands that God fit within the discursive\nframework, which implies that he have properties the way creatures do,\nexist the way creatures do, and so on. Stump could reasonably claim\nthat Hasker is making an inappropriate demand, one that does not\nrespect the divine transcendence. \nProponents of DDS affirm such sentences as ‘God is his\nomniscience’ and‘God is his omnipotence.’ If the\nsingular terms ‘his omniscience’ and ‘his\nomnipotence’ in such sentences are taken to refer to properties,\nthen such sentences assert the identity of God and a property, an\nexemplifiable entity. This is unacceptable for the reasons rehearsed\nin section 2 above. Briefly, God is an individual and not a property.\nIf, however, the singular terms in question could be taken to refer to\nindividuals, then this particular objection to the coherence of DDS\nwould collapse. Clearly, if ‘God’ and ‘his\nomniscience’ both refer to an individual, God, then the\ncoherence of ‘God is his omniscience’ will be beyond\nquestion. \nEnter the truthmaker defense. The truthmaker defense hinges on a\ntheory of predication that Bergmann and Brower (2006) put as\nfollows: \nP* is to be understood by contrast to a theory of predication\naccording to which every true predication of the form\n‘a is F’ is to be explained in terms of\nan individual’s exemplifying of a property. Now consider the essential\npredication, ‘God is omniscient.’ Given that a truthmaker\nof a truth t is an entity whose existence broadly logically\nnecessitates the truth of t, God himself is plausibly viewed as\nthe truthmaker of ‘God is omniscient’ and like essential\npredications. For in every possible world in which God exists, these\nessential predications (or the propositions they express) are true. In\nthe case of essential as opposed to accidental predications,\ntruthmakers need not be taken to be concrete states of affairs, and so\nneed not be taken as involving exemplifiable entities. Socrates\nhimself is not plausibly taken to be the truthmaker of the accidental\n‘Socrates is wise’ (or the proposition it expresses)\nbecause there are possible worlds in which Socrates exists but the\npredication is not true; Socrates is, however, plausibly taken to be\nthe truthmaker of the essential ‘Socrates is human.’ \nNow ‘God’s omniscience’ and ‘Socrates’\nhumanity’ are abstract nominalizations of ‘God is\nomniscient’ and ‘Socrates is human,’ respectively.\nSo given that God and Socrates are the truthmakers of the respective\nessential predications, the nominalizations can be taken to refer, not\nto properties, but to these very same truthmakers. Accordingly, to say\nthat God is identical to his omniscience is just to say that God is\nidentical to the truthmaker of ‘God is omniscient.’ And\nthat amounts to saying that God is identical to God. In this way one\navoids the absurdity of saying that God is identical to a property.\nWhat God is identical to is not the property of omniscience but the\nreferent of ‘God’s omniscience,’ which turns out to be God\nhimself. And similarly for the rest of God’s intrinsic and essential\nattributes. \nSuppose a creaturely agent freely performs an action A. He\nfiles his tax return, say, by the April 15th deadline. Suppose that\nthe freedom involved is not the compatibilist “freedom of the\nturnspit” (to borrow Kant’s phrase) but the robust\nfreedom that implies both that the agent is the unsourced source of\nthe action and that the agent could have done otherwise. The\nperformance of A makes true a number of contingent\npropositions, all of them known by God in his omniscience. Now if\nsubject S knows that proposition p, and p is\ncontingent, then it would seem that S’s knowing that p\nis or involves an accidental (as opposed to essential)\nintrinsic state of S. If God is omniscient, then he\nknows every (non-indexical) truth, including every contingent truth.\nIt seems to follow that God has at least as many accidental intrinsic\nstates as there are contingent truths. But this contradicts DDS\naccording to which there is nothing intrinsic to God that is distinct\nfrom God.  \nConsider the mental state God is in when he knows that Tom freely\nfiles his tax return on April 14th, 2014. This divine mental state is\nan intrinsic state God is in contingently. If God were identical to\nthis state, then he could not be a se. For if God were\nidentical to the state, then God would be dependent on something\n– Tom’s libertarianly free action – that is external to\nGod and beyond his control. Now anything that compromises the divine\naseity will compromise the divine simplicity, the latter being an\nentailment of the former. So it seems that an omniscient God cannot be\nsimple if there are free creaturely agents and God knows what they do\nand leave undone. There is also the problem that if the divine mental\nstate in question were identical to God, then the truth God knows when\nhe knows that Tom files on April 14th would be necessarily\ntrue. \nThe problem is expressible as an aporetic pentad: \nEach limb of the above pentad has a strong, though not irresistible,\nclaim on a classical theist’s acceptance. As for (1), if God is\nL-free, as he must be on classical theism, then it is\nreasonable to maintain that every free agent is L-free. For if\n‘could have done otherwise’ is an essential ingredient in\nthe analysis of ‘Agent A freely performs action X,’\nthen it is highly plausible to maintain that this is so whether the\nagent is God or Socrates. Otherwise, ‘free’ will means\nsomething different in the two cases. Furthermore, if man is made in\nthe image and likeness of God, then it is surely arguable if not\nobvious that part of what this means is that man is a spiritual being\nwho is libertarianly free just as God is. If a man is a deterministic\nsystem, then one wonders in what sense man is in the image of God. \nAs for (2), some reasons were given earlier for thinking that a theism\nthat understands itself must uphold God’s ontological simplicity\ninasmuch as it is implied by the divine aseity. An example of (3) is\nOswald’s shooting of Kennedy. The act was freely performed by Oswald,\nand the proposition that records it is a contingent truth known by God\nin his omniscience. \nThe plausibility of (4) may be appreciated as follows. Whatever else\nknowledge is, it is plausibly regarded as a species of true belief. A\nbelief is an intrinsic state of a subject. Moreover, to unpack the\nsecond clause of (3), beliefs are individuated by their contents:\nbeliefs or believings with different contents are different beliefs.\nIt cannot be that one and the same act of believing has different\ncontents at different times or in different possible worlds. \n(5), if not obvious on its own, could be taken as an entailment of\n(2). If in God essence and existence are one, then God cannot not\nexist. \nBut although each limb of the pentad is plausibly maintained and is\ntypically maintained by theists who uphold DDS, they cannot all be\ntrue. Any four limbs, taken together, entail the negation of the\nremaining one. \nTo illustrate, let us consider how the limbs of the pentad, excepting\n(2), entail the negation of (2). Being omniscient, God knows that\nOswald freely chose to kill Kennedy. But Oswald’s L-freedom\nprecludes us from saying that God’s knowledge of this contingent fact\ndepends solely on the divine will. For it also depends on Oswald’s\nL-free authorship of his evil deed, an authorship that God\ncannot prevent or override once he has created L-free agents. But this\nis inconsistent with the divine aseity. For to say that God is a\nse is to say that God is not dependent on anything distinct from\nhimself for his existence or intrinsic properties or states. But, by\n(4), God is in the state of knowing that Oswald freely chose to kill\nKennedy, and his being in this state depends on something outside of\nGod’s control, namely, Oswald’s L-free choice. In this way the\ndivine aseity is compromised, and with it the divine simplicity. \nIt seems, then, that our aporetic pentad is an inconsistent pentad.\nThe defender of DDS cannot deny either the divine simplicity or the\ndivine necessity, which is an entailment of simplicity. But an\nupholder of the divine simplicity has the option of denying (1) and\nmaintaining that, while God is L-free, creaturely agents are\nfree only in a compatibilist sense (‘C-free’). If\ncreaturely agents are C-free, but not L-free, then\nOswald could not have done otherwise, and it is possible for the\nupholder of divine simplicity to say that that Oswald’s C-free\nchoice is no more a threat to the divine aseity than the fact that God\nknows the contingent truth that creaturely agents exist. The latter is\nnot a threat to the divine aseity because the existence of creaturely\nagents derives from God in a way that Oswald’s L-free choice\ndoes not derive from God. \nA second and perhaps better response would be to reject (4) in one of\nthe ways canvassed by W. M. Grant (2012). Here are two ways that\nappear promising. On what Grant calls the Belief Model, God’s\nknowledge is a species of true belief, but God’s beliefs are not\nintrinsic states of God. They are not mental acts or episodes. Beliefs\nare relational. To have a belief is to be related to a proposition,\nwhere propositions are not contents of belief states, but abstract\nentities that exist independently of the subjects who believe them.\nFor God to believe that Oswald killed Kennedy is for God to stand in a\nrelation to a proposition without it being the case that there is\nanything intrinsic to God that grounds his standing in the belief\nrelation to the Oswald proposition as opposed to any other\nproposition. Believing, at least in the case of God, is an external\nrelation, not an internal relation grounded in an intrinsic feature of\nthe believer. Various objections can be brought against this Belief\nModel of divine cognition, but if they can be turned aside, then (4)\nfalls and the pentad is solved. \nA second way to reject (4) is by adopting what Grant calls an\nImmediate Cognition Model of divine knowing. Accordingly, God’s\nknowledge is not mediated by propositions or anything else, but is\ndirectly of contingent realities. God’s knowledge of Socrates has as\nan essential constituent Socrates himself, warts and all. On this\nexternalist model, as on the Belief Model, there nothing internal to\nGod and intrinsic to him in virtue of which he possesses contingent\nknowledge, and thus nothing contingent in him to compromise his\nsimplicity. \nOne ought to ask, however, whether either model preserves the divine\naseity which is a main motive for the divine simplicity (Brower 2009).\nIf the simple God’s knowing of Socrates includes the man himself in\nhis bodily reality, this would seem to make God dependent on something\nother than himself. Brower thinks the problem can be defused by\nobserving that God is the cause of the contingent entities on which\nhis contingent knowledge depends. Grant (2012, 267), however, thinks\nthat neither externalist model poses a problem for aseity whether or\nnot God causes the contingent objects he knows. If God exists from\nhimself, then he is a se. But the existence of a thing is\nintrinsic to it, not relational. So it suffices for the divine aseity\nthat God not depend on anything else for what he is intrinsically.\nThat God’s knowing of Socrates depends on Socrates is not to the\npoint: this knowing is purely relational and not intrinsic to God.","contact.mail":"billvallicella@cs.com","contact.domain":"cs.com"}]
