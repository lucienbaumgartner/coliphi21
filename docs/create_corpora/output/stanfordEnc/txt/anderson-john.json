In 1927 he was appointed to the Challis Chair\nof Philosophy at the University of Sydney and occupied this position\nuntil his retirement in 1958. In relative isolation he developed a\ndistinctive realist philosophy which was inspirational for generations\nof students at Sydney. While developing this position, he carried most\nof the teaching load in philosophy at the university, wrote the\narticles for which he is primarily known, and as contributor and\neditor kept the Australasian Journal of Psychology and\nPhilosophy going. Shortly after his arrival in Sydney he acted as\ntheoretical advisor to the Communist Party of Australia, but moved\naway from the party through the 1930s and finally adopted a strongly\nanti-communist stance. He remained active throughout his career,\nhowever, in a series of public controversies concerning censorship,\nuniversity reform, academic freedom and opposition to religious\ninstruction in education. Depending upon one’s perspective, these\nactivities diverted him from serious philosophical work or were the\nnatural expression of his philosophical outlook. On either view his\nintellectual impact at Sydney was overwhelming. Philosophers such as\nDavid Malet Armstrong, John Passmore, John Leslie Mackie, Eugene\nKamenka, Jim Baker and David Stove all acknowledged Anderson’s formative\ninfluence. From his early teaching at Edinburgh, Anderson influenced the social and political thought of Rush Rhees, and so also indirectly that of Alasdair Macintyre who came to recognise\nand value common themes in his own sociological and historical view of\nethics. Outside the academy, Anderson’s criticisms of conventional\nmorality and his account of positive ethical goods promoting a stance of\ncommitment, endeavour, risk and critical opposition to merely customary\nexpectations was a powerful tonic for a small but influential group of\nanti-careerist intellectuals, lawyers, journalists and artists\ncollectively known as the “Sydney Push”. \n\nJohn Anderson was born in 1893 in the weaving and coal-mining\nvillage of Stonehouse, Lanarkshire (about 20km from Glasgow). His\nfather was schoolmaster in the village and politically active in the\nIndependent Labour Party. In 1911 Anderson began his university studies at the University of Glasgow, enrolling in two successive honours degrees: mathematics/natural philosophy (including laboratory training) and logic/moral philosophy (including political\neconomy). His undergraduate studies extended throughout the years of\nthe World War, culminating in 1917 with his Masters thesis on the\nphilosophy of William James. Declared medically unfit for service, his\nexperience of the war was dominated by the Red Clydeside industrial\nand rental disputes, characterised by workers’ resistance to state and\nindustry attempts to re-organise work practices and personnel in the\ninterests of a supposed common national interest. The disputes\nultimately led to state suppression at the conclusion of the war when\nBritish troops and artillery were deployed to Glasgow. Anderson’s philosophical direction was powerfully influenced by the\nAustralian-born philosopher, Samuel Alexander, who delivered the\nGifford Lectures at Glasgow in 1918. In the previous year Anderson had\nbeen awarded for an essay supporting Henry Jones’ practical idealist\nview of the state as a moral agent. Following Alexander’s lectures\n(later published as Space, Time and Deity) Anderson accepted\nthe case for the complete rejection of this form of idealism in favour\nof a new and systematic realist programme. In 1919 Anderson married fellow philosophy student Jenny Baillie,\nwas appointed assistant lecturer at University College of South Wales\n(where he also provided Workers’ Education Classes) and was subsequently\nappointed assistant lecturer in logic at the University of Glasgow. In\n1920 he was appointed lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and so\nbecame the main exponent of realism in Norman Kemp Smith’s Department\nof Logic and Metaphysics. In the same year, his brother William\naccepted the Chair of Mental and Moral Philosophy at Auckland\nUniversity College, New Zealand. By 1926 Anderson had become dispirited by the rejection for\npublication of a textbook on logic that he had been working on since\n1922. He had also become politically isolated in the department\nbecause of his support for the General Strike in Britain. Such factors\nmay have moved him to accept the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Sydney, although as with his brother, the movement of\nScottish philosophers to Commonwealth universities was not unusual. In\n1927 he moved with Jennie and their young son Alexander (“Sandy”) to\nSydney. Anderson’s first serious professional engagement was in a critical\ndiscussion of F. C. S. Schiller’s logic, “Propositions and Judgments”\nand “The Truth of Propositions” (1926). The first outlines of a\ndistinctive realist position were made in “Empiricism” and “The Knower\nand the Known” (1927). After his arrival at Sydney, Anderson was\nintent upon developing this position and was dismissive of the\nfragmentary nature of most international philosophy in the wake of the\n“linguistic turn”. The important philosophical work in Anderson’s view was\nto establish and preserve a school of realist philosophy as the repository of a tradition of critical inquiry that would remain alert to the dangers of corrupting external\nforces and expectations.   Shortly after his arrival at Sydney, Anderson became a “theoretical\nadvisor” to the Australian Communist Party and so began a long history\nof antagonising conservative political and cultural representatives in\nthe city. He was repeatedly accused of disloyalty and communist\nsympathies by returned servicemen organisations, the churches and the\nconservative political parties. The University Senate ultimately\ndebated censure although a motion to declare him unfit to occupy the\nChair of Philosophy was defeated.  In 1930 James Joyce’s Ulysses was banned in Australia and\nthe Freethought Society was formed with Anderson as\nPresident. Anderson’s political influence at Sydney primarily took the form of a libertarian pluralism, particularly concerned with issues\nof state and religious censorship and interference in education. By\nthe 1940s and 1950s his political position was strongly\nanti-communist. Yet he remained unpopular with conservative\npoliticians and clerics and was criticised for “corrupting the\ncity’s youth” as late as 1961. In 1935 Anderson became the editor of The Australasian Journal\nof Psychology and Philosophy. He had previously contributed\nsignificantly to the journal with his articles “Determinism and\nEthics” (1928), “The Non-Existence of\nConsciousness”, “‘Universals’ and\nOccurrences” (1929), “The Place of Hegel in the History of\nPhilosophy”, “Utilitarianism” (1932), “Realism\nand Some of its Critics” (1933), and “Mind as\nFeeling” (1934). He retained editorial responsibility for the\njournal until 1947 when it passed to John Passmore with the new\nname The Australasian Journal of Philosophy. In 1958 Anderson retired and in 1962 died at his home in\nSydney’s northern suburbs. The Challis Chair of Philosophy was\noccupied for the next 30 years by Anderson’s students, J. L. Mackie\n(1959–1963) and D. M. Armstrong (1964–1991). Both philosophers were\ncritical of Anderson’s philosophy and were more engaged with\ncontemporary philosophical debates, but both also acknowledged\nAnderson’s formative influence on their work. In 1972 members of the Department of Philosophy at the University\nof Sydney were caught in a bitter dispute concerning subject matter,\neducational practices and the nature of philosophical study itself,\nand by the start of 1974 the department had split into two separate\nunits. D. M. Armstrong led the minority Department of Traditional and\nModern Philosophy away from what he perceived to be the politically\nradical but philosophically barren Department of General\nPhilosophy. Political disruptions throughout the academic world in the\nearly 1970s were not uncommon, but the particular intransigence and\nsecessionist tendencies which characterised both sides of the conflict\nat Sydney may well have been at least in part a legacy of Anderson’s teaching and\npractice. The department eventually reunited some thirty years\nlater. The emphasis of Anderson’s realism is upon independence,\ndirected particularly at the notion of constitutive relations (which\nhe takes to be the central error of idealism), but also employed in\nqualifying reductivist and instrumentalist forms of scientific\nexplanation. His position is that although whatever exists has\nrelations and is conditioned, it is nonetheless a specific existing\nthing with qualities of its own. It is the aim of\ncritical inquiry in any given field to identify relevant qualities and\ncharacteristics and to state the issue in the form of objective and\ncommunicable truth. Whatever our interests draw our attention to, the\ntruth of the matter is independent of our consideration. Whatever\ninnovative and imaginative uses we make of particular things, those\nuses are available to us because of existing properties in the things\nthemselves. For Anderson, two aspects of philosophical speculation\nhave been linked throughout the history of the subject, and his own\nthought can be considered as a single system with these complementary\naspects: the logical and the ethical. First, there is a single way of being, that of ordinary things\nbehaving in ordinary ways in space and time. All theories of higher\nand lower realities can only be stated in terms of the common reality\nwe all know and share. Anderson applied this thesis across the board:\nthere are not different kinds or degrees of truth, only something’s\nbeing the case or not; universals and values do not exist above the\nworld of space and time in a transcendent sphere of operation; powers\nare not entities distinct from the processes they explain; the mental\nrealm cannot be conceived as operating in a sphere separate from or\nother than space and time. There is no absolute or logical distinction\nbetween universals and particulars – universals exist within the\nordinary world, but never apart from the particulars they describe;\nthat is, there is no ontological level above or below that of the\nstate of affairs or the fact of a predicated subject. As the study of\nthe formal features of facts, logic provides an account of what is\nobjectively real: logic entails a general ontology. Second, Anderson emphasised both the objective and subjective\ndifficulties inherent in the endeavour to see things as they are, and\nthe necessary discipline acquired in ongoing traditions of critical\ninquiry. Confronting the reality of our existence entails recognising\nand not turning away from the ubiquity of conflict, tension and strife\nin all spheres. For Anderson ethical goods exist in the world in such\nactivities as intellectual inquiry, artistic production and scientific\ninvestigation. Ethical investigation is primarily concerned with\nidentifying those human activities which are driven by internal\nstandards of correctness and value and not by concern for external\nrewards or utilities. But these activities exist perilously in a world\nseriously inclined towards stasis and corruption. There is an almost\ntheological depth to Anderson’s pessimism in this regard.  Anderson’s views in normative philosophy are outlined in writings\nin ethical inquiry, narrowly construed, aesthetics, political thought\nand educational philosophy. Ethics is the study of the real\nqualities of human activities, not of what is right or obligatory,\nthese latter questions being relegated to the study of customary norms\nand expectations arising from particular practices and ways of\nlife. Similarly, aesthetics is the study of the qualities of\nbeautiful things, and is neither a study of feelings, expressions or\njudgments, nor a source of directives for artists. A work of art\nsucceeds to the extent that it objectively portrays its theme,\naccounts for what is the case (for example, anger considered\nas the “theme” of The Iliad). Literary criticism consists in\nassessing whether the artist has succeeded, objectively, in capturing\nor portraying the chosen theme. In his social and political\nthought, Anderson holds that society is a complex of competing\nand cooperating movements neither united by inclusive social purpose,\nnor reducible to its individual members. Underlying both logical and ethical aspects of Anderson’s thought\nis the identification of systematic confusions and errors in\nphilosophical thought. One persistent confusion is the\nmisidentification of relations as qualities. Most commonly, being in\nsome relation is thought to constitute the “nature” of some special\nstatus entity. But whereas a term together with a quality is a\ncomplete unit just as it stands, a term and a relation is simply\nincomplete without a second term. Anderson applied this thesis widely:\nthere are no such things whose nature it is to be known or perceived\n(“ideas”); there is no such thing whose nature it is to know\n(“consciousness”); there are no such things whose nature it is to be\npursued or whose nature it is to direct action (“values” conceived as\nstanding over and above the goods and values of this life). Relations\nare often more evident to us than the underlying qualities of the\nthings related and so relational explanations suggest themselves to us\nquite naturally. On the other hand, significant intellectual effort is\nrequired in any given field to understand the illusory nature of such\nexplanations and the manner in which they obstruct the identification\nand assertion of real issues. According to Anderson, one central confusion infecting modern\nphilosophy since Descartes has been its obsession with epistemological\nquestions, the attempt to provide unshakeable foundations for our\nknowledge of the external world. There is no gap between mind and\nworld that needs to be bridged because mentality belongs to the\nspatio-temporal world along with everything else. This is not to say\nthat misunderstanding is impossible, just that understanding is\npossible. It is possible to know various conditions and characters of\nthings in the first place only because things have these\ncharacters independently of our inquiries. And since as knowers we\noccupy the single world of space and time we come under the same\nconditions and so come into relations with those things that we are\ninvestigating. All knowledge depends upon empirical investigation and\nso is fallible: it is not built upon any more immediate or reliable\nentities such as sense data or self-evident ideas. Epistemological and\nontological bedrock is the complex situation of being there and so, a\nparticular’s being of a certain kind. Knowing minds are themselves\ncomplex spatio-temporal things, societies of emotions and feelings\nwithout a unifying consciousness to which these might belong nor some\nultimate self which could conceivably take a stand somehow outside and\nbeyond the world of space and time. Modern philosophy’s\nepistemological obsession can be regarded as an illogical attempt to\nlook behind the proposition, to gain a sideways view of how our\npropositions hook up to the real world. Gilbert Ryle listed Anderson among the “seniors” who\nhad preceded his own generation: philosophers such as Russell, Moore,\nWittgenstein, Bradley, Stout, McTaggert, Alexander, Laird, and Kemp\nSmith. For Ryle, Anderson’s generation represented “the old\ngang”, many the products of “those dominating Scots\nteachers” who had established philosophy as an academic\ndiscipline in English-speaking universities around the world. Anderson\nwas an exact contemporary of Wittgenstein and Heidegger, yet only\nseven years older than Ryle himself. But Ryle seems to have a point in\nsuggesting a generational gap that separated him from that earlier\ngeneration’s “pieties, lores, sagacities, equipments –\nyes, and fetishes too” (Ryle 1976: 383). Ryle was describing the\ngeneration of philosophers who were adult prior to or during the Great\nWar. He only became acquainted with Anderson in the 1950s and was\nstruck by the manner in which Anderson had continued a form of\nphilosophy into modern times that had given way elsewhere to\nphilosophies more concerned with linguistic usage. Despite this\nrecognition of interpretive challenges, for many of Anderson’s\nfollowers Ryle at that time radically misunderstood Anderson’s work\n(Ryle 1950), reading it from the perspective of the “linguistic\nturn”. For current readers there are indeed several obstacles to approaching\nAnderson’s work. His published works, primarily articles for\nthe Australasian Journal of Philosophy and Psychology and in \nlocal journals and newspapers, are difficult without the context of\nAnderson’s broader teaching. They are generally regarded as subsidiary\nto the lectures and syllabus of an Andersonian apprenticeship. It\nseems that they were written for the benefit of the students who\nalready had the value of his personal contact. Without this contact,\nwe must rely on the publication of several series of lecture\nnotes from Anderson’s papers by Sydney University Press (see\nBibliography). Anderson’s isolation from his intellectual peers and\nhis seeming reluctance to engage in international debate also deprives\ncontemporary students of the opportunity to locate his work within more\nfamiliar territory. One point of access to Anderson’s work for contemporary students,\nof course, lies in the work of his students such as D. M. Armstrong,\nJohn Passmore, and J. L. Mackie. But there is a danger even here that\ntheir specialisations may distort our view of Anderson’s work as a\nwhole. Anderson, as Passmore noted, was a generalist (Passmore,\nIntroduction to Anderson’s posthumous work, Studies in Empirical\nPhilosophy, hereafter EMP). Unlike the next\ngeneration, he expected all spheres of philosophical inquiry to open\nup to his investigation and his philosophy extended to all spheres:\nlogic, metaphysics, ethics, political thought, aesthetics,\neducation. Anderson describes his position variously as empiricist, realist,\nnaturalist, physicalist, positivist and pluralist, conceiving each of\nthese as different aspects of the one truly empirical philosophy. But\nhis use of these terms is problematic for the\nuninitiated. Anderson’s empiricism has no time for\nrepresentational views of truth, nor for the traditional empiricist\nentities of sense data or ideas. Empiricism for Anderson is an\nontological doctrine asserting a single way of being to which we as\ninvestigators belong. While undoubtedly committed to empirical\ninvestigation and the fallible nature of all propositional claims,\nAnderson’s empiricism is only secondarily an epistemological viewpoint\nrelating to how we come to know things within this spatio-temporal\nworld. Anderson’s realism rejects the traditional\nrealist-nominalist options concerning the existence of\nuniversals. Universals are brought down to (spatio-temporal) earth,\nbut there are no such things as pure universals nor pure particulars\noutside their roles within complex states of\naffairs. Mentality is a product of physico-chemical processes\nin the brain but this does not preclude our inquiry into the nature of\nmind as a field of conflicted tendencies, feelings and\nemotions. Whatever the special sciences tell us about their particular\nsubject matters, philosophy retains its authority in questions of\nlogic, that is to say, concerning the conditions of possibility of\ndiscourse. Indeed, modern science is badly infected by instrumentalist\nand technological views of its investigations and needs to become more\ntruly philosophical and critical, more concerned with establishing\nwhat is the case within specific fields, and less with being practical\nand useful in relation to perceived societal needs\n(EMP, 290). Positivism then is for Anderson\na commitment to what is objectively and positively the case, and not a\nprogram of instrumental or operational truth, nor a means of\ndistinguishing meaningful from meaningless utterances. Anderson’s call\nfor a “science of ethics” is not an assimilation of\nethical inquiry to the standards of the special sciences. It is a plea\nfor an objective investigation of the ethical, focussed on the\nexisting ethical qualities of human activities, rather than on the\npieties of traditional moral philosophy: the questions of right,\nobligation, duty and so forth.\n Ryle was only the first of many to be accused of misreading\nAnderson.  Criticisms of Anderson’s position from within mainstream\nEnglish-language philosophy have always seemed to his followers to\nmiss their mark. They have generally failed to recognise the\nontological, non-representational, non-semantic basis for his\nempiricism. Robert Brandom’s recent criticism and rejection of the\n“theoretical, explanatory and strategic commitments”\nmotivating Anglo-American philosophy in the 20th century lists these\nas: empiricism, naturalism, representationalism, semantic atomism,\nformalism about logic, instrumentalism about practical norms (Brandom\n2000). It is extraordinary that not one of these criticised features\nwould touch the philosophy of John Anderson as they stand (at least as\nBrandom outlines them). Brandom regards the notion of\n“facts” and “states of affairs” as emblematic\nof atomistic, representationalist thought. Anderson would have replied\nimperiously as he did to Gilbert Ryle’s\n“representationist” criticisms: “That is nothing to\nme”.  Many of the problems contemporary readers encounter in Anderson’s\nwork result from his relative international isolation. But for many of\nhis students it was precisely Anderson’s secessionist traditional\nstance that was the key to the great value of an Andersonian\neducation. He may have failed in his project, but he kept alive at\nSydney enduring values of traditional philosophical inquiry at a time\nwhen mainstream philosophy was either obsessed with linguistic usage\non the one hand or in deference to the natural sciences on the\nother. Many of Anderson’s students expected his philosophy to\nre-emerge stronger following the inevitable decline of linguistic\nphilosophy and the renewed interest in metaphysical questions which\nfollowed this decline. But if his work played any role in this renewal\nit was only indirectly through the work of his student\nD. M. Armstrong. Contemporary philosophers interested in metaphysical\nquestions do not refer to Anderson’s work and are frankly baffled by\nArmstrong’s enthusiasm for his teacher’s work. Anderson exists today\nalmost exclusively in the footnotes of his more engaged and\naccomplished students. In Anderson’s view the realist movement initiated by Russell and\nMoore had ended in failure because it had attempted to overcome\nHegelian philosophy by a return to pre-idealist certainties\n(EMP, 89). As a result, realism had been left\nwithout a school from which to challenge the newly emerging schools of\nidealism and pragmatism (STP, 161). Hegel’s\nall-encompassing system of thought was an example for a new and\nsystematic realism to emulate. In brief, Hegel’s attempt to formulate his sequence of outlooks\nrelies upon a realist view of the proposition which is incompatible\nwith his whole theory of outlooks or categories and their varying\nadequacy to reality as a whole. Hegel “unwittingly is proceeding in\nterms of the proposition” but is caught up with the illusory attempt\nto establish an overarching truth (“that whereby a true proposition\ncan be true”), instead of the task of establishing true\npropositions (JAA, Lectures on William James,\n1935). The same criticism of Hegel seems to be made by Brandom in the\nservice of his very different expressionist project (Brandom\n2000). But for Anderson, Hegel’s doctrine of outlooks “rests on an\ninability to grasp the independence of truths”\n(EMP, 81). On the other hand, we need only reject\nHegel’s doctrine of expressions to find that we are left with\nactual states of affairs rather than abstract being. Neither Cartesian rationalism nor English empiricism could replace\nHegel’s philosophy with any philosophical position of comparable\nrange. Hegel was right to emphasise system, but not as totality (a\npretended solution to real problems), but in the form of a single\nlogic. He was also right to see this logic as historical, but wrong to\nattempt to replace a “logic of things developing” with the\nnotion of a “developing logic” (EMP,\n80). Anderson summarises the position as follows. The only way to\nanswer Hegel would be to drop the modern fixation with epistemological\nquestions altogether and return to a Greek consideration of things. In\naddition to Greek directness, a true replacement for Hegelian idealism\nwould incorporate three major components: a positive theory of the\nmind as feeling and as non-unitary, as much a part of spatial and\ntemporal reality as any non-mental things and events; a true\nempiricism which recognised relations and generals as being as real\n(and as knowable) as the particulars related; and a conception of\nspace and time as conditions of existence rather than of human\nknowledge as in Kant’s transcendental idealism. Anderson proposed to\nreplace Hegel’s totality by developing a systematic realism which\nwould incorporate the work of John Burnet on Greek philosophy, of\nSigmund Freud on mind, of William James’ radical empiricism and of\nSamuel Alexander’s reworking of Kant’s transcendental aesthetic\n(EMP, 80). Anderson does not mention here another\npossible source for his direct realism, namely, Scottish common sense\nphilosophy, but he does consider this in his Lectures on Thomas Reid\nof 1935 (LMP). Richard Rorty has suggested that English language philosophy in the\nearly 20th century emerged from the dominance of Hegelian idealism by\ndeferring to the natural sciences, partly because the alternative\nassociation with modernist literature seemed to threaten “a kind\nof privatised aestheticism which contained disturbing strains of\nirrationalism” (Rorty 1985, p. 748). Superficially, Anderson’s\nwork suggests an attempt of some kind to assimilate philosophy to the\nsciences. But he was a true modernist in relation to literary culture:\nhis articles and addresses include critical works on such figures as,\nin particular, James Joyce, but also Lawrence, Shaw, Wells, Grahame,\nBelloc, Wilde, Hardy, Ibsen, Meredith, Dostoevsky and Melville, as\nwell as on the genre of detective fiction. Literature for Anderson had\na special character as the embodiment or repository of culture\n(JAA, Lectures on the Educational Theories of Spencer\nand Dewey, 1949). At Sydney in the 1930s he championed both the works\nof James Joyce (recently banned) and the importance of Freudian\npsychoanalysis to our understanding of mentality as conflicted and\npassionate, and to cultural inquiry more generally (cf., Damousi\n2005). He thought the pre-modernist “literary\nphilosophers” of romanticism and idealism had shown\n“greater tenacity” than those philosophers who professed\nscientific exactitude (EMP, 80). But they had also\ntended to promote forms of moralising and theologising which were opposed to\nprecision and independence of thought and which were “detrimental\nto culture in general” (EMP, 87). Anderson\nthought his interpretation of traditional Aristotelian logic had an\nimportant role to play in the new world of literary culture as much as\nin the natural sciences. One major achievement of Hegel for Anderson was the encouragement\nhe gave to the study of Greek philosophers. Anderson’s lectures\nexplored the historical background to his propositional view of\nreality in the issues raised by the pre-Socratics and later in Plato’s\nDialogues. Like other modernist philosophers and novelists (and Hegel\nhimself), Anderson found in Heraclitus an inspirational\nalternative to what he came to regard as the sentimental and\nintellectually stifling idealism of his teachers. Anderson acknowledged that Heraclitus’ emphasis on the element Fire\nmight be read as a typically Ionian response to the question\n“what is the world made of”, but the more important theme\nis his treatment of fire purely as process, as transaction and\nexchange, as the paradigm element of strife and harmony. In embryo\nAnderson found in Heraclitus so many of his own principles: the close\nlink between logic and ethics (ethics as the field in which conflict\ncomes primarily to the fore); the single way of being, of “what\nis common” (the search for a general logic, a theory of the\ncommensurability of things in terms of a theory of process); the\nrecognition of complexity, conflict and strife underlying existing\nthings; the anti-sentimentality and pessimism which refuses to find\nsolace in unity; the hidden harmony of forces in balance preferable to\nthe open harmony of illusory unity; the unremitting attack on\nsubjectivist illusions of desiring or imagining things as we would\nlike them to be (unchanging and secure) rather than seeing them for\nwhat they are. For Anderson’s Heraclitus, “seeing things as they are”\nis seeing them as complex, active and changing; a perspective opposed\nto the optimistic, rationalist illusion of the simple, fixed and\nstatic. It is to see things as moving, historical, in process, and yet\nas in balance. Heraclitean “strife” is harmony: the things\nof everyday experience are positive and concrete because they are\ncontingent and historical. Anderson described this “fundamental\nstrain” in all fields of inquiry as that “between\nobjectivism and subjectivism”, between “critical\nthinking” recognising complexity and tension everywhere, and\n“rationalist illusion” seeking the fixed and\nsimple. (JAA, Lectures on Criticism 1955, number 11.)\nRationalism here shared with more primitive mythological thinking the\nquest for stability, security and moral uplift. Both have looked for\nsolutions at a higher level than the problems being addressed. Anderson’s teaching and writings constantly refer to the history of\nphilosophy, but Anderson was not a scholarly historian. He thought\nthat persistent philosophical issues and positions were evident\nthroughout history (eleaticism, for example, was a highly instructive\nand critical stage recurring throughout the history of the subject –\nfor example in Green’s criticisms of Hume’s particulars). The history\nof philosophy helped to emphasise the value of his own position. On\nthe other hand, his lectures and writings are laden with references to\nphilosophers, scientists, novelists, psychoanalysts and\nrevolutionaries. Nothing seems alien to even the most abstruse topic\nof discussion in his work. And his lectures were “great starters of\nhares” (Partridge’s reflections on Anderson’s teaching,\nin EAI). John Passmore acknowledges the inspiration\nof Anderson’s lectures in his own works on Hume, philosophical\nreasoning, Ralph Cudworth, perfectibility and his history of one\nhundred years of philosophy. Anderson wrote a Textbook on Logic in the early 1920s\n(JAA, Textbook on Logic, released 2010) and its fate\ntells us much about his philosophical ambitions. According to his\nbiographer, Anderson submitted the manuscript not to narrowly academic\npublishers but to A. R. Orage, the editor of The New Age\n(Kennedy 1995 p. 64), described by the historian of Scottish\nphilosophy, George Davie, as serving a readership “of libertarian and often\nleftist autodidacts” (Davie 1977 p. 57). Under Orage the journal was\nnonetheless a highly influential avant garde modernist vehicle for\nliterary and political criticism. Anderson conceived his logic to have\nwider cultural aims than merely codifying forms of reasoning and when\nOrage rejected the work due to its supposed eccentricity Anderson was\ndeeply disappointed. Logic for Anderson is concerned with statements, and not with\nquestions, commands, prescriptions, exhortations or other forms of\nexpression. Logic is concerned fundamentally with statements that\nraise an “objective issue” and these other forms of speech\ndo so only indirectly. (JAA, Lectures on Scientific\nMethod, c.1950.) Discourse implies a common logic of assertion,\nimplication and definition (EMP, 6). Apparent\ndifferences in logical form are due simply to different modes of\nexpression. Any statement, if it is saying anything at all, can be\nshown by transformation into logical form to be asserting some matter\nof fact: a description of a certain thing as being of a certain kind,\na claim that something is the case. Anderson’s students were set a\nrange of statements to be transformed into one of the four\nAristotelian propositional forms, traditionally designated as the A,\nE, I and O forms. In any field, until questions or issues are posed in\none of these four propositional forms they will inevitably be confused\nand potentially misleading bases for inquiry. So, from typical examination papers in Andersonian logic: In Anderson’s view of traditional logic, the universal proposition\n“All As are B” asserts the simple fact that\nall As are B; a thing’s being of a certain sort is the\nirreducible minimum of a fact or state of affairs; there is no\nassertion of some “general connection” over and above that fact. Nor\ndoes the universal proposition assert that some class relation holds\nbetween A and B – the assertion of a class\nrelation is just a way of saying that certain propositions are\ntrue. Nor is it about some totality A: it asserts simply of\neach and every A that it is B. And although it does not\ndirectly assert the existence of A, it certainly presupposes it. It is\nindeed the great virtue for Anderson of his version of traditional\nlogic that it fully brings out the existential presuppositions of the\nproposition. In addition, Anderson thinks that what are often taken to\nbe supreme logical truths (for example, identity statements) are not\ntruths at all, for they say nothing. There is no analytic truth: if a\nproposition says anything at all, it can be false. Anderson rejects\nthe view that mathematical truths are so only within a calculus, that\nis, derivable from a given set of chosen postulates. Anderson rejects Mill’s view that universal statements are\ngeneralisations from experience. Universal propositions cannot be\nderived by generalisation from particular experiences, because there\nsimply are no such immediate experiences. Such truths are derived from\nother universal propositions and tested in experience. In discussing\nthe functions of subjects, predicates and the copula in propositions\nand the logical relations between propositions, logic is already\ndiscussing universals, individuals, identity, space-time and\ncausality. And, contra Mill’s inductivism, because we have direct\nexperience of generality and of relations, a single instance is\nsufficient to establish the universal proposition (say, that all glass\nis brittle). Further investigation may challenge such assertions since\nall our beliefs are fallible but wholesale doubt is simply not an\noption. The logical gap between particulars and universals that\ninductive reasoning proposes is a gap that no amount of human\nreasoning could hope to span. Hume was right in this, but instead of\nembracing skepticism he should have concluded as did William James\nthat generality and relations are as much a part of our experience as\nare particulars. The validity of the syllogism is fundamental and Anderson rejects\nthe absolute independence from syllogistic reasoning of other forms of\nreasoning such as the relational, hypothetical and disjunctive. The\nsyllogism demonstrates clearly that the subject in one proposition can\nfunction as the predicate in another. The difference between subject\nand predicate is purely one of function: the function of the subject\nterm is to locate, that of the predicate to describe. There are not\ntwo classes of entities involved here; that is, there are no pure\nlocations/particulars/substances, just as there are no pure\ndescriptions/universals. There is no logical gap that needs to be\nspanned between subject and predicate terms: any term can play the\nrole of particular or general, subject or predicate.  For Anderson logic is the science of the most general features of\nreality. Logic is not simply a useful calculus following on from an\ninitial choice of primitives, and Anderson’s logic is not simply one\nversion of predicate calculus among others. His view is that logic\ndescribes the general structure of facts and the relations between\nthem. It provides the conditions of possibility for all discourse, but\nit is not about forms of language nor about special status entities\nsuch as universals. It is about the most general features of\nfacts. Underlying this propositional view of reality is the thesis\nthat things within space and time are irreducibly complex. Every\nsituation has both particular and general aspects represented by the\nsubject and predicate functions within the proposition. Every\npredicate can be the subject of a further proposition. The simplest\nunit is a being there and so, a state of affairs in which a particular\nis characterised in some specific way, but neither the particular nor\nthe universal could exist independently. We never arrive at absolutely\nsimple elements in any field. The quest for such simples urged by\nRussell, Moore and the early Wittgenstein indicated a residual\nrationalist element in their thinking. On the other hand, against the\nidealist opponents of these early realists, Anderson of course\ninsisted that no entities could be constituted, wholly or in part, by\ntheir relations (EMP, 43).  Mackie described Anderson as the last of the Aristotelian logicians\nand observed some awkward consequences for his conception of logic:\nthe problem of false propositions; the absence of a way of\ndealing with singular propositions; an inability to deal with multiple\nquantification; the difficulty in expressing relational\npropositions in subject-predicate and syllogistic form. For Mackie,\nany logic dealing with false propositions, relations of contradiction\nand contrariety, entertained arguments, falsifications and\nreductions ad absurdum must be something more than an account\nof propositions as what is there (Mackie 1985). Anderson distinguished idealism’s substance-attribute logic\nthat had been condemned by Russell from his own subject-predicate\nlogic. Nonetheless, his Aristotelian logic of everyday experience did\nseem to sit uneasily with the broader search for logics that could\nmore adequately capture forms of reasoning across a wide variety of\ndomains. Ontological logics like Anderson’s came to seem\n“naively realistic and Aristotelian”, and “hard to\nhang on to” in the history of twentieth century philosophy\n(Rorty 1986). It is not just that 20th century philosophy’s\n“counter-intuitive redescription and relativisation to choice of\nprimitives” (Rorty 1986) ignored Anderson’s insistence\nthat logic is not a calculus. Technical developments in the logic of\nmodal, tense and relational terms proceeded without reference to\nAnderson’s form of onto-logic. Nonetheless, a traditional form of metaphysics did make a\nresurgence in the last quarter of the century in the work of\nAnderson’s student, D. M. Armstrong. Armstrong accepts against\nAnderson that the nature of space and time is a matter for scientific\ninvestigation, as is the identification of real properties –\nAnderson’s view of three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time as\n“ontological bed-rock”, for example, simply cannot be sustained\n(Armstrong, introduction to STC). But he finds real\ninterest in Anderson’s conception of the categories, as elaborated in\nthe lectures on Samuel Alexander, recently published as Space,\nTime and the Categories: Lectures on Metaphysics\n(STC – published from typescript lectures in\nArmstrong’s possession and originally presented in 1949–50). In his\nintroduction to these lectures, Armstrong writes: In these lectures Anderson systematically derived the number of\ncategories and their ordering from the nature of the proposition and\nits subject-predicate structure. The result was a scheme of 13\ncategories, laid out in Hegel-like “succession” organized\nin three groups with the categories of Universality and Quantity\nacting as “link categories” in the two transitions between\nthe groups. Armstrong concludes: Despite his appreciation of Hegel, Anderson thought that Kant had\nlaid “the foundations for a logic of things as historical”\nand here “Hegel can be regarded only as reactionary”\n(EMP, 83). Kant had shown that the objects of science\nare just the objects of observation, that “matter” is\nsomething we perceive and not something lying behind our\nperceptions. Kant’s answer to Hume was that things perceived are\nconnected with one another; they pass through and affect one another\nin various ways because they are related in space and time. We are\naware of such relations in being aware of anything at all. But\nAnderson insists against Kant that relations are known on the same\nlevel as the related. Kant was still subject to the assumptions of\nrepresentationalism, and thought of the objects of science as mere\nphenomena. Kant viewed space and time as forms of intuition under\nwhich we must experience the world. He viewed the categories such as\ncausality and substance as forms of understanding under which we must\nunderstand the world. Things-in-themselves are not given to us in\nexperience, and so remain beyond our cognitive grasp. In this way Kant\nset up an untenable division in reality between phenomena and\nthings-in-themselves, and along with this division the idea that our\nthoughts, practices and forms of inquiry in some way create or\nconstitute the reality we inhabit, act upon and investigate. Anderson,\nfollowing Samuel Alexander, proposed a realist alternative such that\nspace and time would be considered not as forms of intuition, but as\nforms of being, the categories not as forms of understanding but as\ncategories of being, categories under which all being must fall. On\nsuch a proposal we can recognise the objects of science as\nthings-in-themselves. Anderson claimed to have avoided the pitfalls of traditional\nmetaphysical questions concerning the reality of universals through\nhis account of the proposition (cf., “‘Universals’\nand Occurrences”, EMP). H. O. Mounce has\nsuggested that Anderson’s realism may not be able to avoid the\nissue. In particular, his account of universals is in danger of\ncollapsing into nominalism on the question of whether the directly\nperceived relation (say, of causality) is on separate\noccasions one and the same (for Mounce, anything less than\ncomplete identity would be a retreat to nominalism – Mounce\n1989). Mounce suggests that Anderson may not be able to hold off a\nHumean challenge here. He would be drawn back to a familiar\nrealist-nominalist debate on the nature of universals, which may\nexplain why Armstrong’s philosophy takes seriously Plato’s question of\nthe one and the many as the starting point for metaphysical reflection\n(Armstrong 1997). From a Quinean perspective, however, Armstrong’s\nmetaphysics, despite its improved scientific credentials, remains\nattentive to old school pseudo-questions (Quine 1953). (Michael Devitt\nexplicitly associates Armstrong with Quine’s parody of the traditional\nscottish metaphysician “McX” in Devitt 2010.) For his more empirically-minded students, Anderson’s logic seemed\nto rely upon an unwelcome element of a priorism. Any\nweakening of our confidence in Anderson’s identification of logic and\nontology, for example, would critically undermine significant\ncomponents of the position. First, it would no longer be clear that\nthings spoken of together must exist in the same way – the\nnotion of a single level of being would become a matter for\ninvestigation (what kinds of differences exist) rather than determined\nby general principle (Mackie 1985). Regarding his social thought, the\nimportance of individuals’ behaviour in explaining the nature and\noperation of social movements and institutions would require\ninvestigation, rather than a pronouncement based purely on general\ngrounds. Again, Anderson’s rejection of the rationalist view that\nthere must be simple or ultimate units upon which complex\nthings can be built would not lead without further argument to the\nview that there cannot be such simple parts or totalities\n(Mackie 1985). According to Anderson, David Hume’s skepticism was a direct result\nof his inability to work out a logic, to create a coherent account of\nexistence. But his mentor at Edinburgh, Norman Kemp Smith, had long\nargued that Hume’s importance was in demonstrating the factual limits\nof all logic. If Hume had failed to work out a logic to Anderson’s\nsatisfaction this was because in his view philosophers should resist\nthe temptation of this kind of “systematic working out”\naltogether (Davie 1977). Hume’s reservations about a “systematic\nworking out” have emerged in another form with the\n“linguistic return” proposed by Huw Price, who became the \nfirst appointment to the Challis Chair of Philosophy within a united\ndepartment at Sydney since the split of 1974. Price\ndescribes the project as a “linguistic retooling of\nmetaphysics” (Price 2011, p. 18) and the attempt specifically to\navoid Mackie’s “placement” issue which arises from an\nobsession with the representational aspect of language (although\nMackie himself regarded this with Anderson as an ontological issue\n– see section 5.4 below). On Price’s view plurality exists in\nthe world of an entirely familiar kind: a plurality of ways of talking\nand ways of behaviour which don’t need to be mirrored in an ontology\nof any kind. It has been observed that Anderson’s most prominent students\naccepted in fact very little of his system. It is still the case that\ntheir most fundamental philosophical commitments can be traced to the\nboldness of Anderson’s position. And Armstrong suggests that the\nphilosopher at some point can only outline his or her most basic\ncommitments. In Armstrong’s case Stephen Mumford summarises the\nposition: no God, no non-spatial minds, no abstract entities beyond\nspace-time, no Platonic forms or realm of universals; an austere\nontology without transcendent universals, realm of numbers,\ntranscendent standards of value, timeless propositions, non-existent\nobjects, possibilia, possible worlds, abstract classes. (Mumford 2007\np. 5.) Armstrong diverges from Anderson in his emphasis upon\nscientific naturalism, in the position that the world is to be\ncompletely described in terms of a completed physics. What properties\nexist will ultimately be determined solely by science, and the results\nwill inevitably seem counter-intuitive within the perspective of\nAristotelian common sense. But for Armstrong this scientific view can\nbe reconciled with a form of metaphysical realism derived from\nAnderson’s teaching which takes universals to exist immanently rather\nthan in a transcendent realm; which takes the world to contain nothing\nbut particulars having properties and being related to each other;\nwhich takes the world to be nothing but a single spatio-temporal\nsystem; which regards reality as a world of states of affairs\nconceived as particulars bearing properties; which insists that states\nof affairs are the smallest units of existence since neither\nparticulars nor universals are capable of independent existence.  The Greeks, according to Anderson, Anderson’s Hegelian diagnoses of the obsessions of modern\nphilosophy and Cartesianism with epistemology are likely to elicit\nrecognition and appreciation from many contemporary\nreaders. Cartesianism in modern philosophy represented for Anderson an\nanti-classicist movement: an antipathy towards history and\ntradition. Modern philosophy searched within abstract rationality as\nthe ground of human knowledge, rather than in concrete and many-sided\nculture. The whole modern era was characterised by this lack of\nconcreteness (EMP, 195).  Hegel in this regard stands out as a lonely classical figure within\nthe history of modern philosophy. (EMP, 201)\nPhilosophy since Descartes has become infected by practicalism and\nprogressivism and logic has been reduced to the status of an\ninstrument, a generalised method for acquiring new knowledge. Along\nwith this instrumental view of logic came contempt for the syllogism,\nreplaced by Bacon with “inductive reasoning” and by\nDescartes with rational intuition.  Empiricism for Anderson is primarily the denial of any higher form\nof being, any other reality by which experienced reality can be found\nwanting, or dependent, or in a position of striving to emulate,\nand so forth. So also, the importance of modern realism lies not in\nits account of knowledge, but its development of a theory of\nindependence, the rejection of any conception of relative existence\nand the development of a logic of situations (JAA,\nPhilosophy II Distinction Lectures, 1937). There is no criterion of “truth”, “nothing by\nbelieving which we believe something else”\n(EMP, 55). Truth is simply what is conveyed by the\ncopula, the “is” of the proposition. It cannot reside in\ncorrespondence between a believed proposition and something else we\ncall reality, nor in relations between propositions in terms of\ncoherence. Propositions are not forms of words: we convey our beliefs\nby words, but what we are putting forward for acceptance is not the\nform of words but the state of affairs itself. Representionalist and\ncorrespondence theories of truth are “attempts to get behind the\nproposition – to maintain (in words!) that we mean more than we\ncan say.” (EMP, 5). We must abandon the notion\nof “thought” as something contrasted with or identified\nwith things. Our thoughts are just our dealings with things – Anderson\nshared with Norman Kemp Smith a quasi-calvinist conception of\nknowledge as a striving and grappling with problems rather than\nmirroring an external reality. Anderson dismisses most contemporary\nphilosophies as “varieties of representationalism”\n(EMP, 87). The proposition is not “about”\nanything in the sense of representing an external reality. Or rather,\nif it is “about” something, it is about the subject of the\nproposition itself.   One of Anderson’s most audacious articles was the 1934 “Mind\nas Feeling” which attempts to work out exactly how mentality\nshould be conceived as belonging to the spatio-temporal\nrealm. Anderson believed that once we admit the spatial nature of mind or\nof anything mental, “Cartesianism goes”\n(JAA, Lectures on Reid, 1935.) The mental realm\nconsists as much of situations as the natural and social world, so our\nknowledge of mind is on the same footing as the non-mental. He\nrepudiates the Cartesian subject-object model which sees philosophy’s\ntask as the study of the medium for knowledge understood as the\nrelation whereby one entity reproduces within itself the essence or\nintrinsic characteristics of some other entity. There is no such\nmedium for there are not different entities within space and time\nrequiring such mediation. There is no “knower” conceived\nas a point of consciousness that has stepped outside history, outside\nof space and time. In our striving and grappling with illusions so as\nto come to terms with ourselves and the things around us we never step\noutside the movement of things, nor see behind the proposition; never\nreach outside the realm of propositional claim and counter-claim. What is this thing that strives? Anderson adopts a Nietschean,\npre-Socratic view of mentality as a social structure of instincts and\npassions competing and cooperating. It is the emotions or feelings\nthemselves that strive. The passion of curiosity, for example, is the\nactual agent of inquiry. There is no entity of conscious willing that\ndirects our attention on the world. “Part of the deception, of\ncourse, part of the ‘analytic’ myth, is of an egoistic\ncharacter (‘what do I find when I set my analysis\nmachine rumbling?’), and this is opposed to the fact that\nlanguage and inquiry are inherent in social life, are at all stages\npart of communication.” (EMP, 181.) That critical inquiry itself rests on the existence of specific\nways of carrying on and proceeds from within some definite way of\nlife, provides one important link with the ethical aspect of\nAnderson’s thought. Such ways of life which lift individuals out of\ntheir humdrum existence and base material concerns are what Anderson\nregards as the embodiment of ethical goodness. For Anderson if the\ngood exists we must find it as a natural quality in this world, just\nas we come to know and identify other natural qualities. However, the\ngood is not merely something we discover, but “that by which we\ndiscover things” (EMP, 266). Anderson was aware\nthat his view of the good as a natural quality would not convince\neveryone, and that he could do little to convert the doubters. But he\nclaimed that there will be those who recognise the truth of his\nposition, seeing this view of the good as “something with which\nthey have long been in a certain way acquainted”\n(EMP, 267). “We do not, in fact, step out of the movement of things, ask\n‘What am I to do?’ and, having obtained an answer, step in\nagain. All our actions, all our questionings and answerings, are part\nof the movement of things.” (EMP, 241).  Positive ethical inquiry for Anderson is concerned with the\nidentification of good as a natural quality and he finds that this\nmost naturally pertains to certain actually existing practices and\nways of living in the world of common experience. Traditionally the\ngood has been identified abstractly as an end to be achieved or aimed\nfor, either as a transcendent reality to which we can only aspire (but\nwhich in some unexplained way is supposed to guide our moral actions)\nor as an end external to our actions in the real world and by which\nthose actions may be evaluated; for example, some optimal quantum of\nhappiness or welfare for the greatest number of people involved. In\neither case, a relational explanation is mistakenly offered in place\nof identifying a real quality. This has been the problem with\nvirtually all moral thought since the Greeks, although Anderson\nthought that G. E. Moore had made important advances in our thinking\non these matters. Anderson proposes that the good exists in forms of\nenterprise, productive activities capable of developing in a special\nway by means of “communication” – individuals are\ncaught up in these goods and in the process transcend their more\nimmediate and mundane goals and demands. Any theory of social life\nmust take account of activities with no formulated end: customs,\nregular forms of behaviour, and practices which precede the\nformulation of ends (JAA, Philosophical Implications\nof Marxism, 1945). Values have objective reality, but not in a transcendent realm\ndivorced from this world of facts or states of affairs. Anderson\nagrees that “the way things are” includes moral facts:\n“it is impossible to discuss social processes except in terms of\nways of living or forms of enterprise, and that is moral\ncharacterisation” (EMP, 330). But he cannot\naccept that moral characterisation entails moral prescription because\nthis would commit us to a morality of commands, and to programmes for\naction and reform designed to achieve a merely external good. The\nimportance of ethical inquiry is in giving an account\nof productive activities which entail the operation of a\ncertain mentality or spirit. Within such activities there is no\nquestion of external ends or rewards to be achieved. Goodness exists\nin free, spontaneous participation in such movements and activities\n(although not of course in the metaphysical sense of undetermined free\nwill – such practices, social movements and ways of life are not\nthings we as individuals “opt into” at will; they in a\nsense adopt us). Acting because we feel obliged so\nto act is on this view an indication of the absence of\ngoodness. Although the notion of “virtue” does not much\nappeal to him, Anderson’s emphasis upon the transformative role of\npractices and ways of life upon the ethical outlook of the individual\ndoes seem to accord with many of the major preoccupations of virtue\nethicists. Alasdair Macintyre recognises the value to contemporary\nAristotelian virtue ethics of Anderson’s Heraclitean appreciation of\nconflict and the importance he attributes to critical traditions\n(Macintyre 1981). Ethics is especially concerned to bring out the facts of conflict,\nthe opposition of different strains in things in general, but in human\nand mental life most particularly. The category of causality is\ncentral to the ethical sphere – false views of causality\nrepresent the attempt to escape conflict, to gain a standpoint above\nthat of strife and interlocking tensions (JAA,\nLectures on Criticism, 1954). Positive ethics exhibits the good life\nas constantly struggling with difficulties and other types of life\ndriven by external or instrumental considerations\n(JAA, Lectures on Greek Theories of Education,\n1954). The good exists in struggle and so cannot be made secure\n(JAA, Philosophy I Lectures, 1943). In all spheres of\nlife the good can only make its stand. Attempts at reconciliation and\ncompromise often obscure the issues and may well prove detrimental to\nthe good. The resulting Heraclitean harmony is best served by this\nstance of independence and intransigence. Sociological inquiry is appropriate for the bulk of traditional\nmoral terms. Forms of social organisation develop regular habits of\naction which come to be seen as obligatory: rights, duties and so\nforth are easily understood by those involved in the same way of\nlife. Bourgeois society is based on commodification and contractual\nrelations. The market destroys folk life and with it one important source by which\nculture can be refreshed (JAA, Lectures on Marx,\n1950). Marxism has made important advances in this area but Anderson\nnotes the “simple-mindedness” of most Marxists on moral\nquestions – altruism seems to be the peak of their thinking about\nmorality (Cf., remarks on Kautsky, EMP, 321) and\nlittle consideration is given to the importance of a plurality of ways\nof living. Participation in disinterested activities represents the ethical\nvalue of “devotion to a cause”. Anderson even offers a\nsociological interpretation of sin as a person’s sense of inadequacy\nto social movements, one’s inability to keep the flag flying, to\ndevote oneself thoroughly to these kinds of activity. Sin appears then\nas a kind of backsliding and subjectivism: the individual setting him\nor herself up as the standard. Anderson was opposed to all forms of\nreligious instruction and interference in educational practice, but he\noccasionally shocked his students with a quasi-theological\nappreciation of the existence of evil in the world. Passmore commented\nthat forms of religion that emphasise that our life is not of\nour making and that it goes on independently of our plans, are far more \npreferable in Anderson’s view to any form of secular sentimental humanism\n(Passmore, Introduction to EMP). J. L. Mackie regarded Anderson’s positive conception of goods as\nbeing “hopeless as an account of moral talk and reasoning”\n(Mackie 1985). However, despite being one of the current standard\nbearers for anti-realism in ethics the manner in which Mackie posed\nthe question of the subjectivity of values owes much to Anderson’s\nontological standpoint. Mackie seemed at pains to explain that his\nsubjectivist view of ethical terms complied with Anderson’s main\nconcern. Subjectivism in ethics is for Mackie the doctrine that\nobjective facts in this field do not include any descriptive\nassignment of goodness or rightness of actions. It is “precisely\nbecause we want to distinguish what is simply and absolutely the case\nthat we say values/obligations are relative.” (Mackie\n1985). Mackie suggested that linguistic philosophy had made the\nrealist-antirealist opposition a philosophical pseudo-question, and\nthat with renewed interest in ontological issues this opposition\nreturned in a pressing form in the “placement” issue\nregarding various “queer” entities in the world. Rush Rhees was a student of Anderson’s at Edinburgh and, of course,\nlater of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s. Like Mackie, he was critical of\nAnderson’s ethical theory, but from the other pole in that he was more\ninclined towards Anderson’s positive view of ethics. He regarded\nAnderson’s notion of a “way of life” as at some level the\nsame as Wittgenstein’s (Rhees 1969). But he came to think that\nAnderson paid too little attention to the ways in which moral\nquestions are posed for individuals, that Anderson too readily\nportrayed individual concerns as base, egocentric, low concerns in\ncontrast with the uplifting concerns resulting from participation in\nsocial movements. Anderson, Rhees concluded, had no appreciation for\nthe urgency with which moral questions presented themselves to\nindividuals (Rhees 1999, p. xiii), nor their distinctive character\ncompared to more practical questions of how to go on. However, Rhees\nalways emphasised the Andersonian lesson that values are rooted in\ndifferent traditions and movements. We have to resist the temptation\nto locate values in a realm which transcends these contexts. It is\nfutile to argue that the moral individual is located in a realm\noutside history, outside the particularities of space and time. Only\nin these contexts do the individual’s convictions, problems, struggles\nand difficulties have their sense. Resources for criticism of moral\ncodes exist within movements, and criticism develops only within ways\nof living. Notions of the “common good” generally conceal\nspecial interests (Rhees 1989, p. 53). Anderson’s moral and political thought was strongly influenced by\nthe writings of the French socialist Georges Sorel (and before him the\nlibertarian socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon). Although Anderson\nabandoned communism and socialism as movements whose time had passed,\nthe influence of these thinkers for whom socialism was a moral\nmovement remained with him (Cole 2009). In all fields of human\nactivity, there is a conflict between what Sorel described as the\n“ethic of the producer”, characterised by spontaneous and\ncooperative endeavour, and the ethic of the consumer, characterised by\nan instrumental morality of reward and punishment, obligation and\nexpectation, an ethic most perfectly suited in sociological terms to\nthe marketplace (and in purely psychological terms to the compulsive\nobligations of the neurotic personality). More accurately, for\nAnderson, the ethic of the consumer is an ethic without\na theme. In history there are classical periods of cultural\nachievement in contrast with periods in which we struggle to find a\ntheme at all; that is, periods in which nothing really happens,\nnothing develops from within. Anderson also admired Vico’s cyclical\nview of history and by the 1940s had not only resigned himself to the\ncollapse of heroic 19th century socialism, but discerned in the era of\npost-war optimism and state planning the early stages of one of Vico’s\nperiods of barbarism (EMP, 290). More positively, for\nAnderson the rejection of all totalising views, the thesis that\n“no formula covers all things”, has the practical\nconsequence of supporting and encouraging “a life of\nresponsibility and adventure” for those prepared to face the\nsituation (EMP, 86). Anderson intended to combat the influence of idealism in our\nthinking on political issues evident since Plato’s Republic. The\nmodernist, realist project he meant to develop in opposition to the\npolitical outlook of British Idealism would draw upon the major\ntheorists of conflict, struggle and cyclic historical movement:\nHeraclitus, Vico and Sorel. In place of a simple contrast between\nindividual and state Anderson insisted upon the complex interplay of\nmovements, institutions and traditions. In place of an unargued\ntendency towards ever greater social harmony he insisted on the\ninevitability of conflict and constant adjustment, the persistent\ndanger of regress, and the consequent need for clear lines of critical\nengagement. Order is a Heraclitean state of balance between complex\ninteracting forces rather than a normative standard by which to\nmeasure existing social and political formations. Conflict is not an\nindication of social dysfunction which needs to be overcome or\nrationalised away, but a necessary feature of any social\ninstitution. Any notion of an ideal state without such features can\nhave no bearing on our present real life situation. Anderson’s political thought is distinctive for his rejection of\nthe state as the fundamental object of political investigation and\nreflection. This aspect of his thought aligns rather strongly with\nmodern Nietschean and anti-humanist political thought. For Anderson\nthe social is not reducible to agreements among atomic individuals. In\nhis anti-individualist statements, however, he seems to echo an\nidealist view of social movements portrayed, for example, by Bernard\nBosanquet who similarly decried the “repellant isolation” of atomist\nindividualism. Culture and human achievement depend upon the capacity\nof human beings to engage in activities that take them outside\nthemselves. Apart from these struggles with nature or within broad\nsocial movements, a person collapses into non-entity. (Bosanquet 1899,\npp. xxxiii ff.)  Anderson’s rejection of good as an end to be achieved applied to\nhis ultimate rejection of socialism as a progressive movement and of\nMarxism in particular. “The doctrine of history as struggle is at once\nthe liberal and the scientific part of Marxism; the doctrine of\nsocialism as something to be established (‘classless society’) is its\nservile part” (EMP, 339). Socialism for Anderson\nwas not a goal to be achieved but a movement to be joined. The\namelioration of social conditions of the workers would be achieved by\nthe workers themselves in the process of asserting the value and\nvalidity of their way of life within the wider socio-political\nsphere. But once alleviation became the primary goal of the workers’\nmovement and representatives, that movement was finished as a\nprogressive and liberating force. It could be bought off by employers\nand the state. Socialism understood as a force lobbying for state\naction and funding to redress market inequities had become mired in\n“servility” as a matter of historical fact. In the 1950s, Anderson retreated from broad political theory which\nhad been a feature of his lectures and writings of the 1940s, and\nattended more to local and institutional questions. This new emphasis\nemerged in his lectures on education and on criticism. Central to\nAnderson’s view of education is the rejection of any utilitarian or\ninstrumental view of education, the view of education as a means to\nsome other purpose. Education needs to be understood as an activity\nwith positive characteristics of its own. Education is critical,\ndevoted to developing and discarding hypotheses, to seeing through\npretensions of all kinds. It means for the individual “finding a way\nof life” and it affects the whole life of the educated\nindividual. Critical intellectual life survives as a social tradition,\na “movement” to which individuals are attracted and in which they are\ncaught up. Anderson’s classicism promotes the history of European culture from\nthe early Greeks as a tradition of critical thought that can refresh\nand fortify contemporary education against the predations of\npracticalism and servility in the modern world. Education is concerned with \ntraining in taste and judgement. The educated individual is not\nshackled by the assumptions of his society or\ngroup. (JAA, Lectures on the Educational Theories of\nSpencer and Dewey, 1949). But to play its part, education must resist\noutside standards (such as those set by the attitudes and capacities\nof commercial society, or by the vocational needs of business) as to\nwhat is to be allowed and valued in institutions of education. Rhees\nsuggested that Anderson was primarily concerned with a “grammar\nschool education”, one not suited to the “masses”\n(Rhees 1969 p. 168). In particular, for Anderson, vocational and\nmoralistic standards have to be resisted. True learning is not easy\nand cannot be made easy – it advances only through overcoming\nresistances. The inquiring life has to stand up for itself. It is just\nas real, just as practical, just as positive a part of society as\nother activities (J. L. Mackie, in EAI). Any activity or institution of learning can proceed only along the\nlines of certain traditions with custodians and in terms of common\nactivities. (JAA, Lectures on Greek Theories of\nEducation, 1954). For education is simply one struggling tendency in\nsociety itself among others – even within institutions supposedly devoted to\neducational aims, true educational values have to be fought for.  Anderson’s lectures on education are of interest because they\ninclude the most extensive account of his appreciation for the\nclassicism of Matthew Arnold, but more particularly of his attitude\ntowards the philosophy of John Dewey. Besides his early\nacknowledgement of the importance of William James (at least the more\nmetaphysical writings on radical empiricism) and his critical articles\non F. C. S. Schiller, the consideration of Dewey’s educational theory\nis the most important reflection on American pragmatism in Anderson’s\nwork. The question of the relation of theory to practice was one that\nexercised Anderson repeatedly. His position was that the connection\nwas a close one, but not in the direction that he assumed pragmatism\nurged. Theory was not dependent upon practice for the validity of its\nfindings. Rather inquiry proceeded from particular kinds of\npractice. Certain forms of life made possible an objective view of\nthings. Moreover, theory was not subsidiary to practice in an\ninstrumental sense because it was itself a distinct form of practice\nwith its own requirements and standards. Anderson reflected upon this\nquestion both in the lectures on education but also in his lectures on\nMarxism and most particularly on Marx’s Theses on Feuerbach\nwhere he was concerned to dispute Sidney Hook’s pragmatist reading of\nthe theses (JAA, Philosophical Implications of\nMarxism). Both the fact of his consideration of the\nenigmatic Theses and his substantial conclusions on the\nrelation of theory to practice would have resonated with the\nAlthusserian Marxists in the Department of General Philosophy in the 1970s.  Anderson’s influence extended beyond the confines of the\nacademy. One of Anderson’s students, a young man from the\nPacific island of Tonga, Futa Helu, later claimed that John\nAnderson’s realism had revolutionised his thinking, particularly\nwith reference to the notion of “tapu” or the sacred, as\nthe cover-up for the special demands of the ruling class in\nTonga. Returning to Tonga in the early 1960s, he founded the\nAtenisi (Athens) Institute as an independent high school\nbased on the ideals of Greek philosophy. He added “Atenisi\nUniversity” in 1975, where the philosophical thought of\nHeraclitus as interpreted by Anderson became the backbone of\nphilosophy courses. Following Anderson’s example of public\nengagement, Helu is credited as one of the intellectual architects of\nthe democracy movement in Tonga. (Keith Campbell, personal\ncommunication). Anderson’s influence on the self-styled “Sydney Push”\nis more widely known. The latter was a diffuse sub-culture of\nanarchist libertarians who met around Sydney’s inner city in the 1950s\nand 1960s. Members were imbued with a spirit of anti-careerism, and a\nmajor influence in their meetings, talks and drinking sessions was the\nphilosophy of John Anderson who had lectured many of them on the value\nof risk, endeavour, withdrawal from consumerist society and the\noverriding value of criticism to the health of a society. Through his\ninfluence on many of these figures, Anderson affected the tone of\nintellectual debate and discussion in Sydney and beyond. If the key\nfigures of the movement are relatively unknown, there were more famous\nfigures who moved through this environment and were on their own\naccounts deeply affected by its intellectual stimulus: such figures as\nGermaine Greer, Robert Hughes and Clive James. More centrally involved with the life of the Push over an extended\nperiod and more particularly with the direct teachings of John\nAnderson was the anarchist activist and philosopher George Molnar. He\nattended Anderson’s lectures in the 1950s and was active in debates on\nmetaphysical questions in the 1960s associated with Armstrong and\nC. B. Martin. Students recall Armstrong and Molnar in the university\nquadrangle around 1970 arguing about dispositions and powers with an\nintensity no doubt propelled by their political disagreements at the\ntime. Molnar conducted courses on anarchism and education theory in\nthe early 1970s but in 1976 resigned his position at the university, a\nmove consistent with the anti-careerist ethos of the Push and of the\nradical politics of the time. Perhaps he also found his philosophical\ninterests on the wrong side of an irreconcilable split\nwithin the department. Some thirty years later, he returned to\nacademic life to take up a part-time position as John Anderson\nResearch Fellow at the University of Sydney, but died unexpectedly in\n2002. His book Powers: a study in metaphysics was published\nposthumously in 2007 by Oxford University Press at the urging of his\nold adversary D. M. Armstrong. While sharing some of the deflationary ambitions of linguistic,\nscientific and pragmatist philosophies with respect to traditional\nmetaphysics and rationalism, Anderson’s philosophy was a singular\nexpression of twentieth century philosophy emerging from the world of\n19th century idealism. Not only are the terms Anderson employs\nsystematically misleading to contemporary readers; his work belongs to\na world of higher philosophical ambition, a world in which philosophy\ncould aspire to a central role in cultural affairs, unlike the\n“rickety philosophical apparatus” and the whole\n“intellectual mess” that he saw in mid-century philosophy\n(EMP, 187–88). The current lack of philosophical interest in Anderson seems to\nderive as much from external factors related to his place in\nAustralian intellectual life as from the intrinsic qualities of his\nwork. This is due in part to his posthumous role in the culture wars\nprompted by his strongly anti-communist stance in the 1950s. Any\nconsideration of his work soon becomes entangled in unwelcome and\nextraneous debates. Moreover, compounding “a certain\nPresbyterian intransigence” in his personality\n(EAI, 22), Anderson’s conception of philosophy as\nsomething of a master discipline legislating legitimate forms of\ninquiry in the sciences, psychology, social studies, literature,\nlinguistics, and the humanities made him an unpopular figure in the\nacademy (cf. Partridge’s and Kamenka’s accounts of their studies with\nAnderson in EAI). David Armstrong describes Anderson as “a failed great\nphilosopher – he played for higher stakes than the rest of\nus” (personal communication). A certain ambivalence creeps into\nsuch assessments of his importance. On the other hand, while there are\nthose who regard Anderson as almost heroically holding out against\nfalse philosophical fashions, there are many who regard his dominance\nat Sydney as wholly negative: his indifference to developments in\ntechnical logic since the 19th century, to developments in theoretical\nphysics and to philosophical interest in linguistic usage and the\nnature of scientific inquiry. Did Anderson sustain traditional\nphilosophical values and standards of inquiry in the face of\nfragmentary and unsound philosophical trends, or did he cut Sydney\nstudents off from the life blood of international philosophical and\nscientific exposure? The philosophical prominence of many of his\nstudents strongly suggests the former, but even his most loyal\nfollowers recognise in his educational practice a tendency to promote\nuncritical conformity. In the end the issue concerns the value and depth of a tradition of\nphilosophical inquiry and apprenticeship, weighed against the\nopportunity costs of pursuing such a tradition to the exclusion of all\nothers. This question was posed rather urgently a decade after\nAnderson’s death when the department of philosophy at Sydney split\ninto two distinct units, immediately on political grounds, but\ninevitably also over the nature of philosophical inquiry and study\nitself. Although the department was eventually re-united as a single\nprofessional and productive unit, its members have very little\ninterest in revisiting a troubled history. And this applies most\nparticularly to the highly distinctive work and legacy of Professor\nJohn Anderson, the dominant force in philosophy at Sydney for much of\nthe twentieth century.","contact.mail":"creaghmcole@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
