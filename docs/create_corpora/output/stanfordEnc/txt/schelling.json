Fichte and G.W.F. Hegel, one of the three most influential\nthinkers in the tradition of ‘German Idealism’. Although\nhe is often regarded as a philosophical Proteus who changed his\nconception so radically and so often that it is hard to attribute one\nclear philosophical conception to him, Schelling was in fact often an\nimpressively rigorous logical thinker. In the era during which\nSchelling was writing, so much was changing in philosophy that a\nstable, fixed point of view was as likely to lead to a failure to\ngrasp important new developments as it was to lead to a defensible\nphilosophical system. Schelling’s continuing importance today relates\nmainly to three aspects of his work. The first is his\nNaturphilosophie, which, although its empirical claims are\nlargely indefensible, opens up the possibility of a modern hermeneutic\nview of nature that does not restrict nature’s significance to what\ncan be established about it in scientific terms. The second is his\nanti-Cartesian account of subjectivity, which prefigures some of the\nmost influential ideas of thinkers like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and\nJacques Lacan, in showing how the thinking subject cannot be fully\ntransparent to itself. The third is his later critique of Hegelian\nIdealism, which influenced Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Heidegger,\nand others, and aspects of which are echoed by thinkers like T.W.\nAdorno and Jacques Derrida. Schelling’s focus on humankind’s relationship to nature has gained particular relevance as the seriousness of the climate emergency has become fully apparent in recent years.\n\nSchelling was born in Leonberg near Stuttgart on 27 January 1775. He\nattended a Protestant seminary in Tübingen from 1790 to 1795,\nwhere he was close friends with both Hegel and the poet and\nphilosopher Friedrich Hölderlin. He moved to Leipzig in 1797,\nthen to Jena, where he came into contact with the early Romantic\nthinkers, Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis, and, via Goethe’s influence,\ntook up his first professorship from 1798 to 1803. From 1803 to 1806\nhe lived in Würzburg, whence he left for Munich, where he mainly\nlived from 1806 onwards, with an interruption from 1820 to 1827, when\nhe lived in Erlangen. He moved to Berlin in 1841 to take up what had,\nuntil Hegel’s death in 1831, been Hegel’s chair of philosophy.\nAlthough his lectures in Berlin were initially attended by such\nluminaries as Kierkegaard, Engels, Bakunin, Ranke, Burkhardt, and\nAlexander von Humboldt, he soon came to be largely ignored by most of\nthe leading thinkers of the day. It is clear, however, that his\nphilosophical thought still influenced many who rejected him on mainly\npolitical grounds. He died on 20 August 1854 in Bad Ragaz,\nSwitzerland. Schelling’s influence on many directions in modern\nphilosophy has been seriously underestimated in the English-speaking\nworld, though sustained new attention to his work in recent years has\nincreasingly brought him into contemporary debates about naturalism,\nfreedom, aesthetics, epistemology, and ontology.  \nThe significance of the work of the early Schelling (1795–1800)\nlies in its attempts to give a new account of nature which, while\ntaking account of the fact that Kant had irrevocably changed the\nstatus of nature in modern philosophy, avoids some of the consequences\nof Kant’s theory that were seen as problematic by Kant’s\ncontemporaries and successors. For the Kant of the Critique of\nPure Reason (1781, 1787) nature is largely seen in the\n‘formal’ sense, as that which is subject to necessary\nlaws. These laws are accessible to us, Kant argues, because cognition\ndepends on the subject bringing forms of thought, the\ncategories, to bear on what it perceives. The problem this leads to is\nhow the subject could fit into a nature conceived of in deterministic\nterms, given that the subject’s ability to know is dependent upon its\n‘spontaneous’ self-caused ability to judge in terms of the\ncategories. Kant’s response to this dilemma is to split the\n‘sensuous’ realm of nature as law-bound appearance from\nthe ‘intelligible’ realm of the subject’s cognitive and\nethical self-determination. However, if the subject is part of nature\nthere would seem to be no way of explaining how a nature which we can\nonly know as deterministic can give rise to a subject which\nseems to transcend determinism in its knowing and in its\nself-determined actions. Kant himself sought to bridge the realms of\nnecessity and spontaneity in the Critique of Judgement\n(1790), by suggesting that nature itself could be seen in more than\nformal terms: it also produces self-determining organisms and gives\nrise to disinterested aesthetic pleasure in the subject that\ncontemplates its forms. The essential problems remained, however, that\n(1) Kant gave no account of the genesis of the subject that transcends\nits status as a piece of determined nature, and (2) such an account\nwould have to be able to bridge the divide between nature and freedom.\n \nThe tensions in Schelling’s philosophy of this period, which set the\nagenda for most of his subsequent work, derive, then, from the need to\novercome the perceived lack in Kant’s philosophy of a substantial\naccount of how nature and freedom come to co-exist. Two ways out of\nKantian dualism immediately suggested themselves to thinkers in the\n1780s and 90s. On the one hand, Kant’s arguments about the division\nbetween appearances and things in themselves, which gave rise to the\nproblem of how something ‘in itself’ could give rise to\nappearances for the subject, might be overcome by rejecting the notion\nof the thing in itself altogether. If what we know of the object is\nthe product of the spontaneity of the I, an Idealist could argue that\nthe whole of the world’s intelligibility is therefore the result of\nthe activity of the subject, and that a new account of subjectivity is\nrequired which would achieve what Kant had failed to achieve. On the\nother hand, the fact that nature gives rise to self-determining\nsubjectivity would seem to suggest that a monist account of a nature\nwhich was more than a concatenation of laws, and was in some sense\ninherently ‘subjective’, would offer a different way of\naccounting for what Kant’s conception did not provide. Schelling seeks\nanswers to the Kantian problems in terms that relate to both these\nconceptions. Indeed, it is possible to argue that the conceptions are\nin one sense potentially identical: if the essence of nature is that\nit produces the subjectivity which enables it to understand itself,\nnature itself could be construed as a kind of\n‘super-subject’. The main thinkers whose work is regarded as exemplifying\nthese alternatives are J.G. Fichte, and Spinoza. \nThe source of Schelling’s concern with Spinoza is the ‘Pantheism\ncontroversy’, which brought Spinoza’s monism into the mainstream\nof German philosophy. In 1783 the writer and philosopher F.H. Jacobi\nbecame involved in an influential dispute with the Berlin\nEnlightenment philosopher Moses Mendelssohn over the claim that G.E.\nLessing had admitted to being a Spinozist, an admission which at that\ntime was tantamount to the admission of atheism, with all the\ndangerous political and other consequences that entailed. In his\nOn the Doctrine of Spinoza in Letters to Herr Moses\nMendelssohn, (1785, second edition 1789), which was influenced by\nhis reading of Kant’s first Critique, Jacobi revealed a\nproblem which would recur in differing ways throughout Schelling’s\nwork. Jacobi’s interpretation of Spinozism was concerned with the\nrelationship between the ‘unconditioned’ and the\n‘conditioned’, between God as the ground of which the laws\nof nature are the consequent, and the linked chains of the\ndeterministic laws of nature. Cognitive explanation relies, as Kant\nclaimed, upon finding a thing’s ‘condition’. Jacobi’s\nquestion is how finding a thing’s condition can finally ground its\nexplanation, given that each explanation leads to a regress in which\neach condition depends upon another condition ad infinitum.\nAny philosophical system that would ground the explanation of a part\nof nature thus “necessarily ends by having to discover\nconditions of the unconditioned” (Scholz, ed.,\n1916, p. 51). For Jacobi this led to the need for a theological leap\nof faith, as the world’s intelligibility otherwise threatened to\nbecome a mere illusion, in which nothing would be finally grounded at\nall. In the 1787 Introduction to the first Critique Kant\nmaintains this problem of cognitive grounding can be overcome by\nacknowledging that, while reason must postulate the\n“unconditioned (…) in all things in themselves for\neverything conditioned, so that the series of conditions should thus\nbecome complete” (Kant, Critique of Pure Reason B, p.\nXX), by restricting knowledge to appearances, rather than assuming it\nto be of “things in themselves”, the contradiction of\nseeking conditions of the unconditioned can be avoided. As we have\nalready seen, though, this gives rise precisely to the problem of how\na subject which is not conditioned like the nature it comes to know\ncan emerge as the ground of knowledge from deterministic nature. \nThe condition of the knowledge of appearances for Kant is the\n‘transcendental subject’, but what sort of\n‘condition’ is the transcendental subject? The perception\nthat Kant has no proper answer to this problem initially unites\nSchelling and Fichte. Fichte insists in the\nWissenschaftslehre (1794) that the unconditioned status of\nthe I has to be established if Kant’s system is to legitimate itself.\nHe asserts that “It is (…) the ground of explanation of\nall facts of empirical consciousness that before all positing in the I\nthe I itself must previously be posited” (Fichte 1971, p. 95),\nthereby giving the I the founding role which he thought Kant had\nfailed adequately to explicate. Fichte does this by extending the\nconsequences of Kant’s claim that the cognitive activity of the I, via\nwhich it can reflect upon itself, cannot be understood as\npart of the causal world of appearances, and must therefore be part of\nthe noumenal realm, the realm of the ‘unconditioned’. For\nFichte the very existence of philosophy depends upon the free act of\nthe I which initiates the reflection on its own activity by the I. \nSchelling takes up the issues raised by Jacobi and Fichte in two texts\nof 1795: Of the I as Principle of Philosophy or on the\nUnconditional in Human Knowledge, and Philosophical Letters\non Dogmatism and Criticism. In a move which prefigures aspects of\nHeidegger’s questioning of the notion of being, he reinterprets Kant’s\nquestion as to the condition of possibility of synthetic judgements a\npriori as a question about why there is a realm of judgements, a\nmanifest world requiring syntheses by the subject for knowledge to be\nproduced, at all. In Of the I, Schelling puts Kant’s question\nin Fichtean terms: “how is it that the absolute I goes out of\nitself and opposes a Not-I to itself?” (Sämmtliche\nWerke [SW], I/1, p. 175). He maintains that the condition\nof knowledge, the ‘positing’ by the I of that which is\nopposed to it, must have a different status from the determined realm\nwhich it posits: “nothing can be posited by itself as a thing,\ni.e. an absolute/unconditioned thing (unbedingtes Ding) is a\ncontradiction” (ibid., p. 116). However, his key worry\nabout Fichte’s position already becomes apparent in the\nPhilosophical Letters, where he drops the Fichtean\nterminology: “How is it that I step at all out of the\nabsolute and move towards something opposed (auf ein\nEntgegengesetztes)?” (ibid., p. 294). The problem\nSchelling confronts was identified by his friend Hölderlin, in\nthe light of Jacobi’s formulation of the problem of the\n‘unconditioned’. Fichte wished to understand the absolute\nas an I in order to avoid the problem of nature ‘in\nitself’ which creates Kantian dualism. For something to be an I,\nthough, it must be conscious of an other, and thus in a relationship\nto that other. The overall structure of the relationship could not,\ntherefore, be described from only one side of that relationship.\nHölderlin argued that one has to understand the structure of the\nrelationship of subject to object in consciousness as grounded in\n‘a whole of which subject and object are the parts’, which\nhe termed ‘being’. This idea will be vital to Schelling at\nvarious times in his philosophy. \nIn the 1790s, then, Schelling is seeking a way of coming to terms with\nthe ground of the subject’s relationship to the object world. His aim\nis to avoid the fatalist consequences of Spinoza’s system by taking on\nkey aspects of Kant’s and Fichte’s transcendental philosophy, and yet\nnot to fall into the trap Hölderlin identified in Fichte’s\nconception of an absolute I. In his Naturphilosophie\n(philosophy of nature), which emerges in 1797 and develops in the\nsucceeding years, and in the System of Transcendental\nIdealism of 1800, Schelling wavers between a Spinozist and a\nFichtean approach to the ‘unconditioned’. In the\nNaturphilosophie the Kantian division between appearing\nnature and nature in itself is seen as resulting from the fact that\nthe nature theorised in cognitive judgements is objectified in\nopposition to the knowing subject. This objectification, the result of\nthe natural sciences’ search for fixed laws, fails to account for the\nliving dynamic forces in nature, including those in our own organism,\nwith which Kant himself became concerned in the third\nCritique and other late work, and which had played a role in\nLeibniz’s account of nature. Nature in itself is thought of by\nSchelling as a ‘productivity’: “As the object\n[qua ‘conditioned condition’] is never\nabsolute/unconditioned (unbedingt) then something per se\nnon-objective must be posited in nature; this absolutely non-objective\npostulate is precisely the original productivity of nature” (SW\nI/3, p. 284). The Kantian dualism between things in themselves and\nappearances is a result of the fact that the productivity can never\nappear as itself and can only appear in the form of\n‘products’, which are the productivity\n‘inhibiting’ itself. The products are never complete in\nthemselves: they are like the eddies in a stream, which temporarily\nkeep their shape via the resistance of the movement of the fluid to\nitself that creates them, despite the changing material flowing\nthrough them. \nSchelling next tries to use the insights of transcendental philosophy,\nwhile still avoiding Kant’s dualism, to explain our knowledge of\nnature. The vital point is that things in themselves and\n‘representations’ cannot be absolutely different because\nwe know a world which exists independently of our will, which can yet\nbe affected by our will: \nThe Naturphilosophie includes ourselves within nature, as\npart of an interrelated whole, which is structured in an ascending\nseries of ‘potentials’ that contain a polar opposition\nwithin themselves. The model is a magnet, whose opposing poles are\ninseparable from each other, even though they are opposites. As\nproductivity nature cannot be conceived of as an object, since it is\nthe subject of all possible real ‘predicates’, of the\n‘eddies’ of which transient, objective nature consists.\nHowever, nature’s ‘inhibiting’ itself in order to become\nsomething determinate means that the ‘principle of all\nexplanation of nature’ is ‘universal duality’, an\ninherent difference of subject and object which prevents nature ever\nfinally reaching stasis (SW I/3, p. 277). At the same time this\ndifference of subject and object must be grounded in an identity which\nlinks them together, otherwise all the problems of dualism would just\nreappear. In a decisive move for German Idealism, Schelling parallels\nthe idea of nature as an absolute producing subject, whose predicates\nare appearing objective nature, with the spontaneity of the thinking\nsubject, which is the condition of the syntheses required for the\nconstitution of objectivity, thus for the possibility of predication\nin judgements. The problem for Schelling lies in explicating how these\ntwo subjects relate to each other. \nIn the System of Transcendental Idealism Schelling goes back\nto Fichtean terminology, though he will soon abandon most of it. He\nendeavours to explain the emergence of the thinking subject from\nnature in terms of an ‘absolute I’ coming retrospectively\nto know itself in a ‘history of self-consciousness’ that\nforms the material of the system. The System recounts the\nhistory of which the transcendental subject is the result. A version\nof the model Schelling establishes will be adopted by Hegel in the\nPhenomenology of Mind. Schelling presents the process in\nterms of the initially undivided I splitting itself in order to\narticulate itself in the syntheses, the ‘products’, which\nconstitute the world of knowable nature. The founding stages of this\nprocess, which bring the world of material nature into being, are\n‘unconscious’. These stages then lead to organic nature,\nand thence to consciousness and self-consciousness. Schelling claims,\nin the wake of Fichte, that the resistance of the noumenal realm to\ntheoretical knowledge results from the fact that “the\n[practical] act [of the absolute I] via which all limitation is\nposited, as condition of all consciousness, does not itself come to\nconsciousness” (SW I/3, p. 409). He prophetically attempts to\narticulate a theory which comes to terms with the idea that thought is\ndriven by forces which are not finally transparent to it, of the kind\nlater to become familiar in psychoanalysis. How, though, does one gain\naccess by thought to what cannot be an object of consciousness? This\naccess is crucial to the whole project because without it there can be\nno understanding of why the move from determined nature to the freedom\nof self-determining thinking takes place at all. \nSchelling adopts the idea from the early Romantic thinkers Friedrich\nSchlegel and Novalis, whom he knew in Jena at this time, that art is\nthe route to an understanding of what cannot appear as an object of\nknowledge. Philosophy cannot represent nature in itself because access\nto the unconscious must be via what appears to\nconsciousness in the realm of theoretical knowledge. The work of art\nis evidently an empirical, appearing object like any other, but if it\nis not more than what it is qua determinable object it cannot\nbe a work of art, because this requires both the free judgement of the\nsubject and the object’s conveying of something beyond its objective\nnature. Although the System’s own very existence depends upon\nthe transition from theoretical to practical philosophy, which\nrequires the breaking-off of Jacobi’s chain of\n‘conditions’ by something unconditioned, Schelling is\nconcerned to understand how the highest insight must be into reality\nas a product of the interrelation of both the ‘conscious’\nand the ‘unconscious’. Reality is not, therefore,\nessentially captured by a re-presentation of the objective by the\nsubjective. Whereas in the System nature begins unconsciously\nand ends in conscious philosophical and scientific knowledge, in the\nart work: “the I is conscious according to the production,\nunconscious with regard to the product” (SW I/3, p. 613). The\nproduct cannot be understood via the intentions of its producer, as\nthis would mean that it became a ‘conditioned’ object,\nsomething produced in terms of a pre-existing rule, and would\ntherefore lack what makes mere craft into art. Art is, then,\n“the only true and eternal organ and document of philosophy,\nwhich always and continuously documents what philosophy cannot\nrepresent externally” (ibid., p. 627). The particular\nsciences can only follow the chain of conditions, via the principle of\nsufficient reason, and must determine any object via its place in that\nchain, a process which has no necessary end. The art object, on the\nother hand, manifests what cannot be understood in terms of its\nknowable conditions, because an account of the materials of which it\nis made or of its status as object in the world does not constitute it\nas art. Art shows what cannot be said. Philosophy cannot positively\nrepresent the absolute because ‘conscious’ thinking\noperates from the position where the ‘absolute identity’\nof the subjective and the objective has always already been lost in\nthe emergence of consciousness. \nAlthough Schelling’s early work did not fully satisfy either himself,\nor anybody else, it manages to address, in a cogent and illuminating\nfashion, many topics which affect subsequent philosophy. The model\npresented in the System impresses not least because, at the\nsame time as establishing the notion of the history of\nself-consciousness that would be decisive for Hegel, it offers, in a\nmanner which goes beyond its sources in Fichte, a model of the\nrelationship between the subject and its conceptually inaccessible\nmotivating forces which would affect thinkers from Schopenhauer, to Nietzsche, to Freud, and beyond. \nAlthough the period of Schelling’s ‘identity philosophy’\nis usually dated from the 1801 Presentation of My System of\nPhilosophy until sometime before the 1809 On the Essence of\nHuman Freedom, the project of that philosophy can be said to be\ncarried on in differing ways throughout his work. The identity\nphilosophy derives from Schelling’s conviction that the self-conscious\nI must be seen as a result, rather than as the originating act it is\nin Fichte, and thus that the I cannot be seen as the generative matrix\nof the whole system. This takes him more in the direction of Spinoza,\nbut the problem is still that of articulating the relationship between\nthe I and the world of nature, without either reverting to\nKantian dualism or failing to explain how a purely objective nature\ncould give rise to subjectivity. \nSchelling’s mature identity philosophy, which is contained in the\nSystem of the Whole of Philosophy and of Naturphilosophie in\nParticular, written in Würzburg in 1804, and in other texts\nbetween 1804 and 1807, breaks with the model of truth as\ncorrespondence. It does so because: \nThe crucial problem is how to explain the link between the\nsubject and object world that makes judgements possible, and this\ncannot be achieved in terms of how a subject can have thoughts which\ncorrespond to an object essentially separate from it. For there to be\njudgements at all what is split and then synthesised in the judgement\nmust, Schelling contends, in some way already be the same. This has\noften been understood as leading Schelling to a philosophy in which,\nas Hegel puts it in the Phenomenology, the absolute is the\n‘night in which all cows are black’, because it swallows\nall differentiated knowledge in the assertion that everything is\nultimately the same, namely an absolute which excludes all relativity\nfrom itself and thus becomes inarticulable. This is not a valid\ninterpretation of Schelling’s argument. In an early version of the\nidentity philosophy he had said the following: \nIn order to try to get over the problem in monism of how the One is\nalso the many, Schelling, following the idea outlined above from\nHölderlin, introduces a notion of ‘transitive’ being,\nwhich links mind and matter as predicates of itself. Schelling\nexplains this ‘transitivity’ via the metaphor of the\nearth: \n‘Absolute identity’ is, then, the link of the two\naspects of being, which, on the one hand, is the universe,\nand, on the other, is the changing multiplicity which the\nknowable universe also is. Schelling insists now that “The\nI think, I am, is, since Descartes, the basic\nmistake of all knowledge; thinking is not my thinking, and being is\nnot my being, for everything is only of God or the totality” (SW\nI/7, p. 148), so the I is ‘affirmed’ as a predicate of the\nbeing by which it is preceded. In consequence he already begins to\nmove away, albeit inconsistently, from the German Idealist model in\nwhich the intelligibility of being is regarded as a result of its\nhaving an essentially mind-like structure. \nSchelling is led to this view by his understanding of the changing and\nrelative status of theoretical knowledge. It is the inherent\nincompleteness of all finite determinations which reveals the nature\nof the absolute. His description of time makes clear what he means:\n“time is itself nothing but the totality appearing in\nopposition to the particular life of things”, so that the\ntotality “posits or intuits itself, by not positing, not\nintuiting the particular” (SW I/6, p. 220). The particular is\ndetermined in judgements, but the truth of claims about the totality\ncannot be proven because judgements are necessarily conditioned,\nwhereas the totality is not. Given the relative status of the\nparticular there must, though, be a ground which enables us to be\naware of that relativity, and this ground must have a\ndifferent status from the knowable world of finite particulars. At the\nsame time, if the ground were wholly different from the world of\nrelative particulars the problems of dualism would recur. As such the\nabsolute is the finite, but we do not know this in\nthe manner we know the finite. Without the presupposition of\n‘absolute identity’, therefore, the evident relativity of\nparticular knowledge becomes inexplicable, since there would be no\nreason to claim that a revised judgement is predicated of the same\nworld as the preceding — now false — judgement. \nSchelling summarises his theory of identity as follows: \nThe link between the ‘real’ and the ‘ideal’\ncannot be regarded as a causal link. Although there cannot be mental\nevents without physical events, the former cannot be reduced to being\nthe causal results of the latter: “For real and ideal are only\ndifferent views of one and the same substance” (SW I/6, p. 501).\nSchelling wavers at this time between a ‘reflexive’\nposition of the kind which Hegel will soon try to articulate, in\nwhich, in Schelling’s terms, “the sameness of the subjective and\nthe objective is made the same as itself, knows itself, and is the\nsubject and object of itself” (SW I/6, p. 173), in the\n‘identity of identity and difference’, and the sense that\nthis position cannot finally circumscribe the structure of the\nabsolute. The structure of reflection, where each aspect reflects\nitself and then is reflected in the other, upon which this account of\nthe identity of subject and object relies, must be grounded in a being\nwhich carries it: \nWithout this independent basis subject and object would merely be, as\nSchelling thinks they are in Fichte, relative negations of each other,\nleading to a circle “inside which a nothing gains reality by the\nrelation to another nothing” (SW I/4, p. 358). Schelling\nprophetically distinguishes between the cognitive — reflexive\n— ground of finite knowledge and the real — non-reflexive\n— ground that sustains the movement of negation from one finite\ndetermination to another. As a two-sided relationship reflection alone\nalways entails the problem that the subject and the object in a case\nof reflection can only be known to be the same via that which\ncannot appear in the reflection. If I am to recognise myself\nas myself in a mirror, rather than see a random object in the\nworld, I must already be familiar with myself before\nthe reflection, in a way which is not part of the reflection. This\nmeans a complete system based on reflection is impossible, because, in\norder for the system to be grounded, it must presuppose as external to\nitself what it claims is part of itself. Schelling will, in his\nphilosophy from the 1820s onwards, raise versions of this objection\nagainst Hegel’s system. \nSchelling’s own dissatisfaction with his early versions of identity\ntheory derives from his rejection of Spinozism. Spinoza regards the\nmove from God to the world of ‘conditions’ as a logical\nconsequence of the nature of God. Schelling becomes convinced that\nsuch a theory gives no reason why the absolute, the\n‘unconditioned’, should manifest itself in a world of\nnegative ‘conditions’ at all. Schelling is therefore\nconfronted with explaining why there is a transition from the absolute\nto the finite world, a finite world which he comes to see increasingly\nin terms of the suffering and tragedy it has to involve. In\nPhilosophy and Religion, of 1804, he claims, like Jacobi,\nthat there is no way of mediating between conditioned and\nunconditioned, and already makes the distinction between\n‘negative’ and ‘positive’ philosophy, which\nwill form the heart of his late work. Explicating the structure of the\nfinite world leads to “negative philosophy, but much has already\nbeen gained by the fact that the negative, the realm of nothingness,\nhas been separated by a sharp limit from the realm of reality and of\nwhat alone is positive” (SW I/6, p. 43). The question which\ncomes to concern Schelling is how philosophy can come to terms with a\nground which cannot be regarded as the rational explanation of the\nfinite world, because the finite world involves so much that makes no\nrational sense. \nSchelling’s work from his middle period (1809–1827) is usually\nreferred to as the philosophy of the Ages of the World\n(WA = Weltalter), after the title of the unfinished\nwork of that name he worked on in the period 1809–1827. The work\ncharacteristic of this period begins with the 1809 On the Essence\nof Human Freedom (FS = Freiheitsschrift) (written\nin Stuttgart). The WA philosophy is an attempt to explain the\nemergence of an intelligible world at the same time as coming to terms\nwith mind’s inextricable relation to matter. The initial concern is to\navoid Spinoza’s fatalism, which he thinks renders the human freedom to do good\nand evil incomprehensible. Schelling’s crucial objection is\nto the idea that evil should be understood as merely another form of\nnegativity which can be comprehended by insight into the inherent lack\nin all finite parts of a totality, rather than as a positive fact\nrelating to the nature of human freedom. He now sees the fundamental\ncontradictions of the Naturphilosophie in terms of the\nrelationship of the intelligibility of nature and ourselves to a\nground without which there could be no intelligibility, but which is\nnot the explicable cause of intelligibility. In an attempt to get to\ngrips with the problem of the ground of the finite world Schelling\nintroduces a Kant-derived conception of ‘willing’ in the\nFS which will be influential for Schopenhauer’s conception of the\nWill: “In the last and highest instance there is no other being\nbut willing. Willing is primal being, and all the predicates of primal\nbeing only fit willing: groundlessness, eternity, being independent of\ntime, self-affirmation” (SW I/7, p. 350). Schelling now\nestablishes a more conflictual version of the structure of the\nidentity philosophy. The ‘ground’ is\n‘groundless’ — in the sense of\n‘uncaused’ — and it must be understood in terms of\nfreedom if a Spinozist determinism is to be avoided. This means there\ncannot be an explanation of why there is the finite world, because\nthat would entail taking the ground as a cause and thus rendering\nfreedom non-existent. \nAt the same time Schelling insists there must be that against which\nfreedom can be manifest — a being which is not free and is\ntherefore necessitated — for it to be meaningful freedom at all.\nThe theory is based on the antagonisms between opposing forces which\nconstitute the ‘ages of the world’, the past, present, and\nfuture. He argues that the world whose origins the WA wishes to\nunderstand must entail the same conflicting forces which\nstill act, though not necessarily in the same form, in this\nworld, of which the mind is an aspect: “Poured from the source\nof things and the same as the source, the human soul has a\nco-knowledge/con-science (Mitwissenschaft) of creation”\n(WA, p. 4). Schelling suggests that there are two principles in us:\n“an unconscious, dark principle and a conscious\nprinciple”, which must yet in some way be identical. The same\nstructure applies to what Schelling means by ‘God’. At\nthis point his account of the ground is not consistent, but this\ninconsistency points to the essential issue Schelling is trying to\nunderstand, namely whether philosophy can give a rational account of\nthe fact of the manifest world. As that which makes the world\nintelligible, God relates to the ground in such a way that the\n‘real’, which takes the form of material nature, is\n‘in God’ but “is not God seen absolutely, i.e.\ninsofar as He exists; for it is only the ground of His existence, it\nis nature in God; an essence which is inseparable from God,\nbut different from Him” (SW I/7, p. 358). The point is that God\nwould be just be some kind of inarticulable, static One if there were\nnot that which He transcends: without opposition, Schelling argues,\nthere is no life and no sense of development, which are the highest\naspects of reality. The aim of the move away from Spinoza is to avoid\nthe sense of a world complete in itself which would render freedom\nillusory because freedom’s goal would already be determined as the\ngoal of the totality. Schelling starts to confront the idea that the\nrational reconciliation of freedom and necessity that had been sought\nby Kant in the acknowledgement of the necessity of the law, and which\nwas the aim of German Idealism’s attempt to reconcile mind and nature,\nmight be intrinsically unattainable. \nWolfram Hogrebe has claimed that the WA philosophy is an ontological\ntheory of predication. Being, as initially One and enclosed within\nitself, is not manifest, and has no reason to be manifest. Hogrebe\nterms this ‘pronominal being’. The same being\nmust also, given that there is now a manifest world, be\n‘predicative being’, which “flows out, spreads,\ngives itself” (SW I/8, p. 210–211). The contradiction between\nthe two kinds of being is only apparent. Schelling maintains, in line\nwith the identity philosophy, that the “properly understood law\nof contradiction really only says that the same cannot be as the\nsame something and also the opposite thereof, but this does not\nprevent the same, which is A, being able, as an other, to be not\nA” (SW I/8, p. 213–4). One aspect of being, the dark force,\nwhich he sometimes terms ‘gravity’, is contractive, the\nother expansive, which he terms ‘light’. Dynamic processes\nare the result of the interchange between these ultimately identical\nforces. If they were wholly separate there would either be no manifest\nuniverse, because contraction would dominate, or the universe would\ndissipate at infinite speed because expansion would dominate. The\nresult would be the same: there would not be a world. If something is\nto be as something it must both be, in the positive sense in\nwhich everything else is, which makes it indeterminately positive,\npronominal, and it must have a relationship to what it is not, in\norder to be determinate, which brings it into the realm of predication\nby taking it beyond itself. In the WA the One comes into contradiction\nwith itself and the two forces constantly vie with each other.\nDifferences must, however, be grounded in unity, as otherwise they\ncould not be manifest at all as differences. The ground is\nnow increasingly regarded as the source of the transitory nature of\neverything particular, and less and less as the source of tranquil\ninsight into how we can be reconciled to finite existence. The mood of\nthe WA is summed up in Schelling’s reference to the “veil of\nmelancholy which is spread over the whole of nature, the deep\nindestructible melancholy of all life” (SW I/7, p. 399). The\nsource of this melancholy is that everything finite must ‘go to\nground’ and that we are aware of this. Awareness thus both makes sense of things and yet is also what is underpinned by a negativity it must constantly seek to come to terms with. \nThe abandonment of his residual Spinozism leads Schelling to a growing\nconcern with the tensions which result from contradictions that are\nalso embodied in human beings. The ages of the world are constituted\nby the development of forms and structures in the material and the\nmental world. This development depends upon the expanding force’s\ninteraction with the contracting force’s slowing of any expansion,\nwhich allows transient but determinate forms to develop. This process\nalso gives rise to language, which Schelling regards as the model for\nthe development of the whole world because it manifests how expansion\nand the release of tension can lead to intelligibility, rather than\nmere dissipation: \nLanguage as ‘contracted’ material signifier, and\n‘expanding’ ideal meaning repeats the basic structure of\nthe WA, and Schelling insists that, like the material world without\nthe ‘ideal’ capacity for expansion, language can become\n‘congealed’. This interaction between what is contained in\nitself and what draws something beyond itself is also what gives rise\nto consciousness, and thus to an inherent tension within\nconsciousness, which can only be itself by its relation to an other.\nHegel uses a related model of subjectivity, but Schelling will come to\nreject Hegel’s model for its failure to confront the ultimately\nirresolvable tension in all subjectivity. Schelling’s later philosophy\nwill present a subject whose origin prevents it from ever achieving\nthe ‘self-presence’ that Hegel tries to explicate by\nsetting out the complete structure of ‘self-reflection’ in\nthe other. Schelling’s WA philosophy is never completed: its Idealist\naim of systematically unifying subject and object by comprehending the\nreal development of history from the very origins of being founders on\nproblems concerning the relationship between philosophical system and\nhistorical contingency which do not admit of solutions. Furthermore,\nthe structures he develops lead him to ideas which take him beyond\nIdealism and make him one of the crucial precursors of existential and\nother non-Idealist forms of modern philosophy. \nSchelling has often been understood as providing the transitional\n‘objective idealist’ link between Fichte and Hegel. By\nregarding Hegel’s system as the culmination of German Idealism this\ninterpretation fails to do justice to Schelling’s real philosophical\nambitions. Many of these insights, particularly in the later\nphilosophy (1827–1854), directly and indirectly influenced the\nideas of thinkers, like Feuerbach, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger,\nand Adorno, who were critical of Hegel’s claim to articulate a\ncomplete philosophical system. \nThe differences between Hegel and Schelling derive from their\nrespective approaches to understanding the absolute. For Hegel the\nabsolute is the result of the self-cancellation of everything\nfinite, whose mode of being is precisely to change into something\ndifferent. Philosophy can therefore articulate the nature of the\nabsolute by an account of how finite determinations are always\ntranscended. This takes the form of the ‘negation of the\nnegation’, in a system whose end comprehends its beginning. For\nHegel the result becomes known when the beginning negates itself as\nbeing ‘in itself’ to becomes being ‘for\nitself’ at the end of the system, thus in a process in which it\nreflects itself to itself by becoming other to itself. Schelling\nalready becomes publicly critical of Hegel while working on a later\nversion of the WA philosophy in Erlangen in the 1820s, but makes his\ncriticisms fully public in lectures given in Munich in the 1830s, and\nin the 1840s and 1850s as professor in Berlin. The aim of the Idealist\nsystems was for thought to reflect what it is not — being\n— as really itself, even as it appears not to be itself, thereby\navoiding Kant’s dualism. The issue between Schelling and Hegel is\nwhether the grounding of reason by itself is not in fact a sort of\nphilosophical narcissism, in which reason admires its reflection in\nbeing without being able fully to articulate its relationship to that\nreflection. Like Hegel, Schelling argues that it is not the particular\nmanifestation of knowledge which tells me the truth about the world,\nbut rather the necessity of moving from one piece of knowledge to the\nnext. However, a logical reconstruction of the process of knowledge\ncan, for Schelling, only be a reflection of thought by itself. The\nreal process cannot be described in philosophy, because the cognitive\nground of knowledge and the real ground, although they are inseparable\nfrom each other, cannot be shown to reflect each other. \nDieter Henrich characterises Hegel’s conception of the absolute as\nfollows: “The absolute is the finite to the extent to which the\nfinite is nothing at all but negative relation to itself”\n(Henrich 1982, p. 82). Hegel’s system depends upon showing how each\nparticular way of conceiving of the world has an internal\ncontradiction. This necessarily leads thought to more comprehensive\nways of grasping the world, until the point where there can be no more\ncomprehensive way because there is no longer any contradiction to give\nrise to it. The very fact of the finite limitations of empirical\nthought therefore becomes what gives rise to the infinite, which, in\nHegel’s terms, is thought that is bounded by itself and by nothing\nelse. \nSchelling accepts such a conception, to which he substantially\ncontributed in his early philosophy, as the way to construct a\n‘negative’ system of philosophy, because it explains the\nlogic of change, once there is a world to be explained. The conception\ndoes not, though, explain why there is a developing world at all, but\nmerely reconstructs in thought the necessary structure of development\non the basis of necessities in thought. Schelling’s own attempt at\nexplaining the world’s ontological and historical facticity will lead\nhim to a ‘philosophical theology’ which traces the\ndevelopment of mythology and then of Christian revelation in his\nPhilosophy of Mythology and Philosophy of\nRevelation, which, like all his substantial works after 1811, are\nnot published in his lifetime. The failure of his philosophical\ntheology does not, though, necessarily invalidate his philosophical\narguments against Hegel. His alternative to the “common mistake\nof every philosophy that has existed up to now” — the\n“merely logical relationship of God to the world”\n(System der Weltalter, p. 57) — Schelling terms\n‘positive philosophy’. The ‘merely logical\nrelationship’ entails a reflexivity, in which the world\nnecessarily follows from the nature of God, and God and the world are\ntherefore the ‘other of themselves’. Hegel’s system tries\nto obviate the facticity of the world by understanding reason as the\nworld’s immanent self-articulation. Schelling, in contrast, insists\nthat human reason cannot explain its own existence, and\ntherefore cannot encompass itself and its other within a system of\nphilosophy. We cannot, he maintains, make sense of the manifest world\nby beginning with reason, but must instead begin with the contingency\nof being and try to make sense of it with the reason which is only one\naspect of it and which cannot be explained in terms of its being a\nrepresentation of the true nature of being. \nSchelling contends that the identity of thought and being cannot be\narticulated within thought, because thought must\npresuppose that they are identical in a way which thought, as\none side of a relation, cannot comprehend. By redefining the\n‘concept’ in such a way that it is always already both\nsubject and object, Hegel aims to avoid any presuppositions on either\nthe subject or the object side, allowing the system to complete itself\nas the ‘self-determination of the concept’. Schelling\npresents the basic alternative as follows: \nHegel attempts to merge concept and being by making being part of a\nstructure of self-reflection, rather than the basis of the\ninterrelation between subject and object. In Schelling’s terms, Hegel\ntherefore invalidly assumes that ‘essence’, what we know\nof things, which is one side of the relationship between being and\nessence, can articulate its identity with the other side in the\n‘concept’, because the other side is revealed as being\n‘nothing’ until it has entered into a relationship which\nmakes it determinate as a knowable moment of the whole process. For\nHegel, on the other hand, Schelling has to invoke being as something\nimmediate: this means it must be wholly opaque, and so is equivalent\nto nothing. \nThe problem which Hegel does not overcome is that the identity of\nessence and being cannot be known, because, as Schelling\nclaims of his concept of being, “existing is not here the\nconsequence of the concept or of essence, but rather existence is here\nitself the concept and itself the essence” (SW II/3, p. 167).\nThe problem of reflection cannot be overcome in Hegel’s manner:\nidentifying one’s reflection in a mirror as oneself (understood now as\na metaphor for essence) entails, as we saw above, a prior\nnon-reflexive moment if one is to know that the reflection is\noneself, rather than a random reflected object. How far Schelling\nmoves from any reflexive version of identity philosophy is evident in\nthe following from the Introduction to the Philosophy of\nRevelation or Foundation of the Positive Philosophy of\n1842–3: \nSchelling refuses to allow that reason can confirm its status via its\nreflection in being: \nThe contemporary ramifications of the debate between Schelling and\nHegel have been given new significance by the continuing elaboration\nof ‘non-metaphysical’ readings of Hegel by Robert Pippin\nand others. If Hegel is really the philosopher who insists that\nlegitimation can only be in terms of the account we can give of how we\ncame to adopt the forms of legitimation of our society, there being no\nextra-mundane perspective on these forms, how far is he from\nSchelling’s moves against rationalist metaphysics in his later philosophy? The\ndifference between Hegel and Schelling seems here to lie above all in\nSchelling’s insistence that one cannot reduce the ways in which we\nface up to the terrors and irrationality of existence to what can be\nachieved by a philosophical system that makes sense of negativity by showing it has a rational basis. His attention to art and the unconscious in his early philosophy already suggests this direction in his later thinking. \nSchelling is one of the first philosophers seriously to begin the\ncritique of the model of metaphysics based on the idea of true\nrepresentation, a critique which can be seen as one of the key aspects\nof modern philosophy from Heidegger to the later Wittgenstein and\nbeyond. He is, at the same time, unlike some of his successors,\ncommitted to an account of human reason which does not assume that\nreason’s incapacity to ground itself should lead to an abandonment of\nrationality or the reduction to reason to the exercise of power, in the\nmanner of Nietzsche. This is one of the respects in which Schelling\nhas again become part of contemporary philosophical debate, where the\nneed to seek means of legitimation which do not rely on the notion of\na rationality inherent in the world remains a major challenge. Above\nall, Schelling’s account of mind and world, particularly his\ninsistence on the need not to limit our conception of nature to what\ncan be objectified by scientific methods, is, in the light of the\necological crisis, proving to be more durable than his reception might\nuntil recently have suggested. The question Schelling still poses is how the capacity for expanding human knowledge and control of nature can be reconciled with sustainable ways of inhabiting that nature.","contact.mail":"andrewbowie@btinternet.com","contact.domain":"btinternet.com"}]
