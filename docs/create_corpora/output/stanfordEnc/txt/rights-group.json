The “group” in “group\nright” describes the nature of the right-holder; it does not\ndescribe the mere fact that the right is confined to the members of a\ngroup rather than possessed by all members of a society or by humanity\nat large. Much of the controversy that surrounds group rights focuses\non whether groups can hold rights and, if they can, on the conditions\nthat a group must satisfy if it is to be a right-holder. Some\nproponents of group rights conceive right-holding groups as moral\nentities in their own right, so that, as a right-holder, a group has a\nbeing and status analogous to those of an individual person. Others\ngive groups no such independent standing, but conceive group rights as\nrights that are shared in and held jointly by the group's\nmembers. Some opponents of group rights challenge the very proposition\nthat groups can bear rights. Others do not, but worry about the\nthreats that such rights pose for individuals and their rights. They,\nin turn, are met by claims that individual rights and group rights,\nsuitably formulated, are complementary rather than conflicting and\nthat some group rights might even be human rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA group right is a right possessed by a group qua group rather than\nby its members severally. It contrasts with a right held by an\nindividual person as an individual. An example of a commonly\nasserted group right is the right of a nation or a people to be\nself-determining. If there is such a right, it is a right\npossessed and exercised by a nation or a people as a group. It is\nlogically possible that a single individual could have a right that an\nentire people should be self-determining, so that an invader would\nviolate that individual's right rather than a right held by the\npeople themselves; but nowadays it would be difficult to find anyone\nwho would accept the political morality needed to turn that logical\npossibility into a serious claim of right. We might try to\ninterpret a collective right of self-determination as merely an\naggregation of the individual rights of self-determination possessed by those who\nmake up the relevant nation or people. But an individual's\nright of self-determination is normally understood as the right of a\nperson to determine his or her own life rather than a right over the\nlives of others. Thus, the right of a group to determine the\ncharacter and destiny of its collective life cannot be merely a summing\ntogether of individual rights of self-determination. We may\ncertainly appeal to individual rights of self-determination, and to the\nvalues that underlie them, in making the case for a collective right of\nself-determination, but that does not imply that the collective right\nwould be no more than the set of individual rights to which we\nappeal. \n\nOther rights that are now frequently asserted as group rights\ninclude the right of a cultural group that its culture should be\nrespected and perhaps publicly supported; the right of a linguistic\ngroup that its language should be usable and provided for in the public\ndomain; and the right of a religious group that it should be free to\nengage in collective expressions of its faith and that its sacred sites\nand symbols should not be desecrated. In each of these cases, the\nright, insofar as it is a group right, is a right held by the relevant\ngroup qua group, and the duties generated by the right are duties owed\nto the group as a whole rather to its members severally. \n\nGroup rights should not be confused with rights that people possess\nin virtue of being members of groups. People normally possess\nrights as members of universities or sports clubs or businesses or\ntrade unions or churches or states but, in the ordinary run of cases,\nthese are individual rights. For example, the right of a member\nof a university to use its library, or the right of a citizen to vote\nin elections, is the right of an individual person. An\ninfringement of that right would infringe the right of the individual\nright-holder, rather than a group right of the relevant university or\nstate. In fact, most rights held by individuals are associated\nwith group identities or group memberships of some sort. If we\nare willing to extend rights to non-human animals, even human rights\nwill be rights unique to a particular group; yet most human rights are\nconceived as individual rights and, on some views, can only be\nindividual rights. \n\nA group right should not therefore be identified with a\n“group-differentiated” right. That term has been\ncoined by Will Kymlicka (1995) to describe a right that is accorded to\na particular group but not to the larger society within which the group\nexists. For example, a society might accord special rights, such\nas special territorial rights or rights of self-government, to an\nindigenous minority in recognition of the special status that that\nminority should enjoy within the larger society, or out of concern for\nthe vulnerability of the minority's traditional form of\nlife. These would be “group-differentiated\nrights”. That term is now sometimes abbreviated to\n“group right”, which is unfortunate since a\ngroup-differentiated right may or may not be a group right in the\nordinary sense (a right possessed by the group qua group rather than by\nits members severally). For example, if the group-differentiated\nright is the right of a group to be self-governing, it will be a group\nright. But if it is, for example, a right unique to the members\nof an indigenous minority to fish in certain waters and if that right\nis vested in, and is exercisable by, the several individuals who make\nup the minority, it will be a group-differentiated individual\nright. (Kymlicka 1995, 45–48; Jones 2010.) \n\nGroup rights can be legal or moral or both. If a legal system\naccords rights to a group, or recognises it as an entity possessing\nrights, it will simply be the case for that legal system that the group\nhas rights. Those legal rights might then spawn moral\nrights. A law may create a wrong that would not otherwise be a\nwrong but, if the legal system is generally just and if the law serves\na useful purpose, its breach may be considered a moral, as well as a\nlegal, wrong. For example, you may have no right to a particular\ngood in the absence of a law giving you legal title to it but, once you\nhave legal title, my theft of that good can wrong you morally as well\nas legally. Similarly, once a group has been accorded legal\nrights, we might think that, in at least some cases, violations of its\nlegal rights wrong it morally as well as legally. A group may therefore\nbe credited with legally-dependent moral rights. \n\nHowever, if group rights could only ever be creatures of law, we\ncould not protest that a legal system was failing to recognise or to\nrespect a group's right. Proponents of group rights, like\nproponents of individual rights, have been keen to use the language of\nrights in arguing about the form that legal, political and social\narrangements should take. That implies a conception of group\nrights that is moral in foundation and that might be used to determine\nwhat legal rights groups should have. It is as moral rights that\ngroup rights are most controversial. Individual rights are\nsubject to innumerable disputes, but virtually no-one denies that\nindividuals, as persons or in other capacities, are capable of\npossessing rights. By contrast, many people reject the very idea\nthat groups can possess moral rights, and even those who embrace the\nidea of group rights frequently disagree about the sorts of group that\ncan possess them. \n\nNo-one ascribes rights promiscuously to every kind of group, so what\nis it that marks out a group as the kind of group that might bear\nrights? An essential condition for many theorists is the\nintegrity manifested by a group: a group must surmount a threshold of\nunity and identity if it is to be potentially capable of bearing\nrights. \n\nThus Peter French (1984) distinguishes between “aggregate\ncollectivities” and “conglomerate\ncollectivities”. An aggregate collectivity is a mere\ncollection of individuals such as a crowd or the people standing at a\nbus stop or a statistical category such as middle-income earners.\nIf we were to ascribe either moral responsibility or moral rights to an\naggregate, that responsibility and those rights would be reducible,\nwithout remainder, to the responsibilities and rights of the\nindividuals who make it up. A conglomerate collectivity, by\ncontrast, possesses a unified being since it is formally constituted as\nan organisation with an internal structure, rules, offices and\ndecision-procedures. (For a similar, but not identical,\ndistinction between aggregates and organisations, see Copp 1984.)\nExamples of groups that French classifies as conglomerates are the\nDemocratic Party, the US Congress, the US army, the Red Cross,\nuniversity faculties and business corporations.\nOrganizations of this sort possess identities that are not exhausted by\nthe identities of the persons in them; one person's leaving and\nanother's joining does not result in a new organization.\nThus, “what is predicable of a conglomerate is not necessarily\npredicable of all of those or any of those individuals associated with\nit” (1984, 13), including the rights and responsibilities that we\nmight ascribe to the conglomerate. French does not mean to deny\nthat the individuals in a conglomerate, such as a business corporation,\nwill also have rights and responsibilities relating to its activities;\nhe denies only that the rights and responsibilities of the conglomerate\ncan be distributed without remainder amongst those individuals.\nThus, on his view, if the Gulf Oil Corporation buys or sells property,\nor joins a cartel, or is found causally responsible for environmental\npollution and held morally responsible for cleaning it up, the\nCorporation as agent and patient is not reducible to the individuals\nwho are currently associated with it. \n\nIn a similar vein, Dwight Newman (2011, 4) distinguishes\nbetween “sets” and “collectivities”. A set,\nlike French's aggregate, becomes a different set each time its\nmembership changes. It has no identity separate from the individuals\nwho make it up. A collectivity, by contrast, remains identifiable as\nthe same collectivity even though its membership changes. For both\nFrench and Newman, a group's having an identity that survives changes\nin its individual membership is an essential feature of its being the\nkind of group that might bear rights. (See also Graham 2002,\n68–9; Scruton 1989; Van Dyke 1977.) \n\nThe phenomenon of a group's having an identity and existence that is\nseparate from its members is most readily apparent in the case of\nformally organised groups. So, for example, we can think of a football\nclub or a university department or a trade union as remaining the same\nfootball club, university department or trade union, even though the\nindividuals who constitute its members change over time. When you or I\njoin or leave a formally constituted organisation, there is something\nindependent of ourselves that we join or leave. Thus, if we ascribe\nrights to a formally constituted group, the right-bearing group will\nbe something other than the set of individuals who happen to belong to\nit at any moment. \n\nFormal organisation may not be deemed essential to a group's\nhaving an irreducible and enduring identity. People often think\nof nations, for example, as entities that have identities that run\nacross successive generations of nationals. A nation's\nhistoric entitlement to a particular territory would be typically\nthought of as the entitlement of the nation conceived as a single\nenduring entity, rather than a right that has been inherited and\nbequeathed by successive generations of nationals so that,\nhistorically, there has been no continuous entity that has enjoyed\nrights over the territory. People are given to thinking of nations in\nthis unitary and enduring fashion even in cases, such as the Kurds,\nwhere a nation has not been instantiated in a state, or in cases, such\nas the Poles, where it has been deprived of political independence for\nsignificant periods of its history. Whether we conceive a group\nas having an identity and being that supersedes that of its members\nturns not just on what we find in the world, but also on how we choose\nto see it. \n\nFor some proponents of group rights, we should look for the integrity\nthat is essential to a right-bearing group neither in the group's\ninternal organisation nor in its objective characteristics but in its\nsubjectivity. What matters is that the individuals who make up the\ngroup feel themselves strongly bound together as members of a group\nwith which they identify. Thus Marlies Galenkamp holds that a\nright-holding group has to possess a strong form of intra-group\nsolidarity and has to be the kind of group that communitarians\ndescribe as a constitutive community (1993, 81–100, 111–2,\n131; see also Segesvary 1995). Michael McDonald (1991) argues that it\nis the shared understanding amongst individuals that they are\nnormatively bound to each other that makes them a group for moral\npurposes. That shared understanding may be related to and promoted by\nshared objective characteristics, such as a common history, language,\nsystem of belief or social condition, but it is still the subjectivity\nof the group rather than those objective features that is crucial to\nits being a group. Larry May (1987) and Paul Sheehy (2006,\n151–173) also find the source of a group's moral status in the\ninterrelatedness of its members, but argue that the significance of\nthose interrelationships lies in the common interests and needs to\nwhich the relationships give rise.  A group will possess moral status\nas a group when its members are so related that they share needs and\npossess interests as members, such that what benefits or harms any\nmember must benefit or harm all. Others will then have obligations or\nduties in repect of the group as a whole. \n\nWhile those who focus on these features of groups insist that the\ngroup has a moral standing that is not reducible to the moral standing\nof its members taken severally, they cannot allow that a right-bearing\ngroup has a being or identity that is separable from that of its\nmembers. If sharing an intersubjective experience or enjoying certain\nsorts of relationship is crucial to the integrity of a group, the\ngroup must consist of a body of individuals who undergo that\nexperience or who share in those relationships. Unlike French's\nconglomerate or Newman's collectivity, the group cannot be more or\nother than the group as constituted by its members. \n\nA significant measure of unity and identity would seem an essential\ncondition for a group's being the kind of group that might bear\nrights, but that condition would seem necessary rather than\nsufficient. Those who are sceptical of the very idea of group\nrights do not deny that groups come in different forms or that some\nexhibit a high degree of unity or that groups can be very important in\npeople's lives. They simply deny that there is reason to\nascribe to groups, however unified and however significant, the moral\nstanding that they must possess if they are to be independent\nright-holders. So how do proponents of group rights seek to\nprovide that reason? \n\nA favoured tactic is to identify features that groups share with human\nindividuals. If we accept that human individuals possess rights\nbecause they possess certain features, we should accept that groups\nalso possess rights if they too possess those features.  French (1984)\nis a particularly bold proponent of this strategy.  Although formal\norganisation plays a significant part in his account of groups as\nmoral entities, he sees the attribution of moral personality to a\ngroup as quite separate from the question of whether the group enjoys\nlegal personality. For French, to be a moral person is to be a\n“noneliminable subject in an ascription of moral\nresponsibility” (38). That, in turn, requires a capacity for\nintentional action. But, he argues, conglomerate groups, such as\nbusiness corporations, that possess internal decision structures and\nstated policies, are capable of actions that we can properly represent\nas the intentional actions of the group. That is enough to make those\ngroups “fully-fledged moral persons” capable of bearing\nboth moral responsibility and moral rights. Groups that are moral\npersons “will have whatever privileges, rights and duties as\nare, in the normal course of affairs, accorded to all members of the\nmoral community” (32). \n\nA capacity for agency may be deemed essential for right-holding simply\nbecause it is thought to be essential to an entity's having moral\nstanding. Or it may be thought crucial because choice is an essential\nfeature of rights themselves. According to the choice theory of\nrights, to have a right is to have a choice such that it makes sense\nto ascribe rights only to beings that are capable of choice (e.g. Hart\n1982, Steiner 1998). Whatever the reason, making a capacity for agency\na necessary condition of right-holding significantly limits the range\nof groups that might hold rights. Adina Preda (2012) argues that, to\nbe capable of holding rights, a group must be capable of agency,\nalthough it can qualify as an agent for right-holding purposes if it\nis capable of intentional action; it need not possess the\n“full-blown” agency that we might attribute to a natural\nperson. In addition, it must be capable of choice. That, for Preda,\nmeans that rights can be possessed only by groups that are organised\nand that possess collective decision-making procedures. Ethno-cultural\ngroups, for example, that lack organisation and decision-procedures\nwill not bear rights as groups, although their members may have\nindividual rights that are associated with their ethnicity or\nculture. Galenkamp also holds that a capacity for agency is essential\nto a group's being a subject of rights (1993, 62, 71–3,\n101–10) and couples that with using a group distinguished by its\ncommon culture as her prime example of a right-holding group (112,\n138–71). Yet it is hard to see how that sort of group could\nqualify as an agent if it failed to meet the organisational criteria\nset out by Preda. (On group agency in general, see the entry on\n  shared agency, and\n List & Pettit 2011.) \n\nFor other theorists, agency is necessary neither for moral standing\nnor for right-holding. It is enough that we have reason to regard a\ngroup as an object of moral concern; a group does not have to be a\nmoral agent to be a moral patient. Even if a group is capable of moral\nagency, not all of its rights need concern or presuppose its\nagency. Thus Keith Graham points out that we can and do apply a range\nof moral epithets to groups: groups can be treated justly or unjustly,\nthey can be deceived and treated offensively, and they can flourish\nmore or less well (2002, 89–93). Thinking about groups in this\nway implies that they have moral status and that we can reasonably\nascribe rights to them. For May (1987), McDonald (1991) and Sheehy\n(2006) the critical consideration is that a group can have interests\nas a group—interests that are more than the aggregated interests\nof its individual members. That is why a group is capable of being\nharmed and of being treated unjustly as a group. In the case of\ngroups, as in the case of individuals, we may think of those harms and\ninjustices as violations of rights (cf.  Simon 1995, 2001). \n\nFor Newman (2011, Part I) groups that constitute right-bearing\n“collectivities” come in many forms, ranging from\ncorporations, churches and universities, to nations, cultural groups\nand hockey teams.  A collectivity is distinguished by the central\nvalues to which it is committed and by a structure which defines its\nmembership and marks it off from other groups.  Its members are\nessential to its existence, but the collectivity is no mere\naggregation of its members. Rather, it supervenes on its members. It\nsupervenes not only on their existence but also on their relationships\nwith one another and their beliefs about those\nrelationships. Supervenience does not imply reducibility. It does not\nimply, for instance, that the existence of the collectivity, or its\nactions or intentions, can be reduced to those of its individual\nmembers. Newman also argues that a collectivity has moral status as a\ncollectivity, a status that is separate from the moral status of the\nindividuals who are its members. It is therefore capable of bearing\nmoral rights and moral responsibilities that are not merely the rights\nand responsibilities of its individual members. It also has interests,\nwhich are not merely the aggregated interests of its members; rather,\nthey consist in whatever makes the collectivity's life go better as a\ncollectivity. A collectivity's interests generate rights whenever\nthose interests are of sufficient importance to justify the ascription\nof duties to others. In that respect, the rights of a collectivity are\nno different from those of a human individual. \n\nMiodrag Jovanović (2012) provides another interest-based\naccount of group rights but of a rather different sort. Current\ninternational and domestic systems of law acribe rights to groups,\nsuch as rights of self-determination and rights designed to protect\ntheir cultures. Jovanović seeks to explicate those rights by\nuncovering the “normative moral standpoint” implicit in\nthem. That standpoint, which he himself endorses, is, he argues\n“value-collectivism”: “the view that collective\nentities can have inherent value, which is independent of its\ncontribution to the well-being of individual members” (2012,\n6). In other words, we should understand the legal rights attributed\nto a group as grounded in the irreducibly collective value of the\ngroup, a value that is not reducible to the value of the group for the\nseveral individuals who constitute its members. Jovanović does\nnot ascribe those rights to every sort of group recognised in law. In\nparticular, he does not ascribe them to juristic persons, such as\nbusiness corporations and trade unions. Rather, he acribes them only\nto groups that possess a pre-legal existence and identity, such as\nnational, ethnic, linguistic and religious groups. It is the\nirreducibly collective interests of those groups that, on his account,\nlegal group rights (rightly) aim to protect and promote. \n\nThe various approaches to group rights described in the previous\nsection share a common feature. Each supposes that ascribing a\nright to a group entails conceiving the group as moral entity in its\nown right: the group must possess a moral standing that is not\nreducible to the standing of its members. That is why arguments\nabout group rights frequently assume the same character as arguments\nabout the ascription of rights to foetuses or the dead or future\ngenerations or non-human animals. In each of these cases, the\ncentral issue is whether we should allow that the relevant entity has\nthe moral standing necessary for it to bear rights. \n\nIf, for groups, we answer that question affirmatively, we shall\nconceive group rights analogously with individual rights. A group\nright, like an individual right, will be a right held by a single\nunitary entity. The right of a group will be “its”\nright rather than “their” right. Indeed, we might\nthink of a group right as the right of a\n“group-individual”. Groups might bear duties in the\nsame fashion. A group, as a single integral entity, can possess\nduties just as it can possess rights, and those duties may derive from\ngroup rights. For example, each nation's right of\nself-determination is most obviously directed at other nations who, as\nnations, have corresponding duties to respect one another's\nrights. (It remains logically possible, of course, that duties\nstemming from group rights will fall upon individual persons, just as\nit is possible that the rights of individual persons will generate\nduties for groups.) \n\nThis might be described as the “traditional” conception\nof group rights, in that it describes the way in which group rights\nhave been most commonly understood. In recent years, however,\nsome proponents of group rights have conceptualised them quite\ndifferently. They have understood a group right as a right that\nis the shared or jointly held right of a set of individuals. In\nthis conception, a group right is still properly so-called because the\nindividuals who make up the right-holding group possess a right\ntogether that none of them possesses separately. The right is not\na mere aggregation of rights held individually by the members of the\ngroup. But, a group right conceived in this way does not entail\ngiving a moral status to the group qua group that is separate from that\nof its members severally. Rather, the moral standing that\nunderwrites the group right is the moral standing of the several\nindividuals who jointly hold the right. The group right is\ntherefore conceived as “their” right rather than\n“its” right (Jones 1999a). \n\nThe distinction between these two conceptions of group rights has\nfrequently passed unnoticed and there is no agreed vocabulary that\nmarks it. The term corporate will be used here to\ndescribe the traditional conception, since that conception presents a\nright-holding group as a unitary entity. The term\ncollective will be used to describe the conception of a group\nright as a shared or joint right, since it conceives a right-holding\ngroup as a “collection” of individuals, albeit a\ncollection that is bound together in a way that enables them to hold\ntheir right collectively. (Note that, contrary to this usage, many\nproponents of the “corporate” conception of group rights\nuse the term “collective” to describe those rights;\ne.g. Galenkamp 1993, Jovanović 2012, McDonald 1991, Newman\n2011.) \n\nJoseph Raz has provided the most influential statement of the\ncollective conception. According to Raz, if a right is to be a\ncollective right, it must satisfy the following three conditions: \n\nRaz's conception of a collective right is tied to his interest theory\nof rights, according to which X has a right only\nif X is capable of having rights and if, other things being\nequal, “an aspect of\nX's well-being (his interest) is a sufficient reason for holding\nsome other person to be under a duty” (1986, 166). Thus, a\ngroup of individuals has a collective right if their shared interest is\nsufficient to ground a duty in others, and if the interest of any\nsingle member of the group is insufficient by itself to ground that\nduty. When these conditions are satisfied, the group of\nindividuals possess a right together that none of them possesses\nseparately. In fact, Raz argues that the interests that ground a\nright are not necessarily limited to the interests of the right-holder;\nthey can also include interests that others have in the\nright-holder's having the right (1986, 245–63; 1994, 44–59;\n1995). For example, the right of journalists not to disclose\ntheir sources is grounded not only in their own interests but also in\nthe public's interest in their having that right. That\nconsideration can also apply to collective rights. The rights of\na group in respect of its culture, for example, might be grounded not\nonly in the interests of the group's members in their culture but\nalso in the interests of “outsiders” in the continued\nexistence of the group's culture. \n\nSome other theorists whose approach to group rights is consistent with\nwhat is described here as the “collective” conception are\nNathan Brett (1991), Allen Buchanan (1993, 1994), Leslie Green (1991),\nVinit Haksar (1998), Lesley Jacobs (1991) and Seumas Miller\n(2001). (See also Margalit and Raz 1990.) The collective conception\nneed not be tied to an interest theory of rights. Miller, for example,\ngives an account of the collective conception that owes nothing to\nthat theory (2001, 210–33). But the ascendancy of the interest\ntheory of rights in recent years has meant that those who have adopted\nthe collective conception have frequently followed Raz in combining it\nwith the interest theory. (For criticism of the collective theory so\nconceived, see Griffin 2008, 261–265; Preda 2013.)  Moreover,\nthat theory does provide a ready-made account of what it is that\nindividuals share—interests—that makes them a\nright-holding group. The way that interests can accumulate across\nindividuals also helps to explain how it is that a group of\nindividuals can have a right, as a group, that none of them possesses\nsingly.  For Raz, the number of individuals in a group can affect both\nwhether the group has a right and how weighty its right is (1986, 187,\n209). Others are less comfortable with that “aggregative”\nfeature of Raz's conception; yet the relevance of numbers is often\nhard to dismiss. Consider, for example, the claim of a linguistic\nminority that its language should be usable, and provided for, in the\npublic domain. Given the public costs of meeting that claim, it would\nseem implausible to hold that we should take no account of the size of\na linguistic minority (of which there may be several) in deciding\nwhether the claim amounts to a right. \n\nThe fact that, on the collective conception, the individual members\nof a group hold their right jointly does not entail that the right must\nbe grounded in an interest that an individual could have as an\nindependent individual. Some goods take a necessarily collective\nform, so that they cannot be made available to an individual in\nisolation from others; for example, the good constituted by a\ngroup's culture or its communal form of life. Yet it still\nmakes perfectly good sense to hold that a group right to those goods is\nmorally grounded in the interests of the several individuals who make\nup the relevant group and that the right is held jointly by those\nindividuals. Thus, even though the collective conception gives no\nmoral standing to a group independently of its members, it can still\naccount for groups' having rights to goods that are necessarily\nof a non-individual form. \n\nAt the same time, there is nothing in the logic of the collective\nconception that limits the possible objects of group rights to\nnon-individualizable goods. Nor, if we adopt the interest theory,\nneed the right-holding group be a group in virtue of anything other\nthan the shared interest that grounds their right. The second\ncondition that Raz stipulates for a collective right suggests that\nindividuals must be members of a group before they can go on to have\ninterests of a sort that might ground a collective right. Miller,\ntoo, makes membership of a social group a defining condition of a joint\nright's being a collective right (2001, 211). But it is not\nclear why we should hold that a set of individuals can have a\ncollective right only if they are antecedently identifiable as members\nof a group.  \n\nConsider the following example. A city is characterised by\nvery heavy traffic that poses a danger to its pedestrians. The\ncity's pedestrians have an interest in there being a network of\nwalkways so that they can move around the city in safety. Each\npedestrian, as an individual, has an interest in those walkways, but\nthe interest of just one pedestrian is insufficient to create a duty\nfor the city authorities to construct the walkways. However, the\nshared interest of all pedestrians may well suffice to ground that\nduty, in which case pedestrians will have a collective right that the\nauthorities should construct and maintain the walkways. The point\nof this example is not to insist that, in these circumstances,\npedestrians would indeed have that right. Rather it is to show\nthat (a) a group might have a right to a good that is intelligible as a\ngood for an independent individual, and (b) a right-holding group need\nbe a group only in virtue of the shared interest that grounds their\nright. The group need not be institutionalised as a group, nor\nneed it be distinguished by a common ascriptive feature. (In the\nexample given, the fact that the right-sharing individuals are\nidentifiable as “pedestrians” contributes nothing,\nindependently of their interest in being able to walk around the city\nsafely, to their having a collective right.) \n\nThe collective conception can, then, make sense of group rights both\nto goods that would be intelligible as goods for independent\nindividuals and to goods that are intelligible only as goods enjoyed\ncollectively with others. It is often supposed that, if a good\ntakes a necessarily collective form (e.g. the collective good of\npossessing a common culture), the interest in that good can be\nunderstood only as the irreducible interest of a group. That is\nassociated with the supposition that, if the shared interest generates\na group right, the right-holding group must also be understood as an\nirreducible moral entity. Both suppositions are mistaken.\nEven in the case of a shared or collective interest, the interests that\ndo the moral work in generating a right are entirely intelligible as\nthe interests of the several individuals who make up the group and\nwhose good is at stake. Similarly, the moral standing necessary\nfor the individuals, as a group, to have a right to the shared good can\nbe the standing of the several individuals who compose the group.\nThus, vindicating group rights need not entail showing that the\nright-holding group has either interests or a standing that is not\nreducible to those of its members. \n\nAt the same time, there is a limit to the range of cases the\ncollective conception can encompass. As was mentioned earlier,\nthere can be cases in which the interest of a group logically precedes\nthat of its members and in which the members have interests simply\nbecause, qua members, they share in the interest of the group.\nFor example, a football club may have the stated aim of being as\nsuccessful as possible in playing against rival clubs. The club\nwill then have an interest in whatever will promote that aim, including\nfielding the strongest team possible in each game. I, as a member\nof the club, will share in its interests. So, for example, if it\nis in the club's interest to drop me from its team because I am\nnot playing well enough, that will also be in my interest qua\nmember. That interest qua member may conflict with a personal\ninterest that I have in remaining a team player, but arguably that does\nnot disturb my interest qua member. If we understand the interest\nthat grounds a group's right as an interest that the group has\nindependently of its members, and if we understand the members'\ninterests as mere derivatives of that group interest, we must\nunderstand both the interest and the right of the group according to\nthe corporate model. The group right cannot be understood\nadequately as a product of the aggregated interests of the individuals\nwho populate the group (Newman 2011, 57–82). \n\nFor the same reason, the collective conception cannot easily make\nsense of a group right as a right possessed by a group whose identity\nis unaffected by changes in its membership. As Newman points out\n(2011, 59–60), if we conceive a group right as a right held jointly by\nthose who compose the group, each change in the group's\nmembership must entail a change in the identity of the right-holding\ngroup. On the other hand, that may not be an objection.\nGroups, such as cultural, linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, are\noften shifting amorphous entities and we may have to get used to the\nidea that right-holding groups can be groups that have constantly\nchanging compositions. Practically, that may be of little\nconsequence for group rights provided that there is a reasonable\ncontinuity of interest amongst the group's changing members, so\nthat the content of the right does not change with every change in\nmembership. \n\nFinally, note three things about the distinction between corporate and\ncollective rights. First, the limits of the collective conception\nidentified above stem from its unwillingness to conceive a group\nseparately from its members. They do not stem from any inability of\nthe collective conception to make sense of necessarily shared or\ncollective interests—interests that individuals can have only\nalong with others. Secondly, we can most readily conceive a group\nseparately from its members when it is formally constituted as an\ninstitution, as in the case of a football club or a university. But\nonce we separate a group from its members in that way, we run into the\nissue of whether we should really ascribe the right to an institution\nor an organisation rather than to a group (Sheehy 2006, 159–167,\n175–195). Presumably it is for that reason that people do not\nnormally describe the rights of Congress or Parliament or the Supreme\nCourt as “group rights”. Thirdly, it is logically possible\nto interpret some group rights as corporate and others as collective,\nso that we are not obliged to commit ourselves exclusively to just one\nof these conceptions. \n\nThe distinction between corporate and collective rights concerns the\nway in which we might conceive the subject of a group\nright. But the issue of whether there is reason to ascribe rights\nto groups is sometimes approached through their possible\nobjects—through what group rights might be rights\nto. If there are goods that have a necessarily group character\nand if there are rights to those goods, it would seem that those must\nbe group rights. So are there such goods? \n\nThe obvious place to start is with the economist's idea of\npublic goods. We might reasonably suppose with Raz (1986, 208)\nthat a right can be a group right only if it is a right to a good that\nis public to the members of the right-holding group. For the\nrelevant group, the good must be non-excludable (it must be available\nto all members of the group) and non-rival (its consumption by one\nmember of the group must not diminish its possible consumption by other\nmembers). However, as Denise Réaume has pointed out (1988,\n8–9), some goods that are deliverable only as public goods can\nreasonably be considered objects of individual rights. Clean air\nis a standard example of a public good, but we can reasonably hold that\nindividuals have rights to clean air as individuals. An\nindustrialist who seriously pollutes a community's atmosphere\nmight be held to violate the right to breathe unpolluted air of each\nindividual in the affected community rather than a collective or\ncorporate right of the community as a group. \n\nRéaume's own proposal (1988, 1994), which has attracted much\nattention amongst commentators on group rights, is that we should\nunderstand group rights as rights to “participatory\ngoods”. A participatory good is a public good of a particular\ntype. It is a good whose enjoyment by an individual depends upon its\nalso being enjoyed by others. Consider the case of clean air\nagain. Although this is typically a good that is public to a group,\neach individual breathes in and out as an individual and enjoys the\ngood of clean air as an individual. The goodness of clean air for me\ndoes not depend upon its also being good for you, even though it is\ngood for you. Now consider goods such as friendship, a team game, and\na convivial party (Réaume 1988, 12–13; Waldron 1993,\n355–6). Those are necessarily social goods. I cannot enjoy\ngenuine friendship as an entirely individual good; I can play a team\ngame only if others do too; and I can take pleasure in conviviality\nonly as a shared experience. So some goods are necessarily\n“participatory” in nature.  These goods have also been\ndescribed as “communal” (Waldron 1993, 339–69),\n“shared” (Green 1988 207–9; Raz 1995, 35–6),\nand “common” (Marmor 2001). Charles Taylor's notion of\n“irreducibly social goods” has been deployed to similar\neffect: if those goods are the objects of rights, their irreducibly\nsocial character implies that they must be the objects of group rights\n(Taylor 1995, 127–145; Sheehy 2006, 159–167,\n175–195. \n\nParticipatory goods are goods that must be both produced and enjoyed\npublicly, and goods that are simultaneously produced and enjoyed by\nthose who participate in them. While participatory goods combine\nproduction with consumption, it is the necessarily public character of\ntheir enjoyment that really distinguishes them from other public\ngoods. It is because they can be enjoyed only as shared goods\nthat, Réaume argues, only groups can have rights to them.\nHer claim is not that every participatory good must be the object of a\nright; rather it is that, if there is a right to a participatory good,\nthat must be a group right. The relevant right here is neither\nthe liberty-right to participate in the good nor the claim-right to be\nunprevented by others from participating in the good, both of which\nwill normally be individual rights. Rather it is a right to the\nparticipatory good itself (e.g. the right not merely to participate in\nan orchestra but the right that there shall be an orchestra, the right\nnot merely to participate in a culture but the right that the culture\nshall be protected and sustained). \n\nSome goods that can yield rights, and that are, Réaume\nargues, participatory in at least some of their aspects, are living in\na cultured society, sharing a common language, and being a member of a\nreligious community. If groups have rights to these participatory\ngoods, do others have duties to provide them with those goods?\nIf, for example, a group has a right to its culture as a participatory\ngood, that might imply that it is entitled to constrain the freedom of\nits dissident members in ways that ensure the continuance of its\nculture. If a linguistic minority has a right to its language as\na participatory good, that might imply that it is entitled to coerce\nreluctant others to use its language in order to sustain and promote\nthe language as a participatory good. However, those are not the\nsort of rights that Réaume proposes since they would be\nunacceptably onerous for those who bore the duty (1988, 16–17; 1994,\n133–4; see also Marmor 2001). Moreover, some participatory goods\ncan be the goods they are only if people participate in them\nwillingly.  \n\nThe group rights that Réaume suggests might relate to\nparticipatory goods are rights against “outsiders” rather\nthan “insiders”. And they would be rights not to\noutsiders' participation in the good, but to their non-prevention\nof, and their non-interference with, the group's participatory\ngood and perhaps also rights to measures and resources that will\nfacilitate the group's continued enjoyment of its participatory\ngood. A linguistic minority may, for instance, have a right that\nthe majority society should establish, maintain and respect\narrangements that will secure the minority's ability to continue\nusing its language. Similarly, an indigenous minority may have a\nright that the majority society should institute arrangements that will\nprotect its traditional form of life, which form of life is, for the\nminority's members, a participatory good. But these\nexternally directed rights would remain rights grounded in the\ngroup's interest in its participatory good and that, for\nRéaume, means they must be group rights. \n\nThere is an obvious gap in Réaume's attempt to identify\ngroup rights as rights to participatory goods (1994, 123–4). If\nonly groups can have rights to participatory goods, it does not follow\nthat groups can have rights only to participatory goods. They may\nalso have rights to non-participatory goods, such as safe walkways or\ncommunity health safeguards or coastal defences. Even the claim\nthat rights to participatory goods must be group rights has not escaped\nchallenge. James Morauta (2002) argues that, conceptually, a\nparticipatory good could be the object of an individual right. An\nindividual might, for example, have a right to require others to\nparticipate with him in speaking his language and those others may be\nduty-bound to comply if he so insists. That may be a morally\nunappealing state of affairs but there is nothing in the logic of\nrights or participatory goods that rules it out (provided that the very\nnature of the good at issue does not require voluntary\nparticipation). The lacuna that Morauta identifies indicates that\nthe proposition that only groups can have rights to participatory goods\nrelies upon more than just the “structural features” of\nthose goods. It relies also upon a moral assumption about the\nrelative standing of the individuals who have interests in, or who lay\nclaim to, a participatory good. \n\nSuppose, for example, that one person in a nation had, uniquely, a\nright that that nation should be self-determining. His\nfellow-nationals should then be part of a self-determining unit, not\nbecause they are entitled to be, but because he is entitled that they\nshould be. He therefore has a right over their lives that they\nthemselves do not. Normally, we would regard that sort of\ninequality in moral standing as entirely unacceptable; but it is\nbecause we take that moral unacceptability for granted that we are\npredisposed to accept that rights to participatory goods—or, indeed,\nrights to public goods as public goods—must be group\nrights. Of course, people of equal standing can be unequally\ninterested in a good but, in any sizeable group, it is most unlikely\nthat one individual's interest in a good that is public to the\ngroup will be so special and so disproportionate that that individual\nwill have, uniquely, a right to the good as a good for the\ngroup as a whole (Jones 2014, 2016). \n\nCriticism of group rights can take a case-by-case form. The\ncritic might argue that close inspection of particular rights that are\ncommonly claimed as group rights reveals either that they are not\nrights at all or that they dissolve into individual rights (e.g.\nGriffin 2008, 256–276; Lagerspetz 1998). However, much criticism is\ndirected at the very idea of group rights. That criticism is\ngenerally of two sorts: either it is sceptical of the claim that groups\ncan hold rights or it is fearful of the implications or consequences of\nascribing rights to groups. \n\nSceptics often object to the ontology of groups that they take to be\nimplicit in the idea of group rights. To suppose that groups,\nlike individual persons, can hold rights is to suppose that groups can\nhave a being and an integrity that match those of individual\npersons. But groups are collections of individuals and to make\nthem out to be supra-human entities that are somehow more than, or\nother than, the sum of their parts is mistaken: “only individuals\ncan make decisions, can literally have values, literally engage in\nreasoning and deliberation” (Narveson 1991, 334). Those who\nmake and administer the law may have good reason to create and to\noperate with fictions, such as the legal fiction of corporate\npersonality. But moral rights and duties can attach only to real\npersons; “fictitious entities have no rights” (Graff 1994,\n194). Groups do not exist separately from their members and, when\nwe ascribe rights to groups as such, we ignore that simple truth.\n(Narveson 1991, 331–5; Wellman 1995, 157–77; cf Vincent 1989). \n\nDoubts about the integrity of groups are sometimes sociological rather\nthan ontological in nature. Generally, we might suppose that the\ngroups to which we ascribe rights have a unity and identity that is\nindependent of, and that provides the foundation for, our ascription\nof rights to them. A group, such as an ethnic or cultural group, has a\ncertain “natural” existence and we recognise it as having\nrights because of the kind of existent it is. In reality, however,\npre-institutionalised groups are shifting and changing entities and\nlack clear boundaries. In addition, any section of humanity that we\nmight fasten upon as a group is likely to be part of a larger\nsociological entity, and to have within it smaller entities, that\nmight also claim to be “groups”. So there can be a\nsignificant element of arbitrariness about the segments of humanity\nthat we identify as “groups”. We may suppose that, in\nascribing rights to a group, we merely acknowledge the entitlements of\na pre-existing entity, but, in reality, it may be the ascription of\nrights itself that identifies, creates and fixes a segment of humanity\nas a “group”. (Flanagan 1985; Kukathas 1992, 110–15;\nMitnick 2006; Offe 1998, 125–31; Waldron 2002. Cf. Mello 2004;\nSharp 1999.) \n\nGroups may be found improper subjects of rights because they lack\nproperties, other than genuine integrity, that are deemed essential\nfor right-holding. In general, proponents of the interest theory of\nrights have been able to view group rights more generously than those\nwho adhere to the choice theory, although the supposition that groups\ncan have interests has not gone unchallenged (Wall 2003, 273).  Choice\ntheorists will not extend rights to groups that are incapable of\n“exercising” them, such as groups distinguished merely by\nan ascriptive identity. They can extend rights to organised groups\nthat possess decision-procedures (Preda 2012; Sumner 1987,\n209–211), but some argue that even those groups are not capable\nof the kind of agency required for right-holding (Wellman 1995,\n157–65; Wall 2000, 2003, 270–6; cf. Nickel 1997). Again,\nif sentience is a necessary condition of right-holding, that may\ndisqualify groups as right-holders: “groups are composed of\nsentient individuals, but they do not themselves feel anything”\n(Rainbolt 2006, 208. See also Kymlicka 1989, 241–2; Ellis 2005,\n206–7. For a contrary view, see Graham 2002, 89–104). \n\nA related objection focuses upon groups as entities of value.  When we\nascribe rights to groups as such, we may seem to ascribe value to\ngroups as such. Against that, many people hold that only individual\nhuman beings can be of ultimate value—a position that has been\ndescribed as “value-individualism” (Hartney 1991; Ellis\n2005; Kukathas 1992, 112; Narveson 1991, 329, 335–45).\nValue-individualism stands in opposition to\n“value-collectivism”, which ascribes inherent value to\ngroups and to which, as we have seen, Jovanović\nsubscribes. Value-individualists do not deny that groups and\ncommunities are a fact of social life, nor do they deny that groups\nand communities can matter very much to people and play a crucial role\nin their well-being.  But they do insist that, ultimately, groups have\nvalue only in so far as they are of value for individual human\nbeings. Groups, unlike individual persons, cannot have intrinsic\nvalue, even though some of their activities may be intrinsic\ngoods. Hence, they cannot hold rights that presuppose their intrinsic\nvalue; at best, they may have rights that are of instrumental value to\nindividual human beings. \n\nFor the most part, scepticism about group rights presupposes a\ncorporate conception of those rights. It challenges claims that\ngroups can have a being, status or value that is not reducible to that\nof their members. But, since the collective conception makes none\nof those claims, it is largely untouched by that scepticism. It\nis not, however, exempt from other sorts of objection to group\nrights. \n\nWorries about the moral implications or consequences of ascribing\nrights to groups, relate not only to whether we should accept that\ngroups have rights but also to how ready we should be to vest rights in\ngroups. The common thread running through these worries is the\nthreat that group rights may pose to individuals and their\nrights. Sometimes the concern is for those inside, and sometimes\nfor those outside, the right-holding group. \n\nOne concern is that, if we give moral standing to groups as such, we\nshall lose sight of individuals within the group (Vincent 1989,\n714). If a group can have standing as a group independently of\nits individual members, those individuals will have no standing on any\nmatter on which the relevant standing lies with the group. On\nthose matters, the separate wills of individuals cannot count.\nThey will not be overridden; they will simply pass unrecognised.\nThus, group rights may seem to be starkly at odds with the\n“separateness of persons”. \n\nAnother fear concerns the power that group rights may enable a group\nto wield over its members (e.g. Macdonald 1989; Offe 1998, 131–5;\nWaldron 1993, 363–6). When we concede that a group has rights,\nthose may be rights that it holds against its own members and that it\ncan use to regiment their lives. Thus, once again, the rights\nheld and wielded by a group may be rights exercised at the expense of\nthose who fall within it. In one respect, that seems an\nunnecessarily invidious way of representing the relationship between\ngroups and their members. There is nothing unusual about a\ngroup's organising itself so that it can make decisions\ncollectively, either directly or through appointees, that bind its\nmembers severally. That describes the normal state of affairs for\ntennis clubs, anglers' associations, political parties, churches\nand any number of quite unremarkable groups. The right of a group\ncollectively to make decisions that bind its members severally is a\nsimple description of democracy. \n\nSo why has there been so much angst about allowing that groups can\nhave rights over their members? The answer is that, in recent\nyears, group rights have been discussed primarily in relation to groups\nthat have an involuntary membership: groups that are distinguished by\ntheir race, ethnicity, culture, or language. People do not choose\nto be members of these “ascriptive” groups, nor can they\neasily leave them as they might leave a club or association. If\nthey find the group's authority oppressive or its way of life\nintolerable, they cannot simply opt out, since their membership of the\ngroup is treated by others—insiders or outsiders or both—as a\nnatural “given” to which normal rights of entry and exit do\nnot apply. That is why Will Kymlicka, for example, a liberal\ndeeply sympathetic to the claims of cultural groups and indigenous\npeoples, is reluctant to allow that the rights of groups can be\ndirected inwardly as restrictions upon the group's own members,\nrather than outwardly as protections against the external world\n(Kymlicka 1995, 34-48; cf. Marmor 2001). \n\nConcerns about the potential for oppression implicit in group rights\noften have an empirical dimension. Demands for group rights are often\nlooked upon most favourably when they are made by indigenous peoples,\ncultural minorities and religious groups whose way of life is\nthreatened by external influences. But frequently, it is alleged, the\nreal effect of conceding rights to these sorts of group is to\nreinforce the power of conservative elites whose wishes and interests\nclash with those of others in the group. Typically, an elite will want\nto use its power to maintain the traditions and integrity of the group\nand will be unwilling to tolerate dissent, deviance and demands for\nreform. It will also seek to maintain the position of those within the\ngroup who have traditionally been subordinate. This issue is often\ndescribed as the problem of “minorities within minorities”\n(Eisenberg and Spinner-Halev 2005; Green 1994), but it can also be a\nproblem of majorities (e.g. women) within minorities. In short, while\naccording rights to a group may enhance the position of some of its\nmembers, it may seriously diminish the freedom and well-being of\nothers (Cohen et al. 1999; Deveaux 2000; Dick 2011; Kukathas 1992,\n113-15; Okin 2002; Shachar 2001; Tamir 1999, 158-64, 173-4). We should\nalso bear in mind, however, that withholding power from a sub-state\ngroup for that reason involves the assumption that the group's members\nwill be better served by the state's authority than by the authority\nof their group, an assumption that some would question (e.g. Holder\n2012). \n\nA closely related fear concerns the potential of group rights to rival\nand override the rights of individuals (e.g. Buchanan 1994; Caste\n1992; Graff 1994; Isaac 1992; Macdonald 1989, 126–7; Tamir 1999,\n161; Tesón 1998, 132–137). One of the strongest\nmotivations for ascribing rights to individual persons is to provide\nthem with safeguards.  Individuals as individuals are vulnerable to\nthose who wield power in all of its many forms and to the might of\nnumbers. Individuals who hold unpopular views or who live unorthodox\nforms of life or whose existence proves tiresome or objectionable to\nothers, are in constant danger of being crushed by the many who view\nthem negatively.  When we give rights to individuals, we provide them\nwith moral shields that protect them from the excesses of power,\nincluding the excesses of collective power. But, if we ascribe rights\nto groups as well as to individuals, we might find that the rights of\nindividuals are met and overtaken by those of groups, so that rights\nlose their potency as safeguards for individuals. We might fear that,\nwhen the rights of a mighty group conflict with those of a mere\nindividual, it is Goliath rather than David who will more frequently\nemerge as the victor. \n\nGroup rights conceived collectively may seem less threatening to\nindividuals than group rights conceived corporately. On the\ncorporate conception a group has a moral standing independently of its\nmembers; the standing of the group can therefore displace that of its\nindividual members so that their separate wills or interests or voices\nas individuals count for nothing. By contrast a collective right\nis held jointly by the individuals who make up the collectivity and is\ngrounded in the standing and interests of those individuals.\nThus, on the collective conception, there can be no question of\nindividuals disappearing morally into a group in which they cease to\nhave any independent status. But fear of collective rights may\nstill be provoked by the way in which they derive from an aggregation\nof individual interests. As we have already seen, on Raz's\nconception of collective rights, numbers count. Numbers affect\nboth whether groups have rights and how weighty their rights are (1986,\n187, 209). Others are loath to accept that rights can derive\nfrom, or be affected by, that sort of aggregation (Réaume 1988,\n2003; Tamir 1999, 166–71). In contemporary philosophy,\nrights-thinking is commonly opposed to maximizing consequentialism, of\nwhich utilitarianism is the prime example. Ascribing rights to\nindividuals is a way of acknowledging their separateness as persons and\nof safeguarding them from the aggregative excesses of\nutilitarianism. But if the aggregation of interests can yield\ncollective rights, a morality of rights may begin to assume the\ncharacter of, and to present the same dangers as, the very sort of\nutilitarian thinking that many rights-theorists intend it to\npreclude. \n\nA number of things might be said in response to these worries.\nFirst, very much depends upon the content that we give group rights. It\nis possible to invest individual rights with a content that would make\nthem unsavoury, but that would not discredit the very idea of\nindividual rights; similarly, the possibility that we might find some\ngroup rights objectionable is no reason to dismiss group rights\naltogether. Secondly, it would seem strangely arbitrary, given\nthe moral significance that we give to rights, to insist that the\nobjects of rights can be only goods that individuals can enjoy as\nindependent individuals and never goods they can enjoy only in\nassociation with others. Some theorists of rights seem to think\njust that. But we cannot take for granted that no good, whose\nshared nature was such that it could be the possible object only of a\ngroup right, could ever have the significance that would justify its\nactually being the object of a right. \n\nThirdly, there is no reason why individual rights and group rights\nshould not both figure in our moral thinking. Indeed, they commonly\ndo. For example, it would be entirely commonplace to hold that a\npeople, as a political unit, has a collective right to be\nself-determining but only within the limits set by individuals' human\nrights. Group rights do not have to clash with individual rights and a\ncomplete moral theory would articulate individual rights and group\nrights so that they formed a coherent set (cf. Buchanan 1994; De\nFeyter and Pavlakos 2008; Holder and Corntassel 2002). It may prove\nimpossible to anticipate and avoid every conflict amongst rights, but,\neven if it does, we need not suppose that conflicts will arise more\ncommonly between group rights and individual rights than amongst\nindividual rights themselves (McDonald 1998; Waldron 1993,\n203-24). \n\nThere is also a well-established tradition of political thought,\nassociated particularly with Alexis de Tocqueville and the English\nPluralists, which sees the existence of groups as essential to the\ndispersion of power and maintenance of liberty within a society.\nAccording to that tradition, groups do not glower threateningly at\nindividuals. Rather, the rights of groups help to counter and\nhold in check a potentially overmighty state. (Stapleton 1995;\nLustgarten 1983. See also Frohnen 2005 and Gedicks 1989.) \n\nGroup rights and individual rights can, then, co-exist more or less\npeacefully, but it is also possible for them to enjoy a more positive\nand mutually supportive relationship. Raz has pointed out that\nindividual rights frequently presuppose the existence of general social\ngoods and that individual rights themselves frequently promote social\ngoods (1986, 193–216, 245–263; 1995). Indeed, individual rights\nmay sometimes be rights only because they promote social goods.\nRaz does not claim that those social goods are generally the objects of\ngroup rights, but he does expose the error of supposing that an\nantagonism towards collective considerations is somehow built into the\nvery idea or purpose of individual rights. The interests that\ngroup rights and individual rights seek to protect will frequently be\nthe same interests. \n\nIndeed, it may sometimes be an individual right that makes the case\nfor a group right. We might argue, for example, that some of the\ngoods to which individuals have rights depend for their realisation\nupon the health of the communities and cultures to which those\nindividuals belong, so that there is a case for individuals sharing in\ngroup rights because those rights serve their individual rights or\ntheir individual freedom (Jacobs 1991; Kymlicka 1989, 1995; Wellman\n1999). Or we might argue that individuals have equal rights to\nthe conditions of self-development, that individual self-development\nrequires common or joint activity, and that that makes the case for\ngroup rights to the conditions necessary for that common or joint\nactivity (Gould 2001). Or, again, we might hold that amongst the\nrange of options required for individual autonomy are joint options,\noptions to pursue ends that require co-ordinated activity with other\nmembers of one's group; that too may justify group rights, such\nas the right of a group to control its own affairs (Wall 2007).\nThe claim here might be either that a group right is conducive to, or,\nmore strongly, that it is essential for, the realisation of an\nindividual right. \n\nDwight Newman also argues that some individual rights presuppose group\nrights (2011, 76-82), but his general analysis of the proper\nrelationship between individual and group rights is both nuanced and\nqualified (2011, Part II). As we have seen, he conceives right-holding\ngroups as possessing moral status as groups and as having rights that\nare grounded in their interests as groups, interests that are not\nreducible to the interests of their members taken individually. Even\nso, he insists that group rights must be consistent with the\n“humanistic principle”, which holds that ultimately what\nmatters is the well-being of individual human persons. In that\nrespect, he is a value-individualist rather than a value-collectivist.\nGroup rights (or “collective” rights as he prefers to call\nthem) cannot ultimately be in competition with the well-being of the\ngroup's members. He formulates that requirement as “the service\nprinciple”: if the claims that a group makes upon its members\nare to be legitimate, those claims must serve the interests of the\ngroup's members. He pairs that principle with a “mutuality\nprinciple”, which provides that a right-holding group cannot act\nwith no regard for the well-being of outsiders, be they individuals or\nother groups. The service principle does not translate into the\nfamiliar claim that individual rights must always take priority over\ncollective rights. People have interests both as individuals and as\nmembers of groups and sometimes their interests as members can matter\nmore than their interests as individuals. In addition, legitimate\ngroup claims need not in every instance serve the interests of each\nand every member of the group; rather, their overall effect should be\nto promote the well-being of each member. If a tension arises between\ngroup rights and individual rights, which should take precedence will\nvary according to circumstances and cases, dependening upon what is\nmorally preferable given the all-in interests of those whose\nwell-being is at stake. Newman therefore cautions us against supposing\nthat the need for group rights to comply with the humanistic principle\nmust always entail their taking second place to individual rights. \n\nIn seeking to reconcile group rights and individual rights, can we go\nstill further and incorporate group rights within human rights? The\npreambles to the UN's Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (1966)\nand on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) characterise the\nrights set out in each Covenant as human rights. The first articles of\nboth Covenants ascribe to all “peoples” the right of\nself-determination, the right freely to dispose of their natural\nwealth and resources, and the right not to be deprived of their means\nof subsistence. Rights of peoples would seem to be group rights and\nyet they also figure in the UN Covenants as human rights. In addition,\nas human rights have been given an increasingly inclusive content, an\nidea of a “third generation” of human rights has\nemerged. Political and civil rights constituted the first generation\nand socio-economic rights the second; both sorts of right focused on\nindividuals as their bearers. Third generation or\n“solidarity” human rights include rights to goods such as\ndevelopment, peace, a healthy environment, communication, humanitarian\nassistance, and a share in the common heritage of mankind. They are\nrights to goods that are collective in nature and rights that are\noften more intelligibly borne by groups than by\nindividuals. Collective rights are also prominent in the rights\nattributed to indigenous peoples (sometimes described as a\n“fourth generation” of human rights). A large proportion\nof the rights set out in the UN's Declaration of the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples, 2007, are collective rights. They include the\nright of indigenous peoples to self-determination (art.3) and other\nrights stemming from that general right, such as the right to\n“maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal,\neconomic, social and cultural institutions” (art.5), the right\nthat their culture shall not be destroyed (art.8), the right not to be\nforcibly removed from their lands and territories (art.10), and the\nright to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs\n(art.11). In UN parlance, the Declaration is a “human rights\ninstrument” and commentators commonly conceive the rights it\nenunciates as human rights (see, e.g., Allen and Xanthaki 2011). \n\nIn spite of these developments, the idea that human rights can be\ncollective in form remains controversial.  For many, human rights are\nnecessarily the rights of human individuals so that, even if groups\nhave rights, those will not be human rights (e.g. Donnelly 2003,\n23–27; Graff 1994; Griffin 2008, 256–276; Jovanović\n2012, 166–195; Miller 2002; Nickel 2007, 163–167;\nNordenfelt 1987; Raz 2010; Waldron 1993, 339–69). Others insist\nthat some of the goods that are fundamental to human life and to human\nwell-being can be enjoyed only collectively and that our conception of\nhuman rights should accommodate that reality (e.g. Beitz 2009,\n181–186; Casals 2006; Crawford 1988; Felice 1996; Freeman 1995;\nHolder 2006; Jones 2013; Kymlicka 2001, 69–90; Malik 1996; Mello\n2004; Thompson 2015). \n\nThis debate encompasses a number of distinct if related\nissues. One is whether the practical effect of extending human\nrights to groups will be to corrode the protection that human rights\nafford individuals, in ways already indicated. Another is whether\nthe idea of rights has itself become over-extended. Goods such as\na world peace, a healthy environment, and efficient communications, may\nbe better understood as ideals or policy objectives for the human race\nrather than objects of human rights. Moreover, some third\ngeneration human rights seem to be conceived as the group rights of all\nhumanity as a single entity, which makes puzzling who bears the\ncorresponding duties. A further issue concerns what it is that\nmakes a right “human”. If it is enough for a right to\nbe a human right that the relevant international authority declares it\nto be so, there is no obstacle to group rights being human\nrights. But, if we conceive human rights as rights that\nhuman beings hold in virtue of being human and that are universal to,\nidentical for, and possessed equally by, human beings, that sets\na more discriminating test for the group rights that might qualify as\nhuman rights. \n\nIf we return to the distinction between corporate and collective\nrights, group rights have a greater affinity with human rights if we\nconceive them according to the collective model. On the corporate\nconception, a group right is a right held by a corporate entity, which\nimmediately makes it other than a human right since its holder is that\ncorporate entity. On the collective conception, a right is held\njointly by a set of individuals. To qualify as a human right, a\ncollective right would have to be universal to human beings but, if we\nsuppose that politically every human individual belongs to a people\nand has an interest in that people's being self-determining, we might\nhold that all human beings enjoy a right to collective\nself-determination. All have that right, but each will hold it only\njointly with other members of his or her people (Jones 1999b,\n2016). However, the group rights that can satisfy this test of\nuniversality will be limited in number. Assertions of group rights are\noften stimulated by “difference” rather than\nuniformity—by features, ways of life or commitments that\nsignificantly differentiate one group from another rather than by\ncharacteristics that all human beings share (e.g. Addis 1992;\nGalenkamp 1993; Ingram 2000; Jovanović 2012, 188–195;\nYoung 1990). Of course, it may be that group rights that provide for\ngroup differences, such as differences in culture, will themselves\nderive from more basic rights that are universal in scope—just\nas rights to practise different faiths can derive from a universal\nright of freedom of religion. Uniform rights need not make for uniform\nlives. But it is unnecessary to contrive a fit between group rights\nand human rights where one is not comfortable. Because the language of\nhuman rights has become the lingua franca of international standard\nsetting, there has been an unfortunate tendency to present every\nsignificant international standard in that language. Many\nindividually-held rights are not human rights but are still rights and\nstill matter. Similarly, groups can have rights and their rights can\nmatter, even if those rights are not human rights.","contact.mail":"peter.jones@ncl.ac.uk","contact.domain":"ncl.ac.uk"}]
