So they have\nbenefited from a rich trove of ideas and theories on which to draw in\ndeveloping their own distinctive philosophical perspectives. As a\nresult Japanese philosophers have always been acutely attuned to the\nintimate relations among culture, ways of thinking, and philosophical\nworld views. An island chain twice as distant from its continental\nneighbors as Britain is to its own, Japan escaped successful foreign\ninvasion until 1945. Accordingly, it largely negotiated its own\ncultural, including philosophical, development without an alien power\nforcibly imposing on the archipelago its own religious world view or\nphilosophical theories. The early twentieth-century academic\nphilosophers in Japan, for example, were so well educated in the\nworld’s texts and theories, many in the original languages, that\nthey were among the most internationally informed philosophers of\ntheir time.\n\n\nWithout foreign ideas being coerced on them, Japanese thinkers had the\nluxury of alternatives outside the binary of simple wholehearted\nacceptance or utter rejection. New theories from abroad could be tried\nand, if need be, experimentally modified before making a final\ndecision about endorsement. Sometimes a foreign philosophy might be\nseen as supplying raw material to be fashioned to serve ongoing native\nphilosophical enterprises. In other cases a new philosophy might be\nimported whole cloth to either supplement or supplant a home system of\nthought. Because of those circumstances, Japanese philosophers\nacquired skill in analyzing foreign ideas by examining the cultural\nassumptions behind them to determine their potential implications if\nthey were to be adopted into their own culture.\n\n\nAgainst that backdrop, this article explains Japanese philosophy in\nfive sections. Section 1 considers how Japanese have traditionally\nunderstood philosophy to be a Way (michi) of engaging reality\nrather than a detached method for studying it. The next section lists\nsome patterns of analysis that are hallmarks of that Way of Japanese\nphilosophizing. Section 3 identifies five distinguishable traditions\nhaving had a major impact on Japanese philosophy, explaining a few\ncentral ideas from each. Section 4 surveys how those five traditions\nhave evolved and interacted over four major periods of Japanese\nhistory from ancient times to the present. Section 5 concludes with a\nfew themes given special emphasis in Japanese philosophy that might be\nprovocative to philosophy at large.\n\nMost Japanese philosophers have assumed the relation between knower\nand known is an interactive conjunction between the two rather than a\nbridge spanning the disjunction between what is in the knower’s\nmind and the known which stands outside it. The Japanese philosopher\nis thus more likely to be viewed as a person who tries to fathom\nreality by working within it rather than one who tries to understand\nit by standing apart from it. In other words, the Japanese\nphilosopher’s project more often involves personal engagement\nthan impersonal detachment. The difference in emphasis between\ntraditional Japanese philosophy and modern Western philosophy became\nclear to the Japanese when the latter was first introduced into their\ncountry in full force in the mid-nineteenth century. A crucial issue\nfor the intellectual leadership of the time was how to identify in\nJapanese what the Westerners called philosophy. Wanting to\nassimilate Western philosophy along with other aspects of Western\nculture, the architects of Japanese modernization wanted to give the\nfield its own Japanese name, rather than treating it as a foreign term\npronounced phonetically. \nTo capture the philosophical sense of wisdom\n(-sophy), they picked a likely candidate from the classical\nEast Asian tradition, namely, tetsu. More provocative,\nthough, was their choice for the other part of the neologism, namely,\ngaku. That word also had a classical pedigree: it signified\nlearning, especially in the sense of modeling oneself after a\ntextual or human model (that is, a master text or a personal master).\nProbably more significantly, though, the term gaku at the\ntime was prominent in neologisms for disciplines in the newly\nestablished Western-style universities, functioning as an equivalent\nfor the German Wissenschaft. Hence, it rendered the\n-ology suffix of fields like biology or geology as well as\nthe humanistic “sciences” (Wissenschaften) like\nhistory or literary studies. By this protocol of nomenclature, the\nWestern discipline of philosophy came to be called in Japan\nby the compound word tetsugaku and academic philosophers were\n(and still are) called tetsugakusha, that is, “ones who\npartake in the Wissenschaft of wisdom.” \nThe salient point is that the label chosen was not a more traditional\nterm like tetsujin, “wise people.” A word like\ntetsujin might have more closely approximated the original\nGreek meaning of the philosopher as a “lover of wisdom”\nthan does tetsugakusha, which suggests something more like a\n“scholar of wisdomology.” As a result, we might say\ntetsujin better refers to the premodern Japanese sense of the\nphilosopher, that is, a sage who has mastery in one of the traditional\nWays (dō or michi) such as the Way of\nthe buddhas, the Way of the Confucian scholarly sages, the Way of the\n(Shintō) kami, or even one of the Ways of the\ntraditional arts such as calligraphy, tea ceremony, pottery, painting,\nflower arranging, or any of the various martial arts. (Traditional\nJapan used a variety of terms for the sagely master; for convenience\nin this article tetsujin will appear throughout.) \nIn effect, by creating the new term tetsugakusha instead of\ndrawing on an already existing term from their own tradition, the\nJapanese were drawing a distinction between two species of\nunderstanding and two forms of philosophizing. One species of knowers\naspires to a scholarly (“scientific”) detachment that\nmutes personal affect with the aim of reflecting external affairs as\nthey exist independently of human ideation. That kind of understanding\nis the goal of the Wissenschaften—the empirical\nsciences, literary criticism, studies of history, and social\nsciences—that define most departments in the academy alongside\nphilosophy. \nThe other species of understanding characterizes those who personally\nengage reality, transforming themselves and reality together into a\ncoherent and harmonious whole. That more traditional Japanese sense of\nunderstanding transcends mere skill or know-how, it should be noted.\nTo be a Confucian sage or a master calligrapher is not simply to be\nproficient in technique (any more than being a logician in the West is\nsimply knowing how to construct a syllogism). Although rigorously\ndisciplined in their early training, the members of the engaged\nknowing family of philosophers eventually go beyond fixed templates\nand regimens to respond creatively to what-is. When engaged\nunderstanding prevails, the knower and known collaborate in an act of\ninnovation rather than simple discovery. From the Japanese standpoint,\nin their praxis as philosophers, the tetsugakusha are akin to\nhow geologists understand clay whereas the tetsujin are akin\nto how master potters understand clay. The geologist acquires\nscientific knowledge (geology) to forge an external relation between\nthe knower and the clay, each of which preexists the knowledge and\nbasically remains unchanged by the knowledge (a Wissenschaft\nis typically grounded in the descriptive). By contrast, the knowledge\nof the potter is expressed in, by, and with the clay as an interactive\nproject (the masterwork of pottery). Both the clay and the\n“bodymind” of the potter are transformed in the act of\nengaged wisdom. For the tetsugakusha, philosophy bridges the\nphilosopher’s connection with reality; for the\ntetsujin, on the other hand, philosophy is the Way the\nphilosopher and reality are purposively engaged with each other and\ntransform each other. For the tetsugakusha philosophy is a\nlink the self creates to connect with the world; for the\ntetsujin philosophy is a product created out of the mutual\nengagement between self and world. The distinction parallels what\nHenri Bergson characterized in the opening pages of Introduction\nto Metaphysics as two ways of knowing: “moving\naround” an object as contrasted with “entering it”\n(Bergson 1955, 21). \nWhen Japanese thinkers assume two items are related (whether the items\nbe physical entities, ideas, persons, social structures, etc.), they\ncommonly begin by examining how the items internally overlap (how they\ninterrelate) rather than by looking for something additional\n(a third item whether it be another thing, idea, force, or whatever)\nthat externally connects or bonds them. The simple\ndiagrams below indicate the chief difference. \nFigure 1: External Relation \nFigure 2: Internal Relation \nFigure 1 shows a and b as discrete entities in an\nexternal relation represented by the extrinsic linking agency of\nR. Figure 2, by contrast, shows a and b as\ninternally related entities such that R denotes what they\nshare, what intrinsically conjoins them. In the case of the external\nrelation, if the relation dissolves (or is omitted from the analysis),\na and b each retains its own integrity without loss.\nOnly the context of their connection disappears. In the case of an\ninternal relation, on the other hand, if the relation dissolves (or is\nomitted from the analysis), a loses part of itself, as does\nb. For instance, as a legal arrangement, marriage is an\nexternal, contractual relation into which two individuals enter.\nShould that arrangement end, each of the pair returns to his or her\noriginally discrete individuality and attendant rights. As a loving\narrangement, however, marriage is an internal relation in which two\npeople share part of themselves and should the love connection\ndissolve, each person loses part of what one had formerly been, the\npart that had been invested in the other. As Emily Dickinson (1884)\nwrote after losing a beloved friend, she became a\n“crescent” of her former self. (See the entry on\n relations\n for further discussion of the external/internal distinction.) \nWhen Japanese philosophers emphasize engaged over detached knowing,\ntheir treatment of standard philosophical themes assumes distinctive\nnuances. One example will illustrate. Because of its roots in praxis,\nJapanese philosophy approaches mind-body issues differently from how\nthey have typically been addressed in the West, especially the modern\nWest. As the postwar philosopher, Yuasa Yasuo (1925–2005)\nanalyzes in detail (Yuasa 1987), the preference in modern Western\nphilosophy has been to think about the mind and body as discrete (that\nis, as external to each other) and the issue then becomes\nwhat connects the two. If no third external connection can be\nfound, the only obvious alternative is to eliminate the dualism by\nreducing one of the polarities to the other, for example, by making\nthe mind an epiphenomenon of the body. Yuasa found such formulations\nof the mind-body problem alien to the Japanese philosophical\ntradition, both ancient and modern. \nJapanese philosophers have customarily taken the view that the body\nand mind may be distinguished, but they have assumed from the outset\nthat their relation is internal rather than external. That is, the\nmind and body cannot be completely separated without violating their\nessential character or function. If we envision body and mind as a\nsingle complex of two intersecting circles (call it bodymind\nto capture the sense of the Japanese compound term shinjin),\nthen without the somatic conjunction, the mind is not fully the mind\nand without the mental conjunction, the body is not fully the body.\nAccordingly, Yuasa argues, Japanese philosophers have throughout\nhistory typically searched not for what constant connects the\ndiscrete mind and discrete body, but instead, how the\nbodymind functions such that the interrelationship between the somatic\nand mental aspects may increase. That is, the focus has been\nhow disciplined study and praxis enables the two circles to\noverlap increasingly in the direction of unity. \nThat approach implies that the bodymind relationship is a changing\ninternal relationship rather than a fixed external one. In learning to\nplay the piano, for example, Yuasa says the novice has “the mind\nlead the body” to memorize the keys, but as the pianist becomes\nproficient, “the body leads the mind” so that it seems the\n“fingers know where the keys are” without the intrusion of\nconscious thinking, leaving the mind to concentrate more fully on the\nmusic itself. As the two circles more fully merge, the bodymind\nbecomes capable of holistic function. That unification enables further\ncreativity and insight—the point when the music, the mind, and\nthe fingers touching the keyboard become a single act. That pathway to\nincreasing bodymind unity explains how praxis and discipline are\nprerequisite to free expression. Yuasa explains how this integrative\nbodymind phenomenon is treated in various Western as well as Eastern\ntheories including neurology, the psychology of conditioned response,\npsychosomatic medicine, depth psychology, phenomenologies of the body,\nIndian Ayurvedic medicine, kundalini yogic praxis, Japanese theories\nof artistry, and East Asian models of ki (qi in\nChinese) within medicine and the martial arts. \nYuasa concludes that philosophy would be well served by leaving the\nrarefied pure and distinct abstractions of Cartesian metaphysics and\nits theory of the substantially discrete body and mind. By focusing\ninstead on the dynamics of bodymind as a single fluid system, the\ndualism inherent in the classic Western mind-body problem would\ndissolve into an engaged study of the Way of bodymind: its\ncultivation, transformation, and its links to praxis, performance,\nholistic health, and creative expression. Yuasa’s philosophy\nexemplifies how contemporary Japanese thinkers may constructively\nengage Western thought while drawing on strands of their own premodern\ntraditions. As we have seen, his analysis shows how a relation (in\nthis case that between mind and body) that is commonly assumed to be\nexternal in modern Western philosophy is understood quite differently\nwhen it is assumed to be internal. This difference is typical not only\nof Yuasa, but also more generally of Japanese philosophizing at\nlarge. \nConsider also how highlighting internal relations would affect ethical\nproblems involving self and other (whether the “other” is\nanother person, a group, a thing, the natural world, etc.). Most\nJapanese philosophers tend to pose the fundamental question not in\nterms of what principles or calculus of consequential considerations\ndefine the ideal relation spanning the two. Instead their analyses\nmore commonly begin from a consideration of what the self and other\nintrinsically share such that there is an original relationship at\nall: What is the common ground giving rise to the relationship? That\nis, ethics is not about making relations but about discovering\ninterrelations. \nSimilarly, in aesthetics the general modus operandi for the Japanese\nphilosopher is not to explain art as establishing extrinsic contexts\nor criteria that connect artist, medium, creative intention, audience,\nand the work of art (whether the work be poetry, painting, or a\ndramatic or musical performance). Instead the Japanese philosopher\ndelves immediately into the in medias res of the work of art\nas the presentation of a single interresponsive field (often called\nkokoro) out of which that whole cluster of aesthetic\ncomponents takes form. (See the entry on\n Japanese Aesthetics.) \nTo take one final example, in his ethico-political philosophy, Watsuji\nTetsurō (1889–1960) explicitly rejected as a starting point\nthe social contract theory of the modern West (Watsuji 1996). As a way\nof theorizing the meaning and purpose of the state, a social contract\nis conceived as an external relation made by discrete, independent\nindividuals. Watsuji’s critique was that even a thought\nexperiment should begin with an understanding of human existence based\nin fact. Human being originates not as an individual, but as a fetus\ninterdependent with its mother and once born, the baby is fully\ndependent on its mother. Only subsequently does it develop\nindividuality and independence, but even then it is in transition to\nbecoming a socialized human being. To understand ethics and politics,\nWatsuji argues, even a thought experiment must recognize the inherent\nrelations intrinsic to, and constitutive of, human being in that\nongoing process, what he called a dialectic of interpersonal\nbetweenness or being in the “midst of the interpersonal”\n(hito to hito no aidagara) that precedes the polarization\ninto either individual or collective. (See the entry on\n Watsuji Tetsurō.) \nModels of reality built on external relations often resemble a mosaic\nin which individual entities are like tiles whose meaning in relation\nto the whole can only be determined by applying an extrinsic blueprint\nor template representing the external relations linking them. Each\nindividual tile in itself gives little or no information about how it\nrelates to other tiles. By contrast, models of reality built on\ninternal relations are typically more like jigsaw puzzles in which we\ndiscover the relation of one piece to another by looking more closely\nat the information already within each individual piece: its\nprotuberances, indentations, and coloration. Each piece has within it\nthe information about how it links with its adjacent pieces. In some\ninstances the configuration within the internal relation is even more\nrevealing such that each piece has information not only about adjacent\npieces, but also about all the other pieces in the whole.\nThat paradigm can be called holographic in the etymological\nsense that the whole (holo-) is considered to be inscribed\n(-graph) in each of its parts. That is, the whole is not\nsimply made of its parts, but also, each part contains the pattern or\nconfiguration of the whole of which it is a part. Such holographic\nrelations between whole and part are common in Japanese philosophical\nsystems. \nIn the West the holographic paradigm permeated animistic cultures\ntracing back to prehistoric times and persisted in the later magical\narts wherein a fingernail or hair could give a wizard or witch power\nover the whole person from which the part was pilfered. It continued\nin the cult of relics throughout the Middle Ages. But the\nEnlightenment’s rationalism stripped the holographic paradigm of\nits ontological connections, restricting it to being no more than a\nfigure of speech (such as a metonym) or other form of conventionalized\nsymbol. In general the Western intellectual tradition limited\nholographic thinking to the literary (e.g., William Blake’s\nuniverse in a grain of sand) and the psychological (e.g.,\nFreud’s symbolic dream analysis), rather than the\nphilosophical. \nMore recently, however, in a scientific world increasingly attracted\nto frames of recursiveness, fractals, the multiple expressions of stem\ncells, and so forth, the holographic paradigm has once again begun to\nhave ontological and not just figurative relevance in the West. To a\nforensic scientist, for example, a drop of blood or a single hair from\na crime scene, is not only part of a person’s anatomy, but is\nalso an item inscribed with the dna pattern of\nthe person’s entire anatomy. The relevant contrast is that in\nthe history of Japanese thought the holographical paradigm of the\nwhole-inscribed-in-each-of-its-parts never went out of philosophical\nfashion as having potentially ontological significance. It was never\ndemoted to the status of being only a primitive, magical, or\nmetaphorical way of engaging the world. Indeed, holographic relations\noften figure prominently in many Japanese philosophical theories. \nTwo Western misinterpretations of the political theory behind\nJapan’s imperial polity illustrate the point. In the nineteenth\nand early twentieth centuries, when Westerners first encountered the\nJapanese ideology of the emperor, they noted the emperor was referred\nto as kami, a term translated as “god” when it\nrefers to a celestial deity. The (mistaken) inference was that the\nJapanese believed the emperor, like Yahweh or Zeus, was deemed to be a\ntranscendent being in an external relation to the state and the people\nin it. That interpretation missed the internal relation between the\nemperor and the Japanese people that establishes their logical\ninseparability such that neither could maintain its full identity\nwithout the other. Thus, in the logic of the kamikaze pilot,\ndying for the emperor was not a simple act of sacrificing one’s\nself to a higher being or even a higher value. Instead, to die for the\nemperor could not be completely separated from dying for oneself and\ndying for all other Japanese. To deny that connection would reduce the\npilot to a crescent of his full identity, that is, for him to die for\nthe emperor was an act of self-fulfillment rather than\nself-sacrifice. \nThe second misunderstanding of the political theory behind the\nimperial system arose later in the twentieth century with Western\nintellectual historians influenced by Hayden White's theory of\nhistorical discourse and its analysis of tropes (White 1973). One\nclaim was that in the nineteenth century Japanese Native Studies\n(Kokugaku) had developed a new form of historical narrative centering\non the trope of kokutai. The emperor is the body,\nessence, or formation (tai) of the\ncountry, nation, and its people\n(koku). Thus the term kokutai applies to both the\nemperor and to Japan. The new ideological narrative, the critics\nclaimed, deceptively used a metonym (the emperor as a part of the\nstate used to symbolize the state) to claim the emperor is\nthe state (Harootunian 1978). Despite its virtues on other counts\n(see the entry on \n philosophy of history, section 3.4),\nmetahistorical criticism ill fits the Japanese situation inasmuch as\nit overlooks the long-standing Japanese emphasis on internal and\nholographic relations. That is, the internal relation between emperor\nand Japan establishes a holographic relation such that each person\ncontains the configuration of the whole Japanese nation. From the\nstandpoint of the traditional Japanese kokutai theory, to\nclaim the emperor is really only a symbol or metonym for Japan is a\ncategory mistake comparable to saying the dna\nfound in the blood at the crime scene is only a symbol or metonym for\nthe perpetrator. The philosophical claim (leaving aside here the truth\nvalue of that claim) is that the relations among the emperor, the\nJapanese people, and the state are comparable to the relations among\nthe dna, the blood, and the person from the\ncrime scene. It is simply a false premise (and certainly not one\nassumed in the history of Japanese thought) that there is no possible\nsense in which the whole can be contained in one of its parts and that\nany such claim must be no more than a trope. \nAnother area where ignorance of Japanese holographic thinking has led\nto Western misinterpretation is in the so-called aesthetic of\nminimalism. Once we are attuned to the holographic paradigm it becomes\nclear that Japanese minimalism is not about eliminating the extraneous\nor omitting the unnecessary, but rather (as in the case of the\nforensic scientist) about focusing on the particular as revealing the\nwhole from which it was taken. If we recall that the Japanese work of\nart is the creative presentation of the kokoro (the total\ninteractive field that generates the artist, medium, and audience as a\nsingle event) then what is normally considered in the West to be the\nwork of art is that precise point in the kokoro through which\nwe can experience the configuration of the whole of the\nkokoro. Japanese minimalism does not exclude or eliminate; by\nfocusing on the particular it enables us to attend to the whole\naesthetic event that produces it and of which it is a part. To the\ndiscerning reader, the haiku with its meager seventeen\nsyllables omits nothing; rather, it is holographic of the whole. \nOne response to encountering an opposing philosophical position or\ntheory, a response common in the Western tradition from the time of\nthe ancient Sophists, is to reaffirm one’s own position by\nrefuting the other, revealing its inconsistencies or weaknesses. (This\nadversarial form of argumentation, including its rarefied form known\nas the reductio ad absurdum, is common in Indian philosophy\nas well and was introduced to Japan via Buddhism more than a\nmillennium prior to any Western influence.) In Japan, however, a more\ncommon response to philosophical opposition has been to reaffirm\none’s original view by assimilating into it what is central in\nthe opposing viewpoint through a process of allocation, relegation, or\nhybridization. Very often in Japanese philosophical debates, the\ncontenders compete in trying to absorb rather than refute the\nopposition. Cultural comparatists have noted that the Western game of\nchess is won by attacking the opponent’s pieces and capturing\nthe king whereas the Japanese game of go is won by encircling\nthe opponent’s stones until all are captured and none remain. To\nthe surprise of the uninitiated Western philosophical reader,\ntherefore, the skilled use of agreement and concession, rather than\ndirect attack, may sometimes be the sharpest tools in the Japanese\nphilosopher’s argumentative arsenal. It is important, therefore,\nto notice how allocation, relegation, and hybridization can help a\nphilosophical theory gain dominance in the Japanese milieu. \nAllocation is the most compromising form of philosophical\nassimilation. Two opposing views are accepted without major alteration\nbut conflict is avoided by restricting each to its own clearly defined\ndisjunctive domain. A détente is negotiated such that each\nphilosophy can function without opposition within its own discrete set\nof philosophical problems as long as it refrains from universal claims\nthat its methods, assumptions, and conclusions apply to every possible\nkind of philosophical enterprise. For example, at times Japanese\nConfucian, Buddhist, and Shintō philosophies resolved potential\nconflicts by allocating social and political issues to Confucianism,\npsychological and epistemological theories to Buddhism, and\nnaturalistic emotivism to Shintō. The Seventeen-article\nConstitution of Prince Shōtoku in the early seventh century is\nsuch an instance, using Confucian principles to define the political\nvirtues and responsibilities of courtly retainers, the emperor, and\nthe people, but following Buddhist models in discussing human nature\nand the cultivation of the introspective discipline necessary to\ncontrol egoistic desires and unbridled emotions. Shōtoku’s\ndocument used allocation, in effect, to envision a harmonious world of\nConfucian social and ethical decorum inhabited by people trained in\nBuddhist psychospiritual introspection and discipline. \nRelegation assimilates an opposing view by conceding its truth even\nwhile subordinating that truth to being only a partial component of\nthe original, now more inclusive, position. Usually the rhetoric is\nthat the apparently opposing view is not really something new at all,\nbut has always been part of the original theory, albeit perhaps not\npreviously emphasized as such. As in allocation, the position of the\nother is fully accepted but in this case only as an incomplete part of\nthe whole picture which, it is demonstrated, the original theory has\ncontained all along (or at least could ex post facto be\ninterpreted so). Of course, the rhetoric aside, a close analysis often\nreveals that the original theory actually expands its\ncomprehensiveness to incorporate the competing one, but the end result\nis the same: the rival ideas are assimilated by being relegated to a\nsubordinated place within the whole, thereby losing their force as an\nindependent theory that can oppose the winning position. For example,\nJapanese esoteric Buddhism assimilated proto-Shintō ideas,\nvalues, and practices by relegating its kami to being\n“surface manifestations” of Buddhist reality. By that\nprocess, Shintō cosmology and rituals could be assimilated\nwithout change within the esoteric Buddhist system but only insofar as\nthey were subordinated by means of a “deep” Buddhist\nmetaphysical interpretation relegating their former proto-Shintō\nmeanings to the superficial level of understanding. \nHybridization is a third form of assimilation that leaves neither the\noriginal theory nor its opposing rival theory intact. Instead, through\ntheir cross-pollination something completely new is born. A hybrid\npresents us with a new species of philosophy and although we can do a\ngenealogy of its parentage, it cannot (unlike the cases of allocation\nor relegation) ever return to its earlier opposing forms. If we\nconsider a biological hybrid like a boysenberry, which has a genetic\nparentage traceable to a loganberry and a raspberry, we cannot find\nthe loganberry or the raspberry intact in the boysenberry. Once the\nhybrid is created, we cannot undo the crossbreeding; there are now\nthree distinct species of berries. Analogously, in the process of\nphilosophical assimilation, when true philosophical hybrids emerge,\nhistorians of philosophy may be able to uncover their genealogies, but\nthe theories themselves can no longer be deconstructed back into their\nparental origins. As will be explained below, in Japan\nbushidō, the Way of the warrior, is such a philosophical\nhybrid born of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintō, but which\nbecame an independent philosophy of its own that in many ways served\nas a rival to its antecedents. \nNext let us examine how Japanese philosophers use those forms of\nanalysis in developing five originally distinct sources of\nphilosophical ideas. \nThree major philosophical sources have fed into Japanese thought since\nancient times up through the present, two additional ones being added\nin modern times (that is, post-1868). First has been Shintō. In\nits archaic form, especially before its contact with the literary\nphilosophical heritage of continental Asia, it is better termed\nproto-Shintō because it only loosely resembles what we\nnow know as Shintō. Institutional Shintō thought did not\nsignificantly begin until the medieval period and today’s\nShintō philosophy mostly originates in the Native Studies\ntradition beginning in the eighteenth century. That trajectory of\nShintō doctrinal development continued with the rise of\nnationalism and ethnocentrism under the rubric of Shrine Shintō,\nthe institutional arm of State Shintō ideology, which cast a pall\non creative philosophical thinking from the early twentieth century\nuntil 1945. Postwar Japan has witnessed a range of renewed Shintō\nphilosophies, some in the direction of a return to right-wing\nideology, others toward a more liberalized version inspired by Western\nmodels of liberal Christian theology and comparative religious\nscholarship. \nProto-Shintō Animism and Naturalism \n Proto-Shintō lacked philosophical reflection and even\nself-conscious articulation but is so named because today’s\nShintō has often claimed (sometimes disingenuously) a resonance\nwith its main values, ritual forms, and world view. Dating back to\npreliterate times, proto-Shintō was more an amalgam of beliefs\nand practices lending cohesion to early Japanese communities. As such\nit largely resembled religions in ancient animistic and shamanistic\ncultures found elsewhere in the world. Specifically, the material and\nspiritual were internally related so as to form a continuous field\nwherein the human and the natural, both animate and inanimate, were in\nan interactional, even communicative relation. Kami (often\ntoo restrictively translated into English as “gods”)\nmanifested the power (tama) to inspire awe and could refer to\nanything ranging from a celestial deity to a ghost to a possessed\nhuman being to a spirit within a natural object to a wondrous natural\nobject itself (such as Mt Fuji) to even a special manufactured object\nsuch as a sword. Although human interactions with kami might\nbe either beneficial or harmful, there was no duality or conflict\nbetween good and evil forces. Even within human affairs wrongdoing was\ngenerally a violation or transgression of a taboo, regardless of\nwhether the acts were accidental or intentional. Since criminality or\nsin was not a major consideration, the proper response was not so much\nguilt, repentance, or rehabilitation, but instead ritual purification.\nSpiritual and political leadership shared a common charisma allowing\nthe political leader to serve sacerdotal roles in rituals that brought\nthe community benefits and warded off danger. The rituals, often\nshamanistic in character, mediated the fluid boundaries between the\nheavens, this world, and the underworld as well as the realms of the\nanimate, inanimate, human, and natural. \nAlthough, as far as we know, there was no self-reflective\nphilosophizing per se in the preliterate world of proto-Shintō,\nphilosophical ideas introduced from abroad often took root most deeply\nwhen they drew support from some of its basic ideas and values. For\nexample, proto-Shintō animism generally assumed we live in a\nworld of internal relations where various forces and things can be\ndistinguished, but in the end, they are never discrete but inherently\ninterrelated in some way. Indeed because of that reciprocity, one\nmight say the world is not simply what we engage, but also something\nthat engages us. As we define it, it also defines us. Nothing is ever\nsimply material without somehow also having some spirituality; nothing\nis ever simply spiritual without somehow also having some materiality.\nThe ancient proto-Shintō creation myths recount how many parts of\nthe physical world came into being through involuntary divine\nparthenogenesis. For example, the sun and the moon—both the\nphysical objects and the celestial kami associated with\neach—came into being as the effluent of Izanagi\nkami’s eyes when he purified himself in a river after\nbeing polluted by a journey to the realm of the dead. This type of\ngenesis narrative also supports an understanding that every part of\nthe physical world holographically reflects the pattern of spiritual\ncreativity on a cosmic level. \nFor proto-Shintō the intersection of the\ndualities—humanity/nature, spirit/matter, good/bad, alive/dead,\nabove/below­, natural/cosmic—is almost always a preexistent\nintrinsic relation that is not made but discovered, not fixed but\nevolving, not given but nurtured. In the final analysis, reality is\nnot a world of discrete things connected to each other, but more a\nfield of which we are part (a field often expressed by the indigenous\nword kokoro). This form of relation applies to the\nword-reality relation as well. From what we know of proto-Shintō\nritual forms, it seems incantations played a central role in\npurification rites. In those incantations the sounds of the words\nwere, as in magical cultures elsewhere in the world, thought to have\nspecial efficacy beyond the simple semantic meaning. Koto was\na term for both word and thing suggesting that words\nhad the spiritual power (tama) to evoke, and not simply refer\nto, a preexisting reality. Thus, the term kotodama (koto\n+ tama) suggested an onto-phonetic resonance reflecting internal\nrelations among language, sound, and reality. \nAlthough many such characteristics of proto-Shintō are found in\nother archaic animistic cultures throughout the world, unlike many of\nthose other locations, in Japan those ancient sensitivities were not\nsuppressed by the imposition of rationalistic philosophies from\noutside. For example, the expansion of Christianity with its\nGreco-Roman philosophical analyses drove underground many older\nanimistic cultures (such as the Druids in the British Isles). When the\nmajor philosophical traditions from continental Asia entered Japan, by\ncontrast, they did not take an oppositional stance toward the world\nview already in place within the archipelago. Therefore, much of\nproto-Shintō’s organicism, vitalism, and the sensitivity to\nthe field of inter-responsive, internal, and holographic relations\ncould survive within the mainstream of Japanese thinking. \nThe impulse to philosophize in an organized fashion came to Japan in\nwaves from continental Asia: China, Korea, and indirectly India.\nPreviously illiterate, in the fifth century or so the Japanese started\ndeveloping a writing system, using at first the Chinese language for\nits base. Because Japanese and Chinese are linguistically unrelated\nand differ both syntactically and phonetically, it took centuries for\na Japanese writing system to evolve out of the Chinese sinographs, in\nthe meantime making Chinese the de facto written language. As\nsuch, Chinese philosophical works served as textbooks for\nJapan’s study centers, eventually transforming the culture\nbeyond the parameters envisioned by the proto-Shintō world view\nand forms of life. \nOf the three classical “Ways” of traditional Chinese\nphilosophy, namely, Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, only the\nlatter two achieved independent prominence in Japan. Daoism\ncontributed to the proto-Shintō base a more sophisticated\nunderstanding of the processes of natural change and a conceptual\nvocabulary for creative, responsive engagement with reality through\nagenda-less activity (what the Chinese Daoists called wuwei).\nFor the most part, however, its influence was most obvious in the\nalchemical arts, prognostication, and as a resource for occasional\nliterary references. Admittedly, in the medieval period some Daoist\nphilosophical references appear in the language of the arts,\nespecially in theories of creativity, but they occur mainly within a\nZen Buddhist context. That is likely because before coming to Japan,\nChinese Zen (Chan) had already assimilated many Daoist ideas. In\ncontrast with Daoism, however, Confucianism and Buddhism maintained a\npresence throughout Japanese history as independent philosophical\ncurrents of philosophy. Of the two, we consider Confucianism first.\n(See also the entry on \n Japanese Confucian Philosophy.)\n \nAs the second fountainhead of Japanese philosophy, Confucianism\nentered the country as a literary tradition from China and Korea\nbeginning around the sixth and seventh centuries. By then it already\nenjoyed a sophisticated continental philosophical heritage well over a\nmillennium old. Confucian philosophy in Japan underwent only minor\nchanges until its second wave in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\nafter which it experienced major transformations as it became\nJapan’s dominant philosophical movement until the radical\nchanges brought by the modern period. With the Meiji Restoration of\n1868, that is, with the overthrow of the shogunate and the return of\nimperial rule, Confucianism receded somewhat in its philosophical\ndominance, yielding to the rise of Western academic philosophy, State\nShintō ideology, and the secularized version of\nbushidō (Way of the warrior) as promulgated in the\neducational program of National Morality. That is not to say, however,\nthat Confucianism did not continue to remain influential in its\nemphasis on scholarship, the definition of hierarchical social roles,\nand general models of virtue. \nThe Confucian Social and Moral Order \nFrom the time of their introduction into Japan, Confucian political,\nsocial, and ethical ideals quickly transformed the structure of\nJapanese society. From the seventh century, texts traditionally\nassociated with Confucianism served as the core curriculum in the\nimperial academy for the education of courtiers and bureaucratic\nofficials. Politically, Confucian ideology gave a sophisticated\njustification for an imperial state. Like proto-Shintō, it\nrecognized the charisma of the political ruler as both a chief ritual\npriest and mediator with the celestial realm as well as the pinnacle\nof political authority. But Confucianism added to the Japanese context\na rich description of political and social roles that organized the\nsociety into a harmonious network of interdependent offices and\ngroups. Confucianism defined a place for each person and a set of\nshifting roles and contexts to be performed with ritual decorum. \nSo the proto-Shintō taboo structure was enhanced with a Confucian\nset of socially appropriate behaviors. Once again, it was not a matter\nof moral mandates about good vs. evil, however, but a description of\nrole-based behaviors describing rightness as contrasted with\ninappropriateness or impropriety. Those dimensions of Confucianism\ncould be assimilated into the proto-Shintō world view as useful\nelaborations and improvements, especially ones that would enable the\ngrowth of a Japanese state that expanded beyond family and regional\nclan regimes to become a central imperial state spanning the\narchipelago. Furthermore, as it became aware of the high cultural\nachievements of its Korean and Chinese neighbors, Japan could use\nConfucianism to participate in the East Asian cultural sphere defined\nby China and the prestige accompanying that membership. \nOne striking exception to the adoption of the standard Confucian\npolitical philosophy was that the Japanese ignored the principle of\nthe mandate of heaven (tianming in Chinese) that was central\nto the Chinese Confucian ideology of the state. In China the authority\nof the emperor flowed from a celestial entitlement or command, a\nmandate that could be withdrawn if the emperor no longer acted in\naccord with the Way (dao) or cosmic pattern\n(tianli). By contrast, following their proto-Shintō\nsensitivities, the Japanese understood imperial authority to derive\nprimarily from the field that included the internal relations among\nheaven and earth or the deities and the people, with the\nemperor’s being considered a direct descendant of the celestial\nsun kami, Amaterasu. Indeed, proto-Shintō considered the\nrelation between the celestial kami, the emperor, and the\npeople to be familial and in no way either contractual or\ntranscendent. Like a blood connection, all Japanese and the\nkami were, through the emperor, internally related with each\nother such that the connections among them could not be nullified. \nNot having a philosophical tradition of its own, proto-Shintō did\nnot so much argue against or refute the Chinese idea of the mandate of\nheaven; it simply ignored it, however fundamental it was to Confucian\npolitical theory. It is significant that no major Confucian thinker,\nnot even in the most ascendant period of Confucian philosophy under\nthe Tokugawa shogunate, vigorously argued that the mandate of heaven\nshould supersede the Shintō justification for imperial rule based\nin the function of the emperor as holographically reflecting the\nontological, inherent connection among the kami, the Japanese\npeople, and the physical land of Japan. \nFor the most part, Confucianism brought to proto-Shintō a new set\nof detailed ideas about how to organize a harmonious hierarchical\nsociety in which roles of respect directed to those above were\nreciprocated by roles of caring directed to those below. The analysis\nwas that society can be construed as constructed out of five binary\nrelations: ruler-subject, parent-child, husband-wife, senior-junior,\nand friend-friend. If those five relations are lived with ritualized\npropriety and an attention to being appropriate to the roles they name\n(a praxis called in Japanese seimei “trueing up the\nterms” or “the rectification of names”), harmony\nwill prevail not only in those relations but in the whole society\nconstructed out of those relations. An implication of the Confucian\nview of role-based ideals is that the sharp separation between the\ndescriptive and the prescriptive collapses. There is theoretically no\ngap between knowing what a parent (or a ruler, or a husband …)\nis and the role that person should perform. Thus,\nConfucianism can be understood as a type of ethico-political\nutopianism, but it is emphatically insistent that it is based neither\nin speculation nor rationalistic theory, but in historical paradigm.\nThe prototype is found in the harmonious society depicted in the\nancient Chinese classics: the histories, the odes, and the rites that\ninspired Confucius’s insights. It follows that the Way to become\nethically and politically accomplished is to study the classics and to\nmodel oneself after the ancient paradigms of the roles exemplified by\nthe sages of the past. \nThe third major fountainhead feeding into Japanese philosophy from\nancient to contemporary times has been Buddhism. With origins in India\ngoing back to the fifth century bce, Buddhist\nphilosophy like Confucianism entered Japan via Korea and China in the\nsixth and seventh centuries. In contrast with Confucianism, however,\nby the end of the eighth century Buddhism emerged as the major focus\nof Japanese creative philosophical development as imported Chinese\nBuddhist schools of thought were modified and new Japanese schools\ndeveloped. Buddhism continued its intellectual dominance until the\nseventeenth century, then making way for the second wave of Confucian\nideas that better suited the newly risen urbanized, secular society\nunder the control of the Tokugawa shoguns. With notable exceptions, in\nthe seventeenth through nineteenth centuries Buddhist intellectuals\nretreated from philosophical innovation to focus on institutional\ndevelopment, textual studies, and sectarian histories. When Western\nphilosophy surged into modern Japan and its newly established secular\nuniversities, some influential Japanese philosophers saw Buddhist\nideas as the best premodern resource for synthesis with Western\nthought. In some cases that entailed reformulating traditional\nBuddhist ideas in light of Western philosophical categories. In other\ncases, philosophers used allocation, relegation, or hybridization to\ncreate new systems that tried to assimilate Western ideas while\nmaintaining aspects of traditional Japanese values. That said, in the\nmodern era under the ideology of State Shintō, Buddhism as both a\nreligion and a philosophy often suffered persecution and it was not\nuntil 1945 that it was once again completely free to develop its\ntheories openly without government surveillance and censorship. \nBuddhism and the Self-World Interrelation \nBuddhism, with a millennium of philosophical roots going back to India\nand further cultivated in China and Korea, brought to\nProto-Shintō’s vague intuitions and inchoate belief systems\nsophisticated analyses, multiple theoretical formulations and\ncounterarguments represented by a multitude of different schools of\nthought, and a rich new vocabulary redolent with allusions to ideas\nand terms from Sanskrit, Pali, and Chinese. There were, however, a few\nnearly universally accepted Buddhist themes that resonated well with\nthe Japanese preliterate context and have continued to influence major\nlines of Japanese thinking throughout its history \nFirst is the Buddhist claim that reality consists of a flow of\ninterdependent, conditioned events rather than independent,\nsubstantially existent things. Nothing exists in and of itself and\nthere is no unchanging reality behind the world of flux. The\nBuddha’s view was formulated originally in opposition to an\nincreasingly orthodox emphasis in Indian philosophy at the time\n(roughly the 5thc. bce)\nthat favored the idea of a permanent reality (Sanskrit:\nbrahman) or Self (ātman) behind a world of\napparent change. Thus, more than a millennium later Buddhism came to\nJapan with fully developed, sophisticated analyses supporting a world\nview that was essentially consistent with proto-Shintō’s\nunreflective emphasis on internal relations, fluid boundaries, and a\nfield of shifting events rather than fixed things. Moreover, within\nthe variety of Buddhist schools introduced into Japan by the eighth\ncentury, there were further resources that could philosophically\njustify and elaborate what had been rather inchoate assumptions of\npre-Buddhist Japan. For example, the Japanese Kegon (Chinese: Huayan)\nschool had a rich philosophy of interdependence based in holographic\nrelations, which had probably been more a magical modality than\nphilosophical idea in the proto-Shintō consciousness. Kegon gave\nit a philosophical articulation and justification. \nA second Buddhist premise is that reality presents itself without\nillusion in its so-called as-ness or thusness (nyoze;\nSanskrit: tathatā). That premise contrasts with a\nwidespread orthodox Indian view (found in the Upaniśads\nand later Vedas, for example) that reality continuously hides\nits true nature through illusion (Sanskrit: māyā).\nStill, according to Buddhism, despite the lack of ontological\nillusions, we ordinarily almost never access reality as it is because\nwe project on it psychological delusions fueled by habituated\nstimulus-response systems based in ignorance, repulsion, and desire.\nAs a result, a major theme in Buddhist philosophy is to understand the\nbodymind mechanisms of the inner self or consciousness, to recognize\nhow our emotions, ideas, mental states, and even philosophical\nassumptions color our perceptions of reality. The problem is not\nillusions within reality, but the self-delusions we mistake for\nreality. Buddhism brought to Japan not only an awareness of the inner\ndynamics of experience, but also a collection of epistemological,\npsychological, ethical, hermeneutic, and metaphysical bodymind\ntheories and practices aimed at understanding and eradicating those\ndelusions. Without those delusions our bodymind would be in accord\nwith the way things are and we could live without the anguish created\nby trying to live in a concocted reality we desire instead of reality\nas it is. \nA third general Buddhist contribution to Japanese thought since\nancient times is its theory of volitional action or karma\n(gō). Every volitional thought, word, or deed has an\nimpact on the bodymind system such that present actions lead to\npropensities for future actions within that system. Furthermore, karma\nis Janus-headed in its causality such that those present actions are\nalso in part conditioned by previous volitional actions as well. The\nresult is that I affect my surrounding conditions even as those\nsurrounding conditions are affecting me. Thus, the Buddhist theory of\nkarmic action implies a field of interresponsive agency that is\nparadoxically both individuated and systemic, both volitional and\nconditioned. That paradigm has raised a number of issues and generated\nmultiple theories by Japanese Buddhist ethical and social philosophers\nthrough the centuries. \nThe fourth major source of Japanese philosophy, the first of the two\nadditional ones to enter modern Japan, has been the aforementioned\ninflux of Western philosophy into the universities. As\ntetsugaku, Western philosophy became a standard discipline in\nthe newly established Japanese universities designed on Western\nmodels. The philosophy courses, like most other subjects of Western\norigin, were initially taught by Westerners, mainly professors from\nGermany and the United States who came to Japan to teach the\ndiscipline in their native languages. To prepare students to benefit\nfrom that instruction, the government established a comprehensive\nsystem of preparatory academies (“higher schools”)\nscattered throughout the land in which the highly qualified were\ntrained not only in the basic academic disciplines of arts and\nsciences (both Western and East Asian) but also in the Western\nlanguages required for university instruction. Then after completing\ntraining in philosophy at the Imperial University (Tokyo Imperial\nUniversity was the first, then several others were added in other\nmajor cities around Japan), the most promising students were sometimes\nsent abroad to the West for further study, after which time they could\nassume professorships back home. Thus, as in other academic fields,\nphilosophers in Japan were groomed in Western studies from their early\nteenage years until their mid- or late twenties. As a result, their\nphilosophical education was truly global in scope. \nWestern Academic Philosophy and Modernization\n \nAlthough Roman Catholic Christian thought was introduced by\nmissionaries in the fifteenth century, it had a short-lived influence\nof about a century before it was banned as part of the closure of\nJapan to almost all foreign contact. Hence, the first strong and\nlasting impact of Western philosophy came in the late nineteenth\ncentury. Although its impact has been broad and difficult to\nsummarize, a few key points are especially noteworthy. \nFirst, in the two or three centuries preceding the modern period,\nConfucianism and its secular academies dominated the philosophical\nscene. Since Confucian philosophy placed a premium on the mastery of\nclassic historical texts and given the etymology of the neologism\ntetsugaku, it is probably not surprising that the study of\nthe history of Western thought was one pillar of the Japanese\nphilosophy curriculum. Many young philosophers could read the original\ntexts in English, German, or French and sometimes also in Greek or\nLatin. For a wider audience, there was a major publication effort to\ntranslate major Western philosophical works into Japanese. With\nJapan’s new openness to Western ideas, modernization, and the\ndemocracy promised in the Meiji Constitution of 1889, there was\ninitially an attraction to the liberal political ideas of Rousseau and\nJ. S. Mill, for example. \nSecond, the stress on urgent technological and scientific development\nas well as the chance to break free from the canonicity of\nConfucianism (and to a lesser extent Buddhism) led to an almost\nimmediate interest in Comte’s positivism and Mill’s\nutilitarianism. With the new emphasis on mathematics and science,\nthere was also an interest in the new (still\n“philosophical”) field of experimental psychology\nrepresented by Wilhelm Wundt and William James. \nIn the long run, however, German philosophy, especially German\nidealism had the most lasting and deep influence. This was partly a\nfortuitous connection brought about by the close association formed in\nthe late nineteenth century between Tokyo Imperial University and\nGermany. Not only were some key early foreign professors at Tokyo from\nGermany, but also Germany became the favored location for sending\nJapanese philosophy students for foreign study. Another factor was the\nmodernization strategy of Japanese government and intellectual\nleadership. To modernize as quickly as possible, a Western country was\nidentified as the model to emulate for each academic field. For\nexample, for medicine and physics, Germany was the target; for\ngovernment bureaucracy, France; for agricultural science and public\neducation for school children, the United States. Once the decision\nwas made, urgency made it difficult to change direction. And Germany\nwas chosen for philosophy. In that context even more than Plato or\nDescartes, Kant was considered the key figure for the founding of\ntetsugaku. He had settled the challenge of Hume’s\nskeptical stance toward science, saved us from scholastic theological\nmetaphysics by establishing critical philosophy and the antinomies, as\nwell as given direction––either positive or\nnegative—to the development of Fichte’s philosophical\nanthropology, Hegel’s dialectical thinking, Schopenhauer’s\nand Nietzsche’s Will, Kierkegaard’s subjectivism, and the\nlater school of neo-Kantianism. At least that became the mainstream\nview among the majority of Japan’s early twentieth-century\nphilosophers. \nThe fifth fountainhead of Japanese philosophy did not originate from\nabroad but bubbled up from within Japan itself in the modern period:\nbushidō, the Way of the warrior. Although there had been\nedifying handbooks and martial codes in Japan for centuries preceding\nthe modern period, bushidō was formalized only in the\nmodern period as a school of thought with a political, ethical, and\nethnic ideology in service of the state. Loyalty was originally a\ngeneralized lower-order Confucian virtue but bushidō\ngave it a special meaning by linking it directly to the emperor and\nthe holographic paradigm supporting the imperial system in State\nShintō. The emphasis on dying as the fullest expression of\nloyalty seems to have been most foregrounded in 1701 with the famous\nAkō Incident of the Forty-seven Masterless Samurai, later\nvalorized in popular literature and dramatic performances. A\ncontributing factor in that cult of death may have been the emphasis\non the death of the ego-self in Zen Buddhism, a locution used by\nRinzai Zen masters in training unemployed samurai who joined the\nmonastery during the centuries of the Tokugawa peace. In addition\nbushidō emphasized the value of makoto,\ngenuineness or trustworthiness, a term with originally Shintō\nconnotations. Added to those native influences was the imported\nnineteenth-century European ideologies of ethnic virtue, the purity of\na given race of people as constituting the basis for a nation\nstate. \nBushidō and National Morality \nBushidō philosophy is, therefore, a true hybrid of\nConfucian, Buddhist, Shintō, and European parentage.\nIdeologically it claimed to have been a philosophy of the Japanese\npeople harking back to ancient times but its parentage is clearly\nnineteenth century. Because of its hybridity, however, its history was\noccluded and its tenets were couched in terms deemed traditional but\noften given nuances they had not had previously. Hence,\nbushidō was almost impervious to philosophical critique,\nespecially when it was protected by government censorship and\ninstitutionalized in the mandatory national educational curriculum for\nschool children called National Morality. In an important sense it is\nnot at all a philosophical stream comparable to the others, but its\nimpact should not be overlooked because it did affect the flow (and\nthe stagnation) of the other streams for the first half of the\ntwentieth century. That brings us to an overview of the eddies and\ncross-currents of the five streams in Japanese history. \nThe ancient and classical periods of Japanese philosophy span the\nyears 604 (the traditional date of Shōtoku’s\nSeventeen-article Constitution) to 1185 (the fall of\naristocratic rule and the installation of the first military\nshogunate). In the usual Japanese reckoning, it covers the Late Kofun\n(or Asuka), Nara, and Heian periods. During that time Buddhism came to\ndominate the philosophical landscape by allocating the social and\nlegal systems to Confucianism and relegating proto-Shintō to a\nsubordinate place within its expanded, all-inclusive system. Prince\nRegent Shōtoku’s hope, as expressed in his\nConstitution, was to establish Buddhism as a state religion\nbut to continue state rituals venerating the proto-Shintō\nkami, while adhering to Confucian ideals (along with some\nChinese Legalist ideas) in organizing a centralized state government.\nEven after Shōtoku’s pro-Buddhist Soga family fell from\npower, the basic model endured. Chinese laws served as models and\nBuddhist texts and teachers continued to flow into Japan. \nWhen the first permanent capital was established in Nara in the eighth\ncentury, the city plan included a number of Buddhist temples,\nShintō shrines, and Buddhist institutes or study centers,\nincluding those of the so-called Six Nara Schools (all based on\nChinese Buddhist schools with roots traceable to India). Buddhist\npractice, especially for intensive periods, was often performed in\nmountain temple retreats in natural settings rather than in the city.\nCreative and innovative thinking was limited at this point, but that\nwould change with the establishment of two new schools at the\nbeginning of the ninth century, Tendai (founded by Saichō,\n767–822) and Shingon (founded by Kūkai, 774–835).\nAlthough both traditions originated in China, they assumed\ndistinctively comprehensive Japanese forms that would set the\ntrajectory of Buddhist philosophy in Japan for centuries to come. The\nmajor factor behind their success was their focus on “esoteric\nteachings” (mikkyō). In establishing that core\norientation, Kūkai was the pioneering figure and the more\nsophisticated philosopher, indeed often considered Japan’s\ngreatest premodern systematic thinker. (See the entry on \n Kūkai.) \nThe linchpin in Kūkai’s philosophy was his distinction\nbetween engaged and detached knowing, which he formulated in terms of\nthe “difference between esoteric teachings\n(mikkyō) and exoteric teachings\n(kengyō).” (See the entry on \n Kūkai, section 3.2.)\nThe esoteric involves an interpersonal engagement between the cosmos\n(the activity of patterned, self-structuring resonances called\nDainichi Buddha) and the Shingon practitioner (who is a bodymind\nholographically inscribed with the same pattern as the cosmos). Wisdom\noccurs when the theory-praxis of the Shingon Buddhist enables the\ncosmic functions and the person’s functions to be in accord,\nthat is, to resonate harmoniously. \nBy contrast, Kūkai claims that detached or exoteric understanding\noccurs when there is a separation between knower and known, a gap that\ncan only be bridged with the external application of linguistic\ncategories or heuristic expressions (hōben; Sanskrit:\nupāya). So an exoteric philosophy, even if it knows\nabout engagement, cannot ground its own theory in an engaged\nway because it depends on external relations even to express itself.\nIt is, in effect, a theory about bodymind unity that is based only in\nthe mind. That realization led Kūkai to argue the inherent\nlimitation in exoteric philosophy is what gives rise to it, what in\nBuddhist terminology is called its mindset\n(jūshin). \nKūkai used relegation to explain his detailed “theory of\nthe ten mindsets” (jūjūshinron). (See the entry\non \n Kūkai, section 3.12.) \nHe analyzed all the philosophical\nstandpoints known to him into a hierarchy of the ten mindsets\nproducing them, starting from the base level of narcissistic\nphilosophy driven by animal impulses, up through the mindsets of\nConfucianism, Daoism, and continuing in the hierarchy through all the\nBuddhist schools existing in Japan at the time. Kūkai ranked\nKegon Buddhist philosophy at level nine, the highest level of exoteric\nthinking because it highlighted internal and holographic relations.\nOnly Shingon’s esoteric philosophy of embodied theory-praxis\nranked above it. \nIn determining his rankings, for each level Kūkai asked whether\nthat mindset could establish its own ground within its own terms. For\nexample, to put one’s own interest above others, the\nnarcissistic mindset (level one) must account for the existence of\nthose others in one’s own awareness. That, in turn, leads to an\nunderstanding that the self must be relational, a fundamental\nassumption of the Confucian mindset found in level two. That is, even\nthe egoism of narcissism, upon examination, assumes a relational self\nof the sort that is the point of departure for a Confucian analysis.\nThus a lack of foundation in mindset one opens to the prospect of\nmindset two. At the other end of the scale, Kegon Buddhism’s\nlevel-nine mindset generates a theory of the interpenetration of all\nthings and the holographic relation of whole-in-every-part, but to do\nso the mind must stand outside reality to characterize it as such.\nYet, its own theory implies the knower cannot be independent of the\nknown, nor the mind from the body. That opens the door to a praxis of\nengagement that is the basis for the esoteric mindset (level ten). \nKūkai argues the “mind” of the Shingon mindset is\nmore like “bodymind” because it is a knowing inseparable\nfrom praxis. Whereas a philosophy based in metaphysical theory can\nnever establish its own ground, a philosophy based in an engaged\nbodymind praxis can produce its ground as surely as, we might\nsay, the understanding of the master potter is produced in a masterful\nwork of pottery. Whereas the exoteric philosopher, using detachment\nand assuming external relations between self and reality, presents\ntruth as ideas linking those two relatents, the esoteric philosopher\nengages self and reality in an internal relation, presenting truth as\na unified bodymind performance of thought, word, and deed. In\nKūkai’s terminology, “one achieves buddha in, with,\nand through this very body” (sokushinjōbutsu).\n(See the entry on \n Kūkai, section 3.9.) \nAlthough Kūkai’s philosophy itself did not become dominant\nin the Japanese tradition, he set a pattern for philosophizing that\n(often without acknowledgment) continued to influence many later\nphilosophers even into modern times. First, he firmly entrenched a\npreference for internal and holographic relations. Second, he\ndemonstrated that a strong philosophical position should not only be\nable to show weaknesses in other positions but also, if it is truly\ncomprehensive, it should be able to explain how such an error or\nmisunderstanding could occur. In other words assimilation through\nrelegation is a stronger position than simple refutation because it\ntakes opposing theories as real theories deserving a place within any\nall-inclusive account of reality. Third, a way to evaluate a new\nphilosophical position is to try to understand the mindset that\nproduced it. That methodological strategy would be especially helpful\nas Japanese philosophers encountered new theories from other\ncultures. \nAs the classical period continued, Buddhist philosophizing was\nconcentrated in the monastic communities, especially the huge mountain\ncomplexes of Mt Hiei in Kyoto representing Tendai Buddhism and Mt\nKōya representing Shingon Buddhism. At first borrowing from\nShingon, Tendai soon evolved its own form of esotericism with\nadditional input from emissaries sent to China for further training.\nSince Tendai was already the most comprehensive form of exoteric\nteaching in Japan, when mated with esotericism, it became the most\ninclusive and comprehensive system of philosophy and praxis in the\ncountry. As a result, by the end of the classical period the monastic\ncenter on Mt Hiei emerged as the premier site of monastic education\nand philosophical training. \nFor the lay aristocrats, the Heian court of Kyoto was the hub for the\nclassical study of both Chinese and Japanese arts and letters,\nbecoming a fertile ground for aesthetic theories, some of which were\nborrowed from China, but others emerging from more native\nsensitivities. The notion of reality as a self-expressive\nfield—whether formulated in terms of the native idea of\nkokoro or of the activity of the cosmos-as-buddha, whether\nseen as permeated with the spiritual power of kami or\nbuddhas, whether relished for the poignancy of its impermanent beauty\nhowever fleeting (as in the aesthetic of aware in Lady\nMurasaki’s Tale of Genji) or seen as a detached object\nfor amusement (as in the aesthetic of okashi in Sei no\nShonagon’s Pillow Book)—became a focal point for\nthe cloistered world of the Heian court, generating an artistic\nsensitivity and vocabulary that became a cornerstone of Japanese\naesthetics. As the classical period drew to a close, however, the\ncloistered worlds of the monastery and the Heian court would come\nunder attack and philosophical innovation would need to find new\ncontexts. \nThe medieval period witnessed the destabilization of the social,\npolitical, and religious order. The luxuries and amusements of court\nlife had become so attractive that many aristocrats abandoned their\nfar-flung estates to spend more time in the capital, entrusting their\nwealth-generating domains to the hands of their stewards, the\nsamurai (“those who serve”). Eventually, the\nsamurai took over the domains for themselves, then fought each other\nfor national dominance until the Minamoto were victorious in 1185,\nestablishing Japan’s first military government or shogunate in\n1192. To protect its vulnerable position, it centered its operations\nin Kamakura, leaving the court and the emperor in Kyoto. The political\ninstability and the attendant economic upheaval were exacerbated by an\nunusually devastating period of natural disasters, pestilence, and\nfamine. When personal survival was at stake, the complex theories and\npractices of Shingon and Tendai Buddhism were of little solace to most\npeople. Furthermore, the financial success of the monastic centers had\nled to institutional corruption and a popular theory was that Buddhism\nhad entered its final Degenerate Age (mappō) in which\nteachings were lost, could no longer be understood, and enlightenment\nno longer attained. Tendai’s Mt Hiei, which had been a magnet\nfor many of Japan’s brightest and most gifted thinkers, started\nto lose some of its most talented monks as they left the mountain and\neventually advanced new Buddhist philosophies resulting in the rise of\nnew religious sects, most notably Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren. \nAmong the founders of the so-called Kamakura New Religions, the Pure\nLand philosopher Hōnen (1133–1212) expressed a seminal idea\nthat keynoted the greater movement. (See the entry on \n Japanese Pure Land Philosophy, section 3.) \nA noted Tendai master of Mt Hiei’s texts\nand practices, both esoteric and exoteric, he was frustrated with his\npersonal failure to find any liberating insight. As a Tendai\nphilosopher, however, he recognized one teaching that could lead to a\nnew philosophical approach, namely, the holographic paradigm of the\nwhole-in-every-part. Tendai had used it to go from simplicity to\nreveal ever greater levels of complexity, but might it now also be\nreversed? Could it not be used to pare complexity down to a minimal\nparticularity that would still be all-inclusive? The key would not be\nto set out to embrace the whole, but instead to select one\nthing––one practice, one teaching, one text—and to\nfocus on that, realizing that by the holographic paradigm ultimately\nnothing would be lost. By that line of thought, Hōnen came to his\nidea of selection (senjaku or senchaku) as\nthe guiding strategy for his engaged philosophy. By engaging a\nproperly selected single teaching or practice, one does not abandon\nthe holistic view but instead discovers it as inscribed in that\nparticular. That philosophical modus operandi became the guiding\nprinciple for all three of the major branches of Kamakura-period\nphilosophies: Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren. \nSelection involves a decision about what to select and a methodology\nfor engaging the selection as a single bodymind focus. Pure Land\nthinkers like Hōnen and Shinran (1173–1263) concentrated on\nthe mythos of the Vow of Amida Buddha to aid those who could not\nattain liberating insight by their own devices or efforts and so\nneeded assistance from outside. Since the theory of the Degenerate Age\nsuggested all people were in that state of personal helplessness,\nAmida’s Vow was intended to serve everyone. For Nichiren\n(1222–1282), the creator of the Nichiren School, the despair of\nthe Degenerate Age was again a consideration, but in his\ninterpretation, the second half of the Lotus Sutra was\nwritten specifically for those times and should be the sole focus of\nselection. For philosophers like Dōgen (1200–1253), the\nfounder of Japanese Sōtō Zen Buddhism, the theory of the\nDegenerate Age was irrelevant. As a result, he selected a single\npractice he considered central to all Buddhist traditions from the\noutset: the state of bodymind achieved in seated meditation\n(zazen) under the guidance of a master. (See the entry on \n Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy.) \nThe biographies of the Kamakura philosophers suggest that most often\ntheir selection process arose from a sudden intuition, or a statement\nfrom an inspiring text or teacher, after a frustrating period of trial\nand error. Since most of them had originally trained at Mt Hiei and\nbecause they were deviating from the Tendai Buddhist\nestablishment’s doctrines and practices, they were accused of\nheresy, which could lead to a penalty of exile or even execution. So\nthey devised ex post facto philosophical justifications for\ntheir choices, often explaining how their new selective teachings and\nmethods were consistent with tradition and demonstrating, by using a\nholographic argument, that nothing significant was really being\nomitted from the orthodox tradition. The situation resulted in some of\nthe most creative medieval theories of metaphysics, philosophical\nanthropology, and philosophies about the structures of experience. \nAs for engaging the selection wholeheartedly in a focused bodymind\nactivity, Hōnen, Shinran, and Nichiren all emphasized\n“entrusting faith” (shinjin) as the Way that\ndissolves the ego-self into a focal object. For the Pure Land\nphilosophers, the object is the fulfillment of Amida Buddha’s\nVow as expressed in the phrase of the nenbutsu (namu\namida butsu “I take refuge in Amida Buddha”), for\nNichiren the power of the Lotus Sutra (especially as further\nholographically particularized in the recitation of its title). In\nsuch cases the model of faith is one of internal relations and\nimmersion in immanence rather than one of external relations and faith\nin a transcendent reality. In the case of Dōgen’s Zen, the\nengagement in zazen is characterized by a state of\nwithout-thinking (hishiryo) in which “bodymind drops\naway.” In that state of full engagement with as-ness\n(inmo or nyoze, how phenomena are before they are\nstructured by concepts), one is at the prereflective point that is in\nitself without meaning, but is the basis from which meaning is\ngenerated in any context. That is the “eye for the truth”\n(shōbōgen) that is the provenance (yue) of\nboth words and praxis. Thus, in Dōgen’s decision to make\nseated meditation his item of selection, he focused on how to find the\nexperiential point from which full engagement can originate. (Kasulis\n2018, 218–34) \nOne benefit of the Kamakura innovations was that their singular\npractices were readily accessible to anyone, even the uneducated. Over\nthe centuries, the Kamakura New Religions gradually became the most\npopular forms of Buddhism in Japan. At the same time, the\nphilosophical justifications for those minimalized practices,\nthe metapraxes, were often highly sophisticated and have continued to\nattract the further reflection of some of the best philosophical minds\nin Japan over the centuries. For example, some twentieth-century\nJapanese philosophers found points of contact between Western\nexistential philosophers’ responses to Angst and the\nmedieval Buddhist philosophers’ responses to the anguish of the\nDegenerate Age. \nWith the decline of the cloistered Heian court, the nature of Japanese\naesthetics underwent a change as dramatic as that of religious\nphilosophies. After the fall of the Minamoto’s shogunate in\nKamakura and the takeover by the Ashikaga, the new shogunate moved its\nheadquarters to Muromachi in Kyoto in 1338. The reestablishment of\nrelations with China precipitated an economic boom and revival of the\nChinese-influenced arts in the capital, but the prosperity was\nshort-lived. Triggered by a dispute over shogunal succession, open\nwarfare broke out in Kyoto, ultimately involving most of the major\nregional military lords from around the country. The capital was\nleveled and the Ōnin War (1467–1477) ended in stalemate but\nnot before the coffers of the shogunate and the court were almost\ncompletely depleted. Upon returning to their home regions, local wars\ncontinued and the entire country entered the Period of Warring\nDomains, lasting for over a century. Without the isolation of a\ncloistered community of aristocratic courtiers, the former aesthetic\ncategories were superseded by new ones suggestive of retreat or\nwithdrawal: withdrawal from the cultured and elegant to the plainness\nof the rustic (wabi), withdrawal from the outward glitter to\nthe lonely, neglected, and isolated (sabi), and withdrawal\nfrom the surface to the quiet, mysterious depths\n(yūgen). These became central categories in the new art\nforms of tea ceremony, poetry, nō drama, and landscaped gardens.\n(See the entry on \n Japanese Aesthetics, sections 3–5.) \nThe Edo period marked a time of relative peace and stability under the\nTokugawa shogunate following the unification of the country by a\nsequence of three hegemons: Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582), Toyotomi\nHideyoshi (1537–1598), and finally Tokugawa Ieyasu\n(1543–1616). Most of the unification occurred at the hands of\nNobunaga with Hideyoshi as his chief general. A major factor in\nNobunaga’s success was his cunning use of the new technologies\nof warfare (canons and muskets) introduced by Portuguese traders in\n1543. \nWith the Portuguese and Spanish ships came Roman Catholic\nmissionaries. The hegemons at times welcomed the Christians as\ninformants about the West and as foils against Buddhism, but at other\ntimes, viciously persecuted them as potential threats in turning the\npeople against the new political order in favor a foreign God. In the\nend, Christianity was banned from the country entirely (with most\nfinality after the closure of Japan to almost all Western contact\nafter 1637). Therefore, although Christianity enjoyed some initial\nsuccess in its number of conversions, its overall impact was limited.\nFormal polemical debates with Buddhists did introduce some new lines\nof argument to Japan especially concerning creation, afterlife, and\nteleology. Snippets reappeared in later Shintō arguments, most\nnotably those by Hirata Atsutane (1777–1843), but in general, as\na philosophical tradition, Christianity’s impact would be\nminimal until its reintroduction to Japan in the modern period. The\nmajor philosophical innovation of the Edo period would not be\nChristianity but rather a new form of Confucianism. \nConfucianism had been part of Japan’s intellectual tradition\nsince ancient times, but a series of events in the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries breathed into it new life. With their skills in\nChinese language, their general knowledge of Chinese culture, and\ntheir intermittent personal contacts in China, Rinzai Zen Buddhist\nmonks often served as advisers about China to the medieval shoguns.\nYet, for the most part, the Rinzai monks had lost touch with Confucian\nmovements in China through much of the medieval era and were surprised\nto discover in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that since\nthe eleventh century totally new forms of Chinese Confucianism had\ndeveloped, what is called in the West neo-Confucianism. \nThat neo-Confucianism included comprehensive philosophical systems\nthat had incorporated ideas and practices from Buddhism and Daoism,\nrelegating them into subordinate places within its own philosophy. The\nConfucianism in Japan that was a legacy from the ancient period barely\ntouched on metaphysical, epistemological, and psychological issues and\nhad hardly mentioned themes related to nature, art, and creativity.\nHence, up to the Edo period, Japanese philosophers had turned to\nBuddhism to address those themes. Indeed, from the time of Kūkai,\nBuddhism had relegated Japanese Confucian thought to being not much\nmore than a social philosophy. The newly imported neo-Confucianism,\nhowever, had assimilated enough Buddhist and Daoist ideas that it\ncould address a full complement of philosophical problems in a single\ncomprehensive system. When the second hegemon, Toyotomi Hideyoshi,\nbrought prisoners of war to Japan from his failed attempt to conquer\nKorea in the late sixteenth century, included in the group were some\nKorean officials who were also scholars of Chinese neo-Confucianism.\nRinzai Zen monks became disciples and soon Japan had its own emergent\nschools of neo-Confucianism, a phenomenon the Tokugawa shogunate would\nwelcome. \nThe Tokugawa regime largely distrusted Buddhism with its armies of\nmonks on Mt Hiei and Mt Kōya and with its popularity among\npeasants who rebelled (for good reason) over high taxes and the\nmismanagement of agricultural resources. Hoping to centralize the\ngovernment by building up large urban centers, the shogunate believed\nConfucianism could support its aims. First, compared with Buddhism and\nChristianity, Confucianism in Japan was basically secular and unlike\nBuddhism had no preexisting institutional networks to conciliate. As a\nphilosophy, Confucianism stresses communal harmony grounded in\nhierarchical social relations, an ideal that had served the state well\nin building Japan’s first permanent capital in eighth-century\nNara. Perhaps it could work again. Lastly, Confucian academies could\nserve the new urban, literate, and mercantile culture the shogunate\nwas envisioning. \nBy the end of the seventeenth century, the home of the Tokugawa\nshogunate in Edo (present-day Tokyo) had grown from a fishing village\nto a metropolis larger than any city in Europe, while Kyoto and Osaka\nwere each close to the size of Paris. A nationwide economy flourished\nby means of a a network of roads and waterways accompanied by a system\nof mercantile laws with a unified monetary system. Literacy soared as\nthe publication industry boomed. The effect on philosophy was profound\nas its center of activity shifted from the Buddhist temples to secular\nurban academies supported by student tuition. This commodification of\nknowledge led to sharp competition among schools of thought, fueling\nan array of new philosophies, each purporting to be an improvement on\nwhat was available elsewhere. See the entry on \n Japanese Confucian Philosophy, section 3.) \nBesides schools directly imported from China, Japanese Confucians\ndeveloped their own variations, occasionally assimilating aspects of\nShintō. Even more syncretic were teachers of practical philosophy\nwho directed their teachings to ordinary townspeople, mixing various\nlevels of teaching and praxis (including Buddhism and Shintō)\naccording to the needs and talents of the audience, even to the extent\nof having different wings in their academies dedicated to different\nlevels and kinds of teaching for different audiences. \nA major theme across many varieties of Edo-period Confucianism was a\nfocus on language. As mentioned above in the discussion of the\nfundamental ideas of Confucian philosophy, a basic assumption is that\nan understanding of a term for a human relation entails a recognition\nof how that relation should be enacted. To know fully what the term\nfriend means, for example, is to know how a friend ought to\nact. That is the principle of the trueing up of terms, or the\nrectification of names. Previous to the Edo period in Japan that was\nabout as far as the analysis went. With the expanded range of issues\naddressed in the new forms of Confucianism, however, the question was\nwhether that same principle could be applied beyond the five binary\nhuman relations. For example, do the essential meanings of terms like\nhuman nature, mind, harmony, principle, or learning\nalso entail normative behaviors? Can a philosophy of education, for\nexample, be generated out of a close analysis of the meaning of the\nancient word for “learning” (gaku) in the classic\nChinese texts? To what extent do words have individual meanings and to\nwhat extent is there a core of terms that are in internal relation to\neach other that can be understood only together? And so forth. Such\nthemes became the center of attention in the Confucian academies and\nthey raised questions about the nature of language and how to study\nit. \nThe concern for language motivated not only the careful reading of\ntraditional texts, but also increasingly sophisticated philological\nstudies into the meaning of ancient Chinese words. Inspired by\ndetailed Chinese glossaries of key terms, Japanese Confucian scholars\nargued among themselves about the correct understanding of central\nideas by doing their own exegeses of texts and etymological or\nphilological discussions. Some (who came to be associated with a\nclassicist movement sometimes called Kogaku) took their\nhistorical philology so strictly that they refused to read any Chinese\nConfucian texts written after Confucius’s own time, considering\nthe assimilative techniques of neo-Confucianism to be dilutions of\noriginal insights, even to the extent of introducing Buddhist or\nDaoist “distortions” to the original meaning of terms. As\nfor philological methodology, again we find a range of opinion. Should\nwe take a detached, scientific approach that analyzes the occurrences\nof words simply in their own contexts as objectively as possible? Or\nshould we try to engage them so that they become our language\nand we can write or even speak in the style of the most ancient\nChinese prose and poetry? How can we best understand language: with\nthe detachment of a philologist or with the engagement of a poet? The\nphilosophers of language in Edo-period Confucianism debated such\nissues. \nThe emphasis on ancient texts, language, and meanings inspired another\ngroup of scholars to pursue an entirely different direction. The\nblatant sinophilia of some of the Japanese Confucians vexed those\nJapanese who wanted to deepen the appreciation of their own ancient\nlanguage and texts. The oldest Japanese texts such as Kojiki\nhad been written in the eighth century, before an effective\northography for Japanese had been fully developed. As a result, many\nparts of those most ancient texts were nearly unintelligible to later\nreaders. Philologists and literary critics in a movement called Native\nStudies (kokugaku) took up the task of breaking the code by\ndiscovering, for example, that ancient Japanese had vowel sounds that\nsoon dropped out of use by the time the orthography had been\nstandardized. That helped account for many apparent discrepancies and\nallowed for insights into ancient expressions. (See the entry on \n The Kokugaku School.) \nFor example, the terms for “awe-inspiring being” and\n“above” have both been pronounced kami since the\neight century, but in ancient Japanese they were separate\nwords pronounced differently, disproving a common theory that there\nwas a semantic link between the two. Such discoveries led some\nthinkers, most notably Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801), to take\nNative Studies in a new direction: the quest for developing a\nShintō philosophy grounded in an understanding of the most\nancient Japanese texts and their language. In essence, Norinaga hoped\nto do for Shintō what Edo-period Confucians were doing for their\ntradition in going back to ancient texts and analyzing their original\nlanguage. \nAs already explained, in ancient Japan proto-Shintō had the\nsketch of a basic world view and set of values, but it had lacked\nphilosophical explanation or argumentative justification. In the early\nninth century esoteric Buddhism supplied the philosophical\nunderpinnings for what was, in effect, a quite similar view of reality\nas a field of interdependent, internally related events that are\nalways in flux. Esoteric Buddhist philosophy had relegated Shintō\nto being a surface manifestation of what, on a deeper level, could be\nexplained as a Buddhist reality. That is roughly how the situation\nstood for much of the medieval period with one notable exception. \nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth century Shintō philosophers in\nthe Watarai lineage had started to pose repeatedly a new argument:\nhistorical priority entails ontological priority or importance. For a\ncreation or cosmogonic theory formulated in diachronic time, the point\nis clear enough. What comes first creates what comes next and hence\nthe latter is ontologically dependent on the former. The remarkable\npoint is that this claim, so common in Abrahamic theories of genesis\nas well as most classical Greco-Roman cosmogonies, seems to have been\nmostly unargued in Japan before the medieval period, primarily because\nBuddhism and Confucianism place little importance in their\nphilosophies on creation myths. Buddhism in particular favors a\ncyclical rather than linear theory of cosmic time and, therefore, in\nclaiming the ontological superiority of buddhas over their\nmanifestations as kami, the argument was based on a\nmetaphysical or logical argument, not an appeal to a chronology of\ncreation. \nIn Shintō philosophy, however, in the centuries following the\nWatarai formulations, the search for the primordial––the\nprimal energy of creation, the primal source of language, the primal\norigin of the Japanese land and its people—became a deepening\ninterest. Certainly, we find that emphasis in Native Studies, in both\nits early philological and literary project as well as in its focus on\nKojiki. Because of Norinaga’s influence,\nKojiki became not only the central canon for Shintō, but\nalso revered as the oldest text with substantial portions written in\nthe “original” language of the Japanese people (yamato\nno kotoba). That language was understood to consist of\nword-things (koto) imbued with the creation of the spirit of\nancient Japan (yamato no damashii). (See the entry on \n The Kokugaku School, section 3.2.) \nThat claim continued into the\nnineteenth-century ideology of State Shintō that argued for the\nrestoration of the original purity of the Japanese people and their\nappropriate role in the “new moment of world history,” a\nkeynote of the Japanese ethnocentrism and imperial militarism of the\nmodern period. \nAlthough Edo-period Buddhism was active in its scholarly productivity,\nits philosophical creativity did not match the activity of either\nConfucianism or Shintō, but there were exceptions. For example,\nJiun Sonja (1718–1804) was a Shingon monk whose career ran\ncounter to the typical pattern in Edo Japan in that he was first a\nConfucian and then became a Buddhist. Early in his career he enrolled\nin the Confucian academy of Itō Jinsai (1627–1705), where\nthere was a strong emphasis on philology, on trueing up the key terms\nby scrutinizing the early Chinese texts. That inspired Jiun to\ninvestigate the roots of Buddhism, but in that case the relevant texts\nwere in Sanskrit, a language barely studied in Japan at the time.\nUndaunted, he took up the study mainly on his own, becoming\nJapan’s premier authority on Sanskrit in the premodern period.\nBased on his research, Jiun argued for a new form of monasticism based\non what he understood to be the original principles of Buddhism that\npreceded and transcended the various sectarian forms of Buddhism known\nin Japan. Thus, Jiun represents yet another example of an Edo-period\nthinker who used philology as a means of unearthing the origins and\nphilosophical principles of a tradition—in his case\nBuddhism—in much the same way as his contemporaries did in\nNative and Confucian Studies. \nAs a philosopher, Jiun’s acumen was best displayed in his\narguments in favor of Buddhist over Confucian ethics. Against the\nConfucian charge that Buddhism was antinomian, Jiun pointed to the ten\nBuddhist precepts, the prohibitions against “killing, stealing,\nadultery, lying, frivolous language, slander, equivocation, greed,\nanger, and wrong views.” In comparison with the Confucian\nvirtues, Jiun argued, they were not only more specific (and therefore\nmore practical), but also could be shown to have a metaphysical\njustification based in the nature of reality as confirmed by the\nBuddhist experiences of as-ness and universal buddha-nature. By\ncontrast, Jiun pointed out, the Confucian virtues derived from a blind\nacceptance of texts claiming that the ancient Chinese sages had lived\nin a utopian society of harmony. In other words, Buddhist ethics\nemerge from an analysis based in the engagement with immanent reality,\nwhereas Confucian ethics are based in the detached study of texts\nconsidered authoritative. \nAs sinophilia increased among Rinzai Zen monks in the later medieval\nand Edo periods, many Rinzai monasteries became centers for practicing\nthe arts and letters, much in the tradition of the Chinese literati\nand often to the neglect of traditional Zen disciplines. Occasionally,\nRinzai masters like Hakuin Ekaku (1685–1768) reacted against\nthis development and urged a revival of intense and rigorous forms of\npraxis. One teaching that would have important ramifications for later\nevents was an increasing emphasis on death as a theme. When the\nTokugawa peace brought newly unemployed samurai warriors to the gates\nof Rinzai Zen monasteries, some masters like Takuan Sōhō\n(1573–1645), Suzuki Shōsan (1579–1655), and\nShidō Bunan (or Munan 1603–1676) tried to find points of\ncontact between Zen and their martial experience. One strategy was to\ncompare the warrior’s fearlessness in the face of death with the\nZen monk’s fearlessness in the face of losing the ego-self. Of\ncourse, the former occurs only at the moment of battle and the latter\nshould be a mentality of egoless engagement within all the events of\neveryday life. Yet, the comparison would establish a link between\nBuddhist discipline and what would evolve into bushidō,\nthe Way of the warrior in the modern period. \nBy convention the modern period in Japan is considered to\nhave begun with the demise of the Tokugawa shogunate and the formal\nrestoration of the emperor to power in 1868 and continues until today.\nAlthough the Tokugawa were gradually losing control for some decades,\nthe precipitating cause for their downfall was the shogunate’s\ninability to effectively address the incursion of U.S. gunships into\nTokyo harbor in 1854 forcing Japan to open its doors to trade with the\nWest. Although a smattering of information about the West had trickled\ninto Japan during its period of closure starting in 1637, the\nintelligentsia were shocked at how far Japan had fallen behind\ntechnologically. Forced to accept severely unfavorable trade\nagreements first with the United States and then Britain and Russia,\nJapan realized that it had to modernize quickly or fall victim to\nWestern imperialism. Its hope was that somehow it could achieve that\nmodernization through allocating a balance between “Japanese\nspirit and Western ingenuity” (wakon yōsai) that\nis, by finding a way to maintain its fundamental cultural values while\nadopting Western education, science, and technology. That challenge\ninspired much of the philosophical thinking in the late nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries. \nEdo-period Confucianism’s reliance on ancient texts seemed out\nof synch with the demands for modernization. In response, increasing\nemphasis was placed on the acceptance of Western philosophical\ntheories along with Western technologies and social institutions. The\nJapanese were particularly impressed with positivism’s rejection\nof religious metaphysics in favor of empiricism. As for\nutilitarianism, they admired its consequentialist ethics that used an\nempirically derived cost-benefit analysis to determine what would\nbring maximum happiness or pleasure for society as a whole. The\npopularity of Rousseau and Mill’s On Liberty enthused a\ngeneration about the prospect for a Japanese democracy in the form of\na constitutional monarchy. The intellectuals proudly referred to their\ntime as the “Meiji Enlightenment.” There were powerful\nforces contravening against this movement toward liberal democracy,\nhowever, and they were based in the ideologies behind the events that\nhad led to the Imperial Restoration of 1868 itself. \nBeyond the practical considerations—the increasing military\nweakness of the Tokugawa control within Japan, persistent economic\ninstability, recurrent peasant uprisings, the imminent threat of\nforeign invasion, and so forth—three philosophical ideologies\nhad coalesced to support the overthrow of the shogunate and\nrestoration of the emperor. First, the Mito School, a think tank of\nintellectual historians who for centuries were writing a comprehensive\nhistory of Japan, had developed a political interpretation of the\nimperial system as kokutai, basically a theory claiming that\nfrom time immemorial the emperor has embodied the state in such a way\nthat the two are inseparable. Specifically, because of that\nembodiment, the celestial kami who created Japan, the\nJapanese land, and the Japanese people are in a holographical relation\nreflecting, containing, and depending on each other. \nThe second philosophical ideology to support the Restoration was\nNative Studies, which went beyond its original philological and\ntextual interests to construct a Shintō theory of racial purity\nbased in a world view purported to be implicit in the ancient Japanese\nlanguage, mythic narratives, and a primordial view of the land and\ncountry. According to those mythic narratives, the celestial\nkami had appointed the imperial family to rule over the land.\nThat so-called Restoration Shintō was said to predate influences\nfrom the Asian continent including Buddhism and Confucianism. Hence,\nit served as a major resource for the ideology of State\nShintō’s vision of a pure Japanese ethnicity and\nspirituality that served as the nucleus of the first half of the\n“Japanese spirituality and Western ingenuity” formula of\nallocation. \nThe Imperial Restoration also required a third, militant ideology.\nThat came from the warrior ideal that had been developing in the Edo\nperiod, including the willingness to die for one’s lord as the\ndefinitive self-expression of loyalty. Of course, the loyalty had to\nbe directed now to the emperor instead of toward the shogun and the\nhotbed of the samurai revolt behind the Restoration was in the far\nwestern provinces of Satsuma and Chōshū. The lords of those\ndomains not only held a long-standing grudge against the Tokugawa but\nalso enjoyed geographical proximity to secret trade routes with access\nto weapons from the continent that were beyond the scope of the\nweakened shogunate’s surveillance network. \nThe practical exigencies had become so dire that the shogunate might\nhave crumbled without the support of the three philosophical\nideologies, but once the revolution was complete the ideologies formed\nthe political theory behind the new imperial state. Following models\ndeveloped by Germany and Italy, for example, the new Japanese state\nhoned its own identity as a nation state by basing itself in ancient\nmyths of racial uniformity, warrior heroism, ethnic purity, and a\nclaim to a primordial linguistic homogeneity. \nAs tetsugaku, the philosophy done within the university\ndepartments of philosophy fit more the “Western ingenuity”\nside of the wakon yōsai allocation formula and was\ninitially allowed to flourish freely along with the other\nWissenschaften serving the modernization project, especially\nas it restricted itself to the subfields of epistemology, logic,\nphilosophy of science, and metaphysics. The more the academic\nphilosophers ventured into ethics, political philosophy, the\nphilosophy of religion, and even philosophical anthropology, however,\nthe more likely they were to encounter government censorship or even\nimprisonment. Some philosophers like Inoue Tetsujirō\n(1855–1944), Japan’s first native born professor of\nphilosophy and head of the department at Tokyo Imperial University\nused his considerable prestige to lend philosophical support to the\nkokutai theory against liberal democracy and to develop\nbushidō from a code of samurai warriors into a National\nMorality for everyone to be taught throughout the land in the public\nschool system. He based his full-bodied theory of\nbushidō in Japanese ethnicity, loyalty to the\nkokutai, moral discipline, and the study of virtue. For\nInoue, it seems, ethics was mainly morality and, as such, belonged on\nthe spirituality side of the wakon yōsai allocation. \nOthers, perhaps in response to Inoue Tetsujirō’s\ncollaboration with the state ideology, stayed more squarely within the\nmode of Western philosophy but tried to develop a more expansive\nversion of tetsugaku that would allow for Japanese ethical,\nspiritual, and aesthetic sensitivities. Nishida Kitarō\n(1870–1945), the founder of what became known as the Kyoto\nSchool, tried to assimilate Western empiricism and Western idealism by\nrelegating them into a subordinate position within his more\ncomprehensive system of experience and judgments, a system that\ngrounded itself in the Buddhist notion of nothingness. (See entries on\nNishida Kitarō; The Kyoto School.) In general, although still\nunder the sway of German idealism, many important philosophers of the\nfirst half of the twentieth century including Tanabe Hajime\n(1865–1962), Kuki Shūzō (1888–1941), and Watsuji\nTetsurō (1889–1960) developed philosophies that stressed\nculture as a crucial dimension of thought, being critical of what\nseemed to them the overly simplistic dualities of either the\nindividual vs. the universal or individualism vs. collectivism that\nseemed to dominate most Western logical and social theories. Yet, in\nstressing the importance of the cultural and ethnic dimension of human\nexistence, they sometimes found themselves either wittingly or\nunwittingly considered allies of the imperial state ideology. (See\nentry on \n Watsuji Tetsurō; \nfor Tanabe, see the entry on \n The Kyoto School, section 3.4.) \nFor the most part, Confucianism in the Edo period functioned more as a\nsecular philosophy than a religious tradition and so it was no threat\nto the “Japanese spirituality” being cultivated in modern\nJapan. Edifying narratives of Edo-period virtuous (often samurai)\nConfucians made their way into the National Morality curriculum and\nthe Confucian emphasis on academic study was esteemed as a model for\nthe modern student. Yet, because a prevailing view was that\nConfucianism was a foreign tradition based in archaic texts instead of\nempirical data or utilitarianism, it seemed to many Westernized\nintellectuals embarrassingly unmodern. Inoue Tetsujirō, who saw\nWestern utilitarianism and Christianity as threats to the official\nkokutai and bushidō theories, did make the case\nin three books that Edo-period Confucianism was indeed a Japanese\npremodern tetsugaku, implying Japan had no need to seek\nethical theories from the West. Yet, he did little to contribute to\nthe Japanese Confucian traditions of Japan since philosophically,\nafter eight years of study in Germany, his own academic philosophical\nsympathies remained very strongly planted in the German idealism which\nhe promoted vigorously in his home department at Tokyo University. \nBuddhism was in a different situation from Confucianism, however,\nbecause it was both a religion and a philosophy in premodern Japan. As\na “foreign” religion it was deemed a pollutant to the pure\nJapanese spirituality of State Shintō and underwent various forms\nof persecution, even to the extent of mobs desecrating Buddhist\ncemeteries and altars within private homes. The major Buddhist\nreaction was institutional, trying to be less visibly an exception to\nthe new order, at times even encouraging monks to marry and have\nfamilies in service to the national program supporting population\ngrowth, for example. There was also a philosophical response, however.\nWith Buddhism’s wide variety of schools of thought and its\ntraditions of experiential verification, theories of consciousness,\nforms of dialectical logic, alternative forms of knowing, and so\nforth, some intellectuals felt there could be fertile interaction\nbetween premodern Buddhist thought and the newly introduced Western\nphilosophies. As a result, some of the brightest young Buddhist\nseminarians were enrolled in philosophy programs at the Imperial\nUniversities, creating a synergy between Western and Buddhist\nphilosophy in Japan that continues in many quarters until the present.\nIn addition, intrigued by the manner in which Christian theology was\ndrawing on nineteeth- and twentieth-century European philosophies,\npockets of so-called Buddhist-Christian dialogue began to emerge and\nfully blossomed in the post-censorship era after 1945. \nThe postwar period has brought three general developments. First, with\nthe end of censorship of liberal and leftist thought, there was often\na purge of the very idea of “Japanese” philosophy as\nsmacking of nativism, ethnocentrism, jingoism, and State Shintō\nideology. This was often directed, fairly or unfairly, toward\nassimilative traditions like the Kyoto School. In response, the\nimmediate postwar generation or two in most Japanese academic\nphilosophy departments escaped into Western philosophy, often carried\nout with a sense of purity that rivaled the earlier ethnocentric\nmovement. Consequently, the large majority of Japanese academic\nphilosophers trained in the latter half of the twentieth century have\npursued philosophy according to methods and themes hardly\ndistinguishable from those of the West. \nThe second postwar response has been for traditions like the Kyoto\nSchool, born in 1910–1945, to continue to evolve, now without\nthe distraction of the old state ideology’s casting a shadow on\nthe enterprise. This movement has generated increasing interest among\nphilosophers in Europe and the United States, especially those from\nthe more Continental influenced traditions. In some quarters, for\nexample, the Kyoto School is beginning to be recognized in\nphilosophical forums, taking a place alongside other schools of global\nsignificance such as the Marburg or Frankfurt Schools. \nLastly, with the greater availability of translations into European\nlanguages and the sprouting of learned societies for Japanese\nphilosophy in Asia, the United States, and Europe, there are\nincreasingly signs of cross-influence and hybridization. Western\nphilosophers, even those who do not consider themselves Japanese\nspecialists, are participating in the cross-pollination of ideas. As a\nphilosopher does not need to know Danish to be influenced by\nKierkegaard, a philosopher no longer needs to know Japanese to be\ninfluenced by, or even contribute to, Japanese philosophy. The last\nsection of this article outlines some themes in Japanese philosophy\nthat may in the future stimulate philosophers of various backgrounds\nand national origins. \nJapanese philosophy presents alternative models to today’s\ncommon paradigm of philosophy as a Wissenschaft, a form of\ndetached knowing that functions as a “scientific”\ndiscipline within the modern academy. When Japanese philosophy\nconsiders itself a Way rather than a Wissenschaft, it\nstresses engagement over detachment. As an enterprise that may\ntransform both knower and known through a bodymind theory-praxis, that\nJapanese version of philosophy seems to parallel some aspects of\nWestern philosophy in its original, ancient Greek form which also\nemphasized loving wisdom rather than detached knowledge as well as\nknowing oneself rather than impersonal analysis. Thus, the study of\nJapanese philosophy raises not only philosophical questions, but also\nopens into metaphilosophical questions about what philosophy is,\nwhether there are different kinds of philosophy, and how different\nmodels of philosophy may interrelate. \nPhilosophers often think of reality as consisting of elements that are\ndiscovered, engineered, combined, and adapted to meet the needs of\ntheir particular systems. In thinking about those elements of reality,\nWestern philosophy has often depended on primary concepts like\nthings, facts, stuff, sensations,\nsubject, object, being, substance,\nessence, attribute, quality, and so forth.\nAs that list of elemental concepts has become standardized, it has\nserved as a glossary for future thinking and further philosophical\ninitiatives. Philosophers may discover or even craft new elements, but\nthey do so against that preexisting background, like filling gaps\nwithin the periodic table. Commonly, those elements are thought to be\nfixed entities that are connected or acted upon by relational forces\nsuch as causes or agents. Change may also be understood as occurring\nthrough the interaction of forces in dynamic opposition, including\ndialectical opposition. \nBy contrast, Japanese philosophers typically view reality in terms of\na complex, organic system of interdependent processes, a system that\nincludes themselves as the knowers. Thus, the point of departure for\nthe analysis is not a separation between knower and known. Instead, to\nknow reality is to work with it, not as a discrete agent, but as part\nof a common field, designated by such terms as kokoro or the\n“midst” (aidagara). The field consists not of\nthings as much as events or processes such as event-words\n(koto), interpenetration, generative force (ki),\nperformative intuition, pure experience,\nnaturalness (jinen), and so forth. In most Japanese\nphilosophies, oppositional polarities do not create dynamism, but\nrather, dynamism is the primary event out of which the polarities can\nbe abstracted after the fact. The polarities have no independent\nexistence of their own and so cannot cause anything, but only have\nexplanatory value for how the dynamism flows, showing its\nvectors of activity. \nHow might a field model of reality—especially one that\nexplicitly places the thinker within the field being\nanalyzed—challenge the way classical Western philosophical\nproblems have been posed and addressed? For one, philosophizing would\nseem to emanate not from the thinking thing (res cogitans)\nbut from the field of bodymind praxis. \nThe Field of Bodymind Praxis \nIf, as the Japanese model suggests, reality is a field and includes\nthe philosopher within that field, then the Way of philosophy is a\ntheory-praxis event within that field. The implication, then, is that\nphilosophizing involves the bodymind as a whole and not just the mind.\nIn other words philosophy is an embodied cognitive activity.\nAgain, this would not be alien to the ancient Greek philosophers.\nPlato’s dialogues were not between ideas, but between people\nwith ideas; Aristotle’s ethics were empty until embodied through\nthe praxis of habit. Philosophy is as much a product of philosophers\nas pottery is the product of potters. Therefore, to what extent, if\nany, can a philosophy transcend time, place, and culture? There would\nbe no philosophy without a flesh-and-blood philosopher and as a human\nbeing that philosopher is encultured in a particular social milieu.\nLike karma, that milieu conditions the philosopher even as the\nphilosopher conditions that milieu. In provoking such questions,\nJapanese philosophy’s field of bodymind praxis coincides with\nconcerns in both ancient and postmodern streams of philosophy within\nthe West. \nMost Western philosophies, as well as Abrahamic religious theologies,\nthink of personal identity as a discrete, independently existing,\nautonomous agency. That view in turn generates certain assumptions\nabout creative authorship, ethical responsibility, and religious faith\nin a transcendent reality. Such a view of personal identity is seldom\nfound in Japanese philosophy, however. Instead, the self is defined by\na field of interdependent relationships. Confucianism sees the\ndefining relations as a set of interpersonal roles, Buddhism as a\nbroader set of interdependent events or conditions. (Shintō has\nmultiple theories, including sometimes an idea of an individual soul,\nbut even that is often considered holographically inscribed with a\ncollective soul.) If there is generally no independent “I”\nin Japanese philosophy, then how might we understand agency in such\nareas as artistic creativity, ethics, and religious faith? \nAlthough there is an abundance of aesthetic theories in the Japanese\ntradition, artistic creativity is generally thought to originate not\nin the artist but in the artist’s engagement within a field that\nincludes the medium, the auto-expressive character of reality, and the\naudience. All that together—artist, medium, reality, and\naudience—comprises kokoro in its fullest sense. The\ncreativity within art originates not in the individual’s\nself-expression but in kokoro’s auto-expression.\n(Kasulis 2008) \nHence, in creating the work of art, the rock gardener may speak of\n“listening to the rocks,” the ikebana master of\n“working with the flowers.” In his theory of\npoetics, Motoori Norinaga stressed the importance of the audience as\npart of the field of kokoro, claiming that an unread poem is\nnot yet a poem. In the classical Western tradition, creativity was\nsometimes construed as the artist’s being inspired by a muse, in\neffect a double agency. Yet, both agencies—artist and\nmuse—were discrete individuals. How would a philosophy of\nartistic creativity be different if it is one with no discrete\nindividuals, but instead a complex process of an auto-generative\nfield? That would seem to be a provocative question for comparative\naesthetics. (See entry on \n Japanese Aesthetics.) \nAs many Japanese theories of creativity recognize the agency arising\nwithin a field of engagement without the need for a discrete,\nindependently existing “I,” the same can be said for many\nethical theories. With their tenet of no-I, Japanese Buddhist\nphilosophers typically stress egoless responsiveness within a\nsituation rather than the individual’s responsibility to follow\nrules, principles, or divine mandates. As mentioned in section 3.2.1\nabove, even the Chinese Confucian mandate of heaven (C.\ntianming; J. tenmei) never found a comfortable home\nin Japanese Confucianism. Yet, from a Western philosophical\nstandpoint, it may seem paradoxical to speak of an ethics without\neither principles or a sense of responsibility. \nOne way to open a dialogue with the West on this issue is to consider\nthe critique posed by the aforementioned medieval Pure Land\nphilosopher, Shinran, who argued against making rationality the basis\nfor ethics. Basically, he insisted that to try to rationally determine\nwhat is right is to distance oneself from the field of events, to make\nthe self an ego detached from the flow of reality by the very act of\ntrying to “figure it out” (hakarai). Engagement\nwith the events as they occur, by contrast, enables a form of knowing\nthat allows a compassionate response, the true basis of ethics.\nDetachment from events not only feeds the ego (I know what is\nright) but also thwarts the internal relationships that make\ncompassion possible. So. Shinran argues, the attempt to know what is\nright and to apply rational principles undermines rather than enables\ntrue moral behavior. (See the entry on \n Japanese Pure Land Philosophy, section 4.4.) \nIn light of that analysis, on what grounds can we prefer an ethics of\nresponsibility over one of responsiveness or vice versa? The modern\nphilosopher Watsuji Tetsurō claimed that ethics is the\nmanifestation of a philosophical anthropology (Watsuji 1996). That is,\nour ethical theories reflect our understanding of what it means to be\nhuman. Presumably, the same philosophical anthropology informing our\nethics would also underlie, for example, our theories of knowledge,\naesthetics, and politics. If that is correct, ethics cannot be a\nsubfield of philosophical inquiry separate from other subfields. For\nWatsuji, ethics is inseparable from the cultural milieu\n(fūdo) from which we derive meaning as human beings in\nall aspects of our lives. As Watsuji put it, “the study of\nethics is the study of human being.” (See the entry on \n Watsuji Tetsurō, sections 2–3.) \nAgain Japanese philosophies often\nchallenge the sharp bifurcation between the prescriptive and\ndescriptive that has been assumed by much Western philosophy since\nDavid Hume. \nThe Japanese notion of agency without an independent agent has\nramifications within religious philosophy as well, especially in\nrelation to faith. If there is no discrete self and no discrete\ntranscendent being, how can Shin Buddhism explain its central idea of\n“entrusting faith” (shinjin)? Again, Shinran has\nthe most philosophically sophisticated explanation. \nFirst, it is crucial to underscore that entrusting faith is directed\nnot to Amida Buddha (as we might expect in a theistic religion) but\nrather to Amida’s Vow to help bring to enlightenment those who\ncannot make it on their own. In fact, Amida Buddha as a person is only\na heuristic device allowing me a focal point for my entrusting faith\nso that I can surrender all senses of ego and self-agency to it. Once\nI do so, I as a discrete entity disappear into the field of as-ness,\nwhich is Amida in its true, impersonal form as infinite light. In\nother words as long as there is a subject having the entrusting faith,\nthat faith directs itself to depend on the power of the object (the\nVow of the personal Amida). But as the dependence on that objectified\nother-power becomes complete, the subject (the “I” who has\nthe entrusting faith) dissolves. Yet, if there is no subject, the\nobject must simultaneously disappear as well. The result is just the\nspontaneous naturalness of the agentless field, what Shinran calls the\n“working of nonworking” (mugi no gi). \nShinran’s account is certainly a powerful description for\nunderstanding “faith” in a nontheistic religion. Yet, even\nsome theistic religions on the mystical end of the spectrum may speak\nof a God that disappears when engaged fully in a faith that overcomes\ndualism. The aforementioned Kyoto School includes thinkers like Ueda\nShizuteru and Nishitani Keiji who have pursued comparisons with\nMeister Eckhart on precisely those grounds (Ueda 2004). \nAt least since Aristotle (see his Metaphysics 1011), Western\nphilosophers have commonly assumed that the primary meaning (or truth)\nof words lies in their ability to refer to already existing realities.\nOften implicit in that assumption is that (1) reality is fixed, or at\nleast stable enough to be pinned down by linguistic expression; (2)\ncontext is not necessarily determinative in meaning; (3) the audience\nis irrelevant or at least externally, not internally, related to the\nmeaning of the expression; (4) the semantic and syntactic, but not\nphonetic, aspects of the language carry the meaning; and (5) language\ndefines and restricts the possible meanings of things or events. Every\none of those assumptions has been challenged by major Japanese\nphilosophers, both classical and modern. In fact, some important\nthinkers have in one way or another denied or at least qualified\nall of them. \nFrom the Buddhist standpoint of reality as a field of interdependent\nevents in continuous flux, if words stand in external relation to that\nreality, they are perpetually trying to hit a moving target. If\ninstead language arises from engagement with the field itself, then\nthe words, reality, and speaker will express the moment together as\npart of the flux. As the contexts change, so also will the forms of\nexpression. Thus, starting with the sound of words as his foundation,\nKūkai spoke of the internal relations among sound-word-reality.\nBecause the cosmos of things and the utterance of words are both\nvibrations, truth-words (shingon) arise from the resonance\namong the three. We could say Kūkai’s view is that the\ntruth of words arises from their ability to confer with, rather than\nrefer to, reality. (See the entry on \n Kūkai, section 3.7.) \nThe medieval Zen master Dōgen distinguished the raw phenomenal\npresence (genjō) that precedes meaning from how it\nacquires meanings through its dependence within a contextual field.\nThus, the same presence may shift its meaning as the field shifts.\n“If we inquire into the manner and style of the totality of\nphenomena…, we should bear in mind there are many worlds\neverywhere.” (JPS 146) That is, language and phenomena are parts\nof single field that is in flux and can auto-generate multiple\ncontexts and meanings. My book may become a paperweight as soon as a\npuff of wind begins to blow away the papers on my desk, for\nexample. \nThe audience as well is part of the field shared by words, speakers,\nand things. Different expressions are used in addressing different\npeople. For most Japanese Buddhist philosophies, ordinary language is\nalways heuristic expression (hōben; Sankrit:\nupāya) in that words are directed to someone to lead\nthem to some insight. So words are always being adjusted. Mori Arimasa\n(1911–1976) noted that Japanese syntax demands multiple levels\nof formality and politeness indicating the social space shared by\nspeaker and listener. That characteristic, he claims, gives the\nlanguage an inherently second-person, rather than impersonal,\nthird-person feel (JPS 1047–52). \nAnother way Japanese philosophers of language analyze how words can\naddress the fluidity of the field of impermanent, interdependent\nevents is to develop theories that focus on the predicate rather than\nsubject of the sentence as the nucleus of meaning. The sentential\nsubject is usually a noun that refers to a substance and the predicate\nits attribute. To capture a world of events rather than things, on the\nother hand, one can focus on the meaning as emerging from predicate,\nthe subject becoming in effect a modifier rather than a cause or agent\nof the event. Such predicate-based analyses of language were developed\nby Sakabe Megumi (1936–2009), Nishida Kitarō\n(1870–1945), and the linguist Tokieda Motoki (1900–1967).\n(JPS 979–92) \nA final strategy for approaching the word-thing relation is to turn\nthe usual Western assumption upside down and claim that there are no\nthings (mono) at all until language fixates events\n(koto) by imposing names on them. That is, words do not refer\nto pre-existing things, but rather, words create things. The\npsychiatrist-philosopher Kimura Bin (1931– ) has analyzed the\nhuman compulsion to stabilize and reify the flow of events as an\neffort to reinforce our sense of a discrete ego (JPS\n958–72). \nUeda Shizuteru (1926– ), a member of the Kyoto School, has\ndeveloped a detailed theory of language along similar lines (JPS\n766–84). Like Zen Master Dōgen, Ueda argues language\ntranslates the empty, not-yet-meaningful “pre-thing”\n(Vor-sache) into a thing with meaning. Having evoked\nthat meaning, the word recedes back into the hollow void and the thing\ntakes its place in the totality we call “world.” If we\nneed to subsequently point to those things, we can again call up the\nword that originally conjured up the thing since the word-thing link\nhas already been established and the word can simply refer back to\nthat link without creating anything new. That is not the whole story,\nhowever. There are other words (fictional, metaphorical, poetic\nexpressions) that do not point to such things in the world at all but\nare “hollow words.” Such words are not about things as\nmuch as they are about words themselves or, better stated, about\nhow words work. Ueda claims, therefore, that through poetic\nand religious language, we do not learn about things, but about the\norigin of things, about how the “world” came into being\nand how meaning is generated.  \nThese themes and approaches suggest just a few of the riches in\nJapanese philosophy that might intrigue a philosopher from any\nculture. As Japanese philosophy becomes better known and increasingly\naccessible through translation and Western commentaries, it seems\nlikely it may engage an ever wider circle of philosophers worldwide,\nbecoming a resource for Western philosophy as Western philosophy has\nhistorically been a resource for it.","contact.mail":"kasulis.1@osu.edu","contact.domain":"osu.edu"}]
