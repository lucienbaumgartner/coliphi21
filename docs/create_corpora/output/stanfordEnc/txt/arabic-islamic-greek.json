As a consequence, the Greek\ntexts in translation are conceived of as instruments for the\nphilosophers to perform the task of seeking\n wisdom.[2]\nHowever, most scholars\nfrequently side with the opinion that what gave rise to the\nintellectual tradition of falsafa was the so-called movement\nof translation from\n Greek.[3]\nThis entry will not discuss the issue, let\nalone try to settle it: it will limit itself to present the\nphilosophical Greek sources made available from the beginnings of the\ntranslations into Arabic to the end of the 10th century. The reason for\nfocusing on the various stages of the assimilation of the Greek\nheritage, instead of taking into account one by one all the works by\nPlato, Aristotle etc. known to Arabic\n readers,[4]\nis that it is useful to get an idea of what was translated at\ndifferent times. As a matter of fact, a living interplay took place,\nespecially in the formative period of\nfalsafa, between the doctrines of the philosophers writing in\nArabic and the Greek sources made available. Of momentous importance\nfor the development of falsafa was the simultaneous\ntranslation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics and De Caelo,\nsome writings by Alexander of Aphrodisias (most of them of\na cosmological nature), Plotinus’\nEnneads IV–VI, and Elements of Theology by\nProclus. Al-Kindi, the first faylasuf, initiated the\nincorporation of the Aristotelian, Peripatetic and Neoplatonic\ndoctrines; at the same time, he reproduced them in his\nphilosophical works. Later on, the knowledge of the complete\nAristotelian corpus provided by another generation of translators,\nwithout altering substantially this picture, produced a different\napproach. The Aristotelian science as a systematic whole, ruled by\ndemonstration and made available together with Euclid, Ptolemy,\nHippocrates and Galen, paved the way for al-Farabi to build up the\nproject of a curriculum of higher education, which was meant to\nsubsume the native Islamic sciences in the broader system of the\nliberal arts and philosophical sciences. Both the cross-pollination of\nthe Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions of the Kindian age, and\nthe rise of a complete system of rational sciences in the light of\nFarabi’s educational syllabus of the philosopher-king, lie in the\nbackground of Avicenna’s program to provide the summa of\ndemonstrative science—from logic to philosophical\ntheology—as a necessary step for the soul to return to its origin,\nthe intelligible realm (Endress 2006). When Averroes, two centuries\nafter the end of the age of the translations, resumed the project of\nbuilding up the demonstrative science as a systematic whole, he had\nrecourse to the Greek sources in Arabic translation which were\navailable in the Muslim West, mostly Aristotle and his\n commentators.[5]\n\n\n\nBefore the rise of Islam, a multisecular tradition of learning\n(Brock 1977, 1994; Bettiolo 2005; Watt 2010) had already achieved in Syria the\ntransition “from antagonism to assimilation” (Brock 1982)\nof the Greek philosophical\n culture,[6]\nespecially but not exclusively\n Aristotelian.[7]\nWithin the\ntheological schools of Edessa and Nisibi, during the 4th and 5th\ncenturies, not only were the exegetical works translated from Greek\ninto Syriac (e.g. those of Theodorus of Mopsuestia), but so were\nphilosophical works (in particular, Aristotle’s logical writings\nand Porphyry’s Isagoge). The continuity between the\nNeoplatonic schools of late Antiquity, with their typical approach to\nthe Aristotelian corpus (Hadot 1991), is best exemplified by Sergius of\nReshʿayna (d. 536), a physician who held a prominent position in\nthe Syriac Church (Hugonnard-Roche 2001, 2004). A former student of\nAmmonius in the Neoplatonic school of Alexandria, Sergius translated\ninto Syriac some thirty treatises by Galen, the pseudo-Aristotelian\n De Mundo,[8]\na treatise by Alexander of Aphrodisias, On\nthe Principles of the All (lost in\n Greek),[9]\nthe writings of Dionysius the\nPseudo-Areopagite and Evagrius Ponticus (Watt 2011); he is also the author of a\ntreatise on Aristotle’s Categories and another one on\nthe scope of Aristotle’s\n writings.[10]\nAfter the Arab conquest of\nDamascus (635) and the whole of Syria (636), the Christian intellectual\ncommunities living under the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) continued to\nassimilate Greek philosophy and\n science,\nfocusing in particular on the\nAristotelian logical corpus together with its Neoplatonic introduction,\nnamely, Porphyry’s\n Isagoge.[11] \nThis tradition of learning\n(Gutas 1983; Brock 1993; Hugonnard-Roche 2004; 2007; 2009; 2011) lay in the background\nof many of the Christians of Syria who took part in the translation\nmovement fostered by the early ʿAbbasid Caliphate (Watt 2004, Janos 2015).\nAlbeit superseded in number and importance by the translations into\nArabic, translations into Syriac continued even amidts the growing \ntranslations into Arabic, in the ʿAbbasid capital of\nBaghdad. \n\nAlready in Damascus, under the Umayyads, some philosophical writings\nhad been translated into Arabic. Salim Abu l-ʿAla’,\nsecretary to the caliph Hisham ibn ʿAbd al-Malik (r. 724–743),\ninitiated the translation of the pseudo-Aristotelian letters on\ngovernment to Alexander the\n Great.[12]\nThis collection forms the nucleus of the most\nfamous among the “mirrors for princes”, the Sirr\nal-asrar (Grignaschi 1967, 1976; Manzalaoui 1974), known in the\nLatin Middle Ages and early modern times as the Secretum\n secretorum.[13]\nOne of the Arabic translations of the\npseudo-Aristotelian De Mundo also traces back to this period\n(Grignaschi 1965–66). However, it was under the ʿAbbasids\n(750–1258), and in particular in the first two centuries of their\ncaliphate, that the translations blossomed. \n\nApparently, the first translations of the ʿAbbasid era were\nproduced under the caliphate of al-Mansur (r. 754–775): his secretary\nIbn al-Muqaffaʿ (d.\n 756)[14]\nis credited with the translation (or\nproduction) of a compendium of Porphyry’s Isagoge, plus\nthe Categories, De Intepretatione and Prior\n Analytics.[15]\nIt has been contended (Gabrieli 1932, Kraus\n1934) that this authorship rests on a mistake and that this work should\nbe attributed to his son, Muhammad ibn ʿAbdallah\nal-Muqaffaʿ (fl. under the reign of al-Ma’mun, see\nbelow); however, other scholars accept the father’s\n authorship,[16]\nwith the result\nthat a companion of Aristotelian logic was already available in the\nfirst decades of the ʿAbbasid caliphate, under the ruler who\nfounded Baghdad (762). His son and successor al-Mahdi (r. 775–785) had\nthe Topics translated for him by the Nestorian\nPatriarch\n Timothy I (d. 823).[17]\nIt\nhas been advanced that the ancient Arabic translation of the\nRhetoric, “edited” by Ibn al-Samh (d.\n 1027),[18]\ntraces back to\nthe 8th century (Aouad 1989c, 456–7). Under the reign of Harun\nal-Rashid (r. 786–809) a translation of Aristotle’s\nPhysics was made by a certain Sallam\n al-Abrash.[19]\nNeither\ntranslation has come down to us. \n\nA great deal of translations made under the reign of al-Ma’mun\n(r. 813–833) and his successors are extant. The new interpretation of\nIslam and of the role of the caliph promoted by\n al-Ma’mun,[20]\nas well as the\nincreasing interest in the secular sciences of the elites of\nIslamic\n society,[21]\ncreated the context for the development of the translations into\nArabic. Even though the court library (Bayt\nal-hikma,“House of\n Wisdom”)[22]\ncannot be viewed as an\ninstitutional center for the translations of Greek works into\n Arabic,[23]\na close\nrelationship existed between the activities of the first group of\ntranslators and the court. The leader of this group, the encyclopaedic\nscientist and first faylasuf Abu Yaʿqub ibn\nIshaq\n al-Kindi,[24]\nwas\nappointed as the preceptor of the son of the successor\nof\nal-Ma’mun, al-Muʿtasim\n(r. 833–842):\none of Kindi’s works is addressed to al-Ma’mun, whereas his\n major metaphysical writing, On First\n Philosophy,[25]\nis addressed to\nal-Muʿtasim. How do we know that there was a group of translators\nand that al-Kindi was its leader? The ancient sources give a hint to\nthis, in so far as they mention, for instance, that the earliest\ntranslation of Aristotle’s Metaphysics was made\nfor\n him.[26]\nAlso, the incipit of the well-known\n Theology of Aristotle \n claims that he acted as the\nrevisor of this work, in fact an adapted translation of parts of\nPlotinus’ Enneads IV–VI. Since it has been established\n(Endress 1973) that the same lexical and syntactical features of the\ntwo translations just mentioned are shared by other translations from\nGreek, one can be reasonably sure that several translators exchanged\namong themselves and with al-Kindi: the latter has been described as\nthe spiritus rector of this group (Endress 1997a; 2007).\nThe translations of this circle include works by Plato, Aristotle,\nNicomachus of Gerasa, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Plotinus, Proclus, John\nPhiloponus and Olympiodorus. It is worth noting that the texts of\nPlotinus, and in part those of Proclus and Philoponus, did not\ncirculate under the names of their authors: Plotinus circulated under\nthe name of Aristotle (Rosenthal 1974), Proclus under those of\nAristotle and Alexander of Aphrodisias, and Philoponus under the name\nof Alexander (see below). \n\nPlato. An early translation of the Timaeus is\nmentioned in the bio-bibliographical\n sources,[27]\nbut it has not come down to us. The circulation of at least\nparts of the \nSymposium,[28]Phaedo (Aouad 1989a; Gutas 2012, 855), and \nRepublic[29]\nshould be acknowledged in the age of al-Kindi. \n\nAristotle. The early translation of the Metaphysics\nmade for al-Kindi has come down to\n us;[30]\nthe translator is the otherwise\nunknown\n Ustath.[31]\nOther\nAristotelian works translated within the Kindi’s circle are the\n Prior Analytics,[32]Sophistici Elenchi,[33]De Caelo,[34]Meteorologica,[35]De Generatione animalium and De\n Partibus animalium,[36]Parva Naturalia and possibly the De Anima,[37]\nplus a paraphrasis\nof this work in clear Neoplatonic vein (Arnzen 1998; 2003; Gannagé 2012, 533). As shown by Ullmann (2011–2012), the Arabic translation of Books V–X of the Nicomachean Ethics must be traced back to Ustath (see also Schmidt-Ullmann 2012). In addition to the\ngenuine Aristotelian works, some pseudepigrapha were also either\ntranslated in this period, or produced within the circle of al-Kindi:\nthese are of pivotal importance for the rise and development of\nfalsafa. It has been established on firm grounds (Endress\n1973) that the circle of al-Kindi produced the translation and\nreworking of significant parts of the Enneads IV–VI (known as\n the Theology of\n Aristotle)[38]\nas well as the translation and reworking of\nProclus’ Elements of Theology (known as the Book by\n Aristotle on the Pure Good). The\n Theology[39]\nwas the most\ninfluential of the two in the Arabic-speaking world, whereas the\n Book by Aristotle on the Pure\n Good[40]\nwas bound to become immensely\nfamous in the Latin world, under the title Liber de\nCausis. Other pseudo-Aristotelian writings trace back to\nthis period: the K. al-tuffaha (Liber de Pomo),\nnamely, a reworking of the Phaedo with Aristotle replacing the\ndying Socrates (Aouad 1989a; Gutas 2012, 855), and a Physiognomic (Thomann\n2003). \n\nNicomachus of Gerasa. The Introduction to\nArithmetic was translated within the circle of al-Kindi\n(Altmann-Stern 1958, 35; Endress 1997a, 55; Freudenthal 2005). \n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. (i) Commentaries. The first book\nof Alexander’s commentary on the De Gen. corr., lost in\nGreek, is said to have been translated by Qusta ibn\n Luqa,[41]\na physician and\ntranslator who came from Baalbek to Baghdad in the first decades of the\n9th century and had exchanges on medical and philosophical matters\nwith\n al-Kindi.[42]\n(ii) Personal works. Of prominent importance are two writings lost in\nGreek: On Providence (Fazzo-Wiesner 1993) and a cosmological\ntreatise known in Arabic as On the First Cause, the effect and its\nmovements (ed. Endress 2002). From the circle of al-Kindi comes\nalso the translation of a series of Alexander’s genuine\nQuaestiones, intermingled in the manuscript sources with\npropositions of Proclus’ Elements of Theology, attributed to Alexander (Endress\n1973; overview on the Arabic Alexander by Genequand 2011 and 2017). \n\nPlotinus. Around AD 840 parts of Enneads IV–VI\n(devoted in the Porphyrian edition of Plotinus’ writings to soul,\nthe intelligible world and the One) were translated into\n Arabic.[43]\nThe problems\nabout this translation, and in particular about the transformation of\nparts of it into the Theology of Aristotle, are dealt with\nin a separate\n entry.[44]\nFor present purposes, it will suffice to\nmention the fact that at the beginning of the Theology of\nAristotle an author, speaking as if he were Aristotle,\nproclaims to have devoted this treatise to the First Cause, Intellect\nand Soul, after having dealt with matter, form, the efficient and final\ncauses in his Metaphysics. This proclaimed\n“Aristotelian” authorship of the Theology \ngranted Plotinus’ doctrine an extraordinary impact on subsequent\nArabic philosophy, especially in the East of the Muslim world. \n\nProclus. As we have seen before, the Elements of\nTheology were translated into Arabic within the circle of\nal-Kindi (Endress 1973; on later circulation, see Wakelnig 2006, 2011;\nup-to-date survey by Endress 2012); some propositions were attributed\nto Alexander of Aphrodisias under various titles—On the\nFirst Cause, On the Existence of Spiritual Forms with no\nmatter, On the Difference between eternity and\ntime, On Coming-to-be, On the Body (van Ess\n1966; Endress 1973; Zimmermann 1994). This collection of Proclus’\npropositions is sometimes labelled as Account of what Alexander\nhas extracted from Aristotle’s book called Theology (Endress\n1973, 53; Zimmermann 1986, 189–90; Goulet-Aouad 1989a, 133;\nFazzo 2003, 64–5). Another writing by Proclus, extant in Greek\nonly through the quotations by John Philoponus in his\nDe Aeternitate mundi, was translated into Arabic in this\nperiod: the Eighteen arguments on the Eternity of the Cosmos\nagainst the Christians (Endress 1973, 15–16; Endress 2012,\n1657–61; see also Wakelnig 2012). \n\nJohn Philoponus. The bio-bibliographical sources mention his\ncommentary on the Physics, translated partly by Ibn\nNaʿima al-Himsi and partly by Qusta ibn\n Luqa.[45]\nAlso, fragments of an adapted\ntranslation of parts of the De Aeternitate mundi were\n known[46]\nunder the name of Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(Hasnaoui 1994; Giannakis 2002–3; Gannagé 2012, 535–7). \n\nOlympiodorus. A commentary on the De Gen.\ncorr., lost in Greek, is said to have been translated by\n Ustath.[47] \n\nIn addition to these works, translated within the circle of\nal-Kindi, two doxographies were translated into Arabic in this period:\nthe Placita of the pseudo-Plutarch, accounting for Greek\ncosmologies from the Presocratics to the\n Stoics,[48]\nand the Refutation of all\nthe Heresies by Hyppolitus of Rome; the latter was reworked in \nlight of the theological discussions of the 9th century Baghdad and\nattributed to Ammonius, the Alexandrian commentator of\n Aristotle.[49] \n\nThanks to this first set of translations, learned Muslims\nbecame acquainted with Plato’s Demiurge and immortal soul; with\nAristotle’s search for science and knowledge of the causes of all\nthe phenomena on earth and in the heavens, culminating in the doctrine\nof the Unmoved Mover; with Alexander’s cosmology and explanation\nof providence; with Plotinus’ hierarchy of the principles One,\nIntellect and Soul; with Proclus’ systematic account of how the\nOne—indisputably identified with Aristotle’s Unmoved\nMover—gives rise to the multiplicity of our universe; finally,\nwith John Philoponus’ philosophical arguments for creation. The\ntranslation of Proclus’ arguments in favour of the eternity of\nthe cosmos against the Christians, as well as of John Philoponus’\nreply to them, also made learned Muslims acquainted with the fact that\nthe Greek philosophers were at odds on some crucial issues. The\nadaptations which appear in the reworking both of Plotinus’\nEnneads (D’Ancona 2006) and of Hyppolitus doxography\nattributed to Ammonius (Rudolph 1998) show the strategy to deal with\nthis problem typical of the circle of al-Kindi: a strategy which\nwould be successful in the long run. The idea of the basic unity of the\nGreek philosophical tradition and the twin claim of its intrinsic\nharmony with the Qur’anic doctrine of the tawhid (divine\noneness) will be established by the endorsment, apparent in\nKindi’s own works, of the Aristotelian model of the accumulation\nof knowledge by trial and error (Metaphysics, A and alpha\nelatton). \n\nAnother group of translators takes the floor a bit later: the one of\nthe Nestorian physician and scientist Hunayn ibn Ishaq (d. 873)\n(Bergsträsser 1913, 1925; Gabrieli 1924; Meyerhof 1926a, 1926b;\nHaddad 1974; Strohmaier 1990) his son Ishaq ibn Hunayn (d. 911), and\ntheir associates. In addition to the medical corpus of\n Galen,[50]\nthis group of\ntranslators made available in Syriac and/or in Arabic other works by\nPlato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, some philosophical writings by Galen,\nas well as works by Alexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry, perhaps\nIamblichus, Themistius, Proclus, and John Philoponus. \n\nPlato. The Arabic translation of the Timaeus made\nby Ibn al-Bitriq within the circle of al-Kindi was either corrected by\nHunayn ibn Ishaq, or superseded by the latter’s\n translation.[51]\nThe\nLaws were also translated by\n Hunayn,[52] but\nneither translation has\ncome down to us. Hunayn ibn Ishaq is credited also with an exegesis of\n the Republic.[53]\nTo his son Ishaq is attributed the\ntranslation of a dialogue which might be the Sophist, together\nwith a commentary, possibly by\n Olympiodorus.[54] \n\nAristotle. The K. al-Fihrist credits Hunayn ibn\nIshaq with the translation of the\n Categories.[55]\nHunayn also translated the\nDe Interpretatione into Syriac and Ishaq made the Arabic\ntranslation of\n it.[56]\nThe Prior Analytics were translated\ninto Syriac partly by Hunayn and partly by Ishaq, and into Arabic by a\ncertain\nTayadurus.[57]\nThe Posterior Analytics were\ntranslated into Syriac, partly by Hunayn and in their entirety\nby Ishaq.[58]\nThe latter also made a Syriac translation of the\n Topics,[59]\nbut the\ntranslation which has come down to us is the Arabic one, made by Abu\nʿUthman  al-Dimashqi[60]\n(books I–VII) and by Ibrahim ibn\nʿAbdallah (book\n VIII).[61]\nThe K. al-Fihrist tentatively\n attributes to Ishaq a translation of the\n Rhetoric,[62]\nbut the extant\nanonymous Arabic version does not bear the features of the translations\nof this period and has been ascribed to an earlier\n stage.[63]\nIshaq also\n translated the Physics into\n Arabic.[64]\nAs for the De Caelo,\nthe K. al-Fihrist mentions a revision made by Hunayn on Ibn\nal-Bitriq’s\n version.[65]\nHunayn is also the author of a compendium of\nthe Meteorologica (Daiber 1975). The De Generatione et\ncorruptione was translated into Syriac by Hunayn and into Arabic\nby Ishaq; two other translations are mentioned, by Abu ʿUthman\nal-Dimashqi and Ibn\n Bakkus.[66]\nAll the translations mentioned are lost,\nalthough not without having left some\n traces.[67]\nAs for the De Anima,\nin the K. al-Fihrist we are told that Hunayn translated it\ninto Syriac in its entirety, and that Ishaq made another partial\ntranslation, plus a complete translation into\n Arabic.[68]\nIshaq ibn\n Hunayn also retranslated (or revised) the\n Metaphysics.[69]\nHe is also\ncredited with the translation into Arabic of the Nicomachean\n Ethics.[70]\nIn addition to the genuine Aristotelian works, some spuria were also\ntranslated by\nHunayn\nand his associates: Hunayn\nhimself possibly translated the Problemata Physica (Filius\n2003, 593–98); also the compilation of the so-called De\nLapidibus has been ascribed to him (Zonta 2003, 652–54). Ishaq ibn\nHunayn made the Arabic version of the De Plantis (Drossaart\nLulofs-Poortman 1989; Hugonnard-Roche 2003b, 499–505), and Abu\nʿUthman al-Dimashqi is credited with the translation of the\n De Virtutibus et vitiis.[71] \n\nTheophrastus. The translation of\nthe Metaphysics is attributed to Ishaq ibn Hunayn in one of\nthe extant manuscripts, and linguistic analysis confirms this\nauthorship, even though the K. al-Fihrist attributes the\ntranslation to Yahya ibn \nʿAdi.[72] \n\nNicolaus Damascenus. His compilation On the Philosophy\nof Aristotle was translated into Syriac by Hunayn ibn Ishaq: the\nextant fragments from the first five books are extant and\n edited.[73]\nThe commentary\non the De Plantis too was translated by Hunayn ibn Ishaq\n(Drossaart-Lulofs 1965, 16). \n\nGalen. The compendium of Plato’s Timaeus has\nbeen translated into Syriac by Hunayn ibn Ishaq and from Syriac into\nArabic by Hunayn’s pupil ʿIsa ibn Yahya ibn Ibrahim: the\nArabic text has come down to us and forms volume I of the Plato\n Arabus.[74] \n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. (i) Commentaries. The commentary\nby Alexander on Book Lambda of the Metaphysics, lost\nin Greek together with the rest of Alexander’s commentary beyond\nbook Delta, is said to have been translated into Syriac by\nHunayn ibn\n Ishaq.[75]\nThe Arabic translation, based in all\nlikelihood on this Syriac version, is lost, but several extracts of it\nsurvive in Averroes’ commentary on the Metaphysics\n(Freudenthal 1885; Bouyges 1952, clxxviii-clxxix). (ii) Personal works.\nHunayn ibn Ishaq translated Qu. III 3 on sense-perception\n(Ruland 1978), and his son Ishaq in all likelihood is the translator of\n Alexander’s \nDe Anima.[76]\nTwo Arabic translations of the treatise\n On the Principles of the\n All[77]\nhave come down to us: one by Ishaq\nibn\n Hunayn[78]\nand\nthe other by Abu ʿUthman al-Dimashqi (Genequand 2001, 31–9; Genequand 2017, 14–16). Even\nmore important for the subsequent developments of falsafa was\nIshaq’s Arabic translation of the short treatise On\nIntellect (see Finnegan 1956; Badawi 1971, 31–42;\nGoulet-Aouad 1989, 134; Geoffroy 2002). \n\nPorphyry. The Isagoge, already known to some extent through\na compendium of Aristotelian logic ascribed to Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ, was translated by Abu\nʿUthman\n al-Dimashqi.[79]\nThis is the only writing by Porphyry whose Arabic translation is\nextant; other translations are mentioned in the bio-bibliographical\nsources or otherwise attested by Arab authors. These sources mention\nan Introduction to the Categorical Syllogisms translated by\nAbu ʿUthman\n al-Dimashqi.[80]\nA commentary on the Categories is recorded in the K.\n al-Fihrist[81]\nand served as a source for\nIbn\n Suwar’s[82]\n“edition” of Hunayn’s translation of the\nCategories (Elamrani Jamal 1989, 511). A commentary on the\nPhysics, lost in Greek, is also\n mentioned.[83]\nA translation of the commentary on the Nicomachean\nEthics, lost in\n Greek, is attributed to Ishaq ibn\n Hunayn.[84] \n\nIamblichus. The anonymous translation of a commentary on\nPythagoras’ Golden Verses attributed to Iamblichus\npossibly belongs to this\n period.[85] \n\nThemistius. Ishaq’s Arabic translation of the\nparaphrasis of the De Anima, mentioned in the\n bio-bibliographical \n sources,[86]\nis extant\nand edited (Lyons 1973; see also Browne 1986, 1998 and the overview by Elamrani Jamal 2003, 352–53). The Arabic\ntranslation of a Letter by Themistius On Government\nis attributed to Abu ʿUthman al-Dimashqi (Gutas 1975, 47). \n\nNemesius of Emesa. The De Natura hominis was\ntranslated into Arabic either by Ishaq or by his father Hunayn (see\nSamir 1986, Zonta 1991, Chase 2005). \n\nProclus. Ishaq retranslated the Eighteen\n Arguments on the Eternity of the Cosmos against the\n Christians.[87] \n\nJohn Philoponus. Even though there are no compelling reasons\nto ascribe it to the milieu of Hunayn, the translation of\nPhiloponus’ treatise Against Aristotle on the Eternity of the\n World[88]\nmight trace back to this\n period.[89] \n\nOlympiodorus. A paraphrasis of the Meteorologica\ntranslated by Hunayn ibn Ishaq and corrected by his son\n Ishaq (Badawi 1971, 13)\nhas been\ndiscovered and edited by ʿA. Badawi (Badawi 1971, 95–190). The\ntext, however, is very different from the one preserved in Greek\n(Schoonheim 2003, 326). \n\nTogether with the translations of the Galenic corpus, Hunayn,\nIshaq and other translators associated with them put at\nthe disposal of learned Muslims the Aristotelian corpus in its\nentirety. This enterprise paved the way to the understanding of\nAristotle’s thought as a systematic whole based on the theory of\ndemonstrative science and crowned by the Metaphysics, an\nunderstanding which is apparent both in al-Farabi and in\nAvicenna.[90]\nThe translation of Alexander’s treatises On the Principles of\nthe All and On Intellect helped to shape the metaphysical\ncosmology and noetics of Medieval Arabic philosophy. A hierarchy of\nseparate, intellectual substances is seen as striving towards\nAristotle’s Unmoved Mover, also called the “True One”\nby both al-Farabi and Avicenna, in a purely Neoplatonic and Kindian\nvein. In doing so, these separate substances imitate the motionless\ncausality of the First Principle by their eternal circular movement\n(Pines 1986; Martini Bonadeo 2004). This warrants the regularity of\nthe laws of nature in the sublunar world. The Agent Intellect also\nbelongs to this hierarchy of separate substances: the\n“light” shed by the Agent Intellect is seen as the\ncondition for the intellect that is a faculty of the human soul,\nnamely the potential intellect, to actually know the intelligibles\n(Walzer 1970). \n\nTowards the middle of the 10th century, another set of translations\ninto Arabic was produced by the Nestorian Christian Abu Bishr\nMatta ibn Yunus (d. 940) (Endress 1991a, Martini Bonadeo 2011a) and his pupils.\nAbu Bishr Matta\nreceived his Aristotelian\neducation at the monastery of Mar Mari and came to Baghdad, where in\nthe first decades of the 10th century he had al-Farabi, a Muslim, and\nYahya ibn ʿAdi, a Jacobite Christian, among his\n pupils.[91]\nHe did not know Greek\nand his translations were made on the basis of the Syriac translations\nalready\n extant.[92] \n\nPlato. Another translation of the Laws\nis attributed to Yahya ibn ʿAdi by the ancient\n sources.[93] \n\nAristotle. Abu Bishr Matta translated into Arabic the\nSyriac version of the Posterior Analytics made by Ishaq\nibn Hunayn[94]\n and the Syriac translation of the\n Poetics.[95]\nEven though he did not know Greek,\nthe ancient sources mention also a translation by him into\n Syriac (hence, from Greek) of the\n Sophistici Elenchi.[96]\nThe sources\nmention also a partial translation of the De Caelo by\n him,[97]\nas well as a\n translation of the De Generatione et \n corruptione.[98]\nAbu Bishr Matta\n also translated the De Sensu et\n sensato[99]\nand Book\nLambda of the Metaphysics, together with Alexander of\nAphrodisias’\n commentary.[100]\nTo his pupil\nYahya ibn ʿAdi—who was also a Christian theologian and the\nauthor of philosophical\n treatises[101]—is \nattributed the Arabic version of\nthe Syriac translation of the Topics made in the previous\ncentury by Ishaq ibn\n Hunayn.[102]\nYahya ibn ʿAdi is credited also with\nthe Arabic translation of the Sophistici Elenchi from the\nSyriac version of Theophilus of\n Edessa,[103]\nas well as with that of the\n Poetics.[104]\nOne of the Christian pupils of Yahya ibn\nʿAdi, Abu ʿAli ibn al-Samh, was the “editor” of\nthe ancient translation of the Rhetoric: it is this text which\nhas come down to\n us.[105]\nAbu ʿAli ibn Zurʿa, another\nChristian of this milieu, might have translated an Alexandrian\ncompendium of the Nicomachean Ethics known as Ikhtisar\nal-Iskandaraniyyin (Summa Alexandrinorum) (Dunlop 1982;\nZonta 2003, 197). The 10th century Baghdad Aristotelian Abu l-Faraj\nibn\n al-Tayyib[106]\ntranslated the pseudo-Aristotelian De Virtutibus et vitiis and\nDivisiones (ed. Kellermann-Rost 1965; see also Ferrari 2006, 30), and might be also the\ntranslator of the pseudo-Aristotelian Economics (Zonta 2003,\n549). \n\nTheophrastus. Ibn al-Nadim, whose information about\n Yahya ibn ʿAdi is first hand, maintains that the latter\n translated Theophrastus’ Metaphysics; however, in light\n of Ishaq’s authorship mentioned above, this claim has been\n interpreted as a revision of or an editorial work on Ishaq’s\n translation.[107] \n\nNicolaus of Damascus. Abu ʿAli ibn Zurʿa, a\nChristian philosopher of the circle of Yahya ibn ʿAdi, translated\ninto Arabic (in all likelihood from the Syriac version made in the\nprevious century by Hunayn ibn\n Ishaq[108])\nthe Compendium of Aristotle’s\n Philosophy.[109]\nThe same Abu ʿAli ibn Zurʿa\nbegan to translate Nicolaus’ compendium of the De\n Animalibus.[110] \n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias. (i) Commentaries.\nAbu Bishr Matta\ntranslated Alexander’s\ncommentary on the De Generatione et corruptione, lost in Greek\nbut partially preserved in\n Arabic,[111]\nas well as the commentary on the\n Meteorologica.[112]\nHe also made a partial translation of the\n commentary on the De Caelo.[113]\n(ii) Personal works. Abu Bishr Matta\n translated Alexander’s treatise On\n Providence[114]\n(which was also\nknown to the circle of al-Kindi [Fazzo-Wiesner 1993]). \n\nThemistius. Themistius’ paraphrasis of the\n Physics[115]\nwas known in the circle of Abu Bishr Matta\n(Endress 1977, 35) and some notes which trace back to it are\nreproduced in the Leiden manuscript mentioned above, which contains the text of the\nPhysics as it was studied in the Baghdad\n school.[116]\nIn this\nmilieu his paraphrasis of the De Caelo, lost in Greek, was\nalso\n translated (by Abu Bishr Matta) and revised (by Yahya ibn\n ʿAdi).[117]\nAbu Bishr Matta translated from Syriac into Arabic three other works: the paraphrasis\nof the Posterior Analytics, that of Book Lambda of the \nMetaphysics, and a writing connected with the\n Topics.[118] \n\nProclus. Two works by him were known to Yahya ibn\nʿAdi: the De Decem dubitationibus circa providentiam\n(Endress 1973, 30 and Endress 2012, 1668–9) and\nthe Elementatio Physica (Endress 1973, 27–28 and\nEndress 2012, 1661). \n\nSimplicius. The commentary on the Categories is\nmentioned in the bio-bibliographical\n sources[119]\nand was known to Ibn Suwar,\nthe “editor” of the so-called “Organon of\nBaghdad” (see Hugonnard-Roche 1993). \n\nOlympiodorus. Abu Bishr Matta translated into Arabic his\ncommentary on the Meteorologica, in all likelihood from the\nSyriac version made by Hunayn ibn\n Ishaq.[120]\nThe commentary on the\nDe Gen. corr., translated also by Ustath at the beginning of\nthe translation movement, was translated by Abu Bishr Matta and revised\nby Yahya ibn\n ʿAdi.[121]\nA commentary of his on the De Anima,\nunknown in Greek, is also mentioned as extant in\n Syriac.[122]\nFinally,\nan otherwise unknown “Allinus” who wrote a commentary on the\n Categories[123]\nmight be Elias, the pupil of Olympiodorus;\nhowever, other names have been advanced; a “book by\nAllinus” was translated by Ibn Suwar (Elamrani Jamal 1989,\n151–2; Martini Bonadeo 2011c). \n\nTypical of this period was the detailed exegesis of\nAristotle’s ipsissima verba made possible by the\ntranslations into Arabic of the old versions (often Syriac), as well as\nof the commentaries. Far away from Baghdad, Avicenna will argue time\nand again against the interpretations of Aristotle advanced\nwithin the context of the Baghdad school of philosophy (Pines 1952;\nGutas 2000). Nevertheless, he will continue to rely on the corpus of\nthe Greek sources made available in the previous centuries, not only in\nthe trivial sense of the access they provided to the Greek thought for\nan Arabic readership, but also in the less evident sense of the\nphilosophical agenda set by the thinkers who assimilated the Greek\nheritage. Together with the meticulous exegesis of the text of\nAristotle, the ideal of carrying on the search for the lore and science\nof the Ancients, taken as a whole, is a prominent feature of the\nphilosophical circles of this era, apparent both in the production of\ncollections like the Siwan al-hikma (The Repository of\n Wisdom)[124]\nand in the ideal of the attainment of\nhappiness through philosophy. \n\nThe attitude to the search for happiness in the intellectual life (see\nEndress 2014) and the endeavour to rely on the heritage of the\nAncients as a guidance in search of the “science of the things\nin their truth (ʿilm al-ashyaʿi\nbi-haqa’iqiha)” and personal achievement bridges the\ngap between the beginnings of falsafa in the age of al-Kindi\nand the developments of the Muslim West, when Averroes would conceive\nhis project of commenting upon the Aristotelian corpus (Endress 1998;\n2004).","contact.mail":"cristina.dancona@unipi.it","contact.domain":"unipi.it"}]
