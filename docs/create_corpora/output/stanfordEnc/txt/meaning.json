Unfortunately, this term has also been used to mean a great\nnumber of different things.  In this entry, the focus is on two sorts\nof “theory of meaning”. The first sort of theory—a\nsemantic theory—is a theory which assigns semantic contents to\nexpressions of a language. The second sort of theory—a\nfoundational theory of meaning—is a theory which states the\nfacts in virtue of which expressions have the semantic contents that\nthey have.  Following a brief introduction, these two kinds of theory\nare discussed in turn.\n\nIn “General Semantics”, David Lewis wrote \nI distinguish two topics: first, the description of possible languages\nor grammars as abstract semantic systems whereby symbols are\nassociated with aspects of the world; and, second, the description of\nthe psychological and sociological facts whereby a particular one of\nthese abstract semantic systems is the one used by a person or\npopulation. Only confusion comes of mixing these two topics. (Lewis\n1970: 19) \nLewis was right. Even if philosophers have not consistently kept these\ntwo questions separate, there clearly is a distinction between the\nquestions “What is the meaning of this or that symbol (for a\nparticular person or group)?” and “In virtue of what facts\nabout that person or group does the symbol have that\nmeaning?” \nCorresponding to these two questions are two different sorts of theory\nof meaning. One sort of theory of meaning—a semantic\ntheory—is a specification of the meanings of the words and\nsentences of some symbol system. Semantic theories thus answer the\nquestion, “What is the meaning of this or that\nexpression?” A distinct sort of theory—a foundational\ntheory of meaning—tries to explain what about some person\nor group gives the symbols of their language the meanings that they\nhave. To be sure, the shape of a correct semantic theory places\nconstraints on the correct foundational theory of meaning, and vice\nversa; but that does not change the fact that semantic theories and\nfoundational theories are simply different sorts of theories, designed\nto answer different questions. \nTo see the distinction between semantic theories and foundational\ntheories of meaning, it may help to consider an analogous one. Imagine\nan anthropologist specializing in table manners sent out to observe a\ndistant tribe. One task the anthropologist clearly might undertake is\nto simply describe the table manners of that tribe—to describe\nthe different categories into which members of the tribe place actions\nat the table, and to say which sorts of actions fall into which\ncategories. This would be analogous to the task of the philosopher of\nlanguage interested in semantics; her job is say what different sorts\nof meanings expressions of a given language have, and which\nexpressions have which meanings. \nBut our anthropologist might also become interested in the nature of\nmanners; he might wonder how, in general, one set of rules of table\nmanners comes to be the system of etiquette governing a particular\ngroup. Since presumably the fact that a group obeys one system of\netiquette rather than another is traceable to something about that\ngroup, the anthropologist might put his new question by asking,  \nIn virtue of what facts about a person or group does that person or\ngroup come to be governed by a particular system of etiquette, rather\nthan another?  \nOur anthropologist would then have embarked upon the analogue of the\nconstruction of a foundational theory of meaning: he would then be\ninterested, not in which etiquette-related properties particular\naction types have in a certain group, but rather the question of how\naction-types can, in any group, come to acquire properties of this\n sort.[1]\n Our anthropologist might well be interested in both sorts of\nquestions about table manners; but they are, pretty clearly, different\nquestions. Just so, semantic theories and foundational theories of\nmeaning are, pretty clearly, different sorts of theories. \nThe term “theory of meaning” has, in the recent history of\nphilosophy, been used to stand for both semantic theories and\nfoundational theories of meaning. As this has obvious potential to\nmislead, in what follows I’ll avoid the term which this article\nis meant to define and stick instead to the more specific\n“semantic theory” and “foundational theory of\nmeaning”. “Theory of meaning” simpliciter\ncan be understood as ambiguous between these two\ninterpretations. \nBefore turning to discussion of these two sorts of theories, it is\nworth noting that one prominent tradition in the philosophy of\nlanguage denies that there are facts about the meanings of linguistic\nexpressions. (See, for example, Quine 1960 and Kripke 1982; for\ncritical discussion, see Soames 1997.) If this sort of skepticism\nabout meaning is correct, then there is neither a true semantic theory\nnor a true foundational theory of meaning to be found, since the\nrelevant sort of facts simply are not around to be described or\nanalyzed. Discussion of these skeptical arguments is beyond the scope\nof this entry, so in what follows I’ll simply assume that\nskepticism about meaning is false. \nThe task of explaining the main approaches to semantic theory in\ncontemporary philosophy of language might seem to face an in-principle\nstumbling block. Given that no two languages have the same\nsemantics—no two languages are comprised of just the same words,\nwith just the same meanings—it may seem hard to see how we can\nsay anything about different views about semantics in general, as\nopposed to views about the semantics of this or that language. This\nproblem has a relatively straightforward solution. While it is of\ncourse correct that the semantics for English is one thing and the\nsemantics for French something else, most assume that the various\nnatural languages should all have semantic theories of (in a sense to\nbe explained) the same form. The aim of what follows will,\naccordingly, be to introduce the reader to the main approaches to\nnatural language semantics—the main views about the right form\nfor a semantics for a natural language to take—rather than to provide a\ndetailed examination of the various views about the semantics of some\nparticular expression. (For an overview, see the entry on\n word meaning.\n For discussion of issues involving particular expression types, see\nthe entries on\n names,\n quantifiers and quantification,\n descriptions,\n propositional attitude reports, and\n natural kinds.) \nOne caveat before we get started: before a semantic theorist sets off\nto explain the meanings of the expressions of some language, she needs\na clear idea of what she is supposed to explain the meaning\nof. This might not seem to present much of a problem;\naren’t the bearers of meaning just the sentences of the relevant\nlanguage, and their parts? This is correct as far as it goes. But the\ntask of explaining what the semantically significant parts of a\nsentence are, and how those parts combine to form the sentence, is as\ncomplex as semantics itself, and has important consequences for\nsemantic theory. Indeed, most disputes about the right semantic\ntreatment of some class of expressions are intertwined with questions\nabout the syntactic form of sentences in which those expressions\nfigure. Unfortunately, discussion of theories of this sort, which\nattempt to explain the syntax, or logical form, of natural language\nsentences, is well beyond the scope of this entry. As a result,\nfigures like Richard Montague, whose work on syntax and its connection\nto semantics has been central to the development of semantic theory\nover the past few decades, are passed over in what\nfollows. (Montague’s essays are collected in Montague 1974.) For\nan excellent introduction to the connections between syntax and\nsemantics, see Heim & Kratzer (1998); for an overview of the\nrelations between philosophy of language and several branches of\nlinguistics, see Moss (2012). \nThere are a wide variety of approaches to natural language semantics.\nMy strategy in what follows will be to begin by explaining one\nprominent family of approaches to semantics which developed over the\ncourse of the twentieth century and is still prominently represented\nin contemporary work in semantics, both in linguistics and in\nphilosophy. For lack of a better term, let's call these types of\nsemantic theories classical semantic theories. (As in\ndiscussions of classical logic, the appellation\n“classical” is not meant to suggest that theories to which\nthis label is applied are to be preferred over others.) Classical\nsemantic theories agree that sentences are (typically) true or false,\nand that whether they are true or false depends on what information\nthey encode or express. This “information” is often called\n“the proposition expressed by the sentence”. The job of a\nsemantic theory, according to the classical theorist, is at least in\nlarge part to explain how the meanings of the parts of the sentence,\nalong with the context in which the sentence is used, combine to\ndetermine which proposition the sentence expresses in that context\n(and hence also the truth conditions of the sentence, as used in that\ncontext). \nClassical semantic theories are discussed in\n §2.1.\nIn\n §§2.1.1–4\n the theoretical framework common to classical semantic\ntheories is explained; in\n §§2.1.5–7\nthe differences between three main versions of classical\nsemantic theories are explained. In\n §2.2\n there is a discussion of the alternatives to classical semantic theories. \n In \n §2.3\n few general concluding questions are discussed; these are questions\n semantic theorists face\nwhich are largely, though not completely, orthogonal to one’s\nview about the form which a semantic theory ought to take. \nThe easiest way to understand the various sorts of classical semantic\ntheories is by beginning with another sort of theory: a theory of\nreference. \nA theory of reference is a theory which pairs expressions with the\ncontribution those expressions make to the determination of the\ntruth-values of sentences in which they occur. (Though later we will\nsee that this view of the reference of an expression must be\nrestricted in certain ways.) \nThis construal of the theory of reference is traceable to\n Gottlob Frege’s\n attempt to formulate a logic sufficient for the formalization of\nmathematical inferences (see especially Frege 1879 and 1892.) The\nconstruction of a theory of reference of this kind is best illustrated\nby beginning with the example of proper names. Consider the following\nsentences: \n(1) is true, and (2) is false. Obviously, this difference in\ntruth-value is traceable to some difference between the expressions\n“Barack Obama” and “John McCain”. What about\nthese expressions explains the difference in truth-value between these\nsentences? It is very plausible that it is the fact that “Barack\nObama” stands for the man who was in fact the 44th president of\nthe United States, whereas “John McCain” stands for a man\nwho was not. This suggests that the reference of a proper\nname—its contribution to the determination of truth conditions\nof sentences in which it occurs—is the object for which that\nname stands. (While this is plausible, it is not uncontroversial that\nthe purpose of a name is to refer to an individual; see Graff Fara\n(2015) and Jeshion (2015) for arguments on opposite sides of this\nissue.) \nGiven this starting point, it is a short step to some conclusions\nabout the reference of other sorts of expressions. Consider the\nfollowing pair of sentences: \nAgain, the first of these is true, whereas the second is false. We\nalready know that the reference of “Barack Obama” is the\nman for which the name stands; so, given that reference is power to\naffect truth-value, we know that the reference of predicates\nlike “is a Democrat” and “is a Republican”\nmust be something which combines with an object to yield a\ntruth-value. Accordingly, it is natural to think of the reference of\npredicates of this sort as functions from objects to truth-values. The\nreference of “is a Democrat” is that function which\nreturns the truth-value “true” when given as input an\nobject which is a member of the Democratic party (and the truth-value\n“false” otherwise), whereas the reference of “is a\nRepublican” is a function which returns the truth-value\n“true” when given as input an object which is a member of\nthe Republican party (and the truth-value “false”\notherwise). This is what explains the fact that (3) is true and (4)\nfalse: Obama is a member of the Democratic party, and is not a member\nof the Republican party. \nMatters get more complicated, and more controversial, as we extend\nthis sort of theory of reference to cover more and more of the types\nof expressions we find in natural languages like English. (For an\nintroduction, see Heim and Kratzer (1998).) But the above is enough to\ngive a rough idea of how one might proceed. For example, some\npredicates, like “loves” combine with two names to form a\nsentence, rather than one. So the reference of two-place predicates of\nthis sort must be something which combines with a pair of objects to\ndetermine a truth-value—perhaps, that function from ordered\npairs of objects to truth-values which returns the truth-value\n“true” when given as input a pair of objects whose first\nmember loves the second member, and “false” otherwise. \nSo let’s suppose that we have a theory of reference for a\nlanguage, in the above sense. Would we then have a satisfactory\nsemantic theory for the language? \nSome plausible arguments indicate that we would not. To adopt an\nexample from Quine (1970 [1986], pp. 8–9), let’s assume\nthat the set of animals with hearts (which Quine, for convenience,\ncalls “cordates” – not to be confused with\n“chordates”) is the same as the set of animals with\nkidneys (which Quine calls “renates”). Now, consider the\npair of sentences: \nGiven our assumption, both sentences are true. Moreover, from the\npoint of view of the theory of reference, (5) and (6) are just the\nsame: they differ only in the substitution of “renates”\nfor “cordates”, and these expressions have the same\nreference (because they stand for the same function from objects to\ntruth-values). \nAll the same, there is clearly an intuitive difference in meaning\nbetween (5) and (6); the sentences seem, in some sense, to say\ndifferent things. The first seems to express the trivial, boring\nthought that every creature with a heart is a creature with a heart,\nwhereas the second expresses the non-trivial, potentially informative\nclaim that every creature with a heart also has a kidney. This\nsuggests that there is an important difference between (5) and (6)\nwhich our theory of reference simply fails to capture. \nExamples of the same sort can be generated using pairs of expressions\nof other types which share a reference, but intuitively differ in\nmeaning; for example, “Clark Kent” and\n“Superman”, or (an example famously discussed by Frege\n(1892 [1960]), “the Morning Star” and “the Evening\nStar”. \nThis might seem a rather weak argument for the incompleteness of the\ntheory of reference, resting as it does on intuitions about the\nrelative informativeness of sentences like (5) and (6). But this\nargument can be strengthened by embedding sentences like (5) and (6)\nin more complex sentences, as follows: \n(7) and (8) differ only with respect to the italic expressions and, as\nwe noted above, these expressions have the same reference. Despite\nthis, it seems clear that (7) and (8) could differ in truth-value:\nsomeone could know that all cordates have a heart without having any\nopinion on the question of whether all cordates have a kidney. But\nthat means that the references of expressions don’t even do the\njob for which they were introduced: they don’t explain the\ncontribution that expressions make to the determination of the\ntruth-value of all sentences in which they occur. (One might, of\ncourse, still think that the reference of an expression explains its\ncontribution to the determination of the truth-value of a suitably\ndelimited class of simple sentences in which the expression occurs.)\nIf we are to be able to explain, in terms of the properties of the\nexpressions that make them up, how (7) and (8) can differ in\ntruth-value, then expressions must have some other sort of value, some\nsort of meaning, which goes beyond reference. \n(7) and (8) are called belief ascriptions, for the obvious\nreason that they ascribe a belief to a subject. Belief ascriptions are\none sort of propositional attitude ascription—other\ntypes include ascriptions of knowledge, desire, or judgment. As will\nbecome clear in what follows, propositional attitude ascriptions have\nbeen very important in recent debates in semantics. One of the reasons\nwhy they have been important is exemplified by (7) and (8). Because\nthese sentences can differ in truth-value despite the fact that they\ndiffer only with respect to the italic words, and these words both\nshare a reference and occupy the same place in the structure of the\ntwo sentences, we say that (7) and (8) contain a non-extensional\ncontext: roughly, a “location” in the sentence which\nis such that substitution of terms which share a reference in that\nlocation can change truth-value. (They’re called\n“non-extensional contexts” because “extension”\nis another term for “reference”.) \nWe can give a similar argument for the incompleteness of the theory of\nreference based on the substitution of whole sentences. A theory of\nreference assigns to subsentential expressions values which explain\ntheir contribution to the truth-values of sentences; but to those\nsentences, it only assigns “true” or “false”.\nBut consider a pair of sentences like \nBecause both of the italic sentences are true, (9) and (10) are a pair\nof sentences which differ only with respect to substitution of\nexpressions (namely, the italic sentences) with the same reference.\nNonetheless, (9) and (10) could plainly differ in truth-value. \nThis seems to show that a semantic theory should assign some value to\nsentences other than a truth-value. Another route to this conclusion\nis the apparent truth of claims of the following sort: \nSentences like these seem to show that there are things which are the\nobjects of mental states like belief, the bearers of truth and falsity\nas well as modal properties like necessity and possibility and\nepistemic properties like a prioricity and posterioricity, and the\nthings expressed by sentences. What are these things? The theory of\nreference provides no answer. \nThese entities are often called propositions. Friends of\npropositions aim both to provide a theory of these entities, and, in\nso doing, also to solve the two problems for the theory of reference\ndiscussed above: (i) the lack of an explanation for the fact that\n (5)\n is trivial while\n (6)\n is not, and (ii) the fact (exemplified by\n (7)/(8)\n and\n (9)/(10))\n that sentences which differ only in the substitution of expressions\nwith the same reference can differ in truth-value. \nA theory of propositions thus does not abandon the theory of\nreference, as sketched above, but simply says that there is more to a\nsemantic theory than the theory of reference. Subsentential\nexpressions have, in addition to a reference, a content. The\ncontents of sentences—what sentences express—are known as\npropositions. \nThe natural next question is: What sorts of things are contents? Below\nI’ll discuss some of the leading answers to this question. But\nin advance of laying out any theory about what contents are, we can\nsay some general things about the role that contents are meant to\nplay. \nFirst, what is the relationship between content and reference?\nLet’s examine this question in connection with sentences; here\nit amounts to the question of the relationship between the proposition\na sentence expresses and the sentence’s truth-value. One point\nbrought out by the example of\n (9)\n and\n (10)\n is that two sentences can express different propositions while having\nthe same truth-value. After all, the beliefs ascribed to Mary by these\nsentences are different; so if propositions are the objects of belief,\nthe propositions corresponding to the italic sentences must be\ndifferent. Nonetheless, both sentences are true. \nIs the reverse possible? Can two sentences express the same\nproposition, but differ in truth-value? It seems not, as can be\nillustrated again by the role of propositions as the objects of\nbelief. Suppose that you and I believe the exact same thing—both\nof us believe the world to be just the same way. Can my belief be\ntrue, and yours false? Intuitively, it seems not; it seems incoherent\nto say that we both believe the world to be the same way, but that I\nget things right and you get them wrong. (Though see the discussion of\nrelativism in\n §2.3.2\n below for a dissenting view.) So it seems that if two sentences\nexpress the same proposition, they must have the same truth value. \nIn general, then, it seems plausible that two sentences with the same\ncontent—i.e., which express the same proposition—must\nalways have the same reference, though two expressions with the same\nreference can differ in content. This is the view stated by the\nFregean slogan that sense determines reference (“sense”\nbeing the conventional translation of Frege’s Sinn,\nwhich was his word for what we are calling “content”). \nIf this holds for sentences, does it also hold for subsentential\nexpressions? It seems that it must. Suppose for reductio that two\nsubsentential expressions, e and e*, have the same\ncontent but differ in reference. It seems plausible that two sentences\nwhich differ only by the substitution of expressions with the same\ncontent must have the same content. (While plausible, this principle\nis not uncontroversial; see entry on\n compositionality.)\n But if this is true, then sentences which differ only in the\nsubstitution of e and e* would have the same content.\nBut such a pair of sentences could differ in truth-value, since, for\nany pair of expressions which differ in reference, there is some pair\nof sentences which differ only by the substitution of those\nexpressions and differ in truth-value. So if there could be a pair of\nexpressions like e and e*, which differ in their\nreference but not in their content, there could be a pair of sentences\nwhich have the same content—which express the same\nproposition—but differ in truth-value. But this is what we\nargued above to be impossible; hence there could be no pair of\nexpressions like e and e*, and content must determine\nreference for subsentential expressions as well as sentences. \nThis result—that content determines reference—explains one\nthing we should, plausibly, want a semantic theory to do: it should\nassign to each expression some value—a content—which\ndetermines a reference for that expression. \nHowever, there is an obvious problem with the idea that we can assign\na content, in this sense, to all of the expressions of a language like\nEnglish: many expressions, like “I” or “here”,\nhave a different reference when uttered by different speakers in\ndifferent situations. So we plainly cannot assign to “I” a\nsingle content which determines a reference for the expression, since\nthe expression has a different reference in different situations.\nThese “situations” are typically called contexts of\nutterance, or just contexts, and expressions whose\nreference depends on the context are called\n indexicals (see entry)\n or context-dependent expressions. \nThe obvious existence of such expressions shows that a semantic theory\nmust do more than simply assign contents to every expression of the\nlanguage. Expressions like “I” must also be associated\nwith rules which determine the content of the expression, given a\ncontext of utterance. These rules, which are (or determine) functions\nfrom contexts to contents, are called characters. (The\nterminology here, as well as the view of the relationship between\ncontext, content, and reference, is due to Kaplan (1989).) So the\ncharacter of “I” must be some function from contexts to\ncontents which, in a context in which I am the speaker, delivers a\ncontent which determines me as reference; in a context in which Barack\nObama is the speaker, delivers a content which determines Barack Obama\nas reference; and so on. (See figure 1.)  \nFigure 1. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.] \nHere we face another potentially misleading ambiguity in\n“meaning”. What is the real meaning of an\nexpression—its character, or its content (in the relevant\ncontext)? The best answer here is a pluralist one. Expressions have\ncharacters which, given a context, determine a content. We can talk\nabout either character or content, and both are important. The\nimportant thing is to be clear on the distinction, and to see the\nreasons for thinking that expressions have both a character and\n(relative to a context) a content. \nHow many indexical expressions are there? There are some obvious\ncandidates—“I”, “here”,\n“now”, etc.—but beyond the obvious candidates, it is\nvery much a matter of dispute; for discussion, see\n §2.3.1\n below. \nBut there is a kind of argument which seems to show that almost every\nexpression is an indexical. Consider an expression which does not seem\nto be context-sensitive, like “the second-largest city in the\nUnited States”. This does not seem to be context-sensitive,\nbecause it seems to refer to the same city—Los\nAngeles—whether uttered by me, you, or some other English\nspeaker. But now consider a sentence like \nThis sentence is true. But for it to be true, “the\nsecond-largest city in the United States” would have to, in\n(11), refer to Chicago. But then it seems like this expression must be\nan indexical—its reference must depend on the context of\nutterance. In (11), the thought goes, the phrase “one hundred\nyears ago” shifts the context: in (11), “the\nsecond-largest city in the United States” refers to that city\nthat it would have referred to if uttered one hundred years ago. \nHowever, this can’t be quite right, as is shown by examples like\nthis one: \nLet’s suppose that this sentence, as uttered by me, is true.\nThen, if what we said about\n (11)\n was right, it seems that “I” must, in, (12), refer to\nwhoever it would refer to if it were uttered 100 years in the future.\nSo the one thing we know is that (assuming that (12) is true), it does\nnot refer to me—after all, I won’t be around to utter\nanything. But, plainly, the “I” in (12) does\nrefer to me when this sentence is uttered by me—after all, it is\na claim about me. What’s going on here? \nWhat examples like (12) are often taken to show is that the reference\nof an expression must be relativized, not just to a context of\nutterance, but also to a circumstance of\nevaluation—roughly, the possible state of the world\nrelevant to the determination of the truth or falsity of the sentence.\nIn the case of many simple sentences, context and circumstance\ncoincide; details aside, they both just are the state of the world at\nthe time of the utterance, with a designated speaker and place. But\nsentences like (12) show that they can come apart. Phrases like\n“In 100 years” shift the circumstance of\nevaluation—they change the state of the world relevant to the\nevaluation of the truth or falsity of the sentence—but\ndon’t change the context of utterance. That’s why when I\nutter (12), “I” refers to me—despite the fact that I\nwon’t exist to utter it in 100 years time. \nFigure 2. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.] \nThis is sometimes called the need for double-indexing\nsemantics—the two indices being contexts of utterance and\ncircumstances of evaluation. (See figure 2.) \nThe classic explanation of a double-indexing semantics is Kaplan\n(1989); another important early discussion is Kamp (1971). For a\ndifferent interpretation of the framework, see David Lewis (1980). For\na classic discussion of some of the philosophical issues raised by\nindexicals, see Perry (1979). \nDouble-indexing explains how we can regard the reference of “the\nsecond-largest city in the United States” in\n (11)\n to be Chicago, without taking “the second-largest city in the\nUnited States” to be an indexical like “I”. On this\nview, “the second-largest city in the United States” does\nnot vary in content depending on the context of utterance; rather, the\ncontent of this phrase is such that it determines a different\nreference with respect to different circumstances of evaluation. In\nparticular, it has Los Angeles as its reference with respect to the\npresent state of the actual world, and has Chicago as its reference\nwith respect to the state of actual world 100 years\n ago.[2]\n Because “the second-largest city in the United States”\nrefers to different things with respect to different circumstances, it\nis not a\n rigid designator (see entry)—these\n being expressions which (relative to a context of utterance) refer to\nthe same object with respect to every circumstance of evaluation at\nwhich that object exists, and never refer to anything else with\nrespect to another circumstance of evaluation. (The term “rigid\ndesignator” is due to Kripke [1972].) \n(Note that this particular example assumes the highly controversial\nview that circumstances of evaluation include, not just possible\nworlds, but also times. For a discussion of different views about the\nnature of circumstances of evaluation and their motivations, see\n §2.3.2\n below.) \nSo we know that expressions are associated with characters, which are\nfunctions from contexts to contents; and we know that contents are\nthings which, for each circumstance of evaluation, determine a\nreference. We can now raise a central question of (classical) semantic\ntheories: what sorts of things are contents? The foregoing suggests a\npleasingly minimalist answer to this question: perhaps, since contents\nare things which together with circumstances of evaluation determine a\nreference, contents just are functions from circumstances of\nevaluation to a reference. \nThis view sounds abstract but is, in a way, quite intuitive. The idea\nis that the meaning of an expression is not what the expression stands\nfor in the relevant circumstance, but rather a rule which tells you\nwhat the expression would stand for if the world were a certain way.\nSo, on this view, the content of an expression like “the tallest\nman in the world” is not simply the man who happens to be\ntallest, but rather a function from ways the world might be to\nmen—namely, that function which, for any way the world might be,\nreturns as a referent the tallest man in that world (if there is one,\nand nothing otherwise). This fits nicely with the intuitive idea that\nto understand such an expression one needn’t know what the\nexpression actually refers to—after all, one can understand\n“the tallest man” without knowing who the tallest man\nis—but must know how to tell what the expression would refer to,\ngiven certain information about the world (namely, the heights of all\nthe men in it). \nThese functions, or rules, are called (following Carnap (1947))\nintensions. Possible worlds semantics is the view that contents are\nintensions (and hence that characters are functions from contexts to\nintensions, i.e. functions from contexts to functions from\ncircumstances of evaluation to a reference). (See figure 3.) \nFigure 3. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.] \nFor discussion of the application of the framework of possible world\nsemantics to natural language, see David Lewis (1970). The intension\nof a sentence—i.e., the proposition that sentence expresses, on\nthe present view—will then be a function from worlds to\ntruth-values. In particular, it will be that function which returns\nthe truth-value true for every world with respect to which that\nsentence is true, and false otherwise. The intension of a simple\npredicate like “is red” will be a function from worlds to\nthe function from objects to truth-values which, for each world,\nreturns the truth-value true if the thing in question is red, and\nreturns the truth-value false otherwise. In effect, possible worlds\nsemantics takes the meanings of expressions to be functions from\nworlds to the values which would be assigned by a theory of reference\nto those expressions at the relevant world: in that sense, intensions\nare a kind of “extra layer” on top of the theory of\nreference. \nThis extra layer promises to solve the problem posed by\nnon-extensional contexts, as illustrated by the example of\n“cordate” and “renate” in\n (7) and (8).\n Our worry was that, since these expressions have the same reference,\nif meaning just is reference, then it seems that any pair of sentences\nwhich differ only in the substitution of these expressions must have\nthe same truth-value. But (7) and (8) are such a pair of sentences,\nand needn’t have the same truth-value. The proponent of possible\nworlds semantics solves this problem by identifying the meaning of\nthese expressions with their intension rather than their reference,\nand by pointing out that “cordate” and\n“renate”, while they share a reference, seem to have\ndifferent intensions. After all, even if in our world every creature\nwith a heart is a creature with a kidney (and vice versa), it seems\nthat the world could have been such that some creatures had a heart\nbut not a kidney. Since with respect to that circumstance of\nevaluation the terms will differ in reference, their\nintensions—which are just functions from circumstances of\nevaluations to referents—must also differ. Hence possible worlds\nsemantics leaves room for (7) and (8) to differ in truth value, as\nthey manifestly can. \nThe central problem facing possible worlds semantics, however,\nconcerns sentences of the same form as\n (7) and (8):\n sentences which ascribe propositional attitudes, like beliefs, to\nsubjects. To see this problem, we can begin by asking: according to\npossible worlds semantics, what does it take for a pair of sentences\nto have the same content (i.e., express the same proposition)? Since\ncontents are intensions, and intensions are functions from\ncircumstances of evaluation to referents, it seems that two sentences\nhave the same content, according to possible worlds semantics, if they\nhave the same truth-value with respect to every circumstance of\nevaluation. In other words, two sentences express the same proposition\nif and only if it is impossible for them to differ in truth-value. \nThe problem is that there are sentences which have the same\ntruth-value in every circumstance of evaluation, but seem to differ in\nmeaning. Consider, for example \n(13) and (14) are are both, like other truths of mathematics,\nnecessary truths. Hence (13) and (14) have the same intension and,\naccording to possible worlds semantics, must have the same\ncontent. \nBut this is highly counterintuitive. (13) and (14) certainly seem to\nsay different things. The problem (just as with\n (5) and (6))\n can be sharpened by embedding these sentences in propositional\nattitude ascriptions: \nAs we have just seen, the proponent of possible worlds semantics must\ntake the italic sentences, (13) and (14), to have the same content;\nhence, it seems, the proponent of possible worlds semantics must take\n(15) and (16) to be a pair of sentences which differ only in the\nsubstitution of expressions with the same content. But then it seems\nthat the proponent of possible worlds semantics must take this pair of\nsentences to express the same proposition, and have the same\ntruth-value; but (15) and (16) (like\n (7) and (8))\n seem to differ in truth-value, and hence seem not to express the same\nproposition. For an influential extension of this argument, see Soames\n(1988). \nFor attempts to reply to the argument from within the framework of\npossible worlds semantics, see among other places Stalnaker (1984) and\nYalcin (2018); for\ndiscussion of a related approach to semantics which aims to avoid\nthese problems, see\n situations in natural language semantics (see entry).\n Another option is to invoke impossible as well as possible worlds;\none might then treat propositions as sets of worlds, which may or may\nnot be possible. If there is an impossible world in which there are\nonly finitely many primes but in which 2+2=4, that would promise to\ngive us the resources to distinguish between the set of worlds in\nwhich\n (13)\n is true and the set of worlds in which\n (14)\n is true, and hence to explain the difference in truth-value between\n (15) and (16).\n For an overview of issues involving impossible worlds, see Nolan\n(2013). \nWhat we need, then, is an approach to semantics which can explain how\nsentences like\n (13) and (14),\n and hence also\n (15) and (16),\n can express different propositions. That is, we need a view of\npropositions which makes room for the possibility that a pair of\nsentences can be true in just the same circumstances but nonetheless\nhave genuinely different contents. \nA natural thought is that\n (13) and (14)\n have different contents because they are about different things; for\nexample,\n (14)\n makes a general claim about the set of prime numbers whereas\n (13)\n is about the relationship between the numbers 2 and 4. One might want\nour semantic theory to be sensitive to such differences: to count two\nsentences as expressing different propositions if they are have\ndifferent subject matters, in this sense. One way to secure this\nresult is to think of the contents of subsentential expressions as\ncomponents of the proposition expressed by the sentence as a whole.\nDifferences in the contents of subsentential expressions would then be\nsufficient for differences in the content of the sentence as a whole;\nso, for example, since (14) but not (13) contains an expression which\nrefers to prime numbers, these sentences will express different\npropositions. \nProponents of this sort of view think of propositions as\nstructured: as having constituents which include the meanings\nof the expressions which make up the sentence expressing the relevant\nproposition. (See, for more discussion, the entry on\n structured propositions.)\n One important question for views of this sort is: what does it mean\nfor an abstract object, like a proposition, to be structured, and have\nconstituents? But this question would take us too far afield into\nmetaphysics (see\n §2.3.3\n below for a brief discussion). The fundamental semantic\nquestion for proponents of this sort of structured proposition view\nis: what sorts of things are the constituents of propositions? \nThe answer to this question given by a proponent of Russellian\npropositions is: objects, properties, relations, and functions.\n(The view is called “Russellianism” because of its\nresemblance to the view of content defended in Chapter IV of Russell\n1903.) So described, Russellianism is a general view about what sorts\nof things the constituents of propositions are, and does not carry a\ncommitment to any views about the contents of particular types of\nexpressions. However, most Russellians also endorse a particular view\nabout the contents of proper names which is known as\nMillianism: the view that the meaning of a simple proper name\nis the object (if any) for which it stands. \nRussellianism has much to be said for it. It not only solves the\nproblems with possible worlds semantics discussed above, but fits well\nwith the intuitive idea that the function of names is to single out\nobjects, and the function of predicates is to (what else?) predicate\nproperties of those objects. \nHowever, Millian-Russellian semantic theories also face some problems.\nSome of these are metaphysical in nature, and are based on the premise\nthat propositions which have objects among their constituents cannot\nexist in circumstances in which those objects do not exist. (For\ndiscussion, see the entry on\n singular propositions.)\n Of the semantic objections to Millian-Russellian semantics, two are\nespecially important. \nThe first of these problems involves the existence of empty\nnames: names which have no referent. It is a commonplace that\nthere are such names; an example is “Vulcan”, the name\nintroduced for the planet between Mercury and the sun which was\ncausing perturbations in the orbit of Mercury. Because the\nMillian-Russellian says that the content of a name is its referent,\nthe Millian-Russellian seems forced into saying that empty names lack\na content. But this is surprising; it seems that we can use empty\nnames in sentences to express propositions and form beliefs about the\nworld. The Millian-Russellian owes some explanation of how this is\npossible, if such names genuinely lack a content. An excellent\ndiscussion of this problem from a Millian point of view is provided in\nBraun (1993). \nPerhaps the most important problem facing Millian-Russellian views,\nthough, is Frege’s puzzle. Consider the sentences \nAccording to the Millian-Russellian, (17) and (18) differ only in the\nsubstitution of expressions with have the same content: after all,\n“Clark Kent” and “Superman” are proper names\nwhich refer to the same object, and the Millian-Russellian holds that\nthe content of a proper name is the object to which that name refers.\nBut this is a surprising result. These sentences seem to differ in\nmeaning, because (17) seems to express a trivial, obvious claim,\nwhereas (18) seems to express a non-trivial, potentially informative\nclaim. \nThis sort of objection to Millian-Russellian views can (as above) be\nstrengthened by embedding the intuitively different sentences in\npropositional attitude ascriptions, as follows: \nThe problem posed by (19) and (20) for Russellian semantics is\nanalogous to the problem posed by\n (15) and (16)\n for possible worlds semantics. Here, as there, we have a pair of\nbelief ascriptions which seem as though they could differ in\ntruth-value despite the fact that these sentences differ only with\nrespect to expressions counted as synonymous by the relevant semantic\ntheory. \nRussellians have offered a variety of responses to Frege’s\npuzzle. Many Russellians think that our intuition that sentences like\n (19)\n and\n (20)\n can differ in truth-value is based on a mistake. This mistake might\nbe explained at least partly in terms of a confusion between the\nproposition semantically expressed by a sentence in a context and the\npropositions speakers would typically use that sentence to\npragmatically convey (Salmon 1986; Soames 2002), or in terms of the\nfact that a single proposition may be believed under several\n“propositional guises” (again, see Salmon 1986), or in\nterms of a failure to integrate pieces of information stored using\ndistinct mental representations (Braun & Saul\n 2002).[3]\n Alternatively, a Russellian might try to make room for (19) and (20)\nto genuinely differ in truth-value by giving up the idea that\nsentences which differ only in the substitution of proper names with\nthe same content must express the same proposition (Taschek 1995, Fine\n2007). \nHowever, these are not the only responses to Frege’s puzzle.\nJust as the Russellian responded to the problem posed by\n (15) and (16)\n by holding that two sentences with the same intension can differ in\nmeaning, one might respond to the problem posed by\n (19)\n and\n (20)\n by holding that two names which refer to the same object can differ\nin meaning, thus making room for (19) and (20) to differ in\ntruth-value. This is to endorse a Fregean response to Frege’s\npuzzle, and to abandon the Russellian approach to semantics (or, at\nleast, to abandon Millian-Russellian semantics). \nFregeans, like Russellians, think of the proposition expressed by a\nsentence as a structured entity with constituents which are the\ncontents of the expressions making up the sentence. But Fregeans,\nunlike Russellians, do not think of these propositional constituents\nas the objects, properties, and relations for which these expressions\nstand; instead, Fregeans think of the contents as modes of\npresentation, or ways of thinking about, objects, properties, and\nrelations. The standard term for these modes of presentation is\nsense. (As with “intension”, “sense”\nis sometimes also used as a synonym for “content”. But, as\nwith “intension”, it avoids confusion to restrict\n“sense” for “content, as construed by Fregean\nsemantics”. It is then controversial whether there are such\nthings as senses, and whether they are the contents of expressions.)\nFrege explained his view of senses with an analogy: \nThe reference of a proper name is the object itself which we designate\nby its means; the idea, which we have in that case, is wholly\nsubjective; in between lies the sense, which is indeed no longer\nsubjective like the idea, but is yet not the object itself. The\nfollowing analogy will perhaps clarify these relationships. Somebody\nobserves the Moon through a telescope. I compare the Moon itself to\nthe reference; it is the object of the observation, mediated by the\nreal image projected by the object glass in the interior of the\ntelescope, and by the retinal image of the observer. The former I\ncompare to the sense, the latter is like the idea or experience. The\noptical image in the telescope is indeed one-sided and dependent upon\nthe standpoint of observation; but it is still objective, inasmuch as\nit can be used by several observers. At any rate it could be arranged\nfor several to use it simultaneously. But each one would have his own\nretinal image. (Frege 1892 [1960]) \nSenses are then objective, in that more than one person can express\nthoughts with a given sense, and correspond many-one to objects. Thus,\njust as Russellian propositions correspond many-one to intensions,\nFregean propositions correspond many-one to Russellian propositions.\nThis is sometimes expressed by the claim that Fregean contents are\nmore fine-grained than Russellian contents (or\nintensions). \nIndeed, we can think of our three classical semantic theories, along\nwith the theory of reference, as related by this kind of many-one\nrelation, as illustrated by the chart below: \nFigure 4. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.] \nThe principal argument for Fregean semantics (which also motivated\nFrege himself) is the neat solution the view offers to Frege’s\npuzzle: the view says that, in cases like\n (19)\n and\n (20)\n in which there seems to be a difference in content, there really is a\ndifference in content: the names share a reference, but differ in\ntheir sense, because they differ in their mode of presentation of\ntheir shared reference. \nThe principal challenge for Fregeanism is the challenge of giving a\nnon-metaphorical explanation of the nature of sense. This is a problem\nfor the Fregean in a way that it is not for the possible worlds\nsemanticist or the Russellian since the Fregean, unlike these two,\nintroduces a new class of entities to serve as meanings of expressions\nrather than merely appropriating an already recognized sort of\nentity—like a function, or an object, property, or\nrelation—to serve this\n purpose.[4] \nA first step toward answering this challenge is provided by a\ncriterion for telling when two expressions differ in meaning, which\nmight be stated as follows. In his 1906 paper, “A Brief Survey\nof My Logical Doctrines”, Frege seems to endorse the following\ncriterion: \nOne worry about this formulation concerns the apparent existence of\npairs of sentences, like “If Obama exists, then\nObama=Obama” and “If McCain exists, McCain=McCain”\nwhich are such that any rational person who understands both will take\nboth to be true. These sentences seem intuitively to differ in\ncontent—but this is ruled out by the criterion above. One idea\nfor getting around this problem would be to state our criterion of\ndifference for senses of expressions in terms of differences which\nresult from substituting one expression for another: \nThis version of the criterion has Frege’s formulation as a\nspecial case, since sentences are, of course, expressions; and it\nsolves the problem with obvious truths, since it seems that\nsubstitution of sentences of this sort can change the truth value of a\npropositional attitude ascription. Furthermore, the criterion delivers\nthe wanted result that coreferential names like “Superman”\nand “Clark Kent” differ in sense, since a rational,\nreflective agent like Lois Lane could think that\n (17)\n is true while withholding assent from\n (18). \nBut even if this tells us when names differ in sense, it does not\nquite tell us what the sense of a name is. Here is one\ninitially plausible way of explaining what the sense of a name is. We\nknow that, whatever the content of a name is, it must be something\nwhich determines as a reference the object for which the name stands;\nand we know that, if Fregeanism is true, this must be something other\nthan the object itself. A natural thought, then, is that the content\nof a name—its sense—is some condition which the referent\nof the name uniquely satisfies. Coreferential names can differ in\nsense because there is always more than one condition which a given\nobject uniquely satisfies. (For example, Superman/Clark Kent uniquely\nsatisfies both the condition of being the superhero Lois most admires,\nand the newspaperman she least admires.) Given this view, it is\nnatural to then hold that names have the same meanings as definite\ndescriptions—phrases of the form “the\nso-and-so”. After all, phrases of this sort seem to be designed\nto pick out the unique object, if any, which satisfies the condition\nfollowing the “the”. (For more discussion, see entry on\n descriptions.)\n This Fregean view of names is called Fregean\ndescriptivism. \nHowever, as Saul Kripke argued in Naming and Necessity,\nFregean descriptivism faces some serious problems. Here is one of the\narguments he gave against the view, which is called the modal\nargument. Consider a name like “Aristotle”, and\nsuppose for purposes of exposition that the sense I associate with\nthat name is the sense of the definite description “the greatest\nphilosopher of antiquity”. Now consider the following pair of\nsentences: \nIf Fregean descriptivism is true, and “the greatest philosopher\nof antiquity” is indeed the description I associate with the\nname “Aristotle”, then it seems that (21) and (22) must be\na pair of sentences which differ only via the substitution of\nexpressions (the italic ones) with the same content. If this is right,\nthen (21) and (22) must express the same proposition, and have the\nsame truth-value. But this seems to be a mistake; while (21) appears\nto be true (Aristotle could hardly have failed to be himself), (22)\nappears to be false (perhaps Aristotle could have been a shoemaker\nrather than a philosopher; or perhaps if Plato had worked a bit\nharder, he rather than Aristotle could have been the greatest\nphilosopher of antiquity). \nAn important precursor to Kripke’s arguments against Fregean\ndescriptivism is Marcus (1961), which argues that names are\n“tags” for objects rather than abbreviated descriptions.\nFregean descriptivists have given various replies to Kripke’s\nmodal and other arguments; see especially Plantinga (1978), Dummett\n(1981), and Sosa (2001). For rejoinders to these Fregean replies, see\nSoames (1998, 2002) and Caplan (2005). For a defense of a view of\ndescriptions which promises a reply to the modal argument, see\nRothschild (2007). For a brief sketch of Kripke’s other\narguments against Fregean descriptivism, see\n names, §2.4. \nKripke’s arguments provide a strong reason for Fregeans to deny\nFregean descriptivism, and hold instead that the senses of proper\nnames are not the senses of any definite description associated with\nthose names by speakers. The main problem for this sort of\nnon-descriptive Fregeanism is to explain what the sense of a\nname might be such that it can determine the reference of the name, if\nit is not a condition uniquely satisfied by the reference of the name.\nNon-descriptive Fregean views were defended in McDowell (1977) and\nEvans (1981). The most sophisticated and well-developed version of the\nview is a kind of blend of Fregean semantics and possible worlds\nsemantics. This is the epistemic two-dimensionalist approach to\nsemantics which has been developed by David Chalmers. See Chalmers\n(2004,2006). \nThree other problems for Fregean semantics are worth mentioning. The\nfirst is the problem of whether the Fregean can give an adequate\ntreatment of indexical expressions. A classic argument that the\nFregean cannot is given in Perry (1977); for a Fregean reply, see\nEvans (1981). \nThe first calls into question the Fregean’s claim to have\nprovided a plausible solution to Frege’s puzzle. The Fregean\nresolves instances of Frege’s puzzle by positing differences in\nsense to explain apparent differences in truth-value. But this sort of\nsolution, if pursued generally, seems to lead to the surprising result\nthat no two expressions can have the same content. For consider a pair\nof expressions which really do seem to have the same content, like\n“catsup” and “ketchup”. (The example, as well\nas the argument to follow, is borrowed from Salmon 1990.) Now consider\nBob, a confused condiment user, who thinks that the tasty red\nsubstance standardly labeled “catsup” is distinct from the\ntasty red substance standardly labeled “ketchup”, and\nconsider the following pair of sentences: \n(23) and (24) seem quite a bit like\n (19)\n and\n (20):\n these each seem to be pairs of sentences which differ in truth-value,\ndespite differing only in the substitution of the italic expressions.\nSo, for consistency, it seems that the Fregean should explain the\napparent difference in truth-value between (23) and (24) in just the\nway he explains the apparent difference in truth-value between (19)\nand (20): by positing a difference in meaning between the italic\nexpressions. But, first, it is hard to see how expressions like\n“catsup” and “ketchup” could differ in\nmeaning; and, second, it seems that an example of this sort could be\ngenerated for any alleged pair of synonymous expressions. (A closely\nrelated series of examples is developed in much more detail in Kripke\n1979.) \nThe example of “catsup” and “ketchup” is\nrelated to a second worry for the Fregean, which is the reverse of the\nFregean’s complaint about Russellian semantics: a plausible case\ncan be made that Frege’s criterion of difference for sense\nslices contents too finely, and draws distinctions in content where\nthere are none. One way of developing this sort of argument involves\n(again) propositional attitude ascriptions. It seems plausible that if\nI utter a sentence like “Hammurabi thought that Hesperus was\nvisible only in the morning”, what I say is true if and only if\none of Hammurabi’s thoughts has the same content as does the\nsentence “Hesperus was visible only in the morning”, as\nused by me. On a Russellian view, this places a reasonable constraint\non the truth of the ascription; it requires only that Hammurabi\nbelieve of a certain object that it instantiates the property of being\nvisible in the morning. But on a Fregean view, this sort of view of\nattitude ascriptions would require that Hammurabi thought of the\nplanet Venus under the same mode of presentation as I attach to the\nterm “Hesperus”. This seems implausible, since it seems\nthat I can truly report Hammurabi’s beliefs without knowing\nanything about the mode of presentation under which he thought of the\nplanets. (For a recent attempt to develop a Fregean semantics for\npropositional attitude ascriptions which avoids this sort of problem\nby integrating aspects of a Russellian semantics, see Chalmers\n(2011).) \nClassical semantic theories, however, are not the only game in town.\nThis section lays out the basics of five alternatives to classical semantic\ntheorizing. \nOne kind of challenge to classical semantics attacks the idea that the\njob of a semantic theory is to systematically pair expressions with\nthe entities which are their meanings. Wittgenstein was parodying just\nthis idea when he wrote  \nYou say: the point isn’t the word, but its meaning, and you\nthink of the meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, though\nalso different from the word. Here the word, there the meaning. The\nmoney, and the cow that you can buy with it. (Wittgenstein 1953,\n§120) \nWhile Wittgenstein himself did not think that systematic theorizing\nabout semantics was possible, this anti-theoretical stance has not\nbeen shared by all subsequent philosophers who share his aversion to\n“meanings as entities”. A case in point is Donald\nDavidson. Davidson thought that semantic theory should take the form\nof a theory of truth for the language of the sort which Alfred Tarski\nshowed us how to construct (see Tarski 1944 and entry on\n Tarski’s truth definitions). \nFor our purposes, it will be convenient to think of a Tarskian truth\ntheory as a variant on the sorts of theories of reference introduced\nin\n §2.1.1.\n Recall that theories of reference of this sort specified, for each\nproper name in the language, the object to which that name refers, and\nfor every simple predicate in the language, the set of things which\nsatisfy that predicate. If we then consider a sentence which combines\na proper name with such a predicate, like \nAmelia sings \nthe theory tells us what it would take for that sentence to be true:\nit tells us that this sentence is true if and only if the object to\nwhich “Amelia” refers is a member of the set of things\nwhich satisfy the predicate “sings”—i.e., the set of\nthings which sing. So we can think of a full theory of reference for\nthe language as implying, for each sentence of this sort, a\nT-sentence of the form \n“Amelia sings” is T (in the language) if and only\nif Amelia sings. \nSuppose now that we expand our theory of reference so that it implies\na T-sentence of this sort for every sentence of the language, rather\nthan just for simple sentences which result from combining a name and\na monadic predicate. We would then have a Tarskian truth theory for\nour language. Tarski’s idea was that such a theory would define\na truth predicate (“T”) for the language; Davidson,\nby contrast, thought that we find in Tarskian truth theories\n“the sophisticated and powerful foundation of a competent theory\nof meaning” (Davidson 1967). \nThis claim is puzzling: why should a a theory which issues\nT-sentences, but makes no explicit claims about meaning or content,\ncount as a semantic theory? Davidson’s answer was that\nknowledge of such a theory would be sufficient to understand the\nlanguage. If Davidson were right about this, then he would have a\nplausible argument that a semantic theory could take this form. After\nall, it is plausible that someone who understands a language knows the\nmeanings of the expressions in the language; so, if knowledge of a\nTarskian truth theory for the language were sufficient to understand\nthe language, then knowledge of what that theory says would be\nsufficient to know all the facts about the meanings of expressions in\nthe language, in which case it seems that the theory would state all\nthe facts about the meanings of expressions in the language. \nOne advantage of this sort of approach to semantics is its parsimony:\nit makes no use of the intensions, Russellian propositions, or Fregean\nsenses assigned to expressions by the propositional semantic theories\ndiscussed above. Of course, as we saw above, these entities were\nintroduced to provide a satisfactory semantic treatment of various\nsorts of linguistic constructions, and one might well wonder whether\nit is possible to provide a Tarskian truth theory of the sort sketched\nabove for a natural language without making use of intensions,\nRussellian propositions, or Fregean senses. The Davidsonian program\nobviously requires that we be able to do this, but it is still very\nmuch a matter of controversy whether a truth theory of this sort can\nbe constructed. Discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this\nentry; one good way into this debate is through the debate about\nwhether the Davidsonian program can provide an adequate treatment of\npropositional attitude ascriptions. See the discussion of the\nparatactic account and interpreted logical forms in the entry on\n propositional attitude reports.\n (For Davidson’s initial treatment of attitude ascriptions, see\nDavidson 1968; for further discussion see, among other places, Burge\n1986; Schiffer 1987; Lepore and Loewer 1989; Larson and Ludlow 1993;\nSoames 2002.) \nLet’s set this aside, and assume that a Tarskian truth theory of\nthe relevant sort can be constructed, and ask whether, given this\nsupposition, this sort of theory would provide an adequate semantics.\nThere are two fundamental reasons for thinking that it would not, both\nof which are ultimately due to Foster (1976). Larson and\nSegal (1995) call these the extension problem and the\ninformation problem. \nThe extension problem stems from the fact that it is not enough for a\nsemantic theory whose theorems are T-sentences to yield true theorems;\nthe T-sentence \n“Snow is white” is T in English iff grass is\ngreen. \nis true, but tells us hardly anything about the meaning of “Snow\nis white”. Rather, we want a semantic theory to entail, for each\nsentence of the object language, exactly one interpretive\nT-sentence: a T-sentence such that the sentence used on its right-hand\nside gives the meaning of the sentence mentioned on its left-hand\nside. Our theory must entail at least one such T-sentence for\neach sentence in the object language because the aim is to give the\nmeaning of each sentence in the language; and it must entail no\nmore than one because, if the theory had as theorems more than\none T-sentence for a single sentence S of the object language,\nan agent who knew all the theorems of the theory would not yet\nunderstand S, since such an agent would not know which of the\nT-sentences which mention S was interpretive. \nThe problem is that it seems that any theory which implies at least\none T-sentence for every sentence of the language will also imply more\nthan one T-sentence for every sentence in the language. For any\nsentences p, q, if the theory entails a T-sentence \nS is T in L iff p, \nthen, since p is logically equivalent to \\(p \\amp \\nsim(q \\amp\n\\nsim q)\\), the theory will also entail the T-sentence \nS is T in L iff \\(p \\amp \\nsim(q \\amp \\nsim\nq)\\), \nwhich, if the first is interpretive, won’t be. But then the\ntheory will entail at least one non-interpretive T-sentence, and\nsomeone who knows the theory will not know which of the relevant\nsentences is interpretive and which not; such a person therefore would\nnot understand the language. \nThe information problem is that, even if our semantic theory entails\nall and only interpretive T-sentences, it is not the case that\nknowledge of what is said by these theorems would suffice for\nunderstanding the object language. For, it seems, I can know what is\nsaid by a series of interpretive T-sentences without knowing that they\nare interpretive. I may, for example, know what is said by the\ninterpretive T-sentence \n“Londres est jolie” is T in French iff London is\npretty \nbut still not know the meaning of the sentence mentioned on the\nleft-hand side of the T-sentence. The truth of what is said by this\nsentence, after all, is compatible with the sentence used on the\nright-hand side being materially equivalent to, but different in\nmeaning from, the sentence mentioned on the left. This seems to\nindicate that knowing what is said by a truth theory of the relevant\nkind is not, after all, sufficient for understanding a language. (For\nreplies to these criticisms, see Davidson (1976), Larson and Segal\n(1995) and Kölbel (2001); for criticism of these replies, see\nSoames (1992) and Ray (2014). For a reply to the latter, see\nKirk-Giannini and Lepore (2017).) \nThe Davidsonian, on one reading, diagnoses the mistake of classical\nsemantics in its commitment to a layer of content which goes beyond a\ntheory of reference. A different alternative to classical semantics\ndeparts even more radically from that tradition, by denying that\nmind-world reference relations should play any role in semantic\ntheorizing. \nThis view is sometimes called “internalist semantics” by\ncontrast with views which locate the semantic properties of\nexpressions in their relation to elements of the external world. This\ninternalist approach to semantics is associated with the work of Noam\nChomsky (see especially Chomsky 2000). \nIt is easy to say what this approach to semantics denies. The\ninternalist denies an assumption common to all of the approaches\ndiscussed so far: the assumption that in giving the content of an\nexpression, we are primarily specifying something about that\nexpression’s relation to things in the world which that\nexpression might be used to say things about. According to the\ninternalist, expressions as such don’t bear any semantically\ninteresting relations to things in the world; names don’t, for\nexample, refer to the objects with which one might take them\nto be associated; predicates don’t have extensions; sentences\ndon’t have truth conditions. On this sort of view, we can use\nsentences to say true or false things about the world, and can use\nnames to refer to things; but this is just one thing we can do with\nnames and sentences, and is not a claim about the meanings of those\nexpressions. \nSo what are meanings, on this view? The most developed answer to this\nquestion is given in Pietroski (2018), according to which\n“meanings are instructions for how to build concepts of a\nspecial sort” (2018: 36). By “concepts”, Pietroski\nmeans mental representations of a certain kind. So the meaning of an\nexpression is an instruction to form a certain sort of mental\nrepresentation. \nOn this kind of view, while concepts may have extensions, expressions\nof natural languages do not. So this approach rejects not just the\ndetails but the foundation of the classical approach to semantics\ndescribed above. \nOne way to motivate an approach of this kind focuses on the ubiquity\nof the phenomenon of polysemy in natural languages. As Pietroski says,\n \nWe can use “line” to speak of Euclidean lines, fishing\nlines, telephone lines, waiting lines, lines in faces, lines of\nthought, etc. We can use “door” to access a concept of\ncertain impenetrable objects, or a concept of certain spaces that can\nbe occupied by such objects. (2018: 5)  \nThe defender of the view that expressions have meanings which\ndetermine extensions seems forced to say that “line” and\n“door” are homophonous expressions, like\n“bank”. But that seems implausible; when one uses the\nexpressions “fishing line” and “line of\nthought” one seems to be using “line” in\nrecognizably the same sense. (This is a point of contrast with\nstandard examples of homophony, as when uses “bank” once\nto refer to a financial institution and then later to refer to the\nside of a river.) The internalist, by contrast, is not forced into\ntreating these as cases of homophony; he can say that the meaning of\n“line” is an instruction to fetch one of a family of\nconcepts. \nFor defenses and developments of internalist approaches to semantics,\nsee McGilvray (1998), Chomsky (2000), and Pietroski (2003, 2005,\n2018). \nInternalist semantics can be understood as denying that classical\nsemantic assumption that a semantic theory should assign truth\nconditions to sentences. Another alternative to classical semantics\ndoes not deny that assumption, but does deny that truth conditions\nshould play the fundamental role in semantics that classical semantics\ngive to them. \nThis alternative is inferentialist semantics. The difference between\nclassical and inferentialist semantics is nicely put by Robert\nBrandom: \nThe standard way [of classical semantics] is to assume that one has a\nprior grip on the notion of truth, and use it to explain what good\ninference consists in. … [I]nferentialist pragmatism reverses\nthis order of explanation … It starts with a practical\ndistinction between good and bad inferences, understood as a\ndistinction between appropriate and inappropriate doings, and goes on\nto understand talk about truth as talk about what is preserved by the\ngood moves. (Brandom 2000: 12) \nThe classical semanticist begins with certain language-world\nrepresentational relations, and uses these to explain the truth\nconditions of sentences; we can then go on to use these truth\nconditions to explain the difference between good and bad inferences.\nThe inferentialist, by contrast, begins with the distinction between\ngood and bad inferences, and tries to explain the representational\nrelations which the classical semanticist takes as (comparatively)\nbasic in inferentialist terms. (I say “comparatively\nbasic” because the classical semanticist might go on to provide\na reductive explanation of these representational relations, and the\ninferentialist might go on to provide a reductive explanation of the\ndistinction between good and bad inferences. \nAs Brandom also emphasizes, the divergence between the classical and\ninferentialist approaches to semantics arguably brings with it a\ndivergence on two other fundamental topics. \nThe first is the relative explanatory priority of the semantic\nproperties of sentences, on the one hand, and subsentential\nexpressions, on the other. It is natural for the classical semanticist\nto think that the representational relations between subsentential\nexpressions and their semantic contents can be explained independently\nof the representational properties of sentences (i.e., their truth\nconditions); the latter can thus be explained in terms of the former.\nFor the inferentialist, on the other hand, the semantic properties of\nsentences must come first, because inferential relations hold between\nsentences but not between subsentential expressions. (One cannot, for\nexample, infer one name from another.) So the inferentialist will not\nexplain the semantic properties of, for example, singular terms in\nterms of representational relations between those singular terms and\nitems in the world; rather, she will explain what is distinctive of\nsingular terms in terms of their role in certain kinds of inferences.\n(To see how this strategy might work, see Brandom 2000: Ch. 4.) \nThe second is the relative explanatory priority of the semantic\nproperties of individual sentences, on the one hand, and the semantic\nrelations between sentences on the other. The classical semanticist\ncan, so to speak, explain the meanings of sentences one by one; there\nis no difficulty in explaining the meaning of a sentence without\nmentioning other sentences. By contrast, according to the\ninferentialist, \nif the conceptual content expressed by each sentence or word is\nunderstood as essentially consisting in its inferential relations\n(broadly construed) or articulated by its inferential relations\n(narrowly construed), then one must grasp many such contents in order\nto grasp any. (Brandom 2000: 29) \nThis is sometimes called a holist approach to semantics. For\ndiscussions of the pros and cons of this kind of view, see the entry\non\n meaning holism. \nFor book length defenses of inferentialism, see Brandom (1994) and\nBrandom (2000). Important precursors include Wittgenstein (1953) and\nSellars (1968); see also the entries on\n Ludwig Wittgenstein\n and\n Wilfrid Sellars.\n For a classic objection to inferentialism, see Prior (1960). For a\ndiscussion of a prominent approach within the inferentialist\ntradition, see the entry on\n proof-theoretic semantics. \nIn laying out the various versions of classical semantics, we said a\nlot about sentences. By comparison, we said hardly anything about\nconversations, or discourses. This is no accident; classical\napproaches to semantics typically think of properties of conversations\nor discourses as explicable in terms of explanatorily prior semantic\nproperties of sentences (even if classical semanticists do often take\nthe semantic contents of sentences to be sensitive to features of the\ndiscourse in which they occur). \nDynamic semantics is, to a first approximation, an approach to\nsemantics which reverses these explanatory priorities. (The sorts of\nclassical theories sketched above are, by contrast, called\n“static” semantic theories.) On a dynamic approach, a\nsemantic theory does not aim primarily to deliver a pairing of\nsentences with propositions which then determine the sentence’s\ntruth conditions. Rather, according to these dynamic approaches to\nsemantics, the semantic values of sentences are rather “context\nchange potentials”—roughly, instructions for updating the\ncontext, or discourse. \nIn a dynamic context, many of the questions posed above about how best\nto understand the nature of semantic contents show up instead as\nquestions about how best to understand the nature of contexts and\ncontext change potentials. It is controversial not just whether a\ndynamic or static approach to semantics is likely to be more fruitful,\nbut also what exactly the distinction between dynamic and static\nsystems comes to. (For discussion of the latter question, see\nRothschild & Yalcin 2016.) \nThe relationship between dynamic semantics and classical semantics is\ndifferent than the relationship between the latter and the other\nalternatives to classical semantics that I’ve discussed. The\nother alternatives to classical semantics reject some core feature of\nclassical semantics—for example, the assignments of entities as\nmeanings, or the idea that meaning centrally involves word-world\nrelations. By contrast, dynamic semantics can be thought of as a kind\nof extension or generalization of classical semantics, which can\nemploy modified versions of much of the same theoretical\nmachinery. \nFoundational works in this tradition include Irene Heim’s file\nchange semantics (1982)\nand Hans Kamp’s\n discourse representation theory (see entry).\n For more details on different versions of this alternative to\nclassical semantics, see the entry on\n dynamic semantics.\n For critical discussion of the motivations for dynamic semantics, see\nKaren Lewis (2014). For discussion of the extent to which dynamic and\nstatic approaches are really in competition, see Stojnić\n(2019). \nA final alternative to classical semantics differs from those\ndiscussed in the preceding four subsections in two (related)\nrespects. \nThe first is that, unlike the other non-classical approaches,\nexpressivist semantics was originally not motivated by linguistic\nconsiderations. Rather, it was developed in response to specifically\nmetaethical considerations. A number of philosophers held metaethical\nviews which made it hard for them to see how a classical semantic\ntreatment of sentences about ethics could be correct, and so developed\nexpressivism as an alternative treatment of these parts of\nlanguage. \nThis leads to a second difference between expressivist and our other\nfour alternatives to classical semantics. The latter are all\n“global alternatives”, in the sense that they propose\nnon-classical approaches to the semantics of all of a natural\nlanguage. By contrast, expressivists typically agree that classical\nsemantics (or one of the other non-expressivist alternatives to it\ndiscussed in\n §§2.2.1–4)\n is correct for many parts of language; they just think that special\nfeatures of some parts of language require expressivist treatment. \nOne can think of many traditional versions of expressivism, which were\nmotivated by metaethical concerns, as involving two basic ideas.\nFirst, we can explain the meaning of a mental state by saying what\nmental state that sentence expresses. Second, the mental state\nexpressed by a sentence about ethics is different in kind from the\nmental state expressed by a “factual” sentence. \nTwo follow up questions suggest themselves. One is about what\n“expresses” means here; for one answer, see Gibbard\n(1990). A second is about what the relevant difference in mental\nstates consists in. On many views, the mental states expressed by\nnon-ethical sentences are beliefs, whereas the mental states expressed\nby ethical sentences are not. Different versions of expressivism\npropose different candidates for the mental states which are expressed\nby ethical sentences. Prominent candidates include exclamations (Ayer\n1936), commands (Hare 1952), and plans (Gibbard 1990, 2003). \nA classic problem for expressivist theories of the kind just sketched\ncomes from interactions between ethical and non-ethical bits of\nlanguage. This problem has come to be known as the Frege-Geach\nproblem, because a very influential version of the problem was posed\nby Geach (1960, 1965). (A version of the problem is also independently\npresented in Searle 1962.) In one of its versions, the problem comes\nin two parts. First, whatever mental state expressivists take ethical\nsentences to express will typically not be expressed by complex\nsentences which embed the relevant ethical sentence. So even if \nLying is wrong. \nexpresses the mental state of planning not to lie, the same sentence\nwhen embedded in the conditional \nIf lying is wrong, then what Jane did was wrong. \ndoes not. After all, one can endorse this conditional without\nendorsing a plan not to lie. So it seems that the expressivist must\nsay that “lying is wrong” means something different when\nit occurs alone than it does when it occurs in the antecedent of a\nconditional. The problem, though, is that if one takes that view it is\nhard to see how it could follow from the above two sentences, as it\nsurely does, that \nWhat Jane did was wrong. \nFor a discussion of solutions to this problem, and an influential\ncritique of expressivism, see Schroeder (2008). \nMuch recent work on expressivism is both less focused on the special\ncase of ethics, and more motivated by purely linguistic\nconsiderations, than has often been the case traditionally. Examples\ninclude discussions of expressivism about epistemic modality in Yalcin\n(2007), about knowledge ascriptions in Moss (2013), and about\nvagueness in MacFarlane (2016). \nAs mentioned above, the aim of §2 of this entry is to discuss\nissues about the form which a semantic theory should take which are at\na higher level of abstraction than issues about the correct semantic\ntreatment of particular expression-types. (Also as mentioned above,\nsome of these may be found in the entries on\n conditionals,\n descriptions,\n names,\n propositional attitude reports, and\n tense and aspect.)\n But there are some general issues in semantics which, while more\ngeneral than questions about how, for example, the semantics of\nadverbs should go, are largely (though not wholly) orthogonal to the\nquestion of which of the frameworks for semantic theorizing laid out\nin\n §2.1–2\n should be adopted. The present subsection introduces a few of\nthese. \n§2.1.4 introduced the idea that\nsome expressions might be context-sensitive, or indexical. Within a\npropositional semantics, we’d say that these expressions have\ndifferent contents relative to distinct contexts; but the phenomenon\nof context-sensitivity is one which any semantic theory must\nrecognize. A very general question which is both highly important and\northogonal to the above distinctions between types of semantic\ntheories is: How much context-sensitivity is there in natural\nlanguages? \nVirtually everyone recognizes a sort of core group of indexicals,\nincluding “I”, “here”, and “now”.\nMost also think of demonstratives, like (some uses of)\n“this” and “that”, as indexicals. But whether\nand how this list should be extended is a matter of controversy. Some\npopular candidates for inclusion are: \nMany philosophers and linguists think that one or more of these\ncategories of expressions are indexicals. Indeed, some think that\nvirtually every natural language expression is context-sensitive. \nQuestions about context-sensitivity are important, not just for\nsemantics, but for many areas of philosophy. And that is because some\nof the terms thought to be context-sensitive are terms which play a\ncentral role in describing the subject matter of other areas of\nphilosophy. \nPerhaps the most prominent example here is the role that the view that\n“knows” is an indexical has played in recent epistemology.\nThis view is often called “contextualism about knowledge”;\nand in general, the view that some term F is an indexical is\noften called “contextualism about F”. Contextualism\nabout knowledge is of interest in part because it promises to provide\na kind of middle ground between two opposing epistemological\npositions: the skeptical view that we know hardly anything about our\nsurroundings, and the dogmatist view that we can know that we are not\nin various Cartesian skeptical scenarios. (So, for example, the\ndogmatist holds that I can know that I am not a brain in a vat which\nis, for whatever reason, being made to have the series of experiences\nsubjectively indistinguishable from the experiences I actually have.)\nBoth of these positions can seem unappealing—skepticism because\nit does seem that I can occasionally know, e.g., that I am sitting\ndown, and dogmatism because it’s hard to see how I can rule out\nthe possibility that I am in a skeptical scenario subjectively\nindistinguishable from my actual situation. \nBut the disjunction of these positions can seem, not just unappealing,\nbut inevitable; for the proposition that I am sitting entails that I\nam not a brain in a vat, and it’s hard to see—presuming\nthat I know that this entailment holds—how I could know the\nformer without thereby being in a position to know the latter. The\ncontextualist about “knows” aims to provide the answer:\nthe extension of “knows” depends on features of the\ncontext of utterance. Perhaps—to take one among many possible\ncontextualist views—a pair of a subject and a proposition\np will be in the extension of “knows” relative to a\ncontext only if that subject is able to rule out every possibility\nwhich is both (i) inconsistent with p and (ii) salient in\nC. The idea is that “I know that I am sitting down”\ncan be true in a normal setting, simply because the possibility that I\nam a brain in a vat is not normally salient; but typically “I\nknow that I am not a brain in a vat” will be false, since\ndiscussion of skeptical scenarios makes them salient, and (if the\nskeptical scenario is well-designed) I will lack the evidence needed\nto rule them out. See for discussion, among many other places, the\nentry on\n epistemic contextualism,\n Cohen (1986), DeRose (1992), and David Lewis (1996). \nHaving introduced one important contextualist thesis, let’s\nreturn to the general question which faces the semantic theorist,\nwhich is: How do we tell when an expression is context-sensitive?\nContextualism about knowledge, after all, can hardly get off the\nground unless “knows” really is a context-sensitive\nexpression. “I” and “here” wear their\ncontext-sensitivity on their sleeves; but “knows” does\nnot. What sort of argument would suffice to show that an expression is\nan indexical? \nPhilosophers and linguists disagree about the right answers to this\nquestion. The difficulty of coming up with a suitable diagnostic is\nillustrated by considering one intuitively plausible test, defended in\nChapter 7 of Cappelen & Lepore (2005). This test says that an\nexpression is an indexical iff it characteristically blocks\ndisquotational reports of what a speaker said in cases in which the\noriginal speech and the disquotational report are uttered in contexts\nwhich differ with respect to the relevant contextual parameter. (Or,\nmore cautiously, that this test provides evidence that a given\nexpression is, or is not, context-sensitive.) \nThis test clearly counts obvious indexicals as such. Consider\n“I”. Suppose that Mary utters \nI am hungry. \nOne sort of disquotational report of Mary’s speech would use the\nvery sentence Mary uttered in the complement of a “says”\nascription. So suppose that Sam attempts such a disquotational report\nof what Mary said, and utters \nMary said that I am hungry. \nThe report is obviously false; Mary said that Mary is hungry, not that\nSam is. The falsity of Sam’s report suggests that “I am\nhungry” has a different content out of Mary’s mouth than\nout of Sam’s; and this, in turn, suggests that “I”\nhas a different content when uttered by Mary than when uttered by Sam.\nHence, it suggests that “I” is an indexical. \nIt isn’t just that this test gives the right result in many\ncases; it’s also that the test fits nicely with the plausible\nview that an utterance of a sentence of the form “A said\nthat S” in a context C is true iff the content of\nS in C is the same as the content of what the referent\nof “A” said (on the relevant occasion). \nThe interesting uses of this test are not uses which show that\n“I” is an indexical; we already knew that. The interesting\nuse of this test, as Cappelen and Lepore argue, is to show that many\nof the expressions which have been taken to be indexicals—like\nthe ones on the list given above—are not\ncontext-sensitive. For we can apparently employ disquotational reports\nof the relevant sort to report utterances using quantifiers, gradable\nadjectives, modals, “knows”, etc. This test thus\napparently shows that no expressions beyond the obvious\nones—“I”, “here”, “now”,\netc.—are genuinely context-sensitive. \nBut, as Hawthorne (2006) argues, naive applications of this test seem\nto lead to unacceptable results. Terms for relative directions, like\n“left”, seem to be almost as obviously context-sensitive\nas “I”; the direction picked out by simple uses of\n“left” depends on the orientation of the speaker of the\ncontext. But we can typically use “left” in disquotational\n“says” reports of the relevant sort. Suppose, for example,\nthat Mary says \nThe coffee machine is to the left. \nSam can later truly report Mary’s speech by saying \nMary said that the coffee machine was to the left. \ndespite the fact that Sam’s orientation in the context of the\nascription differs from Mary’s orientation in the context of the\nreported utterance. Hence our test seems to lead to the absurd result\nthat “left” is not context-sensitive. \nOne interpretation of this puzzling fact is that our test using\ndisquotational “says” ascriptions is a bit harder to apply\nthan one might have thought. For, to apply it, one needs to be sure\nthat the context of the ascription really does differ from the context\nof the original utterance in the value of the relevant contextual\nparameter. And in the case of disquotational reports using\n“left”, one might think that examples like the above show\nthat the relevant contextual parameter is sometimes not the\norientation of the speaker, but rather the orientation of the subject\nof the ascription at the time of the relevant utterance. \nThis is but one criterion for context-sensitivity. But discussion of\nthis criterion brings out the fact that the reliability of an\napplication of a test for context-sensitivity will in general not be\nindependent of the space of views one might take about the contextual\nparameters to which a given expression is sensitive. For an\nilluminating discussion of ways in which we might revise tests for\ncontext-sensitivity using disquotational reports which are sensitive\nto the above data, see Cappelen & Hawthorne (2009). For a critical\nsurvey of other proposed tests for context-sensitivity, see Cappelen\n& Lepore (2005: Part I). \nThis is just an introduction to one central issue concerning the\nrelationship between context and semantic content. A sampling of other\ninfluential works on this topic includes Sperber and Wilson (1995),\nCarston (2002), Recanati (2004, 2010), Bezuidenhout (2002), and the\nessays in Stanley (2007). \n§2.1.5 introduced the idea of an\nexpression determining a reference, relative to a context, with\nrespect to a particular circumstance of evaluation. But that\ndiscussion left the notion of a circumstance of evaluation rather\nunderspecified. One might want to know more about what, exactly, these\ncircumstances of evaluation involve—and hence about what sorts\nof things the reference of an expression can (once we’ve fixed a\ncontext) vary with respect to. \nOne way to focus this question is to stay at the level of sentences,\nand imagine that we have fixed on a sentence S, with a certain\ncharacter, and context C. If sentences express propositions\nrelative to contexts, then S will express some proposition\nP relative to C. If the determination of reference in\ngeneral depends not just on character and context, but also on\ncircumstance, then we know that P might have different\ntruth-values relative to different circumstances of evaluation. Our\nquestion is: exactly what must we specify in order to determine\nP’s truth-value? \nLet’s say that an index is the sort of thing which, for\nsome proposition P, we must at least sometimes specify in order\nto determine P’s truth-value. Given this usage, we can think of\ncircumstances of evaluation—the things which play the\ntheoretical role outlined in\n §2.1.5—as\n made up of indices. \nThe most uncontroversial candidate for an index is a world, because\nmost advocates of a propositional semantics think that propositions\ncan have different truth-values with respect to different possible\nworlds. The main question is whether circumstances of evaluation need\ncontain any indices other than a possible world. \nThe most popular candidate for a second index is a time. The view that\npropositions can have different truth-values with respect to different\ntimes—and hence that we need a time index—is often called\n“temporalism”. The negation of temporalism is\neternalism. \nThe motivations for temporalism are both metaphysical and semantic. On\nthe metaphysical side, A-theorists about time (see the entry on\n time)\n think that corresponding to predicates like “is a child”\nare A-series properties which a thing can have at one time, and lack\nat another time. (Hence, on this view, the property corresponding to\n“is a child” is not a property like being a child in\n2014, since that is a property which a thing has permanently if\nat all, and hence is a B-series rather than A-series property.) But\nthen it looks like the proposition expressed by “Violet is a\nchild”—which predicates this A-series property of\nViolet—should have different truth-values with respect to\ndifferent times. And this is enough to motivate the view that we\nshould have an index for a time. \nOn the semantic side, as Kaplan (1989) notes, friends of the idea that\ntenses are best modeled as operators have good reason to include a\ntime index in circumstances of evaluation. After all, operators\noperate on contents, so if there are temporal operators, they will\nonly be able to affect truth-values if those contents can have\ndifferent truth-values with respect to different times. \nA central challenge for the view that propositions can change\ntruth-value over time is whether the proponent of this view can make\nsense of retention of propositional attitudes over time. For suppose\nthat I believe in 2014 that Violet is a child. Intuitively, I might\nhold fixed all of my beliefs about Violet for the next 40 years,\nwithout its being true, in 2054, that I have the obviously false\nbelief that Violet is still a child. But the temporalist, who thinks\nof the proposition that Violet is a child as something which\nincorporates no reference to a time and changes truth-value over time,\nseems stuck with this result. Problems of this sort for temporalism\nare developed in Richard (1981); for a response see Sullivan\n(2014). \nMotivations for eternalism are also both metaphysical and semantic.\nThose attracted to B-theories of time will take propositions to have\ntheir truth-values eternally, which makes inclusion of a time index\nsuperfluous. And those who think that tenses are best modeled in terms\nof quantification over times rather than using tense operators will,\nsimilarly, see no use for a time index. For a defense of the\nquantificational over the operator analysis of tense, see King\n(2003). \nIs there a case to be made for including any indices other than a\nworld and a time? There is; and this has spurred much of the recent\ninterest in relativist semantic theories. Relativist semantic theories\nhold that our indices should include not just a world and (perhaps) a\ntime, but also a context of assessment. Just as propositions\ncan have different truth values with respect to different worlds, so,\non this view, they can vary in their truth depending upon features of\nthe conversational setting in which they are considered. (Though this\nway of putting things assumes that the relativist should be a\n“truth relativist” rather than a “content\nrelativist”. See for discussion\nWeatherson and Egan 2011: § 2.3.) \nThe motivations for this sort of view can be illustrated by a type of\nexample whose importance is emphasized in Egan et al. (2005). Suppose\nthat, at the beginning of a murder investigation inquiry, I say \nThe murderer might have been on campus at midnight. \nIt looks like the proposition expressed by this sentence will be true,\nroughly, if we don’t know anything which rules out the murderer\nhaving been on campus at midnight. But now suppose that more\ninformation comes in, some of which rules out the murderer having been\non campus at midnight. At this point, it seems, I could truly say \nWhat I said was false—the murderer couldn’t have been on\ncampus at midnight. \nBut this is puzzling. It is not puzzling that the sentence “The\nmurderer might have been on campus at midnight” could be true\nwhen uttered in the first context but false when uttered in the second\ncontext; that fact could be accommodated by any number of\ncontextualist treatments of epistemic modals, which would dissolve the\npuzzle by saying that the sentence expresses different propositions\nrelative to the two contexts. The puzzle is that the truth of the\nsecond sentence seems to imply that the proposition expressed by the\nfirst—which we agreed was true relative to that context—is\nfalse relative to the second context. Here we don’t have (or\ndon’t just have) sentences varying in truth-value depending on\ncontext; we seem to have propositions varying in truth-value depending\non context. The relativist about epistemic modals takes appearance\nhere to be reality, and holds that, in addition to worlds (and maybe\ntimes), propositions can sometimes differ in their truth-value\nrelative to contexts of assessment (roughly, the context in which the\nproposition is being considered). (Note that it is not essential to\nthe case that the two contexts of assessment are at different times;\nmuch the same intuitions can be generated by considering cases of\n“eavesdropping”, in which one party overhears the\nutterance of some other group which lacks some of its evidence.) \nRelativist treatments of various expressions have also been motivated\nby certain apparent facts about disagreement. Lasersohn (2005)\nconsiders the example of predicates of personal taste. He points out\nthat we’re often inclined to think that, if our tastes differ\nsufficiently, my utterance of “That soup is tasty” can be\ntrue even while your utterance of “That soup is not tasty”\nis also true. As above, this fact by itself is not especially\nsurprising, and might seem to cry out for a contextualist treatment of\n“tasty”. But the puzzling thing is that, despite the fact\nthat we think that each of us are uttering sentences which express\ntrue propositions, we are clearly disagreeing with each other. (You\nmight say, after overhearing me, “No, that soup is not\ntasty”.) \nThe contrast here with indexicals is apparently quite sharp. If I say\n“I’m hungry”, and you’re not hungry,\nyou’d never reply to my utterance by saying “No, I’m\nnot hungry”—precisely because it’s obvious that we\nwould not be disagreeing. So again we have a puzzle: a puzzle about\nhow each of our “soup” sentences could express true\npropositions, despite those propositions contradicting each other.\nRelativism suggests an answer: these propositions are only true or\nfalse relative to individuals. The one I express is true relative to\nme, and its negation is true relative to you; they’re\ncontradictory in the sense that it is impossible for both to be true\nrelative to the same individual (at the same time). \nIt’s very controversial whether any of these relativist\narguments are convincing. For more discussion, see the discussion of\n“new relativism” in the entry on\n relativism.\n For an explication of relativism and its application to various kinds\nof discourse, see MacFarlane (2014). For an extended critique of\nrelativism, see Cappelen & Hawthorne (2009). \nMost philosophers believe in propositions, and hence think that\nsemantics should be done according to one of the three broad\ncategories of propositionalist approaches sketched above: possible\nworlds semantics, Russellianism, or Fregeanism. But it is notable that\nof these three views, only one—possible worlds\nsemantics—actually tells us what propositions are. (Even in that\ncase, of course, one might ask what possible worlds are, and hence\nwhat propositions are sets of. See the entry on\n possible worlds.)\n Russellian and Fregean views make claims about what sorts of things\nare the constituents of propositions—but don’t tell us\nwhat the structured propositions so constituted are. \nThere are really two questions here. One is the question: what does it\nmean to say that x is a constituent of a proposition? The\nlanguage of constituency suggests parthood; but there’s some\nreason to think that x’s being a constituent of a\nproposition isn’t a matter of x’s being a part of\nthat proposition. This is perhaps clearest on a Russellian view,\naccording to which ordinary physical objects can be constituents of\npropositions. The problem is that a thing can be a constituent of a\nproposition without every part of that thing being a constituent of\nthat proposition; a proposition with me as a constituent, it seems,\nneed not also have every single molecule that now composes me as a\nconstituent. But that fact is inconsistent with the idea that\nconstituency is parthood and the plausible assumption that parthood is\ntransitive. For discussion of this and other problems, see Gilmore\n(2014), Keller (2013), and Merricks (2015). \nHence the proponent of structured propositions owes some account of\nwhat “structure” and “constituent” talk\namounts to in this domain. And they can hardly take these notions as\nprimitive, since it would then be very unclear what explanatory value\nthe claim that propositions are structured could have. \nThe second, in some ways more fundamental, question, is: What sort of\nthing are propositions? To what metaphysical category do they belong?\nThe simplest and most straightforward answer to this question is:\n“They belong to the sui generis category of\npropositions”. (This is the view of Plantinga (1974) and Merricks (2015).) \nBut recently many philosophers have sought to give different answers\nto this question, by trying to explain how propositions could be\nmembers of some other ontological category in which we have\nindependent reason to believe. Recent work of this sort can be divided\ninto three main families of views. \nAccording to the first, propositions are a kind of fact. This view\nwas, on some interpretations, advocated by Russell (1903) and\nWittgenstein (1922). The most prominent current defender of this view\nis Jeffrey King. On his version of the view, propositions (at least\nthe propositions expressed by sentences) are meta-linguistic facts\nabout sentences. At a first pass, and ignoring some important\nsubtleties, the proposition expressed by the sentence “Amelia\ntalks” will be the fact that there is some language L,\nsome expression x, some expression y, and some syntactic\nrelation R such that R(x,y), x has\nAmelia as its semantic value, y has the property of talking as\nits semantic value, and R encodes ascription. In some respects,\nthis view is not so far from—though much more thoroughly\ndeveloped than—Wittgenstein’s view in the\nTractatus that “a proposition is a propositional sign\nin its projective relation to the world” (3.12). See for\ndevelopment and defense of this view King (2007, 2014). \nAccording to the second sort of view, propositions are kind of\nproperty. Versions of this view vary both according to which\nproperties they take propositions to be, and what they take\npropositions to be properties of. This view is most closely associated\nwith David Lewis (1979) and Chisholm (1981), who took the objects of\npropositional attitudes to be properties which the bearer of the\nattitude ascribes to him- or herself. Other versions of the view are\ndefended by van Inwagen (2004) and Gilmore (forthcoming), who take\npropositions to be 0-place relations, and Richard (2013) and Speaks\n(2014), who take propositions to be monadic properties of certain\nsorts. \nAccording to the third sort of view, propositions are entities which\nare, or owe their existence to, the mental acts of subjects. While\ntheir views differ in many ways, both Hanks (2007, 2011) and Soames\n(2010, 2014) think of propositions as acts of predication. In the\nsimplest case—a monadic predication—the proposition will\nbe the act of predicating a property of an object. \nOf course, not all views fit into these three categories. An important\nview which fits into none of them is defended in Moltmann (2013). \nDifferent theorists differ, not just in their views about what\npropositions are, but also in their views about what a theory of\npropositions should explain. The representational properties of\npropositions are a case in point. Hanks, King, and Soames take one of\nthe primary tasks of a theory of propositions to be the explanation of\nthe representational properties of propositions. Others, like McGlone\n(2012) and Merricks (2015), hold that a proposition’s having\ncertain representational properties is a primitive matter. Still\nothers, like Richard and Speaks, deny that propositions have\nrepresentational properties in any interesting sense. See for further\ndiscussion of these issues the entry on\n structured propositions. \nWe now turn to our second sort of “theory of meaning”:\nfoundational theories of meaning, which are attempts to specify the\nfacts in virtue of which expressions of natural languages come to have\nthe semantic properties that they have. \nThe question which foundational theories of meaning try to answer is a\ncommon sort of question in philosophy. In the philosophy of\n action (see entry)\n we ask what the facts are in virtue of which a given piece of\nbehavior is an intentional action; in questions about\n personal identity (see entry)\n we ask what the facts are in virtue of which x and y\nare the same person; in ethics we ask what the facts are in virtue of\nwhich a given action is morally right or wrong. But, even if they are\ncommon enough, it is not obvious what the constraints are on answers\nto these sorts of questions, or when we should expect questions of\nthis sort to have interesting answers. \nAccordingly, one sort of approach to foundational theories of meaning\nis simply to deny that there is any true foundational theory of\nmeaning. One might be quite willing to endorse one of the semantic\ntheories outlined above while also holding that facts about the\nmeanings of expressions are primitive, in the sense that there is no\nsystematic story to be told about the facts in virtue of which\nexpressions have the meanings that they have. (See, for example,\nJohnston 1988.) \nThere is another reason why one might be pessimistic about the\nprospects of foundational theories of meaning. While plainly distinct\nfrom semantics, the attempt to provide foundational theories is\nclearly in one sense answerable to semantic theorizing, since without\na clear view of the facts about the semantic contents of expressions\nwe won't have a clear view of the facts for which we are trying to\nprovide an explanation. One might, then, be skeptical about the\nprospects of foundational theories of meaning not because of a general\nprimitivist view of semantic facts, but just because one holds that\nnatural language semantics is not yet advanced enough for us to have a\nclear grip on the semantic facts which foundational theories of\nmeaning aim to analyze. (See for discussion Yalcin (2014).) \nMany philosophers have, however, attempted to provide foundational\ntheories of meaning. This section sets aside pessimism about\nthe prospects for such theories and lays out the main attempts to give\na systematic account of the facts about language users in virtue of\nwhich their words have the semantic properties that they do. It is\nuseful to separate these theories into two camps. \nAccording to the first sort of view, linguistic expressions inherit\ntheir contents from some other sort of bearer of content. So, for\nexample, one might say that linguistic expressions inherit their\ncontents from the contents of certain mental states with which they\nare associated. I’ll call views of this type mentalist\ntheories. Mentalist theories are discussed in\n §3.1,\n and non-mentalist theories in\n §3.2. \nAll mentalist theories of meaning have in common that they analyze one\nsort of representation—linguistic representation—in terms\nof another sort of representation—mental representation. For\nphilosophers who are interested in explaining content, or\nrepresentation, in non-representational terms, then, mentalist\ntheories can only be a first step in the task of giving an ultimate\nexplanation of the foundations of linguistic representation. The\nsecond, and more fundamental explanation would then come at the level\nof a theory of mental content. (For an overview of theories of this\nsort, see entry on\n mental representation\n and the essays in Stich and Warfield 1994.) Indeed, the popularity of\nmentalist theories of linguistic meaning, along with the conviction\nthat content should be explicable in non-representational terms, is an\nimportant reason why so much attention has been focused on theories of\nmental representation over the last few decades. \nSince mentalists aim to explain the nature of meaning in terms of the\nmental states of language users, mentalist theories may be divided\naccording to which mental states they take to be relevant to the\ndetermination of meaning. The most well-worked out views on this topic\nare the Gricean view, which explains meaning in terms of the\ncommunicative intentions of language users, and the view that the\nmeanings of expressions are fixed by conventions which pair sentences\nwith certain beliefs. We will discuss these in turn, followed by a\nbrief discussion of a third alternative available to the\nmentalist. \n\n Paul Grice\n developed an analysis of meaning which can be thought of as the\nconjunction of two claims: (1) facts about what expressions mean are\nto be explained, or analyzed, in terms of facts about what speakers\nmean by utterances of them, and (2) facts about what speakers mean by\ntheir utterances can be explained in terms of their intentions. These\ntwo theses comprise the “Gricean program” for reducing\nmeaning to the contents of the intentions of speakers. \nTo understand Grice’s view of meaning, it is important first to\nbe clear on the distinction between the meaning, or content, of\nlinguistic expressions—which is what semantic theories\nlike those discussed in\n §2\n aim to describe—and what speakers mean by utterances\nemploying those expressions. This distinction can be illustrated by\nexample. (See entry on\n pragmatics\n for more discussion.) Suppose that in response to a question about\nthe weather in the city where I live, I say “Well, South Bend is\nnot exactly Hawaii”. The meaning of this sentence is fairly\nclear: it expresses the (true) proposition that South Bend, Indiana is\nnot identical to Hawaii. But what I mean by uttering this\nsentence is something more than this triviality: I mean by the\nutterance that the weather in South Bend is not nearly as good as that\nin Hawaii. And this example utterance is in an important respect very\ntypical: usually the propositions which speakers mean to convey by\ntheir utterances include propositions other than the one expressed by\nthe sentence used in the context. When we ask “What did you mean\nby that?” we are usually not asking for the meaning of the\nsentence uttered. \nThe idea behind stage (1) of Grice’s theory of meaning is that\nof these two phenomena, speaker-meaning is the more fundamental:\nsentences and other expressions mean what they do because of what\nspeakers mean by their utterances of those sentences. (For more\ndetails about how Grice thought that sentence-meaning could be\nexplained in terms of speaker-meaning, see the discussion of resultant\nprocedures in the entry on\n Paul Grice.)\n One powerful way to substantiate the claim that speaker-meaning is\nexplanatorily prior to expression-meaning would be to show that facts\nabout speaker-meaning may be given an analysis which makes no use of\nfacts about what expressions mean; and this is just what stage (2) of\nGrice’s analysis, to which we now turn, aims to provide. \nGrice thought that speaker-meaning could be analyzed in terms of the\ncommunicative intentions of speakers—in particular, their\nintentions to cause beliefs in their audience. \nThe simplest version of this idea would hold that meaning p by\nan utterance is just a matter of intending that one’s audience\ncome to believe p. But this can’t be quite right. Suppose\nI turn to you and say, “You’re standing on my foot”.\nI intend that you hear the words I am saying; so I intend that you\nbelieve that I have said, “You’re standing on my\nfoot”. But I do not mean by my utterance that I have said,\n“You’re standing on my foot”. That is my\nutterance—what I mean by it is the proposition that you are\nstanding on my foot, or that you should get off of my foot. I do not\nmean by my utterance that I am uttering a certain sentence. \nThis sort of example indicates that speaker meaning can’t just\nbe a matter of intending to cause a certain belief—it must be\nintending to cause a certain belief in a certain way. But what, in\naddition to intending to cause the belief, is required for meaning\nthat p? Grice’s idea was that one must not only intend to\ncause the audience to form a belief, but also intend that they do so\non the basis of their recognition of the speaker’s intention.\nThis condition is not met in the above example: I don’t expect\nyou to believe that I have uttered a certain sentence on the basis of\nyour recognition of my intention that you do so; after all,\nyou’d believe this whether or not I wanted you to. This is all\nto the good. \nThis Gricean analysis of speaker-meaning can be formulated as\n follows:[5] \nHowever, even if [G] can be given a fairly plausible motivation, and\nfits many cases rather well, it is also open to some convincing\ncounterexamples. Three such types of cases are: (i) cases in which the\nspeaker means p by an utterance despite knowing that the\naudience already believes p, as in cases of reminding or\nconfession; (ii) cases in which a speaker means p by an\nutterance, such as the conclusion of an argument, which the speaker\nintends an audience to believe on the basis of evidence rather than\nrecognition of speaker intention; and (iii) cases in which there is no\nintended audience at all, as in uses of language in thought. These\ncases call into question whether there is any connection between\nspeaker-meaning and intended effects stable enough to ground an\nanalysis of the sort that Grice envisaged; it is still a matter of\nmuch controversy whether an explanation of speaker meaning descended\nfrom [G] can succeed. \nFor developments of the Gricean program, see—in addition to the\nclassic essays in Grice (1989)—Schiffer (1972), Neale (1992),\nand Davis (2002). For an extended criticism, see Schiffer (1987). \nAn important alternative to the Gricean analysis, which shares the\nGricean’s commitment to a mentalist analysis of meaning in terms\nof the contents of mental states, is the analysis of meaning in terms\nof the beliefs rather than the intentions of speakers. \nIt is intuitively plausible that such an analysis should be possible.\nAfter all, there clearly are regularities which connect utterances and\nthe beliefs of speakers; roughly, it seems that, for the most part,\nspeakers seriously utter a sentence which (in the context) means\np only if they also believe p. One might then, try to\nanalyze meaning directly in terms of the beliefs of language users, by\nsaying that what it is for a sentence S to express some\nproposition p is for it to be the case that, typically, members\nof the community would not utter S unless they believed\np. However, we can imagine a community in which there is some\naction which everyone would only perform were they to believe some\nproposition p, but which is such that no member of the\ncommunity knows that any other member of the community acts according\nto a rule of this sort. It is plausible that in such a community, the\naction-type in question would not express the proposition p, or\nindeed have any meaning at all. \nBecause of cases like this, it seems that regularities in meaning and\nbelief are not sufficient to ground an analysis of meaning. For this\nreason, many proponents of a mentalist analysis of meaning in terms of\nbelief have sought instead to analyze meaning in terms of\nconventions governing such regularities. Roughly, a\nregularity is a matter of convention when the regularity obtains\nbecause there is something akin to an agreement among a group of\npeople to keep the regularity in place. So, applied to our present\nexample, the idea would be (again roughly) that for a sentence\nS to express a proposition p in some group is for there\nto be something like an agreement in that group to maintain some sort\nof regularity between utterances of S and agents’\nbelieving p. This seems to be what is lacking in the example\ndescribed in the previous paragraph. \nThere are different ways to make this rough idea precise (see the\nentry on\n convention).\n According to one important view, a sentence S expresses the\nproposition p if and only if the following three conditions are\nsatisfied: (1) speakers typically utter S only if they believe\np and typically come to believe p upon hearing S,\n(2) members of the community believe that (1) is true, and (3) the\nfact that members of the community believe that (1) is true, and\nbelieve that other members of the community believe that (1) is true,\ngives them a good reason to go on acting so as to make (1) true. (This\na simplified version of the theory defended in David Lewis 1975.) \nFor critical discussion of this sort of analysis of meaning, see Burge\n1975, Hawthorne 1990, Laurence 1996, and Schiffer 2006. \nThe two sorts of mentalist theories sketched above both try to explain\nmeaning in terms of the relationship between linguistic expressions\nand propositional attitudes of users of the relevant language. But\nthis is not the only sort of theory available to a theorist who wants\nto analyze meaning in terms of broadly mental representation. A common\nview in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science is that the\npropositional attitudes of subjects are underwritten by an internal\nlanguage of thought, comprised of mental representations. (See entry\non\n the computational theory of mind.)\n One might try to explain linguistic meaning directly in terms of the\ncontents of mental representations, perhaps by thinking of language\nprocessing as pairing linguistic expressions with mental\nrepresentations; one could then think of the meaning of the relevant\nexpression for that individual as being inherited from the content of\nthe mental representation with which it is paired. \nWhile this view has, historically, not enjoyed as much attention as\nthe mentalist theories discussed in the preceding two subsections, it\nis a natural view for anyone who endorses the widely held thesis that\nsemantic competence is to be explained by some sort of internal\nrepresentation of the semantic facts. If we need to posit such\ninternal representations anyway, it is natural to think that the\nmeaning of an expression for an individual can be explained in terms\nof that individual's representation of its meaning. For discussion of\nthis sort of theory, see Laurence (1996). \nJust as proponents of Gricean and convention-based theories typically\nview their theories as only the first stage in an analysis of\nmeaning—because they analyze meaning in terms of another sort of\nmental representation—so proponents of mental\nrepresentation-based theories will typically seek to provide an\nindependent analysis of contents of mental representations. For an\noverview of attempts to provide the latter sort of theory, see the\nentry on\n mental representation\n and the essays in Stich and Warfield (1994). \nAs noted above, not all foundational theories of meaning attempt to\nexplain meaning in terms of mental content. One might be inclined to\npursue a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning for a number of\nreasons; for example, one might be skeptical about the mentalist\ntheories on offer; one might think that mental representation should\nbe analyzed in terms of linguistic representation, rather than the\nother way around; or one might think that representation should be\nanalyzable in non-representational terms, and doubt whether there is\nany true explanation of mental representation suitable to accompany a\nmentalist reduction of meaning to mental representation. \nTo give a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning is to say which\naspects of the use of an expression determine\nmeaning—and do so without taking that expression to simply\ninherit its content from some more fundamental bearer of content. In\nwhat follows I’ll briefly discuss some of the aspects of the use\nof expressions which proponents of non-mentalist theories have taken\nto explain their meanings. \nIn Naming and Necessity, Kripke suggested that the reference\nof a name could be explained in terms of the history of use of that\nname, rather than by descriptions associated with that name by its\nusers. In the standard case, Kripke thought, the right explanation of\nthe reference of a name could be divided into an explanation of the\nname’s introduction as name for this or that—an\nevent of “baptism”—and its successful\ntransmission from one speaker to another. \nOne approach to the theory of meaning is to extend Kripke’s\nremarks in two ways: first, by suggesting that they might serve as an\naccount of meaning, as well as\n reference;[6]\n and second, by extending them to parts of speech other than names.\n(See, for discussion, Devitt 1981.) In this way, we might aim to\nexplain the meanings of expressions in terms of their causal\norigin. \nWhile causal theories don’t take expressions to simply inherit\ntheir contents from mental states, it is plausible that they should\nstill give mental states an important role to play in explaining\nmeaning. For example, it is plausible that introducing a term involves\nintending that it stand for some object or property, and that\ntransmission of a term from one speaker to another involves the latter\nintending to use it in the same way as the former. \nThere are two standard problems for causal theories of this sort\n(whether they are elaborated in a mentalist or a non-mentalist way).\nThe first is the problem of extending the theory from the case of\nnames to to other sorts of vocabulary for which the theory seems less\nnatural. Examples which have seemed to many to be problematic are\nempty names and non-referring theoretical terms, logical vocabulary,\nand predicates which, because their content does not seem closely\nrelated to the properties represented in perceptual experience, are\nnot intuitively linked to any initial act of “baptism”.\nThe second problem, which is sometimes called the “qua\nproblem”, is the problem of explaining which of the many causes\nof a term’s introduction should determine its content. Suppose\nthat the term “water” was introduced in the presence of a\nbody of H2O. What made it a term for this substance, rather\nthan for liquid in general, or colorless liquid, or colorless liquid\nin the region of the term's introduction? The proponent of a causal\ntheory owes some answer to this question; see for discussion Devitt\nand Sterelny (1987). \nFor a classic discussion of the prospects of causal theories, see\nEvans (1973). For a\nrecent theory which makes causal origin part but not all of the story,\nsee Dickie (2015). \nCausal theories aim to explain meaning in terms of the relations\nbetween expressions and the objects and properties they represent. A\nvery different sort of foundational theory of meaning which maintains\nthis emphasis on the relations between expressions and the world gives\na central role to a principle of charity which holds that\n(modulo some qualifications) the right assignment of meanings to the\nexpression of a subject’s language is that assignment of\nmeanings which maximizes the truth of the subject’s\nutterances. \nAn influential proponent of this sort of view was Donald Davidson, who\nstated the motivation for the view as follows: \nA central source of trouble is the way beliefs and meanings conspire\nto account for utterances. A speaker who holds a sentence to be true\non an occasion does so in part because of what he means, or would\nmean, by an utterance of that sentence, and in part because of what he\nbelieves. If all we have to go on is the fact of honest utterance, we\ncannot infer the belief without knowing the meaning, and have no\nchance of inferring the meaning without the belief. (Davidson 1974a:\n314; see also Davidson 1973) \nDavidson’s idea was that attempts to state the facts in virtue\nof which expressions have a certain meaning for a subject face a kind\nof dilemma: if we had an independent account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content, we could ascend from\nthere to an account of what it is for a sentence to have a meaning; if\nwe had an independent account of what it is for a sentence to have a\nmeaning, we could ascend from there to an account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content; but in fact neither\nsort of independent account is available, because many assignments of\nbeliefs and meanings are consistent with the subject’s\nlinguistic behavior. Davidson’s solution to this dilemma is that\nwe must define belief and meaning together, in terms of an independent\nthird fact: the fact that the beliefs of an agent, and the meanings of\nher words, are whatever they must be in order to maximize the truth of\nher beliefs and utterances. \nBy tying meaning and belief to truth, this sort of foundational theory\nof meaning implies that it is impossible for anyone who speaks a\nmeaningful language to be radically mistaken about the nature of the\nworld; and this implies that certain levels of radical disagreement\nbetween a pair of speakers or communities will also be impossible\n(since the beliefs of each community must be, by and large, true).\nThis is a consequence of the view which Davidson embraced (see\nDavidson 1974b); but one might also reasonably think that radical\ndisagreement, as well as radical error, are possible, and hence that\nany theory, like Davidson’s, which implies that they are\nimpossible must be mistaken. \nA different sort of worry about a theory of this sort is that the\nrequirement that we maximize the truth of the utterances of subjects\nhardly seems sufficient to determine the meanings of the expressions\nof their language. It seems plausible, offhand, that there will be\nmany different interpretations of a subject’s language which\nwill be tied on the measure of truth-maximization; one way to see the\nforce of this sort of worry is to recall the point, familiar from our\ndiscussion of possible worlds semantics in\n §2.1.5\n above, that a pair of sentences can be true in exactly the same\ncircumstances and yet differ in meaning. One worry is thus that a\ntheory of Davidson’s sort will entail an implausible\nindeterminacy of meaning. For Davidson’s fullest attempt to\nanswer this sort of worry, see Chapter 3 of Davidson (2005). \nA different sort of theory emerges from a further objection to the\nsort of theory discussed in the previous section. This objection is\nbased on Hilary Putnam’s (1980, 1981) model-theoretic argument.\nThis argument aimed to show that there are very many different\nassignments of reference to subsentential expressions of our language\nwhich make all of our utterances true. (For details on how the\nargument works, see the entry on\n Skolem’s paradox,\n especially §3.4.) Putnam’s argument therefore leaves us\nwith a choice between two options: either we must accept that there\nare no facts of the matter about what any of our expressions refer to,\nor we must deny that is determined solely by a principle of\ntruth-maximization. \nMost philosophers take the second option. Doing so, however,\ndoesn’t mean that something like the principle of charity\ncan’t still be part of our foundational theory of meaning. \nDavid Lewis (1983, 1984) gave a version of this kind of response,\nwhich he credits to Merrill (1980), and which has since been quite\ninfluential. His idea was that the assignment of contents to\nexpressions of our language is fixed, not just by the constraint that\nthe right interpretation will maximize the truth of our utterances,\nbut by picking the interpretation which does best at jointly\nsatisfying the constraints of truth-maximization and the constraint\nthat the referents of our terms should, as much as possible, be\n“the ones that respect the objective joints in nature”\n(1984: 227). \nSuch entities are often said to be more “eligible” to be\nthe referents of expressions than others. An approach to the\nfoundations of meaning based on the twin principles of charity +\neligibility has some claim to being the most widely held view today.\nSee Sider (2011) for an influential extension of the Lewisian\nstrategy. \nLewis’ solution to Putnam’s problem comes with a\nnon-trivial metaphysical price tag: recognition of an objective graded\ndistinction between more and less natural properties. Some have found\nthe price too much to pay, and have sought other approaches to the\nfoundational theory of meaning. But even if we recognize in our\nmetaphysics a distinction between properties which are\n“joint-carving” and those which are not, we might still\ndoubt whether this distinction can remedy the sorts of indeterminacy\nproblems which plague foundational theories based solely on the\nprinciple of charity. For doubts along these lines, see Hawthorne\n(2007). \nA different way to develop a non-mentalist foundational theory of\nmeaning focuses less on relations between subsentential expressions or\nsentences and bits of non-linguistic reality and more on the\nregularities which govern our use of language. Views of this sort have\nbeen defended by a number of authors; this section focuses on the\nversion of the view developed in Horwich (1998, 2005). \nHorwich’s core idea is that our acceptance of sentences is\ngoverned by certain laws, and, in the case of non-ambiguous\nexpressions, there is a single “acceptance regularity”\nwhich explains all of our uses of the expression. The type of\nacceptance regularity which is relevant will vary depending on the\nsort of expression whose meaning is being explained. For example, our\nuse of a perceptual term like “red” might be best\nexplained by the following acceptance regularity: \nThe disposition to accept “that is red” in response to the\nsort of visual experience normally provoked by a red surface. \nwhereas, in the case of a logical term like “and”, the\nacceptance regularity will involve dispositions to accept inferences\ninvolving pairs of sentences rather than dispositions to respond to\nparticular sorts of experiences: \nThe disposition to accept the two-way argument schema “p,\nq // p and q”. \nAs these examples illustrate, it is plausible that a strength of a\nview like Horwich’s is its ability to handle expressions of\ndifferent categories. \nLike its competitors, Horwich’s theory is also open to some\nobjections. One might worry that his use of the sentential attitude of\nacceptance entails a lapse into mentalism, if acceptance either just\nis, or is analyzed in terms of, beliefs. There is also a\nworry—which affects other “use” or “conceptual\nrole” or “functional role” theories of\nmeaning—that Horwich’s account implies the existence of\ndifferences in meaning which do not exist; it seems, for example, that\ntwo people’s use of some term might be explained by distinct\nbasic acceptance regularities without their meaning different things\nby that term. Schiffer (2000) discusses the example of\n“dog”, and the differences between the basic acceptance\nregularities which govern the use of the term for the blind, the\nbiologically unsophisticated, and people acquainted only with certain\nsorts of\n dogs.[7] \nThis last concern about Horwich’s theory stems from the fact\nthat the theory is, at its core, an individualist theory: it explains\nthe meaning of an expression for an individual in terms of properties\nof that individual’s use of the term. A quite different sort of\nuse theory of meaning turns from the laws which explain an\nindividual’s use of a word to the norms which, in a society,\ngovern the use of the relevant terms. Like the other views discussed\nhere, the view that meaning is a product of social norms of this sort\nhas a long history; it is particularly associated with the work of the\nlater Wittgenstein and his philosophical descendants. (See especially\nWittgenstein 1953.) \nAn important defender of this sort of view is Robert Brandom. On\nBrandom’s view, a sentence’s meaning is due to the\nconditions, in a given society, under which it is correct or\nappropriate to perform various speech acts involving the sentence. To\ndevelop a theory of this sort, one must do two things. First, one must\nshow how the meanings of expressions can be explained in terms of\nthese normative statuses—in Brandom’s (slightly\nnonstandard) terms, one must show how semantics can be explained in\nterms of pragmatics. Second, one must explain how these normative\nstatuses can be instituted by social practices. \nFor details, see Brandom (1994), in which the view is developed at\ngreat length; for a critical discussion of Brandom’s attempt to\ncarry out the second task above, see Rosen (1997). For discussion of\nthe role (or lack thereof) of normativity in a foundational theory of\nmeaning, see Hattiangadi (2007), Gluer and Wilkforss (2009), and the\nentry on\n meaning normativity.","contact.mail":"jspeaks@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
