M.\nScanlon, especially in his book What We Owe to Each Other.\nThis essay takes ‘contractualism’ in the narrower sense.\nWe begin with a brief summary of Scanlon’s contractualism, and\nthen situate his view in relation both to other social contract\ntheories and to its main rival among impartial accounts of\nmorality—namely, utilitarianism. Our discussion is then\norganised around a series of challenges to the contractualist\naccount.\n\n\nThere is already a huge literature surrounding Scanlon’s\ncontractualism. Our aim is not to summarise that\nliterature—still less to contribute anything novel to it.\nRather, we seek to explain the distinctive appeal of contractualism,\nas well as highlighting the challenges it faces from other\ntheories.\n\nScanlon introduces contractualism as a distinctive account of moral\nreasoning. He summarises his account thus: \nBut Scanlon’s version of contractualism is not just concerned\nwith determining which acts are right and wrong. It is also concerned\nwith what reasons and forms of reasoning are justifiable. Whether or\nnot a principle is one that cannot be reasonably rejected is to be\nassessed by appeal to the implications of individuals or agents being\neither licensed or directed to reason in the way required by the\nprinciple. Scanlon’s version offers an account both of (1) the\nauthority of moral standards and of (2) what constitutes rightness and\nwrongness. As to the first, the substantive value that is realised by\nmoral behaviour consists in a relation of “mutual\nrecognition”. As to the second, wrongness consists in\nunjustifiability: wrongness is the property of being\nunjustifiable. The wrongness of an action is not to be equated with\nthe properties that make it unjustifiable. Rather, it is to be equated\nwith its being unjustifiable; the character of wrongness is captured\nby the higher order fact that wrong acts are unjustifiable. What wrong\nacts have in common is that they cannot be justified to others. Thus\nthe various moral considerations that guide our substantive moral\nreflection are unified by a single normative subject matter. In this\nway, contractualism guides our substantive reflection about wrongness.\nWrong is the primary moral predicate; right is defined as “not\nwrong”. One reason for focusing on wrong is to draw attention to\nthe domain that contractualism is concerned to map, concerning what it\nis for one person to have been wronged by another. \nMoral requirements determine what it is to respond properly to the\nvalue of persons as rational agents. The distinctive value of human\nlife lies in the human capacity to assess reasons and justifications.\nTherefore, appreciating the value of a person involves recognising her\ncapacity to appreciate and act on reasons. The way to value this\ncapacity is to treat persons in accord with principles they could not\nreasonably reject. In doing so, the agent is guided by a principle\nthat can rightly be characterised as one that the person herself\nauthorised that agent to be guided by, in thinking about the\nappropriate way to relate to her. Contractualism illuminates the\ncompelling Kantian insight that we ought to treat persons never as\nmere means but always as ends in themselves. It interprets this as\ntreating them according to principles they could not reasonably\nreject. \nContractualism appeals to the idea of a social contract. It attempts\nto derive the content of morality (and, in some versions, also the\njustification for holding that we are obligated to follow morality)\nfrom the notion of an agreement between all those in the moral domain.\nContemporary moral philosophy offers several other interpretations of\nthe social contract tradition. It is useful to distinguish\ncontractualism from these alternatives. \nContractarianism has its roots in Hobbes, whose account is\nbased on mutual self-interest. Morality consists in those forms of\ncooperative behaviour that it is mutually advantageous for\nself-interested agents to engage in. (The most prominent modern\nexponent is David Gauthier. See Gauthier 1986.) \nBy contrast, any form of contractualism is grounded on the\nequal moral status of persons. It interprets this moral status as\nbased on their capacity for rational autonomous agency. According to\ncontractualism, morality consists in what would result if we were to\nmake binding agreements from a point of view that respects our equal\nmoral importance as rational autonomous agents. Contractualism has its\nroots in Rousseau, rather than Hobbes: the general will is what we\nwould jointly will if we adopted the perspective of free and equal\ncitizens. Contractualism offers an alternative to contractarianism.\nUnder contractarianism, I seek to maximise my own interests in a\nbargain with others. Under contractualism, I seek to pursue my\ninterests in a way that I can justify to others who have their own\ninterests to pursue. \nWe next distinguish contractualism from the specific moral theory of\nKant. Kantian moral philosophers seek principles to which all rational\nagents would agree, under certain idealised conditions. In order to\nreach such an agreement, Kant notoriously needs to abstract away from\nmany (some would say too many) concrete features of our moral lives.\n(See Onora O’Neill’s gloss on the notion of agreement in\nKantian ethics; O’Neill 2003.) \nContractualism departs from Kant in various respects. In particular,\nit offers a substantive account of the normative force of morality,\nbased on the value of a relation of mutual respect. Reasonableness is\nnot taken to be something that can be demonstrated outside the moral\npoint of view. Another difference is that contractualism seeks\nprinciples that no one can reasonably reject, rather than principles\nall would agree to. \nHowever, Scanlon’s contractualism has Kantian elements, as it\nseeks a free agreement that elucidates both freedom and equality. We\nmight say that contractualism gives expression to ideas latent in\nKant’s discussions of the Categorical Imperative (especially in\nthe Formula of Humanity and the Formula of the Kingdom of Ends, rather\nthan the more familiar Formula of Universal Law). Indeed, as we shall\nsee in\n section 5,\n Derek Parfit argues that, despite their differences, contractualism\ndoes coincide with the best interpretation of Kant’s moral\ntheory. \nThe most influential recent social contract theorist is John Rawls.\nRawls’s contract differs from Scanlonian contractualism in two\nkey ways. (1) Rawls’s contract is more Kantian, as he seeks\nprinciples everyone would agree to, rather than principles\nno-one could reasonably reject. (This contrast is especially\nmarked if we consider Rawls’s Dewey Lectures (Rawls 1980), where\nhis work is at its most Kantian.) (2) Rawls’s contract is\npolitical—it aims to set the general social framework for a\nliberal society, rather than determining moral principles. As a\nresult, Rawls places the parties to his agreement behind a veil of\nignorance, where they do not know many key facts about their own\nidentity. This is to ensure that the resulting principles of justice\nembody Rawls’s commitment to liberal neutrality. For Rawls, we\nought to follow the principles that it would be rational for everyone\nto choose, if they had to choose those principles without knowing\nanything about themselves or their circumstances. Because each person\nknows that they could end up being anyone, each must have concern for\nall. In essence, Rawls uses self-interest behind a veil of ignorance\nto represent a commitment to justice, construed as fairness to\nall. \nContractualism, by contrast, invokes no veil of ignorance. I know my\nown circumstances. It is not self-interest combined with ignorance of\nself that makes me take account of everyone’s interests, but\nrather my concern to justify myself to everyone else. This motivation\nis a key feature of Scanlon’s contractualism. All social\ncontract theorists—even contractarians—agree that agents\nwant to justify themselves to others. However, for the contractarian,\nsuch a desire is merely strategic—justification is\ninstrumentally useful because it enables me to get others to do what\nserves my interests. For the contractualist, by contrast, agents are\nmorally motivated by an intrinsic desire to justify themselves to\nothers. Having this desire is part of what it is to be a\nmoral agent. \nDespite these differences, contractualism does have several points in\ncommon with other social contract theories. In particular,\ncontractualism aspires to provide a non-utilitarian theory that\ngrounds moral status on a universal trait of persons—rational\nmoral agency—and thus provides general principles whose scope is\nglobal. It is to this contrast with utilitarianism that we now turn.\n \nContractualism is an impartial moral theory. In contemporary moral\nphilosophy, the main impartial moral theory outside the social\ncontract tradition is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes\npersons’ moral status to be grounded on their capacity for\nwell-being and suffering, and takes well-being to be the sole moral\nvalue. It takes the appropriate response to this value to be to\npromote it. Utilitarianism is thus a consequentialist moral\ntheory—morality is concerned with bringing about valuable\noutcomes. \nThere are three fundamental contrasts between contractualism and\nutilitarianism. The first difference is one of scope. (1)\nUtilitarianism applies to every area of morality, while contractualism\ncovers only the realm of what we owe to one another. Scanlon himself\nacknowledges that this is not the whole of morality. We return to this\ndifference in sections\n 12\n and\n 13. \nThe remaining two differences between contractualism and\nutilitarianism relate to content. (2) Contractualism does not\naggregate, but rather focuses on the standpoint of individual\npersons. (3) Contractualism does not regard well-being as a basic\nmoral concept, but instead allows a variety of personal reasons. \nThe only reasons for and against a principle that count when we are\njudging whether or not it can be reasonably rejected are\n“various individuals’ reasons for objecting to that\nprinciple and alternatives to it” (Scanlon 1998, p. 229). The\nacceptability of a principle depends on a one-by-one assessment of the\nstrength of the reasons that individuals would have for rejecting the\nprinciple, compared to the alternatives to it. Since individuals must\nbe objecting on their own behalf and not on behalf of a group, this\nrestriction to single individuals’ reasons bars the\ninterpersonal aggregation of complaints; it does not allow a number of\nlesser complaints to outweigh one person’s weightier\ncomplaint. \nUnlike utilitarianism, therefore, contractualism rejects the\ninterpersonal aggregation of burdens. (We discuss some important\nexceptions below.) This is one of the main respects in which it\ndiffers from utilitarianism. Contractualism thus captures a key\nfeature of our moral life that, as Rawls famously argues,\nutilitarianism ignores: the feature he calls “the separateness\nof persons” (Rawls 1971). Instead of lumping everyone together\nand allowing one person’s rights to be trampled to provide\ngreater aggregate benefits to others, contractualism recognises that\neach of us has a unique life to live. Contractualism therefore seeks\nprinciples that benefit each person individually and that command each\nperson’s free assent. \nAggregation (in some form) is essential to utilitarianism. Situations\nfrequently arise where one person’s pleasure is in conflict with\nanother’s, or where the only way to secure one person’s\npleasure is to cause someone else pain, or where we must choose which\nperson suffers which pain. We must find a way to balance the moral\nreasons generated by different people’s pleasures and pains. If\nwe retain a utilitarian perspective, then it is hard to see how we can\ndo this without some kind of aggregation—adding different\npleasures and pains together. \nBy contrast, contractualism seems able to avoid aggregation, because\nit begins, not with individual pleasure and pain, but with the more\nflexible concept of reasons. Unlike my pleasures and pains, my reasons\ncan be responsive to the situation of others. To see this, we explore\ntwo features of Scanlon’s use of reasons: rejection must be\nreasonable, and reasons are not limited to well-being. \nIn order to reasonably reject a principle, I must have some objection\nto it. This objection may begin with some direct harm I suffer as a\nresult of the principle. So far, if the harm involved is pain or\nsuffering, contractualism mirrors utilitarianism. However, the fact\nthat a principle impacts negatively on me is not sufficient.\nTo know whether I can reasonably reject the principle, I must\nalso ask how it impacts on others. If a principle imposes a certain\nburden (b1) on me, but every alternative imposes a greater\nburden (b2) on someone else, then b1 does not give\nme a reason to reject the principle. If I am reasonable, then I\nwithdraw my objection when I see that your reason is more pressing.\n(By contrast, it would make no sense to say that a utilitarian has\n‘withdrawn her pain’ because she has noticed that someone\nelse’s pain is greater.) So we conclude that the principle\nimposing b1 on me cannot be reasonably rejected. And we reach\nthis conclusion without having to aggregate anything. \nIn contractualism, individuals are motivated both by self-regard and\nby respect for others. Since each person is partly motivated by\nconcern for her own interests, contractualism can ground\nconsequentialist reasons. Part of what we owe others is to promote\ntheir interests. Contractualism can therefore accommodate important\nconsequentialist aspects of the structure of moral thought. \nUnlike utilitarianism, however, the account of value underlying\ncontractualism does not claim that there is only one rational attitude\nto have towards value. So contractualism can accommodate\nconsequentialist aspects without being a completely consequentialist\ntheory. (This represents an advantage of contractualism over\nnaïve versions of Kantian ethics, which reject all\nconsequentialist reasons and thus make it very difficult to explain\nwhy the consequences of our actions have any moral significance at\nall.) In contrast to an outcome ethics (such as utilitarianism), what\nis foundational for contractualism is not minimising what is\nundesirable, but considering what principles no-one could reasonably\nreject. Moral principles are grounded in the idea of living with\nothers on terms of mutual respect. This means that as well as\naccommodating some consequentialist aspects, contractualism can also\naccommodate certain deontological intuitions: commonsense prohibitions\nagainst treating persons in certain ways even in circumstances in\nwhich the aggregate value of the consequences of doing so is very\ngreat. Which prohibitions are justified? This question “is best\nanswered by considering what principles licensing others to take our\nlives could be reasonably rejected” (Scanlon 1998, p. 85). Among\nthese principles might be ones that involve “accepting a certain\nview of the reasons one has: that the positive value of saving others\ndoes not justify killing someone” (Scanlon 1998, p. 84). \nA further resource available to contractualism that is not available\nto utilitarianism is that my reasons for rejecting a principle are not\nlimited to my well-being—however broadly that notion is\nconstrued. For ease of exposition, let us for the moment follow the\nutilitarian, and think of ‘burdens’ solely in terms of\nnegative impact on my well-being. My reason for rejecting a principle\nmight be, not so much that it imposes a certain burden on me, but the\nway in which it imposes that burden—and what the principle thus\nsays about me. For instance, consider a principle that allocates\nbenefits and burdens on the basis of race, and contrast this with a\nprinciple that allocates the same benefits and burdens randomly. I\ncannot reject the racist principle simply because of the burden it\nimposes on me—after all, the random principle imposes an\nidentical burden on someone else. Rather, I reject the racist\nprinciple because, by regarding my race as a relevant ground for the\ndistribution of benefits, it imposes that burden in a way that\nconstitutes a failure to respect my status as a person. \nIf we abandon the utilitarian link between burdens and well-being,\nthen we might say that the method of distribution of burdens itself\nimposes an additional burden of a different kind—the burden of\nnot being respected. Similarly, I might reject a principle that\narbitrarily exempts some people from a burden borne by everyone else,\non the grounds that such a principle treats me unfairly—even if\nthe alternative is a principle that places that burden on everyone.\nFor instance, imagine a situation where, in order to preserve the\ngrass, we need at least 90% of the people to avoid walking on the\ngrass, but it doesn’t do any harm if 10% do walk on the grass. I\nmight object to a principle that allows the members of a privileged\nracial minority to walk on the grass, even if my preferred principle\nis one where no-one gets to enjoy grass-walking. My rejection is not\nbased on envy, but on the disrespect this principle shows by regarding\nrace as a legitimate ground for distribution. \nContractualist reasons are more flexible than\naggregation, as they allow us to respond directly to morally\nrelevant considerations, rather than having to rely upon some complex\nutilitarian calculation. (Think of the artificial epicycles a\nutilitarian needs to go through to reject a principle that efficiently\nmaximises happiness, but happens to be racist or arbitrary.) By moving\nstraight to the moral heart of the matter, contractualism also seems\nto offer a more satisfying explanation of why certain\nbehaviour is wrong. \nContractualism can thus produce principles that balance the interests\nof different people against one another, without explicit appeal to\naggregation. This is a significant development in moral philosophy, as\nit enables us to separate arguments against utilitarianism into two\nclasses: arguments against impartiality and arguments against\naggregation. Objections in the first class also apply to\ncontractualism, while those in the second class do not. We return to\naggregation in\n section 8;\n and consider one common objection to impartiality in\n section 9.\n Once contractualism has entered the field, we cannot treat arguments\nfor impartiality as if they were arguments for utilitarianism\nitself. \nAlthough it is not solely devoted to contractualism, Scanlon’s\n2008 book Moral Dimensions: Permissibility, Meaning, Blame.\naddresses several issues of relevance to Scanlonian contractualism,\nnotably the irrelevance of intent for judgements of permissibility,\nthe distinction between two kinds of responsibility, and the analysis\nof blame. These issues help to differentiate contractualism from some\nof its non-consequentialist rivals. \nMany theorists distinguish non-consequentialist moral theories from\nconsequentialist rivals such as utilitarianism by emphasising the\nsignificance of agents’ intentions. Otherwise\npermissible acts become impermissible when done for the wrong reason\nor in pursuit of the wrong aim. For instance, the doctrine of\ndouble effect forbids actions that aim at the death of an\ninnocent person either as an end or as a means to an end, even when\nthe same result could be permissible as a side-effect. Consider two\nfamiliar examples: \nDrug: “If the limited amount of a drug that is\navailable could be used either to save one patient or to save five\nothers, it is permissible to give it to the five, even though the one\nwill die. But it would not be permissible to withhold the same drug\nfrom the same person in order to save the five others by transplanting\nhis organs into them after he is dead.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 1) \nMilitary Target: “Many people believe that in war it\ncan be permissible to bomb a military target even though this will\nalso cause the deaths of some noncombatants living nearby, but that it\nwould not be permissible to bomb the same number of noncombatants in\norder to hasten the end of the war by demoralizing the\npopulation.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 2) \nDespite its intuitive appeal, Scanlon rejects the doctrine of double\neffect, arguing that intention is not directly relevant to\npermissibility. Scanlon concedes that intentions have\npredictive significance – they help predict\nhow an agent will perform an action, and whether she is\nlikely to succeed in performing the action or in implementing any\nlarger plan of which this action might be a part. But such predictions\nare only indirectly relevant to judgements of permissibility. Scanlon\nalso agrees that intentions matter when assessing how an agent has\ndeliberated on a given occasion. But they are not relevant to\njudgements of permissibility, which ask instead\n“whether an agent may perform an action of a certain\nkind.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 2.) \nDrawing on the work of Judith Thomson (Thomson 1986, pp.\n101–102), Scanlon argues that a focus on intention can lead to\nimplausible conclusions about permissibility. Consider two familiar\nthought experiments. \nLoop: “In the well-known trolley-problem case it seems\npermissible to switch a runaway trolley onto a sidetrack on which it\nwill hit only one person rather than allow it to continue straight\nahead and hit five. But it also seems permissible to switch the\ntrolley in [Thomson’s] Loop case … in which the sidetrack\nloops around and rejoins the main line, so that if the trolley does\nnot hit the one person and thereby come to a stop, it will continue\naround the loop and hit the five.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 18.) \nDoctor:“Suppose that a patient is fatally ill and in\ngreat pain. The only course of medication that will relieve this pain\nwill also cause the patient’s death. Suppose that the patient\nwants to be given this drug. Does the permissibility of administering\nit depend on the doctor’s intention in doing so?” (Scanlon\n2008, p. 19.) \nMost people agree that switching the trolley is permissible in Loop\neven though “one switches the trolley only because it will, by\nhitting the one person, be prevented from hitting the five”.\n(Scanlon 2008, p. 18) But this verdict clearly violates the doctrine\nof double effect. Most also agree that it is permissible for the\ndoctor to administer the drug whatever his intention – whether\nto relieve the patient’s pain, to hasten her death and thus end\nher suffering, or even to hasten the patient’s death in order to\ninherit her wealth. This last intention affects our evaluation of the\ndoctor’s character and deliberation. But it does not render his\naction impermissible. “What makes an action wrong is\nthe consideration or considerations that count decisively against it,\nnot the agent’s failure to give these considerations the proper\nweight.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 23) \nFor the contractualist, justification to others provides the standard\nthat determines which considerations count decisively against\nparticular actions. In transplant cases, the contractualist question\nis whether the possibility of saving lives via transplant justifies an\nexception to the general duty to aid one’s patients. Scanlon\nargues that it does not do so, because a principle permitting such an\nexception could reasonably be rejected by prospective patients. If\ndoctors withhold treatment because they intend to transplant their\npatients’ organs, then this intention is wrongful because the\nact intended is wrong, and not vice versa. \nIt is worth noting that, while most philosophers who discuss Thomson’s\nLoop share Scanlon’s intuition that switching the trolley is\npermissible, this agreement is not unanimous. For instance, Liao et al.\n2012 argue that actual intuitions about Loop cases are highly variable\nand dependent on the context of presentation, and therefore that moral\ntheorists should be wary of putting too much weight on such\nintuitions. Scanlon could take this criticism on board, as his\ncontractualist framework is not wedded to any specific conclusion\nabout Loop. But he would then need to find other cases to illustrate\nhis general claims about the significance of intention.  \nWhile they are not relevant for permissibility, intentions do affect\nthe meaning of actions, and thereby affect the ways that it is\nappropriate for others to respond to the agent. This brings us to\nScanlon’s discussions of blame and responsibility. Scanlon\ndistinguishes two forms of responsibility. \n(1) Moral reaction responsibility is relevant when we ask\ncertain positive or negative moral reactions to a person – such\nas blame, resentment, praise, or gratitude – are appropriate.\nIntuitively, “what a person has done makes such reactions\nappropriate only if the person was responsible for behaving in this\nway” (Scanlon 2015, pp. 89–90). Scanlon originally called\nthis “responsibility as attribution”, but he has come to\nprefer the label “moral reaction responsibility”. \n(2) Substantive responsibility is relevant when we ask\nwhether a person’s actions change her obligations to others, and\ntheir obligations to him or her. “Making a promise, handing over\nsome money, taking a risk, or choosing not to avail oneself of an\nopportunity can change a person’s obligations to others, and\ntheirs to him or her, if the person is responsible for doing these\nthings.” (Scanlon 2015, pp. 89–90) We return to the\ncontractualist account of substantive responsibility in section\n10. \nThe central question for the contractualist account of moral reaction\nresponsibility is “what must be true for an agent to be\nidentified with a particular attitude, and thus eligible for moral\nresponses such as praise and blame”. (Kumar 2015, p. 251) In the\nbackground, of course, lie traditional puzzles about free-will and\ndeterminism. Can agents fairly be blamed for actions or attitudes\nwhose ultimate causes lie beyond their control? It seems unfair to\nevaluate someone negatively for something she could not control. For\nthe contractualist, however, blame goes beyond mere evaluation. Blame\nis intimately linked to both the meaning of actions and our\nrelationships with others. “The meaning of our\ninteractions with others depends on what they see as the reasons\ngoverning those interactions. … we have reasons not to have\nattitudes of friendship or trust toward people whose attitudes toward\nus make these attitudes inappropriate.” (Scanlon 2015, p.\n93) \nFor Scanlon, a person is blameworthy if her action shows\nsomething about her attitudes toward others that impairs the relations\nthey can have with her. I blame you if both (a) I judge you\nto be blameworthy, and (b) I take my relationship with you to be\nmodified in a way that this judgement of impaired relations holds to\nbe appropriate. (Scanlon 2008, pp. 128–9) Appropriate blame\nreactions include withdrawal of trust and decreased readiness to enter\ninto special relationships such as friendship or to help the person\nwith his projects. (Scanlon 2015, p. 92) \nSuppose I discover that my close friend Joe laughed at cruel jokes at\nmy expense at last week’s party. (Scanlon 2008, pp.\n129–30) Joe’s behaviour clearly reveals attitudes that are\ninconsistent with friendship. I may therefore conclude that my\nrelationship with Joe is impaired, and adjust my own attitudes or\nbehaviour accordingly. \nContractualist blame thus only makes sense within a relationship, such\nas friendship or family relationships. Impairment must be judged\nagainst the standard of what is appropriate within that\nrelationship. This raises an obvious problem. What\nrelationship could possibly ground judgements of\nblameworthiness and reactions of blame in the general moral case?\nSuppose a stranger steals my bag as I walk down the street.\nIntuitively, I can blame her. But what is my relationship to her?\n“Do we have a relationship with every total stranger whom it\nmakes sense to blame?” (Scanlon 2008, p. 138) Scanlon replies\nthat we do. \n“The contractualist claim is that all persons stand in a\nparticular kind of relationship to one another, the ideal form of\nwhich realizes a distinct value, that of mutual recognition.”\n(Kumar 2015, p. 258) This idea sounds odd if we imagine a moral\nrelationship that is analogous to actual relationships such\nas a particular friendship. Contractualists instead treat the moral\nrelationship as “a normative ideal, like a normative ideal of\nfriendship that specifies attitudes and expectations that we should\nhave regarding one another. … morality requires that we hold\ncertain attitudes toward one another simply in virtue of the fact that\nwe stand in the relation of ‘fellow rational\nbeings’.” (Scanlon 2008, pp. 139–40) There are some\nbasic attitudes that we expect even from total strangers,and we are\nentitled to blame them if their behaviour demonstrates a lack of those\nattitudes. \nWithin contractualism, the idea of a universal moral relationship\nunifies the impersonal judgement that someone has failed to act on\nprinciples that no-one could reasonably reject with the personal\nreactions that characterise blame. Suppose I witness your bag being\nstolen. We both judge that you have been wronged. These judgements\nrest on “the general claim that it is impermissible for one\nperson to relate to another in the way she has in the type of\nsituation we find ourselves in.” (Kumar 2015, p. 260) But when\nyou blame the perpetrator, you do something much more\npersonal, by also raising “an objection to her attitudes toward\nyou in particular, and what they say about your relationship.”\n(Kumar 2015, p. 260) \nSome betrayals are so severe that they bring a friendship to an end.\nThe relationship cannot survive. Similarly, moral retributivists argue\nthat some horrendous actions can sever the moral relationship itself,\ncasting the person out of the sphere of mutual recognition that\ncharacterises morality. Contractualists disagree. “Even those\nwho have no regard for the justifiability of their actions toward\nothers retain their basic moral rights … not to be hurt or\nkilled, to be helped when they are in dire need, and to have us honour\npromises we have made to them.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 142)\nInstead,“blame … involves a suspension … of\none’s readiness to enter into … the range of interactions\nwith others that are morally important but not owed unconditionally to\neveryone”. (Scanlon 2008, pp. 142–3) For instance, I might\nrefuse to make agreements with an untrustworthy person, to enter into\nother specific relations that involve trust and reliance, or to\nvoluntarily assist her pursuit of her projects even when I can do so\nat little cost to myself. \nScanlon’s contractualist account of blame sets aside issues of\nfreewill and determinism. Because blame is a reaction to the attitudes\na person actually has, it is not undermined by the discovery that he\n“had no control over the factors that made him the kind of\nperson that he is.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 178) Even if you cannot\nhelp being callous, unreliable, and untrustworthy, I cannot be\nexpected to continue to treat you as if you had not revealed that, for\nwhatever reason, that is the kind of person you are. \nBefore turning to problems for contractualism, we first address a\nchallenge to its distinctiveness. In On What Matters, Derek\nParfit argues that rule consequentialism, contractualism, and the best\ninterpretation of Kant’s moral theory all coincide. The result\nis a triple theory, according to which “an act is wrong just\nwhen such acts are disallowed by some principle that is optimific,\nuniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable”\n(Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 413). As contractualism presents itself as\nan alternative to both consequentialism and Kant, this would be a very\nsignificant result. \nThe convergence argument explicitly deals, not with Scanlon’s\nown theory, but with “what I believe to be the best version of\nScanlonian contractualism” (Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 412).\nParfit defends two key ‘improvements’, by rejecting two\nrestrictions that Scanlon places on the reasons that can be offered\nfor rejecting a moral principle, namely: \nIn other words, the convergence argument replaces Scanlon’s\noriginal formulation of contractualism, where all reasons for\nrejection must be the personal complaints of specific individuals,\nwith a more impersonal version. \nIn\n section 2,\n we noted a number of differences between Kantian and Scanlonian\ncontractualism. Despite these differences, Parfit argues that\nScanlonian contractualism coincides with the best interpretation of\nKant. In a cumulative argument spread over several chapters, Parfit\nargues that the best interpretation of Kant’s moral ideas yields\nthe following claim: \nEven if we accept the convergence of Kant and rule consequentialism,\nit still remains to be shown that these optimific and uniquely\nuniversally willable principles are the only set of principles that\nno-one could reasonably reject. The key step in this second prong of\nthe convergence argument is the claim that “when there is only\none relevant principle that everyone could rationally choose, no\none’s objection to this principle could be as strong as the\nstrongest objection to every alternative” (Parfit 2011, volume\n2, p. 245). \nThis key claim seems open to obvious counter-examples—cases\nwhere contractualism seems to diverge from rule consequentialism. Most\nstriking are those cases where “we can either save one person\nfrom some great burden, or give much smaller benefits to many other\npeople, who are all much better-off” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p.\n246).  \nProponents of the convergence argument must somehow explain away these\napparent counter-examples. Following Parfit, they will first will\ndivide such cases into two classes. In some cases, the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles instruct us to favour the individual.\nConsider Scanlon’s own example where we must choose between\nelectrifying an innocent person and disrupting millions of\npeople’s enjoyment of a televised sporting event (Scanlon 1998,\np. 235). Here, many rule consequentialists will argue that the\noptimific rules do instruct us to save the innocent person. If so, the\nconvergence between rule consequentialism and contractualism is\nstraightforward. In its contest with rule consequentialism,\ncontractualism cannot draw its intuitive appeal from such cases. \nWe must turn, then, to those cases where the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles do instruct us to provide the smaller\nbenefits to many others. Here, the convergence argument must deny that\nthe solitary individual can reasonably reject the optimific\nprinciples. This is where Parfit’s ‘improvements’ on\ncontractualism are vital to the convergence argument. As originally\nformulated, contractualism departs from utilitarianism by allowing the\nindividual to reject the optimific principles whenever they place a\ngreater burden on her than her favoured principle places on\nany other single individual. Proponents of the convergence argument\nwill favour instead a more impersonal formulation. While the\nindividual’s own complaint is left undiminished, other people\ncan now reject her principle on impersonal\ngrounds—precisely because it fails to maximise everyone’s\nwell-being. Faced with these impersonal reasons, the single individual\ncannot reasonably reject the optimific principles. \nDespite its provocative claims, the convergence argument is, in one\nrespect, quite modest. It does not set out to prove that rule\nconsequentialism, Kantian ethics and contractualism necessarily\ncoincide. Rather, the conclusion is merely that plausible versions of\nthe three theories do not necessarily conflict. For this\nmodest purpose, it would be sufficient to construct one plausible\nversion of contractualism on which the optimific principles cannot\nreasonably be rejected. \nThere is a methodological issue here. In his presentation of the\nconvergence argument, Parfit tests competing versions of\ncontractualism against intuitions regarding specific idealised cases.\nThis is not a peculiarity of Parfit’s own presentation. Without\nintuitions of this kind, the convergence argument cannot get off the\nground. Proponents of individualist formulations of contractualism\nmight reply that, in some key cases, Parfit’s intuitions are not\nneutral benchmarks, but rather reflect the considered moral judgements\nof a consequentialist mind. This leaves it open to Contractualists to\nsimply stick to their guns—and argue that their view is\ndistinctive at the normative level, as well as the meta-ethical\nlevel. \nCommenting on Parfit’s earlier claim that the best\ninterpretation of Kant coincides with the best form of rule\nconsequentialism, Scanlon observes that “the degree to which\nParfit’s conclusion should seem surprising depends to a certain\nextent on how close the theories he is discussing are to\nKant’s” (Scanlon 2011, p. 117). Similar remarks apply to\nthe convergence argument. The appeal of contractualism is that it\npresents a genuine alternative to both consequentialism and Kantian\nethics. Those who are attracted to contractualism because, in certain\nkey cases, it coheres with distinctively non-utilitarian intuitions,\nare likely to regard the impersonal contractualism deployed in the\nconvergence argument as an abandonment of the core commitments of\ncontractualism. The convergence argument would then be of limited\nrelevance. We return to these issues below, when we consider the\nIndividual and Impersonal Restrictions in more detail. (See sections\n 8,\n 9, and\n 13.) \nParfit’s convergence argument has not attracted as much\nattention as other aspects of either his work or Scanlon’s. (One\nexception is Kumar 2011.) However, the general issue of the\nrelationship between contractualism and consequentialism is very\nrelevant to a number of objections to contractualism. It is always\nworth arking whether contractualism can cope adequately with new\nchallenges (such as aggregation, substantive responsibility, risk, or\nfuture people) without collapsing into rule consequentialism. \nThe remainder of this entry examines problem cases for contractualism.\nThe first two concern the logical structure of\ncontractualism—asking whether its account of wrongness is either\ncircular or incomplete. The next four are puzzle cases where the most\nobvious interpretation of contractualism seems to yield implausible\nresults. The last two are groups who should be included in the scope\nof morality, but who seem to be left out by contractualism: animals\nand future people. \nAs we saw in section 3.2, contractualism allows for the reasonable\nrejection of principles on grounds other than their direct impact on\nthe individual’s well-being. However, this appeal to reasons\nbeyond well-being brings out a common objection to\ncontractualism—that the whole apparatus of reasonable rejection\nis redundant. The objection is as follows. Contractualism says\nx is wrong if and only if x is forbidden by\nprinciples no-one can reasonably reject. Anyone can reasonably reject\na principle on the grounds that it permits actions that are wrong. So\na principle that no-one can reasonably reject is a principle that\npermits no actions that are wrong. If we don’t already know\nwhich actions are wrong, then we cannot use the contractualist\napparatus. But if we do already know which actions are wrong, then we\ndon’t need to use it. \nThere is a related objection using ‘unfair’ instead of\n‘wrong’. Suppose, following our previous discussion in\n section 3,\n we agree that contractualism allows ‘because it treats me\nunfairly’ to count as a reason for rejecting a principle. We\nthen face the challenge that our judgments of unfairness are doing all\nthe real moral work, as contractualism now says that a principle is\nwrong if and only if it treats someone unfairly. \nTo respond to this objection, contractualists must explain why\n‘x is wrong’ and ‘x is\nunfair’ are not the sort of claims that can feature as a reason\nfor rejecting a principle. They must also demonstrate that admitting\nreasons not based directly on well-being does not commit us to\nadmitting ‘x is wrong’ and ‘x is\nunfair’. \nThe Contractualist answer appeals to the conceptual link between\nwrongness and justification. Whether an act is wrong depends, not only\non its direct impact on individuals, but also on whether a principle\npermitting it can be justified to all concerned. ‘Because it is\nwrong’ is not the kind of reason that can be fed into the\ncontractualist apparatus, since it is not something that happens to\nindividuals. Instead, wrongness is something that is constructed out\nof individuals’ reasons using that very apparatus. The same goes\nfor ‘because it is unfair’. In the example of the racist\nprinciple introduced in section 3.2, I reject the principle, not\nbecause it treats me unfairly overall, but because it illicitly places\nweight on an inappropriate moral distinction. My complaint\nconcerns how a principle treats me. To know whether an action\nis wrong, we must compare different people’s complaints, which\nwe do by comparing one principle’s treatment of me with the way\nalternative principles treat others. \nAn advantage of contractualism is that it can capture the wide range\nof considerations that are relevant to moral deliberation. All the\nconsiderations that provide individuals with reasonable grounds for\nobjecting to a proposed principle are relevant. As we saw in section\n3.2, these considerations include more than the direct (and even the\nindirect) impact of a proposed principle on individual well-being.\nThis plurality of considerations is nevertheless unified by a\nsingle normative domain or subject matter: unjustifiability. \nSome opponents of contractualism will object that contractualism is\nnot pluralist enough. They will object to the unified account of\nwrongness. Is it plausible that all the considerations relevant to\nwhat we owe to each other are unified by their relevance to whether\nthe principle permitting the conduct could be reasonably rejected? In\nour moral deliberation about right and wrong actions, are all moral\nconsiderations only relevant in virtue of how they affect whether or\nnot a principle licensing the proposed action is justifiable? \nTake for example, the claim that it is wrong to inflict gratuitous\nsuffering on persons, and sentient beings in general. Imagine someone\ntorturing someone else. A utilitarian will object that, in our grasp\nof the wrongness of the action, the most salient fact is that the\nbehaviour would inflict gratuitous suffering. This is much more\nsalient than the fact that the person could reasonably reject a\nprinciple permitting such conduct. The utilitarian concludes that\nmorality is fundamentally about the avoidance of suffering. A\npluralist will conclude instead that morality is irreducibly\nplural—some moral reasons are grounded on justifiability, but\nothers are grounded directly on suffering or pleasure. \nThe contractualist replies that what is most morally relevant in the\ncase of torture is that suffering is brought about through the\nagency of another—not just that suffering occurs. This is\nwhy being tortured is morally much worse than suffering similar\ninjuries through a lightning strike—the former is an affront to\nmy human dignity in a way that the latter is not. If we agree that\nthis is the really significant fact, then the advantage now lies with\nthe contractualist, whose moral theory explicitly gives a central\nplace to the notion of agency. (As ever, the dialectic can continue,\nas utilitarians can reply that torture is morally worse than a\nlightning strike because it involves a gross failure of benevolence).\nFor a foundational consequentialist account of morality (such as\nutilitarianism), the wrongness of the action is based solely and\ndirectly on the suffering it would cause. Against such an account, the\ncontractualist argues that the moral importance of promoting\nwell-being is always mediated via its effect on the justifiability of\nthe relevant principle: if an action fails to show sufficient concern\nfor someone’s well-being then that person has strong grounds for\nobjecting to the principle. \nIt is, furthermore, important to recall that contractualism deals in\n‘could reasonably reject’ not in ‘does\nreject’. Contractualism does not say that gratuitously causing\nsuffering is not wrong until someone objects to it, or that\ngratuitously causing suffering would not be wrong at all if\nno-one happened to object to it. There is nothing accidental about the\nfact that a particular act of gratuitously causing suffering is wrong.\nRather, gratuitously causing suffering is always intrinsically\nwrong—because it is (always and everywhere) the kind of thing\nthat provides grounds for reasonable rejection. \nContractualism and consequentialism thus gloss what is objectionable\nabout the same conduct in different ways. Instead of a decisive\nintuition that counts against contractualism, we have a case of\ndistinctive intuitions, where different theorists, beginning from\ndifferent intuitive starting points, end up with different theoretical\npriorities.  We saw earlier that, unlike utilitarianism, contractualism rejects\naggregation. However, there are some cases where\ncontractualism’s aversion to aggregation seems to lead to\nundesirable results. (For a variety of contractualist responses to\naggregation, see Reibetanz 1998, Norcross 2002, Kumar 2011, Fried\n2012a. See also sections 9 and 12, as contractualists and their\nopponents often discuss aggregation alongside either demandingness or\nrisk.) \nConsider the following situation, drawn from a\nfamous article by John Taurek (Taurek 1977). \nThe Rocks. Six innocent swimmers have become trapped on two\nrocks by the incoming tide. Five of the swimmers are on one rock,\nwhile the last swimmer is on the second rock. Each swimmer will drown\nunless they are rescued. You are the sole life-guard on duty. You have\ntime to get to one rock in your patrol-boat and save everyone on it.\nBecause of the distance between the rocks, and the speed of the tide,\nyou cannot get to both rocks in time. What should you do? \nSuppose you decide to save the lone swimmer on the second rock.\nIntuitively, this seems wrong. Surely you should have saved five\npeople instead of one. The challenge for contractualism is to explain\nwhy what you did is wrong. Utilitarians have a straightforward answer,\nbased on aggregation. You should save the five people instead of the\none simply because five deaths is a worse result than one death. This\ncase is tricky for contractualism because it rejects aggregation. The\nfive people will each want to reject the principle that\nallows you to save the one, by appealing to the fact that such a\nprinciple leaves them to die. But the lone person on the second rock\nwill want to reject any principle that allows you to save the five.\nAnd the reason for objecting to the principle is exactly the same in\neach case—this principle leaves that person to die. The\nfive people cannot appeal to the fact that there are more of\nthem—because this is not an individual reason. (Suppose you are\none of the five. The fact that four other people will die is not\nsomething you can object to, as it is not something that happens to\nyou.) It therefore looks as if we have reached a stalemate—and\nperhaps the best solution (the principle that no-one can reasonably\nreject) is to toss a coin. That way, each of the six people gets a\nfifty-fifty chance of survival. No-one can reasonably reject\nthis principle on the grounds that it only gives\nthem a fifty-fifty chance of survival, because any alternative gives\nsomeone even less chance. Tossing a coin is the only principle that\nguarantees everyone at least a fifty-fifty chance. So it is\nthe only principle that no-one can reasonably reject. \nOne contractualist response is to bite the bullet, and accept that\ncoin tossing is the right answer. Many contractualists, however, wish\nto capture the intuition that you ought to save the five. Recall that\nan agent’s reason for rejecting a principle can be based, not on\nits effect on her well-being, but on what that principle says about\nher or how it treats her. Imagine one of the five swimmers on the\nfirst rock arguing as follows: “Coin tossing is clearly the\nright principle if there is one person on each rock, as it balances\ntheir competing reasons. If you apply the same principle when there\nare five on this rock, you are saying it makes no difference that\nthere are five rather than one. So you are acting exactly as if I\nwasn’t here, facing this life and death situation. A principle\nthat allows you—in effect—to ignore my plight in this way\ndoesn’t show respect for me. If there were one person on each\nrock, their claims to be rescued would cancel out. So we then look to\nsee whether there are other people on either rock. There are several\nsuch people, and I am one of them. My claim to be rescued remains\nun-trumped. So you should rescue the five.” (For a critique of\nthis argument, see Otsuka 2001.) \nA further difficult kind of case for contractualism is where the\nburdens that different persons stand to suffer are unequal—and\nso cannot balance each other and cancel each other out—but are\nstill very severe in each case. The following example is suggested by\nDerek Parfit’s discussion of contractualism and aggregation\n(Parfit 2003). Consider a choice between two scenarios. In the first,\none person suffers agony for a hundred years; while in the second a\nmillion people suffer agony for a hundred years minus a day. An\nadditional day of agony is a considerable burden. Therefore if we\nconsider the situation from the perspective of the single individuals\ninvolved, it would seem that the first person’s complaint\n(‘I will suffer for a hundred years’) outweighs the\ncomplaint of any other single individual (‘I will suffer for a\nhundred years minus a day’). However, a utilitarian would argue\nthat, in this case, the second scenario is worse. \nA utilitarian might conclude that, while this ideal of choosing a\nscenario that is acceptable to each person from his or her personal\npoint of view is extremely appealing, it is not always attainable. In\nparticular, this ideal is not practical when we cannot avoid placing a\nsevere burden on at least one person. Contractualism focuses each\nperson’s mind on the burdens imposed on himself or herself, and\non other individuals—and invites us to withdraw our burdens if\nwe see other individuals suffering much more under a competing\nprinciple. However, in our present example, each of the individuals in\nthe second scenario would find the situation unacceptable from their\npersonal point of view, simply because of the magnitude of the\nsuffering it involves. It is not plausible that they would withdraw\ntheir complaint because the person in the first scenario stands to\nsuffer a slightly greater burden. It can be argued that in such cases\nwe should give intrinsic moral weight to the number of persons who\nsuffer a severe burden and so minimise the number of persons for whom\nthe situation is unacceptable. \nThe contractualist has several possible replies. They could simply\ndeny the utilitarian’s intuition. Perhaps it is wrong to impose\na greater burden on a single person, even to save many others from a\nslightly worse burden. Contractualists who want to capture the\nutilitarian’s intuition might argue that, just as complaints are\nnot always tied to well-being, the strength of an individual’s\ncomplaint need not be proportional to the loss of well-being. Perhaps\na principle that allows me to suffer for a century minus a day is just\nas objectionable to me as one that allows me to suffer for a century.\nOnce the complaints are on a par, we can then appeal to our earlier\ntie-breaking method, and conclude that it is wrong to favour the one\nover the many. (A utilitarian will reply that in any context a day of\nagony is an enormous moral burden—it is no less bad if the\nperson has already suffered for almost a century—so that the\ncomplaint of the individual in the first scenario has to be seen as\nsignificantly greater than that of any individual in the second\nscenario.) \nIn chapter 21 of On What Matters, Parfit presents further\narguments that can be deployed against the individualist\nrestriction—which limits the grounds for rejecting a principle\nto its implications for single people. First, Parfit presents\na series of cases where, he argues, “any contractualism that\nincorporates the individualist restriction must conflict with all\nplausible views about the distribution of benefits and burdens”\n(Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 198). One representative case is the\nfollowing (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 199–200): \nFollowing Parfit, utilitarians will object that, if we endorse the\nindividualist restriction, then “we ought to give Blue her 40\nmore years of life rather than giving 5 more years to Blue and to as\nmany as a million of these other people. … this is\nclearly false” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 200). \nSecond, Parfit offers a new argument that, when the individualist\nrestriction does enable the contractualist to reach the right\nconclusions, it cannot do so for the right reasons. Consider the\nfollowing case (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 196): \nHere, the utilitarian says that, if the number of other people exceeds\nten, then we should treat the others, as this maximises total\nwell-being. Parfit argues that “most of us would reject this\nutilitarian claim, believing instead that we ought to save Blue from\nher great ordeal. We might even believe that we ought to save Blue\nfrom her 100 days of pain rather than saving any number of\nsuch other people from their much smaller burden of 10 days of\npain” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 196–7). \nThe individualist restriction enables contractualism to diverge from\nutilitarianism in this case. Because the other people’s reasons\ncannot be aggregated, they cannot ever outweigh Blue’s reason.\nBut opponents of the individualist restriction will object that this\nis a coincidence. The real reason we should treat Blue is not because\nBlue’s burden would otherwise be greater, but because Blue would\notherwise be so much worse-off. For instance, suppose instead that, if\nwe do nothing, everyone (Blue included) will suffer 100 days of pain\n[This is Parfit’s Case Four]. We must now choose\nbetween relieving Blue of all of her 100 days, or relieving\neveryone (Blue included) of 10 of their 100 days of pain. Those who\nfavour a more impersonal formulation of contractualism will object\nthat the individualist restriction must instruct us to do the former.\n“And [this conclusion] is clearly false” (Parfit 2011,\nvolume 2, p. 202). \nIn Cases Four and Six, opponents of the individualist restriction will\nargue that we can only get the right result by allowing the other\npeople to pool their individual complaints—otherwise, they\ncannot hope to overrule Blue. Those who find this intuition compelling\nmay conclude that contractualists must drop the individualist\nrestriction, and instead accommodate Case Three by saying that\n“people have stronger moral claims, and stronger grounds to\nreject some principle, the worse off these people are” (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 202). Other contractualists may be prepared to bite\nthe bullet here, or to seek alternative ways to accommodate these\nintuitions, on the grounds that the individualist restriction is an\nessential feature of contractualism, without which contractualism\ncannot hope to escape the extreme and alienating demands of\nutilitarianism—the topic of the next section. \nImpartial theories are often accused of being unreasonably demanding.\nFor instance, consider the fact that there are very many very needy\npeople in the world. A variety of aid agencies, which currently rely\non donations from private individuals, can alleviate these needs. No\ndoubt governments, multinationals, and others could do far more than\nthey do. But the question still remains: faced with such urgent needs,\nat least some of which I could meet at comparatively little cost to\nmyself, how should I as an individual act? \nImpartial moral theories often seem to give very demanding answers to\nthis question. This is easiest to see for utilitarianism.\nUtilitarianism tells me to put my dollars wherever they will do the\nmost good. In the hands of a reputable aid agency, my dollar could\nsave a child from a crippling illness, and so I am obligated to donate\nit to the aid agency. I should give my next dollar to an aid agency,\nand I must keep donating till I reach the point where my own basic\nneeds, or my ability to keep earning dollars, are in jeopardy. Most of\nmy current activities will have to go. Nor will my sacrifice be only\nfinancial. According to utilitarianism, I should also spend my time\nwhere it will do most good. I should devote all my energies to aid\nwork, as well as all my money. \nPerhaps we would admire someone who behaved in this way. But is it\nplausible to claim that those of us who do not are guilty of\nwrongdoing; or that we have a moral obligation to devote all our\nresources to charity? Such conclusions strike many people as absurd.\nThis leads to the common objection that utilitarianism is unreasonably\ndemanding, as it leaves the agent too little room (time, resources,\nenergy) for her own projects or interests. \nThis is a serious objection to utilitarianism. If contractualism can\navoid a similar fate, then this will be a significant advantage. But\nis contractualism less demanding than utilitarianism? It certainly\nseems possible that contractualism will generate very demanding\nprinciples, as it seems reasonable for those who are starving to\nreject any principle permitting me to retain inessential resources\nrather than meeting their most basic needs. I would then be doing\nsomething wrong unless I do all that I can to save other\npeople’s lives—at least until I reach the level below\nwhich I would be giving up necessary components of my own\nwell-being. \nA similar problem for contractualism is presented by Thomas Nagel, who\nargues that, in the present state of the world, it may be impossible\nto construct any set of principles which no-one can\nreasonably reject. Any possible principle of aid will either make\nunreasonable demands on the affluent (from their point of view), or\npay inadequate attention to the basic needs of the destitute (from\ntheir point of view). If the notion of reasonable rejection is at\nleast partly determined by the agent’s own perspective, then any\nprinciple will be reasonably rejected by someone. (Nagel 1991 and\n1999). \nContractualists might reply that principles of aid presuppose some\nbackground set of entitlements, guaranteeing me the free use of my own\nresources. This raises two problems. The first is that, from the fact\nthat I own something, it does not follow that I do not have an\nobligation to give it away. The most that might follow is that others\nmay not force me to do so. The second problem is that, if our overall\ntheory is Contractualist, then the property rights themselves must be\ngiven a Contractualist justification. We need a system of property\nrights no-one can reasonably reject. Any system where property rights\nare very unequally distributed will be rejected by those who miss\nout. \nHow might contractualism reply to this demandingness objection? Like\nany impartial moral theory, contractualism can bite the bullet, and\nargue that morality is very demanding. The contractualist apparatus\nexplains why morality is demanding—if we seek to act in\na way that we could justify to others, then we must adopt principles\nthat no-one can reasonably reject. Given the state of the world, these\nprinciples will seem very demanding to those who are\naffluent—but the alternative would be principles that place an\neven greater burden on those who are worst-off. \nFor instance, Scanlon himself reaches the following principle through\ncontractualist reasoning: \nThis principle could make very significant demands, especially if we\nwere continually facing situations where a slight sacrifice would save\nsomeone’s life. If my sacrifice is much less than the very bad\nthing I prevent, it is hard to see how I can reasonably reject this\nprinciple. \nMore controversially, one of us has argued previously that analogous\nreasoning leads to an even more demanding principle. \nIf the ‘great sacrifice’ is nevertheless significantly\nless bad than the ‘very bad thing’ that might happen, it\nis hard to see how I can reasonably reject this principle. If the\n‘very bad thing’ is an agonising death, this principle can\nbe very demanding indeed. \nIt may be argued that even if this stringent principle follows from\ncontractualism, that is not a problem for the theory. Perhaps, in the\ncurrent state of the world, we should expect any moral theory grounded\non each person’s equal moral status to be extremely demanding,\ngiven the drastic and irrevocable impact on those in need if they are\nnot helped, and the fact that there are constantly so many in this\nposition (Ashford 2003, p. 292–2). \nHowever, many moral philosophers—contractualists\nincluded—seek a more moderate moral theory. If contractualism is\nto avoid being extremely demanding, the challenge is to stop short of\nthe stringent principle. We need to find a principle that allows me to\nchoose my own lesser good over a (significantly) greater good for\nsomeone else—and then to show that this principle cannot be\nreasonably rejected. For instance, suppose I spend my spare evening\n(and spare income) going to the movies rather than donating the time\nand money to a charity which could thus have saved someone’s\nlife. We need an explanation of why those who die as a result cannot\nreasonably reject the principle that permits this behaviour. \nThe most promising answer lies, once again, in the possibility that my\ngrounds for rejecting a principle are not necessarily confined to its\ndirect impact on my well-being. I might reject a principle requiring\nme to devote all my time and energy to charity, not simply because of\nthe burdens it imposes on me but because, in leaving me no room for my\nown personal projects, it fails to respect me as a person. (The\ndestitute person will reply that a principle allowing me to leave her\nto starve fails to respect her as a person. The challenge for the\ncontractualist is to distinguish these two complaints. For one\nattempt, see Kumar 2000.) \nResponding to Parfit’s presentation of the convergence argument,\nand his critique of the individualist and impersonal restrictions,\nScanlon notes that, because it rejects those restrictions, any\nimpersonal reformulation of contractualism is much more demanding than\nthe original formulation of contractualism (Scanlon 2011). This charge\nhas a particular dialectical significance, as rule consequentialists\noften present their theory as a more moderate alternative to the\nextreme demands of act consequentialism. If it retains those\nrestrictions, contractualism will always be less demanding than these\nalternative theories—even if its demands are greater than\ncommonsense morality might normally expect. \nQuestions of substantive responsibility arise when we must decide who\nwill bear what burdens. “To hold a person who has ended up\nburdened to be substantively responsible for that burden is to hold it\nto be hers to bear, ceteris paribus. No one owes it to her to share or\nalleviate it.” (Kumar 2015, p. 252) Kumar explains the\ncontractualist account of substantive responsibility as follows.\n“A person who ends up burdened is substantively responsible for\nit if no one owed it to her to do more to enable her to avert it. To\nhold her not to be wronged in ending up burdened just is to hold her\nto be substantively responsible for it. The reasons that are relevant\nto the justification of why she is not wronged are those that\nestablish that she has good reason to want what happens to her in that\ntype of situation to depend on how she responds to alternatives, and\nthat enough was done to secure that dependence.” (Kumar 2015, p.\n253) \nContractualism claims to offer an intuitive account of when agents can\nreasonably be expected to bear burdens. Critics argue that this\npromise is illusory and that contractualism fails to respect our\nintuitive judgements of substantive responsibility. (Williams 2006,\nVoorhoeve 2008.) \nDiscussion often focuses on the following example: \nHazardous Waste: A city’s officials need to remove and\ndispose of hazardous waste found near a residential area. This removal\nwill release some hazardous chemicals, but it is much less dangerous\nthan leaving the waste where it is. Even if the officials take all\nreasonable precautions, some hazardous material will be released\n– enough to cause lung damage to anyone directly exposed but not\nenough to pose a serious threat to anyone who stays indoors and away\nfrom the excavation site. (Scanlon 1998, p. 257; Kumar 2015, p.\n264) \nIntuitively, so long as they warn people to stay indoors while the\nwaste is being removed, the city officials can legitimately remove the\nhazardous waste. This does expose some people to a risk of serious\nharm. But all available alternatives are worse: the waste cannot be\nleft where it is, and evacuating the city is not feasible. A principle\npermitting officials to expose some people to a risk of harm in order\nto protect public health is one that no one can reasonably reject. \nSuppose the officials have done enough to reduce the risk. Leaflets\nhave been delivered to all households, announcements made on radio,\ntelevision, and social media, advertisements placed in newspapers,\nbarriers erected around the excavation site, warnings posted at all\nentrances, and so on. But now consider one citizen of the city (call\nher Curious), who is counter-suggestible. Warnings and barriers merely\nserve to pique her curiosity. Curious had no prior interest in\nhazardous waste. But she now develops a desire to see what all the\nfuss is about. Ignoring the warnings, Curious climbs over the barriers\nand exposes herself to a dangerous dose of hazardous chemicals. \nCurious’s burden results, in a fairly predictable way, from her\nown reckless choice. Intuitively, this renders her substantively\nresponsible for that burden. Curious cannot hold others responsible\nfor her burden. For instance, she cannot sue the city (or its\nofficials) to cover her medical costs. One natural explanation for\nthis intuition is the Forfeiture View: by disregarding\nwarnings, Curious has forfeited her right to expect others either to\navoid exposing her to harm or to alleviate her burden if she is\nharmed. \nScanlon rejects the Forfeiture View in favour of a Value of\nChoice account, which emphasises: “the reasons that\nindividuals have to want what happens to them, and their obligations\nto others and others’ obligations to them, to depend on how they\nrespond.” (Scanlon 2015, p. 106) On this view, it is the\navailability of choice that matters, not whether the agent\nhas made any actual choice. If I am told that I must collect\nmy theatre tickets by a certain time and I then absentmindedly fail to\ncollect them in time, then I am responsible for the fact that I miss\nthe performance. What matters is that I had the opportunity to avoid\nthis situation, even though I made no conscious decision. (Scanlon\n2015, p. 108) \nContractualist principles must be justified to each person. This\njustification must cite some reason why a given principle makes sense\nto that person. In the Hazardous Waste case, contractualists argue\nthat each person has reason to value living in a society where her\nfate depends (in part) on her own choices, even if the result is that\nshe sometimes finds herself responsible for burdens that she could\nhave avoided and has not conscious chosen. \nCritics argue that contractualists who cite the Value of Choice cannot\njustify intuitive principles in the Hazardous Waste case. The\nopportunity to choose is not valuable for Curious. On the\ncontrary, that opportunity clearly makes her worse-off! Consider the\nfollowing variant of the original case. \nCautionary vs Covert: Officials have two options for dealing\nwith hazardous waste. Under a Cautionary Policy, officials\nissue public warnings, erect barriers, and so on. Under a Covert\nPolicy, officials remove the waste in secret, depriving the\npublic of any knowledge of the risk. Suppose officials know that,\nwhile the Cautionary Policy will result in a larger number of lung\ndamage cases, every afflicted person will be someone who heard the\nwarnings and failed to heed them. By contrast, while the Covert Policy\nwill result in a smaller number of lung damage cases, none of\nthose people will have had any opportunity to avoid harm.\nWhich policy should the officials choose? (Williams 2006, p. 253;\nKumar 2015, p. 269) \nIntuitively, the officials should choose the Cautionary Policy instead\nof the Covert one, even though more people will suffer harm. Critics\nobject that contractualists using the Value of Choice cannot capture\nthis result. (Williams 2006). Consider Curious. The Covert Policy\noffers her greater protection from harm than the Cautionary Policy,\nbecause her chance of suffering harm is higher under the latter than\nunder the former. And because she is impetuously curious, warnings and\nother information have negative value for Curious. The opportunity to\nchoose only makes her worse-off. Therefore, Curious can reasonably\nreject the Cautionary Policy. \nContractualists agree that the Cautionary Policy is “the only\nmorally defensible choice” (Kumar 2015, p. 269). However, they\nargue that contractualism can deliver this result, for two reasons.\nFirst, even if the covert policy is instrumentally superior,\nall moral agents have strong symbolic reasons for “not\nwanting it to be permissible for public officials to hide important\ninformation because they decide that members of the public are not\ncompetent to assess it and respond appropriately” (Kumar 2015,\np. 270). Covert paternalism clearly fails to treat people as\nresponsible adults, and therefore everyone has reason to reject it.\nSecond, Contractualists will appeal to the need to evaluate principles\nagainst generic standpoints, rather than against the eccentric\npreferences of particular individuals.“Our assessment cannot be\nbased on the particular aims, preferences, and other characteristics\nof specific individuals. We must rely instead on commonly available\ninformation about what people have reason to want … about\ngeneric reasons.” (Scanlon 1998, p. 203) What matters is not\nwhat Curious wants, but what a representative person\nin her situation would have reason to want. And people in general have\nreason to want control over their exposure to risk. Generic reasons\nalso play a key role in contractualist accounts of risk (section 11)\nand our obligations to future people (section 13). \nMoral philosophers often discuss artificial examples involving\ncertainty. In particular, discussion of the ethics of harm focuses on\ncases where each action will definitely harm some particular person.\nBut real-life ethics invariably involves widespread uncertainty. Most\nactual “harmful” activities are socially productive ones\nthat impose some risk of harm on others. (Fried 2012a, 2012b) Can\nContractualists provide a plausible and distinctive account of when\nand why such activities are permitted? (For more detailed discussion\nof a variety of Contractualist accounts of risk, see Frick 2015, Fried\n2012a, Horton 2017, Kumar 2015.) \nWe begin with a simple example: \nDriving: Bob lives in a large city in the developed world.\nHis daily life is greatly enhanced by the fact that he and others are\nable to drive cars. Bob drives to work, drives out of town for the\nweekend, drives to the local shopping mall, enjoys goods and services\nthat are only available because others can drive, and so on. One\nmorning, while walking his dog along the street, Bob is killed in a\ntraffic accident. The driver was not at fault – she was not\nspeeding or drunk or otherwise irresponsible. Bob is just unlucky. In\na large city where millions of people drive every day, faultless fatal\naccidents like this are bound to happen from time to time. \nOver the course of his life, Bob received many benefits from his and\nothers’ driving. But suppose these are outweighed by the cost of\nhis untimely death. As things turned out, Bob would have been\nbetter-off if driving had not been permitted. This seems to give Bob a\nreason to reject any principle that permits driving. And this reason\nseems to outweigh other people’s reasons to want driving to be\npermitted. (After all, any inconvenience they suffered would not be as\nbad as an early death.) It therefore seems that contractualism cannot\npermit driving. Indeed, contractualism must prohibit all\nsocially useful activities that carry any risk of harm\n– on the grounds that, in a large population, over the course of\na lifetime, any such activity is virtually certain to lead to at least\none death. \nUtilitarians have an easy solution. Driving should be permitted if it\nmaximises expected aggregate welfare. A small risk of death is\noutweighed by a large number of individual benefits. If Contractualism\ncannot permit any risky activities, then this places it at a distinct\ndisadvantage against utilitarianism. \nOne simple solution is to restrict the scope of contractualism. If\ncontractualism deals only with cases where harm is certain, then it\nneed not address risk at all. We could then combine a contractualist\naccount of certain harm with a utilitarian account of risks of harm.\nUnfortunately, this solution has a high cost. Given the ubiquity of\nrisk, and the comparative rarity of cases of certain harm, this\npluralist option effectively sidelines contractualism. \nA second simple solution is to bite the bullet, and insist that risky\nsocial activities are never permitted. Few contractualists embrace\nthis extreme revisionism. And it too threatens irrelevance. People\nwill never abandon risk altogether, and we naturally turn to ethical\ntheory to guide us through our risky activities. If contractualism is\nsilent in this crucial area, then it loses any claim to be of\npractical relevance. \nThe challenge for contractualism is to steer a middle-way between\nbanning risk altogether and collapsing into utilitarianism. \nOne central question is whether our contractualist evaluation of risk\nshould be ex post or ex ante. Contractualism tells us to justify our\nmoral principles to each person. A principle permitting driving must\nbe justified to Bob. But when do we imagine this justification\noccurring? Suppose we were to offer Bob a choice between two\nprinciples: one permits driving and the other forbids it. When does\nBob make this choice? Does he choose in advance – perhaps before\nhe moves to the city or before his life begins? Or does he choose in\nretrospect – after he knows how his life has actually gone? \nIn cases involving risk and uncertainty, these two temporal\nperspectives represent very different epistemological standpoints. Ex\nante, Bob knows that living in a city where driving is permitted\nexposes him to a very small risk of death in a car accident where no\none is at fault. Ex post, Bob knows that living in a city where\ndriving is permitted has in fact resulted in his death. \nSome forms of contractualism explicitly favour ex ante rather than ex\npost evaluation. Rawls, for instance, asks his parties to choose\nprinciples to govern their society on the basis of general knowledge\nabout how their lives might go, rather than particular information\nabout their specific circumstances. Scanlonian contractualism, by\ncontrast, usually requires justification to actual people who are\naware of their own situation. In his 1998 book, Scanlon explicitly\nfavours ex post justification. However, most contractualists\n(including Scanlon himself) now favour either ex ante contractualism\nor some hybrid view combining both ex ante and ex post evaluations.\n(Scanlon 2013, Kumar 2015, Frick 2015.) \nIn our original Driving case, ex ante justification seems to delivers\nthe intuitively correct result. When he views the prospects in\nadvance, Bob may well conclude that the very small risk of death is\noutweighed – from his own perspective – by the large\nnumber of benefits he is almost certain to enjoy. If the imbalance is\nsufficiently great, we might conclude that it would not be reasonable\nfor Bob to reject a principle that permits driving. (Some extremely\nrisk-averse individuals will perhaps still object to driving, but\ncontractualists can reply that this rejection is not reasonable.) \nUnfortunately, there are two problems with this contractualist\nresponse. First, if all citizens face the same pattern of risks and\nbenefits, then this ex ante justification threatens to collapse into\nutilitarianism in practice. Contractualism thus risks losing its\ndistinctiveness. Second, if citizens face different risk profiles,\nthen even ex ante contractualism may still find itself unable to\njustify any risky behaviour. Consider a new example: \nFlying: Commercial air travel brings many benefits to many\npeople. However, it also brings small risks of death. Some of this\nrisk falls on people who benefit from air travel – notably\npassengers. But some people exposed to the same risks enjoy no\nbenefits. Jeb is an Amish farmer who completely eschews all the\n‘benefits’ of modern life. Jeb lives under the flightpath\nof air traffic between two major cities. (Jeb was not consulted about\nthis flightpath.) One day, debris from a passing airplane falls on Jeb\nand kills him. (This example is adapted from Kumar 2015, which draws\non Ashford 2003.) \nJeb obviously has a strong ex post complaint against any principle\npermitting flying. But he also has an ex ante complaint. Even before\nhe knows that he will be killed by falling debris, Jeb expects no\nbenefit whatsoever from flying. (Indeed, he does not regard flying as\ntruly beneficial to anyone!) Jeb will want to reject in advance any\nprinciple that imposes on him a risk of death without any compensating\nbenefits. From a contractualist perspective, this rejection seems\nreasonable. \nThe two challenges for ex ante contractualists are (a) to offer a\nprincipled justification for rejecting Jeb’s complaint; and (b)\nto ensure that that justification does not collapse into\nutilitarianism. One possibility is to argue that, like Curious, Jeb is\ntoo eccentric for contractualist purposes. We should be asking what\npeople in general have reason to reject, rather than examining the\nstrange predilections of singular individuals. However, unlike\nCurious’s counter-suggestible risk-seeking, Jeb’s\nrejection of modern life is considered and (prima facie) reasonable.\nIf contractualism rejects Jeb’s considered worldview as\n“unreasonable”, then he might object that contractualism\nthereby fails to treat him with the respect due to a rational\nagent. \nA better alternative for the contractualist is to focus on broader\nprinciples that apply to all risky activities, rather than artificial\nprinciples relating only to flying. Jeb gains no benefit from air\ntravel. But he, along with everyone else, does benefit from living in\na society where everyone is free to pursue their own goals according\nto their own values. Jeb thus has reason to reject any principle that\nprevents people in general from pursuing reasonable lifestyle options,\neven if some of those options impose small risks of death on\nothers. \nAnother problem for ex ante contractualism is that, in some other\npossible cases, it is ex post evaluation that seems most appropriate.\nContrast two scenarios introduced by Frances Kamm (Kamm 2007, p. 273;\nFried 2012a, p. 47): \nAmbulance I: Should our city authorize its ambulances to\nspeed on the way to the hospital whenever it is the case that doing so\nwill save five sick passengers for every one pedestrian who is killed\nas a result of the speeding? \nAmbulance II: Should our city also prohibit its ambulance\ndrivers from braking to save an identifiable pedestrian’s life\nwhenever it is the case that the time lost by braking will cause the\nfive passengers inside the ambulance to die? \nMany people judge that the first policy is permissible while the\nsecond is not. (Kamm 2007, Lenman 2008) This leads some\ncontractualists to favour hybrid view that combine ex post and ex ante\nevaluation. (e.g., Lenman 2008) It is one thing to ask everyone to\nagree in advance to a policy that will predictably result in the\ndeaths of some pedestrians, but another thing altogether to ask\nthis particular pedestrian to lay down her life for the\ngreater good! \nUnfortunately, critics of contractualism allege that hybrid views\nproduce implausible results of their own in cases where the parties\nhave asymmetric information about their fate. (Fried 2012a, pp.\n53–54) Consider a final case introduced by Sophia Reibetanz\n(Reibetanz 1998): \nUnexploded Mines: One hundred workers are working in a field\nknown to contain an unexploded mine. Another person, Z, is the only\none who could disarm the mine. If Z disarms the mine, then Z is\ncertain to get pneumonia. If Z doesn’t disarm the mine, then it\nis certain that 1 of the 100 workers will be seriously injured. This\nserious injury is ten times worse than suffering pneumonia. \nZ faces a certainty of (minor) harm, while each worker faces a 1%\nchance of (greater) harm. If Z is allowed to appeal to this\ninformation asymmetry, then Z’s complaint trumps the complaint\nof any individual worker. Z can thus reasonably reject any principle\nthat requires Z to disarm the mine. But this seems counter-intuitive,\nas the certain result is a much greater harm for someone else. The\nchallenge for hybrid contractualists is either to avoid this result or\nto explain why it is justified. (Ostuka 2011, Reibetanz 1998. For an\nargument that contractualism cannot solve this problem, see Fried\n2012a, p. 54) \nSocial contract theories notoriously leave out non-human animals. If\nall moral obligations are between parties to the social contract, then\nwe have no obligations regarding animals who cannot be parties to the\ncontract. So (for instance) torturing non-rational animals cannot be\nwrong. By contrast, utilitarians have no difficulty explaining why it\nis wrong to torture animals. This seems to place contractualism at a\ncomparative disadvantage. Can contractualism provide an adequate\naccount of our moral obligations to animals? Does it need to? \nScanlon offers two solutions. The first is to limit the scope of his\naccount. Contractualism is not an account of the whole of morality,\nbut only an account of the morality of what we owe to other persons.\nThis leaves open the possibility that our obligations to animals fall\noutside this part of morality. Scanlon also explicitly puts aside any\nmoral obligations we might have in regard to the natural environment\n(Scanlon 1998, p. 179).  \nScanlon also suggests a possible way that obligations to animals could\nbe accommodated within contractualism. This is via the notion of\ntrustees, to whom justifications of proposed principles can be\noffered, on behalf of the animals they represent (Scanlon 1998, p.\n183). \nUtilitarians will object that this second solution provides too\nindirect an account of what ultimately grounds our obligations to\nanimals. The fact that it is wrong to inflict unnecessary pain on\nanimals is not most plausibly explained via the notion of whether this\nbehaviour could be justified to a trustee of the animals. Rather, it\nis wrong simply because of the suffering the animal feels. A\nutilitarian will add that, once we realise that this is what is wrong\nin the case of animal suffering, we should draw the same conclusion\nabout human suffering. It is their capacity for suffering rather than\ntheir capacity for rational agency that plays the most salient role in\nexplaining the wrongness of torturing humans. \nA contractualist can reply as follows. Contractualism captures the\ncentral sense of wrongness, one that plays a role in how individuals\nunderstand what they are accountable to one another for. The case of\nanimals shows that this is not the only notion of wrongness. But, once\nwe reflect on the differences between the two cases, we see why our\nobligations to one another are so different from any obligations we\nmight have to animals—precisely because we cannot meaningfully\njustify ourselves to them. Animals are not a special problem\nfor the contractualist, but rather an opportunity to explore what is\ndistinctive about the contractualist approach. \nAnother problem facing any social contract theory concerns our\nobligations to future people. It is hard to see how we can have any\nobligations to such people, as they cannot be parties to our contract.\nThis is principally because of the absence of any possibility of\nmutually advantageous interaction between distant\ngenerations. The quality of life of future generations depends to a\nvery large extent on the decisions of the present generation. By\ncontrast, our quality of life is not affected at all by their\ndecisions. We can do a great deal to (or for) posterity but posterity\ncannot do anything to (or for) us. This power imbalance is often\ncharacterised in terms of the absence of Hume’s\n“circumstances of justice”. (The phrase is borrowed from\nRawls 1971, pp. 126–130.) \nFor contractarians, for whom morality is an agreement for\nmutual advantage, it follows that we have no obligations to future\npeople with whom we cannot interact. A similar problem arises for\nthose like Rawls who seek to base the social contract on some\nmodification of self-interested behaviour—such as self-interest\nbehind the veil of ignorance. \nContractualism, by contrast, easily avoids this particular problem, as\nit begins by assuming that moral agents are motivated by a desire to\njustify themselves to others. There is no reason why those others must\nbe currently existing people. When deciding how to act, I can ask\nmyself whether future people who are affected by my actions might\nreasonably reject a principle permitting those actions. For instance,\nif I want to construct a power plant that will leak radiation in the\nfuture, it makes perfect sense to ask whether those who will suffer as\na result might reasonably object to my behaviour. Because it works\nwith the possibility of reasonable rejection—rather than actual\nbargaining—contractualism can accommodate obligations to future\npeople. This is a significant advantage over other social contract\ntheories. \nHowever, there is a second problem regarding future people—one\nthat does seem to apply to contractualism. This problem owes its\nprominence in recent philosophical debate to the work of Derek Parfit,\nto whom we owe the following example (Parfit 1984, pp.\n351–379): \nMary’s behaviour seems morally wrong. Utilitarians have a simple\naccount of why Mary’s behaviour is wrong, as she brings about\nless human happiness than she could have done. Yet it seems that\ncontractualism cannot capture this intuition. Consider a principle\npermitting Mary’s behaviour. If Mary’s behaviour is wrong,\nthen this principle must be one that someone can reasonably reject.\nBut who? Not the Winter Child—because he would otherwise never\nhave existed at all. And not the Summer Child—because he\ndoesn’t exist. \nPerhaps the most promising contractualist defence lies, once again, in\nthe possibility that my grounds for rejecting a principle are not\nnecessarily confined to its direct impact on my well-being. We might\nseparate two moves the contractualist can make here. They might argue\n(1) that the grounds for rejecting a principle need not be its impact\non my well-being; or (2) that it need not be its impact on\nmy well-being. Intuitively, what is objectionable about\nMary’s behaviour is not anything to do with well-being, or with\nthe identity of future individuals. What is wrong is rather that Mary\nfails to show adequate respect for ‘her future\nchild’—whoever that child may turn out to be. Even though\nthere is no particular individual who can be said to have been harmed,\nthere is still legitimate ground for a complaint that a principle\npermitting Mary’s behaviour shows inadequate respect to future\npeople. The challenge for the Contractualist is to translate this\ncomplaint into one that can be made on behalf of the Winter Child.\n(For one recent attempt at such a translation, see Kumar 2003a, 2009.\nFor a critique, see Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 235) \nIn chapter 22 of On What Matters, Parfit argues that the\nimpersonalist restriction—which rules out appeals to the\nimpersonal goodness or badness of outcomes—leaves any form of\ncontractualism that incorporates the individualist restriction unable\nto respond to the non-identity problem. \nInstead, Parfit argues that contractualists should permit both\npersonal and impartial reasons as grounds for\nreasonable rejection. Impartial reasons, here, are grounded\nin the moral claims or the well-being of individuals. “We have\nsuch impartial reasons to care about the well-being of every\nindividual or person” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 238). The\ncrucial feature of impartial reasons is that they are not narrowly\nperson-affecting. In a different people choice, we have an impartial\nreason to maximise the well-being of future people—even though\ndifferent possible futures include different groups of possible\npeople. “Since [because of the non-identity problem] we cannot\nappeal to the personal reasons that are had by people who\nnever exist, we should appeal to the impartial\nreasons that are had by people who do exist” (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 240). \nAs with the individualist restriction, we might wonder whether the\nadmission of impartial reasons effectively abandons the spirit of\ncontractualism. If every present person has the same impartial\nreasons, and if those reasons cannot outweigh any individual’s\npersonal reasons, then the resulting more impartial formulation of\ncontractualism will converge with rule consequentialism. But does this\nresult tell us anything interesting about Scanlon’s\ncontractualism? More generally, will the resulting theory retain the\ndistinctive features of contractualism that appeal to those who are\nunsatisfied with familiar alternatives such as Kantian ethics or rule\nconsequentialism? \nDebates about future people also connect to other recent controversies\nwithin contractualism, especially the literature on risk. The divide\nbetween ex post and ex ante justification is especially significant in\nnon-identity cases, where ex post justification can be offered to\nparticular individuals while ex ante justification can only deal with\nperson types. Should contractualists give their person-affecting\nprinciples an ex post or ex ante interpretation? (Weinberg 2003 and\n2015 defends an ex post interpretation, albeit within a Rawlsian\nframework rather than a Scanlonian one; while Parfit 2017 clearly sets\nout the ex ante alternative.) \nAnother emerging debate is whether contractualism can deliver\nplausible verdicts in cases involving risks of human extinction. The\nprima facie problem for contractualism here is that, because the\noutcome where we fail to avoid imminent extinction contains no future\npeople at all, there is no (particular or representative) future\nperson who has the standing to reasonably reject principles\ninstructing present people to ignore extinction risks and focus\nentirely on meeting present needs.

M.\nScanlon, especially in his book What We Owe to Each Other.\nThis essay takes ‘contractualism’ in the narrower sense.\nWe begin with a brief summary of Scanlon’s contractualism, and\nthen situate his view in relation both to other social contract\ntheories and to its main rival among impartial accounts of\nmorality—namely, utilitarianism. Our discussion is then\norganised around a series of challenges to the contractualist\naccount.\n\n\nThere is already a huge literature surrounding Scanlon’s\ncontractualism. Our aim is not to summarise that\nliterature—still less to contribute anything novel to it.\nRather, we seek to explain the distinctive appeal of contractualism,\nas well as highlighting the challenges it faces from other\ntheories.\n\nScanlon introduces contractualism as a distinctive account of moral\nreasoning. He summarises his account thus: \nBut Scanlon’s version of contractualism is not just concerned\nwith determining which acts are right and wrong. It is also concerned\nwith what reasons and forms of reasoning are justifiable. Whether or\nnot a principle is one that cannot be reasonably rejected is to be\nassessed by appeal to the implications of individuals or agents being\neither licensed or directed to reason in the way required by the\nprinciple. Scanlon’s version offers an account both of (1) the\nauthority of moral standards and of (2) what constitutes rightness and\nwrongness. As to the first, the substantive value that is realised by\nmoral behaviour consists in a relation of “mutual\nrecognition”. As to the second, wrongness consists in\nunjustifiability: wrongness is the property of being\nunjustifiable. The wrongness of an action is not to be equated with\nthe properties that make it unjustifiable. Rather, it is to be equated\nwith its being unjustifiable; the character of wrongness is captured\nby the higher order fact that wrong acts are unjustifiable. What wrong\nacts have in common is that they cannot be justified to others. Thus\nthe various moral considerations that guide our substantive moral\nreflection are unified by a single normative subject matter. In this\nway, contractualism guides our substantive reflection about wrongness.\nWrong is the primary moral predicate; right is defined as “not\nwrong”. One reason for focusing on wrong is to draw attention to\nthe domain that contractualism is concerned to map, concerning what it\nis for one person to have been wronged by another. \nMoral requirements determine what it is to respond properly to the\nvalue of persons as rational agents. The distinctive value of human\nlife lies in the human capacity to assess reasons and justifications.\nTherefore, appreciating the value of a person involves recognising her\ncapacity to appreciate and act on reasons. The way to value this\ncapacity is to treat persons in accord with principles they could not\nreasonably reject. In doing so, the agent is guided by a principle\nthat can rightly be characterised as one that the person herself\nauthorised that agent to be guided by, in thinking about the\nappropriate way to relate to her. Contractualism illuminates the\ncompelling Kantian insight that we ought to treat persons never as\nmere means but always as ends in themselves. It interprets this as\ntreating them according to principles they could not reasonably\nreject. \nContractualism appeals to the idea of a social contract. It attempts\nto derive the content of morality (and, in some versions, also the\njustification for holding that we are obligated to follow morality)\nfrom the notion of an agreement between all those in the moral domain.\nContemporary moral philosophy offers several other interpretations of\nthe social contract tradition. It is useful to distinguish\ncontractualism from these alternatives. \nContractarianism has its roots in Hobbes, whose account is\nbased on mutual self-interest. Morality consists in those forms of\ncooperative behaviour that it is mutually advantageous for\nself-interested agents to engage in. (The most prominent modern\nexponent is David Gauthier. See Gauthier 1986.) \nBy contrast, any form of contractualism is grounded on the\nequal moral status of persons. It interprets this moral status as\nbased on their capacity for rational autonomous agency. According to\ncontractualism, morality consists in what would result if we were to\nmake binding agreements from a point of view that respects our equal\nmoral importance as rational autonomous agents. Contractualism has its\nroots in Rousseau, rather than Hobbes: the general will is what we\nwould jointly will if we adopted the perspective of free and equal\ncitizens. Contractualism offers an alternative to contractarianism.\nUnder contractarianism, I seek to maximise my own interests in a\nbargain with others. Under contractualism, I seek to pursue my\ninterests in a way that I can justify to others who have their own\ninterests to pursue. \nWe next distinguish contractualism from the specific moral theory of\nKant. Kantian moral philosophers seek principles to which all rational\nagents would agree, under certain idealised conditions. In order to\nreach such an agreement, Kant notoriously needs to abstract away from\nmany (some would say too many) concrete features of our moral lives.\n(See Onora O’Neill’s gloss on the notion of agreement in\nKantian ethics; O’Neill 2003.) \nContractualism departs from Kant in various respects. In particular,\nit offers a substantive account of the normative force of morality,\nbased on the value of a relation of mutual respect. Reasonableness is\nnot taken to be something that can be demonstrated outside the moral\npoint of view. Another difference is that contractualism seeks\nprinciples that no one can reasonably reject, rather than principles\nall would agree to. \nHowever, Scanlon’s contractualism has Kantian elements, as it\nseeks a free agreement that elucidates both freedom and equality. We\nmight say that contractualism gives expression to ideas latent in\nKant’s discussions of the Categorical Imperative (especially in\nthe Formula of Humanity and the Formula of the Kingdom of Ends, rather\nthan the more familiar Formula of Universal Law). Indeed, as we shall\nsee in\n section 5,\n Derek Parfit argues that, despite their differences, contractualism\ndoes coincide with the best interpretation of Kant’s moral\ntheory. \nThe most influential recent social contract theorist is John Rawls.\nRawls’s contract differs from Scanlonian contractualism in two\nkey ways. (1) Rawls’s contract is more Kantian, as he seeks\nprinciples everyone would agree to, rather than principles\nno-one could reasonably reject. (This contrast is especially\nmarked if we consider Rawls’s Dewey Lectures (Rawls 1980), where\nhis work is at its most Kantian.) (2) Rawls’s contract is\npolitical—it aims to set the general social framework for a\nliberal society, rather than determining moral principles. As a\nresult, Rawls places the parties to his agreement behind a veil of\nignorance, where they do not know many key facts about their own\nidentity. This is to ensure that the resulting principles of justice\nembody Rawls’s commitment to liberal neutrality. For Rawls, we\nought to follow the principles that it would be rational for everyone\nto choose, if they had to choose those principles without knowing\nanything about themselves or their circumstances. Because each person\nknows that they could end up being anyone, each must have concern for\nall. In essence, Rawls uses self-interest behind a veil of ignorance\nto represent a commitment to justice, construed as fairness to\nall. \nContractualism, by contrast, invokes no veil of ignorance. I know my\nown circumstances. It is not self-interest combined with ignorance of\nself that makes me take account of everyone’s interests, but\nrather my concern to justify myself to everyone else. This motivation\nis a key feature of Scanlon’s contractualism. All social\ncontract theorists—even contractarians—agree that agents\nwant to justify themselves to others. However, for the contractarian,\nsuch a desire is merely strategic—justification is\ninstrumentally useful because it enables me to get others to do what\nserves my interests. For the contractualist, by contrast, agents are\nmorally motivated by an intrinsic desire to justify themselves to\nothers. Having this desire is part of what it is to be a\nmoral agent. \nDespite these differences, contractualism does have several points in\ncommon with other social contract theories. In particular,\ncontractualism aspires to provide a non-utilitarian theory that\ngrounds moral status on a universal trait of persons—rational\nmoral agency—and thus provides general principles whose scope is\nglobal. It is to this contrast with utilitarianism that we now turn.\n \nContractualism is an impartial moral theory. In contemporary moral\nphilosophy, the main impartial moral theory outside the social\ncontract tradition is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes\npersons’ moral status to be grounded on their capacity for\nwell-being and suffering, and takes well-being to be the sole moral\nvalue. It takes the appropriate response to this value to be to\npromote it. Utilitarianism is thus a consequentialist moral\ntheory—morality is concerned with bringing about valuable\noutcomes. \nThere are three fundamental contrasts between contractualism and\nutilitarianism. The first difference is one of scope. (1)\nUtilitarianism applies to every area of morality, while contractualism\ncovers only the realm of what we owe to one another. Scanlon himself\nacknowledges that this is not the whole of morality. We return to this\ndifference in sections\n 12\n and\n 13. \nThe remaining two differences between contractualism and\nutilitarianism relate to content. (2) Contractualism does not\naggregate, but rather focuses on the standpoint of individual\npersons. (3) Contractualism does not regard well-being as a basic\nmoral concept, but instead allows a variety of personal reasons. \nThe only reasons for and against a principle that count when we are\njudging whether or not it can be reasonably rejected are\n“various individuals’ reasons for objecting to that\nprinciple and alternatives to it” (Scanlon 1998, p. 229). The\nacceptability of a principle depends on a one-by-one assessment of the\nstrength of the reasons that individuals would have for rejecting the\nprinciple, compared to the alternatives to it. Since individuals must\nbe objecting on their own behalf and not on behalf of a group, this\nrestriction to single individuals’ reasons bars the\ninterpersonal aggregation of complaints; it does not allow a number of\nlesser complaints to outweigh one person’s weightier\ncomplaint. \nUnlike utilitarianism, therefore, contractualism rejects the\ninterpersonal aggregation of burdens. (We discuss some important\nexceptions below.) This is one of the main respects in which it\ndiffers from utilitarianism. Contractualism thus captures a key\nfeature of our moral life that, as Rawls famously argues,\nutilitarianism ignores: the feature he calls “the separateness\nof persons” (Rawls 1971). Instead of lumping everyone together\nand allowing one person’s rights to be trampled to provide\ngreater aggregate benefits to others, contractualism recognises that\neach of us has a unique life to live. Contractualism therefore seeks\nprinciples that benefit each person individually and that command each\nperson’s free assent. \nAggregation (in some form) is essential to utilitarianism. Situations\nfrequently arise where one person’s pleasure is in conflict with\nanother’s, or where the only way to secure one person’s\npleasure is to cause someone else pain, or where we must choose which\nperson suffers which pain. We must find a way to balance the moral\nreasons generated by different people’s pleasures and pains. If\nwe retain a utilitarian perspective, then it is hard to see how we can\ndo this without some kind of aggregation—adding different\npleasures and pains together. \nBy contrast, contractualism seems able to avoid aggregation, because\nit begins, not with individual pleasure and pain, but with the more\nflexible concept of reasons. Unlike my pleasures and pains, my reasons\ncan be responsive to the situation of others. To see this, we explore\ntwo features of Scanlon’s use of reasons: rejection must be\nreasonable, and reasons are not limited to well-being. \nIn order to reasonably reject a principle, I must have some objection\nto it. This objection may begin with some direct harm I suffer as a\nresult of the principle. So far, if the harm involved is pain or\nsuffering, contractualism mirrors utilitarianism. However, the fact\nthat a principle impacts negatively on me is not sufficient.\nTo know whether I can reasonably reject the principle, I must\nalso ask how it impacts on others. If a principle imposes a certain\nburden (b1) on me, but every alternative imposes a greater\nburden (b2) on someone else, then b1 does not give\nme a reason to reject the principle. If I am reasonable, then I\nwithdraw my objection when I see that your reason is more pressing.\n(By contrast, it would make no sense to say that a utilitarian has\n‘withdrawn her pain’ because she has noticed that someone\nelse’s pain is greater.) So we conclude that the principle\nimposing b1 on me cannot be reasonably rejected. And we reach\nthis conclusion without having to aggregate anything. \nIn contractualism, individuals are motivated both by self-regard and\nby respect for others. Since each person is partly motivated by\nconcern for her own interests, contractualism can ground\nconsequentialist reasons. Part of what we owe others is to promote\ntheir interests. Contractualism can therefore accommodate important\nconsequentialist aspects of the structure of moral thought. \nUnlike utilitarianism, however, the account of value underlying\ncontractualism does not claim that there is only one rational attitude\nto have towards value. So contractualism can accommodate\nconsequentialist aspects without being a completely consequentialist\ntheory. (This represents an advantage of contractualism over\nnaïve versions of Kantian ethics, which reject all\nconsequentialist reasons and thus make it very difficult to explain\nwhy the consequences of our actions have any moral significance at\nall.) In contrast to an outcome ethics (such as utilitarianism), what\nis foundational for contractualism is not minimising what is\nundesirable, but considering what principles no-one could reasonably\nreject. Moral principles are grounded in the idea of living with\nothers on terms of mutual respect. This means that as well as\naccommodating some consequentialist aspects, contractualism can also\naccommodate certain deontological intuitions: commonsense prohibitions\nagainst treating persons in certain ways even in circumstances in\nwhich the aggregate value of the consequences of doing so is very\ngreat. Which prohibitions are justified? This question “is best\nanswered by considering what principles licensing others to take our\nlives could be reasonably rejected” (Scanlon 1998, p. 85). Among\nthese principles might be ones that involve “accepting a certain\nview of the reasons one has: that the positive value of saving others\ndoes not justify killing someone” (Scanlon 1998, p. 84). \nA further resource available to contractualism that is not available\nto utilitarianism is that my reasons for rejecting a principle are not\nlimited to my well-being—however broadly that notion is\nconstrued. For ease of exposition, let us for the moment follow the\nutilitarian, and think of ‘burdens’ solely in terms of\nnegative impact on my well-being. My reason for rejecting a principle\nmight be, not so much that it imposes a certain burden on me, but the\nway in which it imposes that burden—and what the principle thus\nsays about me. For instance, consider a principle that allocates\nbenefits and burdens on the basis of race, and contrast this with a\nprinciple that allocates the same benefits and burdens randomly. I\ncannot reject the racist principle simply because of the burden it\nimposes on me—after all, the random principle imposes an\nidentical burden on someone else. Rather, I reject the racist\nprinciple because, by regarding my race as a relevant ground for the\ndistribution of benefits, it imposes that burden in a way that\nconstitutes a failure to respect my status as a person. \nIf we abandon the utilitarian link between burdens and well-being,\nthen we might say that the method of distribution of burdens itself\nimposes an additional burden of a different kind—the burden of\nnot being respected. Similarly, I might reject a principle that\narbitrarily exempts some people from a burden borne by everyone else,\non the grounds that such a principle treats me unfairly—even if\nthe alternative is a principle that places that burden on everyone.\nFor instance, imagine a situation where, in order to preserve the\ngrass, we need at least 90% of the people to avoid walking on the\ngrass, but it doesn’t do any harm if 10% do walk on the grass. I\nmight object to a principle that allows the members of a privileged\nracial minority to walk on the grass, even if my preferred principle\nis one where no-one gets to enjoy grass-walking. My rejection is not\nbased on envy, but on the disrespect this principle shows by regarding\nrace as a legitimate ground for distribution. \nContractualist reasons are more flexible than\naggregation, as they allow us to respond directly to morally\nrelevant considerations, rather than having to rely upon some complex\nutilitarian calculation. (Think of the artificial epicycles a\nutilitarian needs to go through to reject a principle that efficiently\nmaximises happiness, but happens to be racist or arbitrary.) By moving\nstraight to the moral heart of the matter, contractualism also seems\nto offer a more satisfying explanation of why certain\nbehaviour is wrong. \nContractualism can thus produce principles that balance the interests\nof different people against one another, without explicit appeal to\naggregation. This is a significant development in moral philosophy, as\nit enables us to separate arguments against utilitarianism into two\nclasses: arguments against impartiality and arguments against\naggregation. Objections in the first class also apply to\ncontractualism, while those in the second class do not. We return to\naggregation in\n section 8;\n and consider one common objection to impartiality in\n section 9.\n Once contractualism has entered the field, we cannot treat arguments\nfor impartiality as if they were arguments for utilitarianism\nitself. \nAlthough it is not solely devoted to contractualism, Scanlon’s\n2008 book Moral Dimensions: Permissibility, Meaning, Blame.\naddresses several issues of relevance to Scanlonian contractualism,\nnotably the irrelevance of intent for judgements of permissibility,\nthe distinction between two kinds of responsibility, and the analysis\nof blame. These issues help to differentiate contractualism from some\nof its non-consequentialist rivals. \nMany theorists distinguish non-consequentialist moral theories from\nconsequentialist rivals such as utilitarianism by emphasising the\nsignificance of agents’ intentions. Otherwise\npermissible acts become impermissible when done for the wrong reason\nor in pursuit of the wrong aim. For instance, the doctrine of\ndouble effect forbids actions that aim at the death of an\ninnocent person either as an end or as a means to an end, even when\nthe same result could be permissible as a side-effect. Consider two\nfamiliar examples: \nDrug: “If the limited amount of a drug that is\navailable could be used either to save one patient or to save five\nothers, it is permissible to give it to the five, even though the one\nwill die. But it would not be permissible to withhold the same drug\nfrom the same person in order to save the five others by transplanting\nhis organs into them after he is dead.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 1) \nMilitary Target: “Many people believe that in war it\ncan be permissible to bomb a military target even though this will\nalso cause the deaths of some noncombatants living nearby, but that it\nwould not be permissible to bomb the same number of noncombatants in\norder to hasten the end of the war by demoralizing the\npopulation.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 2) \nDespite its intuitive appeal, Scanlon rejects the doctrine of double\neffect, arguing that intention is not directly relevant to\npermissibility. Scanlon concedes that intentions have\npredictive significance – they help predict\nhow an agent will perform an action, and whether she is\nlikely to succeed in performing the action or in implementing any\nlarger plan of which this action might be a part. But such predictions\nare only indirectly relevant to judgements of permissibility. Scanlon\nalso agrees that intentions matter when assessing how an agent has\ndeliberated on a given occasion. But they are not relevant to\njudgements of permissibility, which ask instead\n“whether an agent may perform an action of a certain\nkind.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 2.) \nDrawing on the work of Judith Thomson (Thomson 1986, pp.\n101–102), Scanlon argues that a focus on intention can lead to\nimplausible conclusions about permissibility. Consider two familiar\nthought experiments. \nLoop: “In the well-known trolley-problem case it seems\npermissible to switch a runaway trolley onto a sidetrack on which it\nwill hit only one person rather than allow it to continue straight\nahead and hit five. But it also seems permissible to switch the\ntrolley in [Thomson’s] Loop case … in which the sidetrack\nloops around and rejoins the main line, so that if the trolley does\nnot hit the one person and thereby come to a stop, it will continue\naround the loop and hit the five.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 18.) \nDoctor:“Suppose that a patient is fatally ill and in\ngreat pain. The only course of medication that will relieve this pain\nwill also cause the patient’s death. Suppose that the patient\nwants to be given this drug. Does the permissibility of administering\nit depend on the doctor’s intention in doing so?” (Scanlon\n2008, p. 19.) \nMost people agree that switching the trolley is permissible in Loop\neven though “one switches the trolley only because it will, by\nhitting the one person, be prevented from hitting the five”.\n(Scanlon 2008, p. 18) But this verdict clearly violates the doctrine\nof double effect. Most also agree that it is permissible for the\ndoctor to administer the drug whatever his intention – whether\nto relieve the patient’s pain, to hasten her death and thus end\nher suffering, or even to hasten the patient’s death in order to\ninherit her wealth. This last intention affects our evaluation of the\ndoctor’s character and deliberation. But it does not render his\naction impermissible. “What makes an action wrong is\nthe consideration or considerations that count decisively against it,\nnot the agent’s failure to give these considerations the proper\nweight.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 23) \nFor the contractualist, justification to others provides the standard\nthat determines which considerations count decisively against\nparticular actions. In transplant cases, the contractualist question\nis whether the possibility of saving lives via transplant justifies an\nexception to the general duty to aid one’s patients. Scanlon\nargues that it does not do so, because a principle permitting such an\nexception could reasonably be rejected by prospective patients. If\ndoctors withhold treatment because they intend to transplant their\npatients’ organs, then this intention is wrongful because the\nact intended is wrong, and not vice versa. \nIt is worth noting that, while most philosophers who discuss Thomson’s\nLoop share Scanlon’s intuition that switching the trolley is\npermissible, this agreement is not unanimous. For instance, Liao et al.\n2012 argue that actual intuitions about Loop cases are highly variable\nand dependent on the context of presentation, and therefore that moral\ntheorists should be wary of putting too much weight on such\nintuitions. Scanlon could take this criticism on board, as his\ncontractualist framework is not wedded to any specific conclusion\nabout Loop. But he would then need to find other cases to illustrate\nhis general claims about the significance of intention.  \nWhile they are not relevant for permissibility, intentions do affect\nthe meaning of actions, and thereby affect the ways that it is\nappropriate for others to respond to the agent. This brings us to\nScanlon’s discussions of blame and responsibility. Scanlon\ndistinguishes two forms of responsibility. \n(1) Moral reaction responsibility is relevant when we ask\ncertain positive or negative moral reactions to a person – such\nas blame, resentment, praise, or gratitude – are appropriate.\nIntuitively, “what a person has done makes such reactions\nappropriate only if the person was responsible for behaving in this\nway” (Scanlon 2015, pp. 89–90). Scanlon originally called\nthis “responsibility as attribution”, but he has come to\nprefer the label “moral reaction responsibility”. \n(2) Substantive responsibility is relevant when we ask\nwhether a person’s actions change her obligations to others, and\ntheir obligations to him or her. “Making a promise, handing over\nsome money, taking a risk, or choosing not to avail oneself of an\nopportunity can change a person’s obligations to others, and\ntheirs to him or her, if the person is responsible for doing these\nthings.” (Scanlon 2015, pp. 89–90) We return to the\ncontractualist account of substantive responsibility in section\n10. \nThe central question for the contractualist account of moral reaction\nresponsibility is “what must be true for an agent to be\nidentified with a particular attitude, and thus eligible for moral\nresponses such as praise and blame”. (Kumar 2015, p. 251) In the\nbackground, of course, lie traditional puzzles about free-will and\ndeterminism. Can agents fairly be blamed for actions or attitudes\nwhose ultimate causes lie beyond their control? It seems unfair to\nevaluate someone negatively for something she could not control. For\nthe contractualist, however, blame goes beyond mere evaluation. Blame\nis intimately linked to both the meaning of actions and our\nrelationships with others. “The meaning of our\ninteractions with others depends on what they see as the reasons\ngoverning those interactions. … we have reasons not to have\nattitudes of friendship or trust toward people whose attitudes toward\nus make these attitudes inappropriate.” (Scanlon 2015, p.\n93) \nFor Scanlon, a person is blameworthy if her action shows\nsomething about her attitudes toward others that impairs the relations\nthey can have with her. I blame you if both (a) I judge you\nto be blameworthy, and (b) I take my relationship with you to be\nmodified in a way that this judgement of impaired relations holds to\nbe appropriate. (Scanlon 2008, pp. 128–9) Appropriate blame\nreactions include withdrawal of trust and decreased readiness to enter\ninto special relationships such as friendship or to help the person\nwith his projects. (Scanlon 2015, p. 92) \nSuppose I discover that my close friend Joe laughed at cruel jokes at\nmy expense at last week’s party. (Scanlon 2008, pp.\n129–30) Joe’s behaviour clearly reveals attitudes that are\ninconsistent with friendship. I may therefore conclude that my\nrelationship with Joe is impaired, and adjust my own attitudes or\nbehaviour accordingly. \nContractualist blame thus only makes sense within a relationship, such\nas friendship or family relationships. Impairment must be judged\nagainst the standard of what is appropriate within that\nrelationship. This raises an obvious problem. What\nrelationship could possibly ground judgements of\nblameworthiness and reactions of blame in the general moral case?\nSuppose a stranger steals my bag as I walk down the street.\nIntuitively, I can blame her. But what is my relationship to her?\n“Do we have a relationship with every total stranger whom it\nmakes sense to blame?” (Scanlon 2008, p. 138) Scanlon replies\nthat we do. \n“The contractualist claim is that all persons stand in a\nparticular kind of relationship to one another, the ideal form of\nwhich realizes a distinct value, that of mutual recognition.”\n(Kumar 2015, p. 258) This idea sounds odd if we imagine a moral\nrelationship that is analogous to actual relationships such\nas a particular friendship. Contractualists instead treat the moral\nrelationship as “a normative ideal, like a normative ideal of\nfriendship that specifies attitudes and expectations that we should\nhave regarding one another. … morality requires that we hold\ncertain attitudes toward one another simply in virtue of the fact that\nwe stand in the relation of ‘fellow rational\nbeings’.” (Scanlon 2008, pp. 139–40) There are some\nbasic attitudes that we expect even from total strangers,and we are\nentitled to blame them if their behaviour demonstrates a lack of those\nattitudes. \nWithin contractualism, the idea of a universal moral relationship\nunifies the impersonal judgement that someone has failed to act on\nprinciples that no-one could reasonably reject with the personal\nreactions that characterise blame. Suppose I witness your bag being\nstolen. We both judge that you have been wronged. These judgements\nrest on “the general claim that it is impermissible for one\nperson to relate to another in the way she has in the type of\nsituation we find ourselves in.” (Kumar 2015, p. 260) But when\nyou blame the perpetrator, you do something much more\npersonal, by also raising “an objection to her attitudes toward\nyou in particular, and what they say about your relationship.”\n(Kumar 2015, p. 260) \nSome betrayals are so severe that they bring a friendship to an end.\nThe relationship cannot survive. Similarly, moral retributivists argue\nthat some horrendous actions can sever the moral relationship itself,\ncasting the person out of the sphere of mutual recognition that\ncharacterises morality. Contractualists disagree. “Even those\nwho have no regard for the justifiability of their actions toward\nothers retain their basic moral rights … not to be hurt or\nkilled, to be helped when they are in dire need, and to have us honour\npromises we have made to them.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 142)\nInstead,“blame … involves a suspension … of\none’s readiness to enter into … the range of interactions\nwith others that are morally important but not owed unconditionally to\neveryone”. (Scanlon 2008, pp. 142–3) For instance, I might\nrefuse to make agreements with an untrustworthy person, to enter into\nother specific relations that involve trust and reliance, or to\nvoluntarily assist her pursuit of her projects even when I can do so\nat little cost to myself. \nScanlon’s contractualist account of blame sets aside issues of\nfreewill and determinism. Because blame is a reaction to the attitudes\na person actually has, it is not undermined by the discovery that he\n“had no control over the factors that made him the kind of\nperson that he is.” (Scanlon 2008, p. 178) Even if you cannot\nhelp being callous, unreliable, and untrustworthy, I cannot be\nexpected to continue to treat you as if you had not revealed that, for\nwhatever reason, that is the kind of person you are. \nBefore turning to problems for contractualism, we first address a\nchallenge to its distinctiveness. In On What Matters, Derek\nParfit argues that rule consequentialism, contractualism, and the best\ninterpretation of Kant’s moral theory all coincide. The result\nis a triple theory, according to which “an act is wrong just\nwhen such acts are disallowed by some principle that is optimific,\nuniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable”\n(Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 413). As contractualism presents itself as\nan alternative to both consequentialism and Kant, this would be a very\nsignificant result. \nThe convergence argument explicitly deals, not with Scanlon’s\nown theory, but with “what I believe to be the best version of\nScanlonian contractualism” (Parfit 2011, volume 1, p. 412).\nParfit defends two key ‘improvements’, by rejecting two\nrestrictions that Scanlon places on the reasons that can be offered\nfor rejecting a moral principle, namely: \nIn other words, the convergence argument replaces Scanlon’s\noriginal formulation of contractualism, where all reasons for\nrejection must be the personal complaints of specific individuals,\nwith a more impersonal version. \nIn\n section 2,\n we noted a number of differences between Kantian and Scanlonian\ncontractualism. Despite these differences, Parfit argues that\nScanlonian contractualism coincides with the best interpretation of\nKant. In a cumulative argument spread over several chapters, Parfit\nargues that the best interpretation of Kant’s moral ideas yields\nthe following claim: \nEven if we accept the convergence of Kant and rule consequentialism,\nit still remains to be shown that these optimific and uniquely\nuniversally willable principles are the only set of principles that\nno-one could reasonably reject. The key step in this second prong of\nthe convergence argument is the claim that “when there is only\none relevant principle that everyone could rationally choose, no\none’s objection to this principle could be as strong as the\nstrongest objection to every alternative” (Parfit 2011, volume\n2, p. 245). \nThis key claim seems open to obvious counter-examples—cases\nwhere contractualism seems to diverge from rule consequentialism. Most\nstriking are those cases where “we can either save one person\nfrom some great burden, or give much smaller benefits to many other\npeople, who are all much better-off” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p.\n246).  \nProponents of the convergence argument must somehow explain away these\napparent counter-examples. Following Parfit, they will first will\ndivide such cases into two classes. In some cases, the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles instruct us to favour the individual.\nConsider Scanlon’s own example where we must choose between\nelectrifying an innocent person and disrupting millions of\npeople’s enjoyment of a televised sporting event (Scanlon 1998,\np. 235). Here, many rule consequentialists will argue that the\noptimific rules do instruct us to save the innocent person. If so, the\nconvergence between rule consequentialism and contractualism is\nstraightforward. In its contest with rule consequentialism,\ncontractualism cannot draw its intuitive appeal from such cases. \nWe must turn, then, to those cases where the optimific rule\nconsequentialist principles do instruct us to provide the smaller\nbenefits to many others. Here, the convergence argument must deny that\nthe solitary individual can reasonably reject the optimific\nprinciples. This is where Parfit’s ‘improvements’ on\ncontractualism are vital to the convergence argument. As originally\nformulated, contractualism departs from utilitarianism by allowing the\nindividual to reject the optimific principles whenever they place a\ngreater burden on her than her favoured principle places on\nany other single individual. Proponents of the convergence argument\nwill favour instead a more impersonal formulation. While the\nindividual’s own complaint is left undiminished, other people\ncan now reject her principle on impersonal\ngrounds—precisely because it fails to maximise everyone’s\nwell-being. Faced with these impersonal reasons, the single individual\ncannot reasonably reject the optimific principles. \nDespite its provocative claims, the convergence argument is, in one\nrespect, quite modest. It does not set out to prove that rule\nconsequentialism, Kantian ethics and contractualism necessarily\ncoincide. Rather, the conclusion is merely that plausible versions of\nthe three theories do not necessarily conflict. For this\nmodest purpose, it would be sufficient to construct one plausible\nversion of contractualism on which the optimific principles cannot\nreasonably be rejected. \nThere is a methodological issue here. In his presentation of the\nconvergence argument, Parfit tests competing versions of\ncontractualism against intuitions regarding specific idealised cases.\nThis is not a peculiarity of Parfit’s own presentation. Without\nintuitions of this kind, the convergence argument cannot get off the\nground. Proponents of individualist formulations of contractualism\nmight reply that, in some key cases, Parfit’s intuitions are not\nneutral benchmarks, but rather reflect the considered moral judgements\nof a consequentialist mind. This leaves it open to Contractualists to\nsimply stick to their guns—and argue that their view is\ndistinctive at the normative level, as well as the meta-ethical\nlevel. \nCommenting on Parfit’s earlier claim that the best\ninterpretation of Kant coincides with the best form of rule\nconsequentialism, Scanlon observes that “the degree to which\nParfit’s conclusion should seem surprising depends to a certain\nextent on how close the theories he is discussing are to\nKant’s” (Scanlon 2011, p. 117). Similar remarks apply to\nthe convergence argument. The appeal of contractualism is that it\npresents a genuine alternative to both consequentialism and Kantian\nethics. Those who are attracted to contractualism because, in certain\nkey cases, it coheres with distinctively non-utilitarian intuitions,\nare likely to regard the impersonal contractualism deployed in the\nconvergence argument as an abandonment of the core commitments of\ncontractualism. The convergence argument would then be of limited\nrelevance. We return to these issues below, when we consider the\nIndividual and Impersonal Restrictions in more detail. (See sections\n 8,\n 9, and\n 13.) \nParfit’s convergence argument has not attracted as much\nattention as other aspects of either his work or Scanlon’s. (One\nexception is Kumar 2011.) However, the general issue of the\nrelationship between contractualism and consequentialism is very\nrelevant to a number of objections to contractualism. It is always\nworth arking whether contractualism can cope adequately with new\nchallenges (such as aggregation, substantive responsibility, risk, or\nfuture people) without collapsing into rule consequentialism. \nThe remainder of this entry examines problem cases for contractualism.\nThe first two concern the logical structure of\ncontractualism—asking whether its account of wrongness is either\ncircular or incomplete. The next four are puzzle cases where the most\nobvious interpretation of contractualism seems to yield implausible\nresults. The last two are groups who should be included in the scope\nof morality, but who seem to be left out by contractualism: animals\nand future people. \nAs we saw in section 3.2, contractualism allows for the reasonable\nrejection of principles on grounds other than their direct impact on\nthe individual’s well-being. However, this appeal to reasons\nbeyond well-being brings out a common objection to\ncontractualism—that the whole apparatus of reasonable rejection\nis redundant. The objection is as follows. Contractualism says\nx is wrong if and only if x is forbidden by\nprinciples no-one can reasonably reject. Anyone can reasonably reject\na principle on the grounds that it permits actions that are wrong. So\na principle that no-one can reasonably reject is a principle that\npermits no actions that are wrong. If we don’t already know\nwhich actions are wrong, then we cannot use the contractualist\napparatus. But if we do already know which actions are wrong, then we\ndon’t need to use it. \nThere is a related objection using ‘unfair’ instead of\n‘wrong’. Suppose, following our previous discussion in\n section 3,\n we agree that contractualism allows ‘because it treats me\nunfairly’ to count as a reason for rejecting a principle. We\nthen face the challenge that our judgments of unfairness are doing all\nthe real moral work, as contractualism now says that a principle is\nwrong if and only if it treats someone unfairly. \nTo respond to this objection, contractualists must explain why\n‘x is wrong’ and ‘x is\nunfair’ are not the sort of claims that can feature as a reason\nfor rejecting a principle. They must also demonstrate that admitting\nreasons not based directly on well-being does not commit us to\nadmitting ‘x is wrong’ and ‘x is\nunfair’. \nThe Contractualist answer appeals to the conceptual link between\nwrongness and justification. Whether an act is wrong depends, not only\non its direct impact on individuals, but also on whether a principle\npermitting it can be justified to all concerned. ‘Because it is\nwrong’ is not the kind of reason that can be fed into the\ncontractualist apparatus, since it is not something that happens to\nindividuals. Instead, wrongness is something that is constructed out\nof individuals’ reasons using that very apparatus. The same goes\nfor ‘because it is unfair’. In the example of the racist\nprinciple introduced in section 3.2, I reject the principle, not\nbecause it treats me unfairly overall, but because it illicitly places\nweight on an inappropriate moral distinction. My complaint\nconcerns how a principle treats me. To know whether an action\nis wrong, we must compare different people’s complaints, which\nwe do by comparing one principle’s treatment of me with the way\nalternative principles treat others. \nAn advantage of contractualism is that it can capture the wide range\nof considerations that are relevant to moral deliberation. All the\nconsiderations that provide individuals with reasonable grounds for\nobjecting to a proposed principle are relevant. As we saw in section\n3.2, these considerations include more than the direct (and even the\nindirect) impact of a proposed principle on individual well-being.\nThis plurality of considerations is nevertheless unified by a\nsingle normative domain or subject matter: unjustifiability. \nSome opponents of contractualism will object that contractualism is\nnot pluralist enough. They will object to the unified account of\nwrongness. Is it plausible that all the considerations relevant to\nwhat we owe to each other are unified by their relevance to whether\nthe principle permitting the conduct could be reasonably rejected? In\nour moral deliberation about right and wrong actions, are all moral\nconsiderations only relevant in virtue of how they affect whether or\nnot a principle licensing the proposed action is justifiable? \nTake for example, the claim that it is wrong to inflict gratuitous\nsuffering on persons, and sentient beings in general. Imagine someone\ntorturing someone else. A utilitarian will object that, in our grasp\nof the wrongness of the action, the most salient fact is that the\nbehaviour would inflict gratuitous suffering. This is much more\nsalient than the fact that the person could reasonably reject a\nprinciple permitting such conduct. The utilitarian concludes that\nmorality is fundamentally about the avoidance of suffering. A\npluralist will conclude instead that morality is irreducibly\nplural—some moral reasons are grounded on justifiability, but\nothers are grounded directly on suffering or pleasure. \nThe contractualist replies that what is most morally relevant in the\ncase of torture is that suffering is brought about through the\nagency of another—not just that suffering occurs. This is\nwhy being tortured is morally much worse than suffering similar\ninjuries through a lightning strike—the former is an affront to\nmy human dignity in a way that the latter is not. If we agree that\nthis is the really significant fact, then the advantage now lies with\nthe contractualist, whose moral theory explicitly gives a central\nplace to the notion of agency. (As ever, the dialectic can continue,\nas utilitarians can reply that torture is morally worse than a\nlightning strike because it involves a gross failure of benevolence).\nFor a foundational consequentialist account of morality (such as\nutilitarianism), the wrongness of the action is based solely and\ndirectly on the suffering it would cause. Against such an account, the\ncontractualist argues that the moral importance of promoting\nwell-being is always mediated via its effect on the justifiability of\nthe relevant principle: if an action fails to show sufficient concern\nfor someone’s well-being then that person has strong grounds for\nobjecting to the principle. \nIt is, furthermore, important to recall that contractualism deals in\n‘could reasonably reject’ not in ‘does\nreject’. Contractualism does not say that gratuitously causing\nsuffering is not wrong until someone objects to it, or that\ngratuitously causing suffering would not be wrong at all if\nno-one happened to object to it. There is nothing accidental about the\nfact that a particular act of gratuitously causing suffering is wrong.\nRather, gratuitously causing suffering is always intrinsically\nwrong—because it is (always and everywhere) the kind of thing\nthat provides grounds for reasonable rejection. \nContractualism and consequentialism thus gloss what is objectionable\nabout the same conduct in different ways. Instead of a decisive\nintuition that counts against contractualism, we have a case of\ndistinctive intuitions, where different theorists, beginning from\ndifferent intuitive starting points, end up with different theoretical\npriorities.  We saw earlier that, unlike utilitarianism, contractualism rejects\naggregation. However, there are some cases where\ncontractualism’s aversion to aggregation seems to lead to\nundesirable results. (For a variety of contractualist responses to\naggregation, see Reibetanz 1998, Norcross 2002, Kumar 2011, Fried\n2012a. See also sections 9 and 12, as contractualists and their\nopponents often discuss aggregation alongside either demandingness or\nrisk.) \nConsider the following situation, drawn from a\nfamous article by John Taurek (Taurek 1977). \nThe Rocks. Six innocent swimmers have become trapped on two\nrocks by the incoming tide. Five of the swimmers are on one rock,\nwhile the last swimmer is on the second rock. Each swimmer will drown\nunless they are rescued. You are the sole life-guard on duty. You have\ntime to get to one rock in your patrol-boat and save everyone on it.\nBecause of the distance between the rocks, and the speed of the tide,\nyou cannot get to both rocks in time. What should you do? \nSuppose you decide to save the lone swimmer on the second rock.\nIntuitively, this seems wrong. Surely you should have saved five\npeople instead of one. The challenge for contractualism is to explain\nwhy what you did is wrong. Utilitarians have a straightforward answer,\nbased on aggregation. You should save the five people instead of the\none simply because five deaths is a worse result than one death. This\ncase is tricky for contractualism because it rejects aggregation. The\nfive people will each want to reject the principle that\nallows you to save the one, by appealing to the fact that such a\nprinciple leaves them to die. But the lone person on the second rock\nwill want to reject any principle that allows you to save the five.\nAnd the reason for objecting to the principle is exactly the same in\neach case—this principle leaves that person to die. The\nfive people cannot appeal to the fact that there are more of\nthem—because this is not an individual reason. (Suppose you are\none of the five. The fact that four other people will die is not\nsomething you can object to, as it is not something that happens to\nyou.) It therefore looks as if we have reached a stalemate—and\nperhaps the best solution (the principle that no-one can reasonably\nreject) is to toss a coin. That way, each of the six people gets a\nfifty-fifty chance of survival. No-one can reasonably reject\nthis principle on the grounds that it only gives\nthem a fifty-fifty chance of survival, because any alternative gives\nsomeone even less chance. Tossing a coin is the only principle that\nguarantees everyone at least a fifty-fifty chance. So it is\nthe only principle that no-one can reasonably reject. \nOne contractualist response is to bite the bullet, and accept that\ncoin tossing is the right answer. Many contractualists, however, wish\nto capture the intuition that you ought to save the five. Recall that\nan agent’s reason for rejecting a principle can be based, not on\nits effect on her well-being, but on what that principle says about\nher or how it treats her. Imagine one of the five swimmers on the\nfirst rock arguing as follows: “Coin tossing is clearly the\nright principle if there is one person on each rock, as it balances\ntheir competing reasons. If you apply the same principle when there\nare five on this rock, you are saying it makes no difference that\nthere are five rather than one. So you are acting exactly as if I\nwasn’t here, facing this life and death situation. A principle\nthat allows you—in effect—to ignore my plight in this way\ndoesn’t show respect for me. If there were one person on each\nrock, their claims to be rescued would cancel out. So we then look to\nsee whether there are other people on either rock. There are several\nsuch people, and I am one of them. My claim to be rescued remains\nun-trumped. So you should rescue the five.” (For a critique of\nthis argument, see Otsuka 2001.) \nA further difficult kind of case for contractualism is where the\nburdens that different persons stand to suffer are unequal—and\nso cannot balance each other and cancel each other out—but are\nstill very severe in each case. The following example is suggested by\nDerek Parfit’s discussion of contractualism and aggregation\n(Parfit 2003). Consider a choice between two scenarios. In the first,\none person suffers agony for a hundred years; while in the second a\nmillion people suffer agony for a hundred years minus a day. An\nadditional day of agony is a considerable burden. Therefore if we\nconsider the situation from the perspective of the single individuals\ninvolved, it would seem that the first person’s complaint\n(‘I will suffer for a hundred years’) outweighs the\ncomplaint of any other single individual (‘I will suffer for a\nhundred years minus a day’). However, a utilitarian would argue\nthat, in this case, the second scenario is worse. \nA utilitarian might conclude that, while this ideal of choosing a\nscenario that is acceptable to each person from his or her personal\npoint of view is extremely appealing, it is not always attainable. In\nparticular, this ideal is not practical when we cannot avoid placing a\nsevere burden on at least one person. Contractualism focuses each\nperson’s mind on the burdens imposed on himself or herself, and\non other individuals—and invites us to withdraw our burdens if\nwe see other individuals suffering much more under a competing\nprinciple. However, in our present example, each of the individuals in\nthe second scenario would find the situation unacceptable from their\npersonal point of view, simply because of the magnitude of the\nsuffering it involves. It is not plausible that they would withdraw\ntheir complaint because the person in the first scenario stands to\nsuffer a slightly greater burden. It can be argued that in such cases\nwe should give intrinsic moral weight to the number of persons who\nsuffer a severe burden and so minimise the number of persons for whom\nthe situation is unacceptable. \nThe contractualist has several possible replies. They could simply\ndeny the utilitarian’s intuition. Perhaps it is wrong to impose\na greater burden on a single person, even to save many others from a\nslightly worse burden. Contractualists who want to capture the\nutilitarian’s intuition might argue that, just as complaints are\nnot always tied to well-being, the strength of an individual’s\ncomplaint need not be proportional to the loss of well-being. Perhaps\na principle that allows me to suffer for a century minus a day is just\nas objectionable to me as one that allows me to suffer for a century.\nOnce the complaints are on a par, we can then appeal to our earlier\ntie-breaking method, and conclude that it is wrong to favour the one\nover the many. (A utilitarian will reply that in any context a day of\nagony is an enormous moral burden—it is no less bad if the\nperson has already suffered for almost a century—so that the\ncomplaint of the individual in the first scenario has to be seen as\nsignificantly greater than that of any individual in the second\nscenario.) \nIn chapter 21 of On What Matters, Parfit presents further\narguments that can be deployed against the individualist\nrestriction—which limits the grounds for rejecting a principle\nto its implications for single people. First, Parfit presents\na series of cases where, he argues, “any contractualism that\nincorporates the individualist restriction must conflict with all\nplausible views about the distribution of benefits and burdens”\n(Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 198). One representative case is the\nfollowing (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 199–200): \nFollowing Parfit, utilitarians will object that, if we endorse the\nindividualist restriction, then “we ought to give Blue her 40\nmore years of life rather than giving 5 more years to Blue and to as\nmany as a million of these other people. … this is\nclearly false” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 200). \nSecond, Parfit offers a new argument that, when the individualist\nrestriction does enable the contractualist to reach the right\nconclusions, it cannot do so for the right reasons. Consider the\nfollowing case (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 196): \nHere, the utilitarian says that, if the number of other people exceeds\nten, then we should treat the others, as this maximises total\nwell-being. Parfit argues that “most of us would reject this\nutilitarian claim, believing instead that we ought to save Blue from\nher great ordeal. We might even believe that we ought to save Blue\nfrom her 100 days of pain rather than saving any number of\nsuch other people from their much smaller burden of 10 days of\npain” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, pp. 196–7). \nThe individualist restriction enables contractualism to diverge from\nutilitarianism in this case. Because the other people’s reasons\ncannot be aggregated, they cannot ever outweigh Blue’s reason.\nBut opponents of the individualist restriction will object that this\nis a coincidence. The real reason we should treat Blue is not because\nBlue’s burden would otherwise be greater, but because Blue would\notherwise be so much worse-off. For instance, suppose instead that, if\nwe do nothing, everyone (Blue included) will suffer 100 days of pain\n[This is Parfit’s Case Four]. We must now choose\nbetween relieving Blue of all of her 100 days, or relieving\neveryone (Blue included) of 10 of their 100 days of pain. Those who\nfavour a more impersonal formulation of contractualism will object\nthat the individualist restriction must instruct us to do the former.\n“And [this conclusion] is clearly false” (Parfit 2011,\nvolume 2, p. 202). \nIn Cases Four and Six, opponents of the individualist restriction will\nargue that we can only get the right result by allowing the other\npeople to pool their individual complaints—otherwise, they\ncannot hope to overrule Blue. Those who find this intuition compelling\nmay conclude that contractualists must drop the individualist\nrestriction, and instead accommodate Case Three by saying that\n“people have stronger moral claims, and stronger grounds to\nreject some principle, the worse off these people are” (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 202). Other contractualists may be prepared to bite\nthe bullet here, or to seek alternative ways to accommodate these\nintuitions, on the grounds that the individualist restriction is an\nessential feature of contractualism, without which contractualism\ncannot hope to escape the extreme and alienating demands of\nutilitarianism—the topic of the next section. \nImpartial theories are often accused of being unreasonably demanding.\nFor instance, consider the fact that there are very many very needy\npeople in the world. A variety of aid agencies, which currently rely\non donations from private individuals, can alleviate these needs. No\ndoubt governments, multinationals, and others could do far more than\nthey do. But the question still remains: faced with such urgent needs,\nat least some of which I could meet at comparatively little cost to\nmyself, how should I as an individual act? \nImpartial moral theories often seem to give very demanding answers to\nthis question. This is easiest to see for utilitarianism.\nUtilitarianism tells me to put my dollars wherever they will do the\nmost good. In the hands of a reputable aid agency, my dollar could\nsave a child from a crippling illness, and so I am obligated to donate\nit to the aid agency. I should give my next dollar to an aid agency,\nand I must keep donating till I reach the point where my own basic\nneeds, or my ability to keep earning dollars, are in jeopardy. Most of\nmy current activities will have to go. Nor will my sacrifice be only\nfinancial. According to utilitarianism, I should also spend my time\nwhere it will do most good. I should devote all my energies to aid\nwork, as well as all my money. \nPerhaps we would admire someone who behaved in this way. But is it\nplausible to claim that those of us who do not are guilty of\nwrongdoing; or that we have a moral obligation to devote all our\nresources to charity? Such conclusions strike many people as absurd.\nThis leads to the common objection that utilitarianism is unreasonably\ndemanding, as it leaves the agent too little room (time, resources,\nenergy) for her own projects or interests. \nThis is a serious objection to utilitarianism. If contractualism can\navoid a similar fate, then this will be a significant advantage. But\nis contractualism less demanding than utilitarianism? It certainly\nseems possible that contractualism will generate very demanding\nprinciples, as it seems reasonable for those who are starving to\nreject any principle permitting me to retain inessential resources\nrather than meeting their most basic needs. I would then be doing\nsomething wrong unless I do all that I can to save other\npeople’s lives—at least until I reach the level below\nwhich I would be giving up necessary components of my own\nwell-being. \nA similar problem for contractualism is presented by Thomas Nagel, who\nargues that, in the present state of the world, it may be impossible\nto construct any set of principles which no-one can\nreasonably reject. Any possible principle of aid will either make\nunreasonable demands on the affluent (from their point of view), or\npay inadequate attention to the basic needs of the destitute (from\ntheir point of view). If the notion of reasonable rejection is at\nleast partly determined by the agent’s own perspective, then any\nprinciple will be reasonably rejected by someone. (Nagel 1991 and\n1999). \nContractualists might reply that principles of aid presuppose some\nbackground set of entitlements, guaranteeing me the free use of my own\nresources. This raises two problems. The first is that, from the fact\nthat I own something, it does not follow that I do not have an\nobligation to give it away. The most that might follow is that others\nmay not force me to do so. The second problem is that, if our overall\ntheory is Contractualist, then the property rights themselves must be\ngiven a Contractualist justification. We need a system of property\nrights no-one can reasonably reject. Any system where property rights\nare very unequally distributed will be rejected by those who miss\nout. \nHow might contractualism reply to this demandingness objection? Like\nany impartial moral theory, contractualism can bite the bullet, and\nargue that morality is very demanding. The contractualist apparatus\nexplains why morality is demanding—if we seek to act in\na way that we could justify to others, then we must adopt principles\nthat no-one can reasonably reject. Given the state of the world, these\nprinciples will seem very demanding to those who are\naffluent—but the alternative would be principles that place an\neven greater burden on those who are worst-off. \nFor instance, Scanlon himself reaches the following principle through\ncontractualist reasoning: \nThis principle could make very significant demands, especially if we\nwere continually facing situations where a slight sacrifice would save\nsomeone’s life. If my sacrifice is much less than the very bad\nthing I prevent, it is hard to see how I can reasonably reject this\nprinciple. \nMore controversially, one of us has argued previously that analogous\nreasoning leads to an even more demanding principle. \nIf the ‘great sacrifice’ is nevertheless significantly\nless bad than the ‘very bad thing’ that might happen, it\nis hard to see how I can reasonably reject this principle. If the\n‘very bad thing’ is an agonising death, this principle can\nbe very demanding indeed. \nIt may be argued that even if this stringent principle follows from\ncontractualism, that is not a problem for the theory. Perhaps, in the\ncurrent state of the world, we should expect any moral theory grounded\non each person’s equal moral status to be extremely demanding,\ngiven the drastic and irrevocable impact on those in need if they are\nnot helped, and the fact that there are constantly so many in this\nposition (Ashford 2003, p. 292–2). \nHowever, many moral philosophers—contractualists\nincluded—seek a more moderate moral theory. If contractualism is\nto avoid being extremely demanding, the challenge is to stop short of\nthe stringent principle. We need to find a principle that allows me to\nchoose my own lesser good over a (significantly) greater good for\nsomeone else—and then to show that this principle cannot be\nreasonably rejected. For instance, suppose I spend my spare evening\n(and spare income) going to the movies rather than donating the time\nand money to a charity which could thus have saved someone’s\nlife. We need an explanation of why those who die as a result cannot\nreasonably reject the principle that permits this behaviour. \nThe most promising answer lies, once again, in the possibility that my\ngrounds for rejecting a principle are not necessarily confined to its\ndirect impact on my well-being. I might reject a principle requiring\nme to devote all my time and energy to charity, not simply because of\nthe burdens it imposes on me but because, in leaving me no room for my\nown personal projects, it fails to respect me as a person. (The\ndestitute person will reply that a principle allowing me to leave her\nto starve fails to respect her as a person. The challenge for the\ncontractualist is to distinguish these two complaints. For one\nattempt, see Kumar 2000.) \nResponding to Parfit’s presentation of the convergence argument,\nand his critique of the individualist and impersonal restrictions,\nScanlon notes that, because it rejects those restrictions, any\nimpersonal reformulation of contractualism is much more demanding than\nthe original formulation of contractualism (Scanlon 2011). This charge\nhas a particular dialectical significance, as rule consequentialists\noften present their theory as a more moderate alternative to the\nextreme demands of act consequentialism. If it retains those\nrestrictions, contractualism will always be less demanding than these\nalternative theories—even if its demands are greater than\ncommonsense morality might normally expect. \nQuestions of substantive responsibility arise when we must decide who\nwill bear what burdens. “To hold a person who has ended up\nburdened to be substantively responsible for that burden is to hold it\nto be hers to bear, ceteris paribus. No one owes it to her to share or\nalleviate it.” (Kumar 2015, p. 252) Kumar explains the\ncontractualist account of substantive responsibility as follows.\n“A person who ends up burdened is substantively responsible for\nit if no one owed it to her to do more to enable her to avert it. To\nhold her not to be wronged in ending up burdened just is to hold her\nto be substantively responsible for it. The reasons that are relevant\nto the justification of why she is not wronged are those that\nestablish that she has good reason to want what happens to her in that\ntype of situation to depend on how she responds to alternatives, and\nthat enough was done to secure that dependence.” (Kumar 2015, p.\n253) \nContractualism claims to offer an intuitive account of when agents can\nreasonably be expected to bear burdens. Critics argue that this\npromise is illusory and that contractualism fails to respect our\nintuitive judgements of substantive responsibility. (Williams 2006,\nVoorhoeve 2008.) \nDiscussion often focuses on the following example: \nHazardous Waste: A city’s officials need to remove and\ndispose of hazardous waste found near a residential area. This removal\nwill release some hazardous chemicals, but it is much less dangerous\nthan leaving the waste where it is. Even if the officials take all\nreasonable precautions, some hazardous material will be released\n– enough to cause lung damage to anyone directly exposed but not\nenough to pose a serious threat to anyone who stays indoors and away\nfrom the excavation site. (Scanlon 1998, p. 257; Kumar 2015, p.\n264) \nIntuitively, so long as they warn people to stay indoors while the\nwaste is being removed, the city officials can legitimately remove the\nhazardous waste. This does expose some people to a risk of serious\nharm. But all available alternatives are worse: the waste cannot be\nleft where it is, and evacuating the city is not feasible. A principle\npermitting officials to expose some people to a risk of harm in order\nto protect public health is one that no one can reasonably reject. \nSuppose the officials have done enough to reduce the risk. Leaflets\nhave been delivered to all households, announcements made on radio,\ntelevision, and social media, advertisements placed in newspapers,\nbarriers erected around the excavation site, warnings posted at all\nentrances, and so on. But now consider one citizen of the city (call\nher Curious), who is counter-suggestible. Warnings and barriers merely\nserve to pique her curiosity. Curious had no prior interest in\nhazardous waste. But she now develops a desire to see what all the\nfuss is about. Ignoring the warnings, Curious climbs over the barriers\nand exposes herself to a dangerous dose of hazardous chemicals. \nCurious’s burden results, in a fairly predictable way, from her\nown reckless choice. Intuitively, this renders her substantively\nresponsible for that burden. Curious cannot hold others responsible\nfor her burden. For instance, she cannot sue the city (or its\nofficials) to cover her medical costs. One natural explanation for\nthis intuition is the Forfeiture View: by disregarding\nwarnings, Curious has forfeited her right to expect others either to\navoid exposing her to harm or to alleviate her burden if she is\nharmed. \nScanlon rejects the Forfeiture View in favour of a Value of\nChoice account, which emphasises: “the reasons that\nindividuals have to want what happens to them, and their obligations\nto others and others’ obligations to them, to depend on how they\nrespond.” (Scanlon 2015, p. 106) On this view, it is the\navailability of choice that matters, not whether the agent\nhas made any actual choice. If I am told that I must collect\nmy theatre tickets by a certain time and I then absentmindedly fail to\ncollect them in time, then I am responsible for the fact that I miss\nthe performance. What matters is that I had the opportunity to avoid\nthis situation, even though I made no conscious decision. (Scanlon\n2015, p. 108) \nContractualist principles must be justified to each person. This\njustification must cite some reason why a given principle makes sense\nto that person. In the Hazardous Waste case, contractualists argue\nthat each person has reason to value living in a society where her\nfate depends (in part) on her own choices, even if the result is that\nshe sometimes finds herself responsible for burdens that she could\nhave avoided and has not conscious chosen. \nCritics argue that contractualists who cite the Value of Choice cannot\njustify intuitive principles in the Hazardous Waste case. The\nopportunity to choose is not valuable for Curious. On the\ncontrary, that opportunity clearly makes her worse-off! Consider the\nfollowing variant of the original case. \nCautionary vs Covert: Officials have two options for dealing\nwith hazardous waste. Under a Cautionary Policy, officials\nissue public warnings, erect barriers, and so on. Under a Covert\nPolicy, officials remove the waste in secret, depriving the\npublic of any knowledge of the risk. Suppose officials know that,\nwhile the Cautionary Policy will result in a larger number of lung\ndamage cases, every afflicted person will be someone who heard the\nwarnings and failed to heed them. By contrast, while the Covert Policy\nwill result in a smaller number of lung damage cases, none of\nthose people will have had any opportunity to avoid harm.\nWhich policy should the officials choose? (Williams 2006, p. 253;\nKumar 2015, p. 269) \nIntuitively, the officials should choose the Cautionary Policy instead\nof the Covert one, even though more people will suffer harm. Critics\nobject that contractualists using the Value of Choice cannot capture\nthis result. (Williams 2006). Consider Curious. The Covert Policy\noffers her greater protection from harm than the Cautionary Policy,\nbecause her chance of suffering harm is higher under the latter than\nunder the former. And because she is impetuously curious, warnings and\nother information have negative value for Curious. The opportunity to\nchoose only makes her worse-off. Therefore, Curious can reasonably\nreject the Cautionary Policy. \nContractualists agree that the Cautionary Policy is “the only\nmorally defensible choice” (Kumar 2015, p. 269). However, they\nargue that contractualism can deliver this result, for two reasons.\nFirst, even if the covert policy is instrumentally superior,\nall moral agents have strong symbolic reasons for “not\nwanting it to be permissible for public officials to hide important\ninformation because they decide that members of the public are not\ncompetent to assess it and respond appropriately” (Kumar 2015,\np. 270). Covert paternalism clearly fails to treat people as\nresponsible adults, and therefore everyone has reason to reject it.\nSecond, Contractualists will appeal to the need to evaluate principles\nagainst generic standpoints, rather than against the eccentric\npreferences of particular individuals.“Our assessment cannot be\nbased on the particular aims, preferences, and other characteristics\nof specific individuals. We must rely instead on commonly available\ninformation about what people have reason to want … about\ngeneric reasons.” (Scanlon 1998, p. 203) What matters is not\nwhat Curious wants, but what a representative person\nin her situation would have reason to want. And people in general have\nreason to want control over their exposure to risk. Generic reasons\nalso play a key role in contractualist accounts of risk (section 11)\nand our obligations to future people (section 13). \nMoral philosophers often discuss artificial examples involving\ncertainty. In particular, discussion of the ethics of harm focuses on\ncases where each action will definitely harm some particular person.\nBut real-life ethics invariably involves widespread uncertainty. Most\nactual “harmful” activities are socially productive ones\nthat impose some risk of harm on others. (Fried 2012a, 2012b) Can\nContractualists provide a plausible and distinctive account of when\nand why such activities are permitted? (For more detailed discussion\nof a variety of Contractualist accounts of risk, see Frick 2015, Fried\n2012a, Horton 2017, Kumar 2015.) \nWe begin with a simple example: \nDriving: Bob lives in a large city in the developed world.\nHis daily life is greatly enhanced by the fact that he and others are\nable to drive cars. Bob drives to work, drives out of town for the\nweekend, drives to the local shopping mall, enjoys goods and services\nthat are only available because others can drive, and so on. One\nmorning, while walking his dog along the street, Bob is killed in a\ntraffic accident. The driver was not at fault – she was not\nspeeding or drunk or otherwise irresponsible. Bob is just unlucky. In\na large city where millions of people drive every day, faultless fatal\naccidents like this are bound to happen from time to time. \nOver the course of his life, Bob received many benefits from his and\nothers’ driving. But suppose these are outweighed by the cost of\nhis untimely death. As things turned out, Bob would have been\nbetter-off if driving had not been permitted. This seems to give Bob a\nreason to reject any principle that permits driving. And this reason\nseems to outweigh other people’s reasons to want driving to be\npermitted. (After all, any inconvenience they suffered would not be as\nbad as an early death.) It therefore seems that contractualism cannot\npermit driving. Indeed, contractualism must prohibit all\nsocially useful activities that carry any risk of harm\n– on the grounds that, in a large population, over the course of\na lifetime, any such activity is virtually certain to lead to at least\none death. \nUtilitarians have an easy solution. Driving should be permitted if it\nmaximises expected aggregate welfare. A small risk of death is\noutweighed by a large number of individual benefits. If Contractualism\ncannot permit any risky activities, then this places it at a distinct\ndisadvantage against utilitarianism. \nOne simple solution is to restrict the scope of contractualism. If\ncontractualism deals only with cases where harm is certain, then it\nneed not address risk at all. We could then combine a contractualist\naccount of certain harm with a utilitarian account of risks of harm.\nUnfortunately, this solution has a high cost. Given the ubiquity of\nrisk, and the comparative rarity of cases of certain harm, this\npluralist option effectively sidelines contractualism. \nA second simple solution is to bite the bullet, and insist that risky\nsocial activities are never permitted. Few contractualists embrace\nthis extreme revisionism. And it too threatens irrelevance. People\nwill never abandon risk altogether, and we naturally turn to ethical\ntheory to guide us through our risky activities. If contractualism is\nsilent in this crucial area, then it loses any claim to be of\npractical relevance. \nThe challenge for contractualism is to steer a middle-way between\nbanning risk altogether and collapsing into utilitarianism. \nOne central question is whether our contractualist evaluation of risk\nshould be ex post or ex ante. Contractualism tells us to justify our\nmoral principles to each person. A principle permitting driving must\nbe justified to Bob. But when do we imagine this justification\noccurring? Suppose we were to offer Bob a choice between two\nprinciples: one permits driving and the other forbids it. When does\nBob make this choice? Does he choose in advance – perhaps before\nhe moves to the city or before his life begins? Or does he choose in\nretrospect – after he knows how his life has actually gone? \nIn cases involving risk and uncertainty, these two temporal\nperspectives represent very different epistemological standpoints. Ex\nante, Bob knows that living in a city where driving is permitted\nexposes him to a very small risk of death in a car accident where no\none is at fault. Ex post, Bob knows that living in a city where\ndriving is permitted has in fact resulted in his death. \nSome forms of contractualism explicitly favour ex ante rather than ex\npost evaluation. Rawls, for instance, asks his parties to choose\nprinciples to govern their society on the basis of general knowledge\nabout how their lives might go, rather than particular information\nabout their specific circumstances. Scanlonian contractualism, by\ncontrast, usually requires justification to actual people who are\naware of their own situation. In his 1998 book, Scanlon explicitly\nfavours ex post justification. However, most contractualists\n(including Scanlon himself) now favour either ex ante contractualism\nor some hybrid view combining both ex ante and ex post evaluations.\n(Scanlon 2013, Kumar 2015, Frick 2015.) \nIn our original Driving case, ex ante justification seems to delivers\nthe intuitively correct result. When he views the prospects in\nadvance, Bob may well conclude that the very small risk of death is\noutweighed – from his own perspective – by the large\nnumber of benefits he is almost certain to enjoy. If the imbalance is\nsufficiently great, we might conclude that it would not be reasonable\nfor Bob to reject a principle that permits driving. (Some extremely\nrisk-averse individuals will perhaps still object to driving, but\ncontractualists can reply that this rejection is not reasonable.) \nUnfortunately, there are two problems with this contractualist\nresponse. First, if all citizens face the same pattern of risks and\nbenefits, then this ex ante justification threatens to collapse into\nutilitarianism in practice. Contractualism thus risks losing its\ndistinctiveness. Second, if citizens face different risk profiles,\nthen even ex ante contractualism may still find itself unable to\njustify any risky behaviour. Consider a new example: \nFlying: Commercial air travel brings many benefits to many\npeople. However, it also brings small risks of death. Some of this\nrisk falls on people who benefit from air travel – notably\npassengers. But some people exposed to the same risks enjoy no\nbenefits. Jeb is an Amish farmer who completely eschews all the\n‘benefits’ of modern life. Jeb lives under the flightpath\nof air traffic between two major cities. (Jeb was not consulted about\nthis flightpath.) One day, debris from a passing airplane falls on Jeb\nand kills him. (This example is adapted from Kumar 2015, which draws\non Ashford 2003.) \nJeb obviously has a strong ex post complaint against any principle\npermitting flying. But he also has an ex ante complaint. Even before\nhe knows that he will be killed by falling debris, Jeb expects no\nbenefit whatsoever from flying. (Indeed, he does not regard flying as\ntruly beneficial to anyone!) Jeb will want to reject in advance any\nprinciple that imposes on him a risk of death without any compensating\nbenefits. From a contractualist perspective, this rejection seems\nreasonable. \nThe two challenges for ex ante contractualists are (a) to offer a\nprincipled justification for rejecting Jeb’s complaint; and (b)\nto ensure that that justification does not collapse into\nutilitarianism. One possibility is to argue that, like Curious, Jeb is\ntoo eccentric for contractualist purposes. We should be asking what\npeople in general have reason to reject, rather than examining the\nstrange predilections of singular individuals. However, unlike\nCurious’s counter-suggestible risk-seeking, Jeb’s\nrejection of modern life is considered and (prima facie) reasonable.\nIf contractualism rejects Jeb’s considered worldview as\n“unreasonable”, then he might object that contractualism\nthereby fails to treat him with the respect due to a rational\nagent. \nA better alternative for the contractualist is to focus on broader\nprinciples that apply to all risky activities, rather than artificial\nprinciples relating only to flying. Jeb gains no benefit from air\ntravel. But he, along with everyone else, does benefit from living in\na society where everyone is free to pursue their own goals according\nto their own values. Jeb thus has reason to reject any principle that\nprevents people in general from pursuing reasonable lifestyle options,\neven if some of those options impose small risks of death on\nothers. \nAnother problem for ex ante contractualism is that, in some other\npossible cases, it is ex post evaluation that seems most appropriate.\nContrast two scenarios introduced by Frances Kamm (Kamm 2007, p. 273;\nFried 2012a, p. 47): \nAmbulance I: Should our city authorize its ambulances to\nspeed on the way to the hospital whenever it is the case that doing so\nwill save five sick passengers for every one pedestrian who is killed\nas a result of the speeding? \nAmbulance II: Should our city also prohibit its ambulance\ndrivers from braking to save an identifiable pedestrian’s life\nwhenever it is the case that the time lost by braking will cause the\nfive passengers inside the ambulance to die? \nMany people judge that the first policy is permissible while the\nsecond is not. (Kamm 2007, Lenman 2008) This leads some\ncontractualists to favour hybrid view that combine ex post and ex ante\nevaluation. (e.g., Lenman 2008) It is one thing to ask everyone to\nagree in advance to a policy that will predictably result in the\ndeaths of some pedestrians, but another thing altogether to ask\nthis particular pedestrian to lay down her life for the\ngreater good! \nUnfortunately, critics of contractualism allege that hybrid views\nproduce implausible results of their own in cases where the parties\nhave asymmetric information about their fate. (Fried 2012a, pp.\n53–54) Consider a final case introduced by Sophia Reibetanz\n(Reibetanz 1998): \nUnexploded Mines: One hundred workers are working in a field\nknown to contain an unexploded mine. Another person, Z, is the only\none who could disarm the mine. If Z disarms the mine, then Z is\ncertain to get pneumonia. If Z doesn’t disarm the mine, then it\nis certain that 1 of the 100 workers will be seriously injured. This\nserious injury is ten times worse than suffering pneumonia. \nZ faces a certainty of (minor) harm, while each worker faces a 1%\nchance of (greater) harm. If Z is allowed to appeal to this\ninformation asymmetry, then Z’s complaint trumps the complaint\nof any individual worker. Z can thus reasonably reject any principle\nthat requires Z to disarm the mine. But this seems counter-intuitive,\nas the certain result is a much greater harm for someone else. The\nchallenge for hybrid contractualists is either to avoid this result or\nto explain why it is justified. (Ostuka 2011, Reibetanz 1998. For an\nargument that contractualism cannot solve this problem, see Fried\n2012a, p. 54) \nSocial contract theories notoriously leave out non-human animals. If\nall moral obligations are between parties to the social contract, then\nwe have no obligations regarding animals who cannot be parties to the\ncontract. So (for instance) torturing non-rational animals cannot be\nwrong. By contrast, utilitarians have no difficulty explaining why it\nis wrong to torture animals. This seems to place contractualism at a\ncomparative disadvantage. Can contractualism provide an adequate\naccount of our moral obligations to animals? Does it need to? \nScanlon offers two solutions. The first is to limit the scope of his\naccount. Contractualism is not an account of the whole of morality,\nbut only an account of the morality of what we owe to other persons.\nThis leaves open the possibility that our obligations to animals fall\noutside this part of morality. Scanlon also explicitly puts aside any\nmoral obligations we might have in regard to the natural environment\n(Scanlon 1998, p. 179).  \nScanlon also suggests a possible way that obligations to animals could\nbe accommodated within contractualism. This is via the notion of\ntrustees, to whom justifications of proposed principles can be\noffered, on behalf of the animals they represent (Scanlon 1998, p.\n183). \nUtilitarians will object that this second solution provides too\nindirect an account of what ultimately grounds our obligations to\nanimals. The fact that it is wrong to inflict unnecessary pain on\nanimals is not most plausibly explained via the notion of whether this\nbehaviour could be justified to a trustee of the animals. Rather, it\nis wrong simply because of the suffering the animal feels. A\nutilitarian will add that, once we realise that this is what is wrong\nin the case of animal suffering, we should draw the same conclusion\nabout human suffering. It is their capacity for suffering rather than\ntheir capacity for rational agency that plays the most salient role in\nexplaining the wrongness of torturing humans. \nA contractualist can reply as follows. Contractualism captures the\ncentral sense of wrongness, one that plays a role in how individuals\nunderstand what they are accountable to one another for. The case of\nanimals shows that this is not the only notion of wrongness. But, once\nwe reflect on the differences between the two cases, we see why our\nobligations to one another are so different from any obligations we\nmight have to animals—precisely because we cannot meaningfully\njustify ourselves to them. Animals are not a special problem\nfor the contractualist, but rather an opportunity to explore what is\ndistinctive about the contractualist approach. \nAnother problem facing any social contract theory concerns our\nobligations to future people. It is hard to see how we can have any\nobligations to such people, as they cannot be parties to our contract.\nThis is principally because of the absence of any possibility of\nmutually advantageous interaction between distant\ngenerations. The quality of life of future generations depends to a\nvery large extent on the decisions of the present generation. By\ncontrast, our quality of life is not affected at all by their\ndecisions. We can do a great deal to (or for) posterity but posterity\ncannot do anything to (or for) us. This power imbalance is often\ncharacterised in terms of the absence of Hume’s\n“circumstances of justice”. (The phrase is borrowed from\nRawls 1971, pp. 126–130.) \nFor contractarians, for whom morality is an agreement for\nmutual advantage, it follows that we have no obligations to future\npeople with whom we cannot interact. A similar problem arises for\nthose like Rawls who seek to base the social contract on some\nmodification of self-interested behaviour—such as self-interest\nbehind the veil of ignorance. \nContractualism, by contrast, easily avoids this particular problem, as\nit begins by assuming that moral agents are motivated by a desire to\njustify themselves to others. There is no reason why those others must\nbe currently existing people. When deciding how to act, I can ask\nmyself whether future people who are affected by my actions might\nreasonably reject a principle permitting those actions. For instance,\nif I want to construct a power plant that will leak radiation in the\nfuture, it makes perfect sense to ask whether those who will suffer as\na result might reasonably object to my behaviour. Because it works\nwith the possibility of reasonable rejection—rather than actual\nbargaining—contractualism can accommodate obligations to future\npeople. This is a significant advantage over other social contract\ntheories. \nHowever, there is a second problem regarding future people—one\nthat does seem to apply to contractualism. This problem owes its\nprominence in recent philosophical debate to the work of Derek Parfit,\nto whom we owe the following example (Parfit 1984, pp.\n351–379): \nMary’s behaviour seems morally wrong. Utilitarians have a simple\naccount of why Mary’s behaviour is wrong, as she brings about\nless human happiness than she could have done. Yet it seems that\ncontractualism cannot capture this intuition. Consider a principle\npermitting Mary’s behaviour. If Mary’s behaviour is wrong,\nthen this principle must be one that someone can reasonably reject.\nBut who? Not the Winter Child—because he would otherwise never\nhave existed at all. And not the Summer Child—because he\ndoesn’t exist. \nPerhaps the most promising contractualist defence lies, once again, in\nthe possibility that my grounds for rejecting a principle are not\nnecessarily confined to its direct impact on my well-being. We might\nseparate two moves the contractualist can make here. They might argue\n(1) that the grounds for rejecting a principle need not be its impact\non my well-being; or (2) that it need not be its impact on\nmy well-being. Intuitively, what is objectionable about\nMary’s behaviour is not anything to do with well-being, or with\nthe identity of future individuals. What is wrong is rather that Mary\nfails to show adequate respect for ‘her future\nchild’—whoever that child may turn out to be. Even though\nthere is no particular individual who can be said to have been harmed,\nthere is still legitimate ground for a complaint that a principle\npermitting Mary’s behaviour shows inadequate respect to future\npeople. The challenge for the Contractualist is to translate this\ncomplaint into one that can be made on behalf of the Winter Child.\n(For one recent attempt at such a translation, see Kumar 2003a, 2009.\nFor a critique, see Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 235) \nIn chapter 22 of On What Matters, Parfit argues that the\nimpersonalist restriction—which rules out appeals to the\nimpersonal goodness or badness of outcomes—leaves any form of\ncontractualism that incorporates the individualist restriction unable\nto respond to the non-identity problem. \nInstead, Parfit argues that contractualists should permit both\npersonal and impartial reasons as grounds for\nreasonable rejection. Impartial reasons, here, are grounded\nin the moral claims or the well-being of individuals. “We have\nsuch impartial reasons to care about the well-being of every\nindividual or person” (Parfit 2011, volume 2, p. 238). The\ncrucial feature of impartial reasons is that they are not narrowly\nperson-affecting. In a different people choice, we have an impartial\nreason to maximise the well-being of future people—even though\ndifferent possible futures include different groups of possible\npeople. “Since [because of the non-identity problem] we cannot\nappeal to the personal reasons that are had by people who\nnever exist, we should appeal to the impartial\nreasons that are had by people who do exist” (Parfit\n2011, volume 2, p. 240). \nAs with the individualist restriction, we might wonder whether the\nadmission of impartial reasons effectively abandons the spirit of\ncontractualism. If every present person has the same impartial\nreasons, and if those reasons cannot outweigh any individual’s\npersonal reasons, then the resulting more impartial formulation of\ncontractualism will converge with rule consequentialism. But does this\nresult tell us anything interesting about Scanlon’s\ncontractualism? More generally, will the resulting theory retain the\ndistinctive features of contractualism that appeal to those who are\nunsatisfied with familiar alternatives such as Kantian ethics or rule\nconsequentialism? \nDebates about future people also connect to other recent controversies\nwithin contractualism, especially the literature on risk. The divide\nbetween ex post and ex ante justification is especially significant in\nnon-identity cases, where ex post justification can be offered to\nparticular individuals while ex ante justification can only deal with\nperson types. Should contractualists give their person-affecting\nprinciples an ex post or ex ante interpretation? (Weinberg 2003 and\n2015 defends an ex post interpretation, albeit within a Rawlsian\nframework rather than a Scanlonian one; while Parfit 2017 clearly sets\nout the ex ante alternative.) \nAnother emerging debate is whether contractualism can deliver\nplausible verdicts in cases involving risks of human extinction. The\nprima facie problem for contractualism here is that, because the\noutcome where we fail to avoid imminent extinction contains no future\npeople at all, there is no (particular or representative) future\nperson who has the standing to reasonably reject principles\ninstructing present people to ignore extinction risks and focus\nentirely on meeting present needs.
