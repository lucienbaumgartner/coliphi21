The foundationalist’s thesis in short is that all\nknowledge or justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of\nnoninferential knowledge or justified belief.\n\n\nA little reflection suggests that the vast majority of the\npropositions we know or justifiably believe have that status only\nbecause we know or justifiably believe other propositions. So, for\nexample, I justifiably believe that there is at least one dog in our\nneighborhood, because I justifiably believe that my next door neighbor\nhas a dog; I justifiably believe that our garbage will get picked up\ntomorrow, because I justifiably believe that tomorrow is Tuesday and\nthat our garbage gets picked up every Tuesday; and I justifiably\nbelieve that there is going to be at least some rain in the next week,\nbecause I justifiably believe that the forecast calls for a good deal\nof rain, and forecasts are almost always right when it comes to\nsimilar short-term forecasts in this area. And the dependence seems to\nbe inferential in nature: in each case, I justifiably believe the\nformer only because I have inferred it, or at least am readily able to\ninfer it, from the latter. Foundationalists about epistemic\njustification (knowledge) want to contrast my inferentially justified\nbelief (knowledge) with a kind of justified belief (knowledge) that\ndoesn’t involve the having of other justified beliefs\n(knowledge). There is no standard terminology for what we shall\nhenceforth refer to as noninferential or foundational justification\n (knowledge).[1]\n \n\nMany interesting and difficult questions can be raised about the\nrelation between justification and knowledge, including whether\nknowledge should be analyzed in terms of justification, as\nepistemologists traditionally seem to have thought, or the other way\n round.[2]\n In what follows we will concentrate on foundationalism about\njustification, though much of what we say also applies to\nfoundationalism about knowledge. \n\n\nEpistemologists commonly distinguish between doxastic and\npropositional justification. Very roughly, one has\npropositional justification when one has justification for belief\nin a proposition—i.e., when one possesses good reasons,\nevidence, or justification to believe a proposition. One has doxastic\njustification when one not only has justification to believe a\nproposition but also believes the proposition and believes it\nat least partly on the basis of good reasons, evidence, or\njustification one has. For ease of exposition, much of our discussion\nis put in terms that most naturally refer to doxastic\njustification—e.g., “justified belief”, “being\njustified in believing”. However, even when we use such terms,\nwe focus on propositional justification (which is also required for\ndoxastic justification) and assume that the other conditions involved\nin believing on a proper basis are satisfied. (For more on the basing\nrequirement, see the entry on\n the epistemic basing relation.)\n \n\n\nA foundational or noninferentially justified belief is one that does\nnot depend on any other beliefs for its justification. According to\nfoundationalism, any justified belief must either be foundational or\ndepend for its justification, ultimately, on foundational beliefs.\nHistorically, foundationalism was very widely, almost universally\naccepted. Aristotle argued that “not all knowledge is\ndemonstrative” (i.e., not all knowledge is based on an argument\nfrom other things known), and that some knowledge must be\n“independent of demonstration” (Posterior\nAnalytics, I.3). Many of the medieval philosophers seemed in\nagreement with Aristotle, holding that all knowledge must rest on\n“first principles” or “self-evident truths” of\nsome sort. More recently, Descartes famously held that all knowledge\nmust rest on a secure foundation of indubitable truths (see the entry\non\n Descartes’s epistemology).\n Many other philosophers of the early modern period, including Locke,\nLeibniz, Berkeley, Hume, and Reid, all seemed to accept\nfoundationalism as well, despite disagreeing about much else. When an\nargument was implicitly or explicitly offered for the view, it was\nmost often some version of the now famous epistemic regress argument.\n(See Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics, I.3, for an early\nversion of this argument.) Before presenting the argument we should\ndiscuss a principle it depends on. \nSuppose I claim to be justified in believing that Fred will die\nshortly and offer as my evidence that Fred has an untreatable and\nserious form of cancer. Concerned, you ask me how I discovered that\nFred has cancer, and I respond that it is just a hunch on my part. As\nsoon as you become convinced (perhaps after further questioning) that\nI have no good reason to suppose that Fred has cancer, you will\nimmediately conclude that my suspicion about Fred’s condition\ngives me no justification for believing that Fred will soon die.\nGeneralizing, one might suggest the following principle: \nTo be justified in believing P on the basis of E one\nmust be justified in believing E. \nNow consider another example. Suppose I claim to be justified in\nbelieving that Fred will die shortly and offer as my justification\nthat a certain line across his palm (his infamous\n“lifeline”) is short. Rightly skeptical, you wonder this\ntime what reason I have for believing that palm lines have anything\nwhatsoever to do with length of life. As soon as you become satisfied\nthat I have no justification for supposing that there is any kind of\nprobabilistic connection between the character of this line and\nFred’s life, you will again reject my claim to have a justified\nbelief about Fred’s impending demise. That suggests that we\nmight expand our principle to include a second clause. \nPrinciple of Inferential Justification (PIJ):\nTo be justified in believing P on the basis of E one\nmust be (1) justified in believing E, and (2) justified in\nbelieving that E makes probable P. \nOne might note that in the palm reading example there actually is no\nsignificant, objective probability between the length of Fred’s\nso-called “life-line” and his life span. Perhaps this is\nwhy my belief that he is going to die soon is unjustified, and not\nthat I don’t satisfy clause (2). Against this, the proponent of\nPIJ might ask us to consider an amendment to the case. Suppose that,\nsurprisingly, it turns out that there is some objective,\nsignificant probabilistic connection between “life-lines”\nand the life spans of the individuals who have them, though again,\nsuppose that I do not have any justification for believing that there\nis such a connection. This possibility seems coherent: the fact that\nthe relevant objective probabilistic relation obtains is not\nsufficient for one to have justification for believing that it\nobtains. But then, intuitively, I remain unjustified in believing that\nFred is going to die soon. Or consider the possibility that I believe\nFred will die because he has just ingested a lot of hemlock, and when\nyou ask me why I think hemlock would lead to death, I say that\nI’m not sure, that it is just a hunch on my part that it is\ngoing to kill him. Again, if I lack justification for believing that\nhemlock is a deadly poison, or that it is likely to have this effect,\nthen intuitively, I lack justification for believing that Fred will\ndie soon. What more, then, is needed? A natural though controversial\nsuggestion is that one must satisfy something like clause\n(2).[3] \nWith the first clause of PIJ, one can present a relatively\nstraightforward epistemic regress argument for foundationalism. That\nclause basically says that one cannot acquire justification for a\nbelief by inferring it from an unjustified belief. It also seems that\none cannot acquire justification for a belief by way of a circular,\ninferential justification—one cannot rely even in part on a\nproposition as a premise in an inference in support of that very\nproposition. We seem left with two options: allow that some beliefs\nhave justification without depending on other beliefs, or suppose that\nall justification is inferential. If all justification is inferential,\nthen for someone S to be justified in believing some\nproposition P, S must be in a position to legitimately\ninfer it from some other proposition E1. But E1 could\njustify S in believing P only if S were justified\nin believing E1, and if all justification were inferential,\nS would have to infer it (or at least be able to infer it) from\nsome other proposition justifiably believed, E2, a proposition\nwhich in turn would have to be inferred from some other proposition\njustifiably believed, E3, and so on, ad infinitum. But\nfinite beings cannot complete an infinitely long chain of\nreasoning—arguably, even an infinite being cannot complete an\ninfinitely long chain of reasoning; if it were completed, it would no\nlonger be infinite. And so, if all justification were inferential, no\none could be justified in believing anything at all to any extent\nwhatsoever. \nThis, however, is not yet an argument for foundationalism as much as\nan argument against what we might call\n“inferentialism”—the view that all justification is\ninferential—for it leaves open the skeptical position that we\nare not, and could not be, justified in believing anything at all,\nwhether by inference or otherwise. This most radical of all\nskepticisms seems absurd (it entails that one couldn’t even be\njustified in believing it). But, strictly speaking, none of this shows\nthat we have non-inferential justification for any of our beliefs, or\neven that non-inferential justification is possible. At best, it shows\nonly that, if justification is possible, or if we\nare or could be justified in believing anything at all, then\nthat justification must take a foundationalist structure. The\nepistemic regress argument for foundationalism thus needs an\nadditional premise, though one that all but the most radical skeptics\nwould accept: that epistemic justification is in principle possible\nfor beings like us.  \nIf we accept the more controversial second clause of PIJ, the looming\nregresses proliferate. Not only must S above be justified in\nbelieving E1, S must also be justified in believing that\nE1 makes likely P, a proposition he would have to infer\n(if there are no foundations) from some other proposition F1,\nwhich he would have to infer from F2, which he would have to\ninfer from F3, and so on ad infinitum. But S\nwould also need to be justified in believing that F1 does in\nfact make likely that E1 makes likely P, a proposition\nhe would need to infer from some other proposition G1, which he\nwould need to infer from some other proposition G2, and so on.\nAnd he would need to infer that G1 does indeed make likely that\nF1 makes likely that E1 makes likely P, and so\non. Without noninferentially justified beliefs, it would seem that we\nwould need to complete an infinite number of infinitely long chains of\nreasoning in order to be justified in believing anything! \nPIJ is controversial, especially its second clause. It is important to\nnote that either clause of the principle can be used by itself to\ngenerate the allegedly vicious regress for the philosopher who rejects\nfoundations. It is the two clauses combined that are supposed to\npresent the anti-foundationalist with an infinite number of vicious\nregresses. A number of philosophers (among them foundationalists)\nwould argue that the second clause of PIJ confuses levels of epistemic\nquestions. It is far too strong to require someone to have a justified\nbelief in a probabilistic connection between available evidence and\nthe conclusion reached on the basis of that evidence. Such a\nrequirement is at best plausible for having second-level\njustification, justification for the epistemic belief that one has an\ninferentially justified belief. In responding to a challenge presented\nto one’s having an inferentially justified belief in P on\nthe basis of E, one might find oneself searching for\njustification to support the claim that E makes probable\nP, but that is only because in the context of the challenge one\nis trying to support or justify the claim that one has a justified\nbelief. A similar claim might be made with respect to clause (1) of\nthe principle, although it is more difficult to generate the\nsupporting intuition. \nIn any event, the careful foundationalist is certainly not\nconfused about level-distinctions. The foundationalist who\nsupports PIJ is claiming that a necessary condition for\nsomeone’s having an inferentially justified belief in P\nbased on E is that the person have both a justified belief in\nE and a justified belief in the proposition that E makes\nP probable. It is simply not enough that E is true or\nthat E does in fact make probable P. Our original\nexamples used to support PIJ would seem to reinforce that conclusion.\nEven if there happened to be some bizarre connection between palm\nlines and length of life, for example, the person who has no reason to\nbelieve that such a connection exists has no justification for\nconclusions reached about length of life based on this anatomical\nfeature of people. Similarly, even though there is in fact a\nconnection between ingesting hemlock and dying, a person who had no\nreason to believe that ingesting hemlock would bring about death has\nno justification for believing that someone (who has just ingested\nhemlock) is about to die.  \nThere are responses to the charge of vicious regress facing\nanti-foundationalists. One is to deny the premise that circular\ninferences are vicious or no good: granted, one can’t\neffectively convince someone who is skeptical of the truth of P\nthat it is true by relying on an inference that ultimately comes back\nto P, but perhaps circular inferences can provide justification\ndespite being dialectically ineffective (i.e., ineffective in\npersuading others). Still, it seems odd to say that one could justify\nP by use of an inference from P . After all, if\nP is already justified, the subject does not need to use it to\njustify P; and if it is not justified then, in line with the\nfirst clause of PIJ, one could not use it to justify P. More\nplausibly, the anti-foundationalist might reject the presupposition\nthat all justification is linear or one-directional, that it flows\nfrom one belief to another, or is inherited by a belief from others.\nAccording to coherentism about epistemic justification, beliefs are\njustified “holistically” rather than in a linear,\npiecemeal way. Each belief is justified by virtue of its coherence\nwith the rest of what one believes—in other words, by virtue of\nbelonging to a coherent set or web of beliefs. The coherentist avoids\nthe appearance of vicious circularity by insisting that one\nneedn’t first have justification for believing the\nother propositions in one’s belief system. The coherence\ntheorist’s response to the argument for foundationalism is, of\ncourse, only as plausible as the coherence theory of justification\n(see\n coherentist theories of epistemic justification). \nOne other response is to embrace infinitism and hold that an infinite\nregress is not necessarily vicious or problematic. Infinitism has a\nfew defenders (e.g., Peter Klein (1998) and more recently, Fantl\n(2003) and Aikin (2011)). The infinitist accepts the need to be\nable to supply non-circular justification for believing what\nwe do, but argues that given the complexity of the human mind and its\ncapacity to entertain and justifiably believe an infinite number of\npropositions, there is nothing vicious about the relevant regresses we\nface. There is no reason to suppose that we would be unable to justify\nevery proposition we believe by appeal to some other different\nproposition which we justifiably believe. Infinitism is a view that\nshould be seriously considered, particularly once one realizes that\none not only can but arguably does have an infinite number of\njustified beliefs (e.g., that 2 is greater than 1, that 3 is greater\nthat 1, and so on.). \nFoundationalists are united in their conviction that there must be a\nkind of justification that does not depend on the having of other\njustified beliefs They nevertheless disagree radically among\nthemselves as to how to understand noninferential justification. In\nthe latter part of the 20th century, the rise of\nexternalist epistemologies has generated even more fundamentally\ndifferent versions of foundationalism. It will not be possible to\nsurvey all of the strikingly different analyses or theories that have\nbeen offered of noninferential justification. In what follows we will\nexamine a few of the more prominent versions of classical and\ncontemporary internalist and externalist foundationalism. \nDescartes is often taken to be the paradigm of a classical\nfoundationalist. Determined to build knowledge on appropriate and\nsecure foundations, he seemed to want to identify foundational\nknowledge with infallible belief. Implicitly or explicitly, others\nseemed to follow his lead by restricting noninferentially justified\nbeliefs to beliefs that cannot be mistaken. Following Lehrer (1974:\n81) we might formulate the following definition of infallible belief:\nS’s belief that P at t is infallible if\nS’s believing P at t\n entails[4]\n that P is true. \nAs Lehrer and others have pointed out, it is far from clear that this\nconcept of infallible belief has much relevance to an attempt to\nunderstand the epistemic concept of noninferential justification. The\nfirst and most striking problem involves necessary truths. Every\nnecessary truth is entailed by every proposition, and thus if I happen\nto believe a necessary truth, P, that I believe P will\nentail that P is true. Thus by the above definition my belief\nthat P will be infallible whenever P is a necessary\ntruth even if P is far too complicated for me to prove and I\nbelieve it solely on a whim. \nFurthermore, a foundation of knowledge and justified belief restricted\nto infallible beliefs (as defined above) would arguably be far too\nflimsy to support any sort of substantial epistemic edifice. There are\na few contingent propositions that are entailed by the fact that they\nare believed. My belief that I exist entails that I exist, that I have\nat least one belief, that someone has beliefs, that experience\n(broadly construed) exists, etc. But once we get past these sorts of\n“self-referential” propositions, propositions whose very\nsubject matter is encompassed by the fact that they are believed, it\nis hard to come up with uncontroversial examples of contingent\ninfallible beliefs. Ayer (1956: 19) argues that as long as the belief\nthat P is one state of affairs and P’s being the\ncase is an entirely different state of affairs (not including as a\nconstituent the former) there can be no logical absurdity in the\nsupposition that the former could occur without the latter (see\nBonJour 1985: 27, for a similar argument).  \nIt may be that classical foundationalists start off on the wrong foot\nif they seek foundations in logical relations between the mere fact\nthat someone believes some proposition and the proposition’s\nbeing true. Noninferential justification is, after all, a kind of\njustification, and if the impossibility of error is essential to\nnoninferential justification, it may be more plausible to locate the\nsource of infallibility in a special kind of justification available\nin support of a belief. Let us say that S’s belief is\ninfallibly justified at t when S’s ground or\njustification for believing P at t entails the truth of\nP—in other words, when S cannot have that ground\nor justification for believing that P and while P is\nfalse. The suggestion, then, is that a belief is noninferentially\njustified only if it is infallibly justified in this sense. \nWe still need to qualify the entailment in some way to circumvent the\nproblem discussed earlier. Whenever I have any justification at all\nfor believing a proposition that turns out to be necessarily true,\nthat justification will entail the necessary truth. But we do not want\njust any sort of justification to yield infallibly justified belief,\neven if the object of that belief is a necessary truth. This problem\nis notoriously difficult to solve, but intuitively the solution should\nhave something to do with the relation between the fact that would\nmake true the proposition entailed and the fact that would make true\nthe proposition that entails it. More specifically, we could say that\nP entails* Q only if the fact that would make P\ntrue is at least a constituent of the fact that would make Q\ntrue. This suggestion can be considered at best only preliminary since\nwe will obviously need a more detailed account of facts and their\nconstituents. That I have grey hair entails that someone has grey\nhair, but is my having grey hair a constituent of the fact that is\nsomeone’s having grey hair? There is certainly a sense in which\nit is something one can point to in answer to the question “What\nmakes it true that someone has grey hair?” One cannot\nappropriately point to my having grey hair as something that makes it\ntrue that two plus two equals four. With some such relation in place,\nperhaps we can appropriately restrict the class of necessary truths we\ncan be infallibly justified in believing, and still allow contingent\ntruths to be infallibly justified: there is a sense in which one can\n“point” to one’s own experience when asked,\n“What makes it true that you are in pain?” \nConsider again my belief that I’m in pain (when I am). If such a\nbelief is noninferentially justified, in what does the justification\nfor that belief consist? What is it that distinguishes this belief\nfrom my belief about, say, whether it will rain next week? Some\nfoundationalists want to locate the noninferential justification in\nthe truth-maker for the proposition believed. What justifies me in\nbelieving that I’m in pain when I am is the mere fact that\nI’m in pain. But again, what is it about my being in pain as\nopposed to its raining next week which makes it appropriate to claim\nthat my being in pain justifies me in believing that I’m in pain\nwhile its raining next week doesn’t justify me in believing that\nit will rain next week? \nIt is tempting to think that the foundationalist is better off\nappealing to some special relation that I have to my pain\nwhich makes it unnecessary to look to other beliefs in order to\njustify my belief that I’m in pain. It is the fact that I have a\nkind of access to my pain that no one else has that makes my\nbelief noninferentially justified while others must rely on inference\nin order to discover that I am in this state. This takes us to another\nclassical version of foundationalism, the acquaintance theory. Perhaps\nthe best known proponent of an acquaintance theory is Bertrand Russell\n(1910–11, 1913; for more on the acquaintance theory, see entry\non\n knowledge by acquaintance vs. description).\n But it takes little imagination to read the view into most of the\nBritish empiricists. Roughly the view is that what justifies S\nin believing that he is in pain is the fact that S is\nacquainted with his pain in a way in which he is not acquainted with\nany contingent facts about other people, the physical world, the\nfuture, and so on. Russell (1910–11) characterizes acquaintance\nas a relation of direct or immediate awareness, a relation in\nwhich, as he and some others have put it, something is\n“presented” or simply “given” to the subject\n(Lewis 1929 and 1946; Moser 1989: 80ff.; Fales 1996).  \nSome doubt that acquaintance with some fact is sufficient, on its own,\nto justify belief in a corresponding proposition. To help see the\nmotivation for this, consider inferential beliefs again. A justified\nbelief that P cannot provide justification for believing every\nother proposition it entails, for it might be that the entailment\nrelation is beyond one’s cognitive grasp, or the inference is\nnot something one is able to make. (As already discussed in\n section 1,\n this might lead us to accept the second clause of PIJ.) Similarly,\nsome acquaintance theorists argue that acquaintance with some fact\ncannot provide justification for a belief in the absence of an\nawareness of (or at least an ability to become aware of) the relevance\nof the fact to the truth of the proposition believed. For example, I\nmay be acquainted with a very specific color or shape in my visual\nfield, and also believe (correctly) that I am experiencing\nsuch-and-such a color or shape, but I might actually be really bad at\nidentifying such specific features and my belief might be little more\nthan a lucky guess. Suppose these theorists also accept a\ncorrespondence conception of truth according to which, roughly, a\nproposition is true just in case it corresponds to the facts or to the\nway the world is; they might add that to be fully justified in\nbelieving a proposition to be true one must be acquainted not only\nwith the fact that makes the proposition true but also with the\nrelation of correspondence that holds between the proposition and the\nfact. For example, in order to be justified in believing that I am\nexperiencing fuchsia, I must be acquainted with (or at least be able\nto become acquainted with) the “match”, “fit”,\nor correspondence between my thought or belief that I am experiencing\nfuchsia and the fact that I am experiencing\n fuchsia.[5] \nWhen acquaintance with the fact that P is part of what\nconstitutes my noninferential justification for believing P,\nthere is a trivial sense in which my noninferential justification is\ninfallible. I can’t be directly acquainted with the fact that\nP while I believe P falsely. However, most contemporary\nfoundationalists are fallibilists about foundational justification:\nthey hold that one could be foundationally justified in believing\npropositions that are false. It seems plausible that I could be\njustified in believing, for example, that I am experiencing a mild\npain when in fact I am experiencing an itch, or that I could be\njustified in believing I am experiencing a specific shade of color\nwhen I am in fact experiencing a slightly different shade. Even some\nacquaintance theorists (e.g., Fumerton 1995) allow that one can be\nnoninferentially justified in believing P by virtue of being\ndirectly acquainted with a fact very similar to, but ultimately\ndifferent from, the fact that P (the fact that makes P\ntrue). Such an acquaintance theory could allow for the possibility of\nnoninferentially justified but false belief that P. Huemer\n(2007), Poston (2010), and Tucker (2016) argue, however, that\nclassical foundationalists have difficulty accommodating fallible\nfoundational beliefs. For some replies, see Fumerton (2010 and 2016),\nand Hasan (2013). \nNot all classical foundationalists require acquaintance with the\ncorrespondence (or some other similar relation) between some thought\nor proposition and a distinct fact for one to have knowledge by\nacquaintance. For example, according to McGrew (1995, 1998), for any\nobject of acquaintance or direct awareness it is possible to form a\nbelief in which a demonstrative concept refers directly to it. By\nvirtue of my acquaintance with a painful experience, I can believe\ndirectly of it that it exists, or that the property demonstrated,\npainfulness, is instantiated. We could express the belief roughly by\nsaying “I am experiencing this.” For this kind of\nbelief (unlike most other beliefs regarding contingent facts), to\ngenuinely understand or grasp the content of the belief is to\ngrasp its truth. Such demonstratively formed beliefs are guaranteed to\nbe true:  \nFor what this belief amounts to is that one has a certain experience;\nand a necessary condition for the formation of the belief itself is\nthat one be having just that experience. (McGrew 1995: 90)  \nRather than attempt to accommodate fallible foundations, McGrew\nfollows early classical foundationalists in arguing that infallibility\nor infallible justification (what he calls\n“incorrigibility”) is in fact required for noninferential\njustification. Some worry, however, that such foundations, even if\nthey are generally available, are too “thin”: that I am\n“experiencing this”doesn’t seem to convey\nanything about what sort of experience I am having, and it is\ndifficult to see how we could get from here to justified beliefs that\ninvolve categorizing or conceptualizing our experiences in more\ninformative ways (see, e.g., Sosa 2003). \nOnce the received view, classical foundationalism has come under\nconsiderable attack in the last few decades. Here we will consider the\nmost prominent objections that target the classical view of\nfoundational beliefs. (For some more objections and discussion, see\nentry on\n knowledge by acquaintance vs. description.) \nLaurence BonJour (1985: ch. 4) raised a highly influential objection\nto foundationalism (an objection raised before he joined the ranks of\nfoundationalists). The objection presupposed a strong form of what we\nmight call access internalism. (We discuss the internalist/externalist\ncontroversy in more detail in\n section 6\n below.) The access internalist argues, roughly, that a feature of a\nbelief or epistemic situation that makes a belief noninferentially\njustified for us must be a feature to which we have actual or\npotential access. Moreover, we must have access to the fact that the\nfeature in question is relevant to the truth or probability of what we\nbelieve. So suppose some foundationalist offers an account of\nnoninferential justification according to which a belief B is\nnoninferentially justified only if it has some characteristic\nX. BonJour then argues that the mere fact that the belief has\nX could not justify the believer in holding B. The\nbeliever would also need access to the fact that B has X\nand that beliefs of this sort are likely to be true. But according to\nthe strong access requirement BonJour accepts, this requires actual or\npotential knowledge or justified belief that B has\nX and that beliefs of this sort are likely to be true. So\nB would need other justified beliefs for its justification.\nB’s status as a noninferentially justified belief is\ndestroyed.  \nBonJour presented the objection on the way to developing a coherence\ntheory of empirical justification. But it ultimately became obvious\nthat the objection to foundationalism, if good, was too strong. Given\nthe structure of the argument it should become evident that the\ncoherence theory (and any other theory) would be equally vulnerable to\nthe argument. Just replace “X” with some\ncomplicated description of beliefs cohering with each other. Coherence\nof one’s beliefs would never be sufficient for justification,\nfor one would have to already be justified in believing that\none’s beliefs were coherent and that such coherence makes\none’s beliefs likely to be true. That might suggest to the\nclassical foundationalist that strong access internalism is a view to\nbe avoided. \nMichael Bergmann (2006: chs. 1 and 2) argues, however, that if to\navoid regress we drop the strong access requirements that are so dear\nto some internalists, we also lose the motivation for the view. As\nBergmann sees it, the attraction of internalism is its claim to be\nable to construe justification in such a way that it gives a subject\nwith a justified belief a certain assurance from the subjective\nperspective, an assurance that externalist views (discussed below)\ndon’t offer. According to Bergmann, even acquaintance with truth\nbearers, truth makers and a correspondence holding between them\ndoesn’t carry with it assurance unless it is accompanied by a\njustified belief that all these relations obtain. And this will take\nus again on the road to regress. Bergmann’s challenge is serious\nand the traditional acquaintance theorist who rejects the strong\naccess requirement will need to convince you that a believer\ncan’t stand in those relations of acquaintance without acquiring\nassurance of the truth (see Hasan 2011 for a reply along these lines).\nAlternatively, the internalist might attempt to convince you that the\nregress that comes with accepting the strong access requirement is not\nvicious after all (see Fales 2014). \nBonJour was quite aware that some classical foundationalists would\nattempt to avoid the regress problem raised in the previous section by\nappeal to the idea that some things are simply “given” to\nus, or that we directly “apprehend” or are\n“acquainted with” them. Inspired by Sellars (1963),\nBonJour (1978, 1985: ch. 4) presented the following objection to\nclassical foundationalism, often referred to as the “Sellarsian\nDilemma”. Does the awareness or acquaintance that is the alleged\nsource of noninferential justification involve the acceptance of a\nproposition or thought, or at least the categorization of some sensory\nitem or the application of some concept to experience? If, on the one\nhand, the acquaintance or awareness is propositional or conceptual in\nthis way, then while such acts or episodes of awareness seem capable,\nin principle, of justifying other beliefs, they would surely need to\nbe justified themselves. The episode of awareness would involve\nsomething like the acceptance of a proposition, or the categorization\nof experience, and such an attitude or act clearly needs justification\nif it is to justify anything else. But then, the allegedly\nfoundational belief is not foundational after all. If, on the other\nhand, we can regard direct awareness as nonpropositional and\nnonconceptual, then while these acts or states of awareness do not\nrequire or even admit of justification they also don’t seem\ncapable on their own of providing a reason or justification for\npropositional items like beliefs. Therefore, the classical\nfoundationalist’s acquaintance or direct awareness cannot serve\nas a foundational source of knowledge or justified belief. \nOne proposed solution to the dilemma begins by emphasizing that\nacquaintance with a fact is not by itself an epistemic relation. The\nacquaintance theorist can argue that one has a noninferentially\njustified belief that P only when one has the thought that\nP and one is acquainted with both the fact that P, the\nthought that P, and the relation of correspondence holding\nbetween the thought that P and the fact that P. On such\na view no single act of acquaintance yields knowledge or justified\nbelief, but when everything that is constitutive of a thought or a\nproposition’s being true is immediately before consciousness,\nthere is nothing more that one could want or need to justify a belief.\nActs of acquaintance, including acquaintance with propositions, do not\ninvolve belief, judgment, or concept application, and so do not need\njustification. However, if the objects of acquaintance, that with\nwhich we are acquainted, can be propositional, then perhaps\nacquaintance with the rights sorts of items (including propositional\nones) can make a difference to justification. This view thus grants\nthat a single act of acquaintance with a fact does not provide\njustification, but rejects the dilemma’s assumption that there\nare no acts of acquaintance that can, singly or in any combination,\nmake a difference to justification. (See Fumerton 1995 for a reply of\nthis sort. For a reply that is similar in many respects, see BonJour\n2000 and 2003.) \nA classical foundationalist who prefers McGrew’s (1995, 1998)\nview, according to which noninferentially justified beliefs are formed\nby demonstrative reference, would give a somewhat different response.\nAn act of acquaintance alone is not sufficient for justification; one\nmust also form a belief in such a way that the direct object of\nacquaintance becomes a constituent of the belief itself, or part of\nthe belief’s very content. The relevance of the truth-maker to\nthe proposition believed is transparent and guaranteed by the manner\nin which the belief is formed: acquaintance simply picks out some\nfeature of experience and takes it up into the content of a belief or\njudgment that asserts that the feature exists or is instantiated. This\nview thus grants that an act of acquaintance does not automatically\nprovide justification for a corresponding belief, but rejects the\ndilemma’s assumption that there is no way to use the act of\nacquaintance in forming one’s belief in a way that does make a\ndifference to justification.  \nThe direct acquaintance theorist does presuppose the intelligibility\nof a world that has “structure” independent of any\nstructure imposed by the mind. Without facts that are independent of\nthe thoughts and judgments that represent them, one could not make\nsense of a relation of acquaintance between a person and a fact, a\nrelation that grounds noninferential justification. More radical\ncontemporary rejections of foundationalism may well involve\ndissatisfaction with the foundationalist’s implicit commitment\nto a strong realistic correspondence conception of truth as involving\nsome relation to mind-independent facts. A discussion of problems with\nthe correspondence conception and alternatives would take us far\nafield, however. (For more, see the entry on the\n correspondence theory of truth.) \nJust as some reject the conception of truth underlying classical\nfoundationalist accounts of noninferential justification, so others\nprofess to be bewildered by some of the fundamental concepts employed\nin defining noninferential justification. The acquaintance theorist\ntends to have relatively little to say by way of analyzing what direct\nacquaintance is. To be sure, one can try to give someone a feel for\nwhat one is talking about by contrasting one’s awareness of pain\nwith the temporary distraction caused by an engrossing conversation.\nIt is tempting to suppose that for a short time the pain was still\npresent but the person with the pain was no longer aware of the fact\nthat the pain exists. This awareness, the acquaintance theorist will\nargue, is obviously something over and above mere belief in the\nexistence of the pain, as one can believe that one is in a mental\nstate (say a subconscious mental state) without being aware of that\nstate. Like most theories foundationalism will, however, ultimately\nrest its intelligibility on an appeal to a basic or primitive concept,\none that defies further analysis. Just as one needs to end epistemic\nregresses with foundational justification, the foundationalist will\nargue, so one needs to end conceptual regresses with concepts one\ngrasps without further definition. \nAlthough opponents of classical foundationalism are not always eager\nto admit it, we suspect that the primary dissatisfaction with\nclassical foundationalism lies with the difficulty the view has\navoiding radical skepticism. On infallible belief, infallible\njustification, or direct acquaintance theories of foundational\njustification, there is precious little included in the foundations of\nknowledge. Most classical foundationalists reject the idea that one\ncan have noninferentially justified beliefs about the past, but the\npresent disappears into the past in the blink of an eye. How can one\neven hope to get back the vast body of knowledge one\npre-philosophically supposes one has, if one’s epistemic base is\nso impoverished? If the second clause of the Principle of Inferential\nJustification were accepted, the problem is even more serious. One\nmight be able to convince oneself that one can know noninferentially\nthe principles of deductive reasoning, but deduction will not take one\nusefully beyond the foundations of knowledge and justified belief. As\nMill (1906: 126) argued, there is a very real sense in which one\ndoesn’t advance one’s knowledge significantly employing a\nform of reasoning that takes one only to conclusions that were\nimplicitly contained in the conjunction of one’s premises. To\nadvance beyond foundations we will inevitably need to employ\nnon-deductive reasoning and according to PIJ that will ultimately\nrequire us to have noninferential knowledge of propositions describing\nprobability connections between evidence and conclusions that are not\nlogically implied by the evidence. It is not absurd on the face of it\nto suppose that one can have noninferential a priori\nknowledge of probabilistic connections, but it is perhaps an\nunderstatement to suppose that the view is not popular (see Russell\n1948 for an excellent discussion of this issue). \nWe noted above that at least many philosophers are convinced that\nacceptance of classical foundationalism leads inevitably to an\nunacceptably radical skepticism. Some contemporary epistemologists\nseek a more modest foundationalism that will make it much easier to\nrespond to the skeptic’s arguments. Michael Huemer’s\n(2001) phenomenal conservatism and Jim Pryor’s (2000) dogmatism\nare both views that are far more “permissive” in allowing\na far more extensive range of beliefs to have foundational\njustification. And their views are not unrelated to Chisholm’s\nlongstanding efforts (e.g., 1989) to locate noninferential\njustification for believing various propositions about one’s\npast and physical environment in the character of one’s\nexperiential states. \nHuemer offers his view as an improvement on a cruder view once\ndefended by Chisholm (1980) that is often called “epistemic\nconservatism” and sometimes, more aptly, “doxastic\nconservatism”. The doxastic conservative takes the mere fact\nthat you find yourself believing some proposition P to be a\nprima facie justification for believing the proposition in\nquestion. This view does not imply that the mere fact that you believe\nsomething renders the belief justified, for it may be that your belief\nis prima facie justified but not ultima facie\njustified: if you have good reasons to disbelieve P, or good\nreasons to think that your belief that P is unreliable or\nuntrustworthy, then your belief is “defeated” and not\njustified. In other words, according to doxastic conservatism, if\nS believes that P then, in the absence of\ndefeaters, S has justification for believing that\nP. \nMany worry that the view is vulnerable to counterexamples, for it\nseems committed to regarding beliefs that clearly have nothing going\nfor them as justified. One of the better counterexamples involves\ncases in which one forms a belief in a proposition one has no evidence\nfor or against. Suppose that despite lacking any evidence for or\nagainst the belief, S somehow comes to believe that there is an\neven number of grains of sand on a particular beach (Foley 1983:\n174–5), or that a particular coin that is tossed and lands out\nof sight has landed “tails” up (Christensen 1994: 74).\nSuppose also that S lacks any defeaters for the belief:\nS has no evidence against the proposition, and is no longer\naware of having formed the belief without evidence or in an unreliable\nway. Doxastic conservatism yields the counterintuitive result that\nthis belief is rational or justified. (For an attempt to respond to\nthis and related objections, see McCain 2008.)  \nIn any event, most foundationalists sympathetic to internalism prefer\na view according to which a non-belief state provides justification\nfor noninferential belief. According to phenomenal\nconservatism, the justifying state is a “seeming” or\n“appearance”: if it seems to S that\nP, then, in the absence of defeaters, S thereby has some\ndegree of justification for believing that P (Huemer 2001,\n2007, 2013; Cullison 2010; Tucker 2010; Skene 2013). These appearances\ncome in various sorts: sensory or perceptual, intellectual or\nintuitive, mnemonic, and introspective. Many use the term\n“dogmatism” to refer to the same view, or to the view\nrestricted to some domain, typically to perception: if it\nperceptually seems to S that P, then,\nin the absence of defeaters, S thereby has some justification\nfor believing that P. However, it is worth noting that Pryor\nhimself uses the term “dogmatism” to refer to the view\nthat “justification is sometimes both immediate and\nunderminable” (2013: 96), and so uses the term in a way that is\ncompatible with the rejection of phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism\nas these terms are generally understood. While those who accept the\nprinciple (whether in its general form or as restricted to perceptual\nseemings) do thereby hold that some states provide immediate but\nunderminable or defeasible justification, it is possible to accept\nthat some other states provide immediate but underminable\njustification and deny that perceptual seemings do. However, for\nsimplicity and to follow the more common usage, we use the two labels\n“phenomenal conservatism” and “dogmatism” more\nor less interchangeably in what follows. \nThe main motivation for phenomenal conservatism is straightforward. As\nalready noted, the view is far more “permissive” than\nclassical foundationalism in allowing for more extensive foundational\njustification. For example, I believe that there is a cat on my lap,\nthat I had fish for dinner last night, that I feel thirsty, that I am\nthinking about getting a glass of water, that pleasure is good, and\nthat 2 + 3 = 5. Prima facie, it is plausible to say that I\nbelieve these propositions because they seem or appear to be\ntrue—because it seems to me that there is a cat on my lap, that\nI had fish last night, and so on. If I do indeed believe these things\non the basis of these seemings or appearances, and they constitute an\nadequate source of justification, then, in the absence of defeaters, I\nam justified in so believing. As Huemer has recently put it,  \nif undefeated appearances are not a source of justified belief, then\nhow is one to avoid skepticism about the external world, the past,\nvalues, abstract objects, and so on? Unless this challenge can be met,\nwe would be wise to place our trust in the appearances…. (2013:\n349) \nWhat exactly are these “seemings” or\n“appearances”? The distinction between seemings and\nbeliefs is typically introduced with examples. Once we are familiar\nwith the Müller-Lyer illusion, we no longer believe that the\nlines are of unequal length even though, in some sense, they still\nappear to be unequal. The same holds for various apparent intuitions\nand apparent memories that we become convinced are false. Huemer and\nothers will claim that seemings cannot be identified with dispositions\nto believe, inclinations to believe, or impulses to believe, though\nnot everyone will agree about this. Huemer argues for this on three\nmain grounds (2007: 30–1). First, it is possible to have a\npersisting seeming or appearance (e.g., that one line is longer than\nanother, or that a stick submerged in water is bent) but be so\nconvinced that it is a mere illusion that you have no disposition or\ninclination to believe it. Second, it is possible to be inclined to\nbelieve that P (because, e.g., you really want it to be true)\nin the absence of a corresponding seeming that P. Third,\nappearances can provide non-trivial explanations for what we believe\nor what we are disposed to believe: I am inclined to believe that\nthere is a bus approaching because it perceptually seems that there\nis; understanding the latter seeming as an inclination to believe\ntrivializes the explanation.  \nProponents of phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism thus generally\nhold that seemings are distinct from beliefs and inclinations to\nbelieve. But they also hold that seemings are nevertheless\n“belief-like” in that they are propositional attitudes or\nat least have propositional or representational contents. And they\nhold that seemings have a distinctive phenomenal character: seemings\nare “assertive” (Huemer 2013); they have a\n“phenomenal force” to them such that “it\n‘feels as if’ we can just tell that those propositions are\ntrue…just by virtue of having them so represented” (Pryor\n2000: 547, n. 23); “a seeming that P\n‘recommends’ P as true or ‘assures’ the\nsubject of P’s truth” (Tucker 2013). One\ninteresting disagreement with important implications for epistemology\nand the philosophy of mind concerns the relationship between seemings\nand sensations or sensory experiences. According to some (e.g., Huemer\n2001: ch. 4 and Tolhurst 1998) sensations are themselves a kind or\nspecies of seeming—perceptual seemings—while others (e.g.,\nTucker 2010) take sensations to be distinct from perceptual seemings,\nthough often accompanied by them. (For more on the relationship\nbetween sensations and seemings, see Tucker 2013: 7–8.) \nBoth Huemer and Pryor make clear that the intentional states that\nprovide justification do so without one’s having to be aware of\nthe fact that one is in such states. They might both allow, however,\nthat one can turn one’s attention inward to discover the fact\nthat one is in such states, and that one can, in principle, discover\n(perhaps a priori) that the states in question do give one\nthe relevant epistemic justification.  \nIn this section, we focus on objections commonly raised against\nphenomenal conservatism and dogmatism, though they arguably apply to\nother internalist foundationalist views as well. \nAs one might expect, the main worry with both Huemer’s\nphenomenal conservatism and Pryor’s dogmatism is the very air of\ndogmatism that Pryor embraces in his label for the view. It strikes\nmany epistemologists that these views make getting justification for\none’s beliefs too easy. Perhaps sensations are representational\nstates, and perhaps there is the kind of representational state that\nHuemer and other phenomenal conservatives call an appearing or a\nseeming, but as why should we assume that they accurately represent\nthe world around us? Fear is a representational or propositional\nstate, but from the fact that I fear that there are ghosts, it hardly\nseems to follow that I have a prima facie justification for\nbelieving that there are ghosts. For that matter, belief is a\nrepresentational state and if we doubt that mere belief can provide\njustification, why should we think another representational state,\nlike a seeming, provides justification? Huemer and Pryor will answer\nthat the representational states they offer as justifiers, perhaps\nbecause of their peculiar “phenomenal force” or\n“assertiveness”, are simply different in this respect.\nWhile providing no guarantee that the world is as represented, they\nsimply carry with them justification that other representational\nstates are incapable of providing. \nThe claim that phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism make getting\njustification too easy can be motivated by the “problem of easy\nknowledge”. Since this problem has been raised against both\ninternalist and externalist alternatives to classical foundationalism,\nwe present this problem in\n section 8,\n after discussing externalism. \nA recent objection to phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism involves\nappeal to cases of “cognitive penetration”, cases in which\npropositional attitudes (beliefs, fears, desires, etc.) that the\nsubject already has give rise to a related seeming. The objection\ncomes in two forms. The first is the “illegitimate boost”\nobjection. If I have prior justification to believe that P\n(e.g., that my car is in my garage), and that belief causes me to have\na seeming that P (e.g., the belief and expectation make it\nvisually seem to me that my car is in my garage when I glance quickly\nin the direction of my garage), dogmatism entails that the\nbelief’s justification goes up. The usual reply here is that the\nrelevant claim is not counterintuitive. I gain no additional\njustification via the seeming if I have a good reason to suspect that\nmy having the seeming depends on my having the belief; but in the case\nwhere I have no such reason, it is not clearly counterintuitive to say\nthat I am justified. Tucker (2013: 14) gives a useful analogy to\ntestimony: if Bill and Jill both testify to me, at different times,\nthat there is free pizza on the quad, then both testimonies give me\nmore reason to believe than either of them separately, and this still\nholds if unbeknownst to me Jill tells me only because she\nheard it from Bill.  \nThe second form of the “cognitive penetration” objection\nis sometimes called the “tainted source” objection (Huemer\n2013), and it arises from the fact that propositional attitudes other\nthan justified belief—fears and desires,\nunjustified\nbeliefs, etc.—can influence how things seem to us. Suppose, for\nexample, that Jill fears that Jack is angry with her, and that upon\nseeing Jack that fear partly causes it to seem to her that Jack is\nangry with her (Siegel 2013). Many find it counterintuitive that Jill\ncould acquire justification for her belief in this way. The natural\nsuggestion is that the etiology of the belief matters to its epistemic\njustification (see, e.g., Markie 2005, 2013; Goldman 2009; Lyons 2011;\nSiegel 2013). Once again, there are some who do not share the\nintuition that the subject’s justification is affected by the\nbelief’s causal history when that causal history is not\naccessible to the subject (e.g., Huemer 2013). But at least some\nphenomenal conservatives admit to feeling the pull of the intuition in\nresponse to some of the cases, and attempt to account for it by saying\nthat there is something else that is epistemically bad in the\nsituation—e.g., while the belief is epistemically justified, the\nagent is epistemically irresponsible, criticizable, or cognitively\ndefective in some way (e.g., Skene 2013), or lacks the sort of\njustification that can turn true belief into knowledge (e.g., Tucker\n2010). Some worry, however, that not all the problematic\n“tainted source” cases can be handled in these ways (see\nMarkie 2013 and McGrath 2013.) \nThe epistemic landscape has changed dramatically in the last thirty or\nforty years with the rise of externalist epistemologies. It is\nnotoriously difficult to define clearly the controversy between\ninternalists and externalists in epistemology. (For a detailed\ndiscussion of alternative ways of defining the controversy, see\nFumerton 1995: chs. 3 and 4. See also the entry on\n internalist and externalist conceptions of epistemic justification.) \nThere are at least two common ways of understanding the controversy.\nIt is sometimes taken to be a controversy over whether or not one can\nidentify epistemic properties with “internal” states of\nbelievers. According to the view we might call “internal state\ninternalism” (sometimes called “mentalism”),\njustification is analyzed in terms of or depends essentially and only\non what is inside the mind. It follows on this view that no two\nindividuals can be internally or mentally alike and yet differ in the\njustification they have for the same beliefs. In one sense, then, to\nbe an externalist (a non-mentalist) is to claim that one’s\njustification involves or depends essentially on some facts or states\nof affairs outside the mind. Others take the controversy to center\nover the question of whether one requires certain sorts of access for\njustification. The “access internalist” holds (roughly)\nthat being justified in believing that P requires that there be\nsomething within or at least available to one’s perspective or\nawareness which is relevant to the truth or justification of P.\n(While some access internalists seem to have held that everything that\ndetermines justification must be accessible, as we are about to see,\nhardly any internalists hold such a strong position.) The\n“access externalist” denies that justification requires\nany such access. The access externalist need not deny that something\nrelevant to the truth of P is, at least sometimes,\naccessible to the subject who has justification for P; but\nparadigm externalists deny that access is always required for\njustification.  \nSome accept both forms of “internalism”, though perhaps\ntake one sense to be more fundamental than the other. For example, one\nmight take access internalism to be more fundamental, and hold that\none can have access only to mental states and internal facts about\nthem, and so accept mentalism as a consequence. Or one might take the\nmentalist thesis to be more fundamental, and argue that one has some\nminimal access to the relevant mental facts, and so accept some form\nof access internalism as well. But it is possible to accept one form\nof internalism and reject the other. Some mentalists might deny that\nwe have access to all the mental states or features that make a\ndifference to justification. And some access internalists might hold\nthat we can be directly aware of external objects, external states of\naffairs, or external abstract entities or relations, and take this\ndirect awareness to make a difference to one’s justification;\nthey would deny that one’s justifiers must always be mental,\nthough they might accept the thesis that there can be no difference in\njustification without a mental difference, assuming that\naccess even to a non-mental entity counts as a mental\nrelation or mental state. \nAccess internalisms vary depending on what sort of\n“access” is required (true belief, justified belief,\nacquaintance, etc.), and on what it is that must be accessed for\njustification. There are thus stronger and weaker forms of access\ninternalism, and as a result the epistemic landscape is quite complex.\nCertainly, paradigm externalists would reject the second clause of the\nPIJ. According to virtually all externalists, one can arrive at a\njustified belief in P by inferring it from E without\nbeing aware of any sort of evidential connection between E and\nP; the fact that there is a good evidential connection between\nE and P can be external to the subject’s mind and\ninaccessible to the subject. They would also reject a parallel\nprinciple for noninferential justification: one can arrive at\na justified belief on the basis of some sensory or other\nbelief-independent input without being aware of any sort of evidential\nconnection between the input and the belief. Phenomenal conservatives\nand dogmatists tend to agree with the paradigm externalist in\nrejecting the requirement that one grasp a connection between\none’s epistemic grounds or evidence and the proposition believed\n(though they deny that external conditions like reliability discussed\nbelow are also needed for justification). However, externalists\ntypically allow that in principle one could have a foundational belief\nin the absence of any appearance or seeming. Some epistemologists have\ncombined some modest internal requirements with externalist ones in\ntheir accounts of epistemic justification (see, for example, Alston\n1989 and Steup 2004). \nWhile the externalist defends radically different views than those of\nclassical foundationalists, the structure of knowledge and\njustification that emerges from such theories is still often a\nfoundationalist structure. We might first illustrate the point by\nexamining the view defended by the most prominent of the externalists,\nAlvin Goldman’s\n reliabilism.[6]\n The fundamental idea behind reliabilism is strikingly simple.\nJustified beliefs are reliably produced beliefs. Reliably produced\nbeliefs are beliefs that are the product of a reliable process, and a\nreliable process is one that yields beliefs that are usually true (or\nwould usually be true if enough of them were\n generated).[7]\n Justified beliefs are worth having because justified beliefs are\nprobably true. \nGoldman initially distinguished two importantly different sorts of\njustified beliefs—those that result from belief-independent\nprocesses and those that result from belief-dependent processes. The\nformer are processes that take as their “input” stimuli\nother than beliefs; the latter are beliefs produced by processes that\ntake as their input at least some other beliefs. So, for example, it\nis possible that we have evolved in such a way that when prompted with\ncertain sensory input we immediately and unreflectively reach\nconclusions about external objects. And we may live in a world in\nwhich beliefs about the external world produced in this way are\nusually true (or would usually be true if enough of them were\ngenerated). Such beliefs will be justified by virtue of being the\nproduct of reliable belief-independent processes. This is basically\nthe “base clause” of the reliabilist’s analysis, a\nprinciple of foundational or noninferential justification: if a belief\nis the product of a reliable belief-independent process, then it is\njustified. Reliabilists generally add to this a condition requiring,\nin effect, that there be no defeaters available to the\nsubject—e.g., no good reason or justification to think that the\nbelief is false, unreliable or untrustworthy. (Specifying the needed\n“no defeater” condition in the base clause without using\nepistemic terms like ‘justification’ and\n‘reason’ is a nontrivial matter. Goldman (1979) proposes\nadding the condition that there be no reliable belief-withholding\nprocess available to the subject.) These foundational beliefs can in\nturn be taken as input for reliable belief-dependent processes in\norder to generate still more justified beliefs. A belief-dependent\nprocess is “conditionally” reliable if its output beliefs\nare usually (or would usually) be true if the relevant input beliefs\nare true. The output beliefs of conditionally reliable\nbelief-dependent processes are justified, provided that the input\nbeliefs are justified. This is basically the “recursive\nclause” of the reliabilist’s analysis, a principle of\nnonfoundational or inferential justification: if a belief is the\noutput of a conditionally reliable belief-dependent process, and the\ninput beliefs are justified, then (absent defeaters) the output belief\nis justified. \nThe above is a crude sketch of Goldman’s early\nreliabilism—he later modified it to deal with a number of\nobjections. But the sketch is enough to bring out the foundationalist\nstructure inherent in a reliabilist account. The reliabilist actually\naccepts the first clause of PIJ, and avoids the epistemic regress by\nembracing a kind of justified belief that does not owe its\njustification to the having of other justified beliefs. Any undefeated\nbelief resulting from a reliable belief-independent process is\njustified. No other beliefs are involved in the justification. So,\nsuch beliefs are foundational. \nIt should be noted that Goldman (1979) himself denies that one could\ngive a strict definition of an evaluative or normative epistemic term\nlike ‘justification’ without using other, similar\nevaluative or normative terms. Still, he is interested in providing\n“substantive conditions”, conditions that specify, in\nnon-epistemic terms, when a belief is justified. In that sense,\nGoldman remains interested in providing a general and substantive\ntheory of justification. \nWe have illustrated the way in which an externalist account of\njustified belief can exemplify a foundationalist structure by\nexamining one of the most prominent versions of externalism,\nreliabilism. But other versions of externalism are also implicitly or\nexplicitly committed to a version of foundationalism, or, at the very\nleast, give an account of justification that would enable one to\ndistinguish noninferential from inferential justification, direct from\nindirect knowledge. Consider, for example, a crude version of the\nso-called causal theory of knowledge according to which one knows a\nproposition when one believes it and the belief is caused (in the\n“right” way) by the very fact that makes true what is\nbelieved. On such an account one can distinguish causal chains leading\nto the belief in question that involve intermediate beliefs from those\nthat do not. Using this distinction, one can again define a\ndistinction between foundational and nonfoundational knowledge:\nroughly, the causes of belief that do not include other beliefs are\nthe ones that would be foundational\n knowledge.[8] \nExternalist versions of foundationalism are probably attractive to\nmany because they seem to allow at least the possibility of a much\nexpanded foundational base of justified beliefs. Unlike the Cartesian\nview, the reliabilist’s distinction between noninferentially and\ninferentially justified belief has nothing to do with whether the\nbeliefs are somehow infallible or infallibly justified. If nature has\nbeen co-operative enough to insure the evolution of cognitive agents\nwho respond to their environmental stimuli with mostly true beliefs,\nthen there might be an enormous store of foundational knowledge upon\nwhich we can draw in arriving at inferentially justified conclusions.\nOn most externalist accounts of noninferentially justified belief\nthere are literally no a priori constraints on what might end\nup being noninferentially justified. Any proposition might have been\nbelieved as the result of the operation of some conceivable sort of\nreliable belief-forming process. Moreover, many epistemologists hold\nthat justifiers must in some way be truth-conducive or probable, and\nthe requirement of reliability (or some other such external condition)\nmakes the connection to the truth explicit. In contrast, non-classical\ninternalist foundationalist views like phenomenal conservatism\nthreaten to sever the connection between justification and truth or\nprobability, for it is possible that propositions that seem true are\nmostly false.  \nA full evaluation of externalist versions of foundationalism is far\nbeyond the scope of this entry (see the entry on\n internalist and externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n Here we must inevitably be selective, and focus on reliabilism for\nillustration (see entry on\n reliabilist epistemology). \nThe very ease with which the externalist can potentially broaden the\nfoundational base of knowledge or justified belief is, ironically, one\nof the primary concerns of those philosophers unhappy with externalist\nepistemology. One of the best-known objections to externalism attempts\nto show that the externalist’s conditions for foundational\nbelief are not sufficient for justification. Recall that for the\nreliabilist a belief is justified if it is the product of a reliable\nbelief-independent process and there are no defeaters for the belief\navailable to the subject. Consider BonJour’s (1985: ch. 3) case\nof Norman: We can imagine that Norman is a highly reliable\nclairvoyant, that his clairvoyance produces a belief that the\nPresident is in New York. Suppose also that he does not realize that\nhe is a clairvoyant, and that he has no reasons or evidence for or\nagainst the belief or the reliability of whatever process produced it.\nIntuitively, Norman’s belief is unjustified. Or consider\nLehrer’s (1990) case of Truetemp, who, without knowing it, has a\nchip implanted in his head that produces very precise and highly\naccurate beliefs about the ambient temperature. Truetemp often gets\ntemperature beliefs from the operation of the chip, but he has never\nchecked their correctness. Intuitively, Truetemp’s belief that\nthe temperature is now exactly 47 degrees is not justified.\nReliabilism seems to yield the wrong result, justifying too many\nbeliefs.  \nThere have been a number of attempts to respond to such cases. One\nresponse is defended by Bergmann (2006: ch. 1 and 2) and was already\ndiscussed above in connection with regress problems for access\ninternalism\n (section 3.1).\n Proponents of the objection often claim that what the cases suggest\nis that there must be something the subject is aware of or has access\nto that makes a difference to his perspective on the truth or\nappropriateness of the belief. Bergmann argues that this requirement,\nas tempting or intuitive as it may be, leads to serious regress\nproblems. (For some replies on behalf of internalism, see Rogers and Matheson 2011, Hasan 2011,\nand Fales 2014.) \nMany others attempt to accommodate these intuitions in some way.\nGoldman (1986) argues that in the cases described it is natural to\nthink that subjects like Norman do have defeaters available, and this\nexplains our intuition to regard them as unjustified. However, many,\nincluding some other reliabilists, think it is easy to further specify\nor amend the cases to ensure that the defeaters are not available\n(Lyons 2009: 123–4). Some accept a modest form of internalism,\nintroducing a relatively weak access requirement, e.g., that the\nsubject must have an experience or accessible mental state that is in\nfact a reliable way to arrive at beliefs, though the subject need not\nhave access to the reliability of the experience (Alston 1989).\nHowever, there seem to be many possible cases, including versions of\nthe cases of Norman and Truetemp, where these conditions are satisfied\nbut the intuition is the same; we might suppose for example that some\nphenomenological sensation, like some unusual sort of itch, headache,\nor olfactory sensation, is in fact a highly reliable indicator of the\ntruth of their beliefs regarding the whereabouts of the President or\nthe ambient temperature. This intuitively makes no difference when\nthey are unaware that it is reliable (see Lyons 2009: 125).  \nA more recent attempt to respond to the Norman and Truetemp cases adds\na restriction for basic or noninferential beliefs: they must be\nperceptual beliefs, beliefs produced by a “perceptual\nsystem” (see Lyons 2009: ch. 4, for more on what counts as a\nperceptual system). Lyons (2009: ch. 5) argues that the original\nNorman case doesn’t specify whether the belief is a product of a\nperceptual system, and in the Truetemp case it is the product of an\nimplanted chip and not a perceptual system; he also argues that once\nwe change the details to make the beliefs the result of perceptual\nsystems the intuitions seem to change. For example, imagine that\nNorman* is like Norman except that he belongs to an alien species all\nmembers of which have clairvoyant abilities, thanks to their evolved\nperceptual organs and reliable processes of information transfer.\nLyons claims that, intuitively, someone like Norman*’s belief\nthat the President is in New York is justified, even if Norman* is not\naware of the existence or reliability of such processes. \nJust as the cases of Norman and Truetemp are designed to show that\nreliabilism makes getting foundational justification too easy, other,\nsimilar cases seem to show that reliabilism make getting\nnonfoundational justification too easy. Suppose, for example,\nthat while you are asleep a group of logician-neuroscientists implant\na device in your head that takes some of your highly reliable\nfoundational beliefs (say, introspective or perceptual beliefs) as\ninput and responds by selecting at random from a list of complex\ntheorems of logic and producing a belief in that theorem. Intuitively,\nsuch beliefs are not justified despite their high degree of\nreliability. (This example is taken from Lyons 2009: 126). One\nintuitive diagnosis is that the relation between the output beliefs\nand input beliefs is not evidential or inferential, or the process by\nwhich the output beliefs are generated is not an evidential or\ninferential one. The challenge for the reliabilist who wants to avoid\nsaying that such beliefs are justified, and avoid adding internalist\nconstraints, is to provide a better account of inferential processes.\nTo retain its externalism, the account must not have good inference\ndepend on awareness of or access to a logical or probabilistic\nconnection between propositions believed. \nThe objections discussed above challenge the sufficiency of the\nexternalist’s proposed conditions for justification. However,\neven if the above counterexamples to sufficiency are met, we might\nquestion whether the externalist’s conditions capture something\nessential to or necessary for foundational justification, or for the\njustification of other beliefs on the basis of foundational ones. Is\nunconditional, belief-independent reliability, for example, really\nnecessary for justification at the foundational level? And is\nconditional, belief-dependent reliability really necessary for the\njustification of other beliefs?  \nThe “new evil demon problem” (Lehrer and Cohen 1983; Cohen\n1984) challenges the claim that externalist conditions like\nreliability really are necessary. Suppose that there is a subject that\nis just like you in all internal respects, except that while your\nbeliefs are (let’s assume) reliably produced, your twin’s\nor counterpart’s are not, for his or her beliefs are produced by\na powerful deceiving demon. Intuitively, your twin is no less\njustified than you are. But given that your twin’s beliefs are\nnot reliable, the reliabilist must say that your twin’s beliefs\nare not justified. \nVarious responses have been proposed. Some see no significant problem\nwith denying that the evil demon victim is unjustified. If this is not\na blanket rejection of the appeal to intuitions, it would help to\naccount for the intuitions in some way, and some responses that appeal\nto an ambiguity in “justification” could be understood as\ndoing just that. For example, Goldman (1988) says that the\ncounterpart’s belief is “weakly justified” in the\nsense that the belief, though formed by an unreliable process, is one\nthe subject is epistemically responsible or blameless for having, but\nthe belief is not “strongly justified” in the sense that\ninvolves reliability. This does not seem to be adequate, for\nintuitively, there is something positive about the deceived\ncounterpart’s situation that is not captured by saying that he\nis epistemically responsible or blameless. A subject who reasons in\naccordance with principles that are horribly defective in ways he\ncannot detect may have tried his best and be as epistemically\nblameless as an evil demon victim who attends carefully to his\nexperiences and follows good principles of reasoning, but\nthere’s something clearly positive about the latter’s\nepistemic situation that goes beyond epistemic blamelessness (see Audi\n1993: 28, and Pryor 2001: 117 for discussion of this point). Some\nexternalists like Bach (1985) and Engel (1992) posit a similar sort of ambiguity between doxastic and\npersonal justification, i.e., between a belief’s being\njustified and a person’s being justified in holding the\nbelief, so that the demon victim is justified in believing as he does,\nbut his beliefs are not justified. Kvanvig and Menzel (1990) object that a person’s\nbeing justified in believing something entails that their belief is\njustified, so that the distinction cannot help with the problem, but\nLittlejohn (2009) argues that there is no such entailment, that the\ndistinction between personal and doxastic justification is coherent\nand well-motivated, and that it can help with the new evil demon\nproblem.  \nRather than simply deny the intuition, or explain it away by positing\nan ambiguity, a number of reliabilists attempt to accommodate the\nintuition by amending the conditions for justification. An earlier\nresponse by Goldman (1986) attempts to defend “normal worlds\nreliabilism” according to which a subject’s belief is\njustified if the process producing the belief is reliable in normal\nworlds, where a “normal world” is, roughly, a world where\nour general beliefs about the actual world are true. It is no surprise\nthat Goldman himself was quick to give this up. One obvious worry with\nthis response is that it rules out even the possibility that\n“abnormal” processes like clairvoyance be justified.\nAnother is that it rules out the possibility that our general beliefs\nabout the world are unjustified (Pollock and Cruz 1999: 115). More recently, some have\nsuggested more sophisticated amendments to the conditions or to the\nsort of reliability required so as to accommodate the intuition while\navoiding the problems of normal worlds reliabilism (see\nComesaña 2002; Majors and Sawyer 2005; Henderson and Horgan\n2006). \nWe end by presenting the “problem of easy knowledge” that\nhas been raised against both internalist and externalist alternatives\nto classical foundationalism (see Cohen 2002 for an initial\nformulation of the problem). The problem as presented there has two\nmain forms. The first involves cases of deductive closure. Suppose, to\nuse an example from Cohen (2002), that I am looking to acquire a red\ntable for my room and do not want to end up with a table that only\nlooks red—e.g., a white table illuminated by red lights. Suppose\nthat upon looking at a particular table I find that it seems red to\nme. If phenomenal conservatism is true, then I can arrive at\nknowledge, or at least justified belief, by the following simple\ninference: \nThe same goes for the following inference:  \nThe problem is that it seems implausible that I could come to be\njustified in believing—let alone know—that the table is\nnot a white table illuminated by red lights merely on the\nbasis of its looking or seeming to be red. Of course, I may and often\ndo have independent reasons to trust that the colors of tables are\nnormally the way they look (colored lights are rare, I don’t\nnotice any such lights, etc.), and the above argument makes no mention\nof that. But given phenomenal conservatism or dogmatism, a perceptual\nseeming alone would confer justification for beliefs of the form (1)\nin the absence of defeaters, whether or not one had good independent\nreasons to take the seeming to be trustworthy. Similarly, given\nreliabilism, a reliable perceptual process alone would confer\njustification for beliefs of form (1) in the absence of defeaters. The\nsame applies to the second inference: it is implausible that I could\ncome to be justified in believing that I am not a handless\nbrain-in-a-vat that merely seems to have hands on the basis of a\nperception or perceptual seeming that I have hands.  \nIt is difficult to see how these views can deny that (3) could be\njustified in this way. Let’s make this explicit: suppose that in\neach case (1) is indeed noninferentially justified for me on the basis\nof the corresponding seeming or reliable perceptual process, that I\nknow the obvious entailment (2) a priori, and that on the basis of\nthis I infer (3). Suppose also that we accept the following\nintuitively plausible principle of closure: if S is justified\nin believing that P, knows that P entails that Q,\nand infers on the basis of this that Q, then S is\njustified in believing that Q. (This is a principle that\nphenomenal conservatives and dogmatists themselves tend to accept. A\nfew externalists, such as Dretske (1970) and Nozick (1981) deny the\nclosure principle at work in the objection, but many externalists are\nreluctant to deny that something like it holds, for they do not want\nto deny that we could be justified in inferring (3) from (1).) It then\nfollows that I am justified in believing (3). The objector who uses\nthis against phenomenal conservatism or reliabilism takes the lesson\nhere to be that mere seemings or reliable processes (respectively)\ncannot be a source of foundational or noninferential justification.\nJustification can’t be that easy.  \nThe problem of easy knowledge (or easy justification) comes in a\nsecond form as well: phenomenal conservatism and reliabilism allow one\nto acquire justification in the reliability of one’s perceptual\nappearances in a way that appears to be illegitimate: by relying on\nthose very appearances themselves. If phenomenal conservatism is true,\nthen I can arrive at knowledge or at least justified belief in the\nreliability of my apparent perceptions in the following way: \nTherefore (probably), my perceptual seemings are true.  \nGiven some plausible principle of justification by induction, I can\ninfer from the premises that my perceptual seemings are (probably)\nreliable. The problem is that it is intuitively implausible that I\ncould come to acquire justification for the reliability of my seemings\nby relying on the very seemings whose reliability one is attempting to\njustify. But it’s not clear how the phenomenal conservative can\ndeny that this is a legitimate way to acquire justification in the\nreliability of one’s seemings.  \nExternalists also seem vulnerable to the second form of the problem of\neasy knowledge. They must apparently allow that a circular\ntrack-record argument could provide justification for belief in the\nreliability or trustworthiness of fundamental sources of belief. For\nexample, the reliabilist can rely on perception to justify the\nreliability of perception, memory to justify the reliability of\nmemory. And it seems implausible that one could acquire justification\nfor the reliability of such sources in this way (see Vogel 2008b for\nan argument against reliabilism along these lines). \nOne possible reply is to grant that such arguments are\nquestion-begging and epistemically useless if presented to someone who\ndoubts the reliability or trustworthiness of such seemings or apparent\nperceptions, but hold that it can still provide a subject who lacks\nthat doubt with justification. While the argument is question-begging\nagainst the skeptic, that is no reason to deny that one could, in the\nabsence of defeaters, acquire knowledge or justification on the basis\nof such arguments (Pryor 2004; Markie 2005; Bergmann 2008). However,\nsome object that such arguments remain intuitively\nproblematic—the arguments seem not to justify at all, whether or\nnot they should persuade skeptics. (Cohen 2005; see also Vogel 2008a:\n539–42, for further examples of cases for which dogmatism allows\nsubjects to have justification that they really lack).  \nOne might begin to wonder whether the problem of easy knowledge is a\nproblem for all foundationalist views if it is a problem for\nany. Indeed, some have argued that classical foundationalists are in\nno better a position than phenomenal conservatives and externalists\nwith respect to the problem, for they too will have to allow that one\ncould rely on acquaintance with facts to justify the existence and\ntrustworthiness of acquaintance. First, consider a parallel case of\ndeductive closure: \nAnd a parallel case of circularity: \nTherefore (probably), acquaintance is a source of true beliefs. \nClassical foundationalists might respond that the problem is not one\nof permitting some source to justify propositions about itself or its\nepistemic credentials. The problem is that some alleged sources make\nthe justification implausibly easy. Classical foundationalism does\nnot; the intuition that the knowledge or justification acquired is\nimplausibly easy or unsatisfying in the argument forms just presented\nis absent or at least much weaker (see Fumerton 2006). The problem\nthat classical foundationalism faces is that it makes justification\ntoo hard, not too easy.","contact.mail":"ali-hasan@uiowa.edu","contact.domain":"uiowa.edu"}]
