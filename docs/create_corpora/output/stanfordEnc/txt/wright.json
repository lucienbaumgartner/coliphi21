Sometimes cited as a founder of pragmatism, he is\nmore appropriately remembered as an original \nthinker in the tradition of David Hume and John Stuart \nMill.[1]\nWright's primary interest and originality lay in philosophy of\nscience, but his insights and influence carried over to other venues,\nincluding philosophy of education and theory of meaning. Wright\nexercised a great influence at a crucial time in American cultural\nlife — in the 1860s and 70s, when the force of religious piety\nand Transcendentalism was waning.  He was a tireless critic of\nmetaphysics and the natural theology he believed it served, but he was\nalso a discriminating interpreter of principles in science and\nphilosophy. He wrote little and his influence was exerted by means of\nconversation and philosophical discussion with the circle of\nintellectuals and academics centered in Cambridge, Mass. from\n1850–75. This circle included Charles S. Peirce, William James,\nand Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., all of whom acknowledged Wright's\ninfluence.[2]\n\n\n\nWright accepted Hume's rejection of rational a priori knowledge and,\nfollowing the positivist Auguste Comte (1789–1857), he applied\nHume's lesson to theory in science. Wright regarded theory as a\ngrammar or logical template for organizing sense experience, which was\nthe only true origin of knowledge. As such, theory was a labor-saving\ndevice and usually mathematical in character. Some theoretical\nentities were real, but it is extremely difficult to settle upon any\nas surely real, given the method of science. That method is\nverification. Wright used the term verification to mean the testing of\ntheories by deducing from them consequences that can be confirmed by\ndirect perception, the “undoubted testimony of the senses”\n(PD 47). What are verified are predicted consequences of\ntheory. This commitment to the sensory base of ideas both at the\nbeginning and end of scientific investigation reinforced Wright's\nbelief that utility is what makes both nature and human affairs\nintelligible. The principle of utility informed his understanding of\nDarwin's Origin of Species as offering not axioms for deduction\nbut descriptive principles, in particular natural selection, that\nencompassed a wide range of disparate causes of change in\norganisms. From this vantage point on science, Wright became a\npenetrating interpreter and a brilliant defender of Darwinism in its\nintroduction into the United States. In what follows, Wright's\nphilosophy of science will be presented, highlighting the character of\nhis empiricism as it is revealed through his understanding of\ninduction. The influence of Mill's utilitarianism will be evident in\nhis interpretation of Darwin, which is presented next. The nature of\nhis positivism and his views on cosmology and natural theology are\nfollowed by a general characterization of his scientific\nphilosophy.\n\n\n\nChauncey Wright was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1830, where\nhis family had lived since colonial times and where his father had\nbeen a merchant and deputy-sheriff of the county. In 1848, he entered\nHarvard College. His education there included two years of advanced\nstudy in natural sciences. Graduating in 1852, he took employment with\nthe Nautical Almanac office in Cambridge as a computer.  This work\nconstituted his livelihood throughout his life. He concentrated his\nwork for each year into the last three months of the year, devoting\nthe rest of the time to his own studies in the logic of science and\nmetaphysics. \n\nThe first philosophical influence on Wright was the Scottish\nrealist, Sir William Hamilton, whose works formed the curriculum for\nFrancis Bowen's teaching of philosophy at Harvard. Wright was, however,\ngreatly influenced by John Stuart Mill's criticism of Hamilton, and the\ninfluence of Mill is evident in Wright's views on utility in science\nand ethics. The great conversion of his life came, however, with his\nreading of Darwin's Origin of Species, published in 1859.\nWright became an American defender of Darwin against his religious\nantagonists and also, like Harvard's Asa Gray, against Darwin's\nscientific critics in America. \n\nWright taught for a short time at Harvard, but was not successful as\na lecturer. He was an intellectual conversationalist and\nthrough his participation in a succession of study groups in Cambridge,\ninfluenced Charles S. Peirce, William James, and Oliver Wendell Holmes,\nJr., among others. In spite of his perspicacity and his dispassionate\nlogical approach to discussion, he also had a gentle, sometimes\nangelic, temperament. Children liked him and he was willing to spend\ntime entertaining them. He was close to Charles Eliot Norton and his\nfamily and exchanged many letters with Norton's sisters. When his\nfriends were away for extended periods, Wright's spirits and health\nsuffered. He endured two bouts of deep depression from which his\nfriends roused him. Among his friends Wright counted both William and\nHenry James. William James said of Wright, “Never in a human head\nwas contemplation more separated from desire.” Wright died of a\nstroke in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1875, at the age of \n 45.[3] \nWright's writings are contained in two volumes, Philosophical\nDiscussions, a collection of his articles published in American\nand British periodicals of the time, and Letters, collected\nshortly after his death by his friend James B.\n Thayer.[4]\n Two fundamental epistemological themes are prominent throughout his\nwork: 1) sense perception provides the only evidence whose authority\nall humankind acknowledges, and 2) sense experience alone can produce\nthe conviction and permanence that we believe knowledge should\nhave. The first point addresses the problem of the diversity of truth\nclaims, the second the expectation that genuine truth claims not be\nsuperseded. He said: \n\nConviction should be accompanied by consensus, and only sense\nperception can claim consensus among honest investigators. Wright often\nacknowledged there were legitimate sources of belief besides\nsense perception — faith or rational introspection for instance\n— but none of them were adequate as sources of\nknowledge. Wright did not analyze sense experience into sense\ndata, preferring to trust the holistic character of ordinary experience\nand most scientific observation. He introduced no theory of perception\nnor did he address the possible contamination of sense experience by\npreconceived notions. He rather placed the weight of conviction upon\nthe employment of verification, which he allied at different times with\nscientific method, the philosophical doctrine of induction, and Comte's\npositivism. He said that the ancients did not make more progress in\nscience because “they did not, or could not, verify their\ntheories” (PD 45). Furthermore, all that really\ndistinguishes metaphysics from science in the modern era is that\nmetaphysics lacks method and “well-grounded canons of research\nand criticism” (PD 366). \nWright, then, regarded the nature of verification as evident and\nwithout problems of interpretation. Verification was part of the\nsolution to the problems that beset theory-making and explanation,\ne.g., the competing claims about what theoretical entities exist, and\nwhat factors should militate for or against acceptance of any theory\nor cosmology. Asserting the priority of verification as the judge of\ntheory, Wright said that discussion of the origin of theories or any\nclaim for their a priori character is of no moment in\nscience, “which maintains strict neutrality toward all\nphilosophical systems” (PD 47). He said that the only\ndifference between theories and facts is that theories are more\ncomplex and less directly testable (PD 44). Unlike later\nlogical positivists, however, Wright did not hold that terms or\ndescriptions for theoretical entities were meaningless or to be\nresolved only into propositions stating their verifiable\nconsequences. The unobservables postulated by science are “for\nthe purpose of giving a material or visual basis to the phenomena and\nempirical laws of life in general” (PD 164–65),\nand some of them will be proven to exist. In this regard, he likened\nDarwin's gemmule theory to Newton's corpuscular theory of light and\nthe molecular theory of matter. In alluding to the difficulty of\nrepresenting the extremely small size of molecules as measured by\nThomson, Wright said: \n\nThe important thing about hypothesized unobservables is that they be\nrelated to actual phenomena in such a way as to have verifiable\nconsequences. \n\nEven at this, unobservables should not be specialized natures or\nforces taken to account just for certain phenomena. This was,\naccording to Wright, the problem with scholastic substantial forms\n(PD 166–67). His criticism of metaphysical concepts was\nthat they are empirically poor; they do not link different phenomena\nand do not generate predictions that can be verified at the level of\nthe tangible and visible. Unlike early modern critics of scholastic\nmetaphysical concepts, Wright did not claim that scientific concepts\nare by comparison clear and simple.  Indeed, theoretical entities in\nmodern science can be hard to represent to ourselves because of the\nlimitations of our conceptions to perceptible forms and properties\n(PD 166). Wright speculated that there were “orders of\nforces” between the physico-chemical and the vital, just as\nthere are intermediate phenomena between the vegetative functions of\nan animal and sensibility, i.e., sensation and perception. But since\nsensibility presents the elements from which conceptions of size and\nmovement must come, our conceptions of forces and hidden elements are\nlimited to the sensible (PD 167). There are thus areas of\nnature we would investigate that are largely inaccessible to us\nbecause of empirical limitations. Wright did not resort to\nreductionism to bridge this gap in our knowledge. He said, “Can\nsensibility and the movements governed by it be derived directly by\nchemical synthesis from the forces of inorganic elements? It is\nprobable, both from analogy and direct observation, that they\ncannot” (PD 167). To determine what theoretical\nentities are real is difficult but is nevertheless the task of\nscience, which always concerns itself with \nfacts.[5] \n\nGiven the realist tendency of his treatment of unobservables, indirect\nverification is an important part of Wright's conception of the\nempirical basis of all knowledge. The theory of gravity, which Wright\ntakes to be proven, “fails to become a fact in the proper\nsense” because it can never be verified by direct and immediate\nsensory activity. Its truth must be verified indirectly. He said: \n\nWright did not elaborate upon the difference between direct and indirect\nverification in actual practice. He had much more to say about differences in\nmethod between science and philosophy. He believed that all branches of\nknowledge had to follow the method of verification belonging to\nscience. The “philosophy of method” is incomplete, however,\nin that it cannot say what constitutes verification in all the\ndepartments of knowledge. Because there is no “complete inventory\nof our primary sources of knowledge,” there can be disagreement\nas to what constitutes a legitimate appeal to observation or what is a\nreal verification (PD 45). Platonists or rationalists claim\nverification for their theories because they have made an observation\nof what reason reveals to them. In fact, they have made an induction\nfrom rational introspection (PD 46). The positivists' claim,\nwhich Wright endorsed, is simply that “verification by reason\nsettles nothing” and that only data from sensible experience are\nreliable enough to admit ideas into the range of what is held to be\ntrue. \n\nWright added to this that verification means empirical judgment made\nupon deduction of consequences, not induction either from\nsense data or examination of self-consciousness (PD 47).\nNevertheless, even science that aims at a complete empiricism must\nadmit some “ideal or transcendental elements.” In every\ncase, however, these elements must yield consequences that are\ntestable, either by themselves or in conjunction with empirically\nderived notions (PD 47). For example, from Wright's\nstandpoint, the cosmological theory that the universe is developing,\nnot just changing, might be a plausible interpretation of the data\navailable to astronomers of his day. But he thought the notion of\ndevelopment relies implicitly on the idea of an end or culmination. So\nthis “development theory,” which he calls\n“transcendental,” must still submit to empirical test\n(PD 17, 118). He denied Kant's division of knowledge into\n“data of experience and conditions of\nexperience” and so did not admit the transcendental in the sense\nof the rational a priori (L 106). \nDespite Wright's distinguishing verification from induction, the\nlatter, nevertheless, played an important role in his philosophy of\nscience. Induction is relevant to his views of what makes for a\nrigorous science and what constitutes truth in science. Wright did not\nthink it informative to contrast intuition and induction, because they\ndo not refer to different ultimate grounds of belief (PD\n373).  Intuition is “rapid, instinctive judgment, whether in the\nobjective sensible perception of relatively concrete matters, or in\nthe most abstract” (PD 372). Intuition is properly\ncontrasted to inference, i.e., reasoning, whether inductive or\ndeductive. ‘Inductive,’ then, refers to the a posteriori\nsource of reasoning, i.e., from evidence. It does not refer\nto a procedure for generalizing from evidence. He said, “In\ntheir primary signification and in this connection the terms\n‘induction’ and ‘inductive’ refer directly to\nevidences, and not to any special means and processes of collating and\ninterpreting them” (PD 372). So, induction may begin\nfrom a variety of sources. What philosophers, either Platonist or\nCartesian, usually call intuition he understood to be induction from\nthe data of self-consciousness. \n\nEven induction from sense experience is not of one type. It may\nstart with evidence taken from different levels of perceptual and\nexperiential complexity and is at work at different stages of an\ninvestigation. This approach to induction is guided by the character of\nscientific knowledge itself, which Wright understood to be the relating\nof particular facts to more general ones (PD 205–206). But it\nalso follows the character of natural phenomena. In biology in\nparticular, the new science of evolution concerns the “external\neconomy of life” and thus must investigate an accumulation of\nrelated facts of observation at the level of secondary causes\n(PD 99–100). Induction may come from ordinary experience,\nexperiment, or the inspections of the field naturalist. He said,\n“Inductions are still performed for the most part unconsciously\nand unsystematically…. But when and however ideas are developed\nscience cares nothing, for it is only by subsequent tests of sensible\nexperience that ideas are admitted into the pandects of science”\n(PD 47). \n\nFor Wright, no axioms of science can be absolute. He said: \n\nIn this passage, axioms are not foundational in an\nepistemological sense. We seek simple principles of physical reality\nbut must be wary of taking them as foundations in the sense of\nultimate simple facts. The only ultimate in knowledge is recourse to\nthe empirical in verification. Though verification depends on\ndeduction, it does not depend on absolutely true starting points of\ndeduction to yield reliable knowledge. This part of Wright's view\nreflects his assimilation of the positivist understanding of science\nas a taxonomy of practical experience with nature.  \nSeveral issues were involved in the view of science as a taxonomy or\ngrammar.  The influential French positivist, Auguste Comte, along with\nscientific positivists like Mach, distrusted theoretical concepts in\nscience because they saw that these concepts rely on elements of\npractical\n experience.[6]\n A prime example was the relation of the concept of gravity to the\nexperience of weight on the surface of the earth. Comte said that\ngravitation is a “general fact” which is itself “a\nmere extension of [a fact] which is perfectly familiar to us, and\nwhich we therefore say that we know; — the weight of bodies on\nthe surface of the earth” (Comte 28–29). Positivists\nbelieved we cannot avoid the anthropomorphic origin of theoretical\nconcepts. It had, however, become clear to positivists who were\nactually engaged in the practice of science that the structure of a\nscience is what sustains prediction, not the meaning\nof the theoretical terms of the science. A system of principles\nconstitutes a logical form of explanation, and the ability of the\nsystem of principles to link disparate phenomena, more than concepts,\nis the truth in science. As a result, descriptions of the\nlogical character of a science come to the fore in discussions of\ntheory. \n\nWright's emphasis on verification, his pluralism about induction, and\nhis focus on the logical character of scientific principles together\nshow that he had absorbed important aspects of scientific\npositivism. He often highlighted scientific theory as classificatory\n(PD 363) and emphasized the relating of higher and lower\nlevels of generality as the hallmark of science. He referred to the\npositivists often and to Comte in particular. In a passage that\nparallels Auguste Comte, Wright said that every scientific distinction\nis of value in classification and “must coincide with and be of\nuse as a sign of other distinctions — that is, be a mark of the\nthings distinguished by it” (PD\n 370).[7] \n\nThis passage points to Wright as a link between Comte's positivism and\nC.S. Peirce, who believed that concepts are indexical signs. Although\nhe had no semiotic theory, Wright's view of scientific discourse as a\ndevice substituting for useless thought made him sensitive to the role\nof signs (PD 280). Wright also identified the objective value\nof science with its use. He meant by this “its relatedness or\nulterior value, whether as leading to other and wider ranges of\nknowledge, or as a discipline of the mind, or even as leading to\n‘bread and butter’” (PD 282). Peirce, as is\nwell-known, insisted that the meaning of a concept is its use\nor effect.  In contrast, Wright believed theoretical statements have\nmeaning other than their effects, but the truth of the statements is\njudged by whether predicted effects or results are\nverified.[8] \n\nHis own approach to signs is evident in his speculation, undertaken\nat the urging of Darwin, about the origin of self-consciousness. Here\nWright treated concepts as images. He traced the emergence of\nself-consciousness in terms of human awareness of different kinds of\nsigns (usually vocal, he said) that recall images in thought. The\nimages themselves act as signs when a human being reasons, but\n“with reference to the more vivid outward signs, they are, in the\nanimal mind, merged in the things signified, like stars in the light of\nthe sun” (PD 209). The conscious awareness of the\ndifference between outward and inward signs is crucial to human\nawareness, he believed. This awareness may have come with the\n“consciousness of simultaneous internal and external\nsuggestion” and the recognition of the outward sign as a\nsubstitute for the inward sign (PD 210). The key to\nrationality is the outward sign itself, i.e., elements of language,\nbeing made the object of attention (PD \n206).[9] \nIt is worth noting that, in a letter of 1869, Wright used the term\nconsilience to explain the advantages of positivism over the\n“older\n philosophy.”[10]\n Positivism, he said, is a system of “universal methods,\nhypotheses, and principles” founded on the sciences. It is not a\nuniversal science itself but must be “coextensive with actual\nknowledge, and exhibit the consilience of the sciences” (L,\n141). Consilience was a term used by William Whewell in 1858 to\ndescribe the coherence and mutual consistency of different scientific\ndisciplines as they develop. This coherence, for Whewell, was a test\nof the truth of the\n sciences.[11] \nIn summary, Wright's understanding of\nscience and its method are distinguished by (1) his refusal to theorize about sense data\nand his consequent grounding of empiricism in the type of data\navailable to everyday perceiving, (2) his nuanced treatment of\ninduction, which rejects Cartesian starting points, and (3) his\ncombination of verification with methodological realism about theoretical\nentities.  Wright was in advance of his contemporaries in his understanding\nof Darwin's change in organisms and species, in part because he\napplied the foregoing interpretation of science to Darwin's\ntheory. Wright highlighted the overall structure of the theory of\nevolution, which he believed illustrated the principle of utility. He\nalso characterized evolutionary change in terms of different levels of\ncausative and explanatory principles. Natural selection is a\ndescriptive principle that unifies these other principles in a\ncomprehensive account. It is a template, a form of explanation, by\nwhich an investigator may be guided in finding how more basic\nexplanatory principles — the principles of chemistry and the\nlaws of inheritance, for instance — issue in features of living\nthings observable by direct perception. \n\nWright said that natural selection is a manifestation of the\nall-pervasive principle of utility, which governs adaptation. Utility\nhe characterized in this way: “Let the questions of the uses of\nlife, then, be put in this shape: To what ascertainable form or phase\nof life is this or that other form or phase of life valuable or\nserviceable?” (L 274–75). Features or parts of a living\nthing are forms or phases of life that serve the organism's more\ngeneral functions and its survival. Perception of colors, for instance,\nserves to avoid the effects of dispersion of light in perception and to\nmake possible definition of objects in vision through limits in\nsensibility (L 279). Using teleological language without\nteleological intent, he said, “Colors were invented by Nature to\navoid the confusing effects of dispersion” (L 279). The\nphysical laws of optics in this case lend themselves to an adaptation\nuseful to living things. \n\nTheorists of evolution are sometimes criticized for offering\n‘just so’ stories of adaptation. How a given serviceable\nfeature might have evolved is taken as tantamount to how it actually\ndid evolve. There is, however, a valuable insight about the nature of\nevolutionary science to be gleaned from the practice of giving likely\nstories of evolution. The general form of explanation by utility is\nmore important than which particular explanation by natural selection\nis advanced to explain a feature or structure. At this very early\nstage of reception of Darwin's theory, Wright had already realized\nthis. In correspondence with Darwin, Wright said, “The inquiry\nas to which of several real uses is the one through which\nnatural selection has acted for the development of any faculty or\norgan … has for several years seemed to me a somewhat less\nimportant question than it seemed formerly and still appears to most\nthinkers on the subject” (L 335). Wright thought there\nmight be a plurality of uses for the same feature in the history of an\norganism.  Sometimes these uses are contemporaneous; at other times\nthey succeed one another in the course of evolution. Wright believed\nthat thinking in terms of natural selection would shed light on\nphysiological questions and connect chemical and physical explanations\nto the more complicated phenomena of life (PD 296). He\nrealized that natural selection promised to be a research program for\ninvestigation that would unify biological science. \n\nWright strongly criticized Herbert Spencer's philosophy of\nevolution, both because of its excessive claims for the range of\nevolution and because of Spencer's understanding of evolution as a\nforce or operative cause. There is no Law of Evolution applicable to\nnature and civilization. Spencer's examples drawn from the history of\ncivilization are not truly scientific and are “liable to the\ntaint of teleological and cosmological conception.” (PD\n73). Wright said, “To us Mr. Spencer's speculation seems but the\nabstract statement of the cosmological conceptions, and that kind of\norderliness which the human mind spontaneously supplies in the absence\nof facts sufficiently numerous and precise to justify sound scientific\nconclusions” (PD 73). In a review of a collection of\nessays by Alfred Wallace, the co-discoverer of the principle of natural\nselection, Wright said: \n\nWright held that three different “classes of causes” are\ninvolved in natural selection. The first has to do with the external\nconditions of the life of a living thing, its relation to other\norganisms and the non-organic world. Second are physical laws; he\nmentions specifically principles of mechanics, optics, and acoustics.\nThese are the best known and most basic of all the principles of\nscience. They are the principles by which means come to be fitted to\nends, the fulfilling or supplying of the needs of the organism. They\nare the laws in accordance with which an arm or wing, an eye or ear,\ncan be of use. Third are the causes introduced by Darwin, “the\nlittle known phenomena of variation, and their relations to the laws of\ninheritance” (PD 142). He said there are several\ndivisions within this third class, distinguishing in particular\ndiversities always existing in a population from abnormal or unusual\nvariations. In responding to St. George Mivart's criticism of natural\nselection, he said that diversities existing normally in a population\nare the source of evolutionary change more than “unusual and\nmonstrous variations” (PD 144). Wright made this point\nboth to highlight the level at which natural selection operates and to\ndrive home the role of natural selection as an alternative to\nteleological explanations of the usefulness of adaptations. Variations\nin inherited characteristics in individuals are not themselves the\ndirect causes of changes in species. Natural selection is a complex\ngeneral fact of which utility is the organizing principle. \n\nWright's study of Mill's utilitarianism undoubtedly influenced his\nunderstanding of Darwin. Although he rejected Spencer's application of\nthe principle of evolution to history and civilization, he thought many\naspects of human behavior and psychology could be treated by the\nprinciple of natural selection. Utilitarian ethics provided a model for\nhim. He used the way humans make moral choices as an analogy for\nunconscious selection in the change of human language over time.\nUtility is not the motive of moral decision-makers. In the moral agent\nthinking rightly according to his principle of virtue, conscience will\ndisplay the utilitarian principle. Similarly, there may be a variety of\nmotives for adoption of a change in linguistic form or behavior:\nauthority, ease of pronunciation, or distinctness from other\nutterances. The adoption of the change is what concerns natural\nselection. Natural selection shows the utility implicit unconsciously\nin selection by the agency of one of these motives (L 244). In\ncommenting on moral behavior itself, Wright in effect based ethics on\nhuman nature, because of the importance he accorded to habit in human\nbehavior: \n\nWe see in this passage the separation of immediate causes of action,\nnamely pleasure and pain, from the pattern of action serving nature's\nreal end, namely utility. Wright thought utilitarianism needed, as a\nsupplement, a developed philosophy of habit. In a way similar to his\nexplanation of natural selection, he separated (1) the conditions\nmilitating toward habit, (2) immediate motives for choosing action, and\n(3) the larger principle governing selection of\n action.[12] \n\nWright labored in his essays and review articles to make Darwin's\ntheory understandable to the educated American public by countering the\nquestions about what kind of explanation natural selection offered.\nRealizing that utility as a principle provided the logical form for\nDarwin's theory, he insisted that natural selection could not submit to\nrequirements of demonstration. It could not serve as an axiom from\nwhich deduction starts. Indeed, it should be compared to the principle\nof gravitation not as this concept figured in celestial mechanics or\neven in the laboratory but as gravitation is manifest “in the\nconcrete courses of outward nature, in meteorology and physical\ngeology.” Natural selection could be compared to the fundamental\nlaws of political economy, as these laws actually emerge in the fixing\nof value and prices through demand and supply (PD 137). Here\nwe see both the influence of utilitarianism and Wright's belief in the\ninterdependence of different levels of explanatory principles. \n\nHis understanding of induction figures also in his defense of\nDarwin. In a review essay of 1870, he commented on the almost universal\nacceptance of Darwin's theory by the scientifically minded and\nattributed its success to “the skillful combination of inductive\nand deductive proofs with hypothesis.” This combination must\nrely, however, on a preceding simpler induction, he said. The near\nsimultaneous discovery by Wallace and Darwin of the principle behind\nbiological evolution testifies to their ability as naturalists to\nappreciate “the force of obscure and previously little studied\nfacts” (PD 99). In this context, he also insisted upon\nthe importance to science of investigating principles operating at a\nlevel in nature comparable to the level of political economy. He said\nthat to fail to investigate a principle operating at the level of the\nwhole organism or at the level of populations would go against the\n“Aristotelian” tendency of mind of the scientific culture.\nThe scientific mind cannot regard the intricate system of adaptations\nin nature as arbitrary and is not satisfied “so long as any\nexplanation, not tantamount to arbitrariness itself, has any\nprobability in the order of nature” (PD 100). \n\nIn responding both to friends and enemies of Darwin's evolution,\nWright sought to keep clear the minimal meaning of natural selection in\nscientific terms. In this way, he did great service to Darwin. Like a\ngood positivist, he was protecting the new theory of evolution from\nannexation into cosmological speculation or alliance with the final\ncausality that was always a part of natural\n theology.[13] \n\nWright had interesting and original views about the origin of the\nuniverse and changes in the\n heavens.[14]\n He saw no evidence in astronomical data or known scientific law for\nascribing purpose or direction to the evolution of the cosmos as a\nwhole. He believed it most likely that the universe is eternal,\nconstituting “an order without beginning and without\ntermination” (PD 4). It is governed by the principle of\n“counter-movements,” which he believed was manifest\nalready in biological phenomena in the cycle of life and death,\nnutrition and decay. Gravitation and heat were the chief forces\ninvolved in counter-movements. Geology manifests the principle, in the\nrelation of forces producing elevations, compressions, erosion, and\ndeposits, and it is even more markedly evident in meteorological\nphenomena. Wright believed that changes in interstellar space\nconstituted, in a way similar to meteorology, “cosmical\nweather” (PD 10). He was concerned that the nebular\nhypothesis of the origin of solar systems, presented as a plausible\nscientific hypothesis by Laplace and supported by the observations of\nHerschel, was too readily taken in support of a “developmental\nhypothesis” about the universe, namely that the universe was\ncreated and had evolved toward an end congenial to supporting human\nlife. For Wright, teleological notions in science were always\nanathema. He accepted the nebular hypothesis in terms of the physical\nlaws that yielded the developmental hypothesis, both in astronomy and\nbiology. But he called it the “derivative hypothesis” to\nconnote the fact that “in several classes of phenomena hitherto\nregarded as ultimate and inexplicable, physical explanations are\nprobable and legitimate” (PD 17). He meant by this that\nscientific cosmology need entertain no extra-scientific principles as\nfundamental: “the constitution of the solar system is not\narchetypal, as the ancients supposed, but the same corrupt mixture of\nlaw and apparent accident that the phenomena of the earth's surface\nexhibit” (PD 9). \n\nWright was aware that the second law of thermodynamics militated\nagainst his cosmology of cosmic weather continuing in an endless\nsuccession of phenomena in infinite time. But he believed the\n“tendency to diffuse the mechanical energies of nature”\nthat was characteristic of the laws of heat was considered too narrowly\nby Thomson and others. There was a “round of actions” in\nthe complex interactions of heat and gravitation through space that set\nup the counter-movements of continuous change (L 177). To the\nscientific Aristotelian mind that Wright claimed to have, the theory of\n“wasting” raised more questions than it answered, and so he\ndeferred his own full acceptance of it (PD 87). Wright's\napproach to this issue illustrates his penchant, evident also in his\nacute and ready understanding of natural selection, to focus on\nlarge-scale effects of natural law as making sense of nature. In this,\nhis mind worked against the reductionist tendencies of philosophers who\nhad less experience with and sympathy for science itself. He was\ninterested in the persistent patterns evident to sense perception set\nup by the operation of natural law at levels inaccessible to\nperception. \n\nA constant theme for Wright is the rejection of\nnatural theology. He did not believe that there could be philosophical\narguments, starting from natural phenomena, whether motion or the\nintelligible forms of living things, that prove the existence of a\ndeity. He also believed it was impossible to identify in nature genuine\nfinal causes, ends present naturally that are always prior to the\nsubordinate causes that bring about those ends. He said: \n\nThat the universe has a purpose or that the forms of living things\ngiven by nature have an inevitability or natural priority to them can\nbe believed on grounds of faith but can in no way be disclosed or\nsupported by scientific investigation of nature. Perhaps judging from\nthe state of philosophy and theology in the American institutions of\nhigher learning in the mid-nineteenth century, Wright believed that\nmetaphysics had no other purpose than the service of natural theology.\nHe was never precise about what he meant by metaphysics, but he said\nthat the motives for theological and metaphysical speculation come\nfrom “the active emotional life of man” (PD\n49–50). He seemed to equate metaphysics and philosophy. He\ncontinued, “The questions of philosophy proper are human desires\nand fears and aspirations — human emotions — taking an\nintellectual form” (PD 50). A spirit of inquiry free of\nthese influences motivates science, but it is “necessarily, at\nall times, a weak feeling” and could have little effect on\ncivilization until a body of scientific learning had been\ndeveloped. He said, “And we owe science to the combined energies\nof individual men of genius, rather than to any tendency to progress\ninherent in civilization” (PD 51). Philosophy belongs\nwith the fine arts and religion. Its attainments are not great but its\nmotives are noble (PD 52). This ad hominen argument\nagainst philosophers — that their enterprise is not rational and\ndisinterested — would have found ready reinforcement in Comte's\nrejection of metaphysics in favor of scientific method. Wright never\nfollowed Comte, however, in Comte's recommendation of a religion of\nhumanity to take the place of religion for the masses. Although\nWright's own thinking is highly philosophical, the rejection of\nmetaphysics and philosophy together is fundamental for him and lies in\nthe background of all his pronouncements in philosophy of science. \n\nWright's philosophical position is a type of naturalism, though not a\nnaturalism endorsed by most twentieth century philosophers who have\nused that term. Given his view of philosophy, he resisted skepticism,\nidealism, and realism, regarding them all as defects of\nthought. Nevertheless, compared to twentieth century philosophies of\nscience, his own philosophy of science is decidedly realist. He\nbelieved scientists discover structures and features of natural\nthings, and previously unknown hidden entities, as well as phenomenal\nlaws that govern the behavior of natural things. In this respect, his\npositivism is methodological and precautionary, a preparation for\nscientific realism. In treating the origin of consciousness, he said\nthat idealism and natural realism are the two philosophical positions\nto issue from taking sense data and emotions as the primarily real. In\nidealism, the conscious subject is immediately known through his\nperceptions, i.e., the phenomena, and the existence of an external\nworld can only be an inference from the phenomena known to belong to\nthe self (PD 230). He rejected this but also rejected natural\nrealism, which holds that “both the subject and object are\nabsolutely, immediately, and equally known through their essential\nattributes in perception.” This view, he says, “is more\nthan an unlearned jury are competent to say” (PD\n231). \n\nAccording to Wright, the immediacy of sensible qualities to\nconsciousness entails that there is no way to separate subject and\nobject in consciousness. But, he continued:  In this quotation, Wright suggests that the division of subject\nfrom object may constitute “rightly dividing the world” as\nindexed by survival value. A division made in these terms, rather than\nby an individual's experiences of himself and the world, is a\nreasonable basis for natural realism. Wright's view in this passage is\nconsistent with the position of Hume that human beings by nature make\nconnections between ideas and the world and that skepticism about\nthese connections is useless and idle. In this regard, Wright's\nposition anticipates that of P.F.  Strawson, a twentieth-century\nlogical analyst. Strawson said our beliefs, e.g., in the existence of\nbodies, “are not grounded beliefs and at the same time are not\nopen to serious doubt” (Strawson 1985, 19). Wright here\narticulates a similar point couched in terms of natural selection of\nbeliefs. Also like Strawson, Wright took for some purposes ordinary\nexperience as what is primarily real, while for other purposes he took\nthe entities and properties given in physical theory as the real. This\npluralistic approach came from Wright's acceptance of different levels\nof experience as equally valid starting points for science. Also\nevident in this passage, however, is the way Wright made biological\nevolution the basis for all other accounts of nature and human\npsychology. In this respect, his approach is a forerunner of John\nDewey's philosophy of nature.","contact.mail":"degroot@cua.edu","contact.domain":"cua.edu"}]
