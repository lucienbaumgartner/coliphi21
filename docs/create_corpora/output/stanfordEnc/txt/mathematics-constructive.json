In\norder to work constructively, we need to re-interpret not only the\nexistential quantifier but all the logical connectives and quantifiers\nas instructions on how to construct a proof of the statement involving\nthese logical expressions.\n\n\n\nIn this article we introduce modern constructive mathematics based on\nthe BHK-interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers. We\ndiscuss four major varieties of constructive mathematics, with\nparticular emphasis on the two varieties associated with Errett Bishop\nand Per Martin-Löf, which can be regarded as minimal constructive\nsystems. We then outline progress in (informal) constructive reverse\nmathematics, a research programme seeking to identify principles, such\nas Brouwer’s fan theorem, that, added to the minimal constructive\nvarieties, facilitate proofs of important analytic theorems. After a brief discussion of constructive algebra, economics, and finance, the entry ends with two appendices: one on certain logical principles that hold in classical, intuitionistic, and recursive mathematics and which, added to Bishop's constructive mathematics, facilitate the proof of certain useful theorems of analysis; and one discussing approaches to a constructive development of general topology.\n\n\n\n\nBefore mathematicians assert something (other than an axiom) they are\nsupposed to have proved it true. What, then, do mathematicians mean\nwhen they assert a disjunction \\(P \\vee Q\\),\nwhere \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are syntactically correct statements\nin some (formal or informal) mathematical language? A natural —\nalthough, as we shall see, not the unique — interpretation of\nthis disjunction is that not only does (at least) one of the\nstatements \\(P, Q\\) hold, but also we can decide which\none holds. Thus just as mathematicians will assert\n\\(P\\) only when they have decided that \\(P\\) holds by\nproving it, they may assert \\(P \\vee Q\\) only when\nthey either can produce a proof of \\(P\\) or else produce one of\n\\(Q\\). \n\nWith this interpretation, however, we run into a serious\nproblem in the special case where \\(Q\\) is the negation,\n\\(\\neg P\\), of \\(P\\). To assert \\(\\neg P\\) is to\nshow that \\(P\\) implies a contradiction (such as \\(0 = 1)\\). But it will\noften be that mathematicians have neither a proof of \\(P\\) nor\none of \\(\\neg P\\). To see this, we need only reflect on the\nfollowing Goldbach conjecture (GC): \nEvery even integer \\(\\gt 2\\) can be written as a sum of two\nprimes, \n\nwhich remains neither proved nor disproved despite the best efforts\nof many of the leading mathematicians since it was first raised in a\nletter from Goldbach to Euler in 1742. We are forced to conclude that,\nunder the very natural decidability interpretation of P\n\\(\\vee Q\\), only a stubborn optimist can retain a belief in the law of\nexcluded middle (LEM):  \nFor every statement \\(P\\), either \\(P\\) or \\(\\neg P\\) holds.\n \n\nClassical logic gets round this by\nwidening the interpretation of disjunction: it interprets \\(P \\vee Q\\)\nas \\(\\neg(\\neg P\\wedge \\neg Q)\\), or in other words, “it is\ncontradictory that both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be false”. In turn, this\nleads to the idealistic interpretation of existence, in which\n\\(\\exists xP(x)\\) means \\(\\neg \\forall x\\neg P(x)\\) (“it is\ncontradictory that \\(P(x)\\) be false for every \\(x\\)”). It is on\nthese interpretations of disjunction and existence that mathematicians\nhave built the grand, and apparently impregnable, edifice of classical\nmathematics which serves a foundation for the physical, the social,\nand (increasingly) the biological sciences. However, the wider\ninterpretations come at a cost: for example, when we pass from our\ninitial, natural interpretation of \\(P \\vee Q\\) to the unrestricted\nuse of the idealistic one, \\(\\neg(\\neg P\\wedge \\neg Q)\\), the\nresulting mathematics cannot generally be interpreted within\ncomputational models such as recursive function theory. \n\nThis point is illustrated by a well-worn example, the\nproposition: \nThere exist irrational numbers \\(a, b\\) such that \\(a^b\\) is\nrational. \n\nA slick classical proof goes as follows. Either\n\\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) is rational, in which case we take \\(a = b =\n\\sqrt{2}\\); or else \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) is irrational, in which\ncase we take \\(a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{2}\\) (see\nDummett 1977 [2000], 6). But as it stands, this proof does not enable\nus to pinpoint which of the two choices of the pair \\((a,b)\\) has the\nrequired property. In order to determine the correct choice of\n\\((a,b)\\), we would need to decide whether \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\nis rational or irrational, which is precisely to employ our initial\ninterpretation of disjunction with \\(P\\) the statement\n“\\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) is rational”. \n\nHere is another illustration of the difference between\ninterpretations. Consider the following simple statement about the set\n\\(\\bR\\) of real numbers: \n\nwhere, for reasons that we divulge shortly, \\(x \\ne 0\\) means that we\ncan find a rational number \\(r\\) with \\(0 \\lt r \\lt \\abs{x}\\). A\nnatural computational interpretation of (*) is that we have a\nprocedure which, applied to any real number \\(x\\), either tells us\nthat \\(x = 0\\) or else tells us that \\(x \\ne 0\\). (For example, such a\nprocedure might output 0 if \\(x = 0\\), and 1 if \\(x \\ne 0\\).) However,\nbecause the computer can handle real numbers only by means of finite\nrational approximations, we have the problem of underflow, in\nwhich a sufficiently small positive number can be misread as 0 by the\ncomputer; so there cannot be a decision procedure that justifies the\nstatement (*). In other words, we cannot expect (*) to hold under our\nnatural computational interpretation of the quantifier \\(\\forall\\) and\nthe connective \\(\\vee\\). \n\nLet’s examine this from another angle. Let \\(G(n)\\) act as\nshorthand for the statement “\\(2n + 2\\) is a sum of two\nprimes”, where \\(n\\) ranges over the positive integers, and\ndefine an infinite binary sequence \\(\\ba = (a_1 ,a_2,\\ldots)\\)\nas follows: \n\nThere is no question that \\(\\ba\\) is a computationally\nwell-defined sequence, in the sense that we have an algorithm for\ncomputing \\(a_n\\) for each \\(n\\): check the even numbers\n\\(4,6,8,\\ldots ,2n+2\\) to determine whether each of them is a sum of\ntwo primes; in that case, set \\(a_n = 0\\), and in the contrary case,\nset \\(a_n = 1\\). Now consider the real number whose \\(n\\)th\nbinary digit is \\(a_n\\): \n\nIf (*) holds under our computational interpretation, then we can\ndecide between the following two alternatives: \n\nIn the latter case, by testing \\(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_N\\), we can find \\(n\n\\le N\\) such that \\(a_n = 1\\). Thus the computational interpretation\nof (*) enables us to decide whether there exists \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n\n= 1\\); in other words, it enables us to decide the status of the\nGoldbach Conjecture. An example of this type, showing that a\nconstructive proof of some classical result \\(P\\) would enable us to\nsolve the Goldbach conjecture (and, by similar arguments, many other\nhitherto open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis), is called\na Brouwerian example for, or even a Brouwerian\ncounterexample to, the statement \\(P\\) (though it is not a\ncounterexample in the normal sense of that word). The use of the Goldbach Conjecture here is purely dramatic. For, the argument of the preceding paragraph can be modified to show\nthat, under our computational interpretation, (*) implies\nthe limited principle of omniscience (LPO): \nFor each binary sequence \\((a_1 ,a_2, \\ldots)\\) either \\(a_n = 0\\) for\nall \\(n\\) or else there exists \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n = 1\\),\n \n\nwhich is generally regarded as an essentially nonconstructive\nprinciple for several reasons. First, its recursive\ninterpretation, \nThere is a recursive algorithm which, applied to any recursively\ndefined binary sequence \\((a_1 ,a_2, \\ldots)\\), outputs 0 if \\(a_n =\n0\\) for all \\(n\\), and outputs 1 if \\(a_n = 1\\) for some \\(n\\), \n\nis provably false within recursive function theory, even with\nclassical logic (see Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 3); so if we\nwant to allow a recursive interpretation of all our mathematics, then\nwe cannot use LPO. Secondly, there is a model theory (Kripke models)\nin which it can be shown that LPO is not constructively derivable\n(Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 7). \n\nIt should, by now, be clear that a full-blooded computational\ndevelopment of mathematics disallows the idealistic interpretations of\ndisjunction and existence upon which most classical mathematics\ndepends. In order to work constructively, we need to return\nfrom the classical interpretations to the natural constructive\nones: \n\nThese BHK-interpretations (the name reflects their origin in\nthe work of Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov) can be made more precise\nusing Kleene’s notion of realizability; see (Dummett\n[1977/2000], 222–234; Beeson [1985], Chapter VII). \n\nWhat sort of things are we looking for if we are serious about\ndeveloping mathematics in such a way that when a theorem asserts the\nexistence of an object \\(x\\) with a property \\(P\\), then the proof of\nthe theorem embodies algorithms for constructing \\(x\\) and for\ndemonstrating, by whatever calculations are necessary, that \\(x\\) has\nthe property \\(P\\). Here are some examples of theorems, each followed\nby an informal description of the requirements for its constructive\nproof. Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a given\nreal number \\(x\\), decides whether \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x \\ne 0\\). Note\nthat, in order to make this decision, the algorithm might use not only\nthe data describing \\(x\\) but also the data showing that \\(x\\) is\nactually a real number. \nProof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a set\n\\(S\\) of real numbers, a member \\(s\\) of \\(S\\), and an\nupper bound for \\(S\\), \nProof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the\nfunction \\(f\\), a modulus of continuity for \\(f\\), and the values\n\\(f(0)\\) and \\(f(1)\\),  \nProof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the\nfunction \\(f\\), a modulus of continuity for \\(f\\), the values\n\\(f(0)\\) and \\(f(1)\\), and a positive number \\(\\varepsilon\\),  \n\nWe already have reasons for doubting that (A) has a constructive\nproof. If the proof requirements for (B) can be fulfilled, then, given\nany mathematical statement \\(P\\), we can apply our proof of (B)\nto compute a rational approximation \\(z\\) to the supremum \\(\\sigma\\)\nof the set \nwith error \\(\\lt \\bfrac{1}{4}\\). We can then determine whether \\(z \\gt\n\\bfrac{1}{4}\\), in which case \\(\\sigma \\gt 0\\), or \\(z \\lt\n\\bfrac{3}{4}\\), when \\(\\sigma \\lt 1\\). In the first case, there exists\n\\(x \\in S\\) with \\(x \\gt 0\\), so we must have \\(x = 1\\) and therefore\n\\(P\\). In the case \\(\\sigma \\lt 1\\), we have \\(\\neg P\\). Thus (B)\nimplies the law of excluded middle. \nHowever, in Bishop’s constructive theory of the real numbers, based on\nCauchy sequences with a preassigned convergence rate, we can prove the\nfollowing constructive least-upper-bound principle: \n\nIn passing, we mention an alternative development of the constructive\ntheory of \\(\\bR\\) based on interval arithmetic; see Chapter\n2 of Bridges & Vîță [2006]. \n\nEach of statements (C) and (D), which are classically equivalent, is\na version of the Intermediate Value Theorem. In these statements, a\nmodulus of continuity for \\(f\\) is a set \\(\\Omega\\) of ordered\npairs \\((\\varepsilon ,\\delta)\\) of positive real numbers with the following\ntwo properties: \n\nStatement (C) entails another essentially nonconstructive principle, the lesser limited principle of\nomniscience (LLPO): \nFor each binary sequence \\((a_1,a_2,\\ldots)\\) with at most one term\nequal to 1, either \\(a_n = 0\\) for all even \\(n\\) or else \\(a_n = 0\\)\nfor all odd \\(n\\). \n\nStatement (D), a weak form of (C), can be proved constructively,\nusing an interval-halving argument of a standard type. The following\nstronger constructive intermediate value theorem, which suffices for\nmost practical purposes, is proved using an approximate-interval-halving argument: \nLet \\(f\\) be a continuous real-valued mapping on the closed interval\n\\([0,1]\\) such that \\(f(0)\\cdot f(1) \\lt 0\\). Suppose\nalso that \\(f\\) is locally nonzero, in the sense that for\neach \\(x \\in [0,1]\\) and each \\(r \\gt 0\\), there exists \\(y\\) such\nthat \\(\\abs{x - y} \\lt r\\) and \\(f(y) \\ne 0\\). Then there exists \\(x\\)\nsuch that \\(0 \\lt x \\lt 1\\) and \\(f(x) = 0\\). \n\nThe situation of the intermediate value theorem is typical of many\nin constructive analysis, where we find one classical theorem with\nseveral constructive versions, some or all of which may be equivalent\nunder classical logic. \n\nThere is one omniscience principle whose constructive status is less\nclear than that of LPO and LLPO—namely, Markov’s\nprinciple (MP): \nFor each binary sequence \\((a_n)\\), if it is contradictory that all\nthe terms \\(a_n\\) equal 0, then there exists a term equal to\n1. \n\nThis principle is equivalent to a number of simple classical\npropositions, including the following: \n\nMarkov’s principle represents an unbounded search: if you have a\nproof that all terms \\(a_n\\) being 0 leads to a contradiction, then,\nby testing the terms \\(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots\\) in turn, you are\nguaranteed to come across a term equal to 1; but this\nguarantee does not extend to an assurance that you will find the\ndesired term before the end of the universe. Most practitioners of\nconstructive mathematics view Markov’s principle with at least\nsuspicion, if not downright disbelief. Such views are reinforced by\nthe observation that there is a Kripke Model showing that MP is not\nconstructively derivable (Bridges & Richman [1987],\n137–138.) \n\nThe desire to retain the possibility of a computational\ninterpretation is one motivation for using the constructive\nreinterpretations of the logical connectives and quantifiers that we\ngave above; but it is not exactly the motivation of the pioneers of\nconstructivism in mathematics. In this section we look at some of the\ndifferent approaches to constructivism in mathematics over the past 130\nyears. \n\nIn the late nineteenth century, certain individuals—most\nnotably Kronecker and Poincaré—had expressed doubts about, or even disapproval of, the idealistic, nonconstructive methods used by\nsome of their contemporaries; but it is in the polemical writings of\n L.E.J. Brouwer\n (1881–1966), beginning with his\nAmsterdam doctoral thesis, Brouwer [1907], and continuing over the next\nforty-seven years, that the foundations of a precise, systematic\napproach to constructive mathematics were laid. In Brouwer’s\nphilosophy, known as intuitionism, mathematics is a free\ncreation of the human mind, and an object exists if and only if it can\nbe (mentally) constructed. If one takes that philosophical stance, then\none is inexorably drawn to the foregoing constructive interpretation of\nthe logical connectives and quantifiers: for how could a proof of the\nimpossibility of the non-existence of a certain object \\(x\\)\ndescribe a mental construction of \\(x\\)? \n\nBrouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, as is shown by\nthe following quotation: \n\nA modern version of Brouwer’s view was given by Errett Bishop (Bishop\n[1967], p. 2):  \n\nHowever obscure Brouwer’s writings could be, one thing was always\nclear: for him, mathematics took precedence over logic. One might say,\nas Hermann Weyl did in the following passage, that Brouwer saw\nclassical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical logic\nwithout reference to the underlying mathematics:  \n\nIn particular, this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence\nproofs which, in Weyl’s words, “inform the world that a\ntreasure exists without disclosing its location”.  \n\nIn order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist\nmathematician, it was necessary first to analyse the mathematical\nprocesses of the mind, from which analysis the logic could be\nextracted. In 1930, Brouwer’s most famous pupil, Arend Heyting,\npublished a set of formal axioms which so clearly characterise the\nlogic used by the intuitionist that they have become universally known\nas the axioms for\n intuitionistic logic\n (Heyting [1930]). These axioms captured the informal\nBHK-interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that\nwe gave earlier. \n\nIntuitionistic mathematics diverges from other types of constructive\nmathematics in its interpretation of the term “sequence”.\nNormally, a sequence in constructive mathematics is given by a rule\nwhich determines, in advance, how to construct each of its terms; such\na sequence may be said to be lawlike or\npredeterminate. Brouwer generalised this notion of a sequence\nto include the possibility of constructing the terms one-by-one, the\nchoice of each term being made freely, or subject only to certain\nrestrictions stipulated in advance. Most manipulations of sequences do\nnot require that they be predeterminate, and can be performed on these\nmore general free choice sequences. \n\nThus, for the intuitionist, a real number \\(\\bx = (x_1\n,x_2,\\ldots)\\)—essentially, a Cauchy sequence of rational\nnumbers—need not be given by a rule: its terms \\(x_1\n,x_2,\\ldots\\), are simply rational numbers, successively constructed,\nsubject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following\none used by Bishop [1967]: \n\nOnce free choice sequences are admitted into mathematics,\nso, perhaps to one’s initial surprise, are certain strong choice\nprinciples. Let \\(P\\) be a subset of \\(\\bN^{\\bN} \\times \\bN\\) (where\n\\(\\bN\\) denotes the set of natural numbers and, for sets \\(A\\) and\n\\(B, B^A\\) denotes the set of mappings from \\(A\\) into \\(B)\\), and\nsuppose that for each \\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\) there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\)\nsuch that \\((\\ba,n) \\in P\\). From a constructive point of view, this\nmeans that we have a procedure, applicable to sequences, that computes\n\\(n\\) for any given \\(\\ba\\). According to Brouwer, the construction of\nan element of \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) is forever incomplete: a generic sequence\n\\(\\ba\\) is purely extensional, in the sense that at any given\nmoment we can know nothing about \\(\\ba\\) other than a finite set of\nits terms. It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate,\nfrom some finite initial sequence \\((a_0 ,\\ldots ,a_N)\\) of terms of\n\\(\\ba\\), a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\(P(\\ba,n)\\). If \\(\\bb \\in\n\\bN^{\\bN}\\) is any sequence such that \\(b_{k} = a_{k}\\) for \\(0 \\le k\n\\le N\\), then our procedure must return the same \\(n\\) for \\(\\bb\\) as\nit does for \\(\\ba\\). This means that \\(n\\) is a continuous function of\n\\(\\ba\\) with respect to the topology on \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) given by the\nmetric  \n\nWe are therefore led to the following principle of continuous\nchoice, which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part.  CC1 : Any function from \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) to\n\\(\\bN\\) is continuous.  \n CC2 : If \\(P \\subseteq \\bN^{\\bN} \\times \\bN\\), and for each\n\\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\) there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\) such that \\((\\ba,n) \\in\nP\\), then there is a function \\(f : \\bN^{\\bN} \\rightarrow \\bN\\) such\nthat \\((\\ba,f(\\ba)) \\in P\\) for all \\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\). \n\nIf \\(P\\) and \\(f\\) are as in CC2, then we say that \\(f\\) is a\nchoice function for \\(P\\). \n\nThe omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under\nthe hypotheses CC1–2; but MP is consistent with it. Among the\nremarkable consequences of CC1–2 are the following. \n \nexists. Then there exists \\(c \\gt 0\\) such that \\(\\lVert u_n (x)\\rVert\n\\le c\\) for all \\(n\\in \\bN\\) and all unit vectors \\(x\\) of \\(X\\)\n(Uniform boundedness principle). \n\nEach of these statements appears to contradict known classical\ntheorems. However, the comparison with classical mathematics should\nnot be made superficially: in order to understand that there is no\nreal contradiction here, we must appreciate that the meaning of such\nterms as “function” and even “real number” in\nintuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the\nclassical setting. (In practice, intuitionistic mathematics cannot be\ncompared, readily and directly, with classical mathematics.)\n\n \n\nBrouwer’s introspection over the nature of functions and the\ncontinuum led him to a second principle, which, unlike that of\ncontinuous choice, is classically valid. This principle requires a\nlittle more background for its explanation. \n\nFor any set \\(S\\) we denote by \\(S^*\\) the set of all finite sequences\nof elements of \\(S\\), including the empty sequence \\((\\ )\\). If\n\\(\\alpha = (a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) is in \\(S^*\\), then \\(n\\) is called\nthe length of \\(\\alpha\\) and is denoted by\n\\(\\abs{\\alpha}\\). If \\(m \\in \\bN\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) is a finite or\ninfinite sequence in \\(S\\) of length at least \\(m\\), then we denote by\n\\(\\bar{\\alpha}(m)\\) the finite sequence consisting of the first \\(m\\)\nterms of \\(\\alpha\\).  Note that \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(0) = (\\ )\\) and \\(\\abs{\\bar{\\alpha}(0)}\\) = 0 . If\n\\(\\alpha \\in S^*\\) and \\(\\beta = \\bar{\\alpha}(m)\\) for some \\(m\\), we\nsay that \\(\\alpha\\) is an extension of \\(\\beta\\), and that\n\\(\\beta\\) is a restriction of \\(\\alpha\\). \n\nA subset \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(S\\) is said to be detachable\n(from \\(S)\\) if \nA detachable subset \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(\\bN^*\\) is called a fan\nif\n \n\nis finite or empty, where \\(\\alpha^* n\\) denotes the\nfinite sequence obtained by adjoining the natural number \\(n\\) to\nthe terms of \\(\\alpha\\). \n\nA path in a fan \\(\\sigma\\) is a sequence \\(\\alpha\\), finite\nor infinite, such that \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(n) \\in \\sigma\\) for each\napplicable \\(n\\). We say that a path \\(\\alpha\\) is blocked by\na subset \\(B\\) if some restriction of \\(\\alpha\\) is in \\(B\\); if no\nrestriction of \\(\\alpha\\) is in \\(B\\), we say that \\(\\alpha\\)\n misses \\(B\\). A subset \\(B\\) of a fan\n\\(\\sigma\\) is called a bar for \\(\\sigma\\) if each infinite path of\n\\(\\sigma\\) is blocked by \\(B\\); a bar \\(B\\) for \\(\\sigma\\) is\nuniform if there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\)\nsuch that each path of length \\(n\\) is blocked by \\(B\\). \n\nAt last we can state Brouwer’s next principle of\nintuitionism, the fan theorem for detachable\nbars (FT\\(_D\\)): \n Every detachable bar of a fan is uniform. \n\nIn its classical contrapositive form, FT\\(_D\\) is known as\nKönig’s Lemma: if for every \\(n\\) there exists a\npath of length \\(n\\) that misses \\(B\\), then there exists an\ninfinite path that misses \\(B\\) (see Dummett 1977 [2000],\n49–53). (Of course, classically the condition of detachability\nis superfluous.) It is simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample\nto König’s Lemma. \nBrouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of\ndetachability of the bar. Attempts to prove that more general fan\ntheorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a\nsubset is a bar, and led Brouwer to a notion of bar\ninduction; this is discussed in Section 3.6 of the entry\n on intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics;\n another good reference for bar induction is van Atten (2004).\n We shall return to fan theorems in Section 4.\n \n\nOf the many applications of Brouwer’s principles, the most famous is\nhis uniform continuity theorem (which follows from the\npointwise continuity consequences of CC1-2 together a form of fan\ntheorem more general than FT\\(_D)\\): \n\nThe reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within\nBrouwer’s intuitionistic framework, and not to jump to the erroneous\nconclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical mathematics. It is\nmore sensible to regard the two types of mathematics as incomparable.\nFor further discussion, see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic. \n\nUnfortunately — and perhaps inevitably, in the face of\nopposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert —\nBrouwer’s intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy became more\nand more involved in what, at least to classical mathematicians,\nappeared to be quasi-mystical speculation about the nature of\nconstructive thought, to the detriment of the practice of constructive\nmathematics itself. This unfortunate polarisation between the\nBrouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious\nGrundlagenstreit of the 1920s, details of which can be found in the\nBrouwer biographies by van Dalen [1999, 2005] and van Stigt [1990]. \n\nIn the late 1940s, the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov began the\ndevelopment of an alternative form of constructive mathematics (RUSS),\nwhich is, essentially,\n recursive function \ntheory with intuitionistic\nlogic (Markov [1954], Kushner [1985]). In this variety the objects are\ndefined by means of Gödel-numberings, and the procedures are all\nrecursive; the main distinction between RUSS and the classical\nrecursive analysis developed after the work of Turing,\nChurch, and others in 1936 clarified the nature of computable processes is\nthat the logic used in RUSS is intuitionistic. \n\nOne obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips\nwith RUSS is that, being expressed in the language of recursion\ntheory, it is not easily readable; indeed, on opening a page of\nKushner’s excellent lectures [1985], one might be forgiven for\nwondering whether this is analysis or logic. (This remark should be\ntempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on\nclassical recursive analysis by Aberth [1980, 2001].) Fortunately, one\ncan get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman\n[1983] (see also Chapter 3 of Bridges & Richman [1987]). \n\nFirst, we define a set \\(S\\) to be countable if there\nis a mapping from a detachable subset of \\(\\bN\\) onto\n\\(S\\). With intuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every\nsubset of \\(\\bN\\) is detachable (the reader is invited to provide a\nBrouwerian example to demonstrate this). Countable subsets of \\(\\bN\\)\nin Richman’s axiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively\nenumerable sets in the normal development of RUSS. \n\nBy a partial function on \\(\\bN\\) we\nmean a mapping whose domain is a subset of \\(\\bN\\); if the\ndomain is \\(\\bN\\) itself, then we call the function a\ntotal partial function on \\(\\bN\\). Richman’s\napproach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and a single axiom\nof computable partial functions (CPF): \nThere is an enumeration \\(\\phi_0 ,\\phi_1,\\ldots\\) of the set of all\npartial functions from \\(\\bN\\) to \\(\\bN\\) with countable\ndomains. \n\nIt is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this\nprinciple. For example, we can prove the following result, which almost\nimmediately shows that LLPO, and hence LPO, are false in the recursive\nsetting.  \n\nOf more interest, however, are results such as the following within\nRUSS.  \n\nFrom a classical viewpoint, these results fit into place when one\nrealises that words such as “function” and “real\nnumber” should be interpreted as “recursive\nfunction” and “recursive real number”\nrespectively. Note that the second of the above four recursive\ntheorems is a strong recursive counterexample to the open-cover\ncompactness property of the (recursive) real line; and the fourth is a\nrecursive counterexample to the classical theorem that every uniformly\ncontinuous mapping of a compact set into\n\\(\\bR\\) attains its infimum. \n\nProgress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively\nslow throughout the next decade and a half. What was needed to raise\nthe profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top-ranking\nclassical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive\ndevelopment of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to\nBrouwer’s non-classical principles or to the machinery of recursive\nfunction theory. This need was fulfilled in 1967, with the appearance\nof Errett Bishop’s monograph Foundations of Constructive\nAnalysis [1967], the product of an astonishing couple of years in\nwhich, working in the informal but rigorous style used by normal\nanalysts, Bishop provided a constructive development of a large part of\ntwentieth-century analysis, including the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem,\nthe Hahn-Banach and separation theorems, the spectral theorem for\nself-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, the Lebesgue convergence\ntheorems for abstract integrals, Haar measure and the abstract Fourier\ntransform, ergodic theorems, and the elements of Banach algebra theory.\n(See also Bishop & Bridges [1985].) Thus, at a stroke, he gave the\nlie to the commonly-held view expressed so forcefully by Hilbert:  \n\nNot only did Bishop’s mathematics BISH have the advantage\nof readability — if you open Bishop’s book at any page,\nwhat you see is clearly recognisable as analysis, even if, from time\nto time, his moves in the course of a proof may appear strange to one\nschooled in the use of the law of excluded middle — but, unlike\nintuitionistic or recursive mathematics, it admits many different\ninterpretations. Intuitionistic mathematics, recursive constructive\nmathematics, and even classical mathematics all provide models of\nBISH. In fact, the results and proofs in BISH can be interpreted, with\nat most minor amendments, in any reasonable model of computable\nmathematics, such as, for example, Weihrauch’s Type Two\nEffectivity Theory (Weihrauch [2000]; Bauer [2005]).  \n\nHow is this multiple interpretability achieved? At least in part by\nBishop’s refusal to pin down his primitive notion of\n“algorithm” or, in his words, “finite routine”.\nThis refusal has led to the criticism that his approach lacks the\nprecision that a logician would normally expect of a foundational\nsystem. However, this criticism can be overcome by looking more closely\nat what practitioners of BISH actually do when they prove theorems: in practice,\nthey are doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic.\nExperience shows that the restriction to intuitionistic logic always\nforces mathematicians to work in a manner that, at least informally,\ncan be described as algorithmic; so algorithmic mathematics appears\nto be equivalent to mathematics that uses only intuitionistic\nlogic. If that is the case, then we can practice constructive\nmathematics using intuitionistic logic on any reasonably defined\nmathematical objects, not just some class of “constructive\nobjects”. \n\nThis view, more or less, appears to have first been put forward by\nRichman [1990, 1996]. Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of\nconstructive mathematics, it does not reflect the primacy of\nmathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer, Heyting,\nMarkov, Bishop, and other pioneers of constructivism. On the other\nhand, it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in\npractice. \n\nThus one might distinguish between the ontological\nconstructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive\nmathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental\ncreations, and the epistemological constructivism of Richman\nand those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its\nmethodology, based on the use of intuitionistic logic. Of course, the\nformer approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter; and\nthe latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian\nontology. \nTo do actual mathematics we need more than just\nintutionistic logic. For Bishop, the building blocks of mathematics\nwere the positive integers (see the quote from Bishop [1967] in Section\n3.1 above). Among the early formal systems for BISH\nwere Myhill’s [1975] axiomatic foundation based on\nprimitive notions of number, set, and function; Feferman’s\n[1975] system for explicit mathematics; and Friedman’s\n[1977] intuitionistic ZF set theory. The two most favoured formal underpinnings of BISH at this stage\nare the CZF set theory\nof Aczel and Rathjen [2000], and the\n intuitionistic type theory of Martin-Löf [1975, 1984]. \n\nBefore ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive\nmathematics, we visit a fourth variety, based on Per Martin-Löf’s\nintuitionistic type theory (ML). \nMartin-Löf published his Notes on\nConstructive Mathematics [1968], based on lectures he had given in\nEurope in 1966–68; so his involvement with constructivism in\nmathematics goes back at least to the period of Bishop’s writing\nof Foundations of Constructive Analysis. Martin-Löf’s\nbook is in the spirit of RUSS, rather than BISH; indeed, its author\ndid not have access to Bishop’s book until his own manuscript was\nfinished. Martin-Löf later turned his attention to his theory of\ntypes as a foundation for Bishop-style constructive mathematics.  \n\nHere, in his own words, is an informal explanation of the ideas\nunderlying ML: \n\nIn particular, in this system every proposition can be represented as a\ntype: namely, the type of proofs of the proposition. Conversely, each\ntype determines a proposition: namely, the proposition that the type in\nquestion is inhabited. So when we think of a certain type \\(T\\) as a\nproposition, we interpret the formula  \n\nas “\\(x\\) is a proof of the proposition \\(T\\)”.  \n\nMartin-Löf goes on to construct new types, such as Cartesian\nproducts and disjoint unions, from old. For example, the Cartesian\nproduct \n\nis the type of functions that take an arbitrary object \\(x\\) of type \\(A\\)\ninto an object of type \\(B(x)\\). In the\npropositions-as-proofs interpretation, where \\(B(x)\\)\nrepresents a proposition, the above Cartesian product corresponds to\nthe universal proposition \n\nMartin-Löf distinguishes carefully between proofs and derivations: a\nproof object is a witness to the fact that some proposition\nhas been proved; whereas a derivation is the record of the\nconstruction of a proof object. Also, he exercises two\nbasic forms (one dare not say “types” here) of\njudgement. The first is a relation between proof objects and\npropositions, the second a property of some propositions. In the first\ncase, the judgement is either one that a proof object \\(a\\) is a\nwitness to a proposition \\(A\\), or else one that two proof objects\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are equal and both witness that \\(A\\)\nhas been proved. The first case of the second form of judgement states\nthat a proposition \\(A\\) is well-formed, and the second records\nthat two propositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal.  There is a careful, and highly detailed, set of rules for\nformalising ML. We will not go into those here, but refer the reader\nto other sources such as Sambin &\nSmith [1998]. \nWhen actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory, one often\nneeds to equip completely presented sets (types) with an equivalence\nrelation, the combination being known as a setoid. Mappings\nare then functions that respect those equivalence relations. This is in\nclose agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory of\nsets. The dependent types of Martin-Löf are useful for\nconstructing subsets. For instance, the real numbers can be\nconstructed using the \\(\\Sigma\\)-type (see Martin-Löf [1984]): An element of this type \\(B\\) is thereby a pair consisting of a\nconvergent sequence \\(\\bx\\) of rationals and a proof \\(p\\) that\nit is convergent. A suitable equivalence relation \\({\\sim}\\) on \\(R\\)\nis defined by taking \\((x,p)\\sim(y,q)\\) to mean The resulting setoid of real numbers is \\(\\bR =\n(R,{\\sim})\\). We can readily prove that and then, using the type-theoretic axiom of choice (see Section 4\nbelow), find a function \\(f : \\bR\\rightarrow \\bZ\\) such that \\(f(x)\n\\lt x \\lt f(x)+2\\). However, there is no reason to believe that the\nfunction \\(f\\) respects the equivalence relations—that is, that\n\\(f(x) = f(y)\\) holds if \\(x \\sim y\\).  Every constructive proof embodies an algorithm that, in principle,\ncan be extracted and recast as a computer program; moreover, the\nconstructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is\ncorrect — that is, meets its specification. One major advantage\nof Martin-Löf’s formal approach to constructive mathematics is\nthat it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs.\nThis has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive\nmathematics in various locations (see Martin-Löf [1980], Constable\n[1986], Hayashi & Nakano [1988], Schwichtenberg [2009]). Some recent implementations of\ntype theory for proof extraction are Coq and Agda (see the links in\nOther Internet Resources). \nThe full axiom of choice can be stated as follows: If \\(A,B\\) are inhabited sets, and \\(S\\) a subset of \\(A \\times B\\)\nsuch that \n\nthen there exists a choice function \\(f : A \\rightarrow B\\) such that  \n\nNow, if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation, then for\na given \\(x \\in A\\), the value \\(f(x)\\) of\nthe choice function will depend not only on \\(x\\) but also on\nthe data proving that \\(x\\) belongs to \\(A.\\) In\ngeneral, we cannot expect to produce a choice function of this\nsort. However, the BHK interpretation of the hypotheses in the axiom\nis that there is an algorithm\n \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\n which, applied to any given\n\\(x \\in A\\), produces an element\n\\(y \\in B\\) such that \\((x,y)\n\\in S\\). If \\(A\\) is a completely presented set, one\nfor which no work beyond the construction of each element in the set\nis required to prove that the element does indeed belong\nto \\(A\\), then we might reasonably expect the algorithm\n \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) to be a choice function. In\n Martin-Löf’s type theory, every set is completely\n presented and, in keeping with the BHK interpretation, the axiom\n of choice is derivable. On the other hand, in Bishop-style mathematics, completely\npresented–––or, in his terminology,\nbasic–––sets are rare, one example being\n\\(\\bN\\); so we might expect that the axiom of choice would\nnot be derivable. In fact, as was shown by Diaconescu [1975] and\nGoodman & Myhill [1978], and prefigured by Bishop himself in\nProblem 2 on page 58 of Bishop 1967, the axiom of choice implies the\nlaw of excluded middle. Clearly, the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem\napplies only under the assumption that not every set is completely\npresented. Constructive mathematicians not working in ML typically reject the\nfull axiom of choice but embrace the axiom of countable choice, in\nwhich the domain of choice is \\(\\bN\\), and dependent\nchoice. But some prefer to work without even countable choice, on the\ngrounds that to speak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule\npresents a difficulty that is just as great whether or not the\ninfinity is denumerable. Interestingly, Lebesgue made precisely this\npoint in a letter to Borel (see Moore [2013], page 316):  \nThe effect of abandoning even countable choice is the exclusion of\nmany theorems that, as they stand, are proved using sequential,\nchoice-based arguments. But those who advocate avoiding choice would\nargue that avoiding choice forces you to formulate things better. \nA particular case of interest is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:\nevery complex polynomial has at least one root in the complex\nplane. Richman [2000] has shown that without countable choice, although we\ncan construct only isolated (possibly multiple) roots, we\ncan construct arbitrarily close approximations to the multiset of\nroots. Such an approach focusses on finding an approximate linear\nfactorization of the polynomial, rather than on finding separate\napproximations to each of its roots. \nFor further analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type theory see\nMartin-Löf [2006], and the SEP entries on \n category theory,\ntype theory, and \nintuitionistic type theory. \nIn the 1970s, Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of\nreverse mathematics, aiming to classify mathematical theorems\naccording to their equivalence to one of a small number of\nset-theoretic principles (Friedman 1975). This classification reveals\ninteresting, sometimes remarkable, differences in proof-theoretic\ncomplexity. For example, although the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem is\nused in the standard proof of Peano’s existence theorem for solutions\nof ordinary differential equations (Hurewicz [1958], page 10), a\nreverse-mathematical analysis shows that the former is equivalent to a\nstrictly stronger set-theoretic principle than the one equivalent to\nPeano’s theorem (Simpson [1984], Theorems 3.9 and 4.2). The standard\ntreatise on classical reverse mathematics is (Simpson [1999/2009]).\n \nAround the turn of this century, Veldman (see Other Internet Resources), in the\nNetherlands, and Ishihara [2005, 2006], in Japan,\nindependently initiated a programme of constructive reverse\nmathematics (CRM), based on intuitionistic, rather than\nclassical, logic. (Note, though, that the first published work in the\nmodern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [1984], which\nwas twenty years ahead of its time.) In this section of the article,\nwe describe a less formal approach to CRM, in the style and framework\nof BISH. The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in\nthe three standard models—CLASS, INT, and RUSS—according\nto which principles we must, and need only, add to BISH in order to\nprove them.\n \nWe stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal\nCRM, in which we take for granted the principles\nof function- and set-construction described in the first chapters\nof Bishop [1967] or Bishop & Bridges [1985], and we work in the informal,\nthough rigorous, style of the practising analyst, algebraist,\ntopologist, … .\n \nIn practice, CRM splits naturally into two parts. In the first of\nthese, we consider a theorem \\(T\\) of INT or RUSS, and try to\nfind some principle, valid in that model and other than \\(T\\)\nitself, whose addition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a\nconstructive proof of \\(T\\). In the second part of CRM we deal\nwith a theorem \\(T\\) of CLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive,\nand we try to prove that \\(T\\) is equivalent, over BISH, to one\nof a number of known essentially-nonconstructive principles, such as\nMP, LLPO, LPO, or LEM. For an example of this part of CRM, we mention\nour earlier proof that the classical least-upper-bound principle\nimplies, and hence is equivalent to, LEM.\n \nIncidentally, there is a strong argument for Brouwer [1921] being the first\nto deal with reverse-mathematical ideas: his Brouwerian\ncounterexamples (see the one using the Goldbach conjecture, in Section\n1 above) lie squarely in the second\npart of CRM. Even if Brouwer did not state those examples as logical\nequivalences, but as implications of the type \n\nit is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right-hand-side\nimplied the left in such cases. \nTo illustrate the first part of CRM, we now concentrate on\ntheorems of the type \n\nwhere FT\\(_?\\) is some form of Brouwer’s fan\ntheorem, and \\(T\\) is a theorem of INT. To do\nso, we need to distinguish between certain types of bar for\nthe complete binary fan \\(2^*\\) (the set of\nall finite sequences in \\(\\{0,1\\})\\).\n \nLet \\(\\alpha \\equiv (\\alpha_1 ,\\alpha_2, \\ldots)\\) be a finite or\ninfinite binary sequence. The concatenation of \\(\\alpha\\)\nwith another string \\(\\beta\\) is \n\nFor \\(b\\) in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) we write \\(\\alpha^{\\frown}b\\) rather than\n\\(\\alpha^{\\frown}(b)\\).  By a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset of\n\\(2^*\\) we mean a subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) such that \n\nfor some detachable subset \\(D\\) of \\(2^*\\). Every detachable subset\nof \\(2^*\\) is a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset. On the other hand, by a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset of \\(2^*\\) we mean a subset \\(B\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) with the following property: there exists a detachable subset\n\\(S\\) of \\(2^* \\times \\bN\\) such that \nand\n \n\nEvery \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) is a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset: simply take \\(S = D \\times \\bN\\), where \\(D\\) is a\ndetachable subset of \\(2^*\\) such that (1) holds.\n\n \nIf \\(?\\) denotes a property of subsets of \\(2^*\\), then\nBrouwer’s fan theorem for \\(?\\)-bars\ntells us that every bar with the property \\(?\\) is a uniform bar. We are\nparticularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable\nbars (already discussed in Section 3.1): \nFT\\(_D\\): Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;\n \n\nthe fan theorem for \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subsets): \nFT\\(_{\\mathsf{c}}\\): Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;\n \nthe fan theorem for \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subsets): \nFT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1}\\): Every \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bar of the complete binary fan\nis uniform;\n \nand the full fan theorem:\n \nFT: Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform.\n \nNote that, relative to BISH,\n \nFT \\(\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c \\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_D\\).\n \nLubarsky and Diener [2014] have shown that these implications are strict.\n \nTypically, we want to prove that FT\\(_?\\) is equivalent, over\nBISH, to the proposition that, for every set \\(S\\) of an\nappropriate sort, some pointwise property of the form \nactually holds uniformly in the form \nOur strategy for attacking this problem is two-fold. First, given a\nset \\(S\\) of the appropriate sort, we construct a ?-subset \\(N\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) such that\n \nThis, though, is only half of the solution. To prove that the\nimplication from (3) to (2) implies FT\\(_?\\), we consider a ?-subset\n\\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) and construct a corresponding set \\(S\\) such that\n \nThe canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman\n[1984], in which \\(S\\) is the set of values of a given uniformly\ncontinuous mapping \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR, T\\) is the set of\npositive real numbers, and \n\nThe pointwise property we consider is its uniform version being \nThe Julian-Richman results are as follows.\n Theorem 1: \nLet \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR\\) be uniformly continuous. Then there\nexists a detachable subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) such that Theorem 2: \nLet \\(B\\) be a detachable subset of \\(2^*\\). Then there exists a\nuniformly continuous \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR\\) such that \nThe proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky; see Julian &\nRichman [1984]. \nThe two Julian-Richman theorems together reveal that, relative to\nBISH, the fan theorem FT\\(_D\\) is equivalent to\nthe positivity principle, POS:\n \nEach positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \\([0,1]\\) has a\npositive infimum.\n \nIt follows that POS is derivable in INT, in which the full fan\ntheorem, not just FT\\(_D\\), is a standard\nprinciple. The situation is quiet the opposite in RUSS, where there\nexist both a detachable bar of \\(2^*\\) that is not uniform and a\npositive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \\([0,1]\\) that has\ninfimum equal to 0; see Chapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman\n[1987].\n \n\nBerger and Ishihara [2005] have taken a different, indirect route to\nestablishing the equivalence of POS and FT\\(_c\\). They\nestablish a chain of equivalences between POS,\nFT\\(_c\\), and four principles of the type “if there is\nat most one object with property \\(P\\), then there is one such\nobject”. The four unique-existence principles are: CIN!:   Each descending sequence of inhabited\nclosed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one\ncommon point has inhabited intersection (Cantor’s intersection theorem\nwith uniqueness.) Note that a subset \\(S\\) of a metric space \\((X,\\rho)\\) is located if for each \\(x\\) in \\(X\\) the infimum distance from \\(x\\) to \\(S\\) exists.\n MIN!:   Each uniformly continuous,\nreal-valued function on a compact metric space with at most one\nminimum point has a minimum point. WKL!  Each infinite tree with at most one\ninfinite branch has an infinite branch (the weak König lemma with\nuniqueness). FIX!:   Each uniformly continuous function\nfrom a compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point\nand with approximate fixed points has a fixed point. \nIn, for example, the last of these, we say that a map \\(f\\) of a\nmetric space \\((X,\\varrho)\\) into itself \nA major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan\ntheorem that is equivalent, over BISH, to the uniform continuity\ntheorem for \\([0,1]\\), \n UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\): Every pointwise continuous mapping of \\([0,1]\\) into \\(\\bR\\) is\nuniformly continuous,\n \nthe proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of\nthe fan theorem. (Note that UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\) is equivalent,\nrelative to BISH, to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric\nspaces: Every pointwise continuous mapping of a complete, totally\nbounded metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous. See, for example,\nLoeb [2005].) \nIt follows from results of Berger [2006] that\n \nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c\\).\n \nAlso, Diener and Loeb (2008) have proved that \nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\).\n \nHowever, we do not know if either of these implications can be\nreplaced by a bi-implication. Perhaps UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\), and hence\nthe full uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces, is\nequivalent, relative to BISH, to some natural, but as yet\nunidentified, version of the fan theorem.\n \nFor additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse\nmathematics, see, for example, Berger & Bridges [2007]; Diener [2008, 2012]; Diener & Loeb [2009]; and Diener & Lubarsky\n[2014]. In Dent [2013], there is a clear, though complex, diagram\nillustrating the interconnections between fan theorems, continuity,\nand omniscience principles (see Other Internet Resources).\n Interested readers may pursue the topic of constructive reverse\nmathematics in greater detail in the following supplementary\ndocument: \nConstructive mathematicians have tended to concentrate their efforts\non the field of analysis, with considerable success—witness the\nwealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop [1967]. This does not\nmean that, for example, algebra has been sidelined from the\nconstructive enterprise: the material in the monograph by Mines et al\n[1986] can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart to the\nconstructive analysis carried out by Bishop. Much more recently,\nLombardi and Quitté [2011] have published the first large\nvolume of a proposed two-volume work on constructive algebra. However,\nnot being expert in algebra, and being aware of the danger of making\nthis article too long to hold the reader’s attention, we choose not to\ndiscuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail; rather, in the\nfollowing supplementary document, we turn to constructive topology,\ndescribing some rather different approaches to that subject: Investigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to\na series of papers on preference,\nutility, and demand from 1982 onwards; see Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral\nthesis, Hendtlass [2013] substantially weakened the conditions for the\nexistence of a demand function; he also produced a wealth of results\nin fixed-point theory and its applications, in particular to\nconstructivisations of two classical proofs of the existence of an\neconomic equilibrium. In 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on\nconstructive mathematical finance, at\nLudwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich.They first showed that\nthe fundamental theorem on asset pricing, the separating hyperplane\ntheorem, and Markov’s Principle are constructively equivalent (Berger\n& Svindland [2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how\nto circumvent the nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value\ntheorem in order to prove the existence of extreme points for\nfunctions in the presence of even relatively weak convexity properties\n(Berger & Svindland [2016a]). Their project suggests that\nmathematical finance, like mathematical economics, may be a rich\nsource of elegant, practical constructive theorems. \n\nThe traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the\nconstructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical\nlogic; in order to avoid decisions, such as whether or not a real\nnumber equals 0, that cannot be made by a real computer, the\nmathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries\nsuch as those formed by recursive function theory. In contrast, the\nroute taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic\nlogic, which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible\ndecisions. This logic (together with an appropriate set- or\ntype-theoretic framework) suffices to keep the mathematics within\nconstructive boundaries. Thus the mathematician is free to work in the\nnatural style of an analyst, algebraist (e.g., Mines et al.\n[1988]), geometer, topologist (e.g., Bridges & Vîță\n[2011], Sambin forthcoming), or other normal mathematician, the only\nconstraints being those imposed by intuitionistic logic. As Bishop and\nothers have shown, the traditional belief promulgated by Hilbert and\nstill widely held today, that intuitionistic logic imposes such\nrestrictions as to render the development of serious mathematics\nimpossible, is patently false: large parts of deep modern mathematics\ncan be, and have been, produced by purely constructive\nmethods. Moreover, the link between constructive mathematics and\nprogramming holds great promise for the future implementation and\ndevelopment of abstract mathematics on the computer.","contact.mail":"d.bridges@math.canterbury.ac.nz","contact.domain":"math.canterbury.ac.nz"},{"date.published":"1997-11-18","date.changed":"2018-05-30","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-constructive/","author1":"Douglas Bridges","author2":"Erik Palmgren","author1.info":"http://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~mathdsb/","entry":"mathematics-constructive","body.text":"\n\n\n\nConstructive mathematics is distinguished from its traditional\ncounterpart, classical mathematics, by the strict interpretation of the\nphrase “there exists” as “we can construct”. In\norder to work constructively, we need to re-interpret not only the\nexistential quantifier but all the logical connectives and quantifiers\nas instructions on how to construct a proof of the statement involving\nthese logical expressions.\n\n\n\nIn this article we introduce modern constructive mathematics based on\nthe BHK-interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers. We\ndiscuss four major varieties of constructive mathematics, with\nparticular emphasis on the two varieties associated with Errett Bishop\nand Per Martin-Löf, which can be regarded as minimal constructive\nsystems. We then outline progress in (informal) constructive reverse\nmathematics, a research programme seeking to identify principles, such\nas Brouwer’s fan theorem, that, added to the minimal constructive\nvarieties, facilitate proofs of important analytic theorems. After a brief discussion of constructive algebra, economics, and finance, the entry ends with two appendices: one on certain logical principles that hold in classical, intuitionistic, and recursive mathematics and which, added to Bishop's constructive mathematics, facilitate the proof of certain useful theorems of analysis; and one discussing approaches to a constructive development of general topology.\n\n\n\n\nBefore mathematicians assert something (other than an axiom) they are\nsupposed to have proved it true. What, then, do mathematicians mean\nwhen they assert a disjunction \\(P \\vee Q\\),\nwhere \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are syntactically correct statements\nin some (formal or informal) mathematical language? A natural —\nalthough, as we shall see, not the unique — interpretation of\nthis disjunction is that not only does (at least) one of the\nstatements \\(P, Q\\) hold, but also we can decide which\none holds. Thus just as mathematicians will assert\n\\(P\\) only when they have decided that \\(P\\) holds by\nproving it, they may assert \\(P \\vee Q\\) only when\nthey either can produce a proof of \\(P\\) or else produce one of\n\\(Q\\). \n\nWith this interpretation, however, we run into a serious\nproblem in the special case where \\(Q\\) is the negation,\n\\(\\neg P\\), of \\(P\\). To assert \\(\\neg P\\) is to\nshow that \\(P\\) implies a contradiction (such as \\(0 = 1)\\). But it will\noften be that mathematicians have neither a proof of \\(P\\) nor\none of \\(\\neg P\\). To see this, we need only reflect on the\nfollowing Goldbach conjecture (GC): \nEvery even integer \\(\\gt 2\\) can be written as a sum of two\nprimes, \n\nwhich remains neither proved nor disproved despite the best efforts\nof many of the leading mathematicians since it was first raised in a\nletter from Goldbach to Euler in 1742. We are forced to conclude that,\nunder the very natural decidability interpretation of P\n\\(\\vee Q\\), only a stubborn optimist can retain a belief in the law of\nexcluded middle (LEM):  \nFor every statement \\(P\\), either \\(P\\) or \\(\\neg P\\) holds.\n \n\nClassical logic gets round this by\nwidening the interpretation of disjunction: it interprets \\(P \\vee Q\\)\nas \\(\\neg(\\neg P\\wedge \\neg Q)\\), or in other words, “it is\ncontradictory that both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be false”. In turn, this\nleads to the idealistic interpretation of existence, in which\n\\(\\exists xP(x)\\) means \\(\\neg \\forall x\\neg P(x)\\) (“it is\ncontradictory that \\(P(x)\\) be false for every \\(x\\)”). It is on\nthese interpretations of disjunction and existence that mathematicians\nhave built the grand, and apparently impregnable, edifice of classical\nmathematics which serves a foundation for the physical, the social,\nand (increasingly) the biological sciences. However, the wider\ninterpretations come at a cost: for example, when we pass from our\ninitial, natural interpretation of \\(P \\vee Q\\) to the unrestricted\nuse of the idealistic one, \\(\\neg(\\neg P\\wedge \\neg Q)\\), the\nresulting mathematics cannot generally be interpreted within\ncomputational models such as recursive function theory. \n\nThis point is illustrated by a well-worn example, the\nproposition: \nThere exist irrational numbers \\(a, b\\) such that \\(a^b\\) is\nrational. \n\nA slick classical proof goes as follows. Either\n\\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) is rational, in which case we take \\(a = b =\n\\sqrt{2}\\); or else \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) is irrational, in which\ncase we take \\(a = \\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{2}\\) (see\nDummett 1977 [2000], 6). But as it stands, this proof does not enable\nus to pinpoint which of the two choices of the pair \\((a,b)\\) has the\nrequired property. In order to determine the correct choice of\n\\((a,b)\\), we would need to decide whether \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\nis rational or irrational, which is precisely to employ our initial\ninterpretation of disjunction with \\(P\\) the statement\n“\\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\) is rational”. \n\nHere is another illustration of the difference between\ninterpretations. Consider the following simple statement about the set\n\\(\\bR\\) of real numbers: \n\nwhere, for reasons that we divulge shortly, \\(x \\ne 0\\) means that we\ncan find a rational number \\(r\\) with \\(0 \\lt r \\lt \\abs{x}\\). A\nnatural computational interpretation of (*) is that we have a\nprocedure which, applied to any real number \\(x\\), either tells us\nthat \\(x = 0\\) or else tells us that \\(x \\ne 0\\). (For example, such a\nprocedure might output 0 if \\(x = 0\\), and 1 if \\(x \\ne 0\\).) However,\nbecause the computer can handle real numbers only by means of finite\nrational approximations, we have the problem of underflow, in\nwhich a sufficiently small positive number can be misread as 0 by the\ncomputer; so there cannot be a decision procedure that justifies the\nstatement (*). In other words, we cannot expect (*) to hold under our\nnatural computational interpretation of the quantifier \\(\\forall\\) and\nthe connective \\(\\vee\\). \n\nLet’s examine this from another angle. Let \\(G(n)\\) act as\nshorthand for the statement “\\(2n + 2\\) is a sum of two\nprimes”, where \\(n\\) ranges over the positive integers, and\ndefine an infinite binary sequence \\(\\ba = (a_1 ,a_2,\\ldots)\\)\nas follows: \n\nThere is no question that \\(\\ba\\) is a computationally\nwell-defined sequence, in the sense that we have an algorithm for\ncomputing \\(a_n\\) for each \\(n\\): check the even numbers\n\\(4,6,8,\\ldots ,2n+2\\) to determine whether each of them is a sum of\ntwo primes; in that case, set \\(a_n = 0\\), and in the contrary case,\nset \\(a_n = 1\\). Now consider the real number whose \\(n\\)th\nbinary digit is \\(a_n\\): \n\nIf (*) holds under our computational interpretation, then we can\ndecide between the following two alternatives: \n\nIn the latter case, by testing \\(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_N\\), we can find \\(n\n\\le N\\) such that \\(a_n = 1\\). Thus the computational interpretation\nof (*) enables us to decide whether there exists \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n\n= 1\\); in other words, it enables us to decide the status of the\nGoldbach Conjecture. An example of this type, showing that a\nconstructive proof of some classical result \\(P\\) would enable us to\nsolve the Goldbach conjecture (and, by similar arguments, many other\nhitherto open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis), is called\na Brouwerian example for, or even a Brouwerian\ncounterexample to, the statement \\(P\\) (though it is not a\ncounterexample in the normal sense of that word). The use of the Goldbach Conjecture here is purely dramatic. For, the argument of the preceding paragraph can be modified to show\nthat, under our computational interpretation, (*) implies\nthe limited principle of omniscience (LPO): \nFor each binary sequence \\((a_1 ,a_2, \\ldots)\\) either \\(a_n = 0\\) for\nall \\(n\\) or else there exists \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n = 1\\),\n \n\nwhich is generally regarded as an essentially nonconstructive\nprinciple for several reasons. First, its recursive\ninterpretation, \nThere is a recursive algorithm which, applied to any recursively\ndefined binary sequence \\((a_1 ,a_2, \\ldots)\\), outputs 0 if \\(a_n =\n0\\) for all \\(n\\), and outputs 1 if \\(a_n = 1\\) for some \\(n\\), \n\nis provably false within recursive function theory, even with\nclassical logic (see Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 3); so if we\nwant to allow a recursive interpretation of all our mathematics, then\nwe cannot use LPO. Secondly, there is a model theory (Kripke models)\nin which it can be shown that LPO is not constructively derivable\n(Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 7). \n\nIt should, by now, be clear that a full-blooded computational\ndevelopment of mathematics disallows the idealistic interpretations of\ndisjunction and existence upon which most classical mathematics\ndepends. In order to work constructively, we need to return\nfrom the classical interpretations to the natural constructive\nones: \n\nThese BHK-interpretations (the name reflects their origin in\nthe work of Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov) can be made more precise\nusing Kleene’s notion of realizability; see (Dummett\n[1977/2000], 222–234; Beeson [1985], Chapter VII). \n\nWhat sort of things are we looking for if we are serious about\ndeveloping mathematics in such a way that when a theorem asserts the\nexistence of an object \\(x\\) with a property \\(P\\), then the proof of\nthe theorem embodies algorithms for constructing \\(x\\) and for\ndemonstrating, by whatever calculations are necessary, that \\(x\\) has\nthe property \\(P\\). Here are some examples of theorems, each followed\nby an informal description of the requirements for its constructive\nproof. Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a given\nreal number \\(x\\), decides whether \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x \\ne 0\\). Note\nthat, in order to make this decision, the algorithm might use not only\nthe data describing \\(x\\) but also the data showing that \\(x\\) is\nactually a real number. \nProof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a set\n\\(S\\) of real numbers, a member \\(s\\) of \\(S\\), and an\nupper bound for \\(S\\), \nProof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the\nfunction \\(f\\), a modulus of continuity for \\(f\\), and the values\n\\(f(0)\\) and \\(f(1)\\),  \nProof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the\nfunction \\(f\\), a modulus of continuity for \\(f\\), the values\n\\(f(0)\\) and \\(f(1)\\), and a positive number \\(\\varepsilon\\),  \n\nWe already have reasons for doubting that (A) has a constructive\nproof. If the proof requirements for (B) can be fulfilled, then, given\nany mathematical statement \\(P\\), we can apply our proof of (B)\nto compute a rational approximation \\(z\\) to the supremum \\(\\sigma\\)\nof the set \nwith error \\(\\lt \\bfrac{1}{4}\\). We can then determine whether \\(z \\gt\n\\bfrac{1}{4}\\), in which case \\(\\sigma \\gt 0\\), or \\(z \\lt\n\\bfrac{3}{4}\\), when \\(\\sigma \\lt 1\\). In the first case, there exists\n\\(x \\in S\\) with \\(x \\gt 0\\), so we must have \\(x = 1\\) and therefore\n\\(P\\). In the case \\(\\sigma \\lt 1\\), we have \\(\\neg P\\). Thus (B)\nimplies the law of excluded middle. \nHowever, in Bishop’s constructive theory of the real numbers, based on\nCauchy sequences with a preassigned convergence rate, we can prove the\nfollowing constructive least-upper-bound principle: \n\nIn passing, we mention an alternative development of the constructive\ntheory of \\(\\bR\\) based on interval arithmetic; see Chapter\n2 of Bridges & Vîță [2006]. \n\nEach of statements (C) and (D), which are classically equivalent, is\na version of the Intermediate Value Theorem. In these statements, a\nmodulus of continuity for \\(f\\) is a set \\(\\Omega\\) of ordered\npairs \\((\\varepsilon ,\\delta)\\) of positive real numbers with the following\ntwo properties: \n\nStatement (C) entails another essentially nonconstructive principle, the lesser limited principle of\nomniscience (LLPO): \nFor each binary sequence \\((a_1,a_2,\\ldots)\\) with at most one term\nequal to 1, either \\(a_n = 0\\) for all even \\(n\\) or else \\(a_n = 0\\)\nfor all odd \\(n\\). \n\nStatement (D), a weak form of (C), can be proved constructively,\nusing an interval-halving argument of a standard type. The following\nstronger constructive intermediate value theorem, which suffices for\nmost practical purposes, is proved using an approximate-interval-halving argument: \nLet \\(f\\) be a continuous real-valued mapping on the closed interval\n\\([0,1]\\) such that \\(f(0)\\cdot f(1) \\lt 0\\). Suppose\nalso that \\(f\\) is locally nonzero, in the sense that for\neach \\(x \\in [0,1]\\) and each \\(r \\gt 0\\), there exists \\(y\\) such\nthat \\(\\abs{x - y} \\lt r\\) and \\(f(y) \\ne 0\\). Then there exists \\(x\\)\nsuch that \\(0 \\lt x \\lt 1\\) and \\(f(x) = 0\\). \n\nThe situation of the intermediate value theorem is typical of many\nin constructive analysis, where we find one classical theorem with\nseveral constructive versions, some or all of which may be equivalent\nunder classical logic. \n\nThere is one omniscience principle whose constructive status is less\nclear than that of LPO and LLPO—namely, Markov’s\nprinciple (MP): \nFor each binary sequence \\((a_n)\\), if it is contradictory that all\nthe terms \\(a_n\\) equal 0, then there exists a term equal to\n1. \n\nThis principle is equivalent to a number of simple classical\npropositions, including the following: \n\nMarkov’s principle represents an unbounded search: if you have a\nproof that all terms \\(a_n\\) being 0 leads to a contradiction, then,\nby testing the terms \\(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots\\) in turn, you are\nguaranteed to come across a term equal to 1; but this\nguarantee does not extend to an assurance that you will find the\ndesired term before the end of the universe. Most practitioners of\nconstructive mathematics view Markov’s principle with at least\nsuspicion, if not downright disbelief. Such views are reinforced by\nthe observation that there is a Kripke Model showing that MP is not\nconstructively derivable (Bridges & Richman [1987],\n137–138.) \n\nThe desire to retain the possibility of a computational\ninterpretation is one motivation for using the constructive\nreinterpretations of the logical connectives and quantifiers that we\ngave above; but it is not exactly the motivation of the pioneers of\nconstructivism in mathematics. In this section we look at some of the\ndifferent approaches to constructivism in mathematics over the past 130\nyears. \n\nIn the late nineteenth century, certain individuals—most\nnotably Kronecker and Poincaré—had expressed doubts about, or even disapproval of, the idealistic, nonconstructive methods used by\nsome of their contemporaries; but it is in the polemical writings of\n L.E.J. Brouwer\n (1881–1966), beginning with his\nAmsterdam doctoral thesis, Brouwer [1907], and continuing over the next\nforty-seven years, that the foundations of a precise, systematic\napproach to constructive mathematics were laid. In Brouwer’s\nphilosophy, known as intuitionism, mathematics is a free\ncreation of the human mind, and an object exists if and only if it can\nbe (mentally) constructed. If one takes that philosophical stance, then\none is inexorably drawn to the foregoing constructive interpretation of\nthe logical connectives and quantifiers: for how could a proof of the\nimpossibility of the non-existence of a certain object \\(x\\)\ndescribe a mental construction of \\(x\\)? \n\nBrouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, as is shown by\nthe following quotation: \n\nA modern version of Brouwer’s view was given by Errett Bishop (Bishop\n[1967], p. 2):  \n\nHowever obscure Brouwer’s writings could be, one thing was always\nclear: for him, mathematics took precedence over logic. One might say,\nas Hermann Weyl did in the following passage, that Brouwer saw\nclassical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical logic\nwithout reference to the underlying mathematics:  \n\nIn particular, this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence\nproofs which, in Weyl’s words, “inform the world that a\ntreasure exists without disclosing its location”.  \n\nIn order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist\nmathematician, it was necessary first to analyse the mathematical\nprocesses of the mind, from which analysis the logic could be\nextracted. In 1930, Brouwer’s most famous pupil, Arend Heyting,\npublished a set of formal axioms which so clearly characterise the\nlogic used by the intuitionist that they have become universally known\nas the axioms for\n intuitionistic logic\n (Heyting [1930]). These axioms captured the informal\nBHK-interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that\nwe gave earlier. \n\nIntuitionistic mathematics diverges from other types of constructive\nmathematics in its interpretation of the term “sequence”.\nNormally, a sequence in constructive mathematics is given by a rule\nwhich determines, in advance, how to construct each of its terms; such\na sequence may be said to be lawlike or\npredeterminate. Brouwer generalised this notion of a sequence\nto include the possibility of constructing the terms one-by-one, the\nchoice of each term being made freely, or subject only to certain\nrestrictions stipulated in advance. Most manipulations of sequences do\nnot require that they be predeterminate, and can be performed on these\nmore general free choice sequences. \n\nThus, for the intuitionist, a real number \\(\\bx = (x_1\n,x_2,\\ldots)\\)—essentially, a Cauchy sequence of rational\nnumbers—need not be given by a rule: its terms \\(x_1\n,x_2,\\ldots\\), are simply rational numbers, successively constructed,\nsubject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following\none used by Bishop [1967]: \n\nOnce free choice sequences are admitted into mathematics,\nso, perhaps to one’s initial surprise, are certain strong choice\nprinciples. Let \\(P\\) be a subset of \\(\\bN^{\\bN} \\times \\bN\\) (where\n\\(\\bN\\) denotes the set of natural numbers and, for sets \\(A\\) and\n\\(B, B^A\\) denotes the set of mappings from \\(A\\) into \\(B)\\), and\nsuppose that for each \\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\) there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\)\nsuch that \\((\\ba,n) \\in P\\). From a constructive point of view, this\nmeans that we have a procedure, applicable to sequences, that computes\n\\(n\\) for any given \\(\\ba\\). According to Brouwer, the construction of\nan element of \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) is forever incomplete: a generic sequence\n\\(\\ba\\) is purely extensional, in the sense that at any given\nmoment we can know nothing about \\(\\ba\\) other than a finite set of\nits terms. It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate,\nfrom some finite initial sequence \\((a_0 ,\\ldots ,a_N)\\) of terms of\n\\(\\ba\\), a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\(P(\\ba,n)\\). If \\(\\bb \\in\n\\bN^{\\bN}\\) is any sequence such that \\(b_{k} = a_{k}\\) for \\(0 \\le k\n\\le N\\), then our procedure must return the same \\(n\\) for \\(\\bb\\) as\nit does for \\(\\ba\\). This means that \\(n\\) is a continuous function of\n\\(\\ba\\) with respect to the topology on \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) given by the\nmetric  \n\nWe are therefore led to the following principle of continuous\nchoice, which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part.  CC1 : Any function from \\(\\bN^{\\bN}\\) to\n\\(\\bN\\) is continuous.  \n CC2 : If \\(P \\subseteq \\bN^{\\bN} \\times \\bN\\), and for each\n\\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\) there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\) such that \\((\\ba,n) \\in\nP\\), then there is a function \\(f : \\bN^{\\bN} \\rightarrow \\bN\\) such\nthat \\((\\ba,f(\\ba)) \\in P\\) for all \\(\\ba \\in \\bN^{\\bN}\\). \n\nIf \\(P\\) and \\(f\\) are as in CC2, then we say that \\(f\\) is a\nchoice function for \\(P\\). \n\nThe omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under\nthe hypotheses CC1–2; but MP is consistent with it. Among the\nremarkable consequences of CC1–2 are the following. \n \nexists. Then there exists \\(c \\gt 0\\) such that \\(\\lVert u_n (x)\\rVert\n\\le c\\) for all \\(n\\in \\bN\\) and all unit vectors \\(x\\) of \\(X\\)\n(Uniform boundedness principle). \n\nEach of these statements appears to contradict known classical\ntheorems. However, the comparison with classical mathematics should\nnot be made superficially: in order to understand that there is no\nreal contradiction here, we must appreciate that the meaning of such\nterms as “function” and even “real number” in\nintuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the\nclassical setting. (In practice, intuitionistic mathematics cannot be\ncompared, readily and directly, with classical mathematics.)\n\n \n\nBrouwer’s introspection over the nature of functions and the\ncontinuum led him to a second principle, which, unlike that of\ncontinuous choice, is classically valid. This principle requires a\nlittle more background for its explanation. \n\nFor any set \\(S\\) we denote by \\(S^*\\) the set of all finite sequences\nof elements of \\(S\\), including the empty sequence \\((\\ )\\). If\n\\(\\alpha = (a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) is in \\(S^*\\), then \\(n\\) is called\nthe length of \\(\\alpha\\) and is denoted by\n\\(\\abs{\\alpha}\\). If \\(m \\in \\bN\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) is a finite or\ninfinite sequence in \\(S\\) of length at least \\(m\\), then we denote by\n\\(\\bar{\\alpha}(m)\\) the finite sequence consisting of the first \\(m\\)\nterms of \\(\\alpha\\).  Note that \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(0) = (\\ )\\) and \\(\\abs{\\bar{\\alpha}(0)}\\) = 0 . If\n\\(\\alpha \\in S^*\\) and \\(\\beta = \\bar{\\alpha}(m)\\) for some \\(m\\), we\nsay that \\(\\alpha\\) is an extension of \\(\\beta\\), and that\n\\(\\beta\\) is a restriction of \\(\\alpha\\). \n\nA subset \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(S\\) is said to be detachable\n(from \\(S)\\) if \nA detachable subset \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(\\bN^*\\) is called a fan\nif\n \n\nis finite or empty, where \\(\\alpha^* n\\) denotes the\nfinite sequence obtained by adjoining the natural number \\(n\\) to\nthe terms of \\(\\alpha\\). \n\nA path in a fan \\(\\sigma\\) is a sequence \\(\\alpha\\), finite\nor infinite, such that \\(\\bar{\\alpha}(n) \\in \\sigma\\) for each\napplicable \\(n\\). We say that a path \\(\\alpha\\) is blocked by\na subset \\(B\\) if some restriction of \\(\\alpha\\) is in \\(B\\); if no\nrestriction of \\(\\alpha\\) is in \\(B\\), we say that \\(\\alpha\\)\n misses \\(B\\). A subset \\(B\\) of a fan\n\\(\\sigma\\) is called a bar for \\(\\sigma\\) if each infinite path of\n\\(\\sigma\\) is blocked by \\(B\\); a bar \\(B\\) for \\(\\sigma\\) is\nuniform if there exists \\(n \\in \\bN\\)\nsuch that each path of length \\(n\\) is blocked by \\(B\\). \n\nAt last we can state Brouwer’s next principle of\nintuitionism, the fan theorem for detachable\nbars (FT\\(_D\\)): \n Every detachable bar of a fan is uniform. \n\nIn its classical contrapositive form, FT\\(_D\\) is known as\nKönig’s Lemma: if for every \\(n\\) there exists a\npath of length \\(n\\) that misses \\(B\\), then there exists an\ninfinite path that misses \\(B\\) (see Dummett 1977 [2000],\n49–53). (Of course, classically the condition of detachability\nis superfluous.) It is simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample\nto König’s Lemma. \nBrouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of\ndetachability of the bar. Attempts to prove that more general fan\ntheorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a\nsubset is a bar, and led Brouwer to a notion of bar\ninduction; this is discussed in Section 3.6 of the entry\n on intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics;\n another good reference for bar induction is van Atten (2004).\n We shall return to fan theorems in Section 4.\n \n\nOf the many applications of Brouwer’s principles, the most famous is\nhis uniform continuity theorem (which follows from the\npointwise continuity consequences of CC1-2 together a form of fan\ntheorem more general than FT\\(_D)\\): \n\nThe reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within\nBrouwer’s intuitionistic framework, and not to jump to the erroneous\nconclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical mathematics. It is\nmore sensible to regard the two types of mathematics as incomparable.\nFor further discussion, see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic. \n\nUnfortunately — and perhaps inevitably, in the face of\nopposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert —\nBrouwer’s intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy became more\nand more involved in what, at least to classical mathematicians,\nappeared to be quasi-mystical speculation about the nature of\nconstructive thought, to the detriment of the practice of constructive\nmathematics itself. This unfortunate polarisation between the\nBrouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious\nGrundlagenstreit of the 1920s, details of which can be found in the\nBrouwer biographies by van Dalen [1999, 2005] and van Stigt [1990]. \n\nIn the late 1940s, the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov began the\ndevelopment of an alternative form of constructive mathematics (RUSS),\nwhich is, essentially,\n recursive function \ntheory with intuitionistic\nlogic (Markov [1954], Kushner [1985]). In this variety the objects are\ndefined by means of Gödel-numberings, and the procedures are all\nrecursive; the main distinction between RUSS and the classical\nrecursive analysis developed after the work of Turing,\nChurch, and others in 1936 clarified the nature of computable processes is\nthat the logic used in RUSS is intuitionistic. \n\nOne obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips\nwith RUSS is that, being expressed in the language of recursion\ntheory, it is not easily readable; indeed, on opening a page of\nKushner’s excellent lectures [1985], one might be forgiven for\nwondering whether this is analysis or logic. (This remark should be\ntempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on\nclassical recursive analysis by Aberth [1980, 2001].) Fortunately, one\ncan get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman\n[1983] (see also Chapter 3 of Bridges & Richman [1987]). \n\nFirst, we define a set \\(S\\) to be countable if there\nis a mapping from a detachable subset of \\(\\bN\\) onto\n\\(S\\). With intuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every\nsubset of \\(\\bN\\) is detachable (the reader is invited to provide a\nBrouwerian example to demonstrate this). Countable subsets of \\(\\bN\\)\nin Richman’s axiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively\nenumerable sets in the normal development of RUSS. \n\nBy a partial function on \\(\\bN\\) we\nmean a mapping whose domain is a subset of \\(\\bN\\); if the\ndomain is \\(\\bN\\) itself, then we call the function a\ntotal partial function on \\(\\bN\\). Richman’s\napproach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and a single axiom\nof computable partial functions (CPF): \nThere is an enumeration \\(\\phi_0 ,\\phi_1,\\ldots\\) of the set of all\npartial functions from \\(\\bN\\) to \\(\\bN\\) with countable\ndomains. \n\nIt is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this\nprinciple. For example, we can prove the following result, which almost\nimmediately shows that LLPO, and hence LPO, are false in the recursive\nsetting.  \n\nOf more interest, however, are results such as the following within\nRUSS.  \n\nFrom a classical viewpoint, these results fit into place when one\nrealises that words such as “function” and “real\nnumber” should be interpreted as “recursive\nfunction” and “recursive real number”\nrespectively. Note that the second of the above four recursive\ntheorems is a strong recursive counterexample to the open-cover\ncompactness property of the (recursive) real line; and the fourth is a\nrecursive counterexample to the classical theorem that every uniformly\ncontinuous mapping of a compact set into\n\\(\\bR\\) attains its infimum. \n\nProgress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively\nslow throughout the next decade and a half. What was needed to raise\nthe profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top-ranking\nclassical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive\ndevelopment of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to\nBrouwer’s non-classical principles or to the machinery of recursive\nfunction theory. This need was fulfilled in 1967, with the appearance\nof Errett Bishop’s monograph Foundations of Constructive\nAnalysis [1967], the product of an astonishing couple of years in\nwhich, working in the informal but rigorous style used by normal\nanalysts, Bishop provided a constructive development of a large part of\ntwentieth-century analysis, including the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem,\nthe Hahn-Banach and separation theorems, the spectral theorem for\nself-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, the Lebesgue convergence\ntheorems for abstract integrals, Haar measure and the abstract Fourier\ntransform, ergodic theorems, and the elements of Banach algebra theory.\n(See also Bishop & Bridges [1985].) Thus, at a stroke, he gave the\nlie to the commonly-held view expressed so forcefully by Hilbert:  \n\nNot only did Bishop’s mathematics BISH have the advantage\nof readability — if you open Bishop’s book at any page,\nwhat you see is clearly recognisable as analysis, even if, from time\nto time, his moves in the course of a proof may appear strange to one\nschooled in the use of the law of excluded middle — but, unlike\nintuitionistic or recursive mathematics, it admits many different\ninterpretations. Intuitionistic mathematics, recursive constructive\nmathematics, and even classical mathematics all provide models of\nBISH. In fact, the results and proofs in BISH can be interpreted, with\nat most minor amendments, in any reasonable model of computable\nmathematics, such as, for example, Weihrauch’s Type Two\nEffectivity Theory (Weihrauch [2000]; Bauer [2005]).  \n\nHow is this multiple interpretability achieved? At least in part by\nBishop’s refusal to pin down his primitive notion of\n“algorithm” or, in his words, “finite routine”.\nThis refusal has led to the criticism that his approach lacks the\nprecision that a logician would normally expect of a foundational\nsystem. However, this criticism can be overcome by looking more closely\nat what practitioners of BISH actually do when they prove theorems: in practice,\nthey are doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic.\nExperience shows that the restriction to intuitionistic logic always\nforces mathematicians to work in a manner that, at least informally,\ncan be described as algorithmic; so algorithmic mathematics appears\nto be equivalent to mathematics that uses only intuitionistic\nlogic. If that is the case, then we can practice constructive\nmathematics using intuitionistic logic on any reasonably defined\nmathematical objects, not just some class of “constructive\nobjects”. \n\nThis view, more or less, appears to have first been put forward by\nRichman [1990, 1996]. Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of\nconstructive mathematics, it does not reflect the primacy of\nmathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer, Heyting,\nMarkov, Bishop, and other pioneers of constructivism. On the other\nhand, it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in\npractice. \n\nThus one might distinguish between the ontological\nconstructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive\nmathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental\ncreations, and the epistemological constructivism of Richman\nand those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its\nmethodology, based on the use of intuitionistic logic. Of course, the\nformer approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter; and\nthe latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian\nontology. \nTo do actual mathematics we need more than just\nintutionistic logic. For Bishop, the building blocks of mathematics\nwere the positive integers (see the quote from Bishop [1967] in Section\n3.1 above). Among the early formal systems for BISH\nwere Myhill’s [1975] axiomatic foundation based on\nprimitive notions of number, set, and function; Feferman’s\n[1975] system for explicit mathematics; and Friedman’s\n[1977] intuitionistic ZF set theory. The two most favoured formal underpinnings of BISH at this stage\nare the CZF set theory\nof Aczel and Rathjen [2000], and the\n intuitionistic type theory of Martin-Löf [1975, 1984]. \n\nBefore ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive\nmathematics, we visit a fourth variety, based on Per Martin-Löf’s\nintuitionistic type theory (ML). \nMartin-Löf published his Notes on\nConstructive Mathematics [1968], based on lectures he had given in\nEurope in 1966–68; so his involvement with constructivism in\nmathematics goes back at least to the period of Bishop’s writing\nof Foundations of Constructive Analysis. Martin-Löf’s\nbook is in the spirit of RUSS, rather than BISH; indeed, its author\ndid not have access to Bishop’s book until his own manuscript was\nfinished. Martin-Löf later turned his attention to his theory of\ntypes as a foundation for Bishop-style constructive mathematics.  \n\nHere, in his own words, is an informal explanation of the ideas\nunderlying ML: \n\nIn particular, in this system every proposition can be represented as a\ntype: namely, the type of proofs of the proposition. Conversely, each\ntype determines a proposition: namely, the proposition that the type in\nquestion is inhabited. So when we think of a certain type \\(T\\) as a\nproposition, we interpret the formula  \n\nas “\\(x\\) is a proof of the proposition \\(T\\)”.  \n\nMartin-Löf goes on to construct new types, such as Cartesian\nproducts and disjoint unions, from old. For example, the Cartesian\nproduct \n\nis the type of functions that take an arbitrary object \\(x\\) of type \\(A\\)\ninto an object of type \\(B(x)\\). In the\npropositions-as-proofs interpretation, where \\(B(x)\\)\nrepresents a proposition, the above Cartesian product corresponds to\nthe universal proposition \n\nMartin-Löf distinguishes carefully between proofs and derivations: a\nproof object is a witness to the fact that some proposition\nhas been proved; whereas a derivation is the record of the\nconstruction of a proof object. Also, he exercises two\nbasic forms (one dare not say “types” here) of\njudgement. The first is a relation between proof objects and\npropositions, the second a property of some propositions. In the first\ncase, the judgement is either one that a proof object \\(a\\) is a\nwitness to a proposition \\(A\\), or else one that two proof objects\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are equal and both witness that \\(A\\)\nhas been proved. The first case of the second form of judgement states\nthat a proposition \\(A\\) is well-formed, and the second records\nthat two propositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equal.  There is a careful, and highly detailed, set of rules for\nformalising ML. We will not go into those here, but refer the reader\nto other sources such as Sambin &\nSmith [1998]. \nWhen actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory, one often\nneeds to equip completely presented sets (types) with an equivalence\nrelation, the combination being known as a setoid. Mappings\nare then functions that respect those equivalence relations. This is in\nclose agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory of\nsets. The dependent types of Martin-Löf are useful for\nconstructing subsets. For instance, the real numbers can be\nconstructed using the \\(\\Sigma\\)-type (see Martin-Löf [1984]): An element of this type \\(B\\) is thereby a pair consisting of a\nconvergent sequence \\(\\bx\\) of rationals and a proof \\(p\\) that\nit is convergent. A suitable equivalence relation \\({\\sim}\\) on \\(R\\)\nis defined by taking \\((x,p)\\sim(y,q)\\) to mean The resulting setoid of real numbers is \\(\\bR =\n(R,{\\sim})\\). We can readily prove that and then, using the type-theoretic axiom of choice (see Section 4\nbelow), find a function \\(f : \\bR\\rightarrow \\bZ\\) such that \\(f(x)\n\\lt x \\lt f(x)+2\\). However, there is no reason to believe that the\nfunction \\(f\\) respects the equivalence relations—that is, that\n\\(f(x) = f(y)\\) holds if \\(x \\sim y\\).  Every constructive proof embodies an algorithm that, in principle,\ncan be extracted and recast as a computer program; moreover, the\nconstructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is\ncorrect — that is, meets its specification. One major advantage\nof Martin-Löf’s formal approach to constructive mathematics is\nthat it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs.\nThis has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive\nmathematics in various locations (see Martin-Löf [1980], Constable\n[1986], Hayashi & Nakano [1988], Schwichtenberg [2009]). Some recent implementations of\ntype theory for proof extraction are Coq and Agda (see the links in\nOther Internet Resources). \nThe full axiom of choice can be stated as follows: If \\(A,B\\) are inhabited sets, and \\(S\\) a subset of \\(A \\times B\\)\nsuch that \n\nthen there exists a choice function \\(f : A \\rightarrow B\\) such that  \n\nNow, if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation, then for\na given \\(x \\in A\\), the value \\(f(x)\\) of\nthe choice function will depend not only on \\(x\\) but also on\nthe data proving that \\(x\\) belongs to \\(A.\\) In\ngeneral, we cannot expect to produce a choice function of this\nsort. However, the BHK interpretation of the hypotheses in the axiom\nis that there is an algorithm\n \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\n which, applied to any given\n\\(x \\in A\\), produces an element\n\\(y \\in B\\) such that \\((x,y)\n\\in S\\). If \\(A\\) is a completely presented set, one\nfor which no work beyond the construction of each element in the set\nis required to prove that the element does indeed belong\nto \\(A\\), then we might reasonably expect the algorithm\n \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) to be a choice function. In\n Martin-Löf’s type theory, every set is completely\n presented and, in keeping with the BHK interpretation, the axiom\n of choice is derivable. On the other hand, in Bishop-style mathematics, completely\npresented–––or, in his terminology,\nbasic–––sets are rare, one example being\n\\(\\bN\\); so we might expect that the axiom of choice would\nnot be derivable. In fact, as was shown by Diaconescu [1975] and\nGoodman & Myhill [1978], and prefigured by Bishop himself in\nProblem 2 on page 58 of Bishop 1967, the axiom of choice implies the\nlaw of excluded middle. Clearly, the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem\napplies only under the assumption that not every set is completely\npresented. Constructive mathematicians not working in ML typically reject the\nfull axiom of choice but embrace the axiom of countable choice, in\nwhich the domain of choice is \\(\\bN\\), and dependent\nchoice. But some prefer to work without even countable choice, on the\ngrounds that to speak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule\npresents a difficulty that is just as great whether or not the\ninfinity is denumerable. Interestingly, Lebesgue made precisely this\npoint in a letter to Borel (see Moore [2013], page 316):  \nThe effect of abandoning even countable choice is the exclusion of\nmany theorems that, as they stand, are proved using sequential,\nchoice-based arguments. But those who advocate avoiding choice would\nargue that avoiding choice forces you to formulate things better. \nA particular case of interest is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:\nevery complex polynomial has at least one root in the complex\nplane. Richman [2000] has shown that without countable choice, although we\ncan construct only isolated (possibly multiple) roots, we\ncan construct arbitrarily close approximations to the multiset of\nroots. Such an approach focusses on finding an approximate linear\nfactorization of the polynomial, rather than on finding separate\napproximations to each of its roots. \nFor further analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type theory see\nMartin-Löf [2006], and the SEP entries on \n category theory,\ntype theory, and \nintuitionistic type theory. \nIn the 1970s, Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of\nreverse mathematics, aiming to classify mathematical theorems\naccording to their equivalence to one of a small number of\nset-theoretic principles (Friedman 1975). This classification reveals\ninteresting, sometimes remarkable, differences in proof-theoretic\ncomplexity. For example, although the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem is\nused in the standard proof of Peano’s existence theorem for solutions\nof ordinary differential equations (Hurewicz [1958], page 10), a\nreverse-mathematical analysis shows that the former is equivalent to a\nstrictly stronger set-theoretic principle than the one equivalent to\nPeano’s theorem (Simpson [1984], Theorems 3.9 and 4.2). The standard\ntreatise on classical reverse mathematics is (Simpson [1999/2009]).\n \nAround the turn of this century, Veldman (see Other Internet Resources), in the\nNetherlands, and Ishihara [2005, 2006], in Japan,\nindependently initiated a programme of constructive reverse\nmathematics (CRM), based on intuitionistic, rather than\nclassical, logic. (Note, though, that the first published work in the\nmodern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [1984], which\nwas twenty years ahead of its time.) In this section of the article,\nwe describe a less formal approach to CRM, in the style and framework\nof BISH. The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in\nthe three standard models—CLASS, INT, and RUSS—according\nto which principles we must, and need only, add to BISH in order to\nprove them.\n \nWe stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal\nCRM, in which we take for granted the principles\nof function- and set-construction described in the first chapters\nof Bishop [1967] or Bishop & Bridges [1985], and we work in the informal,\nthough rigorous, style of the practising analyst, algebraist,\ntopologist, … .\n \nIn practice, CRM splits naturally into two parts. In the first of\nthese, we consider a theorem \\(T\\) of INT or RUSS, and try to\nfind some principle, valid in that model and other than \\(T\\)\nitself, whose addition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a\nconstructive proof of \\(T\\). In the second part of CRM we deal\nwith a theorem \\(T\\) of CLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive,\nand we try to prove that \\(T\\) is equivalent, over BISH, to one\nof a number of known essentially-nonconstructive principles, such as\nMP, LLPO, LPO, or LEM. For an example of this part of CRM, we mention\nour earlier proof that the classical least-upper-bound principle\nimplies, and hence is equivalent to, LEM.\n \nIncidentally, there is a strong argument for Brouwer [1921] being the first\nto deal with reverse-mathematical ideas: his Brouwerian\ncounterexamples (see the one using the Goldbach conjecture, in Section\n1 above) lie squarely in the second\npart of CRM. Even if Brouwer did not state those examples as logical\nequivalences, but as implications of the type \n\nit is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right-hand-side\nimplied the left in such cases. \nTo illustrate the first part of CRM, we now concentrate on\ntheorems of the type \n\nwhere FT\\(_?\\) is some form of Brouwer’s fan\ntheorem, and \\(T\\) is a theorem of INT. To do\nso, we need to distinguish between certain types of bar for\nthe complete binary fan \\(2^*\\) (the set of\nall finite sequences in \\(\\{0,1\\})\\).\n \nLet \\(\\alpha \\equiv (\\alpha_1 ,\\alpha_2, \\ldots)\\) be a finite or\ninfinite binary sequence. The concatenation of \\(\\alpha\\)\nwith another string \\(\\beta\\) is \n\nFor \\(b\\) in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) we write \\(\\alpha^{\\frown}b\\) rather than\n\\(\\alpha^{\\frown}(b)\\).  By a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset of\n\\(2^*\\) we mean a subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) such that \n\nfor some detachable subset \\(D\\) of \\(2^*\\). Every detachable subset\nof \\(2^*\\) is a \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset. On the other hand, by a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset of \\(2^*\\) we mean a subset \\(B\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) with the following property: there exists a detachable subset\n\\(S\\) of \\(2^* \\times \\bN\\) such that \nand\n \n\nEvery \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) is a\n\\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subset: simply take \\(S = D \\times \\bN\\), where \\(D\\) is a\ndetachable subset of \\(2^*\\) such that (1) holds.\n\n \nIf \\(?\\) denotes a property of subsets of \\(2^*\\), then\nBrouwer’s fan theorem for \\(?\\)-bars\ntells us that every bar with the property \\(?\\) is a uniform bar. We are\nparticularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable\nbars (already discussed in Section 3.1): \nFT\\(_D\\): Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;\n \n\nthe fan theorem for \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\mathsf{c}\\)-subsets): \nFT\\(_{\\mathsf{c}}\\): Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;\n \nthe fan theorem for \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bars (that is, bars that\nare \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-subsets): \nFT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1}\\): Every \\(\\Pi^{0}_1\\)-bar of the complete binary fan\nis uniform;\n \nand the full fan theorem:\n \nFT: Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform.\n \nNote that, relative to BISH,\n \nFT \\(\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c \\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_D\\).\n \nLubarsky and Diener [2014] have shown that these implications are strict.\n \nTypically, we want to prove that FT\\(_?\\) is equivalent, over\nBISH, to the proposition that, for every set \\(S\\) of an\nappropriate sort, some pointwise property of the form \nactually holds uniformly in the form \nOur strategy for attacking this problem is two-fold. First, given a\nset \\(S\\) of the appropriate sort, we construct a ?-subset \\(N\\) of\n\\(2^*\\) such that\n \nThis, though, is only half of the solution. To prove that the\nimplication from (3) to (2) implies FT\\(_?\\), we consider a ?-subset\n\\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) and construct a corresponding set \\(S\\) such that\n \nThe canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman\n[1984], in which \\(S\\) is the set of values of a given uniformly\ncontinuous mapping \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR, T\\) is the set of\npositive real numbers, and \n\nThe pointwise property we consider is its uniform version being \nThe Julian-Richman results are as follows.\n Theorem 1: \nLet \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR\\) be uniformly continuous. Then there\nexists a detachable subset \\(B\\) of \\(2^*\\) such that Theorem 2: \nLet \\(B\\) be a detachable subset of \\(2^*\\). Then there exists a\nuniformly continuous \\(f : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\bR\\) such that \nThe proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky; see Julian &\nRichman [1984]. \nThe two Julian-Richman theorems together reveal that, relative to\nBISH, the fan theorem FT\\(_D\\) is equivalent to\nthe positivity principle, POS:\n \nEach positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \\([0,1]\\) has a\npositive infimum.\n \nIt follows that POS is derivable in INT, in which the full fan\ntheorem, not just FT\\(_D\\), is a standard\nprinciple. The situation is quiet the opposite in RUSS, where there\nexist both a detachable bar of \\(2^*\\) that is not uniform and a\npositive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \\([0,1]\\) that has\ninfimum equal to 0; see Chapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman\n[1987].\n \n\nBerger and Ishihara [2005] have taken a different, indirect route to\nestablishing the equivalence of POS and FT\\(_c\\). They\nestablish a chain of equivalences between POS,\nFT\\(_c\\), and four principles of the type “if there is\nat most one object with property \\(P\\), then there is one such\nobject”. The four unique-existence principles are: CIN!:   Each descending sequence of inhabited\nclosed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one\ncommon point has inhabited intersection (Cantor’s intersection theorem\nwith uniqueness.) Note that a subset \\(S\\) of a metric space \\((X,\\rho)\\) is located if for each \\(x\\) in \\(X\\) the infimum distance from \\(x\\) to \\(S\\) exists.\n MIN!:   Each uniformly continuous,\nreal-valued function on a compact metric space with at most one\nminimum point has a minimum point. WKL!  Each infinite tree with at most one\ninfinite branch has an infinite branch (the weak König lemma with\nuniqueness). FIX!:   Each uniformly continuous function\nfrom a compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point\nand with approximate fixed points has a fixed point. \nIn, for example, the last of these, we say that a map \\(f\\) of a\nmetric space \\((X,\\varrho)\\) into itself \nA major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan\ntheorem that is equivalent, over BISH, to the uniform continuity\ntheorem for \\([0,1]\\), \n UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\): Every pointwise continuous mapping of \\([0,1]\\) into \\(\\bR\\) is\nuniformly continuous,\n \nthe proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of\nthe fan theorem. (Note that UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\) is equivalent,\nrelative to BISH, to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric\nspaces: Every pointwise continuous mapping of a complete, totally\nbounded metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous. See, for example,\nLoeb [2005].) \nIt follows from results of Berger [2006] that\n \nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\Rightarrow\\) FT\\(_c\\).\n \nAlso, Diener and Loeb (2008) have proved that \nBISH \\(\\vdash\\) FT\\(_{\\Pi^{0}_1} \\Rightarrow\\) UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\).\n \nHowever, we do not know if either of these implications can be\nreplaced by a bi-implication. Perhaps UCT\\(_{[0,1]}\\), and hence\nthe full uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces, is\nequivalent, relative to BISH, to some natural, but as yet\nunidentified, version of the fan theorem.\n \nFor additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse\nmathematics, see, for example, Berger & Bridges [2007]; Diener [2008, 2012]; Diener & Loeb [2009]; and Diener & Lubarsky\n[2014]. In Dent [2013], there is a clear, though complex, diagram\nillustrating the interconnections between fan theorems, continuity,\nand omniscience principles (see Other Internet Resources).\n Interested readers may pursue the topic of constructive reverse\nmathematics in greater detail in the following supplementary\ndocument: \nConstructive mathematicians have tended to concentrate their efforts\non the field of analysis, with considerable success—witness the\nwealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop [1967]. This does not\nmean that, for example, algebra has been sidelined from the\nconstructive enterprise: the material in the monograph by Mines et al\n[1986] can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart to the\nconstructive analysis carried out by Bishop. Much more recently,\nLombardi and Quitté [2011] have published the first large\nvolume of a proposed two-volume work on constructive algebra. However,\nnot being expert in algebra, and being aware of the danger of making\nthis article too long to hold the reader’s attention, we choose not to\ndiscuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail; rather, in the\nfollowing supplementary document, we turn to constructive topology,\ndescribing some rather different approaches to that subject: Investigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to\na series of papers on preference,\nutility, and demand from 1982 onwards; see Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral\nthesis, Hendtlass [2013] substantially weakened the conditions for the\nexistence of a demand function; he also produced a wealth of results\nin fixed-point theory and its applications, in particular to\nconstructivisations of two classical proofs of the existence of an\neconomic equilibrium. In 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on\nconstructive mathematical finance, at\nLudwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich.They first showed that\nthe fundamental theorem on asset pricing, the separating hyperplane\ntheorem, and Markov’s Principle are constructively equivalent (Berger\n& Svindland [2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how\nto circumvent the nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value\ntheorem in order to prove the existence of extreme points for\nfunctions in the presence of even relatively weak convexity properties\n(Berger & Svindland [2016a]). Their project suggests that\nmathematical finance, like mathematical economics, may be a rich\nsource of elegant, practical constructive theorems. \n\nThe traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the\nconstructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical\nlogic; in order to avoid decisions, such as whether or not a real\nnumber equals 0, that cannot be made by a real computer, the\nmathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries\nsuch as those formed by recursive function theory. In contrast, the\nroute taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic\nlogic, which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible\ndecisions. This logic (together with an appropriate set- or\ntype-theoretic framework) suffices to keep the mathematics within\nconstructive boundaries. Thus the mathematician is free to work in the\nnatural style of an analyst, algebraist (e.g., Mines et al.\n[1988]), geometer, topologist (e.g., Bridges & Vîță\n[2011], Sambin forthcoming), or other normal mathematician, the only\nconstraints being those imposed by intuitionistic logic. As Bishop and\nothers have shown, the traditional belief promulgated by Hilbert and\nstill widely held today, that intuitionistic logic imposes such\nrestrictions as to render the development of serious mathematics\nimpossible, is patently false: large parts of deep modern mathematics\ncan be, and have been, produced by purely constructive\nmethods. Moreover, the link between constructive mathematics and\nprogramming holds great promise for the future implementation and\ndevelopment of abstract mathematics on the computer.","contact.mail":"palmgren@math.su.se","contact.domain":"math.su.se"}]
