Or, at the very least, the\nformer word is often used, without the qualifying adjective\n‘moral’, even when it is the particularly moral concept\nthat is intended. This is misleading, since impartiality in its\nbroadest sense is best understood as a formal notion, while moral\nimpartiality in particular is a substantive concept – and one\nconcerning which there is considerable dispute. This entry will be\npredominantly concerned with moral impartiality – the sort of\nimpartiality, that is, that commonly features in normative moral and\npolitical theories. However, we will begin by addressing the broader,\nformal concept, and we will end with a brief discussion of issues\nraised by epistemic, rather than moral, impartiality.\n\nIt is all too easy to assume that the word impartiality must denote a\npositive, unitary concept – presumably a concept closely linked with,\nif not identical to, morality. This, however, is simply not the case.\nRather, there are various sorts of behavior that may be described as\n‘impartial,’ and some of these obviously have little or nothing to\ndo with morality. A person who chooses an accountant on the basis of\nher friends’ recommendations may be entirely impartial between\nthe various candidates (members of the pool of local accountants) with\nrespect to their gender, their age, or where they went to school. Yet\nif her choice is motivated solely by rational self-interested\nconsiderations then it is clear that the impartiality she manifests is\nin no way a form of moral impartiality. To take a more extreme case,\nconsider an insane serial killer who chooses his victims on the basis\nof their resemblance to that some celebrity. The killer may be\nimpartial with respect to his victims’ occupations, religious\nbeliefs, and so forth, but it would be absurd to regard this as a form\nof moral impartiality. \nIt is also worth noting that some types of impartiality may in\nthemselves be immoral or morally questionable. Suppose that I decide\nto pass along a treasured family heirloom to one of my two sons, Bill\nand Phil. Flipping a coin would constitute one type of impartial\nprocedure for choosing between the two. But suppose that I have\nalready promised the heirloom to Phil on several occasions. In this\ncase it would be quite wrong to allow a coin toss to determine whether\nhe gets it. Deciding by means of a coin toss would be an impartial\nprocedure, but it would be the wrong sort of impartiality here, for it\nwould ignore the moral obligation created by my previous promises. \nThe word ‘impartiality’, then, picks out a broad concept that need\nnot have anything to do with morality. In this broad sense,\nimpartiality is probably best characterized in a negative rather than\npositive manner: an impartial choice is simply one in which a certain\nsort of consideration (i.e. some property of the individuals being\nchosen between) has no influence. An analysis along these lines has\nbeen proposed by Bernard Gert, who holds that “A is impartial\nin respect R with regard to group G if and only if\nA’s actions in respect R are not influenced at all\nby which member(s) of G benefit or are harmed by these\nactions” (Gert 1995, p.104). Thus, for Gert, impartiality is a\nproperty of a set of decisions made by a particular agent, directed\ntoward a particular group. \nGert’s analysis captures the important fact that one cannot\nsimply ask of a given agent whether or not she is impartial. Rather,\nwe must also specify with regard to whom she is impartial, and in what\nrespect. Gert’s analysis, then, permits and indeed requires that\nwe make fairly fine-grained distinctions between various sorts of\nimpartiality. This is necessary, since one and the same agent might\nmanifest various sorts of partiality and impartiality towards various\ngroups of persons. Consider, for instance, a university professor who\nis also a mother of five children, and who is currently acting as a\nmember of a hiring committee. Such an agent might be impartial between\nher children with respect to the care they receive (while preferring\nher own children over others in this respect), and also impartial\nbetween the various job candidates; but it is clear that these two\nuses of the word ‘impartial’ denote very different\npractices. In particular, the idea of merit applies in one case but\nnot the other: to be impartial between job candidates is presumably to\nselect between them on the basis of merit, whereas to be impartial\nbetween one’s children is not to think of merit at all,\nbut rather to provide equal protection and care to all. \nMany attempts to characterize impartiality fail to respect the\ndistinction between the broadest, most formalistic sense of the\nnotion, and a more specifically moral impartiality. To say, for\ninstance, that an impartial choice is one that is free of bias or\nprejudice is to presuppose that we are dealing with a certain sort of\nimpartiality, that which is required or recommended by morality, or at\nleast worthy of moral approbation. ‘Bias’ and ‘prejudice’ are\nloaded terms, suggesting not only that some consideration is being\nexcluded, but also that the exclusion is appropriate and warranted.\nSimilarly, the idea that impartiality requires that we give equal\nand/or adequate consideration to the interests of all concerned\nparties goes well beyond the requirements of the merely formal notion.\n(In the coin toss case, it is quite clear that Phil’s claims to\nthe heirloom are not being given equal or adequate consideration.) As\na characterization of moral impartiality, however, this suggestion is\nperhaps more promising, at least in some contexts. \nIt is characteristic of modern moral thought to see impartiality as a\nrequirement of, if not a fundamental component of, morality. However,\nthe precise nature of this connection remains disputed. As Brad Hooker\nhas pointed out, there are at least three levels at which assessments\nof moral impartiality may be made. First, one may ask whether moral\nrules are being impartially applied. Second, impartial benevolence may\nbe used as a direct guide to practical decisions. And third, the\ncontent of first-order moral rules may be assessed from an impartial\nstandpoint. (Hooker 2010). \nLet’s begin with the idea that to act morally is to act from the\nstandpoint of impartial benevolence. Many writers have simply assumed\nthat to assert the importance of impartiality in the context of\nmorality just is to accept the idea of acting from such a perspective.\nIt is generally agreed that some sort of close connection obtains\nbetween morality and impartiality. Indeed, the phrases ‘moral\npoint of view’ and ‘impartial (or\n‘impersonal’) point of view’ are sometimes used\ninterchangeably to refer to the imagined impersonal perspective from\nwhich, it is supposed, moral judgments are to be made (Baier 1958,\nchapter 8; Harsanyi 1982; Scheffler 1982, 1985; Smith 1976 [1759];\nWolf 1992; see also Blum 1980, Chapter 3). As noted above, however,\nthe word ‘impartial’ is a general term with many\nparticular species; it follows that the phrase ‘impartial point\nof view’ is itself ambiguous. At most, it might be that the\nmoral point of view constitutes one sort of impartial point of\nview. \nIt is not clear, however, that the demands of impartial benevolence\nare sufficient to exhaust those of morality. Treating a person\nappropriately and respectfully may well require certain sorts of\nemotional and/or cognitive responses: sensitivity to her needs and\nvalues, empathy for her suffering, and the like. But if these\nresponses are pictured as the results of positive traits or\nattributes (and not simply as, say, the result of a lack of bias or\nprejudice), then it is not clear that merely being impartial between\npersons is sufficient to guarantee that one will possess and display\nthe necessary sensitivities. Indeed, characterizations of impartial\nagents which proceed in negative terms (that is, by defining various\npreferences, emotions or bits of information that she does not possess\nor that do not move her) often risk picturing the impartial agent as\nimpersonal and even indifferent (Henberg 1978; Brandt 1954). \nA second problem for the claim that the moral point of view is\nidentical with (some version of) the impartial point of view – or\nindeed, for any view which identifies morality and impartiality in the\ndirect sense – is that it seems plausible to regard some forms of\nmoral partiality as morally admirable, and perhaps even morally\nrequired (Blum 1980; Cottingham 1983, 1986, 1996; Jeske & Fumerton\n1997; Jollimore 2001; Kapur 1991; Kekes 1981; Keller 2013; MacIntyre\n1984; Oldenquist 1982). Loyalty to one’s family, community or\ncountry, for instance, is commonly regarded as a virtue. Yet such an\nattitude is a clear and indeed paradigmatic example of partiality,\nrequiring that an agent feel and act differently toward one set of\npersons than she does toward humanity in general. Similarly, certain\nspecific moral duties arising from certain particular relationships\nseem to involve partiality in an irreducible manner. Parents, for\nexample, are thought to be morally obliged to take special care of\ntheir own children; to regard one’s child as merely one among\nmillions would be regarded as highly eccentric if not monstrous. Of\ncourse, some moral duties do require that an agent be impartial in\nperforming them. But on common sense moral views at least,\nimpartiality seems mostly to be required in the context of specific\nroles – such as when a person is acting as a judge, an umpire, a\njournalist, or a representative of some public institution; or,\nperhaps, when we are evaluating and selecting first-order moral rules.\n(Baron 1991; Blum 1980; Cottingham 1983). The idea that impartiality\nis a pervasive and universal moral requirement that should be directly\nmanifested in our thoughts and practices during daily life seems to\ncontradict our ordinary moral intuitions. \nWhether there exists such a thing as morally admirable partiality is\nthe main issue that separates the so-called partialists from\nthe impartialists. Partialists, in general, tend to claim\nthat morally admirable partiality does exist, that it cannot be\nreduced to any form of impartiality at a more fundamental level, and\nthat these facts pose a serious problem for those who claim that\nmorality and (some form of) impartiality are identical, or even\nclosely related. Impartialists, by contrast, either deny the existence\nof morally admirable partiality altogether, or hold that any apparent\ncases are in fact ultimately reducible to impartial standards (see\nsection 6). Thus impartialists hold that – contrary, perhaps, to\nappearances – impartiality is, indeed, a pervasive and universal\nrequirement of morality. \nRather than being put in terms of an impartial point of view, the\nrelation between morality and impartiality is sometimes made out in\nterms of an impartial agent or observer – a person who makes moral\njudgments without being influenced by the sort of contaminating biases\nor prejudices that tend to arise from the occupation of some\nparticular point of view. (Smith 1976 [1759]; Hume 1978 [1740]; Firth\n1952; Brandt 1954; Hare 1989.) The observer may also be defined as\n‘ideal’ in various other ways. It is generally stipulated that she\nis in possession of all the nonmoral facts that are relevant to the\njudgments she has to make (Firth 1952). It is also fairly common to\nassume that she is an ideal reasoner, and thus immune to logical\nfallacy or mistaken inference, etc. (Indeed, Hare goes so far as to\nstate that his ‘archangel’ possesses “superhuman powers of\nthought, superhuman knowledge and no human weaknesses” (Hare 1989,\np. 44).) The ‘ideal observer theory’ of morality, in its most\nstraightforward form, states that moral judgments simply are the\njudgments an ideal observer of this sort will make. \nAny advantage it has over the conception of morality as an impartial\npoint of view presumably arises from the fact that the ideal observer\nis not completely defined in terms of impartiality. (If she were, the\ntwo conceptions would simply coincide.) Yet many ideal observer\ntheorists seem to accept a characterization of the ideal observer\nwhich concentrates on her impartiality and impersonality. Firth, for\nexample, suggests that the ideal observer is both\n‘distinterested,’ in the strong sense of being ‘entirely lacking\nin particular interests,’ and ‘dispassionate,’ in that she is\n‘incapable of experiencing any emotions at all.’ (Firth, 1952)\nDefined in this way, however, the ideal observer sounds not only\nimpersonal but deeply indifferent; and the idea that the moral\njudgments of a person who had neither emotional responses nor\nparticular interests could be trusted, let alone that they might be\nconsidered definitive of morality, strikes some critics as highly\nimplausible (Brandt 1979). \nSuppose, then, that the ideal observer theorist decides that the\ndefinition of the ideal observer must include more than the\nbare idea of impartiality – that in addition the observer must\nbe, say, compassionate (and thus not indifferent); and that she must\npossess a considerable facility for proper moral judgments –\npractical wisdom, in the Aristotelian sense. Such a theorist will now\nface a different problem: the more we build into the definition of our\nideal observer, the less useful it becomes as a heuristic device.\nStipulating that the ideal observer is very wise, for example, is not\nvery helpful if we ourselves are not wise, and so have no idea what an\nideally wise observer would choose. Indeed, ideal observer analyses\nthat go too far in this direction seem to become circular – the\n‘ideal’ observer is ideal because she always makes proper\njudgments, those being defined as just those judgments the ideal\nobserver would make (Broad 1959, p. 263). A circularity of this sort\nseems to be present in John Stuart Mill’s claim: \nThe ideal observer, then, to be useful, must be given some independent\ndefinition, and not simply defined as ‘an agent who always gets it\nright.’ The challenge is to find such a definition. Here, as with\nthe conception of morality as defined by an impartial point of view,\nthe phenomenon of morally admirable partiality proves a particularly\ndifficult issue. Should we define the ideal observer as being loyal to\nher country, or as being above loyalty? If the former, can she serve\nas an adequate moral example to people who do not share her\nallegiances? If the latter, how can she serve as an adequate example\nto anyone? Any process of idealization of the sort required to make\nsuch a conception work seems likely to result in an individual so\nremoved from the concrete lives and concerns of actual human moral\nagents, that her moral judgments will turn out to be in large part\nirrelevant to the question of how such agents ought to live (see\nWalker 1991). \nThe plausibility of identifying the moral point of view with the\nimpartial point of view, or of defining morality in terms of an\nimpartial observer, presumably lies in the thought that such views\ncapture the idea that morally speaking, every person is equally\nimportant. Whatever such conceptions may get wrong, then, one thing\nthey seem to get right is the idea that there is a close and important\nconnection between moral impartiality and equality (see especially\nNagel 1991, Chapter 7). \nSome clarification, however, is required. To say that from the\nimpartial point of view, no one is seen as intrinsically more\nsignificant than anyone else, is not to say that there is no reason\nwhatsoever for which a person might demand more moral attention or\nbetter treatment than others. Many moral theorists, after all, will\nsuppose that from the impartial point of view, properly conceived,\nsome individuals will count as more significant, at least in certain\nways. William Godwin (Godwin 1793) provides an influential and\ninfamous example. Fenelon, the archbishop of Cambrai, Godwin writes,\nmay be supposed to be more significant than a mere chambermaid; so in\nan emergency (Godwin imagines a building on fire) the archbishop ought\nto be rescued first. The reason, however, is not that the archbishop\nis intrinsically more significant; rather, the claim is grounded on\nthe fact that the archbishop makes greater contributions to society:\n \nThus, viewing persons from an impartial point of view need not imply\nthat we view them equally, in every sense of the word; and it\ncertainly does not imply that everyone must receive equal\ntreatment. (In Godwin’s Archbishop Fenelon case, if we\nassume that only one person can be saved, the only way to give the\narchbishop and the chambermaid equal treatment would be to let them\nboth perish in the flames.) What impartiality seems to require is not\nthat everyone receive equal treatment, but rather that everyone be\ntreated as an equal (Dworkin 1977, p. 227). While the\ndistinction between equal treatment and treatment as equals is\ndifficult to make out with precision, the main idea is fairly clear:\ntreatment as equals requires that persons are not treated\nequally, but rather treated in accordance with what rights they\npossess, what legitimate claims they put forward, and, in general,\nwith what they deserve. Thus, to inflict a one year jail sentence on\nall accused persons, regardless of whether they are guilty or\ninnocent, is to provide equal treatment to members of that group; but\nit is not to treat them as equals. \nOf course, since his thought experiment concerns an unusual emergency\ncase, it might be suggested that, since we are not frequently faced\nwith the choice of who to pull from a burning building, Godwin’s\nposition, as radical as it is, has few implications for everyday moral\ndecision-making. But as Singer (1972) has argued, those of us who live\nin economically privileged countries can, by choosing to donate some\nof our incomes to charity, prevent people elsewhere on the planet from\ndying of hunger, easily preventable diseases, etc.; and this seems to\nimply that we are always in the situation of choosing who lives and\nwho dies – whether or not we explicitly acknowledge the fact. (See\nalso Unger 1996 and Singer 2009.)  \n\nSinger’s work has given rise to the movement popularly known as\n‘effective altruism,’ composed of people who attempt to\ndedicate their lives to doing as much practical good as possible.  One\npopular strategy is to donate as much as possible to those charitable\norganizations judged to be most effective. Such views, like\nGodwin’s, adhere to the view that we owe as much moral attention\nand effort to those who are distant and unrelated to us as to our\nneighbors, close friends, and even family.  \nMany have resisted the extreme position defended by Godwin, Singer,\netc. If nothing else, such positions are quite clearly incompatible\nwith the apparent existence of morally admirable partiality. (Williams\n(1981) holds that even to consider sacrificing one’s wife for\nthe sake of impersonal justice constitutes a kind of moral error in\nits own right.) Moreover, despite the fact that the ultimate\nevaluation is made on the grounds of perfectly general properties, it\nis not entirely clear that the objects of the evaluation really are\nbeing treated as equals, in the relevant sense – the fact that the\nchambermaid’s life is to be sacrificed for the overall good at\nleast suggests that her standing as a moral being is not really being\ntaken into account, and that the suggested understanding of moral\nimpartiality is therefore deficient. \nIndeed, John Taurek (1977) has famously argued that the various goods\nof individual persons cannot be added up to a total ‘overall’ good\nin any meaningful sense, and that the traditional consequentialist\nconception of right action as maximizing the overall good is\nincoherent; indeed, Taurek claims, such decision-making actually fail\nto show equal respect for all persons concerned. (Taurek’s\ndenial that one can aggregate various individual goods can be regarded\nas a strong version of the Rawlsian claim that morality must respect a\n‘distinction between persons.’) Suppose a lifeguard must choose\nbetween saving one drowning person or saving five; whomever she\nchooses not to save will drown, and she cannot save both groups. Most\nconsequentialists (and many others) would take it as obvious that, at\nleast in the absence of very special circumstances (the solitary\ndrowner’s being the potential author of Telemachus, for\ninstance) the five should be saved rather than the one. But to assume\nthis, Taurek argues, would be to fail to show the one the same respect\none shows the five: after all, this response leaves the single victim\nno chance at all of being rescued. Taurek’s controversial\nsuggestion is that the lifeguard would show equal respect by flipping\na coin, as this would offer every person involved an equal chance\n(fifty percent) of being rescued. Not surprisingly, Taurek’s\nargument has engendered a substantial amount of discussion and\ncriticism (see for instance Kamm 1993 Chapters 5 & 6, Kavka 1979,\nOtsuka 2000, Parfit 1978.)  \nConsequentialist moral theories hold that moral evaluations and\njustifications must ultimately be grounded in the value of the\nconsequences of the actions, rules, policies, strategies, character\ntraits, etc. that are being evaluated (Hooker 1994). That is, the\nultimate question to be asked of any action, rule, or character trait\nunder evaluation is, “Does it [the action, rule, or trait in\nquestion] promote the good?” For the purposes of this entry, three\nimportant assumptions will be made regarding consequentialist\ntheories. First, consequentialist theories will be assumed to hold\nthat the overall values of sets of consequences can be determined, and\nthus ranked, independently of the identity of any particular agent.\nSecond, such theories will be assumed to hold that the impersonal good\nis largely if not entirely composed of the interests of individual\npersons, and that the interests of each person count for just as much\nas those of every other person. Finally, it will be assumed that we\nare dealing with act consequentialist theories – theories, that is,\nwhich hold that the consequentialist standard is to be applied\ndirectly to the actions of agents, and that what is required is that\nevery action (or overall pattern of action) maximize the impersonal\ngood. Such a theory, then, requires that every agent always choose an\naction that will bring about consequences at least as good as those\nthat would be brought about by any other available action.  \nIn so characterizing consequentialism I am defining it as operating on\nthe second level identified by Brad Hooker in (Hooker, 2010): the\nlevel, that is, of direct action. One might instead adhere to a theory\naccording to which first-order moral rules should be chosen in\naccordance with their tendency to promote the overall good,\nimpartially conceived. Such theories typically go by the name\n‘rule consequentialism’, though there has been some debate\nas to whether they constitute genuinely consequentialist theories at\nall (Howard-Snyder 1993). For the purposes of understanding\nimpartiality, at any rate, it is most useful to group rule\nconsequentialist theories not with act consequentialist theories but\nwith deontological theories, which are more similar in terms of their\nunderlying normative structure.  \nAs we are understanding it, then, consequentialism seems to place each\nagent under a pervasive obligation to be strictly impartial between\nall persons, by requiring her always to exclude from her practical\ndeliberations (almost) all considerations that do not bear directly on\nthe ways in which people’s interests might be advanced or\ninjured by her actions. \nThe consequentialist standard, then, is strictly impartial in a very\ndirect manner and in a very rigorous sense. A consequentialist agent\nis not permitted to prefer herself, nor any of her loved ones, in\nchoosing a distribution of benefits and burdens. She may not accept a\npleasure for herself if doing so involves passing up the opportunity\nto bring about a slightly larger pleasure for a stranger. Nor is she\npermitted to feed her own children if she could do more good by\nfeeding hungrier strangers instead. She must sacrifice the life of a\nspouse, parent or child if, by doing so, she would save more lives, or\neven (as in Godwin’s Archbishop Fenelon case) save the life of one\nother person whose contribution to the overall good would be greater\nthan that of the person sacrificed. It is for reasons such as this\nthat consequentialist impartiality is accused of being too demanding.\nBy refusing to allow the agent’s personal concerns to play a\nspecial role in her practical deliberations, it is claimed,\nconsequentialism threatens her integrity and alienates her from\nherself and others (Kapur 1991, Scheffler 1982, Stocker 1976, Williams\n1973, 1981). As Brian Barry has written, the effect of\nconsequentialist impartiality “is, in effect, to extend to the whole\nof conduct the requirements of impartiality that on the common-sense\nview are restricted to judges and bureaucrats acting in their official\ncapacities.” (Barry 1995, p. 23)  \nThe fact that consequentialist impartiality turns out to have such\nstrict and demanding implications is, for the consequentialist, a\ndouble-edged sword. On the plausible and popular assumption that a\nmoral theory must be deeply impartial, consequentialism meets this\ncriterion with flying colors. And consequentialists have typically\nbeen adept at exploiting this fact with powerful rhetoric\n(Godwin’s famous query, ‘what magic is there in the pronoun\n‘my’?’ being a noteworthy example.) On the other hand, the\nimpartial demands of consequentialism are so strict and so extreme\nthat many critics have found them unacceptable: consequentialism, they\nclaim, simply demands too much and must therefore be rejected\n(Scheffler 1982, Slote 1985, Williams 1981). \nEssentially, this worry is a version of what we referred to above as\nthe problem of morally admirable partiality. The common-sense view is\nthat it is permissible for an agent to be partial toward herself; that\nis, to treat her own projects and concerns as if they had special\nsignificance (Scheffler, 1982). (From her point of view, of course,\nthey do have special significance.) This sort of self-concern, then,\nconstitutes a form of partiality which seems, from the vantage point\nof common sense, to be morally endorsed. Similarly, certain sorts of\npartiality directed toward other people – friends, family members,\nand the like – are also forbidden by consequentialist impartiality,\nbut regarded as justifiable, and in many cases admirable, from the\nstandpoint of common sense (Blum 1980, Cottingham 1983, Kekes 1981,\nKeller 2013, Slote 1985). \nDefenders of consequentialism generally respond in one of three ways.\nFirst, a consequentialist might argue that any genuinely\nimpartial moral theory will make extreme demands of agents. Second,\nthey might argue that the view that consequentialism is excessively\ndemanding depends on a false theory of practical reasoning, which\naccords too much significance to morality. Third, they might argue\nthat in fact, the demands of consequentialism are not as extreme as\nhave been supposed. \nThe first strategy faces a severe difficulty: namely, it at least\nseems to be the case that certain non-consequentialist moral theories\n– in particular, deontological theories – also incorporate impartial\nelements in a fundamental manner, and yet make demands on the moral\nagent which are considerably less extreme than those of\nconsequentialism. Thus, while some consequentialists (e.g. Brink 1989)\nhave argued that the truth of consequentialism can be logically\nderived more or less directly from the requirement that morality be\nimpartial, this seems to be a mistake (Scheffler 1992, pp. 105-109).\nOf course, it is open to the consequentialist either to deny that\ndeontological moral theories are genuinely impartial (Kagan 1989;\nScheffler 1982, 1985), or to argue that, properly understood, any\nplausible ethical theory will be seen to make demands comparable to\nthose made by consequentialism (Brink 1989, Ashford 2000). Both of\nthese strategies, however, face difficulties; as we will see in\nsection 4, there is in fact a very strong case in favor of viewing at\nleast some deontological theories as genuinely and fundamentally\nimpartial – a case which nevertheless does not prohibit us from\nviewing such theories as less demanding than their consequentialist\nrivals. \nThe second strategy is to argue that those who object to\nconsequentialism on the grounds that it is too demanding are placing\ntoo much importance on the role of morality in practical reasoning\n(Brink 1989; Wolf 1982, 1992). If moral considerations dominated\npractical reasoning – if, that is, they were the only or at any rate\nby far the most significant considerations in determining our actions\n– then consequentialism would be untenable, on account of its\ndemanding too much. But when put in their proper place then in the\nlarger scheme of practical reasons and requirements, the extreme\ndemands of consequentialist morality will no longer seem threatening.\nTo borrow a pair of phrases from David Brink, what appear to be\n‘moral worries’ about the tendency of consequentialism to make\nexcessive moral demands, might really be ‘worries about morality’\n– worries, that is, about whether or not we have reason to act as\nmorality requires. Whether the view of morality presupposed by this\nstrategy is true, however, is questionable; at the very least, it does\nnot seem to be the case that the majority of those who have defended\nconsequentialism as a normative theory of ethics have intended it to\nbe viewed as a theory that could be frequently or easily overridden or\nignored (see Railton 1984, Miller 1992 Chapter 10, Jollimore 2001\nChapter 3). \nThe third strategy is perhaps the best known and most frequently\nemployed. It is argued that, given a reasonable and accurate view of\nhuman nature and the abilities of agents, it will be seen that what\nconsequentialism requires is not a radically different sort\nof life from the one most of us currently live; rather,\nconsequentialism will require (in most cases, at least) only\nreasonable, and relatively minor, adjustments in our current\nlifestyles. In particular, it is argued that consequentialism permits\nthe agent both to give preference to her own projects and concerns,\nand to favor particular other individuals (friends, family members,\netc.), and that all this is consistent with the agent’s having\nas her overriding project the maximizing of the good. The locus\nclassicus of this argument is found in Mill’s\nUtilitarianism: \nEven Godwin (1801 [1968]) endorses a version of this argument, writing\nthat \n(This position, it will be noted, appears to be in some amount of\ntension with the more extreme consequentialist position attributed to\nGodwin in section 2.3).  \nMore recent versions of this argument follow Mill’s basic\nstrategy. Peter Railton (1984) argues that a ‘sophisticated’\nconsequentialist will develop patterns of decision-making that do not,\nexcept on rare occasions, refer explicitly to consequentialist aims\nand goals, and that both the psychology and the outward behavior of\nsuch an individual will be similar to that of the typical\nnon-consequentialist. Similarly, Frank Jackson (1991) argues that the\nmost efficient strategy for a dedicated consequentialist is to\nconcentrate on small groups of particular persons, rather than trying\nto promote the well-being of humanity at large, and that this will\ninvolve the formation of close personal relationships with other\nindividuals. Others who have deployed versions of this argument\ninclude Bales (1971), Brink (1989), and Pettit & Brennan\n(1986). \nThe evaluation of this consequentialist strategy is a difficult issue.\nConsequentialists are surely correct to point out that obsessive\nconsequentialist strategizing is likely, at a certain point, to turn\ncounter-productive, and that a consequentialist agent is therefore\nwell-advised to develop more moderate approaches. On the other hand,\nMill and many other consequentialists seem to underestimate the amount\nof good that a dedicated consequentialist agent might be able to\ncontribute, and thus, to underestimate the amount of good that she\nwill be required to contribute. Moreover, our powers to influence the\nlives of strangers have increased considerably since Mill’s day.\nAs Susan Wolf writes, “[T]his argument is simply unconvincing in\nlight of the empirical circumstances of our world. The gain in\nhappiness that would accrue to oneself and one’s neighbors by a\nmore well-rounded, richer life than that of the moral saint would be\npathetically small in comparison to the amount by which one could\nincrease the general happiness if one devoted oneself explicitly to\nthe care of the sick, the downtrodden, the starving, and the\nhomeless” (Wolf 1982, p. 428; see also Singer 1972). This thought is\nborne out by the empirical facts. If we look at the lives of actual\n‘effective altruists,’ who are motivated by a commitment to make\nas great a contribution to general well-being as possible, we find\nthat such people have indeed found it necessary to transform their\nlives in fairly radical ways and to make large sacrifices in terms of\ntime, money, and comfort, and often in terms of relationships and\npersonal happiness (see examples in MacFarquhar 2015). \nMoreover, even if a theory such as Railton’s sophisticated\nconsequentialism can allow a sophisticated consequentialist agent to\nsometimes knowingly bring about less than maximally good consequences,\nsuch a theory must nonetheless insist that each particular act of\ndoing so is indeed morally wrong – an insistence which seems contrary\nto our moral intuitions (Jollimore 2001). It is not clear, then, that\nan appeal to the limits of human powers can succeed in converting what\nis a fundamentally radical moral theory into a comfortably\nconservative one. \nIn addition to claiming that consequentialist impartiality is too\ndemanding, many critics have also argued that it is too permissive.\nSince consequentialism makes the permissibility of an action entirely\ndependent on the value of that action’s consequences, it follows\nthat there is no type of action that can be prohibited on\nconsequentialist grounds (except, of course, for that\n‘type’ which is defined explicitly in terms of sub-optimal\nconsequences.) Thus instances of torture, premeditated murder, rape,\nand other violations of fundamental human rights are at least\npotentially justifiable on a consequentialist basis; no such action\ncan be ruled out, morally speaking, until the comparative value of the\nstate of affairs it will bring about has been determined. \nThe effect of this complaint, like the previous one, is not to deny\nthe claim that consequentialism is a deeply impartial moral theory,\nbut rather to suggest that it incorporates the wrong sort of\nimpartiality. Suppose, to take an example common in the literature,\nthat consequentialism recommends that an man be convicted of, and\npunished for, a crime he did not commit, in order to prevent the\npublic from rioting (Nielsen 1972). Such an action would, according to\ncommon intuitions, constitute a gross violation of justice; and it\nseems a weak reply to point out that the recommendation was arrived at\nthrough an impartial calculation – a calculation that took the\ninterests of every individual (including the framed man) into equal\naccount. For while the claim is, strictly speaking, true, there is\nnevertheless a clear and compelling case in favor of concluding that\nthe framed man was not treated impartially, in the sense that\nought to matter here. We expect a judicial system to allocate\npunishments in accordance with degree of guilt, not in accordance with\nthe expected value to society of the consequences in each case; and\nthe fact that both methods constitute forms of impartial\ndecision-making does not imply that they are equally morally\nacceptable. \nAgain, the classic response to this objection dates back to\nMill’s Utilitarianism (1992 [1861]). If institutions of justice\nare to be given a general justification, Mill argues, this\njustification must find its ultimate grounding in utility to society;\nfor what else could explain why justice is valued at all, other than\nthe fact that it serves and protects our interests? But since a\njustice system will only succeed in this role if it is governed by\ncommon principles of justice – principles including, for instance,\nthat only the guilty should be punished, and that the punishment ought\nto be proportional to the crime – it follows that such principles are\nnot opposed to consequentialism at all. Rather, at the deepest\njustificatory level, consequentialism and the demands of justice\ncoincide. (See also Neilsen 1972)  \nThe claim that such a coincidence generally obtains is probably easy\nto establish. The challenge for Mill, and for other consequentialists,\narises in those particular cases in which the coincidence fails.\nAssuming that the possibility of such cases does not move one to\nsimply abandon consequentialism in favor of some more justice-friendly\nconception (such as the rule consequentialism Mill himself sometimes\nseems to find attractive), there are two general defense strategies\nfor consequentialists to employ. The first strategy argues that there\nare good consequentialist reasons for being the sort of agent who\nrespects the dictates of justice even in cases in which the\ncoincidence between the demands of justice and those of\nconsequentialism fails (Pettit 1997; cf. Railton 1986). The second\nstrategy admits that there are cases in which unjust actions can be\ngiven a consequentialist justification, but holds that when so much as\nit stake, justice must give way to consequentialism’s demands\n(Smart 1973; Kagan 1989; Pettit 1997). Whether either approach is\nsufficient, given the apparent depth and force of our common\nintuitions about the requirements of justice, is a matter of ongoing\ndebate. \nIn section 3.2 we noted that while consequentialist impartiality is\none possible interpretation of the demand that morality be impartial,\nit is not by any means the only available interpretation; nor is it\nclearly the most plausible. The considerations related to justice\ndiscussed in section 3.3 may help us to appreciate this. For consider\nonce more the position of the framed innocent, whose fundamental\ninterests have been sacrificed for the sake of the greater good. Such\na person may well complain that he has not been treated\nimpartially, in the appropriate sense; for, while it is true that his\ninterests were counted in determining the nature of the overall good,\nit is nevertheless also true that ultimately, he became the victim of\na form of abuse that was both harsh and undeserved. The framed\ninnocent might also back up his complaint by making the plausible\nclaim that, had he been in a position to choose, he would never have\nconsented to a moral system that allowed anyone to be\naccorded such treatment. Thus, while there is a sense in which his\ninterests were counted equally, there is another and very important\nsense in which his interests – and perhaps more importantly, his\nclaims and rights – do not seem to have received full or\nadequate consideration at all. \nMany deontologists insist that consequentialism errs by failing to\naccord proper significance to the moral agent as an individual; in\nJohn Rawls’ words, consequentialism “does not take\nseriously the distinction between persons” (Rawls 1971, section\n5). (Rawls has utilitarianism in particular as his target, but the\npoint applies more widely.) Similarly, Samuel Scheffler has suggested\nthat “for human beings as creatures with values, the normative\nforce of certain forms of partiality is nearly unavoidable. If that is\nright, then for morality to reject partiality in a general or\nsystematic way would be for it to set itself against our nature as\nvaluing creatures. And that, I believe, would make morality an\nincoherent enterprise” (Scheffler 2010).) \nThus, the fact that consequentialist impartiality makes extraordinary\nand, to many, unreasonable demands on the individual (section 3.2)\nmight be taken to indicate that consequentialism fails to take\nindividuals seriously as agents. At the same time, the fact\nthat consequentialist impartiality permits the individual to be used\nas a mere means when doing so promotes the greater good (section\n3.3)might indicate that consequentialism fails to take individuals\nseriously as patients. The conception of impartiality that\ntends to be favored by deontologists avoids such implications by\nrefusing to view impartial action simply as a matter of maximizing\ninterests (or some other version of the impersonally determined good.)\nIndeed, deontologists take the right rather than the\ngood to be fundamental to ethics, and tend to see moral action in\nterms of acting in accordance with principles that are rationally\nacceptable to all. \nExactly what these principles are, and exactly what method should be\nused to determine them, are matters of some disagreement among\ndeontological theorists. But there does seem to be a general consensus\namong deontologists that moral impartiality does not require\nthat an agent be strictly neutral between her own good and the good of\nother people in ordinary decision-making contexts. Rather, an agent is\npermitted on deontological views to give special attention to her own\nprojects and interests. An important distinction can be drawn here\nbetween first-order and second-order impartiality (Barry 1995; see\nalso Hooker 2010). First-order impartiality is that displayed by an\nagent in ordinary choice situations – choosing how to spend\none’s day, who to spend time with, and so forth. Second-order\nimpartiality, by contrast, operates only in a certain, special sort of\ncontext: contexts in which the rules, principles and institutions\nwhich govern first-order behavior are evaluated and selected. Thus a\nmoral rule granting individuals complete freedom of association, and\nthus allowing them to display first-order partiality by spending time\nwith whomever they please regardless of whether doing so promotes the\ngreater social good in any particular case, might be given a\nsecond-order impartialist justification by demonstrating that such a\nrule would promote the impersonal good, or that it would be selected\nby a group of impartial persons who were choosing the moral rules that\nwere to govern society. \nThe fact that deontological theories generally permit (some degree of)\nfirst-order partiality – that is, that agents are permitted to\npay special attention to their own interests, projects, and loved ones\n– should not, then, be taken to imply either that the\nagent’s interests are objectively more valuable than\nthose of other persons, or that the agent is justified in viewing them\nas such. Rather, the deontologist will claim, it reflects the fact\nthat it is morally legitimate (perhaps, again, because justifiable in\nsecond-order impartialist terms) for an agent to regard her own goals\nand interests as especially important to her. Thus,\ndeontological moral systems tend to incorporate an irreducible element\nof agent-relativity of a sort that consequentialist theories cannot\nembody (Nagel 1986; McNaughton & Rawling 1992, 1993, 1998;\nJollimore 2001; Kamm 2007 ). \nThe incorporation of agent-relativity of this sort into deontological\ntheories allows such theories to escape the most straightforward\nversions of the claim that they demand too much of moral agents.\nNevertheless, various versions of that objection have been leveled\nagainst deontological theories. It has been claimed, for instance,\nthat Kantianism, by insisting that only actions performed out of the\nmotive of duty have moral worth, delegitimizes or even forbids the\ntype of motives which typically (and perhaps necessarily) operate in\nthe context of close personal relationships (Stocker 1976; Williams;\n1981). Typically, Kantians have responded by distancing themselves\nfrom the view that only actions motivated by duty have value,\nand acknowledging instead that a commitment to duty need only function\nas a limiting condition, rather than as the primary source of\nmotivation in all cases (Baron 1995). The Kantian account of moral\nvalue, of course, is not essential to deontological theories; and\nthose theories which eschew it may well be able to avoid the\ndemandingness objection altogether. \nOn many deontological views, particularly Kantian ones, the\nsignificance of moral impartiality is seen as arising from the fact\nthat a core role is given to the concept of universalizability (Gert\n1998; Hare 1981; Kant 1964 [1785]; Kohlberg 1979). The requirement\nthat moral judgments be universalizable is, roughly, the requirement\nthat such judgments be independent of any particular point of view.\nThus, an agent who judges that A ought morally to do\nX in situation S ought to be willing to endorse the\nsame judgment whether she herself happens to be A, or some\nother individual involved in the situation (someone who, perhaps, will\nbe directly affected by A’s actions), or an entirely\nneutral observer. Her particular identity is completely irrelevant in\nthe determination of the correctness or appropriateness of the\njudgment. \nUniversalizability, thus formulated, does imply at least one sort of\nimpartiality: an agent whose judgments are universalizable will be\nmorally consistent, in the sense that she will judge her own actions\nby the same standards she applies to others. Such an agent will not\nmake an exception of herself by allowing herself to break a rule she\nregards as binding for others, or to perform any other action which\nshe would not accept if performed by another agent. Impartiality of\nthis sort, however, does not necessarily imply any sort of\nimpartiality with respect to other individuals’ interests,\nrights, or claims. On a minimally demanding interpretation of the\nuniversalizability requirement, the judgments made by a person whose\nconception of the good was intrinsically racist – that is, a\nperson who held that the well-being of members of some one particular\nrace mattered more (or less), objectively speaking, than the\nwell-being of members of other races – could very well turn out\nto be universalizable, so long as the racist held that his judgments\nwere objectively correct, and so ought to be assented to by all\nindividuals – including those individuals who would be\ndisadvantaged by the general adoption of those views (cf. Gewirth\n1978, p. 164; Gert 1998, Chapter 6; Wiggins 1978; Williams 1985, p.\n115). \nHowever, the conclusion that the racist’s judgments are\nuniversalizable presupposes a very minimal account of what\nuniversalizability requires. On this account, it requires only that an\nagent be sincerely committed to the objectivity of his judgments, in\nthe sense that he views them (from his current perspective) as correct\nfrom all perspectives, and thus as calling for everyone’s assent\n(whether or not that assent is actually given.) There are two ways of\nmaking the universalizability requirement more demanding. The first is\nto appeal to certain counterfactual claims about what the agent\nwould endorse if he actually did occupy various\nperspectives. On this view, a particular judgment by A is\nuniversalizable if and only if A endorses that judgment from\nhis current perspective, and would endorse the same judgment from\nany other perspective. Given this understanding of\nuniversalizability, it is much less likely – indeed,\nextraordinarily unlikely – that racist views will turn out to be\nuniversalizable; for it is not generally true of individuals that they\nwould endorse the view “The well-being of members of race\nR matters less than the well-being of members of other\nraces” if they themselves were members of race R.\nHowever, such a view may well require too much, for there are few if\nany moral judgments or principles that would be endorsed from\nevery perspective any given agent might occupy. \nA different approach to universalizability eschews the appeal to\npsychological facts altogether, and holds that whether or not a\nparticular judgment is universalizable is a logical fact rather than a\npsychological one. Kant’s categorical imperative test, for\nexample, holds that universalizability is the distinguishing feature\nof correct moral judgments, and that a judgment is universalizable if\nand only if it can, without contradiction, be willed as a universal\npractical law (Kant 1964 [1785]). Since the test hinges on whether the\nwilling of a judgment as a universal law results in a\ncontradiction, it follows that whether or not a judgment\nis universalizable in this way is a matter of practical\nreason, and does not depend on which particular individual’s\nwill happens to be involved. \nThe types of impartiality implied by both of these more demanding\nversions of the universalizability requirement are likely to be\nconsiderably more substantial than the formal consistency required by\nthe minimal version. Kant, for instance, seems to hold that\nuniversalizability implies a certain level of altruism or charity, in\nthe form of the imperfect duties we owe towards other individuals.\nThere are problems, however, with Kant’s argument for this. In\nparticular, it is not clear just how the universal willing of a maxim\nsuch as “When others are in need of help, I always ignore their\nneeds” give rise to any sort of contradiction. It is\ntrue, of course, that, were we actually in a position to choose the\nuniversal maxims on which all rational persons would act, this would\nbe a poor choice, for we might someday be in need of assistance from\nanother. But to say that the willing of this maxim as a universal law\nwould be imprudent is not to say that doing so is\ncontradictory. Moreover, as David Wiggins (1978) points out,\ncertain other actions that seem as if they ought to be morally\npermissible – the act, for instance, of releasing a debtor from\nhis debt out of generosity – have maxims that seem to fail the\nuniversalizability test so conceived. These examples may point to a\ngeneral problem with the attempt to derive impartiality from\nuniversalizability: whereas the latter, at least on a Kantian\ninterpretation, is a formal property of moral judgments, moral\nimpartiality, as we have seen, is a substantive rather than a formal\nconcept. (See Herman 1993 and Korsgaard 1996 for attempts to respond\nto these problems.) \nIt should be mentioned that some moral theorists have attempted to\nderive various versions of consequentialist impartiality more or less\ndirectly from the universalizability requirement (Hare 1981, Pettit\n2000; see also Harsanyi 1982). However, the claim that a conception of\nimpartiality that is not only substantive but also extraordinarily\ndemanding can be derived from a requirement which, as just pointed\nout, is essentially a formal one, continues to strike a majority of\nmoral philosophers as dubious. \nThe requirement that moral judgements be universalizable seems to\nreflect two fundamental moral insights: first, that morality is\nobjective, and not simply a matter of personal opinion or expression\nof interest and desire; and second, that from the standpoint of\nmorality, each person matters just as much as, and no more than, any\nother person. The contractualist approach to moral theorizing\nprovides one method of giving expression to these fundamental ideas\nabout morality. \nContractualism borrows from the social contract tradition the idea\nthat morality may be viewed as the result of an agreement between\nthose who are to be bound by its dictates. Two variants of this\napproach can be distinguished. The former, sometimes referred to as\ncontractarianism, identifies the participants in the\nbargaining process with actual individuals, and thus is broadly\nhistorical. The latter approach, by contrast, appeals to what agents\nwould choose under various, quite possibly unrealizable\nconditions, and is thus hypothetical rather than historical.\nIt is the latter approach that will concern us here. \nThe hypothetical contractualist model, then, regards moral principles\nas the result of a bargaining process among a group of agents, subject\nto certain restrictions that are specified so as to guarantee that the\nchosen principles will meet the demands of second-order impartiality.\nThe most famous example of this approach is John Rawls’\n‘veil of ignorance’, as described in (Rawls 1971).\nAccording to Rawls, the principles of a just society are those that\nwould be chosen by self-interested rational agents in the\n‘original position’ – a position in which agents\npossess broad knowledge about human history and the nature of the\nworld they live in, but are denied specific information regarding\ntheir own particular identities or prospects in the society in\nquestion, the nature of that society, and, crucially, the nature of\ntheir own particular conception of the good. Since nobody knows who\nthey will be or what social position they will occupy, there is no\nopportunity for anyone in an advantaged position to take advantage of\nthat position in order to force a less privileged party to concede to\nan otherwise unacceptable outcome. It is this fact that allows Rawls\nto claim that principles chosen under the veil of ignorance are\nguaranteed to be impartially acceptable to all – and thus,\nguaranteed not to be unjust. \nIt should be noted that Rawls does not intend that morality in its\nentirely be derived from the original position. Rather, the function\nof the original position is limited to the choice of the most general\nprinciples of social justice in a well-ordered society (Rawls 1971,\nsection 2; 2001, section 12). Nevertheless, Rawls’ mechanism is\nintended to draw the broad outlines of what many see as the most\nimportant part of morality: its public or political aspect. By viewing\npolitical morality as the result of an agreement between contractors\nlimited by the strictures of the veil of ignorance, Rawls intends to\ndevelop a political philosophy that reflects his commitment to the\nidea of liberal neutrality: the idea, that is, that each person has a\nprivate right to her own conception of the good, and that particular\nconceptions of the good therefore ought not to be legislatively\ninstituted, nor legislated against. \nAn especially difficult task attending a project of this sort is that\nof determining what shape this political morality will take –\nthat is, determining which principles would be chosen by agents in the\noriginal position. On Rawls’ account, the contractors settle on\nprinciples that guaranteed as much liberty as possible for all and,\nwithin the limits set by this guarantee, a roughly egalitarian\ndistribution of goods in which inequalities are allowed only if they\nare to the benefit of the worst off (Rawls 1971, section 11; 2001,\nPart II). The claim that such principles would recognize all persons\nas equals – and thus, their claim to reflect the demands of\nmoral impartiality – is supported by several considerations, of\nwhich three are perhaps most significant: first, that all persons are\nguaranteed equal (and substantial) civil liberties; second, that the\nresulting allocation of resources is broadly egalitarian, and in\nparticular, ensures, so far as is possible, that the fundamental needs\nof all persons are met; and third, that since the only inequalities\nthat are permitted are those that would benefit the least advantaged,\nit can presumably be assumed that the least advantaged would give\ntheir assent to the existence of such inequalities (they would not,\neven if they could, veto the system.) \nIn Rawls’ scheme, the function of the veil of ignorance is\nnecessary to prevent rational self-interested persons from using their\nknowledge of their own positions to win unfair advantages over others.\n(Whether such an approach can provide genuine impartiality between\ncompeting conceptions of the good is a difficult question that will be\nfurther considered in section 5.) An alternative approach abandons\nboth the veil of ignorance and the assumption that the bargaining\nparties are primarily self-interested. This is the strategy favored by\nT.M. Scanlon, whose contractors are motivated not by self-interest but\nby ‘the desire for reasonable agreement’ (Scanlon 1982, p.\n115 n. 10; see also Scanlon 1978, 1998; Barry 1995). On the resulting\naccount of moral permissibility, “an act is wrong if its\nperformance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any system\nof rules for the general regulation of behavior which no one could\nreasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced general\nagreement.” (Scanlon, 1982, p. 110) The requirement of\nimpartiality is captured here by the basic fact that the question is\nwhether everyone who is to live under the selected rules can\nreasonably accept them. As in Rawls’ theory, however, the\nprinciples of second-order impartiality accepted at the contract level\nallow for considerable first-order partiality at the level of\nagent-choice. \nHarsanyi (1977) argues that a version of utilitarianism can be\ndefended on the basis of an ‘equiprobability model,’\naccording to which an agent ought to choose between social systems\n“under the assumption that, in either system, he would have the\nsame probability of occupying any one of the available social\npositions” (Harsanyi 1982, p. 45; cf. Hare 1981). Gert (1998)\nargues for a list of moral rules which “all impartial rational\npersons would favor including […] as part of the moral\nsystem” (p. 158). Gauthier (1986) defends a contemporary version\nof contractarianism. \nIn addition to objections directed specifically toward\nconsequentialist or deontological conceptions of impartiality, there\nare also objections aimed at the very idea that impartiality ought to\nbe viewed as fundamental to morality. Some would argue that\nimpartiality, as conceived by traditional ethical theories, makes\nextraordinary and unreasonable cognitive demands on moral agents. This\nworry must be distinguished from the objection to consequentialist\nimpartiality considered earlier, which claimed that the\nsacrifices demanded by consequentialist impartiality were\nunreasonable and excessive. The objection now being considered is not\nthat impartiality asks the agent to give up too much, but rather that\nthe cognitive feats demanded by these moral theories will exceed the\ncapacity of the typical moral agent. Indeed, one popular version of\nthis objection alleges that an agent will require an unreasonable\namount of knowledge or cognitive ability simply to be able to identify\nwhat the demands of impartiality are (Friedman 1989; Walker\n1991). Given the conception of the impartial point of view as a\n‘God’s eye’ point of view, for example (Baier 1958),\nit seems questionable whether it is ever reasonable to expect a human\nmoral agent to be able to occupy such a perspective. God, quite\nobviously, possesses far more knowledge than does any human being;\nmoreover, God’s point of view is both objective and impersonal\nin ways that an individual human’s perspective cannot be. (As\nMargaret Urban Walker points out, it is often said that human beings\nhave to live with their decisions, but it sounds very odd to say that\nof God (Walker 1991, p. 765).)  \nSimilar remarks apply to the conception of the impartial point of view\nas ‘the point of view of the universe’ (Sidgwick 1907), to\nHare’s conception of the ideal moral agent as a so-called\n‘archangel’ (Hare, 1981), and, Walker claims, to\nFirth’s conception of the ideal impartial observer (Firth,\n1952.) Similarly, Marilyn Friedman points out that even if a person\ndid manage to occupy such a point of view for a period of time –\nsupposing such a thing to be possible – there would be no way to\nbe certain that she had successfully done so: standard conceptions of\nimpartiality, she claims, prescribe “methods of normative\nthinking [which] represent psychological and epistemic feats, the\nachievement of which we have no independent way to confirm”\n(Friedman 1991, p. 645). \nA second objection to traditional conceptions of moral impartiality\nfinds fault with the traditional tendency to define impartiality in\nnegative or abstract terms – in terms, that is, of which\nelements must be absent from the psychology of the agent, or\nwhich we must pretend are absent in the process of\nidealization. M.C. Henberg, for instance, claims that most if not all\nprocedural accounts of impartiality confuse it with distinterest or\nimpersonality, and thus, ultimately, with indifference. (It should be\nnoted that many impartialists are quite explicit about the link\nbetween morality, impartiality, and the lack of emotion; Baier (1958),\nfor instance, writes that “the moral point of view [is] that of\nan independent, unbiased, impartial, objective, dispassionate,\ndisinterested observer” (p. 201; see also Firth 1952).)\nSimilarly, Richard Brandt argues that it is a mistake to define moral\nimpartiality with reference to an ideal observer who is defined as\n(among other things) distinterested; for after all, “it is not\nclear that a purely disinterested being would support a moral system\nat all” (Brandt 1979, p. 227). While Brandt’s complaint is\nparticularly directed at the ideal observer theory of (Firth 1952),\nthis objection seems to apply much more broadly; it is obvious, for\ninstance, that Rawls’s veil of ignorance is designed precisely\nto prevent the contractors from acting in an interested manner. \nThe problem is not only that impersonal persons of this sort are\nlikely to suffer from massive indifference, but also that there is\nalleged to be a conceptual difficulty with the very idea of conceiving\nimpartiality in such terms. An abstract or impersonal evaluator, it is\nargued, could not possibly make reliable judgments about substantive\nmoral matters (whether or not he was motivated to), since he would be\nunable to appreciate the particular concerns of the contesting\nparties. Both of these difficulties – the motivational and the\ncognitive – are well expressed by Iris Marion Young, who rejects\naltogether the idea that morality is primarily a matter of\nimpartiality: \nHowever, one could endorse certain forms of skepticism about naive\ninterpretations of impartiality without wholeheartedly rejecting\nimpartiality as either unrealistic or undesirable. The literature on\nimplicit bias, which has received considerable attention in the past\nfew years, has important implications for this set of issues. On the\none hand, empirical investigations into implicit bias strongly suggest\nthat, given how deep our biases tend to run (and how unaware we often\nare of the strength and nature of those biases), absolute impartiality\nmust be viewed as an unattainable ideal.  (Indeed, people may often\nbelieve, with some justification, that they are being impartial when\nin fact they are not. They may, for instance, consciously adhere to a\nset of principles, procedures, or categories, that are themselves\nimpartial in nature, while failing to realize that in judging how\nthose principles are to be applied, who is to be assigned to which\ncategory, etc., they are under the influence of unconscious\nprejudice.) At the same time, however, making people more aware of the\nnature and influence of implicit bias tends to increase, rather than\ndecrease, concern with impartiality. Although perfect impartiality is\nindeed an impossible ideal, it seems highly plausible that it\nnonetheless represents, at least in those contexts in which implicit\nbias can lead to unfair or undesirable results, an ideal worth\nstriving for. \nA further issue involves the scope of impartiality: who gets included\nin the community with respect to which we are attempting to judge\nimpartially? As noted above, liberal theorists often tend to\nconceptualize impartiality using the model of a social contract. If\nsociety is pictured as the result of a hypothetical agreement between\npersons, each of whom is equally empowered to revoke the agreement,\nthen it stands to reason that the resulting set of rules must in some\nsense be acceptable to all, and must embody, in some deep way, the\nideal of equal respect. Some have complained, however, that this\napproach risks leaving those not party to the contract out in the\ncold. But surely it is plausible to think that a society, in order to\nbe just, must not only treat (and avoid treating) its own\ncitizens in certain ways, but must also respect certain rules\nregarding its behavior towards members of other societies. As Charles\nJones (1999) writes, “Unlike Rawls … I see no reason to\nrestrict our moral focus to the basic structure of any particular\nnation-state; on the contrary, if one’s concern is with the\njustifiability of the institutions which determine people’s life\nchances, there are compelling grounds for taking a wider view.”\n \nAmartya Sen (2002) draws a distinction between ‘open’ and\n‘closed’ impartiality, which “turns on whether or\nnot the exercise of impartial assessment is confined … to a\nfixed group.” Since the contractors behind the veil of ignorance\nare aware that they are part of a certain society (and do not see\nthemselves in any sense as representing the world as a whole), the\nveil of ignorance represents an impartial system only in the closed\nsense. Therefore, Sen complains that “As a device of structured\npolitical analysis, the procedure is not geared to addressing the need\nto overcome group prejudices.” By contrast, open impartiality,\nwhich Sen finds recommended in the works of Adam Smith (see Smith\n1759), demands “that the viewpoints of others, whether or not\nbelonging to some group of which one is specifically a member, receive\nadequate attention.” \nThere are various responses open to Rawlsian theorists. Rawls himself\nsuggests that we imagine a second veil of ignorance behind which\nrepresentatives of various societies can meet in order to set fair and\nimpartial ground rules for international relations. Much like justice\nwithin states, Rawls writes, “Justice between states is\ndetermined by the principles that would be chosen in the original\nposition so interpreted. These principles are political principles,\nfor they govern public policies toward other nations.” (Rawls\n1971) Such a position, of course, will not satisfy everyone, and some\ncritics worry that reiterating the veil of ignorance on the\ninternational level will simply reiterate its more problematic\nelements in a wider scale. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in\nmind that the objection, here, is not to impartiality itself, but to a\nparticular version of it. Indeed, what critics such as Sen and Jones\nare really claiming, of course, is that the framework Rawls provides\nis not impartial enough. \nIf genuine impartiality is an illusion, as Young alleges, then\nimpartialists may be suspected in smuggling in their own substantive\nmoral positions and biases under the guise of neutrality.\nRawls’s use of the veil of ignorance, for example, has been\ncriticized by Thomas Nagel and others on the basis that, by requiring\nthat agents lack knowledge of their conceptions of the good (a\nnecessary stipulation of the bargainers are to achieve a consensus),\nthe veil of ignorance excludes from the original position information\nthat is morally relevant, and indeed may put some of the bargainers at\na disadvantage. “The original position,” Nagel writes,\n“seems to presuppose not just a neutral theory of the good, but\na liberal, individualistic conception according to which the best that\ncan be wished for someone is the unimpeded pursuit of his own path,\nprovided it does not interfere with the rights of others” (Nagel\n1973; see also Teitelman 1972; Schwartz 1973; Sandel 1982; Benhabib\n1987). Such a conception, it is held, clearly does favor some\nconceptions of the good over others: in particular, atomic,\nindividualistic conceptions focusing on personal fulfillment\n(constituted, perhaps, through the acquisition of consumer goods) are\nprivileged over more communal or social ideals that focus on\nsolidarity and mutual interaction between persons (Sandel 1982; cf.\nO’Neill 1997, Chapter 1). \nFeminist critics have paid particular attention to the ways in which\nliberal conceptions of neutrality and impartiality presuppose and\nreinforce traditional male-dominated, individualistic approaches to\nmoral theory, and in doing so reinforce the social status quo\n(Gilligan 1982; Noddings 1984; Benhabib 1987; Young 1990). As Benhabib\nhas pointed out, “Universalistic moral theories in the Western\ntradition from Hobbes to Rawls are substitutionalist, in the\nsense that the universalism they defend is defined surreptitiously by\nidentifying the experiences of a specific group of subjects as the\nparadigmatic case of the human as such. These subjects are invariably\nwhite, male adults who are propertied or at least professional.”\n(Benhabib 1987, p. 81) As a result, the dominant social positions of\nsuch parties tend to be protected and even enhanced in the social and\npolitical theories resulting from such allegedly neutral liberal\ntheories. \nThe problem of neutrality is a pressing one for liberals: given the\nimportance to their view of the thought that an impartial government\nmust be neutral between various moral conceptions (it must, that is,\nrespect what Rawls calls ‘the fact of pluralism’), it is\nessential to show that liberal impartialism does not simply represent\nanother such moral conception (or ‘sectarian view’) in its\nown right. Liberal impartialism, then, must turn out to be a framework\nthat can be agreed to by all relevant parties, even as they continue\nto disagree regarding particular substantive moral issues. \nHow is the liberal to establish this? Nagel (1987) endorses what he\ncalls ‘epistemological restraint,’ which holds that it can\nbe reasonable for an individual to hold certain beliefs yet\nsimultaneously unreasonable to attempt to decide matters of public\npolicy on the basis of such beliefs. Such beliefs, which tend to be\nmoral or religious in nature, are said to be viewed differently from\nthe inside (from which standpoint they have perfect authority) than\nfrom the outside (from which standpoint they are regarded as\nquestionable). The difficulty, as Barry (1995) and Raz (1990) have\npointed out, is to explain why doubts visible from the outside would\nnot infect the internal point of view, thus weakening these\nbeliefs’ internal authority as well. (It should be noted that\nNagel himself has expressed doubts about this argument in Nagel\n1991.) \nRawls’s view appears to be similar to Nagel’s (and thus,\nsubject to the same difficulty). According to Rawls, to endorse a view\nof justice is not to claim that it is true; moreover, the\nacceptability of liberal impartialism is not to be derived from its\ntruth; rather, such a view will be accepted (it is to be hoped)\nbecause, in societies of the relevant sort, it will form a common\nelement (an ‘overlapping consensus’) in the various\ncompeting conceptions of the good that occupy the public sphere (Rawls\n1993). (Again, the criticisms contained in Raz 1990 are especially\ntrenchant.) \nWhile both Nagel and Rawls explicitly reject the idea that liberal\nimpartialism is to be justified on the basis of skepticism toward\nvarious conceptions of the good, Barry (1995) explicitly endorses this\nform of justification. (Barry emphasizes that the relevant form of\nskepticism does not involve eschewing one’s moral and religious\nbeliefs, but rather rejecting the claim to be certain of the\ntruth of those beliefs.) This approach has been criticized on the\nbasis that such skepticism itself constitutes a sectarian view, and\ntherefore is not neutral (Larmore 1987, Mendus 2002) However, as Barry\npoints out, the decisive issue is not whether some people would reject\nskepticism, but whether it can reasonably be rejected –\nand given Barry’s definition of skepticism, its claim to resist\nbeing so rejected seems considerably stronger than the claims of the\nvarious conceptions of the good themselves, which must indeed be\nexcluded from the public sphere. \nWhile some philosophers reject the moral significance of partiality\naltogether, holding that morality is both fundamentally and thoroughly\nimpartial, many agree with Nagel (1991) that morality includes both\npartial and impartial elements. A good deal of recent philosophical\ndiscussion has concerned the following question: where partiality is\njustified, what justifies it? \nOne influential account of partiality’s justification appeals to\nthe value of personal projects. Since personal projects and/or the\nability to pursue personal projects are important, and since agents\nwho were required to be completely impartial in every aspect of life\nwould be unable to pursue such projects, we should allow that people\nare not required to be absolutely impartial in every aspect of\nlife. Bernard Williams (1981) famously argues that at least some of an\nagent’s projects – he calls them “ground\nprojects” – are fundamental components of the\nagent’s identity, and an agent who gives them up, because she is\nrequired to do so by morality, or for any other reason, will find\nherself with no reason to be moral, to go on living, or to do anything\nat all. Other philosophers, including Wolf (1992; see also 1982),\nMacIntyre (1984), Sandel (1982), and Stroud (2010) also base the\njustification of partiality on the value and significance of personal\nprojects and commitments. (For Sandel and MacIntyre this means,\nlargely, commitments to the political community that has formed\none’s identity and to which one owes one’s\nallegiance.) \nA second possible account sees our personal relationships as the\nsource of partiality’s justification. Kolodny (2003) argues that\npersonal relationships bear “final value” and that this grounds\nspecial obligations toward those people to whom we are related.\nSimilarly, Scheffler (2004), argues that valuing a relationship\nnon-instrumentally necessarily involves seeing it as giving rise to\ncertain reasons that will be partial in nature. A variation on this\nsort of view agrees that relationships are significant but suggests\nthat we should view reasons, rather than value, as fundamental. On\nsuch views our reasons for giving preferential treatment to those to\nwhom we are related are not grounded in the value of those\nrelationships and indeed need not be reduced to or grounded in\nanything else at all; they carry inherent and irreducible normative\nsignificance. Views of this sort are put forward by Scanlon (1998) and\nJeske (2008). \nKeller (2013) criticizes both the projects-based view and the\nrelationship-based view, and argues instead for a third alternative,\nwhich he calls “the individuals view.” According to the\nindividuals view, reasons that justify the special treatment of those\nto whom we are related “arise from facts about the individuals with\nwhom our special relationships are shared” (79). Rather than acting\nas reasons for treating those persons better than others, our\nrelationships act as enablers –that is, background conditions that\nexplain why some facts count as reasons for a given agent. (Keller\nborrows the idea of an enabler, and the term, from Jonathan Dancy; see\nespecially Dancy (2004). For similar views, which also draw on\nDancy’s work, see Jollimore (2011) and Lord (2016).) \nAlthough many people continue to speak of a ‘partialist vs.\nimpartialist debate,’ it should by now be clear that neither\n‘partialism’ nor ‘impartialism’ unambiguously\ndenote any single moral position; at best, they designate two poles of\na continuum, one of which attributes no moral significance to the\ndemands of (any sort of) impartiality, the other of which sees\nmorality as exhausted by (some version of) impartiality. While a\nsomewhat general distinction can be usefully maintained, it is\nmisleading to think of the partialist-impartialist debate as a dispute\nbetween two clearly defined, and clearly opposed, camps (Deigh 1991;\nBarry 1995, pp. 191–5). Maximillian de Gaynesford goes so far as\nto argue that “debates about partialism and impartialism thrive\non tacit assumptions about the way each relates to the first person.\nThese assumptions rest on mistakes and confusions …” (de\nGaynesford 2010). \nThus, any general claim beginning with the words ‘partialists\n(or impartialists) think that…’ is bound to be both\nmisleading and contentious. In particular, there is good reason to be\nwary of objections to impartialism which claim that all impartialists\nendorse extreme moral demands, or that they require that practical\nreasoning be completely expunged of every vestige of the partial. It\nis true, of course, that at least some impartialists, such as Godwin,\nhave endorsed such claims. But many do not. Deontologists, as we have\nseen, hold impartiality to be a deep and significant element of\nmorality, but they also tend to allow for a considerable degree of\nfirst-order partiality. And even many consequentialists are prepared\nto admit the legitimacy of partial reasoning in some contexts, if only\non an instrumental basis. It is useful, then, to draw a distinction\nbetween two sorts of impartialist moral theory. Impartialist theories\nwhich require all agents to display first-order impartiality at all\ntimes (Godwin’s, for example) might be referred to as strict\nimpartialist theories. Impartialist theories which allow for some\nfirst-order partiality, but which nevertheless insist that all such\nbehavior be justified in second-order impartialist terms, might be\nreferred to as fundamentally impartialist moral theories. The\nclass of fundamentally impartial theories will include not only\ncontractualist, Kantian, and rule consequentialist theories, but also\ncertain act consequentialist theories (e.g. Railton 1986) which allow\nthe practice of first-order partiality as a means of promoting the\nimpersonal good. Such theories allow for partiality that is\npermissible, justifiable, and perhaps even admirable in moral terms.\nAt the same time, however, they insist that all such partiality is\nultimately reducible – that is, justifiable in impartialist\nterms at some deeper level. \nWithin the partialist camp, a strict partialist might be\ndefined as holding that no sort of impartiality plays any moral role\nwhatsoever – a logically possible, but uncommon, position. A\nmoderate partialist, by contrast, would admit that\nimpartiality of some sort plays a moral role, but deny that this role\nencompasses, or grounds, all of morality; in particular, such a figure\nwould be committed to the existence, in some contexts at least, of\nirreducible morally admirable partiality. A virtue theorist, for\ninstance, might make a significant place for impartiality by selecting\nit as one of the virtues; but a virtue of this sort would presumably\nhave to compete with other deeply partialist virtues such as loyalty,\nwhich would override impartiality in at least some contexts. \nTo the extent that a deep issue between partialists and impartialists\ncan be identified, it is presumably the question of whether\n(irreducible) morally admirable partiality does indeed exist; and it\nis along this line of dispute that the debate seems likeliest to\ncontinue. (Whether this debate is identical to the so-called\n‘justice-care’ debate, as contended in Cannold, et\nal (1995), is questionable, though it is undeniable that there\nare important parallels.) However, this way of classifying the\ndisputants, and of characterizing the issue itself, is meant to be\nsuggestive rather than definitive. The fact remains that there are\nmany types of partialist theories, and many types of impartialist\nones, and that continuing to speak of the\n‘partialist-impartialist debate’ in loose and imprecise\nterms is more likely to obscure than to illuminate. \nCommonsense morality agrees with most deontological theories that\npersonal relationships involve various forms of morally admirable\npartiality. Until now most philosophers who have examined this\nphenomenon have focused on practical obligations: the ways in which we\nare obligated to treat our friends and relatives better than we treat\npeople whom we do not know and to whom we are not significantly\nrelated. Disagreements regarding the extent and nature of such\npractical obligations have dominated the partialist-impartialist\ndebate.  \nRecently, however, a number of philosophers have focused their\nattention on a second sort of obligation we seem to have to friends\nand relatives. In addition to treating them differently, commonsense\nthought seems to hold that we ought to adopt different patterns of\nbelief formation and evaluation with respect to them – patterns of\nbelief formation and evaluation that make it more likely that we will\nthink highly of them and regard them in a positive light. Thus, it has\nbeen suggested that friendship and similar relationships involve\nepistemic partiality: there are forms of epistemic bias which are\nrecommended and possibly required by such relationships. As Simon\nKeller has written, “when good friends form beliefs about each\nother, they sometimes respond to considerations that have to do with\nthe needs and interests of their friends, not with aiming at the\ntruth, and that this is part of what makes them good friends”\n(Keller 2004, p. 333).  \nSimilarly, Sarah Stroud has argued that when it is a friend’s\nbehavior that is in question, rather than that of a stranger,\n“we tend to devote more energy to defeating or minimizing the\nimpact of unfavorable data than we otherwise would. … [A]t the\nend of the day we are simply less likely to conclude that our friend\nacted disreputably, or that he is a bad person, than we would in the\ncase of a nonfriend” (Stroud 2006, pp. 505–6). \nAs both Keller and Stroud point out, these are not simply descriptions\nof typical friendship behavior; rather, they seem to be generally\naccepted as requirements of friendship. If so – and if it really\nis true that epistemic partiality makes us less likely to form true\nbeliefs (but see Jollimore 2011 for a challenge to this\nclaim) – then we seem to face a difficult choice: we must either\naccept that forming true beliefs is not the only goal with respect to\nwhich epistemic standards should be evaluated, or else accept that the\nrequirements of friendship and other forms of love can conflict with\nthe requirements of epistemic rationality: being an ideal epistemic\nagent, that is, is not always compatible with being an ideal\nfriend. \nAs always, the issue is complicated by the effects of context. Whether\nthey are motivational or epistemic (or some combination of the two),\npartial biases that are entirely appropriate in some contexts, such as\nfriendship, will be deeply inappropriate in others, such as the making\nof hiring or sentencing decisions. (This assumes, of course, that we\nare rejecting the consequentialist view that the requirements of\nstrict impartiality are pervasive in all aspects of our lives.) As\nmentioned above, empirical research on implicit bias strongly suggests\nthat even when we recognize that we are acting in the latter sort of\ncontext, and believe ourselves to be acting in a thoroughly impartial\nand unbiased manner, we may well be fooling ourselves. Thus,\nformulating a correct theoretical understanding of the scope and\ndemands of partiality and impartiality, as difficult as that task is\nin itself, may not be sufficient for acting as a truly good or\nvirtuous agent. The more practical task of training our perceptions,\ninclinations, and motivations in order to see and respond to the\nworld, at least where appropriate, in an impartial way – or, if\nthis is not possible, then to see and act in ways that take into\naccount and correct for our inherent biases – would also seem to\nbe necessary.
