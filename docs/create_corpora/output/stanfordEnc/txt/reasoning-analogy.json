Analogical reasoning is any type of thinking that\nrelies upon an analogy. An analogical\nargument is an explicit representation of a form of\nanalogical reasoning that cites accepted similarities between two\nsystems to support the conclusion that some further similarity\nexists. In general (but not always), such arguments belong in the\ncategory of ampliative reasoning, since their conclusions do not\nfollow with certainty but are only supported with varying degrees of\nstrength. However, the proper characterization of analogical arguments\nis subject to debate (see §2.2). \n\n\n\nAnalogical reasoning is fundamental to human thought and, arguably,\nto some nonhuman animals as well. Historically, analogical\nreasoning has played an important, but sometimes mysterious, role in a\nwide range of problem-solving contexts. The explicit use of\nanalogical arguments, since antiquity, has been a distinctive feature\nof scientific, philosophical and legal reasoning. This article\nfocuses primarily on the nature, evaluation and justification of\nanalogical arguments. Related topics include\n metaphor,\n models in science,\nand\n precedent and analogy in legal reasoning.\n\n\n\nAnalogies are widely recognized as playing an important\nheuristic role, as aids to discovery. They have been\nemployed, in a wide variety of settings and with considerable success,\nto generate insight and to formulate possible solutions to\nproblems. According to Joseph Priestley, a pioneer in chemistry\nand electricity, \nanalogy is our best guide in all philosophical\ninvestigations; and all discoveries, which were not made by mere\naccident, have been made by the help of it. (1769/1966: 14)\n \n Priestley may be over-stating the case, but there is no\ndoubt that analogies have suggested fruitful lines of inquiry in many\nfields. Because of their heuristic value, analogies and\nanalogical reasoning have been a particular focus of AI research. Hájek (2018) examines analogy as a heuristic tool in philosophy. \n\nAnalogies have a related (and not entirely separable)\njustificatory role. This role is most obvious where an\nanalogical argument is explicitly offered in support of some\nconclusion. The intended degree of support for the conclusion can\nvary considerably. At one extreme, these arguments can be\nstrongly predictive. For example\n(Example 1),\nhydrodynamic analogies exploit mathematical similarities between the equations\ngoverning ideal fluid flow and torsional problems. To predict stresses\nin a planned structure, one can construct a fluid model, i.e., a\nsystem of pipes through which water passes (Timoshenko and Goodier\n1970). Within the limits of\nidealization, such analogies allow us to make demonstrative inferences, for example,\nfrom a measured quantity in the fluid model to the analogous value in\nthe torsional problem. In practice, there are numerous complications\n(Sterrett 2006).  \n\nAt the other extreme, an analogical argument may provide very weak\nsupport for its conclusion, establishing no more than minimal\nplausibility. Consider\n(Example 2)\nThomas Reid’s (1785) argument for the existence of life on other planets (Stebbing\n1933; Mill 1843/1930; Robinson 1930; Copi 1961). Reid notes a\nnumber of similarities between Earth and the other planets in our solar\nsystem: all orbit and are illuminated by the sun; several have\nmoons; all revolve on an axis. In consequence, he concludes, it\nis “not unreasonable to think, that those planets may, like our\nearth, be the habitation of various orders of living creatures”\n(1785: 24). \n\nSuch modesty is not uncommon. Often the point of an analogical\nargument is just to persuade people to take an idea seriously. \nFor instance\n(Example 3),\nDarwin takes himself to be using an analogy\nbetween artificial and natural selection to argue for the plausibility\nof the latter: \nWhy may I not invent the hypothesis of Natural Selection (which from\nthe analogy of domestic productions, and from what we know of the\nstruggle of existence and of the variability of organic beings, is, in\nsome very slight degree, in itself probable) and try whether this\nhypothesis of Natural Selection does not explain (as I think it does) a\nlarge number of facts…. (Letter to Henslow, May 1860 in Darwin 1903)\n \n\nHere it appears, by Darwin’s own admission, that his analogy\nis employed to show that the hypothesis is probable to some\n“slight degree” and thus merits further investigation. Some, however, reject this characterization of Darwin’s reasoning (Richards 1997; Gildenhuys 2004).  \n\nSometimes analogical reasoning is the only available form of\njustification for a hypothesis. The method of ethnographic\nanalogy is used to interpret \nthe nonobservable behaviour of\nthe ancient inhabitants of an archaeological site (or ancient culture)\nbased on the similarity of their artifacts to those used by living\npeoples. (Hunter and Whitten 1976: 147)\n \nFor example (Example 4), Shelley (1999,\n2003) describes how ethnographic analogy was used to determine the\nprobable significance of odd markings on the necks of Moche clay pots\nfound in the Peruvian Andes. Contemporary potters in Peru use these\nmarks (called sígnales) to indicate ownership; the\nmarks enable them to reclaim their work when several potters share a\nkiln or storage facility. Analogical reasoning may be the only avenue\nof inference to the past in such cases, though this point is subject\nto dispute (Gould and Watson 1982; Wylie 1982, 1985). Analogical\nreasoning may have similar significance for cosmological phenomena\nthat are inaccessible due to limits on observation (Dardashti et\nal. 2017). See \n§5.1 for further discussion.  \n\nAs philosophers and historians such as Kuhn (1996) have repeatedly\npointed out, there is not always a clear separation between the two\nroles that we have identified, discovery and justification. \nIndeed, the two functions are blended in what we might call the\nprogrammatic (or paradigmatic) role of analogy: \nover a period of time, an analogy can shape the development of a\nprogram of research. For example\n(Example 5),\nan\n‘acoustical analogy’ was employed for many years by certain\nnineteenth-century physicists investigating spectral lines. \nDiscrete spectra were thought to be \ncompletely analogous to the\nacoustical situation, with atoms (and/or molecules) serving as\noscillators originating or absorbing the vibrations in the manner of\nresonant tuning forks. (Maier 1981: 51) \n \nGuided by this\nanalogy, physicists looked for groups of spectral lines that exhibited\nfrequency patterns characteristic of a harmonic oscillator. This\nanalogy served not only to underwrite the plausibility of conjectures,\nbut also to guide and limit discovery by pointing scientists\nin certain directions.  \nMore generally, analogies can play an important programmatic role by guiding conceptual development (see §5.2). In some cases, a programmatic analogy culminates in the theoretical\nunification of two different areas of inquiry. Descartes’s\n(1637/1954) correlation between geometry and algebra, for example\n(Example 6), provided methods for\nsystematically handling geometrical problems that had long been\nrecognized as analogous. A very different relationship between\nanalogy and discovery exists when a programmatic analogy breaks down,\nas was the ultimate fate of the acoustical analogy. That atomic\nspectra have an entirely different explanation became clear with the\nadvent of quantum theory. In this case, novel discoveries emerged\nagainst background expectations shaped by the guiding\nanalogy. There is a third possibility: an unproductive or\nmisleading programmatic analogy may simply become entrenched and\nself-perpetuating as it leads us to “construct… data that\nconform to it” (Stepan 1996: 133). Arguably, the danger of\nthis third possibility provides strong motivation for developing a\ncritical account of analogical reasoning and analogical arguments.  \n\nAnalogical cognition, which embraces all cognitive processes\ninvolved in discovering, constructing and using analogies, is broader than analogical reasoning (Hofstadter 2001; Hofstadter and Sander 2013). \nUnderstanding these processes is an important objective of current\ncognitive science research, and an objective that generates many\nquestions. How do humans identify analogies? Do\nnonhuman animals use analogies in ways similar\nto humans? How do analogies and metaphors influence concept\nformation? \n\nThis entry, however, concentrates specifically on analogical\narguments. Specifically, it focuses on three central\nepistemological questions: \n\nFollowing a preliminary discussion of the basic structure of\nanalogical arguments, the entry reviews selected attempts to provide\nanswers to these three questions. To find such answers would\nconstitute an important first step towards understanding the nature of\nanalogical reasoning. To isolate these questions, however, is to\nmake the non-trivial assumption that there can be a theory of\nanalogical arguments—an assumption which, as\nwe shall see, is attacked in different ways by both philosophers and\ncognitive scientists.  \n\nAnalogical arguments vary greatly in subject matter, strength and\nlogical structure. In order to appreciate this variety, it is\nhelpful to increase our stock of examples. First, a geometric\nexample: \n\nExample 7\n(Rectangles and boxes). Suppose that you have\nestablished that of all rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square\nhas maximum area. By analogy, you conjecture that of all boxes\nwith a fixed surface area, the cube has maximum volume. \n\nTwo examples from the history of science: \n\nExample 8 (Morphine and\nmeperidine). In 1934, the pharmacologist Schaumann was\ntesting synthetic compounds for their anti-spasmodic effect. These\ndrugs had a chemical structure similar to morphine. He observed that\none of the compounds—meperidine, also known\nas Demerol—had a physical effect on mice that was\npreviously observed only with morphine: it induced an S-shaped tail\ncurvature. By analogy, he conjectured that the drug might also share\nmorphine’s narcotic effects. Testing on rats, rabbits, dogs and\neventually humans showed that meperidine, like morphine, was an\neffective pain-killer (Lembeck 1989: 11; Reynolds and Randall 1975:\n273).  \n\nExample 9\n(Priestley on electrostatic force). In 1769, Priestley\nsuggested that the absence of electrical influence inside a hollow\ncharged spherical shell was evidence that charges attract and repel\nwith an inverse square force. He supported his hypothesis by\nappealing to the analogous situation of zero gravitational force inside\na hollow shell of uniform density. \n\nFinally, an example from legal reasoning:  \n\nExample 10\n(Duty of reasonable care).  In a much-cited case\n(Donoghue v. Stevenson 1932 AC 562), the United Kingdom House of Lords\nfound the manufacturer of a bottle of ginger beer liable for damages\nto a consumer who became ill as a result of a dead snail in the\nbottle. The court argued that the manufacturer had a duty to take\n“reasonable care” in creating a product that could\nforeseeably result in harm to the consumer in the absence of such\ncare, and where the consumer had no possibility of intermediate\nexamination. The principle articulated in this famous case was\nextended, by analogy, to allow recovery for harm against an\nengineering firm whose negligent repair work caused the collapse of a\nlift (Haseldine v. CA Daw & Son Ltd. 1941 2 KB 343). By\ncontrast, the principle was not applicable to a case where a workman\nwas injured by a defective crane, since the workman had opportunity to\nexamine the crane and was even aware of the defects (Farr\nv. Butters Brothers & Co. 1932 2 KB 606). \n\nWhat, if anything, do all of these examples have in common? We\nbegin with a simple, quasi-formal characterization. Similar formulations are found in elementary critical thinking texts (e.g., Copi and Cohen\n2005) and in the literature on argumentation theory (e.g., Govier 1999, Guarini 2004, Walton and Hyra 2018). An analogical argument has the following form: \n\n(1) and (2) are premises. (3) is the conclusion of the\nargument. The argument form is ampliative; the conclusion\nis not guaranteed to follow from the premises.  \n\nS and T are referred to as the source\ndomain and target domain, respectively. A\ndomain is a set of objects, properties, relations and\nfunctions, together with a set of accepted statements about those\nobjects, properties, relations and functions. More formally, a\ndomain consists of a set of objects and an interpreted set of\nstatements about them. The statements need not belong to a\nfirst-order language, but to keep things simple, any formalizations\nemployed here will be first-order. We use unstarred symbols\n(a, P, R, f) to refer to items in\nthe source domain and starred symbols\n(a*, P*, R*, f*) to\nrefer to corresponding items in the target domain. In\n Example 9,\nthe source domain items\npertain to gravitation; the target items pertain to electrostatic\nattraction. \n\nFormally, an analogy between S and T is a\none-to-one mapping between objects, properties, relations and functions\nin S and those in T. Not all of the items in\nS and T need to be placed in correspondence. \nCommonly, the analogy only identifies correspondences between a select\nset of items. In practice, we specify an analogy simply by\nindicating the most significant similarities (and sometimes\ndifferences).  \n\nWe can improve on this preliminary characterization of the argument\nfrom analogy by introducing the tabular representation found\nin Hesse (1966). We place corresponding objects, properties,\nrelations and propositions side-by-side in a table of two columns, one\nfor each domain. For instance, Reid’s argument\n (Example 2)\ncan be represented as\nfollows (using ⇒ for the analogical inference): Figure 1. \n\nHesse introduced useful terminology based on this tabular\nrepresentation. The horizontal relations in an\nanalogy are the relations of similarity (and difference) in the mapping\nbetween domains, while the vertical relations are those\nbetween the objects, relations and properties within each domain. \nThe correspondence (similarity) between earth’s having a moon and\nMars’ having moons is a horizontal relation; the causal relation\nbetween having a moon and supporting life is a vertical relation within\nthe source domain (with the possibility of a distinct such relation\nexisting in the target as well).  \n\nIn an earlier discussion of analogy, Keynes (1921) introduced some\nterminology that is also helpful.  Positive analogy.\nLet P stand for a list of accepted propositions\nP1, …, Pn\nabout the source domain S.  Suppose that the corresponding propositions\nP*1, …, P*n,\nabbreviated as P*, are all accepted as holding for the target\ndomain T, so that P and P* represent accepted (or\nknown) similarities. Then we refer to P as the positive\nanalogy. Negative analogy.\nLet A stand for a list of\npropositions A1, …,\nAr accepted as holding in S, and\nB* for a list B1*,\n…, Bs* of propositions\nholding in T. Suppose that the analogous propositions\nA* = A1*, …, Ar*\nfail to hold in T, and similarly the propositions B =\nB1, …, Bs fail to hold\nin S, so that A, ~A* and ~B,\nB* represent accepted (or known) differences. Then we refer\nto A and B as the negative\nanalogy.  Neutral analogy.\nThe neutral analogy consists of accepted propositions about\nS for which it is not known whether an analogue holds in\nT. Finally we have: Hypothetical analogy.\nThe hypothetical analogy is simply the proposition Q\nin the neutral analogy that is the focus of our attention. \n\nThese concepts allow us to provide a characterization for an\nindividual analogical argument that is somewhat richer than the\noriginal one. \nAn analogical argument may thus be summarized:  \n\nIt is plausible that Q* holds in the target,\nbecause of certain known (or accepted) similarities with the\nsource domain, despite certain known (or accepted)\ndifferences. \n\nIn order for this characterization to be meaningful, we need to say\nsomething about the meaning of ‘plausibly.’ To ensure\nbroad applicability over analogical arguments that vary greatly in\nstrength, we interpret plausibility rather liberally as meaning\n‘with some degree of support’. In general, judgments\nof plausibility are made after a claim has been formulated, but prior\nto rigorous testing or proof. The next sub-section provides\nfurther discussion. \n\nNote that this characterization is incomplete in a number of\nways. The manner in which we list similarities and differences,\nthe nature of the correspondences between domains: these things\nare left unspecified. Nor does this characterization accommodate\nreasoning with multiple analogies (i.e., multiple source domains),\nwhich is ubiquitous in legal reasoning and common elsewhere. To\ncharacterize the argument form more fully, however, is not possible\nwithout either taking a step towards a substantive theory of analogical\nreasoning or restricting attention to certain classes of analogical\narguments. \n\nArguments by analogy are extensively discussed within argumentation theory. There is considerable debate about whether they constitute a species of deductive inference (Govier 1999; Waller 2001; Guarini 2004; Kraus 2015). Argumentation theorists also make use of tools such as speech act theory (Bermejo-Luque 2012), argumentation schemes and dialogue types (Macagno et al. 2017; Walton and Hyra 2018) to distinguish different types of analogical argument. \n\nArguments by analogy are also discussed in the vast literature on scientific models and model-based reasoning, following the lead of Hesse (1966). Bailer-Jones (2002) draws a helpful distinction between analogies and models. While “many models have their roots in an analogy” (2002: 113) and analogy “can act as a catalyst to aid modeling,” Bailer-Jones observes that “the aim of modeling has nothing intrinsically to do with analogy.” In brief, models are tools for prediction and explanation, whereas analogical arguments aim at establishing plausibility. An analogy is evaluated in terms of source-target similarity, while a model is evaluated on how successfully it “provides access to a phenomenon in that it interprets the available empirical data about the phenomenon.” If we broaden our perspective beyond analogical arguments, however, the connection between models and analogies is restored. Nersessian (2009), for instance, stresses the role of analog models in concept-formation and other cognitive processes. \n\nTo say that a hypothesis is plausible is to convey that it has\nepistemic support: we have some reason to believe it, even prior\nto testing. An assertion of plausibility within the context of an\ninquiry typically has pragmatic connotations as well: to say that\na hypothesis is plausible suggests that we have some reason to\ninvestigate it further. For example, a mathematician working on a\nproof regards a conjecture as plausible if it “has some chances\nof success” (Polya 1954 (v. 2): 148). On both points, there\nis ambiguity as to whether an assertion of plausibility is categorical\nor a matter of degree. These observations point to the existence\nof two distinct conceptions of plausibility, probabilistic and\nmodal, either of which may reflect the intended conclusion of\nan analogical argument. \n\nOn the probabilistic conception, plausibility is naturally\nidentified with rational credence (rational subjective degree of\nbelief) and is typically represented as a probability. A classic\nexpression may be found in Mill’s analysis of the argument from\nanalogy in A System of Logic:  \n\nThere can be no doubt that every resemblance [not known to be\nirrelevant] affords some degree of probability, beyond what would\notherwise exist, in favour of the conclusion. (Mill 1843/1930: 333) \n\nIn the terminology introduced in §2.2,\nMill’s idea is that each element of the positive analogy boosts\nthe probability of the conclusion. Contemporary\n‘structure-mapping’ theories (§3.4)\nemploy a restricted version: each structural similarity\nbetween two domains contributes to the overall measure of similarity,\nand hence to the strength of the analogical argument.  \n\nOn the alternative modal conception, ‘it is plausible\nthat p’ is not a matter of degree. The meaning,\nroughly speaking, is that there are sufficient initial grounds for\ntaking p seriously, i.e., for further investigation (subject\nto feasibility and interest). Informally: p passes\nan initial screening procedure. There is no assertion of\ndegree. Instead, ‘It is plausible that’ may be\nregarded as an epistemic modal operator that aims to capture a notion,\nprima facie plausibility, that is somewhat stronger than\nordinary epistemic possibility. The intent is to single out\np from an undifferentiated mass of ideas that remain bare\nepistemic possibilities. To illustrate: in 1769, Priestley’s argument\n(Example 9), if successful, would\nestablish the prima facie plausibility of an inverse square\nlaw for electrostatic attraction. The set of epistemic\npossibilities—hypotheses about electrostatic attraction\ncompatible with knowledge of the day—was much larger. Individual\nanalogical arguments in mathematics (such\nas Example 7) are\nalmost invariably directed towards\nprima facie plausibility.  \n\nThe modal conception figures importantly in some discussions of\nanalogical reasoning. The physicist N. R. Campbell (1957)\nwrites: \n\nBut in order that a theory may be valuable it must … display\nan analogy. The propositions of the hypothesis must be analogous\nto some known laws…. (1957: 129) \n\nCommenting on the role of analogy in Fourier’s theory of heat\nconduction, Campbell writes: \n\nSome analogy is essential to it; for it is only this\nanalogy which distinguishes the theory from the multitude of\nothers… which might also be proposed to explain the same laws.\n(1957: 142)  \n\nThe interesting notion here is that of a “valuable”\ntheory. We may not agree with Campbell that the existence of\nanalogy is “essential” for a novel theory to be\n“valuable.” But consider the weaker thesis that an\nacceptable analogy is sufficient to establish that a theory is\n“valuable”, or (to qualify still further) that an\nacceptable analogy provides defeasible grounds for taking the theory\nseriously. (Possible defeaters might include internal\ninconsistency, inconsistency with accepted theory, or the existence of\na (clearly superior) rival analogical argument.) The point is\nthat Campbell, following the lead of 19th century\nphilosopher-scientists such as Herschel and Whewell, thinks that\nanalogies can establish this sort of prima facie\nplausibility. Snyder (2006) provides a detailed discussion of the\nlatter two thinkers and their ideas about the role of analogies\nin science.  \n\nIn general, analogical arguments may be directed at establishing\neither sort of plausibility for their conclusions; they can have a\nprobabilistic use or a modal use.\n Examples 7\nthrough\n 9\nare best interpreted as\nsupporting modal conclusions. In those arguments, an analogy is\nused to show that a conjecture is worth taking seriously. To\ninsist on putting the conclusion in probabilistic terms distracts\nattention from the point of the argument. The conclusion might be\nmodeled (by a Bayesian) as having a certain probability value\nbecause it is deemed prima facie plausible, but not\n vice versa. Example 2,\nperhaps,\nmight be regarded as directed primarily towards a probabilistic\nconclusion. \n\nThere should be connections between the two conceptions. \nIndeed, we might think that the same analogical argument can establish\nboth prima facie plausibility and a degree of probability for\na hypothesis. But it is difficult to translate between epistemic modal\nconcepts and probabilities (Cohen 1980; Douven and Williamson\n2006; Huber 2009; Spohn 2009, 2012). We cannot simply take the\nprobabilistic notion as the primitive one. It seems wise to keep\nthe two conceptions of plausibility separate.  \n\nSchema (4) is a template that represents all analogical\narguments, good and bad. It is not an inference rule. \nDespite the confidence with which particular analogical arguments are\nadvanced, nobody has ever formulated an acceptable rule, or set of\nrules, for valid analogical inferences. There is not even a\nplausible candidate. This situation is in marked contrast not\nonly with deductive reasoning, but also with elementary forms of\ninductive reasoning, such as induction by enumeration. \n\nOf course, it is difficult to show that no successful analogical\ninference rule will ever be proposed. But consider the following\ncandidate, formulated using the concepts of schema (4) and taking us\nonly a short step beyond that basic characterization.  \n\nRule (5) is modeled on the\n straight rule for enumerative induction\nand inspired by Mill’s view of\nanalogical inference, as described in §2.3. \nWe use the generic phrase ‘degree of support’ in place of\nprobability, since other factors besides the analogical argument may\ninfluence our probability assignment for Q*. \n\nIt is pretty clear that (5) is a non-starter. The main problem\nis that the rule justifies too much. The only substantive\nrequirement introduced by (5) is that there be a nonempty positive\nanalogy. Plainly, there are analogical arguments that satisfy\nthis condition but establish no prima facie plausibility and\nno measure of support for their conclusions.  \n\nHere is a simple illustration. Achinstein (1964: 328) observes\nthat there is a formal analogy between swans and line segments if we\ntake the relation ‘has the same color as’ to correspond to\n‘is congruent with’. Both relations are reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive. Yet it would be absurd to find\npositive support from this analogy for the idea that we are likely to\nfind congruent lines clustered in groups of two or more, just because\nswans of the same color are commonly found in groups. The\npositive analogy is antecedently known to be irrelevant to the\nhypothetical analogy. In such a case, the analogical inference\nshould be utterly rejected. Yet rule (5) would wrongly assign\nnon-zero degree of support. \n\nTo generalize the difficulty: not every similarity increases\nthe probability of the conclusion and not every difference decreases\nit. Some similarities and differences are known to be (or\naccepted as being) utterly irrelevant and should have no influence\nwhatsoever on our probability judgments. To be viable, rule (5)\nwould need to be supplemented with considerations of\nrelevance, which depend upon the subject matter, historical\ncontext and logical details particular to each analogical\nargument. To search for a simple rule of analogical inference\nthus appears futile.  \n\nCarnap and his followers (Carnap 1980; Kuipers 1988; Niiniluoto 1988; Maher 2000; Romeijn 2006) have formulated principles of analogy for inductive logic, using Carnapian λγ rules. Generally, this body of work relates to “analogy by similarity”, rather than the type of analogical\nreasoning discussed here. Romeijn (2006) maintains that there is a relation between Carnap’s concept of analogy and analogical prediction. His approach is a hybrid of Carnap-style inductive rules and a Bayesian model. Such an approach would need to be generalized to handle the kinds of arguments described in §2.1. It remains unclear that the Carnapian approach can provide a general rule for analogical inference. \n\nNorton (2010, and 2018—see Other Internet Resources) has argued\nthat the project of formalizing inductive reasoning in terms of one or\nmore simple formal schemata is doomed. His criticisms seem especially\napt when applied to analogical reasoning. He writes:  \n\nIf analogical reasoning is required to conform only to a simple\nformal schema, the restriction is too permissive. Inferences are\nauthorized that clearly should not pass muster… The natural\nresponse has been to develop more elaborate formal\ntemplates… The familiar difficulty is that these\nembellished schema never seem to be quite embellished enough; there\nalways seems to be some part of the analysis that must be handled\nintuitively without guidance from strict formal rules. (2018: 1) \n\nNorton takes the point one step further, in keeping with his\n“material theory” of inductive inference. He argues that there is no universal logical principle that\n“powers” analogical inference “by asserting that\nthings that share some properties must share others.” \nRather, each analogical inference is warranted by some local\nconstellation of facts about the target system that he terms “the\nfact of analogy”. These local facts are to be determined\nand investigated on a case by case basis. \n\nTo embrace a purely formal approach to analogy and to abjure\nformalization entirely are two extremes in a spectrum of\nstrategies. There are intermediate positions. Most recent\nanalyses (both philosophical and computational) have been directed\ntowards elucidating criteria and procedures, rather than formal\nrules, for reasoning by analogy. So long as these are not\nintended to provide a universal ‘logic’ of analogy, there\nis room for such criteria even if one accepts Norton’s basic\npoint. The next section discusses some of these criteria and\nprocedures. \n\nLogicians and philosophers of science have identified\n‘textbook-style’ general guidelines for evaluating\nanalogical arguments (Mill 1843/1930; Keynes 1921; Robinson 1930;\nStebbing 1933; Copi and Cohen 2005; Moore and Parker 1998; Woods,\nIrvine, and Walton 2004). Here are some of the most\nimportant\nones: \n\nThese principles can be helpful, but are frequently too vague to\nprovide much insight. How do we count similarities and\ndifferences in applying (G1) and (G2)? Why are the structural and\ncausal analogies mentioned in (G5) and (G6) especially important, and\nwhich structural and causal features merit attention? More\ngenerally, in connection with the all-important (G7): how do we\ndetermine which similarities and differences are relevant to the\nconclusion? Furthermore, what are we to say about similarities\nand differences that have been omitted from an analogical argument but\nmight still be relevant? \n\nAn additional problem is that the criteria can pull in different\ndirections. To illustrate, consider Reid’s argument for\n life on other planets (Example 2).\nStebbing (1933) finds Reid’s argument\n“suggestive” and “not unplausible” because the\nconclusion is weak (G4), while Mill (1843/1930) appears to reject the\nargument on account of our vast ignorance of properties that might be\nrelevant (G3).  \n\nThere is a further problem that relates to the distinction just made\n(in §2.3) between two kinds of\nplausibility. Each of the above criteria apart from (G7) is\nexpressed in terms of the strength of the argument, i.e., the degree of\nsupport for the conclusion. The criteria thus appear to\npresuppose the probabilistic interpretation of\nplausibility. The problem is that a great many analogical\narguments aim to establish prima facie plausibility rather\nthan any degree of probability. Most of the guidelines are not\ndirectly applicable to such arguments. \n\nAristotle sets the stage for all later theories of analogical\nreasoning. In his theoretical reflections on analogy and in his\nmost judicious examples, we find a sober account that lays the\nfoundation both for the commonsense guidelines noted above and for more\nsophisticated analyses.  \n\nAlthough Aristotle employs the term analogy (analogia) and\ndiscusses\n analogical predication,\nhe never talks about analogical reasoning or\nanalogical arguments per se. He does, however, identify\ntwo argument forms, the argument from example\n(paradeigma) and the argument from likeness\n(homoiotes), both closely related to what would we now\nrecognize as an analogical argument. \n\nThe argument from example (paradeigma) is\ndescribed in the Rhetoric and the Prior\nAnalytics: \n\nEnthymemes based upon example are those which proceed from one or\nmore similar cases, arrive at a general proposition, and then argue\ndeductively to a particular inference. (Rhetoric\n1402b15) \n\nLet A be evil, B making war against neighbours, C Athenians against\nThebans, D Thebans against Phocians. If then we wish to prove\nthat to fight with the Thebans is an evil, we must assume that to fight\nagainst neighbours is an evil. Conviction of this is obtained\nfrom similar cases, e.g., that the war against the Phocians was an evil\nto the Thebans. Since then to fight against neighbours is an\nevil, and to fight against the Thebans is to fight against neighbours,\nit is clear that to fight against the Thebans is an evil. \n(Pr. An. 69a1) \n\nAristotle notes two differences between this argument form and\ninduction (69a15ff.): it “does not draw its proof from all\nthe particular cases” (i.e., it is not a “complete”\ninduction), and it requires an additional (deductively valid) syllogism\nas the final step. The argument from example thus amounts to\nsingle-case induction followed by deductive inference. It has the\nfollowing structure (using ⊃ for the conditional): Figure 2. \nIn the terminology of §2.2, P is the\npositive analogy and Q is the hypothetical analogy. In\nAristotle’s example, S (the source) is war between\nPhocians and Thebans, T (the target) is war between Athenians\nand Thebans, P is war between neighbours, and Q is\nevil. The first inference (dashed arrow) is inductive; the second\nand third (solid arrows) are deductively valid.  \n\nThe paradeigma has an interesting feature: it is\namenable to an alternative analysis as a purely deductive\nargument form. Let us concentrate on Aristotle’s assertion,\n“we must assume that to fight against neighbours is an\nevil,” represented as ∀x(P(x)\n⊃ Q(x)). Instead of regarding this\nintermediate step as something reached by induction from a single case,\nwe might instead regard it as a hidden presupposition. This\ntransforms the paradeigma into a syllogistic argument with a\nmissing or enthymematic premise, and our attention shifts to\npossible means for establishing that premise (with single-case\ninduction as one such means). Construed in this way,\nAristotle’s paradeigma argument foreshadows deductive\nanalyses of analogical reasoning (see\n§4.1).  \n\nThe argument from likeness (homoiotes) seems to be\ncloser than the paradeigma to our contemporary understanding\nof analogical arguments. This argument form receives considerable\nattention in Topics I, 17 and 18 and again in VIII, 1. \nThe most important passage is the following. \n\nTry to secure admissions by means of likeness; for such admissions\nare plausible, and the universal involved is less patent; e.g. that as\nknowledge and ignorance of contraries is the same, so too perception of\ncontraries is the same; or vice versa, that since the perception is the\nsame, so is the knowledge also. This argument resembles\ninduction, but is not the same thing; for in induction it is the\nuniversal whose admission is secured from the particulars, whereas in\narguments from likeness, what is secured is not the universal under\nwhich all the like cases fall. (Topics 156b10–17) \n\nThis passage occurs in a work that offers advice for framing\ndialectical arguments when confronting a somewhat skeptical\ninterlocutor. In such situations, it is best not to make\none’s argument depend upon securing agreement about any universal\nproposition. The argument from likeness is thus clearly distinct\nfrom the paradeigma, where the universal proposition plays an\nessential role as an intermediate step in the argument. The\nargument from likeness, though logically less straightforward than the\nparadeigma, is exactly the sort of analogical reasoning we\nwant when we are unsure about underlying generalizations.  \n\nIn Topics I 17, Aristotle states that any shared attribute\ncontributes some degree of likeness. It is natural to ask when the degree of likeness between two things is sufficiently great to warrant inferring a further likeness. In\nother words, when does the argument from likeness succeed? \nAristotle does not answer explicitly, but a clue is provided by the way\nhe justifies particular arguments from likeness. As Lloyd (1966)\nhas observed, Aristotle typically justifies such arguments by\narticulating a (sometimes vague) causal principle which governs the two phenomena being\ncompared. For example, Aristotle explains the saltiness of the\nsea, by analogy with the saltiness of sweat, as a kind of residual\nearthy stuff exuded in natural processes such as heating. The\ncommon principle is this: \n Everything that grows and is\nnaturally generated always leaves a residue, like that of things burnt,\nconsisting in this sort of earth. (Mete 358a17) \n \nFrom this method of justification, we might conjecture that Aristotle\nbelieves that the important similarities are those that\nenter into such general causal principles.  \n\nSummarizing, Aristotle’s theory provides us with four\nimportant and influential criteria for the evaluation of analogical\narguments: \n\nThese four principles form the core of a common-sense model\nfor evaluating analogical arguments (which is not to say that they are\ncorrect; indeed, the first three will shortly be called into\nquestion). The first, as we have seen, appears regularly in\ntextbook discussions of analogy. The second is largely taken for\ngranted, with important exceptions in computational models of analogy\n(§3.4). Versions of the third are found in\nmost sophisticated theories. The final point, which distinguishes\nthe argument from likeness and the argument from example, is endorsed\nin many discussions of analogy (e.g., Quine and Ullian 1970). \n\nA slight generalization of Aristotle’s first principle helps\nto prepare the way for discussion of later developments. As that\nprinciple suggests, Aristotle, in common with just about everyone else\nwho has written about analogical reasoning, organizes his analysis of\nthe argument form around overall similarity. In the terminology\nof section 2.2, horizontal relationships drive the\nreasoning: the greater the overall similarity of the two\ndomains, the stronger the analogical argument. Hume makes\nthe same point, though stated negatively, in his Dialogues\nConcerning Natural Religion: \nWherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of the cases,\nyou diminish proportionably the evidence; and may at last bring it to a\nvery weak analogy, which is confessedly liable to error and\nuncertainty. (1779/1947: 144) \n\nMost theories of analogy agree with Aristotle and Hume on this\ngeneral point. Disagreement relates to the appropriate way of\nmeasuring overall similarity. Some theories assign greatest\nweight to material analogy, which refers to shared, and\ntypically observable, features. Others give prominence to\nformal analogy, emphasizing high-level structural\ncorrespondence. The next two sub-sections discuss representative\naccounts that illustrate these two approaches. \n\nHesse (1966) offers a sharpened version of Aristotle’s theory,\nspecifically focused on analogical arguments in the sciences. She\nformulates three requirements that an analogical argument must satisfy\nin order to be acceptable: \n\nFor Hesse, an acceptable analogical argument must include\n“observable similarities” between domains, which she refers\nto as material analogy. Material analogy is contrasted\nwith formal analogy. Two domains are formally analogous\nif both are “interpretations of the same formal theory”\n(1966: 68). Nomic isomorphism (Hempel 1965) is a special case in which the physical laws governing two systems have identical mathematical form. Heat\nand fluid flow exhibit nomic isomorphism. A second example is the\nanalogy between the flow of electric current in a wire and fluid in a\npipe. Ohm’s law \n\nstates that voltage difference along a wire equals current times a\nconstant resistance. This has the same mathematical form as\nPoiseuille’s law (for ideal fluids): \n\nwhich states that the pressure difference along a pipe equals the\nvolumetric flow rate times a constant. Both of these systems can\nbe represented by a common equation. While formal analogy is linked to common mathematical structure, it should not be limited to nomic isomorphism (Bartha 2010: 209). The idea of formal analogy generalizes to cases where there is a common mathematical structure between models for two systems. Bartha offers an even more liberal definition (2010: 195): “Two features are formally similar if they occupy corresponding positions in formally analogous theories. For example, pitch in the theory of sound corresponds to color in the theory of light.”  \n\nBy contrast, material analogy consists of what Hesse calls\n“observable” or “pre-theoretic”\nsimilarities. These are horizontal relationships of similarity\nbetween properties of objects in the source and the target. \nSimilarities between echoes (sound) and reflection (light), for\ninstance, were recognized long before we had any detailed theories\nabout these phenomena. Hesse (1966, 1988) regards such\nsimilarities as metaphorical relationships between the two domains and\nlabels them “pre-theoretic” because they draw on personal\nand cultural experience. We have both material and formal analogies between sound and light, and it is significant for Hesse that the former are independent of the latter. \n\nThere are good reasons not to accept Hesse’s requirement of\nmaterial analogy, construed in this narrow way. First, it is\napparent that formal analogies are the starting point in many\nimportant inferences. That is certainly the case in mathematics,\na field in which material analogy, in Hesse’s sense, plays no\nrole at all. Analogical arguments based on formal analogy have\nalso been extremely influential in physics (Steiner 1989,\n1998).  \n\nIn Norton’s broad sense, however, ‘material\nanalogy’ simply refers to similarities rooted in factual\nknowledge of the source and target domains. With reference to\nthis broader meaning, Hesse proposes two additional material\ncriteria. \n\nHesse requires that the hypothetical analogy, the feature\ntransferred to the target domain, be causally related to the\npositive analogy. In her words, the essential requirement for a\ngood argument from analogy is “a tendency to\nco-occurrence”, i.e., a causal relationship. She states the\nrequirement as follows: \n\nThe vertical relations in the model [source] are causal relations in\nsome acceptable scientific sense, where there are no compelling a\npriori reasons for denying that causal relations of the same kind may\nhold between terms of the explanandum [target]. (1966: 87) \n\nThe causal condition rules out analogical arguments where there is\nno causal knowledge of the source domain. It derives support from\nthe observation that many analogies do appear to involve a transfer of\ncausal knowledge.  \n\nThe causal condition is on the right track, but is arguably too\nrestrictive. For example, it rules out analogical arguments in\nmathematics. Even if we limit attention to the empirical\nsciences, persuasive analogical arguments may be founded upon strong\nstatistical correlation in the absence of any known causal\nconnection. Consider\n(Example 11)\nBenjamin Franklin’s prediction, in 1749, that pointed metal rods would\nattract lightning, by analogy with the way they attracted the\n“electrical fluid” in the laboratory: \n\nElectrical fluid agrees with lightning in these particulars: \n1. Giving light. 2. Colour of the light. 3. \nCrooked direction. 4. Swift motion. 5. Being\nconducted by metals. 6. Crack or noise in exploding. \n7. Subsisting in water or ice. 8. Rending bodies it\npasses through. 9. Destroying animals. 10. \nMelting metals. 11. Firing inflammable substances. \n12. Sulphureous smell.—The electrical fluid is attracted\nby points.—We do not know whether this property is in\nlightning.—But since they agree in all the particulars\nwherein we can already compare them, is it not probable they agree\nlikewise in this? Let the experiment be made. (Benjamin\nFranklin’s Experiments, 334) \n\nFranklin’s hypothesis was based on a long list of properties\ncommon to the target (lightning) and source (electrical fluid in the\nlaboratory). There was no known causal connection between the\ntwelve “particulars” and the thirteenth property, but there\nwas a strong correlation. Analogical arguments may be plausible\neven where there are no known causal relations. \n\nHesse’s final requirement is that the “essential\nproperties and causal relations of the [source] have not been shown to\nbe part of the negative analogy” (1966: 91). Hesse does not\nprovide a definition of “essential,” but suggests that a\nproperty or relation is essential if it is “causally closely\nrelated to the known positive analogy.” For instance, an\nanalogy with fluid flow was extremely influential in developing the\ntheory of heat conduction. Once it was discovered that heat was\nnot conserved, however, the analogy became unacceptable (according to\nHesse) because conservation was so central to the theory of fluid\nflow.  \n\nThis requirement, though once again on the right track, seems too\nrestrictive. It can lead to the rejection of a good analogical\nargument. Consider the analogy between a two-dimensional rectangle and\na three-dimensional box\n (Example 7).\n  Broadening Hesse’s notion, it seems that there\nare many ‘essential’ differences between rectangles and\nboxes. This does not mean that we should reject every analogy between\nrectangles and boxes out of hand. The problem derives from the fact\nthat Hesse’s condition is applied to the analogy relation\nindependently of the use to which that relation is put. What counts as\nessential should vary with the analogical argument. Absent an\ninferential context, it is impossible to evaluate the importance or\n‘essentiality’ of similarities and differences.  \n\nDespite these weaknesses, Hesse’s ‘material’\ncriteria constitute a significant advance in our understanding of\nanalogical reasoning. The causal condition and the\nno-essential-difference condition incorporate local factors, as urged\nby Norton, into the assessment of analogical arguments. These\nconditions, singly or taken together, imply that an analogical argument\ncan fail to generate any support for its conclusion, even when there is\na non-empty positive analogy. Hesse offers no theory about the\n‘degree’ of analogical support. That makes her\naccount one of the few that is oriented towards the modal, rather than\nprobabilistic, use of analogical arguments\n(§2.3). \n\nMany people take the concept of\n model-theoretic isomorphism\nto set the standard for thinking about similarity and\nits role in analogical reasoning. They propose formal\ncriteria for evaluating analogies, based on overall structural or\nsyntactical similarity. Let us refer to theories oriented around\nsuch criteria as structuralist. \n\nA number of leading computational models of analogy are\nstructuralist. They are implemented in computer programs that\nbegin with (or sometimes build) representations of the source and\ntarget domains, and then construct possible analogy mappings. \nAnalogical inferences emerge as a consequence of identifying the\n‘best mapping.’ In terms of criteria for analogical\nreasoning, there are two main ideas. First, the goodness of an\nanalogical argument is based on the goodness of the associated\nanalogy mapping. Second, the goodness of the analogy\nmapping is given by a metric that indicates how closely it approximates\nisomorphism.  \n\nThe most influential structuralist theory has been Gentner’s\nstructure-mapping theory, implemented in a program called the\nstructure-mapping engine (SME). In its original form\n(Gentner 1983), the theory assesses analogies on purely structural\ngrounds. Gentner asserts:  \n\nAnalogies are about relations, rather than simple features. No\nmatter what kind of knowledge (causal models, plans, stories, etc.), it\nis the structural properties (i.e., the interrelationships between the\nfacts) that determine the content of an analogy. (Falkenhainer,\nForbus, and Gentner 1989/90: 3) \n\nIn order to clarify this thesis, Gentner introduces a distinction\nbetween properties, or monadic predicates, and\nrelations, which have multiple arguments. She further\ndistinguishes among different orders of relations and\nfunctions, defined inductively (in terms of the order of the relata or arguments). The best mapping is determined by\nsystematicity: the extent to which it places\nhigher-order relations, and items that are nested in higher-order\nrelations, in correspondence. Gentner’s Systematicity Principle states: \n\n A\npredicate that belongs to a mappable system of mutually interconnecting\nrelationships is more likely to be imported into the target than is an\nisolated predicate. (1983: 163) \n\nA systematic analogy (one that places high-order relations and their\ncomponents in correspondence) is better than a less systematic\nanalogy. Hence, an analogical inference has a degree of\nplausibility that increases monotonically with the degree of\nsystematicity of the associated analogy mapping. Gentner’s\nfundamental criterion for evaluating candidate analogies (and\nanalogical inferences) thus depends solely upon the syntax of the given\nrepresentations and not at all upon their content. \n\nLater versions of the structure-mapping theory incorporate\nrefinements (Forbus, Ferguson, and Gentner 1994;\nForbus 2001; Forbus et al. 2007; Forbus et al. 2008; Forbus et al 2017). For example, the earliest version of the theory is vulnerable to worries about hand-coded representations of source and target domains. Gentner and her colleagues have attempted to solve this problem in later work that generates LISP representations from natural language text (see (Tunney 2008) for a different approach).  \n\nThe most important challenges for the structure-mapping approach relate to the Systematicity Principle itself. Does the value of an analogy derive\nentirely, or even chiefly, from systematicity? There appear to be\ntwo main difficulties with this view. First: it is not always appropriate to give priority to systematic, high-level relational matches. Material criteria, and\nnotably what Gentner refers to as “superficial feature\nmatches,” can be extremely important in some types of analogical\nreasoning, such as ethnographic analogies which are based, to a considerable degree, on surface resemblances between artifacts. Second and more significantly: systematicity seems to be at best a fallible marker for good analogies rather than the\nessence of good analogical reasoning.  \n\nGreater systematicity is neither necessary nor sufficient for a more plausible analogical\ninference. It is obvious that increased systematicity is not sufficient for increased plausibility. An implausible analogy can be represented in a form that exhibits a high degree of structural parallelism. High-order relations can come cheap, as\nwe saw with Achinstein’s “swan” example\n(§2.4).  \n\nMore pointedly, increased systematicity is not necessary\nfor greater plausibility. Indeed, in causal analogies, it may\neven weaken the inference. That is because systematicity\ntakes no account of the type of causal relevance, positive or negative. (McKay 1993) notes that microbes have been found in frozen lakes in Antarctica; by analogy, simple life forms might exist on\nMars. Freezing temperatures are preventive or counteracting\ncauses; they are negatively relevant to the existence of\nlife. The climate of Mars was probably more favorable to\nlife 3.5 billion years ago than it is today, because temperatures were\nwarmer. Yet the analogy between Antarctica and present-day Mars\nis more systematic than the analogy between Antarctica and\nancient Mars. According to the Systematicity Principle,\nthe analogy with Antarctica provides stronger support for life on\nMars today than it does for life on ancient Mars.  \n\nThe point of this example is that increased\nsystematicity does not always increase plausibility, and reduced\nsystematicity does not always decrease it (see Lee and Holyoak 2008). \nThe more general point is that systematicity can be misleading, unless\nwe take into account the nature of the relationships between\nvarious factors and the hypothetical analogy. Systematicity does not\nmagically produce or explain the plausibility of an analogical\nargument. When we reason by analogy, we must determine which\nfeatures of both domains are relevant and how they relate to\nthe analogical conclusion. There is no short-cut via\nsyntax.  \n\nSchlimm (2008) offers an entirely different critique of the\nstructure-mapping theory from the perspective of analogical reasoning\nin mathematics—a domain where one might expect a formal\napproach such as structure mapping to perform well. \nSchlimm introduces a simple distinction: a domain is\nobject-rich if the number of objects is greater than the\nnumber of relations (and properties), and relation-rich\notherwise. Proponents of the structure-mapping theory typically\nfocus on relation-rich examples (such as the analogy between the solar\nsystem and the atom). By contrast, analogies in mathematics\ntypically involve domains with an enormous number of objects (like the\nreal numbers), but relatively few relations and functions (addition, multiplication,\nless-than).  \n\nSchlimm provides an example of an analogical reasoning problem in\ngroup theory that involves a single relation in each domain. In\nthis case, attaining maximal systematicity is trivial. The\ndifficulty is that, compatible with maximal systematicity, there are\ndifferent ways in which the objects might be placed in\ncorrespondence. The structure-mapping theory appears to yield the\nwrong inference. We might put the general point as follows: \nin object-rich domains, systematicity ceases to be a reliable\nguide to plausible analogical inference. \n\nDuring the past thirty-five years, cognitive scientists have conducted\nextensive research on analogy. Gentner’s SME is just one of\nmany computational theories, implemented in programs that construct and\nuse analogies. Three helpful anthologies that span this period\nare Helman 1988; Gentner, Holyoak, and Kokinov 2001; and Kokinov,\nHolyoak, and Gentner 2009.  \n\nOne predominant objective of this research has been to model the\ncognitive processes involved in using analogies. Early models\ntended to be oriented towards “understanding the basic\nconstraints that govern human analogical thinking” (Hummel and\nHolyoak 1997: 458). Recent connectionist models have been\ndirected towards uncovering the psychological mechanisms that come into\nplay when we use analogies: retrieval of a relevant\nsource domain, analogical mapping across\ndomains, and transfer of information and learning of\nnew categories or schemas.  \n\nIn some cases, such as the structure-mapping theory\n(§3.4), this research overlaps directly with the\nnormative questions that are the focus of this entry; indeed, Gentner’s Systematicity Principle may be interpreted normatively. In other\ncases, we might view the projects as displacing those\ntraditional normative questions with up-to-date, computational forms\nof\nnaturalized epistemology.\nTwo approaches are singled out here because\nboth raise important challenges to the very idea of finding sharp\nanswers to those questions, and both suggest that connectionist models\noffer a more fruitful approach to understanding analogical\nreasoning. \n\nThe first is the constraint-satisfaction\nmodel (also known as the multiconstraint\ntheory), developed by Holyoak and Thagard (1989,\n1995). Like Gentner, Holyoak and Thagard regard the heart of\nanalogical reasoning as analogy mapping, and they stress the\nimportance of systematicity, which they refer to as a\nstructural constraint. Unlike Gentner, they acknowledge\ntwo additional types of constraints. Pragmatic\nconstraints take into account the goals and purposes of the agent,\nrecognizing that “the purpose will guide selection” of\nrelevant similarities. Semantic constraints represent\nestimates of the degree to which people regard source and target items\nas being alike, rather like Hesse’s “pre-theoretic”\nsimilarities.  \n\nThe novelty of the multiconstraint theory is that these\nstructural, semantic and pragmatic\nconstraints are implemented not as rigid rules, but rather as\n‘pressures’ supporting or inhibiting potential pairwise\ncorrespondences. The theory is implemented in a connectionist\nprogram called ACME (Analogical Constraint\nMapping Engine), which assigns an initial activation value to each\npossible pairing between elements in the source and target domains\n(based on semantic and pragmatic constraints), and then runs through\ncycles that update the activation values based on overall coherence\n(structural constraints). The best global analogy mapping emerges\nunder the pressure of these constraints. Subsequent connectionist\nmodels, such as Hummel and Holyoak’s LISA program (1997, 2003),\nhave made significant advances and hold promise for offering a more\ncomplete theory of analogical reasoning. \n\nThe second example is Hofstadter and Mitchell’s Copycat program (Hofstadter 1995; Mitchell 1993). The program is “designed to discover\ninsightful analogies, and to do so in a psychologically realistic\nway” (Hofstadter 1995: 205). Copycat operates in the domain\nof letter-strings. The program handles the following type of\nproblem:  \n\nSuppose the letter-string abc were changed to abd;\nhow would you change the letter-string ijk in “the same\nway”? \n\nMost people would answer ijl, since it is natural to think\nthat abc was changed to abd by the\n“transformation rule”: replace the rightmost letter\nwith its successor. Alternative answers are possible, but do not agree with most\npeople’s sense of what counts as the natural analogy. \n\nHofstadter and Mitchell believe that analogy-making is in large part about the\nperception of novel patterns, and that such perception\nrequires concepts with “fluid” boundaries. Genuine\nanalogy-making involves “slippage” of concepts. The\nCopycat program combines a set of core concepts pertaining to\nletter-sequences (successor, leftmost and so forth)\nwith probabilistic “halos” that link distinct concepts\ndynamically. Orderly\nstructures emerge out of random low-level processes and the program produces plausible\nsolutions. Copycat thus shows\nthat analogy-making can be modeled as a process akin to perception,\neven if the program employs mechanisms distinct from those in human\nperception.  \n\nThe multiconstraint theory and Copycat share the idea that analogical\ncognition involves cognitive processes that operate below the level of\nabstract reasoning. Both computational models—to the extent that\nthey are capable of performing successful analogical\nreasoning—challenge the idea that a successful model of\nanalogical reasoning must take the form of a set of quasi-logical\ncriteria. Efforts to develop a quasi-logical\ntheory of analogical reasoning, it might be argued, have\nfailed. In place of faulty inference schemes such as those\ndescribed earlier (§2.2, §2.4),\ncomputational models substitute procedures that can be\njudged on their performance rather than on traditional philosophical\nstandards.   \n\nIn response to this argument, we should recognize the value of the\nconnectionist models while acknowledging that we still need a\ntheory that offers normative principles for\nevaluating analogical arguments. In the first place, even if the\nconstruction and recognition of analogies are largely a matter of\nperception, this does not eliminate the need for subsequent critical evaluation of\nanalogical inferences. Second and more importantly, we need to look not\njust at the construction of analogy mappings but at the ways in which\nindividual analogical arguments are debated in fields such\nas mathematics, physics, philosophy and the law. These high-level\ndebates require reasoning that bears little resemblance to the\ncomputational processes of ACME or Copycat. (Ashley’s HYPO\n(Ashley 1990) is one example of a non-connectionist program that\nfocuses on this aspect of analogical reasoning.) There is,\naccordingly, room for both computational and traditional philosophical\nmodels of analogical reasoning. \n\nMost prominent theories of analogy, philosophical and computational,\nare based on overall similarity between source and target\ndomains—defined in terms of some favoured subset of Hesse’s\nhorizontal relations (see §2.2). \nAristotle and Mill, whose approach is echoed in textbook discussions,\nsuggest counting similarities. Hesse’s theory\n(§3.3) favours “pre-theoretic”\ncorrespondences. The structure-mapping theory and its successors\n(§3.4) look to systematicity, i.e., to\ncorrespondences involving complex, high-level networks of\nrelations. In each of these approaches, the problem is\ntwofold: overall similarity is not a reliable guide to\nplausibility, and it fails to explain the plausibility of any\nanalogical argument. \n\nBartha’s articulation model (2010)\nproposes a different approach, beginning not with horizontal relations,\nbut rather with a classification of analogical arguments on the basis\nof the vertical relations within each domain. The\nfundamental idea is that a good analogical argument must satisfy two\nconditions: \nPrior Association.\nThere must be a clear connection, in the source domain, between the\nknown similarities (the positive analogy) and the further similarity\nthat is projected to hold in the target domain (the hypothetical\nanalogy). This relationship determines which features of the source\nare critical to the analogical inference.\n \nPotential for Generalization.\nThere must be reason to think that the same kind of connection could\nobtain in the target domain. More pointedly: there must be\nno critical disanalogy between the domains.\n \n\nThe first order of business is to make the prior association\nexplicit. The standards of explicitness vary depending on the\nnature of this association (causal relation, mathematical proof,\nfunctional relationship, and so forth). The two general\nprinciples are fleshed out via a set of subordinate models that allow\nus to identify critical features and hence critical disanalogies. \n\n To see how this works, consider Example 7\n(Rectangles and boxes). In this analogical argument,\nthe source domain is two-dimensional geometry: we know that of\nall rectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square has maximum\narea. The target domain is three-dimensional geometry: by\nanalogy, we conjecture that of all boxes with a fixed surface area, the\ncube has maximum volume. This argument should be evaluated\nnot by counting similarities, looking to pre-theoretic\nresemblances between rectangles and boxes, or constructing\nconnectionist representations of the domains and computing a\nsystematicity score for possible mappings. Instead, we should\nbegin with a precise articulation of the prior association in the\nsource domain, which amounts to a specific proof for the result about\nrectangles. We should then identify, relative to that proof, the\ncritical features of the source domain: namely, the concepts and\nassumptions used in the proof. Finally, we should assess the\npotential for generalization: whether, in the three-dimensional\nsetting, those critical features are known to lack analogues in the\ntarget domain. The articulation model is meant to reflect the\nconversations that can and do take place between an advocate\nand a critic of an analogical argument.  \n\nAs noted in §2.4, Norton rejects analogical inference rules. But even if we agree with Norton on this point, we might still be interested in having an account that gives us guidelines for evaluating analogical arguments. How does Norton’s approach fare on this score? \n\nAccording to Norton, each analogical argument is warranted by local facts that must be investigated and justified empirically. First, there is “the fact of the analogy”: in practice, a low-level uniformity that embraces both the source and target systems. Second, there are additional factual properties of the target system which, when taken together with the uniformity, warrant the analogical inference. Consider Galileo’s famous inference \n(Example 12) that there are mountains on the moon (Galileo 1610). Through his newly invented telescope, Galileo observed points of light on the moon ahead of the advancing edge of sunlight. Noting that the same thing happens on earth when sunlight strikes the mountains, he concluded that there must be mountains on the moon and even provided a reasonable estimate of their height. In this example, Norton tells us, the the fact of the analogy is that shadows and other optical phenomena are generated in the same way on the earth and on the moon; the additional fact about the target is the existence of points of light ahead of the advancing edge of sunlight on the moon. \n\nWhat are the implications of Norton’s material theory when it comes to evaluating analogical arguments? The fact of the analogy is a local uniformity that powers the inference. Norton’s theory works well when such a uniformity is patent or naturally inferred. It doesn’t work well when the uniformity is itself the target (rather than the driver) of the inference. That happens with explanatory analogies such as Example 5 (the Acoustical Analogy), and mathematical analogies such as Example 7 (Rectangles and Boxes). Similarly, the theory doesn’t work well when the underlying uniformity is unclear, as in Example 2 (Life on other Planets), Example 4 (Clay Pots), and many other cases. In short, if Norton’s theory is accepted, then for most analogical arguments there are no useful evaluation criteria.  \n\nFor those who sympathize with Norton’s skepticism about universal inductive schemes and theories of analogical reasoning, yet recognize that his approach may be too local, an appealing strategy is to move up one level. We can aim for field-specific “working logics” (Toulmin 1958; Wylie and Chapman 2016; Reiss 2015). This approach has been adopted by philosophers of archaeology, evolutionary biology and other historical sciences (Wylie and Chapman 2016; Currie 2013; Currie 2016; Currie 2018). In place of schemas, we find ‘toolkits’, i.e., lists of criteria for evaluating analogical reasoning.  \n\nFor example, Currie (2016) explores in detail the use of ethnographic analogy \n(Example 13) between shamanastic motifs used by the contemporary San people and similar motifs in ancient rock art, found both among ancestors of the San (direct historical analogy) and in European rock art (indirect historical analogy). Analogical arguments support the hypothesis that in each of these cultures, rock art symbolizes hallucinogenic experiences. Currie examines criteria that focus on assumptions about stability of cultural traits and environment-culture relationships. Currie (2016, 2018) and Wylie (Wylie and Chapman 2016) also stress the importance of robustness reasoning that combines analogical arguments of moderate strength with other forms of evidence to yield strong conclusions. \n\nPractice-based approaches can thus yield specific guidelines unlikely to be matched by any general theory of analogical reasoning. One caveat is worth mentioning. Field-specific criteria for ethnographic analogy are elicited against a background of decades of methodological controversy (Wylie and Chapman 2016). Critics and defenders of ethnographic analogy have appealed to general models of scientific method (e.g., hypothetico-deductive method or Bayesian confirmation). To advance the methodological debate, practice-based approaches must either make connections to these general models or explain why the lack of any such connection is unproblematic. \n\nClose attention to analogical arguments in practice can also provide valuable challenges to general ideas about analogical inference. In an interesting discussion, Steiner (1989, 1998) suggests that\nmany of the analogies that played a major role in early\ntwentieth-century physics count as “Pythagorean.” The\nterm is meant to connote mathematical mysticism: a\n“Pythagorean” analogy is a purely formal analogy, one founded on mathematical\nsimilarities that have no known physical basis at the time it is\nproposed. One example is Schrödinger’s use of analogy \n(Example 14) to “guess” the form of the relativistic wave\nequation. In Steiner’s view, Schrödinger’s\nreasoning relies upon manipulations and substitutions based on purely\nmathematical analogies. Steiner argues that the success, and even\nthe plausibility, of such analogies “evokes, or should evoke,\npuzzlement” (1989: 454). Both Hesse (1966) and Bartha (2010) reject the idea that a purely formal analogy, with no physical significance, can support a plausible analogical inference in physics. Thus, Steiner’s arguments provide a serious challenge.   \n\nBartha (2010) suggests a response: we can decompose Steiner’s examples into two or more steps, and then establish that at least one step does, in fact, have a physical basis. Fraser (forthcoming), however, offers a counterexample that supports Steiner’s position. Complex analogies between classical statistical mechanics (CSM) and quantum field theory (QFT) have played a crucial role in the development and application of renormalization group (RG) methods in both theories \n(Example 15). Fraser notes substantial physical disanalogies between CSM and QFT, and concludes that the reasoning is based entirely on formal analogies. \n\nWhat philosophical basis can be provided for reasoning by\nanalogy? What justification can be given for the claim that\nanalogical arguments deliver plausible conclusions? There have been several ideas for answering this question. One natural strategy assimilates analogical reasoning\nto some other well-understood argument pattern, a form of deductive or\ninductive reasoning (§4.1,\n§4.2). A few philosophers have explored the\npossibility of a priori justification\n(§4.3). A pragmatic justification may be\navailable for practical applications of analogy, notably in legal\nreasoning (§4.4). \n\nAny attempt to provide a general justification for analogical\nreasoning faces a basic dilemma. The demands of generality\nrequire a high-level formulation of the problem and hence an abstract\ncharacterization of analogical arguments, such as schema (4). On\nthe other hand, as noted previously, many analogical arguments that\nconform to schema (4) are bad arguments. So a general\njustification of analogical reasoning cannot provide support for all\narguments that conform to (4), on pain of proving too much. \nInstead, it must first specify a subset of putatively\n‘good’ analogical arguments, and link the general\njustification to this specified subset. The problem of\njustification is linked to the problem of characterizing good\nanalogical arguments. This difficulty afflicts some of the strategies described in this section. \n\nAnalogical reasoning may be cast in a deductive mold. \nIf successful, this strategy neatly solves the problem of\njustification. A valid deductive argument is as good as it\ngets. \n\nAn early version of the deductivist approach is exemplified by\nAristotle’s treatment of the argument from example\n(§3.2), the paradeigma. On this\nanalysis, an analogical argument between source domain S and\ntarget T begins with the assumption of positive analogy\nP(S) and P(T), as well as the\nadditional information Q(S). It proceeds via\nthe generalization ∀x(P(x) ⊃\nQ(x)) to the conclusion: \nQ(T). Provided we can treat that intermediate\ngeneralization as an independent premise, we have a deductively valid\nargument. Notice, though, that the existence of the\ngeneralization renders the analogy irrelevant. We can derive\nQ(T) from the generalization and\nP(T), without any knowledge of the source domain. The literature on analogy in argumentation theory (§2.2) offers further perspectives on this type of analysis, and on the question of whether analogical arguments are properly characterized as deductive. \n\nSome recent analyses follow Aristotle in treating analogical\narguments as reliant upon extra (sometimes tacit) premises, typically\ndrawn from background knowledge, that convert the inference into a\ndeductively valid argument––but without making the source domain irrelevant. Davies and Russell introduce a\nversion that relies upon what they call determination rules\n(Russell 1986; Davies and Russell 1987; Davies 1988). Suppose\nthat Q and\nP1, …, Pm are\nvariables, and we have background knowledge that the value of\nQ is determined by the values of\nP1, …, Pm. In the\nsimplest case, where m = 1 and both P and\nQ are binary Boolean variables, this reduces to \ni.e., whether or not P holds determines whether or\nnot Q holds. More generally, the form of a\ndetermination rule is \n\ni.e., Q is a function of P1, …,\nPm. If we assume such a rule as part of our\nbackground knowledge, then an analogical argument with conclusion\nQ(T) is deductively valid. More precisely, and\nallowing for the case where Q is not a binary variable: \nif we have such a rule, and also premises stating that the source\nS agrees with the target T on all of the values\nPi, then we may validly infer that\nQ(T) = Q(S).  \n\nThe “determination rule” analysis provides a clear and\nsimple justification for analogical reasoning. Note that, in\ncontrast to the Aristotelian analysis via the generalization\n∀x(P(x) ⊃ Q(x)), a\ndetermination rule does not trivialize the analogical argument. \nOnly by combining the rule with information about the source domain can\nwe derive the value of Q(T). To illustrate by\nadapting one of the examples given by Russell and Davies \n(Example 16), let’s\nsuppose that the value (Q) of a used car (relative to a\nparticular buyer) is determined by its year, make, mileage, condition,\ncolor and accident history (the variables\nPi). It doesn’t matter if one or more\nof these factors are redundant or irrelevant. Provided two cars\nare indistinguishable on each of these points, they will have the same\nvalue. Knowledge of the source domain is necessary; we\ncan’t derive the value of the second car from the determination\nrule alone. Weitzenfeld (1984) proposes a variant of this approach, advancing\nthe slightly more general thesis that analogical arguments are\ndeductive arguments with a missing (enthymematic) premise that\namounts to a determination rule. \n\nDo determination rules give us a solution to the problem of\nproviding a justification for analogical arguments? In general:\nno. Analogies are commonly applied to problems such as \n Example 8 (morphine and meperidine), where we are not even aware of all relevant factors, let alone in possession of a determination rule. Medical researchers conduct drug\ntests on animals without knowing all attributes that might be relevant\nto the effects of the drug. Indeed, one of the main objectives of such\ntesting is to guard against reactions unanticipated by theory. On the\n“determination rule” analysis, we must either limit the\nscope of such arguments to cases where we have a well-supported\ndetermination rule, or focus attention on formulating and justifying\nan appropriate determination rule. For cases such as animal testing,\nneither option seems realistic.  \n\nRecasting analogy as a deductive argument may help to\nbring out background assumptions, but it makes little headway with the\nproblem of justification. That problem re-appears as the need to state and establish the plausibility of a determination rule, and that is at\nleast as difficult as justifying the original analogical argument. \n\nSome philosophers have attempted to portray, and justify, analogical\nreasoning in terms of some well-understood inductive argument pattern. There have been three moderately popular versions of this\nstrategy. The first treats analogical reasoning as generalization\nfrom a single case. The second treats it as a kind of sampling\nargument. The third recognizes the\nargument from analogy as a distinctive form, but treats past\nsuccesses as evidence for future success. \n\nLet’s reconsider Aristotle’s argument from example or\nparadeigma (§3.2), but this time regard\nthe generalization as justified via induction from a single case (the\nsource domain). Can such a simple analysis of analogical\narguments succeed? In general: no. \n\nA single instance can sometimes lead to a justified\ngeneralization. Cartwright (1992) argues that we can sometimes\ngeneralize from a single careful experiment, “where we have\nsufficient control of the materials and our knowledge of the requisite\nbackground assumptions is secure” (51). Cartwright thinks\nthat we can do this, for example, in experiments with compounds \nthat have stable “Aristotelian natures.” In a similar\nspirit, Quine (1969) maintains that we can have instantial confirmation\nwhen dealing with natural kinds.  \n\nEven if we accept that there are such cases, the objection to\nunderstanding all analogical arguments as single-case induction is obvious: the view is simply too restrictive. Most\nanalogical arguments will not meet the requisite conditions. We\nmay not know that we are dealing with a natural kind or Aristotelian\nnature when we make the analogical argument. We may not know which\nproperties are essential. An insistence on the ‘single-case induction’\nanalysis of analogical reasoning is likely to lead to skepticism\n(Agassi 1964, 1988). \n\nInterpreting the argument from analogy as single-case induction is\nalso counter-productive in another way. The simplistic\nanalysis does nothing to advance the search for criteria that help us\nto distinguish between relevant and irrelevant similarities, and hence\nbetween good and bad analogical arguments.  \n\nOn the sampling conception of analogical arguments, acknowledged\nsimilarities between two domains are treated as statistically relevant\nevidence for further similarities. The simplest version of the sampling argument is due to Mill (1843/1930). An argument from analogy, he writes, is “a\ncompetition between the known points of agreement and the known points\nof difference.” Agreement of A and B in 9\nout of 10 properties implies a probability of 0.9 that B will\npossess any other property of A: “we can\nreasonably expect resemblance in the same proportion”\n(367). His only restriction has to do with sample size: we\nmust be relatively knowledgeable about both A and\nB. Mill saw no difficulty in using analogical reasoning\nto infer characteristics of newly discovered species of plants or\nanimals, given our extensive knowledge of botany and zoology. But\nif the extent of unascertained properties of A and B\nis large, similarity in a small sample would not be a reliable guide;\nhence, Mill’s dismissal of Reid’s argument about life on\n other planets (Example 2).  \n\nThe sampling argument is presented in more explicit mathematical\nform by Harrod (1956). The key idea is that the known properties\nof S (the source domain) may be considered a random sample of\nall S’s properties—random, that is, with respect\nto the attribute of also belonging to T (the target\ndomain). If the majority of known properties that belong to\nS also belong to T, then we should expect most other\nproperties of S to belong to T, for it is unlikely\nthat we would have come to know just the common properties. In effect, Harrod proposes a binomial distribution, modeling ‘random selection’ of properties on random selection of balls from an urn. \n\nThere are grave difficulties with Harrod’s and Mill’s\nanalyses. One obvious difficulty is the counting\nproblem: the ‘population’ of\nproperties is poorly defined. How are we to count similarities\nand differences? The ratio of shared to total known properties\nvaries dramatically according to how we do this. A second serious difficulty is the problem of bias: we cannot justify the assumption that the sample of known features is random. In the case of the urn, the selection\nprocess is arranged so that the result of each choice is not influenced\nby the agent’s intentions or purposes, or by prior choices. \nBy contrast, the presentation of an analogical argument\nis always partisan. Bias enters into the initial representation\nof similarities and differences: an advocate of the argument will\nhighlight similarities, while a critic will play up differences. The paradigm of repeated selection from an urn seems totally inappropriate. Additional variations of the sampling approach have been developed (e.g., Russell 1988), but ultimately these versions also fail to solve either the counting problem or the problem of bias. \n\nSection 3.6 discussed Steiner’s view that appeal to ‘Pythagorean’ analogies in physics “evokes, or should evoke,\npuzzlement” (1989: 454). Liston (2000) offers a possible response:   physicists are entitled to use Pythagorean analogies on the basis of induction from their\npast success: \n[The scientist] can admit that no one\nknows how [Pythagorean] reasoning works and argue that the very fact\nthat similar strategies have worked well in the past is already reason\nenough to continue pursuing them hoping for success in the present\ninstance. (200)  \n\nSetting aside familiar worries about arguments from success, the\nreal problem here is to determine what counts as a similar\nstrategy. In essence, that amounts to isolating the features of\nsuccessful Pythagorean analogies. As we have seen (§2.4),\nnobody has yet provided a satisfactory scheme that characterizes\nsuccessful analogical arguments, let alone successful Pythagorean analogical arguments.  \n\nAn a priori approach traces the validity of a pattern of\nanalogical reasoning, or of a particular analogical argument, to some\nbroad and fundamental principle. Three such approaches will be\noutlined here. \n\nThe first is due to Keynes (1921). Keynes appeals to his famous Principle of the Limitation of Independent\nVariety, which he articulates as follows: \nArmed with this Principle and some additional assumptions, Keynes is\nable to show that in cases where there is no negative\nanalogy, knowledge of the positive analogy increases the\n(logical) probability of the conclusion. If there is a non-trivial\nnegative analogy, however, then the probability of the conclusion\nremains unchanged, as was pointed out by Hesse (1966). Those familiar\nwith Carnap’s theory of logical probability will recognize that\nin setting up his framework, Keynes settled on a measure that permits\nno learning from experience.  \n\nHesse offers a refinement of Keynes’s strategy, once again along Carnapian lines. In her (1974), she proposes what she calls the Clustering Postulate: the\nassumption that our epistemic probability function has a\nbuilt-in bias towards generalization. The objections to such postulates of\nuniformity are well-known (see Salmon 1967), but even if we waive\nthem, her argument fails. The main objection here—which also\napplies to Keynes—is that a purely syntactic axiom such as the Clustering Postulate fails to discriminate between analogical arguments that are good and those that are clearly without value (according to Hesse’s own material criteria, for example).  \n\nA different a priori strategy, proposed by Bartha\n(2010), limits the scope of justification to analogical arguments that\nsatisfy tentative criteria for ‘good’ analogical\nreasoning. The criteria are those specified by the articulation\nmodel (§3.5). In simplified form, they\nrequire the existence of non-trivial positive analogy and no known\ncritical disanalogy. The scope of Bartha’s\nargument is also limited to analogical arguments directed at\nestablishing prima facie plausibility, rather than\ndegree of probability.  \n\nBartha’s argument rests on a principle of symmetry\nreasoning articulated by van Fraassen (1989: 236): \n“problems which are essentially the same must receive essentially\nthe same solution.” A modal extension of this principle\nruns roughly as follows: if problems might be\nessentially the same, then they might have essentially the\nsame solution. There are two modalities here. Bartha argues\nthat satisfaction of the criteria of the articulation model is\nsufficient to establish the modality in the antecedent, i.e., that the\nsource and target domains ‘might be essentially the same’\nin relevant respects. He further suggests that prima\nfacie plausibility provides a reasonable reading of the modality\nin the consequent, i.e., that the problems in the two domains\n‘might have essentially the same solution.’ To call a\nhypothesis prima facie plausible is to elevate it to the point\nwhere it merits investigation, since it might be\ncorrect. \n\nThe argument is vulnerable to two sorts of concerns. \nFirst, there are questions about the interpretation of the\nsymmetry principle. Second, there is a\nresidual worry that this justification, like all the others,\nproves too much. The articulation model may be too\nvague or too permissive. \n\nArguably, the most promising available defense of analogical\nreasoning may be found in its application to case law (see\n Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning).\nJudicial decisions are based\non the verdicts and reasoning that have governed relevantly similar\ncases, according to the doctrine of stare decisis (Levi 1949;\nLlewellyn 1960; Cross and Harris 1991; Sunstein 1993). Individual\ndecisions by a court are binding on that court and lower\ncourts; judges are obligated to decide future cases ‘in the same\nway.’ That is, the reasoning applied in an individual\ndecision, referred to as the ratio decidendi, must be applied\n to similar future cases (see Example 10).\nIn practice, of course, the situation is extremely\ncomplex. No two cases are identical. The ratio\nmust be understood in the context of the facts of the original case,\nand there is considerable room for debate about its generality and its\napplicability to future cases. If a consensus emerges that a past\ncase was wrongly decided, later judgments will distinguish it\nfrom new cases, effectively restricting the scope of the ratio\nto the original case. \n\nThe practice of following precedent can be justified by two main\npractical considerations. First, and above all, the practice is\nconservative: it provides a relatively stable basis for\nreplicable decisions. People need to be able to predict the\nactions of the courts and formulate plans accordingly. Stare\ndecisis serves as a check against arbitrary judicial\ndecisions. Second, the practice is still reasonably\nprogressive: it allows for the gradual evolution of the\nlaw. Careful judges distinguish bad decisions; new values and a\nnew consensus can emerge in a series of decisions over time.  \n\nIn theory, then, stare decisis strikes a healthy balance\nbetween conservative and progressive social values. This\njustification is pragmatic. It pre-supposes a common set of\nsocial values, and links the use of analogical reasoning to optimal\npromotion of those values. Notice also that justification occurs\nat the level of the practice in general; individual analogical\narguments sometimes go astray. A full examination of the nature\nand foundations for stare decisis is beyond the scope of this\nentry, but it is worth asking the question: might it be possible\nto generalize the justification for stare decisis? Is a\nparallel pragmatic justification available for analogical arguments in\ngeneral?  \n\nBartha (2010) offers a preliminary attempt to provide such a\njustification by shifting from social values to epistemic values. \nThe general idea is that reasoning by analogy is especially well suited\nto the attainment of a common set of epistemic goals or values. \nIn simple terms, analogical reasoning—when it conforms to\ncertain criteria—achieves an excellent (perhaps optimal)\nbalance between the competing demands of stability and\ninnovation. It supports both conservative epistemic values, such\nas simplicity and coherence with existing belief, and progressive\nepistemic values, such as fruitfulness and theoretical unification\n(McMullin (1993) provides a classic list). \n\nAs emphasized earlier, analogical reasoning takes in a great deal more than analogical arguments. In this section, we examine two broad contexts in which analogical reasoning is important. \n\nThe first, still closely linked to analogical arguments, is the confirmation of scientific hypotheses. Confirmation is the process by which a\nscientific hypothesis receives inductive support on the basis of\nevidence (see\n evidence, \n confirmation,\nand\n Bayes’ Theorem).\nConfirmation may also signify the logical\nrelationship of inductive support that obtains between a\nhypothesis H and a proposition E that expresses the\nrelevant evidence. Can analogical arguments play a role, either\nin the process or in the logical relationship? Arguably yes (to\nboth), but this role has to be delineated carefully, and several\nobstacles remain in the way of a clear account. \n\nThe second context is conceptual and theoretical development in cutting-edge scientific research. Analogies are used to suggest possible extensions of theoretical concepts and ideas. The reasoning is linked to considerations of plausibility, but there is no straightforward analysis in terms of analogical arguments. \n\nHow is analogical reasoning\nrelated to the confirmation of scientific hypotheses? The examples and philosophical discussion from earlier sections suggest that a good analogical argument can indeed provide support for a hypothesis. But there are good reasons\nto doubt the claim that analogies provide actual\nconfirmation.  \n\nIn the first place, there is a logical difficulty. To appreciate this, let us concentrate on confirmation as a relationship between propositions. Christensen\n(1999: 441) offers a helpful general characterization: \n\nSome propositions seem to help make it rational to believe other\npropositions. When our current confidence in E helps\nmake rational our current confidence in H, we say that\nE confirms H.  \n\nIn the Bayesian model, ‘confidence’ is represented in\nterms of subjective probability. A Bayesian agent starts with an\nassignment of subjective probabilities to a class of\npropositions. Confirmation is understood as a three-place\nrelation:  \n\nE represents a proposition about accepted evidence,\nH stands for a hypothesis, K for background knowledge\nand Pr for the agent’s subjective probability\nfunction. To confirm H is to raise its conditional\nprobability, relative to K. The shift from prior\nprobability Pr(H ∣ K) to posterior\nprobability Pr(H ∣ E ·\nK) is referred to as conditionalization on\nE. The relation between these two probabilities is\ntypically given by Bayes’ Theorem (setting aside more complex\nforms of conditionalization): \n\nFor Bayesians, here is the logical difficulty: it seems that an analogical argument cannot provide confirmation. In the first place, it is not clear that we can\nencapsulate the information contained in an analogical argument in a\nsingle proposition, E. Second, even if we can formulate\na proposition E that expresses that information, it is\ntypically not appropriate to treat it as evidence because the information\ncontained in E is already part of the background,\nK. This means that\nE · K is equivalent to K,\nand hence Pr(H ∣ E · K) =\nPr(H ∣ K). According to the Bayesian\ndefinition, we don’t have confirmation. (This is a version of the problem of old evidence; see confirmation.)  Third, and perhaps\nmost important, analogical arguments are often applied to novel\nhypotheses H for which the prior probability\nPr(H ∣ K) is not even defined. Again,\nthe definition of confirmation in terms of Bayesian conditionalization seems inapplicable. \n\nIf analogies don’t provide inductive support via ordinary\nconditionalization, is there an alternative? Here we face a\nsecond difficulty, once again most easily stated within a Bayesian\nframework. Van Fraassen (1989) has a well-known objection to any\nbelief-updating rule other than conditionalization. This\nobjection applies to any rule that allows us to boost credences when\nthere is no new evidence. The criticism, made vivid by the tale\nof Bayesian Peter, is that these ‘ampliative’ rules are\nvulnerable to a\n Dutch Book. \nAdopting any such rule would lead us to acknowledge as fair a system of\nbets that foreseeably leads to certain loss. Any rule of this type for analogical reasoning appears to be vulnerable to van Fraassen’s\nobjection.  \n\nThere appear to be at least three routes to avoiding these difficulties and finding a role for\nanalogical arguments within Bayesian epistemology. First, there is what we might call minimal Bayesianism. Within the\nBayesian framework, some writers (Jeffreys 1973; Salmon 1967,\n1990; Shimony 1970) have argued that a ‘seriously proposed’\nhypothesis must have a sufficiently high prior probability to allow it\nto become preferred as the result of observation. Salmon has\nsuggested that analogical reasoning is one of the most important means\nof showing that a hypothesis is ‘serious’ in this sense. If analogical reasoning is directed primarily towards prior\nprobability assignments, it can provide inductive support while\nremaining formally distinct from confirmation, avoiding the logical difficulties noted above. This approach is minimally Bayesian because it provides nothing more than an entry point into the Bayesian apparatus, and it only applies to novel hypotheses. An orthodox Bayesian, such as de Finetti (de Finetti and Savage 1972,\nde Finetti 1974), might have no problem in allowing that analogies\nplay this role. \n\nThe second approach is liberal Bayesianism: we can change our prior probabilities in a non-rule-based fashion. Something along these lines is needed if analogical arguments are supposed to shift opinion about an already existing hypothesis without any new evidence. This is common in fields such as archaeology, as part of a strategy that Wylie refers to as “mobilizing old data as new evidence” (Wylie and Chapman 2016: 95). As Hawthorne (2012) notes, some Bayesians simply accept that both initial\nassignments and ongoing revision of prior probabilities (based\non plausibility arguments) can be rational, but \nthe logic of Bayesian induction (as described here) has\nnothing to say about what values the prior plausibility assessments\nfor hypotheses should have; and it places no restrictions on how they\nmight change.\n \nIn other words, by not stating any rules for this type of probability revision, we avoid the difficulties noted by van Fraassen. This approach admits analogical reasoning into the Bayesian tent, but acknowledges a dark corner of the tent in which\nrationality operates without any clear rules.  \n\n\nRecently, a third approach has attracted interest: analogue\nconfirmation or confirmation via analogue simulation. As\ndescribed in (Dardashti et al. 2017), the idea is as follows:   Our key idea is that, in certain circumstances,\npredictions concerning inaccessible phenomena can be confirmed via an\nanalogue simulation in a different system. (57) \n\nDardashti and his co-authors concentrate on a particular example\n(Example 17):\n‘dumb holes’ and other analogues to gravitational black\nholes (Unruh 1981; Unruh 2008). Unlike real black holes, some of these\nanalogues can be (and indeed have been) implemented and studied in the\nlab. Given the exact formal analogy between our models for these\nsystems and our models of black holes, and certain important\nadditional assumptions, Dardashti et al. make the controversial claim\nthat observations made about the analogues provide evidence about\nactual black holes. For instance, the observation of phenomena\nanalogous to Hawking radiation in the analogue systems would provide\nconfirmation for the existence of Hawking radiation in black holes. In\na second paper (Dardashti et al. 2018, Other Internet Resources), the\ncase for confirmation is developed within a Bayesian framework.  \n\nThe appeal of a clearly articulated mechanism for analogue\nconfirmation is obvious. It would provide a tool for exploring\nconfirmation of inaccessible phenomena not just in cosmology, but also\nin historical sciences such as archaeology and evolutionary biology,\nand in areas of medical science where ethical constraints rule out\nexperiments on human subjects. Furthermore, as noted by Dardashti et\nal., analogue confirmation relies on new evidence obtained\nfrom the analogue system, and is therefore not vulnerable to the\nlogical difficulties noted above. \n\nAlthough the concept of analogue confirmation is not entirely new\n(think of animal testing, as in\n Example 8), the claims of (Dardashti et al. 2017, 2018 [Other\nInternet Resources]) require evaluation. One immediate difficulty for\nthe black hole example: if we think in terms of ordinary analogical\narguments, there is no positive analogy because, to put it\nsimply, we have no basis of known similarities between a ‘dumb\nhole’ and a black hole. As Crowther et al. (2018, Other Internet\nResources) argue, “it is not known if the particular modelling\nframework used in the derivation of Hawking radiation actually\ndescribes black holes in the first place.” This may not\nconcern Dardashti et al., since they claim that analogue confirmation\nis distinct from ordinary analogical arguments. It may turn out that\nanalogue confirmation is different for cases such as animal testing,\nwhere we have a basis of known similarities, and for cases where our\nonly access to the target domain is via a theoretical model.  \n\nIn §3.6, we saw that practice-based studies of analogy provide insight into the criteria for evaluating analogical arguments. Such studies also point to dynamical or programmatic roles for analogies, which appear to require evaluative frameworks that go beyond those developed for analogical arguments. \n\nKnuttila and Loettgers (2014) examine the role of analogical reasoning in synthetic biology, an interdisciplinary field that draws on physics, chemistry, biology, engineering and computational science. The main role for analogies in this field is not the construction of individual analogical arguments but rather the development of concepts such as “noise” and “feedback loops”. Such concepts undergo constant refinement, guided by both positive and negative analogies to their analogues in engineered and physical systems. Analogical reasoning here is “transient, heterogeneous, and programmatic” (87). Negative analogies, seen as problematic obstacles for individual analogical arguments, take on a prominent and constructive role when the focus is theoretical construction and concept refinement. \n\nSimilar observations apply to analogical reasoning in its application to another cutting-edge field: emergent gravity. In this area of physics, distinct theoretical approaches portray gravity as emerging from different microstructures (Linneman and Visser 2018). “Novel and robust” features not present at the micro-level emerge in the gravitational theory. Analogies with other emergent phenomena, such as hydrodynamics and thermodynamics, are exploited to shape these proposals. As with synthetic biology, analogical reasoning is not directed primarily towards the formulation and assessment of individual arguments. Rather, its role is to develop different theoretical models of gravity. \n\nThese studies explore fluid and creative applications of analogy to shape concepts on the front lines of scientific research. An adequate analysis would certainly take us beyond the analysis of individual analogical arguments, which have been the focus of our attention. Knuttila and Loettgers (2014) are led to reject the idea that the individual analogical argument is the “primary unit” in analogical reasoning, but this is a debatable conclusion. Linneman and Visser (2018), for instance, explicitly affirm the importance of assessing the case for different gravitational models through “exemplary analogical arguments”:  We have taken up the challenge of making explicit\narguments in favour of an emergent gravity paradigm… That arguments\ncan only be plausibility arguments at the heuristic level does not\nmean that they are immune to scrutiny and critical assessment tout\ncourt. The philosopher of physics’ job in the process of\ndiscovery of quantum gravity… should amount to providing exactly this\nkind of assessments. (Linneman and Visser 2018: 12) \n\nAccordingly, Linneman and Visser formulate explicit analogical arguments for each model of emergent gravity, and assess them using familiar criteria for evaluating individual analogical arguments. Arguably, even the most ambitious heuristic objectives still depend upon considerations of plausibility that benefit by being expressed, and examined, in terms of analogical arguments.","contact.mail":"paul.bartha@ubc.ca","contact.domain":"ubc.ca"}]
