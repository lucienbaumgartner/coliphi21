How ought the interests of people in the distant future to\nbe taken into account when we make our own decisions? How much of its\noutput should a nation invest for the future? In which assets should\nthat investment be made? What should be the balance among private,\npublic, and communitarian investments in the overall investment that a\ngeneration makes for the future? How much should the world spend in\ncountering global climate change?\n\n\n\nIn a remarkable paper Frank Ramsey developed a framework in which each\nof these questions can be studied in a form that is precise and\ntractable enough to elicit answers (Ramsey, 1928). His approach was to\napply the Classical-Utilitarian calculus to identify the best match\nfrom among attainable and desirable utility streams over time and\nacross generations. Although very famous today, the paper had no\ninitial impact. Some economists have attributed the lack of interest\nto the paper’s technical character. In answering the question he\nposed (“How much of a nation’s output should it\nsave?”), Ramsey had to use the calculus of variations. There is\nno question but that few economists then knew the required\ntechnicalities. But it is difficult to imagine that there were no\neconomists capable of learning the necessary mathematics had they\nwished to do so. The reason there was little interest in\nRamsey’s paper lay elsewhere. In the years following the\npublication, a period now known as The Great Depression, the central\neconomic problem in industrialised countries was to find ways to\nincrease employment. Factories lay idle, as did people. The\nunemployment rate in Europe and USA was in the region of 25%. Policies\nthat were needed then had to do with creating incentives for employers\nto hire workers. Even though there were controversies among economists\non what those policies should be, no one doubted that industrialized\nsocieties were facing a problem of the short run. In contrast, Ramsey\naddressed a question involving the long run; and, so as to have an\nuncluttered problem to analyse, he took it as given that there is full\nemployment at every date of both capital and labour.\n\n\nWith the emergence of post-colonial nations following the Second\nWorld War, long run economic development became prominent in economic\nstudies. By the early 1960s it had become clear that Ramsey’s paper is\nthe natural starting point for studying the welfare economics of the\nlong run, not only for pursuing optimum development in centrally\nplanned economies (Chakravarty, 1969), but also for use in social\ncost-benefit analysis of public investment in mixed economies (Arrow\nand Kurz, 1970), the choice of technology in labour-surplus economies\n(Little and Mirrlees, 1968, 1974), and more recently, the welfare\neconomics of climate change (Cline, 1992; Nordhaus, 1994; Stern, 2007).\nThe number of trails Ramsey laid was remarkable. In academic economics\nit is one of the dozen or so most influential papers of the 20th\ncentury.\n\n\nClassical Utilitarianism takes the good to be the expected value of\nthe sum of utilities over time and across the generations (Sidgwick,\n1907). Ramsey’s formulation was built on that moral reasoning. He even\nused the term “enjoyment” to interpret utility. The article embodies\nthe sort of ethical deliberation Sen and Williams (1982) called\n“Government House Utilitarianism.” But Ramsey’s article thrives today\nbecause Government House needs ethical guidance that isn’t a prop for\npaid Officials to act in nepotistic, never mind predatory ways, but are\ninstead impartial over people’s needs and sensitivities. Although\nRamsey used the Utilitarian language, a generous reading of his paper\nsays that much would be gained if, instead of “enjoyment,” we were to\nwork with the broader notion of “well-being.” Such a move allows one to\npay greater attention to the factors, be they material or otherwise,\nthat make for flourishing lives.\n\n\nRamsey’s goal was practical: “How much of a nation’s output should\nit save for the future?” The demographic profile over time was taken by\nhim to be given, meaning that future numbers of people were seen as\nexogenous and predictable. We were therefore to imagine that economic\npolicies have a negligible effect on reproductive behaviour (but see\nDasgupta, 1969, for a study of the joint population/saving problem,\nusing Classical Utilitarianism as the guiding principle). Parfit (1984)\nchristened choices involving the same demographic profile, “Same\nNumbers Choices.” \n\nThe ingredients of Ramsey’s theory are individuals’ lifetime\nwell-beings. Government House in his world maximizes the expected sum\nof the lifetime well-beings of all who are here today and all who will\never be born, subject to resource constraints. The optimum distribution\nof lifetime well-beings across generations is derived from that\nmaximization exercise. Of course, the passage of time is not the same\nas the advance of generations. An individual’s lifetime well-being is\nan aggregate of the flow of well-being she experiences, while\nintergenerational well-being is an aggregate of the lifetime\nwell-beings of all who appear on the scene. It is doubtful that the two\naggregates should have the same functional form. On the other hand,\nthere is little evidence to suggest that we would be way off the mark\nin assuming they do have the same form. As a matter of practical\nethics, it helps enormously to approximate by not distinguishing the\nfunctional form of someone’s well-being over time from that of\nwell-being across the generations. Ramsey adopted this short-cut.\nPeople were also taken to be identical, so we may as well assume that\nthere is a single individual at each date. The move removes any\ndistinction between time and generations. An alternative interpretation\nwould have us imagine that the economy consists of a single dynasty,\nwhere parents in each generation leave bequests for their children\n(Meade, 1966, adopted this interpretation). Ramsey also assumed,\nprobably because the mathematics is simpler, that time is a continuous\nvariable, not discrete. \n\nLet \\(t \\ge 0\\) denote time. In Ramsey’s model there is no\nuncertainty (but see Levhari and Srinivasan, 1969, for one of the first\nof many extensions of the Ramsey model that incorporate uncertainty\nabout future possibilities). The economy is endowed with a single,\nnon-depreciating commodity that can be worked by labour to produce\noutput at each date (Gale, 1967, and Brock, 1973, were among the first\nof many extensions of the Ramsey model that contain a heterogeneous\ncollection of capital goods). The economy is assumed to be closed to\ninternational trade (opening the economy to trade involves only a minor\nextension to Ramsey’s model). That means some of the output can be\ninvested so as to add to the commodity’s stock while the remainder can\nbe consumed immediately. We call the stock of the commodity that serves\nto produce output, “capital.” The problem is then to find the optimum\nallocation of output at each date between consumption and\ninvestment. \n\nRamsey assumed that work is unpleasant. But because including the\ndisutility of work in our account of his work here would add nothing of\nsubstance, we suppose that labour supply is an exogenously given\nconstant (e.g., it is independent of the wages labour can demand). That\nenables us to suppress the supply of labour in both production and the\nfactors affecting well-being. \n\nIf \\(K\\) is the stock of capital of the economy’s one and only\ncommodity, output is taken to be \\(F(K)\\), where \\(F(0) = 0\\) (i.e.,\noutput is zero if there is no capital), \\(dF(K)/dK \\gt 0\\) (i.e.,\nthe marginal product of capital is positive), and \\(d^2 F(K)/dK^2\n\\le 0\\) (i.e., the marginal product of \\(K\\) does not increase with\n\\(K\\)). \\(F(K)\\) is a flow (production at a moment in time), in\ncontrast to \\(K\\), which is a stock (quantity of capital,\nperiod). Notice also that output depends solely on the stock of\ncapital. No mention is made of possible improvements in the quality of\ncapital or labour. Thus, there is no prospect of technological\nprogress or accumulation of human capital in Ramsey’s model (but\nsee Mirrlees, 1967, for one of the first of many extensions of the\nRamsey model that include technological advances in production and\nhuman capital formation); nor are there any natural resources in the\nmodel (but see Dasgupta and Heal, 1974, for one of the first of many\nextensions of the Ramsey model that include natural capital in\nproduction). \n\nLet \\(C(t)\\) be consumption at \\(t\\). It is a\nflow (units of consumption per moment). Similarly, we write\n\\(K(t)\\) for the stock of capital at \\(t\\). As\n\\(dK(t)/dt\\) is the rate of change in the\ncapital stock at \\(t\\), it is “net investment at \\(t\\),”\nwhich too is a flow. And because the capital stock is assumed not to\ndepreciate, gross investment equals net investment. \n\nIn Ramsey’s model anticipated output at each moment equals the sum\nof intended investment and intended consumption. Intentions are always\nrealized. To put it in technical language, the economy is in\nequilibrium at each moment, which is another way of saying that at each\nmoment intended saving equals intended investment. (The assumption\nneeds no explanation in a model with a single agent, but has real bite\nin a world where savers are not the same agents as investors.) Capital\nis assumed to be always fully deployed, and labour (which is hidden in\nthe production function \\(F(K)\\)) is taken to be fully\nemployed. Output at \\(t\\) is \\(F(K(t))\\).\nIt follows that the economy is driven by the dynamical equation \nEquation (1) says that if consumption is \\(C(t)\\), investment is what\nremains of output. So, Ramsey’s problem can be cast equally as,\n“How much of a nation’s output should it consume?”\nIf consumption is less than output at \\(t\\) (i.e., \\(C(t) \\lt\nF(K(t))\\), investment is positive (i.e., \\(dK(t)/dt \\gt 0)\\) and the\nstock of capital increases; but if consumption exceeds output at\n\\(t\\), investment is negative, which means capital is eaten into and\nthe stock declines (i.e., \\(dK(t)/dt \\lt 0).\\) We now imagine that\nGovernment House is advised by a “socially-concerned\ncitizen,” the person being someone who is trying to determine\nthe right balance between the economy’s consumption and\ninvestment at each date. We shall call that person the decision\nmaker, or DM. Ramsey imagined that DM is a\nClassical-Utilitarian. \n\nClassical Utilitarianism identifies the good as the expected sum of\nwell-being over time and across generations. Here is Sidgwick (1907:\n414) on the matter: \n\nTo formalize this, we consider an arbitrary date \\(t\\) at which DM is\ndeliberating. Let \\(\\tau\\) denote dates not earlier than \\(t\\) (i.e.,\n\\(\\tau \\ge t)\\). Ramsey considered a deterministic, infinitely lived\nworld (but see Yaari, 1965, for the first of many extensions of the\nRamsey model that incorporate the risk of individual or societal\nextinction). Well-being is assumed to be a numerical quantity. Let\n\\(U(t)\\) be well-being at \\(t\\), and let \\(V(t)\\) be an aggregate\nmeasure of the flow of well-being across time and generations, as\nevaluated at time \\(t\\). Ramsey followed Sidgwick in assuming that \n\n\\(V(t)\\) is intergenerational well-being at \\(t\\). Because\nRamsey’s world is deterministic, \\(V(t)\\) is also the expected\nvalue of \\(V(t)\\). So Sidgwick’s criterion is the \\(V(t)\\) in\nequation (2). \n\nWell-being at any given date is assumed to be a function solely of\nconsumption at that date. We therefore write \\(U(t) =\nU(C(t))\\). Ramsey assumed that marginal well-being is positive (i.e.,\n\\(dU(C)/dC \\gt 0)\\) but diminishes with increasing consumption levels\n(i.e., \\(d^2 U(C)/dC^2 \\lt 0)\\).  The latter property implies that\n\\(U(C)\\) is a strictly concave function. (Edgeworth, 1885,\nhad routinized the idea that marginal well-being declines with\nincreasing consumption.) Thus equation (2) can be written as \n\nClassical Utilitarianism, as reflected in equation (3), requires\nthat if \\(U\\) is a numerical measure of well-being, then so is\n\\(\\alpha U+\\beta\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a positive number and \\(\\beta\\)\nis a number of either sign. Formally, we say that \\(U\\) is unique\nup to “positive affine transformations.” We confirm presently that the\ntheory’s recommendations are invariant under such transformations. \n\nIn equation (3), future values of \\(U\\) are not discounted when\nviewed from the present moment, \\(t\\). This particular move has\nprovoked more debate among economists and philosophers than any other\nfeature of Ramsey’s theory of optimum saving. The debate has on\noccasion been shriller than even we economists are used to (see in\nparticular Nordhaus, 2007). At the risk of generalizing wildly,\neconomists have favoured the use of positive rates to discount future\nwell-beings (e.g., Arrow and Kurz, 1970), whereas philosophers have\ninsisted that the well-being of future people should be given the same\nweight as that of present people (e.g., Parfit, 1984). \n\nWhat would Classical Utilitarianism with positive discounting of\nfuture well-beings look like? Let \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) be the rate at which\nit is deemed desirable to discount future well-beings (for simplicity\nwe take the discount rate to be constant). Then, in place of equations\n(2)–(3), intergenerational well-being at \\(t\\), would read as \nIn equation (4), \\(\\delta\\) the “time discount rate” and\n\\(e^{-\\delta}\\) the resulting “time discount factor.” \n\\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) implies \\(e^{-\\delta} \\lt 1\\). That\nmeans \\(e^{-\\delta(\\tau -t)}\\) tends to\nzero exponentially as \\(\\tau\\) tends to infinity. In the latter\npart of his paper Ramsey (1928: 553–555) did use equation (4) to study\nthe problem of optimum saving, but he did not approve of the\nformulation. Instead, he wrote (p. 543) that to discount later\n\\(U\\)’s in comparison with earlier ones is “… ethically\nindefensible and arises merely from the weakness of the imagination.”\nIn a book that inaugurated the formal study of economic development,\nHarrod (1948: 40) followed suit by calling the practice a “…\npolite expression for rapacity and the conquest of reason by\npassion.” \n\nStrong words, but to some economists, the Ramsey-Harrod stricture in\na deterministic world reads like a Sunday pronouncement. Solow (1974a:\n9) expressed this feeling exactly when he wrote, “In solemn conclave\nassembled, so to speak, we ought to act as if the [discount rate on\nfuture well-beings] were zero.” \n\nBut the matter cannot be settled without a study of production and\nconsumption possibilities open to an economy. Consider the following\ntension between two sets of considerations: \n\nThe force of each consideration has been demonstrated in the\neconomics literature. It has been shown in the context of a simple\nmodel that if production requires produced capital and exhaustible\nresources, then optimum consumption declines to zero in the long run if\nfuture well-beings are discounted at a positive rate (Dasgupta and\nHeal, 1974), but increases indefinitely if we follow Ramsey in not\ndiscounting future well-beings (Solow, 1974b). The exercises tell us\nthat the long-run features of optimum saving policies depend on the\nrelative magnitudes of the rate at which future well-beings are\ndiscounted and the long-term productivity of capital assets. \n\nThere is a more general point here, which was explored by Koopmans\n(1960, 1965, 1967, 1972) in a remarkable set of publications on the\nidea of economic development. In such complex exercises as those\ninvolving consumption and investment over a long time horizon, it is\nfoolish to regard any ethical principle (e.g., Classical\nUtilitarianism) as sacrosanct. One can never know in advance what it\nmay run up against. A more judicious tactic than Ramsey’s would be to\nto play off one set of ethical assumptions against another in\nnot-implausible worlds, see what their implications are for the\ndistribution of well-being across generations, and then appeal to our\nintuitive senses before arguing over policy. Settling ex ante\nwhether to use a positive rate to discount future well-beings could be\na self-defeating\n move.[1] \n\nRamsey considered a world with an indefinite future. This could\nappear to be an odd move, but it has a strong rationale. Suppose DM\nwere to choose a horizon of \\(T\\) years. As she doesn’t know when\nour world will end, she will want to specify the resources that should\nbe left behind at \\(T\\) in case the world doesn’t terminate then.\nBut to find a justification for the amount to leave behind at\n\\(T\\), DM will need an assessment of the world beyond \\(T\\).\nThat would, however, amount to including the world beyond \\(T\\).\nAnd so on. \n\nDenote a consumption stream from the present \\((t = 0)\\) to infinity\nas \\(\\{C(t)\\}.\\) \\(K(0) \\gt 0\\) circumscribes the economy; it is the\nquantity of capital that society has inherited from the\npast. Mathematicians would call \\(K(0)\\) an “initial\ncondition.” The problem Ramsey set himself was to determine the\nconsumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) from 0 to infinity that DM would\nselect if she were a Classical Utilitarian. \n\nCall a consumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) feasible\nif it satisfies equation (1) with initial condition \\(K(0)\\). In\nRamsey’s deterministic world the Classical Utilitarian formulation of\nthe problem of optimum national saving at date \\(t = 0\\) is\nthus:  “From the set of all feasible consumption streams, find that\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) which maximizes \n\nWe will call this optimization problem, Ramsey Mark I. \n\nThere is a serious difficulty with Ramsey Mark I: it is not\ncoherent. Infinite sums don’t necessarily converge. For any\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) for which the infinite integral doesn’t\nconverge, \\(V(0)\\) doesn’t exist. If the integral is\nnon-convergent for every feasible consumption streams\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\), the maximization problem is meaningless: One\ncannot maximize something that appears to be a real-valued function\n\\(V(0)\\) when in fact the function doesn’t exist. \n\nThe force of this observation can be seen in \nExample 1 (attributed to David Gale) \n\nSuppose as an extreme special case of the Ramsey economy,\n\\(F(K) = 0\\) for all \\(K \\ge 0\\). Then equation (1)\nreduces to \n\nThe economy described in equation (5) consists of a non-deteriorating\npiece of cake, of size \\(K(0) \\gt 0\\) at the initial date. It is\nobvious that every consumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) satisfying equation\n(5) tends to zero in the long run. Formally, \\(C(t) \\rightarrow 0\\) as\n\\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). \n\nBecause the \\(U\\)-function is unique up to positive affine\ntransformations, we may without any loss of generality normalize it so\nthat \\(U(0) \\ne 0\\). It is then obvious that for all feasible\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\), \\(V(0)\\) in Ramsey Mark I\ndiverges to minus infinity if \\(U(0) \\lt 0\\), but diverges to\nplus infinity if \\(U(0) \\gt 0\\). That an optimum policy does not\nexist in the cake-eating model can be seen if we now recall that\n\\(U(C)\\) has been assumed to be strictly concave. The\nassumption implies that any non-egalitarian distribution of consumption\namong the generations can be improved upon by a suitable\nredistribution. The ideal distribution would be equal consumption for\nall generations. The only consumption stream with the latter property\nis \\(C(t) = 0\\) for all \\(t\\). But that’s the worst\npossible distribution. QED \n\nThe question arises whether there are circumstances in which there\nis a best consumption stream even though \\(V(0)\\) does not\nconverge for all consumption streams. Ramsey formulated the question by\naltering the way the saving problem is posed. \n\nImagine that well-being is bounded above no matter how large\nconsumption happens to be. Let \\(U\\) be the numerical measure of\nwell-being that DM chooses to work with. (All positive affine\ntransformations of \\(U\\) would be equally legitimate measures of\nwell-being.) Let \\(B\\) be the lowest upper bound of \\(U\\).  Ramsey\nchristened it “Bliss”. Because the rate of return on\ninvestment \\((F_K)\\) in his model is positive, consumption would grow\nindefinitely and tend to infinity in the long run if saving rates were\nsuitably chosen. That means there are possible paths of economic\ndevelopment in which \\(U(C(t))\\) tend to \\(B\\) in the long run. But\nthat implies there are possible paths of economic development in which\nthe short-fall of \\(U(C(t))\\) from \\(B\\) tends to zero in the long\nrun. If the short-fall tends to zero fast enough, the undiscounted\nintegral of the difference between \\(U(C(t))\\) and \\(B\\) would exist,\nand DM could seek to maximize the modified integral. So we\nhave Ramsey Mark II, which reads as \n\n“From the set of all feasible consumption streams, find that\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) which maximizes \n\nNotice that Mark II is a transformation of Mark I.\nThe transformation amounts to re-normalizing the optimality criterion.\nNot only was the move from Mark I to Mark II on\nRamsey’s part ingenious, it also displayed his moral integrity. It\nwould have been easy enough for him to ask DM instead to discount\nfuture consumption and expand the range of circumstances in which\nUtilitarianism provides an answer to the problem DM is attempting to\nsolve. He chose not to do that. \n\nRamsey’s intuition in moving from Mark I to Mark\nII was powerful, but in a paper that initiated the modern\nliterature on the Ramsey problem, Chakravarty (1962) observed that to\nrely exclusively on the condition Ramsey had identified as being\nnecessary for a consumption stream to be the optimum (see\nbelow) can lead to absurd results (see below, Sect. 4). In effect\nChakravarty observed that infinite integrals, even when cast in the\nre-normalized form in Ramsey Mark II, don’t necessarily\nconverge to finite values. \n\nWhat was needed was to de-link the question whether infinite\nwell-being integrals converge from the question whether optimum\nconsumption streams exist. That insight was provided by Koopmans (1965)\nand von Weizsacker (1965). The latter author’s re-statement of\nthe problem of optimum saving was as follows: \n\nWe say that the feasible consumption stream \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\)\nis superior to a feasible consumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) if\nthere exists \\(T \\gt 0\\) such that for all \\(t \\ge T\\), \n\nWe call \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) optimum if it is superior\nto all other feasible consumption streams. \n\nThe condition that is represented in inequality (6) is known as the\nOvertaking Criterion (OC), for that is what it is. OC avoids\nasking whether the integrals on either side of inequality (6) converge\nas \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). If they do, OC reduces to Classical\nUtilitarianism. But OC is able to respond to Ramsey’s saving problem in\na wider class of situations. In his work Koopmans (1965) identified a\ncanonical economic model in which the \\(U\\)-function is bounded\nabove and in which Ramsey Mark II is equivalent to an\noptimization problem that is posed in terms of OC. \n\nWhat are we to make of the ethics of discounting the well-beings of\nfuture generations? Ramsey (1928) began by dismissing it but then\nstudied it at the tail end of his paper. DM could of course justify\ndiscounting future well-being if there is a possibiliy of future\nextinction. Sidgwick (1907) himself noted that in the passage quoted\nearlier. If Classical Utilitarianism is taken to commend the expected\nsum of well-beings, then the “hazard rate” at date\n\\(t\\) (i.e., the probability of extinction at date \\(t\\)\nconditional on society surviving until \\(t)\\) would appear in the\nexpression for expected well-being as a discount rate for well-being at\n\\(t\\). The question remains whether Classical Utilitarianism would\ninsist on zero-discounting of future utilities in a deterministic\nworld. \n\nIn a remarkable pair of works Koopmans (1960, 1972) exposed internal\ncontradictions in ethical reasoning in a deterministic world in both\nRamsey Mark I and Ramsey Mark II. He (and\nsubsequently Diamond, 1965) showed that if relatively weak normative\nrequirements are imposed on the concept of intergenerational well-being\nin a deterministic world, equal treatment of the \\(U\\)-function\nacross generations has to be abandoned. We turn to that now. \n\nIt transpires the mathematics is a lot simpler if, instead of\nassuming time is continuous, time is taken to be discrete. Thus we now\nassume that \\(t = 0,1,2,\\ldots\\) . Assume also that\nintergenerational well-being at \\(t = 0\\) can be measured in terms\nof a numerical function \\(V\\). The idea is to require the\nfunction, which is defined on infinite well-being streams, to satisfy\nproperties that reflect ethical directives. \n\nLet \\(\\{U(t)\\}\\) be an infinite well-being stream, that is, \\(\\{U(t)\\}\n= (U(0),U(1),\\ldots ,U(t),\\ldots)\\).  We say \\(V(\\{U(t)\\})\\)\nis continuous if in an appropriate mathematical sense the\nvalues of \\(V\\) for well-being streams \\(\\{U(t)\\}\\) that don’t\ndiffer much in the space of \\(\\{U(t)\\}\\)s are close to one another. A\nfurther condition on the \\(V\\)-function that is ethically attractive\nis “monotonicity”. To define the notion let us say a\nwell-being stream is “superior” to another if no\ngeneration enjoys less well-being along the former than along the\nlatter and if there is at least one generation that enjoys greater\nwell-being in the former than it does in the latter. We say that \\(V\\)\nis monotonic if \\(V\\) is larger for a well-being stream than\nit is for another if the former is superior to the latter. \n\nBoth properties are attractive. Lexicographic orderings\nnotwithstanding, there are not convincing arguments against continuity.\nOf course Rawls (1972) placed priority rules and the lexicographic\norderings on the objects of interest in his conception of justice that\ncome with them at the centre of his theory, but that has proved to have\nbeen one of his most contentious moves. The richness and depth of his\nanalysis would not be lessened if small tradeoffs were admitted between\nthe objects of justice. And it’s hard to find reasons against\nmonotonicity. Even Rawls, whose work was so pointed toward distributive\njustice, insisted on monotonicity. \n\nBut it can be shown that any \\(V\\)-function that satisfies\ncontinuity and monotonicity must have generation discounting built into\nit. It would seem the real numbers are not rich enough to accommodate\ninfinite well-being streams in a manner that respects continuity and\nmonotonicity while awarding the well-beings of all generations equal\nweight. Proof of the proposition is in Diamond (1965), and was\nattributed by the author to Menahem Yaari. So we now introduce positive\nwell-being discounting in the \\(V\\)-function and formulate\nRamsey Mark III. \n\nReturn once again to the formulation where time is continuous. As\npreviously, we say a consumption stream \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) is\nfeasible if it satisfies equation (1) with an initial capital\nstock of \\(K(0)\\). Ramsey Mark III (Ramsey, 1928,\n553–555) is then: \n\n“From the set of all feasible consumption streams, find that\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) which maximizes \n\nIn Mark III the discount rate \\(\\delta\\) is a positive\nconstant. That means the corresponding discount factor\n\\(e^{-\\delta}\\) is less than 1. The latter in turn can be\nshown to mean that in a wide range of economic models\n\\(e^{-\\delta t}\\) tends to zero at so fast a rate\nthat Mark III has an answer. \n\nLet \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) be the solution of Ramsey Mark\nIII. Heuristically it is useful to imagine that there is a DM at\neach date. The measure of intergenerational well-being for the DM at\ndate \\(t\\) is the \\(V(t)\\) of equation (4). Notice that the ethical\nviews of the successive DMs are congruent with one another. There is\nthus no need for the DMs to draw up an “intergenerational\ncontract”. The DM at every date will want to choose the level of\nconsumption it deems to be optimum, aware that succeeding DMs will\nchoose in accordance with what she had planned for them. In modern\ngame theoretic parlance, Ramsey’s optimum consumption stream\n\\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) is a “non-cooperative” (Nash) equilibrium\namong the DMs. \n\nWe now construct an informal version of the variational argument\nRamsey used for determining \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) in Mark\nIII. Loosely speaking, the DMs require the marginal rate of\nethically indifferent substitution between consumption at any two brief\nperiods of time to equal the marginal rate at which consumption can be\ntransformed between those same pair of brief periods of time. Their\nequality (i.e., the right balance from among the\n“desirables” and the “feasibles”) is a\nnecessary property of an optimum consumption stream. \n\nRamsey constructed a mathematical expression of the property, but\ndid not look for conditions that, taken together, are both necessary\nand sufficient. We will use a simple example, which is also in\nhis paper, to show how a sufficient condition can be obtained. \n\nWrite \\(dU/dC = U_C\\) and \\(d^2 U/dC^2 = U_{CC}.\\) Let \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) be\na feasible consumption stream. We first deduce a formal expression for\nthe marginal rate of ethically indifferent substitution between\nconsumption at any two brief periods of time. Suppose the intention is\nto reduce consumption at some future date \\(t\\) by a small quantity\n\\(\\Delta C(t)\\) and raise consumption at a nearby date \\(t+\\Delta t\\)\nwhile keeping consumption at all other dates the same as in\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\). The loss in well-being that would follow from the move\nis \\(e^{-\\delta t}U_{C(t)}\\Delta C(t)\\).  We now seek to\ndetermine the percentage increase in consumption that would be\nrequired at \\(t+\\Delta t\\) if \\(V(0)\\) is to remain unchanged; because\nthat’s the marginal rate of ethically indifferent substitution\nbetween consumption at \\(t\\) and consumption at \\(t+\\Delta t\\). Denote\nthat rate by \\(\\varrho(t)\\). Then \\(\\varrho(t)\\) must be the\npercentage rate at which discounted marginal well-being declines at\n\\(t\\). It also follows that \\(\\varrho(t)\\) is the rate the DM at \\(t =\n0\\) would use to discount a unit of consumption at \\(t\\) so as to\nbring it to the present (because that’s what is meant by the\npercentage rate at which discounted marginal well-being declines at\n\\(t\\) – for a formal demonstration, see Dasgupta, 2008). Some\neconomists call \\(\\varrho(t)\\) the consumption rate of\ninterest (Little and Mirrlees, 1974), others call it\nthe social rate of discount (Arrow and Kurz,\n1970). \\(\\varrho(t)\\) is a fundamental object in social cost-benefit\nanalysis. \n\nLet \\(\\Delta\\) be vanishingly small. Then, by definition \n\nSo as to simplify the notation let \\(g(C(t))\\) denote the percentage\nrate of growth in \\(C(t)\\) (i.e. \\(g(C(t)) = [dC(t)/dt]/C(t)\\), which\ncan be negative), and let \\(\\sigma(C)\\) denote the elasticity of\nmarginal well-being (i.e., \\(\\sigma(C) = -CU_{CC}/U_C \\gt\n0)\\). Equation (7) then simplifies to \n\nBecause \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) is by assumption the optimum, no feasible\ndeviation from \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) can increase \\(V(0)\\). That means the\nconsumption rate of interest \\((\\varrho(t))\\) must equal the social\nrate of return on investment \\((F_{K(t)})\\) at every \\(t\\). To see\nwhy, suppose in some vanishingly small interval of time \\(F_{K(t)} \\gt\n\\varrho(t)\\).  Then \\(V(0)\\) could be increased by consuming a unit\nless at \\(t\\) and enjoying the return of \\((1+F_{K(t)})\\) soon after.\nAlternatively, if \\(F_{K(t)} \\lt \\varrho(t), V(0)\\) could be increased\nby consuming a unit more at \\(t\\) and reducing consumption soon after\nby an amount equal to the return \\((1+F_{K(t)})\\).  But that means\nthe consumption rate of interest \\(\\varrho(t)\\) equals the social rate\nof return \\(F_{K(t)}\\) along \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) at every date. Using\nequation (8) we have, \n\nEquation (9) is the Ramsey Rule. It is a necessary condition for\noptimality in Ramsey Mark III and is unarguably the most\nfamous equation in intertemporal welfare economics. The rule is a\nformal statement of the requirement of \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\), that\nthe marginal rate of substitution between consumption at two nearby\ndates (the left-hand-side of eq. 9) equals the marginal rate of\ntransformation between consumption at those same pair of nearby dates\n(the right-hand-side of eq. (9). It is simple to confirm that equation\n(9) is invariant under positive affine transformations of the\n\\(U\\)-function. \n\nPresently we will specify a \\(U\\)-function for which \\(\\sigma\\) is\nindependent of \\(C\\). For the moment we merely suppose that\n\\(\\sigma\\) is constant. In that case the Ramsey Rule reads as \n\nIn Ramsey Mark III, \\(K(0)\\) is given as an inheritance from\nthe past. That means \\(F_{K(0)}\\) is given as an initial condition, it\nis not a choice for the DM at \\(t = 0\\). Moreover \\(\\delta\\) and\n\\(\\sigma\\) are parameters, both reflecting ethical values. The DM can\ntherefore determine \\(g(C(0))\\) from equation (10). But that’s\nthe optimum percentage rate of growth in consumption at the initial\ndate. The Ramsey Rule gives the DM an equation for determining the\ninitial growth rate of consumption, but it does not say what the\ninitial level of consumption ought to be. Below we show by\nway of an example that there are an infinity of feasible consumption\npaths satisfying the Ramsey Rule. It follows that the DM at \\(t = 0\\)\nneeds a further condition to determine \\(C^*(0)\\). Example 2 (the linear economy) \n\nAssume \n\nFrom equation (11a) it follows that \\(F_K = \\mu\\), which means the\nrate of return on investment is constant. From equation (11b) it\nfollows that \\(\\sigma\\) is the elasticity of marginal well-being.\nNotice also that \\(U(C) \\rightarrow -\\infty\\) as \\(C \\rightarrow 0\\)\nand that, under the chosen normaliztion of the \\(U\\)-function, \\(U(C)\n\\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(C \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Using equation (11a) in\nequation (1) yields, \n\nWrite \\(m = (\\mu -\\delta)/\\sigma\\). Applying equations (11a–b)\nto equation (10) reduces the Ramsey Rule to \n\nEquation (13) says that if \\(\\mu \\lt \\delta , C(t)\\) declines to 0 at\nan exponential rate. Empirically, the pausible case to consider is\n\\(\\mu \\gt \\delta\\), which is what we shall do here. It means that the\nrate of return on investment \\((\\mu)\\) exceeds the rate at which time\nis discounted \\((\\delta)\\). And that in turn means \\(m \\gt 0\\).\nIntegrating equation (13) yields \n\nEquation (14) says \\(C(t)\\) grows exponentially at the\nrate \\(m\\). We reconfirm a point that was made previously, that\nalthough equation (14) reveals the rate of growth optimum consumption\nat the initial date (i.e., \\(t = 0)\\), it doesn’t reveal the\ninitial level of consumption (i.e., \\(C(0)\\)). That’s the\nindeterminacy in the Ramsey Rule. \n\nThe simplest way to determine the optimum initial consumption,\n\\(C^*(0)\\), is to observe from equation (14) that if\n\\(C^*(t)\\) grows indefinitely at the rate \\(m\\), so\nshould \\(K(t)\\) be required to grow at that same rate.\nThe reason is that if the growth rate of \\(K(t)\\) were to\nbe less than \\(m\\), capital would be eaten into, which means the\nstock would be exhausted in finite time. The economy would then cease\nto exist \\((V(0)\\) would be minus infinity if the future\ntrajectory of the economy were to be thus.) If on the other hand the\ngrowth rate of \\(K(t)\\) were to exceed \\(m\\), there\nwould be over-accumulation of capital, in the sense that consumption\nwould be lower at every date than it needs be. The situation would\nresemble one where DM throws away a part of the initial capital stock\n\\(K(0)\\) and then settles on a saving behaviour that satisfies the\nRamsey Rule. \n\nExponential growth in our linear economy (eq. 11a) tells us that\nthe saving rate should be constant. Let us define the saving\nrate, \\(s\\), as the proportion of output (GDP) that is\ninvested at each instant. Then equation (1) can be re-written as \n\nEquation (15) says that intended saving equals intended investment.\nIntegrating equation (15) yields \n\nBut we are insisting that both \\(K(t)\\) and \\(C(t)\\) should grow at\nthe same rate. Equations (14) and (16) therefore imply \n\nThe saving rate in equation (17) is the optimum. So we write it as\n\\(s^*\\). Thus \n\nEquations (16)–(18) tell us that the optimum rate of growth of\nconsumption, \\(g^*\\), is \n\n\\[\\tag{19}\ng^* = \\frac{\\mu -\\delta}{\\sigma} \\gt 0\n\\]\n\n \n\nNotice also that if \\(\\delta = 0\\), equation (18) reduces to \n\nEquation (20) offers as elegant a simplified answer as there could\nbe to the question with which Ramsey started his paper. \n\nThe linear technology (eq. 11a) and the iso-elastic\n\\(U\\)-function (eq. 11b) allowed us to recognise immediately\nthat if a consumption stream satisfying the Ramsey Rule is to be the\noptimum, both capital and consumption should grow at the same\nexponential rate, \\(m\\). Identifying a sufficient condition for\noptimality in more general models is a lot more difficult. What we need\nis a condition on the long-run features of a consumption stream\nsatisfying the Ramsey Rule that can ensure it is the optimum. von\nWeizsacker (1965) showed that the required condition relates to the\nlong-run behaviour of the social value of capital associated with that\nconsumption stream. We now formalize the condition. \n\nLet \\(U\\) be the unit of account. Consider a consumption stream\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\). It follows that \\(U_{C(t)}\\) is the social worth of a\nmarginal unit of consumption. Write \\(P(t)\\) for \\(U_{C(t)}. P(t)\\)\nis called the (spot) accounting price of consumption. Because\n\\(e^{-\\delta t}P(t)\\) is the discounted value of \\(P(t)\\), it is\ncalled the present-value accounting price of consumption. If\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) satisfies the Ramsey Rule in Mark III,\n\\(e^{-\\delta t}P(t)\\) is also the present-value accounting price of a\nunit of capital stock.  von Weizsacker (1965) showed that a sufficient\ncondition for the optimality of \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) is \\(e^{-\\delta\nt}P(t)K(t) \\rightarrow A\\) as t \\(\\rightarrow \\infty\\), where \\(A\\) is\na (finite) non-negative number. In words, a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for \\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) to be the optimum is (i) that it satisfies\nthe Ramsey Rule, and (ii) that the present-value of the\neconomy’s stock of capital is finite. Condition (ii), which is\nwidely known as the “transversality condition,” eliminates\nthose feasible consumption streams that satisfy the Ramsey Rule but\nalong which there is excessive saving. A simple calculation confirms\nthat in Example 2 the transversality condition is satisfied if the\nsaving rate is \\(s^*\\) (eq. 18). \n\nEquation (18) says that \\(s^*\\) is an increasing function of the\nreturn on investment \\((\\mu)\\), a decreasing function of the time rate of\ndiscount \\((\\delta)\\), and a decreasing function of the elasticity of\nmarginal well-being \\((\\sigma)\\). Each of these properties is intuitively\nobvious: \n\n(1) The higher is the rate of return on investment \\((\\mu)\\), the\ngreater is the gain to future generations from a marginal increase in\nsaving by initial generations. That says the optimum rate of saving\nshould be an increasing function of \\(\\mu\\), other things equal. \n\n(2) The larger is the value of the time discount rate \\((\\delta)\\)\nchosen by DM, the lower is the weight that she awards to the well-being\nof future generations. That implies higher optimum consumption levels\nfor early generations (Sect. 2.1), which in turn implies that the\noptimum rate of saving is lower, other things equal. \n\n(3) As the return on investment is positive \\((\\mu \\gt 0)\\), the arrow\nof time displays a bias in favour of future generations (Sect. 2.1).\nBut the larger is the chosen value of \\(\\sigma\\), the more DM displays\nconcerns over equity in consumption across the generations. Therefore,\nthe larger is that concern, the higher is the optimum rate of\nconsumption to be enjoyed by initial generations. So we should expect\nthe optimum rate of saving to be a decreasing function of \\(\\sigma\\),\nother things equal. \n\nIt is instructive to consider stylized figures for the parameters on\nthe right-hand-sides of equations (18) and (19), respectively. Although\nstylized, they are figures for the pair of ethical parameters \\(\\sigma\\)\nand \\(\\delta\\) that economists who have written on the economics of\nclimate change have assumed in their work. To be sure, the welfare\neconomics of climate change has demanded more complicated models than\nthe model that is represented in equations (1) and (11a), but as we\nconfirm below, it has not offered any additional theoretical\ninsights. In what follows we take a year to be the unit of time and\nassume that \\(\\mu = 0.05\\) (i.e., 5% a year). Along the optimum, the\nconsumption rate of interest equals the rate of return on investment\n(the Ramsey Rule), which means that the optimum consumption rate of\ninterest equals a constant 5% a year. \n\nA figure of 5% a year for \\(\\mu\\) implies a capital-output ratio\n\\((1/\\mu)\\) of 20 years, which is far higher than the estimates of\ncapital-output ratios from inter-industry studies that economists in\nvarious parts of the world have arrived at (Behrman, 2001); a\nrepresentative figure for 1/\\(\\mu\\) in that literature is 3 years. But\ntheir estimates have been based on a definition of\n“capital” that is confined to “produced”\ncapital, such as factories, roads, ports, and buildings. Human capital\n(education, health, knowledge) is missing from them, as is natural\ncapital (ecosystems, sub-soil resources). Ramsey’s model, as\nencapsulated in equation (11a), embraces all forms of capital goods. No\ndoubt his formulation requires a heroic (read, impossible!) feat of\naggregation, but when all capital goods that enter production are taken\ninto account, we should expect an aggregate capital-output ratio (which\nwe should call the (inclusive) wealth-output ratio), to be a lot higher\nthan 3 years; perhaps even higher than 20 years (Arrow et al., 2012,\n2013). Large categories of capital goods are absent from the national\neconomic accounts that inform we economists’ understanding of\nproduction and consumption possibilities (Dasgupta, 2019). It would\nthus seem there is still a long way to go before we can reach a good\napproximation of what we should bequeath to our descendants. \n\nExample 3 (taken from the economics of climate\nchange) \nWe now turn our attention to the values of the two ethical parameters\nin equation (11b) that were chosen by three economists in their study\nof the economics of climate change. \n(NB: \\(\\sigma = 1\\) corresponds to the logarithmic well-being function,\nthat is \\(U(C) =\\) log\\(C\\), and can be obtained as\na limit of the functional form of \\(U(C)\\) in equation\n(11b) as \\(\\sigma \\rightarrow 1.)\\) \n\nWe impose those parameter values to find that the optimum saving\nrate \\(s^*\\) (eq. 18) and the optimum rate of growth of consumption\n(eq. 19) are, in turn: \n\nA national saving rate of 40% (eq. 21b) is no doubt high by the\nstandards of contemporary western economies, but there are countries\nthat in recent years have achieved 40–45% saving rates (China is\na prominent example). A figure of 67% for \\(s^*\\) (eq. 21a) is higher\nthan the saving rate in any country, but is not beyond belief. The\ntruly outlandish figures is 98% (eq. 21c). It is outlandish\nespecially because the figure is the optimum saving rate no matter how\nsmall \\(K(0)\\) happens to be.  Admittedly, the model here\n(eqs. 11a–b) is phenomenally stylized, but it does bring out\nsharply the observation of Koopmans (1965), that it is foolish to\nassume \\(\\delta = 0\\) (or close to 0) without first checking its\npossible consequences for the distribution of well-being across the\ngenerations. \n\nEquation (19) has shown that the optimum growth rate of consumption\nis bounded above by \\(\\mu\\), which explains why \\(g^*\\) is less than\n5% a year for each of the three parametric specifications we have\nconsidered. The specifications come from three studies in the\nwelfare economics of global climate change, in which the authors worked\nwith models that are a lot more complex than Ramsey’s. And yet\ntheir findings are exactly what his formulation would point to\n(Dasgupta, 2008), namely, that other things equal, the lower is the\nchosen value of \\(\\delta\\) and/or the larger is the damage to future\nwell-being that is expected to be caused by global climate change, the\ngreater is the investment level DM should recommend to avert climate\nchange or soften the effects of that change on human well-being. The\noften shrill debate (e.g., Nordhaus, 2007) on the extent to which\nglobal investment should be directed at reducing the deletarious\neffects of climate change was spurred by differences in model\nspecification among climate-change economists. \n\nThe linear technology (eq. 11a) and the iso-elastic\n\\(U\\)-function (eq. 11b), when taken together, have offered\ndeep insights even though we have restricted the discussion to\npen-and-paper calculations here. The functional forms are not\nbelievable; nevertheless, Ramsey made use of them. His paper showed\nthat unbelievably simplified models, provided their construction is\nbacked by strong intuition, can illuminate questions that are\nseemingly impossible to frame, let alone to answer\nquantitatively. That has been Ramsey’s enduring gift to\ntheoretical economics.","contact.mail":"pd10000@cam.ac.uk","contact.domain":"cam.ac.uk"}]
