He translated Nemesius of Emesa’s On the Nature of\nMan into Georgian, a work which in that day attracted considerable\nattention. Of particular importance is his Georgian translation of\nProclus’s Elementatio theologica, to which he also wrote a\nstep-by-step commentary. Petrizi’s commentary on the Elementatio\ntheologica represents a significant effort at reception inasmuch\nas the Georgian philosopher interprets the work immanently, that is, on\nthe basis of Proclus’s philosophy itself. Therefore, he definitely\ndeserves to receive increased attention in presentations and\nreconstructions of the philosophy of Proclus, and especially in\nresearch on medieval Proclus commentaries. Up to now, the standard\neditions of the Elementatio theologica only mention Petrizi’s\nProclus work in passing (if at all), or even criticize it unjustly\n(Dodds, pp. xli–xlii, 343; cf. in more detail Iremadze,\nKonzeptionen, pp. 225–231). Research on the Georgian\ntranslation and interpretation of the Elementatio theologica\nin the context of Byzantine and Latin Proclus\ninterpreters—Nicholas of Methone (12th century),\nBerthold of Moosburg (14th century), Henry Bate of Mechelen\n(13th century)—will close this gap in Proclus\nresearch. Furthermore, the reception by Byzantine philosophers of the\n11th and 12th centuries (Psellos, Italos) should\nnot be overlooked.\n\n\nTo date there is no reliable information on Petrizi’s dates and\nbiography. According to older Georgian research, he lived in the second\nhalf of the 11th century and the first half of the\n12th century. More recent research, however, tends to date\nhim to the second half of the 12th century. The state of\nresearch is aggravated by the lack of information on Petrizi. The\nlittle personal information that is known about him stems from remarks\nscattered through his works in which Petrizi briefly speaks about\nhimself. In his Proclus commentary—the Interpretation of\nthe Elementatio theologica of Proclus—and in the\nPostscript, which is traditionally ascribed to him, the author\nmentions his own cares and problems. According to authoritative reports, Petrizi translated Nemesius of\nEmesa’s work On the Nature of Man into Georgian\n(Petrizi, Opera II, p. 223).  According to these accounts,\nPetrizi encountered numerous difficulties and obstacles put in his way\nby both Greeks and Georgians because of his work. Based on the current\nstate of research on his work and on his biography, together with a\ndetailed study of his Proclus Commentary, Petrizi can be characterized\nas a 12th-century thinker. The character of Georgian\nthought in the 12th century is manifested in his style of\nphilosophizing and in his manner of presenting arguments, in his\nknowledge of ancient philosophy and in his intellectual interest in\nmaintaining ancient thought in its rightful place. \n\nPetrizi names the philosophers whom he treated in his\nInterpretation: Orpheus, Parmenides, Zeno, Plato, Aristotle,\nAlexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry and the Fathers of the Church\n(Petrizi, Opera I, pp. XXVI–LII; Alexidse,\npp. 148–168). He held Platonic philosophy in particularly high\nesteem. Its representatives included in his view both Plato’s\npredecessors (Orpheus, Pythagoras, etc.) and the neo-Platonists. He\ncalls Plato ‘the philosopher of the day’\n(Petrizi, Opera I, p.  XXVII). When Petrizi speaks of the\n‘philosopher’, he means Proclus. By contrast, in the Latin\nmiddle ages, the designation\nphilosophus was reserved for Aristotle. Among Plato’s works,\nPetrizi refers to the dialogues Parmenides, the Laws,\nPhaedrus, Phaedo and Timaeus. Although he does not\nmention them, he also quotes Theaetetus and the\nSymposium (Petrizi, Opera II, pp. 34, 84). Petrizi\nalso mentions various works of Aristotle’s, but not the\npseudo-Aristotelian works used by Scholastic philosophers (Iremadze,\nKonzeptionen, p. 57). It can be gathered from his\nInterpretation that in addition to the Elementatio\ntheologica he also knew other works by Proclus (for example the\nParmenides and Timaeus commentaries as well as the\nPlatonic Theology) and drew on them as he saw fit in\ncommenting on the Elementatio theologica (Iremadze,\nKonzeptionen, p. 57). \n\nPetrizi’s commentary on Proclus’s Elementatio theologica\nconsists of a Preface (Introduction) and the commentaries to each\nchapter of this work. In Sh. Nutsubidze and S. Kaukhchishvili’s\nedition of Petrizi’s Proclus Commentary, these commentaries\nare followed by an epilogue. In his Introduction to the Elementatio\ntheologica, Joane Petrizi reflects on the sense (the\nintentio) of this book, and sees it in the proof of ‘the\nmuch discussed One’ (Petrizi, Commentaries, p. 149).\nThen he briefly treats the peculiarity of the One, which in his opinion\nis not identical with any being. The pure and genuine One must be\nexamined and proved in accordance with the rules of syllogisms\n(Petrizi, Opera II, p. 3). According to Petrizi’s exegesis,\nthis One is the crucial concept in the overall process of grounding\nknowledge. If this principle is not provable, there are no\nincontrovertible propositions and the goal of gnoseology will not be\nreached. The One is the principle that makes knowledge possible. In the\nfirst chapter of his Elementatio theologica, Proclus treated\nthe One as the origin of all modes of multiplicity. Petrizi follows\nthis in his commentary to this proposition, presenting the arguments\nfor Proclus’s approach in his own way. Petrizi adheres primarily to the\nbasic axiom that the chain of beings requires an origin. Otherwise the\nuniverse would have its origin in an Other, which for its part would\nhave to be the One inasmuch as the first principle (= the One) should\ncomprise all entities of the cosmos without exception. The One as the\ncause and origin of being as such is deemed to be the better, and takes\non no qualities from what it causes. This One alone confers selfness to\nall other entities because, as the generator and principle of\neverything that follows it, it is in need of nothing. The essential\nfeatures of the One (goodness, unity) are visible in each creature. If\nthe one were of the same value as the rest of being, then cosmic\nharmony and its order would fail; furthermore, it would not be possible\nto distinguish between the first and the last in the\nseries (Petrizi, Opera II, prop. 1, p. 13). The universe would\nthus have no first and no last reference point, no\norigin and no unities following it. It is precisely on the\nimpossibility of such an assumption that Petrizi’s ontological\nreflections were based. In Petrizi’s view, the One is identical with\nthe Good. All Being presupposes the first Good because all creatures of\nnature participate in this good and only possess good qualities by\nvirtue of their participation. Being is not by its own nature the Good,\nbut becomes a Good subsequently, by participation in the One.\nTherefore, in Petrizi’s view a distinction must be made between the\nGood in itself and good entities inasmuch as the former is\nabove all nature and is a pure good in itself. Therefore, it is also\nthe goal of all Being, which constantly strives for it inasmuch as each\ncaused thing reverts to the cause (Petrizi, Opera II, prop. 8,\np. 33). The Good is the archetype of Being as such, which, as its\nimage, also derives its status in the cosmos through participation in\nthe Good. This is so because of the identity of the Good with the One.\nBecause all entities only appear by virtue of participation in the One,\nand because the One, taken in itself, is a pure Good, the Good is also\ndeemed to be the ultimate source and the super-simple reference point\nof the universe. To characterize the Good, Petrizi adduces and uses\nprinciples from Plato’s Phaedrus, treating the various degrees\nof goodness. The first Good heads the Good, and thereafter follow the\nvarious levels of goodnesses. The good is also deemed to be the\nprinciple of order and structuring of Being. That which is first to be\nlinked to it has traces of the Good in itself, and the first\nmonads also have such a nature. It is precisely in these first entities\nthat Beauty and the Good are found (Petrizi, Opera II, prop.\n8, p. 34). \n\nIn his Proclus Commentary, Joane Petrizi analyses the\ndialectic hidden in the ‘cause’ and the\n‘caused’ more thoroughly and in more detail than does\nProclus himself in the corresponding chapters of his Elementatio\ntheologica. In Petrizi’s exegesis, the abstract, mathematical\nstyle of this work is augmented in content with a wealth of material.\nPetrizi operates very often with visually illustrative examples, and is\ncareful to illuminate the theorems set forth in the Elementatio\ntheologica by means of human experience. This resulted from the\ngoals of his Interpretation. It primarily addressed a broad\npublic and served the study of this significant work from Greek\nantiquity. Petrizi treats the problem of the cause and the caused from\nvarious perspectives, for the treatment of this topic proved to be of\nfundamental importance for the logical structure of his philosophical\nproject. In Proposition 30, he treats the traditional view of the\ndialectic of causality in detail, examining the etymological meanings\nof the terms characteristically used in Greek for this relationship\n(Petrizi, Opera II, prop. 30, pp. 79–81). The dialectic of\ncausality becomes manifest in the process of the descent from the One\nto the Many and the ascent from the Many to the One. The cause is the\nphase within the entirety of emanation that generates, that which thus\nhas priority both in ontological and in axiological terms\nvis-à-vis the caused inasmuch as in the neo-Platonic system of\ngeneration the generator is better than the generated. With regard to\nthe problem of causality, Petrizi applied the criticism of the\nPeripatetic doctrine of principles in critical discussion of the\nAristotelian concept of causes. In the realm of theoretical philosophy,\nthe system of four causes proved to be inadequate and flawed. In this\ncontext, it seemed to Petrizi to be necessary to work out a new\nconception of causality. He studied Proclus’s philosophy on the basis\nof Greek sources, and regarded it as appropriate to his research goals\nto adopt the existing structure of the system of causes. In this point,\nhe worked in the same way as Byzantine philosophers of the time such as\nPsellos and Italos, who recognized the priority of Platonic philosophy\non this issue. In Proposition 75 of his commentary, Petrizi\ndistinguishes five different modes of causa, characterizing\nthem in nuce. He adds a fifth kind of causa to the\ntraditional system of causes. In addition to the material, formal,\nfinal and efficient causes he conceives a creative cause (Petrizi,\nOpera II, prop. 75, p. 136). It was, he claims, neglected in\nthe Aristotelians’ theoretical work, who, in contrast to Proclus,\nhad underestimated the relevance of the creative cause. This applies\nboth to Aristotle and to his interpreters, above all Alexander of\nAphrodisias, whom Petrizi criticizes in this connection (Petrizi,\nOpera II, prop. 11, p. 38). \n\nOne of the most important aspects of Petrizi’s philosophy is his\nepistemology. It has only recently been reconstructed and\nsystematically researched in the light of the medieval discussion of\nthe essence of thought (cf. Iremadze, Konzeptionen, pp.\n161–241). In his epistemology, Petrizi emphasizes the productive power\nof (human) reason, which is capable of the real positing of being as\nsuch and is thus a determinative principle of being. \n\nJoane Petrizi is the most widely read Georgian philosopher.\nPetrizi’s Proclus Commentary with his Georgian translation of\nthe Elementatio theologica had a major influence not only on\nGeorgian philosophy and culture, but also outside of Georgia. In 1248,\nthe Armenian monk Svimeon translated Petrizi’s Proclus work into\nArmenian, thus contributing to the dissemination of the philosophy of\nProclus there. In the 17th century, Armenian philosophers\ndevoted intensive work to Proclus’s thought, to which they attributed\ncontemporary relevance; in 1651, the Armenian bishop Svimeon Dshughaezi\nwrote commentaries to facilitate the understanding of the\nElementatio theologica. The basis for his commentary was the\n13th-century Armenian translation by the monk Svimeon of\nPetrizi’s Georgian translation. In 1757, these commentaries, together\nwith the Armenian version of the Elementatio theologica, were\ntranslated into Georgian; they have made a clear mark on Georgian\nculture. Thus, in the 18th century there were at least two\ndifferent commentaries on the Elementatio theologica in\nGeorgian. It must be emphasized that the thinkers of the Georgian\nEnlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries\nreacted to these traditions in diverse ways. Some trenchantly\ncriticized the Armenian version with reference to its contents (see\nbelow on Anton Bagrationi). But one point is certain: in the modern era in\nGeorgia, Proclus’s philosophy was the subject of intensive\nconsideration and interest by virtue of Petrizi’s works. Let us here\nhave a look at three important stages of the Georgian reception of\nProclus and Petrizi. \n\n(1) Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani (1658–1726) integrates numerous\ntheorems from Petrizi’s Proclus work into his Georgian\nDictionary. In the definition and discussion of the problem of\nknowledge, he refers to the 20th proposition of\nthe Interpretation and determines reason as the simple,\nbodiless knowledge of the known (Orbeliani, vol. I, p. 166,\ncol. 1–2). Other important philosophical definitions—for\nexample the determination of real being (Orbeliani, vol. I, p. 574,\ncol. 1), of production (Orbeliani, vol. II, p. 366, col. 2; p. 367,\ncol. 1), of causality (Orbeliani, vol. I, p.  480, col. 1–2), of\nmotion (Orbeliani, vol. I, p. 479, col. 2)—are taken from\nPetrizi’s Proclus Commentary. In his\nGeorgian Dictionary, Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani made equally\nintensive reference to Petrizi’s Georgian translation of the work\nOn the Nature of Man by Nemesius of Emesa. \n\n(2) In his philosophical work Spekali (1752), the\nphilosopher and theologian Anton Bagrationi (1720–1788) refers to\nPetrizi’s Interpretation, adopting numerous theorems of\nneo-Platonic origin from him. Anton Bagrationi took some chapters\ndevoted to Proclus’s problem of knowledge almost verbatim from\nPetrizi’s work (Anton I., Spekali, pp. 327–331). The last\nchapters of Spekali are devoted to Petrizi. In chapters 148\nand 149, Anton Bagrationi treats the topic of knowledge on the basis of\nthe propositions on nous in the Interpretation.\nFollowing Petrizi, it is here claimed that reasoned knowledge\nis different from the soul’s mode of knowledge. In its essence, the\nactivity and the substance of reason are a unity, whereas the nature of\nthe soul shows itself to be differentiated. The essence and\nthe activity of the soul can be distinguished inasmuch as knowledge is\nnot the primary quality of the soul. In its knowledge, the\nsoul proceeds from one being to another, that is, the acquired insights\nare deemed to be the bases for the progress of knowledge. The knowledge\nof reason has to be characterized differently, for its\nactivity is grounded in eternal knowing and can be seen as\nnothing other than this activity. At this point it must be remarked\nthat Anton Bagrationi made intensive use of the noetic\nterminology of Petrizi’s Proclus Commentary to characterize\nhis concept of knowledge. His significant philosophical determinations\nof noetics were worked out exclusively with reference to Petrizi. Anton\nBagrationi was trenchantly critical of the Armenian version of the\nElementatio theologica inasmuch as it did not represent\nProclus’s or Petrizi’s genuine doctrine. In his work Theology,\nof which a critical edition has not yet been published, he claims that\ntrue metaphysics was there combined with false theories and thus\ndisfigured. In his opinion, the old version (that is, Petrizi’s\nversion) of the Elementatio theologica should be studied\nrather than the new (Armenian) version. Admittedly, he sided with\nPetrizi in this point: Petrizi’s interpretation of Proclus’s philosophy\nshould be accepted rather than its arbitrary transformation by modern\nArmenian and Georgian interpreters. \n\n(3) In contrast to Anton Bagrationi, Joane Bagrationi\n(1768–1830) mainly relied on the Armenian commentaries on\nthe Elementatio theologica in his main\nwork, Kalmasoba, which is written in dialogue form. In the\ndetermination of the One and its dialectics, he quotes the first\nchapters of Proclus’s work. Furthermore, the chapters on nous\n(for example prop. 20) are given adequate consideration\nin Kalmasoba. In this work, Joane Bagrationi does not comment\non all the chapters of the Elementatio theologica; a total of\n86 chapters were commented on. It is remarkable that the author\ninterprets or transforms some passages of Proclus’s and Petrizi’s work\nin an original manner; in the discussion of the problem of cause, he\nbegins by distinguishing three main kinds—God, nature and\nskill—and emphasizes God’s superiority to all other\ncauses. Joane Bagrationi made use of Svimeon Dshughaezi’s\ncommentaries, attempting to interpret Proclus and Petrizi with their\nhelp. Furthermore, Joane Bagrationi brought clarity to the noetics of\nthe Elementatio theologica, characterizing the various kinds\nand functions of knowledge and designating the knowing soul as\nspecific to man. \n\nAlthough Joane Petrizi’s work received increasing attention in the\ncourse of time and Georgian thinkers always emphasized his intellectual\nheritage, a thorough-going scholarly treatment of Petrizi’s works only\nreally began in the 20th century. Without a doubt, the most\nimportant stage in Petrizi research is represented by the publication\nof a scholarly edition of Petrizi’s philosophical works. The edition\nbegan in 1937 with the publication of the second volume of Petrizi’s\nProclus work—the Intertpretation of the “Elementatio\ntheologica” of Proclus. This volume was edited by Sh.\nNutsubidze and S. Kaukhchishvili; it includes a comprehensive and\nvaluable study of Petrizi’s philosophy in which the teaching of the\nGeorgian philosopher is viewed as reflected by his contemporaries and\nanalysed with reference to Byzantine and Georgian medieval thought. The\nfirst volume of Petrizi’s Proclus work (The Elementatio theologica\nof the Platonic Philosopher Proclus) was published in 1940. This\nvolume contains the Georgian translation of the Elementatio\ntheologica from the Greek. The editor was S. Kaukhchishvili; M.\nGogiberidze wrote an introduction to the volume. It also contains a\ncomprehensive vocabulary for both volumes, also compiled by S.\nKaukhchishvili. In the 20th century, Petrizi’s\nInterpretation was translated into Russian. The Russian\ntranslation of 1984 with an introduction and annotations by G. Tevzadze\nis of particular importance. After the publication of scholarly\neditions of Petrizi’s works, both philosophical and philological\nproblems of the Proclus commentary have been subject to thorough-going\nresearch (for a detailed account of the state of Petrizi research, cf.\nIremadze, Konzeptionen, pp. 13–27).","contact.mail":"tiremadze@hotmail.com","contact.domain":"hotmail.com"}]
