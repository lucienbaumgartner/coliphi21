In all cases,\nhis opposition to the philosophers was based on his belief that their\npassion for explanation unwittingly led them to confuse conditions of\nconceptualization with conditions of existence, thereby denying all\nroom for individual freedom or for a personal God. Jacobi made this\npoint, in defence of individualism and personalistic values, in a\nnumber of public controversies, in the course of which he put in\ncirculation expressions and themes that resonate to this day. He was\nthe one who invited Lessing, who he thought was walking on his head in\nthe manner of all philosophers, to perform a salto mortale (a\njump heels over head) that would redress his position and thus allow\nhim to move again on the ground of common sense. He was also\nresponsible for forging the concept of ‘nihilism’ —\na condition of which he accused the philosophers — and thereby\ninitiating the discourse associated with it. His battle cry, which he\nfirst directed at the defenders of Enlightenment rationalism and then\nat Kant and his successors, was that ‘consistent philosophy is\nSpinozist, hence pantheist, fatalist and atheist’. The formula\nhad the effect of bringing Spinoza to the centre of the philosophical\ndiscussion of the day. In the face Kant and his idealistic successors,\nJacobi complained that they had subverted the language of the\n‘I’ by reintroducing it on the basis of abstractions that\nin fact negated its original value. They had thus replaced real\nselfhood with the mere illusion of one.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the most influential of Jacobi’s formulas was the claim\nthat there is no ‘I’ without a ‘Thou’, and\nthat the two can recognize and respect one another only in the\npresence of a transcendent and personal God. Because of his defence of\nthe individual and the ‘exception’, Jacobi is sometime\ntaken as a proto-existentialist. This view must be balanced by the\nconsideration that Jacobi was a defender of conservative values that\nhe felt threatened by the culture of the day; that he never considered\nhimself an irrationalist; on the contrary, that he thought his\n‘faith’ to be essentially and truly rational; and that he\ntried more than once to develop a positive theory of reason. As a\nliterary figure, he criticized the Sturm und Drang movement\nand dramatized in two novels the problem of reconciling individualism\nwith social obligation. An exponent of British economic and political\nliberalism, Jacobi was an early critic of the French revolution, the\ndestructiveness of which he considered the practical counterpart of\nthe speculative nihilism of the philosophers.\n\n\n\nLike his junior contemporary Goethe (1749–1832), Friedrich Heinrich\nJacobi was blessed with a long life, at least as measured by the\nstandards of the time, and had the good fortune of witnessing in its\ncourse events that radically altered the cultural and political face\nof Western\n Europe.[1]\n Jacobi saw the Enlightenment (die Aufklärung) take hold\nin the German lands, and reach maturity in a peculiarly German\ncultural form. He saw it as it nurtured ideas of subjectivity and\nnature, and an interest in history, that were the precursors of later\nRomanticism. He saw it also as it was violently, even brutally,\ndisrupted in the last decade of the eighteenth century by the events\nsurrounding the French Revolution; and, finally, as it gave way to the\nnew order of the nineteenth century. Despite long bouts of illness,\nJacobi was deeply involved in these world shaking events, and actively\ncontributed to them. He may not have had the political and military\nengagement of a Goethe, who could combine vast literary activities\nwith weighty state responsibilities, but he was certainly an\ninfluential cultural and political commentator. Jacobi contributed\nenormously, throughout his active life, to the shaping of educated\nGerman public opinion. \n\nJacobi also had the good fortune of belonging to a privileged segment\nof society. The Enlightenment as well as the French revolution\npresented him with more than just an intellectual challenge. In their\ndifferent ways (which, as will be seen in Section 3, Jacobi however\nthought to have much in common), they both threatened the system of\nvalues that justified his social status. In the case of the French\nrevolution, the threat was physical as well, since the events in\nFrance spilled over across the Rhine and were the cause for a time of\nmuch dislocation in his life. There were, in other words, interests\nother than purely intellectual that must have motivated his reaction\nto philosophy and philosophers and which would have to come under\nclose scrutiny in a full study of Jacobi’s life. They can however be\nabstracted from when the main interest, as here, is with the internal\nlogic, or lack of it, of his view of things. A quick review of the\nmain events and the more influential circumstances of his life is none\nthe less in order, at least as signposts of his intellectual\ncareer. \n\nJacobi was born in Düsseldorf, on January 25, 1743, the second\nson of a well-to-do merchant. His older brother, Johann Georg, was the\none selected by the family for an intellectual career, and he did\nachieve indeed a certain notoriety as a poet in the sentimental style\nof Gleim. The task of pursuing the commercial activities of the family\nwas reserved for the younger Jacobi. There also were two daughters in\nthe family, half-sisters to Jacobi. Neither of them married, and they\neventually took over the management of Jacobi’s household. According\nto his own account, (Jacobi, 1785: 8; 1787, 67ff; 1789, 328ff ) Jacobi\nwas temperamentally given to extremes of piety from his early youth,\nand was constantly troubled by questions concerning the existence of\nGod and the endlessness of time. After confirmation, he joined a\nsociety of pietists in whose company these tendencies were\nreinforced. At sixteen, after a brief and disappointing apprenticeship\nin a Frankfurt commercial house, he was sent in 1759 to Geneva to\ndevelop there the social skills required for his appointed\nvocation. It is in that city that Jacobi, exposed to French ideas, as\nhe matured socially, at the same time also formulated the basic\nbeliefs that were to guide his intellectual career to the end. Under\nthe tutelage of the famous mathematician G.L. Le Sage, he became\nacquainted with traditional scholastic metaphysics. But he also worked\non the writings of Charles de Bonnet, in which he found elements of\npsychological sensualism combined (allegedly even harmonized) with\nsuch Christian beliefs as the after-life, and read Rousseau’s\nEmile (1761). Appended to the latter was the so titled\n‘Profession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar’, a manifesto\nupholding the rights of the ‘heart’ against the religion\nof reason popular among the rationalist philosophers of the\nday. Jacobi’s resolution, at the time, was never to accept a system of\nthought unless it could be tested against actual existence and did not\ncontradict his yearnings for God. \n\nBack in Germany in 1762, Jacobi continued his philosophical studies.\nHe eagerly read the essays submitted by Moses Mendelssohn and Kant in\nresponse to the competition sponsored that year by the Berlin Academy\non the theme, ‘Concerning Evidence in the Metaphysical\nSciences’. According to his own account, Jacobi found Kant’s\nessay much more convincing than Mendelssohn’s, though first prize was\nawarded to the latter (Jacobi, 1787: 74–75). He apparently also\nengaged in the study of Spinoza, and was impressed by Kant’s essay on\n‘The Only Possible Ground for a Proof of God’s Existence’\n(Jacobi, 1787: 78–88). In 1764 he took charge of his father’s business\nand — after an affair with a housemaid with whom he conceived a\nson, both of whom (housemaid and son) he treated very shabbily by\nmodern standards (Booy/Mortier, 1966) — married the richly\nendowed Betty von Clermont. Together with her, he established the\nalready mentioned literary salon at Pempelfort. \n\nIn 1772 Jacobi entrusted all his business affairs in the hands of his\ncapable brother-in-law and accepted an invitation to join the\ngoverning body of the Duchy of Julich and Berg. His commission was to\nsupervise the rationalization of local manufacturing and taxation\npractices. In 1779, he was also invited to Munich to conduct a similar\nreform in the Bavarian lands. In the same year, however, these\nofficial activities also came abruptly to an end. Jacobi’s liberal\nviews quickly came under attack in the Court at Munich, and, embroiled\nin bitter controversies, Jacobi returned to his native\nDüsseldorf. The literary fall out of this episode was the\npublication (Jacobi, 1779 (1) & (2)) of two essays in which Jacobi\ndefended Adam Smith’s economic views. The first essay was published\nwhile Jacobi was still in office in Munich, and was itself a major\ncause of his troubles there. \n\nWhile engaged in these wordily affair, Jacobi had not abandoned his\nmore humanistic interests. He had already ventured in some minor\nliterary publications in association with his brother Georg while\nstill busy with his commercial practice in Düsseldorf. In 1772,\ntogether with Wieland, whom Jacobi had come to know through his\nbrother, he laid out the plans for a German journal patterned after\nthe Mercure de France. The Deutcher Merkur made its\nappearance soon after, under Wieland’s editorship. Jacobi used the\njournal as the vehicle of some of his occasional writings until 1777,\nwhen his collaboration with Wieland came to an end because of a bitter\ndisagreement between the two men on political issues (Jacobi, 1781,\n1782). More significant for Jacobi’s future were two other events that\ntook place in the following years. The first was Goethe’s visit to\nPempelfort in the company of Basedow and Lavater. The encounter\nbetween the already famous poet and Jacobi that followed was,\naccording to the reports left by both, of a highly emotionally charged\nnature (Prantl, 1881: 579). Each man made a deep impression on the\nother. Jacobi’s two novels, Allwill’s Briefsammlung and\nWoldemar, owe their origin to that event. They were Jacobi’s\nresponse to Goethe’s ardent request, made during the visit, that he\nput in writing all that was closest to his heart. As things turned\nout, Goethe quickly cooled towards Jacobi, much to the latter’s\ndisappointment, and was later (1779) to prove especially cruel towards\nhim by nailing to a tree (‘crucifying’), to the great\namusement of a large company, a copy of a just published new edition\nof the Woldemar (Stockum, 1957; Sudhof, 1959; di Giovanni,\n1994: 52–53). \n\nThe other event occurred on the occasion of a long journey that took\nJacobi, on July 5, 1780, to Wolfenbüttel, where Lessing was\nlibrarian at the Herzog August’s library. Jacobi immediately paid a\nvisit to the famous man, and it was there, while a guest at Lessing’s\nhouse, that Jacobi engaged his host in that now famous conversation in\nwhich, according to Jacobi’s report, Lessing declared himself to be a\nSpinozist (Jacobi, 1785: 10–45). This alleged revelation, made only a\nfew months before Lessing’s sudden death (1781), was to be the\noccasion of an exchange of letters between Jacobi and Moses\nMendelssohn on the nature of philosophy in general and Spinozism in\nparticular.  Mendelssohn was well known at the time as Lessing’s great\nfriend, and as himself an artificer of the German Enlightenment. The\nexchange began in 1783 (Jacobi, 1785: 1), and continued in a period of\ntime when Jacobi was deeply in sorrow because of the premature death\nof his beloved Betty (1784) and of a younger son, and was also\nsuffering from bad health. As the result of an intricate and\nunpleasant set of circumstances — one that was to provide fodder\nto opposing parties, in the dispute that soon followed, for\nquestioning the integrity of both Mendelssohn and Jacobi — the\nlatter published the letters in 1785, complete with commentary, under\nthe title of Concerning the Doctrine of Spinoza in Letters to Herr\nMoses Mendelssohn (Spinoza Letters). \n\nNobody could have predicted the extent and the fury of the controversy\nthat the publication of the book caused. The controversy goes in the\nliterature under the name of the Spinozism or the Pantheism\nDispute (Jacobi, 1916). Mendelssohn responded to Jacobi in writing\n(1786) but did not survive to see his reply in print. Already in bad\nhealth, he died (4 January 1786). Jacobi responded to the\nreply (1786). Both publications were notable for their bitterly\npersonal tone. In retrospect, the controversy itself and the personal\ntone it assumed made sense, since the issues that Jacobi had raised\nhad put into question the nature and the value of the new humanism\nbeing sponsored by the Enlightenment. As Goethe was to remark many\nyears later, the controversy touched everyone in their deepest\n convictions.[2]\n Mendelssohn’s death caused the debate to become even more personal,\nfor his defenders (notably the Berlin’s Aufklärer led by\nNicolai) used it as an occasion to raise their hero to the status of\nmartyr. One can gather a detailed account of the events, seen from\nJacobi’s point of view, in the latter’s thick correspondence with\nHamann of those years (Jacobi/Hamann, 1955–1979). Hamann sided with\nJacobi, though his irrepressibly eccentric self could not refrain from\nrepeatedly poking fun at his friend. Two unforeseen results of the\nepisode were that Jacobi, until then a peripheral author, was\npropelled to the centre of public attention; and Spinoza’s philosophy,\nalready influential among the literary circles of the Sturm und\nDrang but otherwise traditionally rejected by the philosophers of\nthe schools, became an object of philosophical discussion. \n\nIn 1787 Jacobi published David Hume on Faith, or Idealism and\nRealism, a Dialogue. In it he tried to clear himself of the\ncharge of irrationalism brought against him because of his defence of\nthe primacy of Glaube (‘faith’ or\n‘belief’) over reason in the still on-going controversy.\nThough appealing to the authority of Hume in this defence, Jacobi\nhowever also forcefully distanced himself from the latter’s scepticism\nby declaring the sense in which he was rather a realist. The dialogue\nappeared in the wake of the publication of the second edition of\nKant’s Critique of Pure Reason (1787), and included an\nappendix in which Kant’s transcendental idealism was severely\ncriticized. The appendix was to become a locus classicus of\nanti-Kantianism.  It eloquently restated all the main objections that\nhad already been raised against the Critique since its first\npublication, and were to be repeated again against it, in a variety of\nforms, in the years to come.  It is there that Jacobi made the famous\nquip: ‘Without the presupposition [of the “thing in itself,”] I\nwas unable to enter into [Kant’s] system, but with it I was unable to\nstay within it’ (Jacobi, 1787: 223). His point was that, in\npresupposing the allegedly unknown ‘thing in itself’, yet\nby assigning to it the many functions that it played in his system,\nKant was in fact demonstrating knowledge of it, thereby contradicting\nhis assumption of critical ignorance. The negative, even antagonistic,\nattitude that Jacobi assumed in this appendix overshadowed the fact,\nhowever, that he had always felt close in spirit to Kant. He had felt\ndeeply hurt when Kant has sided with\n Mendelssohn[3]\n in the still on-going dispute. More important, it also overshadowed\nthe fact that Jacobi had already developed a much more constructive\ncritique of transcendental idealism, and had even offered a\nsophisticated alternative to it, in the body of the dialogue itself,\nwhile expounding his own realism (see Section 2.2). This is an aspect\nof the dialogue that was not lost on some of Kant’s own disciples, and\nwas a factor in the development of post-Kantian idealism. \n\nIn 1789 a second, much enlarged, edition of the Spinoza-Letters\nwent to press. It reflected the recent publication of Kant’s\nCritique of Practical Reason (1788). Among many additions, it\nincluded two prefatory sets of theses, the first denying human\nfreedom, the second asserting it, together suggesting a resolution of\nthe antinomy between nature and freedom quite different than the one\nproposed by Kant. It also included a number of new appendices, one of\nthem sharply criticizing Herder, whose idea of God amounted, in\nJacobi’s opinion, to a half-baked\n pantheism.[4]\n (Jacobi, 1789: 349–357) Jacobi’s prefatory theses on human freedom\nwere to be highly influential in the debate on the subject soon to\nbreak out between K.L Reinhold and C. C. E. Schmid.  (di Giovanni,\n2001) The debate quickly implicated many other personalities, Fichte\namong them. \n\nThe following years were marked by the visits to Pempelfort of Hamann,\nStolberg, Herder, and Goethe (November 1792). Soon, however, political\nevents were to overtake philosophical discourse. The beheading in\nParis of Louis XVI (1793) shocked German public opinion, and\noccasioned Jacobi’s lament in ‘Accidental Outpourings of a\nLonely Thinker’ (Jacobi, 1795). In 1794, as the French\nrevolutionary armies crossed the Rhine and began bombarding\nDüsseldorf, Jacobi abandoned Pempelfort and undertook a long\nperegrination in the North, the guest of many friends in whose company\nhe found comfort (Prantl, 1881: 582). He settled for a time in Eutin.\nAt this time he began the composition of ‘Of Divine\nThings’, a manuscript that he completed and published only\nlater.  In 1799 he became involved in the so called ‘Atheism\ndispute’. This was a controversy surrounding the alleged atheism\nof Fichte which Jacobi himself had not initiated but in which he none\nthe less played a leading role. At the request of Lavater, he wrote an\nopen letter to Fichte (Jacobi, 1799) in which he restated all his\nobjections to philosophy in general and the new idealism in\nparticular, and reaffirmed his commitment to the primacy of faith. He\nalso singled out Fichte as one who had realized all his misgivings\nabout philosophy, since he had succeeded in restating Spinozism even\nfrom the standpoint of subjectivity. In a supplement (Supplement II)\nto the letter, Jacobi included a long comment on the nature of reason\nthat he reprinted in the second volume of his collected works (1815)as\nan independent essay under the title of ‘On the Inseparability\nof the Concept of Freedom and Providence from the Concept of\nReason’ (Jacobi, 1812–1825). In 1802, he published ‘On the\nUndertaking of Critique to Reduce Reason to Understanding’\n(Jacobi, 1802 (1)) — this latter directed particularly at\nKant. \n\nIn 1804, Jacobi suffered a drastic reversal of financial fortunes but\nwas spared a much reduced life-style by the call from Munich, late in\nthe same year, to work there at the reorganization of the Academy of\nthe Sciences. Jacobi accepted the invitation and in the following year\nmoved to Munich. He remained there until the end of his life. Elected\npresident of the reformed Academy in 1807, he unfortunately fed the\nanimosity already felt in Munich against the foreigners recently\ninvited to the Academy by implying in his inaugural speech a criticism\nof Southern Germany culture (Jacobi, 1807). He also antagonized\nSchelling, at that time Director of the Munich Academy of the Arts. In\n1809, in response to a writing of Schelling on human freedom that\ncontained pointed criticisms of his understanding of Spinoza, Jacobi\nresurrected his unfinished manuscript ‘Of Divine Things’,\ncompleted it as an obvious polemic against the new nature philosophy\nthat Schelling was promoting, and published it in 1811 under the title\nof ‘Of Divine Things and Their Revelation’ (Jacobi, 1811).\nThe essay provoked a reply from Schelling which, in turn, provoked a\ncounter reply by Jacobi. Thus arose the third of the major\ncontroversies in which Jacobi was involved — one even more\npersonal and bitter in tone than the earlier ones.  In 1812 Jacobi retired and, aided by his disciples\nJ. F. Köppen and C. J. F. Roth, began the preparation of his\ncollected works (Jacobi, 1812–25). Since the turn of the\ncentury, he had begun to attract to his side such younger figures as\nF. D. E. Schleiermacher, J.  F. Fries, and F. Bouterwek — newly\nestablished academics whose thought he had inspired but who, in turn,\ninfluenced his final definition of the nature of reason. They all\nshared a scientific positivism which they combined with a contrasting\nmoral/religious positivism — this latter based on the assumption\nthat higher values and the reality of divine things can be intuitively\nassessed by way of feeling. This younger generation helped to\npopularize some of Jacobi’s ideas and attitudes in the nineteenth\ncentury. Ironically, despite his life long opposition to Roman\nCatholicism, Jacobi exercised considerable influence in some German\nCatholic theological circles (Weindel, 1950).  In 1817, Jacobi made reference in a letter to his friend Johann\nNeeb to a favourable review of the second volume of his collected\nworks by Hegel (Jacobi, 1825–27: vol. 2, 467–68; di\nGiovanni, 1994: 165–166).  There was no apparent trace left in\nhis comments of the anger that Hegel’s essay, ‘Glauben und\nWissen’ (‘Faith and Knowledge’), had aroused in him\nin 1801 (Jacobi, 1803: 221). Jacobi allowed that Hegel’s\ninterpretation of his thought might be the correct one, and conceded\nthat the two men might come to a meeting of minds, were it not for old\nage that prevented him from studying Hegel’s philosophy. \n\nJacobi’s extensive travels took him to London in 1786 and to Paris in\n1801 (Prantl, 1881: 581, 582). Though first exposed to philosophy in a\nFrench cultural milieu, Jacobi was an Anglophile throughout his life\nand favourably compared British philosophers with the French\nphilosophes. He credited the British for never having denied\nthat virtue has value on its own; for never having made it just an\ninstrument of happiness. The French, on the contrary, the moment their\nphilosophizing progressed beyond mere common sense, were always all\ntoo prone in moral matters of falling into materialism (Jacobi,\n1812–125: vol. 5, 73–74). \n\nJacobi never saw the completion of the planned edition of his works.\nHe died on March 10, 1819. \n\nThe Spinoza Letters is a cumbersome work, its disjointed composition\nindicative of the haste with which it was put together. The first\nedition opens with the text of a poem by Goethe that was however\ndropped in the second edition. The poem carried the name of its author\nbut had been mechanically edited by Jacobi to bring out, by printing\ncertain key phrases in relief, images especially important to\nhim. Thus edited, the poem conveyed the idea that the pagan gods are\nMan writ large, and are therefore to be praised, since they reveal\nwhat is most noble in the human being. Brute nature is without\nfeelings or discernment, whereas humans can judge, draw distinctions,\nand dare the impossible. They transcend nature. This was a humanistic\nmessage with which Jacobi agreed wholeheartedly. After a brief\nexplanation of how the exchange of letters with Mendelssohn had\noriginated, the main text goes on with a somewhat abbreviated version\nof the correspondence itself. The first letter gave an account of the\nconversation Jacobi had had with Lessing on the subject of Spinoza\nduring his visit to Wolfenbüttel, and included the text of\nanother poem of Goethe — the Prometheus, one that had\nbeen the occasion of the conversation in the first place. This poem,\nhitherto still unpublished, was printed without the author’s name\n(some thought it was Jacobi’s own) and conveyed quite a different\nimage of the gods than was found in the other poem. It suggested that\nthey, no less than mortal men, are subject to the blind\n‘almighty time’ that rules over all.  In a universe thus\nruled by ‘eternal fate’, they are therefore even more\nwretched than human beings, for the latter have at least the power to\nrebel against the order of things and thereby retain their dignity. At\nleast as typified by Prometheus, human beings can rejoice in their own\nsufferings, and by this defiance uphold their individuality in the\nface of Fate. \n\nIn the rest of the letters we see Mendelssohn trying to play down the\nseriousness of Lessing’s alleged admission to being a Spinozist.\nSince Mendelssohn thought at first that Jacobi was himself a\nSpinozist, we see him also attacking the basic doctrines of Spinozism\nas he understood them, while at the same time suggesting how they\ncould be reformulated in an internally more consistent form to have\nthem rejoin the accepted teachings of school metaphysics. Jacobi, for\nhis part, was intent on displaying his scholarly (and indeed more\naccurate) knowledge of Spinoza’s philosophy. In response to\nMendelssohn’s criticisms of Spinoza, he argued that Spinozism\nrepresented, on the contrary, a perfectly self-consistent position. It\nwas school metaphysics that would logically lead to Spinozism, if its\nimplications were just fully understood, not the other way\naround. Jacobi also gave an explanation for his sudden decision to\npublish the letters. Since Mendelssohn had announced the impending\npublication of his\n Morgenstunden,[5]\n a book in which, as Mendelssohn said, he would take up the issue of\nSpinozism, Jacobi thought that his opponent was unfairly trying to\nmake a public head start on him in a controversy that was agreed would\nhave to remain private before being brought to public attention by\nmutual consent. Jacobi then concluded the book with rambling extensive\nquotations from sundry theologians, and ‘sealed’ it (his\nexpression) with an excerpt from Lavater. \n\nMendelssohn was bitterly to complain to Kant that Jacobi’s volume was\nlike a monster that sported Goethe for head, Spinoza as torso, and\nLavater for feet. There was a point to his complaint. Yet, despite the\nmany divagations and the pervading preachy tone of the text, there was\na definite philosophical message that Jacobi was conveying.\nPhilosophers are temperamentally inclined to reconstruct reality\naccording to the requirements of explanation, in total disregard of\nthe requirements of existence. They are possessed, as it were, by a\nlogical fanaticism that leads them to mistake the abstractive\nprinciples of explanation for principles of existence. Since the\nindividuality of things is the first victim of this confusion, yet\nindividuality is the necessary condition of all existence, it follows\nthat in the world as reconstructed by philosophers there is no room\nleft for truly existing subjects — least of all for agents who\ncan seriously take responsibility for their actions and relate to one\nanother as person to person, an ‘I’ to a\n‘Thou’. All that is most noble in human nature (as\ndepicted in Goethe’s first poem, Jacobi implies), notably the ability\nto make decisions and transcend brute nature, is thus denied, and\nthere is no alternative left for human individuals, if they care to\npreserve at least a modicum of dignity, except to take pleasure in\ntheir avowedly only delusory sense of freedom (according to Goethe’s\nsecond poem, as Jacobi also seems to imply). The much vaunted\nEnlightenment humanism, based as it was on the ideal of pure\nrationality was only a sham. It led in fact to ‘nihilism’\n(a term, incidentally, that Jacobi made popular). \n\nAccording to Jacobi’s report of his conversation with Lessing, after a\ndisquisition on his part regarding the devastating effects of a\nthought based on the demands of reason alone, and upon Lessing’s\napparent declaration of sympathy for Spinoza, Jacobi had urged upon\nthe latter to perform a salto mortale (Jacobi, 1785: 17),\ni.e., a kind of jump, heels over head, that would redress his\nposition.  Enlightened philosopher that he was, Lessing had been\nwalking on his head. The jump — which Lessing humorously\ndeclined to execute citing old age as excuse (Jacobi: 1785, 33–34)\n— would have brought him to his feet, back on the solid soil of\ncommon sense. Jacobi’s obvious agenda, in other words, both at the\ntime of this meeting with Lessing and later, in the exchange of views\nwith Mendelssohn, was to attack the rationalism of the\nEnlightenment. Also implied, however, was a criticism of Goethe. The\nlatter had spearheaded the Sturm und Drang reaction against\nthe same rationalism that Jacobi was now condemning. Jacobi’s veiled\nmessage was that the adepts of this new cultural phenomenon had failed\nto escape the rationalism of the philosophers, since the rebellious\nnew humanism they advocated made sense only on the presupposition that\nthe philosophers’ conception of reality was the right one. It is the\ndesire to convey this message that alone explains the otherwise\npuzzling presence in Jacobi’s volume of the two poems by Goethe. To\nJacobi’s contemporaries, who lacked the background knowledge of\nJacobi’s special relationship to Goethe, and were even unaware of\nGoethe’s authorship of the second poem, their inclusion in the volume\nremained a mystery to the end. \n\nAt any rate, whether Jacobi’s agenda was directed at the Enlightenment\nor the Sturm und Drang, the presence of Spinoza both in his\nconversation with Lessing and the later controversy with Mendelssohn\nwas clear. Quite apart from the fact that he had been the central\nobject of discussion in Jacobi’s first encounter with Goethe —\nanother circumstance that Jacobi’s contemporaries could not know\n— Spinoza was now being portrayed by Jacobi as the one\nphilosopher who had had the courage to press the logicism of the\nphilosophers to its ultimate limit, and to draw from it its inevitable\nconclusions. Spinoza had subsumed all reality under the one highest\nabstraction of ‘substance’, with the net result that any\nreal distinction between one presumed individual thing and any other,\nand between all things and God, was being denied. True generation, or\nanything connected with temporality, equally disappeared, except as\nmere illusionary phenomena. This was as nihilistic a conclusion as, in\nJacobi’s opinion, one could possible draw. In his eyes, therefore,\nSpinoza stood as the philosopher par excellence (an\nattribute, however, which he later conferred on Fichte). According to\nthe formula that he drew, philosophy equals Spinozism, and Spinozism\nin turn equals atheism — this last part of the equation being\nbased on the assumption that, since Spinoza’s God, viz. Substance,\nlacked the attributes of a person, it could not satisfy the\nrequirements of true religiosity. \n\nOne can understand, therefore, why Jacobi’s attitude towards Spinoza\ncould have been a source of confusion for Mendelssohn and later\ncritics as well — to the point that Jacobi himself was often\ntaken to be a Spinozist. On the one hand, Jacobi pointed to Spinoza as\nan object lesson of all that is wrong with philosophical reason. On\nthe other hand, he was praising him for being the most consistent of\nall philosophers (Jacobi, 1785: 27–29), and even defended him against\nthose — Mendelssohn included — who, as he thought,\ndetracted from his philosophy by their misguided attempts at\n‘saving’ it from the consequences of its unmitigated\nrationalism. And there was another reason as well for Jacobi’s\notherwise puzzling predilection for Spinoza — the Benedictus, as\nhe once calls him, the ‘Blessed One’.  (Jacobi, 1799: 41)\nSpinoza knew that truth is its own criterion; that ultimately,\ntherefore, it is not amenable to discursive reason but must be\napprehended immediately on its own, intuitively. This was also\nJacobi’s position. His objection against the rationalism of the\nphilosophers boiled down to precisely this — that it was the\nproduct of a reason that had lost touch with its intuitive sources,\nand was therefore given to mistaking its own productions for the real\nthing. On this score, Jacobi thought that he had found a strange ally\nin the most rationalist of all philosophers. \n\nYet there was a serious problem in the Spinoza Letters. Jacobi never\nquite gave to understand what he, as contrasted with Spinoza,\nmeant by ‘intuition’. He says that philosophy must be\n‘historical’ — presumably, that it must take its\nstarting point from the records of human actions and human events;\nthat it must never abandon experience, or common sense. These, though\nvague and hardly the basis for a well defined position, were in\nthemselves perfectly acceptable claims. But Jacobi then obscured them\nwith his pious perorations at the end — by citing, among others,\nthe theologian Jerusalem, who thought that the task of philosophy is\nsimply to elucidate the content of revealed faith, and Lavater, who\nbelieved in the ever present witness of miracles. He could easily give\nthe impression, as he in fact did, that, by attacking philosophy and\nthe philosophers, he was advocating a return to the blind acceptance\nof Biblical revelation; that, by ‘intuition’, he meant\nreligiously inspired ‘faith’. Lessing had suspected that\nmuch at the end of his conversation with Jacobi, according to the\nlatter’s own report. \n\nThe dialogue that Jacobi published in 1787 carried the full title of\nDavid Hume on Faith, or Idealism and Realism, A Dialogue. It\nhad originally been intended as three separate dialogues, as the\nstructure of the final product still betrays. It clearly falls into\nthree parts, with an autobiographical interlude connecting the first\nand second which is the source of much of our knowledge about Jacobi’s\nearly philosophical education. Jacobi uses it as a vehicle for\ndocumenting how much, from the beginning, he had been temperamentally\ndriven always to give priority to existence, as immediately\napprehended, over any conceptual representation of it, and also for\nputting on record that, when still a young man, he had found this\nirresistible tendency of his best satisfied in Kant’s two early\nessays, one on evidence in metaphysics and the other on the proof of\nGod’s existence (Jacobi, 1787: 67ff). These autobiographical remarks\ncome on the heels of a defence, in the first part of the Dialogue,\nagainst the accusation of irrationalism brought against him chiefly\nbecause of his use of the term ‘faith’ (Glaube,\nin German) in the Spinoza Letters. Jacobi’s many polemical divagations\napart, the main line of the defence is very simple. Hume also had used\nthe term ‘belief’ (also translated in German as\nGlaube) for the kind of assent which is based on experience\nand is expressed in the form of judgement. Such an assent is\nimmediate, a matter of feeling rather than ratiocination, and all the\nmore unimpeachable precisely because reason alone would never induce\nit on its own. Now, Jacobi argues, in the Spinoza Letters he had used\nthe term ‘faith’ (also Glaube in German) in the\nsame sense, in order to claim that judgement of existence must be\nimmediate. No process of ratiocination could produce the certainty\nthat accompanies it. There was no ‘irrationalism’,\ntherefore, either intended or implied. On the contrary, Jacobi had\nbeen forced to use the term, and to oppose it to reason, only because\nthe philosophers had pre-empted the latter term, and had unduly\nrestricted it to mean the kind of discursive conceptualization that\nabstracts from real things and is ultimately irrelevant to judgments\nof existence (Jacobi, 1787: 29ff). \n\nDistilled from the many twists and turns of dialogue style\nargumentation, the theory can be summed up as follows: \n\nIn making this last point, Jacobi paraphrases Thomas Reid, without\nhowever mentioning him explicitly in this immediate\n context.[6]\n He apparently thought that he was deploying against Hume the same\nline of argument already advanced against him by his Scottish\n‘common sense’ critic. He was also thereby clarifying what\nhe meant by ‘intuition’ — that supposed immediate\napprehension of truth that gives rise to belief. It now appears that\nthe intuition in question is a product of the ‘senses’. It\nis not, however, anything blind, for — as understood by Jacobi\nin the spirit of Reid, and certainly in contrast to both Hume’s and\nKant’s notion of sensibility — ‘sensations’ are not\npassive impressions of the mind but exhibit rather from the start a\ncomplex relation between subject and object that can then be developed\ninto even more reflective (i.e. representational) forms. Jacobi\nactually says that he is dependent on Spinoza for the seminal idea of\nhis present method of deriving reflective representations from the\nsenses (Jacobi, 1787: 120, note 25). More significant, however, than\nany reference to Hume, Reid, or Spinoza, is that he also refers to\nKant and his transcendental method deliberately, thus betraying that\nhe (Kant), rather than any of them, had been his main concern\nall along (Jacobi, 1787: 119–20, & 120, note 25). Jacobi had been\nadvancing a theory of knowledge that, in his opinion, could compete\nwith Kant’s. For it explained the basic facts of experience, and even\nexplained the factual necessity of certain fundamental concepts\narising in the course of it, without incurring the kind of formalism\nthat, in his opinion and many of Kant’s contemporary critics, affected\nKant’s own transcendental method. Jacobi’s first representations were\nallegedly drawn from experience directly. They were not applied to it\na priori, in the manner of Kant’s categories which Jacobi\nregarded rather as nothing more than ‘prejudices of the\nintellect’. \n\nBut there was a difficulty inherent in Jacobi’s proposed theory. It\ncame out most poignantly in the third part of the Dialogue — a\npart dedicated, for the most part, to an exposition of Leibniz’s\nmetaphysics (Jacobi, 1787: 144ff). Here Jacobi portrays the German\nLeibniz as the champion of individuality, and also tries to show how\nit is possible to accept his Monadology if duly modified. The\ntransition in the Dialogue between second and third part is performed\nrhetorically. There was, however, a conceptual basis for it. And it\nwas in this, in the obvious logical connection between Jacobi’s just\nsuggested theory of experience and Leibniz’s Monadology, that the\ndifficulty lay. For the organic conception of rationality that that\ntheory implied — reason being nothing more than a more\ndeveloped, more reflective, form of sensibility — fitted well\nindeed with Leibniz’s system. But it also clearly led to Leibnizian\nnaturalism. And the idea that the ‘self’ cannot be defined\nexcept in terms of an ‘other’, while also well fitted to\nthe Monadology, also led to the equally Leibnizian position that\neverything in the universe is itself by reflecting everything\nelse. Jacobi had however made his philosophical debut precisely by\ncombating the assumption that everything can be explained by reference\nto everything else — a position that he thought reflected the\nphilosophers’ logical enthusiasm for explanation and which he opposed\nbecause it ended up undermining human subjectivity. \n\nThe much augmented second edition of Jacobi’s first major work\nincluded a fuller documentation of the correspondence with\nMendelssohn, and eight new supplements in which, among other things,\nJacobi offered a more detailed exposition of Spinoza’s philosophy\n(Supplements VI, VII) and a lengthy criticism of Herder’s version of\nSpinozism (Supplement IV). It was also prefaced with fifty-two\npropositions — twenty-three purporting to defend the thesis\n‘Man does not have Freedom’; the remaining twenty-nine,\nthe opposite thesis ‘Man has Freedom’. The argument in\ndefence of the first thesis is based on the assumption that human\naffairs are organized mechanistically, i.e. according to a\nconcatenation of purely efficient causes that would make the being of\neach totally dependent on the external being of everything else. In\ndefending the thesis Jacobi follows Spinoza closely. The mechanism at\nissue applies to the cognitive side of man just as much as to his\nbodily side.  Consciousness, or representational being, is only a\nmirror of extended being. Whatever happens in the latter is repeated\non the side of thought, though according to thought’s own modality of\nexistence. Thus, according to Jacobi, syllogistic thinking is\nmechanistic in nature, being driven by principles ab ante no\nless than any corporeal sequence of events. So far as the opposing\nthesis is concerned, Jacobi argues for it by retrieving a theme from\nthe David Hume. If it is the case that a finite\n‘I’ acquires identity only when confronted by an equally\nfinite ‘Thou’, then, just as for the required interplay\nbetween the two one must assume on each side a source of\n‘passivity’ that allows each to be limited by the other,\nso one must also equally assume in them a countervailing source of\n‘activity’. This source is irreducible. It follows that\n‘activity’ and ‘passivity’ must be assumed to\nrun across the world we know in every part of it. In some parts, the\none element might well display a greater degree of intensity than the\nother; nowhere, however, can either element crowd out the other\ntotally. It also follows that, though mechanism is both possible and\nnecessary, a totally mechanistic organization of things that would\neo ipso allow no room for individual freedom, i.e. one that\nwould reduce all things to external relations, is an impossibility,\nfor it would in fact reduce things to mere nothingness (Jacobi, 1789:\nxxxv-xxxvi). It would make them totally passive.\n‘Passivity’, however, has no meaning except in relation to\n‘activity’. The conceptual basis for denying the reality\nof individually attributable human act is thus removed. \n\nThe two theses, appearing as they did one year after the publication\nof Kant’s Critique of Practical Reason, may be taken as a\ntacit criticism of Kant’s strategy of defining the problem of freedom\nin the form of an antinomy. Jacobi’s two theses do not constitute an\nantinomy because, from their perspective, any apparent opposition\nbetween mechanistic explanation and moral demands is already resolved\nin the propositions detailing the second thesis. Presupposed by both\nsets of propositions is the assumption, which Jacobi accepts, that\nbeings (at least, created beings) exist in limiting relationships, and\nthat such relationships entail an irreducible element of passivity as\nwell as activity on both the sides entering into them. The difference\nbetween the two sets of propositions is that the second (the one\ndefending freedom) respects this necessary condition of any\nrelationship, whereas the first does not. Only the philosopher,\nbecause of his passion for abstractions, is tempted to conceive, on\nthe one hand, a purely mechanistic relation, one which in fact negates\nactivity altogether and thus removes the basis for the desired\nrelationships; on the other hand, one which is purely active,\nexclusively spontaneous, and thus attains the same result by the\nopposite route. For this last point, Jacobi could have easily\nconnected Kant’s notion of freedom as purely spontaneous activity with\nSpinoza’s causa sui. Only then, when one has thus given way\nto the philosopher’s passion for abstractions, is one faced with the\nKantian kind of antinomy — a conflict of opposing yet\nconceptually valid views that can be controlled, though never truly\nresolved, only by appeal to the unknown. \n\nIn other words, the choice with which Jacobi confronted his readers at\nthe opening of his new edition of the Spinoza Letters was not between\ntwo conceptually valid yet contradictory claims, but between the\nanti-humanism of the philosophers — based at it was on an\nabstraction — and a humanism that on the contrary stays close to\nthe facts of experience. In this respect, Jacobi was reaffirming the\npoint he had already made to Lessing ten years earlier, namely, that\nthe only way to deal with the irrational results of philosophizing is\nto know when to stop philosophizing. Ironically, however, he had used\nthe same general paradigm of two interacting forces to define, in his\ntwo sets of propositions, both the system of mechanical causes and the\nsystem of freedom. This was a point that did not get lost. Fichte was\nsoon to use the paradigm as his basis for resolving Kant’s antinomy,\nby arguing that freedom requires as its counterpart the kind of\nmechanistic organization that scientific explanation demands. Where\nJacobi had tried to circumvent the antinomy altogether by suspending\nphilosophical reflection at the right moment, Fichte was to try to\nresolve it by prompting that same reflection to a higher level of\nabstraction instead. So far as Jacobi was concerned, the results of\nany such move could only be disastrous. And it was indeed against\nFichte that, ten years later, he felt compelled to repeat in stronger\nterms than ever before his original interdiction against\nphilosophers. \n\nIn his Open Letter, Jacobi famously declared Fichte as the true\ndisciple of Kant — the one who had brought the premises of\nTranscendental Idealism to their logical conclusions. He also revised\nhis prior estimate of Spinoza. He had always portrayed the latter as\nthe most consistent of all philosophers. He now recognized that the\nattribute belonged in truth to Fichte. He was in fact the\nphilosopher par excellance — the Messias of Reason, as\nJacobi now loudly proclaims him (Jacobi, 1799: 2). For Fichte had\nextended the reach of philosophical abstraction, with which Spinoza\nhad gone only so far as to exclude the possibility of subjectivity, to\nretrieve this subjectivity itself within its compass, as if it could\nbe excogitated a priori out of pure thought. Fichte’s\nidealism was a case of inverted Spinozism, of spiritual materialism\n(Jacobi, 1799: 2–5). For Spinoza’s substance, which explains all\nthings by explaining none of them in particular, hence relegates the\ndetermination of individuals to the endless mechanism of external\ncauses, was now being reintroduced as the product of pure reflection,\nas its first objectification. It was as if reflection dissolved all\nthings in the ether of pure thought, out of sheer freedom, and then\nreassembled them again — but now as a game, according to\nself-concocted rules (Jacobi, 1799: 24–27). \n\nAll this infuriated Jacobi. No piece of his is as overflowing with\nreligious language as this letter to Fichte. But the rhetoric\nexhibited here has none of the pious triumphalism, smacking of\nLavater, that had vitiated his earlier productions. It seems born,\nrather, out of genuine fear in the face of what he thought was the\nultimate nihilism of reason. Jacobi conceded that there was no\nargument against Fichte, no way of refuting him on his own conceptual\ngrounds. He stood before him, therefore, as one who gave witness\nagainst the philosophers, forcing the audience to a choice between him\nand them. Against the universal norms of either Kant’s or Fichte’s\nmorality, he stood rather as the champion of the exception — the\none who, for the sake of the individual, would dare profane the sacred\naltars, indeed to lie and even murder (Jacobi, 1799: 32–33). This was\na powerful individualistic manifesto that Jacobi was promoting, the\nkind not be heard again until Kierkegaard more than half a century\nlater. But it had nothing to do with the asocial individualism typical\nof the Sturm und Drang movement that had been the cause of\nJacobi’s concern in his younger years. On the contrary, even before\nthis commotion with Fichte, and probably with Goethe in mind, Jacobi\nhad long been meditating on the place of the individual in society,\nand had formulated for himself a definite social theory. To gather an\nidea of it, however, we must turn to his more literary works, as we\nshall do in due place (see Section 3). \n\nThe final period of Jacobi’s life saw, among other things, two major\npublications and the undertaking of the editions of his collected\nwork.  We shall consider this last at the end, in the section\n‘Retrospect’ (Section 5). As for the other two pieces, the\nfirst was a renewed and ever sharper attack on Kant’s Transcendental\nIdealism, as the title indicated: ‘On Critique’s Attempt to\nReduce Reason to the Understanding’. It was completed by\nJacobi’s disciple Köppen, as clearly indicated in the text\nitself; and published in 1802. Reduced to its bare minimum, the attack\nwas based on three arguments, as follows: \n\n(1) Kant had tried to establish the possibility of synthetic a\npriori judgements on the assumption of an object (= x) and of\nsubject (= x) that we ex hypothesi cannot ever know but upon\nwhich the system of experience based on the said judgements none the\nless depends. The two (viz., the subject and object) constitute\ntranscendental conditions of the possibility of the system of\nexperience. Kant’s attempt, however, entails an irresoluble\ndifficulty.  For although the assumed subject and object are factors\nthat ex hypothesi fall outside the system of the\na priori judgements to be validated (i.e., they are\n‘transcendental’), they can only be defined in terms of\nthe concepts and distinctions that have meaning exclusively\ninside that system. Kant thus finds himself in the\nembarrassing situation of negating, while at the same time affirming,\nthe transcendality of the conditions of his system, thereby\nundermining the stability that the latter should derive from\nthem (Jacobi, 1812–25: vol. 2, 85–91). \n\n(2) The same objection can be generalized in terms of the relation\nthat obtains in Kant’s Critique between ‘reason’ and\n‘understanding’. It is the task of reason, according to\nKant, to define the extra-systemic conditions that make the system of\nexperience possible. But, ex hypothesi, reason has no\nknowledge of these conditions. As defined by it, they are empty\nconceptual constructs that acquire meaning only to the extent that\nthey are used by the understanding in its endless work of\nsystematizing experience. To this extent, reason is totally\nsubordinated to the understanding. Yet the latter needs\nreason. To the extent, therefore, that reason does satisfy this need\nwith its ideas, it cannot help creating the illusion that, through\nthem, it yields genuine knowledge — that, logically, its\nconceptions are prior to those of the understanding. Now, Jacobi\nobjected to what he took to be the existentially impossible\nrequirement thus being imposed on reason, namely, that it should\ngenerate illusions for the sake of the understanding, yet be fully\naware that such illusions are just that (Jacobi, 1812–25:\nvol. 2, 81, 100–01, 115). \n\n(3) The third objection, though repeated in a variety of ways,\nconsists essentially in a criticism of Kant’s analysis of the function\nof the understanding in experience. Even granted all the elements of\nKant’s transcendental psychology, notably, that sensations are per\nse amorphous mental impressions, that space and time can be at\nonce intuitions and objects of intuition, that the categories are\na priori concepts of the understanding — assumptions\nthese, all of which Jacobi in fact rejects, and against which he\nstrenuously argues in the body of the essay — even granted\nthese, there still is an internal defect in Kant’s system. The problem\nis that the two terms to be synthesized in any presumed a\npriori judgement of experience, namely, thought and sensations,\nare on their own too indeterminate to provide any clue as to how the\nobject that should result from the synthesis would look like. So far\nas sensibility is concerned, such indetermination applies whether we\ntake it according to its material content or its a priori\nforms of intuition, for ‘space’ and ‘time’, as\ndefined by Kant, lack per se definite limits (Jacobi,\n1812–25: vol. 2, 77–79, 122ff, 134–35, 136–39).\nIt follows that the determination, in actual experience, must be\nprovided by the intervention of the imagination, and whether we take\nthe latter in a psychological or transcendental sense, its\ncontribution will necessarily entail an element of arbitrariness, and\nit will thus render any synthesis thereby attained vulnerable to\nsceptical doubt. Kant, in other words, fails to deliver on his promise\nof a knowledge, limited indeed to experience, but necessary within\nsuch limits (Jacobi, 1812–25: vol. 2, 95, 97, 115ff, 118ff,\n135, 150, 154ff). \n\nThe other major work of Jacobi in this last period, Of Divine\nThings and Their Revelation, was published in 1811. Jacobi had\nactually begun writing the piece ten years earlier, as the review of a\nrecently published volume by a pietist writer, but had later picked it\nup again and completed in a totally different cast as a critique of\nSchelling’s ‘System of Identity’ and of the new Philosophy\nof Nature connected with it. Evidence of its earlier purpose is still\nvisible in the final text, beginning as it does with the discussion of\na moral issue, namely, whether morality is to be based on virtue\nalone, or on natural happiness, or a combination of both. But then the\ntext suddenly shifts to a long discussion of Kant’s critical\nphilosophy, the burden of which is however to demonstrate that\nSchelling’s recent idealistic productions were but the logical\nconsequences of precisely that philosophy. The treatment of Kant in\nthis context is a strangely qualified one. On the one hand, Jacobi\npraises him highly, showing him all the respect due to someone who had\nbecome an icon of German philosophical culture. He praises him because\nhe had unequivocally recognized that a true God (presumably, such as\nmorality demands) must be a person; also because he acknowledged that\nwe have an immediate belief in God, freedom, and immortality, and\n‘belief’ for Jacobi of course meant\n‘knowledge’; finally, because, just like Jacobi himself,\nhe had tried to respect and harmonize the interests of reason, which\nare directed to God, and those of the understanding, which are\ndirected to the senses (Jacobi, 1812–25: vol.  3, 341–44;\n351–52). Such praises, however, turn out to be hollow —\neven a masked form of condemnation. For Jacobi’s main thesis\nthroughout the otherwise rambling work is that Kant, while upholding\npersonalistic values, had in fact subverted them conceptually, the net\nproduct being Fichte’s system of ideal materialism and now the openly\nnaturalistic system of Schelling. \n\nThe kernel of Jacobi’s argument was in fact still the same as the one\npresented in his earlier Kant essay (1802). The point there was that\nKantian reason, though transcending the understanding, was none the\nless restricted in its knowledge to the limits of the latter and even\nsubservient to it in the exercise of its powers. As a result, reason\nfound itself in the strange situation of spontaneously generating\nbelief that we have knowledge of transcendent realities, while at the\nsame time having to recognize that any such knowledge is\nillusionary. Jacobi now further develops this point by arguing that\nKant’s critical system was explicitly intended from the start to serve\nthe interests of science — where by ‘science’ Kant\nmeant first and foremost a cognition of the understanding directed at\nthe objects of the senses. The understanding, however, despite its\nearth-bound nature, cannot help falling under the influence of the\nhigher faculty of reason. It is caught up in reason’s desire to behold\nall things under a transcendent single principle. And reason —\nas a matter of fact, according to Jacobi — does have an\nintuitive knowledge of things transcendent. But since the\nunderstanding cannot allow this knowledge, yet still needs reason as a\nhigher regulative principle, it substitutes for reason’s knowledge\nideal constructs that are indeed also the products of reason, but are\nmade up, however, of abstractions derived from the\nunderstanding. These abstractions then hide from the understanding and\nreason itself the transcendent knowledge that the latter enjoys de\nfacto. For since reason naturally begins with the assumption of\nsuch a knowledge, yet cannot recognize it in the abstractions\nconstrued for the sake of the understanding, it ends up treating it as\nmere illusion (Jacobi, 1812–25: vol. 3, 372–94). \n\nFichte’s next obvious step was to remove the ground of the illusion by\ndeclaring the ideal constructs of reason to be themselves the objects\nof the transcendent knowledge that reason desires — in effect,\nof identifying God with the logical order of things. And Fichte,\naccording to Jacobi, quite consistently also took as the test of true\npersonality the capacity on the part of a self to reconstruct the\nwhole of nature a priori from the principles of that logic,\nthus reenacting ideally God’s creative deed. In fact, however, such a\nlogic was from the start the product of understanding’s\nabstractions. It has no content of its own. The idealizing activities\nof a self cannot in fact be realized, therefore, except by attending\nto the material details of nature. And since, even when idealized,\nnature still remains ‘nature’, it follows according to\nJacobi that in practice Fichte’s idealism is but a form of\nmaterialism. Schelling’s naturalism only made this fact explicit. In\nsum, the great hoax that according to Jacobi idealism had perpetrated\n— starting with Kant and concluding with Schelling — was\nto give to believe, not indeed that the human spirit can dispense with\nThings Divine, but that these things can be saved and attained in the\nimpersonal medium of nature.  Important to note is the new terminology that Jacobi was using in\nthis last work, and had already begun to use in the previous essay on\nKant. He was now operating on the assumption that there is a\ndistinction between ‘reason’ and\n‘understanding’ — where by ‘reason’ he\nmeant the capacity for transcendent, unifying, principles; by\n‘understanding’, the faculty of abstracting general\nrepresentations from more particular ones (Jacobi, 1812–25:\nvol. 3, 395ff, 400, 434–35). The distinction was, of course,\nKantian in origin.  The claim, moreover, that Kant had held\n‘reason’ hostage to the abstractive requirements of the\n‘understanding’ was one widely debated among his\nidealistic followers. Jacobi, however, was now using\n‘reason’ to mean a faculty of intuitive knowledge of\ntranscendent things. He was giving to it a positive noetic value. As\nused by him, therefore, the distinction between ‘reason’\nand ‘understanding’ allowed him to draw what he thought\nwas the crucial difference between himself and Kant (Jacobi,\n1812–25: vol.  3, 369–72). Whereas Kant had tried to\nharmonize the two faculties negatively, simply by keeping each within\nits appointed limits, Jacobi had revealed their harmony positively, by\nbringing to light the knowledge that reason actually contributes to\nexperience, thus providing the positive matrix within which the\nunderstanding can operate. \n\nIn another way as well the distinction helped Jacobi — or so he\nthought it did. From the beginning Jacobi had been faced by the\ndifficulty that, in order to oppose philosophical reflection and the\nnihilism that it brought in train, he had had to attack\n‘reason’ and to summon ‘faith’ in its\nstead. He had thereby made himself vulnerable to the charge of\n‘irrationalism’ and ‘blind fideism’, a charge\nthat he always strenuously rejected. So far as Jacobi was concerned,\nthe true irrationalists were the philosophers. With the newly adopted\ndistinction, Jacobi could now specifically direct to the\n‘understanding’, or more accurately, to a ‘reason\nbound to the understanding’, the kind of criticism earlier\ndirected quite generally to ‘reason’. He could then summon\n‘reason’, with the new meaning attributed to it, to do the\njob previously performed by ‘faith’. In this way, he could\nmore easily dodge the charge of ‘irrationalism’ or\n‘fideism’, for it was for the sake of ‘reason’\n— that is, ‘true reason’ — that he could now\nclaim he was waging his campaign against the philosophers. The\nproblem, of course, was that Jacobi never quite clarified this new\nmeaning of ‘reason’. He was apparently using the concept\nin the same way as he had previously used ‘faith’, namely,\nas denoting an intuitive faculty akin to feeling but at the same time\nsporting the clarity of a concept. And this was a combination of notes\njust as obscure when it went under the name of ‘faith’ as\nit did when called ‘reason’. Whether the new distinction,\nand the new language that it made possible, in fact ever clarified\nJacobi’s position is a question, therefore, open to debate. \n\nJacobi’s earliest publications, some done in collaboration with his\nbrother Georg, were of a purely literary nature. And Jacobi continued\nto publish the occasional piece in this vein also later, when\nengrossed in philosophical debate. His reputation as a literary figure\nis mostly based, however, on his two novels, Edward Allwill’s\nCollection of Letters, and Woldemar. Both productions\nunderwent a long process of development, and were published in\ndifferent forms at different times (David, 1913; Jacobi, 1957). \n\nAs literary texts, the two pieces belong to the popular Enlightenment\ngenre of Erziehungsroman, ‘education-novel’. In\nboth cases the education at issue, as one would expect from the genre,\nis that of a Herzensmensch. From what we learn about Allwill,\nsince early age, out of sheer natural impetuosity, he was given to\nsome most extraordinary behaviour. Allwill (whose name in German, as\nin English, means just that, ‘all will’) did\nwhatever he did out of sheer impulse — his only norm of action,\nthe action itself. And later, as a grown-up man, now that he has grown\nolder, he displays this character trait in the arena of speculative\ndispute as well. For the impetuous young man has also become a skilled\ndialectician, as we learn from a scene in which we see him deliver a\nlong disquisition on the nature of knowledge in the course of a social\ngathering (Jacobi, 1792: 143ff). \n\nTrue rationality is social rationality. This is Jacobi’s lesson in\nAllwill, and it is repeated in the Woldemar —\nthough the central character there, Woldemar, while exhibiting the\nsame propensity to abstract feeling and abstract thought as Allwill,\nis treated by Jacobi with much warmth. The character might well have\nbeen intended by him as a self-portrait. The novel itself, in its\nfinal form, was put together from two pieces originally published\nindependently (Jacobi, 1779 (3) (4)). The synthesis never quite\nworked. Woldemar, unrealistic man of feelings\nthat he is, has construed his whole world around the friendship he has\ndeveloped with one of the women in the circle of friends he\nfrequents. He has invested his whole existence in that friendship. \n\nAs it shows from the development of the friendship between the two\nmain characters, Jacobi was actually harking back to the notion of\nreason he had adumbrated even as early as the first edition of the\nSpinoza Letters. Rationality is constituted in the relationship\nbetween an ‘I’ and a ‘Thou’, a relationship\nthat respects the conditions of both its terms. Within the context of\nthe\nWoldemar, this conclusion also brings resolution to a\nquestion discussed in a dialogue (the Waldgespräch)\nintroduced in the first part of the narration — the question,\nnamely, of the extent to which virtue depends on either nature or\nart. The answer is that it depends on both, provided that each is\ntested by the limits of actual human relations. At the conclusion of\nthe novel, just as in the earlier dialogue, it is also clearly implied\nthat the mutual respect that such relations demand from the\nindividuals entering into them is possible only on the assumption of a\n‘Thou’ greater than any human ‘I’ — a\n‘Thou’ whose transcendent pull forces the human\n‘I’ outside its otherwise purely natural\nlimitations.[7]\nJacobi’s last word, in his novels just as much as in his philosophical\nproductions, always belongs to God. \n\nAll of Jacobi’s publications are polemical in nature. Some, however,\nwere occasional pieces written with a particular event or situation in\nmind. Abstraction made of the perversely polemical tracts surrounding\nthe Spinoza dispute and the controversy with Schelling (Jacobi, 1916,\n1967), all of them are historically as well as conceptually\ninteresting. Among them, we can single out a few. \n\nIn 1777, Jacobi’s friend and literary collaborator C.M. Wieland\n(1733–1813) had published an essay arguing that power is the only\nsource of legitimacy for political authority, hence that the only\nadequate form of government is a strictly autocratic\n one.[8]\n Right follows upon the physical ability to enforce obedience. Jacobi\nreplied with a point-by-point rebuttal that was published only four\nyears later (Jacobi, 1781). For one thing, Wieland was historically\nwrong by misconstruing the actual origin of societies. Even more\nimportant, Wieland was conceptually wrong by not recognizing that\n‘moral law’ and ‘natural necessity’ can be\nsubsumed under the one concept of ‘natural right’ only in\na very broad sense. Moral rights derive their force from the freedom\nof individuals, not from any consideration of natural laws. \n\nJacobi renewed his political polemic in 1782, this time on the\noccasion of the publication by the historian Johann von Müller of\na pamphlet entitled The Travels of the\n Popes,[9]\n in which, contrary to current ‘enlightened’ views, a\npositive revaluation of the role of the Popes in the Middles Ages was\noffered.  Jacobi responded with a pamphlet of his own (Jacobi,\n 1782)[10]\nin which he defended Müller’s position — not because he had\nany sympathy for Catholicism, or because he was opposed to secularism,\nbut because he thought that the Popes’ spiritual despotism was much\nto be preferred to the secular, allegedly enlightened, despotism of\nthe princes. \n\nIn 1788, Jacobi published a piece in dialogue form in the\nDeutsches Museum (Jacobi, 1788). He did it in the midst of\nthe notorious Starck affair, and in response to the campaign being\nwaged at the time by the Berlin Aufklärer against the\npious religiosity of people like Lavater — a religiosity which\nthey took as a form of crypto-Catholicism, and as an attack on the\nuniversal religion of reason which they promoted (Blum, 1912). The\ndialogue is between a pious believer and an enlightened\nphilosopher. The believer’s main point is that the philosopher has the\nright indeed to criticize faith. But the believer has just as much\nright not to accept the philosopher’s portrayal of his faith. The\nphilosopher, moreover, forgets that his philosophy has a history as\nwell; that its past is shrouded in a faith on which it still depends\nfor the meaning of its abstract conceptions. By attacking faith,\ntherefore, the philosopher risks undermining his own world of\n meaning.[11] \n\nIn 1802, Jacobi published a short piece (Jacobi, 1802 (2)) in response\nto a prophesy made by G. C. Lichtenberg, a well known science\npopularizer of the\n day,[12]\n to the effect that some day, as science progresses in its efforts at\nreducing matter to the laws governing it, our world will become so\nrefined in our eyes that it will be just as laughable to believe in\nGod as it now is to believe in ghosts. Jacobi replied with a prophesy of\nhis own, imitating the Gospels’ account of the last days. Jacobi\nreproduced the piece at the opening of his Of Divine Things and\ntheir Revelation in 1811, in obvious parody of Schelling’s\nphilosophy of nature. \n\nThe first volume of Jacobi’s collected works was published in 1812;\nthe second, in 1815. This last is especially important because it\ncontains, added to the text of the David Hume, a long new\nPreface intended by Jacobi, as the title indicates, also as\nIntroduction to his life long philosophical production (‘Preface\nand also Introduction to the Author’s Philosophical Collected\nWorks’, Jacobi, 1812–25, vol. 2). In the piece, Jacobi\ntried to sum up his intellectual odyssey by articulating the interest\nthat had motivated it from beginning to end, and thereby also to bring\nsome systematic unity to what might otherwise have appeared a\nscattered philosophical production. Jacobi was obviously sensitive to\nthe charge of irrationalism that had repeatedly been brought against\nhim over the years, and anxious to disarm it. He appealed to the\ndistinction between ‘reason’ and\n‘understanding’ that he had adopted from around 1800 to\nargue, as he had already done in Of Divine Things, that the\nkind of knowledge he had earlier presented under the rubric of\n‘faith’ should be understood rather as a product of\n‘reason’ — a ‘reason’ properly\nunderstood, of course, as an intuitive faculty for the immediate\napprehension of such eternal verities as the Good, the True, and the\nBeautiful (Jacobi, 1812–1825, vol. 2, 1815: 59–63 and\npassim). He accordingly edited the 1787 text of the David\nHume, attributing what he thought was the inconclusiveness of the\ndialogue to his yet unclarified concept of ‘reason’ at the\ntime of the first edition. He added long footnotes to it, and even\nmodified some crucial passages of the text itself — a\ncircumstance, incidentally, for the most part ignored by later\ncommentators — in an obvious effort to dispel the naturalism\notherwise clearly implied in the original text.[13] While thus\ndistancing himself from any possible evidence of naturalism, Jacobi\nhowever also tried to deflect the accusation, sometimes brought\nagainst him even by \nfriends,[14] \nthat he was against science. He tried to\ncompensate for his past repeatedly made remark that science is but a\ngame of abstractions (Jacobi, 1799: 22–27) by reasserting now,\nas he had already done in Of Divine Things, that, without the\nunderstanding’s power to synthesize in the medium of abstract\nrepresentations the content of sensations, reason, just like the\nsenses, would have no form and hence no cognition of itself (Jacobi,\n1812–25: vol. 2, 58, 110). Jacobi also stressed that, however\nnecessary the functions of the understanding, the latter is none the\nless still naturally prone to naturalism and to the atheism consequent\nupon it. \n\nA measure of the great influence that Jacobi had in his own lifetime,\nand continued to have in the rest of the nineteenth century, is that\nhe was the first to put in circulation the term\n‘nihilism’, and to inaugurate the discourse associated with\nit. \n\nBecause of Jacobi’s insistence on the primacy of immediate existence\nover reflective conceptualization, and of the rights of the\n‘exception’, the possibility is there to interpret his\nposition as case of proto-existentialism, and to treat him, just as\nKierkegaard, as an essentially religious thinker (Beiser, 1987).\nIndeed, some of the language Jacobi uses, and the themes he explores,\nare to be found in Kierkegaard again. (Whether the latter was himself\nan existentialist is, of course, itself an open question.) One must\nhowever keep in mind that the language of the ‘leap of\nfaith’ does not belong to Jacobi. The salto mortale he\nhad proposed to Lessing was no leap into the unknown but, according to\nhis explicit testimony, a jump that would have brought Lessing, who\nhad been walking on his head in the manner of philosophers, back to\nhis feet (Jacobi, 1787: 62; 1789: 353). \n\nIn sum, Jacobi’s figure, including its place within the Enlightenment,\nis much more complex than usually assumed, and still in need of\ndiscussion. In our own times, Leo Strauss did his PhD on\nJacobi. Perhaps this is still another way in which Jacobi is working\nhis influence on us and still bringing Spinoza centre stage, exactly\nwhere he did not want him to be. It might well be that the secret of\nthis complexity is that Jacobi, just like Kierkegaard after him, was\nmotivated by deeply conservative beliefs which he saw threatened by\nthe culture of the day; but, again like Kierkegaard, in trying to\nreassert them, developed a language that was later to be used,\ncontrary to anything he would have ever imagined, to undermine them\ninstead.","contact.mail":"paolo.livieri@mail.mcgill.ca","contact.domain":"mail.mcgill.ca"}]
