But, in more recent times, the\npornography debate has taken on a somewhat new and surprising\nshape. Some feminists have found themselves allied with their\ntraditional conservative foes in calling on the state to regulate or\nprohibit pornography-although the primary focus of feminist concern is\non the harm that pornography may cause to women (and children), rather\nthan the obscenity of its sexually explicit content. And some liberals\nhave joined pro-censorship feminists in suggesting that the harms that\nviolent and degrading pornography causes to women's social standing\nand opportunities might be sufficiently serious to justify prohibiting\nsuch pornography on liberal grounds. Many others, both liberals and\nfeminists, remain unconvinced. They are doubtful that pornography is a\nsignificant cause of the oppression of women or that the “blunt and\ntreacherous” instrument of the law is the best solution to such harm\nas pornography may cause. As we shall see, the debate over whether\npornography should be censored remains very much alive.\n\n\n\n“I can't define pornography,” one judge once famously said, “but I\nknow it when I see it.” (Justice Stewart in Jacobellis v. Ohio\n378 US 184 (1964).) Can we do better? \n\nThe word “pornography” comes from the Greek for writing about\nprostitutes. However, the etymology of the term is not much of a guide\nto its current usage, since many of the things commonly called\n“pornography” nowadays are neither literally written nor literally\nabout prostitutes. \n\nHere is a first, simple definition. Pornography is any material\n(either pictures or words) that is sexually explicit. This\ndefinition of pornography may pick out different types of material in\ndifferent contexts, since what is viewed as sexually explicit can vary\nfrom culture to culture and over time. “Sexually explicit” functions as\na kind of indexical term, picking out different features depending on\nwhat has certain effects or breaks certain taboos in different contexts\nand cultures. Displays of women's uncovered ankles count as sexually\nexplicit in some cultures, but not in most western cultures nowadays\n(although they once did: the display of a female ankle in Victorian\ntimes was regarded as most risqué). There may be borderline\ncases too: do displays of bared breasts still count as sexually\nexplicit in various contemporary western cultures? However, some\nmaterial seems clearly to count as sexually explicit in many contexts\ntoday: in particular, audio, written or visual representations of\nsexual acts (e.g., sexual intercourse, oral sex) and exposed body parts\n(e.g., the vagina, anus and penis-especially the erect penis). \n\nWithin the general class of sexually explicit material, there is\ngreat variety in content. For example, some sexually explicit material\ndepicts women, and sometimes men, in postures of sexual display (e.g.,\nPlayboy centrefolds). Some depicts non-violent sexual acts (both\nhomosexual and heterosexual) between adults who are portrayed as equal\nand consenting participants. Other sexually explicit representations\ndepict acts of violent coercion: people being whipped, beaten, bound,\ntortured, mutilated, raped and even killed. Some\nsexually explicit material may be degrading, without necessarily being\novertly violent. This material depicts people (most often women) in\npositions of servility and subordination in their sexual relations with\nothers, or engaged in sexual acts that many people would regard as\nhumiliating. Some sexually explicit material involves or depicts\nchildren. Some portrays bestiality and necrophilia; and so on. \n\nOn the first definition of pornography as sexually explicit\nmaterial, all such material would count as pornography, insofar as it\nis sexually explicit. But this simple definition is not quite right.\nAnatomy textbooks for medical students are sexually explicit-they\ndepict exposed genitalia, for example-but are rarely, if ever, viewed\nas pornography. Sexual explicitness may be a necessary condition for\nmaterial to count as pornographic, but it does not seem to be\nsufficient. So something needs to be added to the simple definition.\nWhat else might be required? \n\nHere is a second definition. Pornography is sexually explicit\nmaterial (verbal or pictorial) that is primarily designed\nto produce sexual arousal in viewers. This definition is better:\nit deals with the problem of anatomy textbooks and the like. Indeed,\nthis definition is one that is frequently employed (or presupposed) in\ndiscussions of pornography and censorship. (See e.g., Williams 1981.)\nOf course, it is important to distinguish here between sexually\nexplicit material that is wholly or primarily\ndesigned to produce sexual arousal (i.e., whose only or overriding aim\nis to produce sexual arousal) and material whose aim is to do this in\norder to make some other artistic or political point. The film,\nLast Tango in Paris arguably aims to arouse audiences, but\nthis is not its primary aim. It does so in order to make a broader\npolitical point. \n\nIt is sometimes assumed that pornography, in this second sense, is\npublished and consumed by a small and marginalized minority. But, while\nexact estimates of the size and profitability of the international\ntrade in pornography vary somewhat, it is generally agreed that the\npornography industry is a massive international enterprise, with a\nmulti-billion dollar annual turnover. In 2003, the pornography industry\n(taken to include adult videos, magazines, Cable/Pay per view, Internet\nand CD-Rom) is estimated to have grossed US$34 billion world-wide; and\nin excess of $8 billion in the U.S. alone, greater than the combined\nrevenue of ABC, CBS, and NBC ($6.2. billion). (See “Internet Filter\nReview: Internet Pornography Statistics” in\n Other Internet Resources.)\n Pornography is much more widely consumed than\nis sometimes supposed, and is a large and extremely profitable\ninternational industry. \n\nHowever, the term “pornography” is often used with an additional\nnormative force that the first and second definitions leave\nout. When many people describe something (e.g., a book such as\nTropic of Capricorn or a film such as Baise Moi)as\n“pornographic”, they seem to be doing more than simply dispassionately\ndescribing its sexually explicit content or the intentions of its\nproducers-indeed, in these debates, the intentions of producers are\nsometimes treated as irrelevant to the work's status as pornography.\nThey seem to be saying, in addition, that it is bad-and\nperhaps also that its badness is not redeemed by other artistic,\nliterary, or political merit the work may possess. (Consider, for\nexample, how people use the term “visual pornography” to condemn\ncertain sorts of art or television, often when the material is not even\nsexually explicit). \n\nThis suggests a third definition: pornography is sexually explicit\nmaterial designed to produce sexual arousal in consumers that is\nbad in a certain way. This definition of pornography makes it\nanalytically true that pornography is bad: by definition, material that\nis not bad in the relevant way is not pornography. It might be that\nall and only sexually explicit material is bad in a certain\nway (e.g., obscene): in which case, “pornography” will refer to all and\nonly the class of sexually explicit materials. But it might be that\nonly some sexually explicit material is objectionable (e.g.,\ndegrading to women), in which case only the bad subset of\nsexually explicit material will count as pornography. And, of course,\nit is possible that no sexually explicit material is bad in\nthe relevant way (e.g., harmful to women), in which case we would have\nan error theory about pornography: there would be no pornography, so\ndefined, merely harmless, sexually explicit “erotica”. \n\nA number of approaches define pornography as sexually explicit\nmaterial that is bad—although they disagree as to the relevant source of its badness, and consequently about what material is pornographic. A particularly\ndominant approach has been to define pornography in terms of\nobscenity. (For critical discussions of this approach see\nSchauer 1982, Feinberg 1987, MacKinnon 1987.) The obscenity might be\ntaken to be intrinsic to the content of the material itself (for\nexample, that it depicts deviant sexual acts that are immoral in\nthemselves) or it may lie in contingent effects that the material has\n(for example, that it tends to offend “reasonable” people, or to\ndeprave and corrupt viewers, or to erode traditional family and\nreligious values). If all sexually explicit material is obscene by\nwhichever of these standards is chosen, then all sexually explicit\nmaterial will be pornography on this definition. This is the definition\nof pornography that moral conservatives typically favour. \n\nBut the badness of pornography need not reside in obscenity.\nPornography might be defined, not as sexually explicit material that is\nobscene, but as that sexually explicit material that harms\nwomen. Thus many contemporary feminist definitions define\n“pornography” as sexually explicit material that depicts women's\nsubordination in such a way as to endorse that subordination.\n(See Longino 1980, MacKinnon 1987.) This definition of pornography\nleaves it open in principle that there might be sexually explicit\nmaterial that is not pornography: sexually explicit material that does\nnot subordinate women will count as harmless “erotica”. \n\nOf course, women may not be the only people harmed by the production\nor consumption of certain sorts of sexually explicit material. The\nconsumption of sexually explicit material has often been thought to be\nharmful to its (mostly male) consumers: for example, by corrupting\ntheir morals or by making them less likely to have loving,\nlong-term sexual relationships. Many people strongly object to\n“child pornography”: that subset of sexually explicit material that\ninvolves depictions of actual children engaged in sexual activity. This class of sexually explicit material is\nwidely regarded as objectionable because it involves the actual sexual\nexploitation of children, together with a permanent record of that\nabuse which may further harm their interests. \n\nI have discussed how, on this third approach to defining\n“pornography” as sexually explicit material that is bad or harmful in a\ncertain way, there are three possibilities: “pornography” might name\nall, some or even no sexually explicit\nmaterial, depending on what (if any) class of sexually explicit\nmaterial is in fact bad in the relevant way. But it is worth noting\nthat there is an interesting fourth possibility. It is possible that\nsome non-sexually explicit material might also turn\nout to be bad in the relevant way. It might be that some non-sexually\nexplicit material is obscene in the relevant sense (e.g., Andres\nSerrano's famously controversial artwork entitled “Piss Christ”, which\ndisplays a plastic crucifix in urine with cow's blood). Or it might\nturn out that non-sexually explicit advertising that depicts women in\npositions of sexual servility in such a way as to endorse that\nsubordination is also bad in the relevant way. (As many\nphilosophers might be inclined to put the point, the sexually explicit\nmaterials that subordinate women via their depiction of women as\nsubordinate may turn out not to form a natural kind.) In this case,\nthere are two options. “Pornography” might be taken to name only the\nsexually explicit subset of material that is bad in\nthe relevant sense (e.g., that depicts women as men's sexual\nsubordinates in such a way as to endorse their subordination); or\n“pornography” might be taken to refer to all the material that\nis bad in that way, whether that material is sexually explicit or not.\nThe former option would clearly stick more closely to the everyday\nconception of pornography as involving the sexually explicit. But it\nmight be that this ordinary conception, on reflection, turns out not to\ncapture what is of moral and political interest and importance. There\nmay thus be a theoretical reason to conceive of pornography more\nbroadly than simply sexually explicit material that is bad in a certain\nway, or perhaps simply to invent a new term that captures the\ntheoretically interesting kind. Some feminists seem inclined to this\nbroader approach, suggesting that material that explicitly depicts\nwomen in postures of sexual submission, servility or display in such a\nway as to endorse it counts as pornography (See Longino 1980 and\nMacKinnon 1984). This may include some non-sexually explicit material\nthat would not ordinarily be thought of as pornography: for example,\nphotographs in artwork, advertising or fashion spreads that depict\nwomen bound, chained or bruised in such a way as to glamorise these\nthings. \n\nThe term “pornography” is used in all of these different ways in\neveryday discourse and debate, as well as in philosophical discussions:\nsometimes it is used to mean merely material which is sexually\nexplicit; sometimes it is used to mean material which is sexually\nexplicit and objectionable in some particular way; and so on. (For further discussion, see Rea 2001.) \nIt seems to me that we do not need to choose between these different\ndefinitions, for all of them capture something of the term's everyday\nuse. What matters crucially is that we know which definition is being\nused in a particular case. For the fact that “pornography” has\ndifferent senses can have two very unfortunate consequences if these\ndifferences are not clearly noted and kept in mind: it can make it seem\nthat there is disagreement when there is not; and it can obscure the\nreal nature of the disagreement when there is. \n\nHere is one topical example of how this might happen. Some feminists\nobject to pornography on the grounds that it harms women. Other\nfeminists claim that pornography may not always be harmful to women,\nand may even sometimes be beneficial. It seems that there is genuine\ndisagreement here. But is there? Not necessarily. For the two sides\nmight mean different things by “pornography”. Suppose that feminists\nwho object to pornography are defining “pornography” as sexually\nexplicit material that subordinates women. So pornography, for them, is\nthat subset of sexually explicit material that in fact harms women.\nThis definition makes it an analytic truth that pornography, wherever\nit exists, is bad from a feminist point of view. Feminists who defend\npornography, however, may be using “pornography” to mean simply\nsexually explicit material (regardless of whether it is harmful to\nwomen). There may thus be no genuine disagreement here. For both sides\nmight agree that sexually explicit material that harms women\nis objectionable. They might also agree that there is nothing\nobjectionable about sexually explicit material that does not harm women\n(or anyone else). If protagonists in the debate are using “pornography”\nin different senses in this way, they may simply be talking past each\nother. \n\nTwo really substantive issues at stake in the feminist debate over\npornography are 1) whether any sexually explicit material is\nin fact harmful to women; and, if so, what should be done about it?;\nand 2) whether all sexually explicit material is in fact\nharmful to women; and, if so, what should be done about it? (We can\nthus phrase two of the important issues, if we like, without mentioning\n“pornography” at all.) If we define “pornography” simply as sexually\nexplicit material (regardless of whether it is harmful to women), then\nthe first substantive issue must be posed in this way: “is there\nany pornography that is harmful to women; and, if so, what\nshould be done about it?” However, if “pornography” is defined as that\nsexually explicit material that subordinates women then, while we can\nask this question, we must pose it differently: we must ask “which\npieces of sexually explicit material, if any, are pornographic; and\nwhat should be done about any pornography that exists?” A second\nsubstantive issue at stake in the debate is whether all\nsexually explicit material, either in principle or under current social\nconditions, is or would be harmful to women. Again, it should be noted\nthat this question can be asked using either conception of\n“pornography”, but it must be posed differently. If we define\n“pornography” simply as sexually explicit material (regardless of\nwhether it is harmful), the question must be posed like this: “is all\npornography as a matter of fact harmful?” On the other hand, if we\ndefine “pornography” as sexually explicit material that harms women, we\nmust ask: “is all sexually explicit material as a matter of fact\npornographic?” These are just terminological variants of the same\nsubstantive question: but when different terminology is used by\ndifferent participants in the debate, the exact questions at issue,\nwhich are actually very simple to state, can be obscured. \n\nUntil comparatively recently, the main opposition to pornography\ncame from moral and religious conservatives, who argue that pornography\nshould be banned because its sexually explicit content is obscene and\nmorally corrupting. By “pornography”, conservatives usually mean simply\nsexually explicit material (either pictures or words), since\nconservatives typically view all such material as obscene. \n\nAccording to conservatives, the sexually explicit content of\npornography is an affront to decent family and religious values and\ndeeply offensive to a significant portion of citizens who hold these\nvalues. The consumption of pornography is bad for society. It\nundermines and destabilizes the moral fabric of a decent and stable\nsociety, by encouraging sexual promiscuity, deviant sexual practices\nand other attitudes and behaviour that threaten traditional family and\nreligious institutions, and which conservatives regard as intrinsically\nmorally wrong. Furthermore, pornography is bad for those who consume\nit, corrupting their character and preventing them from leading a good\nand worthwhile life in accordance with family and religious values. \n\nAccording to conservatives, the state is justified in using its\ncoercive power to uphold and enforce a community's moral convictions\nand to prevent citizens from engaging in activities that offend\nprevailing community standards of morality and decency. (See e.g.,\nDevlin 1968, Sandel 1984.) This position is sometimes called ‘legal\nmoralism’. Governments also have a responsibility to prevent citizens\nfrom harming themselves. This is true, even where the citizen is not a\nchild (who may not yet be competent to make responsible judgements for\nthemselves about what is in their own best interests), but a mature\nadult who is voluntary engaged in an activity which they judge to be\ndesirable and which causes no harm to others. The view that the state\nis entitled to interfere with the freedom of mentally competent adults\nagainst their will for their own good is often called ‘legal\npaternalism’. \n\nConservatives therefore think that it is entirely legitimate for the\nstate to prohibit consenting adults from publishing and viewing\npornography, even in private, in order to protect the moral health of\nwould-be consumers and of society as a whole. (See Baird and Rosenbaum\n1991.) \n\nTraditional liberal defenders of pornography famously disagree,\nrejecting both the principle of legal moralism and the principle of\nlegal paternalism, at least where consenting adults are concerned. This\nis not to say that liberal defenders of pornography necessarily approve\nof it. Indeed, they frequently personally find pornography-especially\nviolent and degrading pornography-mindless and offensive. Many concede\nthat pornography-by which they usually mean sexually explicit material\nwhose primary function is to produce sexual arousal in viewers-is “low\nvalue” speech: speech that contributes little, if anything, of\nintellectual, artistic, literary or political merit to the moral and\nsocial environment. But this does not mean that it should not be\nprotected-quite the opposite. A vital principle is at stake for\nliberals in the debate over pornography and censorship. The principle\nis that mentally competent adults must not be prevented from expressing\ntheir own convictions, or from indulging their own private tastes,\nsimply on the grounds that, in the opinion of others, those convictions\nor tastes are mistaken, offensive or unworthy. Moral majorities must\nnot be allowed to use the law to suppress dissenting minority opinions\nor to force their own moral convictions on others. The underlying\nliberal sentiment here is nicely captured in the famous adage (often\nattributed to the French philosopher, Voltaire):“I disapprove of what\nyou say, but I will defend to the death your right to say\n it.”[1] \n\nFor liberals, there is a very strong presumption in favour of\nindividual freedom, and against state regulation that interferes with\nthat freedom. The only grounds that liberals typically regard\nas providing a legitimate reason for state restrictions on individual\nfreedom is in order to prevent harm to others. Hence, in\ndebates over censorship and other forms of state regulation that\nrestrict the liberty of individuals against their will, the burden of\nproof is always firmly on those who argue for censorship to demonstrate\nthat the speech or conduct in question causes significant harm to\nothers. It must either be shown to directly cause actual physical\nviolence to others (e.g., murder, rape, assault, battery), on a\nnarrower understanding of “harm”; or to deliberately or negligently\nviolate sufficiently important interests or rights of\nothers, on a broader, interest-based conception of “harm”. (For further\ndiscussion of these different conceptions of harm to others see e.g.,\nDyzenhaus 1992, Feinberg 1987.) \n\nLiberals have traditionally defended a right to pornography on three\nmain grounds. (By the “right to pornography” here, and in what follows,\nI mean the negative right of consenting adults not to be prevented from\nmaking, publishing, exhibiting, distributing and consuming pornography\nin private). Firstly, on the grounds of freedom of speech or\nexpression, which protects the freedom of individuals (in this\ncase, pornographers) to express their opinions and to communicate those\nopinions to others, however mistaken, disagreeable or offensive others\nmay find\n them.[2]\n Liberals have tended to conceive of freedom, including freedom of\nexpression, as negative freedom-as non-interference by\nothers-rather than as positive freedom, which involves having the\npositive goods and facilities required to exercise the\n freedom.[3]\n Freedom is thus something that individuals have just so long as there\nare no coercive external obstacles-notably, physical or legal\nrestrictions-in their way. \n\nFew liberals nowadays think that the (negative) right to freedom of\nspeech is an absolute right: a freedom that can never legitimately be\nrestricted by the state. If the speech causes sufficiently great harm\nto others then the state may have a legitimate interest in regulating\nor preventing it. There is no simple general formula or algorithm for\ndetermining when the harm caused to others is “sufficiently great” to\njustify legal restrictions in the case of speech and more generally.\nThis will depend on the outcome of a complex process of carefully\nweighing and balancing the strength and nature of the harm and the\ncompeting interests at stake, and an analysis of the costs and benefits\nof alternative policies, that needs to be undertaken on a case by case\nbasis. \n\nHowever, when it comes to legislation that interferes with free\nspeech, the liberal presumption against legislation is especially high.\nFor liberals take freedom of expression to be an especially important\nright that takes precedence over most other rights and interests\n(including equality) should they ever conflict. Levels of harm that\nwould normally be sufficient to justify regulating the conduct which\ncauses them may be not be sufficiently great to justify restrictions in\ncases where the harm is caused by speech or expression. Hence, for\nliberals, justifying censorship of pornography requires that there is\nextremely reliable evidence to show that the publication or voluntary\nprivate consumption of pornography by consenting adults causes\nespecially great and serious harm to others. The harm caused\nby expression must be very certain and very great before it is\nlegitimate for a state to prohibit it. We would be justified in banning\na certain type of pornography (e.g., bondage pictures) only when we are\nvery sure that, on average, tokens of that type (i.e., most particular\nbondage pictures) cause very great harm. \n\nSecondly, liberals have defended a right to pornography on the\ngrounds of a right to privacy (or “moral independence”, as one\nprominent liberal defender of pornography calls it), which protects a\nsphere of private activity within which individuals can explore and indulge\ntheir own personal tastes and convictions, free from the threat of\ncoercive pressure or interference by the state and other individuals.\nThe spectre of state intrusion into the private lives of individuals\nunderpins much of the liberal discomfort about censorship of\npornography. \n\nLike the right to freedom of speech, the liberal commitment to\nprivacy is not absolute. It can be overridden if the private activities\nof individuals are such as to cause significant harm to others. Thus,\nif there is reliable evidence to suggest that the voluntary private\nconsumption of pornography causes sufficiently great harm to others\nthen- providing this harm is sufficiently great and that state\nprohibitions are the only effective way of preventing it-the state\nwould have a legitimate interest in prohibiting it. \n\nBut-and this is the third prong of the traditional liberal\ndefence-pornography is comparatively harmless. Neither the\nexpression of pornographic opinions, nor the indulging of a private\ntaste for pornography, causes significant harm to others, in the\nrelevant sense of ‘harm’ (i.e., crimes of physical violence or other\nsignificant wrongful rights-violations). Hence, the publication and\nvoluntary private consumption of pornography is none of the state's\nbusiness. \n\nThese three central ingredients in the liberal defence of\npornography find their classic expression in a famous and influential\npassage from John Stuart Mill's On Liberty (1859). In this\npassage, Mill sets out the principle that underpins the prevailing\nliberal view about when it is justified for the state to coercively\ninterfere with the liberty of its citizens. It is a principle that\ncontinues to provide the dominant liberal framework for the debate over\npornography and censorship. Mill writes: \n\nMill's central claim is that society is justified in interfering\nwith the freedom of mentally competent adults to say and do what they\nwish only when their conduct will cause harm to others. This\nhas come to be known as the ‘liberty principle’ or ‘harm principle’;\nand it forms the cornerstone of the traditional liberal defence of\nindividual liberty. It protects the freedom of all mentally competent\nindividuals to live and shape their own lives in accordance with their\nown preferences and beliefs, so long as they do not harm others in the\nprocess. \n\nMill goes on to stress that the harm principle is meant to apply\n“only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties”(Mill\n1975:15). So the principle permits paternalistic intervention in the\ncase of those who are not competent to make an informed decision about\nwhat is in their best interests for themselves, and so who “must be\nprotected against their own actions as well as external injury”: for\nexample, young children or those adults whose decision-making abilities\nare temporarily or permanently impaired. \n\nIt is generally thought to follow that child pornography, which is\ntaken to involve the actual sexual abuse or exploitation of\nchildren (with or without their apparent consent), can legitimately be\nbanned in order to protect the interests of children, who are not yet\ncompetent to fully understand the nature of the choice they are making\nor to grasp the impact of their decisions on their present and future\ninterests. (This is not entirely uncontroversial, however: for it might\nbe denied that children are harmed by participating in pornography. The\nNorth American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), for example, denies\nthat having sex with adults is harmful for children.) For the same\nreason, liberals think that children can quite rightly be prevented by\nparents or by the state from purchasing or viewing pornography, if this\nis thought likely to harm them. That child pornography should be banned\nis common ground between liberals and conservatives. However,\npornography that involves the simulated abuse of children (for\nexample, consenting adult actors dressed up as schoolgirls) cannot\nlegitimately be prohibited under the harm principle, unless there is\ngood evidence to suggest that consumption of this material causes\nsignificant harm to people other than those who consume it: by, for\nexample, causing those who consume it to abuse children. \n\nWe are now in a better position both to see what it would take for\nliberals to think that censorship of pornography is justified and why\nliberals have been so unsympathetic to the sort of argument against\npornography that conservatives make. Conservatives wish to prevent\nmentally competent adults from publishing and consuming pornography on\nthe grounds that the choice to consume pornography is deeply morally\nmisguided. But, as Mill insists, this is “not a sufficient warrant” for\ncoercive interference with individual liberty. Neither the state nor\nmoral majorities are entitled to restrict the private choices and\nactivities of individuals against their will simply because, in the\nopinion of state officials or the social majority, that way of life is\nunworthy or unrewarding. Mill thinks that this sort of legal moralism\nwill lead inevitably to a terrible “tyranny of the majority”, crushing\nindividual diversity and blocking human progress and flourishing. \n\nHowever, following Mill, liberals are generally happy to allow that\nconsiderations of the individual or common good may entitle the state\nto use other, so-called non-coercive means to persuade\ncitizens to make wise or better choices. Thus public education\ncampaigns designed to inform citizens of the dangers of smoking or\nexcessive alcohol consumption, or to persuade them to make “wise”\nchoices (for example, to eat more fruit and vegetables) may be\njustified. While others cannot force an individual to do something (or\nto forbear from doing it) when they are not harming others, it is\nentirely legitimate to seek to advise, instruct or persuade them. So,\nif there are reasons to think that pornography is not good for the\nindividual who consumes it (say, because it makes them less likely to\nbe able to have successful loving or long-term relationships), public\neducation campaigns to warn consumers of these dangers may be\njustified. Indeed this-education and debate-is precisely the solution\nthat liberals typically recommend to counter any harm that pornography\nmay cause. (See e.g., Feinberg 1985, Donnerstein et al. 1987, Dworkin\n1985) This solution respects the freedom of rational agents to exercise\ntheir own rational capacities in deciding what to think and how to\nlive. \n\nHowever, liberals insist that if attempts at persuasion should fail,\nand where an individual's conduct poses no significant threat to the\nphysical security or interests of others, the state may not use\ncoercive legal mechanisms to enforce these “wise” choices. “The only\nfreedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our\nown way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or\nimpede their efforts to obtain it” (Mill 1975: 18). For Mill, the\nindividual person is in the best position to judge what is in his or\nher own best interests; and, even if individuals may sometimes make bad\nchoices, it is better in general that they be left free to make these\nmistakes. For no one's opinion about the good life is infallible; and,\nin any case, a life lived ‘from the inside’, in accordance with values\nthat the individual endorses, is more likely to be a fulfilling one\nthan a life where the individual is forced against their will to live\nas others as believe best. \n\nIn an influential liberal defence of pornography, Ronald Dworkin\nexpresses this commitment in terms of a right to “moral independence”.\nPeople, he says, “have the right not to suffer disadvantage in the\ndistribution of social goods and opportunities, including disadvantages\nin the liberties permitted to them by the criminal law, just on the\nground that their officials or fellow-citizens think that their\nopinions about the right way for them to lead their own lives are\nignoble or wrong.” (Dworkin 1985: 353.) The fact, if it is one, that\nthe majority of people in a society prefer that pornography be banned\nbecause they regard it as immoral or offensive is not a legitimate\nreason for interfering with (pornographers') freedom of speech or for\npreventing consenting adults from consuming it in private. For allowing\nsuch illegitimate “external” preferences of a majority to dictate\ngovernment policy would violate the right to moral independence of the\nproducers and consumers of pornography. It would give moral majorities\nthe power to dictate how members of minority or non-mainstream groups\ncan live on the basis of the majority's opinions about what sort of\npeople are most worthy and what sorts of lives are worth living, and\nthis violates the basic right of all individuals to be treated with\nequal concern and respect. \n\nHowever, Dworkin thinks, considerations of offence may provide some\njustification for preventing or restricting the public display of\npornography so as to avoid its causing offense to\nnon-consenting adults who might otherwise involuntarily or\nunwittingly be exposed to it. Joel Feinberg, another well-known liberal\ndefender of pornography, agrees. But Feinberg thinks that such\nrestrictions must be justified by a separate principle to the harm\nprinciple, for he thinks that certain sorts of unpleasant psychological\nstates are not in themselves harms. Feinberg calls this additional\nprinciple the offense principle. The offense principle says\nthat “It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal\nprohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing\nserious offense (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than\nthe actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end (i.e.,\nthere is probably no other means that is equally effective at no\ngreater cost to the other values).” (Feinberg 1999:78. For a more\ndetailed discussion see Feinberg 1985.) \n\nLike Dworkin, Feinberg thinks that the voluntary private consumption\nof pornography does not cause harm to others. Hence, wholesale criminal\nprohibitions on the publication and private voluntary consumption of\npornography cannot be justified. But the public display of pornography\nmay nonetheless constitute an “offensive nuisance” to non-consenting\nadults who are involuntarily exposed to it (just as neighbours who play\nbad music loudly into the wee hours of the morning may be an “offensive\nnuisance”). Since the harm-or rather, pseudo-harm-of pornography is the\noffense it may cause unwitting viewers involuntarily exposed to it, the\nsolution is to restrict its exhibition to domains where such\ninvoluntary exposure will not occur, such as inside well sign-posted\nadult bookshops and cinemas where those who will be offended will know\nnot to venture. (See Feinberg 1983: 105–13.) Although this may prevent\npornographers from distributing their opinions as widely as they might\nlike, and may also cause some minor inconvenience to consumers (who may\nhave to go further out of their way to find and view pornography, or\nsuffer the embarrassment of having to sneak into known adult\nbookstores), these costs may be relatively small compared with the\nlevel of offense that involuntary exposure is likely to cause. Such\nrestrictions on the public display of pornography would not amount to\ncensorship, for pornographers are still free to publish and distribute\ntheir opinions. Nor would they violate consumers' right to privacy, for\npornography would be freely available for willing consumers to view in\nprivate. The Williams Committee Report into Obscenity and Film\nCensorship in England made a similar recommendation, pointing to\ngeneral considerations of public decency that prevent “offensive”\npublic displays of conduct (e.g., nudity or sexual intercourse) that is\nappropriately seen or done only in private. Susan Wendell also agrees\nthat the public display of certain sorts of pornography-visual, audio\nand written material that depicts and condones the unjustified physical\ncoercion of women or other human beings-should be prohibited, although\nher particular concern is to remove the anxiety that involuntarily\nexposure to such coercive material is likely to cause women and the\nharm it is likely to do to their self-esteem (Wendell 1983). \n\nLiberal defenders of the right to pornography may thus allow that\nrestrictions on its public display may be justified. But only if\npornography can reliably be shown to cause significant harm to people\nother than those who voluntarily consume it will there be a legitimate\ncase for prohibiting its voluntary private consumption. When\nan individual's private activities cause harm to others then they\nbecome no longer merely a private matter, but of legitimate public\ninterest; and the state may be justified in regulating them. Thus,\nDworkin says, were excessive consumption of pornography shown to cause\nabsenteeism from work, then the public and the state might\nhave some legitimate interest in preventing it. But, Dworkin thinks,\nthere is as yet no reliable evidence that firmly establishes that the\nvoluntary private production or consumption of pornography by\nconsenting adults causes this or any other sufficiently significant\nharm to others, in the relevant sense of ‘harm’. Hence, pornography\nsatisfies only harmless personal preferences for sexual gratification;\nand is therefore none of the state's business. \n\nLiberals also have technical concerns about how censorship laws\nmight work in practice. Many liberal (and feminist) objections to\ncensorship of pornography point to the practical costs and dangers of\ncensorship, arguing that even if pornography does cause some harm to\nothers, the risks involved in censoring it are too great. They point to\nthe difficulties involved in formulating a legal definition of\n‘pornography’ that will be sufficiently precise to minimize the danger\nthat censorship laws targeting pornography will be used (intentionally\nor unintentionally) to censor other unpopular material, including\nvaluable literary, artistic and political works. Censoring pornography\nmay thus place us on a dangerous “slippery slope” to further censorship\nof other material; and may have a general “chilling effect” on\nexpression, making people reluctant to say or publish things that might\nbe construed as pornography and for which they could be prosecuted.\n(For further discussion see Williams 1981, Schauer 1982, Easton,\n1994.) \n\nThese are serious dangers; and they need to be carefully taken into\naccount in weighing the costs and benefits of censorship as a solution\nto any harm that pornography might cause. But it is worth noting that\nthey are inherent in many existing forms of legislation, and are not\nalways taken to be insoluble or to constitute a decisive reason against\ncensorship in themselves. \n\nAlthough traditional defenders of a right to pornography have been\nliberals, it is important to note that not all contemporary liberals\ndefend such a right. Indeed, the question of whether there might be\ngood liberal grounds for prohibiting or otherwise regulating the\nvoluntary private consumption of (some) pornography has become the\nsubject of increasing and lively debate. Inspired by more recent\nfeminist arguments against pornography, some scholars argue that the\nliberal commitment to protecting individual autonomy, equality,\nfreedom of expression and other important liberal values may in fact\nsupport a policy that prohibits certain kinds of pornography, rather\nthan the permissive stance that liberals have traditionally\nfavoured. (See e.g., Dyzenhaus 1992, Easton 1994: 42–51, Langton 1990,\nOkin 1987, West 2003.) These theorists do not normally reject the harm\nprinciple, broadly understood: They generally agree that the crucial\nquestion in determining whether censorship of pornography is justified\nis whether there is reliable evidence to show that the publication or\nviewing of pornography by consenting adults causes sufficiently great\nharm to significant interests of others. Rather, they are open to the\nlegitimacy of censorship because they think that the production and\nconsumption of certain sorts of sexually explicit material—in\nparticular, violent pornography and non-violent but degrading\npornography—may in fact cause sufficiently significant harm to\nothers, particularly women. \n\nThese theorists often follow social science researchers in drawing\nmore fine-grained distinctions within the general category of\npornography (i.e., the sexually explicit material whose primary\nfunction is to produce sexual arousal in those who view or read them).\nThey often distinguish between 1) violent pornography; 2) non-violent\nbut degrading pornography; and 3) non-violent and non-degrading\npornography, since there is some evidence to suggest that some of these\nmaterials (e.g., in categories 1 and 2) may be harmful in ways that\nother material (e.g., category 3) is not. I will summarize some of this\nimportant evidence shortly. \n\nOne important dimension of the disagreement between those liberals\nwho defend a right to pornography and those who think that liberals\nshould be open to the legitimacy of censorship is empirical:\nthey disagree about the crucial empirical issue of whether there is\nreliable evidence to show that the production and consumption of\npornography by consenting adults in fact causes harm to others,\nparticularly women. But frequently they also disagree about some\nimportant conceptual matters as well. In particular, they may\ndisagree (albeit sometimes implicitly) about how three central elements\nof the harm principle should be understood: (i) exactly what counts as\n“harm” to others, in the relevant sense; (ii) when can we say that\nsomething is a “cause”, or a sufficiently “direct cause”, of a harm;\nand (iii) how much harm to others is “sufficiently great” to justify\ncoercive sanctions against the speech or conduct that produces it. In\nother words, they disagree about how the harm principle should be\ninterpreted and applied. \n\nMany argue that more traditional liberal conceptions of the\ninterests or rights that individuals have, and so of what activities\ncan cause harm to them, is too narrow. It ignores the way in which\nthreats to individuals' interests can come not just from the state, but\nalso from other social practices and circumstances (e.g., substantive\nsocio-economic disadvantage) that can prevent the meaningful exercise\nof freedom just as effectively. The state may thus have a legitimate\nrole to play in promoting the social conditions that enable individuals\nto exercise their rights in meaningful ways, and in regulating such\nactivities of non-governmental agents or groups as may serve\nsignificantly to infringe them. \n\nAccording to anti-pornography feminists, pornography is not harmless\nentertainment or cathartic, therapeutic fantasy. Nor is the harm it\ncauses merely that of ‘offence’. Unlike moral conservatives, who object\nto pornography on the grounds of the obscenity of its sexual explicit\ncontent and its corrosive effect on the conservative way of life, the\nprimary focus of the feminist objection to pornography is on the\ncentral role that pornography is thought to play in the\nexploitation and oppression of women. (See e.g., Lederer 1980,\nItzin 1992, MacKinnon 1984, 1987, 1995.) \n\nThis concern is reflected in the distinctive way anti-pornography\nfeminists tend to define “pornography”. As we have seen, conservatives\ntypically define “pornography” as including all sexually explicit\nmaterial. This definition reflects the fact that conservatives object\nto pornography's sexual explicitness, which is obscene or appeals to\n“prurient interests”. Anti-pornography feminists, however, do not\nobject to pornography's sexually explicit content per se. They\ntypically draw a more fine-grained distinction within the\nclass of sexually explicit materials, between “pornography”, on the one\nhand, and “erotica”, on the other. “Erotica” is generally defined as\nsexually explicit material premised on equality, which depicts women as\ngenuinely equal and consenting participants in sexual encounters.\n“Pornography”, in contrast, is typically defined as that subset of\nsexually explicit material that depicts women being coerced, abused,\ndominated or degraded in such a way as to endorse their\nsubordination. Unlike conservatives, anti-pornography feminists have no\nobjection to material which is merely sexually explicit i.e., erotica.\nFor sexually explicit material of this sort does not harm women. The\nobjection is to pornography: that subset of sexually explicit\nmaterial that subordinates women. \n\nIn 1983, two of the most prominent anti-pornography feminists in the\nUnited States, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, drafted an\nanti-pornography ordinance at the behest of the Minneapolis Council. A\nsimilar ordinance was passed by the Indianapolis City Council in 1984,\nbut later overturned on appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court, on the\ngrounds that the ordinance violated pornographers First Amendment right\nto freedom of speech. Importantly, the ordinance did not seek to impose\ncriminal prohibitions or sanctions on pornography: it did not seek to\nmake the production, sale or consumption of pornography a criminal\noffence, punishable by imprisonment (as, for example, producing,\nselling or consuming heroin is a criminal offence). MacKinnon and\nDworkin thought that criminalizing the production, publication or\nconsumption of pornography would be counterproductive, serving to drive\nthe industry underground, thereby only further obscuring the harm it\ncauses to women. Rather, the ordinance sought civil remedies\nthat would enable women who are harmed in the making of pornography, or\nas a result of its consumption, to sue for a future ban on sexually\nexplicit material demonstrated to be harmful and to collect damages\nfrom pornographers for provable harm done by that material. There is\nsome argument about whether the proposed legislation would have\namounted to censorship, strictly speaking, since it did not seek to\nplace a prior ban on the publication of pornographic materials. But\ninsofar as the legislation allowed for courts to award and enforce\ninjunctions against publication of material demonstrated to be harmful,\nmany think that the legislation may have been functionally equivalent\nto censorship in practice (assuming that courts would in fact have been\nwilling to award and enforce injunctions). \n\nThe ordinance has been the subject of a heated debate among\nfeminists, many of whom are dubious both about the centrality of\npornography's role in the subordination of women and about the\ndesirability of employing strategies of legal regulation in the pursuit\nof feminist goals. (See e.g., Hunter and Law 1985, Lacey 1998: 71–97,\nCornell 2000.) But the ordinance was significant, not least for\nreconceptualizing the question of pornography in the public arena in\nfeminist terms: not as an issue about obscenity or public indecency, as\nit had hitherto tended to be viewed in legal and political contexts\nunder the influence of moral conservatives, but as an issue about the\ncivil rights of women. It also provided the definition of\npornography that has since featured most prominently in feminist\ndiscussions. The ordinance defined “pornography” as a civil rights\nviolation, as a systematic practice of sexual discrimination\nthat violates women's right to equality: \n\nWe define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination\nof women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are\npresented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or\n(ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or\npain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing\nsexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women\nare presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised\nor physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions\nof sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women's body parts\n— including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks\n— are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or\n(vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or\n(viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation,\ninjury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or\nhurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual. (MacKinnon\n1987:176.) \n\nDworkin and MacKinnon allow that sexually explicit material that\ntreats men, children or transsexuals in sexually dehumanising or\nsubordinating ways also counts as pornography. \n\nThe Dworkin-MacKinnon definition has two parts or stages. The first\npart of the definition defines “pornography” broadly in terms of a\ncertain functional role or, as MacKinnon puts it, in terms of “what it\ndoes”: it defines “pornography” as that sexually explicit material,\nwhatever it is, that subordinates\n women.[4]\n The second part of the definition, the content list (i)-(viii), goes\non to list of the sorts of sexually explicit material that MacKinnon\nand Dworkin think in fact functions to subordinate women, as\nrevealed by the testimonial, experimental, social and clinical\nevidence. The content list aims to be sufficiently precise so as to\nminimize the likelihood of legislation against pornography, so\ndefined, threatening other forms of speech-although many\n“anti-censorship” feminists, along with traditional liberal defenders\nof pornography, are not convinced that it succeeds (See e.g., Hunter\nand Law 1985, R. Dworkin 1993). \n\nI draw attention to the two-stages of the definition to reinforce a\npoint made in section 1: that one might agree with Dworkin and\nMacKinnon that pornography, defined purely functionally or conceptually\nas sexually explicit material that subordinates women, would be a bad\nthing; and yet disagree that the material with the features that they\ngo on to list in fact does this. (I think this might help to defuse\nsome of the frequently acrimonious debate in feminist circles\nsurrounding MacKinnon's now famous claim that one cannot genuinely be a\nfeminist and be pro- (or at least fail to be anti-) pornography. For of\ncourse feminists are opposed to anything that subordinates or oppresses\nwomen. Yet there is surely room for reasonable disagreement about what,\nif any, sexually explicit material does this, and whether pursuing\nlegal regulation of it is a desirable feminist strategy). \n\nThe harms that most concern anti-pornography feminists fall into two\nbroad categories: 1) coercion and exploitation of women actors in the\nproduction of pornography; and 2) harms to women, both as individuals\nand as a group, resulting from the consumption of pornography. \n\nOne particularly graphic example of the first sort of harm is\ndocumented in a book called Ordeal, written by Linda Marchiano\nwho starred as ‘Linda Lovelace’ in the famous pornographic film ‘Deep\nThroat’ (see Lovelace 1980). In Ordeal, Marchiano tells of how\nshe was abducted, hypnotized, drugged, beaten and tortured in order to\nperform her starring role. Marchiano was one of a number of women who\ntestified about their experience of the harm caused by pornography at\nthe Minneapolis hearings into pornography in 1983. (The transcript of\nthe hearings is published as Pornography and Sexual Violence:\nEvidence of the Links 1988.) Marchiano's case is a particularly\nhorrifying and extreme example of how women may be harmed in the making\nof pornography; and much of what was done to Marchiano (the abduction,\nthe beatings and the torture) are criminal offences in their own right.\nMany, both liberals and feminists, think that since these physical\nassaults should not be allowed, enduring pornographic representations\nof these crimes that cause further harm to the victim's interests\nshould not be permitted to be distributed or consumed either (See e.g.,\nMacKinnon 1987, Wendell 1983). \n\nOf course, not all women who perform in pornography are literally\nphysically coerced as paradigm slaves are, and as Marchiano was.\nNonetheless, many anti-pornography feminists are concerned that there\nis an important sense in which the ‘choice’ to participate in the\nmaking of pornography may not be a genuinely free one for many of the\nwomen who perform in it, who often come from underprivileged\nsocio-economic backgrounds and who have few alternative options for\nmaking a living. Under these circumstances, there may be an important\nsense in which the choice to perform in pornography is ‘coerced’,\ninsofar as the women would not have chosen to perform in pornography\nhad other reasonable options been available to them. The pornography\nindustry may take unfair advantage of underprivileged women, preying on\ntheir psychic and economic vulnerability, to reap enormous profits at\ntheir expense. MacKinnon puts the point graphically: pornography is a\npublic institution of sexual slavery, trafficking in vulnerable women\nand children, and profiting from their suffering and subjugation. \n\nSome of the women who perform in pornography vigorously reject the\nclaim that they are exploited. At least in their own case, they argue,\nthe decision to become a porn star was a genuinely autonomous one. (See\nGruen and Panichas 1997.) They regard the claim that they are victims\nof exploitation as offensively patronizing and paternalistic, implying\nthat pornography is not a worthwhile or valid career choice, and\nportraying the women who act in pornography as hapless dupes of\npatriarchy. In reality, female porn actors may be fully autonomous and\nintelligent citizens pursuing a perfectly valid and rewarding career of\ntheir own choosing. Banning pornography, they argue, would constitute\nunjustified paternalistic interference with their right to pursue their\ncareer of choice. Of course, that the decision to pursue a career in\npornography is a free and fulfilling one for some women does\nnot go to show that it is necessarily a free and fulfilling choice for\nall or even most of the women who perform in pornography. \n\nEven if the pornography industry does exploit some of the women who\nperform in it, however, there is a question about whether this\njustifies disallowing it. As a number of feminists and liberals have\nnoted in reply, other industries (such as supermarkets or fast food\nchains) may likewise take advantage of workers with few alternative\nopportunities. Should these too be banned on grounds of exploitation?\nSurely not, they think. The best solution to such exploitation is\narguably not to ban pornography (or fast food chains). For this would\nonly further deprive those already deprived of one more option, and one\nthat they might prefer over others of the limited range available to\nthem. We may do better to focus our efforts on redressing the\nunderlying economic and material conditions of disadvantage that make\nexploitation possible, so that the choice to perform in pornography\nmight be made, if it is made, as a genuinely free one, under fuller\nconditions of equality. (See e.g., Dworkin 1993; Wendell, 1983.) \n\nSecond, anti-pornography feminists point to a range of harms to\nwomen that result from the consumption of pornography. (For a variety\nof analyses here see A. Dworkin 1981, MacKinnon 1987, Jeffreys 1990,\nKappeler 1986, Coward 1984, Smart 1989: ch. 6, Itzin 1998.) These may\ninclude, but are not limited to, pornography's role as a cause of\nviolent sexual crime. Some feminists in the U.K. have argued for\nanti-pornography legislation on the model of existing U.K. laws\npreventing racial incitement: pornography is speech that incites sexual\nviolence, and prohibition of such speech as incites sexual violence is\njustified for the same reason as prohibitions against racially\nincendiary speech, namely, to protect the physical security and bodily\nintegrity of individuals. (See e.g., Itzin 1992) \n\nOther feminist arguments focus instead, or as well, on the broader\nrole pornographic representations may play in harming other of women's\nsignificant interests. Some have suggested that pornography can be\nviewed as a sort of false advertising about women and sexuality, or as\nbeing akin to libellous speech: speech that defames women as a group,\ncausing corresponding harm to their reputation, credibility,\nopportunities and income expectations. They argue that women as a group\nhave a right to (civil) legal protection from these harms, and to claim\nfor compensation for such harm as pornographic speech can be\ndemonstrated to have produced. (See Longino 1980, Hill 1987, MacKinnon\n1995: 3–28. For criticism see Soble 1985). This is a promising strategy\nfor anti-pornography feminists, since many liberals already accept that\nindividuals have a right to protection from libellous or defamatory\nspeech. \n\nOther feminist arguments focus on the related role pornography may\nplay in restricting women's autonomy, by reproducing and reinforcing a\ndominant public perception of the nature of women and sexuality that\nprevents women from articulating and exploring their own conceptions of\nsexuality and of the good life. (Easton 1994, Dyzenhaus 1992.) \n\nYet another line of feminist argument draws on the work of the\nprominent liberal philosopher, John Rawls, to suggest that regulation\nof pornography is justified insofar as rational, self-interested\nindividuals in the original position would not agree to basic social\ninstitutions that “asymmetrically either forced or gave strong\nincentives to members of one sex to become sex objects for the other”\n(Okin 1987:68). Rae Langton (1990) also seeks to use liberals' own\ntheoretical commitments to make a (liberal) case for the legitimacy of\ncensorship, though her chosen liberal is Ronald Dworkin. Langton seeks\nto turn the tables on Dworkin's argument in an ingenious way, arguing\nthat a consistent application of Dworkin's own principles actually\nsupports a policy that prohibits pornography, rather than the\npermissive policy he himself favours. For preferences to consume\npornography necessarily depend on external preferences about the\ninferior worth of women that violate women's right to moral\nindependence. Furthermore, positive arguments for prohibiting\npornography may aim at securing social equality for women. If this is\nthe goal then, by Dworkin's own lights, pornographers would have no\nrights against a prohibitive policy. \n\nMany of these concerns figure in a somewhat new light in a\nsignificant, rights-based strand of feminist argument, associated most\nprominently with Catharine MacKinnon. Since this approach has provoked\nparticular interest and discussion among both liberals and feminists,\nand has come to constitute a dominant framework for much of the\ncontemporary debate between liberals and feminists over pornography, it\nis worth examining it in more detail. According to MacKinnon,\npornography harms women in a very special and serious way: by violating\ntheir civil rights (MacKinnon 1984, 1987, 1992). In\nparticular, pornography subordinates women or violates their right\nto equal civil status; and it silences them or violates their\ncivil right to freedom of speech. \n\nPornography subordinates women by sexualising their\ninequality. Pornography both expresses the view that women exist\nprimarily as objects for men's sexual gratification-that they are men's\nsexual slaves, and frequently their willing sexual slaves-and it\npropagates this view, by conditioning consumers to regard women's\nsubordination as a sexy, natural and legitimate feature of normal\nheterosexual relations. Pornography “sexualises rape, battery, sexual\nharassment, prostitution and child sexual abuse, it thereby celebrates,\npromotes, authorizes and legitimises them.” (MacKinnon 1987:171–72). By\nauthorizing and legitimating the subjection of women, pornography makes\nthe very real harm of women's subordination invisible as harm: rape,\nharassment and other forms of oppression come to be seen simply as sex.\n“The harm of pornography, broadly speaking, is the harm of the civil\ninequality of the sexes made invisible as harm” (MacKinnon 1987: 178).\nThe view of women and sexuality that pornography helps to form and\nperpetuate manifests itself not simply in crimes of sexual violence\nagainst women, but in discrimination against women more generally: in\nthe legal system, in politics and public debate, and in the workplace.\nPornography “institutionalizes the sexuality of male supremacy...Men\ntreat women as who they see women as being. Pornography constructs who\nthat is” (MacKinnon 1987:172). By conditioning consumers to view and\ntreat women as their sexual subordinates, pornography undermines\nwomen's ability to participate as full and equal citizens in public, as\nwell as private, realms. \n\nOne significant dimension of this inequality is that women's speech,\nwhere it occurs, lacks the credibility, authority and influence of\nmen's. Women as a group are systematically and differentially\nsilenced, MacKinnon thinks; and pornography contributes to\nthis in at least three ways (MacKinnon 1987, 1995). \n\nFirst, pornography silences women by helping to shape and reinforce\na hostile and uncomprehending social environment which makes many women\nreluctant to speak at all. Thus, for example, rape, sexual harassment\nand other violent sexual crime is significantly underreported by\nwomen. \n\nSecond, pornography creates a social climate in which, even where\nwomen do speak, their opinions are frequently paid little serious\nattention-especially where what women say contradicts the picture of\nwomen contained in pornography. Thus women who do report sexual crime\nare often disbelieved, ignored, ridiculed, or dismissed as neurotic. In\nMacKinnon's words, pornography “strips and devastates women of\ncredibility, from our accounts of sexual assault to our everyday\nreality of sexual subordination. We are stripped of authority and\nreduced and devalidated and silenced”. (MacKinnon 1992: 483–4.) \n\nThird, pornography may silence women by causing their speech to fail\nto be understood, or to be misunderstood. For example, pornography may\nhelp to form and reinforce the general view that women who utter ‘no’\nin sexual contexts frequently do not intend to refuse a man's sexual\nadvantages by so speaking, and indeed may often intend to further\nencourage them. In a social environment in which this expectation is\nprevalent, women may not be able to successfully communicate the idea\nof refusal to others: although they may utter the appropriate sounds\n(e.g., ‘no’), those sounds may frequently fail to communicate the idea\nthey were intended to express. Pornography may thus prevent women from\ncommunicating their ideas to others, not by preventing them from\nproducing or distributing sounds and scrawls, but by preventing those\nsounds and scrawls from being understood by hearers as expressing the\nidea they were intended to express. (See Langton 1993, Hornsby 1995,\nHornsby and Langton 1998, Maitra 2009, McGowan 2003, West 2003. For replies to Hornsby and Langton, see Jacobsen 2001, Bird 2002). If pornography silences women in this\nway, there may be some reason to be sceptical that the solution\npreferred by many liberals (and feminists) of countering the harms of\npornography with more speech-protest, satire, education and public\ndebate-will be effective. For pornography may make the relevant speech\nacts “unspeakable” for women. \n\nFor MacKinnon, then, a desire for pornography and sexual violence is\nnot an epiphenomenal symptom or side-effect of other material and\nsocial conditions that lie at the root of women's subordinate position\nin society, as some other feminists are inclined to think. Rather, it\nis a central cause of the subordinate position of women in society. So\nlong as there is pornography, MacKinnon thinks, women will remain\nsubordinate and silenced. \n\nOne novel and strategically ingenious feature of MacKinnon's\nargument against pornography (and one that has provoked much of the\nmore recent interest and debate) is her conceptualisation of the harm\nof pornography as the violation of women's civil rights, of\nwhich sexual violence against women may be but one, albeit significant,\ndimension. The violation of civil rights is a harm that most liberals\nhave special reason for taking very seriously. For while some liberals\nunderstand the notion of “harm” to others very narrowly, as including\nonly physical interference with a person's bodily integrity (e.g.,\nmurder, battery, torture, kidnap, rape and other such physical assaults\netc.), most liberals nowadays are inclined to accept a slightly broader\ninterpretation of the harm principle. On this broader, interest- or\nrights-based interpretation of the harm principle, any speech or\nconduct that wilfully or negligently interferes with important\ninterests or rights of others is harmful conduct. On this\ninterest-based interpretation of the harm principle, the state is\nentitled to pass laws against conduct that deliberately or negligently\ninterferes with the rights of others, just so long as the\nrights-violation is sufficiently serious and the harm cannot\neffectively be prevented by other, less costly means (for example,\nthrough public education or debate). Of course, how this version of the\nharm principle applies depends crucially on the nature and relative\nimportance of the rights that individuals have; and this is the subject\nof much ongoing debate. \n\nSome liberals have accepted that pornography may contribute to\nwomen's subordination: if not by directly causing crimes of sexual\nviolence, then at least by conditioning consumers to view women as sex\nobjects, rather than as autonomous individuals worthy of equal concern\nand respect. They grant that this may contribute to discrimination\nagainst women in society, and that it may prevent women from having the\nsame social and political influence that men generally possess. But,\nthey argue, this harm is not sufficiently great to justify interfering\nwith pornographers' freedom of speech. The right to freedom of\nexpression is a more important right. So, if we have to choose between\nthe right to equality (of women) and the right to freedom of speech (of\npornographers), we must choose freedom of\n\n speech.[5]\n But MacKinnon's argument, if successful, would turn the tables on\nthese traditional liberal defences of pornography: pornography could\nno longer be defended simply on the grounds of the primacy of the\nright to freedom of speech, for permitting pornography\nviolates women's right to freedom of speech too. We now\nseem to have a conflict of rights: not simply between pornographers'\nright to freedom of speech and women's right to equal civil status,\nbut within the right to freedom of expression itself-between\npornographers' right to freedom of speech and women's right to freedom\nof speech. Why should pornographers' right to freedom of expression\ntake precedence over women's? I will return to the debates surrounding\nthis question in the next section. \n\nOf course, not all feminists object to pornography, even in\nMacKinnon's sense (see e.g., Burstyn 1985, Chester and Dickey 1988,\nCornell 2000, Hunter and Law 1985, Gruen and Panichas 1997). The\nquestion of pornography and censorship has divided feminists, just as\nit has begun to divide liberals. Some feminists argue that pornography\nis an important form of sexual expression that does not harm women, and\nmay even benefit them by liberating women and women's sexuality from\nthe oppressive shackles of tradition and sexual conservatism.\nPornography, on this view, is an important tool for exploring and\nexpressing new or minority forms of female sexuality. Far from making\ndowntrodden victims of women, pornography may have a vital role to play\nin challenging traditional views about femininity and female sexuality\nand in empowering women, both homosexual and heterosexual, to shape\ntheir own identities as sexual beings. (Note that material that\nbenefits women ought to count as erotica, rather than pornography, on\nMacKinnon's definition. So, as noted in section 1, if there is\nsubstantive disagreement between “pro-pornography” feminists and\nMacKinnon here, it will be about whether there really is any sexually\nexplicit material that is beneficial). \n\nThere are also a significant number of feminists who object to\npornography, or to certain forms of it, on the grounds that it harms\nwomen, but who do not think that regulating or banning it is the most\ndesirable or effective way to remedy the harms that pornography causes.\nThese feminists, though not always liberals, nonetheless share some\ngeneral liberal concerns about using the ‘blunt and treacherous’\ninstrument of the law in the quest to redress harms, especially in\nlight of the way in which the law has frequently been used to oppress\nwomen, or where laws enacted with the best of intentions have\nnonetheless had this unintended effect. Censorship, they think, may\nwell cause more harm to women than it removes. They recommend\nmore speech-education, protest, picketing, satire and public\ndebate-rather than censorship or other forms of legal regulation, as\nless dangerous and more effective tools for raising public\nconsciousness and effecting the desired attitudinal and cultural\nchange. These feminists are anti-pornography (in the sense that they\nthink material that degrades women is objectionable), but they are also\nanti-censorship. \n\nIndeed, eighty individual feminists, along with the Feminist\nAnti-Censorship Taskforce (F.A.C.T.) and the Women's Legal Defense\nFund, presented an Amici Brief to the Hudnut court\noutlining a range of feminist concerns about the anti-pornography\nlegislation proposed by MacKinnon and Dworkin (Hunter and Law 1985).\nThese included concerns about the political dangers of feminists\naligning themselves with the conservative, evangelical right; the\npossibility of the legislation discriminating against minority forms of\nsexuality (e.g., lesbianism); interference with women's freedom to\nchoose to produce and perform in pornography; perpetuating traditional\nideas that sex is bad for women; and diverting attention and resources\naway from more important immediate efforts to bring an end to violence\nagainst women. \n\nDespite the efforts of anti-pornography feminists, many traditional\nliberal defenders of pornography remain unconvinced. They typically\ncontinue to maintain either that pornography does not cause harm to\nwomen (in the relevant, usually narrow, sense of ‘harm’), or they admit\nthat pornography probably does cause some harm to women's interests,\nbut deny that this harm is sufficiently great to offset the dangers\ninherent in censorship and to justify the violation of the rights of\npornographers and would-be consumers. \n\nLiberal defenders of pornography readily admit that, if there were\nreliable evidence to show that consumption of pornography significantly\nincreases the incidence of violence sexual crime, there would be a very\nstrong liberal case for prohibiting it. However, liberal defenders of\npornography remain unconvinced that there is reliable evidence to show\nthat pornography is a cause of rape or other sexual crime. Ronald\nDworkin, for example, writes “…in spite of MacKinnon's fervent\ndeclarations, no reputable study has concluded that pornography is a\nsignificant cause of sexual crime: many of them conclude, on the\ncontrary, that the causes of violent personality lie mainly in\nchildhood, before exposure to pornography can have had any effect, and\nthat desire for pornography is a symptom rather than a cause of\ndeviance” (Dworkin 1993: 38). \n\nThe question of whether pornography causes harm raises tricky\nconceptual issues about the notion of causality, as well as empirical\nand methodological ones. (See Eaton 2007, Schauer 1987, and The Attorney General's\nCommission on Pornography 1986, excerpts from which are reprinted in\nMappes and Zembaty 1997: 212–218.). The causal connection between\nconsumption of pornography and violent sexual crime, if there is one,\nis unlikely to be a simple one. As some liberals have argued, it seems\nimplausible to think that consumption of pornography, on a single or\neven repeated occasions, will cause otherwise “normal, decent chaps”\nwith no propensity to rape suddenly “to metamorphose into rapists”.\n(Feinberg, 1985:153, also see entry on\n Freedom of Speech.)\n However, we might\nagree with Feinberg, and yet think that pornography might still be a\ncause of rape. Consumption of pornography might cause rape by making it\nmore likely that those who are already inclined to rape will actually\nrape, thereby increasing the overall incidence of rape. Of course,\npornography may not be the only cause of rape or other violent\nsexual crime. The contributing causes of violence against women are\nlikely to be numerous and connected in complex ways: they may include,\namong other things, “macho values” (as Feinberg suggests) and certain\nsorts of childhood events and circumstances (as Dworkin says). But the\nmere fact that there may be other causes of sexual violence\nagainst women does not show that consumption of pornography cannot\nalso be a cause. Consumption of pornography may, on its own,\nbe neither necessary nor sufficient for violent sexual crime (or for\nsexist attitudes and behaviour more generally); yet it might still be a\ncause of violent sexual crime and these other harms, if it increases\nthe incidence of them. \n\nIt might be helpful to consider an analogy with smoking. Smoking\ncigarettes, on its own, is neither a necessary, nor a sufficient,\ncondition for developing lung cancer: since there are people who smoke\nlike chimneys who never develop lung cancer and live perfectly healthy\nlives to a ripe old age; and there are people who have never smoked a\ncigarette in their whole life who develop lung cancer. Yet it is\ngenerally agreed nowadays that smoking cigarettes is a cause of lung\ncancer. This is because smoking (in combination with other factors such\nas genetics, diet and exercise) makes it significantly more likely that\na person will develop lung cancer, or so the studies suggest. Likewise,\nwe might think that consumption of pornography will be a cause of\nviolent sexual crime (or of sexist attitudes and behaviour more\ngenerally) if there is good evidence to suggest that consumption of\npornography increases the incidence of sexual violence or sexist\nbehaviour, holding fixed other known causes of these harmful states of\n affairs.[6] \n\nThere is considerable disagreement, among social science researchers\nas well as liberal and feminist philosophers, about whether pornography\nis a cause of violent sexual crime (see Donnerstein et al. 1987, Copp\nand Wendell 1983, Itzin 1992). Both the final report of the Commission\nof Obscenity and Pornography in the U.S. in 1970 and the Williams\nCommittee Report into Obscenity and Film Censorship in the U.K.\nsurveyed the data from clinical and experimental trials then available\nand found no evidence of a causal connection between pornography and\nrape (although the 1970 Commission did not review the evidence\nconcerning sexually violent material). However, the Attorney General's\nCommission on Pornography in the U.S., which submitted its final report\nin 1986, found that the clinical and experimental research ‘virtually\nunanimously’ shows that exposure to sexually violent material increases\nthe likelihood of aggression toward women; and that “the available\nevidence strongly supports the hypothesis that substantial exposure to\nsexually violent materials…bears a causal relationship to\nantisocial acts of sexual violence and, for some subgroups, possibly to\nunlawful acts of sexual violence” (Mappes and Zembaty 1997: 215). The\nreport also found that non-violent but degrading pornographic material\nproduced effects “similar to, although not as extensive as that\ninvolved with violent material”. However, the report concluded that\nnon-degrading and non-violent material (erotica, in feminist terms)\n“does not bear a causal relationship to rape and other acts of sexual\nviolence”. \n\nA number of studies have found a positive correlation between\nexposure to violent pornographic images (for example, of rape, bondage,\nmolestation involving weapons and mutilation) and positive reactions to\nrape and other forms of violence against women. Studies suggest, among\nother things, that exposure to violent pornography can significantly\nenhance a subject's arousal in response to the portrayal of rape, that\nexposure to films that depict sexual violence against women can act as\na stimulus for aggressive acts against women, and that prolonged\nexposure to degrading pornography (of a violent or non-violent sort)\nleads to increased callousness towards victims of sexual violence, a\ngreater acceptance of ‘rape-myths’ (for example, that women enjoy rape\nand do not mean no when they say ‘no’), a greater likelihood of having\nrape-fantasies, and a greater likelihood of reporting that one would\nrape women or force women into unwanted sex acts if there was no chance\nof being caught. \n\nThe empirical evidence remains the subject of ongoing debate and\ninvestigation. But in the absence of sufficiently conclusive evidence\nthat pornography causes crimes of sexual violence, many liberal\ndefenders of pornography continue to view censorship as\nunjustified. \n\nHowever, the rights-based feminist arguments against pornography do\nnot rest entirely on the claim that consumption of pornography is a\nsignificant cause of violent sexual crime. The claim that pornography\ncontributes to women's inequality, and the claim that it violates\nwomen's right to freedom of speech, can rest on more moderate empirical\nclaims about which there is likely to be more agreement: for example,\nthat pornography helps to form and reinforce the view that women are\nsex objects, which manifests itself in how women are perceived and\ntreated in society and so perpetuates women's inequality. Among other\nthings, it may increase the likelihood of sexual harassment and other\nforms of discrimination against women, undermine women's credibility in\ncertain contexts, encourage a general expectation that women who say\n‘no’ in sexual contexts often do not intend to refuse, and so on. \n\nRonald Dworkin is one prominent liberal who has explicitly\nconsidered, and rejected, MacKinnon's version of the rights-based\narguments for anti-pornography legislation. This is not primarily\nbecause he rejects the moderate empirical claims. Rather it is because\nhe thinks that, even if those claims were true, there would be no\nlegitimate sense in which the publication and voluntary private\nconsumption of pornography violate women's civil rights. \n\nAccording to Dworkin, the argument for anti-pornography legislation\non the grounds that pornography subordinates women rests on the\n“frightening principle that considerations of equality require that\nsome people not be free to express their tastes or convictions or\npreferences anywhere.” (Dworkin 1993: 39.) Accepting this principle\nwould have “devastating consequences”: namely, that “government could\nforbid the graphic or visceral or emotionally charged expression of any\nopinion that might reasonably offend a disadvantaged group. It could\noutlaw performances of The Merchant of Venice, or films about\nprofessional women who neglect their children, or caricatures or\nparodies of homosexuals in nightclub routines.” Dworkin's concern is a\nkind of logical slippery slope objection that that he takes to\nconstitute a reductio of MacKinnon's view. The worry is that\nthe principle that underpins MacKinnon's argument would, if\nconsistently applied, threaten many other forms of speech in clearly\nunacceptable ways. \n\nNote that Dworkin construes-or misconstrues-MacKinnon's argument as\na version of the old moralistic argument that objects to pornography on\ngrounds of its offensiveness; and, as we have seen, liberals reject\noffense as legitimate grounds for preventing the voluntary consumption\nof pornography in private. However, MacKinnon's argument does not-or\nneed not-rest on this ‘frightening’ principle. The feminist case is not\nthat pornography should be regulated because it expresses opinions that\nare offensive to feminists. Rather, it should be regulated because,\noffensive or not, it contributes significantly to a regime of sexual\ninequality. \n\nNonetheless, this principle-that government is justified in\nprohibiting speech that contributes significantly to a group's\ninequality- is one that some liberals may find equally disturbing. For\nit may well apply to speech other than pornography, including perhaps\nthe examples that Dworkin mentions. \n\nDworkin is not alone in this concern. Other liberals and feminists\nhave questioned MacKinnon's focus on pornography as the key site of\nwomen's oppression, when it seems that many other non-sexually\nexplicit materials plausibly also endorse and perpetuate a view of\nwomen as sex objects, albeit perhaps in less graphic and explicit\nforms. (Perhaps this lack of explicitness makes them more insidious;\nand hence of more, rather than less, concern). Pornography may\nsexualise women's inequality, but advertising and romance\nnovels plausibly glamorise and romanticize it\nrespectively; and hence may celebrate, authorize and legitimise women's\ninequality in the same way as pornography. (See e.g., Cocks 1989,\nCoward 1984, Valverde 1985, Kappeler 1986, Skipper 1993.) Indeed some\nof these other representations may be especially worrying, not simply\nbecause they may be more pervasive, but also insofar they may condition\nwomen to be complicit in their own subjection. MacKinnon's focus on the\ngraphic sexually explicit material that celebrates women's inequality\nmay thus seem arbitrary, in the absence of evidence that the sexually\nexplicit subset of material is an especially significant cause of\nwomen's inequality. \n\nPerhaps there are principled, pragmatic reasons for singling out\npornography (i.e., the sexually explicit subset of the material that\nconditions people to view women as willing sex objects) for censorship\nor regulation, even if we were to agree that non-sexually explicit may\nalso condition consumers to this view of women. For it might be that\ncensorship of pornography would alleviate a considerable amount of this\nharm, without incurring the same costs as censoring some or all of the\nnon-sexually explicit material that contributes to the harm. But this\nis controversial. \n\nWhat about the claim that pornography violates women's right to\nfreedom of speech? The argument rests on a “dangerous confusion”,\nDworkin thinks: the confusion of positive and negative liberty. It\nrests on the “unacceptable proposition: that the right to free speech\nincludes a right to circumstances that encourage one to speak, and a\nright that others grasp and respect what one means to say...These are\nobviously not rights that any society can recognise or enforce.\nCreationists, flat-earthers, and bigots, for example, are ridiculed in\nmany parts of America now; that ridicule undoubtedly dampens the\nenthusiasm that many of them have for speaking out and limits the\nattention others pay to what they have to say” (Dworkin 1993: 38). But,\nDworkin suggests, we surely should not think that that this violates\ntheir right to freedom of speech: e.g., that creationists have a\nlegitimate claim on the state to ban the publication of books or videos\nrecommending the theory of evolution on the grounds that these may\ncause the speech of creationists to receive an unsympathetic or\ndismissive reception. \n\nDworkin concedes that it is perhaps true that the right to freedom\nof speech, if it is to be meaningful, requires that everyone has some\nopportunity to have their ideas heard: a society in which only the rich\nand powerful have access to the media may be one in which there is not\ngenuine freedom of speech. But it goes far beyond this, Dworkin thinks,\nto claim that a meaningful right to freedom of speech requires “a\nguarantee of a sympathetic or even competent understanding of what one\nsays” (Dworkin 1993: 38). This would license state regulation of speech\non a massive scale, paving the way to terrible “tyranny” (Dworkin\n1993:42). \n\nA number of commentators have developed Mackinnon's claims in the\nface of Dworkin's response, arguing that freedom of speech (even\nnegative freedom of speech) requires more than simply being\nfree to produce and distribute word-like sounds and symbols. It also\nrequires at least that would-be hearers are not prevented from\ncomprehending the intended meaning of those sounds and\nscrawls-otherwise there is not free speech, merely the freedom\nto produce and distribute word-like sounds and scrawls. (See e.g.,\nHornsby and Langton 1998, West 2003. For replies see Jacobson 2001,\nGreen 1998.) In different ways, these commentators argue that the\ntraditional liberal conception of free speech, and of the right to free\nspeech, fails to pay sufficient attention to the way language works;\nand, in particular, to the way in which what words mean-and so what it\nis possible for speakers to say or communicate-depends on social\ncontext, a context that pornography may help to shape and\nperpetuate. \n\nThe traditional liberal conception of freedom of speech assumes that\npeople are free to speak just so long they are not prevented from\nproducing sounds and scrawls that others are not prevented from hearing\nor seeing. But we might wonder whether this sufficient to protect free\nspeech, even by liberals' own lights. For we might think that a\ngovernment that allowed people the freedom to produce whatever sounds\nand scrawls they like, but who implanted some device in the heads of\nhearers that systematically prevented would-be hearers from\ncomprehending the intended meaning of those sounds and scrawls, would\nbe just as bad as a government who prevented speakers from producing\nthe sounds and scrawls altogether. Either way, speakers are prevented\nfrom communicating their opinions to others, which defeats what\nliberals take to be the point of free speech: the right of speakers not\nto be prevented by the actions of other agents from communicating their\nideas or opinions to others who might wish to hear them (West\n2003). \n\nHow should the harm principle be understood? How should liberals\nconceptualise important values such as equality and the right to\nfreedom of speech? What role should the state play in protecting and\npromoting values such as autonomy and equality? Can liberal ideals be\nreconciled with feminist principles and goals? The search for answers\nto important questions such as these, accounts for much of the ongoing\nphilosophical interest in the question of pornography and\ncensorship.","contact.mail":"caroline.west@sydney.edu.au","contact.domain":"sydney.edu.au"}]
