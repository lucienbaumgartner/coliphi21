And, if she performed the movement, she might have done so\nintentionally or not. This short array of contrasts (and others like\nthem) has motivated questions about the nature, variety, and identity\nof action. Beyond the matter of her moving, when the person moves her\nhead, she may be indicating agreement or shaking an insect off her ear.\nShould we think of the consequences, conventional or causal, of\nphysical behavior as constituents of an action distinct from but\n‘generated by’ the movement? Or should we think that there\nis a single action describable in a host of ways? Also, actions, in\neven the most minimal sense, seem to be essentially\n‘active’. But how can we explain what this property\namounts to and defend our wavering intuitions about which events fall\nin the category of the ‘active’ and which do not?\n\n\n\nDonald Davidson [1980, essay 3] asserted that an action, in some\nbasic sense, is something an agent does that was ‘intentional\nunder some description,’ and many other philosophers have agreed\nwith him that there is a conceptual tie between genuine action, on the\none hand, and intention, on the other. However, it is tricky to\nexplicate the purported tie between the two concepts. First, the\nconcept of ‘intention’ has various conceptual inflections\nwhose connections to one another are not at all easy to delineate, and\nthere have been many attempts to map the relations between intentions\nfor the future, acting intentionally, and acting with a certain\nintention. Second, the notion that human behavior is often intentional\nunder one description but not under another is itself hard to pin down.\nFor example, as Davidson pointed out, an agent may intentionally cause\nhimself to trip, and the activity that caused the tripping may have\nbeen intentional under that description while, presumably, the foreseen\nbut involuntary tripping behavior that it caused is not supposed to be\nintentional under any heading. Nevertheless, both the tripping and its\nactive cause are required to make it true that the agent intentionally\ncaused himself to trip. Both occurrences fall equally, in that sense,\n‘under’ the operative description. So further clarification\nis called for.\n\n\n\nThere has been a notable or notorious debate about whether the agent's\nreasons in acting are causes of the action — a longstanding\ndebate about the character of our common sense explanations of\nactions.  Some philosophers have maintained that we explain why an\nagent acted as he did when we explicate how the agent's normative\nreasons rendered the action intelligible in his eyes. Others have\nstressed that the concept of ‘an intention with which a person\nacted’ has a teleological dimension that does not, in their\nview, reduce to the concept of ‘causal guidance by the agent's\nreasons.’ But the view that reason explanations are somehow\ncausal explanations remains the dominant position. Finally, recent\ndiscussions have revived interest in important questions about the\nnature of intention and its distinctiveness as a mental state, and\nabout the norms governing rational intending.\n\n\n\nIt has been common to motivate a central question about the nature of\naction by invoking an intuitive distinction between the things that\nmerely happen to people — the events they undergo\n— and the various things they genuinely do. The latter\nevents, the doings, are the acts or actions of the\nagent, and the problem about the nature of action is supposed to be:\nwhat distinguishes an action from a mere happening or occurrence? For\nsome time now, however, there has been a better appreciation of the\nvagaries of the verb ‘to do’ and a livelier sense that the\nquestion is not well framed. For instance, a person may cough, sneeze,\nblink, blush, and thrash about in a seizure, and these are all things\nthe person has, in some minimal sense, ‘done,’ although in\nthe usual cases, the agent will have been altogether passive\nthroughout these ‘doings.’ It is natural to protest that\nthis is not the sense of “do” the canny philosopher of\naction originally had in mind, but it is also not so easy to say just\nwhat sense that is. Moreover, as Harry Frankfurt [1978] has pointed\nout, the purposeful behavior of animals constitutes a low-level type\nof ‘active’ doing. When a spider walks across the table,\nthe spider directly controls the movements of his legs, and\nthey are directed at taking him from one location to another. Those\nvery movements have an aim or purpose for the spider, and hence they\nare subject to a kind of teleological explanation. Similarly, the\nidle, unnoticed movements of my fingers may have the goal of releasing\nthe candy wrapper from my grasp. All this behavioral activity\nis ‘action’ in some fairly weak sense. \n\nNevertheless, a great deal of human action has a richer\npsychological structure than this. An agent performs activity that is\ndirected at a goal, and commonly it is a goal the agent has adopted on\nthe basis of an overall practical assessment of his options and\nopportunities. Moreover, it is immediately available to the agent's\nawareness both that he is performing the activity in question and that\nthe activity is aimed by him at such-and-such a chosen end. At a still\nmore sophisticated conceptual level, Frankfurt [1988, 1999] has also\nargued that basic issues concerning freedom of action presuppose and\ngive weight to a concept of ‘acting on a desire with which the\nagent identifies.’ Under Frankfurt's influence on this\npoint, a good deal has been written to elucidate the nature of\n‘full-blooded’ human agency, whether the notion is finally\ndelineated either in Frankfurt's way or along different but related\nlines [see Velleman 2000, essay 6, Bratman 1999, essay 10]. Thus, there\nare different levels of action to be distinguished, and these include\nat least the following: unconscious and/or involuntary behavior,\npurposeful or goal directed activity (of Frankfurt's spider, for\ninstance), intentional action, and the autonomous acts or actions of\nself-consciously active human agents. Each of the key concepts in these\ncharacterizations raises some hard puzzles. \n\nIt is frequently noted that the agent has some sort of immediate\nawareness of his physical activity and of the goals that the\nactivity is aimed at realizing. In this connection, Elizabeth Anscombe\n[1963] spoke of ‘knowledge without observation.’ The agent\nknows ‘without observation’ that he is performing certain\nbodily movements (perhaps under some rough but non-negligible\ndescription), and he knows ‘without observation’ what\npurpose(s) the behavior is meant to serve [see also Falvey 2000].\nAnscombe's discussion of her claim is rich and suggestive, but her\nconception of ‘knowledge through observation’ is\nproblematic. Surely, one wants to say, proprioception and kinesthetic\nsensation play some role in informing the agent of the positions and\nmovements of his body, and it is uncertain why these informational\nroles should fail to count as modes of inner ‘observation’\nof the agent's own overt physical behavior. What Anscombe explicitly\ndenies is that agents generally know of the positions or movements of\ntheir own bodies by means of ‘separably describable\nsensations’ that serve as criteria for their judgements about the\nnarrowly physical performance of their bodies. However, when a person\nsees that there is a goldfinch in front of him, his knowledge is not\nderived as an inference from the ‘separably describable’\nvisual impressions he has in seeing the goldfinch, but this is an\ninstance of knowledge through observation nonetheless. In a related vein, David Velleman [1989] describes knowledge of\none’s present and incipient actions as ‘spontaneous’\n(knowledge that the agent has achieved without deriving it from\nevidence adequate to warrant it), and as ‘self-fulfilling’\n(expectations of acting that tend to produce actions of the kind\nexpected).  For Velleman, these expectations are themselves\nintentions, and they are chiefly derived by the agent through\npractical reasoning about what she is to perform.  Thus, Velleman is\nwhat Sarah Paul (2009) calls a Strong Cognitivist, i.e., someone\nwho identifies an intention with a certain pertinent belief\nabout what she is doing or about to do.  Setiya (2009) holds a similar\nview. A Weak Cognitivist, in Paul's terminology, is a theorist that\nholds that intentions to F are partially constituted by but\nare not identical with relevant beliefs that one will F.  For\ninstance, Paul Grice (1971) held that an intention to F\nconsisted in the agent’s ‘willing’ herself\nto F combined with a belief that she will actually F as a\nmore or less immediate consequence of her having so willed.  Because\nStrong Cognitivists maintain that the intention/beliefs of the agent\nare predominantly not based either on observation or evidence of any\nsort, and because they claim in addition that these states are\ncausally reliable in producing actions that validate their contents,\nsuch theorists believe that these intentions, when they have been\ncarried out, constitute a mode of ‘practical’ knowledge\nthat has not been derived from observation.  Weak Cognitivists can\nconstruct a similar story about how the agent's own actions can,\nin a plausible sense, be known without relying on observation.  However, it is not obvious that an agent’s knowledge of her\nintentional actions is not inferred from immediate knowledge\nof her own intentions.  Consider, to illustrate the line of thought,\nGrice's theory of intention and belief.  As noted above, he held a\nWeak Cognitivist view according to which an agent wills that\nhe Fs and derives from his awareness of willing that he will\nin fact F (or at least try to F) precisely because\nhe has willed to do so.  However, it seems plausible, as Sarah Paul\nargues at length in her 2009, that intentions to F, rightly\nunderstood, can take the place of the counterpart\n‘willings’ in Grice's account.  Thus, an agent, intending\nto F in the near future, and being immediately aware of so intending,\nforms inferentially the belief that she will F soon\n(or at least try to F) precisely because she has intended to\ndo so.  After all, the conditional, \nappears to be knowable a priori.  The belief that the agent\nthereby derives is, although it is inferred, not derived from\nobservation.  Paul labels this the “the inferentialist\naccount,” and it is not easily ruled out.  [See also Wilson 2000\nand Moran 2001.]  These puzzles about the nature of an agent's\nknowledge of her own intentional actions are thus closely intertwined\nwith questions about the nature of intention and about the nature of\nthe explanation of action.  In the final section, we address briefly\nsome further key issues that arise in this connection. \n\nIt is also important to the concept of ‘goal directed\naction’ that agents normally implement a kind of direct\ncontrol or guidance over their own behavior. An agent may guide her\nparalyzed left arm along a certain path by using her active right arm\nto shove it through the relevant trajectory. The moving of her right\narm, activated as it is by the normal exercise of her system of motor\ncontrol, is a genuine action, but the movement of her left arm is not.\nThat movement is merely the causal upshot of her guiding action, just\nas the onset of illumination in the light bulb is the mere effect of\nher action when she turned on the light. The agent has direct control\nover the movement of the right arm, but not over the movement of the\nleft. And yet it is hardly clear what ‘direct control of\nbehavior’ can amount to here. It does not simply mean that\nbehavior A, constituting a successful or attempted\nFing, was initiated and causally guided throughout its course\nby a present-directed intention to be Fing then. Even the\nexternally guided movement of the paralyzed left arm would seem to\nsatisfy a condition of this weak sort. Alfred Mele [1992] has suggested\nthat the intuitive ‘directness’ of the guidance of action\nA can partially be captured by stipulating that the\naction-guiding intention must trigger and sustain A\nproximally. In other words, it is stipulated that the agent's\npresent-directed intention to be Fing should govern action\nA, but not by producing some other prior or concurrent action\nA* that causally controls A in turn. But the proposal\nis dubious. On certain assumptions, most ordinary physical actions are\nliable to flunk this strengthened requirement. The normal voluntary\nmovements of an agent's limbs are caused by complicated contractions of\nsuitable muscles, and the muscle contractions, since they are aimed at\ncausing the agent's limbs to move, may themselves count as causally\nprior human actions. For instance, on Davidson's account of action they\nwill since the agent's muscle contracting is intentional under the\ndescription ‘doing something that causes the arm to move’\n[see Davidson 1980, essay 2]. Thus, the overt arm movement, in a normal\nact of voluntary arm moving, will have been causally guided by\na prior action, the muscle contracting, and consequently the causal\nguidance of the arm's movement will fail to be an instance of\n‘proximal’ causation at all [see Sehon 1998]. \n\nAs one might imagine, this conclusion depends upon how an act of\nmoving a part of one's body is to be conceived. Some philosophers\nmaintain that the movements of an agent's body are never actions. It is\nonly the agent's direct moving of, say, his leg that\nconstitutes a physical action; the leg movement is merely caused by\nand/or incorporated as a part of the act of moving [see Hornsby 1980].\nThis thesis re-opens the possibility that the causal guidance of the\nmoving of the agent's leg by the pertinent intention is\nproximal after all. The intention proximally governs the moving, if not\nthe movement, where the act of moving is now thought to start at the\nearliest, inner stage of act initiation. Still, this proposal is also\ncontroversial. For instance, J.L. Austin [1962] held that the\nstatement \n\nis ambiguous between (roughly)  \n\nand the more specific  \n\nIf Austin is right about this, then the nominalization “the\nagent's moving of his leg” should be correspondingly ambiguous,\nwith a second reading that denotes a certain leg movement, a movement\nthe agent has performed. Thus, no simple appeal to a putative\ndistinction between ‘movement’ and ‘moving’\nwill easily patch up the conception of ‘direct control of\naction’ under present scrutiny. \n\nIn any event, there is another well-known reason for doubting that\nthe ‘directness’ of an agent's governance of his own\nactions involves the condition of causal proximality — that an action\nis not to be controlled by still another action of the same agent. Some\nphilosophers believe that the agent's moving his leg is triggered and\nsustained by the agent's trying to move his leg in just that\nway, and that the efficacious trying is itself an action [see Hornsby\n1980, Ginet 1990, and O'Shaughnessy 1973, 1980]. If, in addition, the\nagent's act of leg moving is distinct from the trying, then, again, the\nmoving of the leg has not been caused proximally by the intention. The\ntruth or falsity of this third assumption is linked with a wider issue\nabout the individuation of action that has also been the subject of\nelaborate discussion. \n\nDonald Davidson [1980, essay 1], concurring with Anscombe, held\nthat \n\nIn Davidson's famous example, someone alerts a burglar by\nilluminating a room, which he does by turning on a light, which he does\nin turn by flipping the appropriate switch. According to the\nDavidson/Anscombe thesis above, the alerting of the burglar = the\nilluminating of the room = the turning on of the light = the flipping\nof the switch. And this is so despite the fact that the alerting of the\nburglar was unintentional while the flipping of the switch, the turning\non of the light, and the illuminating of the room were intentional.\nSuppose now that it is also true that the agent moved his leg\nby trying to move his leg in just that matter. Combined with\nthe Davidson/Anscombe thesis about act identification, this implies\nthat the agent's act of moving his leg = his act of trying to move that\nleg. So, perhaps the act of trying to move the leg doesn't cause the\nact of moving after all, since they are just the same. \n\nThe questions involved in these debates are potentially quite\nconfusing. First, it is important to distinguish between phrases\nlike \n\nand gerundive phrases such as  \n\nVery roughly, the expression (a) operates more like a\n‘that’ clause, viz. \n\nwhile the latter phrase appears to be a definite description,\ni.e., \n\nWhat is more, even when this distinction has been drawn, the\ndenotations of the gerundive phrases often remain ambiguous, especially\nwhen the verbs whose nominalizations appear in these phrases are\ncausatives. No one denies that there is an internally complex process\nthat is initiated by the agent's switch-flipping hand movement and that\nis terminated by the light's coming on as a result. This process\nincludes, but is not identical with, the act that initiates it and the\nevent that is its culminating upshot. Nevertheless, in a suitable\nconversational setting, the phrases (b) and (b′) can be properly\nused to designate any of the three events: the act that turned on the\nlight, the onset of illumination in the light, and whole process\nwhereby the light has come to be turned on. [For further discussion,\nsee Parsons 1990, Pietrofsky 2000, and Higginbotham 2000]. \n\nNow, the Davidson-Anscombe thesis plainly is concerned with the\nrelation between the agent's act of turning on the light, his\nact of flipping the switch, etc. But which configuration of\nevents, either prior to or contained within the extended causal process\nof turning on the light, really constitutes the agent's action? Some\nphilosophers have favored the overt arm movement the agent performs,\nsome favor the extended causal process he initiates, and some prefer\nthe relevant event of trying that precedes and ‘generates’\nthe rest. It has proved difficult to argue for one choice over another\nwithout simply begging the question against competing positions. As\nnoted before, Hornsby and other authors have pointed to the intuitive\ntruth of \n\nand they appeal to the Davidson-Anscombe thesis to argue that the act\nof moving the arm = the act of trying to move the arm. On\nthis view, the act of trying — which is the act of\nmoving — causes a movement of the arm in much the same way that\nan act of moving the arm causes the onset of illumination in the\nlight. Both the onset of illumination and the overt arm movement are\nsimply causal consequences of the act itself, the act of trying to\nmove his arm in just this way. Further, in light of the apparent\nimmediacy and strong first person authority of agents' judgements that\nthey have tried to do a certain thing, it appears that acts of trying\nare intrinsically mental acts. So, a distinctive type of mental act\nstands as the causal source of the bodily behavior that validates\nvarious physical re-descriptions of the act. \n\nAnd yet none of this seems inevitable. It is arguable that \n\nsimply means, as a first approximation at least, that \n\nMoreover, when (4) or (4′) is true, then the something the\nagent did that was directed at turning on the light will have been some\nother causally prior action, the act of flipping the switch, for\nexample. If this is true of trying to perform basic acts (e.g., moving\none's own arm) as well as non-basic, instrumental acts, then trying to\nmove one's arm may be nothing more than doing something directed at\nmaking one's arm move. In this case, the something which was done may\nsimply consist in the contracting of the agent's muscles. Or, perhaps,\nif we focus on the classic case of the person whose arm, unknown to\nher, is paralyzed, then the trying in that case (and perhaps in all)\nmay be nothing more than the activation of certain neural systems in\nthe brain. Of course, most agents are not aware that they are\ninitiating appropriate neural activity, but they are aware of\ndoing something that is meant to make their arms move. And, in point of\nfact, it may well be that the something of which they are aware as a\ncausing of the arm movement just is the neural activity in the brain.\nFrom this perspective, ‘trying to F’ does not name\na natural kind of mental act that ordinarily sets off a train of\nfitting physical responses. Rather, it gives us a way of describing\nactions in terms of a goal aimed at in the behavior without committing\nus as to whether the goal was realized or not. It also carries no\ncommitment, \n\nBy contrast, it is a familiar doctrine that what the agent does, in\nthe first instance, in order to cause his arm to move is to form a\ndistinctive mental occurrence whose intrinsic psychological nature and\ncontent is immediately available to introspection. The agent\nwills his arm to move or produces a volition that his\narm is to move, and it is this mental willing or volition that is aimed\nat causing his arm to move. Just as an attempt to turn on the light may\nbe constituted by the agent's flipping of the switch, so also, in\nstandard cases, trying to move his arm is constituted by the agent's\nwilling his arm to move. For traditional ‘volitionalism,’\nwillings, volitions, basic tryings are, in Brian O'Shaughnessy's apt\nformulation, ‘primitive elements of animal\n consciousness.’[1]\n They are elements of consciousness in which\nthe agent has played an active role, and occurrences that normally have\nthe power of producing the bodily movements they represent.\nNevertheless, it is one thing to grant that, in trying to move one's\nbody, there is some ‘inner’ activity that is meant to\ninitiate an envisaged bodily movement. It is quite another matter to\nargue successfully that the initiating activity has the particular\nmentalistic attributes that volitionalism has characteristically ascribed\nto acts of willing. \n\nIt is also a further question whether there is only a\nsingle action, bodily or otherwise, that is performed along\nthe causal route that begins with trying to move and terminates with a\nmovement of the chosen type. One possibility, adverted to above, is\nthat there is a whole causal chain of actions that is\nimplicated in the performance of even the simplest physical act of\nmoving a part of one's body. If, for example, ‘action’ is\ngoal-directed behavior, then the initiating neural activity, the\nresulting muscle contractions, and the overt movement of the arm may\nall be actions on their own, with each member in the line-up\ncausing every subsequent member, and with all of these actions causing\nan eventual switch flipping somewhere further down the causal chain. On\nthis approach, there may be nothing which is the act of\nflipping the switch or of turning on the light, because each causal\nlink is now an act which flipped the switch and (thereby) turned on the\nlight [see Wilson 1989]. Nevertheless, there still will be a single\novert action that made the switch flip, the light turn on, and\nthe burglar become alert, i.e., the overt movement of the agent's hand\nand arm. In this sense, the proposal supports a modified version of the\nDavidson/Anscombe thesis. \n\nHowever, all of this discussion suppresses a basic metaphysical\nmystery. In the preceding two paragraphs, it has been proposed that the\nneural activity, the muscle contractions, and the overt hand movements\nmay all be actions, while the switch's flipping on, the light's coming\non, and the burglar's becoming alert are simply happenings outside the\nagent, the mere effects of the agent's overt action. As we have seen,\nthere is plenty of disagreement about where basic agency starts and\nstops, whether within the agent's body or somewhere on its surface.\nThere is less disagreement that the effects of bodily movement beyond\nthe body, e.g., the switch's flipping on, the onset of illumination in\nthe room, and so on, are not, by themselves at least, purposeful\nactions. Still, what could conceivably rationalize any set of\ndiscriminations between action and non-action as one traces along the\npertinent complex causal chains from the initial mind or brain\nactivity, through the bodily behavior, to the occurrences produced in\nthe agent's wider environment? \n\nPerhaps, one wants to say, as suggested above, that the agent has a\ncertain kind of direct (motor) control over the goal-seeking behavior\nof his own body. In virtue of that fundamental biological capacity, his\nbodily activity, both inner and overt, is governed by him and directed\nat relevant objectives. Inner physical activity causes and is aimed at\ncausing the overt arm movements and, in turn, those movements cause and\nare aimed at causing the switch to flip, the light to go on, and the\nroom to become illuminated. Emphasizing considerations of this sort,\none might urge that they validate the restriction of action to events\nin or at the agent's body. And yet, the stubborn fact remains that the\nagent also does have a certain ‘control’ over what happens\nto the switch, the light, and even over the burglar's state of mind. It\nis a goal for the agent of the switch's flipping on that it turn on the\nlight, a goal for the agent of the onset of illumination in the room\nthat it render the room space visible, etc. Hence, the basis of any\ndiscrimination between minimal agency and non-active consequences\nwithin the extended causal chains will have to rest on some special\nfeature of the person's guidance: the supposed ‘directness’\nof the motor control, the immediacy or relative certainty of the\nagent's expectations about actions vs. results, or facts concerning the\nspecial status of the agent's living body. The earlier remarks in this\nsection hint at the serious difficulty of seeing how any such routes\nare likely to provide a rationale for grounding the requisite\nmetaphysical distinction(s). \n\nAnscombe opened her monograph Intention by noting that the\nconcept of ‘intention’ figures in each of the\nconstructions: (5) The agent intends to G; (6) The agent G'd intentionally; and (7) The agent F'd with the intention of\nGing, \n\nFor that matter, one could add \n\nAlthough (7) and (7′) are closely related, they seem not to\nsay quite the same thing. For example, although it may be true that \n\nit normally won't be true that \n\nDespite the differences between them, we will call instances of (7)\nand (7′) ascriptions of intention in\n action.[2]\n These\nsentential forms represent familiar, succinct ways of\nexplaining action. A specification of the intention with which\nan agent acted or the intention that the agent had in acting provides a\ncommon type of explanation of why the agent acted as he did. This\nobservation will be examined at some length in Section 3. \n\nStatements of form (5) are ascriptions of intention for the\nfuture, although, as a special case, they include ascriptions of\npresent-directed intentions, i.e., the agent's intention to be\nGing now. Statements of form 6), ascriptions of\nacting intentionally, bear close connections to corresponding\ninstances of (7). As a first approximation at least, it is plausible\nthat (6) is true just in case \n\nHowever, several authors have questioned whether such a simple\nequivalence captures the special complexities of what it is to\nG\n intentionally.[3]\n Here is an example adapted from Davidson\n[1980, essay 4]. Suppose that Betty kills Jughead, and she does so with\nthe intention of killing him. And yet suppose also that her intention\nis realized only by a wholly unexpected accident. The bullet she fires\nmisses Jughead by a mile, but it dislodges a tree branch above his head\nand releases a swarm of hornets that attack him and sting him until he\ndies. In this case, it is at least dubious that, in this manner, Betty\nhas killed Jughead intentionally. (It is equally doubtful that\nBetty killed him unintentionally either.) Or suppose that\nReggie wins the lottery, and having bizarre illusions about his ability\nto control which ticket will win, he enters the lottery and wins it\nwith the intention of winning it [Mele 1997]. The first example\nsuggests that there needs to be some condition added to (6′) that\nsays the agent succeeded in Ging in a manner sufficiently in\naccordance with whatever plan she had for Ging as she acted.\nThe second suggests that the agent's success in Ging must\nresult from her competent exercise of the relevant skills, and it must\nnot depend too much on sheer luck, whether the luck has been foreseen\nor not. Various other examples have prompted additional emendations and\nqualifications [see Harman 1976]. \n\nThere are still more fundamental issues about intentions in action\nand how they are related to intentions directed at the present and the\nimmediate future. In “Actions, Reasons, and Causes,”\nDavidson seemed to suppose that ascriptions of intention in action\nreduce to something like the following. \n\n(In Davidson's widely used phrase, the pro-attitude and associated\nmeans-end belief constitute a primary reason for the agent to\nF.) In this account of ‘acting with an intention’\nthere is, by design, no mention of a distinctive state of intending.\nDavidson, at the time of this early paper, seemed to favor a reductive\ntreatment of intentions, including intentions for the future, in terms\nof pro-attitudes, associated beliefs, and other potential mental causes\nof action. In any case, Davidson's approach to intention in action was\ndistinctly at odds with the view Anscombe had adopted in\nIntention. She stressed the fact that constructions like (7)\nand (7′) supply commonsense explanations of why the agent\nF'd, and she insisted that the explanations in question do not\ncite the agent's reasons as causes of the action. Thus, she implicitly\nrejected anything like (7*), the causal analysis of ‘acting with\na certain intention’ that Davidson apparently endorsed. On the\nother hand, it was less than clear from her discussion how it is that\nintentions give rise to an alternative mode of action explanation. \n\nDavidson's causal analysis is modified in his later article\n“Intending” [1980, essay 5]. By the time of this essay, he\ndropped the view that there is no primitive state of intending.\nIntentions are now accepted as irreducible, and the category of\nintentions is distinguished from the broad, diverse category that\nincludes the various pro-attitudes. In particular, he identifies\nintentions for the future with the agent's all-out judgments\n(evaluations) of what she is to do. Although there is some lack of\nclarity about the specific character of these practical\n‘all-out’ judgements, they play an important role in\nDavidson's overall theory of action, particularly in his striking\naccount of weakness of will [1980, essay 2]. Despite his altered\noutlook on intentions, however, Davidson does not give up the chief\nlines of his causal account of intentions in action — of what it\nis to act with a certain intention. In the modified version, \n\n(7**) The agent's primary reason for Ging must cause her,\nin the right way, to intend to G, and her intending to\nG must itself cause, again in the right way, the agent's\nparticular act of\n Fing.[4] \n\nThe interpolated, albeit vague, conditions that require causation in\n‘the right way’ are meant to cover well-known\ncounterexamples that depend upon deviant causal chains occurring\neither in the course of the agent's practical reasoning or in the\nexecution of his intentions. Here is one familiar type of example. A\nwaiter intends to startle his boss by knocking over a stack of glasses\nin their vicinity, but the imminent prospect of alarming his irascible\nemployer unsettles the waiter so badly that he involuntarily staggers\ninto the stack and knocks the glasses over. Despite the causal role of\nthe waiter's intention to knock over the glass, he doesn't do this\nintentionally. In this example, where the deviant causation occurs as\npart of the performance of the physical behavior itself, we have what\nis known as ‘primary causal deviance.’ When the deviant\ncausation occurs on the path between the behavior and its intended\nfurther effects — as in the example of Betty and Jughead above\n— the deviance is said to be ‘secondary.’ There have\nbeen many attempts by proponents of a causal analysis of intention in\naction (‘causalists,’ in the terminology of von Wright\n1971) to spell out what ‘the right kind(s)’ of causation\nmight be, but with little agreement about their success [see Bishop\n1989, Mele 1997]. Some other causalists, including Davidson, maintain\nthat no armchair analysis of this matter is either possible or\nrequired.  However, most causalists agree with Davidson's later view\nthat the concept of ‘present directed intention’ is needed\nin any plausible causal account of intention in action and acting\nintentionally. It is, after all, the present directed intention that\nis supposed to guide causally the ongoing activity of the agent [see\nalso Searle 1983]. \n\nThe simplest version of such an account depends on what Michael\nBratman has dubbed “the Simple View.” This is the thesis\nthat proposition (6) above, [The agent G'd intentionally]\nand, correspondingly, proposition (7) [The agent Fed with the\nintention of Ging] entail that, at the time of action, the\nagent intended to G. Surely, from the causalist point of\nview, the most natural account of Ging intentionally is that\nthe action of Ging is governed by a present directed\nintention whose content for the agent is, “I am Ging\nnow.” So the causalist's natural account presupposes the Simple\nView, but Bratman [1984, 1987] has presented a well-known example to\nshow that the Simple View is false. He describes a type of case in\nwhich the agent wants either to φ or to Θ, without having\nany significant preference between the two alternatives. The agent\ndoes know, however, that it is flatly impossible, in the given\ncircumstances, for him to both φ and Θ although, in\nthese same circumstances, it is open to him to try to φ\nand try to Θ concurrently.  (Perhaps, in trying to φ, he\ndoes something with one hand, and, in trying to Θ, he does\nsomething with the other.) Believing that such a two-pronged strategy\nof trying to achieve each goal maximizes his chances of achieving his\nactual goal of either φing or Θing, the agent actively aims\nat both of the subordinate ends, trying to accomplish one or the\nother. The example can be spelled out in such a way that it seems\nclear that the agent is wholly rational, in his actions and attitudes,\nas he knowingly pursues this bifurcated attack on his disjunctive goal\n(but see Yaffe 2010 for skepticism about this claim). Suppose now that\nthe agent actually succeeds in, say, φing and that he succeeds in\nvirtue of his skill and insight, and not through some silly\naccident. So, the agent φ's intentionally.  It follows from the\nSimple View that the agent intended to φ.  And yet, the agent was\nalso doing something with the intention of Θing and had this\nattempt succeeded instead (without the intervention of too much luck),\nthen the agent would have Θ'd intentionally. By a second\napplication of the Simple View, it follows that he also intended to\nΘ.  And yet, just as it is irrational to intend to φ while\nbelieving that it is flatly impossible for him to φ, so also does\nit seem irrational to have an intention to φ and an\nintention to Θ, while believing that it is flatly impossible to\ndo the two things together. So the agent here should be open to\ncriticisms of irrationality in his endeavor to φ or Θ.\nNevertheless, we observed at the outset that he is not. The only way\nout is to block the conclusion that, in trying to φ and trying to\nΘ in these circumstances, the agent has the contextually\nirrational pair of intentions, and rejecting the Simple View is the\nmost direct manner of blocking that conclusion. \n\nEven if Bratman's argument defeats the Simple View [see McCann 1986,\nKnobe 2006], it doesn't rule out some type of causal analysis of\nacting intentionally; it doesn't even rule out such an analysis that\ntakes the crucial controlling cause to be an intention in every\ninstance. One might suppose, for example, that (i) in a Bratman case,\nthe agent merely intends to try to φ and intends to\ntry to Θ, and that (ii) it is these intentions that\ndrive the agent's actions [Mele 1997]. The analysis in (7**) would be\nmodified accordingly. However, the project of finding a workable and\nnon-circular emendation of (7**) remains an open question. \n\nThe conceptual situation is complicated by the fact that Bratman\nholds that (7) [The agent F'd with the intention of\nGing] is ambiguous between \n\nand \n\n(8) above is an especially clear example in which the second reading\nis required. The second reading does entail that the agent intends to\nF, and it is only the first that, according to Bratman's\nargument, does not. Therefore, Bratman thinks that we need to\ndistinguish intention as an aim or goal of actions and intention as a\ndistinctive state of commitment to future action, a state that results\nfrom and subsequently constrains our practical endeavors as planning\nagents. It can be rational to aim at a pair of ends one knows to be\njointly unrealizable, because aiming at both may be the best way to\nrealize one or the other. However, it is not rational to plan on\naccomplishing both of two objectives, known to be incompatible, since\nintentions that figure in rational planning should agglomerate, i.e.,\nshould fit together in a coherent larger plan. Bratman's example and\nthe various critical discussions of it have stimulated interest in the\nidea of the rationality of intentions, measured against\nthe backdrop of the agent's beliefs and suppositions. We discuss some\nof these issues at greater length in Section 4.  \n\nIt has been mentioned earlier that Davidson came to identify\nintentions for the future with all out judgements about what the agent\nis to be doing now or should do in the relevant future. Velleman\n[1989], by contrast, identifies an intention with the agent's\nspontaneous belief, derived from practical reflection, which says that\nhe is presently doing a certain act (or that he will do such an act in\nthe future), and that his act is (or will be) performed precisely as a\nconsequence of his acceptance of this self-referential belief. Paul\nGrice [1971] favored a closely related view in which intention consists\nin the agent's willing that certain results ensue, combined with the\nbelief that they will ensue as a consequence of the particular willing\nin question. Hector-Neri Castañeda [1975], influenced by Sellars\n[1966] maintained that intentions are a special species of internal\nself-command, which he calls “practitions.” Bratman [1987]\ndevelops a functionalist account of intention: it is the psychological\nstate that plays a certain kind of characteristic causal role in our\npractical reasoning, in our planning for the future, and in the\ncarrying out of our actions. This causal role, he argues, is distinct\nfrom the characteristic causal or functional roles of expectations,\ndesires, hopes, and other attitudes about the agent's future\nactions. Castañeda's views on intention are distinctive, and they\ndeserve greater attention than they have recently received.  For\ninstance, he holds that intentions and beliefs are structurally\nparallel in the following key respect.  Both involve the endorsing of\nan appropriate type of structured content.  When a person believes\nthat P, she endorses or accepts the proposition that\nP; when a person intends to F, she endorses\nor accepts the practition, ‘I [am]\nto F.’ Roughly a practition ascribes an action property\nF to an agent, but the ascription involves a distinctive type of\npredication that essentially carries some kind of imperative force.\nOrders, commands, and requests all have practitions as their contents\nas well, but, as a rule, these will represent prescriptions directed\nat others.  They express the content, e.g., ‘You [are] to\nF.’ An intention is, by contrast, self-directed, but it\nis not only that the intended practition is self-directed in this\nsense; in intending the agent conceives of himself under a\ndistinctively ‘first person’ conception.  Other\nphilosophers, e.g., Hare [1971] and Kenny [1973] have likened\nintentions to self-directed commands. Still others, notably Annette\nBair [1970], have wanted to construe the logical objects of intending\nas non-propositional and as represented by an unmodified infinitive.\nVersions of both of these ideas are worked out more carefully and\nextensively in some of Castañeda's key writings on action.\nCastaneda was concerned to assign a systematic semantics to the chief\nlocutions that figure in practical thinking and reasoning.  These\ninclude ascriptions of belief and ascriptions of intention, but they\nalso include the varieties of ‘ought’ statements that make\nexplicit the normative character of practical reflection.  It was a\nchief ambition in his investigations to chart out the structure of\nimplicative relations that hold between propositions and practitions\nof these varied sorts and thereby to elaborate the conceptual\nfoundations of deontic logic. (For a rich exegesis of Castañeda\non action see essay 12 in Bratman 1999.) \n\nIndividuals do not always act alone. They may also share intentions\nand act in concert. There has been growing interest in the philosophy\nof action about how shared intention and action should be\nunderstood. A central concern is whether the sharing of intentions\nshould be given a reductive account in terms of individual agency (see\nSearle 1990 for an important early discussion of the issue). Michael\nBratman [1992] offers an influential proposal in a reductive vein that\nmakes use of his planning conception of intentions. A central\ncondition in his account of shared cooperative activity is that each\nparticipant individually intends the activity and pursues it in\naccordance with plans and subplans that do not conflict with those of\nthe other participants. But Margaret Gilbert [2000] has objected that\nreductive approaches overlook the mutual obligations between\nparticipants essential to shared activity: each participant is\nobligated to the others to do his or her share of the activity, and\nunilateral withdrawal constitutes a violation of this obligation.\nGilbert argues that a satisfactory account of these mutual obligations\nrequires that we give up reductive individualist accounts of shared\nactivity and posit a primitive notion of joint commitment (see also\nTuomela, 2003). \n\nRoth [2004] takes seriously the mutual obligations identified by Gilbert,\nand offers an account that, while non-reductive, nevertheless invokes a\nconception of intention and commitment that in some respects is\nfriendlier to that invoked by Bratman. It is not entirely clear\nwhether, in positing primitive joint commitments, Gilbert means to\ncommit herself to the ontological thesis that there exist group agents\nover and above the constituent individual agents. Pettit [2003] defends just\nsuch a thesis. He argues that rational group action often involves the\n“collectivizing of reason,” with participants acting in\nways that are not rationally recommended from the participant's\nindividual point of view. The resulting discontinuity between\nindividual and collective perspectives suggests, on his view, that\ngroups can be rational, intentional agents distinct from their\nmembers. \n\nFor many years, the most intensely debated topic in the philosophy of\naction concerned the explanation of intentional actions in terms of\nthe agent's reasons for acting. As stated previously, Davidson and\nother action theorists defended the position that reason explanations\nare causal explanations — explanations that cite the agent's\ndesires, intentions, and means-end beliefs as causes of the action\n[see Goldman 1970]. These causalists about the explanation of action\nwere reacting against a neo-Wittgensteinian outlook that claimed\notherwise. In retrospect, the very terms in which the debate was\nconducted were flawed. First, for the most part, the non-causalist\nposition relied chiefly on negative arguments that purported to show\nthat, for conceptual reasons, motivating reasons could not be causes\nof action.  Davidson did a great deal to rebut these arguments. It was\ndifficult, moreover, to find a reasonably clear account of what sort\nof non-causal explanation the neo-Wittgensteinians had in\nmind. Charles Taylor, in his book The Explanation of Action\n[1964], wound up claiming that reason explanations are grounded in a\nkind of ‘non-causal bringing about,’ but neither Taylor\nnor anyone else ever explained how any bringing about of an event\ncould fail to be causal.  Second, the circumstances of the debate were\nnot improved by the loose behavior of the ordinary concept of ‘a\ncause.’ When someone says that John has cause to be offended by\nJane's truculent behavior, then “cause” in this setting\njust means ‘reason,’ and the statement, “John was\ncaused to seek revenge by his anger,” may means nothing more\nthan, “John's anger was among the reasons for which he sought\nrevenge.” If so, then presumably no one denies that reasons are\nin some sense causes. In the pertinent literature, it has\nbeen common to fall back on the qualified claim that reasons are not\n‘efficient’ or ‘Humean’ or\n‘producing’ causes of action.  Unfortunately, the import\nof these qualifications has been less than perspicuous. \n\nGeorge Wilson [1989] and Carl Ginet [1990] follow Anscombe in\nholding that reason explanations are distinctively grounded in an\nagent's intentions in action. Both authors hold that ascriptions of\nintention in action have the force of propositions that say of\na particular act of Fing that it was intended by its agent to\nG (by means of Fing), and they claim that such de\nre propositions constitute non-causal reason explanations of why\nthe agent Fed on the designated occasion. Wilson goes beyond\nGinet in claiming that statements of intention in action have the\nmeaning of \n\nIn this analyzed form, the teleological character of ascriptions of\nintention in action is made explicit. Given the goal-directed nature of\naction, one can provide a familiar kind of teleological explanation of\nthe relevant behavior by mentioning a goal or purpose of the behavior\nfor the agent at the time, and this is the information (9) conveys. Or,\nalternatively, when a speaker explains that \n\nthe agent's desire to G is cited in the explanation, not as\na cause of the Fing, but rather as indicating a desired goal\nor end at which the act of Fing came to be directed. \n\nMost causalists will allow that reason explanations of action are\nteleological but contend that teleological explanations in terms of\ngoals — purposive explanations in other words — are\nthemselves analyzable as causal explanations in which the agent's\nprimary reason(s) for Fing are specified as guiding causes of\nthe act of Fing. Therefore, just as there are causalist\nanalyses of what it is to do something intentionally, so there are\nsimilar counterpart analyses of teleological explanations of goal\ndirected and, more narrowly, intentional action. The causalist about\nteleological explanation maintains that the goal of the behavior for\nthe agent just is a goal the agent had at the time, one that caused\nthe behavior and, of course, one that caused it in the right way [for\ncriticism, see Sehon 1998, 2005]. \n\nIt has not been easy to see how these disagreements are to be\nadjudicated. The claim that purposive explanations do or do not\nreduce to suitable counterpart causal explanations is\nsurprisingly elusive. It is not clear, in the first place, what it is\nfor one form of explanation to reduce to another. Moreover, as\nindicated above, Davidson himself has insisted that it is not possible\nto give an explicit, reductive account of what ‘the right kind\nof causing’ is supposed to be and that none is\nneeded. Naturally, he may simply be right about this, but others have\nfelt that causalism about reason explanations is illicitly protected\nby endemic fuzziness in the concept of ‘causation of the right\nkind.’ Some causalists who otherwise agree with Davidson have\naccepted the demand for a more detailed and explicit account, and some\nof the proposed accounts get extremely complicated. Without better\nagreement about the concept of ‘cause’ itself, the\nprospects for a resolution of the debate do not appear\ncheerful. Finally, Abraham Roth [2000] has pointed out that reasons\nexplanations might both be irreducibly teleological and also\ncite primary reasons as efficient causes at the same time. It is\narguable that similar explanations, having both causal and\nteleological force, figure already in specifically homeostatic\n(feedback) explanations of certain biological phenomena. When we\nexplain that the organism Ved because it needed\nW, we may well be explaining both that the goal of the\nVing was to satisfy the need for W and that\nit was the need for W that triggered the Ving. In a recent article, Brian McLaughlin (2012) agrees that reason\nexplanations are teleological, explaining an action in terms of a\npurpose, goal or aim for which it was performed.  He also agrees that\nthese purposive explanations are not species of causal explanation.\nHowever, he rejects the view that these same explanations are grounded\non claims about the agent's intentions in acting, and he thereby sets\naside the issues, sketched above, about purpose, intention, and their\nrole in rationalizations.  McLaughlin takes the following position: if\n(i) an agent F-ed for the purpose of G-ing, then,\n(ii) in F-ing, the agent was thereby trying to G.\nTo assert (i) is to offer an explanation of the action\n(the F-ing) in terms of the agent's trying\nto G. Moreover, if (i) is true then the act of F-ing\nis identical with or is a proper part of the agent's attempt\nto G.  Thus, statement (ii) offers what purports to be, in\neffect, a mere redescription of the act of F-ing.  Assuming\nHume's maxim that if an event E causes an\nevent E′, then E and E′ must be\nwholly distinct, McLaughlin maintains that purposive explanations of\nactions are constitutive and not causal in character. \nMichael Thompson has defended a position that makes a rather radical\nbreak from the familiar post-Davidson views on the explanation of\naction. He rejects as misconceived the debates between causalist and\nnon-causalist accounts of explaining action.  He does not deny that\nactions are sometimes explained by appeal to wants, intentions, and\nattempts, but he thinks that the nature of these explanations is\nradically misunderstood in standard theorizing.  He thinks that\ndesires, intentions, and attempts are not ‘propositional\nattitudes,’ as they are usually understood, and the\n‘sophisticated’ explanations that appeal to them are\nsecondary to and conceptually parasitic upon what he calls\n‘naïve action explanations.’ The naïve\nexplanations are given in statements in which one action is explained\nby mentioning another, e.g., “I am breaking an egg because\nI’m making an omelet.” It is a part of the force of these\nexplanations that the explanandum (the egg breaking) is present as\npart of a broader, unfolding action or activity (the explanans: the\nomelet making). Similarly, “I am breaking a egg because I'm\ntrying to make an omelet,” the explanans (the trying) is itself\nan action, under a certain description, that incorporates the breaking\nof the egg.  Kindred forms such as ‘A is F-ing\nbecause he wants to G’ and ‘A\nis F-ing because he intends to G’ are held to give\nexplanations that fall in ‘the same categorical space’ as\nthe naïve action explanations.  Thompson's overall position\nis novel, complex, and highly nuanced.  It is sometimes elusive, and\nit is certainly not easy to summarize briefly.  Nevertheless, it is a\nrecent approach that has rapidly been drawing growing interest and\nsupport. \n\nOne of the principal arguments that was used to show that reason\nexplanations of action could not be causal was the following. If the\nagent's explaining reasons R were among the causes of his\naction A, then there must be some universal causal law which\nnomologically links the psychological factors in R (together\nwith other relevant conditions) to the A-type action that they\nrationalize. However, it was argued, there simply are no such\npsychological laws; there are no strict laws and co-ordinate conditions\nthat ensure that a suitable action will be the invariant product of the\ncombined presence of pertinent pro-attitudes, beliefs, and other\npsychological states. Therefore, reasons can't be causes. In\n“Actions, Reasons, and, Causes,” Davidson first pointed out\nthat the thesis that there are no reason-to-action laws is crucially\nambiguous between a stronger and a weaker reading, and he observes that\nit is the stronger version that is required for the non-causalist\nconclusion. The weaker reading says that there are no reason-to-action\nlaws in which the antecedent is formulated in terms of the\n‘belief/desire/intention’ vocabulary of commonsense\npsychology and the consequent is stated in terms of goal directed and\nintentional action. Davidson accepted that the thesis, on this reading,\nis correct, and he has continued to accept it ever since. The stronger\nreading says that there are no reason-to-action laws in any guise,\nincluding laws in which the psychological states and events are\nre-described in narrowly physical terms and the actions are\nre-described as bare movement. Davidson affirms that there are\nlaws of this second variety, whether we have discovered them or\n not.[5] \n\nMany have felt that this position only lands Davidson (qua\ncausalist) in deeper trouble. It is not simply that we suppose that\nstates of having certain pro-attitudes and of having corresponding\nmeans-end beliefs are among the causes of our actions. We suppose\nfurther that the agent did what he did because the having of the\npro-attitude and belief were states with (respectively) a conative and\na cognitive nature, and even more importantly, they are psychological\nstates with certain propositional contents. The specific character of\nthe causation of the action depended crucially on the fact that these\npsychological states had ‘the direction of fit’ and the\npropositional contents that they did. The agent F'ed at a\ngiven time, we think, because, at that time, he had a desire that\nrepresented Fing, and not some other act, as worthwhile or\notherwise attractive to him. \n\nFred Dretske [1988] gave a famous example in this connection. When the\nsoprano's singing of the aria shatters the glass, it will have been\nfacts about the acoustic properties of the singing that were relevant\nto the breaking. The breaking does not depend upon the fact\nthat she was singing lyrics and that those lyrics expressed\nsuch-and-such a content. We therefore expect that it will be the\nacoustic properties, and not the ‘content’ properties that\nfigure in the pertinent explanatory laws. In the case of action, by\ncontrast, we believe that the contents of the agent's attitudes\nare causally relevant to behavior. The contents of the\nagent's desires and beliefs not only help justify the action that is\nperformed but, according to causalists at least, they play a causal\nrole in determining the actions the agent was motivated to attempt. It\nhas been difficult to see how Davidson, rejecting laws of mental\ncontent as he does, is in any position to accommodate the intuitive\ncounterfactual dependence of action on the content of the agent's\nmotivating reasons.  His theory seems to offer no explication\nwhatsoever of the fundamental role of mental content in reason\nexplanations. Nevertheless, it should be admitted that no one really\nhas a very good theory of how mental content plays its role. An\nenormous amount of research has been conducted to explicate what it is\nfor propositional attitudes, realized as states of the nervous system,\nto express propositional contents at all. Without some better\nconsensus on this enormous topic, we are not likely to get far on the\nquestion of mental causation, and solid progress on the attribution of\ncontent may still leave it murky how the contents of attitudes can be\namong the causal factors that produce behavior. \n\nIn a fairly early phase of the debate over the causal status of\nreasons for action, Norman Malcolm [1968] and Charles Taylor [1964]\ndefended the thesis that ordinary reason explanations stand in\npotential rivalry with the explanations of human and animal behavior\nthe neural sciences can be expected to provide. More recently, Jaegwon\nKim [1989] has revived this issue in a more general way, seeing the\ntwo modes of explanation as joint instances of a Principle of\nExplanatory Exclusion. That Principle tells us that, if there exist\ntwo ‘complete’ and ‘independent’ explanations\nof the same event or phenomenon, then one or the other of these\nalternative explanations must be wrong. Influenced by Davidson, many\nphilosophers reject more than just reason-to-action laws. They\nbelieve, more generally, that there are no laws that connect the\nreason-giving attitudes with any material states, events, and\nprocesses, under purely physical descriptions. As a consequence,\ncommonsense psychology is not strictly reducible to the neural\nsciences, and this means that reason explanations of action and\ncorresponding neural explanations are, in the intended sense,\n‘independent’ of one another. But, detailed causal\nexplanations of behavior in terms of neural factors should also be,\nagain in the intended sense, ‘complete.’ Hence,\nExplanatory Exclusion affirms that either the reason explanations or\nthe prospective neural explanations must be abandoned as\nincorrect. Since we are not likely to renege upon our best, most\nworked-out scientific accounts, it is the ultimate viability of the\nreason explanations from commonsense ‘vernacular’\npsychology that appear to be threatened. The issues here are\ncomplicated and controversial — particularly issues about the\nproper understanding of ‘theoretical reduction.’ However,\nif Explanatory Exclusion applies to reason explanations of action,\nconstrued as causal, we have a very general incentive for searching\nfor a workable philosophical account of reason explanations that\nconstrues them as non-causal. Just as certain function explanations in\nbiology may not reduce to, but also certainly do not compete with,\nrelated causal explanations in molecular biology, so also non-causal\nreason explanations could be expected to co-exist with neural analyses\nof the causes of behavior. \n\nEarlier we introduced the Cognitivist view that intentions are\nspecial kinds of beliefs, and that, consequently, practical reasoning\nis a special form of theoretical reasoning. Some theorists of action\nhave been attracted to Cognitivism because of its promise to vindicate\nAnscombe’s (admittedly controversial) claim that, in acting\nintentionally, we have knowledge of what we’re doing that we do\nnot get by observation. But an opposing tradition has been at least as\nequally prominent in the last twenty-five years of thinking about the\nnature of intention. Philosophers in this tradition have turned their\nattention to the project of giving an account of intention that\ncaptures the fact that intentions are distinctive mental\nstates, states which play unique roles in psychological explanations\nand which are subject to their own sorts of normative requirements. \n\nThis project of articulating the distinctive nature of intention was\ninfluentially undertaken in Michael Bratman’s Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason (1987), partially as a response to the\nreductive view, which had once been endorsed by the early Davidson,\naccording to which intentions could be analyzed as complexes of beliefs\nand desires. Much contemporary work on normativity and moral psychology\ncan be seen as flowing from Bratman’s central (purported) insight\nabout the distinctive nature of intention. \n\nOn the simple desire-belief model, an intention is a combination of\ndesire-belief states, and an action is intentional in virtue of\nstanding in the appropriate relation to these simpler states. For\nexample, to say that someone intentionally turns on the air conditioner\nis just to explain her action by appealing to (e.g.) a desire to turn\non the air conditioner and a belief that moving her hand in a certain\nway is a token of that type of act. It is important to note that\nBratman’s early arguments were directed against this simple\ndesire-belief model of intention, and not necessarily against the model\nproposed by Cognitivists. We turn in a moment to the question of to\nwhat degree Bratman’s theory of intention militates against the\nlatter view. \n\nBratman motivated the idea that intentions are psychologically real\nand not reducible to desire-belief complexes by observing that they are\nmotivationally distinctive, and subject to their own unique standards\nof rational appraisal. First, he noted that intentions involve\ncharacteristic kinds of motivational commitment. Intentions are conduct\ncontrolling, in the sense that if you intend to F at t, and\nnothing changes before t, then (other things equal) you will\nF. The same is clearly not true for desire; we habitually\nresist present-directed desires. Second, he noted that intentions\ninvolve characteristic kinds of normative commitment (or\n“reasoning-centered commitment”). Intentions resist\nreconsideration—they are relatively stable, in the sense that we\ntake ourselves to be settled on a course of action when we intend it,\nand it seems to be irrational to reconsider an intention absent\nspecific reason for doing so. In addition, intentions put pressure on\nus to form further intentions in order to more efficiently coordinate\nour actions. When we intend to go to the park, for example, we feel\npressure to form intentions concerning how to get there, what to bring,\netc. Again, desires do not appear to be subject to norms of\nnon-reconsideration, and they do not seem to put pressure on us to form\nfurther desires about means. \n\nBratman went on to provide a more rigorous characterization of the\nconstitutive norms on intention, a characterization that has been\nhugely influential. The three main norms he discussed are requirements\nof internal consistency, means-end coherence, and\nconsistency with the agent’s beliefs. The applicability\nof these requirements to states of intention was, for Bratman, a\nfurther strike against the desire-belief model. \n\nThe first norm requires agents to make their intentions consistent\nwith one another. Imagine that Mike intends to go to the game, and also\nintends to refrain from going. Mike seems obviously irrational. Yet it\nwould be in no way irrational for Mike to desire to go to the game and\nto desire to refrain from going. So it appears that the irrationality\nof having inconsistent intentions cannot be explained by appealing to\nrun of the mill norms on desire and belief. Likewise, intentions seem\nsubject to a norm of means-end coherence. If Mike intends to go to the\ngame, and believes that he must buy a ticket in advance in order to go,\nthen he is obviously irrational if he does not intend to buy a ticket\n(provided he persists in intending to go to the game). Again, merely\ndesiring to go to the game, and believing that going to the game\nrequires buying a ticket, would not be sufficient to render Mike\nirrational in the event that he failed to desire to buy one. So again\nit appears that the norms on beliefs and desires cannot suffice to\ngenerate the norms on intentions. \n\nFinally, Bratman claimed that rational agents have intentions that\nare consistent with their beliefs. The exact nature of this\nintention-belief consistency norm has since been the subject of\nconsiderable attention [Bratman 1987, Wallace 2001, Yaffe 2010]. But\nthe general idea is that it is irrational to intend to F while\nalso believing that one will not F—this would amount to\nan objectionable form of inconsistency. Yet desiring to F\nwhile believing that one will not F seems like no rational\nerror at all. \n\n[It should be noted that the general intuition about the\nirrationality of this form of inconsistency is by no means\nunassailable. As Bratman himself points out, it seems perfectly\npossible, and not irrational, to intend to stop at the library without\nbelieving that I will (recognizing, say, my own forgetful nature). If\nthat is correct, then it is not immediately obvious why I could not\npermissibly intend to stop while also believing that I will not.]  \n\nHowever, while Bratman’s arguments do seem devastating for the\ndesire-belief view of intention, they are not necessarily as persuasive\nagainst the Cognitivist’s reduction of intentions to beliefs. For\nexample, consider again the norm of intention consistency, which\nconvicts Mike of error when he intends to go to the game and also\nintends to refrain from going. Above we suggested that this norm could\nnot be explained by appealing to norms on desire, since it is\npermissible to have inconsistent desires. But now imagine that the\nintention to F just is (or necessarily involves) the belief\nthat one will F. Then intending to F, and intending\nto refrain from F-ing, will entail that one has contradictory\nbeliefs. So if the Cognitivist can help himself to this constitutive\nclaim about the link between intending and believing, he appears to\nhave an attractive explanation of the norm requiring intention\nconsistency. The status of this constitutive claim, and of the\nplausibility of deriving other norms (e.g. means-end coherence) from\nit, is a matter of dispute (see Ross 2008). Of course, if\nBratman was right to contend that one can intend to F without\nbelieving that she will F, then the Cognitivist picture of intention\nseems doomed from the get-go. \n\nSeen in another light, then, the conclusion that intentions are\npsychologically real and irreducible to simpler states may be\nvindicated by way of a critique of the motivations for Cognitivism. In\nthis vein, some philosophers (notably Sarah Paul (2009)) have\ninfluentially argued that the Cognitivist is committed to an\nunattractive picture of the justification of intention formation. An\nintention is, according to the Cognitivist, just a belief of something\nlike the following form: ‘I will now F’. But as\nPaul points out, before I form an intention I typically lack sufficient\nreason for thinking that I will perform the action intended—if I\nhave sufficient reason to believe that I will F, then I\nneedn’t form the intention to F at all. It seems to\nfollow that intending constitutively involves forming a belief for\nwhich I lack sufficient evidence. Indeed, it appears that the only sort\nof consideration potentially counting in favor of the belief that I\nwill F is my preference that this proposition turns out true.\nSo intending appears to be a form of wishful thinking on the\nCognitivist picture of intentions. This can be seen as a troubling\nresult, given that we ordinarily regard wishful thinking as deeply\nirrational and intending as perfectly rational. [It should be noted\nthat Velleman (1989) embraces this idea; he thinks it sufficient to\njustify the rationality of intentions that they will be rationally\nsupported once they are in place. Paul is arguing more directly against\nSetiya (2008), who does not regard Velleman’s faith in post hoc\njustification as sufficient for justifying the formation of an\nintention.] Paul takes this and other problems for the Cognitivist to\nestablish that intentions are distinctive practical attitudes,\nincapable of reduction to the theoretical attitude of belief. So\nconceived, this critique of Cognitivism is continuous with\nBratman’s critique of Davidson’s early reductive picture of\nintention. \n\nThe issues about intention just canvassed are an instance of a more\ngeneral project of understanding the nature of our mental states by\nunderstanding the normative requirements that apply to them. Just as\nsome philosophers attempt to illuminate the nature of belief in a way\nthat will be profitable for epistemology and the philosophy of mind by\nmaking normative claims about it—for example by claiming that\nbelief ‘aims at truth’ (Velleman 2000, Shah\n2003)—many philosophers interested in agency have become\nincreasingly hopeful that a thorough investigation of the norms on\nintentions will result in important conclusions for other\nareas of inquiry. One guiding thought of Gideon Yaffe’s ambitious\nAttempts (2010) is precisely that an adequate account of the\nnormative commitments of intention will have a great deal to tell us\nabout how the criminal law ought to be structured. \n\nBut the idea that there are distinctive norms on intention has been\nchallenged from another direction as well. Niko Kolodny (2005, 2007,\n2008) makes the skeptical claim that we have no reason to be rational,\nand one main consequence of this thought is that there are no\ndistinctively rational norms on our propositional attitudes at all.\n(Raz (2005) argues for a similar claim, but restricts his skepticism to\nwhat he regards as the mythical norm of means-end coherence.) We do not\nhave the space to present the details of Kolodny’s arguments.\nThere are two main ideas: first, that all putative coherence\nrequirements of rationality are in fact underwritten by two\n“core” requirements, which appeal to the rational pressure\nto form and refrain from forming attitudes on the basis of our beliefs\nabout whether there are sufficient reasons for having those attitudes;\nand second, that these core requirements are not themselves genuinely\nnormative. If Kolodny were correct, then the rational norms on\nintention would be explicable by appeal to the same principles as the\nnorms on belief, and any other normatively assessable\nattitudes—and would moreover be, at best, pseudo-norms, or\nprinciples that merely appear normative to us. This would not\namount to a win for Cognitivism, since the explanation would turn on\nunderlying features of all reasoning processes, and not on any\nnecessary connection between the possession of intentions and beliefs.\nBut Kolodny’s view might well be viewed as a threat to the idea\nthat inquiry into the norms on intention is a useful way to get\ntraction on other issues. In any event, this skeptical view about the\nauthority and autonomy of rationality is highly controversial, and\ndepends on disputed claims about reasoning and the logical form of\nrational requirements (see Bridges (2009), Broome (1999, 2007),\nSchroeder (2004, 2009), Finlay (2010), Brunero (2010), Shpall (2012),\nWay (2010)). \n\nFinally, Richard Holton (2008, 2009) has initiated a new direction\nin contemporary work on the nature of intention with his advocacy of a\nnovel theory of partial intentions. On his view, partial intentions are\nintention-like states that figure as sub-strategies in the context of\nlarger, more complex plans to accomplish a given end. Such partial\nintentions are, Holton thinks, necessary for adequately rich\npsychological explanations: merely appealing to full intentions cannot\nsucceed in capturing the wide range of phenomena that intention-like\nstates appear to explain. And much like credential doxastic states,\npartial intentions will presumably bring with them their own sets of\nnorms. Intuitively, having high credence that Spain will win the World\nCup places me under different commitments than believing that Spain\nwill win. Likewise, only partially intending to steal the cookie from\nthe cookie jar seems to be in some way normatively different than fully\nintending to steal the cookie. \n\nThere are many outstanding questions about Holton’s account,\nand about the nature of partial intentions more generally. For example,\nwhy can’t Holton’s states of partial intention be analyzed\nas regular intentions with conditional content? And why should we think\nthat there is any connection between an intention’s being partial\nand it’s being a part of a more complex plan? If competing\naccounts of partial intention result in a more unified picture of\npartial attitudes is this a substantial consideration in their favor?\nConsider accounts that link the notion of partial intention to the\n(partial) degree to which an agent is committed to the action in\nquestion. Such accounts have a nice story to tell about the\nrelationship between credential states and partial\nintentions—they are species of the same genus, in the sense that\nthey involve not full but partial commitment to the proposition or\naction in question. Thought about these\nquestions is still in its early stages, but is likely to shed light on\nat least some of the central normative questions of interest to\nphilosophers of action."}]
