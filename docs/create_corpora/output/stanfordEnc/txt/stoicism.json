The name derives from the porch (stoa poikilê)\nin the Agora at Athens decorated with mural paintings, where the\nmembers of the school congregated, and their lectures were held.\nUnlike ‘epicurean,’ the sense of the English adjective\n‘stoical’ is not utterly misleading with regard to its\nphilosophical origins. The Stoics did, in fact, hold that emotions\nlike fear or envy (or impassioned sexual attachments, or passionate\nlove of anything whatsoever) either were, or arose from, false\njudgements and that the sage – a person who had attained moral and\nintellectual perfection – would not undergo them. The later Stoics\nof Roman Imperial times, Seneca and Epictetus, emphasise the doctrines\n(already central to the early Stoics’ teachings) that the sage\nis utterly immune to misfortune and that virtue is sufficient for\nhappiness. Our phrase ‘stoic calm’ perhaps encapsulates\nthe general drift of these claims. It does not, however, hint at the\neven more radical ethical views which the Stoics defended, e.g. that\nonly the sage is free while all others are slaves, or that all those\nwho are morally vicious are equally so. (For other examples, see\nCicero’s brief essay ‘Paradoxa Stoicorum’.) Though\nit seems clear that some Stoics took a kind of perverse joy in\nadvocating views which seem so at odds with common sense, they did not\ndo so simply to shock. Stoic ethics achieves a certain plausibility\nwithin the context of their physical theory and psychology, and within\nthe framework of Greek ethical theory as that was handed down to them\nfrom Plato and Aristotle. It seems that they were well aware of the\nmutually interdependent nature of their philosophical views, likening\nphilosophy itself to a living animal in which logic is bones and\nsinews; ethics and physics, the flesh and the soul respectively\n(another version reverses this assignment, making ethics the soul).\nTheir views in logic and physics are no less distinctive and\ninteresting than those in ethics itself. \n\nSince the Stoics stress the systematic nature of their philosophy, the\nideal way to evaluate the Stoics’ distinctive ethical views\nwould be to study them within the context of a full exposition of\ntheir philosophy. Here, however, we meet with the problem about the\nsources of our knowledge about Stoicism. We do not possess a single\ncomplete work by any of the first three heads of the Stoic school: the\n‘founder,’ Zeno of Citium in Cyprus (344–262 BCE),\nCleanthes (d. 232 BCE) or Chrysippus (d. ca. 206 BCE). Chrysippus was\nparticularly prolific, composing over 165 works, but we have only\nfragments of his works. The only complete works by Stoic philosophers\nthat we possess are those by writers of Imperial times, Seneca (4\nBCE–65 CE), Epictetus (c. 55–135) and the Emperor Marcus\nAurelius (121–180) and these works are principally focused on\nethics. They tend to be long on moral exhortation but give only clues\nto the theoretical bases of the moral system. For detailed information\nabout the Old Stoa (i.e. the first three heads of the school and their\npupils and associates) we have to depend on either doxographies, like\npseudo-Plutarch Philosophers’ Opinions on Nature,\nDiogenes Laertius’ Lives of Eminent Philosophers (3rd\nc. CE), and Stobaeus’ Excerpts (5th c. CE) – and\ntheir sources Aetius (ca. 1st c. CE) and Arius Didymus (1st c.\nBCE–CE) – or other philosophers (or Christian apologists) who\ndiscuss the Stoics for their own purposes. Nearly all of the latter\ngroup are hostile witnesses. Among them are the Aristotelian\ncommentator Alexander of Aphrodisias (late 2nd c. CE) who criticises\nthe Stoics in On Mixture and On Fate, among other\nworks; the Platonist Plutarch of Chaeronea (1st-2nd c. CE) who\nauthored works such as On Stoic Self-Contradictions and\nAgainst the Stoics on Common Conceptions; the medical writer\nGalen (2nd c. CE), whose outlook is roughly Platonist; the Pyrrhonian\nskeptic, Sextus Empiricus (2nd c. CE); Plotinus (3rd c. CE); the\nChristian bishops Eusebius (3rd–4th c. CE) and Nemesius (ca. 400\nCE); and the sixth-century neoplatonist commentator on Aristotle,\nSimplicius. Another important source is Cicero (1st c. BCE). Though\nhis own philosophical position derives from that of his teacher Philo\nof Larissa and the New Academy, he is not without sympathy for what he\nsees as the high moral tone of Stoicism. In works like his\nAcademic Books, On the Nature of the Gods, and\nOn Ends he provides summaries in Latin, with critical\ndiscussion, of the views of the major Hellenistic schools of thought.\n \nFrom these sources, scholars have attempted to piece together a\npicture of the content, and in some cases, the development of Stoic\ndoctrine. In some areas, there is a fair bit of consensus about what\nthe Stoics thought and we can even attach names to some particular\ninnovations. However, in other areas the proper interpretation of our\nmeagre evidence is hotly contested. Until recently, non-specialists\nhave been largely excluded from the debate because many important\nsources were not translated into modern languages. Fragments of Stoic\nworks and testimonia in their original Greek and Latin were collected\ninto a three-volume set in 1903–5 by H. von Arnim, Stoicorum\nVeterum Fragmenta. In writings on the ‘old’ Stoics,\nfragments and testimonia are often referred to by von Arnim’s\nvolume numbers and text numeration; e.g. SVF I.345=Diogenes Laertius,\nLives 4.40. In 1987, A. A. Long and David Sedley brought out\nThe Hellenistic Philosophers (LS) which contains in\nits first volume English translations and commentary of many important\ntexts on Stoics, Epicureans and Skeptics. In 1988 Long and Sedley was\nfollowed by a collection of primary texts edited by B. Inwood and L.\nP. Gerson entitled Hellenistic Philosophy. Unless otherwise\nspecifically noted, I refer in what follows to texts by or about\nStoics using the author’s name followed by Long and\nSedley’s notation for the text. For example, ‘Aetius,\n26A’ refers to section 26 of Aetius’s work, text A (unless\notherwise noted, I use their translation, sometimes slightly\naltered). The Inwood and Gerson collection translates many of the same\ntexts, but unlike LS does not chop them up into smaller bits\nclassified by topic. Each approach has its merits, but the LS\ncollection better serves the needs of an encyclopedia entry. For\nFrench translation of Chrysippus, see Dufour (2004). For German\ntranslation of the early Stoa, see Nickel (2009). \nFor additional information, see also the entry on\n doxography of ancient philosophy. \nWhen considering the doctrines of the Stoics, it is important to\nremember that they think of philosophy not as an interesting pastime\nor even a particular body of knowledge, but as a way of life. They\ndefine philosophy as a kind of practice or exercise\n(askêsis) in the expertise concerning what is\nbeneficial (Aetius, 26A). Once we come to know what we and the world\naround us are really like, and especially the nature of value, we will\nbe utterly transformed. This therapeutic aspect is common to their\nmain competitors, the Epicureans, and perhaps helps to explain why\nboth were eventually eclipsed by Christianity. The\nMeditations of Marcus Aurelius provide a fascinating picture\nof a would-be Stoic sage at work on himself. The book, also called\nTo Himself, is the emperor’s diary. In it, he not only\nreminds himself of the content of important Stoic teaching but also\nreproaches himself when he realises that he has failed to incorporate\nthis teaching into his life in some particular instance. Today many\npeople still turn to Stoicism as a form of psychological discipline.\nStoicism has never been ‘purely academic’ and modern\nadaptations of Stoic thought seek to carry on this tradition of\nself-transformation. One of the most influential modern\ninterpretations of means through which the Stoic philosophizing\naccomplished such a transformation introduces the notion of spiritual\nexercises. Hadot (1998) provides a reading of Marcus Aurelius’\nMeditations as a set of such exercises. For a more general\ntreatment covering Stoic philosophy as a whole, see Sellars (2013).\nFor a recent discussion of the entire question of philosophy as a way\n– or rather as many ways – of life in antiquity, see Cooper 2102.\n \nAn examination of Stoic ontology might profitably begin with a passage\nfrom Plato’s Sophist (cf. Brunschwig 1994). There\n(247d-e), Plato asks for a mark or indication of what is real or what\nhas being. One answer which is mooted is that the capacity to act or\nbe acted upon is the distinctive mark of real existence or ‘that\nwhich is.’ The Stoics accept this criterion and add the rider\nthat only bodies can act or be acted upon. Thus, only bodies exist. So\nthere is a sense in which the Stoics are materialists or –\nperhaps more accurately, given their understanding of matter as the\npassive principle (see below) –\n‘corporealists’. However, they also hold that there are\nother ways of appearing in the complete inventory of the world than by\nvirtue of existing. Incorporeal things like time, place or sayables\n(lekta, see below) are ‘subsistent’\n(huphestos, Galen 27G) – as are imaginary things like\ncentaurs. The distinction between the subsistent and the existent\nsomewhat complicates the easy assimilation of Stoicism to modern\nmaterialism.  It’s not wrong to say that all existent things are\ncorporeal according to the Stoics, but one needs to add that existent\nthings don’t exhaust their ontology. All existent things are, in\naddition, particulars. The Stoics call universals\n‘figments of the mind’. Platonic Forms, in particular, are\nrejected as ‘not somethings’ which lack even the\nsubsistent status of incorporeals like time, place or sayables\n(Alexander, 30D). The Stoics’ positive nominalist alternative is\nharder to interpret. Some texts suggest that they offered a\nconceptualist treatment akin to Locke’s, treating an apparent\npredication like “man is a rational, mortal animal” as the\ndisguised conditional, “if something is a man, then it is a\nrational mortal animal” (Sextus Empiricus, 30I). But there may\nwell have been development within the school from this conceptualist\nview toward a form of predicate nominalism. See Caston (1999). \nIn accord with this ontology, the Stoics, like the Epicureans, make\nGod a corporeal entity, though not (as with the Epicureans) one made\nof everyday matter. But while the Epicureans think the gods are too\nbusy being blessed and happy to be bothered with the governance of the\nuniverse (Epicurus, Letter to Menoeceus 123–4), the Stoic God is\nimmanent throughout the whole of creation and directs its development\ndown to the smallest detail. The governing metaphor for Stoic\ncosmology is biological, in contrast to the fundamentally\nmechanical conception of the Epicureans. The entire cosmos is a\nliving thing and God stands to the cosmos as an animal’s life\nforce stands to the animal’s body, enlivening, moving and\ndirecting it by its presence throughout. The Stoics insistence that\nonly bodies are capable of causing anything, however, guarantees that\nthis cosmic life force must be conceived of as somehow corporeal.  \nMore specifically, God is identical with one of the two ungenerated\nand indestructible first principles (archai) of the universe.\nOne principle is matter which they regard as utterly unqualified and\ninert. It is that which is acted upon. God is identified with an\neternal reason (logos, Diog. Laert. 44B ) or intelligent\ndesigning fire or a breath (pneuma) which structures matter in\naccordance with Its plan (Aetius, 46A). The designing fire is likened\nto sperm or seed which contains the first principles or directions of\nall the things which will subsequently develop (Aristocles in\nEusebius, 46G). The biological conception of God as a kind of living\nheat or seed from which things grow seems to be fully intended. The\nfurther identification of God with pneuma or breath may have its\norigins in medical theories of the Hellenistic period. See Baltzly\n(2003). On the entire issue of God and its relation to the cosmos in\nStoicism, see the essays in Salles (2009). \nJust as living things have a life-cycle that is witnessed in parents\nand then again in their off-spring, so too the universe has a life\ncycle that is repeated. This life cycle is guided by, or equivalent\nto, a developmental plan that is identified with God. There is a cycle\nof endless recurrence, beginning from a state in which all is fire,\nthrough the generation of the elements, to the creation of the world\nwe are familiar with, and eventually back to the state of pure\ndesigning fire called ‘the conflagration’ (Nemesius, 52C).\nThis idea of world-cycles punctuated by conflagrations raised a number\nof questions. Will there be another you reading this encyclopedia\nentry in the next world cycle? Or merely someone exactly similar to\nyou? Different sources attribute different answers to the Stoics on\nthese questions. (For sameness of person, see Alexander (52F). For\nsomeone indistinguishable, but not not identical, see Origen (52G).)\nThe doctrine of eternal recurrence also raises interesting questions\nabout the Stoic view of time. Did they suppose that the moment in the\nnext world cycle at which you (or someone indistinguishable from you)\nreads this entry is a moment in the future (so time is linear) or the\nvery same moment (with some notion of circular time)? The Stoic\ndefinition of time as the ‘dimension (diastêma) of\nmotion’ or ‘of the world’s motion’\n(Simplicius, 51A) hardly seems to settle the question. For a clear\nexchange on the issue, see Long (1985) and Hudson (1990). \nThe first things to develop from the conflagration are the\nelements. Of the four elements, the Stoics identify two as active\n(fire and air) and two as passive (water and earth). The active\nelements, or at least the principles of hot and cold, combine to form\nbreath or pneuma.  Pneuma, in turn, is the ‘sustaining\ncause’ (causa continens, synektikon aition) of\nall existing bodies and guides the growth and development of animate\nbodies. What is a sustaining cause? The Stoics think that the universe\nis a plenum. Like Aristotle, they reject the existence of empty space\nor void (except that the universe as a whole is surrounded by\nit). Thus, one might reasonably ask, ‘What marks any one object\noff from others surrounding it?’ or, ‘What keeps an object\nfrom constantly falling apart as it rubs elbows with other things in\nthe crowd?’.  The answer is: pneuma. Pneuma, by its nature, has\na simultaneous movement inward and outward which constitutes its\ninherent ‘tensility.’ (Perhaps this was suggested by the\nexpansion and contraction associated with heat and cold.) Pneuma\npasses through all (other) bodies; in its outward motion it gives them\nthe qualities that they have, and in its inward motion makes them\nunified objects (Nemesius, 47J). In this latter respect, pneuma plays\nsomething like one of the roles of substantial form in Aristotle for this too\nmakes the thing of which it is the form ‘some this,’\ni.e. an individual (Metaph.\nVII, 17). Because pneuma acts, it must be a body and it appears that\nthe Stoics stressed the fact that its blending with the passive elements is\n‘through and through’ (Galen 47H, Alex. Aph. 48C). Perhaps\nas a result of this, they developed a theory of mixture which allowed\nfor two bodies to be in the same place at the same time. It should be\nnoted, however, that some scholars (e.g. Sorabji, 1988) think that the\nclaim that pneuma is blended through the totality of matter is a\nconclusion that the Stoics’ critics adversely drew about what\nsome of their statements committed them to. Perhaps instead they\nproposed merely that pneuma is the matter of a body at a different\nlevel of description. \nPneuma comes in gradations and endows the bodies which it pervades\nwith different qualities as a result. The pneuma which sustains an\ninanimate object is (LS) a ‘tenor’\n(hexis, lit. a holding). Pneuma in plants is, in addition,\n(LS) physique (phusis, lit. ‘nature’).\nIn animals, pneuma is soul (psychê) and\nin rational animals pneuma is, besides, the commanding faculty\n(hêgemonikon) (Diog. Laert. 47O, Philo 47P) – that\nis responsible for thinking, planning, deciding. The Stoics assign to\n‘physique’ or ‘nature’ all the purely\nphysiological life functions of a human animal (such as digestion,\nbreathing, growth etc.) – self-movement from place to place is due\nto soul. \nTheir account of the human soul (mind) is strongly monistic.\nThough they speak of the soul’s faculties, these are parts of\nthe commanding faculty associated with the physical sense organs\n(Aetius, 53H). Unlike the Platonic tri-partite soul, all impulses or\ndesires are direct functions of the rational, commanding faculty. This\nstrongly monistic conception of the human soul has serious\nimplications for Stoic epistemology and ethics. In the first case, our\nimpressions of sense are affections of the commanding faculty. In\nmature rational animals, these impressions are thoughts, or\nrepresentations with propositional content. Though a person may have\nno choice about whether she has a particular rational impression,\nthere is another power of the commanding faculty which the Stoics call\n‘assent’ and whether one assents to a rational impression\nis a matter of volition. To assent to an impression is to take its\ncontent as true. To withhold assent is to suspend judgement about\nwhether it is true. Because both impression and assent are part of one\nand the same commanding faculty, there can be no conflict between\nseparate and distinct rational and nonrational elements within\noneself – a fight which reason might lose. Compare this situation\nwith Plato’s description of the conflict between the inferior\nsoul within us which is taken in by sensory illusions and the\ncalculating part which is not (Rep. X, 602e). There is no\nreason to think that the calculating part can always win the\nepistemological civil war which Plato imagines to take place within\nus. But because the impression and assent are both aspects of one and\nthe same commanding faculty according to the Stoics, they think that\nwe can always avoid falling into error if only our reason is\nsufficiently disciplined. In a similar fashion, impulses or desires\nare movements of the soul toward something. In a rational creature,\nthese are exercises of the rational faculty which do not arise without\nassent. Thus, a movement of the soul toward X is not automatically\nconsequent upon the impression that X is desirable. This is what the\nStoics’ opponents, the Academic Skeptics, argue against them is\npossible (Plutarch, 69A.) The Stoics, however, claim that there will\nbe no impulse toward X – much less an action – unless one\nassents to the impression (Plutarch, 53S). The upshot of this is that\nall desires are not only (at least potentially) under the\ncontrol of reason, they are acts of reason. Thus there\ncould be no gap between forming the decisive judgement that one ought\nto do X and an effective impulse to do X. \nSince pneuma is corporeal, there is a sense in which the Stoics have a\ntheory of mind that would be called ‘materialist’ in the\nmodern sense (cf. Annas 2009). The pneuma which is a person’s\nsoul is subject to generation and destruction (Plutarch 53 C, Eusebius\n53W). Unlike for the Epicureans, however, it does not follow from this\nthat my soul will be utterly destroyed at the time at which my body\ndies. Chrysippus alleged that the souls of the wise would not perish\nuntil the next conflagration (Diog. Laert. 7.157=SVF 2.811, not in\nLS). Is this simply a failure of nerve on the part of an\notherwise thorough-going materialist? Recall that the distinctive\nmovement of pneuma is its simultaneous inward and outward motion. It\nis this which makes it tensile and capable of preserving, organising\nand, in some cases, animating the bodies which it interpenetrates. The\nStoics equate virtue with wisdom and both with a kind of firmness or\ntensile strength within the commanding faculty of the soul (Arius\nDidymus 41H, Plutarch 61B, Galen 65T). Perhaps the thought was that\nthe souls of the wise had a sufficient tensile strength that they\ncould continue to exist as a distinct body on their own.  Later Stoics\nlike Panaetius (2nd c. BCE) and Posidonius (first half 1st c. BCE) may\nhave abandoned this view of Chrysippus’. \nLet us conclude this survey of the physical part of Stoic philosophy\nwith the question of causal determinism, though this is an issue that\nwill emerge again in the following section on logic. The clear first\nimpression of Stoic philosophy is that they are determinists about\ncausation, who regard the present as fully determined by past events,\nbut who nonetheless want to preserve scope for moral responsibility by\ndefending a version of compatibilism. That characterisation is not\nwrong exactly, but it makes the matter sound far simpler than it in\nfact is since it effaces some important differences between our\nframework for discussing these matters and that of ancient\nphilosophers. One key difference is that most contemporary thinking\nabout causation treats it as a relation between events. But\nancient discussions of causation take place in a context that has no\nready vocabulary for events. That doesn’t mean they denied the\nexistence of events or failed to notice that things happen. It just\nmeans that there is no specific piece of philosophical terminology for\ncontrasting what happens with the things that it happens to or with\ntruths about what happened. When we speak of events, we speak of\nthings that helpfully fill the gap between things and statements.\nSince they take place at a particular time and involve some objects\nand not others, events are somewhat thing-like. (Even theories of\nevents that don’t treat them as concrete particulars must in\nsome way do justice to this aspect of event talk.) On the other hand,\nthey also have a propositional structure of sorts. The event of Seneca\nsitting in a bathtub contemplating a book involves such objects as\nSeneca, his book and his tub, but it involves them in a way that has a\nkind of structure. Though it involves the same objects, the event of\nSeneca sitting on his book and contemplating his bathtub is very\ndifferent from the first event. Absent a robust concept of causation\nas a relation among events, Stoic analyses of causation sound very odd\nto the modern ear. \nThe propositional event-like structure of the effect in the Stoic\naccount of causation is given by the insistence that the cause brings\nit about that a body has a predicate true of it. But if we\nthink about Sextus’ example, it’s not just the scalpel\nthat is the cause of the flesh being cut, for it did not cause this\nwhen it was stored safely in a drawer. So there’s event-like\nstructure (the flesh’s being cut) on the effect side of the\ncausal interaction in the Stoic analysis, but not on the cause side.\nThere we have just the body, the scalpel. The role of the event-like\nstructure of the cause in the Stoic scheme is fulfilled by talking\nabout a whole range of different kinds of causes. The sources on the\nStoic taxonomy of causes are complex and conflicting, so we can\nconfine our attention to a few of the more important kinds:\npreliminary causes, sustaining causes, and proximate causes. In this\nrespect, the Stoic view is not wholly unlike Aristotle’s account\nwhich famously included ‘the four causes’. It would be\nmore accurate to say that Aristotle’s four causes are four kinds\nof explanatory factors. What Aristotle does not say, however, is that\nthe presence of these explanatory factors necessitates that\nwhich they explain. Causal processes involve a kind of generality for\nAristotle. They bring about these things ‘always or for the most\npart’ but that is very different from the Stoic insistence that\ncauses necessitate. The working out of the divine plan by God or the\nworld’s pneuma they call ‘fate’ and describe it as a\nsequence of causes that is ‘inescapable’\n(aparabatos Aetius, 55J; cf. Gellius, 55K). In On Fate\nCicero sought to explain how Chrysippus attempted to avoid the conclusion\nthat, since our actions come about by prior causes, they are not in\nour power. Chrysippus’ answer turns on the different kinds of\ncauses the Stoics sought to identify and it is worth quoting at\nlength: \nA full understanding of Chrysippus’ attempted resolution of the\nproblem of how anything can be up to us when the history of the world\nis such that the present chapter of the narrative is inescapable given\nwhat has come before is rendered difficult by the lack of clarity\naround the various kinds of causes. It is clear enough, at least in\ngeneral terms, what outcome Chrysippus was aiming with respect to\nhuman action. In a famous analogy, he treats a person’s\ncharacter as analogous to the shape of a cylinder. It is true that the\nworld gives us things to react to, just as a person might give the\ncylinder a shove. But the cylinder rolls, rather than slides, because\nof its specific shape (i.e. its nature). So too your decisions are\nyour decisions in as much as the kind of person you are makes a\ndifference to what you decide to do. Sure – you are the kind of\nperson that you are in no small part because of what has happened to\nyou previously. But when your decisions play a role in bringing about\nwhat you do, the Stoics say that what comes about through fate comes\nabout through you and those actions are ‘up to you’\nin some sense appropriate to the notion of responsibility.  That sense\nis allegedly supplied by the distinction among the kinds of causes\nintroduced above. Detailed scholarly work on the question of free will\nand determinism in Stoicism seeks to engage with our various sources\nand attempts to position this very different framework for thinking\nabout causes and causation in relation to our own. A good guide to the\nterrain is provided by Hankinson, chapters 14 and 15 in Algra, Barnes,\nMansfeld & Schofield (1999). Bobzien (1998) is longer and perhaps\nmore difficult for the beginning philosopher, but very\nauthoritative. \nThe Stoics also discuss a notion of freedom that is rather more moral\nthan metaphysical. This sense of freedom involves ‘the power to\nlive as you will’ (Cicero, Stoic Paradoxes 5, 34). It\nturns out, for reasons that will be discussed below in the section on\nethics, that only the Stoic wise man is truly free. All others are\nslaves. This notion of freedom and its relation to Kantian autonomy is\ndiscussed in Cooper (2004). \nThe scope of what the Stoics called ‘logic’\n(logikê, i.e. knowledge of the functions of\nlogos or reason) was very wide, including not only the\nanalysis of argument forms, but also rhetoric, grammar, the theories\nof concepts, propositions, perception, and thought. Thus Stoic\nlogikê included not only what we would call logic, but\nalso philosophy of language and epistemology.  \nIn philosophy of language, their most noted innovation was their\ntheory of ‘sayables’ or lekta. The Stoics\ndistinguish between the signification, the signifier and the\nname-bearer. Two of these are bodies: the signifier which is the\nutterance and the name-bearer which is what gets signified. The\nsignification, however, is an incorporeal thing called a\nlekton, or ‘sayable,’ and it, and neither of the\nother two, is what is true or false (Sextus Empiricus, 33B). They\ndefine a sayable as “that which subsists in accordance with a\nrational impression.” Rational impressions are those alterations\nof the commanding faculty or rational mind whose content can be\nexhibited in language. Presumably ‘graphei\nSôkratês’ and ‘Socrates writes’\nexhibit the contents of one and the same rational impression in\ndifferent languages. \nAt first glance, this looks very like a modern theory of propositions\nand indeed propositions (axiômata) are one subspecies\nof Stoic sayables. But it would be a mistake to assimilate this\nsub-class of sayables too closely to modern theories of propositions.\nModern theories tend to treat propositions as untensed and\ntime-indexed. When I utter the words “It’s warm in Hobart\ntoday” I express the proposition that it is warm in Hobart on 25\nFebruary 2018. That’s a different proposition from the one I\nwould express with the use of those same words tomorrow. If, as is all\ntoo often the case, it is cold tomorrow and what I say by means of the\nwords “It is warm in Hobart today” is false, then the\nproposition did not change its truth value. The tenseless and\ntime-indexed propositions we express with our words have their truth\nvalues eternally. Stoic axiômata are crucially\ndifferent in this respect. The Stoic theory holds invariant the\nidentity of the sayable corresponding to my utterances on the\ndifferent occasions, but allows its truth value to change (Diog.\nLaert., 34E). In addition to these axiômata, the class\nof so-called ‘complete sayables’ included questions and\ncommands, as well as syllogisms (Diog. Laert., 33F). \nIn the category of sayables called ‘incomplete,’ the\nStoics included predicates and, as in the case of propositions, these\nare the meanings which we can express through the use of different\nlanguages. So the utterance ‘graphei’ in Greek\npresumably corresponds to the same incomplete sayable as ‘___\nwrites’ in English. Like some modern theories of predicates,\nthese incomplete lekta are hungry for arguments or what the\nStoics would call a nominative case (ptôsis, Diog.\nLaert., 33G). Curiously the Stoics distinguished between examples\nwhere the filling in of the subject that yields a complete sayable\nhappens by means of a referring term (as in ‘Socrates\nwrites’ and cases involving ostensive reference like ‘this\none writes’. ‘This one writes’ was called\n‘definite’, while ‘Socrates writes’ was\npredicative or middle – the latter in order to distinguish it\nfrom an indefinite predication like ‘someone writes’. The\nisolation of ostensive reference as a special case gives rise to\nanother odd feature of the Stoic account of meanings and propositions.\nStanding in the presence of Socrates’ corpse, you can utter the\nwords ‘Socrates is dead’ and your words correspond to a\ncomplete lekton (and one that is true at that time). But point to the\nbody and say ‘This one is dead’ and the Stoics seem to\nhave supposed the reference failed in such a way that the sayable\n‘is destroyed’ (Alexander, 38F). This odd feature of\nsayables looms large in the Stoic response to competing accounts of\nmodality.  \nThe examples dealt with so far are examples of simple, complete\nsayables or propositions. The Stoics also developed an account of\nnon-simple propositions. This interest in non-simple\npropositions and their logical relations was shared with philosophers\nin the Megarian or Dialectical school. It set the philosophers of the\nHellenistic period on the pathway to surpass Aristotle’s\nprogress in logic. His logic was ‘a logic of terms’. To\nput the matter very briefly and far too crudely, Aristotle had\ndeveloped an account of a limited range of kinds statements (e.g. All\nA are B, or Some A are B, or No A are B). His theory of the syllogism\nsought to systematically investigate all the ways of combining pairs\nof such statements and to identify the combinations where the first\ntwo (the premises) entail a third statement (the conclusion) of same\nsort purely as a result of the form of the premises rather than their\ncontent. Focused on the connections between predicate and subject\nterms in such statements, it had little to say about complex\nstatements that had complete statements as parts. The Stoics, by\ncontrast, made progress in what we now call propositional logic. They\ndeveloped accounts of propositional negation (‘it is not the\ncase that p’), conjunction (‘p and q’),\ndisjunction (‘p or q’) and entered the on-going debate\nover the correct understanding of conditionals (‘if p, then\nq’). Their accounts of the connectives joining simple\npropositions into complex ones also led them into questions about\nmodal concepts (possibility, impossibility, necessity and\ncontingency). One of the accounts they offer of the validity of\narguments is that an argument is valid if, through the use of certain\nground rules (themata), it is possible to reduce it to one of\nthe five indemonstrable forms (Diog. Laert., 36A). These five\nindemonstrables are argument forms that should be familiar to anyone\nwho has taken an introductory logic class: \nStoic contributions to logic and philosophy of language, as well as\nthe backdrop of Aristotelian and Megarian views in the Hellenistic\nperiod, are thoroughly surveyed in a 100 page entry on the subject by\nBarnes, Bobzien and Mignucci in The Cambridge History of\nHellenistic Philosophy (Algra et al, 1999). An abbreviated and\nmore digestible version of this material by Bobzien appears in Inwood\n(2003). \nThough these and other developments in logic are interesting in their\nown right, the Stoic treatment of certain problems about modality and\nbivalence are more significant for the shape of Stoicism as a whole.\nChrysippus in particular was convinced that bivalence and the law of\nexcluded middle apply even to contingent statements about particular\nfuture events or states of affairs. (The law of excluded middle says\nthat for a proposition, p, and its contradictory,\nnot-p, ‘(p or not-p)’ is\nnecessarily true, while bivalence insists that the truth table that\ndefines a connective like ‘or’ contains only two values,\ntrue and false.) Aristotle’s discussion in chapter 9 of On\nInterpretation of a hypothetical sea battle which either will or\nwill not happen tomorrow has traditionally been taken to deny this.\n(The proper interpretation of Aristotle’s position is in fact\ndisputed by scholars, but that need not concern us here.) Aristotle\nhad presented an argument that if it is either true or false\nnow that there will be a sea battle tomorrow (and let us\nsuppose for the sake of argument that it is false), then our present\ndeliberation about whether we should go out and fight tomorrow would\nbe pointless. After all, if it is already true now that there will be\nno battle, then whatever we decide, we won’t fight. This kind of\nreasoning seems to pose a threat to the meaningfulness of deliberation\nand it is reasoning that proceeds simply from considerations about the\nnature of propositions and their truth or falsity. The Stoic\nChrysippus seems to have connected this logically-motivated pathway to\nfatalism with the question of causal determinism (Cicero, 38G). He\ninsisted that if there was motion without a cause, it would mean that\nsome propositions would not be either true or false. But in fact,\nevery proposition is either true or false. So he concluded that there\nis no motion without a cause.  \nIt is one thing if our planning for tomorrow’s sea battle is\nrendered pointless by the fact that, as it turns out, there will be\nadverse winds that prevent us from rowing out to fight the enemy. The\nrational coherence of planning is not threatened by the fact that\nsometimes the pre-conditions for our plans to be set in motion do not\neventuate. That’s just life as a human being. It is quite\nanother if our deliberations are pointless because it is\nimpossible that there should be a sea battle tomorrow. People\nwho waste their breath debating what to do if 2+2=5 tomorrow seem to\nbe irrational. After all, it is impossible that 2+2 should equal 5 –\ntomorrow or any day! So what then would we say if we were persuaded\nthat all alternatives to what will actually happen in the future are\nsimilarly impossible? This would seem to pose a real threat to the\nrational coherence of planning. \nThe Stoics confronted a theory of modality (i.e. a theory of\npossibility and necessity) that claimed precisely this. Diodorus\nCronus of the Dialectical school had argued that what is possible is\nlimited to what either is or will be true at some point in the future\n(Boethius, 38C). So if we in fact don’t ever get around to\nrowing out to fight the Megarians in a sea battle, then a sea battle\nwith the Megarians was always impossible (and of course it made no\nmore sense to consider how we should go about it than it would be\nto consider how what we should do in the event that 2+2=5). The means by\nwhich Diodorus arrived at this most unwelcome account of modality was\ncalled the Master Argument. He endorsed the claim that (1) truths\nabout the past are necessary: it is not merely that they aren’t\nother than they are – they can’t be other than they are, for\nnothing has the power to change the past (Epictetus, 38A). He also\nclaimed that (2) nothing impossible follows from what is possible. In\nthe so-called Master Argument, he attempted to show that these two\ntheses were incompatible with the claim that (3) there is something\nwhich is possible, but yet does not happen. The details of the Master\nArgument are a matter of much dispute. We know that it was alleged to\nshow that these three propositions formed an inconsistent triad, but\nexactly how it did this remains uncertain. We also know that\nDiodorus’ manner of resolving this inconsistency was to reject\n(3) and to define the possible as that which is or will be the\ncase. \nThe Stoics felt the need to preserve the thesis that there are things\nwhich are possible but which do not happen. The same source that\npreserves the allegedly incompatible claims involved in the Master\nArgument tells us that the Stoics Cleanthes and Chrysippus did this in\ndifferent ways. While Cleanthes rejected (1), the necessity of the\npast, Chrysippus rejected (2) that what is impossible does not follow\nfrom what is possible, using the following example: consider the\nconditional “if Dion is dead, then this one is dead” when\nostensive reference is being made to Dion. The antecedent is possible,\nsince Dion will one day be dead. Hence, let us suppose it true. Then,\nby modus ponens, it follows that “this one is dead.”\nHowever, the proposition that “this one is dead” is\nimpossible (necessarily false), since one cannot make the requisite\nostensive reference to a dead man so as to make it true that\n“this one [i.e. the (living) thing I’m pointing to] is\ndead,” for a dead person isn’t the same thing as what was\nthere previously (Alex. Aph., 38F). This may appear utterly ad\nhoc to us, but it fits nicely with the Stoics’ views on\ndefinite or deictic propositions. It once again illustrates the\nsystematic character of Stoic philosophy. \nPerhaps the most famous topic considered under the Stoic heading of\nlogic is that of the criterion of truth and the Stoics’ disputes\nwith the skeptical New Academy about it. According to Chrysippus, the\ncriterion of truth is the ‘cognitive impression’\n(phantasia katalêptikê, lit. an impression that\nfirmly grasps its object) (Diog. Laert., 40A). A criterion or canon of\ntruth is an instrument for definitely determining that something is\ntrue, and the Hellenistic schools all provide some view on how it is\nthat we are to measure or evaluate whether something is true or not.\nThe Stoics’ cognitive impression is an impression which\n(according to Zeno’s definition, cf. Cicero, SVF I.59)\n“arises from that which is; is stamped and impressed in\naccordance with that very thing; and of such a kind as could not arise\nfrom what is not” (Sextus Empiricus, 40E). Recall that among the\npowers of the commanding faculty is the capacity to assent or withhold\nassent to impressions. The fact that it is always within our power to\nwithhold assent means that if we are sufficiently disciplined, we are\ncapable of avoiding error. In itself, it does not mean that we are\ncapable of attaining knowledge, for there might not be any impressions\nthat one can be confident in assenting to. The cognitive impression\nwas supposed to fill that role: when you experience one of these,\nprovided that you recognize it as such, you can, on its basis, assert\ndefinitely that the matter in question is true. It was initially\nsupposed that such an impression commanded one’s assent by its\nvery nature: it “all but seizes us by the hair” and drags\nus to assent. But this optimistic assessment seems to have been\nqualified in the face of criticism by members of the Skeptical\nAcademy – perhaps, even if there are such impressions, it is not\nso easy to be sure when one is experiencing one. \nHowever, the Stoics do not maintain that the mere having of a\ncognitive impression constitutes knowledge\n(epistêmê). Indeed, not even assent to\nsuch an impression amounts to knowledge. Such assent is merely\ncognition or grasp (katalêpsis) of some individual\nfact. Real knowledge (epistêmê) requires\ncognition which is secure, firm and unchangeable by reason (Sextus\nEmpiricus, 41C) – and, furthermore, worked into a systematic whole\nwith other such cognitions (Arius Didymus, 41H). Weak and changeable\nassent to a cognitive impression is only an act of ignorance. It is\nnot entirely clear where opinion or belief in general (doxa)\nstands in this categorization. Most Stoic sources define it as\n‘assent to the incognitive’ (i.e. to an impression that\ndoes not firmly grasp its object) (see Sextus Empiricus, 41E) but some\nsuggest that changeable assent to a cognitive impression might still\ncount as opinion. There is a potential for serious confusion when we\ntry to assimilate the Stoic view to contemporary epistemology. Modern\ndefinitions of knowledge make the agent’s belief that P a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for knowing that P. For the\nStoics, doxa (involving ‘weak’ assent) and\nknowledge are incompatible. In any event, there is an absolute\ndistinction between the wise and the ignorant. Only the Stoic\nsage’s assent to cognitive impressions clearly counts as\nknowledge for only a sage has the proper discipline always to avoid\nwithdrawing assent, or assenting to things that one shouldn’t.\nThe Stoics call this epistemic virtue ‘non-precipitancy’\n(aproptôsia) and it underlies their claim that the\nStoic sage never makes mistakes (41D). \nThe Skeptics responded by denying the existence of cognitive\nimpressions. According to Arcesilaus, “no impression arising\nfrom something true is such that an impression arising from something\nfalse could not also be just like it” (Cicero, 40D). So\nArcesilaus denies that the third conjunct of the Stoic definition of\nthe cognitive impression is ever satisfied. We can distinguish two\nspecific tactics for denying this. First, the Skeptics point to cases\nof insanity. In his madness, Heracles had the impression that his\nchildren were, in fact, the children of his enemy Eurystheus and\nkilled them. Since the impression must have been utterly convincing to\nhim at the time at which he had it (judging by his subsequent action),\nit is clear from this that there can be false impressions which are\nindistinguishable from ones that are allegedly “stamped and\nimpressed in accordance with that very thing” (Sextus Empiricus,\n41H). Their second line of attack was to draw attention to objects\nwhich are so similar as to be indistinguishable (so that a completely\naccurate impression from one would be indistinguishable from one from\nthe other). The story is related (Diog. Laert., 40F) that the Stoic\nphilosopher Sphaerus (a student of Zeno’s) was tricked into\nthinking that wax pomegranates were real. This was again supposed to\nshow that there could be impressions arising from what is not [sc. a\npomegranate] which are indistinguishable from a cognitive\nimpression. \nThe Stoics met these arguments by first pointing out that\nHeracles’ inability to distinguish cognitive from incognitive\nimpressions in his madness says nothing about the capacities of normal\nhuman beings. It is no part of their thesis that just anyone\ncan distinguish between cognitive and incognitive impressions. Their\nresponse to the second line of attack was two-fold. The first is a\nmetaphysically motivated answer: if any two objects really were\nindistinguishable, they would be identical. This doctrine has come to\nbe known as the identity of indiscernibles. They also replied that the\nStoic sage would withhold assent in cases where things are too similar\nto be confident that one had it right (Cicero,\n40I) – Sphaerus’ response to his predicament was to say that\nhe only assented to the proposition that it was\n‘reasonable’ that what he was presented with were\npomegranates (and that was true!). \nIn some ways, the Stoics have an easier time with skepticism abut\nknowledge than contemporary non-skeptics do. At bottom what the Stoics\nare committed to is the two-fold view that it is within our power to\navoid falling into error and that there is a kind of impression which\nreveals to us the world as it really is and which is different from\nthose impressions which might not so reveal the world. They are\nmanifestly not committed to defending our ordinary intuitions\nabout the range of knowledge: that most people in fact know most of\nthe things that they and everyone else thinks that they know. Recall\nour observations about the difference between knowledge considered as\na system of assents to cognitive impressions that is secure and\nunshakeable by reason and mere opinion – which may get matters right\nand may even involve assent to a cognitive impression, but still falls\nshort of knowledge. In short, the Stoics set the bar for knowledge\nvery high and were perfectly willing to accept that knowing was the\nexception, not the rule, in human affairs. The only person we can be\nsure has any knowledge is the Stoic sage and sages are as rare as the\nphoenix (Alex. Aph., 61N). Everyone else is equally ignorant. This\nabsolute distinction between the wise and the ignorant is a\nconsequence of the Stoic definition of knowledge as the\n“cognition which is secure and unchangeable by reason”\n(Arius Didymus, 41H). Either one’s cognition is like this or it\nis not. By making opinion a kind of ignorance (contrast Plato,\nRep V. 474a ff), they do not allow room for an intermediate\nstate between the wise man and all the rest of us. \nBut even if we leave aside the question of whether we in fact\nknow anything in the incredibly strong sense required for Stoic\nepistêmê, there are still some serious puzzles\nabout the cognitive impression. The Stoics insist that the cognitive\nimpression not only “arises from what is and is stamped and\nimpressed in accordance” with the thing from which it arises,\nbut also that it is “such as could not arise from that which is\nnot.” But it seems that we can imagine all kinds of situations\nin which we might be in a position where the sense impressions that we\nhave are indistinguishable from ones that misrepresent the world.\nThus, consider Descartes’ evil demon hypothesis or its modern\ncounterpart, the brain in a vat scenario. In the latter example it is\nstipulated that electrical stimulation of your brain by incredibly\nclever but unscrupulous scientists produces sense impressions that are\nindistinguishable from the ones that you are presently having. Surely\nhere we have a demonstration that there could not be a true impression\nwhich is such that it could not arise from what is not. No\nsane person thinks that these skeptical hypotheses are actually true.\nThe point is rather that if one of them were true, our sense\nexperience would be indistinguishable from what (we take to be) our\ntrue and accurate sense impressions of real tables, chairs and\nfireplaces. Doesn’t this show that there is no such thing as a\ncognitive impression? \nOne thing to note in passing is that skeptical scenarios like the evil\ndemon or the brain in the vat did not seem to figure in the debate\nbetween the Stoics and Skeptics. The Skeptics press the point that\nat the time the dream may be completely convincing to the\ndreamer, even if she does not believe that the events actually\ntranspired when she awakes (Cicero, Lucullus or\nAcademica II, 88). They do not consider thought experiments\nin which all our sense experience is systematically\nmisleading. But if we set this aside, there will still be one\nimportant difference between a clear and distinct impression that\narises from a real fireplace and one that arises from the manipulation\nof my neurons by unscrupulous brain scientists. The first is\ncaused by a fireplace, while the second is caused by some\nother means. When the Stoics say that a cognitive impression is\n“of such a sort as could not arise from what is not,” they\ncan be interpreted to mean simply that the true clear and distinct\nimpression will be different from a false one. Nothing said\nthus far by the skeptics rules out the possibility that we have a\nmechanism that has potential to become sensitive to these differences.\nThey might deny that the difference between the two is always\nsomething that can be discerned from the subject’s\npoint of view. We do not have a firmer means of knowing by virtue of\nwhich we check candidate impressions to see if they are really\ncognitive or not. Rather, we have the potential to increase our\nsensitivity to cognitive impressions when they are present. \nIf this is so, then the Stoics’ position would be somewhat akin\nto externalist theories of knowledge or justification. Externalists\ninsist that an agent might know a proposition or be justified in\nbelieving a proposition even when, nonetheless, the evidence for that\nbelief is not subjectively available to the person. So, on one early\nexternalist theory of knowledge, it was suggested that an agent might\nknow a certain sort of proposition (e.g. that there is a fireplace\nhere) if their belief that there is a fireplace here was caused by a\nreliable causal process (e.g. a normal visual system) – and not,\ne.g., by the interventions of wicked scientists fiddling with the\nsubject’s brain. Annas (1990) explores the possibilities for\nreading the Stoic view as a proto-externalist one. Perin (2005)\nconsiders the limitations of this reading. \nSo where does this leave the matter? If this is the right way\nto understand the definition of the Stoic cognitive impression, then\nit would seem that they win their argument with the Skeptics. Examples\nof false impressions that are subjectively indiscernible from clear\nand distinct, true, ones do not show that there are no cognitive\nimpressions. However, the admission that a cognitive impression might\nbe subjectively indistinguishable from a false impression does alter\nthe sense in which the cognitive impression can serve as a criterion\nof truth. Assent to a cognitive impression will guarantee that what\nyou assent to is true. But, because cognitive impressions can be\nindistinguishable from the subject’s point of view from false\nones, the Stoics can no longer say that even the sage can be confident\nthat what seems to be a cognitive impression actually is one. Thus\ninstead of automatically commanding assent, the cognitive impression\n(according to later Stoics) commands assent “if there is no\nimpediment” (Sextus Empiricus, 40K), and if it has been\nsuccessfully “tested” and is “irreversible”\n(cf. Sextus Empiricus, 69E). This means that I should only assent to\nwhat seems to me to be a cognitive impression if I have reason to\nbelieve that I’m not in a context where deceptive but convincing\nimpressions are possible. But the Stoic sage never errs. So when will\nI have absolutely compelling reasons to believe that I’m not\npresented with a convincing but deceptive impression? For these\nreasons, the Pyrrhonian skeptic Sextus Empiricus argues that the Stoic\nsage will never assent to any impression. In practice, he will suspend\njudgement, just like the Skeptic does (41C). Another suggestion is\nthat the Stoic sage hedges his bets by assenting only to the\nimpression that it is reasonable that there is fireplace here\n(as Sphaerus did about the pomegranates, 40F). In this case it will\nalso be hard to see how he differs from a skeptic who takes ‘the\nreasonable’ as his criterion (Sextus Empiricus, 69B). \nIn many ways, Aristotle’s ethics provides the form for the\nadumbration of the ethical teaching of the Hellenistic schools. One\nmust first provide a specification of the goal or end (telos)\nof living. This may have been thought to provide something like the\ndust jacket blurb or course description for the competing\nphilosophical systems – which differed radically over how to give\nthe required specification. \nA bit of reflection tells us that the goal that we all have is\nhappiness or flourishing (eudaimonia). But what is happiness?\nThe Epicureans’ answer was deceptively straightforward: the\nhappy life is the one which is most pleasant. (But their account of\nwhat the highest pleasure consists in was not at all straightforward.)\nZeno’s answer was “a good flow of life” (Arius\nDidymus, 63A) or “living in agreement,” and Cleanthes\nclarified that with the formulation that the end was “living in\nagreement with nature” (Arius Didymus, 63B). Chrysippus\namplified this to (among other formulations) “living in\naccordance with experience of what happens by nature;” later\nStoics inadvisably, in response to Academic attacks, substituted such\nformulations as “the rational selection of the primary things\naccording to nature.” The Stoics’ specification of what\nhappiness consists in cannot be adequately understood apart from their\nviews about value and human psychology. \nThe best way into the thicket of Stoic ethics is through the question\nof what is good, for all parties agree that possession of what is\ngenuinely good secures a person’s happiness. The Stoics claim\nthat whatever is good must benefit its possessor under all\ncircumstances. But there are situations in which it is not to my\nbenefit to be healthy or wealthy. (We may imagine that if I had money\nI would spend it on heroin which would not benefit me.) Thus, things\nlike money are simply not good, in spite of how nearly everyone\nspeaks, and the Stoics call them ‘indifferents’ (Diog.\nLaert., 58A) – i.e., neither good nor bad. The only things that\nare good are the characteristic excellences or virtues of human beings\n(or of human minds): prudence or wisdom, justice, courage and\nmoderation, and other related qualities. These are the first two of\nthe ‘Stoic paradoxes’ discussed by Cicero in his short\nwork of that title: that only what is noble or fine or morally good\n(kalon) is good at all, and that the possession (and\nexercise) of the virtues is both necessary and sufficient for\nhappiness. But the Stoics are not such lovers of paradox that they are\nwilling to say that my preference for wealth over poverty in most\ncircumstances is utterly groundless. They draw a distinction between\nwhat is good and things which have value (axia). Some\nindifferent things, like health or wealth, have value and therefore\nare to be preferred, even if they are not good, because they are\ntypically appropriate, fitting or suitable (oikeion)\nfor us. \nImpulse, as noted above, is a movement of the soul toward an object.\nThough these movements are subject to the capacity for assent in fully\nrational creatures, impulse is present in all animate (self-moving)\nthings from the moment of birth. The Stoics argue that the original\nimpulse of ensouled creatures is toward what is appropriate for them,\nor aids in their self-preservation, and not toward what is\npleasurable, as the Epicureans contend. Because the whole of the world\nis identical with the fully rational creature which is God, each part\nof it is naturally constituted so that it seeks what is appropriate or\nsuitable to it, just as our own body parts are so constituted as to\npreserve both themselves and the whole of which they are parts. The\nStoic doctrine of the natural attachment to what is appropriate\n(oikeiôsis) thus provides a foundation in nature for an\nobjective ordering of preferences, at least on a prima facie basis.\nOther things being equal, it is objectively preferable to have health\nrather than sickness. The Stoics call things whose preferability is\noverridden only in very rare circumstances “things according to\nnature.” As we mature, we discover new things which are\naccording to our natures. As infants perhaps we only recognised that\nfood and warmth are appropriate to us, but since humans are rational,\nmore than these basic necessities are appropriate to us. The Greek\nterm ‘oikeion’ can mean not only what is\nsuitable, but also what is akin to oneself, standing in a natural\nrelation of affection. Thus, my blood relatives are – or least\nought to be – oikeioi. It is partly in this sense that we\neventually come to the recognition – or at least ought\nto – that other people, insofar as they are rational, are\nappropriate to us. Cicero’s quotation of Terence’s line\n‘nothing human is alien to me’ in the context of On\nDuties I.30 echoes this thought. It is not only other rational\ncreatures that are appropriate to us, but also the perfection of our\nown rational natures. Because the Stoics identify the moral virtues\nwith knowledge, and thus the perfection of our rational natures, that\nwhich is genuinely good is also most appropriate to us. So, if our\nmoral and intellectual development goes as it should, we will progress\nfrom valuing food and warmth, to valuing social relations, to valuing\nmoral virtue. Ideally, we’ll have the recognition that the value\nthat moral virtue has is of a different order to those things that we\nwere naturally attracted to earlier. We then come to see that virtue\nis the only good. \nIs that all there is to Stoic ethics? Some writers, such as Annas\n(1993), suppose that Stoic moral philosophy largely floats free of\nStoic metaphysics, and especially from Stoic theology. Other writers,\nsuch as Cooper (1996, and 2012), suppose that Stoic moral philosophy\nis intimately intertwined with Stoic metaphysics. The latter reading\ndraws our attention to the fact that the unfolding of God’s\nprovidential plan is rational (and therefore beneficial) through and\nthrough, so that in some sense what will in fact happen to me in\naccordance with that plan must be appropriate to me, just like food,\nwarmth, and those with whom I have intimate social relations. \nWhen we take the rationality of the world order into consideration, we\ncan begin to understand the Stoic formulations of the goal or end.\n“Living in agreement with nature” is meant to work at a\nvariety of levels. Since my nature is such that health and\nwealth are appropriate to me (according to my nature), other things\nbeing equal, I ought to choose them. Hence the formulations of the end\nby later Stoics stress the idea that happiness consists in the\nrational selection of the things according to nature. But, we must\nbear in mind an important caveat here. Health and wealth are not the\nonly things which are appropriate to me. So are other rational beings\nand it would be irrational to choose one thing which is appropriate to\nme without due consideration of the effect of that choice on other\nthings which are also appropriate to me. This is why the later\nformulations stress that happiness consists in the rational\nselection of the things according to nature. But if I am faced with a\nchoice between increasing my wealth (something which is prima facie\nappropriate to my nature) and preserving someone else’s health\n(which is something appropriate to something which is appropriate to\nme, i.e. another rational being), which course of action is the\nrational one? The Stoic response is that it is the one which is\nultimately both natural and rational: that is, the one that, so far as\nI can tell from my experience with what happens in the course of\nnature (see Chrysippus’ formula for the end cited above, 63B),\nis most in agreement with the unfolding of nature’s rational and\nprovidential plan. Living in agreement with nature in this sense can\neven demand that I select things which are not typically appropriate\nto my nature at all – when that nature is considered in isolation\nfrom these particular circumstances. Here Chrysippus’ remark\nabout what his foot would will if it were conscious is apposite. \nWe too, as rational parts of rational nature, ought to choose in\naccordance with what will in fact happen (provided we can\nknow what that will be, which we rarely can – we are not gods;\noutcomes are uncertain to us) since this is wholly good and rational:\nwhen we cannot know the outcome, we ought to choose in accordance with\nwhat is typically or usually nature’s purpose, as we can see\nfrom experience of what usually does happen in the course of nature.\nIn extreme circumstances, however, a choice, for example, to end our\nlives by suicide can be in agreement with nature.  \nSo far the emphasis has been on just one component of the Stoic\nformulation of the goal or end of life: it is the “rational\nselection of the things according to nature.” The other thing\nthat needs to be stressed is that it is rational\nselection – not the attainment of – these things\nwhich constitutes happiness. (The Stoics mark the distinction between\nthe way we ought to opt for health as opposed to virtue by saying that\nI select (eklegomai) the preferred indifferent but I choose\n(hairoûmai) the virtuous action.) Even though the\nthings according to nature have a kind of value (axia) which\ngrounds the rationality of preferring them (other things being equal),\nthis kind of value is still not goodness. From the point of view of\nhappiness, the things according to nature are still indifferent. What\nmatters for our happiness is whether we select them rationally and, as\nit turns out, this means selecting them in accordance with the\nvirtuous way of regarding them (and virtuous action itself). Surely\none motive for this is the rejection of even the limited role that\nexternal goods and fortune play in Aristotelian ethics. According to\nthe Peripatetics, the happy life is one in which one exercises\none’s moral and theoretical virtues. But one can’t\nexercise a moral virtue like liberality (Nic. Eth. IV.1)\nwithout having some, even considerable, money. The Stoics, by\ncontrast, claim that so long as I order (and express) my preferences\nin accordance with my nature and universal nature, I will be virtuous\nand happy, even if I do not actually get the things I prefer. Though\nthese things are typically appropriate to me, rational choice is even\nmore appropriate or akin to me, and so long as I have that, then I\nhave perfected my nature. The perfection of one’s rational\nnature is the condition of being virtuous and it is exercising this,\nand this alone, which is good. Since possession of that which is good\nis sufficient for happiness, virtuous agents are happy even if they do\nnot attain the preferred indifferents they select. \nOne is tempted to think that this is simply a misuse of the word\n‘happiness’ (or would be, if the Stoics had been speaking\nEnglish). We are inclined to think (and a Greek talking about\neudaimonia would arguably be similarly inclined) that\nhappiness has something to do with getting what you want and not\nmerely ordering one’s wants rationally regardless of whether\nthey are satisfied. People are also frequently tempted to assimilate\nthe Stoics’ position to one (increasingly contested)\ninterpretation of Kant’s moral philosophy. On this reading,\nacting with the right motive is the only thing that is good – but\nbeing good in this sense has nothing whatsoever to do with\nhappiness. \nWith respect to the first point, the Stoic sage typically selects the\npreferred indifferents and selects them in light of her knowledge of\nhow the world works. There will be times when the circumstances make\nit rational for her to select something that is (generally speaking)\ncontrary to her nature (e.g., cutting off one’s own hand in\norder to thwart a tyrant). But these circumstances will be rare and\nthe sage will not be oppressed by the additional false beliefs that\nthis act of self-mutilation is a genuinely bad thing: only vice is\ngenuinely bad. For the most part, her knowledge of nature and other\npeople will mean that she attains the things that she selects. Her\nconditional positive attitude toward them will mean that when\ncircumstances do conspire to bring it about that the object of her\nselection is not secured, she doesn’t care. She only preferred\nto be wealthy if it was fated for her to be wealthy. These reflections\nillustrate the way in which the virtuous person is self-sufficient\n(autarkês) and this seems to be an important component\nof our intuitive idea of happiness. The person who is genuinely happy\nlacks nothing and enjoys a kind of independence from the vagaries of\nfortune. To this extent at least, the Stoics are not just using the\nword ‘happiness’ for a condition that has nothing at\nall to do with what we typically mean by it. With respect to the\nsecond point, the Stoic sage will never find herself in a situation\nwhere she acts contrary to what Kant calls inclination or desire. The\nonly thing she unconditionally wants is to live virtuously. Anything\nthat she conditionally prefers is always subordinate to her conception\nof the genuine good. Thus, there is no room for a conflict between\nduty and happiness where the latter is thought of solely in terms of\nthe satisfaction of our desires. Cicero provides an engaging, if not\naltogether rigorous, discussion of the question of whether virtue is\nsufficient for happiness in Tusculan Disputations, book\nV. \nHow do these general considerations about the goal of living translate\ninto an evaluation of actions? When I perform an action that accords\nwith my nature and for which a good reason can be given, then I\nperform what the Stoics call (LS) a ‘proper function’\n(kathêkon, Arius Didymus, 59B) – something that it\n“falls to me” to do. It is important to note that\nnon-rational animals and plants perform proper functions as well\n(Diog. Laert., 59C). This shows how much importance is placed upon the\nidea of what accords with one’s nature or, in another\nformulation, “activity which is consequential upon a\nthing’s nature.” It also shows the gap between proper\nfunctions and morally right actions, for the Stoics, like most\ncontemporary philosophers, think that animals cannot act morally or\nimmorally – let alone plants. \nMost proper functions are directed toward securing things which are\nappropriate to nature. Thus, if I take good care of my body, then this\nis a proper function. The Stoics divide proper functions into those\nwhich do not depend upon circumstances and those that do. Taking care\nof one’s health is among the former, while mutilating oneself is\namong the latter (Diog. Laert., 59E). It appears that this is an\nattempt to work out a set of prima facie duties based upon our\nnatures. Other things being equal, looking after one’s health is\na course of action which accords with one’s nature and thus is\none for which a good reason can be given. However, there are\ncircumstances in which a better reason can be given for mutilating\noneself – for instance, if this is the only way you can prevent\nFagin from compelling you to steal for him. \nSince both ordinary people and Stoic wise men look after their health\nexcept in very extraordinary circumstances, both the sage and the\nordinary person perform proper functions. A proper function becomes a\nfully correct action (katorthôma) only when it is\nperfected as an action of the specific kind to which it belongs, and\nso is done virtuously. In the tradition of Socratic moral theory, the\nStoics regard virtues like courage and justice, and so on, as\nknowledge or science within the soul about how to live. Thus a\nspecific virtue like moderation is defined as “the science\n(epistêmê) of what is to be chosen and what is to\nbe avoided and what is neither of these” (Arius Didymus, 61H).\nMore broadly, virtue is “an expertise (technê)\nconcerned with the whole of life” (Arius Didymus, 61G). Like\nother forms of knowledge, virtues are characters of the soul’s\ncommanding faculty which are firm and unchangeable. The other\nsimilarity with Socratic ethics is that the Stoics think that the\nvirtues are really just one state of soul (Plutarch , 61B, C; Arius\nDidymus, 61D). No one can be moderate without also being just,\ncourageous and prudent as well – moreover, “anyone who does\nany action in accordance with one does so in accordance with them\nall” (Plutarch, 61F). When someone who has any virtue, and\ntherefore all the virtues, performs any proper function, he performs\nit in accordance with virtue or virtuously (i.e. with all the virtues)\nand this transforms it into a right action or a perfect function. The\nconnection here between a perfect function and a virtuous one is\nalmost analytic in Greek ethical theorizing. Virtues just are those\nfeatures which make a thing a good thing of its kind or allow it to\nperform its function well. So, actions done in accordance with virtue\nare actions which are done well. The Stoics draw the conclusion from\nthis that the wise (and therefore virtuous) person does everything\nwithin the scope of moral action well (Arius Didymus, 61G). This makes\nit seem far less strange than it might at first appear to say that\nvirtue is sufficient for happiness. Furthermore, because virtue is a\nkind of knowledge and there is no cognitive state between knowledge\nand ignorance, those who are not wise do everything equally badly.\nStrictly speaking, there is no such thing as moral progress for the\nStoics (if that means progress within morality), and they\ngive the charming illustration of drowning to make their point: a\nperson an arm’s length from the surface is drowning every bit as\nsurely as one who is five hundred fathoms down (Plutarch, 61T). Of\ncourse, as the analogy also suggests, it is possible to be closer or\nfarther from finally being able to perform proper functions\nin this perfected way. In that sense, progress is possible. \nWe are finally in a position to understand and evaluate the Stoic view\non emotions, since it is a consequence of their views on the soul and\nthe good. It is perhaps more accurate to call it the Stoic view of the\npassions, though this is a somewhat dated term. The passions or\npathê are literally ‘things which one\nundergoes’ and are to be contrasted with actions or things that\none does. Thus, the view that one should be ‘apathetic,’\nin its original Hellenistic sense, is not the view that you\nshouldn’t care about anything, but rather the view that you\nshould not be psychologically subject to anything – manipulated\nand moved by it, rather than yourself being actively and\npositively in command of your reactions and responses to things as\nthey occur or are in prospect. It connotes a kind of complete\nself-sufficiency. The Stoics distinguish two primary passions:\nappetite and fear. These arise in relation to what appears to us to be\ngood or bad. They are associated with two other passions: pleasure and\ndistress. These result when we get or fail to avoid the objects of the\nfirst two passions. What distinguishes these states of soul from\nnormal impulses is that they are “excessive impulses which are\ndisobedient to reason” (Arius Didymus, 65A). Part of what this\nmeans is that one’s fear of dogs may not go away with the\nrational recognition that this blind, 16 year old, 3 legged Yorkshire\nterrier poses no threat to you. But this is not all. The Stoics call a\npassion like distress a fresh opinion that something bad is\npresent (Andronicus, 65B): you may have been excitedly delighted when\nyou first saw you’d won the race, but after a while, when the\nimpression of the victory is no longer fresh, you may calm down.\nRecall that opinion is assent to a false impression. Given the\nStoics’ view about good and bad, as against merely indifferent\nthings, the only time that one should assent to the impression that\nsomething bad is present is when there is something which might\nthreaten one’s virtue, for this and this alone is good. Thus all\npassions involve an element of false value-judgement. But these are\nfalse judgements which are inseparable from physiological changes in\nthe pneuma which constitutes one’s commanding faculty. The\nStoics describe these changes as shrinkings (like fear) or swellings\n(like delight), and part of the reason that they locate the commanding\nfaculty in the heart (rather than the head, as Plato in the\nTimaeus and many medical writers did) is that this seems to\nbe where the physical sensations which accompany passions like fear\nare manifested. Taking note of this point of physiology is surely\nnecessary to give their theory any plausibility. From the inside a\nvalue-judgement – even one like “this impending dog bite\nwill be bad” – might often just not feel like such an\nemotional state as fear. But when the judgement is vivid and so the\ncommanding faculty is undergoing such a change, one can readily enough\nsee that the characteristic sensations might inexorably accompany the\njudgement. \nAnother obvious objection to the Stoic theory is that someone who\nfears, say pigeons, may not think that they are dangerous. We\nsay that she knows rationally that pigeons are harmless but that she\nhas an irrational fear. It might be thought that in such a case, the\njudgement which the Stoics think is essential to the passion is\nmissing. Here they resort to the idea that a passion is a fluttering\nof the commanding faculty. At one instant my commanding faculty judges\n(rightly) that this pigeon is not dangerous, but an instant later\nassents to the impression that it is and from this assent flows the\nexcessive impulse away from the pigeon which is my fear. This switch\nof assent occurs repeatedly and rapidly so that it appears that one\nhas the fear without the requisite judgement but in fact you are\nmaking it and taking it back during the time you undergo the passion\n(Plutarch, 65G). \nIt is important to bear in mind that the Stoics do not think that all\nimpulses are to be done away with. What distinguishes normal impulses\nor desires from passions is the idea that the latter are excessive and\nirrational. Galen provides a nice illustration of the difference\n(65J). Suppose I want to run, or, in Stoic terminology, I have an\nimpulse to run. If I go running down a sharp incline I may be unable\nto stop or change direction in response to a new impulse. My running\nis excessive in relation to my initial impulse. Passions are\ndistinguished from normal impulses in much the same way: they have a\nkind of momentum which carries one beyond the dictates of reason. If,\nfor instance, you are consumed with lust (a passion falling under\nappetite), you might not do what under other circumstances you\nyourself would judge to be the sensible thing. \nEven in antiquity the Stoics were ridiculed for their views on the\npassions. Some critics called them the men of stone. But this is not\nentirely fair, for the Stoics allow that the sage will experience what\nthey call the good feelings (eupatheiai, Diog. Laert. 65F).\nThese include joy, watchfulness and wishing and are distinguished from\ntheir negative counterparts (pleasure, fear and appetite) in being\nwell-reasoned and not excessive. Naturally there is no positive\ncounterpart to distress. The species under wishing include kindness,\ngenerosity and warmth. A good feeling like kindness is a moderate and\nreasonable stretching or expansion of the soul presumably prompted by\nthe correct judgement that other rational beings are appropriate to\noneself. \nCriticisms of the Stoic theory of the passions in antiquity focused on\ntwo issues. The first was whether the passions were, in fact,\nactivities of the rational soul. The medical writer and philosopher\nGalen defended the Platonic account of emotions as a product of an\nirrational part of the soul. Posidonius, a 1st c. BCE Stoic, also\ncriticised Chrysippus on the psychology of emotions, and developed a\nposition that recognized the influence in the mind of something like\nPlato’s irrational soul-parts. The other opposition to the Stoic\ndoctrine came from philosophers in the Aristotelian tradition. They,\nlike the Stoics, made judgement a component in emotions. But they\nargued that the happy life required the moderation of the\npassions, not their complete extinction. Cicero’s Tusculan\nDisputations, books III and IV take up the question of whether it\nis possible and desirable to rid oneself of the emotions. \nThe ordinary Greek in the street may have had little idea of the views\nof Plato or Aristotle. The founder of the Stoic school, however, had a\nstatue raised to him in Athens at public expense, the inscription on\nwhich read, in part:  \nOf course the citizens of Athens couldn’t have honoured Zeno for\na life lived in consistency with his philosophical principles unless\nthe content of those principles was known to the general public. Since\nthe Stoics gathered, discussed and taught philosophy in a public\nplace, the general import of their philosophy was widely known.\nStoicism became a “popular philosophy” in a way that\nneither Platonism nor Aristotelianism ever did. In part this is\nbecause Stoicism, like its rival Epicureanism, addressed the questions\nthat most people are concerned with in very direct and practical ways.\nIt tells you how you should regard death, suffering, great wealth,\npoverty, power over others and slavery. In the political and social\ncontext of the Hellenistic period (where a person could move between\nthese extremes in very short order) Stoicism provided a psychological\nfortress against bad fortune. \nAt the political level, the Antigonid dynasty (which ruled Greece and\nMacedon from shortly after the death of Alexander to 168 BCE) had\nconnections with the Stoic philosophers. Antigonus Gonatas was alleged\nto have been a pupil of Zeno of Citium. He requested that Zeno serve\nas the tutor to his son, Demetrius, but Zeno excused himself on the\nground that he was too old for the job. The man he sent instead,\nPersaeus, was deeply involved in affairs at court and, according to\nsome sources, died in battle at Corinth in the service of Antigonus.\nAnother Hellenistic strong-man, Cleomenes of Sparta, had the Stoic\nphilosopher Sphaerus as one of his advisors. The reforms instituted in\nSparta (including the extension of citizenship to foreigners and the\nredistribution of land) were seen by some as a Stoic social reform,\nthough it is less clear that it was anything other than an instrument\nof power for Cleomenes. (For one view, see Erskine 1990 chapter 6; for\na more cynical view see Green 1990, p. 248 ff.) \nMiddle Stoicism is the term used to encompass the work of later Stoic\nphilosophers including Antipater of Tarsus (d. 130/129 BCE), Panaetius\n(d. 110/09 BCE), and Posidonius (d. ~45 BCE). Earlier scholarship on\nMiddle Stoicism tended to accentuate the degree of discontinuity\nbetween it and the “Old Stoa”. It is certainly true that\nthere was evolution in Stoic ideas with these philosophers and\ndisagreements with earlier Stoics. Thus, for instance, Antipater was\nmuch more positive about marriage and family than Chrysippus was. We\ncan, in many cases, attribute the Middle Stoa’s divergence from\nthe Old to a desire to amalgamate what these writers took to be\ncorrect in other philosophical schools. In particular, these Stoics\nlooked to Platonism and especially to Plato’s dialogue the\nTimaeus; cf. Reydams-Schils (1999). Panaetius denied the\nperiodic conflagration posited by earlier Stoic philosophers (Van\nStaaten, fr. 65). Posidonius, though he is wrongly reported by Galen\nto have returned to Plato’s tri-partite soul and to have\nrejected Chrysippus’ purely intellectualist theory of emotion\n(on this interpretation, see Sorabji 2000, 94ff), he did think it\nnecessary to acknowledge non-rational movements in the human soul\ncorresponding to Plato’s appetite and spirit (see Cooper 1999,\n449–84). In spite of these differences, however, in many other\nways the Middle Stoics remained, well, Stoics. \nOur evidence for the views of the philosophers of the Middle Stoa is\nrelatively fragmentary. The testimonia for Antipater were included in\nvolume 3 of von Arnim (1903–05). For Panaetius, see van Staaten\n(1962) and for Posidonius, see Edelstein and Kidd (1972). Panaetius\nhovers in the background of one of the most influential books in moral\nphilosophy up through the late 19th century: Cicero’s On\nDuties or De Officiis. In one of his letters to his\nfriend Atticus (XVI. 11.4) Cicero says that he based the first two\nbooks of his work on Panaetius’ treatise of the same name. It is\nperhaps on this basis that some interpreters have taken Middle Stoic\nmoral philosophy to be more “practical” than that of the\nOld Stoa, for On Duties concentrates on identifying proper\nfunctions in a context where it is clear we are not talking about the\ninfallible Stoic sage. But Sedley (in Inwood, 2003) correctly points\nout that any work on proper functions would have just such a focus.\nOur evidence may constitute an unrepresentative sample of\nPanaetius’ work in moral philosophy. \nIn 155 BCE Athens sent a delegation of three philosophers (Stoic,\nAcademic skeptic, and Peripatetic) on an embassy to Rome. Their\nteachings caused a sensation among the educated. The Skeptic Carneades\naddressed a crowd of thousands on one day and argued that justice was\na genuine good in its own right. The next day he argued against the\nproposition that it was in an agent’s interest to be just in\nterms every bit as convincing. This dazzling display of dialectical\nskill, together with the deep seated suspicion of philosophical\nculture, generated a conservative backlash against all Greek\nphilosophers led by Cato the Elder (234–149 BCE). By 86 BCE,\nhowever, Rome was ready to receive Greek philosophy with open arms.\n \nIt was natural that an ambitious and well off Roman like Cicero\n(106–43 BCE) should go and study at the philosophical schools in\nAthens and return to popularise Greek philosophy for his less\ncosmopolitan countrymen. Epicureanism tended to be favored in the\nranks in Rome’s military, while Stoicism appealed more to\nmembers of the Senate and other political movers and shakers. Several\nRoman political figures associated with Julius Caesar and the end of\nthe Roman Republic had assorted philosophical connections. Those\nassociated with Stoicism include Cato the Younger (95–46 BCE)\nand Marcus Junius Brutus (85–42). Brutus’ fellow assassin,\nand brother-in-law Gaius Cassius Longinus (85–42) professed\nEpicureanism.(See Sedley 1997 for an examination of their actions in\nlight of their philosophical allegiances.) Posidonius was known to\nJulius Caesar’s sometimes-ally, sometimes-adversary, Pompey\n(106–48). Pompey visited Posidonius in Rhodes during his\ncampaigns in 66 and 62 BCE. Gaius Octavius (who became Caesar\nAugustus) had a Stoic tutor, Athenodoros Calvus. \nIn contrast to the fragmentary evidence that we possess for the\nphilosophers of the Old and Middle Stoa, we have substantial writings\nfrom a number of Roman Stoic philosophers. Two of them wrote in Greek,\n Epictetus\n (circa 55–155 CE) and the Roman emperor\n Marcus Aurelius\n (121–180 CE), while the third wrote in Latin,\n Lucius Annaeus Seneca\n (4 BCE–65 CE). Other Roman Stoics whose works have not been so well\npreserved include Musonius Rufus (c. 25–90 CE) and Hierocles the\nStoic (c. 150 CE – not to be confused with the 5th century\nNeoplatonist of the same name who wrote a commentary on the\nps-Pythagorean ‘Golden Verses’).  \nIn spite of the fact that we have more evidence for these Roman\nStoics, scholarship has treated these philosophers – and\nparticularly Seneca – primarily as sources of evidence for early\nStoicism. Happily this situation has changed significantly over the\nlast decade so that Marcus Aurelius and Seneca are being read as\nthinkers in their own right. (Epictetus has always been treated\nsomewhat more seriously.) In what follows I will simply gesture toward\nsome of excellent work being done on Roman Stoicism. The detailed work\nof scholarship has shown the dangers of generalising about Roman\nStoicism in opposition to the original Stoic philosophy of Zeno,\nCleanthes and Chrysippus. In spite of this, it is perhaps not too rash\nfor the purposes of this encyclopedia entry to say the following: (1)\nEpictetus, Seneca and other Roman Stoics are less interested in what\nwe might call the metaphysical theory of the mind or soul in relation\nto the body and more interested in the psychological and moral\ncategory of the self. This is not to say that the Roman\nStoics retreat from the earlier Stoic materialism. It is rather that\nthey were more interested in notions that we might call self-hood or\npersonality. See Gill (2006) and, more broadly, Sorabji (2006). (2)\nThe Roman Stoics may or may not have resiled from the earlier absolute\ndistinction between the sage (who alone is wise, virtuous and happy)\nand everyone else (who are all equally ignorant, equally vicious, and\nequally unhappy). But, in any case, the writings that we have from\nthem show much more interest in the problems that confront the person\nwho is still making progress toward wisdom. The central theme of\nReydams-Schils (2005) is that their notion of the self provides the\nbridge between the ideal of the Stoic sage and the actual world of\nless-than-ideal communities and families. (3) While it seems unlikely\nthat any of the Roman Stoics retreated from the causal determinism and\ncompatibilism of the Old Stoa, they were much more interested in a\npsychological notion of freedom. This ideal of freedom stands in\nopposition, not to universal causation, but rather to a self-imposed\nslavery that is the result of taking external things to be genuine\ngoods. See Stephens (2007). (4) A significant portion of the writings\nof the Roman Stoics concern how one might move from the\nabstract recognition that, for instance, anger is a mistake to the\ncondition of being immune to anger. Recent scholarship has considered\nthese techniques, often under the label of ‘spiritual\nexercises’ For an example, see the careful reading of Marcus\nAurelius’ Meditations in Hadot (1998). Against the\nassimilation of Stoic techniques of emotional ‘therapy’ to\nChristian ‘spiritual exercises’, see Cooper 2012.) \nChristian writers were certainly receptive to some of the elements of\nStoicism. There exists an inauthentic correspondence between St Paul\nand Seneca included in the Apocrypha. This forgery is a very ancient\none, since it was referred to in both Jerome (de Viris\nIllustribus 12) and Augustine (Epistle 153.4). But the fact that\nthe letters were not written by Paul or by Seneca does not mean that\nPaul was unaware of Stoic philosophy, nor that his own thought may not\nbe understood in relation to Stoic naturalism. See Engberg-Pedersen\n2000. The tradition of theories of natural law in ethics seems to stem\ndirectly from Stoicism. (Compare Cicero, de Legibus I, 18\nwith later writers like Aquinas in Summa Theologica II, 2, q.\n94.) Augustine, alas, chose to follow the Stoics rather than the\nPlatonists (his usual allies among the philosophers) on the question\nof animals’ membership in the moral community (City of\nGod 1.20). Sorabji (2000), part IV argues that the Stoic idea of\nfreedom from the passions was adapted and transmuted into the idea of\nseven deadly sins by Evagrius. In general, see Colish (1985) for the\npresence of Stoicism in Latin writers through the sixth century. \nThe influence of Stoicism on Medieval thought has been considered by\nVerbeke (1983). In general, the handling of Stoic ideas in the context\nof Christian orthodoxy required a certain delicacy. While it was\nagreed by nearly all that God was not a material being, the state of\nthe human soul was a more controversial matter. In general, orthodoxy\nevolved away from materialist anthropology of the sort found in\nTertullian to the immaterialist notion of the soul that present-day\nChristians take for granted. Medieval Christians felt it necessary to\nreject what they called Stoic fatalism, but notions of conscience and\nnatural law had clear connections with Stoic thought. \nThe late 16th and early 17th centuries saw efforts to form a\nsystematic synthesis of Christianity and Stoicism. The most important\nfigure in the Neo-Stoic movement was\n Justus Lipsius\n (1547–1606). Lipsius has his own separate entry in the Stanford\nEncyclopedia, so I will not discuss him further. See also Cooper\n(2004). The influence of the Hellenistic schools generally on early\nmodern philosophy is the theme of the essays collected in Miller and\nInwood (2003). See also Osler (1991) and Strange & Zubek\n(2004). \nAcademic interest in Stoicism in the late 20th and early 21st century\nhas been matched by interest in the therapeutic aspects of the Stoic\nway of life by those who are not specialists in the history of\nphilosophy. There seem to be strong affinities between the central\nrole that Stoicism accords to judgement and the techniques of\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT. Among the most prominent (and\nhistorically grounded) is\n Stoicism Today\n which runs events such as Live Like a Stoic Week. Another modern\napplication of Stoicism is in the field of military ethics. See\nSherman (2005).","contact.mail":"dbaltzly@utas.edu.au","contact.domain":"utas.edu.au"}]
