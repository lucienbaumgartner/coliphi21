It has attracted more philosophical interest and provoked more philosophical controversy than any of the other traditionally recognized figures of speech.\n\n\n\nWhen we resort to metaphor, we contrive to talk about two things at\nonce; two different and disparate subject matters are mingled to rich\nand unpredictable effect.  One of these subject matters is already\nunder discussion or at least already up for consideration when a\nspeaker resorts to metaphor in the first place. This is the\nmetaphor’s primary subject or\ntenor: the young girl Juliet in the case of Romeo’s metaphor;\nhistory, Ireland’s history or the world’s, in the case of Stephen’s;\nworks, prose writings in general, in the case of Benjamin’s. The\nsecond subject matter is newly introduced with an eye to temporarily\nenriching our resources for thinking and talking about the first. This\nis the metaphor’s secondary subject or vehicle: the\nsun; nightmares from which one tries to awake; death masks, i.e.,\ndeath masks in general. The primary subject of a metaphor may be a\nparticular thing, or it may be a whole kind of thing, and likewise for\nthe secondary subject—with the result that the metaphor itself\nmay take the verbal form of an identity statement (X is Y) as\nwith Romeo; a predication or membership statement (X is a G)\nas with Stephen Daedalus; or a statement of inclusion (Fs are\nGs) as with Benjamin. \n\nIf we ask how primary and secondary subjects are brought into relation\nby being spoken of together in a metaphor, it seems natural to say\nthat metaphor is a form of likening, comparing, or\nanalogizing. The maker of a metaphor (or the metaphor itself)\nlikens the primary subject to the secondary subject: Romeo (or\nRomeo’s speech) likens Juliet to the sun, Stephen likens history\nto nightmares, Benjamin likens works in prose to death masks. But it is\nunclear what we mean when we say this, to the point where some are\nreluctant to appeal to likeness or similarity in explaining what\nmetaphor is or how it works. Much of the power and interest of many a\ngood metaphor derives from how massively and conspicuously different\nits two subject matters are, to the point where metaphor is sometimes\ndefined by those with no pretensions to originality as “a\ncomparison of two unlike things.” The interpretation of\na metaphor often turns not on properties the secondary subject actually\nhas or even on ones it is believed to have but instead on ones we\nhabitually pretend it to have: think of what happens when we call\nsomeone a gorilla. \n\nMetaphor is but one of many techniques, named and unnamed, for\nlikening one thing to another by means of words. We may employ an\nexplicit comparison of one thing to another, built around like,\nas, or some other explicit comparative construction, in\nwhat’s known as simile: \n\nWe may interweave parallel observations about two different subject\nmatters by means of so and too and thus. We\nmay liken a whole bunch of things to one another by making\nconspicuously parallel statements about each, inviting our listener to\nregister the parallelism and ponder its significance. Or we may simply\njuxtapose mention of a first thing with mention of a second in a\nsuitably conspicuous and suggestive manner: \n\nPart of what is distinctive about metaphorical likening in\nparticular is that in resorting to it, we speak of one thing or kind\n(the primary subject) as and in terms of a second\nthing or kind (the secondary subject). Our deployment of language\ntakes place as if primary subject and secondary subject\n(Juliet and the sun) were one and the same; or as if the\nprimary subject (history) were an instance of the secondary subject\n(nightmares); or as if the primary subject (works) were\nincluded within the secondary subject (death masks). In this sense,\nthe primary subject is spoken of as the secondary\nsubject. Words, idioms, and other ways of talking customarily deployed\nin connection with the secondary subject (the sun, death masks) are\nappropriated and redeployed for use in thinking and talking about the\nprimary subject (Juliet, prose works). In this sense, the primary\nsubject is spoken of and thought about in terms of the\nsecondary subject. It is easy to feel that in Romeo’s metaphor,\nfamiliar fragments of sun-talk come to be about Juliet without ceasing\nto be about the sun. If so, the double aboutness exhibited by\nmetaphorical language is something philosophers must strive to\nunderstand. \n\nA sentence metaphor typically likens many things or kinds to many\nother things or kinds at a single verbal stroke. Benjamin’s terse\nlittle aphorism manages to liken works to death masks, conceptions to\nliving human beings, the changes a conception undergoes before being\nincorporated into a finished work to life, the stabilization and\nstultification it allegedly undergoes after such incorporation to\ndeath—and so on. In the context provided by the rest of his\nspeech, Romeo’s exclamation manages to liken Juliet to the sun, her\nroom and balcony to the east, Romeo himself to creatures dependent on\nthe sun for warmth and light and nurturance, Romeo’s old love Rosaline\nto that lesser light the moon, the sight of Juliet to the light of the\nsun, Juliet’s appearance at her window as the sun’s rising in the\neast—and so on. Only some of a metaphor’s primary subjects and\nsome of its secondary subjects are explicitly referred to by any\nverbal expression contained therein. Listeners must work the others\nout for themselves. In this respect, every metaphor leaves something\nimplicit. \n\nNevertheless, some metaphors are explicit in the sense that\nthey liken one or more named things or kinds to one or more other\nnamed things or kinds by means of locutions regularly found in overt\nliteral statements of identity, membership, or inclusion: \n\nwhile other metaphors are implicit in that they eschew such\nsimple alignments, mingling primary subject language and secondary\nsubject language almost at random, yet in such a way as to leave\nlisteners able to work out which is which and what’s being likened to\nwhat else: \n\nWithin the confines of a given metaphor, we distinguish pretty readily\nbetween words and phrases that are to be taken metaphorically and\nothers that are to be taken only literally. To take an expression\nmetaphorically is one way to take it figuratively, and to take an\nexpression figuratively is to reinterpret it, to construe it\nin a manner that departs from but remains informed by some relevant\nprior literal construal of it. Various other kinds of figurative\nreinterpretation are exhibited in various other recognized figures of\nspeech: metonymy (This policy covers you from the cradle to\nthe grave), irony (You’re a fine friend),\nhyperbole (loud enough to wake the dead), and so on. \n\nThe portion of a\nmetaphor that undergoes figurative reinterpretation is its\nfocus and the rest is its frame. The focus of a\nmetaphor may be a single word drawn from almost any part of speech. It\nmay be a multi-word phrase like the sun or death\nmask. It may consist of scattered parts of an extended sentence,\nthe remainder of which is to be taken only literally: \n\nOr it may be an extended phrase, rich in internal syntactic\nstructure: \n\nPhilosophers need to elucidate (a) the nature of the difference\nbetween taking language literally and taking it metaphorically, the\nnature, if you will, of the reinterpretation language undergoes when\nwe take it metaphorically, and (b) the nature of the division of\nexpressive labor between a metaphor’s focus and its frame. \n\nLiterary theorists regularly acknowledge the existence of\nextended metaphors, unitary metaphorical likenings that sprawl\nover multiple successive sentences. There are also contracted\nmetaphors, metaphors that run their course within the narrow confines\nof a single clause or phrase or word. They reveal themselves most\nreadily when distinct metaphors are mixed to powerful,\ncontrolled, anything but hilarious effect: \n\nNot all sentence metaphors take the form of declarative sentences by\nany means: there are metaphorical questions, metaphorical commands,\nmetaphorical optatives, etc. Despite these complications, modern metaphor theory tends to treat the\nfreestanding declarative metaphorical sentence as the\nfundamental unit of metaphorical action. \n\nThis is a distinctively modern development. Ancient philosophers and\nrhetoricians viewed metaphor as a temporary self-explanatory change in\nthe usage of a general or singular term, typically a noun or\nnoun phrase. When we resort to metaphor, a term that routinely stands\nfor one thing or kind is made to stand for another, suitably related\nthing or kind instead, and this change in what the term stands for\noccurs on the fly, without warning and without special\nexplanation. The effect is to transfer the term in question\nfrom its accustomed place in our verbal classificatory scheme to\nsome other unaccustomed place for special temporary expressive\npurposes. For Aristotle, writing in the middle of the fourth century\nBCE, the figurative redeployment of term counts as a metaphor\nregardless of precisely how the term’s usual referent and its special\ntemporary referent are related (Poetics 21 1457b ff. See\nalso Rhetoric 3.2 1404b-1505b, 3.4 1406b–1407a,\n3.10–11 1410b–1413b). By the time Quintilian and Cicero\ncome along, metaphor is one of many distinct recognized figures of\nspeech, and a self-explanatory terminological transfer counts as\nmetaphorical only if it is based on a real or\nsupposed analogy or likeness between the regular\nreferent and the special temporary one. This matters less than one\nmight expect, since although Aristotle recognized four different kinds\nof metaphor, he regarded the analogy-based kind as far and away the\nmost interesting and devoted the bulk of his discussion to it. \n\nSometimes we resort to metaphor because there’s no established term\nfor the thing we want to talk about and no need to contrive a new term\nthat will refer to it once and for all. More often and more\ninterestingly, we resort to metaphor for the sake of the pleasure our\naudience will take in puzzling it out, the persona it allows us to\nadopt in addressing our audience, and the quasi-sensory vividness it\nbrings to the audience’s apprehension of whatever we say with its\nhelp. (See Cicero, De Oratore, 55 BCE,\n3.159–60) \n\nAristotle portrays the understanding of a simple metaphor as a\nstimulating exercise in analogical equation solving. Suppose\nEmpedocles employs the term ‘old age’ under circumstances\nwhere it looks for all the world as if what is really being discussed\nis the course of a single day. Old age itself lacks any\nimmediate bearing on efforts to understand the course of a single day,\nso we conjecture that on this special occasion, the term “old\nage” stands for something with the kind of immediate bearing on\nefforts to understand the course of a single day that old\nage itself has on efforts to understand some other\nsubject matter readily called to mind by invoking old\nage—namely, the course of a single human life. Just as\nold age constitutes the final stage of the course of a single life,\nwhat constitutes the final stage of the course of a single day\nis evening. Old age is to a life as evening is to a\nday. We thus infer that on this special occasion, “old\nage” is being employed to refer to evening, and we interpret the\nsentence in which it figures accordingly (Poetics 10\n1457b). \n\nIn working this out, we activate and begin to explore a complex and\npotentially fruitful analogy between the way a person’s physical and\nintellectual powers wax and wane over the course of a single human\nlife and the way the sun’s powers wax and wane over the course of a\nsingle day, between the way individual human lives repeat each other\nwith variations in the course of an extended human lineage and the way\nindividual days do so over the course of a year, and so on. The effort\nto recover a simple metaphorical meaning (evening) for the term\n“old age” calls forth a beneficial, pleasurable, complex\nintellectual effort from us. The sentence we thereby come to\nunderstand may say something simple and unambitious that could easily\nbe said without resorting to metaphor, but the effort to recover this\nmeaning has a cognitive value transcending that of the meaning itself.\nSomething happens to the terms on which we access our own thoughts\nabout days and how they run: evening is set before our eyes in the\nsuggestive and instructive guise of an elderly human being. For\ndiscussion see Ricoeur (1997, 9–43), Moran (1996), Halliwell\n(2003, 189–191). On ancient rhetoric and poetics more generally,\n see the entries\n Aristotle’s Rhetoric\n and\n Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry\nin this encyclopedia. \n\nAs modern poetics developed out of ancient rhetoric, the temptation to\nregard metaphors as meaning or communicating or at\nthe very least suggesting something inherently complex,\nopen-ended, and resistant to compact literal statement became stronger\nand stronger. \n\nSometimes the effort to render a given original in a given medium\nrequires approximation and elaboration of various sorts, so that any\nrendering of the given original in the given medium will be correct\nonly up to a point and incorrect thereafter (such is approximation)\nand more complex or longwinded than the thing rendered (such is\nelaboration). When this is the case we often call our renderings\nparaphrases of their originals. Sometimes originals and\nparaphrases are both verbal, and the aim of the paraphrase is to\nexplain or exposit the original: think of a lawyer’s paraphrase\nof an obscure statute or a preacher’s paraphrase of a cryptic\nBible passage. Sometimes neither original nor paraphrase is verbal and\nthe aim is to adapt the original in some sense or other: think\nof a polyphonic paraphrase by Palestrina of a snatch of medieval\nplainsong or the paraphrase of an acanthus leaf in the design of a\nCorinthian capital. \n\nThe effort to translate a literary work from one language to\nanother, to render the original work in a language not its own,\ninvolves a complex mixture of exposition and adaptation. Translational\nrendering is especially likely to resort to approximation and\nelaboration—paraphrase—when confronted by metaphors and\nother figures of speech. Yet it is often said that poetry is\nwhat’s lost in translation, to the point where Coleridge proposed\n“untranslatableness in words of the same language without injury\nto the meaning” as “the infallible test of a blameless\nstyle” (Biographia Literaria, chap. 22). If metaphor is\na form of poetry, it might seem to follow that paraphrase in words\nof the same language is impossible or uncalled for where metaphor\nis concerned. The American New Critic Cleanth Brooks argued as much in\na famous essay called “The Heresy of Paraphrase”\n(1947). \n\nNevertheless, there is a familiar way of registering how one takes or\nunderstands a given metaphor, naturally called paraphrase,\nsuch that dispensing with it entirely would condemn\narticulate consumers of metaphor to an unproductive silence. It is\nhard not to sympathize with Stanley Cavell when he writes in\n“Aesthetic Problems of Modern Philosophy” (1969): \n\nHe adds: \n\nPerhaps we can agree that explications of the sort Cavell has in mind\nexist and have some legitimate role to play in the understanding and\nappreciation of metaphor—and agree to call such\nexplications paraphrases—while agreeing to disagree\nabout how they relate to the language they purport to explain. \n\nThe mid twentieth century saw a striking renewal of interest in\nmetaphor theory, marked by interdisciplinary collaboration of a close\nand ongoing kind. Poets and novelists, linguists and literary critics,\nanalytic philosophers and continental philosophers all got in on the\nact and followed each other’s work with remarkable care and\ncloseness. Accounts of metaphor developed in this period fall into\nfour basic types. \n\nSemantic Twist Accounts hold that metaphor results from the\ninteraction or interanimation of words and word meanings as they are\nbrought together and act on each other in the settings provided by\nparticular utterances made on particular concrete occasions. \n\nWhen we take an uttered sentence as a metaphor, we assign it a new\nand distinctively metaphorical meaning. The assignment of\nfresh meaning to the sentence as a whole results from a more local\nassignment of fresh meaning to one or more of the sentence’s\nconstituent words or phrases, the ones we take metaphorically, the\nfocal words or phrases. The meanings assigned the remainder of\nthe sentence, the framing words or phrases, remain unchanged.\n(Here it’s taken for granted that whatever meanings may be, they\nobey a compositionality principle, according to which the\nmeaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its\nelementary components and the manner in which those components are\nwoven together by the complex expression’s syntax.) \n\nThe frame isn’t a passive bystander to changes in the\ninterpretation of the focus: it induces and controls these changes.\nWhen we attempt to take each and every part of the sentence in the most\nliteral and straightforward way possible, there proves to be something\ndeviant, incongruous, or otherwise out of order—something\nsemantically or pragmatically inappropriate, something incoherent at\nworst and strained at best—about how we must then take the\nsentence as a whole. If unstrained, coherent, contextually appropriate\nsense is to be made of the sentence as a whole, something’s gotta\ngive. What in fact does give is our straightforward\nliteral understanding of the focal expressions. The meanings of these\nexpressions undergo a metaphorical twist, a twist produced by\nthe more unyieldingly literal meanings of the expressions that serve as\nthe metaphor’s frame. \n\nMetaphor results from a kind of tension between the literal meanings\naccruing to the focus and the literal meanings accruing to the frame, a\ntension which disappears when we alter the meanings accruing to the\nfocus just enough to make it disappear. Paraphrase is an\neffort to re-express the new metaphorically determined sentence meaning\nin more literal or at least, less ambitiously metaphorical terms. Influential early semantic twist accounts were provided by I.A.\nRichards (1936), Max Black (1954), and Monroe Beardsley (1962). \n\nAn especially lucid and careful version is offered by\nthe literary scholar Harold Skulsky (1986, 1992). Skulsky maintains\nthat when a speaker speaks figuratively, he switches from ordinary\nvernacular English to an improvised dialect, a metaphorese,\nthat is richer than the vernacular in the speech act potentials it\naccords certain particular sentence forms, the meanings it accords\ncertain particular words or phrases, or both—a dialect the\nlistener must master on the spot and on the fly, treating the\nspeaker’s tiny specimen of correct usage as her main concrete\nguide to how it differs from the familiar vernacular. We have willful\nand challenging linguistic innovation on the part of a speaker,\nfollowed by a resourceful struggle to keep up on the part of a\nlistener, “a distinctive kind of cooperative activity halfway\nbetween a game and a rite” that requires and thereby elicits a\nspecial cognitive rapport between speaker and listener (1992, 24). \n\nFiguration occurs only when: \n\nMany schemes and tropes are such that the innovations they license at\na given point depend on what’s mutually understood to be the case for\npresent communicative purposes, what’s implicitly taken as true or at\nleast truistic, at the point where the innovation occurs. Any\nsuch assumption is what Skulsky calls a talk postulate.\nSomething may be a talk postulate because it’s so widely and firmly\nbelieved as to be obvious (and obviously obvious), or because we’re\nassuming it for the time being for purposes of argument, or simply\nbecause it’s something we routinely pretend to believe in particular\nconversational settings. The crucial points are three: \n\nThe conventional vernacular use of a declarative form like\n“You laughed” is to assert and thereby inform you that you\njust now did just that—laugh. But asserting this to you or\ninforming you of it is out of the question if you’ve just burst\nout laughing at a funeral; under the circumstances, your laughter\ncan’t conceivably come as news to you. A scheme, call it\nthe scheme of rebuke, enables me to use this sentence form in\na conventionally unconventional manner to blame you for your\nlaughter or scold you for your laughter when (and because)\ninforming you of it is manifestly out of the question. \n\nA trope, by contrast, is a recipe for turning out new word\nor phrase meanings when none of the vernacular ones will do. Hyperbole\nand metonymy may be understood as tropes in this sense, and so can\nmetaphor: \n\nHere being G is an implication of being F in a\nparticular conversational setting just in case it readily follows from\ntalk postulates conspicuously active there that whatever is F\nis also G. In the Macbeth case, whatever is a man is such that\nhe keeps track of injuries and is ready to avenge himself on those who\ninjure him whenever he can. The recipe for metaphor, then, might read\nsomething like this: \n\nPragmatic Twist Accounts maintain that when we resort to\nmetaphor, we use words and phrases with their standard literal meanings\nto say one thing, put one thing into words, yet we are taken\nto mean, taken to assert or acknowledge or otherwise indicate,\nsomething entirely different. Our sentence as used by us means one\nthing, we in using it mean or are properly construed as meaning\nsomething entirely different. Metaphor is a genre of deliberate and\novert suggestion, one by means of which speakers commit themselves\nto, implicitly vouch for the truth of, the things they\nsuggest. Paraphrase is an effort to get at what is metaphorically\nsuggested by putting it (or some part of it, or some approximation to\nit) directly into words, thereby explicitly saying (more or less fully\nand more or less accurately) what was implicitly vouched for by\nthe original metaphorical utterance. \n\nThe thought that metaphor concerns what speakers mean as\nopposed to what their words mean is old and widespread. Often\nit comes with the further thought that metaphor reveals by\nconcealing—revealing things in the end by concealing them at the\noutset. \n\nThe first concerted attempt to build a philosophical account of\nmetaphor around these familiar ideas was Grice’s account of\nconversational implicature in the second of his 1967 William James\nLectures, which appeared with various supplementations and\nafterthoughts as Grice (1989). \n\nThe following exposition lightly modernizes Grice’s own at\ncertain points. For fuller discussions of Grice’s work as a whole\nsee the entries concerning \n Paul Grice, \n implicature, \n and\n pragmatics. \nDetailed elaborations of Grice’s account of metaphor were\noffered by Searle (1979a) and Martinich (1984). \n\nA conversation is a loosely collaborative exchange of\ninformation having one or more mutually understood aims. Participants\npresume they share certain pertinent information already, but each is\npresumed to need further information the others might be in a position\nto provide. In conversations we can and regularly do hold the other\nparticipants responsible for the truth of both more and less—in\nsome ways more, in other ways less—than they explicitly put into\nwords. For once a conversation is under way, each of us is entitled to\ninterpret the words of the others in light of the supposition that\nthey are cooperative, rational, and unconfused about the current state\nof conversational play, even if there is good reason to doubt or\ndisbelieve this supposition, e.g. even if they exhibit troubling\nsigns of recklessness or deceitfulness. This is an application to\nspeech of a much more general principle: in improvised voluntary\ncollaborations of any sort, the responsibilities a given party\nshoulders are those he willingly lets himself seem ready to shoulder,\nno more and no less. \n\nSo my words may imply something I don’t: if something my words\nimply is manifestly so firmly accepted already as to need no\ncertification from me, or so firmly rejected or patently unknowable by\nme as to be unable to benefit from any certification I might attempt,\nit forms no part of what I commit myself to in speaking my words. On\nthe other hand, I may imply something my words don’t: I can\nand do vouch for the truth of a thing that isn’t implied by the\nwords I speak when my audience can square my utterance of those words\nwith the supposition that I am cooperative, rational, and unconfused\nabout the state of conversational play only by assuming that I am in a\nposition to vouch for that thing’s truth (in that I believe it\nand have good grounds for believing it) and am prepared to actually do\nso. Such, nearly enough, was how Grice defined the special kind of\nspeaker meaning he dubbed conversational implicature. \n\nThis tells us what implicature is but not how it happens. For that\nwe need four more ideas. (1) Declarative sentences are standing\nequipment for calling attention to the propositions they express: the\nproposition an uttered sentence calls to mind most immediately,\nreliably, and deliberately is the one it semantically expresses. (2)\nOnce a conversation is under way I can vouch for the truth of any\nproposition whatsoever by calling attention to it with a sufficient\nshow of deliberateness, if I am plausibly in a position to\nvouch for its truth and if no other plausible motive for\ncalling attention to it can be expected to come to mind. (3) Suppose I\ncall attention to a thing of any sort with a sufficient show\nof deliberateness. If the thing strikes my audience as a fully\nappropriate object of attention in its own right, their attention will\ndwell on it and go no further; they’ll treat my drawing their\nattention to it as an end in itself, as it were. But if the thing\ndoesn’t strike them as an appropriate resting place for\ntheir attention, they’ll view my drawing their attention to it as\na means to some further attentional end, an effort to refer attention\nonward to some further, ultimately more worthy object. (4) What a\ncooperative, rational, unconfused speaker is out to vouch for as\ntrue in speaking as she does includes both what she is out to\nget across, the part expected to address her listener’s\npresumed informational needs, and a rudimentary rationale for\nspeaking as she does, serving to reconcile the words she produces\nwith the supposition that she is cooperative, rational, and unconfused.\nFor without a reputation for being cooperative, rational, and\nunconfused, a speaker simply won’t be able to collaborate\neffectively with her audience. Of course, parts of what she is out to\nvouch for may do double duty, meeting the listener’s\ninformational needs while at the same time helping to preserve or\ncultivate her own reputation. \n\nSo: if she is cooperative, rational, and unconfused, a speaker does\nher best to endow her contribution—the content she is\nout to vouch for, the part of that content she is out to get across,\nand the verbal form she employs for these purposes—with certain\nfeatures that are manifestly desirable from her listener’s point of\nview. She does her best to comply with certain\nfamiliar conversational maxims: \n\n(The maxims concern characteristics that are matters of degree, so\nthe best way to read them is a matter of some controversy. On the\ninterpretation adopted here, I obey Relation if and only if what I am\nout to get across is both (a) adequately relevant and (b) about as\nrelevant as I can readily make it without sacrificing anything of\ncomparable importance. Similarly for the other maxims. On this\ninterpretation, Gricean maxims don’t call on us to maximize\nanything.) \n\nListeners know that cooperative, rational, unconfused speakers do\ntheir best to comply with the maxims. So speakers can arrange\nfor a difference between what they express and what they are properly\ntaken to vouch for by speaking so as to put their reputation for\ncooperativeness, rationality, and unconfusedness in a kind of\ncontrolled short-term jeopardy from which their listeners can readily\nrescue them. \n\nSuppose speaker S expresses proposition P in words\nW. And suppose circumstances are such that if we\nwere to understand S as out to vouch for the truth\nof P and\nP alone, no more and no less, in uttering W, we would\nthereby portray S as avoidably violating maxim M or\nat least, avoidably inviting the suspicion that she is avoidably\nviolating it, with the consequence that either her contribution is\ngratuitously unresponsive to her audience’s informational needs\nor she is gratuitously neglecting to maintain her reputation as\ncooperative, rational, and unconfused. In either case, she\nwouldn’t be behaving as a cooperative, rational, unconfused\nspeaker must. To clear her her of this charge, to square our\ninterpretation of her words with the governing supposition that\nshe is behaving as a cooperative, rational, unconfused\nspeaker must, we need to find something more or\nsomething else she might be out to vouch for. \n\nFour basic scenarios are possible here. \n\n(1) Sometimes P and P alone is what S is\nout to get across, despite the fact that getting P and\nP alone across by means of W manifestly violates\nsome particular maxim. In that case S may be designedly\ncalling attention to, hence trying to vouch for the truth of, some\nplausible account of why her informational and expressive resources\nleave her in a position where some such violation couldn’t be\nhelped—confront her with a clash of maxims. \n\n(2) Sometimes getting P and P alone across by means\nof W would manifestly violate some maxim or other if\nS were in a position to vouch for any of various manifestly more\ndesirable propositions by expressing one of them via any of various\nmanifestly available sequences of words. In that case S may\nbe designedly calling attention to, hence trying to vouch for the\ntruth of, some plausible account of why she couldn’t do this—why\nher respect for the maxims actually puts each of these more\ndesirable-looking contributions off limits. \n\n(3) Sometimes the expression of P by means of W\nwould manifestly violate some particular maxim if P and P\nalone were what S was out to get across, but the natural\ninference is that what she was out to get across was P and then\nsome: the expression of P by means of W readily\ncalls to mind some unique more inclusive story Q about the\nworld of which P forms an essential part, such that S\nmight plausibly be in a position to vouch for Q’s truth and\nsuch that doing so by means of W, if it could be\nmanaged, might plausibly comply with all the maxims. In that case\nS may be designedly calling attention to, hence trying to vouch\nfor the truth of, the whole of Q. \n\n(4) Last but not least, sometimes the expression of P by\nmeans of W would manifestly violate some particular maxim if\nP formed any essential part of what S was\nout to get across, and the natural inference is that what she was out\nto get across is something entirely different: the expression\nof P by means of W readily calls to mind some unique\nalternative message Q about the world of which P\nforms no part whatsoever, such that S might plausibly be in a\nposition to vouch for Q’s truth and such that doing so by\nmeans of W, if it could be managed, might plausibly\ncomply with all the maxims. (Such is the residual force of the idea\nthat verbal expressions of P are equipment for\nasserting P that S will still be viewed as vouching\nfor the truth of P as well unless doing so is manifestly out\nof the question in the circumstances at hand, as it often will\nbe. What she won’t be vouching for is P’s\nvalue or interest in the light of her\nlistener’s presumed informational needs.) \n\nWhen such a Q readily comes to mind, S may be\ndesignedly calling attention to, hence trying to vouch for the truth\nof, Q. In such a case, S is enabled to fulfill a\nconversational maxim (by meaning something other than what she\nactually expresses) precisely by speaking in such a way that she would\nflout the maxim, blatantly violate it, if she were to mean what she\nsays. Grice speaks in such cases of exploiting the maxim in\nquestion. To exploit a maxim is to fulfill it “at the level\nof” what one means by manifestly and avoidably violating\nit—flouting it—“at the level of” what one\nexpresses. \n\nThere are two main ways to play out this scenario. \n\nOn the first, Q admits of intelligible and compact expression\nbut is something the speaker is understandably reluctant to assert\noutright. The notorious letter of recommendation example is of this\nkind. \n\nOn the second, Q is so extensive or so resistant to\nintelligible compact expression for other reasons that the benefits to\nspeaker and listener alike of a terse and simple utterance outweigh\nthe inferential costs to the listener involved in extracting a large\nmessage from a small package. This is often the case with allusions,\nfor instance. Where outright explicit assertion can’t be managed or\ncan be managed only with excessive effort on both sides, suggestion\nhas to suffice and will violate no general conversational norms. \n\nGrice proposes that metaphor exemplifies this second playing out of\nthe flouting scenario. Suppose I say to you, “you’re the cream\nin my coffee.” No human being literally is or literally could be\na dollop of viscous potable dairy product I could literally stir into\na piping hot breakfast beverage. This is a commonplace your acceptance\nof which isn’t about to be shaken by any words from me. So for you to\ntake me as out to get that across, alone or in combination\nwith other things, would be for you to take me to be “blatantly\nand inexplicably” violating Quantity (and/or Relation); you’d be\nportraying me as being utterly, obviously, and to all appearances\npointlessly untruthful, uninformative, and irrelevant. But in\ncircumstances such as these, the proposition that you’re the cream in\nmy coffee reliably calls to mind a certain particular other\nproposition, “attributing to [you] some feature or features in\nrespect of which [you] resemble (more or less fancifully) the\nmentioned substance.” Perhaps it’s the proposition that you’re\nsuch a comforting luxury (for me) that you’ve become a necessity (for\nme) for most intents and purposes—a proposition whose explicit\nexpression is regrettably clumsy and longwinded and ungenerous. (In\nfact the 1924 DeSylva, Brown, and Henderson lyric Grice is quoting\nfrom continues as follows: “You’re the cream in my coffee, /\nYou’re the salt in my stew, / You will always be / My necessity, / I’d\nbe lost without you…”) The only obvious reason I could\nhave for calling your attention to this proposition in these\ncircumstances is in order to get it across and hence, vouch for its\ntruth. So I do vouch for its truth. \n\nBy speaking of “more or less fanciful resemblance,”\nGrice reinstated the ancient idea that metaphor is a special figure\nbased in some special way upon likeness or analogy. Subsequent\nadvocates of an implicature approach to metaphor were sometimes\nskeptical about this feature of the account. Searle, for instance,\nfound it hard to see any real resemblance between literally cold things\nand metaphorically cold people. After starting a long list of possible\nrelations between what a metaphorical speaker says about an object and\nwhat she should be taken to mean, he despairs of completing\nit: \n\nThis registers an important general fact about pragmatic\nexplanations in the Gricean style. Conversational implicatures can come\noff only if something in particular reliably comes to mind once there\nis an appearance of a maxim violation to explain or explain away. Often\nenough, something in particular does reliably come to mind,\nbut Gricean conversational principles in and of themselves do nothing\nto explain what comes to mind or why it does\nso. \n\nOne and the same metaphor can often be plausibly paraphrased in\nsubstantively different ways. Yet Grice’s account appears to\ndepend on there being some unique alternative message that\nreliably comes to mind when the speaker’s words are pondered. It\nhas struck some commentators that metaphorical interpretation involves\na kind of indeterminacy Gricean implicature theory can’t\nreadily accommodate. See Davis (1998), 70–74 and the response by Saul\n(2001) for the main arguments on both sides. \n\nThere is also the phenomenon of twice-apt metaphor (Hills,\n1997, 2008). Consider Romeo’s death speech: \n\nWho’s the true apothecary? The impoverished pharmacist who\nsold Romeo the poison, or death itself? Both, surely. From time to time\nwe are induced to construe one and the same utterance both\nliterally and metaphorically. In such cases an utterance is\nalready apt, already in complete accord with\npertinent conversational norms, when regarded as an effort to mean what\none says, no more and no less. Yet a metaphoric reconstrual of the\nutterance comes to mind anyway, without the spur of any\nthreatened impropriety in the initial literal construal on which it is\nbased, and listeners view the speaker as vouching for the truth of both\nconstruals at once. \n\nDeterminacy worries help motivate one influential and sweeping\nreworking of Gricean pragmatics, the relevance theory of\nSperber and Wilson (1995, also Wilson and Sperber 2002). In an early\nand somewhat simplified formulation (Sperber and Wilson 1985),\nrelevance theory takes metaphor to be an especially dramatic form of\nloose talk and takes talk in general to be at least somewhat loose most\nof the time. What is meant typically departs from what is said, to the\npoint where all a speaker ever commits herself to in\nexpressing a proposition is a noteworthy interpretive\nresemblance between this proposition and the one whose truth she\nis out to vouch for. (Two propositions bear an interpretive resemblance\nto one another in a given setting to the extent that they have similar\nconsequences, given whatever is mutually taken for granted in that\nsetting.) And speakers can anticipate what competent listeners will\ntake them to mean only up to a point. What they can most firmly\nanticipate being taken to mean is strongly implied by their\nutterance, what they may or may not be taken to mean, depending on\nfacts about the listeners they aren’t in a position to know, is\nonly weakly implied. The result is that what’s meant by\nan utterance, what the speaker vouches for in speaking as she does,\nisn’t sharply delimited but trails off, in much the way that good\nparaphrases typically trail off. \n\nWhen a listener L provisionally decides that\nutterance U is worth processing, he goes into the deductive\ninference business in the following highly specific manner: \n\nIn the former case, where L does eventually feel adequately\ncompensated for his processing of U, he stops processing\nU at this break-even point and takes U to properly\nconvey the consequence set C. In the latter\ncase, L doesn’t treat U as properly conveying\nanything at all. \n\nIn general C will be in some ways\nstronger, in other ways weaker, than U itself. In some ways\nstronger, since auxiliary hypotheses have got in on the act. In other\nways weaker, since various parts of U’s own content that\nhave been judged to be old news, obviously false, or simply not worth\nattending to have fallen by the wayside. \n\nSuppose this is how listeners always process utterances.\nThen to the considerable extent that speakers can anticipate the course\nof such processing (what will get added to the premise set, what\nconsequences will get drawn, what will get discarded along the way,\nwhere the break-even point will be reached), speakers can anticipate\nwhat listeners will make of their words. Yet they can’t\nanticipate the course or extent of listeners’ processing in\ncomplete detail, with the result that their responsibility for what a\nlistener makes of their words, the degree to which they can be said to\nhave vouched in advance for the results of the listener’s\nprocessing, trails off as this processing continues. Sperber and Wilson\ncontend that this processing model accounts for standard Gricean\nimplicatures, metaphors included, without requiring the\nlistener to reconstruct the speaker’s precise rationale for\nspeaking as she did and without a rich and contentious set of\nconversational norms. \n\nBut why should we believe that this is how listeners always\nprocess inferences? \n\nFirst, it is a general principle of human cognition (and one whose\ntruth we all implicitly recognize) that our attention always goes to\nwhatever stimulus in our environment (if any) looks to be most worth\nprocessing then and there, whatever looks then and there to be\n“optimally relevant” (if anything does). A stimulus counts\nas just plain relevant if it’s worth processing at all, and how\nrelevant or worth processing a stimulus actually is depends jointly on\ntwo things about it: \n\nThe processing of any stimulus takes the form of extracting more and\nmore remote consequences from the conjunction of it with less\nand less antecedently salient, less and less antecedently\ntaken-for-granted, auxiliary assumptions. Such is the Cognitive\nPrinciple of Relevance. \n\nSecond, in claiming the attention of a listener at all, a speaker\nimplicitly assures him that the stimulus she’s offering him is\nrelevant and indeed optimally relevant—the most relevant\nstimulus within reach. (In view of the Cognitive Principle, he\nwouldn’t process her utterance unless he took it to be the most\nrelevant stimulus within reach, so to induce him to process it, she\nmust get him to take it to be the most relevant stimulus within reach.)\nSuch is the Communicative Principle of Relevance. \n\nFrom these principles, Sperber and Wilson deduce two key\ncorollaries: \n\nIf we grant both (I) and (II), then we have at once a story about\nwhy listeners process utterances as relevance theory claims and a story\nabout why speakers implicitly vouch for the results of such processing,\ninsofar as these results are foreseeable. In claiming the attention of\nL for my utterance U, I’m implicitly vouching\nfor the truth of whatever I can expect L to come up with if he\nprocesses U the way he’d process any promising stimulus\nand continues to do so until it yields a result that adequately repays\nhis investment of effort to date. But this is all I implicitly vouch\nfor in speaking as I do. After that, the listener is on his own. \n\nThe trickiest part of this is the argument for (II). Suppose some\nsignificant part of the consequence set C\nthat L can be expected to extract from U is either\n(undetectably) false or (undetectably) undeserving of\nL’s attention. This would detract in a very substantial way\nfrom the relevance of U: falsity of the part detracts very\nsubstantially from overall truth, and lack of pertinence in the part\ndetracts very substantially from overall pertinence. So\nsubstantially, in fact, that S will almost always have\navailable to her some other utterance U* the\nprocessing of which would have yielded L more in the way of\noverall pertinent truth than U does—even if we make\nallowances for motives S may have to conceal part of what she\nknows from\nL. If this is the case, then U will scarcely be\noptimally relevant, the most relevant stimulus within reach,\nsince U* is more relevant and it’s\ndefinitely within reach as well. \n\nIt’s possible to suspect that this argument equivocates in its\nfinal stages. Until then, “U is optimally\nrelevant” appears to mean: \n\nThis is what S implicitly claims in inviting L to\nattend to her utterance. Yet in those final stages, “U\nis optimally relevant” needs to mean instead: \n\nAncient Greek poetry was rich in extended explicit\ncomparisons—similes—of the sort we now call epic\nor Homeric. At Iliad 20.164–73, Aeneas is\nbearing down on Achilles when the roles of attacker and attacked are\nabruptly reversed; this is a literal rendering from (Stott, 2006): \n\nAncient rhetoricians would maintain that Homer’s simile and a\nmetaphor employing the epithet “the lion” so as to\nmanifestly refer to the man Achilles are alike in that they make or\npresent one and the same comparison, each in its own way: both bits of\nlanguage compare Achilles to a lion. Aristotle goes\non to contend that “similes are metaphors needing an explanatory\nword” (Poetics 1407a)—as if the difference\nbetween the “The lion [Achilles] rushed” (metaphor) and\n“He [Achilles] rushed as a lion” (simile) came down to the\npresence in the latter of a stage direction indicating that Achilles\nwent on the attack in the guise of a lion. A simile is thus a\nlengthened metaphor. Quintilian turns things round, speaking of\nmetaphors as shortened similes: \n\nLike his fellow ancients, Quintilian conceived metaphor as an affair\nof terms rather than as an affair of sentences. A metaphorical\nemployment of the term “lion” to refer to the man Achilles\ndoesn’t say that Achilles is like a lion, since it\ndoesn’t say anything at all. Namings aren’t\nsayings; they merely pave the way for sayings. What Quintilian meant,\nthen, is that a simile states the real or alleged similarity\n(of Achilles to lions) which the corresponding metaphorical\nsubstitution leaves to a listener’s imagination. \n\nOnce we come to view the sentence as the fundamental unit of\nmetaphorical action, Quintilian’s remark suggests something to us\nthat it couldn’t suggest to Quintilian himself: what a simple\nsentence metaphor (Juliet is the sun, History is a\nnightmare) really says is that Juliet is like the\nsun, history like a nightmare—where the extent and\nnature of the alleged likeness are things listeners must infer from the\nconcrete conversational setting in which the metaphor is employed. It\nsuggests that a sentence metaphor is an elliptical simile, a figurative\ncomparison whose key comparative construction is understood to be\npresent but remains unpronounced. Some such comparativist account of\nmetaphor has been proposed from time to time by modern critics\n(Nowottny, 1962) and by modern linguists (Ortony, 1979). \n\nAn especially detailed version was developed by\nRobert Fogelin (1998) from suggestions by Amos Tversky (1977). \n\nFor Fogelin, to speak figuratively is to speak so as to\nstand corrected, to speak so as to manifestly invite and reliably\nelicit some particular spontaneous correction from one’s\naudience. This is easiest to see and easiest to understand when it\ncomes to figurative predications, e.g. instances of irony or\nunderstatement. In such cases correcting the speaker consists\nin correcting what she said by understanding her to have said\none thing while meaning another. Listeners take the speaker’s\nactual words and edit them in the privacy of their own heads, thereby\nbringing her utterance into accord with the context in which she spoke\nthem as called for by Gricean conversational principles. When a speaker\nindulges in understatement, correction of what she says involves\nstrengthening it; when she indulges in irony, our correction involves\nreversing it (in some sense or other, the nature of the reversal\nvarying from case to case), and so forth. Often the value and interest\nof a thought is enhanced by the listener’s coming up with it for\nhimself and deciding for himself that it is appropriate to the\ncircumstances in which he finds himself. Figurative predication is one\nway to impose these tasks on a listener; that’s one of our main\nreasons for resorting to it. \n\nWhether it is to be taken literally or figuratively, an\nunqualified simple comparison \n\nis to be understood as saying that (an) A has enough of the\nfeatures of (a) B that are salient in the present context. Or\nif you prefer, (an) A is similar enough to (a) B in\nrespects that concern aspects of (a) B that\nare salient in the present context. What counts as enough in\nthe way of shared salient B-features or enough in the\nway of similarity to B in salient B-respects depends\nin turn on the contextually salient interests or concerns that are\nunderstood to motivate the making of the comparison in the first place.\nSo whether they are to be taken literally or figuratively, unqualified\nsimple comparisons have highly context-sensitive truth conditions. \n\nFogelin follows Tversky in supposing that when we compare (an)\nA to (a) B, it is the currently salient features or\naspects of the second thing or kind of thing that call the\ntune. This represents a break with how likeness or resemblance or\nsimilarity has usually been construed in the philosophical\nliterature—viz., as a symmetric relation, with the\nresult that (an) A is like (a) B just in case, or\njust to the extent that, (a) B is like (an) A. On\nthe understanding of likeness talk being offered here, this won’t be\ntrue at least in general. And Fogelin seems right about this: \n\nComparisons have conversationally adjustable contents, resulting\nfrom the attribution of conversationally adjustable contents to\ncomparative constructions such as is like. To assign a\ncomparative statement a particular truth-value, one must bring to bear\na conversationally adjustable canon of similarity, telling us\nhow much like (a) B and in what respects a thing A\nneeds to be in order for A to count as unqualifiedly like (a)\nB for present conversational purposes. For instance, in\nordinary contexts governed by a routine default canon of\nsimilarity, \n\ncomes out true, since “like bulldozers, road graders are also\nused to push around large quantities of dirt, the chief difference\nbeing that road graders have their blades beneath the chassis rather\nthan in front of them.” (88) \n\nWe’re now in a position to draw a distinction between literal\ncomparisons and figurative comparisons, similes, that accords with the\nidea that to speak figuratively is to speak so as to stand corrected.\nFigurative comparisons invite a different kind of correction than\nfigurative predications do. \n\nTo take a comparison literally is to assess it in the light\nof a canon of similarity already in play when the comparison is\nuttered, a generally prevailing or already prevailing\ncanon of similarity. This is how we always take a comparison on first\nencountering it. And when the content we thereby assign it is fully in\naccord with Gricean conversational principles, this is the only way we\never do take it, the way we presume we were intended to take it all\nalong. Such is how we take (1), for example. \n\nBut sometimes taking a comparison literally yields a content that is\nmanifestly false, manifestly uninformative, or otherwise at odds with\nconversational principles. Such is the case with \n\n“Margaret Thatcher cannot, for example, move huge quantities\nof dirt in an efficient manner” (87). Nor is she routinely\nprepared to get dirty in any literal sense. Listeners can be counted on\nto know as much and notice as much. So confronted with (2), they cast\nabout for a possible adjustment to the previously prevailing canon of\nsimilarity that brings the content of (2) into line with conversational\nprinciples and is manifestly smaller, manifestly more natural,\nmanifestly easier to make, than any other adjustment that would do the\ntrick. This adjustment relaxes the standards of how like a\nbulldozer a thing needs to be in order to be just plain like a\nbulldozer, like a bulldozer without qualification. And\nit bestows fresh salience on relatively abstract features of\nbulldozers, features a powerful person might credibly share: an ability\nto take on large tasks, an ability to wear down large obstacles a\nlittle at a time, a certain gracelessness in moment-to-moment\noperation, etc. \n\nWhen they think they’ve hit on such a possible adjustment,\nlisteners promptly implement it: they reinterpret the comparison in\naccord with the adjusted canon of similarity and take the resulting\nadjusted content to be what the speaker intended to get across all\nalong. (The whole process takes place without conscious inference;\nindeed, this is part of what makes the adjustment a natural one in\nFogelin’s eyes.) To take a comparison figuratively is simply to\nexecute this kind of adjustment in how we interpret it. A\nsimile, a figurative comparative statement, is simply a\ncomparison that manifestly requires and therefore routinely receives\nthis kind of adjusted truth-conditional interpretation. When a simile\nis figuratively true, it will ordinarily be literally false—it\nwill compare things such that the first is unlike the second\nby generally prevailing or previously prevailing standards, yet the\nfirst is like the second by new standards the simile\nitself helps to impose; this is the sense in which a simile is an\nexhibition of unity in variety, a likening of dissimilar things. \n\nThis account of how similes differ from more routine literal\ncomparisons predicts that similes exhibit the same kind of\nreversibility failure as their literal counterparts and do so for\nfundamentally the same reason. And this prediction seems to be correct.\nWitness this observation from the novelist William H. Gass: \n\nAs with comparisons generally, our interest in a simile usually\nisn’t an interest in the bare fact of likeness; it’s an\ninterest in the specific features of (an) A in virtue of which\nit’s figuratively like (a) B. So: ordinarily a listener\nis expected to infer for himself or notice for himself what it is about\n(an) A that’s supposed to make it count as like (a)\nB by these newly prevailing, adjusted standards: \n\nTo do this is to paraphrase the simile in question. In the\ncase of (2), we might come up with something along the lines of \n\nOn being told by Gertrude Stein that his portrait of her\ndidn’t look much like her, Picasso is said to have responded,\n“Don’t worry, it will.” If we call such portraits,\nportraits that vindicate themselves in the fullness of time by imposing\ntheir own novel standards of vindication, Picasso likenesses,\nwe might say that on Fogelin’s account of things, similes are\nPicasso likenings. \n\nIf we can understand \n\nas somehow short for (2), we’ll see how (3) is in order as a\nparaphrase of (4) as well. We’ll have a ready explanation of the\nfact that there is all the difference in the world between saying in a\nspirit of metaphor that money is blood (a stuff which\ninvigorates by circulating and facilitating vital exchanges) and saying\nin a spirit of metaphor that blood is money (in that\nparting with it, letting it be shed, is a powerful but drastic way of\nobtaining precious things). As for the fact that metaphors often invite\nmore subtle and ambitious readings than the corresponding similes would\nin their place, ellipsis itself has powerful effects on how words are\nbest interpreted in context. Imagine trying to find precise,\nconversationally natural, non-elliptical equivalents for such cleverly\ncrafted ellipses as these: \n\nBrute Force Accounts maintain that in metaphor, no words go\nmissing and neither words nor speakers are induced to mean anything out\nof the ordinary. Instead, an utterance that would otherwise be idle or\npointless produces something Richard Moran calls a “framing\neffect”(Moran, 1989): listeners are induced to view or consider\nor experience the primary subject (or subjects) in a fresh and special\nlight, a light afforded by juxtaposing it (or them) with the secondary subject\n(or subjects). What makes a remark metaphorical is the fact that it\ninduces this framing effect—together, perhaps, with the\nspecific syntactic strategy it employs for getting the job done.\nParaphrase (so-called) is best viewed as an effort to provide a salient\nand representative sample of the real or apparent truths about the\nprimary subject(s) the framing effect induces us to notice, think\nabout, or dwell upon. It mustn’t be viewed as a restatement of\nsome metaphorically expressed or metaphorically conveyed message, since\nthere is no such message, restatable or otherwise. As Donald Davidson\nput it in the most influential statement of such an account,\n“What Metaphors Mean”: \n\nDavidson cheerfully admits that there are things we can naturally\nand usefully refer to as metaphorical meaning and metaphorical truth.\nBut they aren’t the seeds of metaphorical understanding; they are\namong its fruits. We mislocate metaphorical meanings if we regard them\nas accruing to particular words or phrases, the words and phrases we\ntake metaphorically. And we mislocate metaphorical truth if we think of\nit as accruing to particular sentences, the ones we take to be\nmetaphors. \n\nWhen it comes to metaphorical meaning: metaphors are subject to\ninterpretation in much the same way or sense as dreams are. We may\ninterpret a dream with an eye to ascribing it a determinate cognitive\nvalue or interest, thereby coming to terms with it. Whether an\ninterpretation of a dream and the value or interest it ascribes to the\ndream in question can be made to stick depends as much on the nature of\nthe interpreter and her concerns as on the nature of the dream and its\norigins. A successful dream interpretation is the successful outcome of\na hermeneutic negotiation between an interpreter and a dream, or\nbetween an interpreter and a dreamer, where what counts as a successful\noutcome depends on what both parties bring to the transaction:\n“Metaphor is the dreamwork of language, and, like all dreamwork,\nits interpretation reflects as much on the interpreter as on the\noriginator.” (31) \n\nWhen it comes to metaphorical truth: there can be truth (call it\nmetaphorical truth) in a sentence that is itself, considered simply as\na sentence, simply false, just as there can be truth (call it mythic\ntruth) in a story that is itself, considered simply as a story, simply\nfalse. Understood along these lines, metaphorical truth would be\nsomething like the revelatory power conferred upon a metaphorical\nsentence (or on the impulse to use such a sentence) by a successful\nmetaphorical interpretation of the sentence, a successful ascription to\nit of metaphorical meaning. \n\nDavidson’s own version of a brute-force account has two main\npositive inspiring ideas. \n\nThe first is the analogy between metaphors and jokes, an analogy he\nmay have encountered originally in work of Ted Cohen (cf. Cohen\n1978). Metaphors and jokes are alike in being small-scale works of\nverbal art. It takes wit to make jokes and a sense of humor to get\nthem; it takes genius of a certain sort to make metaphors and taste of\na certain sort to get them. All four capacities just mentioned are\ncreative capacities, modes of inventiveness—inventive\nconstruction in the case of wit and genius, inventive construal in the\ncase of humor and taste. The acquisition of these capacities\nisn’t simply a matter of assimilating rules, nor is their\nexercise simply a matter of applying rules. But capacities that are in\nthis sense creative or inventive are already at work in literal\nconstrual, even if they don’t have such fancy names. \n\nWe get closer to the heart of Davidson’s analogy if we contend\nthat metaphors (taken as metaphors) have meanings only in the same way\nor sense that jokes (taken as jokes) do: both metaphors and jokes have\npoints, points which will be got by some and missed by others.\nThe point of a joke or metaphor is based on and made possible by\nappropriate assignments of literal meanings to the words and phrases\nthat go to make up an utterance—based on and made possible by\nan appropriate literal construal of the utterance. Yet one may\nmanage the called-for literal construal of a joke or metaphor yet\nnevertheless miss (fail to get) its point. \n\nThe point of a joke or metaphor is at once something more\nthan a second meaning or import, assigned in the course of a second act\nof construal, and something less than this. It is something\nmore, in that producing a joke or metaphor in the first place requires\nsome kind and degree of artistic success: to produce a joke or metaphor\nat all is to bring something off. Getting (the point of) either kind of\nverbal contraption involves appreciating what the speaker has brought\noff in producing it. And no amount of intellectual\nunderstanding of the speaker’s ends, the speaker’s\nmeans, or the manner in which and extent to which the speaker’s\nmeans achieved the speaker’s ends suffices for appreciation.\nAppreciation involves a capacity and readiness to experience and value\nthe finished contraption in ways called for by what its maker has\nbrought off. \n\nThe second inspiring idea is an account of the framing effect\nitself, on which it consists for the most part in a state of mind in\nwhich we are encouraged and enabled to make comparisons, encouraged and\nenabled to notice similarities and dissimilarities, analogies and\ndisanalogies, between primary and secondary subjects. Metaphor is\nconcerned with likenesses or analogies although it\ndoesn’t state them. \n\nSometimes a brief but powerful poetic utterance consists solely of\nthe juxtaposed mentionings of two different things or sights or\nsituations, managed so as to suggest that one of the two is there to\nshed light on the other. In Buson’s haiku: \n\nthe light source, the chill, comes first. More commonly, as in Pound’s\n“In a Station of the Metro,” it comes second.  Critics\noften regard such poetic miniatures as limiting cases—in a\nnonprejudicial sense, degenerate cases—of metaphor or\nsimile. Northrop Frye (1957, 123) speaks of “metaphor by\njuxtaposition”; he’d have us regard Pound’s semicolon as the\nghost of a departed metaphor-forging form of the verb to\nbe: \n\nJohn Hollander (1985, 278) speaks of “evaded simile”;\nhe’d have us regard the semicolon as the ghost of a departed\ncomparative construction: \n\nDavidson’s idea is the reverse of Frye’s and\nHollander’s: he’d have us regard both the is of\nmetaphor and the is like of simile as lengthenings of\nPound’s semicolon. What it is about A that lights up or\nis brought into prominence when A is considered in the light\nof B is what A shares or at least might be regarded\nas sharing with B, specific concrete real or putative\nlikenesses between A and B. For Davidson himself, the\nframing effect is a cognitive affair; it consists in having one’s\nattention drawn to such real or putative likenesses. Not all advocates\nof a brute force account would agree with him about this. (See for\ninstance Rorty 1989, 17–18.) \n\nDavidson confronts semantic twist accounts like Skulsky’s with\nthe following thought experiment: \n\nYou are entertaining a visitor from Saturn by trying to teach him\nthe word “floor.” You go through the familiar dodges,\nleading him from floor to floor, pointing and stamping and repeating\nthe word.… \n\nShould we call this process learning something about the world or\nlearning something about language? An odd question, since what is\nlearned is that a bit of language refers to a bit of the world. Still,\nit is easy to distinguish between the business of learning the meaning\nof a word and using the word once the meaning is learned. Comparing\nthese two activities, it is natural to say that the first\nconcerns learning something about language, while the second\nconcerns learning something about the world… \n\nYour friend from Saturn now transports you through space to his home\nsphere, and looking back remotely on earth you say to him, nodding at\nthe earth, “floor.” Perhaps he will think this is still\npart of the lesson and assume that the word “floor” applies\nproperly to the earth, at least as seen from Saturn. But what if you\nthought he already knew the meaning of “floor” and you were\nremembering how Dante, from a similar place in the heavens, saw the\ninhabited earth as “the small round floor that makes us\npassionate”? [Paradiso 22.151, trans. Laurence Binyon]\nYour purpose was metaphor, not drill in the use of the language. What\ndifference would it make to your friend which way he took it? With the\ntheory of metaphor under consideration, very little difference.\n(36–7) \n\nSemantic twist theory locates metaphor’s specialness in a\nspecial kind of on-the-fly language learning. So it is committed to\nviewing metaphorical understanding as a process in which how we are\nalready disposed to experience, think about, and otherwise respond to\nthe primary and secondary subjects informs how we freshly\nexperience, think about, and respond to words such as\n“floor.” A process in which what needs attending to,\nwhat needs active re-experiencing, is language, not the world.\nMetaphorical understanding, metaphorical language learning, would be\non all fours with respect to the prior and more drawn out business of\nlearning the literal meaning of “floor.” But metaphorical\nunderstanding isn’t like this at all. On the contrary, it is a\nprocess in which how we already experience, think about, and otherwise\nrespond to words such as “floor” informs how we\nfreshly experience, think about, and respond to the primary and\nsecondary subjects. A process in which what needs attending to,\nwhat needs active re-experiencing, is the world, not language. Brute\nforce theory gets this exactly right; semantic twist theory gets it\nexactly wrong. \n\nRoger M. White (1996) agrees with Davidson about the\ncomparison-based nature of the framing effect but rejects his\njuxtaposition-based account of how metaphors deploy their syntactic raw\nmaterial. On White’s alternative brute force account, metaphor\ninvolves a pair of recoverable parent sentences that have been\nintertwined or interwoven to yield the sentence actually uttered;\nmetaphor’s characteristic effect on the listener requires the\ntacit reconstruction by him of those parent sentences, followed by an\nactive comparison of the differing situations those differing sentences\nwould serve to describe. Metaphor still works by inducing a framing\neffect rather than by formulating or communicating any particular\npropositional content. But it is a whole situation, not a discrete\nobject or kind of object, that metaphor enables us to view in a new\nlight; the new light is shed by the invocation of a second situation of\ncomparable complexity; and the invocation is managed by an interweaving\nof sentences rather than by a juxtaposition of terms. Such an account\nmight be called conflationism. It’s especially appealing\nas an account of implicit metaphors such as Ahab’s, and\nWhite employs it to offer close readings of ambitious literary\nmetaphors from Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, and others. \n\nMore recently, Lepore and Stone (2010, 2015) have drawn on David\nLewis’s work on convention, signaling, and conversational\nscorekeeping to offer a Davidson-inspired account of how speakers and\naudiences collaborate in bringing off the special verbal accomplishment\nthat is a metaphor. \n\nIt won’t be possible to analyze metaphor in terms of special\nspeaker meanings (in the manner of Grice) or special word meanings (in\nthe manner of Skulsky) unless the words of a metaphor are put to\nspecial nonstandard communicative use. Yet not all coordination with an\naudience by means of conventionally signaled intentions counts as\ncommunication with that audience. Say that a speaker S\ncoordinates with his audience in the joint achievement of goal\nG by means or utterance U when circumstances are such\nthat: \n\n(a) S can motivate his listeners to collaborate with him in\nachieving G simply by getting them to think he intends that he\nand they collaborate in achieving it; \n\n(b) Motivating his listeners in this manner pretty much exhausts the\ncontribution S himself needs to make to their joint\nachievement of G; \n\n(c) S can get his listeners to think he so intends simply\nby producing something that will function under the circumstances as a\nconventional signal that he so intends, where conventional signal\nsystems are defined and explained along lines laid down in Lewis\n(1969); \n\n(d) Understandings already in place between S and his\nlisteners enable his production of U to function as just such\na conventional signal of just such an intention on his part; and \n\n(e) S in fact produces U. \n\nJoke-telling and metaphor-making certainly involve coordination with\nan audience so defined: coordination in a shared relishing of the\nridiculousness of some situation or attitude; coordination in a joint\nexploration of the ramifications of some pregnant comparison; or what\nhave you. But if we follow Lewis (1979), such coordination amounts to\ncommunication if and only if either \n\n(1) G simply consists in the addition of particular\npropositions to some public, jointly maintained conversational score or\nrecord; or at least, \n\n(2) all it would take to achieve G under the circumstances is\nsome such addition to some such conversational score or\nrecord. \n\nAnd the goals built into joke-telling and metaphor-making\ndon’t meet this condition. No collaborative adjustment in what is\ntaken for granted for present conversational purposes suffices by\nitself to make it the case that we relish the ridiculousness of a\nsituation together, explore the ramifications of a comparison together,\nor what have you. So metaphors and jokes are instances of\nnon-communicative verbal coordination: however much communication\nbringing off a metaphor or joke may often require, bringing off a\nmetaphor or a joke is not in itself a communicative accomplishment.\n(The point has an interesting consequence for theories of\n speech acts.\n Sometimes speakers collaborate with\naudiences on the production of a perlocutionary effect without\ncollaborating with them on the production of any enabling illocutionary\neffect. Such brute perlocutionary acts include the bringing off of\nmetaphors and jokes. When we tell a joke or propound a metaphor, we do\nsomething by speaking as we do without doing anything\nin speaking as we do.) \nFor detailed critical commentary on\nDavidson, see Reimer (1996, 2001, 2004). \n\nIn the 1980s a distinctive style of theorizing about\nlanguage, thought, and meaning took shape in the work of Charles\nFillmore, Eleanor Rosch, George Lakoff, Ronald Langacker and their\nfollowers that came to be known as cognitive linguistics (Lee\n2001, Croft and Cruse 2004). \n\nCognitive linguists break with advocates of Chomskian generative\ngrammar, denying that the terms on which words intelligibly combine are\nset by brute hard-wired principles of universal grammar embodied in a\nspecial purpose language module. Instead, the terms on which words\nmeaningfully combine are a direct reflection of the terms on which\ncertain strategies for conceiving concrete situations, strategies the\nwords serve to signal and evoke, can be successfully coordinated with\none another. They break with advocates of a Fodorian language of\nthought, denying that conceiving or thinking is a matter of\nmanipulating sentence-like discursive mental representations in accord\nwith syntactically stated, truth preserving inferential rules. Instead,\nconceiving is a matter of manipulating unconscious mental imagery so as\nto let concretely pictured physical objects and situations stand in for\nthe more abstract objects and situations we’re endeavoring to\nunderstand. \n\nVerbal and nonverbal signs don’t possess fixed meanings or\napplicability conditions independent of particular occasions of use.\nSigns prompt audiences to construct contextually appropriate meanings\nfor them afresh and on the fly, each time would-be communicators resort\nto them. Communication depends on the would-be communicator’s\nability to anticipate and purposefully manipulate the spontaneous,\nlargely unconscious constructions of meaning her signals will elicit\nfrom her intended audience. \n\nConcepts are first and foremost techniques for coping with their\nsubject matters; only secondarily are they means of referring to\nparticular constituents of those subject matters for the purpose of\nframing discursively structured true and false thoughts about them. And\ntalk of discursively structured thoughts needs to be taken\nwith a grain of salt. Tempting as it is to regard the meaning of a\nconcept as a matter of the mind-independent thing or kind or relation\nto which it refers, tempting as it is to regard the content of a true\nor false thought as a matter of the mind-independent proposition the\nthought expresses, tempting as it is to regard the thoughts we think as\narranging already meaningful concepts in much the way the sentences we\nspeak arrange already meaningful words, such thinking underestimates\nthe degree to which how we think is implicated in what we\nare able to think and what we are able to think about.\nTalk of referents and propositional contents and logical forms belongs\nto a formalistic picture of what thinking is like, a picture\nwhich is at best an intermittently convenient fiction. \n\nOur most basic concepts, our most basic coping strategies, are those\nwe employ incessantly in the course of purposeful voluntary bodily\nmovement executed in response to sense-perceptible features of things\nin our immediate spatial vicinity. These basic concepts sketch out a\nworld of discrete objects and discrete parcels of various physical\nstuffs (substances), laid out in space and changing over time as the\nobjects and substances in question come into existence, move about from\nplace to place, and eventually go out of existence. They present this\nsensorimotor world to us from a particular determinate spatiotemporal\nperspective, and characterize it for us more or less as follows. \n\nThere’s an inherent difference between horizontal and vertical\ndirections; with only one vertical direction but many different\nhorizontal ones. There’s an inherent difference between higher\nand lower places, hence also an inherent difference between upward and\ndownward motion. Some objects are undifferentiated point particles;\nothers are extended, with distinguishable fronts and backs and sides; a\nfew have distinguishable tops and bottoms as well. (An object’s\nfront is the part of it that normally faces forward as it moves and the\npart one normally needs to manipulate if one has serious business to\ntransact with the object; a thing’s top is the part that is\nnormally highest up, etc.) Some motions, the forced ones, result from\nexternal influences on a moving object or substance, pushes or pulls\nexerted on it by other objects or substances in its immediate physical\nsurroundings. Others, the spontaneous motions, occur at the initiative\nof the moving thing itself; these are physical actions on the part of\nphysical agents. Some objects are hollow and can accommodate other\nobjects or substances within themselves, in an interior place that\nmoves around with them whenever they move around; these are the\ncontainers. One place or object may be connected to another place or\nobject by a traversible path consisting of intervening locations. Such\na path may be short, straight, and direct; or it may be long, crooked,\nand indirect. Objects and substances stand in relations of fitting,\nsticking, gripping, supporting and the like, and each of these\nrelations has immediate consequences for how (and how independently)\nthe objects or substances in question can move. Etc. \n\nThe concepts that figure in the foregoing remarks outline a kind of\nfolk geometry, folk kinematics, and folk dynamics. The relations with\nwhich these concepts are concerned aren’t the only immediate\nobjects of human experience: we are aware of some of our own emotions\nwith equal immediacy. But they are the most “clearly\ndelineated” objects of experience and those with which human\nthinking is most inevitably and incessantly concerned. \n\nWe exhibit these relations to ourselves and make inferences about\nthem by means of simple diagrammatic mental images, images the\nunconscious employment of which routinely mediates the planning and\nexecution of our voluntary bodily movements: these are sensorimotor\nimage schemas. We use these schemas to monitor and manage our\nongoing activities in the here and now, and to envisage possible future\ncircumstances and possible future activities when we speculate or plan.\nWe may also employ them in imagistic demonstrations of important\ngeneral principles governing the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic\nrelations they serve to depict, truths such as: \n\n(1) If object x is in container c and c\nitself is in a second container d, then x is in\nd. \n\n(2) If object x starts out at a and travels\ncontinuously in a single direction along a direct path leading from\na to b, then x gets closer and\ncloser to b at later and later times until it eventually\narrives at b (if it ever does). \n\nSuch demonstrations are possible because once properly set up and\nproperly deployed, an image-schematic depiction is often found to\npossess reality-describing content in excess of what its constructor\ndeliberately imposed in the first place. When this occurs, the\ndepiction is treated by its constructor as carrying information (or\nmisinformation) concerning what situations of the kind she set out to\npicture typically are or necessarily must be like.\nSome of this excess information may be presented explicitly and\nstatically, so that she can simply read it off the face of the\ndepiction she has constructed. This is how we might demonstrate (1) to\nourselves. Such is structural inference. The rest of it\nis presented only implicitly and dynamically, so that she can retrieve\nit only by setting her depiction in motion and letting its changing\nstates tell her how situations of the kind she set out to picture\ntypically would or necessarily must evolve over time. This is how we\nmight demonstrate (2) to ourselves. Such is enactment, also\ncalled simulation, elaboration, or running a mental\nspace. (For “structural inference” and\n“enactment” see Lakoff and Johnson (2003), 257. For\n“simulation,” “elaboration,” and “running\na space,” see Fauconnier and Turner (2002), 42–48.) \n\nLakoff and his collaborators hold that metaphor is at bottom a\nconceptual matter, a matter of thinking of one thing as and in terms of\nanother. What Lakoff calls a conceptual metaphor or\ncross-domain map (e.g. love is a journey) is a standing\npervasive culture-wide disposition to conceive one fixed sort of thing\n(e.g. love affairs), as and in terms of another fixed sort of thing\n(e.g. journeys). Such a cognitive disposition sets up a standing\ncorrespondence between particular standard love-affair concepts on the\none hand and particular standard journey concepts on the other, with\nthe effect that each time the relevant conceptual metaphor is invoked\n(in connection, perhaps, with a new pair of lovers), \n\nThe lovers correspond to travelers.\n\nThe love relationship corresponds to the vehicle.\n\nThe lovers’ common goals correspond to their common destinations\non the journey.\n\nDifficulties in the relationship correspond to impediments to travel.\n(Lakoff 1993, 207) \n\nAnd so on. By exploiting these correspondences, we can and do\nredeploy familiar, easy patterns of thinking about one familiar sort of\nthing lending itself to direct sensorimotor representation (journeys)\nin novel and strenuous bouts of thinking about a second, more elusive\nsort of thing (love affairs): \n\nThe metaphor involves understanding one domain of experience, love,\nin terms of a very different domain of experience, journeys…\n(206) \n\nMetaphor allows us to understand a relatively abstract or inherently\nunstructured subject matter in terms of a more concrete, or at least\nmore highly structured subject matter. (244–245) \n\nOver time this single cognitive disposition may manifest itself in\nmany different verbal expressions: \n\nWhat makes these verbal expressions metaphorical, according\nto Lakoff, is the fact that they are direct, conventionally\nstraightforward puttings-into-words of inherently metaphorical\nthoughts, thoughts constructed in the first place under the\nsupervision of the single conceptual metaphor love is a journey.\nActivate a conceptual metaphor; use it to think a metaphorical thought;\nput that thought into words in the usual routine manner, provided for\nby the usual routine meanings of the words in question; and the result\nthereby counts as a verbal metaphor. Lakoff effectively\ndefines verbal metaphor as the conventionally straightforward\nputting-into-words of an inherently metaphorical conceiving, an\ninherently metaphorical thought. Such is the application to verbal\nmetaphor of the general cognitive linguistic principle that syntactic\nform is the direct expression of underlying meaning relations. \n\nA mental space is an arrangement of discrete concepts or images deployed so as to represent some familiar recurrent sort of situation. Imaginative manipulation of such a space allows us to anticipate the structure at a time and behavior over time of situations of the sort it is designed to represent. Mental spaces represent ways things can be conceived to be in something of the way possible worlds represent ways they could be. Gilles Fauconnier (1994) proposed them as a basis for interpretations of counterfactuals and propositional attitude constructions he viewed as superior to the standard truth conditional interpretations based on quantification over possible worlds.  \n\nSuppose two such spaces, representing distinct sorts of situations, can be viewed as contrasting enrichments of a single generic space representing a more general sort of situation they instantiate in differing and contrasting ways. Concepts or images in the first space correspond to concepts or images in the second if they flesh out the same concept or image in the generic space. One can then construct a fourth blended space deriving some of its representational features from the first input space, some from the second, and still others from general principles of conceptual integration, in hopes that the result may accurately represent—accurately anticipate the structure at a time and behavior over time—of some independently interesting sort of situation. Fauconnier and Turner (2002) offered a general framework for studying blended spaces and the conceptual integration networks that produce them. They envisioned diverse applications of the framework to the study of informal reasoning and the interpretation of ordinary language. One such application was the interpretation of analogical metaphors of the form “X is the Y of Z”—e.g. “Vanity is the quicksand of reason”—a matter Turner explores at length in his (1998).\n \n\nA metaphor’s paraphrasable content isn’t\ndefinitively settled by the pertinent literal meanings of its\nconstituent words and phrases. The sun can nourish and illuminate, but\nit can also parch and dessicate and burn. What I convey about a person\nby metaphorically likening her to the sun depends on which forms of\nsolar power come to mind when I do so, and that in turn depends in an\nintricate manner on the concrete conversational setting in which I do\nso. Metaphors exhibit a profound and conspicuous\ncontext-sensitivity, and much of the work done on metaphor\nover the past few years has been informed by more general debates about\nthe proper treatment of context-sensitivity in systematic philosophy of\nlanguage. \n\nFor the literalist, the primary verbal expressers of\npropositions, the fundamental verbal bearers of truth-values, are\nsuitably disambiguated sentence types. Hence the primary\nbearers of referents, extensions, and truth-conditional\ncontents, the fundamental units of account in compositional\nsemantics, are suitably disambiguated word and phrase types.\nIt is easy to see what this comes to in the case of artificial\nlanguages suitable to pure mathematics and kindred abstract subject\nmatters. It is harder to see what it comes to in the case of natural\nlanguages, where a single sentence type may be used to assert many\ndifferent propositions with every outward show of candor and directness\nin as many different concrete conversational settings. The literalist\nhopes to take the context-sensitivity of indexicals like I and\nhere and now as a model for understanding semantic\ncontext-sensitivity more generally. \n\nHere an independently plausible conception of conversational\nexchange comes to her aid. The utterances of speakers and the\ninterpretive activity of listeners is profoundly and pervasively shaped\nby the current values of a small number of basic situating\nparameters. These parameters have fairly determinate values at\neach stage in a well-run conversation; a wide variety of conversational\nproprieties and improprieties turn on their current values at any given\nstage; the values change from utterance to utterance in response to\npublicly discernible events in a manner governed by simple principles\nof conversational dynamics, so that careful and well-situated\nparticipants have a fighting chance of keeping track of their changing\nvalues. Participants need that fighting chance, since fluent\nunconstrained conversational exchange resulting in full understanding\nby each of what all the others are saying requires the participants to\npossess more or less accurate, more or less thoroughgoing mutual\nknowledge of the values of the parameters at each and every point in\nthe exchange. \n\nThe single most obvious and pervasively important situating\nparameter is what is (pragmatically)\npresupposed, the set of propositions whose truth is mutually\nassumed for current conversational purposes. Yet it is easy to make a\ncase for regarding who is speaking, who is being addressed, the\ntime of speaking, relations of relative salience, etc, as\nadditional situating parameters. In fact, the parameters to which the\ncontents of various special “context-sensitive”\nwords and phrases are most obviously sensitive appear to be among the\nsituating parameters mutual knowledge of which is essential to\nunconstrained conversational coordination more generally. So\nperhaps we should think of sentence types as expressing propositions,\nand of word and phrase types as expressing propositional constituents\nor contents, relative to one or another assignment of values to the\nvarious situating parameters that govern ongoing conversational\nexchange, which will then proceed more or less as follows: \n\n(a) The content accruing to a sentence (type) when it is uttered,\nthe content it has relative to the currently active values of the\npertinent situating parameters, serves to determine what can be said or\notherwise directly communicated by uttering it. \n\n(b) What is said or otherwise directly communicated by an utterance,\ntogether with various other publicly accessible changes in\nconversational circumstances, serve to determine how situating\nparameters change in preparation for the next utterance somebody might\nmake. \n\n(c) When the values situating parameters take on in preparation for\nthe next utterance are fully appropriate as they stand to the\ninterpretation of the next utterance when it comes, the content taken\non by this utterance when it comes is the content the uttered sentence\npossesses relative to those preset parameter values. \n\n(d) When the values the parameters take on in preparation for the\nnext utterance are inappropriate as they stand to the next\nutterance when it comes, but there is a unique simple, feasible,\npublicly guessable change in those values that would render the\nutterance appropriate and appropriately interpretable, that change\noccurs forthwith, and the content taken on by the next utterance when\nit comes is the one the uttered sentence possesses relative to the\nfreshly minted set of parameter values resulting from this last-minute\nadjustment. The literature calls this process\naccommodation. \n\nFor purposes of semantic and pragmatic theorizing, we can represent\nthe contexts to which the contents of context-sensitive\nexpressions are sensitive and in relation to which they vary by\nsets of possible values for the situating parameters. And we\ncan represent the meaning of a given suitably disambiguated word or\nphrase type by a rule for arriving at an appropriate propositional\nconstituent or truth-conditional contribution or content,\ngiven a context thus understood. David Kaplan called\nsuch a rule taking us from contexts to contents a character.\nThe technical resources employed by literalism were put in place\ngradually over the years by Richard Montague (1974), David Kaplan\n(1989), David Lewis (1979), and Robert Stalnaker (1999), but whether\nany of them would fully endorse it is open to question. Prominent\nliteralists include Kent Bach (2005), Jason Stanley (2007), and the\nself-styled semantic minimalists: Emma Borg (2004) and Herman Cappelen\nand Ernie Lepore (2005). \n\nThe contextualist, by contrast, insists that what it would\ntake for an utterance to be true or instead false, what it would take\nfor an uttered sentence type to be true or instead false\nas uttered, is a matter of what it would take for us to be\nspeaking truly or instead falsely in producing the utterance. When I\nemploy my words with every outward show of candor and directness, there\nsimply isn’t room for a principled and explanatory distinction\nbetween what I say and what I mean, the proposition I express and the\nproposition I communicate. As a general rule, the proposition I express\nin speaking as I do is what you’d be affirming if you responded\nwith Yes, that’s so; what you’d be denying if you\nresponded with No, that’s not so; what you’d be\nquestioning if you responded with Is that so? Where there\nis a disparity between what is said and what is successfully\nmeant in either direction, the disparity needs to be pretheoretically\ndiscernible at least in broad outline, or Gricean conversational\ninferences won’t get off the ground in the first place. \n\nGrant me this much, the contextualist continues, and you’ll\nneed to conclude that there’s no assignable limit to the number\nof contents a term with a given literal meaning can assume, no\nassignable limit to the features of an occasion of use that can become\npertinent to determining which of these contents the term actually will\nassume on some particular occasion of use, given its literal meaning.\nContexts resist summary representation in terms of sets of situating\nparameter values, and the passage from literal meaning to appropriate\ncontent, given a context, can’t be encapsulated in any tidy\nparametric rule; it is hermeneutic rather than algorithmic in nature.\nAs Charles Travis puts it: \n\nThe contextualist concludes that there is nothing compact and\nsurveyable, relative to which natural language sentence types\ncan be said to express determinate propositions. Indeed, sentence\ntypes as such don’t express propositions or possess\ntruth conditions at all. What truth and falsity and propositional\ncontent accrue to first and foremost are speakings to particular\ncommunicative effect on the part of particular speakers. “Only in\nthe context of a speech act does a sentence express a determinate\ncontent”(Recanati, 2004). Prominent contextualists include Travis\n(2008), John Searle (1979a), François Recanati (2004), Herbert\nClark (1992), Stephen Levinson (2000), and latter-day relevance\ntheorists: Robyn Carston (2002), Anne Bezuidenhout (2002), and Sperber\nand Wilson themselves in work from the mid-90s on. \n\nConfronted with puzzles like Travis’s about what it takes to\nbe literally “at home,” the literalist needs to\nmaintain that the proposition I succeed in communicating by uttering a\nsentence often differs from the one my sentence expresses relative to\nprevailing values for relevant situating parameters, even when I speak\nwith every surface sign of candor and directness. She concludes from\nthis that there are disparities between what we strictly speaking\nsay, the propositions we verbally express, and what we\nsuccessfully mean that are subtler than those exhibited in\nclassical Gricean implicatures. She hopes the discriminatory and\nexplanatory strategies Grice brought to bear on relatively gross\ndisparities between the said and the meant can eventually be brought to\nbear on these subtler ones as well. \n\nThe contextualist is free to think of at least some figurative uses\nas turning on a contrast between the literal content accruing\nto an expression directly and from below (in virtue of its meaning and\nrelevant features of its occasion of use) and a distinct, derived,\nfigurative content the expression passes on up the tree of\ngrammar as its contribution to the content of any larger syntactic\nwholes in which it may be embedded. In other words, he is free to\nregard at least some figures of speech as involving pragmatically\ninspired processes of content reassignment. \n\nFor the literalist, however, all possible contents for a given\nexpression issue from some appropriate underlying literal meaning for\nit in fundamentally the same way and with fundamentally the same\ndirectness: we simply apply one and the same content-determining\nrule, one and the same character, to different\ncontexts. Literalism therefore has no place for figurative\ncontents (so understood) in its accounts of figurative\nlanguage use. \n\nRecent contextualist accounts of metaphor have tended to be\nexercises in “truth conditional pragmatics”: metaphor\ninvolves some combination of enrichment and loosening in the\napplicability conditions of pertinent general terms, where the\nresulting content shift is just drastic enough to bring what the\nspeaker is thereby taken to be saying and what she is thereby\ntaken to mean or implicate into accord with pertinent conversational\nnorms. The conceptual raw materials for the shifted content derive in\npart from what is taken for granted at a given point in a given\nconversation, in part from commonplaces belonging to\n“encyclopedia entries” permanently associated with\nparticular terms for all competent users of those terms. In relevance\ntheoretic accounts—Carston (2002), Bezuidenhout (2001), Sperber\nand Wilson (2008)—the adjustment is part of the same\nreflectively accessible process of conversational inference we use to\nwork out classical Gricean implicatures. In Recanati’s competing\naccount (2004), it is managed by “associative” processes to\nwhich the listener lacks routine reflective access. Sperber and Wilson\nmaintain that metaphor is just an especially dramatic instance of\nprocesses of content modulation at work throughout the interpretation of\nlanguage, involving no distinctive principles of its own. \n\nRecent literalist accounts of metaphor have come in two styles. \n\nOn the one hand, there are efforts to portray the context\nsensitivity of metaphor in terms of Kaplanian characters: rules that\nrender the semantic content of a suitable specific metaphorical\nconstituent a suitable function of the current value of some specific\nsituating parameter of special relevance to metaphor in particular. \n\nWhen employed within the scope of modal and counterfactual\nconstructions, a metaphorical focal expression brings the properties it\nactually picks out here and now to the characterization of\ncircumstances in which it would have picked out other properties, had\nit been employed in them. This encourages Josef Stern (2000) to posit a\nterm-taking, term-making operator, “metaphorically\nspeaking” or “mthat,” ordinarily left unpronounced,\nwhose behavior is modeled on that of Kaplan’s rigidifying\noperator “dthat.” Stern supposes that at any given point in\nany given conversation, there is a set of things mutually taken for\ngranted for various figure-interpreting purposes; he calls them\nI-presuppositions. (Think back to Skulsky’s\ntalk-postulates.) Like ordinary presuppositions, I-presuppositions\nchange from utterance to utterance under the impact of accommodation\npressures, and they equip terms with “implications” in\nsomething like Skulsky’s sense: a property P is\n“implied by” or m-associated with a general term\nΦ in context c just in case it is I-presupposed in that\ncontext that things to which Φ applies have property P.\nThe full Kaplanian account of “mthat” runs more or less as\nfollows: \n\nThis makes the content of “mthat [Φ]” a function of\na special purpose situating parameter, the set of active\nI-presuppositions, even in cases where Φ itself has\nthe same content in every context. \n\n\nOn the other hand, there are efforts to rehabilitate the classical\nGricean implicature account of metaphor by challenging the specific\ndiagnostics for ‘what is said’ insisted upon by\ncontemporary contextualists. Neo-Gricean literalists undertake to\nargue that what is meant can differ from what is said even\nwhen speakers speak with every outward show of candor and directness,\nand that this is precisely what happens when speakers resort to\nmetaphor. The arguments they employ against their contextualist\nopponents bear a striking resemblance to those Kripke employed against\nDonnellan’s\ncontent-based treatment of the distinction between referential\nand attributive uses of definite descriptions. See Donnellan\n(1966), Kripke (1977), and the entry on \n descriptions.\n \n\nAn especially detailed effort along these lines comes from Elisabeth\nCamp (2006); only one of her arguments can be reviewed here. Some time\nback the linguist Larry Horn drew attention to “the phenomenon\nof\nmetalinguistic negation—a \ndevice for objecting to a previous utterance on any grounds whatever,\nincluding the conventional or conversational implicata it potentially\ninduces, its morphology, its style or register, or its phonetic\nrealization” (Horn, 1988, 381). Consider “It\nwasn’t warm, it was\nsweltering,” where of course, if it was\nsweltering, it follows that it was warm as well. In many circumstances,\na form of words the contextualist regards as reserved for denying what\nis said can in fact be pressed into service to deny one or another\nassociated, unexpressed proposition. Camp contends that this renders\ndirect denial diagnostics for what is said systematically unreliable.\nIf she’s right about this, direct affirmation diagnostics and\ndirect questioning diagnostics will be in trouble for the same sort of\nreason. \n\nThe American aesthetician Kendall Walton has pioneered an\napproach to imaginative play in children and its analogues in adult\nhuman culture built around the notion of a game of\nmake-believe. Such a game is governed by complex, tacit, mutually\nunderstood rules or norms, principles of generation, that\nrender what’s fictional in the game, what players of it\nare supposed to imagine in playing it, a fixed function of the actual\nstates and behaviors of various things and people they perceive,\nmanipulate, and otherwise interact with as they play it. Walton calls\nsuch generators of fictional content props. \n\nIconic and verbal representations of various familiar traditional\nkinds—dolls, hobby horses, statues, paintings,\nnovels—are inanimate props, artifacts whose\nwhole raison d’être is to help generate fictional\ncontent in make-believe games of various familiar recurrent\nkinds. What such representations represent is a matter of how they\nstand ready to function as props, how they stand ready to shape\nfictional content by helping to generate it when games of these\nfamiliar recurrent kinds actually get played. Actors, on the other\nhand, are animate props, props of a peculiarly active and\nself-conscious kind. They help to author and direct (in their capacity\nas autonomous agents) the fictional content they help to generate (in\ntheir capacity as props) and go on to consume (in their capacity as\nobedient imaginers). Actors behave so as to deliberately shape what\ncomes out fictional in the games they play with one another and with\nsalient inanimate bits of the world around them, thereby deliberately\norchestrating their own imaginings and those of their fellow\nplayers. \n\nThe most conspicuous games of make-believe, those involving\npremeditated acting, prefabricated representations, or both, are games\nwhose players vividly and eagerly imagine what they are supposed to\nimagine under the rules because doing so is intrinsically satisfying in\nsome way. Props in such games are means to imaginative ends, deriving\ntheir instrumental value or interest from the intrinsic value or\ninterest of the fictional content they help generate. Such games\nare content oriented. Examples include playing cops and\nrobbers, putting on Hamlet, reading a novel for the sake of\nits story. Walton (1990) analyzed various important modes of\nrepresentation in and outside the arts—depiction, narration,\ndramatic enactment, etc.—in terms of the special sorts of prop\nand special sorts of principle of generation characteristic of such\nanthropologically conspicuous, intrinsically satisfying, content\noriented games. \n\nBut not all games of make-believe are like this. Sometimes the games\nwe play and the fictions we generate in the course of playing them owe\nmuch of their value and interest to the manner in which they enable us\nto perceive, conceive, and manipulate their own props. Sometimes our\nthought and speech about objects that already really exist and are\nalready of vital interest to us can be helpfully structured or\nrestructured by pressing these objects into service as props in a\nsuitable game of make-believe, turning them for the time being into\nimprovised representations of something almost entirely different.\nPretend for a moment that Italy is a boot, turn Italy for the time\nbeing into an improvised representation of a boot, and you have a\nreadymade scheme for locating particular Italian cities in relation to\neach other, deriving from familiar established ways of thinking and\ntalking about boots and their component parts. Games of this second\nsort are prop oriented (Walton 1993). Since little turns on\nhow vividly we imagine the things such games call on us to imagine, we\nmay be only dimly aware of playing them even as we do so. Yet we are\nare remarkably skilled at playing such games with one another on a\npickup basis, never formulating, let alone stipulating, the principles\nof generation that govern our imaginative collaborations for as long as\nthey last. \n\nHearing “Juliet is the sun” in its concrete\nconversational setting, we come to suspect that Romeo is imagining his\nnew love to just plain be exactly that, the sun. We come to suspect\nthat Romeo is enabled to imagine this and in his personal\nopinion called on to image it by the rules of a game of\nmake-believe he spontaneously finds himself playing, a game we attempt\nto join him in playing as we struggle to make appropriate sense of his\nwords. Romeo imagines Juliet to be the sun because he feels called on\nto do so, and he feels called on to do so because of the rules he takes\nhimself to be playing by (on the one hand) and what he seriously\nbelieves about Juliet herself (on the other). \n\nPerhaps Romeo’s game is such that in going through the motions of\nasserting that Juliet is the sun, he renders it fictional that he does\nassert this and does so sincerely and truthfully. (Many games of\nmake-believe do work this way, after all.) If so, his utterance is an\nact of verbal participation in the game on which it comments,\na fiction-generating move in the game under the rules: going\nthrough the motions of asserting that Juliet is the sun will\nfictionally count as sincerely and truthfully asserting this very\nthing. Or perhaps not: perhaps Romeo isn’t pretending to say or assert\nanything at all in speaking as he does. Perhaps he isn’t speaking in\nhis capacity as make-believe actor at all; perhaps he speaks merely in\nhis other capacities as make-believe author and director and\naudience. In either case, his words serve to signal an understanding\non his part that it is fictional in the game he’s playing that Juliet\nis the sun: an understanding on his part that under the rules of the\ngame that he and any suitably attuned listeners are playing together,\nhe and they are to imagine Juliet to be the sun—imagine her to\njust plain be exactly that. \n\nAs we have already seen, this understanding on Romeo’s part is in turn\na joint product and joint expression of his working understanding of\nthe rules he’s playing by (on the one hand) and his working\nunderstanding of what Juliet herself is actually like (on the\nother). So: what would Romeo’s signal do for a listener who is already\nsuitably attuned with him, a listener already reliably disposed to\nplay by the same rules he plays by? It would ascribe to Juliet the\nproperties that in Romeo’s opinion render it fictional that\nshe is the sun, the properties that in Romeo’s opinion make the\nrole of the sun fall to her, under those rules. And these are the\nvery properties that turn up in a successful paraphrase of Romeo’s\nutterance when it gets taken as a metaphor. We listeners undertake to\ndiscover what properties these are by responding to Romeo’s utterance\nas a make-believe signal, doing our best to enter into the spirit of a\ngame already in progress, and reflecting on the rules we find\nourselves playing by if and when we succeed in doing so. \n\nAt any rate, this is how things go in the basic case. Sometimes the\nrules by which the maker of a metaphor is playing are so familiar and\nstereotyped that we can recover them without any prior effort to join\nin and play along, in which case we may not bother to do so. For that\nmatter, sometimes the initiator of the game may merely go through the\nmotions of playing it himself, failing to imagine the things he is\nnominally called on to imagine by make-believe signals he himself\nemits, in which case he merely alludes to a game that even he doesn’t\nbother to play. \n\nAll of which suggests the broad outlines of a novel account of how we\ngo about interpreting many metaphors:","contact.mail":"dhills@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
