He helped to establish the academic field\n“Mathematical Logic and Foundations”, claiming the\npriority of language construction and semantics in order to solve\nfoundational problems even outside mathematics. He was also the\ndriving force for the institutionalization of Mathematical Logic in\nGermany and a pioneer in the historiography of logic.\n\n\n\nHeinrich Scholz (1884–1956), German Protestant theologian,\nphilosopher, and logician, began his academic career as a Protestant\nsystematic theologian at the University of Breslau. He then moved to\nthe University of Kiel and in 1928 to the University of Münster\nin Westphalia. His Religionsphilosophie (Scholz 1921) became\nparticularly influential in Protestant Theology. Inspired by Alfred\nNorth Whitehead’s and Bertrand Russell’s Principia\nMathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1910–1913) he changed\nhis research area to Mathematical Logic and Foundations. He was\nsuccessful in establishing the “Schule von\nMünster” (“Münster School”) of\nlogicians and in founding the first academic department for\nMathematical Logic in Germany, the “Institut für\nMathematische Logik und Grundlagenforschung”\n(“Institute for Mathematical Logic and Foundational\nResearch”) in Münster, still in existence today.  Scholz\ncombined research on logical calculi with an epistemological Platonism\nand openness for metaphysical approaches. Nevertheless, he felt close\nto the scientific world view of Logical Empiricism.  Furthermore, with\nhis Geschichte der Logik (Scholz 1931a) Heinrich Scholz was a\npioneer in the historiography of logic. \n\nHeinrich Scholz was born on December 17, 1884 in Berlin. His father\nwas a Protestant parson (on Scholz’s biography and his work cf.\nElstrodt and Schmitz 2013; Hermes 1958; Meschkowski 1984; Molendijk\n1991; Molendijk 2005; Peckhaus 2008; Ritter, Hermes and Kambartel\n1961; Wernick 1944). He studied Protestant Theology and Philosophy in\nBerlin. Among his teachers were the Prussian Protestant theologian\nAdolf von Harnack (1851–1930), the neo-Kantian philosopher Alois\nRiehl (1844–1924) and the neo-idealist philosopher Friedrich\nPaulsen (1846–1908). In 1911 he completed his\nHabilitation in the Philosophy of Religion and Systematic\nTheology. He obtained an additional doctoral degree in Philosophy at\nthe University of Erlangen in 1913. In 1917 he was appointed to a full\nprofessorship in the Philosophy of Religion and Systematic Theology at\nthe University of Breslau in Silesia, today Wrocław, Poland. He\nalso received an honorary doctorate from the Theological Faculty of the\nUniversity of Berlin. Four years later, in 1921, he was appointed to\nthe chair for Philosophy in Kiel, before finally accepting the offer of\na professorial chair at the University of Münster in 1928. There\nhe first served as professor of Philosophy. He developed a close\nrelationship with Karl Barth, one of the main representatives of\nKerygmatic and Dialectic Theology, who taught Protestant Theology in\nMünster from 1925 on (cf. Molendijk 1991, ch. 3). Scholz changed\nhis main research area to Mathematical Logic and Foundations, and\nofficially taught the subject from 1936 on. In 1943 the denomination of\nhis chair was changed to Mathematical Logic and Foundations.\nThe institute of this name was founded in 1950. Scholz retired in 1952.\nHe died in Münster on December 30, 1956. \n\nThe “Memorandum about the New Mathematical Logic and\nFoundations” written for the Reichs- und Preußischen\nMinister für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung (Imperial\nand Prussian Secretary for Science, Education and National\nInstruction) on January 15, 1938 (Scholz 1938) shows that for Scholz\nthis new subject went beyond symbolic or mathematical logic, but\nincluded applications of logical analysis to foundational problems in\ngeneral.  According to Scholz, the new subject was prepared by\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), created by Gottlob Frege\n(1848–1925), and taken up by David Hilbert (1862–1943)\nwho, adopting Bertrand Russell’s (1872–1970) elaboration\nof Frege’s creation, made it the subject of deep investigations\naiming, e.g., “at a consistency proof for classical\nlogic”, and with this, of classical mathematics (presupposing\nthe logicist reduction of mathematics to logic). This new approach\nwas, according to Scholz, directed against Kant’s opinion that\n“foundational questions of any kind in principle cannot be\ntreated with mathematical methods and with mathematical means of\nconstruction and research questions”. Its task was a deepening\nand clarifying of foundations by combining structural investigations\nand the analysis of the context of application. \n\nFrom the beginning Scholz taught in Münster to a large extent on\nlogic, in particular “logistic” logic, as the new, i.e.,\nformal, symbolic, algebraic, algorithmic or mathematical logic was\ncalled since the Second International Congress for Philosophy at\nGeneva in 1904 (cf. Couturat 1904; Scholz 1931a, 57). In April 1936 he\nreceived an official extension of his philosophical appointment to\n“Logistic Logic and Foundations”. In the same year the\n“Section B” (consisting of Scholz’s chair and the\nacademic and non-academic staff attached to it) of the Philosophical\nSeminar was renamed “Logistic Section”. The next step was\ntaken in 1938 when the “section” became a\n“seminar” of its own. The denomination of Scholz’s\nchair was changed to “Philosophy of Mathematics and Science with\nSpecial Consideration of the New Logic and Foundations”. In 1943\nthe denomination was changed again to “Mathematical Logic and\nFoundations”. The “Logistic Seminar” was renamed\n“Seminar for Mathematical Logic and Foundations” in 1946,\nand finally, in 1950, it was renamed again, and elevated in\norganizational status, to “Institute for Mathematical Logic and\nFoundations” (cf. Schmidt am Busch & Wehmeier 2005a). \n\nScholz was also politically effective in promoting his field. He\nassembled the “Gruppe von Münster” (later\n“Schule von Münster”) and encouraged a number of his\nstudents to undertake studies in logic and foundations, placing some\nof them in academic positions. They obtained important results in the\ntheory of the predicate calculus, the theory of axiomatic systems,\nmetamathematics, semantics and abstraction theory. Among them were\nFriedrich Bachmann (1909–1982), Albrecht Becker (1907–?),\nGisbert Hasenjaeger (1919–2006), Hans Hermes (1912–2003),\nWalter Kinder (1909–?), Karl Schröter (1905–1977),\nand Hermann Schweitzer (1909–?). For the publication of the\nresults of his school and related investigations Scholz founded the\nseries Forschungen zur Logik und zur Grundlegung der exakten\nWissenschaften (eight issues 1937–1943, n.s. reprinted as\nScholz, ed. 1970), among them the outstanding book by Heinrich Scholz\nand Hermann Schweitzer Die sogenannten Definitionen durch\nAbstraktion with its elaboration of modern abstraction theory\nusing equivalence classes (Scholz and Schweitzer 1935). \n\nIn trying to establish a world-leading center of logic at\nMünster, he was able to obtain Frege’s Nachlass\nfor his Münster chair in 1935. Later he added to this collection\nthe papers of the German algebraist of logic, Ernst Schröder\n(1841–1902), which he had obtained from the library of the\nTechnical University of Karlsruhe. It is one of the tragic events of\nWorld War II that Frege’s and Schröder’s papers are\nlost, perhaps destroyed during the bomb attacks on Münster in\nMarch 1945 (cf.  Peckhaus 1993; Wehmeier and Schmidt am Busch\n2000). Scholz had intended to publish a three volume edition of\nFrege’s posthumous work and correspondence. Most of the\ntypewritten copies Scholz had made of the original material were\nsaved (on the Frege papers cf. Scholz and Bachmann 1936). \n\nIn the beginning of the 1930s Münster still stood in the shadow\nof Göttingen and Berlin as a center of research on logic.\nNevertheless, Scholz tried to establish a world center for research on\nlogic and foundations. After the National Socialists' seizure of\npower, most of German language logicians lost their positions and were\nforced into emigration. Only Münster survived as a place where\nresearch on logic and foundations could be done. Scholz was successful\nin resisting the attacks from the side of the so-called\n“Deutsche Mathematik”, a National-Socialist racist\nmovement emphasizing the mathematical work of German “national\ncomrades” (Volksgenossen). The Munich mathematician Max\nSteck (1907–1971) was particularly hostile. Steck's\nbook, Das Hauptproblem der Mathematik (1942), is\ndirected against logicism, the axiomatic method and metamathematics,\nas proposed by logicians and mathematicians close to Hilbert and his\nschool. Steck labeled David Hilbert’s formalism as a\n“simply catastrophic” mental one-sidedness, a\n“decadence” from the perspective of intellectual history\n(Steck 1942, p. 205). In several places Scholz is attacked as\nHilbert’s spokesman. Steck calls Scholz’s Münster\nSchool a “transplantation of the earlier so-called Vienna Circle\nto Münster in Westphalia” (p. 176). \n\nDuring the Third Reich Scholz served as a kind of information broker,\nmediating contacts between émigrés and those who stayed\nbehind. He was able to support his Polish friends, helping, e.g., to\nrescue Jan Salamucha (1903–1944) from the concentration camp in\nSachsenhausen in 1940 (an action for which German authorities\nthreatened him with removal from his professorial chair). He supported\nAlfred Tarski (1901–1983) who had emigrated to the U.S.A., by\nmaintaining contact with his wife and his two children, who still\nlived in Warsaw. He supported Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1956)\nand his wife financially and was eventually able to help them to leave\nPoland and to hide in Germany. They feared for their lives in case the\nRed Army would conquer Poland (cf. Bolewski and Pierzchała 1989,\nSchreiber 1999, Peckhaus 1998–1999, Schmidt am Busch and\nWehmeier 2005b). \n\nScholz and his followers adopted the scientific world view as\nadvocated by the philosophers of the neo-positivistic movement, in\nparticular of the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Society for Scientific\nPhilosophy. But contrary to this movement, he applied the scientific\nworld view even to metaphysics. This was observed with reservations.\nOtto Neurath, e.g., mentioned Scholz and the Münster Group as\nhaving contributed much of value, but Scholz “represents\nnevertheless a full blown metaphysics” (Neurath 1937, reprint\nNeurath 1981, pp. 804–805) which has to be rejected. The\nrelation between Neurath and Scholz remained ambivalent. They at least\nmet at the First International Congress for Unity of Science at Paris\nin September 1935. The congress saw the establishment of a committee\nfor the standardization of logical symbolism with members of the\nVienna Circle, the Hilbert School and the Münster Group. The\ninitiative had come from Scholz and his school. The results of the\ncommittee’s negotiations were presented at the Forth\nInternational Congress for the Unity of Science at Cambridge (England)\nin July 1938 (cf. Peckhaus 2008, pp. 78–80; Behman et al.\n1937/38). \n\nScholz dedicated his Religionsphilosophie (1921) to his\nteachers Adolf von Harnack and Alois Riehl (on Scholz’s\nphilosophy of religion cf. Molendijk 1991, Ratschow 1958, Stock 1987,\nWimmer 2005). According to Scholz, philosophy of religion does not\ndeal with religion as such, but with its possibility, based on the\nfact of its reality in the sense of Kant’s critical philosophy\n(p. VIII).  Religion becomes, thus, a philosophical problem. Scholz\ndefines philosophy of religion in the widest sense as the application\nof philosophical means and presupposition of reasoning to the fact of\nreligion (pp. 1–2). Religion is understood as part of culture\nbeing the epitome of creations of the human mind, the existence of\nwhich is preferred to their non-existence (p. 14). The object of\nanalysis is empirical religion, i.e. religion as it is practiced in\nreal life or as it is tangible. With this he deviates from\nconstructive types of the philosophy of religion as they can be found,\ne.g., in the work of Immanuel Kant. In conclusion he determines that\nphilosophy of religion has an integrating function in a philosophy of\ncultural values. It consists in philosophical reflection on tangible\n(erlebbare) religion as it is practiced and, in particular,\nin reflection on expressions of religious consciousness whose truth is\nsubject to reason. So religion never ceased to be a philosophical\nproblem. \n\nThe year 1921 marks a big change in Scholz’s focus of\nphilosophical research. He himself tells the story that he discovered\nhis love for mathematical logic by accidentally coming across\nWhitehead’s and Russell’s Principia Mathematica\n(Whitehead and Russell 1910–13, cf. Peckhaus 2005) in the\nlibrary of the University of Kiel. This work convinced Scholz of the\nsignificance of mathematics, although he had at that time no deeper\nknowledge of this subject. As a full professor of Philosophy he\ndecided to begin formal university studies of Mathematics and\nTheoretical Physics. After having moved to Münster, Scholz\nfocused his research on Mathematical Logic and Foundations. \n\nHe worked particularly on the borderline between Mathematics and\nPhilosophy, motivated by the problem of distinguishing logical calculi\nfrom general calculi. He supported David Hilbert’s foundational\nprogram having led to Metamathematics and Proof Theory, but focused on\nlanguage and semantics. Language is necessary to present logical\nsystems. He suggests a formalized language with a degree of exactness\neven exceeding the exactness of mathematical languages. He calls this\nlanguage “Leibniz language” L (cf. Scholz\n1944). Leibniz languages are symbolic languages with exactly defined\nmeans of expression. Each expression is a finite string of characters\nusing a given symbolism according to well-determined rules.  If the\nmeans of expression are restricted in such a way that (1) these\nexpressions always have sense, and (2) it is decidable whether the\nproduced expressions are true in all possible worlds (universally\nvalid, allgemeingültig), then L is called a\n“Universal Leibniz Language”. A universally valid\nfundamental expression is called a Leibniz Theorem. A logic calculus\nis defined as a set of truths presentable by a Leibniz theorem over\nL. \n\nThe close relation between logic and metaphysics is the topic of\nScholz’s book Metaphysik als strenge Wissenschaft\n(Scholz 1941). In this book metaphysics is dealt with as an ontology in\nthe sense of a theory comprising the entirety of truths. It can be\nlinguistically expressed and it deals with things which can be\nunderstood as individuals. These truths are not restricted to\nparticular domains, but are valid for all non-empty domains in all\npossible worlds (pp. 13–14). Metaphysics as a rigorous science implies\nthe construction of a formalized “precision language”. In\nthis book Scholz uses the language of first order predicate calculus\nwith identity. A central notion is “universal validity”\n(Allgemeingültigkeit), understood as a metaphysical\nnotion (validity in all possible worlds). This notion is applied to an\naxiomatized theory of identity and difference. \n\nScholz analyzed classical metaphysical doctrines with his logical\ntool of a predicate calculus with identity. His considerations are\nbased on a special variation of a Platonic ontology combined with\nLeibniz’s notion of possible worlds, the Frege-Russell\nmathematical logic, Hilbert’s axiomatic method and Tarski’s\nsemantics. This approach found its final expression in the influential\ntextbook Grundzüge der mathematischen Logik which was\nelaborated, co-authored, and published by Gisbert Hasenjaeger after\nScholz’s death (Scholz and Hasenjaeger 1961). Hasenjaeger later\ncalled its philosophical background “discrete ontology”, a\nrealistic position: “The world of concrete (or also abstract)\nthings consists just of things which have some\nfeatures and do not have others; between them some relations are given,\nothers not” (Hasenjaeger 1962, pp. 30–31). \n\nIn 1952 Scholz published together with Hans Hermes the section\n“Mathematische Logik” in the Enzyklopädie der\nMathematischen Wissenschaften (Hermes and Scholz 1952), a\ncomprehensive survey of classical, bivalent and decidable logic. They\nfocused on sentential logic based on the notion of universal validity\n(Allgemeingültigkeit). They argued for the priority of\nsemantical over syntactical considerations. \n\nScholz’s most important contributions to the development of\nlogic can be seen in his contributions to the historiography of logic.\nHe stressed the value of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz (1646–1716) and Bernard Bolzano (1781–1848) for\nthe emergence of modern logic. He applied the method of logical\nanalysis to classical philosophical texts, reconsidering, e. g.,\nAnselm’s proof of the existence of God (Scholz 1950/51),\nDescartes’s cogito argument (Scholz 1931b), and\nKant’s transcendental deduction (Scholz 1943/44). He devoted\nconsiderable efforts to the study of Gottlob Frege’s work\n(cf. Sundholm 2005) and promoted David Hilbert’s metamathematics\n(Scholz 1942). With his Geschichte der Logik (1931a),\nHeinrich Scholz was a pioneer in the historiography of modern\nlogic. Scholz restricted his presentation to formal logic or\nlogistics. He reconstructs its development starting with\nAristotle’s logic, discussing the Stoic modifications, medieval\nand early modern variations, arriving at Franz Brentano’s\n(1838–1917) contributions, whom he called the “only\noriginal figure among the German formal logicians [in philosophy] of\nthe 19th century after Bolzano and prior\nto Husserl” (pp. 46–47). For Scholz, the modern\nshape of logic starts with Leibniz: “We speak of a sunrise\nmentioning the great name of Leibniz. With him a new life of\nAristotelian logic begins, which finds its most beautiful\nmanifestation in our days in the modern exact logic in the form of\nlogistics” (p. 48). He highlighted Gottlob Frege as “the\ngreatest genius of the new logic in the 19th century”\n(p. 57). According to Scholz, he did more than any other logician for\nthe interpretation of fundamental mathematical concepts with the help\nof fundamental concepts of logic operating on the basis of exactly\ndefined principles.  With this he raised the logical calculus to a\nlevel which made the Leibnizian “game with signs”\npossible. \n\nHeinrich Scholz was important as an integrating figure in the\ndevelopment of logic in the first half of the 20th century.\nHe kept Mathematical Logic in touch with Philosophy. With his focus on\nsemantics he set the agenda for the development after World War II.\nImportant academics of German postwar logic, including Gisbert\nHasenjaeger and Hans Hermes, were his students.","contact.mail":"volker.peckhaus@upb.de","contact.domain":"upb.de"}]
