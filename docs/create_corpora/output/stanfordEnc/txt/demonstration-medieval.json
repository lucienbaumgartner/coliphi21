Elaborated\nlargely in commentaries and discussions of the Posterior\nAnalytics itself, but also sometimes in independent opuscula on\nspecific problems, or in discussions of the knowledge of God in\ncommentaries to the prologue of the Sentences, this body of\nphilosophical literature corresponds to modern Philosophy of\nScience. In particular, the problems how we come to know causal laws,\nhow scientific knowledge differs from other sorts of cognition, how\nmathematical knowledge differs from other sorts of scientific\nknowledge, and why mathematical knowledge is more certain, are\nexplored in this literature. Although the discussion followed\nAristotle's views closely, each interpreter read his views in a way\nthat would square them with his own metaphysical system, so that the\nmost important Aristotelian writers of the thirteenth century, Albert\nthe Great, Thomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome, revised the initial,\nAugustinian, reading of Robert Grosseteste's commentary. Aristotle\nhimself was obscure on a number of points, and so radical Aristotelian\nauthors fell into disputes among themselves over the exact character\nof the “highest sort of demonstration” (demonstratio\npotissima), and the nature of the scientific knowledge resulting\nfrom it. These disputes were rooted in part in earlier disputes among\nthe Arabic commentators, as reported in Averroes's\ncommentaries. Ockham and his followers developed yet another reading\nof the science of demonstrations to fit their nominalist\nmetaphysics in the fourteenth century, and in the later Middle Ages\ntheir views and those of Aquinas dominated the scene. In later\nTerminist commentaries, such as that of Antony Coronel in 1510, it is\nassumed that scientific knowledge is a natural form caused in the mind\nby knowledge of the premisses of a demonstration, and it is treated as\na subject of puzzles concerning beginning and ceasing, and the like,\ntypical of the sophismata discussed in that school. In the sixteenth\ncentury other controversies moved to the fore, over the application of\nthe “Science of Demonstration” to mathematics, and\nconcerning the manner of discovery of a demonstration through\n“analysis and synthesis.” In the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries, with the new Platonisms, the anti-Aristotelian\nbias of the new science, and developing empiricism, the theory of\ndemonstration came to be ignored in mainstream philosophy, although it\npersists as an element of Thomism. Moreover, though the theory\ndisappeared, much of the new Empiricist viewpoint in fact carries over\nfrom the Ockhamist version of it.\n\n\n\nA demonstration in Aristotle is a syllogism that produces scientific\nknowledge. Scientific knowledge is knowledge not simply that something\nis the case, but why it is the case, what causes bring it\nabout. Perhaps we would do better to call it a scientific understanding\nof the fact known. This means that one may have cognition that\nsomething is true which is quite certain without having scientific\nknowledge, and Aristotle's Posterior Analytics is not a\ntreatise on what we might nowadays call general epistemology. To\nproduce and transmit scientific understanding, Aristotle thought we had\nto duplicate, in the deductive order of the science, the order of\ncauses found in reality. Just as the causes can be traced back to first\ncauses rooted in the nature of the thing known, so the science must\narise from first principles associated with the real definition of the\nthing known expressing its nature. \n\nIt is notorious that Aristotle's syllogistic logic cannot capture the\nlogic of relations, and so is inadequate to the task of presenting the\ndeductive structure of mathematics. This difficulty was handled in\npractice by placing the relational arguments outside the formal\nstructure of syllogistic which formed the framework of a science. The\nprinciples of a demonstration, Aristotle thought, always had to be\nuniversal, reporting, as they do, necessary connections. Now he was\naccustomed to showing universal truths through one sort of\n‘setting forth’ (ekthesis), working out the thing\ninformally in a particular case and then using universal\ngeneralization to establish the universal truth. (Posterior\nAnalytics I 4, 73b33-74a4 clearly sets out the procedure.) The\n‘setting forth’ stood outside the formal structure of the\nsyllogistic, and it allowed the establishment of universal premises\nwith complex terms, for instance, a premise to the effect that\n“every\ntriangle-with-its-base-extended-so-as-to-form-an-external-angle is\na\ntriangle-with-its-external-angle-equal-to-the-sum-of-the-two-angles-opposite-it-in-the-triangle.”\nAristotle here uses the term “universal” to mean not only\nthat the predicate belonged in every case to the subject, but also\nthat it could not be proved of the subject simply because of its\nbelonging to some wider universal to which that subject also\nbelonged. So it would not do to show by ‘setting forth’\nand assume as a first principle that an isosceles triangle has its\nangles equal to two right angles, for this is because it is a\ntriangle, not because it is an isosceles triangle. A first principle\nmust be not just universally quantified, but commensurately\nuniversal, so that the predicate belongs to the subject in every case,\nand belongs to whatever else it belongs to because it belongs\nto that subject, and because whatever else it belongs to, essentially\nor accidentally, falls under that subject. \n\nAristotle does not lay down tight rules for discovering first\nprinciples, though he points out that one needs a good deal of\nexperience of the subject, and that if we possess the first principles\nthey will explain why the subject has the attributes it does. His book\nproceeds by explaining the logical form into which a science must be\nput if it is to be transmitted to an ideal student. He takes the\nmathematics of his time to be the paradigmatic science. \n\nA demonstrative science then, requires for its being understood (1)\nan understanding of the terms entering into it (later commentators\nsuggest that “nominal definitions” provide this), (2)\nknowledge of certain axioms applicable to many sciences (for instance,\nthe law of the excluded middle), (3) knowledge of first principles,\nthat is,indemonstrable truths proper to the science under consideration\n(PA I 1, 71a11-17; 2, 72a14-22; 10), (4) knowledge of real\ndefinitions of the subject of the science, and its various species and\npredicates (PA I 33, 89a18; II 3, 90b24; 13, 96b23; 17,\n99b22). The principles of a demonstration must be true, indemonstrable,\nand such as to provide the reason for the truth of the conclusion, but\nthey must also be necessary and per se (PA I 2). These last\ntwo requirements were variously interpreted by medieval thinkers, but\nwe can note that Aristotle allows a statement can be per se in two\nways: (1) if its subject term somehow includes its predicate within its\ndefinition, so that “A human being is rational” is per se,\nand (2) if its predicate term includes its subject implicitly in its\ndefinition as the proper subject for that sort of accident, so that\n“A human being is able to laugh” is per se (PA I\n4, 73a35-b24. (There are two other senses of “per se” given\nhere, and although it is reasonably supposed they have no bearing on\ndemonstration, some medieval commentators tried\nto make something of them.) The middle term of a demonstration must\nexpress the cause why the predicate of the conclusion belongs to its\nsubject. The predicate of the conclusion, the “attribute,”\nwill not be part of the essence of the subject, but will somehow follow\non its essence. It was disputed in the Middle Ages whether the middle\nterm in the highest sort of demonstration would be the real definition\nof the subject, or the real definition of the attribute, or somehow include both, but it was\ngenerally agreed that it would be a real definition, and that one of\nthe premisses of a demonstration would express a necessary truth not\nderivable by a simple analysis of either the nominal or the real\ndefinition of its subject. (The central text here, and that a very\ndifficult one suggesting a number of different possible lines of\nanalysis, is PA II 8-10.) \n\nVarious sorts of demonstration falling short of this ideal model,\nbecause they do not give a full explanation of the cause why the fact\nis true, were allowed in Aristotle's text (PA I 13), and the\nmedieval authors refer to these as demonstration that it is the case\n(quia) as opposed to demonstration why it is the case\n(propter quid). Most important here is the sort of\ndemonstration which argues from the cause to the effect rather than\neffect to cause, for instance, the demonstration that stars, unlike the\nplanets, are far away because they twinkle, and whatever twinkles is\nfar away. Twinkling, of course, does not cause the stars to be far\naway, but rather, the distance causes the twinkling. This sort of\ndemonstration plays a role in discussions of analysis and synthesis in\nthe fifteenth century. Demonstrations concerning particulars, and\ndemonstrations arguing from theorems in the science which are not\ntraced back to first principles, are also demonstrations that it is the\ncase. \n\nAnother important case is that in which principles are imported from\nanother science to complete a demonstration. So if one proves that\ncircular wounds heal more slowly because they have a large ratio of\narea to circumference, and healing proceeds at the edge of a wound, one\nhas borrowed, in medicine, a principle from geometry. The physician\n(qua physician) need not know this principle (that is, he need not know\nthe reason why it is so, so that he is able to prove it), but may rely\non the authority of the geometer (without being open to criticism as a\nphysician). In such a case the demonstration is said to be\n“subalternate” to another science, and the nature of this\nsubalternation provided a subject for debate between more Augustinian\nand more Aristotelian commentators on Aristotle. \n\nAlthough Boethius reports a translation of Themistius's paraphrase\nof the Posterior Analytics into Latin, and may have done a\ntranslation himself, neither of these works survived into the Middle\nAges. The Latins first became acquainted with the work through the\ntranslation of James of Venice between 1125 and 1150. John of Salisbury\nbenefits from James in his Metalogicon, giving a list of\npoints from the work there (Book IV 6-8). The James translation became\nthe vulgate, and the translation done for Thomas Aquinas by William\nMoerbeke never received much usage. Translations of Themistius's\nparaphrase of the work, and a lost work by al-Farabi on demonstration\n(or perhaps Averroes's critical remarks on that work), were used by\nAlbert the Great, and though they dropped out of circulation soon\nthereafter, scholars sometimes cribbed from Albert's commentary. The\ncommentary of Alexander of Aphrodisias (or the commentary of\nPhiloponus, which is close to Alexander) was translated by James of\nVenice. This translation also quickly dropped out of circulation, but\nmuch of its content survived in marginal glosses. The Middle Commentary\nof Averroes was translated by William of Luna around 1300, but was not\nused before the latter half of the fifteenth century, though Albert the\nGreat seems to have some knowledge of Averroes, and so his doctrines\nwere not without influence. \n\nThe Posterior Analytics was little known in the twelfth\ncentury, despite James of Venice's translation, then. Though earlier\ndiscussions are to be noted, such as that of Richard Rufus (see Rega\nWood (1996)), the work first enters into the Western tradition in a\nserious way in the commentary of Robert Grosseteste (1175-1253),\nwritten around 1230. Grosseteste applies the theory in the\nPosterior Analytics to itself, presenting it as a\ndemonstrative science of demonstration. Thus he suggests that Aristotle\nfirst gives a definition of demonstration, a syllogism producing\nscientific knowledge, and a definition of scientific knowledge, and\nthen, in a series of syllogisms, deduces the properties that a\ndemonstration must have, first considered in itself as a free-standing\nsyllogism, then considered in relation to other demonstrations, and\nfinally considered as it is part of a science. The second book of the\nwork, he claims, discusses the art of definition as the way to discover\ndemonstrations, and how it is that definition occurs as the middle term\nand the cause of the truth of the conclusion, in a demonstration. He\nfinds thirty-two scientific conclusions in each of the two books, and\nhis list of conclusions forms the standard summary of the work for many\nlater writers. This analysis is most plausible in the beginning of Book\nI, and the initially structured presentation degenerates to a mere list\nof points made, often with little evident deductive structure, in the\ndiscussion of the latter part of Book I and in Book II. Many portions\nof the book are treated, plausibly enough, as ancillary to the\ndeductive science, concerned, for instance, with disproving common\nerrors. \n\nBefore Grosseteste, Aristotle's text was considered very difficult,\nboth in doctrine and in language, and it seems to have caused some\nconcern because of its apparent disagreement with the dominant\nAugustinian theory of knowledge. Grosseteste not only explained the\nbook clearly, but also reconciled it with Augustine by treating\ndemonstration as the means by which a fallen humanity must come to\nknowledge of the world. Augustine's Neoplatonic account of knowledge is\nreserved for our restored or supernaturally assisted nature in its\ncontemplation of God, or of the natural world in God. No doubt,\nGrosseteste's position as a well-known and conservative Bishop helped\nto legitimize the science of demonstration for his more conservative\nreaders. \n\nGrosseteste suggests that if the mind were healthy, and unaffected\nby the Fall, it would be able to see in God the exemplary forms of all\nthe things he had created. But as it is, such knowledge of exemplary\nforms is impossible, though the light of God illumines the forms of\nparticular things that we encounter in the world so that we can come to\nknow them. Such forms are in themselves universal and unchanging\n(indeed, in themselves they are the same as, though not numerically\nidentical with, exemplary forms), and so they can ground necessary\ntruths. But the knowledge of a real definition of a substance, of a\nsimple form, does not impart knowledge of its causal powers. (Ockham,\nit will be noted, shares this view.) For instance, the knowledge of the\ncausal power of scammony to purge red bile arises only after we observe\na number of cases where it does this, and so come to form an\naestimatio that it does in this or that particular case. (An\naestimatio is produced in the senses, and can be formed by\nirrational animals. It is a kind of perception of a particular causal\nconneciton, and is not necessarily correct. The idea seems to have come\nfrom Augustine, De Libero Arbitrio II.) Then, spurred on by\nthis aestimatio, reason proposes an experiment, and introduces\nscammony when every other cause for the purging of red bile is absent,\nand if it often draws out red bile under these conditions, reason\nconcludes that it is a causal power of scammony to do this. The\nintellect's ability to frame a universal concept after it becomes\nfamiliar with particular individuals through the senses is paralleled\nby its ability to form universal causal judgments after sensory\naestimatio informs it of particular causal events.\n(Grosseteste (1981) I 14, lines 252-271.) \n\nThis knowledge of causal laws is knowledge of what a given agent is\nsuited to do, but it is knowledge of what it will actually do only\nfor the most part. This is not knowledge of what it will do\nmost of the time, or even frequently, but of what it will do of itself\nas long as nothing is present to prevent it from doing it. It occurs\nthrough knowledge of “material definitions” which depend on\nprior, “formal definitions.” The formal definition of a\nthing specifies its function, and involves a final cause, while its\nmaterial definition specifies how it must be constructed so as to\nperform that function, that is, to be an efficient cause of certain\neffects. The formal definition tells us what the exemplary form is,\nwhile the material definition specifies how that form and its causal\nactivity are actually realized in matter. (The distinction between\nformal and material definition relies on an interpolation from\nAlexander/Philoponus's commentary in the text of James's translation of\nPosterior Analytics II 19. From Aquinas on people were aware\nof this error in the translation.) Knowledge of mathematical truth\noccurs without any efficient or final cause in the picture, and we can\nsee triangles, for instance, as they really are in themselves with a\ndirect mental view, rather than attempting to reconstruct them, as we\ndo in the case of thunder, for instance, where we know that some\nphysical arrangement is producing a noise (has that as its function, as\nit were), but cannot view that physical arrangement directly. Thus\nmathematical demonstrations are higher (potior) than natural\ndemonstrations, since what they show is always the case, and\nthey are more easily known. (Grosseteste (1981) I 18, lines\n119-126.) \n\nKnowledge of what is “for the most part” includes\nknowledge concerning eclipses, and eclipses, of course, only rarely\noccur. How can there be knowledge of, and necessary truths about, what,\nmost of the time, does not even exist? For one thing, eclipses are\nalways present in their “causal reasons,” that is, in the\nmotions of the sun and moon, which guarantee that eclipses occur now\nand again, and, moreover, we can say that it is always true that\nif a certain situation occurs, in which no impediments are\npresent, an eclipse will occur necessarily due to the nature of the\nMoon. (Grosseteste (1981) I 18, lines 189-214.) \n\nOne science can be subalternate to another, according to\nGrosseteste, in several ways. In one, a science, say Music, the science\nof audible proportion, falls under another, in this case the science of\nproportion, but it is not a part of that science, since audibility is\nan accident of proportion, not a difference which establishes some\nspecies of it. Arithmetical and geometrical proportion, for instance,\nare species of proportion, and so the science of arithmetical or\ngeometrical proportion would be a part of the science of proportion,\nnot subalternate to it. He says in this case that the one science falls\nunder the other univocally, since both are said to deal with\nproportion. Now audible proportion may be no more than an accidental\nunity, but it is still the case, Grosseteste holds, that proportion is\na necessary formal part of the real nature of harmony, just as its\naudibility is. So the subject of music, harmony, is, as it were,\nproportion realized in a certain matter, just as the actual material\nconstitution of a natural object is the realization of some higher\nform, say that of an animal, the nature of whose functioning can be\nunderstood quite independently of the realization of it in that\nparticular matter. Grosseteste sees subalternation as a phenomenon\nrevealing a deep metaphysical truth, the truth that a natural material\nobject is always the realization in matter of some higher form that is\nwhat it is quite independently of that realization. So he does\nnot consider the case of the circular wound as subalternation,\nfor circularity in no way constitutes or realizes the function of a\nwound. Medicine is not even in part subalternate to mathematics.\n(Grosseteste (1981) I 12, lines 153-198.) In a second case of true\nsubalternation, Grosseteste holds, the science of the parts of a thing,\nwhich realize its functioning, must be brought into play to understand\nthe thing. So the science of harmony is subalternate to the science of\nnumbers, Arithmetic, for numbers are the parts of proportions, and must\nbe known if proportions are to be known, even if proportions are not\nnumbers in the way that audible proportions are proportions. So the one\nscience falls under the other “almost univocally.”\nSimilarly, medicine is subalternate to the science of the elements,\neven though the elements are not strictly parts of the body (not\nfunctional parts), since they still enter into its constitution and so\nmust be understood if the body is to be understood. \n\nThis account of subordination was intimately connected with\nGrosseteste's metaphysics. He thought that the material world arose\nfrom light, which propagates itself in a straight line through space,\nso that matter can only be understood as arising from light in accord\nwith mathematical laws. Thus natural science will be subalternate to\nmathematics, for even though mathematics is not the science of the\nhigher form, of light, considered in itself, it does govern the way in\nwhich light realizes itself in space. The fact that the science of\nnature depends on mathematics is a clue that the natural world\noriginates from a higher form in accord with mathematics. Similarly, a\nliving being comes about when a higher form lends functions of\ndigestion, reproduction, sensation and the like to matter, these\nfunctions being accomplished by the causal operations of matter, so\nthat the biological sciences are subalternate to natural science. \n\nGrosseteste identifies two types of demonstration of the highest\nsort, natural and mathematical. His analysis of natural demonstrations\ndepends on a distinction between formal and material definition, which\nwas interpolated into the text of Posterior Analytics II 9 and\nseems to come from the James translation of the commentary of Alexander\n(= Philoponus?). The interpolated text suggests that a formal\ndefinition might serve as the middle term in a demonstration, proving\nthe material definition of the subject. For example, one might\ndemonstrate that anger is the boiling of blood around the heart (its\nmaterial definition), by using as the middle term the formal definition\nof anger, the desire to do harm to another. Of course, one would have\nto know a first principle asserting that whatever fits the formal\ndefinition must realize the functioning it expresses in that material\nform, and one would have to know what anger really is, in its own\nproper form. Again, drawing on Aristotle's example in Posterior\nAnalytics II 8, thunder is a noise made in a cloud (formal\ndefinition), and such a noise, in a cloud, is made (only) when fire is\nextinguished in it, and so thunder is the extinction of fire in a\ncloud. \n\nA demonstration of the highest sort in mathematics does not, of\ncourse, work out the mechanism by which some function must be\naccomplished, so in this case the middle term will be the formal\ndefinition of the subject, stated in terms of its parts (so a\ndefinition of a triangle will be in terms of the lines making it up,\nthe definition of a number in terms of the units making it up, and so\non). The attribute, rather than a material definition, will simply be\nthe property proved of the subject. \n\nIn both these sorts of demonstration, Grosseteste holds, the major\npremise and conclusion are per se in the second way, that is,\nthe subject is somehow presupposed in their predicates. The minor\npremise, since it predicates a formal definition of its subject, is\nper se in the first way (the subject contains the predicate).\nSo in the case of a natural demonstration, the subject is the causal\noutcome of the predicate (the noise, or thunder, results from the\nextinction of fire in a cloud), and is presupposed in it inasmuch as\nthe point of the material events is to produce that outcome. It is as\nif one were to say that the construction of an adding machine\npresupposes the notion that it adds, because it is in order to do this\nthat it has a structure which causes addition. Final and efficient\ncausation does not figure in mathematical demonstrations, but in any\nproper demonstration, Grosseteste thinks, the conclusion will not\nmerely assign a predicate that belongs universally to its subject, but\none that is commensurately universal with it. That is, one\nwon't have identified the real underlying cause why a figure has a\nproperty if it belongs to some larger class of figures that have the\nproperty, unless one demonstrates that this larger class has it, and\nthen appends, as it were, a note to the effect that the figure falls\nwithin the larger class. That means that a demonstration of the highest\nsort will always show a property to belong to something which not only\nhas it necessarily, but which is also necessary to produce that\nproperty. So the conclusion and the major premise will have to be\nper se in the second way, for the subject will be the\nnecessarily underlying cause of the property. Nothing else can\nproduce it. \n\nThe earliest commentary on the Posterior Analytics other\nthan Grosseteste's to gain any general currency in Europe was that of\nAlbert the Great (ca. 1200-1280), written between 1245 and 1260. His\ncommentary takes a different form from Grosseteste's. It is composed of\nten Treatises on each of the two books of Aristotle's work, each\ntreatise approaching a topic as a subject of controversy, on which\nAlbert reports every view he can find from Arabic and Ancient\ncommentators, as well as the moderns. It also has different content,\nfor as an Aristotelian, Albert objected to Grosseteste's metaphysical\nviews, and this led him to a different reading of the Posterior\nAnalytics. \n\nThe most obvious difference is in Albert's views of the\nsubalternation of one science to another, and the role of mathematics\nin the natural sciences. Since Albert does not accept a substantial\nform of a thing that acts as an exemplar to preexisting matter, and\ndoes not accept the development of lower forms of individuals from\nhigher forms in the mind of God, he rejects the notion that\n“natural things are founded on mathematical being, and\nmathematical being on divine being … so that the principles of\nnatural being are mathematical.” (Albert the Great,\nCommentary on the Metaphysics, Book I Chapter 1.) For Albert\nthe unity of a particular thing is rooted in its particular substantial\nform, and does not arise as an expression of a higher, mathematical\nunity, nor can any knowledge of particular natures in themselves be\nobtained through reflection on being itself, or other higher forms.\nEach science must stand on its own, and we cannot even derive the\nspecies from its genus, much less from its mathematically expressible\naccidents.The new account of subalternation worked out by Albert was\naccepted in general by later Aristotelians (for instance, in Ockham,\nSumma Logicae III.II 21), and Grosseteste's account was\nabandoned. \n\nConsider the science of harmony. Grosseteste had said that it was\nsubalternate univocally to the science of proportion, for a harmony is\na proportion realized in sounds. Albert objects that in a demonstration\nwithin the science of harmony, the real explanation why it is so does\nnot occur in the science of proportion, for the subject of the science\nis sounds, not proportions, and what is true of proportions cannot be\napplied to harmonies directly, as though a sound were a mathematical\nentity. Sounds do have certain mathematically expressible accidents,\nbut the science of proportions does not establish the substance or\nnature of sounds. It bears only on those accidents. The two sciences\nare not univocal, that is, they do not have the same subject. Rather,\nthe subject of the higher science is an accident of the subject of the\nlower science. So the subject of harmony is a certain kind of sound,\nnot a certain kind of proportion. To explain why, we will have to trace\nthe fact, not from the nature of proportionality, striving to introduce\nitself into a certain kind of material, but from the nature of sound.\nNature operates by its own principles, and if it accomplishes the aims\nof some higher form, this is because God created it so that it would\naccomplish those aims of itself. God created it from nothing, rather\nthan its evolving from a higher form striving to realize itself in\nmatter. \n\nFrom this Albert concludes that the science of the human body might\nbe subalternated to mathematics, after all, and when Aristotle says\nmedicine is not subalternate to geometry, he only means that the whole\nof medicine is not subalternate to geometry in the way that the whole\nof optics is, say. Instead, only a few medical demonstrations are\nsubalternate to geometry. They are, however, subalternate to geometry\nin exactly the same way as the demonstrations in optics are, for optics\nis the science of light, and geometry bears only on certain accidents\nof light, not on light itself, and does not explain why light has those\naccidents. \n\nThomas Aquinas agrees with Albert on these matters. In his literal\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics (1269-72) he notes that\nmathematics bears on matter because of the nature of matter, which\nleads it to have mathematical accidents, dimensions, that is, accidents\nwhich can be abstracted from matter and considered on their own in the\nmathematical disciplines without relation to matter. It is only in the\nintellect, through abstraction, that they become separated from matter,\nand their presence in matter is due to the nature of matter, not to any\nsort of prior mathematical reality. But there is something here that is\nnot in Albert, for Albert does not allow the possibility that the\nnature of a thing can cause it to have properties that are not part of\nits essence. He thinks that every accident in a thing is to be traced\nto another accident in the thing, or some accident of something outside\nwhich brings it about that the accident inheres, but that no accident,\nnot even an attribute, that is, a proper accident necessarily belonging\nto that sort of thing, is caused in it by its essence. To Albert's\nmind, this would mean that the nature of a thing, considered in itself\nand not insofar as it is a particular in particular circumstances,\nwould efficiently cause its attribute to inhere in it, and that smacks\nof Platonism, of the view that separated universals somehow play a\ncausal role in the world. Thomas argues that a thing's nature\nefficiently causes its primary attribute, and that it does so\nnecessarily and without exception. This means that the primary\nattribute is always a propensity or capacity, not an actual inherence\nof an occurrent quality, since, of course, the actual inherence of an\noccurrent quality depends on the right conditions being in place for\nthe operation of the capacity to have that quality. Albert allows that\nsuch propensities are necessary in their subjects, and he agrees that\nthey are not part of the subject's essence, so that they follow\ndeductively from its nature, but he allows no sort of efficient\ncausation any role in this process. Efficient causation of this sort is\nreferred to in later Thomistic writers as\n“emanation”—so Cajetan in his commentary on the\nSumma Theologiae I, questions 54 and 77, and Suarez in his\ndiscussion of efficient causation in Metaphysical Disputation\n18.3. But such efficient causation is an impossibility for Albert, for\nAlbert takes it that all efficient causation connects actualities (an\nassumption he perhaps got from Averroes), and seems to take\npropensities and capacities as nothing more than descriptions how\nefficient causality works for one or another kind of thing. \n\nPart of the issue rests on the requirement that first principles,\nwhich assert primary, indemonstrable attributes of their subjects, be\nnecessary truths. Thomas takes it that they must be strictly necessary,\nuniversally true in every case at every time. Albert thinks the\nnecessity involved here is of another sort, a conditional necessity, so\nthat the attribute belongs to its subject necessarily, if nothing\nprevents it. Thus he can identify an actuality as a primary\nattribute, allowing that possession of the attribute by the subject\nonly occurs “for the most part,” and still identify the\nfirst principle asserting this possession of the attribute as a\nnecessary truth. It seems that Thomas Aquinas was less radically\nAristotelian on this point than his master. The metaphysical difference\nled to a notorious and long-lasting dispute over the nature of the\nhighest sort of demonstration (demonstratio potissima). \n\nThomas Aquinas argued that the highest sort of demonstration had as\nits middle term the real definition of the subject term (Comm. on\nPA II 1.9, 7, 19). This led him to claim that the fourth way in\nwhich something can be per se pertained to demonstration, since it\nindicates an efficient causal connection, and the minor premise will be\ntrue in a demonstration because of the efficient causal connection\nbetween the essence of the subject, as expressed in its real\ndefinition, and the attribute proven of it, making it per se in the\nfourth way. \n\nAlbert the Great, with his more Aristotelian metaphysics, had argued\nthat a demonstration of the highest sort would have the definition of\nthe attribute as its middle term. This sort of definition is sometimes\ncalled a causal definition, and is the rough equivalent of a real\ndefinition for an attribute. In actuality, an attribute is an accident,\nand so has no proper real definition, indicating what it is\nentirely in itself, since what it is involves its belonging to\nan appropriate subject, and it actually belongs to such a subject only\nunder favorable conditions. So a “real” definition for the\nattribute would have to express things extrinsic to the attribute, its\nsubject and that which brings it to actuality in the subject. For this\nreason, Ockham insists that the definition of an attribute is a nominal\ndefinition, not a real one, and Aquinas holds that the conclusion of a\ndemonstration of the highest sort will be per se both in the second way\n(presupposing the subject) and the fourth (indicating efficient\ncausation) (Aquinas, Commentary on P.A. I 10). Albert's\npreference for the definition of the attribute follows Averroes's\nopinion that the highest sort of demonstration should demonstrate not a\nmere potentiality, but an actual state of affairs. Aquinas and the\nothers who held to his view recognized that a demonstrable attribute in\na natural thing would have to be a potentiality, though, of course, an\nactuality could be demonstrated in a mathematical demonstration, where\nefficient causation is not at issue, and an occurrent attribute can be\nshown to inhere in the subject necessarily and at every time. \n\nThere actually seems to be a good deal more support for Albert's\nview than for Thomas's in the Posterior Analytics. Albert\nrelies in particular on Aristotle's reference to the sort of definition\nthat includes every part of a demonstration, but arranged in a\ndifferent order (Posterior Analytics II 10), which he takes to\nbe the definition of the passion which is the middle term in a\ndemonstration, and on the examples of demonstration discussed in\nPosterior Analytics II 8. Aquinas finds little support for his\nposition in the Posterior Analytics, and resorts to De\nAnima I 1 to prove his point, so that much of his more detailed\ndiscussion of demonstration of the highest sort is in fact to be found\noutside the commentary on the Posterior Analytics. \n\nAlbert's position was defended after Aquinas by Giles of Rome, who\nwrote an extensive literal commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics in 1285, with many questions embedded in it, as well as\nan opusculum What is the Middle Term in Demonstration\n(1276-77). Giles follows Albert closely. Thomas had argued that\nAlbert's candidate for the highest sort of demonstration could not be\naccepted, because it assumed as its major premise that the definition\nof the attribute belongs to the subject. This, however, is\ndemonstrable, for the definition of the attribute belongs to the\nsubject only because of the subject's essential nature, if it in fact\nalways belongs to the subject, and if it does not always belong to the\nsubject, then the demonstration needs an additional premise, which is\nnot a necessary truth at all, to the effect that the external\nconditions needed for the subject to have its attribute are present. So\nprior to the proposed demonstration is a demonstration that the\ndefinition of the attribute belongs to the subject, because it belongs\nto whatever has the real definition of the subject. Giles's objection\nto this is that the major premise in such a demonstration is, as it\nwere, tautologous, there being no real distinction between the subject\nand its essence, and so the purported demonstration begs the question.\nIn order to avoid begging the question, both premisses would have to be\nsuch that there is a real distinction between subject and predicate.\nThe argument had been made against Albert's position that the\ndefinition of the attribute and the attribute itself were identical, so\nthat Albert's candidate for demonstration of the highest sort begged\nthe question, but Giles (and Ockham after him) points out that the\ndefinition of the attribute, being a causal definition of something\nwhose existence depends on other things, refers obliquely to things\nother than the attribute itself, and so is not in fact really identical\nwith it. The same point cannot be made in defense of the affirmation of\nthe real definition of the subject of the subject, and so Giles turned\nthe tables on his opponents. \n\nThis was a powerful objection. The standard reply to it is developed\nin John of Cornwall's Questions on the Posterior Analytics\n(1298-1300), and Walter Burleigh's Questions and\nCommentary on the Posterior Analytics (1300-10). John\nof Cornwall's work was at one time thought to be Scotus's, and it\ncertainly seems to reflect Scotus's thinking on this point (Opus\nOxoniensis I, Distinction 2, Question 2). The defense is to claim\nthat there are two sorts of concepts possible of a substance,\nquidditative concepts, which are captured in the real definition, and\nconcepts that express the quiddity only confusedly. Someone who does\nnot know what the quiddity of a lion is nonetheless may have a concept\nof lion if he has encountered lions, but his concept is\nnon-quidditative. To avoid begging the question in a demonstration of\nthe highest sort, one must assert the quidditative concept of the\nnon-quidditative concept of a substance. So, if one says that a lion\n(as commonly conceived) is in fact an animal with a certain genetic\ncode, say, this is not a mere tautology, for the notion of the genetic\ncode is not included in the everyday, non-quidditative concept of lion.\nGiles's reply is to the effect that the confused, simple concept of a\nsubstance possessed by the ordinary fellow in fact refers to the same\nreality as the real definition does, so that asserting the real\ndefinition of the confused concept simply asserts that the reality is\nitself, and so is a triviality, after all. This, of course, is not true\nof the definition of an attribute, since it obliquely refers to things\nother than the reality that is the attribute, namely its causes. So to\ndiscover the real definition of human and assert it of the simple,\nconfused concept of human being is not to convey new information. To\nsee the point of this reply, we must see that the standard way of\nidentifying the real nature of a human being is simply to place it in\nits genus and identify its specific difference, but it is arguable that\ndoing this in the case of a substance gives us no new information, but\nonly places the thing in the right spot in a scheme of classification.\nIt is a little hard to see how “a human being is a\nrational animal” does anything more than identify what we want to\ntalk about. Of course, to say that this concrete\nthing is a rational animal is informative, but does it give us any\ndifferent information than the assertion that this concrete thing is a\nhuman being? On the other hand, the causal definition of an attribute\nreally does add to our information about it, as when we find that the\nnoise-in-the-cloud, i.e. thunder, is a\nnoise-in-the-cloud-produced-by-the-extinction-of-fire. These two\nnotions are really distinct, for the one refers obliquely to fire, and\nthe other does not. \n\nGiles's objection to the view that the definition of the subject is\nthe middle term in the highest sort of demonstration would be\nparticularly difficult for Thomas to meet, since Thomas agreed with\nGiles on the unicity of substantial form. Ockham and the Franciscan\ntradition in general, which rejects this doctrine, might hold that the\nreal definition of human being, say, does refer to real parts that need\nnot be referred to in a confused, simple concept of human being.\nScotus, of course, has an additional resource available, for he can\ndeploy a formal distinction between the individual and its essence here\n(which would not be recognized by Ockham or Thomas), even when the\nindividual has but a single substantial form. \n\nWilliam of Ockham discusses the Posterior Analytics and\ndemonstration in two places, his Summa Logicae III.II, On\nDemonstrative Syllogism, and his Scriptum in Librum\nSententiarum Ordinatio, Prologue, Questions 2 through 6 (before\n1324). In the latter, he develops an account of demonstration to\ndiscuss the question what, if anything, can be demonstrated of God. In\nboth places he lays out his views systematically, rather than in\ncommentarial form. \n\nOckham agreed with Scotus and Aquinas that the definition of the\nsubject is the middle term in a demonstration of the highest sort, but\nhe is no more comfortable with the notion that the subject somehow\nefficiently causes an attribute in itself through its essence than is\nAlbert. Indeed, he insists that nothing of interest follows for a\ndemonstration from the real definition of a subject giving its genus\nand difference. This is because what follows demonstratively follows\non some real structure of really distinct parts within the\nsubject. This means, first of all, that a genus-difference definition\nof a thing, which does not identify really distinct parts in it,\ncannot serve as a middle term in demonstration. Moreover, since God\nhas no real parts, but is perfectly simple, no demonstration\nconcerning God can be constructed at all. But some definitions of a\nsubject do identify real parts within it. One case occurs in\nmathematics, in which the real definition of a subject obliquely\nconveys parts of the subject, for instance, as in the definition of a\ntriangle, which is not said directly to be identical to its parts, the\nlines making it up, say, but is said obliquely to be something\ncomposed from those lines.  This, for Ockham, is the only\npossibility for the highest sort of demonstration (Summa\nLogicae III.II 40). It alone meets Thomas's criterion for such a\ndemonstration, i.e. it shows the attribute to belong actually to the\nsubject necessarily and in every case, Albert's criterion, that the\nattribute be occurrent and not merely a capacity, and Giles's\nrequirement that the attribute be really distinct from the subject, so\nthat it can reasonably be said that the conclusion is not an immediate\nproposition. In another case, one can demonstrate an implicitly\nnegative attribute of something from the fact that it is composed of\nreal parts, arguing, for instance, that “Whatever has separable\nparts is destructible, every material thing has separable parts,\ntherefore every material thing is destructible.” This, however,\nsince it shows an attribute which conveys the parts of the subject\nnegatively, is not a demonstration of the highest sort. \n\nIn another type of demonstration, the middle term may be a\ndefinition of a concrete subject obliquely referring to its parts\nwithout any determination, namely in demonstrations concerning animals\nand human beings, in which the reality contains a plurality of forms.\nThus a particular human being is able to learn, say, in virtue of the\nform which is its rational soul. If, as Thomas held, there is no\nplurality of forms here, but every natural substantial form, including\nbiological forms, is simple, and its rational soul just is the\nform of the body, then no demonstration is possible at all, for the\nability to learn is immediately in a human being through itself, so\nthat to say that a human being is rational is to express a first\nprinciple. If there is a plurality of forms, this sort of demonstration\nnonetheless falls short of the highest sort, for it concerns only the\nconcretum, the concrete instance that has several forms, not\nthe substance considered in itself (simply as possessor of the form).\n(Note that here forms are the parts expressed in the\ndefinition obliquely, so the case differs from mathematical\ndemonstrations.) Moreover, since the concretum receives the attribute,\nthe attribute is either learning itself, which is clearly not\ndemonstrable of every concrete instance of a human being, since some\nhuman beings may fail to realize their capacity to learn, or merely the\nability to learn, which is not an actual occurrent constituting part of\na real fact about the world as it is, but, as Albert insisted, merely a\nkind of possibility of an occurent thing. The notion that a kind of\nefficient causation produces the capacity for learning, which is to be\ntaken as something really present in a human being even when the human\nbeing is not learning, is rejected by Ockham, of course, for he takes\nit that talk about the capacity is only oblique talk about real events,\nusing modal propositions. All natural demonstration concerning\nefficient causes is reduced to this sort of thing by Ockham, and he\nnever allows that, for instance, it can be shown that fire is capable\nof heating, unless it is taken that we are talking about concrete\ninstances of fire, in which case the whole essence of a particular fire\ncan be expressed in the middle term, thus: “Every hot thing is\ncapable of heating, every concrete instance of fire is (essentially) a\nhot thing, therefore every concrete instance of fire is capable of\nheating.” This is as close as Ockham gets to Thomas's notion of\nthe highest sort of demonstration. \n\nFor Ockham, a demonstration arising from natural efficient causes\ntakes the following pattern: “When there is no opaque medium\nbetween the moon and the sun, the moon will be illuminated by the sun,\nwhen the moon is in such a place, there will be no opaque medium\nbetween the moon and the sun; therefore the moon is then\nilluminated.” Here, the attribute “illuminable,” an\nattribute predicated of its subject without further determination, is\nindemonstrable, but the attribute “illuminated when in such a\nplace” is predicated of its subject with a further determination,\nand so can be demonstrated. This form of demonstration agrees closely\nwith the highest form of demonstration in Albert and Giles of Rome, but\nOckham does not regard it as demonstration of the highest sort, since\nits conclusion is hypothetical rather than categorical. \n\nOckham did not allow any demonstration from final causes on the\npattern of Grosseteste's demonstration of a material from a formal\ndefinition of an attribute, because he did not think that final causes\nhave any genuine productive power. When a final cause is identified,\nthe causal power involved is always the efficient causal power of some\nagent with a purpose in mind. This raised a problem with the account of\nthe science of demonstration Ockham inherited from Grosseteste.\nGrosseteste expected the science of demonstration to argue from the\nfunction of demonstration to the material structure required to realize\nthat function. The procedure seems inadmissible to Ockham, since it\ndoes not follow the path of actual (efficient) causation. Thus the\ndemonstrations making up the science of demonstration seem to be\nillegitimate. Ockham responds to this problem by holding on to the\nformal structure that Grosseteste had identified for the science of\ndemonstration, but making demonstration follow the natural (and\nreliably functional) efficient causal path from knowledge of its\npremisses to knowledge of its conclusion. Thus the conclusion that a\ndemonstration has necessary premisses cannot be drawn concerning\ndemonstration defined in terms of its purpose, but only for\ndemonstration defined in such a way that that sort of thing actually\nproduces knowledge. So the definition will be “a syllogism with\nnecessary premisses etc,” which, as it happens, supposits for the\nsame things as “syllogism intended by the artisan, the logician,\nto produce knowledge.” It is as though we were to define an axe\nby describing those aspects of its structure responsible for its\nfunctionality (a handle of a certain shape, a head made of iron with a\nsharp edge, etc.), and then deducing from this structure that it will\nactually serve that function (actually cut wood) under the right\nconditions, and then applying this piece of natural science to the\npractical issue by giving the advice to use an axe so defined in the\nappropriate way when one wants to cut wood. \n\nIt is no doubt clear at this point that a large part of the question\nhow we gain natural knowledge has not yet been treated, for we have not\nyet discussed how it is one acquires knowledge of the first principles\nthat enter into demonstration. Grosseteste allowed two forms of\nknowledge. In first principles per se in the first way (so that the\npredicate is contained in the subject) he suggested that through\nsensory experience of particulars of a natural kind, one's intellect is\naroused, and comes to a vision of the real nature of the thing which is\nexpressed in the real definition of the subject. (Aquinas has a similar\nview concerning the first principles of a demonstration of the highest\nsort. With acquaintance with the real definition of a substantial\nnature, one can simply see, intellectually, what its immediate powers\nare.) Since the predicate is contained in the subject, once we have a\nreal definition of the subject in hand, we simply see that the first\nprinciple is true. Roughly speaking, we will simply see what functions\na natural thing has once we understand what it is formally, though we\nwill not yet see how it manages to execute those functions. \n\nHow it executes those functions is expressed in principles per se in\nthe second way, so that the subject is somehow implicated in the\npredicate. It is in these first principles that natural causes are\nexpressed. Grosseteste supposes that we have a faculty,\naestimatio, parallel to the senses, which enables us to simply\nsee a particular causal connection. This faculty is no more infallible\nthan are the senses, but after a number of such experiences of a causal\nrelation the intellect will be aroused, and will begin to seek actively\nwhether the apparent causal connection is real or not. To do this, it\nwill attempt to produce experiences in which the apparent cause is\npresent, but nothing else that might be a cause is. If the effect is\nproduced in such situations, it will then conclude the first principle,\nwhich will assert the material definition of the attribute to its\nformal definition. For instance, through experience we might note that\nthunder is caused by the extinction of fire, and express this in the\nprinciple that thunder, considered formally (as a noise in a cloud,\nperhaps with a certain function of frightening those in Hades), is in\nfact the same as noise in a cloud produced by the extinction of fire\n(the material realization of this function of frightening by a loud\nnoise). Or we might note that anger (as the desire to harm someone) is\nin fact, in this world, the same thing as the boiling of blood around\nthe heart (the material conditions for its realization). Thus he takes\ncausal principles to describe how a form is realized (made actual)\ngiven certain material resources. To see what material resources in\nfact realize the form, sensory experience, aided by reason, is\nneeded. \n\nAquinas, it is to be noted, holds that we know all the principles of\na demonstration of the highest sort through an intellectual vision of\nthe substantial nature of the subject, for this tells us the real\ndefinition, and so reveals the minor premise, per se in the first way,\nand it also enables us to see, through the intellect, what primary\nattribute arises through emanatio from such a thing. Like\nGrosseteste, Aquinas thinks that the causal capacities of things (their\nfunctions) must be understood to know what they are, but he sees no\nproblem in working out how these forms do what they do within the\nactual world. In the case of the highest form of demonstration, they\nsimply do it. It is as though we were to say that an adding\nmachine adds, without concerning ourselves how it must be designed to\ndo so. Of course, real natural substances are simple, and artificial\nthings like adding machines are not. An adding machine adds because of\nthe way it is put together, but it is absurd to say that heat heats or\na person knows, because of the way it is put together, for it is\nnot put together. There must be something for which simply to\nexist is to exercise its function, or else we have an infinite regress,\nand must explain every functioning as though it were the functioning of\na complex machine, without ever settling on simple parts for the\nmachine which simply function as they do because of what they are. It\nis Aquinas who lies behind Descartes's view that first principles in\nthe sciences are clearly and distinctly perceived by reason. \n\nDuns Scotus seems to have retained Grosseteste's empiricist bent.\nSome causal principles are known per se, for instance, that an opaque\nthing placed between something illuminated and its light source will\nblock the light and leave that thing in the dark. Here, anyone who\nknows the definitions of the terms (in the example, of\n‘opaque’) can work out the principle from there. But, like\nGrosseteste, he also thought some principles can only be discovered\nthrough experience. So he advances the notion that\n“Whatever occurs in many instances by a cause that is not\nfree is the natural effect of that cause.” He seems to assume\nthat a sufficient number of observations will lead to cases in which\nthe cause fails, if it ever does. In any case, this seems to continue\nGrosseteste's empiricist tendencies, for he apparently assumes that a\nsimple substance must be observed to function before one can conclude\nthrough reason that it functions as it does. Aquinas would no doubt\nsay that such observation of the immediate functioning of a simple\nsubstance is necessary in order to acquire a concept of its\nsubstantial nature, and so its real definition. A real definition of a\nsubstance will specify its natural effect, and we do not infer its\nfunctioning from experience, but rather use experience to abstract its\nreal definition. \n\nOckham thought that the causal power of a most specific natural kind\n(infima species) can be known through the observation of a\nsingle instance. So the curative power of an herb, or the ability of\nheat to produce heat in something adjacent to it, can be concluded by\nreason from a single instance. The principle at work here states that\neverything in a given most specific natural kind which acts produces\neffects of the same kind. He thus seems to refer to a version of the\nuniformity of nature. He is perfectly clear that the real definition of\na simple substance, since it does not signify anything outside the\nsubstance, cannot tell us what its effects are. Here we find the roots\nof Early Modern Empiricism."}]
