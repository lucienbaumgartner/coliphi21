Supertasks were studied by the pre-Socratics and continue to be\nobjects of interest to modern philosophers, logicians and physicists.\nThe term “super-task” itself was coined by J.F. Thomson\n(1954).\n\n\nHere we begin with an overview of the analysis of supertasks and their\nmechanics. We then discuss the possibility of supertasks from the\nperspective of general relativity.\n\n\n\n\nStrange things can happen when one carries out an infinite task. \nFor example, consider a hotel with a countably infinite number of\nrooms. One night when the hotel is completely occupied, a traveler\nshows up and asks for a room. “No problem,” the\nreceptionist replies, “there’s plenty of space!” The first\noccupant then moves to the second room, the second to the third room,\nthe third to the fourth room, and so on all the way up. The result is\na hotel that has gone from being completely occupied to having one\nroom free, and the traveler can stay the night after all. This\nsupertask was described in a 1924 lecture by David Hilbert, as\nreported by Gamow (1947). \nOne might take such unusual results as evidence against the\npossibility of supertasks. Alternatively, we might take them to seem\nstrange because our intuitions are based on experience with finite\ntasks, and which break down in the analysis of supertasks. For now,\nlet us simply try to come to grips with some of the unusual mechanical\nproperties that supertasks can have. \nSupertasks often lack a final or initial step. A famous example is the\nfirst of\n Zeno’s Paradoxes,\n the Paradox of the Dichotomy. The runner Achilles begins at the\nstarting line of a track and runs ½ of the distance to the\nfinish line. He then runs half of the remaining distance, or ¼\nof the total. He then runs half the remaining distance again, or\n&frac18; of the total. And he continues in this way ad infinitum,\ngetting ever-closer to the finish line (Figure 1.1.1). But there is no\nfinal step in this task. Fig 1.1.1. The Zeno Dichotomy supertask. \nThere is also a “regressive” version of the Dichotomy\nsupertask that has no initial step. Suppose that Achilles does reach\nthe finish line. Then he would have had to travel the last ½ of\nthe track, and before that ¼ of the track, and before that\n&frac18; of the track, and so on. In this description of the Achilles\nrace, we imagine winding time backwards and viewing Achilles getting\never-closer to the starting line (Figure 1.1.2). But now there is no\ninitial step in the task. Fig 1.1.2. Regressive version of the Zeno Dichotomy supertask. \nZeno, at least as portrayed in Aristotle’s Physics, argued\nthat as a consequence, motion does not exist. Since an infinite number\nof steps cannot be completed, Achilles will never reach the finish\nline (or never have started in the regressive version). However,\nmodern mathematics provides ways of explaining how Achilles can\ncomplete this supertask. As Salmon (1998) has pointed out, much of the\nmystery of Zeno’s walk is dissolved given the modern definition of a\nlimit. This provides a precise sense in which the following sum\nconverges: \nAlthough it has infinitely many terms, this sum is a geometric series\nthat converges to 1 in the standard topology of the real numbers. A\ndiscussion of the philosophy underpinning this fact can be found in\nSalmon (1998), and the mathematics of convergence in any real analysis\ntextbook that deals with infinite series. From this perspective,\nAchilles actually does complete all of the supertask steps in the\nlimit as the number of steps goes to infinity. One might only doubt\nwhether or not the standard topology of the real numbers provides the\nappropriate notion of convergence in this supertask. A discussion of\nthe subtleties of the choice of topology has been given by Mclaughlin\n(1998). \nMax Black (1950) argued that it is nevertheless impossible to complete\nthe Zeno task, since there is no final step in the infinite sequence.\nThe existence of a final step was similarly demanded on a priori terms\nby Gwiazda (2012). But as Thomson (1954) and Earman and Norton (1996)\nhave pointed out, there is a sense in which this objection equivocates\non two different meanings of the word “complete.” On the\none hand “complete” can refer to the execution of a final\naction. This sense of completion does not occur in Zeno’s Dichotomy,\nsince for every step in the task there is another step that happens\nlater. On the other hand, “complete” can refer to carrying\nout every step in the task, which certainly does occur in Zeno’s\nDichotomy. From Black’s argument one can see that the Zeno Dichotomy\ncannot be completed in the first sense. But it can be completed in the\nsecond. The two meanings for the word “complete” happen to\nbe equivalent for finite tasks, where most of our intuitions about\ntasks are developed. But they are not equivalent when it comes to\nsupertasks. \nHermann Weyl (1949, §2.7) suggested that if one admits that the\nZeno race is possible, then one should equally admit that it is\npossible for a machine to carry out an infinite number of tasks in\nfinite time. However, one difference between the Zeno run and a\nmachine is that the Zeno run is continuous, while the tasks carried\nout by a machine are typically discrete. This led Grünbaum (1969)\nto consider the “staccato” version of the Zeno run, in\nwhich Achilles pauses for successively shorter times at each\ninterval. \nSupertasks are often described by sequences that do not converge. J.\nF. Thomson (1954) introduced one such example now known as Thomson’s\nLamp, which he thought illustrated a sense in which supertasks truly\nare paradoxical. \nSuppose we switch off a lamp. After 1 minute we switch it on. After\n½ a minute more we switch it off again, ¼ on, &frac18;\noff, and so on. Summing each of these times gives rise to an infinite\ngeometric series that converges to 2 minutes, after which time the\nentire supertask has been completed. But when 2 minutes is up, is the\nlamp on or off? Fig 1.2.1. Thomson’s lamp. \nIt may seem absurd to claim that it is on: for each moment that the\nlamp was turned on, there is a later moment at which it was turned\noff. But it would seem equally absurd to claim that it is off: for\neach moment that the lamp is turned off, there is a later moment that\nit was turned on. This paradox, according to Thomson, suggests that\nthe supertask associated with the lamp is impossible. \nTo analyze the paradox, Thomson suggested we represent the\n“on” state of the map with the number 1 and the\n“off” state with 0. The supertask then consists in the\nsequence of states, \nThis sequence does not converge to any real number in the standard\nreal topology. However, one might redefine what it means for a\nsequence to converge in response to this. For example, we could define\nconvergence in terms of the arithmetic mean. Given a sequence\n\\(x_n\\), the Cesàro mean is the sequence\n\\(C_1 = x_1\\), \\(C_2 = (x_1 + x_2)/2\\), \\(C_3 = (x_1 + x_2 +\nx_3)/3\\), and so on. These numbers describe the average value\nof the sequence up to a given term. One says that a sequence\n\\(x_n\\) Cesàro converges to a number \\(C\\) if and\nonly if \\(C_n\\) converges (in the ordinary sense) to \\(C\\). It is\nthen well-known that the sequence \\(0, 1, 0, 1, \\ldots\\) Cesàro\nconverges to ½ (see e.g. Bashirov 2014). \nThomson pointed out that this argument is not very helpful without an\ninterpretation of what lamp-state is represented by ½. We want\nto know if the lamp is on or off; saying that its end state is\nassociated with a convergent arithmetic mean of ½ does little\nto answer the question. However, this approach to resolving the\nparadox has still been pursued, for example by Pérez\nLaraudogoita, Bridger and Alper (2002) and by Dolev (2007). \nAre there other consistent ways to describe the final state of\nThomson’s lamp in spite of the missing limit? \nBenacerraf (1962) pointed out a sense in which the answer is yes. The\ndescription of the Thomson lamp only actually specifies what the lamp\nis doing at each finite stage before 2 minutes. It says nothing about\nwhat happens at 2 minutes, especially given the lack of a converging\nlimit. It may still be possible to “complete” the\ndescription of Thomson’s lamp in a way that leads it to be either on\nafter 2 minutes or off after 2 minutes. The price is that the final\nstate will not be reached from the previous states by a convergent\nsequence. But this by itself does not amount to a logical\ninconsistency. \nSuch a completion of Thomson’s description was explicitly constructed\nby Earman and Norton (1996) using the following example of a bouncing\nball. \nSuppose a metal ball bounces on a conductive plate, bouncing a little\nlower each time until it comes to a rest on the plate. Suppose the\nbounces follow the same geometric pattern as before. Namely, the ball\nis in the air for 1 minute after the first bounce, ½ minute\nafter the second bounce, ¼ minute after the third, &frac18;\nminute after the fourth, and so on. Then the entire infinite sequence\nof bounces is a supertask. \nNow suppose that the ball completes a circuit when it strikes the\nmetal plate, thereby switching on a lamp. This is a physical system\nthat implements Thomson’s lamp. In particular, the lamp is switched on\nand off infinitely many times over the course of a finite duration of\n2 minutes. Fig 1.2.2.\nThomson’s lamp implemented by a bouncing ball: contact of\nthe bouncing ball with the plate switches the Thomson lamp on. The\nsupertask ends with the lamp on. \nWhat is the state of this lamp after 2 minutes? The ball will have\ncome to rest on the plate, and so the lamp will be on. There is no\nmystery in this description of Thomson’s lamp. \nAlternatively, we could arrange the ball so as to break the circuit\nwhen it makes contact with the plate. This gives rise to another\nimplementation of Thomson’s lamp, but one that is off after 2 minutes\nwhen the ball comes to its final resting state. Fig 1.2.3.\nAnother implementation of Thomson’s lamp: contact of the bouncing ball\nwith the plate switches the Thomson lamp off. The supertask ends with\nthe lamp off. \nThese examples show that is possible to fill in the details of\nThomson’s lamp in a way that either renders it definitely on after the\nsupertask, or definitely off. For this reason, Earman and Norton\nconclude with Benacerraf that the Thomson lamp is not a matter of\nparadox but of an incomplete description. \nAs with the Zeno Dichotomy, there is a regressive version of the\nThomson lamp supertask. Such a lamp has been studied by Uzquiano\n(2012), although as a set of instructions rather than a set of tasks.\nConsider a lamp that has been switched on at 2 seconds\npast the hour, off at 1 second past, on at ½ a second past, off\nat ¼ a second past, and so on. What is the state\nof the lamp on the hour, just before the supertask has begun? This\nsupertask can be viewed as incomplete in the same way as the original\nThomson lamp. Insofar as the mechanics of bouncing balls and electric\ncircuits described in Earman and Norton’s lamp are time reversal invariant, it follows that the time-reversed system is a possibility as well, which is spontaneously excited to begin bouncing, providing a physical implementation of the regressive Thomson\nlamp. However, whether the reversed Thomson lamp is a physical possibility\ndepends on whether or not the system is time reversible. A difficulty is that its initial state will not determine the subsequent history of an infinity of alternations. \nSometimes supertasks require a physical quantity to be discontinuous\nin time. One example of this, known as Ross’ paradox, was described by\nJohn Littlewood (1953) as an “infinity paradox” and\nexpanded upon by Sheldon Ross (1988) in his well-known textbook on\nprobability. It goes as follows. \nSuppose we have a jar—a very large jar—with the\ncapacity to hold infinitely many balls. We also have a countably\ninfinite pile of balls, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, …. First we drop balls\n1–10 into the jar, then remove ball 1. (This adds a total of nine\nballs to the jar.) Then we drop balls 11–20 in the jar, and remove\nball 2. (This brings the total up to eighteen.) Suppose that we\ncontinue in this way ad infinitum, and that we do so with\never-increasing speed, so that we will have used up our entire\ninfinite pile of balls in finite time (Figure 1.3.1). How many balls\nwill be in the jar when this supertask is over? Fig 1.3.1.\nThe Littlewood-Ross procedure. \nBoth Littlewood (1953) and Ross (1976) responded that the answer is\nzero. Their reasoning went as follows. \nBall 1 was removed at the first stage. Ball 2 was removed at the\nsecond stage. Ball n was removed at the nth stage, and so on ad\ninfinitum. Since each ball has a label n, and since each label n was\nremoved at the nth stage of the supertask, there can be only be zero\nballs left in the jar at the end after every stage has been completed.\nOne can even identify the moment at which each of them was\nremoved. \nSome may be tempted to object that, on the contrary, the number of\nballs in the jar should be infinite when the supertask is complete.\nAfter the first stage there are 9 balls in the jar. After the second\nstage there are 18. After the third stage there are 27. In the limit\nas the number of stages approaches infinity, the total number of balls\nin the jar diverges to infinity. If the final state of the jar is\ndetermined by what the finite-stage states are converging to, then the\nsupertask should conclude with infinitely many balls in the jar. \nIf both of these responses are equally reasonable, then we have a\ncontradiction. There cannot be both zero and infinity balls in a jar.\nIt is in this sense that the Littlewood-Ross example might be a\nparadox. \nAllis and Koetsier (1991) argued that only the first response is\njustified because of a reasonable “principle of\ncontinuity”: that the positions of the balls in space are a\ncontinuous function of time. Without such a principle, the positions\nof the balls outside the jar could be allowed to teleport\ndiscontinuously back into the jar as soon as the supertask is\ncomplete. But with such a principle in place, one can conclude that\nthe jar must be empty at the end of the supertask. This principle has\nbeen challenged by Van Bendegum (1994), with a clarifying rejoinder by\nAllis and Koetsier (1996). \nEarman and Norton (1996) follow Allis and Koetsier (and Littlewood and\nRoss) in demanding that the worldlines of the balls in the jar be\ncontinuous, but point out that there is a different sense of\ndiscontinuity that develops as a consequence. (A\n‘worldline’ is used here to describe the trajectory of a\nparticle through space and time; it is discussed more below in the\nsection on Time in Relativistic Spacetime.)\nNamely, if one views the number of balls in the jar as approximated by\na function \\(N(t)\\) of time, then this “number\nfunction” is discontinuous in the Littlewood-Ross supertask,\nblowing up to an arbitrarily large value over the course of the\nsupertask before dropping discontinuously to 0 once it is over. In\nthis sense, the Littlewood-Ross paradox presents us with a choice, to\neither, \nbut not both. The example thus seems to require a physical quantity to\nbe discontinuous in time: either in the worldlines of the balls, or in\nthe number of balls in the jar. \nA variation of the Littlewood-Ross example has been posed as a puzzle\nfor decision theory by Barrett and Arntzenius (1999, 2002). They\npropose a game involving an infinite number of $1 bills, each numbered\nby a serial number 1, 2, 3, …, and in which a person begins with $0.\nThe person must then choose between the following two options. \nAt each finite stage of the game it appears to be rational to choose\nOption B. For example, at stage n=1 Option B returns $3, while\nOption A returns $1. At stage n=2 Option B returns $7 while\nOption A returns $1. And so on. \nHowever, suppose that one plays this game as a supertask, so that the\nentire infinite number of offers is played in finite time. Then how\nmuch money will the player have? Following exactly the same reasoning\nas in the Littlewood-Ross paradox, we find that the answer is $0. For\neach bill’s serial number, there is a stage at which that bill was\nreturned. So, if we presume the worldlines of the bills must be\ncontinuous, then the infinite game ends with the player winning\nnothing at all. This is a game in which the rational strategy at each\nfinite stage does not provide a winning strategy for the infinite\ngame. \nThere are variations on this example that have a more positive yield\nfor the players. For example, Earman and Norton (1996) propose the\nfollowing pyramid marketing scheme. Suppose that an agent sells two\nshares of a business for $1,000 each to a pair of agents. Each agent\nsplits their share in two and sells it for $2,000 to two more agents,\nthus netting $1,000 while four new agents go into debt for $1,000\neach. Each of the four new agents then do the same, and so on ad\ninfinitum. How does this game end? \nIf the pool of agents is only finitely large, then the last agents\nwill get saddled with the debt while all the previous agents make a\nprofit. But if the pool is infinitely large, and the pyramid marketing\nscheme becomes a supertask, then all of the agents will have profited\nwhen it is completed. At each stage in which a given agent is in debt,\nthere is a later stage in which the agent sells to shares and makes\n$1,000. This is thus a game that starts with equal total amount of\nprofit and debt, but concludes having converted the debt into pure\nprofit. \nThe discussions of supertasks so far suggest that the possibility of\nsupertasks is not so much a matter of logical possibility as it is\n“physical possibility.” But what does “physical\npossibility” mean? One natural interpretation is that it means,\n“possible according to some laws of physics.” Thus, we can\nmake the question of whether supertasks are possible more precise by\nasking, for example, whether supertasks compatible with the laws of\nclassical particle mechanics. \nEarman and Norton’s (1996) bouncing ball provides one indication that\nthe answer is yes. Another particularly simple example was introduced\nby Pérez Laraudogoita (1996, 1998), which goes as follows. \nSuppose an infinite lattice of particles of the same mass are arranged\nso that there is a distance of ½ between the first and the\nsecond, a distance of ¼ between the second and the third, a\ndistance of &frac18; between the third and the fourth, and so on. Now\nimagine that a new particle of the same mass collides with the first\nparticle in the lattice, as in Figure 1.4.1. If it is a perfectly\nelastic collision, then the incoming particle will come to rest and\nthe velocity will be transferred to the struck particle. Suppose it\ntakes ½ of a second for the second collision to occur. Then it\nwill take ¼ of a second for the third to occur, &frac18; of a\nsecond for the fourth, and so on. The entire infinite process will\nthus be completed after 1 second. Fig 1.4.1.\nJon Pérez Laraudogoita’s ‘Beautiful Supertask’\n \nEarman and Norton (1998) observed several curious facts about this\nsystem. First, unlike Thomson’s lamp, this supertask does not require\nunbounded speeds. The total velocity of the system is never any more\nthan the velocity of the original moving particle. Second, this\nsupertask takes place in a bounded region of space. So, there are no\nboundary conditions “at infinity” that can rule out the\nsupertask. Third, although energy is conserved in each local\ncollision, the global energy of this system is not conserved, since\nafter finite time it becomes a lattice of infinitely many particles\nall at rest. Finally, the supertask depends crucially on there being\nan infinite number of particles, and the width of these particles must\nshrink without bound while keeping the mass fixed. This means the mass\ndensity of the particles must grow without bound. The failure of\nglobal energy conservation and other curious features of this system\nhave been studied by Atkinson (2007, 2008), Atkinson and Johnson\n(2009, 2010) and by Peijnenburg and Atkinson (2008) and Atkinson and\nPeijnenburg (2014). \nAnother kind of classical mechanical supertask was described by\nPérez Laraudogoita (1997). Consider again the infinite lattice\nof particles of the same mass, but this time suppose that the first\nparticle is motionless, that the second particle is headed towards the\nfirst with some velocity, and that the velocity of each successive\nparticle doubles (Figure 1.4.2). The first collision sets the first\nparticle in motion. But a later collision then sets it moving faster,\nand a later collision even faster, and so on. Fig 1.4.2.\nA supertask that relies on unbounded speed. \nIt is not hard to arrange this situation so that the first collision\nhappens after ½ of a second, the second collision after\n¼ of a second, the third after &frac18; of a second, and so on\n(Pérez Laraudogoita 1997). So again we have a supertask that is\ncompleted after one second. \nWhat is the result of this supertask? Their answer is that none of the\nparticles remain in space. They cannot be anywhere in space, since for\neach horizontal position that a given particle can occupy there is a\ntime before 1 second that it is pushed out of that position by a\ncollision. The worldline of any one of the particles from this\nsupertask can be illustrated using Figure 1.4.3. This is what Malament\n(2008, 2009) has referred to as a “space evader”\ntrajectory. The time-reversed “space invader” trajectory\nis one in which the vacuum is spontaneously populated with particles\nafter some fixed time. Fig 1.4.3. Worldline of the supertask particle. \nEarman and Norton (1998) gave some variations on this supertask,\nincluding one which occurs in a bounded region in space. Unlike the\nexample of Pérez Laraudogoita (1996), this supertask also\nessentially requires particles to be accelerated to arbitrarily high\nspeeds, and in this sense is essentially non-relativistic. See\nPérez Laraudogoita (1999) for a rejoinder. \nThis supertask is modeled on an example of Benardete (1964), who\nconsidered a space ship that successively doubles its speed until it\nescapes to spatial infinity. Supertasks of this kind were also studied\nby physicists like Lanford (1975, §4), who identified a system of\nparticles colliding elastically that can undergo an infinite number of\ncollisions in finite time. Mather and McGehee (1975) pointed out a\nsimilar example. Earman (1986) discussed the curious behavior of\nLanford’s example as well, pointing out that such supertasks provide\nexamples of classical indeterminism, but can be eliminated by\nrestricting to finitely many particles or by imposing appropriate\nboundary conditions. \nIt is possible to carry some of the above considerations of supertasks\nover from classical to quantum mechanics. The examples of quantum\nmechanical supertasks that have been given so far are somewhat less\nstraightforward than the classical supertasks above. However, they\nalso bear a more interesting possible relationship to physical\nexperiments. Example 1: Norton’s Lattice \nNorton (1999) investigated whether there exists a direct quantum\nmechanical analogue of the kinds of supertasks discussed above. He\nbegan by considering the classical scenario shown in Figure 1.5.1 of\nan infinite lattice of interacting harmonic oscillators. Assuming the\nsprings all have the same tension and solving the equation of motion\nfor this system, Norton found that it can spontaneously excite,\nproducing an infinite succession of oscillations in the lattice in a\nfinite amount of time. Fig 1.5.1. Norton’s infinite harmonic oscillator system. \nUsing this example as a model, Norton produced a similar supertask for\na quantum lattice of harmonic oscillators. Begin with an infinite\nlattice of 2-dimensional quantum systems, each with a ground state\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) and an excited state \\(\\ket{\\chi}\\). Consider the\ncollection of vectors, \nFor simplicity, we restrict attention to the possible states of the\nsystem that are spanned by this set. We posit a Hamiltonian that has\nthe effect of leaving |0〉 invariant; of creating |1〉 and\ndestroying |2〉; of creating |2〉 and destroying |3〉; and\nso on. Norton then solved the differential form of the\nSchrödinger equation for this interaction and argued that it\nadmits solutions in which all of the nodes in the infinite lattice\nstart in their ground state, but all become spontaneously excited in\nfinite time. \nNorton’s quantum supertask requires a non-standard quantum system\nbecause the dynamical evolution he proposes is not unitary, even\nthough it obeys a differential equation in wavefunction space that\ntakes the form of the Schrödinger equation (Norton 1999,\n§5). Nevertheless, Norton’s quantum supertask has fruitfully\nappeared in physical applications, having been found to arise\nnaturally in a framework for perturbative quantum field theory\nproposed by Duncan and Niedermaier (2013, Appendix B). Example 2: Hepp Measurement \nAlthough quantum systems may sometimes be in a pure superposition of\nmeasurable states, we never observe our measurement devices to be in\nsuch states when they interact with quantum systems. On the contrary, our measurement devices always seem to display definite values. Why? Hepp (1972)\nproposed to explain this by modeling the measurement process using a\nquantum supertask. This example was popularized by Bell (1987,\n§6) and proposed as a solution to the measurement problem by Wan\n(1980) and Bub (1988). \nHere is a toy example illustating the idea. Suppose we model an\nidealised measuring device as consisting in an infinite number of\nfermions. We imagine that the fermions do not interact with each\nother, but that a finite number of them will couple to our target\nsystem whenever we make a measurement. Then an observable\ncharacterising the possible outcomes of a given measurement will be a\nproduct corresponding to some finite number n of observables, \nRestricting to a finite number of fermions at a time has the effect of\nsplitting the Hilbert space of states into special subspaces called\nsuperselection sectors, which have the property that when \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\)\nand \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) come from different sectors, any superposition\n\\(a\\ket{\\psi} + b\\ket{\\phi}\\) with \\(|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1\\) will be a mixed state. It turns out in\nparticular that the space describing the state in which all the\nfermions are \\(z\\)-spin-up is in a different superselection sector than\nthe space in which they are all spin down. Although this may be puzzling\nfor the newcomer, it can be found in any textbook that deals with\nsuperselection. And it allows us to construct an interesting supertask\ndescribing the measurement process. The following simplified version\nof it was given by Bell (1987). \nSuppose we wish to measure a single fermion. We model this as a\nwavefunction that zips by the locations of each fermion in our\nmeasurement device, interacting locally with the individual fermions\nin the device as it goes (Figure 1.5.2). The interaction is set up in\nsuch a way that every fermion is passed in finite time, and such that\nafter the process is completed, the measurement device indicates what\nthe original state of the fermion being measured was. In particular,\nsuppose the single fermion begins in a \\(z\\)-spin-up state. Then,\nafter it has zipped by each of the infinite fermions, they will all be\nfound in the \\(z\\)-spin-up state.  If the single fermion begins\nin a \\(z\\)-spin-down state, then the infinite collection of\nfermions would all be \\(z\\)-spin-down. What if the single fermion\nwas in a superposition? Then the infinite collection of fermions would\ncontain some mixture of \\(z\\)-spin up and \\(z\\)-spin down\nstates. Fig 1.5.2. Bell’s implementation of the Hepp measurement supertask. \nHepp found that, because of the superselection structure of this\nsystem, this measurement device admits mixed states that can indicate\nthe original state of the single fermion, even when the latter begins\nin a pure superposition. Suppose we denote the \\(z\\)-spin\nobservable for the nth fermion in the measurement device as, \\(s_n = I\n\\otimes I \\otimes \\cdots (n\\,times) \\cdots \\otimes \\sigma_z \\otimes I\n\\cdots.\\) We now construct a new observable, given by, \nThis observable has the property that \\(\\langle \\psi, S\\phi\\rangle =\n1\\) if \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) both lie in the same\nsuperselection sector as the state in which all the fermions in the\nmeasurement device are \\(z\\)-spin-up. It also has the property\nthat \\(\\langle\\psi,S\\phi\\rangle = -1\\) if they lie in the same\nsuperselection sector as the all-down state.  But more interestingly,\nsuppose the target fermion that we want to measure is in a pure\nsuperposition of \\(z\\)-spin-up and \\(z\\)-spin-down\nstates. Then, after it zips by all the fermions in the measurement\ndevice, that measurement device will be left in a superposition of the\nform \\(a\\ket{\\uparrow} + b\\ket{\\downarrow}\\), where \\(\\ket{\\uparrow}\\)\nis the state in which all the fermions in the device are spin-up and\n\\(\\ket{\\downarrow}\\) is the state in which they are all spin\ndown. Since \\(\\ket{\\uparrow}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\downarrow}\\) are in\ndifferent superselection sectors, it follows that their superposition\nmust be a mixed state. In other words, this model allows the\nmeasurement device to indicate the pure state of the target fermion,\neven when that state is a pure superposition, without the device\nitself being in a pure superposition. \nThe supertask underpinning this model requires an infinite number of\ninteractions. As Hepp and Bell described it, the model was unrealistic\nbecause it required an infinite amount of time. However, a similar\nsystem was shown by Wan (1980) and Bub (1988) to take place in finite\ntime. Their approach appears at first glance to be a promising model\nof measurement. However, Landsman (1991) pointed out that it is\ninadequate on one of two levels: either the dynamics is not\nautomorphic (which is the analogue of unitarity for such systems), or\nthe task is not completed in finite time. Landsman (1995) has argued\nthat neither of these two outcomes is plausible for a realistic local\ndescription of a quantum system. Example 3: Continuous Measurement \nAnother quantum supertask is found in the so-called Quantum Zeno\nEffect. This literature begins with a question: what would happen if\nwe were to continually monitor a quantum system, like an unstable\natom? The predicted effect is that the system would not change, even\nif it is an unstable atom that would otherwise quickly decay. \nMisra and Sudarshan (1977) proposed to make the concept of\n“continual monitoring” precise using a Zeno-like\nsupertask. Imagine that an unstable atom is evolving according to some\nlaw of unitary evolution \\(U_t\\). Suppose we measure whether or\nnot the atom has decayed by following that regressive form of Zeno’s\nDichotomy above. Namely, we measure it at time \\(t\\), but also at time\n\\(t/2\\), and before that at time \\(t/4\\), and at time \\(t/8\\), and so on. Let \\(E\\) be\na projection corresponding to the initial undecayed state of the\nparticle. Finding the atom undecayed at each stage in the supertask\nthen corresponds to the sequence, \nMisra and Sudarshan use this sequence as a model for continuous\nmeasurement, by supposing that the sequence above converges to an\noperator \\(T(t)=E\\), and that it does so for all times \\(t\\) greater than or\nequal to zero. The aim is for this to capture the claim that the atom\nis continually monitored beginning at a fixed time \\(t=0\\). They prove\nfrom this assumption that, for most reasonable quantum systems, if the\ninitial state is undecayed in the sense that \\(\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho E)=1\\), then the\nprobability that the atom will decay in any given time interval \\([0,t]\\)\nis equal to zero. That is, continual monitoring implies that the atom\nwill never decay. \nThese ideas have given rise to a large literature of responses. To\ngive a sampling: Ghirardi et al. (1979) and Pati (1996) have objected\nthat this Zeno-like model of a quantum measurement runs afoul of other\nproperties of quantum theory, such as the time-energy uncertainty\nrelations, which they argue should prevent the measurements in the\nsupertask sequence above from being made with arbitrarily high\nfrequency. Bokulich (2003) has responded that, nevertheless, such a\nsupertask can still be carried out when the measurement commutes with\nthe unitary evolution, such as when \\(E\\) is a projection onto an energy\neigenstate. \nIn Newtonian physics, time passes at the same rate for all observers.\nIf Alice and Bob are both present at Alice’s 20th and 21st birthday\nparties, both people will experience an elapsed time of one year\nbetween the two events. (This is true no matter what Alice or Bob do\nor where Alice and Bob go in between the two events.) Things aren’t so\nsimple in relativistic physics. Elapsed time between events is\nrelative to the path through spacetime a person takes between them. It\nturns out that this fact opens up the possibility of a new type of\nsupertask. Let’s investigate this possibility in a bit more\ndetail. \nA model of general relativity, a  spacetime,  is a pair \\((M,g)\\).\nIt represents a possible universe compatible with the theory. Here, \\(M\\)\nis a manifold of events. It gives the shape of the universe. (Lots of\ntwo-dimensional manifolds are familiar to us: the plane, the sphere,\nthe torus, etc.) Each point on \\(M\\) represents a localized event in space\nand time. A supernova explosion (properly idealized) is an event. A\nfirst kiss (properly idealized) is also an event. So is the moon\nlanding. But July 20, 1969 is not an event. And the moon is not an\nevent.  \nManifolds are great for representing events. But the metric \\(g\\) dictates\nhow these events are related. Is it possible for a person to travel\nfrom this event to that one? If so, how much elapsed time does a\nperson record between them? The metric \\(g\\) tells us. At each event, \\(g\\)\nassigns a double cone structure. The cone structures can change from\nevent to event; we only require that they do so smoothly. Usually, one\nworks with models of general relativity in which one can label the two\nlobes of each double cone as “past” and\n“future” in a way which involves no discontinuities. We\nwill do so in what follows. (See figure 2.1.1.)  Fig 2.1.1. Events in spacetime and the associated double cones. \nIntuitively, the double cone structure at an event demarcates the\nspeed of light. Trajectories through spacetime which thread the inside\nof the future lobes of these “light cones” are possible\nroutes in which travel stays below the speed of light. Such a\ntrajectory is a worldline and, in principle, can be traversed\nby a person. Now, some events cannot be connected by a worldline. But\nif two events  can  be connected by a worldline, there is an\ninfinite number of worldlines which connect them.  \nEach worldline has a “length” as measured by the metric \\(g\\);\nthis length is the elapsed time along the worldline. Take two events\non a manifold \\(M\\) which can be connected by a worldline. The elapsed\ntime between the events might be large along one worldline and small\nalong another. Intuitively, if a worldline is such that it stays close\nto the boundaries of the cone structures (i.e. if the trajectory stays\n“close to the speed of light”), then the elapsed time is\nrelatively small. (See Figure 2.1.2.) In fact, it turns out that if\ntwo events can be connected by a worldline, then for any number \\(t>0\\),\nthere is a worldline connecting the events with an elapsed time less\nthan \\(t\\)!  Fig 2.1.2. Elapsed time is worldline dependent. \nThe fact that, in relativistic physics, elapsed time is relative to\nworldlines suggests a new type of bifurcated supertask. The idea is\nsimple. (A version of the following idea is given in Pitowsky 1990.)\nTwo people, Alice and Bob, meet at an event \\(p\\) (the start of the\nsupertask). Alice then follows a worldline with a finite elapsed time\nwhich ends at a given event \\(q\\) (the end of the supertask). On the other\nhand, Bob goes another way; he follows a worldline with an infinite\nelapsed time. Bob can use this infinite elapsed time to carry out a\ncomputation which need not halt after finitely many steps. Bob might\ncheck all possible counterexamples to Goldbach’s conjecture, for\nexample. (Goldbach’s conjecture is the statement that every even\ninteger n which is greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum\nof two primes. It is presently unknown whether the conjecture is\ntrue. One could settle it by sequentially checking to see if each\ninstantiated statement is true\nfor \\(n=4\\), \\(n=6\\), \\(n=8\\), \\(n=10\\), and so on.) If\nthe computation halts, then Bob sends a signal to Alice at \\(q\\) saying as\nmuch. If the computation fails to halt, no such signal is sent. The\nupshot is that Alice, after a finite amount of elapsed time, knows the\nresult of the potentially infinite computation at \\(q\\).  \nLet’s work a bit more to make the idea precise. We say that a \nhalf-curve  is a worldline which starts at some event and is\nextended as far as possible in the future direction. Next, the \nobservational past  of an event q, OP(q), is\nthe collection of all events x such that there a is a worldline\nwhich starts at x and ends at q. Intuitively, a (slower\nthan light) signal may be sent from an event x to an\nevent q if and only if x is in the\nset OP(q). (See figure 2.2.1.)  Fig 2.2.1. \nThe observational past of an event and a half-curve. A signal can be\nsent to \\(q\\) from every point in \\(OP(q)\\). No signal\ncan be sent to \\(q\\) from any point on the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\). \nWe are now ready to define the class of models of general relativity\nwhich allow for the type of bifurcated supertask mentioned above\n(Hogarth 1992, 1994). \nOne can see how the definition corresponds to the story above. Bob\ntravels along the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\) and records an infinite elapsed\ntime. Moreover, at any event on Bob’s worldline, Bob can send a signal\nto the event \\(q\\) where Alice finds the result of the computation; this\nfollows from the fact that \\(\\gamma\\) is contained in \\(OP(q)\\). Note that\nAlice’s worldline and the starting point \\(p\\) mentioned in the story did\nnot make it to the definition; they simply weren’t needed. The half\ncurve \\(\\gamma\\) must start at some event – this event is our starting\npoint \\(p\\). Since \\(p\\) is in \\(OP(q)\\), there is a worldline from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). Take\nthis to be Alice’s worldline. One can show that this worldline must\nhave a finite elapsed time. \nIs there a spacetime which satisfies the definition? Yes. Let \\(M\\) be the\ntwo-dimensional plane in standard \\(t,x\\) coordinates. Let the metric \\(g\\)\nbe such that the light cones are oriented in the \\(t\\) direction and open\nup as the absolute value of \\(x\\) approaches infinity. The resulting\nspacetime (Anti-de Sitter spacetime) is Malament-Hogarth (see Figure\n2.2.2).  Fig 2.2.2.\nAnti-de Sitter Spacetime is Malament-Hogarth. A signal can\nbe sent to \\(q\\) from every point on the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\). \nIn the previous section, we showed the existence of models of general\nrelativity which seem to allow for a type of bifurcated supertask.\nHere, we ask: Are these models “physically reasonable”?\nEarman and Norton (1993, 1996) and Etesi and Németi (2002) have\narticulated a number of potential physical problems concerning\nMalament-Hogarth spacetimes. First of all, we would like Bob’s\nworldline to be reasonablly traversable. In the Anti-de Sitter model\nabove, the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\) has an infinite total acceleration. Bob\nwould need an infinite amount of fuel to traverse it! (Malament\n1985) \nAnother problem for the Anti-de Sitter spacetime is that a\n“divergent blueshift” phenomenon occurs. Intuitively, the\nfrequency of any signal Bob sends to Alice is amplified more and more\nas he goes along. Eventually, even the slightest thermal noise will be\namplified to such an extent that communication is all but impossible.\nSo, if the counterexample to Goldbach’s conjecture comes late in the\ngame (or not at all), it is not clear that Alice can ever know this.\n \nOne can find Malament-Hogarth spacetimes which can escape both of the\nproblems mentioned above. Let \\(M\\) be a two-dimensional plane in\nstandard \\(t, x\\) coordinates which is then “rolled up” along\nthe \\(t\\) axis. Let the metric \\(g\\) be such that the light cones are oriented\nin the \\(t\\) direction and do not change from point to point. (See Figure\n2.3.1.)  Fig 2.3.1.\nAn acausal Malament-Hogarth spacetime. \nBecause worldliness can wrap around and around the cylinder, \\(OP(q)=M\\)\nfor any event \\(q\\). This allows for great freedom in choosing Bob’s\nworldline \\(\\gamma\\). In fact, we can choose it so that the total\nacceleration is zero – no fuel is needed to traverse it. Moreover, we\ncan choose it so that there is also no divergent blueshift phenomenon\n(see Earman and Norton 1993). But, alas, we have a new problem: the\nspacetime is acausal. A worldline can start and end at the same event\nallowing for a type of “time travel”. It is unclear if\nspacetimes allowing for time travel are physically reasonable (see\nSmeenk and Wüthrich 2011). It turns out that more complicated\nexamples can be constructed which avoid all the potential problems\nmentioned so far and more (Manchak 2010). But such examples contain\nspacetime “holes” which may not be physically reasonable\n(see Manchak 2009). More work is needed to see if such problems can\nalso be overcome.  \nWe conclude with one final potential problem which threatens to render\nall Malament-Hogarth spacetimes physically unreasonable. Penrose\n(1979) has conjectured that all physically reasonable spacetimes are\nfree of a certain type of “naked singularities” and the\nbreakdown of determinism they bring. Whether Penrose’s conjecture is\ntrue or not is the subject of much debate (Earman 1995). But it turns\nout that every Malament-Hogarth spacetime harbors these naked\nsingularities (Hogarth 1992). In sum, it is still an open question\nwhether Malament-Hogarth spacetimes are simply artifact of the\nformalism of general relativity or if the kind of bifurcated supertask\nthey suggest can be implemented in our own universe.

Supertasks were studied by the pre-Socratics and continue to be\nobjects of interest to modern philosophers, logicians and physicists.\nThe term “super-task” itself was coined by J.F. Thomson\n(1954).\n\n\nHere we begin with an overview of the analysis of supertasks and their\nmechanics. We then discuss the possibility of supertasks from the\nperspective of general relativity.\n\n\n\n\nStrange things can happen when one carries out an infinite task. \nFor example, consider a hotel with a countably infinite number of\nrooms. One night when the hotel is completely occupied, a traveler\nshows up and asks for a room. “No problem,” the\nreceptionist replies, “there’s plenty of space!” The first\noccupant then moves to the second room, the second to the third room,\nthe third to the fourth room, and so on all the way up. The result is\na hotel that has gone from being completely occupied to having one\nroom free, and the traveler can stay the night after all. This\nsupertask was described in a 1924 lecture by David Hilbert, as\nreported by Gamow (1947). \nOne might take such unusual results as evidence against the\npossibility of supertasks. Alternatively, we might take them to seem\nstrange because our intuitions are based on experience with finite\ntasks, and which break down in the analysis of supertasks. For now,\nlet us simply try to come to grips with some of the unusual mechanical\nproperties that supertasks can have. \nSupertasks often lack a final or initial step. A famous example is the\nfirst of\n Zeno’s Paradoxes,\n the Paradox of the Dichotomy. The runner Achilles begins at the\nstarting line of a track and runs ½ of the distance to the\nfinish line. He then runs half of the remaining distance, or ¼\nof the total. He then runs half the remaining distance again, or\n&frac18; of the total. And he continues in this way ad infinitum,\ngetting ever-closer to the finish line (Figure 1.1.1). But there is no\nfinal step in this task. Fig 1.1.1. The Zeno Dichotomy supertask. \nThere is also a “regressive” version of the Dichotomy\nsupertask that has no initial step. Suppose that Achilles does reach\nthe finish line. Then he would have had to travel the last ½ of\nthe track, and before that ¼ of the track, and before that\n&frac18; of the track, and so on. In this description of the Achilles\nrace, we imagine winding time backwards and viewing Achilles getting\never-closer to the starting line (Figure 1.1.2). But now there is no\ninitial step in the task. Fig 1.1.2. Regressive version of the Zeno Dichotomy supertask. \nZeno, at least as portrayed in Aristotle’s Physics, argued\nthat as a consequence, motion does not exist. Since an infinite number\nof steps cannot be completed, Achilles will never reach the finish\nline (or never have started in the regressive version). However,\nmodern mathematics provides ways of explaining how Achilles can\ncomplete this supertask. As Salmon (1998) has pointed out, much of the\nmystery of Zeno’s walk is dissolved given the modern definition of a\nlimit. This provides a precise sense in which the following sum\nconverges: \nAlthough it has infinitely many terms, this sum is a geometric series\nthat converges to 1 in the standard topology of the real numbers. A\ndiscussion of the philosophy underpinning this fact can be found in\nSalmon (1998), and the mathematics of convergence in any real analysis\ntextbook that deals with infinite series. From this perspective,\nAchilles actually does complete all of the supertask steps in the\nlimit as the number of steps goes to infinity. One might only doubt\nwhether or not the standard topology of the real numbers provides the\nappropriate notion of convergence in this supertask. A discussion of\nthe subtleties of the choice of topology has been given by Mclaughlin\n(1998). \nMax Black (1950) argued that it is nevertheless impossible to complete\nthe Zeno task, since there is no final step in the infinite sequence.\nThe existence of a final step was similarly demanded on a priori terms\nby Gwiazda (2012). But as Thomson (1954) and Earman and Norton (1996)\nhave pointed out, there is a sense in which this objection equivocates\non two different meanings of the word “complete.” On the\none hand “complete” can refer to the execution of a final\naction. This sense of completion does not occur in Zeno’s Dichotomy,\nsince for every step in the task there is another step that happens\nlater. On the other hand, “complete” can refer to carrying\nout every step in the task, which certainly does occur in Zeno’s\nDichotomy. From Black’s argument one can see that the Zeno Dichotomy\ncannot be completed in the first sense. But it can be completed in the\nsecond. The two meanings for the word “complete” happen to\nbe equivalent for finite tasks, where most of our intuitions about\ntasks are developed. But they are not equivalent when it comes to\nsupertasks. \nHermann Weyl (1949, §2.7) suggested that if one admits that the\nZeno race is possible, then one should equally admit that it is\npossible for a machine to carry out an infinite number of tasks in\nfinite time. However, one difference between the Zeno run and a\nmachine is that the Zeno run is continuous, while the tasks carried\nout by a machine are typically discrete. This led Grünbaum (1969)\nto consider the “staccato” version of the Zeno run, in\nwhich Achilles pauses for successively shorter times at each\ninterval. \nSupertasks are often described by sequences that do not converge. J.\nF. Thomson (1954) introduced one such example now known as Thomson’s\nLamp, which he thought illustrated a sense in which supertasks truly\nare paradoxical. \nSuppose we switch off a lamp. After 1 minute we switch it on. After\n½ a minute more we switch it off again, ¼ on, &frac18;\noff, and so on. Summing each of these times gives rise to an infinite\ngeometric series that converges to 2 minutes, after which time the\nentire supertask has been completed. But when 2 minutes is up, is the\nlamp on or off? Fig 1.2.1. Thomson’s lamp. \nIt may seem absurd to claim that it is on: for each moment that the\nlamp was turned on, there is a later moment at which it was turned\noff. But it would seem equally absurd to claim that it is off: for\neach moment that the lamp is turned off, there is a later moment that\nit was turned on. This paradox, according to Thomson, suggests that\nthe supertask associated with the lamp is impossible. \nTo analyze the paradox, Thomson suggested we represent the\n“on” state of the map with the number 1 and the\n“off” state with 0. The supertask then consists in the\nsequence of states, \nThis sequence does not converge to any real number in the standard\nreal topology. However, one might redefine what it means for a\nsequence to converge in response to this. For example, we could define\nconvergence in terms of the arithmetic mean. Given a sequence\n\\(x_n\\), the Cesàro mean is the sequence\n\\(C_1 = x_1\\), \\(C_2 = (x_1 + x_2)/2\\), \\(C_3 = (x_1 + x_2 +\nx_3)/3\\), and so on. These numbers describe the average value\nof the sequence up to a given term. One says that a sequence\n\\(x_n\\) Cesàro converges to a number \\(C\\) if and\nonly if \\(C_n\\) converges (in the ordinary sense) to \\(C\\). It is\nthen well-known that the sequence \\(0, 1, 0, 1, \\ldots\\) Cesàro\nconverges to ½ (see e.g. Bashirov 2014). \nThomson pointed out that this argument is not very helpful without an\ninterpretation of what lamp-state is represented by ½. We want\nto know if the lamp is on or off; saying that its end state is\nassociated with a convergent arithmetic mean of ½ does little\nto answer the question. However, this approach to resolving the\nparadox has still been pursued, for example by Pérez\nLaraudogoita, Bridger and Alper (2002) and by Dolev (2007). \nAre there other consistent ways to describe the final state of\nThomson’s lamp in spite of the missing limit? \nBenacerraf (1962) pointed out a sense in which the answer is yes. The\ndescription of the Thomson lamp only actually specifies what the lamp\nis doing at each finite stage before 2 minutes. It says nothing about\nwhat happens at 2 minutes, especially given the lack of a converging\nlimit. It may still be possible to “complete” the\ndescription of Thomson’s lamp in a way that leads it to be either on\nafter 2 minutes or off after 2 minutes. The price is that the final\nstate will not be reached from the previous states by a convergent\nsequence. But this by itself does not amount to a logical\ninconsistency. \nSuch a completion of Thomson’s description was explicitly constructed\nby Earman and Norton (1996) using the following example of a bouncing\nball. \nSuppose a metal ball bounces on a conductive plate, bouncing a little\nlower each time until it comes to a rest on the plate. Suppose the\nbounces follow the same geometric pattern as before. Namely, the ball\nis in the air for 1 minute after the first bounce, ½ minute\nafter the second bounce, ¼ minute after the third, &frac18;\nminute after the fourth, and so on. Then the entire infinite sequence\nof bounces is a supertask. \nNow suppose that the ball completes a circuit when it strikes the\nmetal plate, thereby switching on a lamp. This is a physical system\nthat implements Thomson’s lamp. In particular, the lamp is switched on\nand off infinitely many times over the course of a finite duration of\n2 minutes. Fig 1.2.2.\nThomson’s lamp implemented by a bouncing ball: contact of\nthe bouncing ball with the plate switches the Thomson lamp on. The\nsupertask ends with the lamp on. \nWhat is the state of this lamp after 2 minutes? The ball will have\ncome to rest on the plate, and so the lamp will be on. There is no\nmystery in this description of Thomson’s lamp. \nAlternatively, we could arrange the ball so as to break the circuit\nwhen it makes contact with the plate. This gives rise to another\nimplementation of Thomson’s lamp, but one that is off after 2 minutes\nwhen the ball comes to its final resting state. Fig 1.2.3.\nAnother implementation of Thomson’s lamp: contact of the bouncing ball\nwith the plate switches the Thomson lamp off. The supertask ends with\nthe lamp off. \nThese examples show that is possible to fill in the details of\nThomson’s lamp in a way that either renders it definitely on after the\nsupertask, or definitely off. For this reason, Earman and Norton\nconclude with Benacerraf that the Thomson lamp is not a matter of\nparadox but of an incomplete description. \nAs with the Zeno Dichotomy, there is a regressive version of the\nThomson lamp supertask. Such a lamp has been studied by Uzquiano\n(2012), although as a set of instructions rather than a set of tasks.\nConsider a lamp that has been switched on at 2 seconds\npast the hour, off at 1 second past, on at ½ a second past, off\nat ¼ a second past, and so on. What is the state\nof the lamp on the hour, just before the supertask has begun? This\nsupertask can be viewed as incomplete in the same way as the original\nThomson lamp. Insofar as the mechanics of bouncing balls and electric\ncircuits described in Earman and Norton’s lamp are time reversal invariant, it follows that the time-reversed system is a possibility as well, which is spontaneously excited to begin bouncing, providing a physical implementation of the regressive Thomson\nlamp. However, whether the reversed Thomson lamp is a physical possibility\ndepends on whether or not the system is time reversible. A difficulty is that its initial state will not determine the subsequent history of an infinity of alternations. \nSometimes supertasks require a physical quantity to be discontinuous\nin time. One example of this, known as Ross’ paradox, was described by\nJohn Littlewood (1953) as an “infinity paradox” and\nexpanded upon by Sheldon Ross (1988) in his well-known textbook on\nprobability. It goes as follows. \nSuppose we have a jar—a very large jar—with the\ncapacity to hold infinitely many balls. We also have a countably\ninfinite pile of balls, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, …. First we drop balls\n1–10 into the jar, then remove ball 1. (This adds a total of nine\nballs to the jar.) Then we drop balls 11–20 in the jar, and remove\nball 2. (This brings the total up to eighteen.) Suppose that we\ncontinue in this way ad infinitum, and that we do so with\never-increasing speed, so that we will have used up our entire\ninfinite pile of balls in finite time (Figure 1.3.1). How many balls\nwill be in the jar when this supertask is over? Fig 1.3.1.\nThe Littlewood-Ross procedure. \nBoth Littlewood (1953) and Ross (1976) responded that the answer is\nzero. Their reasoning went as follows. \nBall 1 was removed at the first stage. Ball 2 was removed at the\nsecond stage. Ball n was removed at the nth stage, and so on ad\ninfinitum. Since each ball has a label n, and since each label n was\nremoved at the nth stage of the supertask, there can be only be zero\nballs left in the jar at the end after every stage has been completed.\nOne can even identify the moment at which each of them was\nremoved. \nSome may be tempted to object that, on the contrary, the number of\nballs in the jar should be infinite when the supertask is complete.\nAfter the first stage there are 9 balls in the jar. After the second\nstage there are 18. After the third stage there are 27. In the limit\nas the number of stages approaches infinity, the total number of balls\nin the jar diverges to infinity. If the final state of the jar is\ndetermined by what the finite-stage states are converging to, then the\nsupertask should conclude with infinitely many balls in the jar. \nIf both of these responses are equally reasonable, then we have a\ncontradiction. There cannot be both zero and infinity balls in a jar.\nIt is in this sense that the Littlewood-Ross example might be a\nparadox. \nAllis and Koetsier (1991) argued that only the first response is\njustified because of a reasonable “principle of\ncontinuity”: that the positions of the balls in space are a\ncontinuous function of time. Without such a principle, the positions\nof the balls outside the jar could be allowed to teleport\ndiscontinuously back into the jar as soon as the supertask is\ncomplete. But with such a principle in place, one can conclude that\nthe jar must be empty at the end of the supertask. This principle has\nbeen challenged by Van Bendegum (1994), with a clarifying rejoinder by\nAllis and Koetsier (1996). \nEarman and Norton (1996) follow Allis and Koetsier (and Littlewood and\nRoss) in demanding that the worldlines of the balls in the jar be\ncontinuous, but point out that there is a different sense of\ndiscontinuity that develops as a consequence. (A\n‘worldline’ is used here to describe the trajectory of a\nparticle through space and time; it is discussed more below in the\nsection on Time in Relativistic Spacetime.)\nNamely, if one views the number of balls in the jar as approximated by\na function \\(N(t)\\) of time, then this “number\nfunction” is discontinuous in the Littlewood-Ross supertask,\nblowing up to an arbitrarily large value over the course of the\nsupertask before dropping discontinuously to 0 once it is over. In\nthis sense, the Littlewood-Ross paradox presents us with a choice, to\neither, \nbut not both. The example thus seems to require a physical quantity to\nbe discontinuous in time: either in the worldlines of the balls, or in\nthe number of balls in the jar. \nA variation of the Littlewood-Ross example has been posed as a puzzle\nfor decision theory by Barrett and Arntzenius (1999, 2002). They\npropose a game involving an infinite number of $1 bills, each numbered\nby a serial number 1, 2, 3, …, and in which a person begins with $0.\nThe person must then choose between the following two options. \nAt each finite stage of the game it appears to be rational to choose\nOption B. For example, at stage n=1 Option B returns $3, while\nOption A returns $1. At stage n=2 Option B returns $7 while\nOption A returns $1. And so on. \nHowever, suppose that one plays this game as a supertask, so that the\nentire infinite number of offers is played in finite time. Then how\nmuch money will the player have? Following exactly the same reasoning\nas in the Littlewood-Ross paradox, we find that the answer is $0. For\neach bill’s serial number, there is a stage at which that bill was\nreturned. So, if we presume the worldlines of the bills must be\ncontinuous, then the infinite game ends with the player winning\nnothing at all. This is a game in which the rational strategy at each\nfinite stage does not provide a winning strategy for the infinite\ngame. \nThere are variations on this example that have a more positive yield\nfor the players. For example, Earman and Norton (1996) propose the\nfollowing pyramid marketing scheme. Suppose that an agent sells two\nshares of a business for $1,000 each to a pair of agents. Each agent\nsplits their share in two and sells it for $2,000 to two more agents,\nthus netting $1,000 while four new agents go into debt for $1,000\neach. Each of the four new agents then do the same, and so on ad\ninfinitum. How does this game end? \nIf the pool of agents is only finitely large, then the last agents\nwill get saddled with the debt while all the previous agents make a\nprofit. But if the pool is infinitely large, and the pyramid marketing\nscheme becomes a supertask, then all of the agents will have profited\nwhen it is completed. At each stage in which a given agent is in debt,\nthere is a later stage in which the agent sells to shares and makes\n$1,000. This is thus a game that starts with equal total amount of\nprofit and debt, but concludes having converted the debt into pure\nprofit. \nThe discussions of supertasks so far suggest that the possibility of\nsupertasks is not so much a matter of logical possibility as it is\n“physical possibility.” But what does “physical\npossibility” mean? One natural interpretation is that it means,\n“possible according to some laws of physics.” Thus, we can\nmake the question of whether supertasks are possible more precise by\nasking, for example, whether supertasks compatible with the laws of\nclassical particle mechanics. \nEarman and Norton’s (1996) bouncing ball provides one indication that\nthe answer is yes. Another particularly simple example was introduced\nby Pérez Laraudogoita (1996, 1998), which goes as follows. \nSuppose an infinite lattice of particles of the same mass are arranged\nso that there is a distance of ½ between the first and the\nsecond, a distance of ¼ between the second and the third, a\ndistance of &frac18; between the third and the fourth, and so on. Now\nimagine that a new particle of the same mass collides with the first\nparticle in the lattice, as in Figure 1.4.1. If it is a perfectly\nelastic collision, then the incoming particle will come to rest and\nthe velocity will be transferred to the struck particle. Suppose it\ntakes ½ of a second for the second collision to occur. Then it\nwill take ¼ of a second for the third to occur, &frac18; of a\nsecond for the fourth, and so on. The entire infinite process will\nthus be completed after 1 second. Fig 1.4.1.\nJon Pérez Laraudogoita’s ‘Beautiful Supertask’\n \nEarman and Norton (1998) observed several curious facts about this\nsystem. First, unlike Thomson’s lamp, this supertask does not require\nunbounded speeds. The total velocity of the system is never any more\nthan the velocity of the original moving particle. Second, this\nsupertask takes place in a bounded region of space. So, there are no\nboundary conditions “at infinity” that can rule out the\nsupertask. Third, although energy is conserved in each local\ncollision, the global energy of this system is not conserved, since\nafter finite time it becomes a lattice of infinitely many particles\nall at rest. Finally, the supertask depends crucially on there being\nan infinite number of particles, and the width of these particles must\nshrink without bound while keeping the mass fixed. This means the mass\ndensity of the particles must grow without bound. The failure of\nglobal energy conservation and other curious features of this system\nhave been studied by Atkinson (2007, 2008), Atkinson and Johnson\n(2009, 2010) and by Peijnenburg and Atkinson (2008) and Atkinson and\nPeijnenburg (2014). \nAnother kind of classical mechanical supertask was described by\nPérez Laraudogoita (1997). Consider again the infinite lattice\nof particles of the same mass, but this time suppose that the first\nparticle is motionless, that the second particle is headed towards the\nfirst with some velocity, and that the velocity of each successive\nparticle doubles (Figure 1.4.2). The first collision sets the first\nparticle in motion. But a later collision then sets it moving faster,\nand a later collision even faster, and so on. Fig 1.4.2.\nA supertask that relies on unbounded speed. \nIt is not hard to arrange this situation so that the first collision\nhappens after ½ of a second, the second collision after\n¼ of a second, the third after &frac18; of a second, and so on\n(Pérez Laraudogoita 1997). So again we have a supertask that is\ncompleted after one second. \nWhat is the result of this supertask? Their answer is that none of the\nparticles remain in space. They cannot be anywhere in space, since for\neach horizontal position that a given particle can occupy there is a\ntime before 1 second that it is pushed out of that position by a\ncollision. The worldline of any one of the particles from this\nsupertask can be illustrated using Figure 1.4.3. This is what Malament\n(2008, 2009) has referred to as a “space evader”\ntrajectory. The time-reversed “space invader” trajectory\nis one in which the vacuum is spontaneously populated with particles\nafter some fixed time. Fig 1.4.3. Worldline of the supertask particle. \nEarman and Norton (1998) gave some variations on this supertask,\nincluding one which occurs in a bounded region in space. Unlike the\nexample of Pérez Laraudogoita (1996), this supertask also\nessentially requires particles to be accelerated to arbitrarily high\nspeeds, and in this sense is essentially non-relativistic. See\nPérez Laraudogoita (1999) for a rejoinder. \nThis supertask is modeled on an example of Benardete (1964), who\nconsidered a space ship that successively doubles its speed until it\nescapes to spatial infinity. Supertasks of this kind were also studied\nby physicists like Lanford (1975, §4), who identified a system of\nparticles colliding elastically that can undergo an infinite number of\ncollisions in finite time. Mather and McGehee (1975) pointed out a\nsimilar example. Earman (1986) discussed the curious behavior of\nLanford’s example as well, pointing out that such supertasks provide\nexamples of classical indeterminism, but can be eliminated by\nrestricting to finitely many particles or by imposing appropriate\nboundary conditions. \nIt is possible to carry some of the above considerations of supertasks\nover from classical to quantum mechanics. The examples of quantum\nmechanical supertasks that have been given so far are somewhat less\nstraightforward than the classical supertasks above. However, they\nalso bear a more interesting possible relationship to physical\nexperiments. Example 1: Norton’s Lattice \nNorton (1999) investigated whether there exists a direct quantum\nmechanical analogue of the kinds of supertasks discussed above. He\nbegan by considering the classical scenario shown in Figure 1.5.1 of\nan infinite lattice of interacting harmonic oscillators. Assuming the\nsprings all have the same tension and solving the equation of motion\nfor this system, Norton found that it can spontaneously excite,\nproducing an infinite succession of oscillations in the lattice in a\nfinite amount of time. Fig 1.5.1. Norton’s infinite harmonic oscillator system. \nUsing this example as a model, Norton produced a similar supertask for\na quantum lattice of harmonic oscillators. Begin with an infinite\nlattice of 2-dimensional quantum systems, each with a ground state\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) and an excited state \\(\\ket{\\chi}\\). Consider the\ncollection of vectors, \nFor simplicity, we restrict attention to the possible states of the\nsystem that are spanned by this set. We posit a Hamiltonian that has\nthe effect of leaving |0〉 invariant; of creating |1〉 and\ndestroying |2〉; of creating |2〉 and destroying |3〉; and\nso on. Norton then solved the differential form of the\nSchrödinger equation for this interaction and argued that it\nadmits solutions in which all of the nodes in the infinite lattice\nstart in their ground state, but all become spontaneously excited in\nfinite time. \nNorton’s quantum supertask requires a non-standard quantum system\nbecause the dynamical evolution he proposes is not unitary, even\nthough it obeys a differential equation in wavefunction space that\ntakes the form of the Schrödinger equation (Norton 1999,\n§5). Nevertheless, Norton’s quantum supertask has fruitfully\nappeared in physical applications, having been found to arise\nnaturally in a framework for perturbative quantum field theory\nproposed by Duncan and Niedermaier (2013, Appendix B). Example 2: Hepp Measurement \nAlthough quantum systems may sometimes be in a pure superposition of\nmeasurable states, we never observe our measurement devices to be in\nsuch states when they interact with quantum systems. On the contrary, our measurement devices always seem to display definite values. Why? Hepp (1972)\nproposed to explain this by modeling the measurement process using a\nquantum supertask. This example was popularized by Bell (1987,\n§6) and proposed as a solution to the measurement problem by Wan\n(1980) and Bub (1988). \nHere is a toy example illustating the idea. Suppose we model an\nidealised measuring device as consisting in an infinite number of\nfermions. We imagine that the fermions do not interact with each\nother, but that a finite number of them will couple to our target\nsystem whenever we make a measurement. Then an observable\ncharacterising the possible outcomes of a given measurement will be a\nproduct corresponding to some finite number n of observables, \nRestricting to a finite number of fermions at a time has the effect of\nsplitting the Hilbert space of states into special subspaces called\nsuperselection sectors, which have the property that when \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\)\nand \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) come from different sectors, any superposition\n\\(a\\ket{\\psi} + b\\ket{\\phi}\\) with \\(|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1\\) will be a mixed state. It turns out in\nparticular that the space describing the state in which all the\nfermions are \\(z\\)-spin-up is in a different superselection sector than\nthe space in which they are all spin down. Although this may be puzzling\nfor the newcomer, it can be found in any textbook that deals with\nsuperselection. And it allows us to construct an interesting supertask\ndescribing the measurement process. The following simplified version\nof it was given by Bell (1987). \nSuppose we wish to measure a single fermion. We model this as a\nwavefunction that zips by the locations of each fermion in our\nmeasurement device, interacting locally with the individual fermions\nin the device as it goes (Figure 1.5.2). The interaction is set up in\nsuch a way that every fermion is passed in finite time, and such that\nafter the process is completed, the measurement device indicates what\nthe original state of the fermion being measured was. In particular,\nsuppose the single fermion begins in a \\(z\\)-spin-up state. Then,\nafter it has zipped by each of the infinite fermions, they will all be\nfound in the \\(z\\)-spin-up state.  If the single fermion begins\nin a \\(z\\)-spin-down state, then the infinite collection of\nfermions would all be \\(z\\)-spin-down. What if the single fermion\nwas in a superposition? Then the infinite collection of fermions would\ncontain some mixture of \\(z\\)-spin up and \\(z\\)-spin down\nstates. Fig 1.5.2. Bell’s implementation of the Hepp measurement supertask. \nHepp found that, because of the superselection structure of this\nsystem, this measurement device admits mixed states that can indicate\nthe original state of the single fermion, even when the latter begins\nin a pure superposition. Suppose we denote the \\(z\\)-spin\nobservable for the nth fermion in the measurement device as, \\(s_n = I\n\\otimes I \\otimes \\cdots (n\\,times) \\cdots \\otimes \\sigma_z \\otimes I\n\\cdots.\\) We now construct a new observable, given by, \nThis observable has the property that \\(\\langle \\psi, S\\phi\\rangle =\n1\\) if \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) both lie in the same\nsuperselection sector as the state in which all the fermions in the\nmeasurement device are \\(z\\)-spin-up. It also has the property\nthat \\(\\langle\\psi,S\\phi\\rangle = -1\\) if they lie in the same\nsuperselection sector as the all-down state.  But more interestingly,\nsuppose the target fermion that we want to measure is in a pure\nsuperposition of \\(z\\)-spin-up and \\(z\\)-spin-down\nstates. Then, after it zips by all the fermions in the measurement\ndevice, that measurement device will be left in a superposition of the\nform \\(a\\ket{\\uparrow} + b\\ket{\\downarrow}\\), where \\(\\ket{\\uparrow}\\)\nis the state in which all the fermions in the device are spin-up and\n\\(\\ket{\\downarrow}\\) is the state in which they are all spin\ndown. Since \\(\\ket{\\uparrow}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\downarrow}\\) are in\ndifferent superselection sectors, it follows that their superposition\nmust be a mixed state. In other words, this model allows the\nmeasurement device to indicate the pure state of the target fermion,\neven when that state is a pure superposition, without the device\nitself being in a pure superposition. \nThe supertask underpinning this model requires an infinite number of\ninteractions. As Hepp and Bell described it, the model was unrealistic\nbecause it required an infinite amount of time. However, a similar\nsystem was shown by Wan (1980) and Bub (1988) to take place in finite\ntime. Their approach appears at first glance to be a promising model\nof measurement. However, Landsman (1991) pointed out that it is\ninadequate on one of two levels: either the dynamics is not\nautomorphic (which is the analogue of unitarity for such systems), or\nthe task is not completed in finite time. Landsman (1995) has argued\nthat neither of these two outcomes is plausible for a realistic local\ndescription of a quantum system. Example 3: Continuous Measurement \nAnother quantum supertask is found in the so-called Quantum Zeno\nEffect. This literature begins with a question: what would happen if\nwe were to continually monitor a quantum system, like an unstable\natom? The predicted effect is that the system would not change, even\nif it is an unstable atom that would otherwise quickly decay. \nMisra and Sudarshan (1977) proposed to make the concept of\n“continual monitoring” precise using a Zeno-like\nsupertask. Imagine that an unstable atom is evolving according to some\nlaw of unitary evolution \\(U_t\\). Suppose we measure whether or\nnot the atom has decayed by following that regressive form of Zeno’s\nDichotomy above. Namely, we measure it at time \\(t\\), but also at time\n\\(t/2\\), and before that at time \\(t/4\\), and at time \\(t/8\\), and so on. Let \\(E\\) be\na projection corresponding to the initial undecayed state of the\nparticle. Finding the atom undecayed at each stage in the supertask\nthen corresponds to the sequence, \nMisra and Sudarshan use this sequence as a model for continuous\nmeasurement, by supposing that the sequence above converges to an\noperator \\(T(t)=E\\), and that it does so for all times \\(t\\) greater than or\nequal to zero. The aim is for this to capture the claim that the atom\nis continually monitored beginning at a fixed time \\(t=0\\). They prove\nfrom this assumption that, for most reasonable quantum systems, if the\ninitial state is undecayed in the sense that \\(\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho E)=1\\), then the\nprobability that the atom will decay in any given time interval \\([0,t]\\)\nis equal to zero. That is, continual monitoring implies that the atom\nwill never decay. \nThese ideas have given rise to a large literature of responses. To\ngive a sampling: Ghirardi et al. (1979) and Pati (1996) have objected\nthat this Zeno-like model of a quantum measurement runs afoul of other\nproperties of quantum theory, such as the time-energy uncertainty\nrelations, which they argue should prevent the measurements in the\nsupertask sequence above from being made with arbitrarily high\nfrequency. Bokulich (2003) has responded that, nevertheless, such a\nsupertask can still be carried out when the measurement commutes with\nthe unitary evolution, such as when \\(E\\) is a projection onto an energy\neigenstate. \nIn Newtonian physics, time passes at the same rate for all observers.\nIf Alice and Bob are both present at Alice’s 20th and 21st birthday\nparties, both people will experience an elapsed time of one year\nbetween the two events. (This is true no matter what Alice or Bob do\nor where Alice and Bob go in between the two events.) Things aren’t so\nsimple in relativistic physics. Elapsed time between events is\nrelative to the path through spacetime a person takes between them. It\nturns out that this fact opens up the possibility of a new type of\nsupertask. Let’s investigate this possibility in a bit more\ndetail. \nA model of general relativity, a  spacetime,  is a pair \\((M,g)\\).\nIt represents a possible universe compatible with the theory. Here, \\(M\\)\nis a manifold of events. It gives the shape of the universe. (Lots of\ntwo-dimensional manifolds are familiar to us: the plane, the sphere,\nthe torus, etc.) Each point on \\(M\\) represents a localized event in space\nand time. A supernova explosion (properly idealized) is an event. A\nfirst kiss (properly idealized) is also an event. So is the moon\nlanding. But July 20, 1969 is not an event. And the moon is not an\nevent.  \nManifolds are great for representing events. But the metric \\(g\\) dictates\nhow these events are related. Is it possible for a person to travel\nfrom this event to that one? If so, how much elapsed time does a\nperson record between them? The metric \\(g\\) tells us. At each event, \\(g\\)\nassigns a double cone structure. The cone structures can change from\nevent to event; we only require that they do so smoothly. Usually, one\nworks with models of general relativity in which one can label the two\nlobes of each double cone as “past” and\n“future” in a way which involves no discontinuities. We\nwill do so in what follows. (See figure 2.1.1.)  Fig 2.1.1. Events in spacetime and the associated double cones. \nIntuitively, the double cone structure at an event demarcates the\nspeed of light. Trajectories through spacetime which thread the inside\nof the future lobes of these “light cones” are possible\nroutes in which travel stays below the speed of light. Such a\ntrajectory is a worldline and, in principle, can be traversed\nby a person. Now, some events cannot be connected by a worldline. But\nif two events  can  be connected by a worldline, there is an\ninfinite number of worldlines which connect them.  \nEach worldline has a “length” as measured by the metric \\(g\\);\nthis length is the elapsed time along the worldline. Take two events\non a manifold \\(M\\) which can be connected by a worldline. The elapsed\ntime between the events might be large along one worldline and small\nalong another. Intuitively, if a worldline is such that it stays close\nto the boundaries of the cone structures (i.e. if the trajectory stays\n“close to the speed of light”), then the elapsed time is\nrelatively small. (See Figure 2.1.2.) In fact, it turns out that if\ntwo events can be connected by a worldline, then for any number \\(t>0\\),\nthere is a worldline connecting the events with an elapsed time less\nthan \\(t\\)!  Fig 2.1.2. Elapsed time is worldline dependent. \nThe fact that, in relativistic physics, elapsed time is relative to\nworldlines suggests a new type of bifurcated supertask. The idea is\nsimple. (A version of the following idea is given in Pitowsky 1990.)\nTwo people, Alice and Bob, meet at an event \\(p\\) (the start of the\nsupertask). Alice then follows a worldline with a finite elapsed time\nwhich ends at a given event \\(q\\) (the end of the supertask). On the other\nhand, Bob goes another way; he follows a worldline with an infinite\nelapsed time. Bob can use this infinite elapsed time to carry out a\ncomputation which need not halt after finitely many steps. Bob might\ncheck all possible counterexamples to Goldbach’s conjecture, for\nexample. (Goldbach’s conjecture is the statement that every even\ninteger n which is greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum\nof two primes. It is presently unknown whether the conjecture is\ntrue. One could settle it by sequentially checking to see if each\ninstantiated statement is true\nfor \\(n=4\\), \\(n=6\\), \\(n=8\\), \\(n=10\\), and so on.) If\nthe computation halts, then Bob sends a signal to Alice at \\(q\\) saying as\nmuch. If the computation fails to halt, no such signal is sent. The\nupshot is that Alice, after a finite amount of elapsed time, knows the\nresult of the potentially infinite computation at \\(q\\).  \nLet’s work a bit more to make the idea precise. We say that a \nhalf-curve  is a worldline which starts at some event and is\nextended as far as possible in the future direction. Next, the \nobservational past  of an event q, OP(q), is\nthe collection of all events x such that there a is a worldline\nwhich starts at x and ends at q. Intuitively, a (slower\nthan light) signal may be sent from an event x to an\nevent q if and only if x is in the\nset OP(q). (See figure 2.2.1.)  Fig 2.2.1. \nThe observational past of an event and a half-curve. A signal can be\nsent to \\(q\\) from every point in \\(OP(q)\\). No signal\ncan be sent to \\(q\\) from any point on the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\). \nWe are now ready to define the class of models of general relativity\nwhich allow for the type of bifurcated supertask mentioned above\n(Hogarth 1992, 1994). \nOne can see how the definition corresponds to the story above. Bob\ntravels along the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\) and records an infinite elapsed\ntime. Moreover, at any event on Bob’s worldline, Bob can send a signal\nto the event \\(q\\) where Alice finds the result of the computation; this\nfollows from the fact that \\(\\gamma\\) is contained in \\(OP(q)\\). Note that\nAlice’s worldline and the starting point \\(p\\) mentioned in the story did\nnot make it to the definition; they simply weren’t needed. The half\ncurve \\(\\gamma\\) must start at some event – this event is our starting\npoint \\(p\\). Since \\(p\\) is in \\(OP(q)\\), there is a worldline from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). Take\nthis to be Alice’s worldline. One can show that this worldline must\nhave a finite elapsed time. \nIs there a spacetime which satisfies the definition? Yes. Let \\(M\\) be the\ntwo-dimensional plane in standard \\(t,x\\) coordinates. Let the metric \\(g\\)\nbe such that the light cones are oriented in the \\(t\\) direction and open\nup as the absolute value of \\(x\\) approaches infinity. The resulting\nspacetime (Anti-de Sitter spacetime) is Malament-Hogarth (see Figure\n2.2.2).  Fig 2.2.2.\nAnti-de Sitter Spacetime is Malament-Hogarth. A signal can\nbe sent to \\(q\\) from every point on the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\). \nIn the previous section, we showed the existence of models of general\nrelativity which seem to allow for a type of bifurcated supertask.\nHere, we ask: Are these models “physically reasonable”?\nEarman and Norton (1993, 1996) and Etesi and Németi (2002) have\narticulated a number of potential physical problems concerning\nMalament-Hogarth spacetimes. First of all, we would like Bob’s\nworldline to be reasonablly traversable. In the Anti-de Sitter model\nabove, the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\) has an infinite total acceleration. Bob\nwould need an infinite amount of fuel to traverse it! (Malament\n1985) \nAnother problem for the Anti-de Sitter spacetime is that a\n“divergent blueshift” phenomenon occurs. Intuitively, the\nfrequency of any signal Bob sends to Alice is amplified more and more\nas he goes along. Eventually, even the slightest thermal noise will be\namplified to such an extent that communication is all but impossible.\nSo, if the counterexample to Goldbach’s conjecture comes late in the\ngame (or not at all), it is not clear that Alice can ever know this.\n \nOne can find Malament-Hogarth spacetimes which can escape both of the\nproblems mentioned above. Let \\(M\\) be a two-dimensional plane in\nstandard \\(t, x\\) coordinates which is then “rolled up” along\nthe \\(t\\) axis. Let the metric \\(g\\) be such that the light cones are oriented\nin the \\(t\\) direction and do not change from point to point. (See Figure\n2.3.1.)  Fig 2.3.1.\nAn acausal Malament-Hogarth spacetime. \nBecause worldliness can wrap around and around the cylinder, \\(OP(q)=M\\)\nfor any event \\(q\\). This allows for great freedom in choosing Bob’s\nworldline \\(\\gamma\\). In fact, we can choose it so that the total\nacceleration is zero – no fuel is needed to traverse it. Moreover, we\ncan choose it so that there is also no divergent blueshift phenomenon\n(see Earman and Norton 1993). But, alas, we have a new problem: the\nspacetime is acausal. A worldline can start and end at the same event\nallowing for a type of “time travel”. It is unclear if\nspacetimes allowing for time travel are physically reasonable (see\nSmeenk and Wüthrich 2011). It turns out that more complicated\nexamples can be constructed which avoid all the potential problems\nmentioned so far and more (Manchak 2010). But such examples contain\nspacetime “holes” which may not be physically reasonable\n(see Manchak 2009). More work is needed to see if such problems can\nalso be overcome.  \nWe conclude with one final potential problem which threatens to render\nall Malament-Hogarth spacetimes physically unreasonable. Penrose\n(1979) has conjectured that all physically reasonable spacetimes are\nfree of a certain type of “naked singularities” and the\nbreakdown of determinism they bring. Whether Penrose’s conjecture is\ntrue or not is the subject of much debate (Earman 1995). But it turns\nout that every Malament-Hogarth spacetime harbors these naked\nsingularities (Hogarth 1992). In sum, it is still an open question\nwhether Malament-Hogarth spacetimes are simply artifact of the\nformalism of general relativity or if the kind of bifurcated supertask\nthey suggest can be implemented in our own universe.
