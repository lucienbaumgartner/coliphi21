It refers to a family of many-valued logics (see entry\non\n many-valued logic)\n and thus stipulates that the truth value (which, in this case amounts\nto a degree of truth) of a logically compound proposition, like\n“Carles is tall and Chris is rich”, is determined by the\ntruth value of its components. In other words, like in classical\nlogic, one imposes truth-functionality.\n\n\nFuzzy logic emerged in the context of the theory of fuzzy sets,\nintroduced by Zadeh (1965). A fuzzy set assigns a degree of\nmembership, typically a real number from the interval \\([0,1]\\), to\nelements of a universe. Fuzzy logic arises by assigning degrees of\ntruth to propositions. The standard set of truth values (degrees) is\n\\([0,1]\\), where \\(0\\) represents “totally false”, \\(1\\)\nrepresents “totally true”, and the other numbers refer to\npartial truth, i.e., intermediate degrees of\n truth.[1]\n\n\n“Fuzzy logic” is often understood in a very wide sense\nwhich includes all kinds of formalisms and techniques referring to the\nsystematic handling of degrees of some kind (see, e.g.,\nNguyen & Walker 2000). In particular in engineering contexts\n(fuzzy control, fuzzy classification, soft computing) it is aimed at\nefficient computational methods tolerant to suboptimality and\nimprecision (see, e.g., Ross 2010). This entry focuses on fuzzy logic\nin a narrow sense, established as a discipline of mathematical logic\nfollowing the seminal monograph by Petr Hájek (1998) and\nnowadays usually referred to as “mathematical fuzzy logic”\n(see Cintula, Fermüller, Hájek, & Noguera 2011 and\n2015). It focuses on logics based on a truth-functional account of\npartial truth and studies them in the spirit of classical mathematical\nlogic (syntax, model theoretic semantics, proof systems, completeness,\netc.; both, at propositional and the predicate level).\n\nThe standard set of truth degrees for fuzzy logics is the real unit\ninterval \\([0,1]\\) with its natural ordering \\(\\leq\\), ranging from\ntotal falsity (represented by \\(0\\)) to total truth (represented by\n\\(1\\)) through a continuum of intermediate truth degrees. The most\nfundamental assumption of (mainstream) mathematical fuzzy logic is\nthat connectives are to be interpreted truth-functionally over the set\nof truth-degrees. Such truth-functions are assumed to behave\nclassically on the extremal values \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). A very natural\nbehavior of conjunction and disjunction is achieved by imposing \\(x\n\\land y = \\min\\{x,y\\}\\) and \\(x \\lor y = \\max\\{x,y\\}\\) for each \\(x,y\n\\in [0,1]\\). \nAnother, non-idempotent, conjunction \\(\\&\\) is typically added to\naccount for the intuition that applying a partially true hypothesis\ntwice might lead to a different degree of truth than using it only\nonce. Such a conjunction is usually interpreted by a binary operation\non \\([0,1]\\), which is not necessarily idempotent, but still\nassociative, commutative, non-decreasing in both arguments and has\n\\(1\\) as neutral element. These operations are called t-norms\n(triangular norms) and their mathematical properties have\nbeen thoroughly studied (e.g., by Klement, Mesiar, & Pap 2000).\nProminent examples of t-norms are the already mentioned function\n\\(\\min\\), the standard product of real numbers, and the\nŁukasiewicz t-norm: \\(x *_{Ł} y=\\max\\{x+y-1,0\\}\\). These\nthree t-norms are actually continuous functions and any other\ncontinuous t-norm can be described as an ordinal sum of these\nthree basic ones (see, Ling 1965; Mostert & Shields 1957). \nNegation is interpreted by a non-increasing function assigning \\(0\\)\nto \\(1\\) and vice versa; usual choices are the Łukasiewicz\nnegation \\(\\neg_{Ł} x = 1 - x\\) and the Gödel negation:\n\\(\\neg_\\mathrm{G} 0 = 1\\) and \\(\\neg_\\mathrm{G} x = 0\\) for each \\(x\n> 0\\). It is also usual to introduce a constant symbol\n\\(\\overline{0}\\) for total falsity, hence interpreted as \\(0\\).\nFinally, a suitable choice for implication is the residuum of the\nt-norm \\(\\ast\\), that is, the unique function \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nsatisfying the so-called residuation condition: \\(x \\ast y\n\\leq z\\), if and only if, \\(x \\leq y \\Rightarrow z\\). Such a function\nexists (and is defined as \\(x \\Rightarrow y = \\max\\{z \\mid x \\ast z\n\\leq y\\}\\)) if, and only if, the t-norm is left-continuous. \nThe weakest logic with connectives interpreted by truth-functions of\nthe type described above is MTL (Monoidal T-norm based Logic,\nEsteva & Godo 2001). It is a logic with the primitive connectives\n\\(\\mathbin{\\&}, \\to, \\wedge,\\) and \\(\\overline{0}\\), and derivable\nconnectives defined as: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\varphi \\lor \\psi &= ((\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to \\psi) \\land ((\\psi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\varphi),\\\\\n\\neg \\varphi &= \\varphi \\to \\overline{0}, \\\\\n\\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\psi &= (\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\land (\\psi \\to \\varphi), and \\\\\n\\overline{1} &= \\neg \\overline{0}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n MTL is defined as a consequence\nrelation over the semantics given by all left-continuous t-norms.\nNamely, given a particular left-continuous t-norm \\(\\ast\\), an\nevaluation \\(e_\\ast\\) is a mapping from propositional variables to\n\\([0,1]\\), extended to all formulas by interpreting \\(\\&\\) as\n\\(\\ast\\), the implication \\(\\to\\) as its residuum \\(\\Rightarrow\\), and\n\\(\\land\\) and \\(\\overline{0}\\) as \\(\\min\\) and \\(0\\),\nrespectively. \nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is a consequence of a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\)\nin MTL, denoted \\(\\Gamma \\models_\\mathrm{MTL} \\varphi\\), if for each\nleft-continuous t-norm \\(\\ast\\) and each evaluation \\(e_\\ast\\) such\nthat \\(e(\\psi) = 1\\) for each \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\) we have \\(e(\\varphi)\n= 1\\); that is: each evaluation that makes the premises totally true\nmust also make the conclusion totally true. Formulas \\(\\varphi\\) that\nalways evaluate to \\(1\\) (\\(\\models_\\mathrm{MTL}\\varphi\\)) are called\ntautologies of MTL. Note that the formula \\((\\varphi \\mathbin{\\&}\n\\psi) \\to (\\varphi \\land \\psi)\\) is a tautology in MTL, i.e., the\nconjunction \\(\\&\\) is stronger than \\(\\land\\). \nMTL can also be presented by a Hilbert-style proof system with the\nfollowing axioms: \nand modus ponens as the only inference rule: from \\(\\varphi\\)\nand \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\), infer \\(\\psi\\). This system is a complete\naxiomatization of the logic MTL: \\(\\Gamma \\models_\\mathrm{MTL}\n\\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_\\mathrm{MTL} \\varphi\\), where the latter\nrelation denotes derivability from instances of the above axioms and\nformulas in \\(\\Gamma\\). The validity problem of \\(\\mathrm{MTL}\\) is\nknown to be decidable, however its computational complexity has not\nyet been determined. \n\nŁukasiewicz logic can be defined by adding \\[((\\varphi \\to \\psi)\n\\to \\psi) \\to ((\\psi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\varphi)\\] to the Hilbert-style\n\n system for MTL. It corresponds to the finitary version of\nthe consequence relation defined with respect to evaluations based on\nthe Łukasiewicz t-norm (in symbols: for each finite set\nof formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and each formula \\(\\varphi\\), we have \\(\\Gamma\n\\models_{Ł} \\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{Ł}\n \\varphi\\)).[2] \nThis logic was an early example of a many-valued logic, introduced by\nŁukasiewicz & Tarski (1930), well before the inception of the\ntheory of fuzzy sets, by means of an equivalent axiomatic system (with\nmodus ponens as the only inference rule): \nŁukasiewicz logic is the only t-norm based fuzzy logic where all\nconnectives are interpreted by continuous functions, including the\nimplication which, as the residuum of \\(_{Ł}\\), is given by the\nfunction \\(x \\to_{Ł} y=\\min\\{1,1-x+y\\}\\). McNaughton’s\ntheorem (1951) states that real-valued functions over [0,1] that\ninterpret formulas of Łukasiewicz logic are exactly the\ncontinuous piecewise linear functions with integer coefficients. In\nterms of computational complexity, the validity problem for this logic\nis asymptotically not worse than in classical logic: it remains\ncoNP-complete. \nGödel–Dummett logic, also known as Dummett’s LC or\nsimply Gödel logic, is another early example of a many-valued\nlogic with truth values in \\([0,1]\\). It was introduced by Michael\nDummett (1959) as the extension of intuitionistic logic (see entry on\n intuitionistic logic)\n by the axiom \n\n\\[(\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\lor (\\psi \\to \\varphi).\\]\n\n This formula enforces a linear order in the\nunderlying (Kripke-style as well as algebraic) semantics. It also\nappears in the context of Gödel’s observation that it is\nimpossible to characterize intuitionistic logic by finite truth tables\n(Gödel 1932). Gödel–Dummett logic can alternatively be\nobtained as an axiomatic extension of MTL by adding the axiom\n\\(\\varphi \\to \\varphi \\mathbin{\\&} \\varphi\\), which amounts to\nrequiring the idempotence of \\(\\&\\), and hence making the\ninterpretation of both conjunctions coincide. In the fuzzy logic\nsetting the Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as the\nconsequence relation given by the minimum t-norm. It is distinguished\nas the only t-norm based logic where the truth of a formula in a given\nevaluation does not depend on the specific values assigned to the\npropositional variables, but only on the relative order of these\nvalues. In this sense, Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as a\nlogic of comparative truth. Like for Łukasiewicz logic, the\ncomputational complexity of testing validity remains\ncoNP-complete. \nBesides MTL (the logic of all left-continuous t-norms) and\nŁukasiewicz and Gödel–Dummett logics (each induced by\none particular t-norm), one can consider logics induced by\nother sets of t-norms or, in general, arbitrary axiomatic extensions\nof MTL. In particular, the logic of all continuous t-norms\n(Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic) is obtained by adding the\naxiom \n\n\\[(\\varphi\\mathbin{\\&}(\\varphi\\to{{\\psi}})) \\to\n(\\psi\\mathbin{\\&}(\\psi\\to\\varphi))\\]\n\n to those of MTL. Actually, for any set of continuous\nt-norms there is a finite axiomatization of the corresponding logic\n(Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2003; Haniková 2014). In\nparticular the logic of the last prominent continuous t-norm\n(algebraic product), known as Product logic, is the extension of\nHájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic by the axiom: \n\n\\[\\neg\\varphi \\vee ((\\varphi\\to\\varphi\\mathbin{\\&}{{\\psi}})\\to{{\\psi}})\\]\n\n On\nthe other hand, not all axiomatic extensions of MTL can be given a\nsemantics of t-norms. For example, classical logic can be axiomatized\nas MTL \\(+\\) \\(\\varphi\\vee\\neg \\varphi\\), but the axiom of excluded\nmiddle is not a tautology under any t-norm based interpretation. \nThere are also reasons to consider weaker fuzzy logics. For example,\nit can be argued that the assumptions forcing the interpretation of\nthe conjunction to be a t-norm are too strong. In particular, the\nassumption that \\(1\\) is the neutral element of conjunction enforces a\ndefinition of tautology as a formula always evaluated to \\(1\\) and the\nconsequence relation as preservation of the value \\(1\\) – that\nis, \\(1\\) is the only designated value in the\n semantics.[3]\n A natural way to introduce logics with more than one designated truth\ndegree is to assume that the neutral element for \\(\\ast\\) is a number\n\\(t <1\\). (It can be shown that in this situation the designated\ntruth degrees are exactly those greater than or equal to \\(t\\).) Such\ninterpretations of conjunctions are called uninorms. The\nresulting logic was axiomatized by Metcalfe & Montagna (2007). \nAnalogously one may argue against commutativity or even against\nassociativity of conjunction. Axiomatizations of resulting logics are\ndescribed in the literature (see Cintula, Horčík, &\nNoguera 2013; Jenei & Montagna 2003); an exception is the logic of\nnon-commutative uninorms for which a natural axiomatic system is not\nknown. \nFinally, taking into account that fuzzy logics, unlike classical\nlogic, are typically not functionally complete, one can increase their\nexpressive power by adding new connectives. The most commonly\nconsidered connectives are: truth constants \\(\\bar r\\) for each\nrational number \\(r\\in (0,1)\\); unary connectives \\(\\sim\\) and\n\\(\\triangle\\) interpreted as \\({\\sim}x = 1-x\\) and \\(\\triangle x = 1\\)\nif \\(x=1\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise; a binary connective \\(\\odot\\)\ninterpreted as the usual algebraic product, etc. (Baaz 1996; Esteva,\nGispert, Godo, & Noguera 2007; Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2001;\nEsteva, Godo, Hájek, & Navara 2000). \nA thorough overview of all the kinds of propositional fuzzy logics\nmentioned in this section (and a general theory thereof) can be found\nin the Handbook of Mathematical Fuzzy Logic (3 volumes,\nCintula et al. 2011a,b, 2015). \nGiven any propositional fuzzy logic L there is a uniform way to\nintroduce its first-order counterpart L\\(\\forall\\) in a predicate\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{P\\!L}\\) (defined as in the classical case). In\nthis section, for simplicity, we present it for t-norm based\nlogics. \nThe semantics is given by structures in which predicate symbols are\ninterpreted as functions mapping tuples of domain elements into truth\nvalues. More precisely, a structure \\({\\mathbf M}\\) consists of a\nnon-empty domain of elements \\(M\\), a function \\(f_{\\mathbf M}\\colon\nM^n\\to M\\) for each \\(n\\)-ary function symbol \\(f\\in \\mathcal{P\\!L}\\),\nand a function \\(P_{\\mathbf M}\\colon M^n\\to [0,1]\\) for each \\(n\\)-ary\npredicate symbol \\(P\\in \\mathcal{P\\!L}\\). Fixing an evaluation\n\\({\\mathrm v}\\) of object variables in \\(M\\), one defines values of\nterms (\\(\\|f(t_1,\\dots,t_n)\\|_{\\mathrm v} = f_{\\mathbf\nM}(\\|t_1\\|_{\\mathrm v},\\dots,\\|t_n\\|_{\\mathrm v})\\)) and truth values\nof atomic formulas (\\(\\|P(t_1,\\dots,t_n)\\|_{\\mathrm v} = P_{\\mathbf\nM}(\\|t_1\\|_{\\mathrm v},\\dots,\\|t_n\\|_{\\mathrm v})\\)). Truth values of\na universally/existentially quantified formula are computed as\ninfimum/supremum of truth values of instances of the formula where the\nquantified variable runs over all elements of the domain \\(M\\).\nFormally: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\|(\\forall x)\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} & = \\inf\\{\\|\\varphi\\|_{{\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]} \\mid a\\in M\\}\\\\\n  \\|(\\exists x)\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} & = \\sup\\{\\|\\varphi\\|_{{\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]}\\mid a\\in M\\},\\\\\n  \\end{align}\n\\]\n\n where \\({\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]\\) is the evaluation\nsending \\(x\\) to \\(a\\) and keeping values of other variables\nunchanged. The values of other formulas are computed using the truth\nfunctions for the propositional connectives of L. \nThe first-order logic L\\(\\forall\\) is then defined as the consequence\nrelation given by preservation of total truth (value \\(1\\)), as in the\npropositional case. More precisely, we say that a first-order formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a consequence of a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) (in\nsymbols: \\(\\Gamma \\models_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\)) if\n\\(\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} = 1\\) for each evaluation v, whenever\n\\(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\mathrm v} = 1\\) for each evaluation v and each \\(\\psi \\in\n\\Gamma\\). \nL\\(\\forall\\) can be given a Hilbert-style calculus with the following\naxioms: \nThe deduction rules of L\\(\\forall\\) are those of L plus the rule of\ngeneralization: from \\(\\varphi\\) infer \\((\\forall\nx)\\varphi\\). \nFor many notable propositional fuzzy logics (including MTL and\nGödel logic) the above axiomatic system is sound and complete\nwith respect to the semantics (i.e., \\(\\Gamma\n\\models_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\) for each \\(\\Gamma\\) and each\n\\(\\varphi\\); Cintula, Horčík, & Noguera 2014). \nHowever, the first-order Łukasiewicz logic is not recursively\naxiomatizable as shown by Scarpellini (1962; Ragaz (1981) proved that\nthe set of tautologies is actually \\(\\Sigma_2\\)-complete in the sense\nof arithmetical hierarchy). Completeness can be achieved either by\nincluding an infinitary inference rule (Hay 1963) or by generalizing\nthe set of truth-values (see next section). The situation is even more\ncomplicated in the case of Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic,\nwhere the set of first-order tautologies of all structures given by\ncontinuous t-norms is as complex as true arithmetics (Montagna\n2001). \nOne of the main tools in the study of fuzzy logic is that of algebraic\nsemantics (see entry on\n algebraic semantics).\n Roughly speaking, the idea is to replace the real unit interval with\nan arbitrary set and interpret the connectives as operations of\ncorresponding arities on that set. \nAn MTL-algebra (introduced by Esteva & Godo (2001)) is a tuple\n\\({\\mathbf A} = \\langle A, \\&, \\to, \\wedge, \\vee, \\overline{0},\n\\overline{1} \\rangle\\) where \nMTL-algebras are a generalization of the t-norm based semantics\nexplained above and provide a sound and complete semantics for\n MTL.[4] \nMTL-chains are those whose lattice order is total and they are the\nbasic building blocks of the whole class of algebras, in the sense\nthat each MTL-algebra can be decomposed as a subdirect\nproduct of chains. This implies that the logic is also complete\nwith respect to the semantics of MTL-chains, which is then used as the\nfirst step in the proof of its completeness with respect to the t-norm\nbased semantics (Jenei & Montagna 2002). \nAlgebraic semantics is a universal tool that can be used for any\nlogic. In particular, for any arbitrary fuzzy logic studied in the\nliterature (even those not supporting a t-norm based semantics such as\nfinite-valued fuzzy logics or the logic of non-commutative uninorms)\none can find a corresponding class of algebras which can be decomposed\nas subdirect products of chains. This fact has led Běhounek &\nCintula (2006) to propose a definition of fuzzy logics as logics that\nare complete with respect to totally ordered algebraic structures. \nThe use of algebraic semantics for first-order logics usually yields\nlower complexity for testing validity or satisfiability than standard\nsemantics (Montagna & Noguera 2010). \nIt has been a considerable challenge to come up with analytic proof\nsystems for fuzzy logics. These are systems that share important\nfeatures, like the eliminability of cuts and the subformula property,\nwith Gentzen’s sequent calculi for classical and intuitionistic\nlogic (see entry on\n the development of proof theory).\n A major breakthrough has been achieved with the introduction of a\nso-called hypersequent calculus for Gödel–Dummett logic by\nArnon Avron (1991). Hypersequent calculi arise from sequent calculi by\nconsidering finite multisets or sequences of sequents, interpreted as\ndisjunctions of sequents, as main object of inference. In the case of\nGödel–Dummett logic one lifts the rules of Gentzen’s\nintuitionistic sequent calculus by simply adding side-hypersequents to\nthe upper and lower sequents. For example, the sequent rule for\nintroducing disjunction on the right hand side \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Gamma_1 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\hspace{3ex} \\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\psi}{\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\vee \\psi}\\]\n\n where\n\\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\) are finite sequences of formulas, is\nturned into the following hypersequent rule: \n\n\\[\\frac{H \\mid \\Gamma_1 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\hspace{3ex} H' \\mid \\Gamma_2\n\\Rightarrow \\psi}{H \\mid H' \\mid \\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\phi\n\\vee \\psi }\\]\n\n where \\(H\\)\nand \\(H'\\) denote the side-hypersequents, i.e., finite sequences or\nmultisets of sequents. This by itself does not change the\ncorresponding logic (intuitionistic logic, in this case). The crucial\nadditional structural rule is the so-called communication rule:\n\n\\[\\frac{H \\mid \\Gamma_1,\\Pi_1 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_1 \\hspace{3ex} H'\n\\mid \\Gamma_2,\\Pi_2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_2}{H \\mid H' \\mid\n\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_1 \\mid \\Pi_2,\\Pi_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\Delta_2}\\]\n\n Here \\(\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2,\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2\\) are finite lists\nof formulas; \\(\\Delta_1\\) and \\(\\Delta_2\\) are either single formulas\nor remain empty; \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) denote the side-hypersequents, like\nabove. \nTo obtain a hypersequent calculus for the fundamental fuzzy logic MTL\none has to add the communication rule to a sequent system for\ncontraction-free version of intuitionistic logic. Analytic proof\nsystems for other fuzzy logics, in particular Łukasiewicz logic,\ncall for a more radical departure from traditional calculi, where the\nsequent components of hypersequents are interpreted differently than\nintuitionistic or classical sequents. Also so-called labeled proof\nsystems and various tableau calculi have been suggested. A detailed\npresentation of the corresponding state of the art can be found in\nMetcalfe, Olivetti, & Gabbay 2008 and Metcalfe 2011. \nIt is desirable, not only from a philosophical point of view, but also\nto a get a better grip on potential applications of fuzzy logics to\nrelate the meaning of intermediary truth values and corresponding\nlogical connectives to basic models of reasoning with vague and\nimprecise notions. A number of such semantics that seek to justify\nparticular choices of truth functional connectives have been\nintroduced. Just two of them are briefly described here. \nVoting semantics is based on the idea that different agents (voters)\nmay coherently judge the same proposition differently. The proportion\nof agents that accept a proposition \\(\\varphi\\) as true may be seen as\na truth value. Without further restrictions this does not lead to a\ntruth functional semantics, but rather to an assignment of\nprobabilities to propositions. But if one assigns a fixed level of\nskepticism to each agent and imposes some natural conditions that\nkeep the judgments on logically complex statements consistent with\nthose levels, then one can recover \\(\\min\\), \\(\\max\\), and \\(1-x\\) as\ntruth functions for conjunction, disjunction and negation,\nrespectively. Details can be found in Lawry 1998. \nAnother intriguing model of reasoning that provides a justification\nfor all propositional connectives of standard Łukasiewicz logic\nhas been introduced by Giles (1974). It consists in a game, where two\nplayers, I and you, systematically reduce logically complex assertions\n(formulas) to simpler ones according to rules like the following: \nThe rules for quantified statements refer to a fixed domain, assuming\nthat there is a constant symbol for each domain element one\nstipulates: \nThe rules for your assertions are dual. At each state of the game an\noccurrence of a non-atomic formula in either the multiset of current\nassertions by me or by you is chosen and gets replaced by subformulas,\nas indicated by these rules, until only atomic assertions remain. A\nfinal game state is then evaluated according to the following betting\nscheme. \nFor each atomic formula there is a corresponding experiment which may\neither fail or succeed, but may show dispersion, i.e., it may yield\ndifferent results when repeated. A fixed failure probability, called\nrisk value, is assigned to each experiment and thus to each atomic\nformula. The players have to pay \\(\\$\\)1 to the other player for each\nof their atomic assertion where the associated experiments fails. For\nany game starting with my assertion of \\(\\varphi\\) my expected overall\nloss of money if we both play rationally can be shown to correspond\ninversely to the truth value of \\(\\varphi\\) evaluated in an\ninterpretation of Łukasiewicz logic that assigns the inverse of\nthe risk values as truth values to atomic formulas. In particular, a\nformula is valid in Łukasiewicz logic if and only if, for every\nrisk value assignment, I have a strategy that guarantees that my\nexpected overall loss at the end of game is \\(0\\) or negative. \nFermüller & Metcalfe (2009) have pointed out a correspondence\nbetween optimal strategies in Giles’s game and cut-free proofs\nin a hypersequent system for Łukasiewicz logic. The game has also\nbeen extended by Fermüller & Roschger (2014) to characterize\nvarious types of (semi-)fuzzy quantifiers, intended to model natural\nlanguage expressions like “about half” or “almost\nall”. \nParis (2000) provides an overview over other semantics supporting\nvarious choices of truth functions; in particular, re-randomizing\nsemantics (Hisdal 1988), similarity semantics (e.g., Ruspini 1991),\nacceptability semantics (Paris 1997), and approximation semantics\n(Paris 2000). Let us also mention the resource-based semantics of\nBěhounek (2009). Moreover there are different forms of evaluation\ngames for various fuzzy logics, besides the one of Giles for\nŁukasiewicz logic outlined above. An overview over those semantic\ngames can be found in Fermüller 2015. \nModeling reasoning with vague predicates and propositions is often\ncited as the main motivation for introducing fuzzy logics. There are\nmany alternative theories of vagueness (see entry on\n vagueness),\n but there is a general agreement that the susceptibility to the\nsorites paradox (see entry on\n sorites paradox)\n is a main feature of vagueness. Consider the following version of the\nparadox: \nAt the face of it, it seems not be unreasonable to accept these two\nassumptions. By instantiating \\(n\\) with \\(10^{100}\\) in\n (2)\n and applying modus ponens with\n (1)\n as the other premise we conclude that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge. By\nsimply repeating this type of inference we arrive at the unreasonable\nstatement \nFuzzy logic suggests an analysis of the sorites paradox that\nrespects the intuition that statement\n (2),\n while arguably not totally true, is almost true. \nThere are various ways to model this form of reasoning in t-norm based\nfuzzy logics that dissolve the paradox. For example, one may declare\nthat any instance of modus ponens is sound if the degree of\ntruth of the conclusion is not lower than that of the strong\nconjunction of its premises.[5]\n As indicated, one stipulates that every instance of\n (2)\n is true to degree \\(1-\\epsilon\\), for some very small number\n\\(\\epsilon\\). Even if we declare\n (1)\n to be perfectly true, the statement that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge, too,\nmight then be less than perfectly true without sacrificing the\nsoundness of instantiation and modus ponens. If, moreover,\nthe degree of truth of the conjunction of two not perfectly true (or\nnot perfectly false) statements is less than that of each conjunct, we\nmay safely declare that statement\n (3)\n is perfectly false and nevertheless insist on the soundness of each\nstep in the indicated chain of inferences. Informally speaking, the\nparadox disappears by assuming that repeatedly decreasing some\nperfectly huge number by a small amount leads to numbers of which it\nis less and less true that they are huge too. \nAn alternative truth degree based solution to the sorites\nparadox has been proposed by Hájek & Novák\n(2003). They introduce a new truth functional connective modeling the\nexpression “it is almost true that”. In this manner they\nformalize sorites-style reasoning within an axiomatic theory\nof an appropriate t-norm based fuzzy logic. \nSmith (2008; see also 2005) has argued that the so-called\ncloseness principle captures the essence of vagueness.

It refers to a family of many-valued logics (see entry\non\n many-valued logic)\n and thus stipulates that the truth value (which, in this case amounts\nto a degree of truth) of a logically compound proposition, like\n“Carles is tall and Chris is rich”, is determined by the\ntruth value of its components. In other words, like in classical\nlogic, one imposes truth-functionality.\n\n\nFuzzy logic emerged in the context of the theory of fuzzy sets,\nintroduced by Zadeh (1965). A fuzzy set assigns a degree of\nmembership, typically a real number from the interval \\([0,1]\\), to\nelements of a universe. Fuzzy logic arises by assigning degrees of\ntruth to propositions. The standard set of truth values (degrees) is\n\\([0,1]\\), where \\(0\\) represents “totally false”, \\(1\\)\nrepresents “totally true”, and the other numbers refer to\npartial truth, i.e., intermediate degrees of\n truth.[1]\n\n\n“Fuzzy logic” is often understood in a very wide sense\nwhich includes all kinds of formalisms and techniques referring to the\nsystematic handling of degrees of some kind (see, e.g.,\nNguyen & Walker 2000). In particular in engineering contexts\n(fuzzy control, fuzzy classification, soft computing) it is aimed at\nefficient computational methods tolerant to suboptimality and\nimprecision (see, e.g., Ross 2010). This entry focuses on fuzzy logic\nin a narrow sense, established as a discipline of mathematical logic\nfollowing the seminal monograph by Petr Hájek (1998) and\nnowadays usually referred to as “mathematical fuzzy logic”\n(see Cintula, Fermüller, Hájek, & Noguera 2011 and\n2015). It focuses on logics based on a truth-functional account of\npartial truth and studies them in the spirit of classical mathematical\nlogic (syntax, model theoretic semantics, proof systems, completeness,\netc.; both, at propositional and the predicate level).\n\nThe standard set of truth degrees for fuzzy logics is the real unit\ninterval \\([0,1]\\) with its natural ordering \\(\\leq\\), ranging from\ntotal falsity (represented by \\(0\\)) to total truth (represented by\n\\(1\\)) through a continuum of intermediate truth degrees. The most\nfundamental assumption of (mainstream) mathematical fuzzy logic is\nthat connectives are to be interpreted truth-functionally over the set\nof truth-degrees. Such truth-functions are assumed to behave\nclassically on the extremal values \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). A very natural\nbehavior of conjunction and disjunction is achieved by imposing \\(x\n\\land y = \\min\\{x,y\\}\\) and \\(x \\lor y = \\max\\{x,y\\}\\) for each \\(x,y\n\\in [0,1]\\). \nAnother, non-idempotent, conjunction \\(\\&\\) is typically added to\naccount for the intuition that applying a partially true hypothesis\ntwice might lead to a different degree of truth than using it only\nonce. Such a conjunction is usually interpreted by a binary operation\non \\([0,1]\\), which is not necessarily idempotent, but still\nassociative, commutative, non-decreasing in both arguments and has\n\\(1\\) as neutral element. These operations are called t-norms\n(triangular norms) and their mathematical properties have\nbeen thoroughly studied (e.g., by Klement, Mesiar, & Pap 2000).\nProminent examples of t-norms are the already mentioned function\n\\(\\min\\), the standard product of real numbers, and the\nŁukasiewicz t-norm: \\(x *_{Ł} y=\\max\\{x+y-1,0\\}\\). These\nthree t-norms are actually continuous functions and any other\ncontinuous t-norm can be described as an ordinal sum of these\nthree basic ones (see, Ling 1965; Mostert & Shields 1957). \nNegation is interpreted by a non-increasing function assigning \\(0\\)\nto \\(1\\) and vice versa; usual choices are the Łukasiewicz\nnegation \\(\\neg_{Ł} x = 1 - x\\) and the Gödel negation:\n\\(\\neg_\\mathrm{G} 0 = 1\\) and \\(\\neg_\\mathrm{G} x = 0\\) for each \\(x\n> 0\\). It is also usual to introduce a constant symbol\n\\(\\overline{0}\\) for total falsity, hence interpreted as \\(0\\).\nFinally, a suitable choice for implication is the residuum of the\nt-norm \\(\\ast\\), that is, the unique function \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nsatisfying the so-called residuation condition: \\(x \\ast y\n\\leq z\\), if and only if, \\(x \\leq y \\Rightarrow z\\). Such a function\nexists (and is defined as \\(x \\Rightarrow y = \\max\\{z \\mid x \\ast z\n\\leq y\\}\\)) if, and only if, the t-norm is left-continuous. \nThe weakest logic with connectives interpreted by truth-functions of\nthe type described above is MTL (Monoidal T-norm based Logic,\nEsteva & Godo 2001). It is a logic with the primitive connectives\n\\(\\mathbin{\\&}, \\to, \\wedge,\\) and \\(\\overline{0}\\), and derivable\nconnectives defined as: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\varphi \\lor \\psi &= ((\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to \\psi) \\land ((\\psi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\varphi),\\\\\n\\neg \\varphi &= \\varphi \\to \\overline{0}, \\\\\n\\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\psi &= (\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\land (\\psi \\to \\varphi), and \\\\\n\\overline{1} &= \\neg \\overline{0}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n MTL is defined as a consequence\nrelation over the semantics given by all left-continuous t-norms.\nNamely, given a particular left-continuous t-norm \\(\\ast\\), an\nevaluation \\(e_\\ast\\) is a mapping from propositional variables to\n\\([0,1]\\), extended to all formulas by interpreting \\(\\&\\) as\n\\(\\ast\\), the implication \\(\\to\\) as its residuum \\(\\Rightarrow\\), and\n\\(\\land\\) and \\(\\overline{0}\\) as \\(\\min\\) and \\(0\\),\nrespectively. \nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is a consequence of a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\)\nin MTL, denoted \\(\\Gamma \\models_\\mathrm{MTL} \\varphi\\), if for each\nleft-continuous t-norm \\(\\ast\\) and each evaluation \\(e_\\ast\\) such\nthat \\(e(\\psi) = 1\\) for each \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\) we have \\(e(\\varphi)\n= 1\\); that is: each evaluation that makes the premises totally true\nmust also make the conclusion totally true. Formulas \\(\\varphi\\) that\nalways evaluate to \\(1\\) (\\(\\models_\\mathrm{MTL}\\varphi\\)) are called\ntautologies of MTL. Note that the formula \\((\\varphi \\mathbin{\\&}\n\\psi) \\to (\\varphi \\land \\psi)\\) is a tautology in MTL, i.e., the\nconjunction \\(\\&\\) is stronger than \\(\\land\\). \nMTL can also be presented by a Hilbert-style proof system with the\nfollowing axioms: \nand modus ponens as the only inference rule: from \\(\\varphi\\)\nand \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\), infer \\(\\psi\\). This system is a complete\naxiomatization of the logic MTL: \\(\\Gamma \\models_\\mathrm{MTL}\n\\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_\\mathrm{MTL} \\varphi\\), where the latter\nrelation denotes derivability from instances of the above axioms and\nformulas in \\(\\Gamma\\). The validity problem of \\(\\mathrm{MTL}\\) is\nknown to be decidable, however its computational complexity has not\nyet been determined. \n\nŁukasiewicz logic can be defined by adding \\[((\\varphi \\to \\psi)\n\\to \\psi) \\to ((\\psi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\varphi)\\] to the Hilbert-style\n\n system for MTL. It corresponds to the finitary version of\nthe consequence relation defined with respect to evaluations based on\nthe Łukasiewicz t-norm (in symbols: for each finite set\nof formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and each formula \\(\\varphi\\), we have \\(\\Gamma\n\\models_{Ł} \\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{Ł}\n \\varphi\\)).[2] \nThis logic was an early example of a many-valued logic, introduced by\nŁukasiewicz & Tarski (1930), well before the inception of the\ntheory of fuzzy sets, by means of an equivalent axiomatic system (with\nmodus ponens as the only inference rule): \nŁukasiewicz logic is the only t-norm based fuzzy logic where all\nconnectives are interpreted by continuous functions, including the\nimplication which, as the residuum of \\(_{Ł}\\), is given by the\nfunction \\(x \\to_{Ł} y=\\min\\{1,1-x+y\\}\\). McNaughton’s\ntheorem (1951) states that real-valued functions over [0,1] that\ninterpret formulas of Łukasiewicz logic are exactly the\ncontinuous piecewise linear functions with integer coefficients. In\nterms of computational complexity, the validity problem for this logic\nis asymptotically not worse than in classical logic: it remains\ncoNP-complete. \nGödel–Dummett logic, also known as Dummett’s LC or\nsimply Gödel logic, is another early example of a many-valued\nlogic with truth values in \\([0,1]\\). It was introduced by Michael\nDummett (1959) as the extension of intuitionistic logic (see entry on\n intuitionistic logic)\n by the axiom \n\n\\[(\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\lor (\\psi \\to \\varphi).\\]\n\n This formula enforces a linear order in the\nunderlying (Kripke-style as well as algebraic) semantics. It also\nappears in the context of Gödel’s observation that it is\nimpossible to characterize intuitionistic logic by finite truth tables\n(Gödel 1932). Gödel–Dummett logic can alternatively be\nobtained as an axiomatic extension of MTL by adding the axiom\n\\(\\varphi \\to \\varphi \\mathbin{\\&} \\varphi\\), which amounts to\nrequiring the idempotence of \\(\\&\\), and hence making the\ninterpretation of both conjunctions coincide. In the fuzzy logic\nsetting the Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as the\nconsequence relation given by the minimum t-norm. It is distinguished\nas the only t-norm based logic where the truth of a formula in a given\nevaluation does not depend on the specific values assigned to the\npropositional variables, but only on the relative order of these\nvalues. In this sense, Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as a\nlogic of comparative truth. Like for Łukasiewicz logic, the\ncomputational complexity of testing validity remains\ncoNP-complete. \nBesides MTL (the logic of all left-continuous t-norms) and\nŁukasiewicz and Gödel–Dummett logics (each induced by\none particular t-norm), one can consider logics induced by\nother sets of t-norms or, in general, arbitrary axiomatic extensions\nof MTL. In particular, the logic of all continuous t-norms\n(Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic) is obtained by adding the\naxiom \n\n\\[(\\varphi\\mathbin{\\&}(\\varphi\\to{{\\psi}})) \\to\n(\\psi\\mathbin{\\&}(\\psi\\to\\varphi))\\]\n\n to those of MTL. Actually, for any set of continuous\nt-norms there is a finite axiomatization of the corresponding logic\n(Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2003; Haniková 2014). In\nparticular the logic of the last prominent continuous t-norm\n(algebraic product), known as Product logic, is the extension of\nHájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic by the axiom: \n\n\\[\\neg\\varphi \\vee ((\\varphi\\to\\varphi\\mathbin{\\&}{{\\psi}})\\to{{\\psi}})\\]\n\n On\nthe other hand, not all axiomatic extensions of MTL can be given a\nsemantics of t-norms. For example, classical logic can be axiomatized\nas MTL \\(+\\) \\(\\varphi\\vee\\neg \\varphi\\), but the axiom of excluded\nmiddle is not a tautology under any t-norm based interpretation. \nThere are also reasons to consider weaker fuzzy logics. For example,\nit can be argued that the assumptions forcing the interpretation of\nthe conjunction to be a t-norm are too strong. In particular, the\nassumption that \\(1\\) is the neutral element of conjunction enforces a\ndefinition of tautology as a formula always evaluated to \\(1\\) and the\nconsequence relation as preservation of the value \\(1\\) – that\nis, \\(1\\) is the only designated value in the\n semantics.[3]\n A natural way to introduce logics with more than one designated truth\ndegree is to assume that the neutral element for \\(\\ast\\) is a number\n\\(t <1\\). (It can be shown that in this situation the designated\ntruth degrees are exactly those greater than or equal to \\(t\\).) Such\ninterpretations of conjunctions are called uninorms. The\nresulting logic was axiomatized by Metcalfe & Montagna (2007). \nAnalogously one may argue against commutativity or even against\nassociativity of conjunction. Axiomatizations of resulting logics are\ndescribed in the literature (see Cintula, Horčík, &\nNoguera 2013; Jenei & Montagna 2003); an exception is the logic of\nnon-commutative uninorms for which a natural axiomatic system is not\nknown. \nFinally, taking into account that fuzzy logics, unlike classical\nlogic, are typically not functionally complete, one can increase their\nexpressive power by adding new connectives. The most commonly\nconsidered connectives are: truth constants \\(\\bar r\\) for each\nrational number \\(r\\in (0,1)\\); unary connectives \\(\\sim\\) and\n\\(\\triangle\\) interpreted as \\({\\sim}x = 1-x\\) and \\(\\triangle x = 1\\)\nif \\(x=1\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise; a binary connective \\(\\odot\\)\ninterpreted as the usual algebraic product, etc. (Baaz 1996; Esteva,\nGispert, Godo, & Noguera 2007; Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2001;\nEsteva, Godo, Hájek, & Navara 2000). \nA thorough overview of all the kinds of propositional fuzzy logics\nmentioned in this section (and a general theory thereof) can be found\nin the Handbook of Mathematical Fuzzy Logic (3 volumes,\nCintula et al. 2011a,b, 2015). \nGiven any propositional fuzzy logic L there is a uniform way to\nintroduce its first-order counterpart L\\(\\forall\\) in a predicate\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{P\\!L}\\) (defined as in the classical case). In\nthis section, for simplicity, we present it for t-norm based\nlogics. \nThe semantics is given by structures in which predicate symbols are\ninterpreted as functions mapping tuples of domain elements into truth\nvalues. More precisely, a structure \\({\\mathbf M}\\) consists of a\nnon-empty domain of elements \\(M\\), a function \\(f_{\\mathbf M}\\colon\nM^n\\to M\\) for each \\(n\\)-ary function symbol \\(f\\in \\mathcal{P\\!L}\\),\nand a function \\(P_{\\mathbf M}\\colon M^n\\to [0,1]\\) for each \\(n\\)-ary\npredicate symbol \\(P\\in \\mathcal{P\\!L}\\). Fixing an evaluation\n\\({\\mathrm v}\\) of object variables in \\(M\\), one defines values of\nterms (\\(\\|f(t_1,\\dots,t_n)\\|_{\\mathrm v} = f_{\\mathbf\nM}(\\|t_1\\|_{\\mathrm v},\\dots,\\|t_n\\|_{\\mathrm v})\\)) and truth values\nof atomic formulas (\\(\\|P(t_1,\\dots,t_n)\\|_{\\mathrm v} = P_{\\mathbf\nM}(\\|t_1\\|_{\\mathrm v},\\dots,\\|t_n\\|_{\\mathrm v})\\)). Truth values of\na universally/existentially quantified formula are computed as\ninfimum/supremum of truth values of instances of the formula where the\nquantified variable runs over all elements of the domain \\(M\\).\nFormally: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\|(\\forall x)\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} & = \\inf\\{\\|\\varphi\\|_{{\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]} \\mid a\\in M\\}\\\\\n  \\|(\\exists x)\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} & = \\sup\\{\\|\\varphi\\|_{{\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]}\\mid a\\in M\\},\\\\\n  \\end{align}\n\\]\n\n where \\({\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]\\) is the evaluation\nsending \\(x\\) to \\(a\\) and keeping values of other variables\nunchanged. The values of other formulas are computed using the truth\nfunctions for the propositional connectives of L. \nThe first-order logic L\\(\\forall\\) is then defined as the consequence\nrelation given by preservation of total truth (value \\(1\\)), as in the\npropositional case. More precisely, we say that a first-order formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a consequence of a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) (in\nsymbols: \\(\\Gamma \\models_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\)) if\n\\(\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} = 1\\) for each evaluation v, whenever\n\\(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\mathrm v} = 1\\) for each evaluation v and each \\(\\psi \\in\n\\Gamma\\). \nL\\(\\forall\\) can be given a Hilbert-style calculus with the following\naxioms: \nThe deduction rules of L\\(\\forall\\) are those of L plus the rule of\ngeneralization: from \\(\\varphi\\) infer \\((\\forall\nx)\\varphi\\). \nFor many notable propositional fuzzy logics (including MTL and\nGödel logic) the above axiomatic system is sound and complete\nwith respect to the semantics (i.e., \\(\\Gamma\n\\models_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\) for each \\(\\Gamma\\) and each\n\\(\\varphi\\); Cintula, Horčík, & Noguera 2014). \nHowever, the first-order Łukasiewicz logic is not recursively\naxiomatizable as shown by Scarpellini (1962; Ragaz (1981) proved that\nthe set of tautologies is actually \\(\\Sigma_2\\)-complete in the sense\nof arithmetical hierarchy). Completeness can be achieved either by\nincluding an infinitary inference rule (Hay 1963) or by generalizing\nthe set of truth-values (see next section). The situation is even more\ncomplicated in the case of Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic,\nwhere the set of first-order tautologies of all structures given by\ncontinuous t-norms is as complex as true arithmetics (Montagna\n2001). \nOne of the main tools in the study of fuzzy logic is that of algebraic\nsemantics (see entry on\n algebraic semantics).\n Roughly speaking, the idea is to replace the real unit interval with\nan arbitrary set and interpret the connectives as operations of\ncorresponding arities on that set. \nAn MTL-algebra (introduced by Esteva & Godo (2001)) is a tuple\n\\({\\mathbf A} = \\langle A, \\&, \\to, \\wedge, \\vee, \\overline{0},\n\\overline{1} \\rangle\\) where \nMTL-algebras are a generalization of the t-norm based semantics\nexplained above and provide a sound and complete semantics for\n MTL.[4] \nMTL-chains are those whose lattice order is total and they are the\nbasic building blocks of the whole class of algebras, in the sense\nthat each MTL-algebra can be decomposed as a subdirect\nproduct of chains. This implies that the logic is also complete\nwith respect to the semantics of MTL-chains, which is then used as the\nfirst step in the proof of its completeness with respect to the t-norm\nbased semantics (Jenei & Montagna 2002). \nAlgebraic semantics is a universal tool that can be used for any\nlogic. In particular, for any arbitrary fuzzy logic studied in the\nliterature (even those not supporting a t-norm based semantics such as\nfinite-valued fuzzy logics or the logic of non-commutative uninorms)\none can find a corresponding class of algebras which can be decomposed\nas subdirect products of chains. This fact has led Běhounek &\nCintula (2006) to propose a definition of fuzzy logics as logics that\nare complete with respect to totally ordered algebraic structures. \nThe use of algebraic semantics for first-order logics usually yields\nlower complexity for testing validity or satisfiability than standard\nsemantics (Montagna & Noguera 2010). \nIt has been a considerable challenge to come up with analytic proof\nsystems for fuzzy logics. These are systems that share important\nfeatures, like the eliminability of cuts and the subformula property,\nwith Gentzen’s sequent calculi for classical and intuitionistic\nlogic (see entry on\n the development of proof theory).\n A major breakthrough has been achieved with the introduction of a\nso-called hypersequent calculus for Gödel–Dummett logic by\nArnon Avron (1991). Hypersequent calculi arise from sequent calculi by\nconsidering finite multisets or sequences of sequents, interpreted as\ndisjunctions of sequents, as main object of inference. In the case of\nGödel–Dummett logic one lifts the rules of Gentzen’s\nintuitionistic sequent calculus by simply adding side-hypersequents to\nthe upper and lower sequents. For example, the sequent rule for\nintroducing disjunction on the right hand side \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Gamma_1 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\hspace{3ex} \\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\psi}{\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\vee \\psi}\\]\n\n where\n\\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\) are finite sequences of formulas, is\nturned into the following hypersequent rule: \n\n\\[\\frac{H \\mid \\Gamma_1 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\hspace{3ex} H' \\mid \\Gamma_2\n\\Rightarrow \\psi}{H \\mid H' \\mid \\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\phi\n\\vee \\psi }\\]\n\n where \\(H\\)\nand \\(H'\\) denote the side-hypersequents, i.e., finite sequences or\nmultisets of sequents. This by itself does not change the\ncorresponding logic (intuitionistic logic, in this case). The crucial\nadditional structural rule is the so-called communication rule:\n\n\\[\\frac{H \\mid \\Gamma_1,\\Pi_1 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_1 \\hspace{3ex} H'\n\\mid \\Gamma_2,\\Pi_2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_2}{H \\mid H' \\mid\n\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_1 \\mid \\Pi_2,\\Pi_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\Delta_2}\\]\n\n Here \\(\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2,\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2\\) are finite lists\nof formulas; \\(\\Delta_1\\) and \\(\\Delta_2\\) are either single formulas\nor remain empty; \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) denote the side-hypersequents, like\nabove. \nTo obtain a hypersequent calculus for the fundamental fuzzy logic MTL\none has to add the communication rule to a sequent system for\ncontraction-free version of intuitionistic logic. Analytic proof\nsystems for other fuzzy logics, in particular Łukasiewicz logic,\ncall for a more radical departure from traditional calculi, where the\nsequent components of hypersequents are interpreted differently than\nintuitionistic or classical sequents. Also so-called labeled proof\nsystems and various tableau calculi have been suggested. A detailed\npresentation of the corresponding state of the art can be found in\nMetcalfe, Olivetti, & Gabbay 2008 and Metcalfe 2011. \nIt is desirable, not only from a philosophical point of view, but also\nto a get a better grip on potential applications of fuzzy logics to\nrelate the meaning of intermediary truth values and corresponding\nlogical connectives to basic models of reasoning with vague and\nimprecise notions. A number of such semantics that seek to justify\nparticular choices of truth functional connectives have been\nintroduced. Just two of them are briefly described here. \nVoting semantics is based on the idea that different agents (voters)\nmay coherently judge the same proposition differently. The proportion\nof agents that accept a proposition \\(\\varphi\\) as true may be seen as\na truth value. Without further restrictions this does not lead to a\ntruth functional semantics, but rather to an assignment of\nprobabilities to propositions. But if one assigns a fixed level of\nskepticism to each agent and imposes some natural conditions that\nkeep the judgments on logically complex statements consistent with\nthose levels, then one can recover \\(\\min\\), \\(\\max\\), and \\(1-x\\) as\ntruth functions for conjunction, disjunction and negation,\nrespectively. Details can be found in Lawry 1998. \nAnother intriguing model of reasoning that provides a justification\nfor all propositional connectives of standard Łukasiewicz logic\nhas been introduced by Giles (1974). It consists in a game, where two\nplayers, I and you, systematically reduce logically complex assertions\n(formulas) to simpler ones according to rules like the following: \nThe rules for quantified statements refer to a fixed domain, assuming\nthat there is a constant symbol for each domain element one\nstipulates: \nThe rules for your assertions are dual. At each state of the game an\noccurrence of a non-atomic formula in either the multiset of current\nassertions by me or by you is chosen and gets replaced by subformulas,\nas indicated by these rules, until only atomic assertions remain. A\nfinal game state is then evaluated according to the following betting\nscheme. \nFor each atomic formula there is a corresponding experiment which may\neither fail or succeed, but may show dispersion, i.e., it may yield\ndifferent results when repeated. A fixed failure probability, called\nrisk value, is assigned to each experiment and thus to each atomic\nformula. The players have to pay \\(\\$\\)1 to the other player for each\nof their atomic assertion where the associated experiments fails. For\nany game starting with my assertion of \\(\\varphi\\) my expected overall\nloss of money if we both play rationally can be shown to correspond\ninversely to the truth value of \\(\\varphi\\) evaluated in an\ninterpretation of Łukasiewicz logic that assigns the inverse of\nthe risk values as truth values to atomic formulas. In particular, a\nformula is valid in Łukasiewicz logic if and only if, for every\nrisk value assignment, I have a strategy that guarantees that my\nexpected overall loss at the end of game is \\(0\\) or negative. \nFermüller & Metcalfe (2009) have pointed out a correspondence\nbetween optimal strategies in Giles’s game and cut-free proofs\nin a hypersequent system for Łukasiewicz logic. The game has also\nbeen extended by Fermüller & Roschger (2014) to characterize\nvarious types of (semi-)fuzzy quantifiers, intended to model natural\nlanguage expressions like “about half” or “almost\nall”. \nParis (2000) provides an overview over other semantics supporting\nvarious choices of truth functions; in particular, re-randomizing\nsemantics (Hisdal 1988), similarity semantics (e.g., Ruspini 1991),\nacceptability semantics (Paris 1997), and approximation semantics\n(Paris 2000). Let us also mention the resource-based semantics of\nBěhounek (2009). Moreover there are different forms of evaluation\ngames for various fuzzy logics, besides the one of Giles for\nŁukasiewicz logic outlined above. An overview over those semantic\ngames can be found in Fermüller 2015. \nModeling reasoning with vague predicates and propositions is often\ncited as the main motivation for introducing fuzzy logics. There are\nmany alternative theories of vagueness (see entry on\n vagueness),\n but there is a general agreement that the susceptibility to the\nsorites paradox (see entry on\n sorites paradox)\n is a main feature of vagueness. Consider the following version of the\nparadox: \nAt the face of it, it seems not be unreasonable to accept these two\nassumptions. By instantiating \\(n\\) with \\(10^{100}\\) in\n (2)\n and applying modus ponens with\n (1)\n as the other premise we conclude that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge. By\nsimply repeating this type of inference we arrive at the unreasonable\nstatement \nFuzzy logic suggests an analysis of the sorites paradox that\nrespects the intuition that statement\n (2),\n while arguably not totally true, is almost true. \nThere are various ways to model this form of reasoning in t-norm based\nfuzzy logics that dissolve the paradox. For example, one may declare\nthat any instance of modus ponens is sound if the degree of\ntruth of the conclusion is not lower than that of the strong\nconjunction of its premises.[5]\n As indicated, one stipulates that every instance of\n (2)\n is true to degree \\(1-\\epsilon\\), for some very small number\n\\(\\epsilon\\). Even if we declare\n (1)\n to be perfectly true, the statement that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge, too,\nmight then be less than perfectly true without sacrificing the\nsoundness of instantiation and modus ponens. If, moreover,\nthe degree of truth of the conjunction of two not perfectly true (or\nnot perfectly false) statements is less than that of each conjunct, we\nmay safely declare that statement\n (3)\n is perfectly false and nevertheless insist on the soundness of each\nstep in the indicated chain of inferences. Informally speaking, the\nparadox disappears by assuming that repeatedly decreasing some\nperfectly huge number by a small amount leads to numbers of which it\nis less and less true that they are huge too. \nAn alternative truth degree based solution to the sorites\nparadox has been proposed by Hájek & Novák\n(2003). They introduce a new truth functional connective modeling the\nexpression “it is almost true that”.

It refers to a family of many-valued logics (see entry\non\n many-valued logic)\n and thus stipulates that the truth value (which, in this case amounts\nto a degree of truth) of a logically compound proposition, like\n“Carles is tall and Chris is rich”, is determined by the\ntruth value of its components. In other words, like in classical\nlogic, one imposes truth-functionality.\n\n\nFuzzy logic emerged in the context of the theory of fuzzy sets,\nintroduced by Zadeh (1965). A fuzzy set assigns a degree of\nmembership, typically a real number from the interval \\([0,1]\\), to\nelements of a universe. Fuzzy logic arises by assigning degrees of\ntruth to propositions. The standard set of truth values (degrees) is\n\\([0,1]\\), where \\(0\\) represents “totally false”, \\(1\\)\nrepresents “totally true”, and the other numbers refer to\npartial truth, i.e., intermediate degrees of\n truth.[1]\n\n\n“Fuzzy logic” is often understood in a very wide sense\nwhich includes all kinds of formalisms and techniques referring to the\nsystematic handling of degrees of some kind (see, e.g.,\nNguyen & Walker 2000). In particular in engineering contexts\n(fuzzy control, fuzzy classification, soft computing) it is aimed at\nefficient computational methods tolerant to suboptimality and\nimprecision (see, e.g., Ross 2010). This entry focuses on fuzzy logic\nin a narrow sense, established as a discipline of mathematical logic\nfollowing the seminal monograph by Petr Hájek (1998) and\nnowadays usually referred to as “mathematical fuzzy logic”\n(see Cintula, Fermüller, Hájek, & Noguera 2011 and\n2015). It focuses on logics based on a truth-functional account of\npartial truth and studies them in the spirit of classical mathematical\nlogic (syntax, model theoretic semantics, proof systems, completeness,\netc.; both, at propositional and the predicate level).\n\nThe standard set of truth degrees for fuzzy logics is the real unit\ninterval \\([0,1]\\) with its natural ordering \\(\\leq\\), ranging from\ntotal falsity (represented by \\(0\\)) to total truth (represented by\n\\(1\\)) through a continuum of intermediate truth degrees. The most\nfundamental assumption of (mainstream) mathematical fuzzy logic is\nthat connectives are to be interpreted truth-functionally over the set\nof truth-degrees. Such truth-functions are assumed to behave\nclassically on the extremal values \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). A very natural\nbehavior of conjunction and disjunction is achieved by imposing \\(x\n\\land y = \\min\\{x,y\\}\\) and \\(x \\lor y = \\max\\{x,y\\}\\) for each \\(x,y\n\\in [0,1]\\). \nAnother, non-idempotent, conjunction \\(\\&\\) is typically added to\naccount for the intuition that applying a partially true hypothesis\ntwice might lead to a different degree of truth than using it only\nonce. Such a conjunction is usually interpreted by a binary operation\non \\([0,1]\\), which is not necessarily idempotent, but still\nassociative, commutative, non-decreasing in both arguments and has\n\\(1\\) as neutral element. These operations are called t-norms\n(triangular norms) and their mathematical properties have\nbeen thoroughly studied (e.g., by Klement, Mesiar, & Pap 2000).\nProminent examples of t-norms are the already mentioned function\n\\(\\min\\), the standard product of real numbers, and the\nŁukasiewicz t-norm: \\(x *_{Ł} y=\\max\\{x+y-1,0\\}\\). These\nthree t-norms are actually continuous functions and any other\ncontinuous t-norm can be described as an ordinal sum of these\nthree basic ones (see, Ling 1965; Mostert & Shields 1957). \nNegation is interpreted by a non-increasing function assigning \\(0\\)\nto \\(1\\) and vice versa; usual choices are the Łukasiewicz\nnegation \\(\\neg_{Ł} x = 1 - x\\) and the Gödel negation:\n\\(\\neg_\\mathrm{G} 0 = 1\\) and \\(\\neg_\\mathrm{G} x = 0\\) for each \\(x\n> 0\\). It is also usual to introduce a constant symbol\n\\(\\overline{0}\\) for total falsity, hence interpreted as \\(0\\).\nFinally, a suitable choice for implication is the residuum of the\nt-norm \\(\\ast\\), that is, the unique function \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nsatisfying the so-called residuation condition: \\(x \\ast y\n\\leq z\\), if and only if, \\(x \\leq y \\Rightarrow z\\). Such a function\nexists (and is defined as \\(x \\Rightarrow y = \\max\\{z \\mid x \\ast z\n\\leq y\\}\\)) if, and only if, the t-norm is left-continuous. \nThe weakest logic with connectives interpreted by truth-functions of\nthe type described above is MTL (Monoidal T-norm based Logic,\nEsteva & Godo 2001). It is a logic with the primitive connectives\n\\(\\mathbin{\\&}, \\to, \\wedge,\\) and \\(\\overline{0}\\), and derivable\nconnectives defined as: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\varphi \\lor \\psi &= ((\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to \\psi) \\land ((\\psi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\varphi),\\\\\n\\neg \\varphi &= \\varphi \\to \\overline{0}, \\\\\n\\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\psi &= (\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\land (\\psi \\to \\varphi), and \\\\\n\\overline{1} &= \\neg \\overline{0}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n MTL is defined as a consequence\nrelation over the semantics given by all left-continuous t-norms.\nNamely, given a particular left-continuous t-norm \\(\\ast\\), an\nevaluation \\(e_\\ast\\) is a mapping from propositional variables to\n\\([0,1]\\), extended to all formulas by interpreting \\(\\&\\) as\n\\(\\ast\\), the implication \\(\\to\\) as its residuum \\(\\Rightarrow\\), and\n\\(\\land\\) and \\(\\overline{0}\\) as \\(\\min\\) and \\(0\\),\nrespectively. \nA formula \\(\\varphi\\) is a consequence of a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\)\nin MTL, denoted \\(\\Gamma \\models_\\mathrm{MTL} \\varphi\\), if for each\nleft-continuous t-norm \\(\\ast\\) and each evaluation \\(e_\\ast\\) such\nthat \\(e(\\psi) = 1\\) for each \\(\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\) we have \\(e(\\varphi)\n= 1\\); that is: each evaluation that makes the premises totally true\nmust also make the conclusion totally true. Formulas \\(\\varphi\\) that\nalways evaluate to \\(1\\) (\\(\\models_\\mathrm{MTL}\\varphi\\)) are called\ntautologies of MTL. Note that the formula \\((\\varphi \\mathbin{\\&}\n\\psi) \\to (\\varphi \\land \\psi)\\) is a tautology in MTL, i.e., the\nconjunction \\(\\&\\) is stronger than \\(\\land\\). \nMTL can also be presented by a Hilbert-style proof system with the\nfollowing axioms: \nand modus ponens as the only inference rule: from \\(\\varphi\\)\nand \\(\\varphi \\to \\psi\\), infer \\(\\psi\\). This system is a complete\naxiomatization of the logic MTL: \\(\\Gamma \\models_\\mathrm{MTL}\n\\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_\\mathrm{MTL} \\varphi\\), where the latter\nrelation denotes derivability from instances of the above axioms and\nformulas in \\(\\Gamma\\). The validity problem of \\(\\mathrm{MTL}\\) is\nknown to be decidable, however its computational complexity has not\nyet been determined. \n\nŁukasiewicz logic can be defined by adding \\[((\\varphi \\to \\psi)\n\\to \\psi) \\to ((\\psi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\varphi)\\] to the Hilbert-style\n\n system for MTL. It corresponds to the finitary version of\nthe consequence relation defined with respect to evaluations based on\nthe Łukasiewicz t-norm (in symbols: for each finite set\nof formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) and each formula \\(\\varphi\\), we have \\(\\Gamma\n\\models_{Ł} \\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{Ł}\n \\varphi\\)).[2] \nThis logic was an early example of a many-valued logic, introduced by\nŁukasiewicz & Tarski (1930), well before the inception of the\ntheory of fuzzy sets, by means of an equivalent axiomatic system (with\nmodus ponens as the only inference rule): \nŁukasiewicz logic is the only t-norm based fuzzy logic where all\nconnectives are interpreted by continuous functions, including the\nimplication which, as the residuum of \\(_{Ł}\\), is given by the\nfunction \\(x \\to_{Ł} y=\\min\\{1,1-x+y\\}\\). McNaughton’s\ntheorem (1951) states that real-valued functions over [0,1] that\ninterpret formulas of Łukasiewicz logic are exactly the\ncontinuous piecewise linear functions with integer coefficients. In\nterms of computational complexity, the validity problem for this logic\nis asymptotically not worse than in classical logic: it remains\ncoNP-complete. \nGödel–Dummett logic, also known as Dummett’s LC or\nsimply Gödel logic, is another early example of a many-valued\nlogic with truth values in \\([0,1]\\). It was introduced by Michael\nDummett (1959) as the extension of intuitionistic logic (see entry on\n intuitionistic logic)\n by the axiom \n\n\\[(\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\lor (\\psi \\to \\varphi).\\]\n\n This formula enforces a linear order in the\nunderlying (Kripke-style as well as algebraic) semantics. It also\nappears in the context of Gödel’s observation that it is\nimpossible to characterize intuitionistic logic by finite truth tables\n(Gödel 1932). Gödel–Dummett logic can alternatively be\nobtained as an axiomatic extension of MTL by adding the axiom\n\\(\\varphi \\to \\varphi \\mathbin{\\&} \\varphi\\), which amounts to\nrequiring the idempotence of \\(\\&\\), and hence making the\ninterpretation of both conjunctions coincide. In the fuzzy logic\nsetting the Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as the\nconsequence relation given by the minimum t-norm. It is distinguished\nas the only t-norm based logic where the truth of a formula in a given\nevaluation does not depend on the specific values assigned to the\npropositional variables, but only on the relative order of these\nvalues. In this sense, Gödel–Dummett logic can be seen as a\nlogic of comparative truth. Like for Łukasiewicz logic, the\ncomputational complexity of testing validity remains\ncoNP-complete. \nBesides MTL (the logic of all left-continuous t-norms) and\nŁukasiewicz and Gödel–Dummett logics (each induced by\none particular t-norm), one can consider logics induced by\nother sets of t-norms or, in general, arbitrary axiomatic extensions\nof MTL. In particular, the logic of all continuous t-norms\n(Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic) is obtained by adding the\naxiom \n\n\\[(\\varphi\\mathbin{\\&}(\\varphi\\to{{\\psi}})) \\to\n(\\psi\\mathbin{\\&}(\\psi\\to\\varphi))\\]\n\n to those of MTL. Actually, for any set of continuous\nt-norms there is a finite axiomatization of the corresponding logic\n(Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2003; Haniková 2014). In\nparticular the logic of the last prominent continuous t-norm\n(algebraic product), known as Product logic, is the extension of\nHájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic by the axiom: \n\n\\[\\neg\\varphi \\vee ((\\varphi\\to\\varphi\\mathbin{\\&}{{\\psi}})\\to{{\\psi}})\\]\n\n On\nthe other hand, not all axiomatic extensions of MTL can be given a\nsemantics of t-norms. For example, classical logic can be axiomatized\nas MTL \\(+\\) \\(\\varphi\\vee\\neg \\varphi\\), but the axiom of excluded\nmiddle is not a tautology under any t-norm based interpretation. \nThere are also reasons to consider weaker fuzzy logics. For example,\nit can be argued that the assumptions forcing the interpretation of\nthe conjunction to be a t-norm are too strong. In particular, the\nassumption that \\(1\\) is the neutral element of conjunction enforces a\ndefinition of tautology as a formula always evaluated to \\(1\\) and the\nconsequence relation as preservation of the value \\(1\\) – that\nis, \\(1\\) is the only designated value in the\n semantics.[3]\n A natural way to introduce logics with more than one designated truth\ndegree is to assume that the neutral element for \\(\\ast\\) is a number\n\\(t <1\\). (It can be shown that in this situation the designated\ntruth degrees are exactly those greater than or equal to \\(t\\).) Such\ninterpretations of conjunctions are called uninorms. The\nresulting logic was axiomatized by Metcalfe & Montagna (2007). \nAnalogously one may argue against commutativity or even against\nassociativity of conjunction. Axiomatizations of resulting logics are\ndescribed in the literature (see Cintula, Horčík, &\nNoguera 2013; Jenei & Montagna 2003); an exception is the logic of\nnon-commutative uninorms for which a natural axiomatic system is not\nknown. \nFinally, taking into account that fuzzy logics, unlike classical\nlogic, are typically not functionally complete, one can increase their\nexpressive power by adding new connectives. The most commonly\nconsidered connectives are: truth constants \\(\\bar r\\) for each\nrational number \\(r\\in (0,1)\\); unary connectives \\(\\sim\\) and\n\\(\\triangle\\) interpreted as \\({\\sim}x = 1-x\\) and \\(\\triangle x = 1\\)\nif \\(x=1\\) and \\(0\\) otherwise; a binary connective \\(\\odot\\)\ninterpreted as the usual algebraic product, etc. (Baaz 1996; Esteva,\nGispert, Godo, & Noguera 2007; Esteva, Godo, & Montagna 2001;\nEsteva, Godo, Hájek, & Navara 2000). \nA thorough overview of all the kinds of propositional fuzzy logics\nmentioned in this section (and a general theory thereof) can be found\nin the Handbook of Mathematical Fuzzy Logic (3 volumes,\nCintula et al. 2011a,b, 2015). \nGiven any propositional fuzzy logic L there is a uniform way to\nintroduce its first-order counterpart L\\(\\forall\\) in a predicate\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{P\\!L}\\) (defined as in the classical case). In\nthis section, for simplicity, we present it for t-norm based\nlogics. \nThe semantics is given by structures in which predicate symbols are\ninterpreted as functions mapping tuples of domain elements into truth\nvalues. More precisely, a structure \\({\\mathbf M}\\) consists of a\nnon-empty domain of elements \\(M\\), a function \\(f_{\\mathbf M}\\colon\nM^n\\to M\\) for each \\(n\\)-ary function symbol \\(f\\in \\mathcal{P\\!L}\\),\nand a function \\(P_{\\mathbf M}\\colon M^n\\to [0,1]\\) for each \\(n\\)-ary\npredicate symbol \\(P\\in \\mathcal{P\\!L}\\). Fixing an evaluation\n\\({\\mathrm v}\\) of object variables in \\(M\\), one defines values of\nterms (\\(\\|f(t_1,\\dots,t_n)\\|_{\\mathrm v} = f_{\\mathbf\nM}(\\|t_1\\|_{\\mathrm v},\\dots,\\|t_n\\|_{\\mathrm v})\\)) and truth values\nof atomic formulas (\\(\\|P(t_1,\\dots,t_n)\\|_{\\mathrm v} = P_{\\mathbf\nM}(\\|t_1\\|_{\\mathrm v},\\dots,\\|t_n\\|_{\\mathrm v})\\)). Truth values of\na universally/existentially quantified formula are computed as\ninfimum/supremum of truth values of instances of the formula where the\nquantified variable runs over all elements of the domain \\(M\\).\nFormally: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\|(\\forall x)\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} & = \\inf\\{\\|\\varphi\\|_{{\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]} \\mid a\\in M\\}\\\\\n  \\|(\\exists x)\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} & = \\sup\\{\\|\\varphi\\|_{{\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]}\\mid a\\in M\\},\\\\\n  \\end{align}\n\\]\n\n where \\({\\mathrm v}[x{:}a]\\) is the evaluation\nsending \\(x\\) to \\(a\\) and keeping values of other variables\nunchanged. The values of other formulas are computed using the truth\nfunctions for the propositional connectives of L. \nThe first-order logic L\\(\\forall\\) is then defined as the consequence\nrelation given by preservation of total truth (value \\(1\\)), as in the\npropositional case. More precisely, we say that a first-order formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a consequence of a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) (in\nsymbols: \\(\\Gamma \\models_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\)) if\n\\(\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\mathrm v} = 1\\) for each evaluation v, whenever\n\\(\\|\\psi\\|_{\\mathrm v} = 1\\) for each evaluation v and each \\(\\psi \\in\n\\Gamma\\). \nL\\(\\forall\\) can be given a Hilbert-style calculus with the following\naxioms: \nThe deduction rules of L\\(\\forall\\) are those of L plus the rule of\ngeneralization: from \\(\\varphi\\) infer \\((\\forall\nx)\\varphi\\). \nFor many notable propositional fuzzy logics (including MTL and\nGödel logic) the above axiomatic system is sound and complete\nwith respect to the semantics (i.e., \\(\\Gamma\n\\models_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\) iff \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\mathrm{L}\\forall} \\varphi\\) for each \\(\\Gamma\\) and each\n\\(\\varphi\\); Cintula, Horčík, & Noguera 2014). \nHowever, the first-order Łukasiewicz logic is not recursively\naxiomatizable as shown by Scarpellini (1962; Ragaz (1981) proved that\nthe set of tautologies is actually \\(\\Sigma_2\\)-complete in the sense\nof arithmetical hierarchy). Completeness can be achieved either by\nincluding an infinitary inference rule (Hay 1963) or by generalizing\nthe set of truth-values (see next section). The situation is even more\ncomplicated in the case of Hájek’s Basic Fuzzy Logic,\nwhere the set of first-order tautologies of all structures given by\ncontinuous t-norms is as complex as true arithmetics (Montagna\n2001). \nOne of the main tools in the study of fuzzy logic is that of algebraic\nsemantics (see entry on\n algebraic semantics).\n Roughly speaking, the idea is to replace the real unit interval with\nan arbitrary set and interpret the connectives as operations of\ncorresponding arities on that set. \nAn MTL-algebra (introduced by Esteva & Godo (2001)) is a tuple\n\\({\\mathbf A} = \\langle A, \\&, \\to, \\wedge, \\vee, \\overline{0},\n\\overline{1} \\rangle\\) where \nMTL-algebras are a generalization of the t-norm based semantics\nexplained above and provide a sound and complete semantics for\n MTL.[4] \nMTL-chains are those whose lattice order is total and they are the\nbasic building blocks of the whole class of algebras, in the sense\nthat each MTL-algebra can be decomposed as a subdirect\nproduct of chains. This implies that the logic is also complete\nwith respect to the semantics of MTL-chains, which is then used as the\nfirst step in the proof of its completeness with respect to the t-norm\nbased semantics (Jenei & Montagna 2002). \nAlgebraic semantics is a universal tool that can be used for any\nlogic. In particular, for any arbitrary fuzzy logic studied in the\nliterature (even those not supporting a t-norm based semantics such as\nfinite-valued fuzzy logics or the logic of non-commutative uninorms)\none can find a corresponding class of algebras which can be decomposed\nas subdirect products of chains. This fact has led Běhounek &\nCintula (2006) to propose a definition of fuzzy logics as logics that\nare complete with respect to totally ordered algebraic structures. \nThe use of algebraic semantics for first-order logics usually yields\nlower complexity for testing validity or satisfiability than standard\nsemantics (Montagna & Noguera 2010). \nIt has been a considerable challenge to come up with analytic proof\nsystems for fuzzy logics. These are systems that share important\nfeatures, like the eliminability of cuts and the subformula property,\nwith Gentzen’s sequent calculi for classical and intuitionistic\nlogic (see entry on\n the development of proof theory).\n A major breakthrough has been achieved with the introduction of a\nso-called hypersequent calculus for Gödel–Dummett logic by\nArnon Avron (1991). Hypersequent calculi arise from sequent calculi by\nconsidering finite multisets or sequences of sequents, interpreted as\ndisjunctions of sequents, as main object of inference. In the case of\nGödel–Dummett logic one lifts the rules of Gentzen’s\nintuitionistic sequent calculus by simply adding side-hypersequents to\nthe upper and lower sequents. For example, the sequent rule for\nintroducing disjunction on the right hand side \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Gamma_1 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\hspace{3ex} \\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\psi}{\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\vee \\psi}\\]\n\n where\n\\(\\Gamma_1\\) and \\(\\Gamma_2\\) are finite sequences of formulas, is\nturned into the following hypersequent rule: \n\n\\[\\frac{H \\mid \\Gamma_1 \\Rightarrow \\phi \\hspace{3ex} H' \\mid \\Gamma_2\n\\Rightarrow \\psi}{H \\mid H' \\mid \\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\phi\n\\vee \\psi }\\]\n\n where \\(H\\)\nand \\(H'\\) denote the side-hypersequents, i.e., finite sequences or\nmultisets of sequents. This by itself does not change the\ncorresponding logic (intuitionistic logic, in this case). The crucial\nadditional structural rule is the so-called communication rule:\n\n\\[\\frac{H \\mid \\Gamma_1,\\Pi_1 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_1 \\hspace{3ex} H'\n\\mid \\Gamma_2,\\Pi_2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_2}{H \\mid H' \\mid\n\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta_1 \\mid \\Pi_2,\\Pi_2 \\Rightarrow\n\\Delta_2}\\]\n\n Here \\(\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2,\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2\\) are finite lists\nof formulas; \\(\\Delta_1\\) and \\(\\Delta_2\\) are either single formulas\nor remain empty; \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) denote the side-hypersequents, like\nabove. \nTo obtain a hypersequent calculus for the fundamental fuzzy logic MTL\none has to add the communication rule to a sequent system for\ncontraction-free version of intuitionistic logic. Analytic proof\nsystems for other fuzzy logics, in particular Łukasiewicz logic,\ncall for a more radical departure from traditional calculi, where the\nsequent components of hypersequents are interpreted differently than\nintuitionistic or classical sequents. Also so-called labeled proof\nsystems and various tableau calculi have been suggested. A detailed\npresentation of the corresponding state of the art can be found in\nMetcalfe, Olivetti, & Gabbay 2008 and Metcalfe 2011. \nIt is desirable, not only from a philosophical point of view, but also\nto a get a better grip on potential applications of fuzzy logics to\nrelate the meaning of intermediary truth values and corresponding\nlogical connectives to basic models of reasoning with vague and\nimprecise notions. A number of such semantics that seek to justify\nparticular choices of truth functional connectives have been\nintroduced. Just two of them are briefly described here. \nVoting semantics is based on the idea that different agents (voters)\nmay coherently judge the same proposition differently. The proportion\nof agents that accept a proposition \\(\\varphi\\) as true may be seen as\na truth value. Without further restrictions this does not lead to a\ntruth functional semantics, but rather to an assignment of\nprobabilities to propositions. But if one assigns a fixed level of\nskepticism to each agent and imposes some natural conditions that\nkeep the judgments on logically complex statements consistent with\nthose levels, then one can recover \\(\\min\\), \\(\\max\\), and \\(1-x\\) as\ntruth functions for conjunction, disjunction and negation,\nrespectively. Details can be found in Lawry 1998. \nAnother intriguing model of reasoning that provides a justification\nfor all propositional connectives of standard Łukasiewicz logic\nhas been introduced by Giles (1974). It consists in a game, where two\nplayers, I and you, systematically reduce logically complex assertions\n(formulas) to simpler ones according to rules like the following: \nThe rules for quantified statements refer to a fixed domain, assuming\nthat there is a constant symbol for each domain element one\nstipulates: \nThe rules for your assertions are dual. At each state of the game an\noccurrence of a non-atomic formula in either the multiset of current\nassertions by me or by you is chosen and gets replaced by subformulas,\nas indicated by these rules, until only atomic assertions remain. A\nfinal game state is then evaluated according to the following betting\nscheme. \nFor each atomic formula there is a corresponding experiment which may\neither fail or succeed, but may show dispersion, i.e., it may yield\ndifferent results when repeated. A fixed failure probability, called\nrisk value, is assigned to each experiment and thus to each atomic\nformula. The players have to pay \\(\\$\\)1 to the other player for each\nof their atomic assertion where the associated experiments fails. For\nany game starting with my assertion of \\(\\varphi\\) my expected overall\nloss of money if we both play rationally can be shown to correspond\ninversely to the truth value of \\(\\varphi\\) evaluated in an\ninterpretation of Łukasiewicz logic that assigns the inverse of\nthe risk values as truth values to atomic formulas. In particular, a\nformula is valid in Łukasiewicz logic if and only if, for every\nrisk value assignment, I have a strategy that guarantees that my\nexpected overall loss at the end of game is \\(0\\) or negative. \nFermüller & Metcalfe (2009) have pointed out a correspondence\nbetween optimal strategies in Giles’s game and cut-free proofs\nin a hypersequent system for Łukasiewicz logic. The game has also\nbeen extended by Fermüller & Roschger (2014) to characterize\nvarious types of (semi-)fuzzy quantifiers, intended to model natural\nlanguage expressions like “about half” or “almost\nall”. \nParis (2000) provides an overview over other semantics supporting\nvarious choices of truth functions; in particular, re-randomizing\nsemantics (Hisdal 1988), similarity semantics (e.g., Ruspini 1991),\nacceptability semantics (Paris 1997), and approximation semantics\n(Paris 2000). Let us also mention the resource-based semantics of\nBěhounek (2009). Moreover there are different forms of evaluation\ngames for various fuzzy logics, besides the one of Giles for\nŁukasiewicz logic outlined above. An overview over those semantic\ngames can be found in Fermüller 2015. \nModeling reasoning with vague predicates and propositions is often\ncited as the main motivation for introducing fuzzy logics. There are\nmany alternative theories of vagueness (see entry on\n vagueness),\n but there is a general agreement that the susceptibility to the\nsorites paradox (see entry on\n sorites paradox)\n is a main feature of vagueness. Consider the following version of the\nparadox: \nAt the face of it, it seems not be unreasonable to accept these two\nassumptions. By instantiating \\(n\\) with \\(10^{100}\\) in\n (2)\n and applying modus ponens with\n (1)\n as the other premise we conclude that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge. By\nsimply repeating this type of inference we arrive at the unreasonable\nstatement \nFuzzy logic suggests an analysis of the sorites paradox that\nrespects the intuition that statement\n (2),\n while arguably not totally true, is almost true. \nThere are various ways to model this form of reasoning in t-norm based\nfuzzy logics that dissolve the paradox. For example, one may declare\nthat any instance of modus ponens is sound if the degree of\ntruth of the conclusion is not lower than that of the strong\nconjunction of its premises.[5]\n As indicated, one stipulates that every instance of\n (2)\n is true to degree \\(1-\\epsilon\\), for some very small number\n\\(\\epsilon\\). Even if we declare\n (1)\n to be perfectly true, the statement that \\(10^{100}-1\\) is huge, too,\nmight then be less than perfectly true without sacrificing the\nsoundness of instantiation and modus ponens. If, moreover,\nthe degree of truth of the conjunction of two not perfectly true (or\nnot perfectly false) statements is less than that of each conjunct, we\nmay safely declare that statement\n (3)\n is perfectly false and nevertheless insist on the soundness of each\nstep in the indicated chain of inferences. Informally speaking, the\nparadox disappears by assuming that repeatedly decreasing some\nperfectly huge number by a small amount leads to numbers of which it\nis less and less true that they are huge too. \nAn alternative truth degree based solution to the sorites\nparadox has been proposed by Hájek & Novák\n(2003). They introduce a new truth functional connective modeling the\nexpression “it is almost true that”. In this manner they\nformalize sorites-style reasoning within an axiomatic theory\nof an appropriate t-norm based fuzzy logic. \nSmith (2008; see also 2005) has argued that the so-called\ncloseness principle captures the essence of vagueness. It\nexpresses that statements of the same form about indistinguishable\nobjects should remain close in respect of truth. It is a hallmark of\nmany approaches to the paradox that employ fuzzy logic that they are\ncompatible with this\n principle.[6]","contact.mail":"carles.noguera.clofent@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
