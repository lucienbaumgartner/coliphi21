V. O. Quine. Davidson’s ideas, presented in a series\nof essays (and one posthumous monograph) from the 1960s onwards, have\nhad an impact in a range of areas from semantic theory through to\nepistemology and ethics. His work exhibits a breadth of approach, as\nwell as a unitary and systematic character, that is unusual within\ntwentieth century analytic philosophy. Thus, although he acknowledged\nan important debt to Quine, Davidson’s thought amalgamates\ninfluences (though these are not always explicit) from a variety of\nsources, including Quine, C. I. Lewis, Frank Ramsey, Immanuel Kant and\nthe later Wittgenstein. And while often developed separately,\nDavidson’s ideas nevertheless combine in such a way as to\nprovide a single integrated approach to the problems of knowledge,\naction, language and mind. The breadth and unity of his thought, in\ncombination with the sometimes-terse character of his prose, means\nthat Davidson is not an easy writer to approach. Given the demanding\nnature of his work, it is perhaps only to be expected that it would\nreceive a range of interpretations and assessments, and this is\nespecially true of much of the engagement with Davidson’s\nthought that has developed in recent years. In a number of\npublications, Ernest Lepore and Kirk Ludwig, in particular, have\nadvanced a critical interpretation of Davidson’s philosophy that\nfocuses on his earlier work, especially his contributions to the\ntheory of meaning and philosophy of action, but that is largely\nnegative in its assessment of the cogency of Davidson’s\narguments, and the philosophical viability of the positions he\nadvances (see, for instance, Lepore and Ludwig 2005). At the same\ntime, the re-publication of Davidson’s later essays has\ndisseminated them to a wider, and often newly-appreciative, audience,\nwhile the work, not only of Richard Rorty, but also of Robert Brandom,\nand, to some extent, John McDowell, is suggestive of a broader and\nmore positive engagement with Davidson’s thinking. In addition,\nDavidson’s work has also been an important, if sometimes\ncontentious, point of focus for philosophical interaction between\nanalytic and so-called ‘continental’ thought (particularly\nin relation to hermeneutic and literary theory – see, for\ninstance, Malpas 1992, and Dasenbrock 1993). Regardless of divergence\nin interpretation, then, Davidson’s work still attracts\nconsiderable philosophical attention, and seems likely to have a\ncontinuing influence and significance.\n\nDonald Herbert Davidson was born on March 6th, 1917, in Springfield,\nMassachusetts, USA. He died suddenly, as a consequence of cardiac\narrest following knee surgery, on Aug. 30, 2003, in Berkeley,\nCalifornia. Remaining both physically and philosophically active up\nuntil his death, Davidson left behind a number of important and\nunfinished projects including a major book on the nature of\npredication. The latter volume was published posthumously (see\nDavidson 2005b), together with two additional volumes of collected\nessays (Davidson 2004, 2005a), under the guidance of Marcia\nCavell. \nDavidson completed his undergraduate study at Harvard, graduating in\n1939. His early interests were in literature and classics and, as an\nundergraduate, Davidson was strongly influenced by A. N. Whitehead.\nAfter starting graduate work in classical philosophy (completing a\nMaster’s degree in 1941), Davidson’s studies were\ninterrupted by service with the US Navy in the Mediterranean from\n1942–45. He continued work in classical philosophy after the\nwar, graduating from Harvard in 1949 with a dissertation on\nPlato’s ‘Philebus’ (1990b). By this time, however,\nthe direction of Davidson’s thinking had already, under\nQuine’s influence, changed quite dramatically (the two having\nfirst met at Harvard in 1939–40) and he had begun to move away\nfrom the largely literary and historical concerns that had preoccupied\nhim as an undergraduate towards a more strongly analytical\napproach. \nWhile his first position was at Queen’s College in New York,\nDavidson spent much of the early part of his career (1951–1967)\nat Stanford University. He subsequently held positions at Princeton\n(1967–1970), Rockefeller (1970–1976), and the University\nof Chicago (1976–1981). From 1981 until his death he worked at\nthe University of California, Berkeley. Davidson was the recipient of\na number of awards and fellowships and was a visitor at many\nuniversities around the world. Davidson was married three times, with\nhis third marriage, in 1984, being to Marcia Cavell, who undertook the\nediting of Davidson’s posthumously published essays. For more on\nDavidson’s biography, as well as reminiscences from those who\nknew him, see Baghramian 2013. \nMuch of Davidson’s early work was in decision theory (see\nDecision-Making: An Experimental Approach [1957]), and it was\nnot until the early 1960s that the work for which he is best known\nbegan to appear in print. Indeed, Davidson’s first major\nphilosophical publication was the seminal paper ‘Actions,\nReasons and Causes’ (1963). In that paper Davidson sets out to\ndefend the view that the explanation of action by reference to reasons\n(something we do, for instance, when we refer to an agent’s\nintentions or motives in acting) is also a form of causal explanation.\nIndeed, he argues that reasons explain actions just inasmuch as they\nare the causes of those actions. This approach was in clear opposition\nto the Wittgensteinian orthodoxy of the time. On this latter account\ncausal explanation was viewed as essentially a matter of showing the\nevent to be explained as an instance of some law-like regularity (as\nwe might explain the whistling of a kettle by reference to certain\nlaws involving, among other things, the behaviour of gases under\npressure). Since rational explanation was held, in general, not to\ninvolve any such reference to laws, but rather required showing how\nthe action fitted into some larger pattern of rational behaviour,\nexplanation by reference to reasons was held to be distinct from and\nindependent of explanation by reference to causes.  \nAlthough directed against the Wittgensteinian-inspired view that\nreasons cannot be causes, Davidson’s argument nevertheless\neffectively redeploys a number of Wittgensteinian notions (see\nStoutland 2011, for a sympathetic, but not uncritical, examination of\nthe Davidsonian view of action from a largely Wittgensteinian\nperspective). Two ideas play an especially significant role in the\nDavidsonian account – ideas that are also, in one form or\nanother, important in Davidson’s thinking elsewhere. The first\nof these ideas is the notion of a ‘primary reason’ –\nthe pairing of a belief and a desire (or ‘pro-attitude’)\nin the light of which an action is explained. Thus, my action of\nflipping the light switch can be explained by reference to my having\nthe belief that flipping the switch turns on the light in\ncombination with my having the desire to turn on the light\n(for most explanations explicit reference to both the belief and the\ndesire is unnecessary). An action is thus rendered intelligible\nthrough being embedded in a broader system of attitudes attributable\nto the agent – through being embedded, that is, in a broader\nframework of rationality. The second idea is that of action\n‘under a description’ (a phrase originally appearing in G.\nE. M. Anscombe’s Intention, published in 1959). As with\nthe concept of a primary reason the idea here is simple enough: one\nand the same action is always amenable to more than one correct\ndescription. This idea is especially important, however, as it\nprovides a means by which the same item of behaviour can be understood\nas intentional under some descriptions but not under others. Thus my\naction of flipping the light switch can be redescribed as the act of\nturning on the light (under which it is intentional) and also as the\nact of alerting the prowler who, unbeknown to me, is lurking in the\nbushes outside (under which it is unintentional). Generalising this\npoint we can say that the same event can be referred to under quite\ndisparate descriptions: the event of alerting the prowler is the same\nevent as my flipping the light switch which is the same event as my\nmoving of my body (or a part of my body) in a certain way. \nDavidson treats the connection between reason and action (where the\nreason is indeed the reason for the action) as a connection\nthat obtains between two events (the agent’s believing and\ndesiring on the one hand and her acting on the other) that can be\nvariously described. The connection is both rational, inasmuch as the\nbelief-desire pair (the ‘primary reason’) specifies the\nreason for the action, but it is also causal, inasmuch as the one\nevent causes the other if it is indeed the reason for it. It is\nprecisely because the reason is causally related to the action that\nthe action can be explained by reference to the reason. Indeed, where\nan agent has a number of reasons for acting, and yet acts on the basis\nof one reason in particular, there is no way to pick out just that\nreason on which the agent acts other than by saying that it is the\nreason that caused her action. \nUnderstood as rational the connection between reason and action cannot\nbe described in terms of any strict law. Yet inasmuch as the\nconnection is also a causal connection, so there must exist some\nlaw-like regularity, though not describable in the language of\nrationality, under which the events in question fall (an explanation\ncan be causal, then, even though it does not specify any strict law).\nDavidson is thus able to maintain that rational explanation need not\ninvolve explicit reference to any law-like regularity, while\nnevertheless also holding that there must be some such regularity that\nunderlies the rational connection just inasmuch as it is causal.\nMoreover, since Davidson resists the idea that rational explanations\ncan be formulated in the terms of a predictive science, so he seems\ncommitted to denying that there can be any reduction of rational to\nnon-rational explanation. \nThe more developed argument for this latter claim, and for the more\ngeneral position in the philosophy of mind, of which it forms a part,\nappears at a number of places in Davidson’s work. The first and\nbest-known presentation is that of ‘Mental Events’ (1970b)\nin which Davidson argues for the compatibility of three principles\n(all three of which are adumbrated in various ways in the argument of\n‘Actions, Reasons and Causes’): (i) that at least some\nmental events interact causally with physical events – The\nPrinciple of Causal Interaction; (ii) that events related as\ncause and effect fall under strict laws (that is, laws that are\n‘precise, explicit and as exceptionless as possible’)\n– The Principle of the Nomological Character of\nCausality; and (iii) that there are no strict laws (as opposed to\nmere generalisations) relating mental and physical events –\nThe Anomalism of the Mental. Of these principles the first\ntwo would ordinarily be held to be incompatible with the third, and to\nimply, not the ‘anomalism’ of the mental, but rather, in\nthe case of mental and physical events related as cause and effect,\nthe existence of strict laws relating those events. To argue, as does\nDavidson, for the compatibility of the original principles is thus\nalso to argue for the truth of the third, that is, for the truth of\nanomalous monism.  \nDavidson holds that events are particulars such that the same event\ncan be referred to under more than one description. He also holds that\nevents that are causally related must be related under some strict\nlaw. However, since Davidson takes laws to be linguistic entities, so\nthey can relate events only as those events are given under specific\ndescriptions. Thus, as was already evident in Davidson’s\napproach to the theory of action, the same pair of events may\ninstantiate a law under one description, but not under others. There\nis, for example, no strict law that relates, under just those\ndescriptions, the formation of ice on the surface of a road to the\nskidding of a car on that road, and yet, under a different description\n(a description that will employ a completely different set of\nconcepts), the events at issue will indeed be covered by some strict\nlaw or set of laws. But while nomological relations between events\n(relations involving laws) depend on the descriptions under which the\nevents are given, relations of causality and identity obtain\nirrespective of descriptions – if the icing-up of the road did\nindeed cause the skid, then it did so no matter how the events at\nissue are described. (The form of description – whether mental\nor physical – is thus irrelevant to the fact that a particular\ncausal relation obtains). It follows that the same pair of events may\nbe related causally, and yet, under certain descriptions (though not\nunder all), there be no strict law under which those events fall. In\nparticular, it is possible that a mental event – an event given\nunder some mental description – will be causally related to some\nphysical event – an event given under a physical description\n– and yet there will be no strict law covering those events\nunder just those descriptions. My wanting to read Tolstoy,\nfor instance, leads me to take War and Peace from the shelf,\nand so my wanting causes a change in the physical arrangement of a\ncertain region of space-time, but there is no strict law that relates\nmy wanting to the physical change. Similarly, while any mental event\nwill be identical with some physical event – it will indeed be\none and the same event under two descriptions – it is possible\nthat there will be no strict law relating the event as described in\nmentalistic terms with the event as physically described. In fact,\nDavidson is explicit in claiming that there can be no strict\nlaws that relate the mental and the physical in this way – there\nis no strict law that relates, for instance, wanting to read with a\nparticular kind of brain activity. \nDavidson’s denial of the existence of any strict\n‘psycho-physical’ laws follows from his view of the mental\nas constrained by quite general principles of rationality that do not\napply, at least not in the same way, to physical descriptions:\nnormative considerations of overall consistency and coherence, for\ninstance, constrain our own thinking about events as physically\ndescribed, but they have no purchase on physical events as such. This\ndoes not mean, of course, that there are no correlations whatsoever to\nbe discerned between the mental and the physical, but it does mean\nthat the correlations that can be discerned cannot be rendered in the\nprecise, explicit and exceptionless form – in the form, that is,\nof strict laws – that would be required in order to achieve any\nreduction of mental to physical descriptions. The lack of strict laws\ncovering events under mental descriptions is thus an insuperable\nbarrier to any attempt to bring the mental within the framework of\nunified physical science. However, while the mental is not reducible\nto the physical, every mental event can be paired with some physical\nevent – that is, every mental description of an event can be\npaired with a physical description of the very same event. This leads\nDavidson to speak of the mental as ‘supervening’ on the\nphysical in a way that implies a certain dependence of mental\npredicates on physical predicates: predicate p supervenes on\na set of predicates S ‘if and only if p does\nnot distinguish any entities that cannot be distinguished by\nS’ (see ‘Thinking Causes’ [1993]). Put more\nsimply, events that cannot be distinguished under some physical\ndescription cannot be distinguished under a mental description\neither. \nOn the face of it, anomalous monism appears a highly attractive way to\nthink about the relation between the mental and the physical –\ninasmuch as it combines ‘monism’ with\n‘anomalism’ so it seems to preserve what is important\nabout physicalism while nevertheless retaining the ordinary language\nof so-called ‘folk-psychology’ (the language of beliefs\nand desires, actions and reasons). In fact anomalous monism has proved\nto be a highly contentious position drawing criticism from both\nphysicalists and non-physicalists alike. The nomological conception of\ncausality (the second of the three principles defended in\n‘Mental Events’) has often been seen as something for\nwhich Davidson fails to supply any real argument (a criticism he has\nattempted to address in ‘Laws and Cause’ [1995]); the\nDavidsonian account of supervenience has been viewed as incompatible\nwith other aspects of his position and sometimes as simply mistaken or\nconfused; and, perhaps the most serious and widespread criticism,\nanomalous monism has been seen as making the mental causally inert.\nThese criticisms have not, however, gone unanswered (see especially\n‘Thinking Causes’), and although Davidson modified aspects\nof his position over the years, he continued to hold to, and to\ndefend, the basic theses first made explicit in ‘Mental\nEvents’. \nDavidson’s commitment to the rationality of the mental as one of\nthe cornerstones of anomalous monism (as well as to the account of\n‘radical interpretation’ [see ‘Meaning and\nTruth’ below]) led him to take a special interest in the problem\nof apparently irrational belief and action – something first\naddressed in ‘How is Weakness of the Will\nPossible?’(1970a). While Davidson treats irrationality as a real\nfeature of our mental lives, he offers a way of dealing with it that\naims at preserving, in some sense, the overall rationality of the mind\n(see especially ‘Two Paradoxes of Irrationality’ [1982b]).\nA belief or desire in the mind of one person can cause a belief or\ndesire in the mind of another without this compromising the\nrationality of the mental. (Davidson’s example is my growing of\na beautiful flower because I desire you to enter my garden – you\ndevelop a craving to see the flower as a result of my desire and my\ndesire has thereby caused, without being a reason for, your craving).\nDavidson suggests that we should view the same sort of relation as\nsometimes holding within a single mind. To this end we should view the\nmind as weakly ‘partitioned’ so that different attitudes\nmay be located within different ‘territories’ and need\nnot, therefore, be taken to come into direct conflict.  \nDavidson’s thinking about irrationality was increasingly\ninfluenced by an engagement with psychoanalytic thinking. Marcia\nCavell, Davidson’s third wife, had strong psychoanalytic\ninterests, and in The Psychoanalytic Mind (Cavell 1993), she\nconnects Davidson’s thought directly with that of Freud. \nDavidson’s accounts of action and of mind call upon a\nwell-developed set of analyses concerning psychological concepts such\nas belief, desire and intention – concepts whose analysis is\ntaken further in a number of papers that follow on from, and develop\nor modify, the ideas first set out in ‘Actions, Reasons and\nCauses’ (papers such as ‘Agency’ (1971) and\n‘Intending’ [1978a]) as well as in Davidson’s\ndiscussions of epistemological and semantic issues (see below). But\nDavidson ‘s work in this area is also dependent on his account\nof the notions of cause, event and law and, in particular, on his\ndefence of the view that events are particulars and so constitute a\nfundamental ontological category. If events are indeed particulars\nthen an important question concerns the conditions of identity for\nevents. In ‘The Individuation of Events’ [1969a] Davidson\nargues that events are identical if and only if they have exactly the\nsame causes and effects. In ‘Reply to Quine on Events’\n[1985b] he abandons this criterion in favour of the Quinean suggestion\nthat events are identical if and only if they occupy exactly the same\nlocation in space and time.  \nA characteristic feature of Davidson’s approach to such\nontological questions has been to focus on the logical structure of\nsentences about the entities at issue rather than on those entities as\nsuch. Davidson’s approach to events, for instance, is grounded\nin an analysis of the underlying logical form of sentences about\nevents; in the case of causal relations, in an analysis of the logical\nform of sentences that express such relations (see ‘Causal\nRelations’ [1967a]); and in his approach to action also,\nDavidson’s approach involves an analysis of the logical form of\nsentences about actions (see ‘The Logical Form of Action\nSentences’ [1967b]). This reflects a more general commitment on\nDavidson’s part to the inseparability of questions of ontology\nfrom questions of logic. This commitment is spelt out explicitly in\n‘The Method of Truth in Metaphysics’ (1977) and it\nprovides a further point of connection between Davidson’s work\nin the philosophy of action, event and mind and his work on questions\nof meaning and language. \nAlthough Davidson wrote on a wide range of topics, a great deal of his\nwork, particularly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, is focussed\non the problem of developing an approach to the theory of meaning that\nwould be adequate to natural language. The characteristic feature of\nDavidson’s approach to this problem is his proposal that meaning\nis best understood via the concept of truth, and, more particularly,\nthat the basic structure for any adequate theory of meaning is that\ngiven in a formal theory of truth.  \nDavidson’s thinking about semantic theory develops on the basis\nof a holistic conception of linguistic understanding (see ‘Truth\nand Meaning’ [1967c]). Providing a theory of meaning for a\nlanguage is thus a matter of developing a theory that will enable us\nto generate, for every actual and potential sentence of the language\nin question, a theorem that specifies what each sentence means. On\nthis basis a theory of meaning for German that was given in English\nmight be expected to generate theorems that would explicate the German\nsentence ‘Schnee ist weiss’ as meaning that snow is white.\nSince the number of potential sentences in any natural language is\ninfinite, a theory of meaning for a language that is to be of use to\ncreatures with finite powers such as ourselves, must be a theory that\ncan generate an infinity of theorems (one for each sentence) on the\nbasis of a finite set of axioms. Indeed, any language that is to be\nlearnable by creatures such as ourselves must possess a structure that\nis amenable to such an approach. Consequently, the commitment to\nholism also entails a commitment to a compositional\napproach according to which the meanings of sentences are seen to\ndepend upon the meanings of their parts, that is, upon the meanings of\nthe words that form the finite base of the language and out of which\nsentences are composed. Compositionality does not compromise holism,\nsince not only does it follow from it, but, on the Davidsonian\napproach, it is only as they play a role in whole sentences that\nindividual words can be viewed as meaningful. It is sentences, and not\nwords, that are thus the primary focus for a Davidsonian theory of\nmeaning. Developing a theory for a language is a matter of developing\na systematic account of the finite structure of the language that\nenables the user of the theory to understand any and every sentence of\nthe language. \nA Davidsonian theory of meaning explicates the meanings of expressions\nholistically through the interconnection that obtains among\nexpressions within the structure of the language as a whole.\nConsequently, although it is indeed a theory of meaning, a\ntheory of the sort Davidson proposes will have no use for a concept of\nmeaning understood as some discrete entity (whether a determinate\nmental state or an abstract ‘idea’) to which meaningful\nexpressions refer. One important implication of this is that the\ntheorems that are generated by such a theory of meaning cannot be\nunderstood as theorems that relate expressions and\n‘meanings’. Instead such theorems will relate sentences to\nother sentences. More particularly, they will relate sentences in the\nlanguage to which the theory applies (the\n‘object-language’) to sentences in the language in which\nthe theory of meaning is itself couched (the\n‘meta-language’) in such a way that the latter effectively\n‘give the meanings of’ or translate the former. It might\nbe thought that the way to arrive at theorems of this sort is to take\nas the general form of such theorems ‘s means that\np’ where s names an object-language sentence\nand p is a sentence in the meta-language. But this would be\nalready to assume that we could give a formal account of the\nconnecting phrase ‘means that’, and not only does this\nseem unlikely, but it also appears to assume a concept of meaning when\nit is precisely that concept (at least as it applies within a\nparticular language) that the theory aims to elucidate. It is at this\npoint that Davidson turns to the concept of truth. Truth, he argues,\nis a less opaque concept than that of meaning. Moreover, to specify\nthe conditions under which a sentence is true is also a way of\nspecifying the meaning of a sentence. Thus, instead of\n‘s means that p’, Davidson proposes, as\nthe model for theorems of an adequate theory of meaning,\n‘s is true if and only if p’ (the use of\nthe biconditional ‘if and only if’ is crucial here as it\nensures the truth-functional equivalence of the sentences s\nand p, that is, it ensures they will have identical\ntruth-values). The theorems of a Davidsonian theory of meaning for\nGerman couched in English would thus take the form of sentences such\nas “‘Schnee ist weiss’ is true if and only if snow\nis white.” \nOne of the great advantages of this proposal is that it enables\nDavidson to connect his account of a theory of meaning with an already\nexisting approach to the theory of truth, namely that developed by\nAlfred Tarski (in his seminal work ‘The Concept of Truth in\nFormalised Languages’, first published in Polish in 1933 and in\nEnglish translation in 1956). Tarski’s theory of truth was\noriginally intended, not as a general account of the nature of truth,\nbut rather as a way of defining the truth-predicate as it applies\nwithin a formal language. Tarski suggests that we arrive at a formal\ndefinition of the predicate ‘is true’ by providing, for\nevery sentence s in the object language, a matching sentence\np in the meta-language that is a translation of s\n(here, in his use of the idea of translational synonymy, Tarski\nactually relies upon the concept of meaning in order to get at a\ntheory of truth – Davidson reverses this approach). The\nresulting ‘T-sentences’ will have the form\n‘s is true in language L if and only if\np’. That an adequate theory should indeed be capable of\ngenerating a T-sentence for every sentence in the object-language is\nthe essence of Tarski’s ‘Convention T’ – a\nrequirement that clearly matches the holistic requirement Davidson\nalso specifies for an adequate theory of meaning. And just as a\nDavidsonian theory of meaning treats the meaning of whole sentences as\ndependent on the components of those sentences, so a Tarskian theory\nof truth also operates recursively by means of the technical\nnotion of satisfaction – a notion that stands to open\nsentences (expressions containing unbound variables) as does truth to\nclosed sentences (expressions that contain no variables other than\nbound variables) – such that the satisfaction conditions of more\ncomplex sentences are seen to depend on the satisfaction conditions of\nsimpler sentences.  \nThe formal structure that Tarski articulates in his\n‘semantic’ account of truth is identical to that which\nDavidson explicates as the basis for a theory of meaning: a Tarskian\ntruth theory can generate, for every sentence of the object-language,\na T- sentence that specifies the meaning of each sentence in the sense\nof specifying the conditions under which it is true. What\nDavidson’s work shows, then, is that meeting the requirement of\nTarski’s Convention T can be seen as the basic requirement for\nan adequate theory of meaning. \nA Tarskian truth theory defines truth on the basis of a logical\napparatus that requires little more than the resources provided within\nfirst-order quantificational logic as supplemented by set theory.\nMoreover, it also operates to deliver a definition of truth that is\npurely ‘extensional’, that is, it defines truth by\nspecifying just those instances to which the truth-predicate properly\napplies without any reference to ‘meanings’,\n‘thoughts’ or other ‘intensional’ entities.\nBoth these features represent important advantages for the Davidsonian\napproach (Davidson’s rejection of determinate meanings as having\na significant role to play in a theory of meaning already involves a\ncommitment to an extensional approach to language). However, these\nfeatures also present certain problems. Davidson wishes to apply the\nTarskian model as the basis for a theory of meaning for natural\nlanguages, but such languages are far richer than the well-defined\nformal systems to which Tarski had directed his attention. In\nparticular natural languages contain features that seem to require\nresources beyond those of first-order logic or of any purely\nextensional analysis. Examples of such features include indirect or\nreported speech (‘Galileo said that the earth moves’),\nadverbial expressions (‘Flora swam slowly ‘ where\n‘slowly’ modifies ‘Flora swam’) and\nnon-indicative sentences such as imperatives (‘Eat your\neggplant!’). An important part of Davidson’s work in the\nphilosophy of language has been to show how such apparently\nrecalcitrant features of natural language can indeed be analysed so as\nto make them amenable to a Tarskian treatment. In ‘On Saying\nThat’ (1968) and ‘Quotation’ (1979b) he addresses\nthe question of indirect speech; in ‘Moods and\nPerformances’ (1979a) he deals with non-indicative utterances;\nand in ‘Adverbs of Action’ (1985a) he takes up the problem\nof adverbial modification. As in Davidson’s analysis of actions\nand events, the notion of logical form plays an important part in his\napproach here – the problem of how to apply a Tarskian truth\ntheory to natural language is shown to depend on providing an analysis\nof the underlying logical form of natural language expressions which\nrenders them in such a way that they fall under the scope of a purely\nextensional approach employing only minimal logical resources. \nThere is, however, another more general problem that affects\nDavidson’s appropriation of Tarski. While Tarski uses the notion\nof sameness of meaning, through the notion of translation, as the\nmeans to provide a definition of truth – one of the requirements\nof Convention T is that the sentence on the right hand side of a\nTarskian T-sentence be a translation of the sentence on the left\n– Davidson aims to use truth to provide an account of meaning.\nBut in that case it seems that he needs some other way to constrain\nthe formation of T-sentences so as to ensure that they do indeed\ndeliver correct specifications of what sentences mean. This problem is\nreadily illustrated by the question of how we are to rule out\nT-sentences of the form “‘Schnee ist weiss’ is true\nif and only if grass is green.” Since the biconditional\n‘if and only if’ ensures only that the sentence named on\nthe left will have the same truth value as the sentence on the right,\nso it would seem to allow us to make any substitution of sentences on\nthe right so long as their truth value is identical to that on the\nleft. In one respect this problem is met by simply insisting on the\nway in which T-sentences must be seen as theorems generated by a\ntheory of meaning that is adequate to the language in question as a\nwhole (see ‘Truth and Meaning’). Since the meaning of\nparticular expressions will not be independent of the meaning of other\nexpressions (in virtue of the commitment to compositionality the\nmeanings of all sentences must be generated on the same finite base),\nso a theory that generates problematic results in respect of one\nexpression can be expected to generate problematic results elsewhere,\nand, in particular, to also generate results that do not meet the\nrequirements of Convention T. This problem can also be seen, however,\nas closely related to another important point of difference between a\nTarskian truth theory and a Davidsonian theory of meaning: a theory of\nmeaning for a natural language must be an empirical theory – it\nis, indeed, a theory that ought to apply to actual linguistic\nbehaviour – and as such it ought to be empirically verifiable.\nSatisfaction of the requirement that a theory of meaning be adequate\nas an empirical theory, and so that it be adequate to the actual\nbehaviour of speakers, will also ensure tighter constraints (if such\nare needed) on the formation of T-sentences. Indeed, Davidson is not\nonly quite explicit in emphasising the empirical character of a theory\nof meaning, but he also offers a detailed account that both explains\nhow such a theory might be developed and specifies the nature of the\nevidence on which it must be based. \nDavidson’s strategy is to embed the formal structure for a\ntheory of meaning (the structure he finds in a Tarskian truth theory)\nwithin a more general theory of interpretation the broad outlines of\nwhich he draws from Quine’s discussion in Word and\nObject (first published in 1960). ‘Radical\ntranslation’ is intended by Quine as an idealisation of the\nproject of translation that will exhibit that project in its purest\nform. Normally the task of the translator is aided by prior linguistic\nknowledge – either of the actual language to be translated or of\nsome related language. Quine envisages a case in which translation of\na language must proceed without any prior linguistic knowledge and\nsolely on the basis of the observed behaviour of the speakers of the\nlanguage in conjunction with observation of the basic perceptual\nstimulations that give rise to that behaviour. Davidson has a broader\nconception of the behavioural evidence available than does Quine (he\nallows that we may, for instance, identify speakers as having the\nattitude of ‘holding true’ with respect to sentences) and,\nin addition, rejects the Quinean insistence on a special role being\ngiven to simple perceptual stimulations. Moreover, since\nDavidson’s interest is more properly semantic than Quine’s\n(Quine sees radical translation as part of a primarily epistemological\ninquiry), while Davidson also views a theory of translation alone as\ninsufficient to ensure understanding of the language it translates\n(the translation may be into a language we do not understand), so the\nnotion of ‘translation’ is replaced in the Davidsonian\naccount with that of ‘interpretation’. Radical\ninterpretation is a matter of interpreting the linguistic\nbehaviour of a speaker ‘from scratch’ and so without\nreliance on any prior knowledge either of the speaker’s beliefs\nor the meanings of the speaker’s utterances. It is intended to\nlay bare the knowledge that is required if linguistic understanding is\nto be possible, but it involves no claims about the possible\ninstantiation of that knowledge in the minds of interpreters (Davidson\nthus makes no commitments about the underlying psychological reality\nof the knowledge that a theory of interpretation makes explicit).  \nThe basic problem that radical interpretation must address is that one\ncannot assign meanings to a speaker’s utterances without knowing\nwhat the speaker believes, while one cannot identify beliefs without\nknowing what the speaker’s utterances mean. It seems that we\nmust provide both a theory of belief and a theory of meaning at one\nand the same time. Davidson claims that the way to achieve this is\nthrough the application of the so-called ‘principle of\ncharity’ (Davidson has also referred to it as the principle of\n‘rational accommodation’) a version of which is also to be\nfound in Quine. In Davidson’s work this principle, which admits\nof various formulations and cannot be rendered in any completely\nprecise form, often appears in terms of the injunction to optimise\nagreement between ourselves and those we interpret, that is, it\ncounsels us to interpret speakers as holding true beliefs (true by our\nlights at least) wherever it is plausible to do (see ‘Radical\nInterpretation’ [1973]). In fact the principle can be seen as\ncombining two notions: a holistic assumption of rationality in belief\n(‘coherence’) and an assumption of causal relatedness\nbetween beliefs – especially perceptual beliefs – and the\nobjects of belief (‘correspondence’) (see ‘Three\nVarieties of Knowledge’ [1991]). The process of interpretation\nturns out to depend on both aspects of the principle. Attributions of\nbelief and assignments of meaning must be consistent with one another\nand with the speaker’s overall behaviour; they must also be\nconsistent with the evidence afforded by our knowledge of the\nspeaker’s environment, since it is the worldly causes of beliefs\nthat must, in the ‘most basic cases’, be taken to be the\nobjects of belief (see ‘A Coherence Theory of Truth and\nKnowledge’ [1983]). Inasmuch as charity is taken to generate\nparticular attributions of belief, so those attributions are, of\ncourse, always defeasible. The principle itself is not so, however,\nsince it remains, on the Davidsonian account, a presupposition of any\ninterpretation whatsoever. Charity is, in this respect, both a\nconstraint and an enabling principle in all interpretation – it\nis more than just a heuristic device to be employed in the opening\nstages of interpretative engagement. \nIf we assume that the speaker’s beliefs, at least in the\nsimplest and most basic cases, are largely in agreement with our own,\nand so, by our account, are largely true, then we can use our own\nbeliefs about the world as a guide to the speaker’s beliefs.\nAnd, provided that we can identify simple assertoric utterances on the\npart of a speaker (that is, provided we can identify the attitude of\nholding true), then the interconnection between belief and meaning\nenables us to use our beliefs as a guide to the\nmeanings of the speaker’s utterances – we get the\nbasis for both a rudimentary theory of belief and a rudimentary\naccount of meaning. So, for example, when the speaker with whom we are\nengaged uses a certain sequence of sounds repeatedly in the presence\nof what we believe to be a rabbit, we can, as a preliminary\nhypothesis, interpret those sounds as utterances about rabbits or\nabout some particular rabbit. Once we have arrived at a preliminary\nassignment of meanings for a significant body of utterances, we can\ntest our assignments against further linguistic behaviour on the part\nof the speaker, modifying those assignments in accordance with the\nresults. Using our developing theory of meaning we are then able to\ntest the initial attributions of belief that were generated through\nthe application of charity, and, where necessary, modify those\nattributions also. This enables us, in turn, to further adjust our\nassignments of meaning, which enables further adjustment in the\nattribution of beliefs, … and so the process continues until\nsome sort of equilibrium is reached. The development of a more finely\ntuned theory of belief thus allows us to better adjust our theory of\nmeaning, while the adjustment of our theory of meaning in turn enables\nus to better tune our theory of belief. Through balancing attributions\nof belief against assignments of meaning, we are able to move towards\nan overall theory of behaviour for a speaker or speakers that combines\nboth a theory of meaning and of belief within a single theory of\ninterpretation. \nSince it is indeed a single, combined theory that is the aim here, so\nthe adequacy of any such theory must be measured in terms of the\nextent to which the theory does indeed provide a unified view of the\ntotality of behavioural evidence available to us (taken in conjunction\nwith our own beliefs about the world) rather than by reference to any\nsingle item of behaviour. This can be viewed as a more general version\nof the same requirement, made in relation to a formal theory of\nmeaning, that a theory of meaning for a language address the totality\nof utterances for that language, although, in the context of radical\ninterpretation, this requirement must be understood as also closely\ntied to the need to attend to normative considerations of overall\nrationality. A direct consequence of this holistic approach is that\nthere will always be more than one theory of interpretation that will\nbe adequate to any particular body of evidence since theories may\ndiffer in particular attributions of belief or assignments of meaning\nwhile nevertheless providing an equally satisfactory account of the\nspeaker’s overall behaviour. It is this failure of uniqueness\nthat Davidson terms the ‘indeterminacy’ of interpretation\nand which provides a counterpart to the ‘indeterminacy of\ntranslation’ that also appears, though it has a more limited\napplication, in Quine. On the Davidsonian account, while such\nindeterminacy often goes unnoticed and is indeed rather less for\nDavidson than for Quine (partly as a consequence of Davidson’s\nemployment of Tarski and so of the need to read the structure of\nfirst-order logic into the language interpreted), it nevertheless\nremains an ineliminable feature of all interpretation. Moreover,\nindeterminacy is not to be viewed merely as reflecting some\nepistemological limitation on interpretation, but rather reflects the\nholistic character of meaning and of belief. Such concepts refer us to\noverall patterns in the behaviour of speakers rather than to discrete,\nentities to which interpretation must somehow gain access. Indeed,\nholism of this sort applies, not only to meanings and beliefs, but\nalso to the so-called ‘propositional attitudes’ in\ngeneral. The latter are most simply characterised as attitudes\nspecifiable by reference to a proposition (believing that there is\neggplant for dinner is a matter of holding true the proposition that\nthere is eggplant for dinner; desiring that there be eggplant for\ndinner is a matter of wanting it to be true that there be eggplant for\ndinner) and so the contents of attitudes of this sort are\nalways propositional. Davidsonian holism is thus a holism\nthat applies to meanings, to attitudes, and also, thereby, to the\ncontent of attitudes. Indeed, we can speak of the Davidsonian account\nof interpretation as providing a quite general account of how mental\ncontent is determined (such content being understood as the content of\npropositional mental states such as belief): through the causal\nrelation between speakers and objects in the world and through the\nrational integration of speakers’ behaviour. Thus, as\nDavidson’s approach to the theory of meaning turns out to imply\na more general theory of interpretation, so his holistic view of\nmeaning implies a holistic view of the mental, and of mental content,\nin general.  \nDavidson’s commitment to the indeterminacy that follows from his\nholistic approach has lead some to view his position as involving a\nform of anti-realism about the mind and about beliefs, desires and so\nforth. Davidson argues, however, that the indeterminacy of\ninterpretation should be understood analogously with the indeterminacy\nthat attaches to measurement. Such theories assign numerical values to\nobjects on the basis of empirically observable phenomena and in\naccordance with certain formal theoretical constraints. Where there\nexist different theories that address the same phenomena, each theory\nmay assign different numerical values to the objects at issue (as do\nCelsius and Fahrenheit in the measurement of temperature), and yet\nthere need be no difference in the empirical adequacy of those\ntheories, since what is significant is the overall pattern of\nassignments rather than the value assigned in any particular case.\nSimilarly in interpretation, it is the overall pattern that a theory\nfinds in behaviour that is significant and that remains invariant\nbetween different, but equally adequate, theories. An account of\nmeaning for a language is an account of just this pattern. \nAlthough the indeterminacy thesis has sometimes been a focus for\nobjections to Davidson’s approach, it is the more basic thesis\nof holism as developed in its full-blown form in the account of\nradical interpretation (and particularly as it relates to meaning)\nthat has often attracted the most direct and trenchant criticism.\nMichael Dummett has been one of the most important critics of the\nDavidsonian position (see especially Dummett 1975). Dummett argues\nthat Davidson’s commitment to holism not only gives rise to\nproblems concerning, for instance, how a language can be learnt (since\nit seems to require that one come to understand the whole of the\nlanguage at one go, whereas learning is always piecemeal), but that it\nalso restricts Davidson from being able to give what Dummett views as\na properly full-blooded account of the nature of linguistic\nunderstanding (since it means that Davidson cannot provide an account\nthat explicates the semantic in terms of the non-semantic). More\nrecent criticisms have come from Jerry Fodor, amongst others, whose\nopposition to holism (not only in Davidson, but in Quine, Dennett and\nelsewhere) is largely motivated by a desire to defend the possibility\nof a certain scientific approach to the mind (see especially, Fodor\nand Lepore 1992). \nThe heart of a Davidsonian theory of interpretation is, of course, a\nTarskian truth theory. But a truth theory provides only the formal\nstructure on which linguistic interpretation is based: such a theory\nneeds to be embedded within a broader approach that looks to the\ninterconnections between utterances, other behaviour and attitudes; in\naddition, the application of such a theory to actual linguistic\nbehaviour must also take account of the dynamic and shifting character\nof such behaviour. This latter point is easily overlooked, but it\nleads Davidson to some important conclusions. Ordinary speech is full\nof ungrammatical constructions (constructions that may even be\nacknowledged to be ungrammatical by the speaker herself), incomplete\nsentences or phrases, metaphors, neologisms, jokes, puns and all\nmanner of phenomena that cannot be met simply by the application to\nutterances of a pre-existing theory for the language being spoken.\nLinguistic understanding cannot, then, be a matter simply of the\nmechanical application of a Tarski-like theory (although this is just\nwhat Davidson might be taken to suggest in the early essays). In\npapers such as ‘A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs’ (1986),\nDavidson addresses just this point, arguing that while linguistic\nunderstanding does indeed depend upon a grasp of the formal structure\nof a language, that structure always stands in need of modification in\nthe light of actual linguistic behaviour. Understanding a language is\na matter of continually adjusting interpretative presuppositions\n(presuppositions that are often not explicit) in accord with the\nutterances to be interpreted. Furthermore, this calls upon skills and\nknowledge (imagination, attentiveness to the attitudes and behaviour\nof others, knowledge of the world) that are not specifically\nlinguistic and that are part of a more general ability to get on in\nthe world and in relation to others – an ability that also\nresists any formal explication. In ‘A Nice Derangement of\nEpitaphs’, Davidson puts this point, in provocative fashion, by\nclaiming that ‘there is no such thing as a language’\n(adding the immediate qualification ‘not if a language is\nanything like what many philosophers and linguists have\nsupposed’). Put less provocatively, the essential point is that\nlinguistic conventions (and in particular linguistic conventions that\ntake the form of agreement over the employment of shared syntactic and\nsemantic rules), while they may well facilitate understanding, cannot\nbe the basis for such understanding.  \nDavidson’s denial of rule-based conventions as having a founding\nrole in linguistic understanding, together with his emphasis on the\nway in which the capacity for linguistic understanding must be seen as\npart as part of a more general set of capacities for getting on in the\nworld, underlie Davidson’s much-discussed account of metaphor\nand related features of language (see ‘What Metaphors\nMean’ [1978b]). Davidson rejects the idea that metaphorical\nlanguage can be explained by reference to any set of rules that govern\nsuch meaning. Instead it depends on using sentences with their\n‘literal’ or standard meanings in ways that give rise to\nnew or unexpected insights – and just as there are no rules by\nwhich we can work out what a speaker means when she utters an\nungrammatical sentence, makes a pun or otherwise uses language in a\nway that diverges from the norm, so there are no rules that govern the\ngrasp of metaphor. \nIn Davidson’s work the question ‘what is meaning?’\nis replaced by the question ‘What would a speaker need to know\nto understand the utterances of another?’ The result is an\naccount that treats the theory of meaning as necessarily part of a\nmuch broader theory of interpretation and, indeed, of a much broader\napproach to the mental as such. This account is holistic inasmuch as\nit requires that any adequate theory must address linguistic and\nnon-linguistic behaviour in its entirety. As we have already seen,\nthis means that a theory of interpretation must adopt a compositional\napproach to the analysis of meaning; it must recognise the\ninterconnected character of attitudes and of attitudes and behaviour;\nand it must also attribute attitudes and interpret behaviour in a way\nconstrained by normative principles of rationality. Rationality is\nnot, however, the only principle on which Davidson’s account of\nradical interpretation depends. It involves, in fact, a marriage of\nboth holistic and ‘externalist’ considerations:\nconsiderations concerning the dependence of attitudinal content on the\nrational connections between attitudes (‘holism’) and\nconcerning the dependence of such content on the causal connections\nbetween attitudes and objects in the world\n(‘externalism’). Indeed, this marriage is evident, as we\nsaw earlier, in the principle of charity itself and its combination of\nconsiderations of both ‘coherence’ and\n‘correspondence’. Davidson holds, in fact, that attitudes\ncan be attributed, and so attitudinal content determined, only on the\nbasis of a triangular structure that requires interaction between at\nleast two creatures as well as interaction between each creature and a\nset of common objects in the world.  \nIdentifying the content of attitudes is a matter of identifying the\nobjects of those attitudes, and, in the most basic cases, the objects\nof attitudes are identical with the causes of those same attitudes (as\nthe cause of my belief that there is a bird outside my window is the\nbird outside my window). Identifying beliefs involves a process\nanalogous to that of ‘triangulation’ (as employed in\ntopographical surveying and in the fixing of location) whereby the\nposition of an object (or some location or topographical feature) is\ndetermined by taking a line from each of two already known locations\nto the object in question – the intersection of the lines fixes\nthe position of the object (this idea first appears in ‘Rational\nAnimals [1982]). Similarly, the objects of propositional attitudes are\nfixed by looking to find objects that are the common causes, and so\nthe common objects, of the attitudes of two or more speakers who are\ncapable of observing and responding to one another’s behaviour.\nIn ‘Three Varieties of Knowledge’, Davidson develops the\nidea of triangulation as a means to elaborate the three-way conceptual\ninterdependence that he argues obtains between knowledge of oneself,\nknowledge of others and knowledge of the world. Just as knowledge of\nlanguage cannot be separated from our more general knowledge of the\nworld, so Davidson argues that knowledge of oneself, knowledge of\nother persons and knowledge of a common, ‘objective’ world\nform an interdependent set of concepts no one of which is possible in\nthe absence of the others.  \nThe idea of triangulation has important implications that go far\nbeyond questions of knowledge alone, and the idea is one of the most\nimportant and enduring, but also controversial elements in\nDavidson’s later thinking (see Myers and Verheggen, 2016).\nMoreover, although the idea may appear at first sight to be intended\npurely as a metaphor, the structure of triangulation seems actually to\ndirect attention to the way in which knowledge, action, and content\nare fundamentally dependent on the genuinely embodied and located\ncharacter of speakers and agents. As Davidson presents matters, it is\nonly through their concrete engagement in the world, in relation both\nto objects and to other speakers or agents, that any speaker or agent\ncan be capable of genuine speaking or agency - that any speaker or\nagent can be such that they can have thoughts or be capable of action.\n \nThe emphasis on the holistic and externalist character of knowledge\nand of content that is so central to triangulation is also expressed\nin Davidson’s well-known ‘Swampman’ example (in\n‘Knowing One’s own Mind’, Davidson 1987:\n443–4) Here we are asked to imagine a situation in which a\nlightning strike in a swamp reduces Davidson’s body to its basic\nelements, while simultaneously transforming a nearby dead tree into an\nexact replica of him. Although the resulting ‘Swampman’\nbehaves exactly like the original author of ‘Radical\nInterpretation’, Davidson denies that the ‘Swampman’\ncould properly be said to have thoughts or its words have meaning\n– and the reason is simply that the Swampman would lack the sort\nof causal history that is required in order to establish the right\nconnections between itself, others and the world that underpin the\nattribution of thought and meaning. For all its notoriety, however,\nthe Swampman example is not elaborated upon by Davidson, and the\nexample has a very limited usefulness. In this respect, the attention\nSwampman has generated is quite disproportionate to his extremely\nbrief appearance in Davidson’s writing. \nAlthough it is not simply an epistemological notion, the way Davidson\npresents the idea of triangulation tends to be such as to bring its\nepistemological implications to the fore. This is especially true of\nthe way Davidson develops the idea in ‘Three Varieties of\nKnowledge’. Since our knowledge of our own minds is not\nindependent of our knowledge of the world nor of our knowledge of\nothers, so we cannot treat self-knowledge as a matter of our having\naccess to some set of private ‘mental’ objects. Our\nknowledge of ourselves arises only in relation to our involvement with\nothers and with respect to a publically accessible world – as\nwell as a history of such involvement (this is indeed part of the\npoint of the Swampman example). Even so, we retain a certain authority\nover our own attitudes and utterances simply in virtue of the fact\nthat those attitudes and utterances are indeed our own (see\n‘First-Person Authority’, [1984]). Moreover, because our\nknowledge of the world is inseparable from other forms of knowledge,\nglobal epistemological scepticism – the view that all or most of\nour beliefs about the world could be false – turns out to be\ncommitted to much more than is usually supposed. Should it indeed turn\nout that our beliefs about the world were all, or for the most part,\nfalse, then this would not only imply the falsity of most of our\nbeliefs about others, but it would also have the peculiar consequence\nof making false most of our beliefs about ourselves – including\nthe supposition that we do indeed hold those particular false beliefs.\nAlthough this may fall short of demonstrating the falsity of such\nscepticism, it surely demonstrates it to be deeply problematic.  \nThe way in which the Davidsonian rejection of scepticism does indeed\nderive quite directly from Davidson’s adoption of a holistic,\nexternalist approach to knowledge, and to attitudinal content in\ngeneral, has sometimes been obscured by Davidson’s presentation\nof his argument against scepticism through the employment (for the\nfirst time in ‘Thought and Talk’[1975]) of the rather\nproblematic notion of an ‘omniscient interpreter’. Such an\ninterpreter would attribute beliefs to others and assign meanings to\ntheir utterances, but would nevertheless do so on the basis of his\nown, true, beliefs. The omniscient interpreter would therefore have to\nfind a large amount of agreement between his own beliefs and the\nbeliefs of those he interprets – and what was agreed would also,\nby hypothesis, be true. Like the Swampman example, however, the\nomniscient interpreter example has given rise to a number of\ncomplications and misunderstandings (so much so that Davidson has\nexpressed regret at ever having deployed those examples in the first\nplace) – and although the omniscient interpreter appears at a\nnumber of places in Davidson’s writings, the idea does not\nappear in his later discussions, but is instead replaced by the notion\nof triangulation. \nA feature of both the triangulation argument, and the Davidsonian\naccount of radical interpretation, is that the attribution of\nattitudes must always proceed in tandem with the interpretation of\nutterances – identifying content, whether of utterances or of\nattitudes, is indeed a single project. An inability to interpret\nutterances (that is, an inability to assign meanings to instances of\nputative linguistic behaviour) will thereby imply an inability to\nattribute attitudes (and vice versa). A creature that we cannot\ninterpret as capable of meaningful speech will thus also be a creature\nthat we cannot interpret as capable of possessing contentful\nattitudes. Such considerations lead Davidson to deny that\nnon-linguistic animals are capable of thought – where thought\ninvolves the possession of propositional attitudes such as beliefs or\ndesires (see especially ‘Thought and Talk’). This does not\nmean that such animals have no mental life at all, nor does it mean\nthat we cannot usefully use mental concepts in explaining and\npredicting the behaviour of such creatures. What it does mean,\nhowever, is that the extent to which we can think of such creatures as\nhaving attitudes and a mental life like our own is measured by the\nextent to which we can assign determinate propositional content to the\nattitudes we would ascribe to those creatures. A further consequence\nof this view is that the idea of an untranslatable language – an\nidea often found in association with the thesis of conceptual\nrelativism – cannot be given any coherent formulation. Inability\nto translate counts as evidence, not of the existence of an\nuntranslatable language, but of the absence of a language of any sort\n(see ‘On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme’ [1974]) \nDavidson’s rejection of the idea of an untranslatable language\n(and the associated idea, also common to many forms of conceptual\nrelativism, of a radically different, and so\n‘incommensurable’ system of belief) is part of a more\ngeneral argument that he advances (notably in ‘On the Very Idea\nof a Conceptual Scheme’) against the so-called ‘third\ndogma’ of empiricism. The first two dogmas are those famously\nidentified by Quine in ‘Two Dogmas of Empiricism’ (first\npublished in the Philosophical Review, in 1951). The first is\nthat of reductionism (the idea that, for any meaningful statement, it\ncan be recast in the language of pure sensory experience, or, at\nleast, in terms of a set of confirmatory instances), while the second\nis the analytic-synthetic distinction (the idea that, with respect to\nall meaningful statements, one can distinguish between statements that\nare true in virtue of their meaning and those that are true in virtue\nof both their meanings and some fact or facts about the world). The\nrejection of both these dogmas can be seen as an important element\nthroughout Davidson’s thinking. The third dogma, which Davidson\nclaims can still be discerned in Quine’s work (and so can\nsurvive the rejection even of the analytic-synthetic distinction),\nconsists in the idea that one can distinguish within knowledge or\nexperience between a conceptual component (the ‘conceptual\nscheme’) and an empirical component (the ‘empirical\ncontent’) – the former is often taken to derive from\nlanguage and the later from experience, nature or some form of\n‘sensory input’. While there are difficulties in even\narriving at a clear formulation of this distinction (particularly so\nfar as the nature of the relation between the two components is\nconcerned), such a distinction depends on being able to distinguish,\nat some basic level, between a ‘subjective’ contribution\nto knowledge that comes from ourselves and an ‘objective’\ncontribution that comes from the world. What the Davidsonian account\nof knowledge and interpretation demonstrates, however, is that no such\ndistinction can be drawn. Attitudes are already interconnected –\ncausally, semantically and epistemically – with objects and\nevents in the world; while knowledge of self and others already\npresupposes knowledge of the world. The very idea of a conceptual\nscheme is thus rejected by Davidson along with the idea of any strong\nform of conceptual relativism. To possess attitudes and be capable of\nspeech is already to be capable of interpreting others and to be open\nto interpretation by them.  \nDavidson emphasizes the holistic character of the mental (both in\nterms of the interdependence that obtains between various forms of\nknowledge as well as the interconnected character of attitudes and of\nattitudes and behaviour). He has, at times, also referred to his\nposition as involving a ‘coherence’ theory of truth and of\nknowledge (in ‘A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge’\n[1983]). Nevertheless, Davidson is not a coherentist, in any standard\nsense, about either truth or knowledge. Nor, for all that he adopts a\nTarskian approach to meaning, does he espouse a correspondence theory\nof truth (in fact, he denies that a Tarskian truth theory is a\ncorrespondence theory in any conventional sense). In general, Davidson\neschews the attempt to provide an account of the nature of truth,\nmaintaining that truth is an absolutely central concept that cannot be\nreduced to or replaced by any other notion (see [Davidson 1990a] and\n[Davidson 2005b]). Since he takes truth to belong to sentences or\nstatements, and not to ‘propositions’ in any\nphilosophically significant sense (in Truth and Predication\n[2005b], he is particularly emphatic in rejecting the idea of the\nproposition as a theoretical or explanatory concept), Davidson denies\nthat truths can be understood as timeless or eternal (or at least they\nare no more so than are languages or sentences themselves). The only\nway of defining truth, as Davidson sees it, is by means of a Tarskian\ntruth theory and such a theory is not a definition of truth in any\nunqualified sense, but only a definition of the truth predicate as it\napplies within a particular language. \nDavidson’s employment of the notion of coherence is best viewed,\nnot as a way of understanding truth, but rather as reflecting his\ncommitment to the fundamentally rational and holistic character of the\nmind. It also connects with Davidson’s rejection of those forms\nof epistemological foundationalism that would attempt to ground\nknowledge or belief in the sensory causes of belief – beliefs,\nas one might expect given Davidson’s holistic approach, can find\nevidential support only in other beliefs. Similarly, Davidson’s\nsometime employment of the notion of correspondence is best\nunderstood, not as providing, any direct elucidation of the nature of\ntruth, but rather as deriving from his externalist commitment to the\nidea that the content of belief is dependent upon the worldly causes\nof belief. In ‘True to the Facts’ (1969b) Davidson does\ndefend what he there presents as a form of correspondence theory of\ntruth. However, not only does Davidson later relinquish the claim that\nhis is a ‘correspondence’ view of truth (this is already\nevident in ‘The Structure and Content of Truth’ [1990a],\nmuch of the material from which was later incorporated into Truth\nand Predication [2005b]), but the account set out in ‘True\nto the Facts’ is, in any case, far removed from what is usually\ntaken to be involved in any correspondence theory.  \nThe strategy that Davidson employs in relation to the concept of truth\nreflects a more general approach that runs throughout his thinking.\nRather than trying to reduce key concepts, like truth, to something\nelse, his tendency is to retain the primitive character of those\nconcepts and instead to look to how they are worked out within the\nlarger structure to which they belong (in this respect, Davidson is a\nmoderate ‘deflationist’ about most of his key concepts).\nThe strategy Davidson adopts in respect of truth is therefore much the\nsame strategy as that which he adopts with respect to meaning (which\nshould not surprise us given the role Tarski plays): meaning belongs\nprimarily to sentences, it is not reducible to any other notion, and\nit is explicated only by reference to a larger linguistic structure.\nMoreover, this strategy is also one Davidson applies to the topic that\noccupies a large part of his last work – his inquiry into the\nproblem of the problem of predication or of the unity of the\nproposition (2005b). How are we to elucidate the relation between a\nsubject and that which is predicated of it in a standard predicative\nsentence such as ‘Socrates is mortal’? The problem, like\nthe problem that arises when one tries to use the truth predicate\nreflexively, is that any attempt to explicate the predicative relation\nseems to give rise to circularity or regress. Davidson’s\nsolution is to deny that predication can be explained by resort to any\nprior notion of propositionality. Instead Davidson takes predication\nas basic, irreducible, and able to be explicated only through the sort\nof structure that is revealed by a Tarski-style theory of meaning.\n \nThe question of truth lies at the heart of the realist/anti-realist\ncontroversy that was once a major concern of many Anglo-American\nphilosophers. Despite his insistence on the indispensability of an\nirreducibly basic concept of objective truth, and his rejection of\nboth sceptical and relativist positions, Davidson has been variously\nassimilated, at different times and by different critics, to both the\nrealist and the anti-realist camps. Yet realism and anti-realism are\nequally unsatisfactory from a Davidsonian point of view, since neither\nis compatible with the holistic and externalist character of knowledge\nand belief. Realism makes truth inaccessible (inasmuch as it admits\nthe sceptical possibility that even our best-confirmed theories about\nthe world could all be false), while anti-realism makes truth too\nepistemic (inasmuch as it rejects the idea of truth as objective). In\nthis respect, and as he himself makes clear (see 1990a, 2005b),\nDavidson does not merely reject the specific premises that underlie\nthe realist and anti-realist positions, but views the very dispute\nbetween them as essentially misconceived. This reflects a\ncharacteristic feature of Davidson’s thinking in general (and\nnot just as it relates to realism and anti-realism), namely its\nresistance to any simple classification using the standard\nphilosophical categories of the day.
