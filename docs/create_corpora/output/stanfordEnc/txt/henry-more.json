Certainly, More’s\ndualistic theology of body and soul was heavily indebted to\nNeoplatonic thought, but the philosophical theology which he developed\nthrough the 1650s and 1660s should be recognised as almost entirely\nidiosyncratic, even though, in some respects it was closely paralleled\nin the philosophy and theology of his friend and colleague, Ralph\nCudworth (1617–1688), and to a lesser extent in the works of his\nfollowers, George Rust (c.1628–1670) and Joseph\nGlanvill (1636–1680). More is notable as a rationalist\ntheologian who tried to use the details of the mechanical philosophy,\nas developed by René Descartes, Robert Boyle and others, to\nestablish the existence of immaterial substance, or spirit and,\ntherefore, God. In particular he is known for developing a concept of\na Spirit of Nature, an intermediary between God and the world which\nwas supposedly required to account for those physical phenomena which\ncould not be explained by the mechanical philosophy, and a concept of\nan infinite absolute space which was also made to represent immaterial\nreality, and even to share a number of the attributes of God.\n\nBorn in Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 12 October 1614, More was the\nseventh son of Alexander More, sometime alderman and mayor of\nGrantham, and his wife, Anne (née Lacy). After initial\nschooling at Grantham grammar school, he was sent to Eton College in\n1628. In 1631, his uncle, Gabriel More, who was a fellow at\nChrist’s College, Cambridge, arranged for Henry to enter his\ncollege. This was to be the setting for the rest of More’s life.\nHe took a BA in 1636, the MA in 1639, and was made a fellow of the\ncollege in 1641. More had already begun to familiarise himself with\nNeoplatonic philosophy during his undergraduate years, and began to\ndevelop his own dualistic ideas, emphasising the immateriality of the\nsoul, in philosophical poems approximating to the mode of Edmund\nSpenser’s Faerie Queen (1590), which he wrote in 1639\nand 1640. He ventured into print with the first of these, the\nPsychodia Platonica (“Platonic Song of the Soul”)\nin 1642 (Crocker 2003). \nIt seems clear that from very early on More developed ambitions to\npromote his own understanding of true Christianity. Indeed, if his\nautobiographical memoir, written as a preface to his Opera\nomnia of 1679, is to be believed, More began to develop his own\nideas as a result of a schoolboy rejection of the Calvinist doctrine\nof predestination, which he saw as a morally indefensible position for\nGod to uphold, and therefore could not be part of true religion\n(translated into English in Ward 2000, 15–16; for a later\nexample of More’s anti-Calvinism, see More 1668, 71–78).\nThis recollection is certainly revealing, not only about More’s\nbeliefs, but also about his whole approach to religion. Like Calvin\nhimself, More wanted to establish a system of belief which conformed\nto what he saw as the dictates of reason. But reasoning from different\nstarting points can lead to very different conclusions. Calvin wanted\na God who was immutable and so the concept of predestination seemed to\nfollow as a rational requirement. More, by contrast, wanted a God who\nwas, above all, morally perfect and unimpeachable. His different\nstarting point from that of Calvin led him to a very different\nrational theology. More’s was a theology in which God was\nobliged by his goodness to conform to absolute standards of morality,\nand therefore to create a world which was, as Voltaire’s\n(1694–1778) Dr Pangloss would have said, the best of all\npossible worlds (Voltaire [1759] 1966, 2). More’s motive in\npromoting this theology was not to solve the so-called “problem\nof evil” (why God allows so much suffering in the world), as it\nwas later for Leibniz (and Dr Pangloss), but to ensure that God\ncreated a world which was (according to More at least) most capable of\nestablishing the Creator’s own existence. More believed that the\nbest of all possible worlds was one which demonstrated its dependence\nupon God and thereby made atheism an untenable position. In his\nImmortality of the Soul (1659), for example, More wrote that\nGod “ordering the natures of things infallibly according to what\nis best, must of necessity ordain that the Souls of men live\nand act after death” (More 1662, Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 144). Similarly, in Divine\nDialogues (1668), he wrote that the design in nature showed that\nGod always acted for the best (More 1668, 24). It was the effort to\ndemonstrate that God had indeed created the world this way which\ndictated all the various idiosyncrasies of More’s philosophical\ntheology. \nThe earliest aspect of this was the attempt in his philosophical poems\nto establish a strict categorical separation between body and the\nincorporeal soul. The Psychodia platonica consisted of four\nparts, the first two, on the life of the soul (Psychozoia)\nand on its immortality (Pyschathanasia), presented\nMore’s views. The third and fourth parts were refutations of\ncontemporary views of the soul which threatened More’s strict\ndualistic ontology. Antipsychopannychia was concerned to\nreject the belief of the so-called mortalists that the soul sleeps in\nthe grave after death, only to be awoken at the same time as the\nresurrection of the body. Antimonopsychia rejected the\nnotion, usually attributed to the Arabic commentator on Aristotle know\nto the Latin West as Averroes (Ibn-Rushd), that the only tenable\nnotion of the soul in Aristotle was not a personal soul, but a single\ngeneral soul of humanity. Originally introduced into the West by a\nnumber of anti-Scholastic Aristotelian naturalists (from Siger of\nBrabant in the thirteenth century to Pietro Pomponazzi in the\nsixteenth) this idea was again becoming current among atheistic\ncontemporaries of More (Leech 2013). \nMore followed this up with what he called an essay, but which was\nstill written in sub-Spenserian stanzas, on “the Infinity of\nWorlds out of Platonick Principles”. Democritus\nPlatonissans (1646), accordingly, is the part of More’s\nphilosophical poem cycle which deals with the material side of the\ndualist dichotomy. He may have been inspired here by the Two\nTreatises of Sir Kenelm Digby (1603–1665) which had just\nappeared (1644), and which he mentions in the notes to his poem. Digby\ndeveloped a version of atomistic natural philosophy and argued that\nall change is nothing more or less than a re-arrangement of the\nmaterial atoms comprising all bodies. Consequently, Digby went on to\nargue, immaterial souls cannot change, and must therefore be immutable\nand immortal (Digby 1644, 350). More used the same general stratagem\nwith regard to the relationship between body and soul in his poem, and\nit was presumably during the writing of Democritus\nPlatonissans that More first became interested in the latest\ndevelopments in natural philosophy (Thomson 2008, 94). In particular,\nit was at this time that More began to study the philosophy of\nDescartes (1596–1650) (Gabbey 1982). Clearly, More was\nsufficiently aware of developments in natural philosophy to know that\nDigby’s atomistic system was derivative from, and by no means as\npowerful as, the Principia philosophiae published in the same\nyear as Digby’s Two Treatises by the great French\nmathematician turned metaphysician and physicist. \nAt around this time, More also began to embrace another Platonic idea,\nand one which had been introduced into Christian thought in the third\ncentury by Origen (though never accepted as orthodox), namely the\npre-existence of the individual soul before its incarnation (Reid\n2012, Hengstermann 2017). He devoted another poem to his first\nexposition of this, The Praeexistency of the Soul, which was\nincluded in his collected Philosophical Poems of 1647. This\nis a clear example of how More’s pursuit of a rational theology\nled him to unusual, if not entirely idiosyncratic, positions. His\nPlatonic insistence on the immortality of the soul led him to reject\nthe notion that every individual human soul was created at its\nconception, in favour of the Origenian position that all intellectual\nnatures were created equal and alike from the beginning of eternity\n(Scott 1991). This was also bound up with More’s concern for the\nperfect goodness of God—More did not want to involve God in\ncolluding with the illicit sexual acts of sinners by intervening in\ntheir acts to create souls for their illegitimate progeny. As More\nlater put it in the notes to his edition of George Rust’s\nOrigenian Discourse of Truth (1682), God must not be made to\n“bear a part amongst Pimps and Bawds, and pocky whores and\nWhoremasters, to rise out of his Seat for them, and by a free Act of\nCreation of a Soul, to set his seal of connivance to their\nVillanies” (More 1682, 9). Although More adopted the\npre-existence of souls, he did not embrace Origen’s belief in\nuniversal salvation —the idea that all souls would eventually be\nsaved and rewarded with heavenly bliss. Evidently, More took this\ndoctrine to undermine God’s justice, and affirmed eternal\npunishment for sinners (Hengstermann 2017). \nThe decision to present and to defend what purported to be a\nrationally-based pneumatology in poetic form is certainly puzzling to\nthe modern reader, but it was also rather unusual in More’s own\nday. Although there were clear ancient precedents, such as the epic\npresentation of Epicurean atomism in the De rerum natura of\nLucretius, the poetical presentation of philosophical ideas seemed to\nbe most common in alchemical, astrological, and other magical works,\nsuch as the Compound of Alchymy by George Ripley (c.\n1471), and the Zodiacus vitae of Marcellus Palingenius\n(c. 1531). It seems that More’s determination to\npresent his ideas in verse is a manifestation of an undeniable\ntendency in him towards emotional rapture, particularly where matters\nof religion are concerned. Although intellectually committed to\nrationalism in religion, More’s personal religious feelings were\nobviously deep-seated and could easily become highly emotional, and\neven close to what was decried at the time as a dangerous tendency in\nreligion, namely “enthusiasm”. This was noted by\nMore’s earliest biographer, Richard Ward: \nFor the most part, More did manage to subdue these potentially\ndangerous tendencies, but he often walked a razor’s edge\n(Crocker 1990, 2003). It seems clear that More was torn between what\nhe saw as the need for a rational theology on the one hand and a much\nmore emotional submission to religious sensibilities. As Ward wrote\napprovingly: \nThis aspect of More’s mental life must be borne in mind in any\nattempt to assess the coherence of his philosophy, and his\nsignificance as a philosopher. It was surely the demands of\nMore’s religious concerns which account for those places (some\nof which will be discussed below) where his philosophical acuity\nseemed to desert him. \nMore can be seen to be walking along a narrow ledge above a precipice\nof religious enthusiasm in his polemic against the alchemist Thomas\nVaughan (1621–1666). Writing as Alazonomastix Philalethes, More\nlaunched an attack against Vaughan’s recently published\nNeoplatonic and alchemically inspired views of man and nature. These\nwere More’s first publications after finishing his cycle of\npoems. More felt obliged to attack Vaughan in print precisely because,\nto the undiscerning eye, their philosophies might seem to be\ncongruent. As More wrote: \nAlthough More professes to subscribe to a philosophy which is\nsignificantly distinct from that of Vaughan, it is by no means clear\nthat contemporary readers would have been able to see what the\ndifferences were. With hindsight, it can be seen that in these two\npolemical works More was trying to protect the concept which he had\nvery briefly introduced in his poetical works and which was to prove\nso important in his subsequent philosophy, namely the Spirit of Nature\n(discussed fully below). What is most obvious here, however, is not\nhow More conceived of this universal spirit, but that he did not see\nit in the same way that Vaughan did in his Anima magica\nabscondita: Or, A Discourse of the universall Spirit of Nature\n(1650). He objects unequivocally, for example, to the fact that\nVaughan seems to imply (on More’s reading, anyway) that a\nuniversal world spirit or soul is divided and parcelled up into all\ncreatures, to give them life. More objects not only to Vaughan’s\nsuggestion that the whole world is “an Animal”, but also\nto the idea that the world soul can be “either barrel’d up\nor bottled up, or tied up in a bag, as a pig in a poke!” (More\n1650, 51). More’s objection, reflecting his strict dualism, is\nthat an immaterial soul could not be trapped inside body. When More\nsubsequently develops his own concept of the Spirit of Nature into its\nmature form it is to be a continuous and all pervasive immaterial (but\nextended) substance which is capable of operating within bodies by\nvirtue of its ubiquity, but is not confined by them. The contemporary\nreader, however, could not have gleaned from More’s\nObservations upon Anthroposophia Theomagica (1650), or his\nSecond Lash of Alazonomastix (1651), anything other than his\nobjections to Vaughan’s views; there was little or no intimation\nof More’s own still developing ideas. \nFurthermore, even here, while vigorously decrying Vaughan’s\n“enthusiasm”, More cannot prevent himself from revealing\nhis own tendencies in the same direction (Crocker 1990, 2003,\nGuinsberg 1980). The real nature of the union between soul and body,\nMore at one point unwisely declared, is “more Theomagicall then\nour Theomagician himself is aware of” (More 1650, 52). It is a\nsign of the tension between More’s rationalism and his need to\nexpress his religious devotion that he persisted in writing\nenthusiastically even when he was aware of so doing. His apologetic\nattempts to defend himself were hardly convincing: “Nor am I at\nall, Philalethes, Enthusiastical. For God doth not ride me as a Horse,\nand guide me I know not whither my self; but converseth with me as a\nFriend; and speaks to me in such a Dialect as I\nunderstand…” (More 1651, 178). \nMore read Descartes’s Principia philosophiae in 1646,\nand it had a very profound effect upon him and upon the subsequent\ndevelopment of his own philosophy. “All that have attempted\nanything in naturall Philosophy hitherto are mere shrimps and fumblers\nin comparison of him”, More wrote in 1648 (Letter to Hartlib, 11\nDecember 1648, Webster 1969, 365). Accordingly, he began to teach\nDescartes’s mechanical philosophy to interested students in\nCambridge, and so became one of the earliest conduits for the\ndissemination of Cartesianism in Britain. More is credited with\ninventing the word, Cartesianism, and has been said to be behind the\nstrangely Platonic reading of Descartes’s methodology in the\nanonymous preface to the first English translation of the\nDiscourse of a Method (1649) (Cristofolini 1974). In his\nlater writings, however, More is much more critical of this new\nphilosophy. It used to be assumed that More began as a follower of\nDescartes and became more critical of his philosophy as his own\nphilosophy matured. It is now recognised, however, that More was\nalways critical of certain aspects of Cartesianism, and that the\nincreasingly negative attitude towards Cartesianism reflects a growing\nrealisation that Descartes’s errors (as More saw them) were not\nsimply infelicities, which might be corrected by philosophical\nnegotiation, but were defining characteristics of Cartesianism,\nparticularly as the philosophy was developed by his followers, after\nDescartes’s own untimely death (Gabbey 1982, 1990; Reid 2012,\n2018; Leech 2013). \nThere is an interesting contrast here with More’s response to\nVaughan. More was immediately aware that, although he and Vaughan\nmight seem to be fellow-travellers, their philosophies—and their\nunderlying beliefs—were in fact very different. In the case of\nDescartes, however, More seems to have genuinely believed they were\nfellow-travellers, both committed to the establishment of a dualism of\nbody and soul in the service of religion, even though they might seem\nto onlookers to have been very different. More expressed this in 1662\nin the Preface to his Collection of Philosophical\nWritings: \nRight from his first acquaintance with Descartes’s philosophy,\ntherefore, More believed that, like him, Descartes supposed that\nexplanations of physical phenomena in terms of material principles\ncould only take us so far, and beyond that point it was necessary to\nacknowledge the role of incorporeal active principles. In so far as\nDescartes did believe this, for him the boundary demarcating what\ncould be explained in material terms and what could not, was a long\nway beyond where More would want to place it. \nMore’s interest in Descartes’s philosophy was so profound\nthat his acquaintance, Samuel Hartlib (c.1600–1662), an\nassiduous “intelligencer” who keenly promoted (and\nfacilitated) philosophical correspondence, persuaded More to write to\nDescartes in December 1648. More wrote four letters in all, but only\nreceived replies to the first two before Descartes’s death in\n1650. He received an unfinished third reply from Claude Clerselier in\n1655, while Clerselier was preparing his edition of Descartes’s\nLettres (1657), which prompted More’s Responsio ad\nfragmentum Cartesii. It is clear from these letters that\nMore’s differences with Descartes were (as we might expect)\nconsiderable and more serious than More realised. \nMore had some detailed criticisms of Cartesian physics, including his\naccount of refraction, and his vortex theory of celestial motions\n(which, More pointed out, ought to have given rise to celestial\ncylinders, rather than spheres, because the vortexes were held to be\nrotating in a plane around the equators of celestial bodies) (see, for\nexample, More 1662, in Antidote Against Atheism, separately\npaginated, 39; see also the Preface General, xv), but the more\nphilosophical criticisms revealed the most significant differences\nbetween them. More’s belief in an absolute space and time, which\nwas going to play a major role in his subsequent philosophy, was\nforeshadowed here in his critique of the Cartesian concepts. He\nrejected not only Descartes’s distinction between a universe\nwhich is indefinite in extent and one which can be concluded to be\ninfinite, but also Descartes’s definition of body as extension,\nand the concomitant impossibility of void space (Koyré 1957,\nGrobet 2010, Agostino 2017). More began to develop here one of his\nmost idiosyncratic beliefs, that everything had to exist in space. For\nDescartes bodies were extended things, but immaterial entities, such\nas God, angels, and souls, were not extended and could not be said to\noccupy space (to do so was a category mistake). For More, by contrast,\nimmaterial entities had to exist in space, and had to be extended.\nWhat did not exist in space, according to More, did not exist at all\n(Koyré 1957, Grant 1981, Reid 2012). Another group of\ncriticisms derived from More’s dissatisfaction with\nDescartes’s version of mind-body dualism, including aspects of\nthe union and interaction of body and soul, the denial of souls in\nanimals, and major differences about what can be achieved by matter in\nmotion, and what for More required a more active principle. More\nagreed with Descartes that matter was inert and therefore could only\nbe moved in passive response to an external mover. Where Descartes\nassumed the only such external movers were other moving bodies\n(initially, matter had been put into motion by God at the Creation and\nsubsequently motion was transferred from one body to another in\naccordance with the three laws of nature Descartes had devised), More\ninsisted that bodies could be moved by self-active, self-moving,\nimmaterial entities, such as souls and even God himself (Henry 1986,\n1989; Reid 2012, 2018). \nThe Cartesian claim that animals were more splendid versions of\nartificial automata, “which move without thought” (Letter\nto More, February 1649; Descartes 1991, 366), for example, was seen by\nMore as providing hostages to atheists. In the scholastic tradition\nthe ability to move oneself was seen as evidence of the presence of a\nsoul, and therefore of life. Descartes, pointing out that clocks and\nother automata are capable of moving themselves, denied this\ntraditional view and held the soul to be responsible only for\nthinking; movement was exclusively a feature of bodies. In the\nCartesian system, consequently, plants and animals were living\ncreatures without souls. Evidently, More regarded this position as\nlikely to lead to the conclusion that humans could also be counted as\nliving creatures without souls (it is not clear whether there were\ncontemporary Cartesians who held this, but it certainly became at\nleast a minority view in the period of the Enlightenment) (Cohen 1936,\nHenry 1989, Thomson 2008, Muratori 2017, Reid 2018). \nAnxious to defend the concept of immaterial souls from all atheist\nthreats, More insisted that the soul was necessary for life. He was\ntherefore opposed not only to Descartes, but also to traditional\nscholastic views. The motions of plants and animals (plants being\ncapable of internal motions associated with nutrition, reproduction,\nand growth), according to scholastics, proved the existence only of\nvegetative and animal souls respectively. Both of these kinds of souls\nwere regarded as material, however, being composed of subtle fluids or\ntenuous but nonetheless material spirits in the body. Descartes simply\nabsorbed the functions of these material souls into his mechanistic\ntheory of creature-as-automaton. By contrast, More, pursuing his\noverriding concern to deny atheists any footholds, ran counter to both\nAristotelians and Cartesians and insisted on the immateriality of\nanimal souls (and presumably vegetative souls, though he does not seem\nto discuss them). In More’s version of dualism only immaterial\nentities are self-active and capable of initiating movement in other\nentities, and so the fact that plants and animals can move themselves\nis taken to prove that they must have immaterial souls (Henry 1986,\n1989; Reid 2012). It should be noted, therefore, that underlying\nMore’s argumentation is a commitment to the belief that matter\nis essentially passive (capable only of inertial motions), and that\nonly immaterial entities are active. This commitment, however, is not\nbased on any original philosophical arguments developed by More\nhimself. It is simply based on what More sees as a fundamental premise\nof Cartesianism, namely, that matter or body is completely inert and\npassive. This is why More seized upon Cartesianism so keenly. If\nmatter is inert then the activity we see all around us must have\nanother source, which must be immaterial. Underlying this, of course,\nwas a desire to deny the claims of contemporary materialist (and\ntherefore atheist) philosophers (Henry 1986, Leech 2013).  \nMore also took issue with Descartes’s account of colliding\nbodies. In Descartes’s system the amount of motion was always\nmaintained at a constant level (guaranteed by God) and this was made\nmanifest in collisions, where motions could be seen to be transferred\nfrom one body to another. For More, this seemed too materialistic an\nexplanation, and failed to pay due attention to the role of\nimmateriality. The nub of the matter was that, as More saw it, matter\nin motion was allowed to explain too much by Descartes. The system\ncould be (as indeed it was) appropriated by atheists, who would simply\ndismiss God’s role and turn it into an entirely materialist\nphilosophy. Early in his career, More accepted the basic principles of\nDescartes’s mechanical philosophy, and accepted that\n“Matter it self, once moved, can move other Matter” (More\n1662, in Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 21).\nAt this time, More’s immaterial principle of activity, the\nSpirit of Nature (discussed more fully below), was only introduced to\nexplain phenomena which More believed could not be explained\nmechanically, such as gravity (More 1662, in Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 11). In More’s mature natural\nphilosophy, however, matter was going to be held to be not merely\npassive but absolutely inert. That is to say, where once More would\nhave accepted that passive matter might be held to carry on moving\nafter being given an initial push (indeed it must do so because it\ncould not stop itself), More later developed the view that matter was\ncompletely incapable of moving by itself. Consequently, all activity\nin any system (even what might otherwise look like merely passive\ninertial motion) was to be introduced by, or was the result of, the\nworking of immaterial spirit, because immaterial entities were the\nonly entities capable of acting. In the Preface to his Divine\nDialogues (1668), for example, More insisted “that there is\nno purely Mechanicall Phaenomenon in the whole Universe” (More\n1668, sig. A6v). By this time, More did not want anything to\nblur the distinction between non-active matter and active spirit, and\nso he could not allow that matter might be set in motion and continue\nto move of its own accord, or by its own nature; this looked too much\nlike matter having activity of its own. \nAnother striking indication of the development of More’s\nthinking on this issue can be seen by comparing his early vitalistic\nconcept of matter to his later insistence that matter is completely\ninert. In his early philosophical poems and in his correspondence with\nDescartes, More evidently felt he could dismiss mechanistic\nmaterialism by indicating that even supposedly inanimate bodies were\nalive in some way (Reid 2012, 2018). We can see this, for example, in\nhis objection to Descartes’s claim that motion could be\ntransferred from one moving body to another: \nEvidently, More saw this as sufficient to refute atheistic\nmaterialism, declaring in the same letter that although a body can\nneither feel nor think, “it constitutes the last and faintest\nshadow and image of the divine essence, which I take to be the most\nperfect life” (Descartes 1966, V: 383). It soon became apparent\nto More, however, that the shortcomings of the mechanical philosophy\nmight be avoided simply by supposing that matter was alive and\ntherefore capable of self-movement. This might be assumed without\nrecourse to God, and would lead to what More called hylozoic atheism\n(Reid 2018). More quickly dropped all traces of vitalism from his\nconcept of body, therefore, and insisted ever afterwards on the strict\ndichotomy between inactive matter, and active immaterial spirit.\nSubsequently, when he discerned hylozoism in later thinkers, such as\nSpinoza and Francis Glisson (about which more later), he opposed them\nas vigorously as he did mechanistic materialists, such as Thomas\nHobbes and the Cartesians (Henry 1987, Sytsma 2017). It is important\nto note, therefore, that there are clear signs of development in\nMore’s works, from vaguely formed starting points to more\ncarefully wrought and internally consistent mature positions (Reid\n2003, 2007).  \nBe that as it may, Descartes’s initial response to More’s\naccount of what happens in collisions between bodies (end of August\n1649), which he never managed to send before his death, was that More\nwas inventing principles which were surplus to requirements, and\ntherefore detrimental to philosophy: \nThis was an extremely perceptive comment. More was going to go on to\ndevelop his concept of the Spirit of Nature (alluded to here as\n“the shadow of the divine essence”, but which More later\nreferred to as “the vicarious power of God”) which would\ndraw similar criticisms from the leading natural philosophers, Robert\nBoyle (1627–1691) and Robert Hooke (1635–1703). For them\nit was merely a fabrication which explained nothing that could not be\nexplained more simply without it; and “Truth”, as Boyle\nwas later to say (1672), “ought to be pleaded for only by\nTruth” (Boyle 1999, 184; Henry 1990). Descartes called\nMore’s Angels “corporeal” simply because More\ndeclared them to be extended entities. More did not see\nDescartes’s comment until 1655, by which time it was too late.\nBy then, More was already committed to his Spirit of Nature, which he\nsaw as an indispensable feature of the world system (enabling him, for\nexample, to move away from his earlier vitalist materialism, which he\nnow saw as dangerous to religion). It is doubtful, however, that More\nwould have been diverted from this course by Descartes’s words,\neven if he had seen them in time. The Spirit of Nature was not just\npleasing to More; he made it an indispensable feature of his\nphilosophical theology (see next section, and Reid 2012, Leech\n2013). \nOne of More’s students at Cambridge, who was clearly impressed\nby his account of Cartesianism, was John Finch (1626–1682), son\nof Heneage Finch (1580–1631), Speaker of the House of Commons.\nFinch introduced More to his half-sister, Anne, who later became\nVicountess Conway and Killultagh (1631–1679). Anne had a passion\nfor learning and More tutored her in philosophy, and particularly in\nCartesianism, but their relationship soon developed into one of\nfriendship. Although they remained friends to the last, the\nrelationship of tutor and pupil eventually gave way to one of equals,\nand Anne developed sufficiently to produce a philosophical theology\nthat was very much her own, and was effectively a rejection of\nMore’s (Nicolson 1992, Conway 1996, Hutton 2004). The Cambridge\nPlatonist did not just benefit from the delights of Anne’s\ncompany, however; the Conway family was to prove a powerful patron and\nsupporter for More after the Restoration, when his former allegiance\nto the Protectorate drew potentially dangerous criticism. Indeed,\nEdward, Lord Conway (c. 1623–1683) even arranged a\nbishopric in Ireland for More, and an appointment as prebend of\nWorcester, but More preferred to remain in Cambridge. \nIt was during the Protectorate that More produced a remarkable group\nof philosophical writings. There is a sense in which the four works\nwhich he published throughout the 1650s can be seen as a summation of\nMore’s philosophical system. This is perhaps evident from the\nfact that, shortly after the appearance of the last of them, The\nImmortality of the Soul of 1659, he re-issued them all together\nin his Collection of Philosophical Writings (1662). The\nessentially pragmatic aim of More’s philosophy was made plain in\nthe title of the first of these, An Antidote Against Atheism\n(1653)—the collection as a whole might well have been called an\nantidote against contemporary threats to religion: atheism, and\nenthusiasm. \nThe Antidote deserves to be better known as one of the\nearliest contributions to what later became a vigorous tradition in\nBritish natural philosophy, namely natural theology. Although there is\na sense in which natural theology, or the attempt to establish the\nexistence and attributes of God by studying nature, can be found among\nThomas Aquinas’s five proofs of the existence of God, it was\nonly in the seventeenth century that this enterprise began to be\nworked out in detail, usually alongside the promotion of the new\natomistic philosophies which seemed to offer the best alternative to\nthe traditional “hand-maiden” to Christian theology,\nAristotelianism. The very first contributions to natural theology,\npublished long before the tradition’s Newtonian heyday, were\nWalter Charleton’s Darknes of Atheism dispelled by the Light\nof Nature (1652), and More’s Antidote (Leech\n2013). More even prefigured the much later argument of William Paley\nthat depended upon finding a watch in an uninhabited place:  \nThe Antidote begins by borrowing Descartes’s\nontological proof of the existence of God, but he went on from there\nto consider other aspects of the fact that we have an\n“indelible” idea of God and, as Descartes showed, other\ninnate ideas. This led him to consider, for example, the final cause\nof our idea of God, which in turn led him to consider our innate\nknowledge of good and evil. The first book is also concerned with the\nnature of the soul itself, in which More takes pains to persuade his\nreader that it is distinct from the substance of the body, and that\nthe body is completely incapable not only of thought, without the\nincorporeal soul, but also of movement. The second book develops the\nargument from design to oppose atheism, and the third introduces a\nfavourite stratagem of More’s, the rehearsal of well-known or\nwell-attested stories of witchcraft, snake-charming, raising of\ntempests by the power of words, and other “spiritual”\nphenomena as evidence for the existence of an immaterial realm\n(Coudert 1990, Crocker 2003). Throughout More builds up a picture of\nimmaterial spirit as the only substance capable of spontaneous\nactivity, and insists that inert matter is incapable of explaining all\nphysical phenomena on its own. \nMore’s next work, the Conjectura Cabbalistica: Or, A\nconjectural Essay of interpreting the minde of Moses according to a\nthreefold Cabbala, viz., literal, philosophical, mystical, or divinely\nmoral, published in the same year as the Antidote, is a\nstrange exercise, supposedly based on the premise that the first three\nchapters of Genesis contain a summation of all wisdom but hidden under\na veil. It can be seen as an attempt not just to link natural\nphilosophy with religion (which could result in a merely deistic\nnatural theology), but to link it with revealed religion, as\ntaught in Scripture. Written at the request of Anne Conway, it is an\nexercise in imaginative scholarship, seeking to show, for example,\nthat ancient Pythagoreanism, which gave rise to Platonism, was in fact\nderived from an earlier Mosaical philosophy, and can now be seen,\nthanks to More, as tantamount to Cartesianism: \nOne of the ways in which More tries to establish the link between\nCartesianism and the teachings of Moses is by arguing for a close\nparallel between the three types of matter, or three elements,\ndiscerned by Descartes, and the three successively rarefied\n“vehicles” of the soul in Platonised versions of Christian\ndoctrine, the terrestrial, the aerial, and the aetherial. It is\nperhaps worth pointing out that this work owes little or nothing to\nthe Jewish tradition of Kabbalah, but should be seen as a late\ncontribution to the Renaissance tradition of Christian cabbala first\nintroduced by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) (Coudert\n1992, Crocker 2003; but see below, and Laerke 2017, for developments\nlater in More’s career). \nHaving directly attacked atheism, and shown the close relationship\nbetween the Bible and the latest philosophical ideas, More then turned\nhis attention to what was widely perceived as the other contemporary\nthreat to sound religion, enthusiasm. The Enthusiasmus\nTriumphatus of 1656 is concerned with the different kinds of\nreligious fanaticism, their causes, and how to cure them. Among the\nspecific writers singled out by More are the founders of the so-called\nFamily of Love, David George (fl. 1550?), and Henry Nicholas\n(c. 1501– c. 1580), the alchemist and\n“Luther of medicine”, Paracelsus (1493–1541), and\nthe German mystic, Jacob Boehme (1575–1624). The cure prescribed\nby Dr More required temperance, humility, and reason. Here again,\nhowever, we can see More’s overriding concern with a failure to\ndistinguish between matter and spirit: \nThe final book in this series, and for the time being the culmination\nof More’s philosophical ambitions, was the Immortality of\nthe Soul, So farre forth as it is demonstrable from the Knowledge of\nNature and the Light of Reason (1659). As is evident from the\ntitle, the book marks a return to natural theology, but it also\nreturns to other earlier themes, including the parallel between\nCartesian matter theory and the three “vehicles” of the\nsoul, and the reality of spiritual phenomena as revealed in accounts\nof witchcraft, apparitions, and the like. A major new focus of concern\nis the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, whose Leviathan had\nappeared in 1651. More decries Hobbes for his materialism, his\ndeterminism, and his mortalism (emphasising the resurrection of the\nbody on a far distant Day of Judgment, with no interim post\nmortem punishment, or reward), all of which, of course, are seen\nby More as incompatible with Christian theism. \nPerhaps as a result of the perceived atheism of Hobbes, and\nMore’s increasing awareness that the philosophy of Descartes had\nalso been appropriated by atheists and twisted to serve their\npurposes, More presents his own would-be cure for atheism in its most\ncogent and most powerful form in The Immortality of the Soul.\nThe main focus of the three books are the establishment of dualism and\nthe nature of incorporeal substance, the relationship of the soul to\nthe body, and the life of the separated soul in the after-life; but\nalong the way More deals with many associated phenomena, such as the\nsouls of animals, and the pre-existence of the human soul. In\nparticular, it is in this work that he develops most fully his concept\nof the Spirit of Nature. Although the Spirit of Nature is More’s\nmost characteristic contribution to the history of natural philosophy,\nhis pronouncements about it have only very recently been properly\nexamined (Henry 1990, Reid 2012, Leech 2013). It is not hard to see\nwhy this is so. The concept was vigorously opposed by contemporary\nnatural philosophers, from leading figures such as Boyle and Hooke,\ndown to a dilettante virtuoso such as Sir Matthew Hale\n(1609–1676). The concept had very little influence, therefore,\nbeyond More’s own circle of devoted followers. The only other\nphilosopher to take it seriously was More’s close friend and\ncolleague, the Master of Christ’s College, Ralph Cudworth\n(1617–1688). Since our immediate concern here is the philosophy\nof Henry More, irrespective of its influence, we must look closely at\nhis most distinctive contribution to natural philosophy. \nWe have already seen that More admired the philosophy of Descartes\nprecisely because he felt that it showed that matter alone cannot\nexplain all phenomena. He reiterated this in the Immortality,\nrecommending that the French philosophy should be taught in all the\nuniversities of Europe, \nThe perceived short-fall would be helpful to religion, according to\nMore, precisely because the deficit could only be made good by\nacknowledging the role of an immaterial, active principle. This\nprinciple was the Spirit of Nature. \nIn the Immortality of the Soul (1659) More accepts the\nfundamental precepts of the mechanical philosophy, and acknowledges\nthe Cartesian claim that “Matter it self once moved can move\nother Matter” (More 1662, in Immortality of the Soul,\nseparately paginated, 21), but insists that it cannot move itself. So\nfar, Descartes would agree. Unlike Descartes, however, More refuses to\naccept that all the phenomena of the universe can follow from an\noriginal push by God, setting in train an endless cosmic chain\nreaction of colliding particles. Even though Descartes talks of the\ncontinued action of God in preserving the same quantity of motion in\nthe world, as far as More is concerned the Cartesian account concedes\ntoo much to the mechanical interactions of material entities. Although\nboth More and Descartes agree that God, the primary cause of all\nthings, operates in the world by means of delegated secondary causes,\nthey differ radically about the correct secondary causes. For\nDescartes, bodies in motion, acting in conformity with his laws of\nnature and rules of collision, are the secondary causes; but More\ncannot accept that bodies can perform all that is required. More\nrecognises that Descartes’s view could undermine his own prior\ncommitment to his dualistic theology, because it could be made to lead\nto a monistic materialist system of mechanical philosophy (in which\nGod’s role is simply written out). In an attempt to avoid this,\nMore says that the fact that matter can be brought to rest “is\nan Argument not only that Self activity belongs to a Spirit, but that\nthere is such a thing as Spirit in the world”. Presumably the\npoint is that if matter was self-active it could not stop its own\nactivity, and therefore could never come to rest. Anyone who denies\nthis, More insists, “must of necessity (as I have intimated\nalready) confess that this Matter moves it self, though it be very\nincongruous so to affirm” (More 1662, Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 31). \nAccordingly, More concludes that there must be an active principle at\nwork to take care of those things which cannot be accomplished by the\n“Mechanical Powers of Matter”: \nBut how is it that this incorporeal substance can “actuate grand\nproportions of matter”? Here More draws on Neoplatonic\nemanationism. The Spirit of Nature, he says, actuates matter as it\nemanates outward in a “sphere of life and activity” (More\n1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 27). It\ndoes so because it is axiomatic that an “Emanative Cause”\nis “such a cause as merely by Being, no other activity or\ncausality interposed, produces an Effect.” An example of an\nemanative cause is light from a candle. When a candle is lit it emits\nlight and cannot fail to do so. There must be such a cause in the\nworld, he says, because “something must move itself” (More\n1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 27). \nIt should be noted that More’s Spirit of Nature must be extended\nin space, if it can be said to emanate spherically. This marks\nMore’s notion of spirit out from Descartes’s res\ncogitans. For Descartes, matter is extended and souls are not;\nstrictly speaking (although there was some room for manoeuvre, Reid\n2008), souls are non-spatial entities and do not exist in space. For\nMore, this is an idea of existence which makes no sense. For something\nto exist, it must exist somewhere; it must occupy space. The same is\ntrue of God, no less than the Spirit of Nature, and individual souls\n(Reid 2003, Leech 2013). \nMore has a ready answer to those for whom extension implies\ndivisibility, and who therefore object that, if More were right, God\nand souls would be divisible. More concedes that extended things can\nbe divided conceptually, but immaterial spirits, such as God and\nsouls, cannot be physically divided in any way. Moving away from the\nconcept of divisibility, More introduces the notion of what he calls\n“discerpibility”, deriving from the Latin word for tearing\nin pieces. He draws on the long-standing exemplar of Neoplatonic\nemanation theory to make his point—light. A luminous orb of\nlight, he says, “does very much resemble the nature of a Spirit,\nwhich is diffus’d and extended, and yet indivisible” (More\n1662, Antidote Against Atheism, separately paginated, 150).\nNo engine or art could separate one luminous ray from another, and \nIn Ancient emanation theory, of course, the ultimate source from which\nall things emanated was God, and it seems clear that More follows suit\nhere as well. The Spirit of Nature is “the first step to the\nabstrusest mysteries in Natural Theologie”, More writes, because\nit is “the Vicarious Power of God upon the Matter” (More\n1662, Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 13). But\nthis seems to open More up to another charge, namely that he has\nabandoned any pretence to a natural philosophy, seeking to explain\nphenomena in terms of secondary causation, and instead simply defers\nall things to the direct action of God. \nBut More is adamant that the Spirit of Nature is a “Secondary or\nEmanatory Substance” (More 1662, Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 28), and should correctly be seen as\na secondary cause. Responding to the charge that he has\n“introduced an obscure Principle for ignorance and Sloth to take\nsanctuary in… and hinder that expected progress that may be\nmade in the Mechanick Philosophy” (More 1662, Immortality of\nthe Soul, separately paginated, 11), More insisted that the\nSpirit of Nature was a help, not a hindrance. Speaking of this\ninstrument of the “Vicarious Power of God”, he wrote: \nOne of the ways in which More supported this claim was to repeatedly\ninsist that the Spirit of Nature operated blindly, without perception\nor intelligence (and so was not in any sense the manifestation of the\ndirect action of God). He illustrates this by reference to the new\nexperiments with an air-pump conducted by Robert Boyle. If the\nair-pump is fitted with a valve, the air beating against the valve\nwill not only close the valve against itself, but “will bear up\nwith it a ten-pound weight” (More 1662, Antidote Against\nAtheism, separately paginated, 44). This kind of\n“self-thwarting” activity (since the air really\n“intends” to fill up the vacuum in the chamber of the\npump) shows not only that the air has “no Power, Knowledge, and\nliberty of will”, but also that there are no “Divine\nparticles interspersed in the Aire that have”. More concludes at\nthis point, \nElsewhere More says, \nHere, then, More fully accepts the precepts of the mechanical\nphilosophy, but he refuses to accept that Cartesianism can account for\nall phenomena. As in his letters to Descartes, for example, he points\nout that the mechanical vortex theory should result in cylindrical\nheavenly bodies, so it must be the action of the Spirit of Nature that\nmakes them spherical (see, for example, More 1662, in Antidote\nAgainst Atheism, separately paginated, 39; see also the Preface\nGeneral, xv). He also points to magnetism and gravity as phenomena\nwhich are not convincingly explained by Descartes, as well as\ncondensation and rarefaction. He also points to the Achilles heel of\nthe mechanical philosophy, the generation and development of plants\nand animals, as well as the instinctive behaviour of animals. Later on\nin his career, however, More’s concern to establish the\nexistence of immaterial spirit beyond all doubt, leads him to deny\nthat bodies are capable even of mechanical interactions: “there\nis no Phaenomenon of Nature purely Mechanicall” (More 1668, 31).\nAll phenomena, he says, are “not carried according to\nMechanicall Necessity, but that there is a Principle that has a\nProspection for the best, that rules all” (More 1686, 34). \nIn all these cases the Spirit of Nature is required to intervene,\nalthough More is vague upon precisely how it intervenes. Later on More\ndevelops the idea that the Spirit of Nature can “unite and as it\nwere cohere” (uniatur & quasi cohaerescat) with\nbody in order to move it (More 1671, 398; translated in More 1682,\n174). In the Immortality of the soul, however, he seems to\nimply that it simply communicates the laws of nature to the relevant\nsystems, since he describes it as “a mute copy of the eternal\nWord (that is, of that Divine Wisedome that is entirely\neverywhere)” which \nAccordingly, the Spirit of Nature “is the lowest Substantial\nActivity from the all-wise God, containing in it certain general Modes\nand Lawes of Nature” (More 1662, Preface General, xvi).\nSimilarly, in his defence of the concept of the Spirit of Nature\nagainst the criticisms of Sir Mathew Hale, More declares: \nBut More is less concerned about the details of how the Spirit of\nNature fulfils its functions, than he is with establishing that it\nmust exist. As he goes on to say immediately after the last\nquotation: \nHaving pointed to phenomena in nature which cannot be explained in\nterms of the mechanical philosophy, More can introduce the concept of\nan active Spirit of Nature to fill in the lacunae. He therefore has\nprovided, according to his own lights, a rational, philosophical,\nbasis for the necessary existence of the Spirit of Nature, and by\nextension of spirit, or incorporeal substance more generally. This is\ncrucial, of course, for More’s dualistic theology. It seems\nclear to us, as it must have for many contemporary readers, that the\nSpirit of Nature did not emerge from More’s understanding of the\nnatural world, but from the demands of his rational dualist ontology.\nPreoccupied as he was with the need to establish a categorical dualism\nbetween inert matter and active incorporeal spirit, he was quick to\nsee those parts of Descartes’s natural philosophy which were\nleast plausible, or completely unconvincing, as providing what he took\nto be evidence for the necessary existence of the Spirit of\nNature. \nThe year after the appearance of the Immortality of the\nSoul, More published his Explanation of the Grand Mystery of\nGodliness (1660). Although Richard Ward tells us that More vowed\nto write this book during a “dangerous fit of Sickness, if it\nshould please God to recover him from it” (Ward 2000, 335),\nthere is every reason to suppose that, after the Immortality,\nMore felt he had said enough about the philosophical background to his\nbeliefs, and fully intended to turn to an explication of his faith.\nFurthermore, the decision to write an exposition of his religious\nideas may have been influenced by the political upheaval following the\ndeath of Oliver Cromwell in 1659, and the restoration of the monarchy.\nMore had taken the Engagement late in 1650 (engaging to be true and\nfaithful to the Commonwealth of England) (Gabbey 1992, 113–4)\nand was therefore in a precarious position on the reinstatement of the\nexiled and ejected fellows who had refused the Engagement. \nBy this time More’s anti-Calvinism and his emphasis upon\nrational theology ensured that he was branded as a\n“Latitude-man” by more conservative divines, and with the\nreturn of the exiles to Cambridge the Latitudinarians came to be seen\nas potentially subversive in both politics and religion (Crocker\n2003). If More did write his Grand Mystery of Godliness\npartially as a response to his precarious situation in Cambridge he\ndid not engage in dissimulation of his beliefs. Evidently More\nbelieved that his position was so reasonable that a clear statement of\nhis beliefs would win over his critics and result in his complete\nrehabilitation. More’s chief purpose in the book was to persuade\nbelievers that there are only a few essential doctrines of the Church,\nall other details of one’s faith being indifferent to\none’s salvation, and that all that was required of a good\nChristian was to recognise and adhere to these essentials (which was\nthe hallmark of Latitudinarianism). \nUnfortunately, but perhaps predictably, More’s stratagem did not\nwin over all his readers. For one thing, there were too many people at\nCambridge who had a vested interest in bringing him down (as a leading\nLatitudinarian), and for another, More, typically, could not prevent\nhimself from introducing more theological niceties into his discussion\nthan were compatible with his irenic purposes. In particular, while\ndiscussing the dual nature of Christ, as both human and divine, More\ncould not forebear from bringing in the doctrine of the pre-existence\nof souls, and suggested that Christ’s human soul had been in\nperpetual union with the Father for all eternity (and was in this\nrespect uniquely different from other human souls). More also went on\nto use his own theory of the three “vehicles” of the soul,\naetherial, aerial, and terrestrial (which he had introduced in\nConjectura Cabbalistica and developed more fully in the\nImmortality of the Soul), as a way of persuading doubters of\nthe reasonableness of accounts of Christ’s resurrection and\nascension. \nJoseph Beaumont (1616–1699), who had been established as Master\nof Jesus College after the Restoration but had just moved to become\nMaster of Peterhouse, privately circulated a manuscript raising ten\nmajor objections against More’s Grand Mystery of\nGodliness in 1663. More was evidently beleaguered by more\nwidespread opposition in Cambridge at this time, and Edward, Lord\nConway, at the urging of his wife, Anne, arranged a preferment for\nMore in Ireland. More weathered the storm, however, even after his\nApology of Dr Henry More (1664), a response to Beaumont and\nother critics, elicited Some Observations on the Apologie of Dr.\nHenry More (1665) from an unconvinced Beaumont. More’s\nideas drew further implicit criticism the following year from Samuel\nParker (1640–1688), later to become Bishop of Oxford (1686), in\nhis A Free and Impartial Censure of the Platonick Philosophie\n(1666). \nMore’s position improved as Latitudinarianism came to be seen\nmore sympathetically in Restoration England. Where it was once a\ndisparaging term for someone with a “broad swallow”, who\nwould accept anything, and so was taken to be insincere in everything,\nit later came to be seen as a genuinely irenic position, and perhaps\nthe best hope for reconciling all factions. It has to be said,\nhowever, that as Latitudinarianism came to be seen in this more\npositive light, More was increasingly exposed, ironically, as too\nidiosyncratic, too much committed to rather outlandish theological\npositions, such as his Origenianism, to count as a typical\nLatitudinarian, who would insist only on a very few fundamental\ndoctrines, all of which were (supposedly) immediately acceptable to\nall Christians. \nOne aspect of this can be seen in More’s attempts to offer the\ncorrect interpretation of the Revelation to St John, which must have\nreminded some contemporaries of the importance of prophecy and\nchiliastic claims to many of the radical sectarian groups of the\nInterregnum period. Perhaps this was another case of More’s own\ntendency towards religious enthusiasm resurfacing. He pursued his\ninterpretation of prophecy in his Synopsis prophetica of 1664\nand the Exposition of the Seven Epistles to the Seven\nChurches of 1669 (and revisited these studies towards the end of\nhis life with a verse by verse analysis of the Revelation in\nApocalypsis apocalypseos, 1680, and other apocalyptic works)\n(Almond 1993, Hutton 1994). In keeping with his dualistic theology,\nMore rejected chiliastic or millenarian expectations of a Day of\nJudgement which would see a general resurrection of all the bodies of\npast ages, and argued instead for a more spiritual Second Coming and\nresurrection. Here again, More drew on his ideas about the aetherial\nand aerial vehicles of the soul, which he was able to link to the\nresurrection in heavenly and incorruptible form as conceived by St\nPaul (1 Corinthians 15, 45–55). \nIf More’s apocalypticism was taking him away from the more\nconciliatory and irenic concerns of the increasing community of\nLatitudinarian thinkers in England, he showed no regrets. Indeed, from\nnow on More’s theology was to develop along increasingly\nidiosyncratic, and dogmatic lines. \nSince the Restoration More had concentrated exclusively on religious\nwritings, some of which were demanded by the writings of his critics.\nIn 1667, however, he produced a work on moral philosophy, the\nEnchiridion ethicum. It is known that More wrote Latin with\ndifficulty, and it is not clear why he did not publish this in\nEnglish. It is possible that he hoped to reach a wider, European\naudience—certainly this would be the motivation, a few years\nlater, for translating his earlier works into a Latin Opera\nomnia (1675–79)—but this seems an unlikely book with\nwhich to introduce oneself to a European readership. There is another\npossible explanation, with much more restricted local concerns: More\npublished it in Latin to leave room for his friend and colleague Ralph\nCudworth to publish his very similar system of ethics in English. \nThe fact is, as with so many other aspects of their thinking, More and\nCudworth shared essentially the same moral philosophy. Cudworth had\nbeen preparing his own book on ethics for a number of years but in the\nevent he never published anything in this area. It seems that he\nabandoned the project when he heard that More was also working on a\nbook on ethics. Cudworth’s system was posthumously published\nunder the title, A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable\nMorality (1731), but it is a title that More might also have\nused. One of the main aims of More’s Manual of Ethics\nwas to leave the reader in no doubt that there are absolute values of\ngood and evil which are co-eternal with God. That is to say, More\nwished to refute the Calvinist theological position that whatever God\ndecrees to be good is good, in favour of the alternative theological\nposition, that God wills what is good (and he does so necessarily\nbecause He himself conforms to an absolute standard of goodness). \nThis marks a new phase in More’s life-long opposition to\nCalvinism. The theology of Calvinism is known as voluntaristic\ntheology because it emphasises God’s will in the Creation. God\ncould, and did, create the world freely by the power of his omnipotent\nwill. His choices in the Creation could not be held to have been\nconstrained by pre-existing notions of good or evil, or by\npre-existing essences or natures of things, because there were no such\npre-existing notions before the Creation. The opposing view,\nrepresented by More, is known as necessitarian, or intellectualist, or\neven rationalist theology, and is most familiar to modern readers\nthrough the satirical representation of it in Voltaire’s\nCandide (1759). In this theology, God cannot create a world\narbitrarily, with no constraints upon his creativity. God has to\nconform to pre-existing, co-eternal, moral and conceptual principles.\nGod must conform to principles of goodness and justice. Similarly, he\nmust create matter that embodies the principles of materiality,\nnamely, inertness and passivity. Because God is supremely good he must\ncreate the best of all possible worlds. The clear implication of this\nis that what makes a good world, or a better one, and what makes the\nbest one possible, can be specified independently of God. More\nbelieved the concepts of good and evil were absolute terms, presumably\nco-eternal with God, and must necessarily guide, and indeed restrain,\nGod’s creative omnipotence (Henry 1990, Taliaferro 2005). \nMore’s necessitarian theology is very much to the fore in the\nDivine Dialogues of 1668. Although this is intended to\npresent the main features of his philosophical theology to a much\nwider audience, it is presented, as the extended title makes plain, in\nthe context of a discussion about the nature of God’s\nProvidence. At one point More tells us that “all the Orders of\nthe Creation in the whole Universe” issue from God’s\n“infinite Goodness, Wisdome and Power”, and that His\ngoodness is \nIt is repugnant to reason, More insists, that God “should ever\nwill any thing but what is absolutely for the best” (More 1668,\nII, 24–25). More even discusses in this connection the existence\nof animals which do not seem to be beneficial to mankind; arguing that\nthey must serve some purpose in the whole system of this best of all\npossible worlds (Muratori 2017). \nMore’s new theological emphasis is also evident in the rather\ndifferent attempt to reach a wider audience, this time a learned\nLatinate audience across Europe, which he published in 1671, his\nEnchiridion metaphysicum. The Manual of Metaphysics\nis a major re-statement of More’s views on incorporeal\nsubstance, or spirit. The main claims are familiar from his earlier\nphilosophical works, therefore, but there are two new, and highly\nsignificant, features. Firstly, More fully develops his ideas on\nabsolute infinite space and presents it as a major exemplar of\nincorporeal spirit (Koyré 1957, Reid 2007, 2012). Secondly,\nwhile drawing on contemporary experimental natural philosophy to\nprovide him with examples of phenomena which cannot be explained\nsolely in terms of matter and motion, More explicitly draws upon a\nspecific experiment performed by Robert Boyle, and published by him in\nhis New Experiments Physico-mechanicall touching the Spring of the\nAir (1660). If Boyle knew of More’s Immortality of the\nSoul (and it is almost certain that he did), he never troubled to\ncomment publicly upon it. Once his own experiments, and his own name,\nwere deliberately invoked to support More’s philosophical\ntheology, however, Boyle could not let it pass (Henry 1990). \nAfter opening discussions on the nature of metaphysics, on\ndistinctions, and on the divisions of being, More argues that the\nproper subject of metaphysics is incorporeal being, or spiritual\nsubstance. Each of the next twenty chapters (Chapters 6–25)\nfocus on a single “method of proving the existence of immaterial\nsubstance” (More 1671, 42). These are drawn from natural\nphilosophy, rather than from metaphysics: “From gravity”,\n“From pneumatic experiments”, “From vortices and\ncomets”, and so forth. The most significant addition to\nMore’s earlier work appears in Chapter 8 where More uses his\nconcept of space as the perfect example of immaterial spirit. He\ndismisses Aristotle’s and Descartes’s concepts of place\nbefore presenting his own views on a real, self-existing space in some\ndetail. More’s concept will be familiar to modern readers who\nare acquainted with Newton’s notion of absolute space. It is\nessentially a three-dimensional Euclidean space which is infinite in\nextent, completely isomorphous, and void except where it is occupied\nby body. For More, however, it is also the best example of\nimmaterial—and therefore spiritual—reality in the world.\nWhat makes it the best example for More is that it is completely\nundeniable. As one of the characters in More’s Divine\nDialogues (1668) is made to say, referring to the scholastic\ntradition of calling the supposed infinite space beyond the sphere of\nthe fixed stars, “imaginary space”: space is “so\nimaginary that it cannot be dis-imagined by human understanding”\n(More 1668, 54). \nPreviously, More had relied upon the Spirit of Nature as the supreme\nexample of immaterial substance in the world, but of course, he could\nonly insist upon the reality of this Spirit indirectly; arguing that\nit must exist to explain gravity, magnetism, generation, and other\nphenomena that presented real problems for the mechanical philosophy\n(Henry 1986, 1990). The advantage of using space to\ndemonstrate the main features of immaterial substance was precisely\nbecause (at least, according to More, disregarding Aristotle,\nDescartes, and others) nobody could deny that space existed. The\nbeauty, and the forcefulness, of using space as the exemplar of spirit\nis that its existence cannot be denied. It cannot be denied not just\nbecause everyone is aware of space by virtue of everyday experience,\nbut also because, according to More, it is inconceivable that the\nworld could exist without a space for it to occupy. “For we must\neither acknowledge”, More wrote, “that there is a certain\nextended [entity] besides matter, or that God could not create finite\nmatter” (More 1671, 42). \nMore was evidently so excited by his realisation that space could\nrepresent immaterial substance that he went on to draw close parallels\nbetween absolute space and God. He demonstrated this by enumerating\n“about twenty titles which the metaphysicians attribute to God\nand which fit the immobile extended [entity] or internal place”.\nIt is worth quoting in full: \nWhen we shall have enumerated those names and titles appropriate to\nit, this infinite immobile, extended [entity] will appear to be not\nonly something real (as we have just pointed out) but even something\nDivine (which so certainly is found in nature); this will give us\nfurther assurance that it cannot be nothing since that to which so\nmany and such magnificent attributes pertain cannot be nothing. Of\nthis kind are the following, which metaphysicians attribute\nparticularly to the First Being, such as: One, Simple, Immobile,\nExternal, complete, Independent, Existing in itself, Subsisting by\nitself, Incorruptible, Necessary, Immense, Uncreated, Uncircumscribed,\nIncomprehensible, Omnipresent, Incorporeal, All-penetrating,\nAll-embracing, Being by its essence, Actual Being, Pure Act. \nThere are not less than twenty titles by which the Divine Numen is\nwont to be designated, and which perfectly fit this infinite internal\nplace (locus) the existence of which in nature we have demonstrated;\nomitting moreover that the very Divine Numen is called, by the\nCabbalists, MAKOM, that is, Place (locus) (More 1671, 69–70; see\nalso Copenhaver 1980, Grant 1981, Reid 2012, Leech 2013). \nMore goes through each of the divine attributes in turn to show how\nthey apply to space. He even contrives to apply the final notion,\n“Pure Act”, to space: “it is aptly called being\nin act as it cannot but be conceived as existing outside of its\ncauses. And, finally, pure Act, since it exists from itself\nnecessarily, nor is it affected by any other thing, by which it can be\ncompleted or acted on in some way” (More 1671, 72). \nIt is difficult to be sure precisely how closely More wants us to take\nthe analogy between God and space. Clearly space and God are not one\nand the same, but More at the very least regards space as an\ninstrument, or organ, through which God creates and maintains the\nworld, and without which He could not have created it. It is this last\npoint which is crucial. More insisted that for something to exist, it\nmust exist in space. This included God himself, and More was the first\ntheologian or philosopher to propose that God must be an extended\ninfinite being (Grant 1981, 223). Given the intimate connection\nbetween God and space and the supposition that nothing could exist\nunless space existed, God did not have to will space into existence.\nSpace was held to be an emanative effect of God. Accordingly, just as\nlight spontaneously emanates from a lit candle, so space emanates from\nGod. The world is necessarily dualistic, therefore. There cannot be a\nmonistic world, comprised solely of matter. Matter requires space to\naccommodate its extended nature, but space is immaterial substance,\nand so the world must be dualist in nature (Grant 1981, 226–27;\nReid 2012, 138; Leech 2013; Thomas 2018, 51–2). \nMore’s concept of space is crucially important, therefore, for\nmaking the truth of his dualistic world picture undeniable, or so he\nbelieves. To reinforce the truth of his concept of space More also\ndismisses what he calls nullibism, the Cartesian view that\nsouls can exist nowhere, or not in space. Clearly, this view\ncompletely undermines More’s position, and so he dismisses it as\nnonsensical—for something to exist, More insists, it must exist\nin space (Leech 2013). He also dismisses the view (having previously\nheld it himself, Reid 2003), which he calls holenmerianism,\nthat the immortal soul exists in its entirety in every part of the\nhuman body. This is the traditional view in Christian theology, which\nholds that the soul is in all parts of the body (since all parts are\nalive), but as the soul is indivisible it cannot be extended through\nthe body (otherwise a severed arm might contain part of the soul,\nseparated from the rest of the soul), but must exist everywhere as a\nwhole (and evidently immediately abandons a severed limb). Again, this\nis a notion of physical presence which clouds More’s claims\nabout the straightforward relationship between existence and space,\nand so must also be dismissed (Henry 1986; Reid 2003, 2012; Leech\n2013). Indeed, More’s objection to holenmerianism, as with\nnullibism, was that it is nonsensical and merely likely to make the\ncommon reader dismiss it out of hand, and by extension, dismiss the\nconcept of soul (Henry 1986, 191–92). \nIn More’s mature philosophy, then, there was a strict dichotomy\nbetween matter and spirit but that dichotomy was not defined,\nas it was in Cartesianism, in terms of extension and non-extension.\nBecause More was committed to the idea that all real entities must\nexist in space, spirit, no less than body, was extended. Accordingly,\nbody was defined as “A Substance impenetrable and\ndiscerpible”, and spirit as “A Substance penetrable and\nindiscerpible”. Discerpible and indiscerpible, neologisms of\nMore’s, mean capable of being physically separated into parts,\nand incapable of being separated into parts, respectively. Presumably\nMore preferred his new terms because, for those readers who knew\nLatin, it conveyed a notion of tearing a piece off. More perhaps\nwanted to avoid objections to the indivisibility of extended spirits\nof the kind levelled against the concept of atoms: if an atom has\ndimensions, however small, it is conceptually divisible, even\nif atomists wish to claim it is physically indivisible. More conceded\nthat an extended spirit could be conceptually divided, but his point\nwas that it is impossible (even in thought) to grab hold of a spirit\nand tear a piece off it. If you are thinking in those terms, you are\nnot thinking properly about the nature of spirit. The other major\ndistinguishing feature of body and spirit, of course, as we have seen,\nwas that bodies were inert and passive, and immaterial spirits were\nnaturally active, and indeed increasingly responsible, throughout\nMore’s career, for any activity in the world (Henry 1986; Reid\n2003, 2012; Leech 2013).  \nAs well as believing that everything must exist in space, More also\nbelieved that everything must exist in time. Furthermore, time, like\nspace, is a real absolute thing which cannot possibly not exist.\nAssuming the world to be not much over 5,000 years old (in accordance\nwith the standard view), More insisted that if God annihilated the\nworld after 1000 years and then had recreated it a thousand years ago,\nthere must have been a gap “of above three thousand yeare”\n(Nicolson 1992, 487). Just as the existence of space cannot be\n“dis-imagined”, so the existence of time cannot be\ndis-imagined. Accordingly, like space, time is conceived of as an\nattribute of God: God’s existence entails the existence of\nspace, and the existence of time (Thomas 2018, 51). Infinite space and\ninfinite duration are said to be “certain adulterated\nrepresentations of the divine eternity and immensity”\n(adulterinas quasdam esse Aeternitatis Immensitatisque Divinae\nRepraesentationes) (More 1675–79, 172; Thomas 2018,\n54). \nJust as God’s proposed extension had to be protected from\ncharges that he must therefore be divisible (by introducing the\nconcept of indiscerpibility), so his existence in time had to be\nprotected from charges that his existence must be successive (and\ntherefore susceptible to change from moment to moment) (Thomas 2018,\n38). More insisted, accordingly, that God’s existence was not\nsuccessive, but that his existence somehow transcended time and was\npresent to all eternity all at once (Thomas 2018, 34). It has been\nsuggested, therefore, that with regard to time or duration, More\naccepted a holenmeristic view that God could be entirely “in\nevery moment yet is not spread out in time” (Thomas 2018, 45).\nHolenmerism with regard to space is the view that God is entirely in\nthe whole of space and entirely in every tiny part of space;\nso, it cannot be equated with the view that he is entirely in every\ntiny part of time, but is not in the whole of time. It is by\nno means clear, therefore, that “whilst More rejected\nholenmerism for divine spatial presence, he maintained it for divine\ntemporal presence” (Thomas 2018, 45). We should bear in\nmind that “holenmerism” was a neologism coined by More and\nhe applied it only to claims about spatial occupation. To say that God\nis everywhere in his entirety and in every part of space (be it never\nso small) in his entirety is clearly an absurd claim, a “mad\nJingle”, as More said (1662, Immortality of the Soul,\nseparately paginated, 43). But to say that all moments of time, past,\npresent, and future, are simultaneously present to an eternal God,\nwhile certainly puzzling, does not seem so obviously contradictory.\nThe historical fact is, More’s view of God’s relationship\nto time was fairly standard among contemporary theologians, and should\nnot be compared with his highly radical and unheard of view of\nGod’s relationship to space (Grant 1981, 223). \nReturning to the Enchiridion metaphysicum, as in the\nAntidote Against Atheism, and the Immortality of the\nSoul, More also draws upon various physical phenomena which he\nbelieves cannot be explained in terms of the mechanical philosophy,\nand can only be understood if some other factor is at work, namely the\nSpirit of Nature. More included an example drawn from the series of\nexperiments Boyle had conducted using the newly invented air-pump, and\nwhich he had published in 1660. It is essentially the experiment\ndescribed in the Immortality of the Soul, in which the piston\nof the pump lifts a heavy weight (this time 100 pounds, rather than\nten), against gravity. The crucial difference is that here it is\nexplicitly described as Boyle did it, and explicitly named as\nBoyle’s experiment. \nAlthough More clearly believed he was engaged in establishing the true\nreligion, and the true philosophy to support it, not everyone agreed.\nAs soon as the Somerset virtuoso, John Beale (1608–1683), saw\nit, he wrote to Henry Oldenburg, Secretary of the Royal Society, in\nstrident tones: \nThe chastisement came in Boyle’s Hydrostatical\nDiscourse of 1672. Furthermore, it is evident from Boyle’s\ncomments that he objected not only to More’s bad physics, but\nalso to what he saw as potentially divisive theology. After all, Boyle\npointed out, even “Heathen Philosophers” were convinced by\ntheir studies of nature of the existence of God, and they had no need\nto suppose an intermediary Spirit of Nature: “taking no notice\nof an immaterial principium hylarchicum, they believed things\nto be managed in a mere physical way according to the General Laws,\nsettled [by God] among things Corporeal, acting upon one\nanother” (Boyle 1999, 184). Boyle believed in incorporeal\nsubstance but objected to the attempt to prove its existence by\nrelying on a “precarious Principle” such as the Spirit of\nNature (Boyle 1999, 184). \nBoyle was not alone in his criticisms. Sir Mathew Hale took time off\nfrom his legal studies to publish two critiques, which More tried to\nanswer in his Remarks upon two late ingenious Discourses\n(1676). Somehow Lady Conway heard that “Mr Boyle sayes you had\nbetter never have printed it, for you are mistaken in all your\nexperiments” (Nicolson 1992, 420). The German physicist, Johann\nChristoph Sturm (1635–1703) dismissed More’s\ninterpretation of Boyle’s experiments in 1676 in Epistola ad\nVirum Celeberrimum Henricum Morum de Spiritu ipsius Hylarchio.\nRobert Hooke took the opportunity to reject More’s views in his\nLampas: or, Descriptions of some Mechanical Improvements of Lamps\n& Waterpoises of 1677. \nIt is known that Boyle was intermittently writing a study throughout\nthese years of the various different concepts of Nature at use in\ndifferent discourses. When this finally appeared in print in 1686 as\nthe Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature,\nMore’s ideas were included as a target for Boyle’s\ncritical barbs. But Boyle did not just attack More’s views on\nthe Spirit of Nature, he also took the opportunity to dismiss\nMore’s necessitarian theology, in favour of his own voluntarist\ntheology: \nBoyle was not the clearest writer and often garbled his arguments but\nthe implication here (seen more clearly in the claim that he created\nthe world as he pleased than in the claim that he was not obliged to\nany creature) is that God did not have to create a world in accordance\nwith pre-established values of goodness (Henry 1990). Certainly, he\nhad already denied the claim that God had been obliged to create the\nbest of all possible worlds: \nIn October 1670 More was visited at Cambridge by Francis Mercury van\nHelmont (1614–1698), son of the famous iatrochemist, Jan\nBaptista van Helmont (1579–1644), and a student of Jewish\nKabbalah. More asked van Helmont if he would visit Anne, Lady Conway,\nwith a view to trying to treat the incessant debilitating headache\nwhich had troubled her for many years. As a result of meeting Anne,\nvan Helmont became her resident physician, living at Ragley Hall in\nWarwickshire, where More himself was a frequent visitor. Van Helmont\nwas a friend and collaborator of the leading Christian cabbalist of\nthe day, Christian Knorr von Rosenroth (1631–1689), and More now\nhad the opportunity to learn about the Jewish Kabbalah. It should be\nnoted that although his own version of the cabbala, as published in\nhis Conjectura Cabbalistica (1653), was nothing more than a\nmethod of scriptural interpretation of his own invention, More\nnevertheless felt that the original Jewish Kabbalah, deriving\nultimately from Moses, was the true source of the philosophical\ntheology which More had managed to “reconstruct”. \nIt came as quite a shock to More, therefore, to learn through van\nHelmont and through correspondence with von Rosenroth that the\nKabbalah, as developed especially by the leading sixteenth-century\nKabbalist, Isaac Luria (1534–1572), was a long way from what he\nhad imagined. Its “invincible obscurity” was distasteful\nto More’s rationalist sensibilities, and he also discerned\nmonistic materialism in it, and even identification of God with\nnature. More’s critical writings on Lurianic Kabbalah were\nincluded by von Rosenroth in his Kabbala denudata of 1677,\nand included by More in his Opera omnia in 1679 (Coudert\n1992, Crocker 2003, Laerke 2017). \nUnfortunately for More, his failure to be convinced by the spiritual\nworth of mystical Kabbalah contributed to an increasing distance\nbetween him and his great friend Anne Conway. Van Helmont had become\ninterested in Quakerism and introduced Anne to a number of leading\nQuakers, including George Fox (1624–1691), Robert Barclay\n(fl. 1670), George Keith (1638?–1716), and William Penn\n(1644–1718). Evidently the Quakers favoured the Kabbalah and\nAnne, increasingly favoured the Quakers. During this time Anne was\nwriting her own philosophical system which was published posthumously\nas The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy\n(1690 in Latin, 1692 in English). It is essentially a monistic system\nin which all things are made of spirit, and she criticises during the\ncourse of it not only the materialism of Hobbes and Spinoza, but also\nthe dualism of Descartes, and her erstwhile mentor, More (Conway 1996,\nHutton 2004). It seems clear that Anne was growing intellectually, and\nspiritually, away from More, and seems to have regarded her new Quaker\nfriends, a number of whom evidently now colonised Ragley Hall, as\ncloser to her own developing beliefs. A letter from Lord Conway of\n1677 even says that the Quakers in the Hall “have free access to\nmy wife, but I believe Dr. More, though he was in the house all the\nlast summer, did not see her above twice or thrice” (Nicolson\n1992, 439–40). More himself during this period seems to have\nbeen torn between trying to dissuade her from joining the Quakers, and\nrespect for Anne’s carefully thought-out decision to embrace\ntheir teachings. Indeed, More even showed a grudging respect for the\nQuakers themselves, who were obviously serious and sincere, and in\nsome respects their enthusiasms matched his own tendencies in that\ndirection. \nIt is perhaps worth noting also that John Finch, More’s former\nstudent and Anne’s half-brother, also moved away from\nMore’s way of thinking at this time. During his time in Turkey\nas a diplomat (1674–1681), Finch wrote a large manuscript\nTreatise of natural philosophy which remains unpublished.\nFinch’s philosophy is materialist and based on an empiricist\nepistemology, and is highly critical of many of More’s views.\nRejecting More’s dualism, Finch takes an almost Hobbesian line,\nbut couples it with fideism in religion: we cannot prove the existence\nof God or immaterial substances by the use of reason and so must trust\nin the Gospels (Crocker 2003). \nIf nothing else, the fact that two such close admirers of More as John\nFinch and Anne Conway both came to reject his philosophy shows not\nonly that his philosophy was not as cogent and compelling as he\nthought, but also that his attempt to use philosophy in the service of\nreligion was increasingly seen (as it was by Joseph Beaumont, Samuel\nParker, John Beale, Robert Boyle, and others) as not only\nunconvincing, but even subversive of sound religion. Indeed it has\nrecently been suggested (Leech 2013) that More’s determined\nefforts to provide a supposedly unassailable philosophical theology\nunintentionally contributed to disaffection with religion, and the\nrise of secularism and even atheism. If More’s vigorously\nproposed philosophical theology, with its claims about souls, spirits,\nspace, and so forth, could be equally vigorously denied by his fellow\nreligionists, the contemporary onlooker could hardly be blamed for\ndeveloping a sceptical response to religion in general. The inability\nof religious believers to agree among themselves as to what is the\n“true” religion has been seen as a major factor in the\nrise of secularism, and has been dubbed “theological\nfratricide”. Ironically, it was the passion and persistence with\nwhich More promoted his own version of philosophical theology which\nled to him being a prominent (though unwitting) participant in that\n“fratricide” (Leech 2013, 8, 233). \nMore knew, from the time he wrote his Antidote Against\nAtheism, that Descartes’s philosophy was being appropriated\nby atheists for their own purposes. It must have been with some dismay\nthat he realised this was a rising tide which his own writings did\nnothing to quell. And then, as if Cartesian atheism and Hobbesianism\nwere not enough, he heard in the 1670s of new threats to sound\nreligion. One of these was Spinozism, which appalled More as much as\nit did every other devout believer. The other atheistic threat, dubbed\nhylozoism by More, was represented by the much less well known English\nmedical writer, Francis Glisson (1597–1677), formerly Regius\nprofessor of Physick (i.e. medicine) at Cambridge. \nMore wrote two short attacks on Spinoza, one against the Tractatus\ntheologico-politicus (1670), which More read in 1677, and one\nagainst the “two pillars” of Spinoza’s atheism, the\nnecessary existence of substance and that there is only one substance.\nMore, like others among his contemporaries, saw Spinoza as taking\nCartesianism to a predictably atheistic extreme. Misled by\nDescartes’s identification of extension with matter, Spinoza\nconcluded that there was only one substance, matter. More was writing\nbefore the term pantheism became current and so he saw Spinoza’s\nidentification of this one substance with God simply as atheism.\nSpinoza confused the divine nature with the nature of created things,\naccording to More, and this was tantamount to atheism. In his\nconfutation of Spinoza More adopted Descartes’s ontological\nargument for the existence of God, based on God’s absolute\nperfection, to insist that matter cannot be an Ens summe et\nabsolute perfectum, and so cannot be identified with God.\nIronically, however, More’s near identification of God with\nspace, and his insistence on the spatial extension of God, which many\ncontemporaries saw as a materialist position (Henry 1986), led a\nnumber of Enlightenment philosophers, most notably Cristian Wolff\n(1679–1754), to see him as sharing in a number of the same\nerrors as Spinoza (Leech 2013). \nMore seems to have written both of his anti-Spinozistic tracts\nhurriedly, as he was preparing the Latin translations of his works for\ninclusion in the second and third volumes of his Opera omnia\nin 1679 (volume 1 had already appeared in 1675). Indeed, he told Anne\nConway that he “could not forbeare” from confuting Spinoza\nwhile he was still in the process of reading him. Both of these\ncritiques of Spinoza, were included at the end of volume two and there\nis little evidence that they made any impression on contemporary\nreaders (Hutton 1984, Henry 1987). In the attack on Spinoza’s\nTractatus, however, More included an attempted refutation of\nthe claims of Francis Glisson (which More likened to Spinoza’s\nviews) that all matter, whether animate or inanimate, is capable of\nperception, is appetitive, and therefore in some sense alive. This did\nattract critical attention. \nGlisson had arrived at his position as a result of physiological\nresearch on the stomach and intestines, in which he noticed that these\nand other parts of the body were sensitive to touch even though there\nwere no nerves present. This is the phenomenon now known as\nirritability, but in his efforts to explain it Glisson had developed a\ngeneral theory of matter and body and had published it in his\nTreatise on the Energetic Nature of Substance (Tractatus\nde natura substantiae energetica, seu, de vita naturae,\n1672). \nMore’s attack on Glisson drew a response from the leading\nPresbyterian divine, Richard Baxter (1615–1691) (Henry 1987,\nSytsma 2017). Glisson had been Baxter’s physician, so presumably\nBaxter knew him not to be an atheist, but Baxter was not motivated to\ndefend Glisson merely by friendship. As a Calvinist, Baxter subscribed\nto a voluntarist theology and was appalled by the implications of\nMore’s necessitarian theology. More’s rejection of\nGlisson’s theory depended upon his claim that matter had to be\nnecessarily inert and that only spirit could be\nself-active—according to More, not even God could change this,\nbecause it was inherent in the very nature of matter that it must be\ninert, and definitive of spirit that it must be active. For Baxter\nthis was an intolerable circumscription of God’s omnipotence on\nthe mere whim of an all too fallible thinker. In a letter to More\nwritten in 1681, Baxter said, \nAs Baxter made clear, he was unimpressed by More’s claim that\nGlisson’s view might lead to a denial of the existence of God\nand the immortality of the soul. For Baxter, More’s claim that\n“God cannot do this” was just as likely to lead to atheism\n(Baxter 1682, 29). \nMore published Baxter’s letter and his reply to it, An\nAnswer to a Letter of a Learned Psychopyrist, in his edition of\nJoseph Glanvill’s Saducismus Triumphatus of 1682.\nGlanvill, one of More’s most devoted followers, had died before\nhe could produce his response to the anti-witchcraft treatise of John\nWebster (1611–1682), The Displaying of Supposed\nWitchcraft (1677), which had attacked Glanvill’s earlier\nbooks on the reality of witchcraft (Crocker 2003). But\nGlanvill’s books on witchcraft were largely intended as\ncontributions to More’s own long standing campaign for proving\nthe existence of a spiritual realm by anecdotal evidence, and so More\nsaw the work through the press. He took the opportunity, however, to\nadd his own most recent attempts to impress his theories on the\nreading public, including his response to Baxter, an English\ntranslation of two chapters from the Enchiridion metaphysicum\n(chapters 27 and 28) which defined the nature of spirit, and yet more\nstories of witchcraft and apparitions which More himself had\ncollected. \nMore published another work of Glanvill’s at this time, his\nLux orientalis, a survey of early views on the pre-existence\nof souls, again intended by Glanvill as a contribution to More’s\nown religious campaign. This was published together with George\nRust’s Discourse of Truth in a work which More\nentitled, Two Choice and Useful Treatises (1682). Rust had\nbeen a student of More’s in the 1650s and had remained a devoted\nfollower while developing his own Origenian theology. More’s\nannotations to Rust’s Discourse included a lengthy\nreply to Baxter’s response to An Answer to a… Learned\nPsychopyrist (Henry 1987, Hengstermann 2017). \nThe short pieces in these two collections represent More’s final\ncontributions to philosophical theology. Otherwise his final years\nwere devoted to works on the interpretation of the prophetic books of\nthe Bible. \nIt seems fair to say that although More had a small number of\nlike-minded and devoted followers during his own lifetime, his\nphilosophical theology was for the most part regarded with suspicion\nby his contemporaries. Even some of those who had been tutored by him,\nand who admired him personally, most notably John Finch and Anne\nConway, could not go along with his claims about the necessity of a\ndualistic ontology. For those who failed to share More’s\nnecessitarian theology, such as Boyle and Baxter, More’s views\nwere dangerous to religion. There were others, however, who believed\nthat More’s dichotomy between passive matter and active spirit\nwas invaluable for combatting atheism. It was More’s\nanti-atheistic stratagem which lay behind the rejection of John\nLocke’s speculation about the possibility of thinking matter by\nthe Bishop of Worcester, Edward Stillingfleet (1635–1699). If\nmatter could think, then the dichotomy between passive matter and\nactive spirit did not hold, and it would be impossible (the Bishop\nthought) to use the presence of activity in the world to establish the\nexistence of a necessarily spiritual realm. Locke, like Baxter, merely\nobjected that Stillingfleet’s insistence that not even God could\nmake matter capable of thinking, undermined God’s omnipotence,\nand thereby was likely to undermine the faith (Henry 2011). Samuel\nClarke took More’s distinction between inert matter and active\nspirit even further, insisting that not even God could endow bodies\nwith active powers, and developing what has been called “partial\noccasionalism” (Sangiacomo 2018). Effectively, therefore, where\nnatural phenomena were concerned, Clarke replaced More’s Spirit\nof Nature, “the vicarious Power of God”, with the direct\naction of God himself, or his angels (Henry 2020; see also Thomas\n2018). \nIt was only really after his death that More’s reputation began\nto rise, at least in Britain. There was renewed interest in his\nwritings in the early eighteenth century, when More’s\ncombination of rationalism with a passionate, almost enthusiastic,\nfaith must have proved heartening to churchmen living in an age of\ndeism. The natural theology which flourished in the age after Isaac\nNewton led to an increased emphasis on rationalism in religion but it\nwas important for the clergy to avoid descending into deism, and to\ncombine their natural theologies with a belief in Scripture, and with\nwhat More would have called the “Grand Mysteries” of\nreligion. His reputation was also helped by the fact that he was seen\nas a prominent member of the early Latitudinarians, and as this\nrational and liberal approach to belief became dominant, More could be\nseen as one of the movement’s heroes. Furthermore, while More\nhad been trying to promote necessitarian theology at a time when\nvoluntarist theology was very much in the ascendant (especially in\nCalvinist countries), the eighteenth century saw a reversal, and\nnecessitarian theology came to the fore, as represented seriously in\nAlexander Pope’s Essay on Man, and satirically in\nVoltaire’s Candide. As the eighteenth century\nprogressed More’s reputation as a theologian, if not as a\nphilosopher, became assured and it has remained high ever since\n(Taliaferro 2005). \nIn more recent scholarship More has been seen as a significant\ninfluence upon Isaac Newton, particularly his ideas on absolute space,\nand this, together with his role in introducing Cartesianism into\nEngland, has assured his continual inclusion in histories of science\nof the period. Newton certainly knew More personally in Cambridge, and\nowned and read a significant number of More’s books. A\nmanuscript copy of the correspondence between More and Descartes,\ncompiled before Clerselier’s edition of Descartes’s\ncorrespondence (1657), has recently been found among Newton’s\npersonal papers (Hutton 2020). They also shared a profound interest in\nthe interpretation of the prophetic scriptures (Hutton 1994). It seems\nundeniable that Newton read and was influenced by More’s views\non space and time, as presented in the Enchiridion\nmetaphysicum (Koyré 1957, Grant 1981, Hall 1990). Like\nMore, Newton also believed that for something to exist it must exist\nin space, and he identified the immensity of infinite space with the\nextension of God (Grant 1981). Similarly, in the “General\nScholium”, which he added to the second edition of his\nPrincipia mathematica (1713), Newton wrote that God “by\nexisting always and everywhere he constitutes duration and space,\neternity, and infinity” (Newton 1999, 941; Hall 1990, Henry\n1993). It seems certain that Newton took some salient ideas from More,\nbut he was by no means a complete disciple. It is highly unlikely that\nNewton would have admired More’s natural philosophy, and\ncertainly, like Boyle, Hooke, and other natural philosophers, he\nrejected More’s Spirit of Nature. Nor did they share similar\nreligious views. Newton disagreed with More’s interpretation of\nthe Book of Daniel and the Revelation, and Newton was very much a\nvoluntarist in his theology and so would have been opposed to\nMore’s necessitarianism (Henry 1990). Even so, the similarities\nbetween their views of space and time, and their relationship to God,\nguarantees More’s place in the history of science.
