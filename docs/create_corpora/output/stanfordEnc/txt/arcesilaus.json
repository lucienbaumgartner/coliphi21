He initiated the skeptical\nphase of the Platonic school (‘Academic skepticism’) and was an\ninfluential critic of Stoic epistemology.\n\n\n\nThe ancient evidence about Arcesilaus' philosophy is difficult to\nevaluate and, in some respects, inconsistent. As a result, scholars\ninterpret his skepticism in several ways. Some see his philosophical\nactivity as entirely negative or destructive of all philosophical\nviews. Others regard him as endorsing the position that nothing can be\nknown on the basis of philosophical arguments he is committed to. This\nwould make his skepticism similar to Descartes' at the start of the\nMeditations, where he doubts everything he previously thought\nhe knew. Others take him to have held no positive views on any\nphilosophical topic, including the possibility of knowledge. On this\nview, his skepticism is very similar to the Pyrrhonian skepticism\nadvocated by Sextus Empiricus: the skeptic is someone who refuses to\naccept any philosophical theory or proposition as rationally warranted,\nand insists that further examination is always required.\n\n\n\nAfter an early education in geometry and astronomy in his native\nPitanê (in Aeolis, the northwest Aegean coast of modern Turkey),\nArcesilaus escaped to Athens against his guardian's wishes. There he\nis said to have studied rhetoric in association with Theophrastus\n(Aristotle's successor) until c. 295-290 BCE, when he abandoned it to\nstudy philosophy in Plato's Academy with Crantor (d. 276/5) and its\nleaders Polemo (d. 270/69) and Crates (d.268/7). He became the\nscholarch after Crates' death, and led the school for more than 25\nyears until his own death in 241/0 BCE. \n\nLike Socrates, his philosophical model, and Carneades, who carried\nforward his skepticism in the 2nd c. BCE, Arcesilaus did\nnot write any philosophical works. His arguments were initially\npreserved by his students — including Pythodorus, who wrote up\nsome of them, and Lakydes, his successor as scholarch — and in\nthe work of his opponents, most notably, the Stoic Chrysippus, whose\nreformulation of Stoicism was prompted by Arcesilaus' criticisms of\nthe views of the first generation of Stoics. But Arcesilaus' arguments\nwere later overlaid by Carneadean elaborations and subsumed into the\ngeneral Academic and anti-Academic traditions; and it is only through\nthose later traditions that we know about them. Our knowledge of his\nwork depends on scraps from the biographical tradition (preserved in\nDiogenes Laertius and Philodemus) and brief general reports from later\nskeptical writers — Cicero and Sextus Empiricus and Plutarch\n— and their opponents — Antiochus and Numenius (preserved\nin Cicero and Eusebius respectively). And since these offer\nincompatible interpretations of Arcesilaus' philosophical position\nreflecting the writers' distinctive views about later developments in\nthe skeptical Academy, the precise nature of his skepticism remains\ncontroversial. \n\nThe central question presented by the inconsistent evidence for\nArcesilaus' skepticism is how to reconcile his dialectical method with\nthe ‘doctrines’ he is reported to have accepted — viz.,\nthat nothing can be known (akatalêpsia) and that one\nshould suspend assent universally (universal epochê),\ni.e., form no beliefs. Our sources agree that Arcesilaus' dialectical\nmethod constituted the core of his philosophical activity (see e.g.,\nDiogenes Laertius 4.28). This method presents two basic difficulties\nfor any attempt to reconcile it with these doctrines. \n\nFirst, the dialectical method meant that rather than arguing in favor\nof any doctrine or set of doctrines, Arcesilaus restricted himself to\narguing against the views proposed by his opponents or\ninterlocutors. At first sight, this method may not look incompatible\nwith affirming akatalêpsia and\nuniversal epochê since the repeated result of practicing\nit was that the views argued against did not stand up to criticism.\nThese repeated failures could suggest that in fact nothing can be\nknown and that one should form no beliefs at all. But our sources\nconfirm that Arcesilaus took his method to entail that he should not\nreveal his own view on the matter in question in any case, if he had\none, including, for instance, the view that the claim argued against\nis false (see e.g., Cicero De oratore 3.67). It is clear that\nhe went to some lengths not to make positive affirmations of any sort\nin his own right in his arguments (see Diogenes Laertius 4.36,\nPhilodemus Index Academicorum 20.1-4, cf. 18.40-19.9). \n\nWe can see why Arcesilaus' dialectical method may have had these\nimplications by looking at the model he claimed to be following:\nSocrates' practice in the Socratic dialogues of Plato (see Cicero,\nAcademica 1.44-5, De oratore 3.67, De\nfinibus 2.2, On the Nature of the Gods 1.11). In those\ndialogues, Socrates challenges the pretensions of his interlocutors to\nknowledge by showing, through premises they accept, that they are\ncommitted to inconsistent beliefs. To achieve this result, it is\ncrucial that the arguments — the premises, the inferences, and\nthe conclusions — depend entirely on the beliefs of the\ninterlocutors. If they do, the result of a successful Socratic\nencounter will be that the interlocutor is at a loss: the\ninterlocutors now recognize that they have inconsistent beliefs, since\nthey have both their initial reasons for the thesis or knowledge-claim\nthey made and their newly-discerned reasons against it. If they also\nhold some generally accepted views about knowledge (for example, that\none can't know something about which one holds inconsistent beliefs),\nthe interlocutors will be rationally constrained to aver that they\ndon't know whether their thesis is true or false, and hence to suspend\nassent on the thesis while awaiting further investigation and\nargument. But no such result holds for Socrates. For, although he\nrepresents himself as being in the same aporetic boat — and may\nin fact be perplexed for exactly the same reasons — his method\ndoes not commit him to the premises, inferences or conclusions of the\narguments, or even to the regulating ideas about knowledge. His views\n(if he has any) are not at issue in the argument. \n\nThere is good evidence that Arcesilaus followed the Socratic model\nconsistently and refrained from making any positive arguments or even\naffirmations of any kind. Our most detailed sources actually identify\nthe radical change of position in the Platonic school he introduced\n— the transition from the Old to the skeptical Academy —\nin terms of his adoption of this method (see Diogenes Laertius 4.28,\nPhilodemus Index Academicorum 18.7-16 & 21.36-42 and\nSextus Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.220-35, esp. 232). And this\nexplains his reputation as a ‘dialectician’ (or, more\nnegatively, as a ‘sophist’ or ‘eristic’ or\n‘magician’), as well as why the skeptical Academy came to\nbe defined primarily by its critical stance towards the doctrines of\nother schools (and particularly towards the energetic philosophical\nprograms of the new movements initiated by Epicurus and Zeno during\nhis lifetime). But if Arcesilaus followed this model consistently by\narguing against every philosophical position that came to his notice\nand refraining from making any positive arguments or affirmations on\nany philosophical question, it is hard to see why we should think that\nhe accepted any doctrines, including akatalêpsia and\nuniversal epochê. \n\nThe second difficulty involved in reconciling Arcesilaus' dialectical\nmethod with the doctrines that nothing can be known and that we should\nsuspend assent universally is more straight-forward.  These doctrines\nare conclusions of some of his best known arguments, but these are\nclearly dialectical anti-Stoic arguments. That is, they are arguments\nthat depend crucially on Stoic premises: they argue that, despite the\nStoics' general epistemological commitments, certain premises accepted\nby the Stoics entail that nothing is known, and that we should suspend\nassent universally. (See below, sect. 3.) But, given his Socratic\nmethod, we would only have reason to ascribe these conclusions to\nArcesilaus himself if we had independent evidence that he accepted\nthose premises. And there is good reason to think that Arcesilaus did\nnot accept anything of Stoic epistemology. \n\nThe first question about Arcesilaus' skepticism is thus whether it\ninvolved any commitment to the doctrines of akatalêpsia\nand universal epochê at all. A negative answer to this\nquestion — based on something like the considerations given\nabove — yields a dialectical interpretation of Arcesilaus\n(adopted by e.g., Couissin 1929 and Striker 1980). The drawback to\nthis interpretation is that it involves the rejection of a central\nclaim about him in all but one of our major sources: Cicero, Numenius,\nSextus, Diogenes and Plutarch ascribe some degree of commitment to at\nleast one of these doctrines, the doctrine of universal\nepochê. The exception is Philodemus. Rejecting this\nevidence might be justified by the lateness of these sources and their\nassociations with later Academic developments; but this seems hard to\nmaintain when we learn that Arcesilaus' contemporary opponents,\nincluding Chrysippus, also ascribed universal epochê to\nhim (see Plutarch On Stoic Self-Contradictions 1036a with\n1037a, and Against Colotes 1122a). \n\nIf we accept that the evidence constrains us to look for a positive\nanswer to the first question (at least as regards the recommendation\nof epochê), the second question is how to reconcile\nArcesilaus' method with his commitment to these doctrines. The answer\nto this question remains open. But the dominant solutions on offer\nfall roughly into two main groups: first an Academic\ninterpretation, based on the evidence of Cicero and Numenius, which\nargues that Arcesilaus was led to adopt his method by his prior\nacceptance of (at least one of) the doctrines (this solution is\nadopted by e.g., Schofield 1999 and Ioppolo 1986); and, secondly, a\nSocratic interpretation, based primarily on Sextus, which\nderives Arcesilaus' attenuated commitment to the doctrines from his\napplication of the Socratic method (this solution is adopted by e.g.,\nCooper 2004 and Frede 1974 & 1984). \n\nTo decide between these interpretations of Arcesilaus' skepticism,\nwe need to examine his arguments. \n\nArcesilaus' best known arguments, and the only ones that survive in\nany detail, are his criticisms of Stoic epistemology (Sextus\nAgainst the Logicians M. 7.150-9, Cicero\nAcademica 2 passim, esp. 2.66-7 & 2.77). \n\nThe Stoic theory of knowledge represented a radical shift in\nepistemology, since it offered an empirically-based route to the kind\nof wisdom Socrates had sought (see Frede 1999). Its basis was three\nnovel claims made by Zeno, the founder of the Stoa (see Cicero\nAcademica 1.40-2). First, Zeno proposed a new psychological\ntheory: to form a belief of any kind is to give one's assent to one's\n‘impression’ (or appearance: phantasia) about the\nmatter. Secondly, he claimed that some of our perceptual impressions\nare ‘cognitive’ or self-warranting, so that assenting to\nthem constitutes a cognition or grasp (katalêpsis) of\ntheir objects. And, thirdly, he argued that we ought to restrict our\nassent to just cognitive or kataleptic impressions, since it is\ncontrary to reason to form (true or false) ‘opinions’ by\nassenting to inadequately warranted, non-cognitive impressions. But,\ngiven that there are cognitive impressions, we can attain infallible\nknowledge or wisdom by restricting our assent to them, since our\nbeliefs will then be constituted entirely by cognitions derived from\nperception or from concepts warranted by perceptual cognitions. \n\nThe focus of Arcesilaus' attack on Zeno's theory was its center-piece,\nthe theory of cognitive impressions. Zeno defined a cognitive\nimpression as one that came from what is stamped and impressed exactly\nin accordance with it, and was such that it could not be false (Sextus\nM. 7.248, Cicero Academica 2.77) — i.e.,\nroughly, that an impression is cognitive if [a] it is true, [b] it is\ncaused in the appropriate way for correctly representing its object,\nand [c] its truth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail\nof representation guaranteed by its causal history. Arcesilaus' tactic\nwas to grant that conditions [a] and [b] are often met, as Zeno\nclaimed, but to argue that condition [c] never obtained (M.\n7.154, Academica 2.77). Although his detailed arguments for\nthis have not survived, it is fairly clear from later Academic and\nStoic arguments that he followed two main lines of attack. One line\ndepended on the existence of indistinguishable — or, at any\nrate, indiscernibly distinct — objects, such as twins, or pairs\nof eggs, manufactured items (statues or impressions on wax of the same\nletter-seal), and grains of sand (Academica 2.54-8 &\n2.84-6, M. 7.408-10). Any of these could be mistaken for\nanother no matter how good one's impression of it was. The second\ndepended on abnormal states of mind, such as dreams, illusions, and\nfits of madness (Academica 2.47-53 & 2.88-90, M.\n7.402-8). In either case, Arcesilaus argued that, whether the nature\nof the objects or of our minds were at fault, it was always possible\nto have a false impression with exactly the same phenomenal content as\na true impression [a] that also met condition [b]. But if so, no\nimpression could be self-warranting in virtue of the way in which its\ncontent was represented. So condition [c] never obtains.  Hence, on\nthe Stoic view of the requirements for cognition, there is no\ncognition. And if knowledge is derived entirely from perceptual\ncognition and concepts warranted by it, as Zeno supposed, it follows\nthat nothing can be known. (Intricate Stoic-Academic debates on these\nissues lasted for another 150 years; they can best be traced through\nthe arguments of Chrysippus and Carneades, preserved in some detail in\nCicero's Academica and Sextus M. book 7.) \n\nThe argument is standardly summarized as follows: \n\nAnd, since for Zeno knowledge itself depends on cognitive\nimpressions, this argument leads to the further conclusion that nothing\ncan be known (akatalêpsia). \n\nArcesilaus followed up this argument against the cognitive\nimpression with a briefer argument against Zeno's ideal of wisdom: \n\nThat is, Arcesilaus pointed out to the Stoics that if his argument\n[1]-[5] against condition [c] of the definition of the cognitive\nimpression is successful, they are also committed to the conclusion\nthat it is rational to suspend assent universally (universal\nepochê). \n\nThese arguments are presented in two very different ways in our two\nsources. In Sextus' account (followed above), they are presented as\nexplicitly dialectical arguments, relying on clearly marked Stoic\nviews, and leading to the conclusion that the Stoic sage will have no\nbeliefs. In the report of Cicero (who was himself an adherent of\nAcademic philosophy), however, we are informed that Arcesilaus was\ncommitted to the conclusions of both arguments: Arcesilaus believed\nthat condition [c] of the Stoic definition of the cognitive impression\ncould never be met, and hence concluded that nothing can be known; and\nhe believed premises [5] and [6] of the second argument, and hence\nconcluded that assent to any impression was irrational\n(Academica 2.66-7 & 2.77). And this historical version of\nthe Academic interpretation of Arcesilaus' skepticism is supported\nelsewhere in Cicero with a view of the history of philosophy that has\nArcesilaus following Socrates (and Presocratic philosophers such as\nDemocritus, Parmenides and Empedocles) in concluding that nothing can\nbe known by perception or reason, and hence adopting a method of\nargument that would lead others to refrain from all assent\n(Academica 1.43-6; but see Cooper 2004). \n\nBut this historically Academic interpretation is liable to two\nserious objections. The first is that the argument against the\nexistence of cognitive impressions only leads to the conclusion that\nnothing can be known if one subscribes to the Stoic epistemological\nframework as a whole. For the conclusion doesn't follow unless it is\ntrue that there are impressions, that some are true, that there are no\nother routes to cognition, that the Stoic definition of cognition gives\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge, etc. But there is no\nreason to think that Arcesilaus subscribed to these Stoic views, since\nwe have slight, but sufficient evidence that he argued against every\naspect of Stoic epistemology and psychology. Plutarch, for instance,\nmentions an objection to the Stoic theory of the soul's interaction\nwith the body, which implies that Arcesilaus argued against the\nfundamental mechanism of perception in Zeno's account (On Common\nConceptions 1078c). Another fragment from Plutarch suggests that\nArcesilaus argued against Zeno's causal theory of perception (Fragment\n215a). And Sextus reports that Arcesilaus also objected to Zeno's\nconception of belief as assent to an impression, on the ground that\nassent is a matter of reason or thinking, rather than the acceptance of\na non-rational ‘impression’ (M. 7.154). \n\nIn these cases, as with his argument against the satisfiability of\ncondition [c] of the Stoic definition, it seems possible to trace a\ndefinite strategy behind Arcesilaus' arguments: he argued against\nZeno's empiricist presuppositions by deploying Platonic objections and\ntheories (see Schofield 1999, von Staden 1978). One might conclude, as\nsome did in antiquity, that Arcesilaus therefore had a hidden objective\nof undermining Stoic or Epicurean empiricism in favor of Platonic\ndoctrine (see Sextus Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.234). But\nArcesilaus' method implies that he would argue against Platonic\ndoctrines as well, if anyone proposed them. So if he did hold the view\nthat nothing can be known, it seems more plausible to think that, like\nSocrates (on some accounts), he held it as a tentative consequence of\nthe success of his arguments against all conceptions of knowledge,\nrather than as the conclusion of an argument relying on a particular\nepistemological theory. \n\nThe second objection to the historical version of the Academic\ninterpretation of Arcesilaus' skepticism is that it is inconsistent.\nThe inconsistency is not in believing that nothing can be known, since,\nunlike Socrates (on this account), Arcesilaus explicitly disclaimed\nsecond-order knowledge of this claim (Cicero Academica 1.45).\nIt lies rather in believing that nothing can be known in conjunction\nwith the belief that it is irrational to hold opinions in the absence\nof knowledge. If the former is true, the latter rules out believing the\npremises of the argument that supports both claims. \n\nThe original Academic interpretation thus seems inadequate to overturn\na dialectical understanding of Arcesilaus' principal anti-Stoic\narguments. Modern proponents of this view, however, offer a more\ncomplicated explanation for Arcesilaus' adherence to\nakatalêpsia, or at least, universal\nepochê (see e.g., Schofield 1999 and Ioppolo 1986). On\nthis version of the Academic interpretation, Arcesilaus' acceptance of\nthese theses is not explained in terms of the straight-forward\nbelief in the premises and conclusions of his arguments, of\nthe sort which would lead a Stoic convinced by Arcesilaus to the\ninconsistent position examined in sect. 4. It is justified instead by\nArcesilaus' ‘practical criterion’ for action, which is\nsupposed to allow him to endorse ‘reasonable’ views\nwithout assent, i.e., without believing them. For if Arcesilaus holds\nthat action is possible on the basis of ‘reasonable’ views\nthat don't amount to belief, his acceptance of\nakatalêpsia or universal epochê can be\nexplained in the same way. So the revised Academic interpretation\nsuggests that these philosophical theses are not beliefs but\n‘reasonable’ or tentative hypotheses that guide\nArcesilaus' philosophical activity. His acceptance of them as\nhypotheses does not require assenting to them. \n\nArcesilaus' argument for a ‘practical criterion’ for\naction is a defence of the possibility of suspending assent\nuniversally given in response to two Stoic objections. The Stoic\nobjections are, first, that life is impossible without assent, since\naction is caused by assent to an impression of something\noikeion, i.e., suited to the agent's nature (Plutarch\nAgainst Colotes 1122a-d, cf. Cicero Academica\n2.37-8); and, secondly, that a good or successful life is impossible\nwithout assent, since a good life requires knowledge and hence assent\n(Sextus M. 7.158; cf. Cicero Academica\n2.39). Arcesilaus' reported replies to these objections are brief, and\naccordingly difficult to interpret (see Bett 1989). His counter to the\nfirst objection is the suggestion that action is possible without\nassent, since even on the Stoic account animal action is triggered\ndirectly by their impressions of something oikeion: the\naddition of a belief that the object is in fact oikeion is\nredundant and liable to be a cause of error. In response to the second\nobjection, however, Arcesilaus argued that the person who suspends\nassent universally will successfully guide his actions by applying his\nsense of what is ‘reasonable’ as a ‘practical\ncriterion’. \n\nThe most promising way to read these brief counter-arguments as a\npositive theory of Arcesilaus' is something like this. The first\nresponse argues that our action isn't always caused by occurrent\nbeliefs — we sometimes act through habit, or by instinct, for\ninstance. By itself, this doesn't go very far, however, since the\nStoics will object that, even if this were possible, this account\ncan't describe the voluntary and responsible actions of a rational\nagent.  (The Stoics defined responsible or voluntary action in terms\nof assent, since this was the mechanism through which our rationality\nacts on the world.) So Arcesilaus enlarges on his account in the\nsecond response: there is space for rationality and responsibility on\nthis view, in the production of the impressions or thoughts motivating\nus when we act — we can act in accordance with what strikes us\nas the reasonable thing to do upon reflection, but still refrain from\nassent, i.e., refrain from forming the belief that this is the right\nthing to do. \n\nThe revised Academic interpretation suggests that this theory of\n‘reasonable’ action represents Arcesilaus' own explanation for\nhis actions, given that he doesn't do them on the basis of knowledge or\nbelief. And, although this is not explicit in the texts, it suggests\nthat Arcesilaus' adherence to the thesis that one should suspend assent\nuniversally is also to be explained as a second-order case of something\nthat seems reasonable, rather than as the inconsistent belief that one\nshould not hold beliefs. \n\nThere are three serious problems with this interpretation. The first\nis that it is not supported by the evidence to which it appeals. In\nSextus, the source for the notion of ‘the reasonable’ as\nthe criterion, this criterion is explicitly marked as one that\nArcesilaus did not adhere to, but constructed as “a counterblast\nto that of the Stoics” (M. 7.150, Bury\ntrans.). (Sextus' later account of Arcesilaus in another work is also\nincompatible with his holding such a theory in his own right; see\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism 1.232-3.)  And Cicero and Numenius,\nour other sources for the historically Academic interpretation of\nArcesilaus, do not mention his adoption of a ‘practical\ncriterion’ — in fact, both authors suggest that\nArcesilaus' position on how one might live without assent was\nindefensible, and required a significant revision under Carneades'\nhands (Academica 2.32 & 2.59; Numenius fr. 27.14-32, cf.\nEusebius Praeparatio Evangelica 14.7.15 [=\n‘Numenius' fr. 26.107-11]). \n\nThe second problem is that even if the context did not show that\nArcesilaus' practical criterion was a dialectical ploy, the argument\nArcesilaus used to support it only makes sense if it is construed\ndialectically. The argument he gives is this: \n\nPremises [8] through [10] present two difficulties for a\nnon-dialectical reading. One is that it is hard to see why Arcesilaus\nshould be committed to them, or how such commitment could be\nconsistent with the doctrine of universal suspension of assent they\nare supposed to justify or at least make compatible with action. For\nthese premises imply that Arcesilaus, like the Stoics, believed that\nsuccess is entirely a matter of making rational (or rationally\ndefensible) choices. But this view — the claim that virtue is\nsufficient for happiness — was the most contentious issue in\nHellenistic ethics (Stoics maintained it, Peripatetics denied it). And\nit is also one that Arcesilaus must have argued against, since it is\nreported that he argued not just against the Stoic theory (see below)\nbut against all ethical views (Philodemus Index Academicorum\n18.40-19.9, Diogenes Laertius 7.171, Numenius fr. 25.154-61,\ncf. fr. 25.41-5). \n\nThe second difficulty is that these premises are manifestly variants\nof the Stoic theory adapted to the Arcesilean context, in which\nnothing can be known and the wise person does not assent to\nanything. The Stoics claimed that a good life is the result of\nperforming ‘appropriate actions' — defined as “those\nthat, once done, have a reasonable defense” — from a\ndisposition of wisdom, i.e., knowledge of what is good, bad and\nneither. But if nothing can be known, as Arcesilaus has already argued\n([5]-[7] in sect. 3, above), the wisdom of the sage consists in not\nhaving any beliefs. This disposition will still allow the sage to\nperform the appropriate actions, however, if, as the Stoics claim,\nthey are defined by reasonable defenses or justifications: for wise\npeople will do what they consider reasonable.  The connection between\nperforming such actions through a wise disposition and success is,\nArcesilaus suggests, something that the Stoics can't deny, because\nthey agree that opinion is the cause of error (this is the\njustification for premise [6] in sect. 3, above). Hence, the perfect\nexercise of our rationality — reflection without assent, as\nArcesilaus has argued — will lead us to find the action that is\nnaturally appropriate to us as rational animals, i.e., the reasonable\nthing to do, and this guarantees success. \n\nThe third problem is that Arcesilaus' positive doctrine appears to\nrest on a hugely implausible claim about our rationality, viz., that it\nis possible to think or reflect, and come up with ‘reasonable’\nconclusions, without assenting to anything, i.e., without having any\nbeliefs of any kind or degree (see Frede 1979, Bett 1989). It is not\nimplausible to argue that we sometimes or often act or think on the\nbasis of tentative views, or on the explicit assumption that something\nis the case (which we don't know or firmly believe). But these actions\nseem possible only within the context of a large web of back-ground\nbeliefs — or within the framework of Stoic beliefs about human\nnature, rationality, and happiness that Arcesilaus playfully deploys in\nthe argument he actually gives. \n\nIf Arcesilaus did not defend the possibility of living without\nbeliefs by advocating a positive theory of action, we need to find\nanother way to explain his attested commitment to the views that\nnothing can be known and that one should not form beliefs. The Socratic\ninterpretation suggests that we should understand the first view as a\nway of expressing the cumulative results of Arcesilaus' method, rather\nthan as the beliefs that motivated it. The suggestion is that, like\nSocrates, Arcesilaus was engaged in a search for the truth about\nphilosophical questions. But, like Socrates, he found that the\narguments in favor of any position were always inadequate, or balanced\nby equally convincing arguments against it (cf. Diogenes Laertius 4.28,\nCicero Academica 1.45). The view that nothing can be known is\nthus not the conclusion of an argument relying on a theory about\nknowledge or our cognitive faculties; it is not a theoretical\nor rationally warranted belief, but just the way things strike him. \n\nIf this is on the right lines, we should also look to features of the\nSocratic method to explain the view that we should not form\nbeliefs. But in this case, it seems that the view does depend —\nat least in part — on a theoretical belief or, at least, a\nphilosophical commitment. For Socratic investigations are motivated by\nthe thought that it is very important to acquire philosophical\nknowledge, indeed, so important that we should not permit ourselves to\nstop inquiring even when we have found a really plausible and\nwell-supported opinion that nonetheless faces unresolved difficulties.\nSeveral sources suggest that this was precisely what motivated\nArcesilaus: Cicero, for instance, stresses repeatedly that he agreed\nwith Zeno that it is irrational to hold opinions, i.e., inadequately\nwarranted assents — premise [6] in sect. 3, above —\n(Academica 2.66-7); and Sextus suggests that he thought that\nindividual cases of suspending assent — presumably in the light\nof inconclusive arguments — were good (Outlines of\nPyrrhonism 1.233). \n\nThe problem with this solution, however, is that it still leaves\nArcesilaus with an inconsistent position. The difficulty now is not\nthat Arcesilaus appears over-committed to Stoic epistemology, as he\nseemed to be on the Academic interpretation, since the present\nassumption is that he shared only premise [6], not their theories of\nperception, belief, cognition, action, virtue and happiness, etc. It is\nrather that even the view that it is irrational to hold (mere) opinions\npresupposes a set of epistemological beliefs (i.e., opinions, assuming\nthat knowledge is inaccessible, or has so far proven to be). If\nArcesilaus is not committed to any set of assumptions about the nature\nand requirements of rationality or about belief and knowledge —\nwhich he ought not to be, given that he had argued against the various\nviews on offer, and hence, ex hypothesi, suspended assent about them\n— it doesn't look like he can consistently believe that it is\nirrational to hold opinions. \n\nBut perhaps we can salvage the Socratic interpretation by applying\nthe notion of a non-theoretical — or rationally unwarranted\n— belief to this view as well. On this version, Arcesilaus begins\nby being motivated by the same pre-theoretical beliefs as Socrates,\ni.e., that philosophical knowledge is important and mere opinion\ninadequate. But one result of his repeated and extensive Socratic\ninvestigations is the realization that even these regulating\nassumptions of his philosophical practice have failed to be warranted,\nand may be incorrect. He has kept on looking for the truth, on the\nassumption that obtaining it is of crucial importance for his life. But\nhe has never obtained it, and it begins to strike him that perhaps he\nnever will. Perhaps, it was not, after all, so important for his life\nto have it: maybe mere opinion is all we need. It doesn't follow that\nhe should give up (as false) his belief that it is irrational to hold\nopinions, since it would only be correct to give it up if it actually\nis rational to hold opinions — but this is something that his\narguments don't warrant, any more than they warrant the opposite\nconclusion. \n\nThe suggestion, then, is that Arcesilaus' beliefs in the importance\nof knowledge and the inadequacy of mere opinion are explicitly\nnon-rational, in the sense that he is not persuaded that they are\nwarranted by a rational argument or theory, or even by the extensive\nargument he has devoted his life to. He believes that he hasn't found\nknowledge and that it is irrational to assent to anything without\nknowledge, but realizes, as a result of the unrestricted application of\nhis Socratic method, that there are strong reasons against these\nbeliefs. He is thus not in a position to give his rational assent to\nthe belief that it is irrational to hold opinions — he just finds\nthat that is how things strike him, i.e., that's what he believes. The\nAcademic skeptic, on this view, is someone whose sustained but\npre-theoretical commitment to rational investigation undermines their\nconfidence in rationality. The result is not a negative theory —\ne.g., the theory that we can't acquire knowledge owing to the\nlimitations of our cognitive or rational capacities — but a\npervasive lack of theory sustained by a dialectical method. \n\nIf this is correct, the basic philosophical puzzle about Arcesilaus'\nskepticism is not whether it is possible to live without beliefs, but\nwhether it is possible to be committed to rationality and yet\nsufficiently detached from it to recognise that, whatever it is, it may\nnot work. \n\nIt is clear that any interpretation of Arcesilaus must take into\naccount both his reputation as a master dialectician who deployed\nSocrates' method ruthlessly against his philosophical contemporaries,\nand his notorious advocacy of akatalêpsia and\nepochê. Given the contradictory nature and scarcity of\nthe evidence, it is perhaps not surprising that modern critics do not\nagree about the success of the ‘dialectical’,\n‘Academic’ and ‘Socratic’ interpretations of\nArcesilaus or about the consistency of the very different kinds of\nskepticism they propose. But further progress is not ruled out, since\nit is open to us to offer more sophisticated philosophical\nelaborations of those forms of skepticism and to test their historical\nplausibility by appealing to the diverse, but better attested\ntraditions in the later Academy.","contact.mail":"cfb9@cornell.edu","contact.domain":"cornell.edu"}]
