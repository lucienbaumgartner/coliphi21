Arguments may play\noff other arguments or support each other; smaller arguments can serve\nas sub-arguments inside larger arguments to which they contribute.\nFollowing the practice of Anglophone philosophers, this entry uses the\nterm “argument” only to indicate a premise-conclusion\ncomplex that may involve sub-arguments. “Argumentation”\nalso includes the larger context belonging to the activity of\n“arguing”, understood as the offering of reasons.\n\n\nFeminist philosophical work on argumentation takes a number of\ndifferent directions. Some feminists note a general association of\narguing with aggression, competition, and masculinity, and they\nquestion the necessity of these connections. Also, because many view\narguing as a central method of philosophical reasoning, if arguing\ninvolves gendered assumptions and standards then that would pose\nspecial problems for the discipline. In particular, the goal of\nwinning might get in the way of the other purposes for arguing. So,\nsome feminists ask: Can allegedly “feminine” modes of\narguing provide an alternative or supplement to allegedly\n“masculine” modes? Can overarching epistemological\nstandards account for the benefits of different approaches to arguing?\nThese are some of the prospects for argumentation inside and outside\nof philosophy that feminists consider.\n\n\nSome feminists charge, moreover, that the academic study of\nargumentation—by philosophers and other scholars—has\nfailed to account for the type of reasoning required to provide social\njustice. Ordinary politeness or even a more robust conception of\ncivility can be inadequate to counteract the influence on\nargumentation of inequalities based on social identity. What resources\ncan informal logic and interdisciplinary argumentation studies provide\nto help arguing practices avoid the reinforcement of social\ninjustices? Are informal logic and the study of rhetoric any more\nhelpful than deductive logic? Feminist scholars suggest certain\nstrategies for reasoning and for argument pedagogy, especially looking\nat ways to address the personal nature that arguing often has.\n\n\nOther feminists find problems with argumentation standards fairly\nspecific to the discipline of philosophy. It emerges that philosophers\noften invoke claims about arguments and arguing contrary to accepted\nargumentation scholarship. Feminists especially note this problem in\nthe way that philosophers employ fallacy labels and how they teach\nargument in critical thinking courses. Even though argumentation\nscholarship stands in need of further feminist development, it\nprovides some resources to help philosophy better address social\njustice concerns.\n\nTheories about arguing generally assume that arguers disagree, and\nsometimes arguing operates as a type of battle among ideas that may be\npreferred over physical combat among people. Adversarial orientation\namong people arguing may, however, marginalize women’s patterns\nof communication and discount social norms of “femininity”\n(that regularly attach to women and girls but vary across time and\nculture). The connection between “masculinity” (understood\nalso as a social norm, ideal, or role) and adversarial processes for\nreasoning may be heightened and even become stylized as a disciplinary\nmethod in contemporary Euro-American philosophy (Moulton 1983; Burrow\n2010; Rooney 2010; Alcoff\n 2013).[1]\n When reasoners treat arguing as a contest, each aiming to win by\ndefeating the other’s claim, it can become\n“eristic”, which is to say that the goal of winning takes\nover from other purposes that arguing serves. In the same way as\nadversarial reasoning and eristics, other discursive norms can\ncomplicate the ways that women may be marginalized and marginalize\nother groups of people, including men. Little attention has been given\nin Euro-American philosophy to the gendered dimensions of arguing in\nother cultures. However, feminists regularly suggest that where\nadversarial arguing dominates, non-dominant styles of reasoning can\nprovide productive alternatives or complements to it, and this often\ninvolves styles gendered as “feminine”. \nSome feminist philosophers suggest that an aggressive culture\nassociated with masculinity poorly serves processes of reasoning and\nhinders the discipline of philosophy insofar as it sidelines,\ndowngrades, and even excludes people’s non-adversarial\nengagement with each other and with each other’s reasoning.\nEvidence for this problem emerges in various places, beginning with\nthe prevalence of military and aggressive language to describe\nphilosophical discourse and rational arguing more generally (Lakoff\n& Johnson 1980; Ayim 1988; Cohen 1995). \nJanice Moulton (1983) argues that a particular style she calls\n“the Adversary Method” dominates the discipline of\nphilosophy, and this goes beyond a set of attitudes or styles of\ninteraction to include prioritizing a particular discursive logic.\nFurther evidence for Moulton’s characterization of disciplinary\npractices in philosophy comes from Phyllis Rooney (2012) and Catherine\nHundleby (2010). \nThe metaphor of argument-as-war provides a central example for George\nLakoff and Mark Johnson’s landmark book, Metaphors We Live\nBy (1980). War can operate as “structural metaphor”\nfor arguing: \nThough there is no physical battle, there is a verbal battle, and the\nstructure of an argument—attack, defense, counterattack,\netc.—reflects this. (1980: 4) \nWithout that structure, Lakoff and Johnson suggest that we could not\neven recognize a piece of discourse as an argument. \nMoulton (1983) observes that prioritizing aggression in the practice\nof arguing and the association of aggression with certain forms of\nmasculinity is problematic. If people assume that success requires\naggression, then discussants must appear aggressive in order to appear\ncompetent at arguing. Not only may the assumption be false, but it may\nentail a distinct disadvantage for women. Cultures that treat\naggression as a natural quality in men encourage and advantage men in\neristic modes of engagement. When success demands aggression,\ncontributions to an exchange of reasons made in other\nstyles—including those that read as feminine—will not\nmeasure up; and they may not even be noticed. At the same time, a\nwoman can seem to be aggressive merely by asserting her own viewpoint\nor by showing competence in some other fashion. She may tend to stand\nout in many contexts as behaving inappropriately, even as her actions\nbecome acknowledged, because of her feminine social identity (Moulton\n1983: 150; Rancer & Stewart 1985; Hample et al. 2005; Kukla 2014;\nOlberding 2014). \nMoulton calls attention to ways in which philosophical approaches to\narguing and reasoning in Euro-American culture take on a pronounced\nadversarial dynamic that reflects aggressive expectations. Her concern\nabout the discipline and about models for argumentation is shared by\nmany feminist philosophers (Ayim 1988; Burrow 2010; Gilbert 1994,\n1997; Hundleby 2010, 2013b, Rooney 2003, 2010) and some who are not\nspecifically feminist (Cohen 1995). Maryann Ayim observes that a\nculture of hostility can be viewed in the militaristic, violent,\nsubjugating, and controlling language used to describe philosophical\narguing, especially the metaphor of argument-as-war: \nPhilosophers tend to value their “sharper” students, whom\nthey may openly praise for their “penetrating” insights.\nOccasionally they find students of “piercing”\nintelligence, one or two perhaps with minds like “steel\ntraps”. Philosophers regard such students as important: They\nrequire “tough-minded” opponents with whom they can\n“parry” in the classroom, so they can exhibit to the\nothers what the “thrust” of philosophical argumentation is\nall about. This “battle of wits” is somewhat risky,\nhowever, and a “combatant” must take care always to\n“have the upper hand”, to “win thumbs down”,\nto “avoid being hoist by your own petard”. If you find\nyourself pressed for time at the end of a lecture, with your\n“back to the wall”, or as it is occasionally even more\ncolorfully expressed, “between a rock and a hard place”,\nyou may have to resort to “strong arm tactics”, to\n“barbed” comments, to “go for the jugular”, to\n“cut an opponent’s argument to pieces”, or to\n“bring out the big guns or heavy artillery”. If caught in\nthe throes of a real dilemma, you many even have to “take the\nbull by the horns” or rebut the dilemma by advancing a\n“counter” dilemma. (Ayim 1988: 188) \nMartial metaphors and competitive evaluation foster the eristic goal\nof defeating others and their views (Cohen 1995), even perhaps, Ayim\nsuggests, for instructors in regard to their students. While this\nattitude may seem obviously inappropriate for instructors to take with\nstudents over whom they have authority, the available range of such\nlanguage suggests a general disciplinary culture that enforces\naggression through conflating it with success (Moulton 1983). \nAdmittedly, aggressive interaction may be comfortable for many women\nand uncomfortable for some men, and it may be inflected with class and\nrace biases with similarly variable effect. Yet these may be merely\nexceptions to the “masculine” homosocial culture of\nhostility that many feminists maintain prevails in philosophical\narguing. Rooney argues that culture reinforces male status in the\ndiscipline and resonates with narratives of opposition against not\njust ideas but also against people who present them,\nespecially women (Rooney 2010: 229). Common ideals of masculinity and\nrationality coincide with the association of aggression with success,\npower, effectiveness, and vitality; they contrast with emotion,\nunreason, body, sexuality, instinct, nature, and\n rhetoric,[2]\n all notions that Euro-American cultures regularly associate with\nfemininity. \nIn the history of Euro-American philosophy, Rooney (2010) observes,\nmasculine reason regularly appears in battle against feminine elements\nof unreason, a battle that occurs both within the knower and among\naspects of thought. “Embattled reason” constantly\nstruggles to subordinate feminine elements of unreason, and the\nsuppression of perceived negative qualities that are gendered as\n“feminine” provides a central means for achieving the\nideals of reason and rationality central to the discipline. That the\ndiscipline functions this way can discourage women’s\nparticipation. So, Rooney argues \nthat a full feminist accounting of the general cultural problem with\ngender, adversariality, and authority must include consideration of\nphilosophy’s history and its lingering effects. (2010: 209,\n217–219) \nOtherwise the discipline may continue to perpetuate sexist standards\nof reason from the larger culture and its history. \nDaniel Cohen (1995) suggests that antagonistic attitudes may not\nactually enhance competition and the knowledge it is supposed to\nserve, and that imposing the goal of agreement can silence rational\ndiscourse and undermine the goal of philosophy to further inquiry. The\nvalue of information that challenges our own beliefs can always be\nhard to recognize, a difficulty described as “confirmation\nbias”, and this problem can be exacerbated when the focus of\narguing is winning rather than learning or ascertaining truth (Makau\n& Marty 2013: 39–40, 167; Linker 2015). \nNorms of masculine aggression may help a particular reasoning method\nto dominate the discipline of philosophy, Janice Moulton argues in an\nearly article (1983). She describes the process of competitive\nreasoning through deductive refutation—typically by\ncounter-example—as the “Adversary\n Method”.[3]\n According to Moulton, the Method employs opposing views on a topic as\ntests for each other—the more severe the opposition, the better,\nand surviving the confrontation grants “objectivity” to a\nview. Winning at arguing in this fashion depends on defeating\ncompeting positions based on faults identified in them. Defeat of the\nopposite position becomes more decisive when the claims are very\nspecific, as specificity aids deductive refutation. \nPhilosophy, at least in Moulton’s (1983) context of late\ntwentieth century Anglo-American or “analytic” philosophy,\nmay be so permeated by the combination of adversarial arguing and\ndeductive logic that the Adversary Method operates as a disciplinary\n“paradigm”. Moulton argues that this\n“paradigm” for philosophy demands aggressive opposition to\nother people’s opinions, in the same way that Thomas Kuhn\nobserved that mature scientific disciplines demand adherence to an\noverarching theory, an ideal, and a practice that together constitute\na cultural paradigm. Philosophers’ technique of aiming to\nfalsify each other’s claims reflects Karl Popper’s\nepistemology but adversarial reasoning in philosophy has taken many\ndifferent forms and traces back at least to Aristotle. Descartes and\nKant shifted the normative focus of the study of logic from dialogue\nto individual cognition, and the logic of opposition became\ninternalized (Dutilh Novaes 2011, 2015). Yet, arguing as a dialogical\nform of reasoning retains the oppositional dynamic. \nMoulton criticizes how the operation of the Adversary Method as a\nparadigm can hobble the progress of philosophical reasoning by\nnarrowing the possibilities for discussion. Isolating claims maximizes\ntheir vulnerability and prepares them for Adversarial testing, forcing\nproponents to rely on ad hoc revisions, and prohibiting the\nsystematic reconsiderations that encourage theories to evolve. For\ninstance, ad hoc concessions “for the sake of\nargument” create common ground for discussion only by\nrestricting the basis for disagreement; and so, Moulton maintains,\nthey slow the development of philosophical thought (1983:\n154–155). \nMoulton (1983) argues that the narrow discourse of the Adversary\nMethod seriously limits the relevance of philosophy to feminist\nconcerns. She takes the example of Judith Jarvis Thomson’s\nclassic philosophical defense of the moral permissibility of abortion\nthat concedes a great deal (that the fetus is a full-fledged person\nwith a right to life) to show that the right to life does not\nsupersede the right to bodily autonomy. Moulton’s concern is\nthat even though Thomson’s position supports feminist\ntheoretical views, it employs reasoning so remote from the\ncircumstances of pregnancy that it provides no guidance for people\nseeking to make decisions about actual abortions. Taking the purpose\nof arguing to be the defeat of a view limits the practical relevance\nof the argumentative exchange. \nMoulton makes a further related point that forcing narrow theories to\ncompete can make philosophy look quite absurd. Moral arguments are\ndirected at egoists and epistemology is offered to skeptics. Debates\nover the existence of the external world and the existence of God\noccupy philosophers at the expense of attention to the character of\nthe world we live in or the role of God in our religions. Philosophers\nrarely question the assumption that there must be a supreme moral\nprinciple, Moulton explains, because otherwise there would be little\nsense to making different theories compete for recognized supremacy\n(1983: 157–158). Losing sight of other reasons for arguing may\nhave even resulted in the misinterpretation of key figures in the\nhistory of philosophy. Moulton suggests that interpreters often miss\nvarious purposes for which Socrates argued because they assume that\nhis only goal was refutation (1983: 155–157). The assumption\nthat the Adversary Method drives philosophical progress may distort\nphilosophers’ understanding of the value of their own\ndiscipline. \nThe Adversary Method’s prevalence and constitution of a Kuhnian\nparadigm may be recognized in Rooney’s observation that\nphilosophers tend to engage each other from a “default skeptical\nstance”. The skeptical stance challenges the quality of the\ncomponents of another’s arguments, including the basis for\npremises, the support premises provide for the conclusion, and the\npossibility of counterexamples. The skeptical stance operates as a\ndefault without consideration of the appropriateness of the challenges\nfor the topic under discussion. Rooney notes in particular, \nskeptical argumentative responses that take necessary truths and valid\narguments as the ideal poorly serve the variety of arguments and forms\nof argumentation that important philosophical works have presented and\nwill continue to present. (2012: 321) \nInappropriate standards undermine the general epistemic aims of truth\nand understanding. They create specific problems for discussion of\nsocial justice issues which depends extensively on testimony and\ntherefore on deft employment of the epistemology of testimony and\nsensitivity to the danger of testimonial injustice (see\n Section 4 on Credibility and argument interpretation).\n The unsuitability of the Adversary Method for discussions of social\njustice will stall social justice projects, Rooney concludes,\nincluding those within the discipline of philosophy. \nHundleby presents as evidence for the paradigmatic operation of the\nAdversary Method an analysis of critical thinking textbooks in\nphilosophy. Twenty-four textbooks of the thirty\nexamined—four-fifths—revealed in their presentation of\nfallacies the norms of the Adversary Method: narrow discourse and\ndecisive refutation. Most of these textbooks exhibiting the Adversary\nParadigm have authors with no research expertise in argumentation more\nspecific than doctoral training in philosophy, whereas the much\nsmaller number of textbooks (six out of thirty) authored by scholars\nof argumentation do not show the same signs of the Adversary Method.\nGiven this evidence that argumentation scholarship differently orients\nargument pedagogy, the prevalence of the Adversary Method in so many\nother textbooks seems to derive simply from the disciplinary culture\nof philosophy (Hundleby 2010). \nSome empirical educational studies suggest, too, that while students\nlearn a great deal from learning eristic practices of argument, it\nundermines their progress as learners by emphasizing winning over\ngaining understanding (Makau & Marty 2013: 13).\nPeople—including feminists—Moulton (1983) suggests, might\nexpect more relevant advice from the discipline of philosophy. More\npractical philosophies addressing mundane problems also may be found\noutside Euro-American cultures (Olberding 2015). \nFeminist philosophical models of arguing aim either to replace or to\ncomplement arguing practices and norms defined in terms of a contest\nbetween people or reasons. In addition to the goal of defeating an\ninterlocutor or their reasons, arguments can serve many purposes.\nExplanation and explanatory argument (sometimes considered to be the\nsame thing) already receive attention from argumentation theorists and\nphilosophers of science. Other functions of arguing, such as educating\nthe uninitiated or the undecided and discussing matters with\nlike-minded people, remain neglected by theorists (Goodwin &\nInnocenti 2019). None of the alternatives need to take over as a new\n“paradigm”, but exploring various purposes, methods, and\nstyles of arguing may help to scrutinize accepted procedures and\npurposes (Moulton 1983). Such questioning of methods deters their\ndogmatic acceptance. \nAccording to Cohen, more important for the role of arguing in\nphilosophy and education than to praise or condemn any particular\nnorms of arguing may be the exploration of multiple approaches.\nPhilosophers and arguers more generally might find means for\ninnovation and constructive questioning in many new models and\nmetaphors. Cohen finds that traffic metaphors seem to work especially\nwell: \nWe can say that arguments are (i) conversational traffic\njams—(ii) gridlock with a lot of honking and little movement;\n(iii) conversational traffic accidents; (iv) wrong turns, or (v)\ndetours, or (vi) dead ends or (vii) roundabouts on the streets of\ndiscourse; or should we have said that they are (viii) short cuts to\nthe truth at the end of the road; maybe (ix) they are long and winding\nroads to nowhere; or, instead, we can conceive of arguments as (x)\nintellectual one way roads to their conclusions although maybe they\nare really (xi) one-lane roads but with two-way traffic. More\npositively, they can be thought of as a case of (xii) a merging\ntraffic of ideas or even better as (xiii) conceptual roads under\nconstruction. (Cohen 1995: 184) \nThe availability of so many traffic metaphors suggests something\nappropriate about this analogy. Another option identified by Keith\nLloyd (2014) lies in perceptual metaphors, especially regarding what\narguers can see. However, visual metaphors have a fraught history in\nfeminist philosophy because ideal vision tends to be associated with\nabstraction, and to lean on a hierarchy of the senses (Keller &\nGrontkowski 1983). In any case it is likely that no metaphor or\nanalogy can capture all the shapes that arguments take and the\npurposes they serve (Cohen 1995: 187). \nMetaphors, models, and methods that tend to be “gendered”\nas feminine may carry connotations of subordination—and so they\nmay seem inferior, yet they may be also especially useful for\nwomen and hence powerful for feminists. These approaches can provide a\npotent basis for generating alternatives to eristic standards and an\nunderstanding of the processes that may go alongside or support\narguing as a contest. Metaphors and models based on collaboration fit\nwith the work of physical and emotional care that regularly\nconstitutes women’s roles and responsibilities. Yet\ncollaboration also proves quite apt for many other contexts and\nfunctions of arguing such as explanation and deliberation. Rooney\nsuggests that because people converse with rather than\nagainst each other, and because arguing is a species of\nconversation, we should speak of arguing with rather than against\npeople and their views (2010: 221). This possibility suggests that the\nargument-as-war metaphor may not be so overwhelming as to make\nalternatives unimaginable in the way Lakoff and Johnson suggest (1980:\n4). Alternative structures for argument can be found in our ordinary\nlanguage. \nPatterns that might seem to distinguish how women argue may not\nexpress deep cognitive differences between the genders. A range of\ncommunicative styles including gendered norms of polite discourse that\nhave people constrain their public reasoning may equally serve\ncognitive functions common to men and women. Gendered roles may even\ncomplement each other’s epistemological operation. The most\naggressive and disruptive behavior will not endure norms of\npoliteness. However, some feminists consider that politeness can\nrequire conformity to structures of social authority that marginalize\nwomen, people of color, and others belonging to subordinated social\ncategories. \nThe gendered associations of different styles of reasoning suggest\nthat a source for alternative models of arguing might be found in what\nhave been seen as “feminine” styles of reasoning. Whether\nor not women reason differently from men depends on what we count as\nreasoning (Verbiest 1995), and the evidence from psychology and\nsociology reveals no significantly gendered differences in the mental\nprocesses of inference and cognition (Fine 2010). Yet women’s\ncommunication practices often reflect distinct “values of\nintimacy, connection, inclusion, and problem sharing” (Burrow\n2010: 247). \nAyim argues that in order to avoid reinforcing patterns of\nsubordination, we must detect and examine how values and\npresuppositions play into the ways that we interpret argumentation\n(1988: 185). Rooney adds that cooperative and collaborative\ninclinations may involve a tendency to defer, a reluctance to take\nresponsibility for a position, or a lack of confidence in one’s\nideas (2010: 213–214). The need to appease those with greater\npower may explain why an open-ended and tentative quality sometimes\ndistinguishes women’s style of arguing and practices of\ncommunication associated with femininity. Sylvia Burrow suggests that\nwomen may give others’ interests priority over their own in\norder to secure cooperation and connection (2010). This may\ncharacterize subordinate roles more generally, sometimes extending to\nmarginalized races and ethnicities. \nWhile styles of “femininity” and “masculinity”\nare neither wholly good nor bad, they both have inherent dangers. A\ndanger for masculinity arises from its association with activity and\naggression as apparently natural features of maleness. As a result,\nthese masculine ideals constrain women’s communication, as has\noften been noted by feminist theorists, while feminine modes tend to\nbe dismissed. Because masculine characteristics also operate as ideals\nof humanity or personhood (Hundleby 2016), men can over-identify with\nthem and have no motivation to reflect on or problematize their gender\nidentity (Bruner 1996). \nThe strategy of transgressing gender by adopting an aggressive\nmasculine mode for arguing can seem useful to women and the temptation\nmay be strongest in “masculine” discourses such as\nphilosophical discussion, or wherever listeners treat an authoritative\nmanner as valuable. Yet, when women adopt masculine\ndiscursive styles and adversarial techniques, they can garner\ncriticism for being selfish, cold, and mean, which is criticism that\nmen would not receive (Burrow 2010). Furthermore, such character\nchallenges weaken women’s authority and their ability to\nparticipate in argumentation (Burrow 2010; Hundleby 2013a). Even when\nthose challenges are not interpreted as a character fault, the effect\nmay be to present women as merely requesting permission to\nparticipate, whereas men are not taken to need permission (Kukla 2014;\nOlberding 2014). When women decline to offer explanations, they are\nconsidered incompetent, whereas the same behavior reads as strength in\nmen. Women’s attempts to defend their authority can easily\nbackfire because the very nature of authority depends on not always\nhaving to defend what one says (Hanrahan & Antony 2005). \nThe consideration that women may have a “different voice”\nin moral reasoning (Gilligan 1982) gave rise to care ethics as a\nfeminist alternative to traditional accounts of morality. Ayim (1988)\nsuggests that metaphors of nurturing could also replace violent ones\ndescribing arguing, especially because arguing can help to foster\ncommunity (Makau & Marty 2013). Approaches to reasoning that\npresume interest in the flourishing of other people and that consider\nthe needs of others may be common among girls and women in cultures\nthat press them into practices of motherhood and related caring labor,\nsuch as teaching, nursing, and food service. \nAttention to the unique audience and the speakers involved in a\nparticular discussion forces consideration of its detailed situation.\nIn one sense, this attention exhibits a bias toward certain sorts of\nevidence. That bias does not pretend to value-neutrality. Yet, Karen\nWarren argues that attention to detail provides a feminist sense of\n“open-mindedness” that enriches feminist reasoning with\ndata in a way that entails a type of impartiality (1988: 38).\nReasoners operate from specific locations that cannot be adequately\naddressed by an epistemology of generic or uniform knowers, as\nfeminist epistemologist Lorraine Code argues (1991). And feminist\ncommunications scholars Josina M. Makau and Debian L. Marty note that\n“taking other people’s perspectives seriously is a basic\nrequirement in peaceful coexistence” (2001: 11; 2013: 51). \nAccounting for reasoners’ social situations in the way that\nWarren and Code advise provides part of the goal for Maureen\nLinker’s model of “intellectual empathy” (2015).\nThis involves working to understand the history of social inequality\nand how it affects the reasoning and arguing of ourselves and others.\nLinker argues that \nreason and understanding must be supplemented with emotion and\nexperience so that we can know in the fullest possible sense.\n(2015: 13) \nAttention to specific personal experiences that historically have been\nignored provides a feminist standpoint with particular empirical and\nscientific value, and marks a place where the two general feminist\nepistemologies of science, feminist standpoint theory and feminist\nempiricism, coincide (Intemann 2010). \nThe same feminist epistemological concerns motivate Michael\nGilbert’s model of “coalescent argumentation”, which\ntreats arguing as communication that involves much more than a generic\nexpression of a premise-conclusion complex. In coalescent\nargumentation, the views of speakers stand in opposition to each other\nwithout the people speaking being opposed to each other.\nArguers’ orientation to other people requires that they account\nfor their interconnection with those in conversation and how their\ndecisions affect others. In this collaborative model, the defeat\nneither of ideas nor of an opponent provides the goal; instead the\ngoal is to find mutual ground among people, which requires a broad\nview of relevant considerations (1994; 1997). The processes of\ncoalescent argumentation demand more information than required simply\nto find fault with others’ arguments. The premise-conclusion\ncomplexes that logicians recognize as arguments become understood in\ncoalescent arguing as standing in for “a\nposition-cluster of attitudes, beliefs, feelings and\nintuitions” belonging to the arguer (Gilbert 1994: 96, original\nemphasis). Arguers’ motivations offer a basis for interpretation\nthat provides greater room for recognizing middle ground among people\nwho seem to disagree. Exploring this common territory also suggests\nways in which alternative solutions may be developed. By emphasizing\nhow divergent positions involve agreement among the proponents’\nviews and desires, points of disagreement can be distinguished from\npoints of agreement and minimized. On Gilbert’s model,\n“one asks not, ‘What can I disagree with?’ but,\n‘What must I disagree with?’” (1994: 109). \nIn light of the general feminist interest in collaborative and\ncoalescent models of argumentation, Tempest M. Henning (2018) warns\nthey may reflect certain cultural assumptions, and presumptions of\nuniversal culture. The norms recommended by what she identifies as\n“non-adversarial feminist argumentation models”, and\nattributes especially to Ayim, may run contrary to the cultures and\nneeds of U.S. Black women. More generally, argumentation theory tends\nto prescribe a pleasantness of tone and directness of speech that\nconnotes respect in some cultures but not others (Henning 2021; see\n Section 2.4 on Politeness and civility).\n Some feminist philosophers also value adversarial arguing or even\nidentify personally as adversarial arguers. So, the resistance to\nforms of adversarial arguing that appears to provide a valuable\ncommonality between some feminist concerns and accepted views in\nargumentation theory may reflect only the interests of certain white\nwomen. It may actually work against the interests of other groups of\nwomen and risk reinforcing racial marginalization. \nEven feminists with concerns about adversarial reasoning recognize\nthat it promotes criticism that may advance the goal of attaining\nknowledge and understanding. Knowledge is an important purpose among\nthose that arguing serves and different styles of arguing can serve\ndifferent purposes. Some efforts to build knowledge may benefit from\nthe adversarial styles and models, especially if arguers can avoid\nautomatically slipping into hostile, “ancillary” modes of\naggression (Govier 1999). Arguers may also need to avoid reinforcing\nother epistemic cultures and subcultures that prioritize men’s\ninteraction with each other (Rooney 2012). So feminists need norms for\narguing that support criticism of such androcentric cultures and\npractices and the development of knowledge about how such systems\nfunction. \nNon-adversarial models of reasoning such as coalescent argumentation\nmay aid people’s understanding too, especially about others and\ntheir positions. Mutual understanding develops from coalescent arguing\nbecause it demands finding common ground. The remaining opposition\namong people and their beliefs constitutes a minimally adversarial\norientation that Trudy Govier (1999) and Rooney (2010) argue may be\nvaluable for both the development of arguments and the role of arguing\nin the processes that generate knowledge. Arguers can aid each other\nin achieving knowledge, which is the main goal in academic arguing,\ndespite the fact that academics sometimes can be side-tracked by\nmundane power play. \nBecause of overarching epistemic purposes, Cohen suggests that the\npeople whose ideas lose in eristic debate thus may benefit the most\nbecause they learn the most (1995: 182). People may also share an\ninquiry (Dutilh Novaes 2015: 598–599), and epistemic benefit may\naccrue to communities. The discursive practices in which individual\nscientists work together by testing each other’s claims may\nexhibit certain characteristics that Helen Longino’s (1990)\nmodel of scientific reasoning sees as supporting a form of\nobjectivity. Longino’s account of objectivity addresses feminist\nconcerns with about gender bias in scientific theories and involves\nboth collaborative and adversarial elements. \nSuch shared epistemic projects among people might be understood as\n“arguing with” rather than “against” other\nreasoners (Rooney 2003). Rooney argues that readily available logical\nterms such as “contradictory” and “contrary”\ncan adequately describe differing opinions without implicating\nopposition among the people holding divergent views (2003; 2010: 222).\nSuch language may help reasoners move away from both the Adversary\nMethod’s dominance as a Paradigm and eristic arguing that may be\notherwise dysfunctional. The negative connotations of\n“argument” and “arguing” in the English\nlanguage may be part of the\n problem.[4]\n Related words in other Indo-European languages carry no such\nimplication of verbal fighting (Hitchcock 2017: 449). Avoiding the\nEnglish-language connotations is part of the reason theorists often\nspeak instead of “argumentation” even though that\nterminology can be unclear or unnecessarily abstract. \nYet, criticism must be part of feminism, especially to direct it at\nsexism, and feminists may be no more skilled than anyone else at\navoiding the pitfalls of arguing such as its tendency to aggravate\nconflict. Feminist models of arguing avoid levelling criticism against\npeople and direct it toward the views they hold so as to better serve\neveryone’s understanding. Feminist models of arguing and some\nways of arguing used by feminists and non-feminists alike exhibit a\nbenevolent attentiveness to other arguers in the processes of arguing\nand yet they may also subject what other people say to extensive\ncriticism and opposition. \nAccording to Govier, the characteristic explicitness of reasoning when\npeople argue enables them to learn from disagreement and doubt (1999).\nExplicitness also promotes honesty with ourselves and each other and\nrespect for interpersonal differences: \nan arguer, in actually or potentially addressing those who differ, is\ncommitted to the recognition that people may think differently and\nthat what they think and why they think it matters. (1999: 8, 50) \nFeminist criticism often involves anger, an emotion also regularly\nassociated with arguing. Anger can be a distracting or even\ndestructive influence on reasoning and it can signify harmful\narrogance (Tanesini 2018). Moira Howes and Catherine Hundleby make a\ncase that arguing can help derive cognitive benefit from anger because\narguing encourages reasoners to express and to articulate their\nreasons (2018). It can reveal aspects of reasoning that otherwise\nwould remain unconscious, a feature of arguing processes that Douglas\nWalton identifies as the “maieutic effect” (1992). \nStyles for communicating and sharing reasons often distinguished as\n“feminine” also play roles in feminist epistemologies of\nargumentation: Gilbert assigns a fundamental role in coalescent\nargumentation to the values of attention to the speaker and seeking\nagreement, while Linker characterizes empathetic intellectuals as\nhaving the skills of cooperation and accepting vulnerability. Feminist\nethical goals of accountability to women thus can benefit from the\npursuit of knowledge. Not only for feminists but for all reasoners,\nthe ethical value of understanding other people can enhance the\nstandard philosophical treatment of arguments as logical\npremise-conclusion complexes. Coalescent and intellectually empathic\nreasoning complement critical analysis once we distinguish criticism\nfrom the eristic culture of aggressive fault-finding (Miller\n1995). \nAs a remedy for some of the problems that women and other arguers\nface, some feminists champion politeness, while others stress that\nexpecting etiquette to address abuses of power belies the realities of\nwomen and others who are socially marginalized. Norms of politeness\nfunction to minimize conflict and so can hold people in subordinate\npositions (Mayo 2001). Like “ideal theory” in philosophy\n(Mills 2005), politeness can exacerbate the oppression it\nignores—in this case, discursive marginalization. \nGovier argues that the discursive norm of politeness limits the\nproblem of overt interpersonal aggression in arguing (1999). Respect\nfor other people and careful consideration of their views ought to be\npart of persuasion, including rational persuasion, which\nscholars often take to be the central or even the sole purpose for\narguing (1999: 58–59). On this view, aggressive styles of\ncommunication or “ancillary adversariality” can be\ndismissed as simple rudeness or hostility. These ought not to be\ntolerated in any context and may not impact much on the beliefs and\nattitudes of the audience (Govier 1999; Miller 1995). \nThe main difficulty with this ideal arises because norms of politeness\ntend to be gendered in ways that undermine women’s authority\nwhen people argue, affirming power and status for men but not for\nwomen. This dynamic can receive reinforcement when women adopt\ncooperative strategies that play into norms of\n“femininity”, according to Burrow (2010) and Hundleby\n(2013a). Securing cooperation and connection with other people\nprovides the very purpose for politeness. Both “masculine”\nand “feminine” forms of politeness can reflect this\npurpose. However, the gendered dynamics of politeness in many cultures\nmay entail that cooperative or collaborative argumentation serves\nwomen poorly. It contributes to their subordination and perhaps also\nthe subordination of other people with marginalized social identities.\nFor women, cooperating and connecting with others may entail deferring\none’s interests and promoting dialogue through hedging,\nquestioning intonation, and use of tag questions, for example,\n“You know?” “Right?” “Don’t you\nthink?” These strategies generally imply powerlessness or\nconflict avoidance. In contrast, masculine norms of polite connection\nfacilitate shared competition and encourage joint autonomy along with\nregard for each other’s needs (Burrow 2010). \nBurrow argues that women often have no easy options for conforming\nwith the etiquette demands that reinforce power differences among\nspeakers. Deferential styles of dialogue are part of most subordinate\npositions and, for women, other aspects of social rank do not mitigate\nthis much. Therefore, to negotiate politeness and to argue\neffectively, women need complex strategies tailored to their\ncircumstances (2010). \nHenning (2021) observes that what many feminist and\nnot-specifically-feminist argumentation theorists count as rudeness\nmay actually belong to politeness strategies in African-American\nVernacular English (AAVE). In particular, “signifying” or\n“signification” within AAVE “utilizes exaggeration,\nirony, and indirection to partake in coded messages, riddled with\ninsults”. To refuse to participate in signification is rude and\npoliteness demands participation in speech that on the surface\nsuggests disrespect. In some cultures, arguing not only performs\npro-social functions, it provides such an important form of\nsociability that superficial or even insincere arguing may be an\nessential part of interaction and social bonding (Schiffrin 1984). \nBecause of the range of conflicting politeness strategies across\ndifferent communities, it may serve better to seek an alternative to\npoliteness as a norm and that may lie in an inclusive practice and\nethic of civility in dialogue. Civility tends to be understood as\ndeeper than politeness, sometimes considered itself to be a virtue or\nas involving such virtues as respect for other people (Calhoun 2000:\n253; Bone et al. 2008; Laverty 2009; Reiheld 2013). Respecting others\nrequires trying to understand them “as they wish to be known and\nunderstood” in the cooperative argumentation model developed by\nMakau and Marty (2013: 69). Others suggest that civil respect be\nparsed in ethical frameworks, such as deontology or consequentialism,\nbecause simple deference to existing social standards may be\noppressive in assigning more restrictive practices to certain groups\nof people. Practices of respect may involve people’s adherence\nto oppressive social roles, just as they do for politeness, if common\npractice determines them. Ethically rich interpretations of civility\nmust be shared among interlocutors in order that civility can fulfill\nits function to regulate disagreement. Such shared norms of civility\nnot only aid the articulation of understandings that prejudiced and\noppressive behavior are intolerable, they also aid people’s\nability to challenge broader social problems (Calhoun 2000). \nCivility may be distinguished from other virtues as “an\nessentially communicative form of moral conduct”, a display and\nexpression of how one regards others (Calhoun 2000: 260). However,\nthis virtue has limits and incivility can also perform important\nargumentative functions. Uncivil communication can create space for\nnew forms of meaning and value: \nThe disruption entailed by incivility provides room for concerted\nreconstruction of social practices, identities, and spaces. (Mayo\n2001: 79) \nUncivil communication and arguing may even be necessary for some\nsocial change (Lozano-Reich & Cloud 2009: 223–224). Because\ncertain practices viewed as “civil” may depoliticize\ndisagreement, incivility that highlights these political problems can\nprove to be as necessary as civility is to democratic decision-making\n(Mayo 2001). Which moral and political demands justify incivility\nremains, however, a complicated question that demands analysis of the\ndiscursive norms in operation in a particular context for their\nability to sustain interpersonal respect. \nFeminist philosophical work on argumentation as it emerged in the\nearly 1980s coincides with the rise of informal logic, an approach\nthat encompasses much of contemporary philosophical work done in\nargumentation theory (Johnson 1996 [2014: 12]). Many feminists and\ninformal logicians share both a resistance to the idealization by some\nphilosophers of formal deductive methods for reasoning and a desire to\nprovide better tools for addressing real world contexts of reasoning\nand arguing (Govier 1999: 52). \nAny interpretation or analysis of an argument omits some aspects of\nthe reasoning involved in the surrounding discourse while it attends\nto others, and different forms of abstraction suit different purposes\n(Rooney 2001). Interpretations become problematic for feminists when\nthey leave out salient details that would make possible other\ninterpretations that account for social bias. For instance,\ninterpreting an argument as a deductive inference may not allow for\nthe sorts of analysis of social situation that a standard informal\nlogic interpretation of ad hominem makes possible. \nEven informal logicians may assume an equality among arguers that is\nmore ideal than real and that may obstruct political progress. The\nproblems that feminists find with assumed equality may be most visible\nin accounts of ad hominem arguing. Both feminist (Janack\n& Adams 1999; Yap 2013, 2015) and not-specifically feminist\n(Walton 1995) argumentation theorists recognize that appeals to the\nperson may or may not be fallacious. The difference is that while the\ninformal logic analysis informs an audience about the irrelevance of a\npersonal attack, a feminist analysis also maintains that the line of\nreasoning may still succeed because of unconscious biases such as\nimplicit sexism and racism that feminists find unacceptable. For this\nreason, feminist critiques of ad hominem arguments require\nmore than logical analysis and also consider the epistemology of\ntestimony (Yap 2013). \nAddressing women’s more general concerns about arguing and\nassessing feminist arguments about women’s marginalization\nrequires a richer and more diverse analysis than a logical analysis of\ninferences provides. Andrea Nye (1990) suggests ways that the language\nof logic, including both the artificial language of abstract ideals\nand the surrounding discourse of logicians, might convey the interests\nand purposes of people who hold social power. Logical models for\nargument, especially formal ones, are developed, according to Nye, to\nprioritize some people’s interests over others and to hide that\nprioritization by claiming generality and the dominance of such models\ncan lead to systematic misinterpretations of women’s\narguments. \nOther feminists maintain that abstract interpretation causes trouble\nonly when reasoners mistake it for a uniform authority. The trouble\nwith abstract analysis, Ayim suggests, lies not in the models\nthemselves, but in how people use them (1995: 806). Logical or\nargumentative ideals that involve abstract models may be partial in\nrepresenting some people’s preferred inference forms without\nthese models having an intrinsically universalizing character that\nmakes them false. Ayim believes that any such problems in the\ndisciplines of logic result from the practitioners’ failure to\nbe realistic and humble. She says that \nIt is only when logic is seen as the exclusive avenue to\ntruth and reason that problems arise—not when it is seen as\nan avenue to truth and reason. (Ayim 1995: 810, emphasis\nadded) \nGilbert suggests that the practical concerns and interdisciplinary\nconsiderations of informal logic must be expanded and become more\nattuned to the specific social situations from which arguments arise\n(2007). Neglected aspects of argumentation may include the identities\nof speakers (Code 1991), the power relationships between speakers\n(Bondy 2010; Linker 2011, 2015; Rooney 2012), the emotions involved\n(Nye 1990; Gilbert 1994; Linker 2015), the social consequences of\nargumentation (Code 1991; Rooney 2012), and intersectional identities\n(Henning 2018, 2021). When feminine speech and writing styles are\npoorly received and misinterpreted, women will encounter difficulties\ngetting their arguments heard or to taken seriously, let alone\nrecognized as good reasoning. The demand from feminist philosophers to\nsituate argumentative reasoning and to evaluate it in the larger\ndiscursive contexts (Burrow 2010; Lang 2010) can be met at least in\npart by the recent revival of rhetorical accounts of argumentation\nthat address the role of audience (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca\n1958 [1969]; Perelman 1977 [1982]; Tindale 1999, 2007). \nFormal logic employs artificial abstract languages generally\nunderstood to address particular types of inference. Formal symbolism\nis also used to interpret arguments from natural language so as to\nassess the strength of an argument’s inference, in particular,\nwhether the argument has deductive validity. So, the argument,\n“It is icy outside and therefore I will not travel today”\nmight fail to be translatable into a deductively valid form, although\npeople easily recognize its good reasoning. (“Missing\npremises” might be added to make the argument deductive but that\nrequires more than formal interpretation.) \nNye’s work on formal logic, especially Words of Power: A\nFeminist Reading of the History of Logic (1990), provides the\npoint of departure for many of the initial feminist philosophical\ndiscussions of argument and arguing. Nye considers certain historical\npoints when deductive logic’s operation as the default\ninterpretive mechanism for arguments may have had an oppressive\ninfluence. Rather than arguing for this interpretation, she adopts a\npractice of “reading” that includes attention, listening,\nunderstanding, and responding (1990, 183), approaches that are\ntraditionally associated with rhetoric (Keith 1993). Her feminist\n“reading” of episodes in the history of Euro-American\nlogic suggests ways in which abstract logical systems may have helped\nto justify social dominance at different moments in time. Her\n“reading” purposefully aims to consider the personal and\npolitical desires behind logic that might motivate its prescription of\nrules for thought (Nye 1990: 9). \nNye begins her study with Parmenides’ logic of “what\nis”, what exists beyond sensuous existence and human\ncommunities. The ensuing silence among the ancient Greeks was broken\nby Plato who addressed “what is not” through using\nrational discussion to reveal the existence of differences. For\nAristotle, this dialectic involved only men from the upper classes,\nmaking the exclusive nature of the logic most explicit. As a result,\nin Nye’s view, a silence regarding a lot of reasoning surrounds\nlogic. Nye notes that \nonce rationality is defined as what is not emotional, and emotionality\nestablished as the characteristic of women understood as what is only\na body, there could be no discussion of institutions of slavery and\nsexism. (1990: 50) \nShe traces through medieval formulations of logic ways in which the\nclaims of logic’s universal application may have discouraged\ncriticism of social institutions that authorized those accounts of\nlogic. These institutions include patriarchy in general, sometimes\nunderwritten by God, the Roman Empire, and the Catholic Church. \nLogical restriction on what counts as reasoning culminates, on\nNye’s reading, when Gottlob Frege moves logic out of human\ndiscourse to formulate it in a symbolic language. Frege’s\nfunctionalist notation promises to express all forms of truth with the\naim, Nye suggests, “that thought will be unified and logical\nerrors in science, mathematics, and philosophy exposed” (1990:\n131). Using Frege’s approach, how a concept refers to the world\nbecomes “an objective fact:…one cannot invent its\nvalue” (1990: 135). As a result, the institutions that render\nconcepts meaningful, including the social institution of language,\nstand beyond question, creating a new form of muteness that harkens\nback to Parmenides. The surrounding silence breaks again when the\nVienna Circle adds empirical input in place of the concepts on which\nthe Fregean functions work. Nye indicates that this theoretical\ndevelopment places science above meaningful criticism, and so allows\nscientific reasoning to be co-opted by authoritarian regimes (1990:\n163–171). \nAs an alternative to logic, Nye suggests building confidence for women\nand developing new concepts aided by a concrete (natural, not\nartificial) “women’s language”. Discourse that is\nfor or about women might provide inclusion, bonding, and ways to share\npower. Women have relied historically on the skills needed for\nreading: \nWe have listened and read to survive, we have read to predict the\nmaneuvers of those in power over us, to seduce those who might help\nus, to pacify bullies, to care for children, to nurse the sick and the\nwounded. (1990: 184) \nThe next step lies in developing the language to respond. \nNye’s experiment in avoiding argument falters in two ways\nobserved by feminists and other scholars who have not been convinced\nby her socio-historical reading. Some cite errors in her historical\ninterpretation (Keith 1993; Weiner 1994). Others find that in\nWords of Power, Nye does argue, but fails to persuade and so\nfails to provide the alternative to logic she seeks (Gilbert 1994;\nAyim 1995). \nGilbert offers a related but distinct criticism of formal logic for\nits role in the “Critical-Logical” approach that he\ncharacterizes as extracting text from utterances for the purposes of\napplying a competitive or eristic process to the stylized text (1994).\nHe suggests, like Moulton (1983), that such abstraction serves the\ncompetitive functions and standard practice of Euro-American academic\nphilosophy. Because arguing need not adhere to the Critical-Logical\nmodel, it remains possible that feminine styles of reasoning may\nground effective interpretive practices for arguers. Arguing also may\nfind natural corollaries in other styles of communication and other\nvalues that operate within communication. \nReasoners appeal to logic and to other abstract accounts of what other\narguers say partly so they might avoid bias as they interpret natural\nlanguage. Yet such abstract interpretation may favor forms of argument\nevaluation unsuited to the context of utterance. For instance, if the\nCritical-Logical model of argument evaluation provides the basis for\nlegal procedures, then it may compromise access to justice for people\nwho are socially marginalized based on gender, race, class, and\neducation. Gilbert echoes Nye’s concern that logical systems can\nreflect the lingua franca of the ruling class that captures\ntheir own interests (1994: 105). Applying it to other contexts risks\ndistorting and disenfranchising other people and their modes of\ncommunication. \nNye concedes that a women’s language cannot stand up to the\npower and authority of logic but believes that perhaps reasoners may\ngain something different from a replacement for logic. It may be\nthat \nher notion of reading teaches that the circumstances in which\nsomething is said and the person who says it are relevant\nconsiderations. (Tindale 1999: 196) \nThe appeal of Nye’s “reading” may be that \ncurrently popular theories of reading, unlike traditional logic,\nhighlight rather than diminish the interests, personality, and motives\nthat the reader brings to the task of reading. (Ayim 1995: 807) \nArguers can emphasize the moral goals behind an argument through their\nemotional language. Likewise, an explanatory purpose for an argument\nwould mean that the speaker offers it up as a truthful description\nrather than as a subject for debate (Gilbert 1994). Such purposes and\nvalues can fall away with the abstraction of a premise-conclusion\ncomplex from its context of utterance. When the Critical-Logical model\ngrounds decision-making processes, the authority it carries creates\nproblems for anyone using other styles of reasoning and\ncommunication. \nNote that Nye is the only feminist philosopher to date suggesting a\nsubstitute for arguing and logic. Ayim (1995) and Gilbert (1994)\nstress that different styles of communication and value-systems can be\nnatural corollaries for each other. Govier (1993) further suggests\nthat the power of universal logic may be indispensable, and that\nfeminist concerns can be addressed through a better understanding of\nthe interpretation and application of logical norms. \nRhetorical studies attend to argument audiences in a way that can help\nto address feminist concerns about the emotional and gendered aspects\nof argument (Tindale 1999: 201). They may also help to resolve a\ndilemma of feminist arguing practice by demonstrating how the\nadvancement of feminist affirmative projects, such as acknowledging\nthe significance of women’s experience, may require adversarial\nforms of argumentation often associated with masculinity.\nCommunication styles identified as rhetoric create both problematic\nand constructive aspects of social identity, including feminine\nidentity. Rhetorical analysis of the situational specifics can reveal\nhow communication helps to produce social identities and can suggest\nways to address particular power differences among reasoners (Bruner\n1996; Palczewski 2016). \nM. Lane Bruner argues that some aspects of gender stereotypes make it\nharder to argue, while other aspects make it easier (1996).\nDistinguishing the empowering from the disempowering aspects of social\nidentity depends on examining the ways in which\n“masculine” identity is tied up with ideals of arguing and\nthe ways in which identity politics can counteract the power of\ndominant identities. Although speakers must suppress each of their\nunique differences from others in order to communicate explicitly in\nregard to their own social positions, the resulting feminine and\nmasculine identifications do not become fixed. Because identities are\ncreated, they must be maintained and they remain subject to\ntransformation. That flux in identity gives feminists strategic\nopportunities for developing women’s argumentation and giving\ncredit to it. \nRooney notes that an artificial severing of arguing from narrative and\nrhetorical practices helps to dissociate arguments from femininity and\nfrustrates feminist practices of philosophical arguing (2010; Le\nDoeuff 1980 [1989]). Research that attends to rhetoric and its\ninfluences may go under the name of “rhetorical studies”\n(often in English or literature departments) but may also be found in\ncommunications studies, psychology, and interdisciplinary fields such\nas women’s and gender studies or argumentation studies.\nRhetorical studies give attention to the perspective of a particular\naudience and that concern with the audience and the various interests\naudiences may have challenges the view—especially in the\ndiscipline of philosophy—that reasoning and argumentation must\nbe a constant battle. Rooney argues that philosophical practice itself\ninvolves rhetoric and narrative through myths, thought experiments,\nand metaphors. These rhetorical practices make theories more\nattractive to specific audiences. Philosophers commonly portray reason\nas in battle against feminine forces which “primarily makes\nsense to men among men in cultural contexts where sexism or misogyny\nis a cultural given” (2010: 227). \nRhetorical studies of speakers, audiences, their purposes, and their\nsocial contexts were revived in twentieth century argumentation theory\nby Chaim Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca (1958 [1969]). Perelman,\nwriting on his own, advocates that instead of appealing to “the\nrational” as a standard for argumentation, scholars should\nconsider a “reasonable” person in terms of the standards\nof a particular community (1977 [1982]). \nThe discipline of rhetorical studies typically takes persuasion to be\nthe goal of arguing. Some feminists resist this assumption. Concern\nthat persuasion may be intrinsically an act of domination of one\nperson over another and even an act of violence (Gearhart 1979) led\nfeminist rhetoricians to develop an alternative in “invitational\nrhetoric” that makes understanding the goal of arguing (Foss\n& Griffin 1995; Bone et al. 2008). This approach resonates with\nrhetoric’s Aristotelian history, Christopher Tindale observes,\nwhich does not involve intentions to change another person that some\nfeminists consider violent, because Aristotle conceives change as an\ninternal process. On Tindale’s model of “rhetorical\nargumentation”, \nthe audience, when persuaded, is persuaded by its own deliberations,\nafter reflection on reasoning that it has understood in its own terms\nand may even have had a hand in completing. (1999: 191) \nHowever, at the same time, invitational rhetoric demands a civility\nthat may presume social equality (Lozano-Reich & Cloud 2009) and\nthus it faces the same problems as politeness (addressed in\n Section 2). \nLinker suggests that reasoning across power differences can be aided\nby speakers employing a process of “intellectual empathy”;\nother people’s claims, especially if these people are relatively\ndisadvantaged, can help reflect on one’s own interpretive\nassumptions in order to move past unreflective bias (2011; 2015).\nRelatedly, an attitude of playfulness may facilitate consideration of\nanother’s perspective, that is, “travelling” to the\nperson’s “world” as described by Maria Lugones\n(1987). Perhaps this attitude will help philosophers appreciate the\nviewpoints presented in feminist epistemology (Lang 2010). However,\nMariana Ortega (2006) warns that the radical potential of playfulness\ndemands a deep engagement with work by women of color. Superficial\ncitation of women of color by white feminists only replicates\noppressive gatekeeping in philosophical argumentation. \nAssuming the goal of arguing to be persuasion invokes a limited\ncontext and one that poses problems for some feminists, especially\nregarding power differences among speakers. Nevertheless, rhetorical\nanalysis offers many resources for feminist analysis because its\nattention to the audience provides valuable details about the\nsituations in which people argue. As we will see next, recent work in\nphilosophy concerning credibility and developing the concept of\n“argumentative injustice” articulates persistent concerns\nfor feminists about arguing, as does both regular and feminist\nphilosophical scholarship about fallacies and critical thinking\neducation. \nCredibility granted to speakers and their testimony affects processes\nof arguing and may adhere to social categories following lines of\ngender and other axes of oppression (Govier 1993). Miranda Fricker\n(2007) describes the case of testimonial injustice, which is a species\nof epistemic injustice, and identifies when a listener gives\ndiminished credibility or epistemic authority to a speaker based on\nthat speaker’s social identity. Patrick Bondy (2010) defines\nanalogous “argumentative injustice” as consisting in a\nrelated harm done to the processes of arguing when people wrongly\nassess an arguer’s credibility. We can underestimate or\noverestimate an arguer’s credibility by using social stereotypes\nto assess it (2010). Bondy explains that both overestimation and\nunderestimation can result from viewing testifiers through social\nstereotypes—typically men’s credibility becomes\noverestimated whereas women’s becomes underestimated.\nAdditionally, testimony from people with social identities different\nfrom our own may be difficult to accept simply because their\nexperiences contrast with our own and those experiences with which we\nidentify. This second problem when considered as a fallacy goes by the\nname of “provincialism” (Kahane & Cavender\n2001) and is sometimes attributed to the psychology of in-group\nbias (Brewer 1979; Rudman & Goodman 2004). Whether due to\nstereotypes or to in-group bias, being discounted as a participant in\ndiscussion amounts to an epistemic injustice that Christopher Hookway\n(2010) describes as “participant injustice”. \nBondy argues that an underestimated testifier loses at least some\ncapacity for critical engagement with other people. This capacity\nmight progressively deteriorate, or the person might internalize its\ndiminished form. Underestimating a testifier undermines the\nrationality of arguing processes with the result that the audience\ntends to lose potentially valuable information and insight. On the\nother hand, an overestimated testifier also can fail to gain valuable\ninformation from others, derailing the argumentative exchange by\npreventing the success of the better line of reasoning. After the\nparticular discussion, the overestimated person can come to be viewed\nas beyond scrutiny, thus losing (at least on occasion) the benefits of\nengaging in discursive argumentation. By contrast, Fricker’s\noriginal conception of testimonial injustice accounts for the harmful\neffects on knowers only when their testimony is underestimated, and\nshe argues that epistemic injustice does not accrue from\noverestimating credibility. \nThe solution to argumentative injustice might be simply for the\nlistener to take care to treat arguers on their own terms. This would\navoid viewing people in terms of group membership, a practice that\nleaves reasoners vulnerable to stereotype-thinking (Govier 1993,\n1999). However, sometimes people’s social identities are\nrelevant to the credibility of what they say, when, for instance, it\nconcerns their personal experience of discrimination. Also, social\nstereotypes influence our thinking unconsciously, in a way that earns\nthe label “implicit bias”. This bias differs from in-group\nbias but works alongside it, sometimes reinforcing it and sometimes\nconflicting with it. As a result, women often hold prejudices against\nother women (and even themselves) just as men do, and people of color\nmay hold unconscious biases against their own ethnicity. When such\nbias persists despite conscious beliefs to the contrary, psychologists\ndescribe it as “aversive bias” (Greenwald & Banaji\n1995; Jost, Banaji, & Nosek 2004; Kay & Zanna 2009). \nImplicit social biases work like other cognitive biases, such as those\nthat encourage us to generalize from small samples and personal\nexperience and can affect many of our best intentions in reasoning and\nargumentation. Insofar as these biases undermine our ability to manage\nour own confidence, they frustrate the virtue of intellectual humility\nthat otherwise might offset adversarial inclinations and momentum when\npeople argue (Kidd 2016; Aberdein 2016). Ian James Kidd considers ways\nin which arguing can foster humility, and suggests that ideally,\narguing \nis also a route to other intellectual and ethical goods such as truth,\nknowledge, and enlightenment, as the ancient philosophers maintained.\n(2016: 399) \nThe challenge remains to bridge the real and the ideal. \nBondy argues that because social bias may be inevitable in\npeople’s perception of speakers’ credibility, we need to\ncounteract it actively. He recommends that we adopt a general attitude\nof “metadistrust” in which we exercise skepticism about\nour credibility judgments regarding testimony from people belonging to\nmarginalized social groups. \nAlternatively, we might try “intellectual empathy” based\non mutual compassion, which is the approach that Linker develops. She\nargues that compassion must involve consciousness of how oppression\noperates through specific intersecting social matrices, including\nsocial privileges that can be very difficult to recognize. Such\nintersectional intellectual empathy may especially help us realize\nthat it is our own biases or limited experiences that lead us\nto dismiss others’ testimony by interpreting them as whining,\ncomplaining, or “playing the gender (or race, etc.) card”\n(Linker 2011, 2015). \nAchieving epistemic justice when we argue requires some sort of\naccounting for the identities of arguers, and might include appeal to\nthe “epistemic privilege” described in feminist standpoint\nepistemology. Some standpoint theorists maintain that epistemic\nprivilege can accrue to people who oppose oppression. Their engagement\nwith the lives of oppressed people and their resistance to the\noppression structuring those lives provides a unique and valuable\nawareness of the social structures of power. Thus a “feminist\nstandpoint” and those who achieve it may gain epistemic\nadvantage from fighting the oppressed condition of women’s\nlives. Although it is not necessary to be a woman to achieve this\nstandpoint and its advantage, women themselves may most easily achieve\nit (Harding 1991; Intemann 2010). \nOne way that arguers might try to address the effects of social\nposition on arguing is through meta-debate—a background argument\nmay address arguers’ biases operating in the central discussion\n(Kotzee 2010). However, Linker (2014) argues that regardless of what\nthe meta-debate yields, the person with social privilege will continue\nto benefit from debates that are adversarial. Arguers have difficulty\nrecognizing when their biases reflect their own social privilege at\nany level of debate because social identity frequently affects\ntestimonial authority unconsciously. \nLinker suggests that we treat epistemic privilege as a form of\nexpertise about arguing. This allows feminists and other\nanti-oppression advocates to set the bounds for ending inquiry (2014).\nSuch advocates operate as the authority and determine the\nplace where explanation stops (Hanrahan & Antony 2005). Rooney\nargues that this kind of expertise should be accorded to women\nphilosophers whose lived experience tends to ground their feminist\nphilosophy. Arguers should recognize expertise in situations \nwhere A’s minority status relative to B (with\nrespect to some locally salient status or power differential) makes it\nlikely that A has insights and understandings relating to\nP that are less available to B. (2012: 322) \nRooney says that speaking from personal experience becomes important\nfor arguing because of the “hermeneutical injustices”\n(Fricker 2007) facing women. Hermeneutical injustice, according to\nFricker, means that women’s experiences may not receive adequate\nconsideration because the language to describe them is underdeveloped.\nMen may therefore have trouble recognizing evidence that women\nprovide, and they \nare not in the same position as women to confidently assert whether\nthey find it plausible or not because they do not have access to the\nevidence in the way women are likely to have. (Rooney 2012: 328) \nArgumentation theory has a tradition of taking fallacies as an\noperational concept for identifying problems with arguments. The types\nof deficiency identified as fallacies emerge from disparate points in\nthe history of philosophy, and, as Charles Hamblin (1970) first\nrecognized, the fallacies approach to argument evaluation tends to\nlack consensus regarding what constitutes a fallacy. Further, many\ntheorists find that “fallacy” fails as both an analytic\ncategory (Massey 1995) and a pedagogical tool (Hitchcock 1995), and\nyet the scholarly controversy has not put a stop to the regular use of\nfallacies for evaluating arguments and for teaching reasoning.\nFeminists share the ambivalence of other philosophers regarding\nfallacies, adding their own criticisms and developments, but a\nspecific controversy emerges in regard to the adversarial nature of\nfallacies. \nSome feminists decry the inadequacy of traditional fallacies for\naddressing problems women face in argument exchanges (Al Tamimi 2011)\nand others point out how some philosophers use fallacy labels to\ndismiss and silence feminist\n philosophers.[5]\n In particular, when feminist philosophers employ arguments concerning\nthe history of philosophy, they have been charged with committing the\ngenetic fallacy (e.g., Levin 1988). That fallacy results from taking\nthe significance of a claim or theory to depend on its origin and\nhistory—its genesis—and thereby dismissing that view\nwithout attention to its current meaning and context. Feminist\nphilosophers consider how the fact that mostly men developed certain\ntheories, including many philosophical theories, may undermine the\njustification for applying these theories to women. In doing so,\nfeminists also attend to how those theories currently operate. \nThe difficulty some philosophers have in recognizing the\nsophistication of feminist historical criticism regarding\nphilosophical theories may be due, first, to feminist use of certain\ntheories that were the target for philosophers who developed the\ncategory “genetic fallacy”. Margaret Crouch explains that\nthe concept of the genetic fallacy was developed only in the early\ntwentieth century by some philosophers in the analytic tradition with\nthe explicit intention of discounting the scientific status of Marxist\nand Freudian accounts. Given that Marxist and Freudian accounts from\nthe continental European tradition have influenced a good deal of\nfeminist theory, Crouch argues that it is unsurprising that feminist\nanalysis might seem at first glance to commit the genetic fallacy\n(1991; 1993). \nMoreover, Crouch argues, employing the label of “genetic\nfallacy” against feminist criticisms of the historically\nmasculine sources for popular views in the discipline of philosophy\nrelies on a misunderstanding of what constitutes a fallacy at a point\nwhere reasonable consensus has emerged: not every instance of a\npattern of reasoning associated with a fallacy label—here\ngenetic appeals—constitutes that fallacy; there may be\nexceptions and even highly reasonable practices that employ the same\npattern. So, some appeals to personal characteristics are relevant and\ndo not commit the ad hominem fallacy and some appeals to\nauthority are perfectly reasonable and not cases of the ad\nverecundiam fallacy (Walton 1995). Scholarship on the genetic\nfallacy likewise recognizes that the way a theory developed\nhistorically only sometimes affects the value of the\nreasoning now supporting it. In particular, Crouch explains that the\ngenesis of a claim affects its justification when testimony provides\nits only support, or when a claim involves the speaker as a subject,\nand whenever the source of information has an objective connection\nsupporting the statement’s truth or falsity (1991; 1993). \nThe charge that feminist epistemology commits the genetic fallacy in\nasking such questions about the origins of the canon not only depends\non a misunderstanding of that fallacy, the criticism itself also\ncommits the fallacy of begging the question. Critics of some feminist\nphilosophy make the epistemological assumption that the origins of a\nbelief are irrelevant to its justification, which is the very\nclaim that these feminists reject (see Crouch 1991). For instance,\nstandpoint theorists argue that women’s material situation\naffects and can advantage the types of understanding that women and\nfeminists have (Harding 1991). Critics of feminist epistemology cannot\nsimply assume that the use of a certain type of premise makes a line\nof reasoning unjustified. \nThis kind of exchange between feminists and their critics—one\nthat involves each party accusing the other of committing\nfallacies—illustrates how arguers may use fallacy labels to\ncharacterize their disagreements. Some feminists advocate fallacy\nanalysis as a contextualized form of epistemology (Janack & Adams\n1999) and some suggest the development of new fallacy labels to help\naddress feminist epistemological concerns. Code suggests a counterpart\nfor ad hominem be known as ad feminam to address how\nlisteners and audiences discount women’s testimony (1995:\n58–82). Also, androcentrism, the assumption of a masculine\nstandard, can be named as a typical problem arising in argumentation\nby using the fallacies approach. More generally, Hundleby (2016)\nargues that assuming the desirability of stereotypic qualities of\npeople who tend to be systematically granted social authority, such as\nmen and white people, may be identified as the “status quo\nfallacy”. Better education about fallacies in argumentation may\nhelp to address the implicit bias that can underlie the “status\nquo fallacy”. The proposal of new fallacy labels, for example,\nad stuprum or the appeal to sex (Anger & Hundleby 2016),\nis by no means unique to feminism, but it offers special power for\nsocial justice projects in providing language to account for socially\nmarginalized experience, thus addressing hermeneutical injustices. \nProficiency with the fallacies approach can be empowering even though\nany claim that a fallacy has been committed makes disagreement\nexplicit and that involves an adversarial quality which can make it\ndifficult for socially marginalized people to use. It entails at least\na minimal level of adversariality of the sort described by Govier\n(1999): “minimal adversariality” is opposition to another\nperson’s view but not to the person. The involvement of\neven this minimal level of adversariality may make the fallacies\napproach a form of argument analysis difficult for members of\nsubordinated classes to employ in contexts where socialization and\nnorms of politeness discourage subordinates from expressing dissent\n(Rooney 2003). Yet, some individual women find success in adversarial\nengagement, some take pleasure in the heightened opposition of debate,\nand adversarial conversation is key to some women’s culture and\nidentity (Schiffrin 1984; Henning 2018, 2021). Moreover, opposition is\nnecessary for feminist resistance, struggle, and change. In these\nways, women, feminists, and others with related liberatory projects\ncan find unique resources in the adversariality of the fallacies\napproach. \nFallacies remain a popular way to teach reasoning, as does argument\nanalysis more generally. Both play central roles in the content of\nCanadian, US, and UK post-secondary education as part of the set of\nskills regularly taught under the name “critical thinking”\nin philosophy departments. Education allows cultures of reasoning to\nreinforce and reproduce themselves and these cultures affect the\nprospects for feminist transformation of the larger society.\nEducational institutions have authority and grant authority to systems\nof thought and to individuals and in this way critical thinking\neducation provides opportunities for conformity or for social\ntransformation, starting at the level of individual reasoning and\ninterpersonal discourse. In many ways, the ideal and practice of\ncritical thinking serves social progress but in other ways it needs\nreform. \nThe way that argument education works its way from the academy into\nordinary reasoning practices may be rather indirect and slow but\nacademic philosophy is not merely one discourse among others and it\nhas a central role in validating or authorizing other discourses\n(Alcoff 1993), especially in the epistemological assumptions conveyed\nthrough critical thinking pedagogy. Courses in critical thinking\nbecame stock components of the undergraduate curriculum during the\nlate twentieth century and so the standards for reasoning implicit in\n“critical thinking” as an educational goal for students\ndirectly impact on countless students every year. Critical thinking\noperates as a specifically Western practice and ideal that provides\nalternatives to patterns of reasoning that enforce male dominance in\nvarious cultures, Western culture included (Norris 1995). The appeals\nto individual rationality and independent reasoning in the critical\nthinking curriculum contrast with appeals to tradition and with\nprioritizing community and personal relationships. \nSystems of thinking, such as theories or logics, and speech acts, such\nas arguments, can hold authority that is not attached to a specific\nspeaker or type of speaker, even though people may be paradigmatic\nholders of authority. The authority of social institutions, especially\nin their claims to be objective, Code argues (1995: 21, 181), may be\nlikewise justified or not justified. Granting the justification of\ndepersonalized authorities that include institutions of postsecondary\neducation becomes second nature in a technological society, while\nthose who lack social status and expertise have heightened dependence\non the authority of expertise. This authority actually lies in the\nhands of people who have social privilege and yet people who are\nsocially marginalized have a serious stake in the institutions that\ndevelop knowledge, from the legal system and the media to the pedagogy\nof argumentation in the form of “critical thinking”\neducation (Hundleby 2013b). \nHundleby makes a case that critical thinking courses provided by\nphilosophy departments currently tend to reinforce disciplinary biases\nbecause they invoke an authority that lacks the monitoring and\nevaluation that justifies authority (Hanrahan & Antony 2005). The\ntypical way that textbooks present fallacies exhibits ignorance of the\ncurrent informal logic scholarship, which would provide the\nappropriate source of expertise. There are few textbooks written by\nscholars who have published even one article in argumentation or logic\nand these same textbooks written by non-specialists are most likely to\nevince the Adversary Method described by Moulton (1983). The\nunreflective nature of dependence on that Method suggests that it\nremains authoritative—as well as\n“paradigmatic”—in philosophy (Hundleby 2010). \nGilbert argues that critical thinking education ought to affirm a\nrange of considerations that do not enter into traditional logic\n(Gilbert 1994: 111). Contemporary philosophical theorizing tends to\ntreat arguments as premise-conclusion complexes, merely as\n“products” of the discourse that generates them (Wenzel\n1980 [1992]), without considering the processes that give rise to\nthem. The focus on premise-conclusion complexes obscures factors\nrelevant to the feminist goal of preventing harm (Lang 2010) and such\na lack of appropriate “rhetorical spaces” or conceptual\nframeworks in philosophy impedes the education of people about the\nproblems that women face (Code 1995). The standard Euro-American\nphilosophical practices of the Adversary Paradigm or the\nCritical-Logical model sideline important aspects of arguing that\nindicate the significance and cogency of feminist claims about things\nlike the social identities of arguers. Argument has a testimonial\ndimension, as Audrey Yap explains (2013; 2015). Consciousness of such\nsituational aspects of reasoning and philosophical argumentation\nfacilitates the appreciation of feminist perspectives. It also\nprovides for more rigorous analysis and more thoroughly critical\nthinking. \nBucking the large trend of textbooks that fail to reflect the\nargumentation scholarship, Linker (2015) follows in a minor tradition\nof textbooks by expert authors that also advance scholarly theorizing\nabout argumentation (e.g., Govier 1985; Johnson & Blair 1977;\nMakau & Marty 2001, 2013). Her Intellectual Empathy aims\nto provide reasoners with skills for understanding how social\ninequalities affect people’s lives and how those structures are\nmaintained. The first three skills involved in “intellectual\nempathy” are: (i) understanding the invisibility of privilege;\n(ii) knowing that social identity is\n intersectional;[6]\n and (iii) using models of cooperative reasoning. Linker argues that\nsocial identity lies at the center of what Quine calls the “web\nof\n belief”,[7]\n which is to say it is deeply connected with many of a person’s\nbeliefs; and for Linker that involves it in their self-esteem. The\npersonal stake people have in their social identities means that\ndiscussion that engages our identities can be emotionally fraught. We\n“take it personally”. When people are arguing about\naspects of social identity, they often fall into feelings of blame or\nguilt. Linker suggests that reasoners can find alternatives to such\ndestructive responses by consideration of the complexities of\neveryone’s individual situation regarding social privilege.\nAttending to the specificities of each other’s perspectives\nallows us to better understand each other and set up reasoners for\nmore cooperative and less adversarial arguing (Linker 2015: 98). \nAccording to Linker, intellectual empathy also requires that when\nencountering a view that seems biased or stereotypical reasoners (iv)\napply a principle of conditional trust, treating the person holding\nthe view as reasonable and well-intentioned. This assumption allows us\nbetter to learn about the real reasons the person holds the view, and\ngenerally improves the audience’s ability to gather and share\nevidence (2015: 156–158). \nFinally, Linker advises (v) recognizing our mutual vulnerability to\nbias and stereotype, while at the same time allowing ourselves to be\nresponsive and accommodating to new information. This demands courage\nand strength. Linker’s five skills thus provide a way to address\nthe testimonial dimensions of arguing with special attention to their\noperation when people argue from very different social locations. This\nvision of critical thinking steps forward in addressing feminist\nconcerns with the cultures and practices of argumentation. \nIn conclusion, as we see especially in the discussions of fallacies\nand argument pedagogy as well as in the dominance of the Adversary\nMethod, feminist philosophical work on argumentation reveals a need\nfor philosophers to attend to argumentation scholarship. Outdated or\nunscholarly conceptions of how different modes and styles of arguing\nserve the advancement of knowledge can undermine the value of\nphilosophical reasoning and specifically how philosophers respond to\nfeminist philosophy. Yet, the work by interdisciplinary argumentation\nscholars and feminist philosophers to explore these tensions receives\nlittle uptake in the discipline of philosophy. \nAmong the feminist topics in argumentation scholarship that remain in\nneed of philosophical attention are: the range and complexity of\nvalues that arguing can serve, including social justice, social\nbonding, dispute resolution, and knowledge; and more thorough\nrepresentations of arguing practices that account for how discursive\nnorms code power and privilege, such as through politeness and\ntestimonial authority. Feminist research on these topics will be\nimportant for scholarship on argumentation and also for the discipline\nof philosophy, given the centrality of arguing to its practice.\nInterdisciplinary vantage points on argumentation provide resources\nuseful for feminist purposes and promise a broader perspective that\nmight unify different feminist concerns; at the same time, other\ndisciplines can face their own challenges from a feminist perspective,\nas rhetorical studies does for taking persuasion to provide the only\npurpose for arguing. \nFeminist concerns about argumentation pull in different directions and\ncreate a great deal of room for further research. Feminists regularly\noppose practices and theories central to the discipline of philosophy\nand some such form of opposition is intrinsic to feminist work. Yet\nfeminists criticize overemphasis on the opposition that occurs in the\ndefault adoption of adversarial styles of reasoning in philosophy and\nin the assumption that arguers must oppose each other or that they\nmust have contrary beliefs. Appeals to politeness do not provide the\neasy resolution to these concerns that some argumentation theorists\noften presume. In addition, although some of the worst tendencies in\nargumentation scholarship may be passed on generation to generation in\ncritical thinking classes taught by philosophers, these classes have\npotential to create progress toward social justice. Let us note that,\noverall, feminist perspectives on argumentation challenge broad social\nand epistemological norms as well as attend to the ways the norms play\nout in the culture of critical thinking, academic philosophy, and\nother accepted standards for shared reasoning.","contact.mail":"hundleby@uwindsor.ca","contact.domain":"uwindsor.ca"}]
