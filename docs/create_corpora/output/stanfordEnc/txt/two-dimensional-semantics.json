Two-dimensional\nsemantics has also been applied to thought contents. In contrast with\nstandard possible worlds semantics, 2D semantics assigns extensions\nand truth-values to expressions relative to two possible world\nparameters, rather than just one. So a 2D semantic framework provides\nfiner-grained semantic values than those available within standard\npossible world semantics, while using the same basic model-theoretic\nresources. The 2D framework itself is just a formal tool. To develop a\nsemantic theory for someone’s language, a proponent of 2D semantics\nmust do three things: (i) explain what exactly the two possible world\nparameters represent, (ii) explain the rules for assigning 2D semantic\nvalues to a person’s words and sentences, and (iii) explain how 2D\nsemantic values help in understanding the meanings of the person’s\nwords and sentences.\n\n\nThe two-dimensional framework has been interpreted in different ways\nfor different explanatory purposes. The two most widely accepted\napplications of two-dimensional semantics target restricted classes of\nexpressions. David Kaplan’s 2D semantic framework for indexicals is\nwidely used to explain conventional semantic rules governing\ncontext-dependent expressions like ‘I’,\n‘that’, or ‘here’, which pick out different\nthings depending on the context in which the expression is used. And\nlogicians working on tense and modal logic use 2D semantics to\ncharacterize the logical implications of operators like\n‘now’, ‘actually’, and\n‘necessarily’. Such restricted applications of 2D\nsemantics are intended to systematize and explain uncontroversial\naspects of linguistic understanding.\n\n\nTwo-dimensional semantics has also been used for more ambitious\nphilosophical purposes. Influential theorists like David Lewis, Frank\nJackson and David Chalmers argue that a generalized 2D semantic\nframework can be used to isolate an apriori aspect of meaning.\nRoughly, the idea is that speakers always have apriori access to the\ntruth-conditions associated with their own sentences. On the face of\nit, this apriority claim seems to conflict with the observation that\ncertain necessary truths, such as ‘water =\nH2O’, can be known only on the basis of empirical\ninquiry. But proponents of generalized 2D semantics argue that the 2D\nframework undercuts this objection, by showing how such aposteriori\nnecessities are consistent with apriori access to truth-conditions.\nThe positive reasons to accept generalized 2D semantics, however, are\nbound up with larger (and partly disjoint) explanatory projects. As a\nconsequence, debates over the merits of generalized 2D semantics touch\non broader controversies about apriority, modality, semantic theory\nand philosophical methodology.\n\n\nThe two-dimensional framework can also figure in a theory of ad\nhoc language use, instead of a theory of literal meanings. Robert\nStalnaker’s influential 2D account of assertion falls in this\ncategory. His “metasemantic” interpretation of the 2D\nframework is intended to characterize what is communicated when\nconversational partners are partially ignorant or mistaken about the\nliteral meaning of their own words. Although it is formally similar to\ngeneralized 2D semantics, Stalnaker’s use of the 2D framework avoids\napriori accessible truth-conditions of the sort posited by generalized\n2D semantics.\n\n\nReaders who are unfamiliar with the 2D framework and want to get an\noverall sense of the formalism and its philosophical applications\nshould read section 1 plus the subsequent “overview”\nsections. Those already familiar with the basic 2D framework may skip\nsection 1 and move directly to sections 2 and 3, which contrast recent\nphilosophical applications of the framework.\n\nA good way to get an intuitive feel for the basic structure of a\ntwo-dimensional semantic framework is to consider the semantics of\ncontext-dependent “indexical” expressions like\n‘I’ or ‘this’. \nSemantic theories explain how the truth or falsity of whole sentences\ndepends on the meanings of their parts by stating rules governing the\ninterpretation of subsentential expressions and their modes of\ncombination. A semantic framework provides a standard formalism for\nstating such rules. The simplest (0-dimensional) semantic frameworks\nwork by assigning extensions as the semantic values of\nparticular expressions. Intuitively, the extension includes those\nthings in the actual world to which the expression applies: e.g., the\nextension of the name ‘Barack Obama’ is the man Obama, the\nextension of the predicate ‘is cool’ is the set of all the\nactual cool things, and the extension of a two-place predicate\n‘is cooler than’ is the set of pairs of actually existing\nthings the first of which is cooler than the second. A whole sentence\nis assigned a truth-value (True or False) as its extension, which is\ncomputed on the basis of the extensions of the component expressions:\ne.g., the sentence, ‘Barack Obama is cool’, will have the\nsemantic value True just in case Obama is a member of the set of\nactual cool things. A two-dimensional semantic framework is the result\nof enriching this simple extensional framework in two distinct\nways. \nThe first enrichment, standard possible worlds semantics, is\nintroduced in order to explain the meaning of modal operators like\n‘possible’ and ‘necessary’ and to distinguish\nthe intuitive subject matter represented by particular subsentential\nexpressions. Consider the expressions ‘Roger Federer’,\n‘the greatest tennis player of all time’, and ‘the\nmost famous Swiss citizen in 2010’. All three expressions happen\nto have exactly the same extension: a particular individual RF. So a\nsimple extensional semantics will assign exactly the same semantic\nvalue to all three expressions. But clearly they differ in meaning: if\nevents had unfolded only slightly differently than they actually did,\nthe three expressions would pick out different people. For instance,\nif Federer had decided to go into banking instead of tennis, Jean\nPiaget might have been the best known Swiss citizen and Rod Laver the\ngreatest tennis player; but of course Federer would still have been\nFederer. In general, definite descriptions like ‘the greatest\ntennis player’ or ‘the most famous Swiss citizen’\npick out different individuals depending on who happens to have the\nrelevant properties in counterfactual situations; whereas proper names\nlike ‘Roger Federer’ rigidly pick out the very\nsame individual in every possible\n situation.[1]\n [See entry on\n rigid designators.]\n Moreover, such differences in what expressions pick out in\ncounterfactual situations affect the truth of modal claims: e.g.,\n‘Federer is necessarily Federer’ is true, but\n‘Federer is necessarily the greatest tennis player’ is\nfalse. So there seems to be an aspect of meaning that is not captured\nin simple extensional semantics. The basic idea behind possible world\nsemantics is to map out such differences in meaning by specifying what\nan expression picks out relative to every possible way the world\ncould be (every “possible world”). \nIn standard (1-dimensional) possible worlds semantics, the semantic\nvalue of an expression is an intension, a function that\nassigns an extension to the expression “at” every possible\nworld. For instance, the semantic value of a definite description like\n‘the best known Swiss citizen’ is a function that takes as\ninput a possible world and yields as output whoever happens to satisfy\nthat description in that world, and the semantic value of a proper\nname like ‘Roger Federer’ is a constant function that maps\nevery possible world to the very same individual, RF. Such intensions\nallow the semantic theorist to capture commonsense intuitions about\nthe nature of the objects, kinds, or properties picked out by\nparticular expressions. The nature of Federer is reflected in the\ndifferent properties he could have in different possible situations,\nand the nature of being the greatest tennis player is reflected in the\nproperties of the individuals who satisfy that description in\ndifferent possible situations. Standard possible worlds semantics\nprovides a unified framework for keeping track of such modal\nintuitions—intuitions about the “modal profile” of\nthe objects, kinds and properties picked out by our\n words.[2]\n The possible worlds framework also helps explain the meaning of modal\noperators like ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’: a\nsentence is necessarily true just in case it is true at every possible\nworld, and it is possibly true just in case it is true at some\npossible world. So we can think of the semantic value of the modal\noperator ‘necessarily’ as a function that maps necessarily\ntrue sentences to the truth value True and all other sentences to the\nvalue False. This sort of possible worlds semantics is the standard\nformal framework for clarifying the content of modal claims and the\nlogical relations among them. [See the entries on\n intensional Logic\n and\n modal logic.] \nThe second enrichment of the basic extensional semantic\nframework—the one that is distinctive of two-dimensional\nsemantics—requires us to take possible worlds into account in a\ndifferent way. To see why this might be necessary for an adequate\naccount of meaning, let’s focus on context sensitive expressions like\n‘I’, ‘here’ or ‘this’. In one\nrespect, these terms function like names, picking out the very same\nthing in every possible world. For instance, if Hillary Rodham Clinton\nsays ‘I could have been president’, her word\n‘I’ refers rigidly to the very same woman, HRC, in every\npossible world and her claim is true just in case there is a possible\nway the world could be in which that very woman is president. In\nstandard possible worlds semantics, then, the semantic value of\nClinton’s utterance of ‘I’ will be exactly the same as an\nutterance of the name ‘Hillary Rodham Clinton’: a function\nthat yields the individual HRC for every possible world. But clearly\nthe English word ‘I’ is not synonymous with the name\n‘Hillary Rodham Clinton’—for John McCain might utter\nthe sentence ‘I could have been president’ and in his\nmouth the word ‘I’ would refer rigidly to a different\nperson, JM, in every possible world. What’s distinctive of\ncontext-sensitive expressions like ‘I’ or\n‘this’ is that they represent different things depending\non the context in which they are used. David Kaplan\n (1989)[3]\n first brought widespread attention to this phenomenon of\ncontext-dependence by proposing a highly influential two-dimensional\nsemantic theory to clarify the rules governing such expressions [see\nthe entry on\n indexicals]. \nKaplan distinguishes two different aspects of the meaning of\nexpressions in a public language. The first aspect, content,\nreflects the modal profile of the object, kind or property\nrepresented. This is the aspect of meaning that is modeled by standard\npossible world semantics. The second aspect of meaning,\ncharacter, reflects semantic rules governing how the content\nof an expression may vary from one context of use to the next. A\nproper name like ‘Hillary Rodham Clinton’ (or indeed any\nnon-indexical expression) has a constant character, picking out the\nvery same object in every context in which it’s used, whereas\nindexical expressions like ‘I’ or ‘this’ have\nvariable character, picking out different things in different contexts\nof use. \nFormally, character is defined as a function that maps possible\ncontexts of use to contents, and content is defined as a function\nmapping possible worlds to extensions. Thus, a character is a function\nthat takes as input a context and yields as output a function from\npossible worlds to extensions. This is a two-dimensional\nintension, since there are two distinct roles that possibilities\nplay here: as a context of use, and as a circumstance of evaluation (a\npossible situation relative to which we evaluate whether the relevant\nobject exists or the relevant kind or property is instantiated). A\npossible context of use is just a possible situation in which someone\nuses the relevant expression. Contexts can be thought of as\n“centered” possible worlds: possible worlds with a\ndesignated agent and time within that world, which serve to locate a\nparticular situation in which the expression is used. We can then\nrepresent a context as an ordered triple \\(\\langle w, a,\nt\\rangle\\) of a possible world, an agent within that world, and a\ntime when the agent exists in that\n world.[4]\n With this formalism, it’s clear that the set of possible worlds must\nbe taken into account twice over in Kaplan’s account of character:\nonce in their role in determining possible contexts of use, and once\nin their normal role as possible circumstances of evaluation. \nThe conventional semantic rules governing the indexical\n‘I’ can be easily represented using this 2D semantic\nframework. The rules governing ‘I’ in English are modeled\nby a particular character: in any possible context of use\n\\(\\langle w, a, t\\rangle\\), an utterance of\n‘I’ rigidly designates the agent of that context,\na, picking out that very individual in all possible circumstances of\nevaluation. Kaplan analyzes the semantic rules governing the\ndemonstrative ‘that’ in a similar way: relative to any\npossible context of use \\(\\langle w, a, t\\rangle\\), an\nutterance of ‘that’ rigidly designates the object (if any)\nthat is made salient by a’s pointing gesture in that context [see the\nentry on\n indexicals\n for a more detailed discussion]. \nA useful way of visualizing the dual role played by possible worlds in\na 2D framework is to construct a two-dimensional matrix\n(Stalnaker 1978). To represent Kaplan’s theory of indexicals, we array\npossible circumstances of evaluation along the horizontal axis and\npossible contexts of utterance along the vertical axis. Each\nhorizontal row of the matrix represents the content the\ntarget expression would have if used in the context specified for that\nrow. This content is (partially) represented by recording the\nextension of the term at each possible circumstance arrayed along the\nhorizontal axis. This procedure is then repeated for each context\nlisted along the vertical axis. \nFor instance, consider a particular utterance of ‘I’ made\nby Barack Obama during his inaugural presidential address. This\ncontext of use can be represented as the world \\(w_1\\),\ncentered on the man BO, at time \\(t_0\\). We can\n(partially) represent the content of ‘I’ in this centered\nworld thus: \nThis simple one-dimensional matrix reflects the fact that, when used\nin this context, ‘I’ refers rigidly to Obama at every\npossible circumstance of evaluation—even at the counterfactual\nworlds \\(w_2\\) and \\(w_3\\), in which\nJohn McCain or Hillary Rodham Clinton won the 2008 presidential\nelection. The context-dependence of the expression ‘I’ is\nrevealed when we evaluate the use of ‘I’ with respect to\ndifferent possible contexts of use. Let’s consider two other contexts:\n\\(\\langle w_2, \\JM, t_0\\rangle\\) is a\nworld in which McCain won the election, centered on him at his\ninaugural address; and \\(\\langle w_3, \\HRC, t_0\\rangle\\) is a world in which Clinton won, centered\non her at her inaugural address. We then rely on our implicit\nunderstanding of the semantic rules governing ‘I’ to\ngenerate two more rows for our matrix: \nWhat the matrix reveals is that the expression ‘I’ rigidly\ndesignates different individuals, depending on the context in which it\nis used. Thus the 2D matrix provides a graphic illustration of how\ncontent of the expression ‘I’ varies, depending on the\ncontext in which it is used. \nSuch 2D matrices can be used to represent the differences between the\nsemantic rules governing indexicals, definite descriptions, and names.\nFor instance, the definite description ‘the inaugural speaker in\n2009’ will generate the following Kaplanian matrix: \nUnlike the matrix for ‘I’, the horizontal rows of this 2D\nmatrix are all exactly the same. This reflects the fact that the\nexpression ‘the inaugural speaker in 2009’ is not\ncontext-sensitive: it always represents the very same property\nirrespective of the context in which it is used—namely, the\nproperty of being the person who delivers the inaugural US\npresidential address in 2009. This property is exemplified by\ndifferent individuals at different possible worlds: the person who is\nthe inaugural speaker at \\(w_1\\) is Obama, at\n\\(w_2\\) it’s McCain, and at \\(w_3\\) it’s\nClinton. In general, the sequence arrayed along the rows of this\nmatrix reflects the variety of different individuals who could\ninstantiate the property represented by ‘the inaugural\nspeaker’ in different circumstances. Of course, no finite matrix\ncan fully capture the range of variation, but it can give a useful\npartial representation of the property in question. \nThe matrix for a proper name like ‘Barack Obama’ reveals\nanother very different pattern: \nAccording to Kaplan, proper names are context-invariant: they always\nhave the very same content irrespective of the context in which they\nare used. Proper names are also rigid designators: they pick out a\nsingle individual at every possible world. The upshot is that the 2D\nmatrix for a proper name will be completely uniform: the very same\nindividual appears in every cell of the matrix. This reflects the idea\nthat the semantic function of a name in a public language is simply to\npick out a particular individual, not to convey any information about\nhow to identify the individual in question. [Some proponents of\ngeneralized 2D semantics reject this account of the conventional\nmeaning of proper names. See §2.2 below.] \nKaplan’s semantic rules for indexicals guarantee that certain\nsentences will be true whenever they are uttered, and certain\ninferences will be truth preserving. This account paves the way for a\nformal logic of indexicals (Kaplan 1989). In this system, logical\nvalidity is defined in terms of different possible contexts of use: a\nsentence is valid iff it is true in every possible context of use; and\nan inference is valid iff the truth of the premises ensures the truth\nof the conclusion in every possible context of use. \nIn this formal system, sentences can be logically valid, even if they\nexpress contingent propositions. For instance, the semantic rules\ngoverning indexicals ensures that the sentence ‘I am here’\nwill be true whenever uttered: ‘I’ always picks out the\nagent who is making the utterance and ‘here’ always picks\nout the place where the agent is making the utterance. So no matter\nhow we vary the circumstances in which the utterance takes place, an\nutterance of ‘I am here’ is always guaranteed to be true.\nThe sentence will express different contents depending on who is using\nit, but normally the sentence will express a contingent proposition.\n(I could easily not have been here right now, but at the beach\ninstead.) \nTo get a clearer understanding of how this works, we can construct a\npartial 2D matrix for the sentence using our previous example. Let’s\nassume Obama would attend the inaugural address of McCain but not of\nClinton, McCain would avoid the inauguration of anyone who defeated\nhim, and Clinton would attend Obama’s inauguration but not McCain’s.\nThis yields the following 2D matrix: \nThe content of Obama’s utterance of ‘I am here’ in the\ncontext \\(\\langle w_1, \\BO, t_0\\rangle\\)\nis the proposition that Obama is in Washington DC on January\n20th 2009. Since this claim is true at worlds\n\\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\), the top row of the\nmatrix assigns T for those worlds, but it assigns F for\n\\(w_3\\) in which Obama is on childcare duty in Chicago\nduring Clinton’s inauguration. The content of McCain’s utterance in\nthe second context is that McCain is in DC at that time, so the\nintension assigns T to the world of that context,\n\\(w_2\\), and F to the worlds where he is in Arizona on\ninauguration day. And the content of Clinton’s utterance is that\nshe is in DC, so the world of that context \\(w_3\\) is\nassigned T, while the other worlds get divergent truth-values\ndepending on her location in those worlds. Thus the differences in the\nhorizontal rows of the 2D matrix reflect the different propositions\nexpressed by the sentence in these three contexts. The fact that the\nhorizontal rows of this matrix contain both ‘T’s and\n‘F’s reflects the fact that the intensions expressed in\nthe relevant contexts are metaphysically contingent: e.g., it’s\nneither necessarily true nor necessarily false that McCain is located\nin DC on inauguration day. \nThe 2D matrix also graphically represents the fact that the sentence\nis guaranteed to be true whenever uttered. For every possible context\n\\(\\langle w, a, t\\rangle\\), the semantic rules for\nindexicals guarantee that ‘I am here’ will be assigned T\nat the world of that context \\(w\\). Thus the diagonal of the\nmatrix running from the top left corner to the bottom right contains\nall ‘T’s. With a nod to Stalnaker (1978), we can call this the\ndiagonal intension associated with the sentence. In Kaplan’s\nsemantic framework, a necessary diagonal intension indicates that a\nsentence is logically valid and analytic: it’s\nguaranteed by semantic rules to be true in every possible context in\nwhich it is uttered, even though it may express distinct propositions\nin different\n contexts.[5] \nAt around the same time that Kaplan began developing his account of\nindexicals, logicians working on tense and modal logic had begun using\n2D semantic frameworks to explain the behavior of sentential operators\nlike ‘now’ and ‘actually’ (Åqvist 1973;\nKamp 1971; Segerberg 1973; Vlach 1973). Unlike Kaplan, these logicians\nwere not primarily concerned with the semantic rules governing natural\nlanguages. In particular, modal logicians were not focused on how the\ncontext in which an expression is used can affect its reference.\nRather, they were interested in developing formal systems for\nrepresenting valid inferences about time and possibility. It turns out\nthat tense and modal logic are formally very similar and that both\nrequire double-indexing for expressive adequacy. Thus, to fully\ncapture reasoning about what’s necessary and possible, we need to move\nfrom standard possible worlds semantics to a 2D semantic\nframework. \nThe need for a 2D modal framework is not obvious at first glance.\nAfter all, we can state semantic rules for the basic modal operators\nlike ‘it’s necessarily the case that’ or ‘it’s\npossibly the case that’ by simply quantifying over possible\nworlds: a sentence is necessary iff it’s true in all possible worlds,\nand a sentence is possible iff it’s true in some possible world. But\nthis (one-dimensional) framework cannot capture what is expressed by\noperators like ‘it’s actually the case that’. To\nunderstand how this operator works and to map out the valid inferences\nit licenses, we need a double-indexing framework in which possible\nworlds play two distinct roles (Crossley and Humberstone 1977; Hazen\n1976, 1978). \nTo see why this is so, consider the following sentence: \nStandard possible worlds semantics lacks the expressive power to\ncapture what is said by this sentence. The claim is not that there is\na possible world such that all the things that are red in that world\nare also shiny in that world (they’re supposed to be red in the\nactual world, not the counterfactual one). Nor is the claim\nthat for each object that is red, there is a possible world in which\nit is shiny (the objects are all supposed to be shiny\ntogether within a single possible world). So here is a\nrelation among objects in possible worlds that cannot be expressed in\nstandard possible world semantics. To capture the relation, we need to\nintroduce an extra element into the formal framework: we simply\ndesignate one world within the model to play the role of the actual\nworld. We can then introduce a sentential operator ‘\\(\\mathcal{A}\\)’\n(read as\n‘Actually’), which requires us to evaluate any claim\nwithin its scope at the designated world, even when the operator\nis embedded within the scope of other modal operators. Using this\nenriched possible worlds framework, we can represent the\ntruth-conditions of our sample sentence in a straightforward way: \nThis sentence is true just in case there is some possible world,\n\\(w\\), in which everything that is red in the designated world,\n\\(w_@\\), is shiny in \\(w\\). \nOne awkward consequence of this 2D semantic account of\n‘Actually’ is the way this operator interacts with the\nstandard modal operator ‘Necessarily’. Intuitively, what\nthe actual world is like seems logically and metaphysically\ncontingent. But according to the proposed semantics for\n‘Actually’, any true sentence \\(S\\) will yield a\nnecessary truth when embedded within the scope of\nthe operator ‘\\(\\mathcal{A}\\)’. For\ninstance, consider the following sentence: \nIf Obama won in the designated world of our model, then it’s true at\nevery possible world in that model that Obama won at its designated\nworld. So on the proposed 2D semantics, the sentence is\nnecessarily true. (When we embed (2) within the necessity\noperator ‘\\(\\Box\\)’ we get a truth; and any claim of the\nform \\(\\mathcal{A}S \\rightarrow \\Box \\mathcal{A}S\\)\nwill be logically valid.) But\nintuitively it’s a contingent matter how the 2008 elections\nturned out: surely the fact that Obama actually won does not show that\nhe was destined by logical necessity to actually win! \nTo mitigate this counterintuitive consequence, Crossley and\nHumberstone introduce a new logical operator, ‘Fixedly’\n(‘\\(\\mathcal{F}\\)’) in such a way\nthat the complex operator ‘Fixedly Actually’ (‘\\(\\mathcal{F}\\mathcal{A}\\)’),\ncaptures the sense of\nnecessity we have in mind when we deny that (2) is necessary. A\nsentence is fixedly actually true just in case it is true no\nmatter which world is designated as\n actual.[6] \nOnce again, 2D matrices can be used to graphically depict how the\nsemantic theory works. Let’s take our universe of possible worlds to\ncontain just three worlds: \\(w_1\\) is a world where\nObama won, \\(w_2\\) a world where McCain won, and\n\\(w_3\\) a world where Clinton won. To explain the\n‘Fixedly Actually’ operator, we need to consider possible\nworlds playing two different roles: the standard role as a\ncircumstance of evaluation and the special role of being designated as\nthe actual world. To construct a 2D matrix, we array possible worlds\nplaying the standard role along the horizontal axis, and along the\nvertical axis we array the same worlds playing the role of being\ndesignated as actual. Each horizontal row of this matrix represents a\ndifferent model with a particular world designated as\n actual.[7]\n On this account, the truth of a sentence embedded within the\n‘Actually’ operator depends entirely on what’s true in the\nworld designated as actual in a given model. So we can fill in the 2D\nmatrix as follows: \nIn any world in a model, ‘Actually \\(S\\)’ is always\nevaluated by looking at the designated world of that model. So such\nsentences are either necessarily true (True at every world in the\nmodel) or necessarily false (False at every world in the model). This\nis the sense of necessity that corresponds to the standard modal\noperator ‘\\(\\Box\\)’. On this understanding of necessity,\nthe target sentence is necessarily true (since \\(w_1\\)\nrepresents the actual actual world). But intuitively there is\na sense in which the sentence seems contingent, since a different\nworld could have been actual: if \\(w_2\\) or\n\\(w_3\\) had been actual, the sentence ‘Obama\nactually won’ would have been false. This fact is reflected in\nthe 2D matrix by the diagonal intension, where the sentence comes out\ntrue with respect to \\(\\langle w_1,\nw_1\\rangle\\), but false with respect to\n\\(\\langle w_2, w_2\\rangle\\) and\n\\(\\langle w_3, w_3\\rangle\\). The\n‘Fixedly Actually’ operator is sensitive to the necessity\nor contingency of the diagonal intension. The sense in which the\ntarget sentence (2) is not necessary is that it’s not fixedly actually\ntrue. \nA highly influential paper by Martin Davies and Lloyd Humberstone\n(1980) brought the formal tools developed in 2D modal logic to bear on\nphilosophical puzzles about modality. Following Gareth Evans (1979),\nDavies and Humberstone suggest that there are two notions of\nmetaphysical necessity involved in ordinary modal thinking: deep and\nsuperficial necessity. They argue that the two logical operators,\n‘\\(\\mathcal{F}\\mathcal{A}\\)’\nand ‘\\(\\Box\\)’\nrespectively, provide a clear formal elucidation of these two\nnotions. \nThese two notions of necessity, they argue, help explain some of Saul\nKripke’s (1980) puzzling examples in which necessity and apriority\ncome apart. Using 2D modal logic, it’s easy to construct necessary\naposteriori truths. The semantic rules governing the modal operator\n‘\\(\\mathcal{A}\\)’ guarantee that\nevery claim of the form \\(\\mathcal{A}S\\) will\nbe either necessarily true or necessarily false in the sense of\n‘\\(\\Box\\)’. But when the embedded sentence \\(S\\) is an\nordinary empirical truth like ‘Obama won’, \\(\\mathcal{A}S\\)\nwill be knowable only aposteriori:\nso \\(\\mathcal{A}S\\) will be a necessary\naposteriori truth. The ‘Actually’ operator can also be\nused to construct contingent apriori truths. Any claim of the form\n\\((\\mathcal{A}S \\rightarrow S)\\) is\nguaranteed by the semantic rules governing ‘Actually’ to\nbe true at the designated world no matter which world is designated as\nactual (i.e., it’s fixedly actually true). But when \\(S\\) is an\nordinary empirical truth, the complex claim is not necessary in the\nsense of ‘\\(\\Box\\)’: there will be some worlds in the model\nwhere \\(S\\) is false while \\(\\mathcal{A}S\\)\nis true. In such cases, the\ncomplex sentence will be a contingent apriori truth. \nDavies and Humberstone also suggest that the 2D modal operator\n‘Actually’ might help analyze certain referring\nexpressions in natural language. In particular, they focus on Evans’\n(1982) notion of a ‘descriptive name’ (a name whose\nreference is fixed by a description) and on natural kind terms.\nSuppose the following definitions capture the semantic rules governing\nthe relevant expressions in natural language: \nIf such analyses are correct, then the semantics for\n‘actually’ will allow us to explain why ‘Julius\ninvented the zip’ is contingent and apriori and ‘water =\nH2O’ is necessary\n aposteriori.[8]\n [See the entries on\n names\n and\n descriptions.\n For a survey of other philosophical applications of the 2D framework\nin modal logic see (Humberstone 2004).]  \nDavies and Humberstone themselves express reservations about the\nadequacy of analyses using ‘actually’ for natural language\nexpressions, particularly in the case of proper names (1980,\n17–21). As a consequence, they did not take 2D modal logic to\nprovide a complete response to Kripke’s puzzles about necessary\naposteriori and contingent apriori truths. However, the use of the 2D\nframework to explain these puzzles was subsequently taken up and\nrefined by proponents of generalized 2D semantics.  \nRecently, Brian Rabern has argued that the semantic considerations\nthat support double-indexing for modal operators also support the need\nfor multiple modal operators (Rabern 2012b). If this is right, then\nthe role of multiple-indexing in compositional semantics should be\nsharply distinguished from dual roles for possible worlds that Kaplan\nhighlights:  \nRabern’s suggestion is that the notion of semantic value needed\nfor compositional semantics should be distinguished from the notion of\nassertoric content of utterances (or of thoughts). For similar views,\nsee (Ninan 2010; Yalcin 2015). This sharp distinction between formal\nsemantics and intensional content would undercut some of the\nmotivation for treating the generalized two-dimensional semantic\nprogram advocated by theorists like David Chalmers and Frank Jackson\nas contributing to a compositional semantic theory.  \nIn the previous sections, we considered applications of the 2D\nframework that seek to explain the meaning of specific types of\nexpression: indexicals and modal operators. In contrast, proponents of\ngeneralized 2D semantics believe that the 2D framework can be used to\nexplain an important aspect of the meaning of all\nexpressions. In particular, generalized 2D semantics is meant to\nvindicate the traditional idea that we have apriori access to our own\nmeanings through armchair reflection. \nAccording to the philosophical tradition, to know the meaning of a\nsubsentential expression like ‘bachelor’ is to implicitly\ngrasp a criterion that determines exactly which individuals count as\nbachelors in any possible situation. (Accounts of meaning broadly\nalong these lines were advanced by Plato, Descartes, Locke, Hume,\nFrege, Russell, Carnap, and many others.) On the traditional account,\nspeakers’ implicit grasp of a criterion plays two key theoretical\nroles: \nThe first claim requires that speakers who share the same meaning must\nshare a criterion for identifying the reference; while the second\nrequires that this criterion be veridical. If this traditional account\nof meaning is correct, then one can make one’s own meanings explicit\nby engaging in apriori conceptual analysis. Such conceptual\nanalysis allows you to determine what exactly it takes to count as a\nbachelor in any possible world; and it allows you to specify what\nexactly someone must be prepared to accept in order to genuinely agree\nor disagree about bachelors. \nGeneralized two-dimensional semantics is a strategy for defending a\nvariant of this traditional view of meaning against a series of highly\ninfluential objections. In the 1970s and 80s, semantic externalists\nused a variety of persuasive examples to argue that the traditional\naccount of meaning yields an unrealistic picture of (i) semantic\ncompetence, (ii) reference determination, and (iii) epistemic access\nto modal facts. Proper names and natural kind terms seem especially\nproblematic for the traditional\n account.[9]\n By commonsense standards, you don’t need to know a specific rule for\nidentifying Gödel in any possible world in order to count as\ncompetent with the name ‘Gödel’; and no such\nknowledge seems required for your use of the name to pick out the\nrelevant man in every possible world (Donnellan 1970; Kripke\n 1980).[10]\n Similarly, you don’t need to know precisely what it takes for\nsomething to count as water in any possible world to be competent with\nthe word ‘water’ or for your word to pick out the chemical\nsubstance H2O in every possible world (Kripke 1980; Putnam\n1970, 1972). Indeed, making room for the possibility of ignorance and\nerror about reference-conditions seems crucial to explaining empirical\ninquiry into the nature of familiar things, and to vindicating the\ncommonsense realist idea that we can refer to things whose nature we\ndon’t fully understand (Burge 1979, 1986; Putnam 1972, 1973). If these\ncritics are right, then the traditional account of meaning is\nuntenable. Implicit knowledge of reference-conditions is not\nrequired either for linguistic competence or for determinate\nreference. And apriori conceptual analysis cannot be trusted to reveal\nwhat’s genuinely possible—at best, it reveals one’s current\nfallible assumptions about the topic in question. [See the entry on\n externalism about mental content.] \nProponents of generalized 2D semantics believe this pessimistic\nconclusion is unwarranted. What critics’ examples really show, they\nargue, is that the traditional view of meaning should be refined, not\njunked. Moreover, the 2D semantics developed for indexicals and modal\noperators suggests a promising strategy for accommodating putative\nexternalist counterexamples within a broadly traditional account of\nmeaning. In the case of indexicals and rigidified definite\ndescriptions, competent speakers grasp a reference-fixing\ncriterion without grasping the modal profile of the\nobject, kind, or property picked out by the expression. For instance,\nyou can know that ‘I’ always refers to the speaker\nwhenever it is uttered without knowing the nature of the person who is\nactually picked (e.g., what it takes to be Barack Obama in any\npossible world). Perhaps our understanding of names and natural kind\nterms is structured in a similar way: competent speakers always have\napriori access to the reference-fixing criterion currently associated\nwith their use of the name ‘Barack Obama’, but they have\nonly aposteriori access to the associated modal profile. If this\nsuggestion is on the right track, then a generalized 2D semantic\nframework could be used to clarify the nature of this semantic\nunderstanding. Moreover we may be able to explain certain epistemic\noperators, like ‘it is conceptually possible that’ or\n‘it is apriori that’, as operating on such 2D semantic\nvalues. \nThe basic philosophical idea behind generalized 2D\nsemantics—that subjects have apriori access to reference-fixing\ncriteria for their words but not to the modal profile of the subject\nmatter picked out—has been suggested by a number of theorists.\nDavid Lewis, in particular, was a powerful champion of the idea that\nwe can give apriori definitions for terms whose precise reference we\ndo not understand. Lewis articulated the ‘analytic\nfunctionalist’ approach to specifying the meaning of mental\npredicates and of theoretical terms in science (1966; 1970; 1972;\n1979; 1980; 1994); and he was also an early advocate of a generalized\n2D approach to semantics (1981; 1994). Other influential proponents of\nthe idea that we can have implicit knowledge of reference-fixing\ncriteria without knowing the modal profile of the reference include\nMichael Dummett (1973; 1981), Gareth Evans (1982), and John Searle\n(1983). Early proponents of an explicitly two-dimensional semantics\nfor names and natural kind terms include Harry Deutsch, Ulrike\nHaas-Spohn, and Kai-Yee Wong (Deutsch 1990, 1993; Haas-Spohn 1995;\nWong 1996). However, it is two later theorists—Frank Jackson\n(1994; 1998a; 1998b; 2004) and David Chalmers (1996; 2002b; 2002c;\n2004; 2006a)—who have most systematically developed and defended\ngeneralized 2D semantics as a way of reconciling the lessons of\nsemantic externalism with the traditional apriori approach to meaning\nand modality. \nIt’s worth noting that generalized 2D semantics has been\nmotivated primarily by epistemic, metasemantic, and metaphysical\nconcerns, rather than by issues in compositional semantics. In\nparticular, generalized 2D semantics seeks to vindicate the\ntraditional idea that we can know the truth conditions of our own\nsentences via armchair reasoning about hypothetical cases. The\napproach promises to explain why certain necessary truths can only be\nknown aposteriori by appealing to the structure of our implicit\nsemantic understanding. Proponents of generalized 2D semantics make\nclaims about how the two types of intension may interact with modal\nand epistemic operators. However, working out the details of the\ncompositional semantics has been a relatively recent concern of\nproponents of generalized 2D semantics (e.g. Chalmers 2011a, c;\nChalmers and Rabern 2014; Johannesson and Packalén 2016; Kipper\nforthcoming).  \nThe 2D semantic frameworks proposed by Jackson and Chalmers are very\nsimilar in their broad aims and formal structure, and commentators\noften treat the two versions as interchangeable. However, the two\nframeworks are developed in the service of two quite different\nphilosophical projects, emphasizing different aspects of the\ntraditional approach to meaning. Jackson takes up the traditional\nempiricist project of explaining empirical facts about language use\nand communication, while Chalmers pursues a broadly rationalist\nproject of explaining key structural interconnections between meaning,\napriority, and possibility. This difference in explanatory aims leads\nto different interpretations of the 2D framework. \nAn empiricist account of meaning is essentially a high-level causal\nexplanation of uncontroversial facts about language use. In\nparticular, the empiricist seeks to characterize the psychological\nstates that guide individuals’ application of an expression to\nparticular cases, and to explain how linguistic coordination within a\nlinguistic community is achieved. \nClearly individual speakers must have some implicit assumptions about\nthe reference of a word that guide their verdicts about whether it\napplies to particular cases (Jackson 1998a, 29–42). When someone\nasks you whether a particular Gettier case counts as knowledge, for\ninstance, you do not simply answer at random: your answer is guided by\nyour prior understanding of the term ‘knowledge’, and your\nanswer is only justified insofar as it makes sense of that prior\nunderstanding. An empiricist seeks to explain these facts by positing\na stable internal psychological state—something like an\ninternal reference-fixing template—that guides your\nverdicts no matter what the actual world turns out to be like. \nIt’s equally clear that members of the same linguistic community\ngenerally manage to use words to reliably coordinate their beliefs and\nactions (Jackson 1998b, 2004). When I ask you to pass the salt, you\nknow roughly which white granular substance I’m asking for—you\nknow, for instance, that it would be inappropriate to pass the sugar\nbowl or the pepper grinder. This sort of everyday coordination\nrequires speakers to have similar dispositions to classify things as\nfalling into the extension of words, and it requires that these\nsimilarities in classificatory dispositions be mutually obvious to all\nconcerned: for it to make sense for me to say ‘please pass the\nsalt’ in order to get salt, it must be common knowledge between\nus that we’re inclined to classify roughly the same things as\n‘salt’. An empiricist explains this common knowledge by\npositing implicit conventions that require everyone to\nassociate the very same reference-fixing template with a given word\n(Jackson 1998b; Lewis 1969). \nAn empiricist use of the 2D framework is intended to show that this\ncore explanatory project is not undermined by the intuitions about\nnames and natural kind terms highlighted by semantic externalists\n(Jackson 1998a; 1998b). According to the empiricist picture of\nmeaning, implicit linguistic conventions ensure that speakers within a\nlinguistic community associate roughly the same reference-fixing\ncriteria with particular words. Empiricist proponents of 2D semantics\nhold that the 2D framework can help elucidate the content of the\nshared reference-fixing criteria for names and natural kind\n terms.[11] \nExternalists argue that ordinary speakers are often ignorant or\nmistaken about the precise nature (modal profile) of the objects,\nkinds or properties their words pick out. But linguistic conventions\ndon’t always fix the reference by specifying the nature of the\nreference. Indexicals are a clear case in point: you can understand my\nuse of the term ‘here’ in an email, without realizing that\nit refers to Melbourne in all possible worlds. This ignorance is\npossible because the semantic rule for ‘here’ fixes the\nreference via a contingent property of the place picked out (i.e., a\ngiven utterance happened to occur there). Perhaps the conventions\ngoverning names and natural kind terms are structured in a similar\nway, specifying the reference via its contingent properties. For\ninstance, we might have an implicit semantic rule requiring us to take\n‘water’ to pick out whatever chemical kind\nactually explains a certain suite of superficial observable\nproperties: e.g., being a clear, potable, odorless liquid that fills\nlakes and streams around here (Jackson 1998a, 1998b). On this\nanalysis, ‘water’ just is an implicitly indexical\nexpression, picking out different chemical kinds depending on which\nworld constitutes the actual context of use. If this rule is what one\nmust accept to count as competent with the meaning of the expression\ntype ‘water’, then it is no surprise that competent\nspeakers often fail to realize that water = H2O: for they\nmay not know that H2O is what actually fulfills the\nreference-fixing role in question. Externalist examples of ignorance\nand error, therefore, do not directly threaten the empiricist account\nof meaning. \nOf course, it is an empirical question whether names and natural kind\nterms are in fact governed by indirect reference-fixing rules of this\nsort. But according to the 2D empiricist, you can test whether your\nimplicit understanding of ‘water’ is structured in the\nrelevant way by considering possible situations in two different\nroles: as your actual environment or as a mere\ncounterfactual circumstance of evaluation (Jackson 1998a, ch. 2).\nConsider two different possible worlds based on Putnam’s Twin Earth\nthought experiment (Putnam 1972). In the first world, Earth, the clear\npotable stuff that fills lakes and streams and is habitually called\n‘water’ by English speakers is H2O. The second\nworld, Twin Earth, is exactly the same except that the stuff that has\nthese properties is the complex chemical kind, XYZ. If your\ncommonsense understanding of ‘water’ is governed by the\nproposed reference-fixing convention, it would lead you to identify\ndifferent chemical substances as water depending on what your actual\nenvironment is like: if your actual environment is like Earth, then\nwater is HO; but if your actual environment is like Twin\nearth, then water is XYZ. If you assume that water is\nactually H2O, however, you will judge that water\nis essentially H2O in all counterfactual\ncircumstances. And if you assume water is actually XYZ, then\nyou’ll judge water is essentially XYZ. \nThis pattern of dispositions to apply the term ‘water’ can\nbe depicted on a 2D matrix as follows: \nAlong the vertical axis are ranged centered possible worlds (a\npossible world, with a designated agent \\(a\\) and time \\(t\\)\nwithin that world) representing different ways your actual environment\ncould be like; and the same worlds are ranged along the horizontal\naxis representing different counterfactual circumstances of\nevaluation. This matrix reflects your commonsense dispositions to\napply the term ‘water’ to different chemical kinds on the\nbasis of whether it actually plays certain superficial roles described\nin other commonsense terms (‘clear’,\n‘potable’, ‘liquid’,\n etc).[12] \nSemantic externalists take these sorts of judgments about Twin Earth\nto militate against a traditional account of meaning—for they\nsuggest that your understanding does not fully determine the nature of\nthe reference. But according to 2D empiricists like Jackson, the only\nconclusion that is warranted is that the meaning of your term is more\ncomplex than the tradition suggests: your verdicts about possible\nworlds considered as actual reflect your naïve\nreference-fixing criterion, and your verdicts about possible\nworlds considered as counterfactual reflect the theoretical\ncriterion you would accept after you learned all the relevant\nempirical facts about your actual environment. These two types of\ncriterion can be modeled in possible world semantics as intensions: an\nA-intension (for ‘Actual’) is a function from worlds\nconsidered as actual to extensions, while a C-intension (for\n‘Counterfactual’) is a function from worlds considered as\ncounterfactual to extensions (Jackson 1998a, ch.2). The diagonal of\nour matrix corresponds to the A-intension you associate with\n‘water’; and the first horizontal row corresponds to the\nC-intension of your term ‘water’ (assuming that\n\\(\\langle\\)Earth, \\(a, t\\rangle\\) represents your real-world\nenvironment). \nWhile semantic externalists acknowledge only the C-intension as\nmodeling an expression’s semantic content, 2D empiricists will insist\nthat both A- and C-intensions reflect important aspects of a competent\nEnglish speaker’s understanding of a word like ‘water’. In\nparticular, they take A-intensions to reflect what is understood and\ncommunicated by minimally competent English speakers and what guides\ntheir everyday classifications. The suggestion, then, is that\nA-intensions capture the shared, conventionally entrenched\nunderstanding of reference-fixing conditions posited by the empiricist\napproach to meaning. \nBy itself, this 2D framework offers no guarantee that the hypothetical\njudgments recorded by an A-intension are produced by a stable\nreference-fixing criterion. Nor does it guarantee that the very same\nA-intension will be generated for all competent speakers in your\nlinguistic community. However, according to the 2D empiricist, we have\nsolid empirical reasons to think these conditions are satisfied in the\ncase of names and natural kind terms. First, the widespread acceptance\nof the externalist thought experiments demonstrates that we do in fact\nshare similar reference-fixing criteria for terms like\n‘water’ and ‘Gödel’ (Jackson 1998a,\n38–39). Second, the empiricist model of meaning provides the\nbest psychological explanation of how such linguistic coordination is\nachieved (Jackson\n 1998b).[13] \nIn addition to clarifying the structure of our semantic understanding,\nthe 2D framework can help justify specific conceptual analyses. The\ncriteria that implicitly guide our everyday use of a term are often\nembodied in recognitional or inferential dispositions rather than in\nconsciously accessible rules. Indeed, Jackson likens grasp of\nreference-fixing criteria for particular expressions to our ability to\nrecognize the grammaticality of sentences in one’s own language\n(2000). Just as linguists can construct a grammar for your language on\nthe basis of your judgments about the acceptability of particular\nsentences, you can construct an analysis of the meaning you associate\nwith an expression on the basis of your application of a term to\nhypothetical cases. The correct analysis must capture the full range\nof your confident judgments involving the target expression, while\nabstracting away from performance errors and other interfering factors\n(Jackson 1998a, 31–37). \nThis psychological model helps explain how you can come to know the\ncorrect analysis of your term ‘water’ by noting which\nproperties you treat as “obvious and central” when filling\nin a 2D matrix like the one above (Jackson 1998a, 31). The 2D\nframework is particularly helpful for analyzing the meaning of proper\nnames or natural kind terms, because it prompts you to consider\npossible cases in two different ways;–as actual or as\ncounterfactual. Your verdicts about whether the stuff on Twin Earth\ncounts as water, for instance, depends on whether you think of Twin\nEarth as a hypothesis about your actual environment or as a purely\ncounterfactual possibility. When the A- and C-intensions for your term\ndiverge as they do in the case of ‘water’, 2D empiricists\nsuggest that the correct analysis will take the form of rigidified\ndefinite descriptions using the indexical term ‘actual’:\nwater \\(=_{df}\\) the actual stuff that has such-and-such\nsuperficial properties. Moreover, careful attention to your reactions\nto the hypothetical scenarios will allow you to make explicit which\nsuperficial properties implicitly guide your application of the term.\nFor instance, you may discover that your implicit criterion for\napplying ‘water’ is that water \\(=_{df}\\) the actual\nchemical kind in your environment that is a clear, potable, odorless\nliquid that falls as rain and fills lakes and streams. Alternatively,\nyour use of the term ‘water’ may be guided by the types of\ncausal relations invoked in causal theories of reference: water\n\\(=_{df}\\) the actual natural kind that has been the dominant\ncause of your community’s past use of the term ‘water’.\nIndeed, Jackson suggests that standard causal theories of reference\nare based on this method of conceptual analysis (1998a, 37–41).\n[See the entry on\n causal theories of mental content.] \nThe conceptual analyses produced by this method count as apriori,\naccording to the 2D empiricist, because you can know them to be\ncorrect “independently of knowing what the actual world is\nlike” (Jackson 1998a, 51). The evidence that supports such\nanalyses consists in purely hypothetical judgments: judgments about\nhow to classify cases on the supposition that your\nenvironment is like \\(X\\), or like \\(Y\\). Since such\nhypothetical judgments don’t require you to determine what your\nreal environment is like, your justification for accepting an\nanalysis is not based on empirical knowledge. And to change your\njudgment about a purely hypothetical case would be to change the\nmeaning of your term (Jackson 1998a, 44–46). \nAccording to empiricist 2D semantics, the truth of any metaphysical\nreduction depends on the reference-fixing conditions conventionally\nassociated with the terms involved—and these reference-fixing\nconditions are always knowable apriori. So apriori conceptual analysis\nplays a crucial role in vindicating metaphysical reductions (Jackson\n1994; 1998a). \nMetaphysical reductions provide a constitutive account of some target\ndomain (e.g., beliefs, free will, water, moral rightness) in terms of\nmore basic features of the world (e.g., the properties postulated by\nan idealized physics, ideas in the mind of God, the mosaic of sense\ndata). A physicalist about mental states, for instance, is committed\nto there being specific facts about the microphysical structure of the\nworld that suffice for the existence of beliefs, desires and sensory\nexperiences. The physicalist is thus committed to metaphysically\nnecessary “entailments” connecting claims about the two\ndomains: it’s metaphysically necessary that if such-and-such physical\nfacts obtain, then such-and-such mental facts obtain. This\nmetaphysical entailment relation can arguably be cashed out in terms\nof global supervenience (Jackson 1998a, 6–14). [See the entry on\n supervenience.] \nOn the empiricist view of meaning, the relevance of conceptual\nanalysis to metaphysics is then straightforward: conceptual analysis\nestablishes that a putative reduction respects the original meaning of\nthe target expression (Jackson 1998a, 28). Obviously, the physicalist\nwon’t succeed in accounting for free will if she identifies free will\nwith having a temperature of 37.4º Celsius. Such a\n“reduction” would simply change the subject under\ndiscussion. A successful reduction must be answerable to our original\nshared understanding of the target expression—and elucidating\nthis original understanding just is what conceptual analysis does. So\nif conceptual analyses are knowable apriori, it follows that\nmetaphysical reductions must always be backed by apriori entailments\nbetween the base-level claim (such as a physical description of the\nworld) and the target claim (such as the claim that humans have free\nwill). \nConceptual analysis plays a modest role on the empiricist account.\nApriori conceptual analysis merely tells you about the relations among\nyour ideas; it cannot tell you whether there are any objects,\nkinds, or properties that satisfy your current reference-fixing\nassumptions (Jackson 1998a, 42–4). Moreover, the meaning you currently\nassociate with a term may be pragmatically deficient: e.g., it may not\nbe determinate enough to settle certain hard cases or it may not allow\nyou to draw useful distinctions in your actual environment. In such\ncases, you would have good pragmatic reasons to change the meaning of\nyour term (Jackson 1998a, 44–6, 53–4). What the empiricist\ndenies is that changing your current criteria for applying a term can\never get you closer to the truth about what you meant all along. \nCriticisms of the empiricist use of 2D semantics to explain linguistic\ncoordination can be divided into two broad categories: (i) criticisms\nthat target the account of linguistic conventions, and (ii) criticisms\nthat target the account of individuals’ linguistic understanding. \nThe empiricist account of linguistic conventions has elicited the most\ncriticism. On this account, A-intensions capture the content of tacit\nlinguistic conventions of the sort outlined by Lewis (1969). If this\nis right, then the reference-fixing conditions for words like\n‘knowledge’, ‘water’, or ‘Barack\nObama’ must meet two strong empirical constraints: \nBoth assumptions have been challenged. On the first point: Most\nphilosophers acknowledge that competent English speakers can have\nentirely different criteria for identifying the reference of a proper\nname like ‘Barack Obama’ and many acknowledge significant\nvariability in competent speakers’ initial understanding of natural\nkind terms like ‘water’: we don’t need to share precisely\nthe same “folk theory” of Obama or of water in order to be\nlinguistically competent with those terms (e.g., Burge 1979; Kripke\n1980; Quine 1951a). To back up this intuitive point, experimental\nphilosophers have marshaled survey data to argue that English speakers\nfrom different ethnic or socio-economic backgrounds classify\nhypothetical cases, such as Gettier cases or Twin Earth cases,\ndifferently (Machery et al. 2004; Nichols et al. 2004; Stich and\nWeinberg 2001; Weinberg et al. 2001). In response to such worries,\nJackson acknowledges that different speakers’ criteria for applying a\nterm may not be perfectly matched, but he argues that there must be\nsignificant overall similarity in reference-fixing criteria for\neveryday practical coordination. Empiricist 2D semantics is meant to\nexplain this imperfect similarity (1998b, 214–5). See also Lewis\n(1997), who posits higher-order similarities among speakers’\nreference-fixing commitments. On the second point: Critics (Kroon\n2004a; Schroeter 2003) challenge 2D empiricist’s assumption of common\nknowledge of reference-fixing conditions, arguing that speakers are\nnot in a position to know the range of variation and similarity in\nspeakers’ understanding of a term within their linguistic community.\nIf this is right, then tacit linguistic conventions cannot get off the\nground: if speakers don’t know what the standard linguistic practices\nare, they cannot be expected to conform to those standards. In\nresponse, an empiricist may claim that communal standards will\ninevitably involve some indeterminacy. \nCriticizing the details of this 2D account of linguistic conventions\nwon’t carry much weight if the only way to explain the phenomena is to\nposit some similarity (however partial or indeterminate) among\nspeakers’ reference-fixing criteria. Several critics, however, argue\nthat the best explanation of how speakers manage to knowingly\ncoordinate on the same reference does not require individual speakers\nto share similar criteria for applying the term. Instead, the best\nexplanation is that speakers are causally and historically embedded\nwithin the same community and they are generally disposed to hold\ntheir own use of a term accountable to that of the community as a\nwhole. \nOn this account, knowing co-reference does not require speakers to\nshare any particular substantive criterion for identifying the\nreference. What explains interpersonal coordination is speakers’\nmutual commitment to a communal referential practice, not some\nindependently specifiable similarity in their associated criteria. See\n(Kroon 2004b; Schroeter and Bigelow 2009; Schroeter and Schroeter\n2009) for similar responses to Jackson, and (Burge 1979; 1989) for an\ninfluential defense of a social model of competence. \nThe second distinctive aspect of the empiricist account of meaning is\nthe idea that individual speakers have implicit knowledge of\nreference-fixing conditions. This model of linguistic understanding\ncan be challenged in two different ways. First, there is the\npsychological claim that competent speakers have something like an\ninternal reference-fixing template—a stable set of criteria for\nidentifying the reference that guides the application of the term both\nin everyday use and in hypothetical reasoning. Some critics argue that\nindividuals’ judgments about cases are more plausibly explained\nwithout positing any such stable template (Schroeter 2006; Schroeter\nand Bigelow 2009). Second, there is the semantic claim that a\nspeaker’s everyday criteria determine the real reference of her words.\nThe semantic claim is challenged by theorists working in a broadly\nQuinean tradition. Such critics argue that the reference of someone’s\nword is determined not by the speaker’s settled dispositions\nto apply a word to cases, but by how these criteria should be refined\nin light of empirical facts about the speaker’s environment so as to\nmeet broader theoretical and practical interests associated with the\nspeaker’s use of the word (Block and Stalnaker 1999; Schroeter 2003;\nWilliamson 2007; Yablo 2000a, 2000b). While 2D empiricists can\nacknowledge that refinements of the subject’s current conception are\nimportant, they will insist that refinements that depart from\nnaïve understanding (such as a compatibilist conception of free\nwill) constitute a change of meaning. The 2D empiricist thus advocates\nthe sort of position articulated by Carnap (1950), while critics\nchampion views closer to those of Quine (1951a, 1951b) or Putnam\n(1974). \nFor an empiricist, an expression’s meaning reflects the causal\nmechanisms guiding everyday classification and communication. For a\nrationalist, in contrast, an expression’s meaning reflects what is\napriori accessible to the speaker on the basis of ideal reflection.\nThe empiricist is primarily concerned with causal explanation, while\nthe rationalist is primarily concerned with idealized apriori\nrationality. This difference in emphasis on the part of the\nrationalist can have significant ramifications for a generalized 2D\nsemantics. \nDavid Chalmers has developed a detailed and influential rationalist\ninterpretation of the 2D framework. This semantic project is situated\nwithin a broadly rationalist tradition that posits a “golden\ntriangle” of necessary constitutive relations between meaning,\napriority, and possibility (2004; 2006a). \nFollowing Frege (1892), the 2D rationalist is interested in capturing\na notion of meaning that is finer-grained than reference. Frege\npointed out that sentences containing co-referential expressions like\n‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ can differ in\ncognitive significance: someone who is competent with these\ntwo names may not realize they are co-referential and may therefore\nuse them differently in making and justifying claims. Frege took\nsameness of cognitive significance to be the mark of sameness of\nmeaning. According to a 2D rationalist, sameness of cognitive\nsignificance can in most cases be elucidated in terms of apriori\nequivalence: two expressions are associated with the same meaning\niff one can know that they pick out the very same things on the basis\nof apriori reflection alone (Chalmers\n 2002b).[14]\n This constitutive link between meaning and apriority constitutes the\nfirst side of the “golden triangle”. \nThe second side of the “golden triangle” connects meaning\nwith possibility. Following Carnap (1947), the 2D rationalist suggests\nthat we can use possible worlds semantics to individuate particular\nmeanings in terms of their representational properties. In standard\npossible world semantics, the meaning of ‘doctor’ is\nidentified with an intension that maps possible worlds to\nextensions. An expression’s intension reflects the modal profile of\nthe object, kind, or property picked out. Identifying meanings with\nintensions therefore establishes an important constitutive connection\nbetween meanings and modal claims. If ‘doctor’ and\n‘physician’ are associated with the same meaning, then\nit’s true in all possible worlds that all doctors are\nphysicians and all physicians are doctors. And conversely if two\nexpressions are co-extensive in all possible worlds, then\nthey have the same meaning. \nThe third side of the “golden triangle” connects\npossibility with apriority. Following Kant (1787), a rationalist about\nmodality holds that what is necessary is always knowable apriori and\nwhat is knowable apriori is always necessary. Thus ideal apriori\nreflection can be trusted to reveal the space of possibility. \nThis “golden triangle” of constitutive relations generates\na distinctive rationalist account of meaning. To be competent with an\nexpression’s meaning is to be in an internal cognitive state that puts\none in a position to identify its extension in any possible world on\nthe basis of apriori reflection alone. Apriori reflection will also\nsuffice to determine whether two expressions are associated with the\nsame or different meanings. This rationalist approach to meaning\ncontrasts with the empiricist one: whereas the empiricist uses\ncausally efficacious cognitive mechanisms to isolate the\nreference-fixing criteria currently associated with an expression, the\nrationalist uses the subject’s ideally rational judgments to\nisolate the complex cognitive states that would ground those\nreflective judgments. As a consequence, the aspect of understanding\nthat corresponds to a rationalist meaning may turn out to be more\nheterogeneous and less stable than the shared, causally efficacious\n‘templates’ postulated by the empiricist. The\n“golden triangle” also involves a distinctive rationalist\naccount of modal epistemology, according to which ideal apriori\nconceivability is a fail-safe guide to metaphysical possibility. This\nmodal rationalism affords a simple and attractive account of our\naccess to modal facts (Chalmers 1996, 136–8; 1999, 488–91;\n 2002a).[15] \nThis simple rationalist picture of meaning and modality, however, was\nundermined by externalist thought experiments. Kripke’s (1980)\nobservation that certain necessary truths, like ‘Hesperus =\nPhosphorus’, are only knowable aposteriori threatens both the\nidea that linguistic competence affords apriori access to the truth-\nand applicability-conditions of one’s words and the idea that\nnecessary truths are always apriori knowable. The guiding idea behind\n2D rationalism is that a rationalist can accommodate Kripke’s examples\nby moving to a 2D semantic framework. In particular, the 2D framework\ncan be used to isolate an aspect of meaning that satisfies the\n“golden triangle” of constitutive relations among meaning,\napriority and modality. \nRoughly, the idea is that ‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’ is\naposteriori because we associate distinct reference-fixing criteria\nwith the two names: e.g., being the brightest star visible in the\nevening and the brightest star visible the morning. According to the\n2D rationalist, these reference-fixing criteria are (i) an aspect of\nmeaning, (ii) which can be known apriori via conceptual analysis, and\n(iii) which suffices to fix the applicability conditions for every\npossible world considered as one’s actual environment. If the 2D\nframework can be used to isolate such an aspect of meaning for all\nexpressions, we will have vindicated the rationalist’s “golden\ntriangle” connecting meaning, apriority and possibility. \nVindicating this “golden triangle” constitutes a primary\ntheoretical constraint for a rationalist interpretation of 2D\nsemantics. A 2D semantics that meets this constraint would play a\nwide-ranging role in philosophy. It would account for core semantic\nroles associated with the Fregean notion of sense (Chalmers 2002b) and\nthe traditional notion of a proposition (Chalmers 2011a). In addition,\nrationalist 2D semantics promises to define a versatile notion of\nnarrow thought content suited to playing key explanatory and\nevaluative roles in commonsense psychology (Chalmers 2002c).\nFurthermore, the rationalist approach to meaning and modality\nunderwrites a distinctive form of apriori reasoning about the nature\nof the actual world: \nChalmers has developed a highly influential anti-physicalist argument\nalong these lines, which relies on a rationalist 2D semantic framework\nto establish that facts about phenomenal consciousness cannot be\nreduced to physical or functional facts about the brain (1996; 2009).\n[See the supplementary document:\n The 2D Argument Against Materialism.] \nAny interpretation of the 2D framework must answer the following two\nquestions: \nBut the rationalist project imposes specific constraints on how these\nquestions are answered. To vindicate the “golden\ntriangle”, the rationalist must identify a way of mapping an\nindividual speaker’s understanding of particular expressions onto\npossible worlds that affords apriori access to the entire space of\npossibility. This is not a trivial requirement: standard ways of\ninterpreting the 2D framework cannot vindicate the rationalist\nproject. However Chalmers has developed a distinctive\n“epistemic” interpretation of the 2D framework that he\nbelieves can establish the relevant constitutive links between\nmeaning, apriority and possibility (2004, 2006a). \nA rationalist 2D semantics must vindicate the following principle: \nA sentence’s 1-intension is an intension that corresponds to the\ndiagonal of a 2D matrix. So the Core Thesis affirms that a token\nsentence is apriori (for a subject at a particular time) just in case\nthere is no possible way the world might be that, if it actually\nobtained, would make \\(S\\) false. In effect, the Core Thesis sums\nup the “golden triangle” of constitutive connections the\nrationalist hopes to establish between meaning, apriority, and\npossibility: (i) it postulates a possible way the world could be for\nevery apriori coherent hypothesis, and vice versa; and (ii) this tight\nconnection between apriority and possibility is reflected in an aspect\nof linguistic meaning, the\n 1-intension.[16] \nThe major obstacle to vindicating the Core Thesis for standard\ninterpretations of the 2D framework is the assignment\nprinciple—the way 2D theories assign extensions relative to\n“worlds considered as actual”. A natural way of\nunderstanding the injunction to consider a possible world as actual is\nto simply imagine a possible world, locate oneself in it, and then\nrely on ordinary interpretive methods to decide what exactly a person\nin those empirical circumstances is referring to when using a given\nexpression. Chalmers calls this strategy for assigning 1-intensions to\nexpressions a “contextualist” interpretation of the 2D\nframework. What’s distinctive of a contextualist approach is (i) that\na token of the target expression must be located within the world\nconsidered as actual, and (ii) that the expression is assigned an\nextension on the basis of how it’s used in that world. On this\napproach, a 1-intension will be undefined for possible worlds\nthat do not contain a token of the target expression: no extension can\nbe assigned for such worlds, not even an empty extension. \nThis contextualist approach to assigning 1-intensions is incompatible\nwith the Core Thesis (Chalmers 2004, 167­–176). Consider\nsentences like ‘Language exists’ or ‘A sentient\nbeing exists’: intuitively the meaning of these sentences will\nguarantee that they are true in every possible context in which they\nare used. So on the contextualist approach, these sentences should be\nassigned necessary 1-intensions, mapping every possible context of use\nto the truth-value True. But contrary to the Core Thesis, these\nsentences are not apriori truths knowable independently of\nany empirical evidence. After all, there’s no contradiction in the\nvery idea of a world without language or thought, and we can imagine\nperfectly well what such a world would be like. It’s just that our\neveryday experience allows us to immediately rule out the possibility\nthat our actual environment is like that. The problem is that although\nit’s both apriori coherent and metaphysically possible for there to be\nworlds with no language or thought, contextualist 1-intensions are\nundefined for those possible worlds. So a necessary contextual\n1-intension does not track apriority or metaphysical necessity.\nContextualist 1-intensions, therefore, cannot satisfy the\nrationalist’s Core\n Thesis.[17] \nThis difficulty can be avoided, Chalmers argues, if we rely on a\nnotion of epistemic possibility—what seems\npossible after ideal rational reflection—to interpret the 2D\nframework. More specifically, he focuses on the notion of apriori\ncoherence: claims that could be true for all one can tell on the basis\nof idealized apriori\n reasoning.[18]\n This notion of apriori coherence is used to answer the two\ninterpretive questions highlighted above: (i) apriori coherence is\nused to characterize the possibilities relative to which 1-intensions\nare defined, and (2) apriori coherence is invoked to assign\n1-intensions to a speaker’s expressions. \nFirst consider the possibilities that define 1-intensions. On the\nepistemic interpretation, the possibilities are not metaphysically\npossible contexts of use, but epistemically possible\n“scenarios”: maximally specific hypotheses about what\none’s actual environment might be like that cannot be ruled out\nthrough apriori reasoning alone. Scenarios provide a complete\ncharacterization of the entire history of a universe, down to the last\nmicrophysical detail. They also provide perspectival\ninformation—a notional “center”—that indicates\nthe location from which the hypothetical universe is to be considered.\nThe crucial point is that scenarios are defined by their epistemic\nrole: they represent ways we can conceive of the actual world, within\nwhich we can try to identify familiar objects, kinds or\n properties.[19] \nThe second distinctive element of the epistemic interpretation of 2D\nsemantics is the procedure for assigning 1-intensions to a speaker’s\nexpressions. On the epistemic approach, 1-intensions reflect relations\nof apriori coherence between descriptions of possible scenarios and\nordinary language sentences: \nThis principle for assigning 1-intensions relies on the speaker’s\nordinary ability to engage in object-level reasoning about\ncombinations of hypotheses: given the assumption that the scenario\ndescription \\(W\\) is true, you’re asked to decide whether\n\\(S\\) must be true as well. If it’s incoherent to accept\n\\((W\\) & not\\(-S)\\), your epistemic intension for\n\\(S\\) maps \\(W\\) to True, otherwise \\(W\\) is mapped to\nFalse. This epistemic assignment principle contrasts sharply with the\ncontextualist principle. The contextualist approach requires us to\nengage in explicit meta-linguistic reasoning to interpret the\nexpression ‘\\(S\\)’ as it’s used within the\npossible world \\(W\\). On the epistemic approach, in contrast, an\nextension is assigned to ‘\\(S\\)’ on the basis of the\nsubject’s own object-level reasoning using the expressions\n‘\\(W\\)’ and ‘\\(S\\)’. \nUnlike the contextualist approach, therefore, the epistemic assignment\nprinciple does not explicitly require that a scenario contain a token\nof the relevant expression type in order to assign an extension\nrelative to that scenario. As a consequence, sentences like\n‘Language exists’ seem to pose no special problem for\nsatisfying the Core Thesis. The sentence ‘Language exists’\nwill have a contingent epistemic 1-intension, because there are\npossible scenarios that are apriori consistent with both the truth and\nfalsity of that sentence. For instance, consider a scenario in which\nthe only object is a giant lump of salt. To test whether your sentence\n‘Language exists’ is true at this scenario considered as\nactual, you ask whether there is any incoherence in combining the\nclaim ‘The only object that exists is a lump of salt’ with\nthe claim ‘It’s not the case that language exists’.\nIntuitively, this combination is coherent: there is no language in the\nsalt world. So the epistemic 1-intension for your sentence\n‘Language exists’ yields the value False for that\nscenario. Since there are other scenarios relative to which the\nsentence ‘Language exists’ will have the value True, your\nsentence will have a contingent epistemic 1-intension. This contingent\nepistemic intension for your sentence ‘Language exists’\nreflects the fact that it’s not apriori true that language exists. So\nit seems the epistemic assignment principle will allow apriority and\nnecessity of the 1-intension to go hand in hand, as required by the\nCore Thesis. \nThere is further work to do in spelling out Chalmers’ E2D\nframework in such a way as to vindicate his rationalist project. One\nway to think about the rationalist project is as a combination of the\nfollowing theses: \nTogether, 1 and 2 constitute a sort of semantic reductionism: the\nmeaning of any ordinary language expression is reduced to the meanings\nof the base vocabulary via the epistemic exercise of considering\nscenarios as actual and worlds as counterfactual. And 3 ensures that\nthis epistemic exercise is an accurate guide to metaphysical\npossibility. Chalmers’ Core Thesis is meant to capture this\ntight relationship between grasp of meaning, apriori reflection, and\nmetaphysical possibility.  \nHowever, simply rejecting C2D in favor of E2D does not yet provide any\npositive account of what it is to entertain an epistemic scenario W,\nand how we should update our beliefs in the light of the supposition\nthat W is actual. Without these details, it’s impossible to\ndetermine whether the Core Thesis is true. Perhaps it’s\nimpossible to consider a scenario as actual without presupposing\none’s own existence, or perhaps our best epistemic methods for\nupdating our beliefs presupposes the existence of those very beliefs;\nor perhaps there is no way of thinking about the world that\ndoesn’t rely on some further empirical assumptions about the\nworld.  \nChalmers has entered into these interpretive questions in considerable\ndetail over many publications. The starting point for his approach is\noutlined in (Chalmers and Jackson 2001), where he suggests that\nscenarios can be understood as PQTI sentences: where P states\nmicrophysical truths, Q states phenomenal truths, T is a\n‘that’s all’ clause indicating that P and Q provide\na complete description of a possible universe, and I indicates the\nsubject’s notional location within that universe. P and Q employ\na canonical vocabulary that fully specifies the essential nature of\nthe fundamental properties upon which all other properties in a\npossible world supervene. Thus, PQTI sentences provide an\nepistemically transparent access to the space of epistemic and\nmetaphysical possibility (simply removing the self-locating\ninformation from a PQTI sentence yields a complete description of a\ncorresponding possible world, PQT). The 1-intensions of one’s\nordinary language expressions are then determined by the individual\nsubject’s ideally reflective dispositions to judge sentences\ntrue, assuming the truth of different PQTI-sentences. And 2-intensions\nare fixed by one’s reasoning about PQT sentences considered as\ncounterfactual (given assumptions about PQTI). (Chalmers 2006, 2011b)\nfurther articulates how the space of epistemic possibility can be\nunderstood, how scenarios are related to possible worlds, and how 1-\nand 2-intensions are assigned to token representations.  \nMost recently, in Constructing the World (2012), Chalmers has focused\nsquarely on the epistemic ‘scrutability’ relation that\nconnects our understanding of ordinary language expressions to\nbase-level descriptions of scenarios. \nApriori Scrutability: There is a compact class of basic truths D such\nthat for any truth S, one can conclusively know ‘D \\(\\supset\\)\nS’ apriori.\n \nChalmers still takes PQTI sentences to be a promising candidate for\nspecifying a scrutability base D, but he is open to the possibility\nthat the descriptive vocabulary in PQTI may need to be supplemented in\norder to capture some truths, such as truths about causal relations or\nquiddities. But while he can afford to be flexible about the exact\nnature of the scrutability base, Chalmers’ rationalist program\ndepends on vindicating Apriori Scrutability for any sentence that is\nevaluable as possibly true or false (169–71). A good deal thus hangs\non whether he is right that ideal epistemic procedures allow for\napriori justification, given an exhaustive base-level description of a\nscenario. Chalmers offers two complementary arguments to support the\nplausibility of this view in (2012, ch. 4.).  \nIt’s worth noting that there are other ways of interpreting an\nE2D framework defined on epistemic and metaphysical possibilities,\nwhich do not support Chalmers’ rationalist program. Wolfgang\nSpohn, for instance, suggests that the epistemically possible\nscenarios should be understood along the lines of concrete universes,\nwhereas counterfactual metaphysical possibilities should be understood\nas ‘totalities’ constructed from the best descriptions of\na concrete environment (Spohn 2016). Spohn suggests that this\ninterpretation of the 2D framework does a better job in capturing the\nways in which our ways of categorizing our actual physical environment\nis partly pragmatic and not fully determined by its physical\nstructure, and while also vindicating metaphysical essentialism for\ncounterfactual possibilities. The result is a pragmatist approach to\nE2D that is ill suited to Chalmers’ rationalist project.  \nEpistemic 2D semantics differs in important respects from other\ntheoretical accounts of meaning. Semantic theories normally describe\ngeneral semantic rules governing expression types, whereas\nepistemic 2D semantics is based on a single individual’s current\nunderstanding of a token expression. Kaplan and Jackson, for\ninstance, use the 2D framework to characterize the implicit\nconventions governing syntactically individuated expressions like\n‘I’ or ‘water’ in our linguistic community. In\ncontrast, the rationalist uses the 2D framework to characterize your\npotentially idiosyncratic understanding of a particular use of an\nexpression on a given occasion—e.g., the way you understood Al\nGore’s fifth use of ‘water’ during a speech on climate\nchange. On the epistemic approach, moreover, 2D semantic values depend\non the upshot of ideal rational reflection about apriori coherence\nrelations. Just what is involved in ideal rational reflection is an\nopen question. But it’s plausible that it may depend on substantive\nconstructive theorizing about the empirical scenario in question and\non various non-obvious and idiosyncratic aspects of the subject’s\ninitial cognitive state. In that case, identifying the precise\nepistemic 1-intension associated with your understanding of\n‘water’ will be a highly non-trivial matter, and it may be\nfar from obvious when your understanding of the term shifts so that\ntwo tokens no longer share the same epistemic 1-intension. This is\nwhy, in contrast with 2D empiricists like Jackson, a rationalist like\nChalmers denies that epistemic 1-intensions reflect the subject’s\n“implicit knowledge” of a reference-fixing criterion\n(e.g., Chalmers 2002a, 185; 2006b, §5). \nOf course, it’s possible that some epistemic intensions will reflect\nstable reference-fixing rules that are entrenched by implicit\nlinguistic conventions. But it’s also possible that some epistemic\nintensions will reflect highly abstract, heterogeneous, unstable, and\nidiosyncratic aspects of a speaker’s understanding at a given time. As\na consequence, epistemic intensions are not guaranteed to line up with\nconventional linguistic meanings (Chalmers 2002b). Given this\ndivergence from standard semantic theories, one may wonder whether\nepistemic intensions deserve to be considered a kind of\nmeaning. \nHowever, according to the 2D rationalist, epistemic intensions play\nthe core semantic roles associated with Fregean senses (Chalmers\n2002b). Like Fregean senses, epistemic 1-intensions lend themselves to\na compositional semantic theory: the epistemic intension of a sentence\nis determined by the epistemic intensions of the component\nexpressions. Moreover, epistemic 1-intensions, like Fregean senses,\nreflect the speaker’s own rational perspective on what her words\nrepresent. Two token names ‘\\(A\\)’ and\n‘\\(B\\)’ have the same Fregean senses iff the identity\n‘A = B’ would strike the speaker as trivially\ntrue. Similarly, a subject associates two token expressions with\nthe same epistemic intension iff they are apriori\n equivalent.[20]\n Finally, epistemic intensions may play a role similar to that of\nFregean senses in the semantics of attitude reports (Chalmers 2011a).\nOverall, then, epistemic intensions seem to provide an attractive\ntheoretical refinement of the Fregean notion of sense. \nIn addition, epistemic intensions arguably carve out a well-defined\nnotion of narrow content suited to playing key roles in commonsense\npsychology (Chalmers 2002c). Epistemic intensions reflect rational\nrelations among a person’s thoughts that are discernible independently\nof any empirical inquiry. As a consequence, epistemic intensions\nidentify representational states that are relevant to assessing a\nperson’s rationality and to explaining rational thought processes. \nIt’s important to note that epistemic 1-intensions are intended to\nexplain only one aspect of meaning. The 2D semantic framework\nalso posits 2-intensions (“counterfactual” or\n“subjunctive” intensions), which reflect the modal profile\nof the object, kind or property picked out by an expression. All 2D\ntheorists agree that 2-intensions play an important role in explaining\nthe semantics of modal sentences. Moreover, the two aspects of meaning\ncaptured by the epistemic 2D framework are not intended to provide an\nexhaustive characterization of all semantically relevant\nphenomena: \nTwo distinctive aspects of the rationalist project are (a) its\ncommitment to the modal rationalist thesis that we have apriori access\nto the space of metaphysical possibility and (b) its commitment to an\napriori aspect of meaning that can be captured with the 2D modal\nframework. Both aspects of the rationalist project have been\nchallenged by critics. \nAccording to the modal rationalist, if a hypothesis cannot be ruled\nout by idealized apriori reflection then it’s metaphysically possible\nfor it to be true. So the space of apriori coherent scenarios is a\nfailsafe guide to the space of metaphysical possibility. This thesis\nis crucial if one hopes to draw metaphysical conclusions on the basis\nof apriori conceptual analysis (e.g., the 2D argument against\nmaterialism). Critics have challenged the extensional adequacy of\nmodal rationalism on the basis of putative counterexamples. The thesis\nis also open to more general theoretical challenges. \nCertain examples suggest that a hypothesis can be apriori coherent\neven though it’s metaphysically impossible for it to be true.\nSometimes a claim and its negation both seem apriori coherent. For\ninstance, it seems apriori coherent that there could be a necessarily\nexisting god and that there could be no such god—but obviously\nit’s impossible for both of these claims to be true. This suggests\nthat apriori coherence is a fallible guide to genuine possibility\n(Yablo 1999, 2000b). Other examples of this sort include unprovable\nmathematical necessities and metaphysically necessary laws of nature.\nChalmers (1999, 2002a) argues that all such alleged counterexamples\nfail: either they are not apriori coherent (e.g. necessarily existing\nbeings) or they are not necessary (e.g., necessary laws of nature). A\ndifferent type of counterexample turns on concepts whose applicability\nis determined by a subject’s ostensive or recognitional capacities\nin the actual world (Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Loar 1999;\nPerry 2001; Yablo 2002). For instance, we may recognize ovals by the\nway they would visually strike us. Since the applicability of such\nconcepts depends on the actual exercise of these\npsychological capacities (whose nature we don’t fully understand),\nit’s impossible to know apriori whether a certain equation in analytic\ngeometry captures the shape of ovals. To know this, one must\nactually see the shapes generated by the equation\n(Yablo 2002, §13–19; 2006). In response, (Chalmers 2002a,\n§12) argues that the alleged counterexamples can be accommodated\nwithin his 2D framework. \nA third type of alleged counterexample hinges on objects, kinds or\nproperties whose intrinsic character is not exhaustively knowable\n(Schroeter 2004). For instance, it might be impossible to fully\nunderstand the intrinsic character of quarks and gluons—we can\nonly know them by their causal effects at the macro-level. It seems\napriori coherent that there could be such unknowable properties. But\nthen according to modal rationalism itself, there must be distinct\nmetaphysical possible worlds that cannot be distinguished through\napriori reflection: e.g., two possible worlds in which different\nintrinsic properties play the gluon role. So apriori coherence would\nfail to provide an accurate guide to the space of metaphysical\npossibility. In response, (Chalmers 2002a, §10–11; 2006a,\n§5) argues that (i) unknowable essences are controversial and may\nbe incoherent, (ii) the 2D framework can still capture what is\npossible for all we can know, and (iii) there will still be\nat least one metaphysical possibility for every apriori\ncoherent scenario, so apriori coherence is still a failsafe guide to\nmetaphysical possibility. \nFinally, the underlying rationalist claim that objective metaphysical\npossibility is constitutively bound up with ideal rationality is\ncontroversial. Modal conventionalists seek to explain the access to\nmodal facts by denying their objective status: facts about what’s\npossible are mere projections of our implicit semantic rules or\npsychological dispositions (e.g., Kant 1787; Carnap 1950; Sidelle\n1989). Modal empiricists, in contrast, insist on the\njudgment-independent nature of metaphysical facts and deny that we\nhave apriori access to them: our access to the nature of empirical\nobjects, kinds, and properties is always based on and corrigible by\nexperience (e.g., Putnam 1975; Stalnaker 2003; Williamson 2007; Yablo\n2000). In contrast, the modal rationalist seeks to vindicate the\nobjectivity of modal facts by appealing to idealized apriori reasoning\n(Descartes 1641; Chalmers 2002a). [See the entry on\n the epistemology of modality.] \nEven if one rejects modal rationalism, the semantic rationalist\ninsists that epistemic 2D semantics may capture an important aspect of\nmeaning that connects meaning, apriority, and the space of\nepistemic possibility. A crucial criterion of adequacy for\nthis project is to provide a way of interpreting the 2D framework that\nsatisfies the rationalist’s Core Thesis: \nCore Thesis: For any \\(S, S\\) is apriori iff its\nepistemic intension is necessary.\n \nSome critics have sought to show that epistemic 2D semantics cannot\nsatisfy this constraint. The problem is that epistemic intensions are\nassigned on the basis of the speaker’s commonsense standards for\nevaluating the apriori coherence of combining the target sentence with\na description of a scenario. But commonsense standards may presuppose\nthat the speaker, her words or her thoughts exist within the\nhypothetical scenario. If so, the epistemic approach will run into\nsimilar problems to those that plagued the contextualist approach: the\nnecessity of the epistemic intension will not line up with genuine\nepistemic or metaphysical\n necessity.[21] \nAccording to Yablo (2002: §1–10), commonsense evaluations\nof the kind of conditionals Chalmers uses to assign epistemic\nintensions are sensitive to information about how words are used\nwithin a hypothetical scenario. By commonsense standards,\nYablo contends, the following type of conditional is apriori true: \nIf my word ‘wing’ actually means tail and horses\nhave tails, then horses have wings.\n \nIf epistemic intensions are assigned on the basis of these sorts of\njudgments about conditionals, then every sentence will have a\ncontingent epistemic intension: even mathematical necessities like\n‘\\(2^2 = 4\\)’ will yield the value False for\nscenarios in which your sentence ‘\\(2^2 = 4\\)’ means\ntomatoes are numbers. Epistemic 2D semantics would therefore\nviolate the Core Thesis. According to Chalmers, this problematic\nresult can be avoided if the assignment principle is formulated more\ncarefully. The antecedent of Yablo’s conditional is making a claim\nabout how the quoted word (‘wing’) is used at the center\nof a scenario. But there is no apriori reason to suppose that anything\nat all follows about the physiology of horses from such a linguistic\nfact. The key difference between Yablo’s understanding of the\nconditional and Chalmers’ is that Yablo assumes that you’ll treat the\nword quoted in the antecedent as identical in content to the\nhomophonic word used in the consequent. Chalmers denies this\nassumption and so allows for necessary epistemic intensions (2002a,\n169–71). \nSchroeter (2005) presses a similar objection. To assign epistemic\nintensions to expressions, we must evaluate conditionals like\n‘if the actual world is like Twin Earth, then water =\nXYZ’. Schroeter argues that commonsense epistemic norms\npresuppose that the token of ‘water’ being used\nin the consequent must itself exist within the scenario considered as\nactual in the antecedent. Consider a scenario in which there is both\nH2O and XYZ in your vicinity: it may be that you’ve only\nbeen using the term ‘water’ to interact with one of these\nsubstances. By commonsense standards, which stuff counts as water will\ndepend crucially on which stuff is causally hooked up in the right way\nwith the very token of ‘water’ whose applicability you’re\ntrying to adjudicate: without such a causal hook-up, no verdict is\njustifiable. If this is right, epistemic intensions will be\nundefined for scenarios in which the target expression does\nnot exist. And then the same type of counterexamples to the Core\nThesis that undermine the contextualist approach will also apply to\nthe epistemic approach: aposteriori sentences about the existence of\nlanguage or thought will have necessary epistemic intensions. Speaks\n(2010) builds on this line of thought. He argues that it’s not just\ncommonsense epistemic norms that generate the problem: any\ninterpretive norms consistent with Chalmers’ restrictions on the\ncanonical specification of scenarios will generate necessary epistemic\nintensions for sentences that are not plausibly apriori. In\nparticular, certain complex disjunctions involving the existence of\nindividuals, their properties and their relations to oneself will have\nnecessary epistemic intensions. For a continuation of this debate, see\n(Elliott, McQueen, and Weber 2013; Schroeter 2013; Speaks 2014;\nStillman 2015). \nFinally, Derek Ball (2014) articulates a social challenge to necessary\n1-intensions based on Tyler Burge’s anti-individualism.\nAccording to Ball, our willingness to revise virtually any belief in\nthe light of others’ testimony undercuts the claim that any\nthoughts have necessary 1-intensions. As a consequence, he argues, E2D\ncannot explain Fregean cognitive significance or the rationalist\nconnection between conceivability and possibility. \nAlthough empiricists and rationalists invoke the 2D framework for\ndifferent explanatory purposes, they agree on three important theses.\nThey defend apriori conceptual analysis, and take it to play an\nimportant role in metaphysics. They hold that the 2D framework\ncaptures a kind of meaning: a genuinely semantic aspect of linguistic\nunderstanding, rather than a merely contingent pattern of beliefs. And\nthey use the 2D framework to represent a broadly internalist approach\nto reference determination. These positions are distinctive of the\ngeneralized 2D semantics and all three are controversial. \nA common complaint about generalized 2D semantics is that there are no\nplausible extant analyses of names or natural kind terms, and the 2D\nframework provides no assurances that an analysis will be forthcoming\n(e.g., Block and Stalnaker 1999; Byrne and Pryor 2006; Soames 2005).\nChalmers, for instance, characterizes the 1-intension of\n‘water’ as follows: \nThis informal definition is obviously sketchy and incomplete. Critics\ncontend that any attempt to provide a more precise definition will be\nsubject to counterexamples: we can imagine empirical situations where\nthe definition would fail to give the intuitively correct verdict\nabout the extension. Insofar as this claim is based exclusively on\ninduction from past failures, however, it is unconvincing. Generalized\n2D semantics is not committed to any particular analysis, and the\ncorrect 2D analysis may be quite complex. Indeed, the 2D framework\nallows for “analyses” in the form of 1-intensions that\ncannot be finitely specified in any natural language. So 2D theorists\ncan simply accept the intuitions that critics cite against particular\nanalyses: in their view such intuitions help to elucidate the correct\n2D analysis of a term. To establish that no such 2D analysis is\npossible, therefore, one must appeal to broader theoretical\nconsiderations. Critics have targeted each of the three key\ntheoretical commitments of generalized 2D semantics. More recently,\nsome critics have raised worries about whether the 2D semantic\nframework is well-defined. \nProponents of generalized 2D semantics hold that verdicts about\nhypothetical cases that ground the assignment of 1-intensions capture\na priori conceptual truths: propositions that can be conclusively\njustified without relying on any information about one’s\nreal-world environment. Chalmers and Jackson (2001) argue that we can\nhave conclusive apriori knowledge of “application\nconditionals” like ‘if the actual world is like Twin\nEarth, then water = XYZ’. They argue that any empirical\ninformation relevant to justifying a verdict about the conditional is\npacked into the specification of the antecedent. So information about\nyour real-world environment plays no essential role in justifying\nverdicts about the conditional: it is either redundant or irrelevant.\nHowever, facts about one’s real environment may play a purely\ncausal role in shaping your current understanding of ‘water’.\nMoreover, any changes in your understanding of ‘water’ that would\nsuffice to justify different verdicts about the application\nconditionals, they contend, would eo ipso change the meaning of your\nword ‘water’ – such changes would therefore be irrelevant to\njustifying verdicts about what water is (given your current meaning).\n \nThe apriori status of application conditionals can be challenged in\nmany different ways. One type of challenge targets the prior\nunderstanding that justifies verdicts about application conditionals.\nVerdicts about which items count as water in a scenario considered as\nactual will be justified on the basis of a complex pattern of initial\nassumptions about water–one’s implicit “folk\ntheory” of water. Critics argue that each element of this folk\ntheory was originally based on empirical experience and is corrigible\nin the light of further experience. Therefore, the verdicts based on\none’s folk theory should also count as aposteriori, not apriori\n(e.g. Putnam 1970; Block and Stalnaker 1999; Laurence and Margolis\n2003; Nimtz 2004; Byrne and Pryor 2006). A related criticism is that\ngeneralized 2D semantics makes implausible assumptions about\nwhat’s required for possessing the same concept or meaning\n(Schroeter 2006; Diaz-Leon 2011). If the patterns of understanding\nthat ground verdicts about application conditionals are not required\nfor sameness of concept, then successful empirical inquiry can justify\nchanges in one’s ideal verdicts about application conditionals\nwithout changing the meaning of one’s terms. So these\nconditionals cannot be conclusively known apriori. See (Pickel 2016)\nfor a formal model of how such changes might be rationally justified.\n. \nA second type of challenge to the apriority of application\nconditionals focuses on the process of reflection on hypothetical\nscenarios. These critics argue that purely hypothetical reasoning\nabout a scenario may not reliably reflect the verdicts one would\nendorse if one were actually confronted with the relevant scenario.\nFor instance, (Williamson 2006, 2007) and (Jenkins 2008, 2012) contend\nthat the intellectual skills involved in coming to judgments about\nhypothetical cases will justify verdicts only if those skills have\nbeen honed through empirical feedback. So reasoning about application\nconditionals depends for its justification on experience of\none’s real-world environment, even if it is not based on any\nempirical premises. (Rupert 2016) takes this line of thought further,\narguing that the intellectual skills relevant to determining the\napplication of scientific concepts are typically acquired through\nembodied training – and such skills cannot be replicated via\nreasoning about descriptions of hypothetical scenarios. In a slightly\ndifferent vein, (Dowell 2008) argues that actually believing an\nempirical claim S may ground different verdicts than merely supposing\nS. In particular, when a hypothetical scenario conflicts with your\ncore empirical beliefs, your armchair reasoning may fail to track the\nreasoning you would endorse if you actually found yourself forced to\naccept that scenario as actual. The crucial question for generalized\n2D semantics is whether such mismatches between hypothetical reasoning\nand real-life reasoning can be explained as failures of ideal\nrationality or conceptual change. If so, a two-dimensionalist can\ninsist that application conditionals are apriori accessible in\nprinciple, even if our actual armchair judgments will inevitably fall\nshort due to psychological limitations (Braddon-Mitchell 2015;\nChalmers 2012: 181–84). \nA third type of challenge targets a specific class of concepts,\ndemonstrative or recognitional concepts. Critics argue that the\napplicability conditions for these concepts depend essentially on\nactually having certain experiences: e.g. having the experience of\nseeing that color, or seeing that canary, or seeing a shape that’s\nsimilar to an egg (Loar 1990, 1999; Perry 2001; Pryor 2006; Valaris\n2009; Yablo 2002, 2006, (Williamson 2012)). Apriori reflection on a\npossible scenario cannot elicit the relevant experiences, nor can it\nestablish that you would have the relevant experiences if actually\nconfronted with the scenario in question. So these critics conclude\nthat apriori reflection alone cannot justify verdicts about the\napplicability of this type of concept. In response, proponents of\ngeneralized 2D semantics will seek to show either (i) that the\nrelevant experiences can be included in specifications of scenarios\nconsidered as actual or (ii) that the 2D framework can be used to\ncapture the way the reference of such concepts is fixed (Chalmers\n2002a). More recently, Chalmers argues that recognitional capacities\nfor non-basic concepts are never essential to one’s ability to\napply the concept: in principle you can always justify verdicts about\na scenario without relying on a basic recognitional capacity (2012:\n139–148). \nA final type of objection seeks to show that generalized 2D semantics\nover-generates apriori truths. For instance, (Speaks 2010, 2014)\nargues that generalized 2D semantics is committed to the apriority of\ncontingent facts about the existence of individuals – a result\nthat conflicts with commonsense intuitions about what’s knowable\napriori. See (Elliott, McQueen, and Weber 2013) for a defense of the\napriority of such claims. And (Williamson 2006, 2007) argues that\nthere are no conclusively justifiable conceptual truths, even in the\ncase of conventional kinds like ‘vixen’ or logical\nvocabulary like ‘all’. See (Boghossian 2011) for a reply.\n \nChalmers’ Constructing the World (2012) provides a systematic\ndefense of the apriority of application conditionals, and responds in\ndetail to many individual critics. The book’s central claim is\nthat there is some compact base-level vocabulary, such that\napplication conditionals formulated using that base vocabulary are\nconclusively knowable on the basis of apriori reflection and\nconceptual competence alone. Chalmers articulates the underlying\nepistemic relation, ‘apriori scrutability’, that defines\nepistemic 1-intensions, and explores different potential base\nvocabularies. Chalmers seeks to show that the apriori scrutability of\nall truths is an intuitively plausible generalization of a\nthinker’s ability to justify verdicts on the basis of empirical\ninformation about her environment. And he provides two arguments, (i)\nfrom the suspension of belief and (ii) from Bayesian principles to\nsupport the apriority of application conditionals (2012, ch 4). For\nrecent discussion of Chalmers’ arguments along with\nChalmers’ replies, see (Neta 2014; Schroeter 2014; Stanley 2014;\nChalmers 2014; Soames 2014; Turner 2014; Wilson 2014; Chalmers 2014;\nTiehen 2014; Pickel 2016).  \nThe semantic status of 1-intensions has also been challenged in\ndifferent ways, reflecting different assumptions about what is crucial\nto meaning. \nSome critics argue that the semantic values generated by generalized\n2D semantics are too unstable to provide plausible conditions for\ncompetence with a meaning or a concept. In particular, the\n1-intensions assigned to names and natural kind terms will be too\nsensitive to idiosyncrasies in a subject’s current understanding to be\nstable through reasonable changes in belief or shareable by different\nmembers of a linguistic community (e.g., Block and Stalnaker 1999;\nKroon 2004a; Schroeter 2003; Soames 2005; Stalnaker 2004; Yablo\n2000b). Whether this is a telling objection depends on larger issues\nabout the explanatory role of meanings—in particular, to what\nextent meanings must be stable through disagreement and theory change.\nThe 2D account can vindicate some stability, but it will not be able\nto vindicate all commonsense epistemic intuitions about sameness of\nmeaning. See Chalmers (2012: ch. 5, and 9th excursus) for a recent\nreply to worries about stability of meaning. \nA different objection argues that 1-intensions misrepresent the\nintuitive subject matter of language and thought. According to this\nobjection, generalized 2D semantics has the implausible consequence\nthat one cannot speak or think directly about individuals:\nthe real subject matter of our ‘Obama’ talk is not the man\nhimself, but whoever happens to satisfy a particular reference-fixing\ncriterion. Similarly, the real subject matter of our\n‘water’ talk is not H2O, but whatever fulfills\nour commonsense reference-fixing role. Critics argue that this\nmisrepresents our ability to think directly about individuals and\nnatural kinds (Byrne 2001; Perry 2001, ch. 8; Soames 2005, ch. 10;\n2006a; Stalnaker 2004). Proponents of generalized 2D semantics argue\nthat the second aspect of meaning, the 2-intension, fully explains\nsuch intuitions about the intuitive subject matter of names and\nnatural kind terms. \nFinally, critics have argued that generalized 2D semantics faces\ndifficulties in providing a compositional semantic theory. Diego\nMarconi (2005) argues that generalized 2D semantics faces difficulties\nintegrating the two distinct aspects of meaning into a unified\nsemantic theory. In particular, he argues that the role of two\ndistinct intensions in compositional semantics gives rise to something\nlike a semantic ambiguity, which generates problems for the\ninterpretation of subjunctive conditionals. See (Bealer 2002) for\nanother ambiguity interpretation of 2D semantics. In a similar spirit,\nScott Soames (2005) objects that 2D semantics cannot explain Kripke’s\nexamples of necessary aposteriori truths, since there is no single\nproposition (understood as a set of possible worlds) that is both\nnecessary and contingent. Soames (2005, ch. 10) goes on to argue that\ngeneralized 2D semantics cannot provide a plausible compositional\nsemantics for the sentences involving both epistemic and metaphysical\noperators: e.g. he argues that 2D semantics generates incorrect\ninterpretations when modal operators, indexicals, or de re\npropositions are embedded within attitude reports. And Graeme Forbes\n(2011) raises a group of puzzle cases for 2D semantics involving the\ninteraction of factive operators like ‘someone establishes\nthat’, with epistemic and metaphysical operators like\n‘it’s apriori that’ and ‘it’s necessary\nthat’. Forbes sees this as a challenge to any two-factor theory\nof meaning. And Wlodek Rabinowicz (2010) suggests that a\none-dimensional semantic framework with a more sophisticated\ninterpretation function is better suited to handling the distinction\nbetween ‘it’s apriori that’ and ‘it’s\nanalytic that’ than a two-dimensional framework like that of\nChalmers and Jackson. \nIn response, proponents of generalized 2D semantics have sought to\nclarify their own core commitments at the level of compositional\nsemantics. (Chalmers 2006b) strongly denies that he is committed to\nambiguity, since the two elements of meaning are necessarily\ncorrelated. (Chalmers 2011) argues that worries about embedding within\nattitude reports can be handled by an explicitly two-dimensional\naccount of propositions and a better analysis of the semantics for\nattitude reports (together with appropriate pragmatics). And in\nresponse to Forbes’ puzzles, (Chalmers and Rabern 2014) argue\nthat the source of the tension is not the 2D semantic machinery, but\nrather commonsense commitments about apriority, necessity and\ncontingent apriori truths. So any semantic theory will face similar\ndifficulties in reconciling these commitments. They go on to\narticulate two possible responses on behalf of two-dimensionalism. See\n(Fritz 2013; Johannesson and Packalén 2016; Kipper forthcoming)\nfor alternative semantic accounts of the puzzle cases that are\ncompatible with generalized 2D semantics.  \nA different type of worry focuses on whether the epistemic factors\ncited by generalized 2D semantics can generate determinate\n1-intensions in the first place. As we saw, 1-intensions are intended\nto capture an individual’s implicit epistemic commitments about\nthe application-conditions of her words. Some critics, however, raise\nworries about whether 1-intensions are well-defined. Chalmers and\nJackson (2001) assign semantic values relative to a base-level\ndescription of a scenario — something like a PQTI-sentence\nstating basic microphysical, phenomenal, and self-locating\ninformation, together with a ‘that’s all’\ncompleteness claim. Ordinary conceptual competence is then supposed to\nput one in a position to conclusively justify any conditional truth of\nthe form (PQTI \\(\\supset\\) S). According to generalized 2D semantics, this\nepistemic procedure generates a determinate 1-intension for any\nmeaningful sentence S. Although Generalized 2D can allow that some\nsentences may have indeterminate truth-values relative to some\nscenarios, too much indeterminacy will undermine the viability of the\napproach. A number of critics argue that 1-intensions are not\nwell-defined for many, perhaps most sentences.  \nJustin Tiehen has raised an important difficulty for defining an\nadequate ‘That’s all’ clause, T, in a PQTI-sentence\n(Tiehen 2014). Without this sort of completeness clause, it will be\nimpossible to come to any justified verdict about the truth of\nordinary sentences. For instance, consider the sentence ‘There\nis no ectoplasm’ relative to a purely physical Earthlike\nscenario E. A PQI-sentence that exhaustively describes E’s\nmicrophysical, phenomenal and self-locating features, will not allow\none to rationally determine whether E contains further non-physical\nectoplasm over and above the physical features explicitly mentioned in\nPQI. In order to conclude that ‘There is no ectoplasm’ is\ntrue in E you need to know that PQI is a complete base-level\ndescription of that scenario. The question, then, is how to analyze\n‘That’s all’. Chalmers’ solution to this\nproblem is to appeal to a distinction between positive and negative\ntruths: intuitively ‘There is no ectoplasm’ is a negative\ntruth, whereas ‘Ectoplasm exists’ a positive one. Chalmers\nsuggests that T should be understood as a claim about all positive\ntruths: \nTiehen argues, however, that the distinction between positive and\nnegative truths cannot cleanly drawn in the way Chalmers hopes, so\nmost ordinary truths will end up as partly negative. The upshot is\nthat even a parade case like ‘water = H2O’ will not be\napriori entailed by PQI truths. If Tiehen is right that no better\nformulation of T is available, then the 2D framework cannot be used to\ndefine 1-intensions for most ordinary language sentences.  \nAnother worry focuses on the descriptive vocabulary in PQTI-sentences.\nIf the description of a scenario is to ground determinate verdicts\nabout 1- and 2-intensions, the predicates that attribute base-level\nmicrophysical and phenomenal properties should afford transparent\naccess to the instantiation conditions of those properties. But many\nexternalist critics will be skeptical about the possibility of such\nideal descriptive language (e.g. Stalnaker 2008, Schroeter 2004). \nSetting aside worries about the PQTI-descriptions, a different line of\nobjection questions whether your current epistemic commitments\ngenerate determinate extensions for possible scenarios considered as\nactual. Many externalist critics of Chalmers’ rationalist Core\nThesis can be interpreted as challenging the assumption that an\nindividual’s conceptual competence grounds determinate\n1-intensions (e.g., Yablo 2002, 2006; Schroeter 2006, 2013; Ball 2014;\nPickel 2016). The worry would be that conceptual competence and ideal\nepistemic norms don’t suffice to generate determinate verdicts\nfor application conditionals of the form (PQTI \\(\\supset\\) S): in many cases\nat least, ideal verdicts about application conditionals will depend\nessentially on empirical presuppositions about the real world and\none’s own representational states. If these critics are right,\n1-intensions are not suited to capturing individuals’ epistemic\ncommitments about the truth-conditions of sentences (and the thoughts\nthey express). On this approach, competence with the same word meaning\nor concept will depend in part on facts outside the epistemic purview\nof the individual subject.  \nProponents of generalized 2D semantics aim to vindicate an internalist\napproach to assigning semantic content to an individual’s expressions.\nBoth the empiricist and the rationalist versions of generalized 2D\nsemantics assign 1-intensions to words in such a way as to reflect\nindividual speakers’ current rational dispositions: 1-intensions are\ntherefore fully determined by the speaker’s current internal states.\nIn contrast, semantic externalists hold that the aspects of meaning\nthat 1-intensions are intended to explain—reference\ndetermination and competence conditions—depend in part on the\nsubject’s relation to external facts, and so cannot be fully\ndetermined by the subject’s internal states at a given time. \nInternalism is a deep methodological point of contention that\nseparates proponents of generalized 2D semantics from many of their\ncritics (e.g., Soames 2005; Stalnaker 2004). Internalists take the\nnotion of meaning to capture an aspect of an individual’s current\nstate of understanding, while externalists take the notion of meaning\nto reflect how an individual is embedded within her social and\nphysical environment. Adjudicating this disagreement raises difficult\nissues about the explanatory role of semantic theories and how that\nrole is best fulfilled. As we’ve seen, traditional empiricists aim to\nexplain the causal mechanisms that allow individual speakers to\ncoordinate their everyday classificatory dispositions, while\nrationalists seek to identify the aspect of understanding that grounds\nan individual’s ideal apriori judgments about what’s possible. Both of\nthese projects focus squarely on the individual’s current subjective\nperspective, and thus naturally suggest an internalist approach to\nintentionality. Proponents of generalized 2D semantics maintain that\nthe individual’s current state of understanding fully determines the\nrelevant truth- and applicability-conditions for her words (Chalmers\nand Jackson 2001; Gertler 2002; Braddon-Mitchell 2004). In contrast,\nsemantic externalists tend to emphasize different explanatory\nprojects: e.g. situating individuals with respect to objective\nfeatures of their environment and vindicating the holistic,\nfalliblist, and open-ended character of empirical inquiry. These\nexplanatory projects highlight individual’s relation to aspects of her\nreal-world environment and her fallibility about those relations, and\nthus naturally suggest an externalist approach to intentionality. Just\nwhich explanatory projects are most central to intentionality and how\nthe relevant phenomena are best explained are both hotly contested\nissues. [See the entries on\n externalism about mental content\n and\n narrow mental content.] \nGeneralized 2D semantics seeks to vindicate a traditional internalist\nconception of meaning: it posits an extra aspect of meaning for all\nexpressions (the intension corresponding to the diagonal of a 2D\nmatrix) that is fully determined by a subject’s internal states, and\nwhich in turn determines objective truth-conditions for her sentences.\nBy enriching compositional semantics in this way, generalized 2D\nsemantics promises a straightforward explanation of a variety of\nepistemic properties of sentences: e.g., why a necessary sentence like\n‘Hesperus is Phosphorus’ is not apriori knowable, what the\nsubject learns by accepting the sentence, or how the subject uses the\nsentence in reasoning. \nBut using the 2D framework to characterize the subject’s epistemic\nperspective is not beholden to this internalist project. Semantic\nexternalists reject the traditional view that our purely internal\nstates afford apriori access to reference-fixing conditions for our\nwords and thoughts. According to externalists, the basic assignments\nin a compositional semantics relate the subject’s words and thoughts\nto objective features of her environment—objects, kinds and\nproperties whose nature is captured by standard (1D) possible world\nsemantics. Even externalists, however, can define 2D matrices that\nreflect the subject’s epistemic perspective on the reference of her\nwords and thoughts. For the externalist, however, these 2D matrices\nwill not represent meanings—a specific aspect of\nunderstanding that is required for linguistic or conceptual competence\nand which figures in a compositional semantic theory that determines\ntruth-conditions for sentences. On an externalist interpretation, 2D\nmatrices merely reflect one aspect of a subject’s partial semantic\nunderstanding of what her words and thoughts represent. Because\nexternalist 2D matrices don’t represent meanings, moreover, the\nexternalist is free to use the 2D framework strategically to focus on\ndifferent aspects of the subject’s understanding for different\nexplanatory purposes. \nRobert Stalnaker has articulated such an externalist interpretation of\nthe 2D framework in a series of influential papers spanning some\nthirty years. He was the first to introduce 2D matrices to specify\nwhat is communicated in situations where conversational partners are\npartly ignorant or mistaken about the nature of the objects, kinds or\nproperties their words pick out (1978), and he later extended his 2D\nframework to characterize the content of certain thoughts and attitude\nattributions (1981; 1987; 1988). In both cases, the 2D framework is\nused to define “diagonal” intensions that reflect the\nsubject’s partial understanding of which objects, kinds or properties\nher words and thoughts represent. These diagonal intensions are not\nmeanings or semantic values, since they do not figure in a\ncompositional semantic theory and they do not reflect conditions for\nconceptual or linguistic competence. The only meaning of an expression\non this account is its ordinary “horizontal” intension. In\neffect, Stalnaker’s 2D matrices represent different meanings that an\nexpression could have had if it had occurred in different\nempirical circumstances. This “metasemantic”\ninterpretation of the 2D framework contrasts sharply the\n“semantic” interpretations favored by theorists like\nJackson and Chalmers (Stalnaker 2001, 2004). \nProponents of generalized 2D semantics were influenced by Stalnaker’s\nearly papers developing the 2D framework, and their views are often\npresented as continuous in motivation and form. But there are\nimportant theoretical consequences that flow from the choice between\n2D metasemantics and generalized 2D semantics. Indeed, Stalnaker\nhimself is a vocal critic of generalized 2D semantics, rejecting its\ncommitment to the semantic status of 2D matrices, its commitment to\napriori conceptual analysis, and its internalist approach to reference\ndetermination. \nThe metasemantic interpretation of the 2D framework was originally\ndeveloped as a way of explaining how the propositions conveyed by the\nassertion of a sentence can vary depending on the conversational\ncontext (Stalnaker 1978). In this seminal paper, Stalnaker proposes an\nattractive theoretical account of the role of assertion in a\nconversation, which is then used to explain how the assertoric use of\na necessary sentence like ‘Hesperus = Phosphorus’, can\nconvey a specific empirical proposition within a given conversation.\nIn particular, Stalnaker argues that our commitment to construing such\nsentences as making felicitous and informative assertions will lead us\nto reinterpret their content in ways that can be modeled\nusing the 2D framework. \nThe guiding idea is that in making an assertion the speaker is trying\nto get the audience to rule out certain possibilities. In asserting\n‘It’s cold today‘, for instance, I may be trying to get\nyou to rule out possibilities in which today’s temperature in\nMelbourne is over 10° C. We can model what my assertion conveys,\nthen, as a function that maps possible worlds in which today’s\ntemperature is under 10° C to True and all other worlds to False.\nHowever, the precise truth-conditions communicated by an assertoric\nuse of a sentence depend in part on the conversational context in\nwhich it takes place. Just which temperatures count as cold, for\ninstance, depends on shared background assumptions in a particular\nconversational context: what’s cold in Melbourne is mild in\nManitoba. \nA second guiding idea is that the proposition actually conveyed by the\nassertion of a particular sentence depends on presuppositions\nshared by the participants in the conversation—including\npresuppositions about what particular words represent and\npresuppositions about actual empirical circumstances. If you’re a\nChinese speaker who doesn’t understand anything at all about what the\nterm ‘cold’ represents in English, then I cannot use\n‘It’s cold today‘ to convey facts about Melbourne’s\nweather. And if you’re a Canadian who doesn’t understand anything\nabout Australian weather conditions, you won’t understand precisely\nwhat I am saying to my fellow Melburnians when I assert that sentence.\nStalnaker calls the set of presuppositions that conversational\npartners treat as common knowledge that they can rely on to get their\npoint across the “context set”—which he models as\nthe set of possible worlds that satisfy all of these mutual\npresuppositions. The context set will encode shared assumptions about\nthe meaning of words, about general empirical facts, about the what’s\nhappened so far in the conversation, and so on. \nThe goal of assertion, Stalnaker suggests, is to shrink the context\nset. In making an assertion, the speaker tries to get the audience to\naccept a new proposition as one of their shared presuppositions,\nthereby shrinking the set of possible worlds that are considered live\noptions. For instance, in asserting ‘It’ll be very cold\ntoday’ to a group of Melburnians, I exploit background knowledge\nof local weather conditions in June to get my audience to accept that\nthe temperature outside is somewhere between 5–10° C, ruling\nout live possibilities that it might be in the 15–20° C\nrange. If all goes well, further planning will proceed on the basis of\na smaller and more accurate range of possibilities. In contrast, if I\nwere to assert ‘It’s cold’ to the monolingual Chinese\nspeaker or to the parochial Canadian, my assertion would be defective,\nsince my audience wouldn’t be able to figure out which temperatures\nare ruled out by my assertion. \nIdentity claims, however, do not seem to fit this simple model of\nassertion. As Kripke (1980) argued, identities are either necessarily\ntrue or necessarily false. So accepting an identity will either leave\nthe context set unchanged or it will eliminate it altogether. Either\nway, asserting an identity would be pointless. But clearly it is not.\nAsserting an identity such as ‘Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone’\ncan be genuinely informative, ruling out empirical possibilities\npreviously taken to be live options. According to the metasemantic\naccount, (i) the goal of assertion can explain why the assertion of a\nnecessary sentence will lead to a reinterpretation of the content of\nthe asserted sentence, and (ii) the 2D framework helps to specify just\nwhich proposition will be conveyed by the sentence within a given\nconversation. \nIn general, an identity claim is appropriate when one of the parties\nto a conversation is (partially) ignorant about which object is picked\nout by a name like ‘Lloyd’. For an externalist like\nStalnaker, this is a case of semantic ignorance. If O’Leary\ndoesn’t know that ‘Lloyd’ is co-referential with\n‘I.L. Humberstone’, then he does not fully understand the\nsemantic rules governing these names: i.e., that both names are\nassociated with a constant function from any possible world to a\nspecific individual. But O’Leary isn’t utterly incompetent with the\nmeaning of these terms: he implicitly understands both names as rigid\ndesignators, and he has some substantive understanding of the object\neach name picks out. For instance, he may understand that\n‘Lloyd’ refers to the person to whom he’s just been\nintroduced and that ‘I.L. Humberstone’ refers to the\nauthor of ‘Direction of Fit’. O’Leary’s semantic\ndeficiency—his failure to fully understand the meaning of these\nnames in a contextually appropriate way—is grounded in his\nignorance of the ordinary empirical fact that the man to whom he has\nbeen introduced is the author of ‘Direction of Fit’. \n2D matrices can be used to represent this sort of partial semantic\nunderstanding. O’Leary knows that \\(if\\) the man in front of him\nis the author of the famous article, then ‘Lloyd = I.L.\nHumberstone’ expresses a necessary truth; and he knows that\n\\(if\\) the man in front of him isn’t the author, the sentence\nexpresses a necessary falsehood. What O’Leary doesn’t know is which of\nthese two possibilities corresponds to his actual situation. Call the\nfirst possibility \\(i\\) and the second \\(j\\). O’Leary’s\nepistemic situation can then be summed up in a 2D matrix: \nThe matrix is defined only with respect to a specific set of relevant\nalternative possibilities, \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), chosen in such a way\nas to reflect the subjects’ semantic understanding and our own\nexplanatory interests. The vertical axis represents these possible\nworlds in their role as contexts of use, which determine the\nliteral semantic content of the expressions used in them. The\nhorizontal axis represents those same possible worlds as\ncircumstances of evaluation, relative to which we evaluate\nthe truth or falsity of the proposition expressed. Each row of the\nmatrix thus represents a different proposition that might be literally\nexpressed by the sentence. Stalnaker calls such matrices\npropositional concepts, since they reflect the subject’s\ncurrent imperfect conception of the meaning of the\n sentence.[22]\n This particular matrix reflects the fact that O’Leary’s current\nepistemic state is compatible with the identity sentence expressing\neither a necessary truth or a necessary falsehood, depending on\nempirical facts about the actual context of use. \nWhat does O’Leary learn when he comes to accept Daniels’ assertion of\n‘Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone’? Since the actual world is\nlike \\(i\\), the literal semantic content of the asserted sentence\nis a necessary truth. But necessary truths rule out no empirical\npossibilities whatsoever, so this cannot be the informative\nproposition that is conveyed by Daniels’ assertion. Moreover, O’Leary\nis not in a position to recognize that this is the literal semantic\ncontent of the sentence, since he doesn’t know whether the actual\nworld is like \\(i\\) or \\(j\\). The natural suggestion is that the\ninformation conveyed by Daniels’ assertion is that the real world is\nlike \\(i\\) and not \\(j\\). When O’Leary accepts ‘Lloyd is\nI.L. Humberstone’, he will no longer treat the possibility that\nthe man in front of him is not the author of the famous\narticle as a live option: this empirical possibility will be\neliminated from his context set. Thus, the proposition that seems to\nbe conveyed by Daniels’ assertion corresponds to the diagonal\nintension determined by our 2D matrix for that assertion. Moreover,\nthis observation generalizes: when subjects are partially ignorant of\nthe semantic values of their words, the diagonal proposition\ndetermined by the propositional concept can capture the empirical\ninformation conveyed by the assertion. \nBut why is this so? To explain why assertions sometimes express the\ndiagonal proposition, the metasemantic account appeals to rational\nmaxims governing conversational cooperation. The following maxim seems\nto govern the practice of assertion: \nSpeakers should conform to this maxim, because assertion involves an\nintention to get one’s audience to eliminate worlds from the context\nset in accordance with the proposition expressed—and in order\nfor this intention to succeed the audience must be in a position to\nfigure out just which worlds they are being asked to eliminate. When\nthis sort of rational maxim governing the communication of information\nis flouted, the audience will look for a non-standard interpretation\nof the utterance that would bring it back into conformity with the\nmaxims (Grice 1989). [See the entries on\n pragmatics\n and on\n implicature.] \nAccording to Stalnaker, this is precisely what is going on in the case\nof identity claims like the one we have been considering. Daniels’\nassertion of ‘Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone’ clearly flouts\nthe proposed maxim. We can assume that Daniels is aware that O’Leary\ndoesn’t know whether he is in a world like \\(i\\), where the man to\nwhom he’s been introduced is the famous author, or a world like j\nwhere they are distinct. Yet Daniels utters a sentence that expresses\na different proposition depending on whether the actual world is like\n\\(i\\) or like \\(j\\). In such circumstances, the audience should\nlook for an alternative interpretation of the assertion. Daniels’\nassertion can be brought back into conformity with the maxim by\nre-interpreting it as conveying the proposition expressed by the\ndiagonal of the matrix. At a rough intuitive level, we can say that\nDaniels is trying to get O’Leary to accept that the sentence\n‘Lloyd is I.L. Humberstone’ expresses a truth. But the 2D\nframework also allows us to specify more precisely just what empirical\ninformation is conveyed within a given conversational context. Given\nO’Leary’s and Daniels’ common presuppositions about what the two names\nrepresent, Daniels’ assertion also expresses the proposition that\nthe man to whom O’Leary has just been introduced is the author of\n‘Direction of Fit’. \nIt’s worth emphasizing, however, that the very same sentence asserted\nin a different conversational context could express an entirely\ndifferent empirical proposition: just which proposition is expressed,\non this metasemantic account, depends on what the individual parties\nto the conversation are currently presupposing about the meanings of\nthe expressions used. \nIn recent work, Stalanaker has enriched his notion of a context. In\naddition to a sets of possible worlds, he introduces (i) multiple\ncenters within those worlds representing the participants in a\nconversation, and (ii) accessibility relations among the centers\nrepresenting interlocutors’ ways of identifying each other\n(Stalnaker 2008, 2014). This added structure is intended to capture\nself-locating presuppositions that can help explain what’s\ncommunicated by indexical expressions like ‘I’,\n‘you’ and ‘now’. For a helpful overview of the\nmotivation for such an approach, see (Ninan 2010a) and for further\ndevelopment of multi-centered accounts of propositional content see\n(Torre 2010, Ninan 2013).  \nThe metasemantic 2D framework was originally developed to explain\ncommunication, but the framework can also be used to specify the\ncontent of certain beliefs and the content of assertions that\nattribute beliefs. \nStalnaker (1984) defends a coarse-grained account of belief contents,\nwhich individuates particular belief states in terms of a set of\npossible worlds that would make them true. If this project is to\nsucceed, it must be possible to fully specify beliefs without invoking\nanything like Fregean senses or conceptual structure. But there is an\nimportant class of beliefs that seem to pose insuperable problems for\na simple possible worlds account of their content: beliefs in\nnecessary truths. The problem for a standard possible worlds analysis\nis that all necessary truths have precisely the same content (the\nfunction mapping every world to True). So on a simple possible worlds\naccount, the belief that Hesperus = Phosphorus will have\nexactly the same content as a belief that Hesperus = Hesperus\n& Fermat’s last theorem is true. But these are clearly\ndistinct belief states. Beliefs in identities have been particularly\nimportant in motivating theories of finer-grained thought\ncontents. \nBut fine-grained Fregean senses or conceptual structures are not\nstrictly required to distinguish beliefs in identities. Stalnaker\n(1981; 1987) argues that the metasemantic 2D framework he developed to\nexplain what is communicated by an assertion of an identity\nsentence can also explain the content of the belief states\nattributed using an identity sentence to specify its content. If\nO’Leary were to notice the pole star and think to himself that’s\nMars, for instance, the truth-conditions of his thought can be\ncaptured by a judiciously defined diagonal proposition (Stalnaker\n1987, 125). In this case, the worlds we include in the context set may\ninvolve facts about which object is the target of O’Leary’s visual\nattention and facts about salient empirical properties he associates\nwith the name ‘Mars’. On the metasemantic approach, then,\nthe proposition we attribute in saying O’Leary believes that that\nis Mars is the proposition that the visually salient object is\nthe object that has those Martian properties. \nA further complication arises in specifying the content of attitude\nattributions. On the metasemantic account of assertion, the content\nconveyed by a sentence depends on the shared presuppositions of the\nspeaker and audience. But sometimes the parties to a discussion are\nbetter informed than the person they are describing. In philosophical\ndiscussions, for instance, it is standardly presupposed that\n‘Hesperus’ and ‘Phosphorus’ are\nco-referential. So the diagonal intension associated with sentence\n‘Hesperus \\(\\ne\\) Phosphorus’ will be necessarily\nfalse when it’s asserted in philosophical contexts (i.e., it will\nbe false when uttered in any situation compatible with what is being\npresupposed in the philosophical conversation). And yet when a\nphilosopher says that O’Leary doesn’t know that Hesperus is\nPhosphorus, she still manages to communicate that O’Leary fails to\ngrasp some contingent empirical proposition. On the face of it, the\nmetasemantic account of assertion cannot explain how this is possible,\nsince every cell of the metasemantic matrix for the sentence in this\nphilosophical conversation will be assigned the value True. \nStalnaker’s response to this problem is to suggest that the context\nset for a belief report must be expanded so as to include worlds that\ncorrespond to the way that the believer himself (i.e. O’Leary) takes\nthings to be. The diagonal proposition of the philosopher’s sentence\nis thus determined by considering what she would be saying if her\nsentence were asserted in contexts compatible with O’Leary’s beliefs\n(1987; 1988). However, there is no general rule for choosing which\nworlds are the relevant ones: \nThus, the metasemantic 2D framework provides adequate descriptive\nresources for characterizing mental states and our discourse about\nthem, without invoking fine-grained Fregean senses, concepts, or\nsyntactic structures. However, the metasemantic theory used to\nconstruct the relevant 2D matrices relies on unsystematic norms of\ncharitable interpretation to identify the precise contents of\nparticular attitudes and attitude reports (Stalnaker 1999b,\n 18–19).[23] \nThe semantic vs. metasemantic distinction was first drawn by Kaplan\n(1989b, 573–6). A semantic theory for a language assigns semantic\nvalues (meanings) to particular expressions in the language. In\ncontrast, a metasemantic theory explains why expressions have\nthose semantic values: i.e., what facts about an expression make it\nthe case that it has a certain meaning. A semantic theory, for\ninstance, might tell us that the semantic value for ‘Barack\nObama’ is a 1D intension that maps any possible world to a\nspecific individual, while the semantic value for ‘I’ is a\n2D intension that maps contexts of utterance to a constant function\nfrom any possible world to the individual who is the speaker in the\ncontext. A metasemantic theory will tell us what makes it the case\nthat these are the correct interpretations of their meaning: e.g., the\nmetasemantic theory might appeal to the speaker’s dispositions and\nhistory, how she is causally connected to her social or physical\ncontext, the linguistic conventions of the local linguistic community,\ndetails about the conversational context, and so on. \nA semantic interpretation of the 2D framework takes the 2D\nframework to specify a semantic value of an expression. Kaplan’s\ntheory of indexicals is a semantic interpretation of the framework, as\nare Jackson’s and Chalmers’ generalized 2D semantics. Stalnaker calls\nhis own interpretation of the 2D framework a metasemantic one\nbecause his 2D matrices reflect general principles for assigning\nsemantic values (horizontal intensions) to expressions on the basis of\nempirical facts about their use. Stalnaker’s 2D matrices thus reflect\nmetasemantic facts about interpretation, not semantic facts about the\nmeanings of specific expressions. \nThe metasemantic interpretation of the 2D framework is structurally\ndifferent from semantic interpretations like Jackson’s and Chalmers’\nin a number of important respects. First, on the metasemantic\napproach, 2D matrices are defined in terms of a restricted set of\npossible worlds. Metasemantic 2D matrices are defined only with\nrespect to those worlds that are consistent with some relevant set of\nthe subject’s background assumptions. On a semantic interpretation, in\ncontrast, 2D matrices are defined on the set of all centered\npossible worlds. \nSecond, just which set of possible worlds is used to construct a\nmetasemantic 2D matrix depends in part on the theorist’s\ncontingent explanatory interests. For instance, Daniels’ current\ninternal state of understanding the expression ‘Mars’ may\nbe associated with different 2D matrices, depending on whether we are\ninterested in characterizing his conversation with O’Leary or in\ncharacterizing his thought identifying a speck visible in the night\nsky as Mars. In many contexts, moreover, we can characterize the\ncontent associated with Daniels’ internal state without resorting to\nthe 2D apparatus at all: e.g., when Daniels asserts ‘Mars is a\nplanet’ we can usually model what he says and thinks in terms of\na simple horizontal intension. Semantic interpretations of the 2D\nframework treat the intension corresponding to the diagonal of a 2D\nmatrix as fully determined by the subject’s internal states, whereas\non a metasemantic approach which diagonal intension is\nassigned—or whether a diagonal intension is invoked at\nall—depends on the explanatory interests of an\n interpreter.[24] \nThird, the assignment principle used to fill in a metasemantic 2D\nmatrix for a subject’s words is not beholden to an internalist account\nof reference-fixing. On a semantic interpretation, 2D matrices are\nfilled in on the basis of the subject’s idealized judgments about\nhypothetical scenarios. But the metasemantic approach is not committed\nto relying on the subject’s epistemic judgments to fill in 2D\nmatrices: it’s the theorist who must be able to assign\nhorizontal intensions to the subject’s words and thoughts on the basis\nof the totality of empirical facts about her. Nor should we think of\nreference-fixing as somehow determined by the internal states of the\ntheorist, since even theorists are prone to mistakes on externalist\naccounts of reference-fixing. \nFourth, on the metasemantic approach, the basic semantic assignments\nare always horizontal intensions, which reflect the nature of the\nobjects, kinds and properties the subject is thinking and talking\nabout. On a metasemantic account, diagonal intensions represent ad\nhoc reinterpretations that we resort to when the normal\nhorizontal intension for a subject’s sentences or thoughts is\nnecessarily true or necessarily false, and hence makes no substantive\nclaim about the empirical world. Such diagonal intensions, moreover,\nare theoretical abstractions derived from a set of horizontal\nintensions that are compatible with the subject’s partial ignorance\nabout nature of the objects, kinds, and properties she is representing\n(i.e., her partial ignorance of the horizontal intensions for her\nwords and thoughts). Semantic interpretations of the 2D framework, in\ncontrast, treat the intensions picked out by the diagonal of a 2D\nmatrix as basic semantic values in their own right. \nAs a consequence of these structural features of the metasemantic\ninterpretation, metasemantic diagonal intensions play none of the\nbasic explanatory roles attributed to 1-intensions by proponents of\ngeneralized 2D semantics. In particular, (i) diagonal intensions do\nnot figure in a compositional semantic theory, (ii) they do not\nreflect stable aspects of linguistic or conceptual competence, and\n(iii) they do not represent apriori accessible reference-fixing\nconditions for the subject’s words or thoughts (Stalnaker 1999b, 2004\n, 2007). \nThe metasemantic interpretation uses the 2D possible worlds framework\nin an ad hoc, context-sensitive way to isolate certain aspects\nof a subject’s understanding that are not captured by standard\npossible worlds semantics. This metasemantic project can be challenged\non a number of different fronts. \nFirst, one might object to the account of how metasemantic diagonal\npropositions are generated for particular assertions. The account\ndeveloped in ‘Assertion’ relies on Gricean norms for\nfelicitous communication to identify an empirical proposition\nexpressed by a necessary sentence. However, Gricean mechanisms may not\ndetermine the intuitively correct semantic assignments (e.g., Brehany\n2006). Indeed, some critics argue the diagonalization strategy may\nfail to determine any semantic assignment at all, because of its\ncommitment to transparent mutual knowledge of the context (Hawthorne\nand Madigor 2009; see (Stalnaker 2009) for a reply). More generally,\nStalnaker emphasizes that his primary commitment is not to specific\nGricean mechanisms for assigning diagonal intensions to assertions,\nbut rather to the idea that possible worlds semantics can fully\ncapture the content of thought and talk and how it evolves through\nconversation and inquiry (Stalnaker 2014). \nSecond, one might challenge the background assumption that\none-dimensional possible world semantics, with its coarse-grained\nrepresentation of truth-conditions as functions mapping possible\nworlds to truth-values, is the best way to characterize the content of\nlanguage and thought. Stalnaker introduces the 2D framework in order\nto address cases that are problematic for standard possible world\nsemantics: the assertion of necessary truths and certain types of\nattitude reports. But many theorists contend that functions from\nworlds to truth-values cannot fully capture the content of thought and\ntalk. For instance, we may need to invoke finer-grained syntactic or\nconceptual structures (i) to explain what is said when we report the\ncontent of a person’s words or thoughts (e.g., Crimmins 1992; Richard\n1990), (ii) to capture apparent differences in content between\nlogically equivalent claims (“the problem of logical\nomniscience”), (iii) to account for our ability to think de\nre thoughts about particular objects (Soames 2005, ch. 5; 2006a;\n2006b), (iv) to capture the subject’s understanding of her own\nlocation within the world (“the problem of the essential\nindexical”) (Perry 1979, 2006), or (v) to capture the subject’s\nperspective on sameness of subject matter (Perry, 1980; Kaplan 1990;\nFine 2007). Even if the metasemantic approach has the resources to\ndescribe these phenomena, critics may question whether it provides the\nbest, most perspicuous explanation of mental and linguistic\n content.[25]\n [See the entries on\n structured propositions,\n situation semantics, and\n propositional attitude reports.]\n The addition of multi-centered possible worlds for keeping track of\nconversational dynamics and thought content may help address some of\nthese worries (Stalnaker 2008, 2014; Torre 2010; Ninan 2013).  \nThird, proponents of generalized 2D semantics challenge the idea that\nthere is a principled distinction between semantic theories and\nmetasemantic theories. Perhaps the distinction is merely a verbal\ndispute over whether the 2D matrices assigned to a person’s words and\nthoughts deserve the name ‘semantic’ (Chalmers 1996, ch.2\n§4; Jackson 2006; Lewis 1981). Stalnaker himself holds that the\ndistinction is a theoretically important one that has implications for\ncompositional semantic theory and apriori knowledge of\ntruth-conditions. This dispute between 2D metasemantics and\ngeneralized 2D semantics may ultimately turn on whether one accepts an\nexternalist or an internalist account of metasemantics—i.e.,\nwhether the subject’s purely internal states fully determine how the\nextension of her words and thoughts is fixed. Proponents of\ngeneralized 2D semantics hold that the individual’s own cognitive\ndispositions suffice to fix the propositional content of her words and\nthoughts. In contrast, Stalnaker holds that the propositional content\nof language and thought depends in part on external facts to which\nsubjects have no privileged apriori access and it varies according to\ncontingent explanatory interests. \nIn his recent book, Context (2014), Stalnaker focuses on the\nnature of common ground, context, the dynamics of conversation –\nissues that are central to his metasemantic interpretation of the\ntwo-dimensional framework. For a helpful author-meets-critics\ndiscussion of his current views and the prospects for extending them,\nsee (Camp forthcoming, Greene forthcoming, Szabó forthcoming,\nStalnaker forthcoming).
