He worked as a statistician\nfrom 1927–31, became a Lecturer in Economics at the University\nof Vienna in 1929, then moved to the University of London in 1931, the\nUniversity of Chicago in 1950, and the University of Freiburg in 1962,\nretiring in 1967. He kept writing into the 1980s, dying in 1992.\n\n\nHayek worked in the areas of philosophy of science, political\nphilosophy, the free will problem, and epistemology. For all that,\nHayek was more hedgehog than fox. His life’s work, for which he\nwon a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, illuminated the nature and\nsignificance of spontaneous order. The concept seems simple, yet Hayek\nspent six decades refining his idea, evidently finding elusive the\ngoal of being as clear about it as he aspired to be.\n\n\nThis essay concentrates on this enduring theme of Hayek’s work,\nand a question: why would the scholar who did more than anyone in the\ntwentieth century to advance our understanding of price signals and\nthe emergence of spontaneous orders also be driven to claim\n“that social justice is a mirage” (Hayek 1978b, 57)?\n\nOver hundreds of millions of years, order emerged in the natural\nworld. How? It is only human to wonder. “Design arguments”\ncome to mind, but like most philosophers, Hayek considers such\narguments fallacious as arguments that we need to posit a designer to\nexplain the emergence of order in nature. (See the entry on\n teleological arguments for God’s existence.)\n Hayek, however, was frustrated to find the same fallacy in arguments\nthat we need to posit a designer to explain the emergence of order in\nsociety (Hayek 1960, 59). \nJust as no one had to invent natural selection, no one had to invent\nthe process by which natural languages evolve. A language is a\nmassively path-dependent process of unending mutual adjustment.\nLanguage evolves spontaneously. It would make no sense to call any\nlanguage optimally efficient, but it does make sense to see languages\nas highly refined and effective adaptations to the evolving\ncommunication needs of particular populations (Hayek 1945, 528). \nIt would be no exaggeration to say that social theory begins\nwith—and has an object only because of—the discovery that\nthere exist orderly structures which are the product of the action of\nmany men but are not the result of human design. In some fields this\nis now universally accepted. Although there was a time when men\nbelieved that even language and morals had been invented by some\ngenius of the past, everybody recognizes now that they are the outcome\nof a process of evolution whose results nobody foresaw or designed\n(Hayek 1973, 37). \nNatural selection operates on mutations, making the path of natural\nselection unpredictable, regardless of how well we understand the\nunderlying principles. To Hayek, social and cultural evolution are\nmuch the same: driven by innovation, fashion, and various shocks that\n“mutate” people’s plans in unpredictable ways with\nunpredictable results. The system may be more or less logical. Most\nthings seem in retrospect to have happened for a reason. Yet, however\nlogical the system may be, its logic does not render the system\ndeterministic. We can make predictions in the broadest sense, such as\nwhen we say that increasing the money supply causes prices to rise,\nother things equal, but we have no basis for predicting the fine\ndetails. The system is technically chaotic, to such a degree that even\nsomething as straightforward as next week’s stock prices will\nalways remain a matter of guesswork even for experts. (See the entry\non\n chaos.) \nTo Hayek, prices are like languages. How do we know what it will take\nto get our product to whomever wants or needs it most? Maybe we take\nbids. As we (and our rivals) take bids for x, x\ncomes to have a price. As with language, prices enable people to form\nmutual expectations. Free-floating prices help people coordinate in\nintricate and mutually considerate ways as they individually decide\nwhat to produce or consume. To think that an authority needs to decide\nwhat the price of rice ought to be is like thinking that an authority\nneeds to decide what sound people should make when they want to refer\nto rice. \nIt is a mundane yet intriguing fact that price signals induce people\nto respond to information they do not possess: such as the changing\ncost of drilling, or the discovery of a cheap substitute, or that\npolitical unrest has made a key input harder to acquire. Having no\ninkling of those variables, buyers nevertheless respond to them in a\nrational way, because they know the one thing they need to know:\nnamely, the price (Hayek 1978a, 4). \nAssume that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of\nsome raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of\nsupply of tin has been eliminated. It does not matter for our\npurpose—and it is very significant that it does not\nmatter—which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All\nthat the users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used\nto consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in\nconsequence, they must economize tin (Hayek 1945, 526). \nWhat emerges from the haggling is not only a deal, but something\nlarger: a community. There was no central decision about who should\nproduce tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision about who\nshould consume tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision\nabout what should be given in return for tin. All that happened is\nthat some people guessed that if they were to produce tin and bring it\nto market, it would be worth something to customers—enough to\nmake the venture worthwhile. When some of these guesses prove correct\nand trades are consummated, a market in tin emerges and becomes part\nof what brings people together as partners in mutually beneficial\nventures. \nPrice signals thus economize on information. In the process,\nthey induce patterns of cooperation that involve multitudes.\nCooperation evolves among people who need not share a language, need\nnot be aware of each other’s existence, and need not be aware of\ntheir mutual dependence. They are only vaguely aware of the thousands\nof jobs that need doing so as to supply inputs that enable them to\nhave a finished product to sell. Particular agents seldom if ever have\nmore than a glimpse of the big picture, yet they manage to come\ntogether to form a community, and almost all are vastly better off as\na result. \nTechnological progress extends the frontiers of the possible. To\nHayek, it is the freedom of the few to do something novel that matters\nmost, not the freedom of the many to do something familiar.\nAccordingly, the freedom I exercise myself often is not the freedom\nthat has the most bearing on my future (Hayek 1960, 32). Consider that\nearly adopters finance research that brings down production costs and\nthus finances a dispersion of products and services at falling prices\nthat eventually bring late adopters like me to the market. I may never\ntrade with early adopters, yet even so I depend on them, for they help\nto finance the invention and ongoing re-invention of products whose\nmarginal cost eventually falls to a point where I can afford them. \nOften, technological progress consists of innovations that lower\ntransaction cost: steam boat, railroad, air travel, telegraph,\ntelephone, internet, bar code reader, “apps” that make\npossible such businesses as Uber and AirBnB, along with innovative\norganizational structures and business models such as Federal Express\nor container ships (which, after a ten-year legal battle with trade\nunions, reduced from days to minutes the time that a truck’s\ncontents would spend at the dockyard before being transferred to a\nship). In many cases, the cost of transacting concerns the cost of\ninformation. As the frontier of knowledge expands, the slice that a\ngiven individual can grasp inevitably becomes a smaller fraction of\nthe whole. Prices become an increasingly indispensable window to a\nworld of tacit knowledge. \nIn summary, technological innovation shocks economies. Formerly\nprofitable investments become relics of a bygone age and must be\nliquidated. Workers get laid off until they find some other way to\nproduce goods wanted by today’s customers. Transitions are\ntough, miscalculations abound, but the upshot is that we grope toward\nheights made possible by a given innovation. Innovative ways of\nlowering transaction cost spread throughout a community, and failures\n(including once-useful but now obsolete innovations) are discarded.\nMore precisely, failures are discarded if and when decision makers are\ninnovators on the ground, learning to avoid losing their own money on\nideas that fail to bear fruit in a given time and place. \nHayek denies that resources will ever be used at theoretical peak\nefficiency (1945, 527). Humans being what they are, waste is\nubiquitous. Mistakes are ubiquitous. The “marvel” of\nmarkets is that people make mistakes, get burnt, learn fast, and make\ncorrections. By contrast, if decision makers are bureaucrats in large\norganizations, their focus is not on avoiding mistakes but on avoiding\nbudget cuts. If bureaucrats acknowledge that their plan is failing,\nthe consequences is not that they retrench and divert their own\nresources to better purposes but that their supervisors cut their\nbudgets. Note: what cuts their budget is not the mistake so much as\nsomeone learning from the mistake. Bureaucratic structure makes new\ninformation a threat that needs to be suppressed, or smothered in\npropaganda (1944, 126ff, 153ff). \nBureaucrats and their expert advisors experience mistakes not as\nevents from which they need to learn but rather as events that they\nneed to cover up. Their mistakes are with other people’s money,\nso bureaucrats learn to say with a straight face, when confronted,\nthat their budget was not large enough, or that things would have been\nworse without their\n policies.[1]\n They may even believe what they are saying, but they do not know and\nhave every incentive to avoid learning. \nIf we understand the principles that drive the logic of the system, we\nmay be able to predict that a population of insects will evolve\nresistance to a pesticide. We may be able to predict that a society\nthat declares war on drugs will lose. Beyond the question of what we\ncan predict, then, Hayek has a further and more precise target:\nhowever much we can predict, there is a drastic limit to what we can\nsimply\n decide.[2]\n No one can decide that people won’t respond in predictable ways\nto perverse incentives unintentionally created by a central plan, in\nthe same way that no one can decide that insects will not become\nresistant to an insecticide. \nThis point, as Adam Smith observed, is not obvious. There is a class\nof technocrats who will not appreciate the difficulty. As Smith\nfamously observed, and as Hayek quotes approvingly, the “man of\nsystem”  \nseems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great\nsociety with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces\nupon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the\nchess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the\nhand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human\nsociety, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own,\naltogether different from that which the legislature might choose to\nimpress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same\ndirection, the game of human society will go on easily and\nharmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they\nare opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the\nsociety must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder (Smith\n1790, 234). \nThe system has a logic. Planners cannot change that logic. Their main\ndecision is whether to work with that logic or against it (which Smith\nregards as a choice between harmony and misery). Smith holds that\nplanners who disregard economic logic are deciding in effect to\nsacrifice their “pawns,” something that a person of true\nbenevolence would not do. \nWhen Hayek explains the obstacle to effective central planning, his\nclaim is not merely the Smithian point that information is widely\ndispersed and therefore hard to acquire. Rather, it is impossible to\nacquire (Hayek 1973, 51). When prices are set periodically by a\ncentral planner, rather than instantaneously by consumers and\nproducers who are the first and typically the only people to have that\ninformation in reliable and timely form, prices inevitably carry less\nreliable, less timely information. As Hayek notes, \nIf we possess all the relevant information, if we can start out from a\ngiven system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of\navailable means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic.\nThat is, the answer to the question of what is the best use of our\navailable means is implicit in our assumptions. This, however, is\nemphatically not the economic problem which society faces. And the\neconomic calculus which we have developed to solve this logical\nproblem, though an important step toward the solution of the economic\nproblem of society, does not yet provide an answer to it. The reason\nfor this is that the “data” from which the economic\ncalculus starts are never for the whole society “given” to\na single mind which could work out the implications and can never be\nso given (Hayek 1945, 519). \nSoviet central planners made decisions by checking prices on\ninternational markets, but suppose there were no information about\nsupply and demand to be had anywhere. Suppose you are a planner, but\nall you know is that demands are coming in for wire and for jewelry.\nHow do you decide whether to direct factories to make wire out of\ncopper or platinum, or whether smiths should make jewelry out of gold\nor silver? How do you decide who should get silver jewelry and who\nshould get gold? How do you decide whether anyone at all should get\njewelry, as opposed to reserving all such metals for use as wire? \nWhen consumers are not paying for what they receive, their demand is\neffectively infinite. Inevitably, a central planner’s task\nbecomes one of cost containment. Worse yet, a planner with no measure\nof cost has only a limited basis for deciding what to count as\ncontaining cost. If a given ton of steel can make one car or ten\nrefrigerators, which way of using steel is economical? How does a\nplanner decide whether to invest in upgrading water supplies or\nnuclear reactors? If all you know as a producer is that people are\nasking for infinitely more than you can give, then eventually you turn\na deaf ear, deliver your quota, and pay no attention to whether\ndemands from below (from customers) are being met. The only demands\nthat have consequences are demands from above (that is, those which\ncome to you through your supervisors). \nSuppose that prices are set by planners. Hayek says with a thought\nmore characteristic of neoclassical economists: “Only prices\ndetermined on the free market will bring it about that demand equals\nsupply” (Hayek 1960, 63). Price controls—floors and\nceilings—make buyers and sellers less able to respond to the\nsignals they would send each other if they could raise their offer or\nlower their asking price. If price cannot rise, then buyers cannot\nsignal producers that demand has increased and that producers would\nsell more if they were to increase supply. And if producers do not\nincrease supply, rising demand results in shortages rather than\neconomic growth. (See especially Zwolinski 2008 for further\n elaboration.)[3] \nA central planner could have the world’s most powerful computer,\nbeyond anything imagined when Hayek published “Use of\nKnowledge” in 1945. No computer, however, could solve the\nproblem that Hayek was trying to articulate. The problem is not lack\nof processing power so much as a lack of access to the information in\nthe first place. That much seems clear enough, but the problem has a\ndeeper level. Hayek may not have said this in so many words, yet it\nseems the most charitable way of reconstructing his more fundamental\npoint. That is, the problem is not merely lack of access to\ninformation; rather the information does not exist. There is no truth\nabout what prices should be, accessible or otherwise, except to the\nextent that prices represent what customers are paying for a given\nservice. This is the precise way in which prices are of service to a\ncommunity (1944, 51–52). \nFor example, suppose that a manufacturer figures out how to make an\n“epipen” that can save the lives of consumers otherwise at\nrisk of fatal allergic reaction to bee stings. Suppose the\nmanufacturer can produce a limited supply of epipens for a little less\nthan a hundred dollars each, and proceeds to offer them for sale for a\nhundred dollars. Suppose that the manufacturer finds that buyers line\nup by the thousands wanting to buy the pens, and suppose that there\nemerges a group of “scalpers” willing to stand in line for\nweeks, who buy all the pens for a hundred dollars each, then resell\nthe pens for two hundred dollars, then three hundred, then four, and\ndemand remains strong. Hayek would predict that if we let the price\nsignals be the marvels that they are, then other producers will jump\nin and begin to manufacture pens for one or two hundred dollars each.\nEventually the demand is met, and the scalpers go away. Meanwhile, new\nproducers drawn by the spike in profitability invent a new process\nthat enables them to produce the pens for ninety dollars, then eighty,\nand again the price will fall, as competition leads the price signal\nto track the falling cost of production. Of course, if we issue a\npatent or a licensing scheme or some other way of preventing rival\nproducers from entering the market, then this will not occur. By the\nsame token, if we impose a price ceiling of a hundred dollars, then no\nsignal is sent to prospective rivals, unless scalpers send the signal\nto rivals willing to produce for the black market. Or if there is some\nother reason why it is impossible to increase the supply, then prices\nmay drift up toward the limits of a customer’s willingness to\npay. Barring this, there are many ways for kings, legislators, or\nother planners to interfere, but price signals, if left alone, are an\ninimitably rapid and incomprehensibly vast generator of information:\nsupply and demand tend to equilibrate, and to converge on a price in\nthe neighborhood of the cost of production. To a uniquely reliable\ndegree, a product will tend to end up in a consumer’s hands just\nin case that particular consumer wants the product enough to pay what\nit cost to produce it.  \nAlthough computers cannot solve the problem, Hayek thought radically\ndispersed decision making by buyers and sellers can and does solve the\nproblem, so far as it can be solved. Sellers who charge too much end\nup without customers; they learn to be more efficient or else find\nsome other line of work.\n [4]\n Buyers who want x but consider it overpriced stay home for a\nwhile, waiting for the price to fall, but when they see x\nflying off the shelves, some of them learn something about themselves:\nthat they would rather have the product at that price than not have it\nat all. To Hayek, only a price mechanism can process changing\ninformation almost instantaneously. Ironically, the most\nefficient thing a central planner could possibly do would be to set a\nprice right where it would have been without the planner’s\nintervention. \nInsofar as society is a cooperative venture for mutual advantage,\nlearning to survive—not just physically but as full members of a\ncommunity—will involve learning to cooperate. Learning to\ncooperate involves learning to become a trading partner. In other\nwords, cooperation begins with having something to offer: a way of\nmaking people better off. \nClearly in Smith, who inspired Hayek, but also in Hayek himself, one\ninfers that the driving motivation is not greed or even well-being so\nmuch as a propensity to truck and barter, where this deal-making is\nnot only a means to an end but somehow also something we do for its\nown sake, because making deals is what our kind of social animal was\nborn to do. Neither, Hayek thought, is the objective for buyers and\nsellers to coordinate on a price that a central planner might\nstumble on, but to coordinate, period. Mutually satisfying\ncoordination, the ongoing equilibration of supply and demand,\nconstantly evolving in response to changing conditions, is itself the\nachievement. There is no need for that coordination to be tracking\nanything beyond itself. To Hayek, the value that we hope to see\nrealized in a marketplace is not so much that the correct volume of\ngoods gets exchanged at the correct price. Rather, the genesis and\npoint of the division of labor is not only a prospect of realizing\ngains from trade but trade per se. The valued result is buyers and\nsellers responding to each other, becoming more attuned to what people\naround them want, and helping to create a community in which their\nrole in an important one. \nSuch sensitivity is good, but there is little that central planners\ncan do to encourage it. Central planners replace what could be a\ncomplex, decentralized network of interdependence and mutual\nresponsibility with something more like a society of spokes tethered\nto a central distributor at the hub but otherwise dangling. It is no\nsubstitute for real community. \nIn nature, for biological adaptation to culminate in better-adapted\npopulations over time, the niche to which a population is adapting\nmust be relatively stable. Likewise, under a rule of law, the aim of\ngovernment is not to win but to provide a stable ecological niche that\nenables the game’s true players to evolve strategies apt for\nsuccess within that niche. An elaborate crystal structure cannot form\nunless the medium in which crystals form is left undisturbed.\nHayek’s ideal is a legal “medium” of society,\nliberal enough to permit creativity, stable enough\nto reward creativity, and constraining enough (in the right\nways) to steer creativity away from zero-sum and negative-sum games\nand toward positive-sum games: that is, wealth creation, not wealth\ncapture. \nHere, then, in a few sentences, is one way of understanding\nHayek’s point. Not everything that happens in an evolving\ncommunity is foreseen or intended. Actions have more than one\nconsequence, and more than the intended consequence. This is\nespecially so when there is more than one decision maker. No one\nfollows a planner’s plan simply because the planner intends that\nthey do so. People adjust to the planner’s plan in service of\ntheir own plans rather than those of the planner, and the result is\ntoo chaotic to be safely predictable. Further, the rule of law itself\nis an evolving product of ongoing decision making, so it likewise\ntakes a shape not intended by any legislator. Does this mean that\nevery order is tautologically a spontaneous order? The answer: it is a\nuniversally true empirical generalization, not a tautology, that every\nsocial organization, even a dictatorship, is partly an\nongoing product of ordering processes that are to some degree\nspontaneous. However, while the degree to which outcomes are\nunintended is a continuum, there remains a point in categorizing\ncommunities as centrally planned versus spontaneous. A central plan is\ndesigned to yield an end-state. The plan aims to bring about\nparticular outcomes—what roles people will play, what they will\nachieve in those roles, and what they will win by so achieving. By\ncontrast, in what we should call spontaneous order, government\nprovides a stable and known framework of rules, aiming not to realize\na particular outcome so much as to realize a particular process (Hayek\n1944, 113). Although this ideal can never be fully achieved in\npractice, a government under rule of law acts as referee and provider\nof the rule book (Hayek 1960, 114) and operates as much as possible by\nan ideal of “letting the players play.” \nIs letting the players play good? Necessarily good? Adam Smith might\nhave said no, as might Hayek. A praiseworthy rule of law—a\npraiseworthy market process— facilitates mutually\nbeneficial trade by internalizing externalities, by minimizing\ntransaction cost (especially when it comes to acquiring information),\nby minimizing opportunities to acquire people’s goods without\ntheir consent (thereby encouraging people to trade on\nagreeable—thus typically beneficial—terms), and by being\nextremely cautious about trying to do more than that. When a\ngovernment succeeds in doing that much, and further succeeds in\nrestraining itself from trying to do more, progress is the likely\nresult, which is not to say progress is guaranteed.  \nHayek had no particular complaint about providing public education or\nthe minimal elements of a welfare state, but not because such\ninstitutions are essential. Hayek would simply have said that such\ninstitutions need not devolve into central planning and thus need not\nbe antithetical to a free society. Issuing vouchers, for example, to\nsubsidize the purchase of epipens or education would to some extent\ndistort markets in the subsidized products (having an inflationary\nimpact on prices for those products) but it would not distort to the\nextent that price controls would. \nHayek was a consequentialist of sorts, as was Adam Smith, and yet\nHayek’s defense of economic freedom, like Smith’s, hints\nat a contractarian or deontological moral sensibility that regards the\nseparateness of persons as morally fundamental. Thus, for example,\nHayek says, “the test of the justice of a rule is usually (since\nKant) described as that of its universalizability” (Hayek 1969,\n168). As John Gray sees it, Hayek commended the laws of justice\n“as being the indispensable condition for the promotion of the\ngeneral welfare” but Hayek held, at the same time, that\n“an impartial concern for the general welfare is itself one of\nthe demands of universalizability” (Gray 1984, 65). \nIn service of the overall project of fostering the general welfare,\nthe point of law and legislation is to craft a framework such that a\nmarket order is a history of pareto-improving\n trades.[5]\n A primary role of law and (when necessary) legislation is to narrow\npeople’s options so as to limit opportunities to get rich at\nother people’s\n expense.[6]\n So long as the rule of law can internalize external cost and thereby\nsteer innovation in mutually beneficial rather than parasitic\ndirections, an evolving order will be an order of rising\nprosperity. \nBy contrast, in a planned order, even astute and conscientious\ndecisions by men of system are damaging in a particular way. Namely,\nto the extent that men of system become micro-managers, they are\nplayers rather than umpires. If bureaucrats start playing the\ngame—responding to ephemeral events with centralized fine\ntuning—then even if they play as cleverly as bureaucrats could\npossibly play, the fact remains that in consequence, the dispersed and\ntacit knowledge of ordinary buyers and sellers ends up on the\nsidelines watching. People who would have been job creators become\nmere spectators, hamstrung by uncertainty, waiting to see what the\nplan is going to be. Until they know the plan, they have no way to\nknow, or even intelligently guess, something as simple as whether\ntheir staff is too small or too large. \nGovernment provides the framework for interaction. Ideally, as\nmentioned, government operates only within a stable and known\nframework of rules (Hayek 1944, 113). This is Hayek’s ideal of\ngood government. Is it realistic? Could any government be expected to\nact as an impartial umpire? Hayek saw the rule of law as the\nmarket’s exogenous ecological niche, and thought that this\nniche, the rule of law, must be properly constructed if the process of\nspontaneous order is be a good thing. However, Hayek seemingly came to\ndoubt there could be any such thing as properly constructed rule of\nlaw, for the following reason. Law-making is a process driven by\nprocesses more or less indistinguishable from market process except\nthat benefits to legislators of their law-making are concentrated\nwhile costs are widely dispersed, that is to say, external, and at\nbest only dimly understood even after the\n fact.[7]\n This is not only a moral hazard but an information problem. A piece\nof legislation may be thousands of pages. No one intends the\nbill as a whole. Indeed, there is no overall point to the bill, known\nor otherwise, because, prior to passage, literally no one has even\nread more than a few pages of it, not even the hundreds of legislators\nwho each added a few pages of earmarks as the price of securing their\nvote. \nCommon law, by contrast, is a body of practice and tradition that\nsometimes needs to be supplemented by legislation. Crucially, however,\nby virtue of passing the test of time as a device for settling\ndisputes, common law cannot be seen as mere prejudice or superstition.\nOn the contrary, it will have a decided advantage over ongoing\nlegislation, given that legislation is driven by untested ideas about\nhow to respond to the crises of the day, needing to be passed without\nanyone knowing the larger and lasting consequences. Hayek never\ndoubted the need for legislation but lamented our propensity to be\noblivious to its inevitably unintended consequences and to radically\ndiscount its inevitably unseen cost (Hayek 1973, 86).  \nTo Hayek, it matters far more that the law be a framework for\ncoordination than exactly what the coordination points are (Hayek\n1960, 118). Hayek realizes that many coordination points have\ndistributive implications, which leads Hayek to lament our tendency to\nevaluate distributions by asking whether they are just. (Yet, Hayek\nconcedes, at least in principle, the legitimacy of a minimum income or\nwelfare safety net of some sort. See Tebble 2015 for a sympathetic yet\nacute argument that this concession on Hayek’s part is a\n“fatal ambivalence.” In fact, Tebble argues, Hayek’s\nrepudiation of social justice leaves him with no room to make any such\nconcession.)  \nHayek says, “one of my chief preoccupations for more than 10\nyears” has been coming to terms with the idea that social\njustice is a mirage (Hayek 1978b,\n 57).[8]\n By social justice, Hayek seems to mean distributive justice,\nand more specifically what Nozick called end-state principles of\ndistributive justice, which treat justice as a feature of outcomes\nrather than of procedures. \nWhy would justice so conceived be a mirage? Hayek says, “there\ncan be no distributive justice where no one distributes” (Hayek\n1978b, 58 or 1976, 68–69). In Hayek’s words,\n“considerations of justice provide no justification for\n‘correcting’ the results of the market” (1969, 175).\nSo long as traders are voluntarily making pareto-superior moves, there\nis nothing else that can be said or needs to be said by way of\njustification. \nWhy resist applying conceptions of justice and injustice to situations\nwhere no one distributes? What is haunting Hayek here is not the idea\nthat one person might be more deserving than another, but that a\n“merit czar” might presume to intervene so as to correct\nmarkets that fail to give people what the czar thinks people deserve.\nFearing the potential for tyranny, Hayek argues not that markets are\njust but that they are not the kind of thing that can be just or\nunjust. Where no one distributes, there may be something lamentable\nabout the result, but the result will not be an injustice in the way\nthat engineering such a result would be. Outcomes that would\nhave been unjust  if deliberately imposed (such as being born\nwith a cleft palate) sometimes simply happen. As Rawls says,\n“The natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it\nunjust that persons are born into society at some particular position.\nThese are simply natural facts.” Hayek would agree. \nRawls, however, immediately adds what Hayek would call a non sequitur:\n“What is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with\nthese facts” (Rawls, 1971, 102), where resigning ourselves to\nthe facts is the paradigmatically unjust way of dealing with them\n(ibid). If Rawls is right to deem the natural distribution neither\njust nor unjust, then when institutions “deal with natural\nfacts,” they are, to Hayek, not undoing wrongs. Hayek would\nnever deny that cleft palates are bad or that fixing them is good, but\nwould insist that fixing what is not unjust cannot count as rectifying\ninjustice. If we feel called upon to help children with cleft palates,\nit will be because having a cleft palate is bad, not because having it\nis unjust. When we help, we are not fixing an improper distribution of\ncleft plates. We are simply fixing cleft palates. When we respond to\nthe problem, we take a stand not against injustice but against\nsuffering (Hayek 1976, 87). As Hayek knew, he was profoundly at odds\nwith much thinking about social justice. He expected to be vilified\n(1944, vii), and he was. Although he was as responsive to misfortune\nas anyone, and seemed to embrace the same package of duties to\nchildren as any social justice theorist would, he also saw the free\nworld at a crossroads between a defeasible presumption that normal\nadults have agreed to share each other’s fate (Rawls, 1971, 102) and a\ndefeasible presumption that normal adults have the right and the\nresponsibility to play the cards that nature has dealt.  \nHayek seems to worry that our sense of justice can make it harder for\nus to live together, and make progress together. To Hayek, if people\ncannot claim that a starting point is unjust, then whatever we do must\nbe justified as an improvement, not as rectification. If\nthere is no injustice needing rectification, then the improvement we\nhave a right to strive for is pareto-improvement, or in any case,\nimprovement by mutually acceptable means. By contrast, if (contra\nRawls) the natural distribution were unjust, that would open the field\nto all of the zero-sum and negative-sum moves that people feel\nwarranted in imposing on each other under the guise of being fair. The\nright to make such moves with other people’s money becomes an\noverwhelmingly lucrative political football, luring a society’s\nentrepreneurial talent into politics, where instead of creating new\nsocial capital, entrepreneurs spend their time inventing clever new\nways of dividing it. (Rawls could note that money being in the\npossession of others does not entail that the money is rightfully\ntheirs, but Hayek is doing social science here. Hayek would not deny\nthe plain fact that people can and often do treat other people’s\npossessions as a political football, and sometimes even invent\ntheories according to which they have a right to do so. Hayek is\ntalking about the actual empirical cost of treating other\npeople’s possessions as a political football, not the\ntheoretical possibility.)  \nIn Hayek’s mind, we should want a system of justice to be a\nframework that helps us to coordinate on a set of mutual expectations\nthat we each find useful in helping us stay out of each other’s\nway as we each set a course for our individually chosen destinations.\nNo principle of justice would pick our destination for us. Neither\nwould it require us to justify our destination to others. Indeed, the\npremium would be on people not needing to justify themselves. If we\noperated by end-state principles of justice (Nozick 1974), we would\nneed to justify every move that bore on how goods would be distributed\nin the evolving end-state, which is to say we would need to justify\nvirtually every trade we contemplate, which would gridlock us rather\nthan facilitate our inventing new ways of making ourselves more\nvaluable to the people around us. \nPerhaps Hayek is overreacting here. In any case, some philosophical\ninterpretation is unavoidable, but this, arguably, accounts for\nHayek’s seemingly dogmatic dismissal of end-state principles of\njustice. For reasons reminiscent of Nozick’s, Hayek finds such\nprinciples unaffordable, and incompatible with autonomous agents\nminding their own business in a free society. Indeed such principles\nmake it impossible to say what could count as minding one’s own\nbusiness. In that respect, in trying to carve out a coherent realm of\nindividual autonomy, Hayek is, as he often claimed, paradigmatically a\nliberal, not conservative. \nMerit, as Hayek understands it, concerns the character of the action\nas opposed to the nature of the achievement (Hayek 1960, 94). In other\nwords, to Hayek, claims of merit concern the inputs one brings to a\nprocess, not the output. In Hayek’s mind, nothing good can come\nof that. In a free society, to Hayek, we are rewarded for our output,\nnot our input (Hayek 1960, 98). \nHayek has an important point. Among his core concerns is the\n“mirage” of thinking that justice requires rewarding\npeople for supplying inputs rather than for supplying outputs.\nAdmittedly, if we leave customers to their own devices, output is what\nthey will reward, which is what Hayek wants. By the same token, when\npeople left to their own devices choose to reward us for our output,\ntheir behavior will not be utterly insensitive to merit. The tendency\nof market rewards to track merit will be merely a tendency, but\nmeritocracy being merely a tendency is not the same as meritocracy\nbeing a mirage. A key element of the success of a system in promoting\nprosperity will be that in rewarding excellent output, it will be\nrewarding the hard work, courage, alertness, and commitment that makes\nfor excellence. It will be rewarding luck too, to be sure, but\ntypically not sheer random\n fluke.[9]\n Hayek speaks as if merit has everything to do with trying hard, and\nnothing to do with achieving excellence. \nHayek says we want to economize on merit (Hayek 1960, 96). If merit\nwere tied exclusively to supplying inputs, then Hayek would be right.\nBut even so, saying we economize on hard work is another way of saying\nhard work is important. It is not evidence that we are in the grip of\na mirage when we imagine that we have reason to reward hard work that\nculminates in excellent output. \nIn sum, a merit theorist might concede to Hayek that rewards ought to\ntrack actual performance, not inner merit. Customers can judge your\nproduct’s merits without needing to know whether you were lucky.\nThe crucial point is that wherever it is more rewarding to work hard\nthan not, more rewarding to do excellent work than not, more rewarding\nto be alert to customer needs than not, a system is tending to reward\nthe right things. In that system, output will tend to be increasingly\nexcellent over time. Products will tend to work. People will tend to\nprosper, and will tend to aim at being meritorious to boot. \nAs noted, Hayek’s critique of social justice is more\nspecifically a critique of centrally planned distribution according to\nmerit. He thinks a merit czar would be intolerable. However, what\nHayek found nightmarish about this vision clearly had more to do with\nan abhorrence of central planning than of the idea that it would be\ngood to have a way of rewarding merit. If Hayek is right that there is\nno place for centralized decisions about meritoriousness in a good\nsociety, then, contra Hayek, the implication is not that merit does\nnot matter but precisely that it does (Hayek 1976, 64). The problem\nwith merit czars in the world we know, Hayek seems to assume, is that,\nin a merit-based system, if you cannot prove you deserve G,\nthat licenses merit czars to redistribute from the less to the more\ndeserving. The point is crucial not because it refutes Hayek but\nbecause it reveals the exact nature of Hayek’s real concern.\nHayek’s core concern is not the mirage ofthinking merit\ndoes matter, but the mirage of thinking entitlement\n doesn’t.[10] \nNote the similarity between Hayek’s view and the view expressed\nby John Rawls in “Two Concepts of Rules” (1955). Hayek and\nRawls both understood what is involved in a practice having\nutility. To use Rawls’s example, the practice of baseball is\ndefined by procedural rules rather than by end-state principles of\ndistributive justice. To have a practice at all, we must be dogmatic\n(Hayek would say) about how many strikes a batter should get. \nImagine changing the concept of the game so that the umpire’s\njob is to make sure the good guys win. What would that do to the\nplayers? What would become of their striving? The result of the change\nwould not be baseball. If we end up with a game where the umpire is\nmaking sure the favored side wins, then the players are sitting on the\nsidelines watching, hoping to be favored. Hayek’s insight (and\nRawls’s insight at that stage of his career) is that genuine\nfairness is not about making sure prizes are properly\n distributed.[11]\n It is not even about making sure outcomes are not unduly influenced\nby morally arbitrary factors such as how well the players played or\nhow hard they worked to develop their talent. True fairness is about\nbeing impartial, nonpartisan—proverbially, “letting the\nplayers play.” \nOne of Hayek’s problems with the kind of justice that amounts to\nmaking sure the good guys win is that it tends to turn society’s\nbasic structure into a political football, which tends to squander\ngains from trade. To Hayek, again, true justice is about letting the\nplayers play, in the same way as pareto-improving economic\ncoordination is about letting the players\n play.[12] \nWhether we realize gains requires only that we trade, not that we\ntrade at any particular price. Thus, we don’t want to focus on\nprice when the wealth of nations has everything to do with gains from\ntrade and nothing to do with price. \nIndeed, Hayek observes, being obsessed with just price would make\ntrading less likely, which would tend to squander some of the\ncooperative surplus. Much of Hayek’s aversion to justice stems\nfrom a sense that (for thousands of years) talk of justice has had a\nway of turning into talk of just price (Hayek 1976, 73). This\nmakes prices appear morally important, which to Hayek is a\n mirage.[13]\n Of Adam Smith’s butchers and bakers, Hayek says, \nPrecisely because they were interested only in who would offer the\nbest price for their products, they reached persons wholly unknown to\nthem, whose standard of life they thereby enhanced much more than they\ncould have that of their neighbors… (Hayek 1978b, 60). \nHayek’s dismissal of social justice as a mirage is a\ngratuitously tendentious way of packaging his actual view. However,\nthe motive for his dismissal is understandable: namely his dread of\nthe prospect of licensing a justice czar to intervene to make sure\nprices are fair, thus derailing the wealth-creating spontaneous\ntrading of a free society within the rule of law. Paraphrasing Michael\nMunger (2013), the closest thing we have to an omniscient social\nplanner are the twin forces of supply and demand, but those forces\nspeak to people through prices. When the state makes it a crime to\ncharge what the market will bear, it can thereby become illegal for\ninsulin users to respond to a power failure by outbidding beer\ndrinkers for insulin-preserving ice as supply runs short. In a case\nlike that, the law has struck dumb the only voice that could give\npeople reliable, timely advice on how resources need to be allocated\nright now. This is Hayek’s ultimate concern throughout his writings,\nand it also underlies his otherwise ill-fitting polemic against social\njustice. To Hayek, it is simply a mirage to think fairness has\nanything to do with stopping the price mechanism from telling us where\nour services are most in need. \nHayek never doubts that we sometimes need legislation, but he thinks\nthe aim of legislation should be to make things better, not fairer; to\nmake things more productive, not more level; to channel innovative\nthinking in the direction of wealth creation, not wealth capture.\nHayek in fact endorses norms of pure procedural justice, and would\nagree that there is such a thing, after all, as fairness. True\nfairness, he would say, is about letting players play on a more or\nless level playing field, but he would insist that this is not about\nmaking sure everyone wins their share. Hayek saw a free society as one\nwhere people stand or fall on the basis of how well they perform, not\nhow hard they try—what they produce, not what they intend.  \nHayek’s economic education at the University of Vienna was\nwithin the law faculty. Hayek’s degrees were in political\nscience, jurisprudence, and economics. His dissertation work was on\nthe technical topic of the imputation of value in a capital-using\neconomy, and his early professional work focused on monetary theory\nand business cycle statistics. As with other scholars of the Austrian\nSchool of Economics, the institutional framework within which economic\nactivity takes place was never far from the foreground of even the\nmost technical economic analysis. Law, politics, and social mores all\nare critical to the way Austrian economists see economic forces\nplaying out in the real world.  \nCritical to the Austrian examination of the operation of the\ncompetitive market process is the primacy placed on property rights,\nrelative prices, and profit-and-loss accounting. The emphasis on\ninstitutional infrastructure informed Austrian perspectives on price\ntheory and the market system, on monetary and capital theory, and on\nobstacles to socialist economic planning in particular and to\ninterventionism more generally. To Hayek, the idea of prices without\nproperty is a grand illusion, and efforts to control economic activity\nthrough prohibitions and regulations are plagued by unintended\nconsequences and unforeseen costs. \nHayek’s growing frustration with the conversation among elite\neconomists during the 1930s and 1940s was born out his utter surprise\nthat the institutional wisdom passed down from classical political\neconomists to the early neoclassical economists was being lost. He saw\nwanted to know why. He explored the rise of formalism and an emerging\nshift toward macro-theory emphasizing relationships between aggregate\nvariables unconnected to the choices of individuals. To Hayek, these\nshifts were technical in part, but the technicality was masking (and\npartly driven by) a deeper philosophical shift from seeing the human\ncondition as complex as a relatively simple machine that a good\nmechanic could tinker with and perfect. The whole idea of studying the\nhuman condition as a complex spontaneous order came to seem\nunscientific. Thus, in “The Use of Knowledge in Society”,\nHayek says the maximizing and equilibrium thinking of mathematical\neconomics “habitually disregards” essential parts of the\nphenomena to be explained, and in so doing “misleads some of our\nleading thinkers” (1944, 91).  \nThe issue Hayek concerns himself with in The Counter-Revolution of\nScience was the wrong turn in the philosophy and history of ideas that\nconfused the current generation about the nature of the social\nsciences and the institutions of liberalism and the principles of\njustice. His sustained explorations of legal philosophy and political\ntheory sought to counter excessive formalism, excessive aggregation,\nand a naïve empiricism that in his mind conspired to produce the\nintellectual dead-end of scientism: that is, an inappropriate and\nuncritical application of the methods of the natural sciences to the\nproblems of social science. In articulating his critique, Hayek would\nstress over the next several decades the case for methodological\ndualism, and the method and approach for the sciences of complex\nphenomena. \nAs a student of the Austrian School of Economics, Hayek was a\nsubjectivist as well as a marginalist in his approach to studying\nhuman decision making. The value of goods and services resides in the\njudgment of the individual chooser, and is not inherent in the goods\nand services themselves. Neither are prices posted in the market\nmerely a summation of costs of production. Value, costs and the\nexpectations of individuals choosers are driven individual buyers and\nsellers assessing tradeoffs. (To give a concrete example, owners of\ngas stations may hike the retail price of gasoline in response to\nbreaking news of a supply problem in the middle east. The news does\nnot affect the price of gas already in their storage tanks, but it\ndoes affect their assessment of what the wholesale price of gasoline\nwill be next time they are buying new supplies so that they can stay\nin business. Retail customers see the hike as gouging because they\ndon’t understand that profit from current sales is what has to\npay for new supplies.) Thus, Hayek’s point in calling the valuation\nprocess subjective is not to say it is a matter of opinion. Rather, it\nis a process of perceiving reality as needing one response rather than\nanother.  \nEconomic science begins with purposeful human action. And, as social\nscientists we can interpret human action in terms of beliefs, desires\nand intentions. “To employ a useful metaphor,” Hayek\nargued, “while in the world of nature we look from the outside,\nwe look at society from the inside; while, as far as nature is\nconcerned, our concepts are about the facts and have to be adapted to\nthe facts, in the world of society at least some of the most familiar\nconcepts are the stuff from which the world is made” (1948,\n76). \nHayek’s mentor, Ludwig Mises, stated the argument as follows in\nhis treatise of economics, Human Action (1949, 92):\n“Economics is not about things and tangible material objects; it\nis about men, their meanings and actions. Goods, commodities, and\nwealth are all the other notions of conduct are not elements of\nnature; they are elements of human meaning and conduct. He who wants\nto deal with them must not look at the external world; he must search\nfor them in the meaning of acting man.” \nA favorite example among Austrian School economists was to imagine a\nscientist from Mars studying patterns in the New York subway Our\nscientific Martian will observe that at 8:00am that there will be\nbodies and boxes, and the boxes will pick up the bodies and move.\nThen, at 5:00pm, those boxes will come back to the same places and\nbodies will leave the boxes. This observer could develop a study of\nmoving boxes and bodies and offer predictions. But can our observer\ntruly understand the phenomena under investigation without reference\nto the purposes and plans of the actors involved, and thus rather than\nseeing boxes and bodies, we come to understand the pattern of action\nassociated with commuting to work. Fritz Machlup tried to capture this\nidea when he penned an essay under the title: “What if Matter\nCould Talk?” The social sciences are indeed engaged in\nscientific inquiry, but the subject of study was radically different\nbecause we are what we study. \nIn addition to the uniqueness of the human sciences, the Austrian\nSchool of Economics emphasized the passage of time, the uncertainty\ninherent in human decision making, and the complexity of the economic\norder. The complexity aspect is not new to the Viennese economists,\nbut can be seen in Adam Smith’s discussion at the beginning of\nThe Wealth of Nations of the division of labor and the\nspontaneous far-flung patterns of cooperation required to such mundane\nthings as a worker’s woolen coat. The number of exchanges, Smith\nstates, exceeds all computation. The Austrian School added to this\ncomputational complexity the idea of ceaseless change that requires\nconstant adaptation and adjustment to the shift in circumstances,\nincluding changes in tastes, technology and resource availability. The\nunderstanding of the price theory and the market system from the early\ndevelopment by Menger and Bohm-Bawerk, and the more mature formulation\nin Mises and Hayek argued that a proper understanding of the market\neconomy did not strive to depict the efficiency properties of the\nend-state, but the adaptive and learning aspects of the system.  \nHayek’s intellectual adversaries shifted in the second half of\nhis career, though of course there are common themes. But the German\nHistoricist and the Collectivist Positivist were no longer the\nanimating force they were in the first half of the 20th century.\nLogical positivism was also transformed. One of the remnants from the\ninfluence of Scientism, however, was in Hayek’s mind a failure\nto address the essential complexity of the social world. As a\nconsequence, his methodological writings in the 1960s and 1970s tend\nto stress not subjectivism and the human sciences, but the differences\nbetween the sciences of simple phenomena and the sciences of essential\ncomplexity. \nAgain, Hayek was born in 1899, and born in Vienna. That is to say,\nHayek grew up in a glorious age of Viennese culture only to see it\nevaporate before his eyes with WWI, the Great Depression, the rise of\nsocialism and fascism, WWII, and the Cold War. Hayek fought in WWI. He\nwas among those who left Vienna in the early 1930s never to return. He\nexperienced WWII in his adopted home of Great Britain. Like others of\nhis generation, these experiences were pivotal. He saw totalitarianism\ndistorting science and scholarship, as did two of his philosophical\nfriends: Michael Polanyi and Karl Popper. Despite their differences,\nHayek drew inspiration from and helped promote the work of Polanyi and\nPopper. Totalitarian systems inevitably end up being hostile to the\ncritical attitude at the heart of scientific inquiry. Hayek, Polanyi\nand Popper all saw this in the 1930s and 1940s, and in their separate\nways sought to describe and defend the science of a free society.","contact.mail":"dschmidtz01@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2012-09-15","date.changed":"2021-04-16","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-hayek/","author1":"David Schmidtz","author1.info":"http://davidschmidtz.com/","author2.info":"https://www.peter-boettke.com/","entry":"friedrich-hayek","body.text":"\n\n\nFriedrich Hayek was born in Vienna in 1899 into a family steeped in\nacademic life and scientific research. He worked as a statistician\nfrom 1927–31, became a Lecturer in Economics at the University\nof Vienna in 1929, then moved to the University of London in 1931, the\nUniversity of Chicago in 1950, and the University of Freiburg in 1962,\nretiring in 1967. He kept writing into the 1980s, dying in 1992.\n\n\nHayek worked in the areas of philosophy of science, political\nphilosophy, the free will problem, and epistemology. For all that,\nHayek was more hedgehog than fox. His life’s work, for which he\nwon a Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, illuminated the nature and\nsignificance of spontaneous order. The concept seems simple, yet Hayek\nspent six decades refining his idea, evidently finding elusive the\ngoal of being as clear about it as he aspired to be.\n\n\nThis essay concentrates on this enduring theme of Hayek’s work,\nand a question: why would the scholar who did more than anyone in the\ntwentieth century to advance our understanding of price signals and\nthe emergence of spontaneous orders also be driven to claim\n“that social justice is a mirage” (Hayek 1978b, 57)?\n\nOver hundreds of millions of years, order emerged in the natural\nworld. How? It is only human to wonder. “Design arguments”\ncome to mind, but like most philosophers, Hayek considers such\narguments fallacious as arguments that we need to posit a designer to\nexplain the emergence of order in nature. (See the entry on\n teleological arguments for God’s existence.)\n Hayek, however, was frustrated to find the same fallacy in arguments\nthat we need to posit a designer to explain the emergence of order in\nsociety (Hayek 1960, 59). \nJust as no one had to invent natural selection, no one had to invent\nthe process by which natural languages evolve. A language is a\nmassively path-dependent process of unending mutual adjustment.\nLanguage evolves spontaneously. It would make no sense to call any\nlanguage optimally efficient, but it does make sense to see languages\nas highly refined and effective adaptations to the evolving\ncommunication needs of particular populations (Hayek 1945, 528). \nIt would be no exaggeration to say that social theory begins\nwith—and has an object only because of—the discovery that\nthere exist orderly structures which are the product of the action of\nmany men but are not the result of human design. In some fields this\nis now universally accepted. Although there was a time when men\nbelieved that even language and morals had been invented by some\ngenius of the past, everybody recognizes now that they are the outcome\nof a process of evolution whose results nobody foresaw or designed\n(Hayek 1973, 37). \nNatural selection operates on mutations, making the path of natural\nselection unpredictable, regardless of how well we understand the\nunderlying principles. To Hayek, social and cultural evolution are\nmuch the same: driven by innovation, fashion, and various shocks that\n“mutate” people’s plans in unpredictable ways with\nunpredictable results. The system may be more or less logical. Most\nthings seem in retrospect to have happened for a reason. Yet, however\nlogical the system may be, its logic does not render the system\ndeterministic. We can make predictions in the broadest sense, such as\nwhen we say that increasing the money supply causes prices to rise,\nother things equal, but we have no basis for predicting the fine\ndetails. The system is technically chaotic, to such a degree that even\nsomething as straightforward as next week’s stock prices will\nalways remain a matter of guesswork even for experts. (See the entry\non\n chaos.) \nTo Hayek, prices are like languages. How do we know what it will take\nto get our product to whomever wants or needs it most? Maybe we take\nbids. As we (and our rivals) take bids for x, x\ncomes to have a price. As with language, prices enable people to form\nmutual expectations. Free-floating prices help people coordinate in\nintricate and mutually considerate ways as they individually decide\nwhat to produce or consume. To think that an authority needs to decide\nwhat the price of rice ought to be is like thinking that an authority\nneeds to decide what sound people should make when they want to refer\nto rice. \nIt is a mundane yet intriguing fact that price signals induce people\nto respond to information they do not possess: such as the changing\ncost of drilling, or the discovery of a cheap substitute, or that\npolitical unrest has made a key input harder to acquire. Having no\ninkling of those variables, buyers nevertheless respond to them in a\nrational way, because they know the one thing they need to know:\nnamely, the price (Hayek 1978a, 4). \nAssume that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of\nsome raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of\nsupply of tin has been eliminated. It does not matter for our\npurpose—and it is very significant that it does not\nmatter—which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All\nthat the users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used\nto consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in\nconsequence, they must economize tin (Hayek 1945, 526). \nWhat emerges from the haggling is not only a deal, but something\nlarger: a community. There was no central decision about who should\nproduce tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision about who\nshould consume tin, or whether anyone should; no central decision\nabout what should be given in return for tin. All that happened is\nthat some people guessed that if they were to produce tin and bring it\nto market, it would be worth something to customers—enough to\nmake the venture worthwhile. When some of these guesses prove correct\nand trades are consummated, a market in tin emerges and becomes part\nof what brings people together as partners in mutually beneficial\nventures. \nPrice signals thus economize on information. In the process,\nthey induce patterns of cooperation that involve multitudes.\nCooperation evolves among people who need not share a language, need\nnot be aware of each other’s existence, and need not be aware of\ntheir mutual dependence. They are only vaguely aware of the thousands\nof jobs that need doing so as to supply inputs that enable them to\nhave a finished product to sell. Particular agents seldom if ever have\nmore than a glimpse of the big picture, yet they manage to come\ntogether to form a community, and almost all are vastly better off as\na result. \nTechnological progress extends the frontiers of the possible. To\nHayek, it is the freedom of the few to do something novel that matters\nmost, not the freedom of the many to do something familiar.\nAccordingly, the freedom I exercise myself often is not the freedom\nthat has the most bearing on my future (Hayek 1960, 32). Consider that\nearly adopters finance research that brings down production costs and\nthus finances a dispersion of products and services at falling prices\nthat eventually bring late adopters like me to the market. I may never\ntrade with early adopters, yet even so I depend on them, for they help\nto finance the invention and ongoing re-invention of products whose\nmarginal cost eventually falls to a point where I can afford them. \nOften, technological progress consists of innovations that lower\ntransaction cost: steam boat, railroad, air travel, telegraph,\ntelephone, internet, bar code reader, “apps” that make\npossible such businesses as Uber and AirBnB, along with innovative\norganizational structures and business models such as Federal Express\nor container ships (which, after a ten-year legal battle with trade\nunions, reduced from days to minutes the time that a truck’s\ncontents would spend at the dockyard before being transferred to a\nship). In many cases, the cost of transacting concerns the cost of\ninformation. As the frontier of knowledge expands, the slice that a\ngiven individual can grasp inevitably becomes a smaller fraction of\nthe whole. Prices become an increasingly indispensable window to a\nworld of tacit knowledge. \nIn summary, technological innovation shocks economies. Formerly\nprofitable investments become relics of a bygone age and must be\nliquidated. Workers get laid off until they find some other way to\nproduce goods wanted by today’s customers. Transitions are\ntough, miscalculations abound, but the upshot is that we grope toward\nheights made possible by a given innovation. Innovative ways of\nlowering transaction cost spread throughout a community, and failures\n(including once-useful but now obsolete innovations) are discarded.\nMore precisely, failures are discarded if and when decision makers are\ninnovators on the ground, learning to avoid losing their own money on\nideas that fail to bear fruit in a given time and place. \nHayek denies that resources will ever be used at theoretical peak\nefficiency (1945, 527). Humans being what they are, waste is\nubiquitous. Mistakes are ubiquitous. The “marvel” of\nmarkets is that people make mistakes, get burnt, learn fast, and make\ncorrections. By contrast, if decision makers are bureaucrats in large\norganizations, their focus is not on avoiding mistakes but on avoiding\nbudget cuts. If bureaucrats acknowledge that their plan is failing,\nthe consequences is not that they retrench and divert their own\nresources to better purposes but that their supervisors cut their\nbudgets. Note: what cuts their budget is not the mistake so much as\nsomeone learning from the mistake. Bureaucratic structure makes new\ninformation a threat that needs to be suppressed, or smothered in\npropaganda (1944, 126ff, 153ff). \nBureaucrats and their expert advisors experience mistakes not as\nevents from which they need to learn but rather as events that they\nneed to cover up. Their mistakes are with other people’s money,\nso bureaucrats learn to say with a straight face, when confronted,\nthat their budget was not large enough, or that things would have been\nworse without their\n policies.[1]\n They may even believe what they are saying, but they do not know and\nhave every incentive to avoid learning. \nIf we understand the principles that drive the logic of the system, we\nmay be able to predict that a population of insects will evolve\nresistance to a pesticide. We may be able to predict that a society\nthat declares war on drugs will lose. Beyond the question of what we\ncan predict, then, Hayek has a further and more precise target:\nhowever much we can predict, there is a drastic limit to what we can\nsimply\n decide.[2]\n No one can decide that people won’t respond in predictable ways\nto perverse incentives unintentionally created by a central plan, in\nthe same way that no one can decide that insects will not become\nresistant to an insecticide. \nThis point, as Adam Smith observed, is not obvious. There is a class\nof technocrats who will not appreciate the difficulty. As Smith\nfamously observed, and as Hayek quotes approvingly, the “man of\nsystem”  \nseems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great\nsociety with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces\nupon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the\nchess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the\nhand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human\nsociety, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own,\naltogether different from that which the legislature might choose to\nimpress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same\ndirection, the game of human society will go on easily and\nharmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they\nare opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the\nsociety must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder (Smith\n1790, 234). \nThe system has a logic. Planners cannot change that logic. Their main\ndecision is whether to work with that logic or against it (which Smith\nregards as a choice between harmony and misery). Smith holds that\nplanners who disregard economic logic are deciding in effect to\nsacrifice their “pawns,” something that a person of true\nbenevolence would not do. \nWhen Hayek explains the obstacle to effective central planning, his\nclaim is not merely the Smithian point that information is widely\ndispersed and therefore hard to acquire. Rather, it is impossible to\nacquire (Hayek 1973, 51). When prices are set periodically by a\ncentral planner, rather than instantaneously by consumers and\nproducers who are the first and typically the only people to have that\ninformation in reliable and timely form, prices inevitably carry less\nreliable, less timely information. As Hayek notes, \nIf we possess all the relevant information, if we can start out from a\ngiven system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of\navailable means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic.\nThat is, the answer to the question of what is the best use of our\navailable means is implicit in our assumptions. This, however, is\nemphatically not the economic problem which society faces. And the\neconomic calculus which we have developed to solve this logical\nproblem, though an important step toward the solution of the economic\nproblem of society, does not yet provide an answer to it. The reason\nfor this is that the “data” from which the economic\ncalculus starts are never for the whole society “given” to\na single mind which could work out the implications and can never be\nso given (Hayek 1945, 519). \nSoviet central planners made decisions by checking prices on\ninternational markets, but suppose there were no information about\nsupply and demand to be had anywhere. Suppose you are a planner, but\nall you know is that demands are coming in for wire and for jewelry.\nHow do you decide whether to direct factories to make wire out of\ncopper or platinum, or whether smiths should make jewelry out of gold\nor silver? How do you decide who should get silver jewelry and who\nshould get gold? How do you decide whether anyone at all should get\njewelry, as opposed to reserving all such metals for use as wire? \nWhen consumers are not paying for what they receive, their demand is\neffectively infinite. Inevitably, a central planner’s task\nbecomes one of cost containment. Worse yet, a planner with no measure\nof cost has only a limited basis for deciding what to count as\ncontaining cost. If a given ton of steel can make one car or ten\nrefrigerators, which way of using steel is economical? How does a\nplanner decide whether to invest in upgrading water supplies or\nnuclear reactors? If all you know as a producer is that people are\nasking for infinitely more than you can give, then eventually you turn\na deaf ear, deliver your quota, and pay no attention to whether\ndemands from below (from customers) are being met. The only demands\nthat have consequences are demands from above (that is, those which\ncome to you through your supervisors). \nSuppose that prices are set by planners. Hayek says with a thought\nmore characteristic of neoclassical economists: “Only prices\ndetermined on the free market will bring it about that demand equals\nsupply” (Hayek 1960, 63). Price controls—floors and\nceilings—make buyers and sellers less able to respond to the\nsignals they would send each other if they could raise their offer or\nlower their asking price. If price cannot rise, then buyers cannot\nsignal producers that demand has increased and that producers would\nsell more if they were to increase supply. And if producers do not\nincrease supply, rising demand results in shortages rather than\neconomic growth. (See especially Zwolinski 2008 for further\n elaboration.)[3] \nA central planner could have the world’s most powerful computer,\nbeyond anything imagined when Hayek published “Use of\nKnowledge” in 1945. No computer, however, could solve the\nproblem that Hayek was trying to articulate. The problem is not lack\nof processing power so much as a lack of access to the information in\nthe first place. That much seems clear enough, but the problem has a\ndeeper level. Hayek may not have said this in so many words, yet it\nseems the most charitable way of reconstructing his more fundamental\npoint. That is, the problem is not merely lack of access to\ninformation; rather the information does not exist. There is no truth\nabout what prices should be, accessible or otherwise, except to the\nextent that prices represent what customers are paying for a given\nservice. This is the precise way in which prices are of service to a\ncommunity (1944, 51–52). \nFor example, suppose that a manufacturer figures out how to make an\n“epipen” that can save the lives of consumers otherwise at\nrisk of fatal allergic reaction to bee stings. Suppose the\nmanufacturer can produce a limited supply of epipens for a little less\nthan a hundred dollars each, and proceeds to offer them for sale for a\nhundred dollars. Suppose that the manufacturer finds that buyers line\nup by the thousands wanting to buy the pens, and suppose that there\nemerges a group of “scalpers” willing to stand in line for\nweeks, who buy all the pens for a hundred dollars each, then resell\nthe pens for two hundred dollars, then three hundred, then four, and\ndemand remains strong. Hayek would predict that if we let the price\nsignals be the marvels that they are, then other producers will jump\nin and begin to manufacture pens for one or two hundred dollars each.\nEventually the demand is met, and the scalpers go away. Meanwhile, new\nproducers drawn by the spike in profitability invent a new process\nthat enables them to produce the pens for ninety dollars, then eighty,\nand again the price will fall, as competition leads the price signal\nto track the falling cost of production. Of course, if we issue a\npatent or a licensing scheme or some other way of preventing rival\nproducers from entering the market, then this will not occur. By the\nsame token, if we impose a price ceiling of a hundred dollars, then no\nsignal is sent to prospective rivals, unless scalpers send the signal\nto rivals willing to produce for the black market. Or if there is some\nother reason why it is impossible to increase the supply, then prices\nmay drift up toward the limits of a customer’s willingness to\npay. Barring this, there are many ways for kings, legislators, or\nother planners to interfere, but price signals, if left alone, are an\ninimitably rapid and incomprehensibly vast generator of information:\nsupply and demand tend to equilibrate, and to converge on a price in\nthe neighborhood of the cost of production. To a uniquely reliable\ndegree, a product will tend to end up in a consumer’s hands just\nin case that particular consumer wants the product enough to pay what\nit cost to produce it.  \nAlthough computers cannot solve the problem, Hayek thought radically\ndispersed decision making by buyers and sellers can and does solve the\nproblem, so far as it can be solved. Sellers who charge too much end\nup without customers; they learn to be more efficient or else find\nsome other line of work.\n [4]\n Buyers who want x but consider it overpriced stay home for a\nwhile, waiting for the price to fall, but when they see x\nflying off the shelves, some of them learn something about themselves:\nthat they would rather have the product at that price than not have it\nat all. To Hayek, only a price mechanism can process changing\ninformation almost instantaneously. Ironically, the most\nefficient thing a central planner could possibly do would be to set a\nprice right where it would have been without the planner’s\nintervention. \nInsofar as society is a cooperative venture for mutual advantage,\nlearning to survive—not just physically but as full members of a\ncommunity—will involve learning to cooperate. Learning to\ncooperate involves learning to become a trading partner. In other\nwords, cooperation begins with having something to offer: a way of\nmaking people better off. \nClearly in Smith, who inspired Hayek, but also in Hayek himself, one\ninfers that the driving motivation is not greed or even well-being so\nmuch as a propensity to truck and barter, where this deal-making is\nnot only a means to an end but somehow also something we do for its\nown sake, because making deals is what our kind of social animal was\nborn to do. Neither, Hayek thought, is the objective for buyers and\nsellers to coordinate on a price that a central planner might\nstumble on, but to coordinate, period. Mutually satisfying\ncoordination, the ongoing equilibration of supply and demand,\nconstantly evolving in response to changing conditions, is itself the\nachievement. There is no need for that coordination to be tracking\nanything beyond itself. To Hayek, the value that we hope to see\nrealized in a marketplace is not so much that the correct volume of\ngoods gets exchanged at the correct price. Rather, the genesis and\npoint of the division of labor is not only a prospect of realizing\ngains from trade but trade per se. The valued result is buyers and\nsellers responding to each other, becoming more attuned to what people\naround them want, and helping to create a community in which their\nrole in an important one. \nSuch sensitivity is good, but there is little that central planners\ncan do to encourage it. Central planners replace what could be a\ncomplex, decentralized network of interdependence and mutual\nresponsibility with something more like a society of spokes tethered\nto a central distributor at the hub but otherwise dangling. It is no\nsubstitute for real community. \nIn nature, for biological adaptation to culminate in better-adapted\npopulations over time, the niche to which a population is adapting\nmust be relatively stable. Likewise, under a rule of law, the aim of\ngovernment is not to win but to provide a stable ecological niche that\nenables the game’s true players to evolve strategies apt for\nsuccess within that niche. An elaborate crystal structure cannot form\nunless the medium in which crystals form is left undisturbed.\nHayek’s ideal is a legal “medium” of society,\nliberal enough to permit creativity, stable enough\nto reward creativity, and constraining enough (in the right\nways) to steer creativity away from zero-sum and negative-sum games\nand toward positive-sum games: that is, wealth creation, not wealth\ncapture. \nHere, then, in a few sentences, is one way of understanding\nHayek’s point. Not everything that happens in an evolving\ncommunity is foreseen or intended. Actions have more than one\nconsequence, and more than the intended consequence. This is\nespecially so when there is more than one decision maker. No one\nfollows a planner’s plan simply because the planner intends that\nthey do so. People adjust to the planner’s plan in service of\ntheir own plans rather than those of the planner, and the result is\ntoo chaotic to be safely predictable. Further, the rule of law itself\nis an evolving product of ongoing decision making, so it likewise\ntakes a shape not intended by any legislator. Does this mean that\nevery order is tautologically a spontaneous order? The answer: it is a\nuniversally true empirical generalization, not a tautology, that every\nsocial organization, even a dictatorship, is partly an\nongoing product of ordering processes that are to some degree\nspontaneous. However, while the degree to which outcomes are\nunintended is a continuum, there remains a point in categorizing\ncommunities as centrally planned versus spontaneous. A central plan is\ndesigned to yield an end-state. The plan aims to bring about\nparticular outcomes—what roles people will play, what they will\nachieve in those roles, and what they will win by so achieving. By\ncontrast, in what we should call spontaneous order, government\nprovides a stable and known framework of rules, aiming not to realize\na particular outcome so much as to realize a particular process (Hayek\n1944, 113). Although this ideal can never be fully achieved in\npractice, a government under rule of law acts as referee and provider\nof the rule book (Hayek 1960, 114) and operates as much as possible by\nan ideal of “letting the players play.” \nIs letting the players play good? Necessarily good? Adam Smith might\nhave said no, as might Hayek. A praiseworthy rule of law—a\npraiseworthy market process— facilitates mutually\nbeneficial trade by internalizing externalities, by minimizing\ntransaction cost (especially when it comes to acquiring information),\nby minimizing opportunities to acquire people’s goods without\ntheir consent (thereby encouraging people to trade on\nagreeable—thus typically beneficial—terms), and by being\nextremely cautious about trying to do more than that. When a\ngovernment succeeds in doing that much, and further succeeds in\nrestraining itself from trying to do more, progress is the likely\nresult, which is not to say progress is guaranteed.  \nHayek had no particular complaint about providing public education or\nthe minimal elements of a welfare state, but not because such\ninstitutions are essential. Hayek would simply have said that such\ninstitutions need not devolve into central planning and thus need not\nbe antithetical to a free society. Issuing vouchers, for example, to\nsubsidize the purchase of epipens or education would to some extent\ndistort markets in the subsidized products (having an inflationary\nimpact on prices for those products) but it would not distort to the\nextent that price controls would. \nHayek was a consequentialist of sorts, as was Adam Smith, and yet\nHayek’s defense of economic freedom, like Smith’s, hints\nat a contractarian or deontological moral sensibility that regards the\nseparateness of persons as morally fundamental. Thus, for example,\nHayek says, “the test of the justice of a rule is usually (since\nKant) described as that of its universalizability” (Hayek 1969,\n168). As John Gray sees it, Hayek commended the laws of justice\n“as being the indispensable condition for the promotion of the\ngeneral welfare” but Hayek held, at the same time, that\n“an impartial concern for the general welfare is itself one of\nthe demands of universalizability” (Gray 1984, 65). \nIn service of the overall project of fostering the general welfare,\nthe point of law and legislation is to craft a framework such that a\nmarket order is a history of pareto-improving\n trades.[5]\n A primary role of law and (when necessary) legislation is to narrow\npeople’s options so as to limit opportunities to get rich at\nother people’s\n expense.[6]\n So long as the rule of law can internalize external cost and thereby\nsteer innovation in mutually beneficial rather than parasitic\ndirections, an evolving order will be an order of rising\nprosperity. \nBy contrast, in a planned order, even astute and conscientious\ndecisions by men of system are damaging in a particular way. Namely,\nto the extent that men of system become micro-managers, they are\nplayers rather than umpires. If bureaucrats start playing the\ngame—responding to ephemeral events with centralized fine\ntuning—then even if they play as cleverly as bureaucrats could\npossibly play, the fact remains that in consequence, the dispersed and\ntacit knowledge of ordinary buyers and sellers ends up on the\nsidelines watching. People who would have been job creators become\nmere spectators, hamstrung by uncertainty, waiting to see what the\nplan is going to be. Until they know the plan, they have no way to\nknow, or even intelligently guess, something as simple as whether\ntheir staff is too small or too large. \nGovernment provides the framework for interaction. Ideally, as\nmentioned, government operates only within a stable and known\nframework of rules (Hayek 1944, 113). This is Hayek’s ideal of\ngood government. Is it realistic? Could any government be expected to\nact as an impartial umpire? Hayek saw the rule of law as the\nmarket’s exogenous ecological niche, and thought that this\nniche, the rule of law, must be properly constructed if the process of\nspontaneous order is be a good thing. However, Hayek seemingly came to\ndoubt there could be any such thing as properly constructed rule of\nlaw, for the following reason. Law-making is a process driven by\nprocesses more or less indistinguishable from market process except\nthat benefits to legislators of their law-making are concentrated\nwhile costs are widely dispersed, that is to say, external, and at\nbest only dimly understood even after the\n fact.[7]\n This is not only a moral hazard but an information problem. A piece\nof legislation may be thousands of pages. No one intends the\nbill as a whole. Indeed, there is no overall point to the bill, known\nor otherwise, because, prior to passage, literally no one has even\nread more than a few pages of it, not even the hundreds of legislators\nwho each added a few pages of earmarks as the price of securing their\nvote. \nCommon law, by contrast, is a body of practice and tradition that\nsometimes needs to be supplemented by legislation. Crucially, however,\nby virtue of passing the test of time as a device for settling\ndisputes, common law cannot be seen as mere prejudice or superstition.\nOn the contrary, it will have a decided advantage over ongoing\nlegislation, given that legislation is driven by untested ideas about\nhow to respond to the crises of the day, needing to be passed without\nanyone knowing the larger and lasting consequences. Hayek never\ndoubted the need for legislation but lamented our propensity to be\noblivious to its inevitably unintended consequences and to radically\ndiscount its inevitably unseen cost (Hayek 1973, 86).  \nTo Hayek, it matters far more that the law be a framework for\ncoordination than exactly what the coordination points are (Hayek\n1960, 118). Hayek realizes that many coordination points have\ndistributive implications, which leads Hayek to lament our tendency to\nevaluate distributions by asking whether they are just. (Yet, Hayek\nconcedes, at least in principle, the legitimacy of a minimum income or\nwelfare safety net of some sort. See Tebble 2015 for a sympathetic yet\nacute argument that this concession on Hayek’s part is a\n“fatal ambivalence.” In fact, Tebble argues, Hayek’s\nrepudiation of social justice leaves him with no room to make any such\nconcession.)  \nHayek says, “one of my chief preoccupations for more than 10\nyears” has been coming to terms with the idea that social\njustice is a mirage (Hayek 1978b,\n 57).[8]\n By social justice, Hayek seems to mean distributive justice,\nand more specifically what Nozick called end-state principles of\ndistributive justice, which treat justice as a feature of outcomes\nrather than of procedures. \nWhy would justice so conceived be a mirage? Hayek says, “there\ncan be no distributive justice where no one distributes” (Hayek\n1978b, 58 or 1976, 68–69). In Hayek’s words,\n“considerations of justice provide no justification for\n‘correcting’ the results of the market” (1969, 175).\nSo long as traders are voluntarily making pareto-superior moves, there\nis nothing else that can be said or needs to be said by way of\njustification. \nWhy resist applying conceptions of justice and injustice to situations\nwhere no one distributes? What is haunting Hayek here is not the idea\nthat one person might be more deserving than another, but that a\n“merit czar” might presume to intervene so as to correct\nmarkets that fail to give people what the czar thinks people deserve.\nFearing the potential for tyranny, Hayek argues not that markets are\njust but that they are not the kind of thing that can be just or\nunjust. Where no one distributes, there may be something lamentable\nabout the result, but the result will not be an injustice in the way\nthat engineering such a result would be. Outcomes that would\nhave been unjust  if deliberately imposed (such as being born\nwith a cleft palate) sometimes simply happen. As Rawls says,\n“The natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it\nunjust that persons are born into society at some particular position.\nThese are simply natural facts.” Hayek would agree. \nRawls, however, immediately adds what Hayek would call a non sequitur:\n“What is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with\nthese facts” (Rawls, 1971, 102), where resigning ourselves to\nthe facts is the paradigmatically unjust way of dealing with them\n(ibid). If Rawls is right to deem the natural distribution neither\njust nor unjust, then when institutions “deal with natural\nfacts,” they are, to Hayek, not undoing wrongs. Hayek would\nnever deny that cleft palates are bad or that fixing them is good, but\nwould insist that fixing what is not unjust cannot count as rectifying\ninjustice. If we feel called upon to help children with cleft palates,\nit will be because having a cleft palate is bad, not because having it\nis unjust. When we help, we are not fixing an improper distribution of\ncleft plates. We are simply fixing cleft palates. When we respond to\nthe problem, we take a stand not against injustice but against\nsuffering (Hayek 1976, 87). As Hayek knew, he was profoundly at odds\nwith much thinking about social justice. He expected to be vilified\n(1944, vii), and he was. Although he was as responsive to misfortune\nas anyone, and seemed to embrace the same package of duties to\nchildren as any social justice theorist would, he also saw the free\nworld at a crossroads between a defeasible presumption that normal\nadults have agreed to share each other’s fate (Rawls, 1971, 102) and a\ndefeasible presumption that normal adults have the right and the\nresponsibility to play the cards that nature has dealt.  \nHayek seems to worry that our sense of justice can make it harder for\nus to live together, and make progress together. To Hayek, if people\ncannot claim that a starting point is unjust, then whatever we do must\nbe justified as an improvement, not as rectification. If\nthere is no injustice needing rectification, then the improvement we\nhave a right to strive for is pareto-improvement, or in any case,\nimprovement by mutually acceptable means. By contrast, if (contra\nRawls) the natural distribution were unjust, that would open the field\nto all of the zero-sum and negative-sum moves that people feel\nwarranted in imposing on each other under the guise of being fair. The\nright to make such moves with other people’s money becomes an\noverwhelmingly lucrative political football, luring a society’s\nentrepreneurial talent into politics, where instead of creating new\nsocial capital, entrepreneurs spend their time inventing clever new\nways of dividing it. (Rawls could note that money being in the\npossession of others does not entail that the money is rightfully\ntheirs, but Hayek is doing social science here. Hayek would not deny\nthe plain fact that people can and often do treat other people’s\npossessions as a political football, and sometimes even invent\ntheories according to which they have a right to do so. Hayek is\ntalking about the actual empirical cost of treating other\npeople’s possessions as a political football, not the\ntheoretical possibility.)  \nIn Hayek’s mind, we should want a system of justice to be a\nframework that helps us to coordinate on a set of mutual expectations\nthat we each find useful in helping us stay out of each other’s\nway as we each set a course for our individually chosen destinations.\nNo principle of justice would pick our destination for us. Neither\nwould it require us to justify our destination to others. Indeed, the\npremium would be on people not needing to justify themselves. If we\noperated by end-state principles of justice (Nozick 1974), we would\nneed to justify every move that bore on how goods would be distributed\nin the evolving end-state, which is to say we would need to justify\nvirtually every trade we contemplate, which would gridlock us rather\nthan facilitate our inventing new ways of making ourselves more\nvaluable to the people around us. \nPerhaps Hayek is overreacting here. In any case, some philosophical\ninterpretation is unavoidable, but this, arguably, accounts for\nHayek’s seemingly dogmatic dismissal of end-state principles of\njustice. For reasons reminiscent of Nozick’s, Hayek finds such\nprinciples unaffordable, and incompatible with autonomous agents\nminding their own business in a free society. Indeed such principles\nmake it impossible to say what could count as minding one’s own\nbusiness. In that respect, in trying to carve out a coherent realm of\nindividual autonomy, Hayek is, as he often claimed, paradigmatically a\nliberal, not conservative. \nMerit, as Hayek understands it, concerns the character of the action\nas opposed to the nature of the achievement (Hayek 1960, 94). In other\nwords, to Hayek, claims of merit concern the inputs one brings to a\nprocess, not the output. In Hayek’s mind, nothing good can come\nof that. In a free society, to Hayek, we are rewarded for our output,\nnot our input (Hayek 1960, 98). \nHayek has an important point. Among his core concerns is the\n“mirage” of thinking that justice requires rewarding\npeople for supplying inputs rather than for supplying outputs.\nAdmittedly, if we leave customers to their own devices, output is what\nthey will reward, which is what Hayek wants. By the same token, when\npeople left to their own devices choose to reward us for our output,\ntheir behavior will not be utterly insensitive to merit. The tendency\nof market rewards to track merit will be merely a tendency, but\nmeritocracy being merely a tendency is not the same as meritocracy\nbeing a mirage. A key element of the success of a system in promoting\nprosperity will be that in rewarding excellent output, it will be\nrewarding the hard work, courage, alertness, and commitment that makes\nfor excellence. It will be rewarding luck too, to be sure, but\ntypically not sheer random\n fluke.[9]\n Hayek speaks as if merit has everything to do with trying hard, and\nnothing to do with achieving excellence. \nHayek says we want to economize on merit (Hayek 1960, 96). If merit\nwere tied exclusively to supplying inputs, then Hayek would be right.\nBut even so, saying we economize on hard work is another way of saying\nhard work is important. It is not evidence that we are in the grip of\na mirage when we imagine that we have reason to reward hard work that\nculminates in excellent output. \nIn sum, a merit theorist might concede to Hayek that rewards ought to\ntrack actual performance, not inner merit. Customers can judge your\nproduct’s merits without needing to know whether you were lucky.\nThe crucial point is that wherever it is more rewarding to work hard\nthan not, more rewarding to do excellent work than not, more rewarding\nto be alert to customer needs than not, a system is tending to reward\nthe right things. In that system, output will tend to be increasingly\nexcellent over time. Products will tend to work. People will tend to\nprosper, and will tend to aim at being meritorious to boot. \nAs noted, Hayek’s critique of social justice is more\nspecifically a critique of centrally planned distribution according to\nmerit. He thinks a merit czar would be intolerable. However, what\nHayek found nightmarish about this vision clearly had more to do with\nan abhorrence of central planning than of the idea that it would be\ngood to have a way of rewarding merit. If Hayek is right that there is\nno place for centralized decisions about meritoriousness in a good\nsociety, then, contra Hayek, the implication is not that merit does\nnot matter but precisely that it does (Hayek 1976, 64). The problem\nwith merit czars in the world we know, Hayek seems to assume, is that,\nin a merit-based system, if you cannot prove you deserve G,\nthat licenses merit czars to redistribute from the less to the more\ndeserving. The point is crucial not because it refutes Hayek but\nbecause it reveals the exact nature of Hayek’s real concern.\nHayek’s core concern is not the mirage ofthinking merit\ndoes matter, but the mirage of thinking entitlement\n doesn’t.[10] \nNote the similarity between Hayek’s view and the view expressed\nby John Rawls in “Two Concepts of Rules” (1955). Hayek and\nRawls both understood what is involved in a practice having\nutility. To use Rawls’s example, the practice of baseball is\ndefined by procedural rules rather than by end-state principles of\ndistributive justice. To have a practice at all, we must be dogmatic\n(Hayek would say) about how many strikes a batter should get. \nImagine changing the concept of the game so that the umpire’s\njob is to make sure the good guys win. What would that do to the\nplayers? What would become of their striving? The result of the change\nwould not be baseball. If we end up with a game where the umpire is\nmaking sure the favored side wins, then the players are sitting on the\nsidelines watching, hoping to be favored. Hayek’s insight (and\nRawls’s insight at that stage of his career) is that genuine\nfairness is not about making sure prizes are properly\n distributed.[11]\n It is not even about making sure outcomes are not unduly influenced\nby morally arbitrary factors such as how well the players played or\nhow hard they worked to develop their talent. True fairness is about\nbeing impartial, nonpartisan—proverbially, “letting the\nplayers play.” \nOne of Hayek’s problems with the kind of justice that amounts to\nmaking sure the good guys win is that it tends to turn society’s\nbasic structure into a political football, which tends to squander\ngains from trade. To Hayek, again, true justice is about letting the\nplayers play, in the same way as pareto-improving economic\ncoordination is about letting the players\n play.[12] \nWhether we realize gains requires only that we trade, not that we\ntrade at any particular price. Thus, we don’t want to focus on\nprice when the wealth of nations has everything to do with gains from\ntrade and nothing to do with price. \nIndeed, Hayek observes, being obsessed with just price would make\ntrading less likely, which would tend to squander some of the\ncooperative surplus. Much of Hayek’s aversion to justice stems\nfrom a sense that (for thousands of years) talk of justice has had a\nway of turning into talk of just price (Hayek 1976, 73). This\nmakes prices appear morally important, which to Hayek is a\n mirage.[13]\n Of Adam Smith’s butchers and bakers, Hayek says, \nPrecisely because they were interested only in who would offer the\nbest price for their products, they reached persons wholly unknown to\nthem, whose standard of life they thereby enhanced much more than they\ncould have that of their neighbors… (Hayek 1978b, 60). \nHayek’s dismissal of social justice as a mirage is a\ngratuitously tendentious way of packaging his actual view. However,\nthe motive for his dismissal is understandable: namely his dread of\nthe prospect of licensing a justice czar to intervene to make sure\nprices are fair, thus derailing the wealth-creating spontaneous\ntrading of a free society within the rule of law. Paraphrasing Michael\nMunger (2013), the closest thing we have to an omniscient social\nplanner are the twin forces of supply and demand, but those forces\nspeak to people through prices. When the state makes it a crime to\ncharge what the market will bear, it can thereby become illegal for\ninsulin users to respond to a power failure by outbidding beer\ndrinkers for insulin-preserving ice as supply runs short. In a case\nlike that, the law has struck dumb the only voice that could give\npeople reliable, timely advice on how resources need to be allocated\nright now. This is Hayek’s ultimate concern throughout his writings,\nand it also underlies his otherwise ill-fitting polemic against social\njustice. To Hayek, it is simply a mirage to think fairness has\nanything to do with stopping the price mechanism from telling us where\nour services are most in need. \nHayek never doubts that we sometimes need legislation, but he thinks\nthe aim of legislation should be to make things better, not fairer; to\nmake things more productive, not more level; to channel innovative\nthinking in the direction of wealth creation, not wealth capture.\nHayek in fact endorses norms of pure procedural justice, and would\nagree that there is such a thing, after all, as fairness. True\nfairness, he would say, is about letting players play on a more or\nless level playing field, but he would insist that this is not about\nmaking sure everyone wins their share. Hayek saw a free society as one\nwhere people stand or fall on the basis of how well they perform, not\nhow hard they try—what they produce, not what they intend.  \nHayek’s economic education at the University of Vienna was\nwithin the law faculty. Hayek’s degrees were in political\nscience, jurisprudence, and economics. His dissertation work was on\nthe technical topic of the imputation of value in a capital-using\neconomy, and his early professional work focused on monetary theory\nand business cycle statistics. As with other scholars of the Austrian\nSchool of Economics, the institutional framework within which economic\nactivity takes place was never far from the foreground of even the\nmost technical economic analysis. Law, politics, and social mores all\nare critical to the way Austrian economists see economic forces\nplaying out in the real world.  \nCritical to the Austrian examination of the operation of the\ncompetitive market process is the primacy placed on property rights,\nrelative prices, and profit-and-loss accounting. The emphasis on\ninstitutional infrastructure informed Austrian perspectives on price\ntheory and the market system, on monetary and capital theory, and on\nobstacles to socialist economic planning in particular and to\ninterventionism more generally. To Hayek, the idea of prices without\nproperty is a grand illusion, and efforts to control economic activity\nthrough prohibitions and regulations are plagued by unintended\nconsequences and unforeseen costs. \nHayek’s growing frustration with the conversation among elite\neconomists during the 1930s and 1940s was born out his utter surprise\nthat the institutional wisdom passed down from classical political\neconomists to the early neoclassical economists was being lost. He saw\nwanted to know why. He explored the rise of formalism and an emerging\nshift toward macro-theory emphasizing relationships between aggregate\nvariables unconnected to the choices of individuals. To Hayek, these\nshifts were technical in part, but the technicality was masking (and\npartly driven by) a deeper philosophical shift from seeing the human\ncondition as complex as a relatively simple machine that a good\nmechanic could tinker with and perfect. The whole idea of studying the\nhuman condition as a complex spontaneous order came to seem\nunscientific. Thus, in “The Use of Knowledge in Society”,\nHayek says the maximizing and equilibrium thinking of mathematical\neconomics “habitually disregards” essential parts of the\nphenomena to be explained, and in so doing “misleads some of our\nleading thinkers” (1944, 91).  \nThe issue Hayek concerns himself with in The Counter-Revolution of\nScience was the wrong turn in the philosophy and history of ideas that\nconfused the current generation about the nature of the social\nsciences and the institutions of liberalism and the principles of\njustice. His sustained explorations of legal philosophy and political\ntheory sought to counter excessive formalism, excessive aggregation,\nand a naïve empiricism that in his mind conspired to produce the\nintellectual dead-end of scientism: that is, an inappropriate and\nuncritical application of the methods of the natural sciences to the\nproblems of social science. In articulating his critique, Hayek would\nstress over the next several decades the case for methodological\ndualism, and the method and approach for the sciences of complex\nphenomena. \nAs a student of the Austrian School of Economics, Hayek was a\nsubjectivist as well as a marginalist in his approach to studying\nhuman decision making. The value of goods and services resides in the\njudgment of the individual chooser, and is not inherent in the goods\nand services themselves. Neither are prices posted in the market\nmerely a summation of costs of production. Value, costs and the\nexpectations of individuals choosers are driven individual buyers and\nsellers assessing tradeoffs. (To give a concrete example, owners of\ngas stations may hike the retail price of gasoline in response to\nbreaking news of a supply problem in the middle east. The news does\nnot affect the price of gas already in their storage tanks, but it\ndoes affect their assessment of what the wholesale price of gasoline\nwill be next time they are buying new supplies so that they can stay\nin business. Retail customers see the hike as gouging because they\ndon’t understand that profit from current sales is what has to\npay for new supplies.) Thus, Hayek’s point in calling the valuation\nprocess subjective is not to say it is a matter of opinion. Rather, it\nis a process of perceiving reality as needing one response rather than\nanother.  \nEconomic science begins with purposeful human action. And, as social\nscientists we can interpret human action in terms of beliefs, desires\nand intentions. “To employ a useful metaphor,” Hayek\nargued, “while in the world of nature we look from the outside,\nwe look at society from the inside; while, as far as nature is\nconcerned, our concepts are about the facts and have to be adapted to\nthe facts, in the world of society at least some of the most familiar\nconcepts are the stuff from which the world is made” (1948,\n76). \nHayek’s mentor, Ludwig Mises, stated the argument as follows in\nhis treatise of economics, Human Action (1949, 92):\n“Economics is not about things and tangible material objects; it\nis about men, their meanings and actions. Goods, commodities, and\nwealth are all the other notions of conduct are not elements of\nnature; they are elements of human meaning and conduct. He who wants\nto deal with them must not look at the external world; he must search\nfor them in the meaning of acting man.” \nA favorite example among Austrian School economists was to imagine a\nscientist from Mars studying patterns in the New York subway Our\nscientific Martian will observe that at 8:00am that there will be\nbodies and boxes, and the boxes will pick up the bodies and move.\nThen, at 5:00pm, those boxes will come back to the same places and\nbodies will leave the boxes. This observer could develop a study of\nmoving boxes and bodies and offer predictions. But can our observer\ntruly understand the phenomena under investigation without reference\nto the purposes and plans of the actors involved, and thus rather than\nseeing boxes and bodies, we come to understand the pattern of action\nassociated with commuting to work. Fritz Machlup tried to capture this\nidea when he penned an essay under the title: “What if Matter\nCould Talk?” The social sciences are indeed engaged in\nscientific inquiry, but the subject of study was radically different\nbecause we are what we study. \nIn addition to the uniqueness of the human sciences, the Austrian\nSchool of Economics emphasized the passage of time, the uncertainty\ninherent in human decision making, and the complexity of the economic\norder. The complexity aspect is not new to the Viennese economists,\nbut can be seen in Adam Smith’s discussion at the beginning of\nThe Wealth of Nations of the division of labor and the\nspontaneous far-flung patterns of cooperation required to such mundane\nthings as a worker’s woolen coat. The number of exchanges, Smith\nstates, exceeds all computation. The Austrian School added to this\ncomputational complexity the idea of ceaseless change that requires\nconstant adaptation and adjustment to the shift in circumstances,\nincluding changes in tastes, technology and resource availability. The\nunderstanding of the price theory and the market system from the early\ndevelopment by Menger and Bohm-Bawerk, and the more mature formulation\nin Mises and Hayek argued that a proper understanding of the market\neconomy did not strive to depict the efficiency properties of the\nend-state, but the adaptive and learning aspects of the system.  \nHayek’s intellectual adversaries shifted in the second half of\nhis career, though of course there are common themes. But the German\nHistoricist and the Collectivist Positivist were no longer the\nanimating force they were in the first half of the 20th century.\nLogical positivism was also transformed. One of the remnants from the\ninfluence of Scientism, however, was in Hayek’s mind a failure\nto address the essential complexity of the social world. As a\nconsequence, his methodological writings in the 1960s and 1970s tend\nto stress not subjectivism and the human sciences, but the differences\nbetween the sciences of simple phenomena and the sciences of essential\ncomplexity. \nAgain, Hayek was born in 1899, and born in Vienna. That is to say,\nHayek grew up in a glorious age of Viennese culture only to see it\nevaporate before his eyes with WWI, the Great Depression, the rise of\nsocialism and fascism, WWII, and the Cold War. Hayek fought in WWI. He\nwas among those who left Vienna in the early 1930s never to return. He\nexperienced WWII in his adopted home of Great Britain. Like others of\nhis generation, these experiences were pivotal. He saw totalitarianism\ndistorting science and scholarship, as did two of his philosophical\nfriends: Michael Polanyi and Karl Popper. Despite their differences,\nHayek drew inspiration from and helped promote the work of Polanyi and\nPopper. Totalitarian systems inevitably end up being hostile to the\ncritical attitude at the heart of scientific inquiry. Hayek, Polanyi\nand Popper all saw this in the 1930s and 1940s, and in their separate\nways sought to describe and defend the science of a free society.","contact.mail":"pboettke@gmu.edu","contact.domain":"gmu.edu"}]
