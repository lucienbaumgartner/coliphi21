O. Wilson’s\nSociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975) as the\n“systematic study of the biological basis of all social\nbehavior” (Wilson, 1975, 4). Wilson seems to intend\n“the biological basis of behavior” to refer to the social\nand ecological causes driving the evolution of behavior in animal\npopulations, rather than the neurological or psychological causes of\nbehavior in individuals; however, Wilson clearly thought sociobiology\nand neuroscience would have important theoretical interactions (Wilson,\n1975, 5). Wilson’s references to evolution are also usually\nreferences to evolution by natural selection, although he does accept\nthat the action of selection on animal societies can result in\nmaladaptive outcomes at the level of populations (see, for example\nWilson, 1975, Chapter 4). \n\n\n\nOne possible meaning for “sociobiology”, therefore, is\nthat kind of work identified by Wilson in the non-human animal part of\nhis book: methodologically adaptationist approaches to understanding\nthe causes and nature of animal behavior. However, the term\n“sociobiology”, especially used of the work that Wilson\ndescribed in most of his book, was a neologism, and Wilson used it to\nrefer to work by scientists who did not use that term to refer to\nthemselves. Neither was the name “sociobiologist”\never universally accepted by such scientists. Instead, while a\nfew scientists continued to use the term “sociobiology” to\ndescribe their work (for example, Hrdy, 1999), during the controversy\nover sociobiology and after scientists using these approaches tended to\nuse other terms, most commonly “behavioral ecology” (Krebs\nand Davies, 1978).\n\n\n\nHowever, non-human animal behavior was not the only subject\naddressed in Sociobiology; famously, the first and last\nchapters of the book addressed Wilson’s views about the\namenability of human behavior to be studied by a similar sort of\nproject. These were developed to some extent in his later book,\nOn Human Nature (Wilson, 1978). For a variety of\nreasons, primarily because Wilson was perceived to be arguing that many\nproblematic social behaviors were unchangeable, the contents of these\ntwo chapters provoked an extremely acrimonious debate sometimes\nreferred to as the “sociobiology wars” (one well regarded\ndiscussion of the history and sociology of the “sociobiology wars”\nis Segerstrale, 2000). Because this debate attracted so much\nattention, the term “sociobiology” has come to be\nassociated with this early proposed human project, or at least\nthe description of it set up for attack by its critics (see, for\nexample, Allen et al., 1975; Caplan, 1979; Gould, 1977, 251–259; 1978;\nSociobiology Study Group of Science for the People, 1976). \nWilson’s proposed human project might be called “Pop\nSociobiology” after Kitcher (1985). The critics claimed\nthat “Pop Sociobiologists” were committed to a form of\ngenetic determinism, an overly strong adaptationism and had a tendency\nto ignore the effects of learning and culture.\n\n\n\nThe term “sociobiology” is also occasionally used to refer\nto current evolutionary approaches to human behavior, which\nretain the behavioral focus to which Wilson refers (Griffiths, 2008;\nSterelny and Griffiths, 1999). However, while influenced by the\nproject Wilson conceived, most modern projects studying the evolution\nof behavior seem to have developed a variety of theoretical and\nmethodological features of their own (Smith et al., 2001; Winterhalder\nand Smith, 1992); perhaps the best way to understand sociobiology in\nthis case is in “phylogenetic” terms, as a historical\nancestor of these projects. The “descendants” of\nsociobiology include human behavioral ecology and more\nrecently, dual inheritance theory (Boyd and Richerson, 1985;\nCavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981) and evolutionary psychology\n(Cosmides and Tooby, 1987). These projects as a group are now\nsometimes referred to as the “evolutionary social\nsciences” (Smith et al., 2001)[1].  \nOver time the different theoretical views\nand choices of methodology have become entrenched in each project,\nincreasing their disparity; the divisions also partly fall along\ndisciplinary lines, with anthropologists tending to be human\nbehavioral ecologists; psychologists tending to be evolutionary\npsychologists; and individuals with some background in population\nbiology modeling ending up in dual inheritance theory. All three\nprojects retain some of the features of Wilson’s original\nproject, however, in particular its methodologically adaptationist\napproach. Of these three, it is human behavioral ecology that is most\noften called “sociobiology” due to its focus on the\nevolution of behavior (evolutionary psychology focuses on the\nevolution of psychological mechanisms or modules such as those for\ncheater detection; dual inheritance theory studies the cultural\nevolution of traits that are socially learned). \n\n\n\nThis survey will, therefore, focus on three main meanings of\n“sociobiology”. First, it will briefly describe the\nnon-human animal behavioral ecology that Wilson described as\n“sociobiology”. Second, it will describe and evaluate\nthe characterization of “Pop Sociobiology” that came under\nattack by various scientists and philosophers in the mid to late 1970s.\nThird, it will describe the main features of current human behavioral\necology. The final section will discuss some of the central\ncriticisms raised for sociobiology and behavioral ecology in the\nliterature and explore some possible responses to these criticisms.\n\n\n\nThe first meaning of “sociobiology” is as Wilson’s\nown term for a range of work that is currently referred to (and was\nlargely referred to at the time) as behavioral ecology.\nBehavioral ecology is a science that uses evolutionary theory and\nespecially adaptationist methods to try to understand animal\nbehavior. Consider, for example the female parasitic jewel wasp. This\nwasp lives and lays its eggs in blowfly pupae; after a female wasp of\nthis species is born and reaches adulthood she mates with one of the\nmales also occupying her pupa, and then emerges and flies off to lay\nher eggs in another pupa. The jewel wasp is haplodiploid, and females\ncan control the sex of each of their offspring by controlling whether\nor not the egg is fertilized when she lays it. What is particularly\ninteresting about this wasp is that the percentage of females to males\nshe lays depends on whether she got to the pupa first. If she is first\nto the pupa she lays a number of eggs, with mostly females (about\n91.3%) and some males (about 8.7%). However, if she lays eggs in a\npupa after another female has been there (this is called\nsuperparasitism), she lays a lot more sons than daughters.\nBehavioral ecologists are interested in understanding why animal\nbehaviors like this have the peculiar features they do. \n\nBehavioral ecology is sometimes characterized in terms of its\nrelationships to the earlier “ethology” whose most famous\npractitioners are probably Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. \nTinbergen (1963) famously described four types of questions that an\nethologist might ask in trying to understand some pattern of animal\nbehavior, such as the egg laying strategy of the jewel wasp\nabove. First, the ethologist could ask questions about the\nproximate causes of the behavior: for example, what\nneurological or psychological mechanisms lead the wasp to lay her eggs\nin the pattern she does? What mechanisms are responsible for the\ndevelopment of that mechanism—what developmental\nprocesses build the neural tissue that directly causes the egg laying\nbehavior? Second, the ethologist could ask two ultimate,\nevolutionary questions about the behavior: what is the evolutionary\nfunction of the behavior, i.e. how does laying eggs in that\npattern contribute to the wasp’s reproductive success, to the\nreproductive success of its ancestors, and hence to the\nbehavior’s history of evolution by natural selection (if that is\nits history) in the jewel wasp population? Also, what is the\nphylogeny of the behavior, i.e. where did it arise in the\nevolutionary tree of the jewel wasp? \n\nUnlike ethologists, behavioral ecologists studying animal behavior at\nfirst tended to focus on the third question, the question of\nevolutionary function, at the expense of the others (Griffiths, 2008;\nKrebs and Davies, 1997). Griffiths (2008) has argued such a focus by\nthe behavioral ecologists on questions of function at the expense of\nquestions of causation, development and phylogeny (but especially\ndevelopment) was highly problematic, since the four questions cannot\nbe properly answered independently. Development constrains the\nevolution of biological traits in multiple ways, and behavior\nespecially, since behavior depends on development at both neurological\nand psychological levels. Behavioral ecologists, however, for a long\ntime took the complexity of the developmental resources contributing\nto behavior as a reason for (at least temporarily) avoiding such\nstudies as part of their study of the evolution of behavior. Grafen\n(1984) argues that the problem with developmental approaches to\nbehavior is that they are hard and lengthy to perform, especially if\nthe only or primary purpose of the developmental\nwork is to check that the trait in question does indeed have an\nevolutionary history that can be understood using adaptationist\nmethods. Grafen argues that if behavioral ecologists had to perform\ndevelopmental or psychological studies to be relatively confident of\ntheir conclusions about the evolutionary history of traits, they would\nprobably never get as far as evolutionary studies, since such\ndevelopmental and genetic work would take a very long time. Worse,\nsuch studies might well have no inherent interest of their own and\nrepresent a waste of time and resources for the scientist—not\nall traits have an interesting or enlightening developmental\nbackground or are produced by interesting and unknown psychological\nmechanisms. Instead, Grafen argues that behavioral ecologists should\nuse what he calls the “phenotypic gambit” in studying the\nevolution of behavioral traits. This involves assuming that the\ndevelopmental, psychological and genetic proximate causes of a\nbehavioral trait, such as the jewel wasp’s egg-laying strategy\nare of a type that will permit scientists to “pretend”\nthat they are very straightforward when building evolutionary models,\nand yet still end up with models that give approximately the right\nanswers about the primary processes, conditions and constraints acting\non that trait during its evolution (for another similar view see\nMaynard Smith, 1982, 6ff). \n\nSince Grafen wrote his article, however, there has been a certain\nshift in non-human behavioral ecology away from the phenotypic gambit\nand in favor of paying attention to proximate mechanisms, not simply\nbecause these enlighten whether a behavioral strategy could evolve by\nnatural selection in any particular case, but also the nature of the\nfitness costs and benefits that accrue to an organism sometimes depend\non how the adaptive problem they face is solved. For example, Lotem et\nal. (1995) appeal to the type of learning mechanism used by parenting\ngreat reed warblers to detect the presence of cuckoos in their nests:\nthis limits how reliable their detection of cuckoo eggs can be.\nSimilarly, Shuker and West (2004) argue that the constraints on the\negg laying strategy of the parasitic jewel wasp cannot be properly\nunderstood without paying attention to the limits on the detection\nmechanisms the wasp uses to determine the presence or absence of\nother females, versus other females’ eggs in\neach area. \n\nPerhaps the most important analytical tool of the behavioral\necologist is the optimality model (Maynard Smith, 1978):\nhowever, frequency dependent models, which do not assume population\nfixation of a trait, such as evolutionary stable strategy models\n(Maynard Smith, 1982) (see also the entry on\n evolutionary game theory)\nand dynamic models, such those employed in studying\nlife history traits (Roff, 1992), are also used. Optimality\nmodels are designed to show which of a set of possible variant\nbehavioral strategies would maximize a local fitness\n currency[2]\nunder a range of ecological conditions\nand constraints implicitly or explicitly represented in the\nmathematical structure of the model. These conditions are\nsupposed to represent the selection conditions of the trait\n(the conditions responsible for driving its evolution by natural\nselection – Brandon, 1990); however, they are usually derived by\nobserving the conditions under which the organism is currently living,\nsince these are assumed generally to have remained much the same as the\nconditions under which the organism evolved (Turke, 1990). Werren\n(1980) provided just such a model for the jewel wasp above; the model\nsuggests that the reason for the change in the ratio of sons to\ndaughters when a female wasp finds an occupied pupa is due to the\npotential opportunity to mate with the daughters of the first wasp. If\nonly the first wasp lays her eggs on the pupa, then the hatching\ndaughters mate with their brothers and all their offspring are entirely\ndescendants of the first wasp. This means the first wasp needs to\nproduce very few sons—only enough to mate with all the females;\nthe second generation reproductive success of the first wasp is\nmaximized by maximizing the number of daughters. However, where\nthere is a superparasitic wasp, the superparasitic wasp’s sons\ncan mate with the large numbers of daughters of the first wasp. \nThe superparasitic wasp needs to maximize the number of the females in\nthe pupa that breed with her sons as opposed to their brothers, whilst\nat the same time limiting the amount of competition amongst her\nsons. So if she has only a few eggs to lay, it makes sense for\nher to lay almost all sons; as brood sizes grow larger, it makes sense\nto gradually increase the proportion of daughters in the mix. \nWerren calculated the optimal percentages of males and females for each\nbrood size. His observations of male to female ratios fit the\npredictions of this model quite well but not perfectly. \n\nThere is some debate among various philosophers and behavioral\necologists about what exactly optimality models like Werren’s are\nbeing used to demonstrate. Orzack and Sober (1994) claim that\nbehavioral ecologists like Werren use optimality models to demonstrate\nthat the traits in question are adaptations, i.e. that the traits have\nevolved by natural selection. Furthermore, Orzack and Sober take\noptimality models to be censored models, that is, they are\ndesigned to determine the outcome of natural selection in a population\nwhere natural selection is the only important force, and hence show,\ngiven the model correctly predicts the observed features of the trait\nbeing studied, that natural selection was the most important force in\nits\n evolution[3].\nThe idea\nthen, is that the relative success of Werren’s model is supposed\nto demonstrate that natural selection was the most important force in\nthe evolution of the jewel wasp’s egg-laying strategy—other\nforces may have been involved, but they are not as causally\nimportant. However, various other philosophers have argued that\nsuch models do not make such strongly adaptationist assumptions;\nPotochnik (2009), for example, argues that optimality models are only\ndesigned to show the general role that natural selection and other\nforces (such as developmental constraints) are playing, and are not\ndesigned to test strong adaptationist hypotheses about the behavioral\nstrategies in question—i.e. in our case above, the success of the\nmodel is intended to show that natural selection was acting on the\njewel wasp’s strategy, and that the way it was acting on\nthe jewel wasp’s strategy was via the effects of competition\nbetween the male wasps in the pupa, the variations in brood size and\nthe other conditions and constraints to which Werren’s model\nappeals. The success of the model is not intended to\nshow that natural selection was the only important force involved in\nthe evolution of the jewel wasp’s strategy. For other criticisms\nof the censored model view, see Rice (2012) and Bolduc and Cezilly\n(2012). \n\nHowever, interestingly, some behavioral ecologists have claimed that\nthey do not use optimality models to test whether or not natural\nselection is acting on a trait, but instead assume the operation of\nnatural selection in order to test hypotheses about the conditions and\nconstraints acting on the trait (Parker and Maynard Smith, 1990). \nThis could be problematic, if it means behavioral ecologists baldly\naccept the view that natural selection optimizes most traits and never\nproperly test this claim. However, one interpretation of Parker\nand Maynard Smith (1990) is not that behavioral ecologists have an\nunfalsifiable commitment to the idea that natural selection is an\noptimizer. Instead, they are claiming that testing hypotheses\nabout the operation of natural selection itself is not what the\nbehavioral ecologists are focusing on. The behavioral ecologists are\nmaking the preliminary assumption that a trait is an adaptation in\norder to test other hypotheses about it—they “pretend as\nif” the trait were an adaptation, and use that assumption to\ndetect deviations from optimality that might reveal\ninteresting tradeoffs and constraints—the nature of the deviation\ncan suggest what might be missing from the model. This of course\nhas the upshot that when the models initially fail, the scientists do\nnot look for alternative non-adaptationist hypotheses, but instead\ninitially look for new constraints, tradeoffs and conditions\nunder which selection might be operating. For example, Giraldeau\n(1997) describes deviations from optimality in the evolution of\nphotopigments in the rods (as opposed to cones) in the retinas of fish\nthat live in certain sorts of marine environments where a shift in\nphotosensitivity would be useful; Giraldeau uses this deviation to\nsuggest the presence of a molecular constraint on the evolution of the\nrod cells. Presumably, repeated failures to find ways to fill in\nthe gaps in these optimality models could ultimately result in the\nscientists concerned considering alternative, non-adaptationist\nexplanations. So in order for the behavioral ecologists do this\nwork they do not need to be committed to the strong view that natural\nselection is always the most important force in the origin of traits;\nthis heuristic requires at most the view that natural selection usually\nlocally optimizes (i.e. optimizes only relative to possibly\nsevere constraints).  \n\nHowever, another way to understand how the behavioral ecologists are\nusing optimality models, one that is not so often considered, is that\nthey are interested in providing a functional description of\nthe traits they are studying (Kitcher, 1987; see also Bolduc and\nCezilly, 2012, for a similar view in terms of decision patterns rather\nthan behavioral strategies). One of the things that may concern a\nbehavioral ecologist is how exactly to describe the nature of the\nbehavior that they are considering: what component behavioral\ndispositions (from among all of the organism’s behavior) make up\neach strategy, and how those dispositions hang together as an\nadaptation. They need to give a description of the relationship\nbetween the organism’s behavior and its environment, and how it\ncontributes to the organism’s fitness. In the jewel wasp case,\nthe behavioral ecologists have observed the wasps lay different egg\nsex ratios on different occasions. The question is how to make sense\nof these different sex-ratio laying behaviors: the guess is that these\ndifferent behaviors hang together somehow, as manifestations of a\nparticular egg-sex-ratio adjusting strategy; and that having this\nparticular strategy, this particular pattern of egg-sex-ratio laying\nbehavior, does something for the female wasp when considered\nas a whole. But why should a behavioral ecologist accept that any\nparticular such a functional description is true? \n\nAn optimality model can allow a behavioral ecologist to find and\ntest such a functional description in two ways. First, an\noptimality model (explicitly or implicitly) includes a strategy\nset, which is a set of descriptions of possible behavioral\nstrategies; the model picks out one of these strategy descriptions as\nthe one that is maximally adaptive. On Werren’s model, the\nstrategy set would be an (implicit) set of descriptions of the range of\npossible sex-ratio adjusting strategies that a jewel wasp could use\n(i.e. each strategy involves a different set of choices about sex\nratios in a full range of relevant conditions like parasitism,\nsuperparasitism and different brood sizes). The idea is that an\noptimality model can pick out which member of this set is a description\nof the maximally adaptive strategy – on this view of what the\nbehavioral ecologists are doing, Werren’s model is designed to\npick out the optimal sex ratio egg laying strategy description from the\nstrategy set. The hypothesis is that this description of the\nmaximally adaptive strategy will be the correct\ndescription of what the wasp is doing. If it is the correct\ndescription, then Werren can now predict what son/daughter ratios he\nshould see the wasp lay in cases so far unobserved. These predictions\nallow him to test if the description is correct – if these predictions\nare true, then on this view, Werren has confirmed that the description\nof the particular sex-ratio adjusting strategy derived from his model\nis the correct description of what the wasp is doing. \n\nSecond, the description of the strategy picked out by the model is\nnot simply a description of it as a series of behavioral dispositions\n(i.e. dispositions to lay different sex ratios under different\nconditions), but of the relationships between those dispositions and\nvarious ecological features that determine the fitness of those\ndispositions. For example, in the jewel wasp case, the presence\nof other female competitors, flexibility in brood size, the capacity of\nsons to mate multiple times, the impossibility of migration of sons\nbetween pupae and so on, are features of the environment that determine\nwhether any potential egg laying strategy of the jewel wasp is\nmaximally adaptive, and a well confirmed optimality model can show\nhow. Consequently, contingent on obtaining the appropriate\nevidence that this is the correct model, the description of the\nstrategy given by a successful model is (implicitly or explicitly) a\nfunctional description of the strategy—a description of\nhow the behavior contributes to the fitness of the organism. For\na more detailed discussion of the role of optimality modeling in\nbiology, see the entry on\n adaptationism. \n\nThe second way that “sociobiology” has come to be\nunderstood is as a particular approach to understanding specifically\nhuman behavior which Philip Kitcher (1985) calls “Pop\nSociobiology” (as opposed to his description of \n“narrow sociobiology” which is roughly equivalent to\n“behavioral ecology” above). Pop Sociobiology is\nso-called because it is a view about how to study human behavior\ndescribed in a variety of literature written by Wilson\nand\n others[4]\nfor a general, rather\nthan an academic audience. In this literature, Wilson and the\nother “Pop sociobiologists” present some speculative\nand\n preliminary[5]\nsketches of how an\nevolutionary science of human behavior might proceed: Wilson’s\nmain focus in On Human Nature (Wilson, 1978) and to a lesser\nextent the last chapter of Sociobiology (Wilson, 1975) \nis to show that such a science is possible, to describe some of the\ntechniques that might be used in pursuing it, and to sketch some\npossible evolutionary analyses for certain particular human\nbehaviors. Because of its presentation in the popular press,\n“Pop Sociobiology” was probably important in shaping\npopular perceptions of the nature of sociobiology (for example, the\nTime article, “Why you do what you do” 1977, \n110 (Aug 1), 54) and consequently\ndrew the ire of the critics. Unfortunately, the intensity of this\ndebate may have led to a certain amount of mischaracterization of the\nsociobiologists’ views. This section will address the main\nconcerns that the critics raised about Wilson’s early\n“Pop” sociobiology, and discuss whether and how far these\nare fair descriptions of his views. \n\nGenetic determinism. In a variety of articles major\ncritics of sociobiology such as Stephen J. Gould (1977, 251–259; 1978)\nand the so-called “Sociobiology Study Group” (hereafter\nSSG) (Allen et al., 1975; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976) claim that sociobiologists are strong genetic\ndeterminists. For example, according to the SSG Wilson believes\nthat there are particular genes “for” behavioral traits,\nincluding indoctrinability, territoriality, warfare and reciprocal\naltruism, and that these genes are subject to natural selection in a\nrelatively straightforward way. Indeed, the SSG (1976) argue that\nclaiming that traits have a selective origin requires that there are\ngenes “for” them; Wilson’s apparent acceptance that\ntraits may often have a strong cultural component is said to be an\nerror, since if this is true then evolutionary theory tells us nothing\nabout the origin of such traits. Gould (1977) similarly claims\nthat sociobiologists do not realize that genes only produce traits with\na contribution from the environment. \n\nBoth of these claims are believed, even by other critics, to be\nunfair analyses of the views of the sociobiologists, and especially\nWilson—for example, Kitcher, one of the strongest critics of\nsociobiology, takes Gould and the SSG to task on this point (Kitcher,\n1985, 22–23). In On Human Nature Wilson describes genes as,\nessentially, difference makers—he explicitly claims that\ndifferences in genes, even for heritable traits, only explain the\nvariance in traits across a population; they are by no means\nindependent causes for any trait in individuals and variation in the\nenvironment also accounts for part of the variation in any trait\n(Wilson, 1978, 19). In at least one paper responding to the SSG\nWilson says that, on the question of the relative contributions to the\nvariation in human behavior from variation in genes vs. variation in\nthe environment, his “own views lie closer to the\nenvironmentalist than the genetic pole” (Wilson, 1976, 183).\nWilson also does seem to be trying to support his claim that there are\nsome human behaviors which are probably highly heritable: he describes a\nvariety of different sorts of evidence that might identify them. \nThis evidence includes cross cultural appearance (e.g. Wilson, 1975,\n550; Wilson, 1978, 20, 129); plausible homology with other closely\nrelated species (especially chimpanzees) (e.g. 1978, 20, 27, 151);\nearly development of the trait in question (e.g. 1975, 551; 1978, 129);\ndifferences between individuals that arise without differences in their\ndevelopmental environment (e.g. 1978, 128–130); genetic syndromes that\ncause behavioral differences (e.g. 1978, 43–45); and twin studies (e.g.\n1978, 145). Finally, Wilson claims that trying to change human\nbehavior from its heritable form usually fails or causes misery\n(Wilson, 1978,\n 20)[6];\nhe\ndescribes the failures of certain attempts to change the features of\nnormal human behavior by massively changing the social environment,\nsuch as the persistence of family ties under slavery (Wilson, 1978,\n136) and in the Israeli kibbutzim (1978, 134). Of course, whether\nor not all of the above is good evidence for his claims is very much up\nfor debate (Kitcher, 1985; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976). It is worth bearing in mind that while Wilson thinks the\nevidence that some human behaviors are heritable is overwhelming\n(Wilson, 1978, 19) he does see many of his specific proposed\nevolutionary explanations as preliminary and speculative rather than\nfully formed (for example, Wilson is explicit that his discussion of\nhomosexuality is preliminary: 1978, 146). For more discussion of the\nproblems relating to heritability when studying the evolution of \nbehavior, see section 4.2. below and the entry on\n heritability. \n\nIgnoring learning and culture. As a concomitant of the\nobjection that Pop Sociobiology was committed to genetic determinism,\nits central players are also often accused of being insensitive to the\nproblem of learning and culture, i.e. to the problem that many traits\nin which they are interested are simply not subject to natural\nselection at all, and that this state of affairs may indeed be common\nin humans (Kitcher, 1985; Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the\nPeople, 1976). However, Wilson, for example, clearly recognized\nthe important role of culture in many behavioral traits (Wilson, 1976);\nindeed, he thought that even minor genetic differences that made a\ndifference in behavior could be exaggerated by acquired\nculture—this is the so-called “multiplier effect”\n(although it is seriously in question whether the multiplier effect\nworks – Maynard Smith and Warren, 1982). Furthermore, partly in\nresponse to these concerns on the part of his critics Wilson eventually\nwent on to publish Genes, Minds and Culture with Charles\nLumsden (Lumsden and Wilson, 1981), which was an attempt to consider\nthe effects of cultural transmission on the nature and spread of\nbehavioral traits, and of the interaction between genes and\nculture. The book, however, was subject to heavy criticism (see,\nfor example, Kitcher, 1985; Lewontin, 1981; Maynard Smith and Warren,\n1982). The main concern raised was that there was little\nsubstance in the models the book provided—the most interesting\nfeatures of these simply followed from the assumptions built into them,\nin particular, assumptions about the degree to which genes kept culture\n“on a leash” (Lumsden and Wilson, 1981, 13; Wilson, 1978,\n167).  \n\nStrong adaptationism. The third problematic feature\nascribed to Pop Sociobiology was its reliance on an overly strong form\nof adaptationism. In both papers by the SSG (1976) and by Gould\nand Lewontin in their famous “Spandrels of San Marco” paper\n(Gould and Lewontin, 1979), the critics of sociobiology argue that\nsociobiologists are committed to a “Panglossian”\nadaptationism. While the “Spandrels” paper is\ndirected at “adaptationists” generally, sociobiologists\nwere some of its clear targets (for example, David Barash’s\n(1976) work on jealousy in male bluebirds).  \n\nThe central accusations of the “Spandrels” paper were as\nfollows: that adaptationists treat all traits as adaptations; that when\n“atomizing” individuals into traits to study they take no\ncare to establish that the traits so atomized could actually\nindependently evolve by natural selection; that they ignore\ndevelopmental constraints on evolution; that they fail to identify\ntraits that are prevalent due to causes other than natural selection;\nthat they fail to distinguish between current adaptiveness and a past\nhistory of natural selection; that they generate adaptationist\nhypotheses, fail to test them properly and replace one such hypothesis\nwith another, ignoring other interesting kinds of evolutionary and\nnon-evolutionary explanation. Instead, according to Gould and\nLewontin, adaptationists tell purely speculative, untestable\n“just so” stories and present them as science fact. \n\nAgain, insofar as Wilson and the other sociobiologists are being\npurely speculative this criticism may be warranted: quite a lot of the\nevolutionary explanations of particular human behaviors Wilson\ndescribes in the first and last chapters of Sociobiology and\nin On Human Nature are speculation on his part\n(although not entirely speculation). Perhaps the speculative\nadaptationist stories are appropriately described as “just so\nstories”; the question is whether such stories, treated\nas preliminary hypotheses, are problematic in themselves. \nFurthermore, while Wilson made no attempt to test any of his\nspeculative hypotheses, behavioral ecologists do try to test\nadaptationist hypotheses about humans and other animals. Again,\nthe proper question is whether these tests are appropriate or\nsufficient to establish the truth of the hypotheses in question. \nGould and Lewontin do, however, make some more sophisticated objections\nto adaptationist methods; some of these will be discussed in Section\n4. \n\nHuman behavioral ecology (HBE), or human evolutionary ecology, is\nthe current evolutionary social science most closely related to the\noriginal sociobiological project; it is the project that is sometimes\nstill referred to as “sociobiology” by some philosophers of\nscience (Griffiths, 2008; Sterelny and Griffiths, 1999). \n“Sociobiology” is most often used this way as a term of\ncontrast with “evolutionary psychology”, another current\nevolutionary social science project inspired by early sociobiologists,\nand also much developed from how early sociobiology was conceived: see\nthe entry on\n evolutionary psychology\nfor a discussion. Other common names for HBE are\n“evolutionary anthropology” (Smith, 2000) or \n“Darwinian ecological anthropology” (Vayda, 1995) (due to\nmost of its practitioners having a background in, or being based in\nanthropology departments, and using anthropological fieldwork as the\nmain means of testing their hypotheses about human behavior). The\ndifferent names tend to be used when the researchers concerned are\nemphasizing the connections of their field with anthropology or with\nnon-human behavioral ecology. HBE has a great deal in common with\nthe non-human behavioral ecology described above. In particular,\nit shares its focus on behavior, rather than the psychological\nmechanisms described in evolutionary psychology. Unlike non-human\nbehavioral ecology it has continued to use Grafen’s (1984)\nphenotypic gambit, in that its practitioners usually do not attempt to\ndiscover or describe the genetic or other resources employed in the\ndevelopment of the behavior in which they are interested; nor, for that\nmatter, do they usually attempt to discover the underlying\npsychology. There are, however, some differences of emphasis, in\nthat the questions about human behavior addressed by the human\nbehavioral ecologists (HBEs) are sometimes different from those\naddressed by the non-human behavioral ecologists. \n\nThe central purpose of the HBE approach is to use the assumption\nthat human behavioral strategies are adaptations as a heuristic to\nidentify the evolutionary and current local ecological causes of\nvariation in human behavior. Once nice standard example of HBE\nreasoning is Hillard Kaplan and Kim Hill’s (1992) work on prey\nchoice strategies amongst the Ache foragers of Paraguay. The idea\nhere is that the Ache’s prey choice strategy is a local\nmanifestation of a larger human behavioral adaptation for prey choice:\nby making this assumption, Kaplan and Hill can use the Ache prey choice\nbehavior as a way of both determining which conditions led to the\nevolution of the larger prey choice strategy and determining\nwhat causes the Ache to choose the prey they do in their local\nenvironment. \n\nJust as in non-human behavioral ecology, behavioral strategies in\nHBE are usually described as complex behavioral dispositions. \nBehavioral dispositions involve behavioral responses to local stimuli;\nbehavioral strategies then involve producing a set of different\nresponses to a set of different stimuli (we might call this set of\nstimuli the response conditions of the strategy). \nAccording to Kaplan and Hill, the Ache prey choice strategy involves\nchoosing a variety of different potential prey items from the\nenvironment; whether or not a prey item is taken depends on a number of\ncircumstances acting as the response conditions: for example, the\npresence of prey with certain specific features, such as the caloric\nreturn of the prey given the time necessary to process it (known as the\nprofitability); the rate at which that prey occurs in the environment;\nwhether or not the prey is encountered on their search; and the search\ntime available on a foraging trip. HBEs usually describe\nbehavioral strategies in terms of an “epigenetic” or\ndecision rule, which is usually given as a mathematical function\nmapping values for the response conditions onto the appropriate\nvalues for the parameters of the behavioral output. Kaplan and\nHill’s work also provides such an epigenetic rule (see Kaplan and\nHill, 1992, 170), which describes the relationships between search\ntime, profitability and so on, to decide which prey will be taken on\nencounter when the Ache are out foraging.  \n\nThe prey choice strategy as a whole (i.e. not, for example, the\nAche’s specific, locally appropriate set of prey\nchoices, but the general human prey choice strategy of which they are a\nmanifestation) is also presumed for heuristic purposes to be an\nadaptation to conditions in the past that led to that strategy being\nselected for; these are the selection conditions for the\nstrategy. Supposing that it is reasonable to take behavioral\nstrategies as such to be able to be adaptations (see the later\ndiscussion in section 4) the selection conditions of a given behavioral\nstrategy will usually include the response conditions (because\npresumably it takes the production of overt behavior in order for\nselection to act on a behavioral strategy) but possibly also features\nof the larger context which made it highly adaptive to respond in that\nway to those response conditions. In other words, in the prey\nchoice case, profitabilities, prey densities and search time\navailability would presumably have been among the selection conditions\nof a prey choice strategy (presuming it is an adaptation). But so\nwould larger details about the environment not explicitly included in\nthese models, such as the limits on human capacity which determine\nwhich prey are accessible in that environment, the ecology which\ndetermines which prey are in the environment, and so on. HBEs are\ninterested, therefore, in identifying the selection conditions of human\nbehavioral strategies generally. \n\nHowever, HBEs are anthropologists, and hence also want to describe\nthe local causes of the highly various overt behaviors that humans\nengage in; this can be done by identifying the local manifestations of\nthe response conditions of the strategies those humans are using. \nIdentifying these response conditions is a matter of identifying the\ncorrect functional description of those strategies (Kitcher,\n1987). So how might such strategies he described? It is\nworth pointing out that this is quite difficult to do: what HBEs\nobserve in the field is sets of overt behaviors in a context of a\nvariety of ecological conditions any of which could be the response\nconditions. It may be far from obvious exactly why those\nbehaviors are occurring, and which local conditions are the stimuli to\nwhich the behavior is a response. Indeed, it may not even be\nobvious which overt behaviors are manifestations of the same\nstrategy. In the Ache case, what Kaplan and Hill observed is not\na complete prey choice strategy, but a variety of occasions on which\nindividuals or groups of Ache people took or did not take prey they\nencountered whilst out foraging, among many other sorts of foraging and\nother types of behaviors. The question is which, if any, of the\novert behaviors on these occasions manifested a single prey choice\nstrategy, and how these overt behaviors are related to each other and\nto the environmental conditions in which they occur. \n\nThe idea seems to be this: if human behavioral strategies are\nadaptations, then the relationships between behavioral responses and\nlocal ecological conditions that resemble those of the human\nevolutionary past can be expected to be locally optimal, ceteris\nparibus; this means that the response conditions of the strategy\nwill (allegedly) be those (along with additional plausible selection\nconditions) that made the behavior fitness maximizing in the\nenvironment in which it evolved, and in any environment that is\nrelevantly similar (Irons, 1998). HBEs, like behavioral\necologists studying non-human animals, tend to use optimality modeling\nto determine which strategy would be maximally (if locally) fitness\nmaximizing in the conditions under which it evolved. Just as in\nnon-human behavioral ecology, the model will identify a strategy,\nincluding the response conditions and the various overt behavioral\nresponses to them, which would maximize fitness under a set of proposed\nselection conditions in the evolutionary past. These selection\nconditions may be either explicit or implicit in the model or the\nmodel’s assumptions. \n\nThis raises the question of how to choose the right model. In\ncases where the structure of the problem might be unique to the human\ncase and where the current environment is expected to be different from\nthe situation under which the strategy originally evolved, the model\nHBEs choose will often be unique and at least some of the proposed\nselection conditions identified by appealing to information about the\nfossil record. A nice example might be human life history, where\nthe human situation is relatively unique: for example, compared to\nother primates humans have unusually long lives and childhoods, and\nlong life after menopause. As a consequence, the human behavioral\necologists have to appeal to the fossil record in detail to determine\nwhat sorts of evolutionary transitions might have been involved\n(Hawkes, 2003; Kaplan et al., 2000). Where the structure of the\nadaptive problem humans face and the conditions acting on their\nbehavior is expected to mirror those in non-human animals and to be\nvery similar to those humans encountered in their evolutionary past,\nthe choice of model is often a standard one from non-human behavioral\necology; the proposed selection conditions can be based on the current\nconditions observed in foraging societies. In the Ache foraging\ncase, this is exactly what happens: the prey choice models used by\nKaplan and Hill are those used to understand similar sorts of\nstrategies in non-human animals. This is because Kaplan and Hill expect\nthe relevant conditions acting on human prey choice to mirror very\nclosely those acting on non-human animals. The primary issue for\nprey choice strategies is whether, when encountering a potential prey\nitem when out foraging, to take and capture or collect that prey item\nor whether your caloric return on time invested would be maximized by\nignoring it and continuing to search for something else with a higher\nprofitability. In cases where other potential foods have much\nhigher profitabilities or sufficiently high rates of encounter, this\ncan be the case. The strategy is then a matter of constructing a\n“diet”—those prey items that are always taken when\nencountered. This is done by ordering prey items in order of\nprofitability. Then the most profitable prey should be added to\nthe diet. The next step is to calculate the average foraging return\nrate (in calories per hour) obtained by just searching for the most\nprofitable item, given its profitability, how often it is encountered,\nand the caloric cost of the search itself. If the foraging return\nrate (in calories per hour) with just that item is less than the\nprofitability (in calories per hour) of the second highest\nprofitability item, then the second highest item should be added to the\ndiet; the new average foraging return rate with both the first and\nsecond highest profitability items should then be calculated. \nThen that new average foraging return rate should be compared with the\nprofitability of the third highest profitability item—and so on\nuntil all remaining potential prey have lower profitabilities than the\naverage foraging return rate with all the items currently in the\ndiet. The idea is that a forager maximizes caloric return per\nhour by taking only those items on encounter that are in the diet and\nignoring everything else.  \n\nFinally, therefore, the HBEs will seek to test their optimality\nmodel. The description of that strategy picked out by the model\nwill usually include descriptions of potential behavioral responses to\nconditions (or values for parameters of those responses) that go beyond\nwhat has already been observed; this means the model predicts that\nthese responses should also occur if the description of the strategy is\ncorrect. For example, in Kaplan and Hill’s prey choice case, the\nmodel predicts patterns of Ache prey choice that the observers had not\nyet seen, such as which prey the Ache should and should not take on\nencounter and under what circumstances. The model, therefore, can be\ntested by looking for a situation in which the response conditions of\nthe strategy obtain and observing whether the behavior in response to\nthose conditions is as the model suggests. This is partly why\nsuch rules are tested in foraging societies—because many of these\nstrategies have response conditions which reflect conditions presumed\nto be present in the human evolutionary past, and which may obtain in\nforaging societies but not in modern societies. For example,\nobviously in Kaplan and Hill’s foraging case, few if any modern\nor even small scale agricultural societies routinely engage in foraging\nthat is a primary source of nutrition, and hence don’t present an\nopportunity for individuals to do prey choice of the right\ntype. The other reason for performing these tests in foraging\nsocieties is because the HBEs want to understand the local causes of\novert behavior in these societies in particular.  \n\nIf the strategy is as described, the HBEs take the model to be\nconfirmed, and thereby also the trait description the HBEs are\nusing. Consequently (since these are given by the trait\ndescription) so will the nature of the local causes of the\nlocal overt behavior the behavioral ecologists are interested\nin explaining (in the Kaplan and Hill case, the causes of the\nAche’s prey choice behavior); and so will the proposed\nexplanation for the origin of the behavioral strategy in terms of the\npast selection conditions the model employs (in the Kaplan and Hill\ncase, the adaptationist explanation of prey choice in terms\nof profitabilities, prey distribution and so on).  \n\nDifferences between the predicted and described behavioral\nstrategies require scientists to build new models, or suggest\nadditional conditions or constraints to add to the original models;\nthere must be independent evidence that these conditions or constraints\nobtain. Kaplan and Hill’s observations do depart from what\ntheir model predicts: the Ache engage in a number of prey choice\ndecisions that are not obviously fitness maximizing. In\nparticular, men often seem to ignore many calorie rich food sources\nfrom plants and sometimes smaller animals, and women do not pursue\nlarger game. The question then is how to proceed: HBEs often\nsuggest changes to the model that might account for these failures of\nprediction; often, they do give some independent evidence for their\nsuggestions. For example, one of Hawkes’ proposed\nexplanations for why male hunting behavior often fails to meet prey\nchoice expectations (similar failures are found in many societies\nbesides the Ache) is that men pursue large game for reasons other than\nmerely collecting calories—they are also interested in showing\noff in order to get other fitness rewards, such as additional sexual\npartners or better alliances with other men. Hawkes was able to\nshow that men’s prey choice decisions were consistent with this\nview (Hawkes, 1991). \n\nThere are a number of philosophical criticisms of behavioral ecology\nand its methods; this section will address some of these\ncriticisms.  \n\nPerhaps the most important of all of the criticisms of “Pop\nSociobiology” was that it was excessively adaptationist; similar\nsorts of criticisms are leveled at modern descendants of sociobiology,\nsuch as behavioral ecology. Behavioral ecologists, including\nHBEs, are really methodological adaptationists (Godfrey Smith, 2001),\nin that they assume that natural selection is optimizing the trait they\nare studying as a heuristic, in order to establish other things about\nthat trait; as such, no strong commitment about the power of natural\nselection is necessarily required on their part (as discussed\nearlier). This did lead many behavioral ecologists to regard\nGould and Lewontin’s (1979) criticisms as a cautionary tale,\nrather than as properly directed at them—see, for example, Gould\nand Lewontin’s objection that adaptationist hypotheses were\nuntestable, which the behavioral ecologists could easily rebut (Mayr,\n1983). Similarly, Parker and Maynard Smith (1990) responded to\nGould and Lewontin’s objection that adaptationists do not\nproperly account for phylogenetic and developmental constraints; Parker\nand Maynard Smith argued that they are taken into account—even\nwhere developmental constraints and tradeoffs are not explicitly\nrepresented in optimality models, they are often built into the\nstrategy set or are otherwise implicit in those models. However,\nit is reasonable to point out that Parker and Maynard Smith’s\npaper did not fully respond to Gould and Lewontin’s objection:\nGould and Lewontin recognized that adaptationist models appeal to\nconstraints; their worry was that such constraints are appealed to\nad hoc to fill in gaps in models, and are not subjected to any\nexternal test.  \n\nAnother objection to adaptationist methods from Gould and Lewontin\nthat has persisted as a criticism of behavioral ecology is that these\nmethods do not allow scientists to consider non-adaptationist\nexplanations for the traits to which they are applied, such as whether\nthose traits were fixed by drift or are simply side effects of other\ntraits (i.e. whether they are “spandrels”). In\nprinciple, correctly pursued, adaptationist methods can help identify\ncases where a trait is a non-adaptation: drift, for example, can be\nidentified by comparing the distribution of traits expected under\nselection and under drift with actual population distributions (Sober,\n2005); the question is whether the types of methods used in behavioral ecology\nare the most efficient at detecting these cases (Lewens, 2009). \nSome philosophers have argued that methodological adaptationism is more\npernicious in practice than it looks in principle, because real\nevolutionary social scientists are not good at dropping adaptationist\nhypotheses for a trait even when there is a strong case to be made that\nthey should (see, for example, Lloyd, 2005, esp. Chapter\n8). For further discussion of all these problems, see the entry\non\n adaptationism.  \n\nWhile it seems that the accusation that the early “Pop”\nsociobiologists were genetic determinists was probably unfair, there is\na related objection that can be raised to both “Pop”\nsociobiology and to the later forms of human and non-human behavioral\necology, i.e. that any trait’s being an adaptation requires that\nthat trait be heritable, and most human behaviors are not\nheritable. To say a trait is heritable in the simplest sense is\njust to say that if the parent has that trait, then the trait tends\nalso to appear in the offspring (i.e. to say the trait is heritable\nsimply means that the trait is inherited reliably). The\nmore demanding population genetic definition of heritability is that a\nheritable trait T is one where variation in T can be accounted for\nprimarily by variation in genes as opposed to variation in the\nenvironment (see also the entry on\n heritability). \nHeritability in this sense is supposed to be required for natural\nselection because in order for natural selection to spread a variant T\nin a population, when T increases the average number of offspring of\nits possessors, those offspring have to reliably also have T if T is to\nspread at the expense of the other variants. The problem,\nhowever, is that many human behavioral traits do not seem likely to be\nheritable in this way: they tend to vary greatly across and even within\ncultures and environments, whereas human genetic variation is much too\nlow to account for such differences (Buller, 2005; Cosmides and Tooby,\n1987).  \n\nHowever, HBEs can get around this problem, by pointing out that\nlocal patterns of overt behavior are manifestations of more general\nstrategies; differences in the environment cause the manifestations of\ndifferent elements of these complex behavioral dispositions humans\npossess. For example, the patterns of foraging behavior of the\nAche people in the Paraguay rain forest (Hill and Hurtado, 1996) and\nthe Inuit in the Arctic (Smith, 1991) are very different, and the\ngenetic differences between these groups are insufficient to explain\nthem. However, both could be simply local manifestations of a\nlarger and more general foraging strategy (or strategies) which humans\npossess, which could be heritable and an adaptation. A behavioral\nstrategy is, after all, simply a complex behavioral disposition, which\ninvolves responding in a variety of specific ways to a set of\nenvironmental cues, most of which would be achieved by having an\nappropriate psychological mechanism or mechanisms underlying the set of\ndispositions. In which case, heritability of a behavioral\nstrategy only depends on there being a psychological mechanism or\nmechanisms that produces that strategy reliably, and that\nmechanism’s itself being heritable. Of course, whether\nthere are such heritable mechanisms for the behavioral strategies in\nwhich the HBEs are interested is likely to be a matter of some\ncontroversy. \n\nWhat’s more, some philosophers have argued that it is possible\nfor traits to be adaptations in the standard sense even when they\nare not heritable according to the population genetic \ndefinition[7].\nDespite the claim above that heritability in\nthe population genetic sense is required as a condition of the action\nof natural selection, technically all that is required for natural\nselection to occur on a trait T is for T to be heritable in the weaker\nsense, i.e. that it be robustly transmitted, such that the trait\nvariant in a parent tends to turn up reliably in the\noffspring. The reason heritability in the population\ngenetic sense was believed to also be necessary for natural selection\nwas that genes were believed to be the only developmental resource\ntransmitted to offspring, so only if variation in traits followed\nvariation in genes would traits be subject to natural selection for the\nreasons described above. However, recently a variety of\nphilosophers and scientists have argued (Odling-Smee et al., 2003;\nSterelny, 2003, 2007, 2012) that natural selection can occur on traits\neven if traits vary most with the environment rather than genes, so\nlong as environments can themselves be transmitted down lineages;\nSterelny’s suggestion is that this might be achieved by robust\nniche construction. This has an interesting consequence: if\nhighly reliably transmitted cultural traits could be subject to natural\nselection, standard evolutionary methods and models of the sorts used\nin behavioral ecology could be used to understand the evolution of such\ntraits. \n\nThis is the not the end of the problem, however. Some\nphilosophers have argued that not all traits that are culturally\ntransmitted or learnt can be properly understood using adaptationist\nmethods, because many of these traits are not heritable even in \nthis weaker sense, and hence cannot be adaptations (Driscoll, 2009; \nDriscoll and Stich, 2008; Kitcher, 1990). Worse, such traits could appear highly\nadaptive on evolutionary models. For example, traits which\nare subject to highly adaptive individual learning or adaptive social\ntransmission processes in populations (Henrich and Boyd, 1998; Henrich\nand Gil-White, 2001) are nevertheless not adaptations because they are\nnot shaped by natural\n selection[8].\nThis is because in many of these cases, the\nfeatures of the environment that make the trait appear adaptive may not\nactually have featured as selection conditions in the causal history of\nthe trait (or perhaps as causes in any sense). In such cases,\nevolutionary methods popular in sociobiology and the current\nevolutionary social sciences (such as optimality modeling) will make\ntraits appear to be adaptations to those conditions when they are\nnot. For a more detailed discussion of dual inheritance theory,\ngene culture co-evolution and the associated theory, see the entry\non\n cultural evolution. \n\nAnother problem for behavioral ecology and sociobiology is their\nfocus on trying to understand the biological basis of behavior\nas such. The behavioral focus made sense to those behavioral\necologists influenced by Lorenz and Tinbergen’s ethology, but\nonce cognitive psychologists became interested in applying evolutionary\nthinking to their work, the effects of the cognitive revolution in\npsychology began to have an effect on some of the\n“sociobiological” thinkers, and they transformed\nsociobiology into evolutionary psychology (Cosmides and Tooby, 1987;\nTooby and Cosmides, 1990). The result of the cognitive revolution\nin psychology was that many psychologists came to regard the proper\ntarget of explanation in psychology to be genuinely psychological\nstates or mechanisms rather than behavioral dispositions (as in\nSkinnerian Behaviorism) (Chomsky, 1959). In cognitive science\nsince the middle of the twentieth century, psychological states and\nmechanisms have largely been understood in computational and\nmaterialist terms, that is, that the mind is the brain, and that brain\nstates and mechanisms are essentially computational states and\ncomputers respectively (though almost certainly not serial\ncomputers). Psychological descriptions, then, are simply\ndescriptions of these brain systems in computational or\ninformation-processing terms; generally they appeal to representations,\ndecision rules and algorithms that brain systems process. The\nshift in methodology and theory represented by this change in approach\nwas extremely significant. But it also appears to have made\ncognitive psychologists interested in evolution averse to thinking of\nbehavioral dispositions as proper targets of evolutionary explanation,\njust as they were averse to thinking of them as the proper targets of\npsychological explanation (Cosmides and Tooby, 1987). This issue\nnever seems to have arisen for the human behavioral ecologists; indeed, not\nonly is behavior treated as the only proper target of evolutionary\nexplanation, but psychology is explicitly ignored in favor of behavior\nfor methodological reasons—the focus on behavior is part of the\n“phenotypic gambit” (Grafen, 1984) which (as described\nabove) simplifies evolutionary modeling and the process of deriving\nexplanations from it in human behavioral ecology.  \n\nThe importance of the issue to the evolutionary psychologists has\nled to a series of arguments traded between the human behavioral\necologists and evolutionary psychologists for preferring behavior over\npsychology and vice versa. Two main arguments have been raised in\nfavor of considering behavior the proper target of explanation, both\nfrom. The first is purely practical: behavior is relatively\nstraightforwardly observable whereas psychological mechanisms are not,\nto the extent that the nature of only a few psychological mechanisms\nhas been uncontroversially demonstrated (one of the few examples might\nbe the mechanisms for learning language) (Alexander, 1990). The\nsecond is that only behavior can be an adaptation because only behavior\nis the actual causal nexus between the organism and its environment\n(Alexander, 1990; see the same idea in early form in Skinner,\n1984).  \n\nThe central problem with both of these arguments is that, while they\nare true of overt behavior, they are not true of the behavioral\ndispositions or strategies (complex behavioral dispositions) which are\nthe actual targets of explanation in behavioral ecology—or at\nleast, no more true than of psychological mechanisms. Behavioral\ndispositions do not causally interact with the environment except\ninsofar as they lead to the actual manifestation of overt behavior;\nthey are also no more “straightforwardly observable” than\npsychological mechanisms since they cannot be observed until overt\nbehavior in manifested, and even then distinguishing between different\nstrategies with overlapping component behavioral dispositions is also\ndifficult. \n\nArguments for the claim that only psychological mechanisms should be\nconsidered to be adaptations rest on the idea that behavior is really\nonly ever a manifestation of the underlying psychology. Behavior\nis not an adaptation so much as it is the effect of an\nadaptation. Cosmides and Tooby (1987) also argue that the really\ninteresting evolutionary generalizations emerge at the level of\npsychology, not behavior. Again, however, this argument depends\non understanding “behavior” as “overt\nbehavior”, individual chunks of physical activity that\nare not necessarily reproduced over time and which do not occur in evolutionary\nsocial science generalizations, verses understanding\n“behavior” as “complex behavioral strategies”,\nwhich do seem potentially transmissible (via the psychological\nmechanisms that support them). It is also notable that such\nstrategies are the subject of a significant evolutionary\nliterature—such as evolutionary game theory, on which Cosmides\nand Tooby themselves depend: the argument for expecting their famous\n“Cheater Detection” module (Cosmides, 1989; Cosmides and\nTooby, 1992) is derived from Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) and\nTrivers’ (1971) work showing that TIT FOR TAT, which requires its\nplayers to be able to detect cheaters on reciprocally altruistic\ninteractions, is an evolutionary stable\n strategy[9].  \n\nMore recently, philosophers have also presented some arguments for\none side or the other of this issue. Buller (2005, 50–52), for\nexample, argues that behaviors cannot be adaptations because they are\nnot heritable, whereas psychological mechanisms are. However,\nBuller’s discussion does not make the distinction between overt\nbehaviors and behavioral strategies described above. Buller\nargues that behaviors could disappear from the population for\ngenerations if the necessary response conditions never arose, but yet\nstill emerge again if the stimulus reappeared, and this suggests that\nthese behaviors are not inherited as such rather than the underlying\npsychological mechanism. In this he is right as long as he means\nthe overt behaviors; behavioral dispositions or strategies could also\nremain present and be inherited in the absence of the response\nconditions. Moreover, Buller’s description of a\n“psychological mechanism” in this context sounds rather\nlike a behavioral disposition (2005, 52–53).  \n\nAnother argument in the philosophical literature for thinking that\nbehaviors are not the proper targets of natural selection explanations\nis that behaviors are not quasi-independent (Lewontin, 1978)\nin the way they need to be to evolve by selection in their own right\n(Sterelny, 1992; Sterelny and Fitness, 2003; Sterelny and Griffiths,\n1999). This is because many behavioral strategies will depend on\nmulti-purpose mechanisms that cannot change during evolution without\nthose changes ramifying to the other strategies those mechanisms\nproduce. However, Driscoll (2004) argues that this is not\nnecessarily the case; multi-purpose mechanisms, in order to be able to\nproduce more than one strategy, would have to have branching\nalgorithms; variation in any of these mechanisms necessary to generate\nvariation in any one strategy need only occur on the branch relevant to\nthe strategy in question and need have little or no effect on the other\nbranches. Instead, whether an evolutionary explanation is\nproperly directed at the behavioral or psychological level depends on\nthe case. \n\nSociobiology, despite its complicated history, remains of interest to\nphilosophers and has some import for certain important philosophical\ndebates. One such question is whether human beings should be\nunderstood to have a nature, a set of traits which for Wilson\nare those heritable traits that have been fixed in the population by\nnatural selection (Wilson, 1978). Consequently, this\n‘nature’ can be discovered and understood using the\nstandard adaptationist methods used in other areas of biology. Most\nimportantly, Wilson suggests that some of the characteristics that\nmake up human nature are specifically behavioral.  \n\nQuite apart from the fundamental interest of the question of whether\nthere is a human nature, the issue is important because it might have\na significant moral or social upshot: what society we can have, and\nindeed what society we should have might depend on what human nature\nis like (Wilson, 1978). It was this concern that ignited the\n“sociobiology wars” in the early days after the\npublication of Sociobiology. The “Sociobiology Study\nGroup” was concerned that Wilson was trying to argue that many\nproblematic or harmful features of current societies, such as\noppressive gender roles, negative race relations and interpersonal\naggression might be unchangeable (Sociobiology Study Group of Science\nfor the People, 1976). Philosophers of biology have strongly resisted\nthe idea that humans have a ‘nature’ in anything like the\ntraditional sense of a fixed essence (Hull, 1986; Lewens, 2012; Lloyd\nand Crowley, 2002) but there is also some debate about whether humans\ncould be said to have a nature in the sense of a set of evolved traits\nin much the way that Wilson suggests (e.g. see Machery, 2008, 2012;\nfor a critique see Powell, 2012). Philosophers in this area are\ninstead focusing on notions of human nature that take into account the\nflexibility of human development and the capacity of human beings to\nconstruct their own development and hence their own\n‘nature’ (Griffiths, 2009; Ramsey, 2013; Stotz, 2012). \n\nAnother hope on the part of philosophers is that understanding the\nevolution of cognition might give us some insight into the nature of\ncertain human psychological traits that have particular philosophical\ninterest. One such trait is our moral psychology. Moral psychology is\nof interest to philosophers who hold naturalistic views of ethics\nbecause they believe moral values depend in part on features of that\npsychology; understanding that psychology and how it evolved would\ngive us insight into what the correct moral values are. Understanding\nthe origins of human moral psychology might also help answer certain\nmetaethical questions (Street, 2006). As Wilson hoped, scientists\nworking in disciplines which are the modern descendants of\nsociobiology have contributed to our understanding of the way that\nnorms, including moral norms, might have become established in human\nevolution (see, for example, Henrich and Boyd, 2001; Sripada,\n2005). Philosophers still strongly disagree, however, on how the\nevolution of moral psychology, especially for the acquisition of\nnorms, should be understood (Dwyer, 2006; Sripada and Stich, 2006;\nSterelny, 2010). \n\nOther debates surrounding sociobiology are still ongoing. For\nexample, while methodological adaptationism has become and remained the\nstandard approach in behavioral ecology, not all philosophers are\nconvinced that this is an entirely benign practice – there are\nstill concerns about the assumptions that this methodology requires\n(see, for example, Lewens, 2009; Lloyd, 2005). Similarly, there\nhas been an increasing interest in the role of culture in the nature\nand history of human behavior; work studying the evolution of culture\nhas increased since Lumsden and Wilson (1981) published their\nbook. Philosophers and scientists are still addressing questions\nabout how and how far cultural traits can be said to evolve; and, as\ndiscussed above, whether traits that have evolved in this way can be\nconsidered adaptations in any sense (Driscoll, 2011; Fracchia and\nLewontin, 1999, 2005; Henrich et al., 2008; Sperber, 2006; Sterelny,\n2006).","contact.mail":"catherine_driscoll@ncsu.edu","contact.domain":"ncsu.edu"}]
