[{"date.published":"2011-10-12","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/","author1":"Michael Wheeler","entry":"heidegger","body.text":"\n\n\n\nMartin Heidegger (1889–1976) was a German philosopher whose work is\nperhaps most readily associated with phenomenology and existentialism,\nalthough his thinking should be identified as part of such\nphilosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification. His\nideas have exerted a seminal influence on the development of\ncontemporary European philosophy. They have also had an impact far\nbeyond philosophy, for example in architectural theory (see e.g., Sharr\n2007), literary criticism (see e.g., Ziarek 1989), theology (see e.g.,\nCaputo 1993), psychotherapy (see e.g., Binswanger 1943/1964, Guignon\n1993) and cognitive science (see e.g., Dreyfus 1992, 2008; Wheeler 2005;\nKiverstein and Wheeler 2012).\n\n\n\nMartin Heidegger was born in Messkirch, Germany, on September 26,\n1889. Messkirch was then a quiet, conservative, religious rural town,\nand as such was a formative influence on Heidegger and his\nphilosophical thought. In 1909 he spent two weeks in the Jesuit order\nbefore leaving (probably on health grounds) to study theology at the\nUniversity of Freiburg. In 1911 he switched subjects, to philosophy. He\nbegan teaching at Freiburg in 1915. In 1917 he married Elfride Petri,\nwith whom he had two sons (Jörg and Hermann) and from whom he\nnever parted (although his affair with the philosopher Hannah Arendt,\nhis student at Marburg in the 1920s, is well-known). \n\nHeidegger's philosophical development began when he read\nBrentano and Aristotle, plus the latter's medieval scholastic\ninterpreters. Indeed, Aristotle's demand in the\nMetaphysics to know what it is that unites all possible modes\nof Being (or ‘is-ness’) is, in many ways, the question that\nignites and drives Heidegger's philosophy. From this platform he\nproceeded to engage deeply with Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and,\nperhaps most importantly of all for his subsequent thinking in the\n1920s, two further figures: Dilthey (whose stress on the role of\ninterpretation and history in the study of human activity profoundly\ninfluenced Heidegger) and Husserl (whose understanding of phenomenology\nas a science of essences he was destined to reject). In 1915 Husserl\ntook up a post at Freiburg and in 1919 Heidegger became his assistant.\nHeidegger spent a period (of reputedly brilliant) teaching at the\nUniversity of Marburg (1923–1928), but then returned to Freiburg to\ntake up the chair vacated by Husserl on his retirement. Out of such\ninfluences, explorations, and critical engagements, Heidegger's\nmagnum opus, Being and Time (Sein und Zeit) was born.\nAlthough Heidegger's academic and intellectual relationship with\nhis Freiburg predecessor was complicated and occasionally strained (see\nCrowell 2005), Being and Time was dedicated to Husserl,\n“in friendship and admiration”. \n\nPublished in 1927, Being and Time is standardly hailed as\none of the most significant texts in the canon of (what has come to be\ncalled) contemporary European (or Continental) Philosophy. It\ncatapulted Heidegger to a position of international intellectual\nvisibility and provided the philosophical impetus for a number of later\nprogrammes and ideas in the contemporary European tradition, including\nSartre's existentialism, Gadamer's philosophical\nhermeneutics, and Derrida's notion of\n‘deconstruction’. Moreover, Being and Time, and indeed\nHeidegger's philosophy in general, has been presented and engaged\nwith by thinkers such as Dreyfus (e.g., 1990) and Rorty (e.g., 1991a, b)\nwho work somewhere near the interface between the contemporary European and the analytic traditions. A\ncross-section of broadly analytic reactions to Heidegger (positive and\nnegative) may be found alongside other responses in (Murray 1978).\nBeing and Time is discussed in section 2 of this article. \n\nIn 1933 Heidegger joined the Nazi Party and was elected Rector of\nFreiburg University, where, depending on whose account one believes, he\neither enthusiastically implemented the Nazi policy of bringing\nuniversity education into line with Hitler's nauseating political\nprogramme (Pattison 2000) or he allowed that policy to be officially\nimplemented while conducting a partially underground campaign of\nresistance to some of its details, especially its anti-Semitism (see\nHeidegger's own account in Only a God can\nSave Us). During the short period of his rectorship—he resigned in 1934—Heidegger gave a number of public speeches\n(including his inaugural rectoral address; see below) in which Nazi\nimages plus occasional declarations of support for Hitler are\nintegrated with the philosophical language of Being and Time.\nAfter 1934 Heidegger became increasingly distanced from Nazi politics.\nAlthough he didn't leave the Nazi party, he did attract some\nunwelcome attention from its enthusiasts. After the war, however, a\nuniversity denazification committee at Freiburg investigated Heidegger\nand banned him from teaching, a right which he did not get back until\n1949. One year later he was made professor Emeritus. Against this\nbackground of contrary information, one will search in vain through\nHeidegger's later writings for the sort of total and unambiguous\nrepudiation of National Socialism that one might hope to find. The\nphilosophical character of Heidegger's involvement with Nazism is\ndiscussed later in this article. \n\nAfter Being and Time there is a reorienting shift in\nHeidegger's philosophy known as ‘the turn’ (die\nKehre). Exactly when this occurs is a matter of debate, although\nit is probably safe to say that it is in progress by 1930 and largely\nestablished by the early 1940s. If dating the turn has its problems,\nsaying exactly what it involves is altogether more challenging. Indeed,\nHeidegger himself characterized it not as a turn in his own thinking\n(or at least in his thinking alone) but as a turn in Being. As he later\nput it in a preface he wrote to Richardson's ground-breaking text\non his work (Richardson 1963), the “Kehre is at work\nwithin the issue [that is named by the titles ‘Being and\nTime’/‘Time and Being.’]… It is not something\nthat I did, nor does it pertain to my thinking only”. The core\nelements of the turn are indicated in what is now considered by many\ncommentators to be Heidegger's second greatest work,\nContributions to Philosophy (From Enowning), (Beitrage zur\nPhilosophie (Vom Ereignis)). This uncompromising text was written\nin 1936–7, but was not published in German until 1989 and not in\nEnglish translation until 1999. Section 3 of this article will attempt\nto navigate the main currents of the turn, and thus of\nHeidegger's later philosophy, in the light of this increasingly\ndiscussed text. \n\nHeidegger died in Freiburg on May 26, 1976. He was buried in\nMesskirch. \n\nBeing and Time is a long and complex book. The reader is\nimmediately struck by what Mulhall (2005, viii) calls the\n“tortured intensity of [Heidegger's] prose”, although if\nthe text is read in its original German it is possible to hear the\nvast number of what appear to be neologisms as attempts to reanimate\nthe German language. According to this latter gloss, the linguistic\nconstructions concerned—which involve hyphenations, unusual\nprefixes and uncommon suffixes—reveal the hidden meanings and\nresonances of ordinary talk. In any case, for many readers, the\ninitially strange and difficult language of\nBeing and Time is fully vindicated by the realization that\nHeidegger is struggling to say things for which our conventional terms\nand linguistic constructions are ultimately inadequate. Indeed, for\nsome thinkers who have toiled in its wake, Heidegger's language\nbecomes the language of philosophy (although for an\nalternative and critical view of the language of Being and\nTime, see Adorno 1964/2002). Viewed from the perspective of\nHeidegger's own intentions, the work is incomplete. It was meant\nto have two parts, each of which was supposed to be divided into three\ndivisions. What we have published under the title of Being and\nTime are the first two divisions of (the intended) part one. The\nreasons for this incompleteness will be explored later in this\narticle.  \n\nOne might reasonably depict the earliest period of Heidegger's\nphilosophical work, in Freiburg (1915–23) and Marburg (1923–6), before\nhe commenced the writing of Being and Time itself, as the\npre-history of that seminal text (although for an alternative analysis\nthat stresses not only a back-and-forth movement in Heidegger's\nearliest thought between theology and philosophy, but also the\ncontinuity between that earliest thought and the later philosophy, see\nvan Buren 1994, 2005). Viewed in relation to Being and Time,\nthe central philosophical theme in these early years is\nHeidegger's complex critical relationship with Husserl's\ntranscendental phenomenology—what Crowell (2005, p.49) calls\n“a dynamic of attraction and repulsion”—as driven\nby Heidegger's transformative reading of Aristotle. As early as a\n1919 lecture course, for example, we find Heidegger arguing that\nHusserl's view (developed in the Logical Investigations,\nHusserl 1900/1973), that philosophy should renounce theory and\nconcentrate on the things given directly in consciousness, is flawed\nbecause such givenness is itself a theoretical construct. For the young\nHeidegger, then, it is already the case that phenomenological analysis\nstarts not with Husserlian intentionality (the consciousness of\nobjects), but rather with an interpretation of the pre-theoretical\nconditions for there to be such intentionality. This idea will later be\ncentral to, and elaborated within, Being and Time, by which\npoint a number of important developments (explained in more detail\nlater in this article) will have occurred in Heidegger's\nthinking: the Husserlian notion of formal ontology (the study of the a\npriori categories that describe objects of any sort, by means of our\njudgments and perceptions) will have been transformed into\nfundamental ontology (a neo-Aristotelian search for what it is\nthat unites and makes possible our varied and diverse senses of what it\nis to be); Husserl's transcendental consciousness (the\nirreducible thinking ego or subject that makes possible objective\ninquiry) will have been transfigured into Dasein (the\ninherently social being who already operates with a pre-theoretical\ngrasp of the a priori structures that make possible particular modes of\nBeing); and Husserlian intentionality (a consciousness of objects) will\nhave been replaced by the concept of care or\nBeing-in-the-world (a non-intentional, or perhaps\npre-intentional, openness to a world).  \n\nEach of these aspects of Heidegger's framework in Being\nand Time emerges out of his radical rethinking of Aristotle, a\nrethinking that finds its fullest and most explicit expression in a\n1925–6 lecture course entitled Logik (later renamed Logik\n(Aristoteles) by Heidegger's student Helene Weiß, in\norder to distinguish this lecture course from a later one he gave also\nentitled Logik; see Kisiel 1993, 559, note 23). On\nHeidegger's interpretation (see Sheehan 1975), Aristotle holds\nthat since every meaningful appearance of beings involves an event in\nwhich a human being takes a being as—as, say,\na ship in which one can sail or as a god that one should\nrespect—what unites all the different modes of Being is that\nthey realize some form of presence (present-ness) to human beings. This\npresence-to is expressed in the ‘as’ of\n‘taking-as’. Thus the unity of the different modes of Being\nis grounded in a capacity for taking-as (making-present-to) that\nAristotle argues is the essence of human existence. Heidegger's\nresponse, in effect, is to suggest that although Aristotle is on the\nright track, he has misconceived the deep structure of taking-as. For\nHeidegger, taking-as is grounded not in multiple modes of presence, but\nrather in a more fundamental temporal unity (remember, it's Being\nand time, more on this later) that characterizes\nBeing-in-the-world (care). This engagement with Aristotle—the\nAristotle, that is, that Heidegger unearths during his early years in\nFreiburg and Marburg—explains why, as Sheehan (1975, 87)\nputs it, “Aristotle appears directly or indirectly on virtually\nevery page” of Being and Time. (For more on\nHeidegger's pre-Being-and-Time period, see e.g., Kisiel\n1993, Kisiel and van Buren 1994, and Heidegger's early occasional\nwritings as reproduced in the collection Becoming Heidegger.\nFor more on the philosophical relationship between Husserl and\nHeidegger, see e.g., Crowell 2001 and the review of Crowell's\nbook by Carman 2002; Dahlstrom 1994; Dostal 1993; Overgaard 2003.) \n\nLet's back up in order to bring Heidegger's central\nconcern into better view. (The ‘way in’ to Being and\nTime that I am about to present follows Gelven 1989 6–7.) Consider\nsome philosophical problems that will be familiar from introductory\nmetaphysics classes: Does the table that I think I see before me exist?\nDoes God exist? Does mind, conceived as an entity distinct from body,\nexist? These questions have the following form: does x (where x = some\nparticular kind of thing) exist? Questions of this form presuppose that\nwe already know what ‘to exist’ means. We typically\ndon't even notice this presupposition. But Heidegger does, which\nis why he raises the more fundamental question: what does ‘to\nexist’ mean? This is one way of asking what Heidegger\ncalls the question of the meaning of Being, and Being and Time\nis an investigation into that question. \n\nMany of Heidegger's translators capitalize the word\n‘Being’ (Sein) to mark what, in the Basic\nProblems of Phenomenology, Heidegger will later call the\nontological difference, the crucial distinction between Being\nand beings (entities). The question of the meaning of Being is\nconcerned with what it is that makes beings intelligible as\nbeings, and whatever that factor (Being) is, it is seemingly not itself\nsimply another being among beings. Unfortunately the capitalization of\n‘Being’ also has the disadvantage of suggesting that Being\nis, as Sheehan (2001) puts it, an ethereal metaphysical something that\nlies beyond entities, what he calls ‘Big Being’. But to\nthink of Being in this way would be to commit the very mistake that the\ncapitalization is supposed to help us avoid. For while Being is always\nthe Being of some entity, Being is not itself some kind of higher-order\nbeing waiting to be discovered. As long as we remain alert to this\nworry, we can follow the otherwise helpful path of capitalization. \n\nAccording to Heidegger, the question of the meaning of Being, and thus\nBeing as such, has been forgotten by ‘the tradition’\n(roughly, Western philosophy from Plato onwards). Heidegger means by\nthis that the history of Western thought has failed to heed the\nontological difference, and so has articulated Being precisely as a\nkind of ultimate being, as evidenced by a series of namings of Being,\nfor example as idea, energeia, substance, monad or will to power. In this way Being as such has been\nforgotten. So Heidegger sets himself the task of recovering the\nquestion of the meaning of Being. In this context he draws two\ndistinctions between different kinds of inquiry. The first, which is\njust another way of expressing the ontological difference, is between\nthe ontical and the ontological, where the former is concerned with\nfacts about entities and the latter is concerned with the meaning of\nBeing, with how entities are intelligible as entities. Using this\ntechnical language, we can put the point about the forgetting of Being\nas such by saying that the history of Western thought is characterized\nby an ‘onticization’ of Being (by the practice of treating\nBeing as a being). However, as Heidegger explains, here in the words\nof\nKant and the Problem of Metaphysics, “an ontic knowledge\ncan never alone direct itself ‘to’ the objects, because\nwithout the ontological… it can have no possible Whereto”\n(translation taken from Overgaard 2002, p.76, note 7). The second\ndistinction between different kinds of inquiry, drawn within the\ncategory of the ontological, is between regional ontology and\nfundamental ontology, where the former is concerned with the ontologies\nof particular domains, say biology or banking, and the latter is\nconcerned with\nthe a priori, transcendental conditions that make possible particular modes of Being\n(i.e., particular regional ontologies). For Heidegger, the\nontical presupposes the regional-ontological, which in turn presupposes\nthe fundamental-ontological. As he puts it: \n\nThe question of Being aims… at ascertaining the a priori\nconditions not only for the possibility of the sciences which examine\nbeings as beings of such and such a type, and, in doing so, already\noperate with an understanding of Being, but also for the possibility of\nthose ontologies themselves which are prior to the ontical sciences and\nwhich provide their foundations. Basically, all ontology, no matter\nhow rich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at its\ndisposal, remains blind and perverted from its ownmost aim, if it has\nnot first adequately clarified the meaning of Being, and conceived this\nclarification as its fundamental task. (Being and Time 3:\n31) (References to Being and Time will be given in the form of\n‘section: page number’, where ‘page number’\nrefers to the widely used Macquarrie and Robinson English\ntranslation.) \n\nSo how do we carry out fundamental ontology, and thus answer the\nquestion of the meaning of Being? It is here that Heidegger introduces\nthe notion of Dasein (Da-sein: there-being). One proposal for\nhow to think about the term ‘Dasein’ is that it is\nHeidegger's label for the distinctive mode of Being\nrealized by human beings (for this reading, see e.g., Brandom 2002,\n325). Haugeland (2005, 422) complains that this interpretation clashes\nunhelpfully with Heidegger's identification of care as the Being\nof Dasein, given Heidegger's prior stipulation that Being is\nalways the Being of some possible entity. To keep ‘Dasein’\non the right side of the ontological difference, then, we might\nconceive of it as Heidegger's term for the distinctive kind of\nentity that human beings as such are. This fits with many of\nHeidegger's explicit characterizations of Dasein (see e.g.,\nBeing and Time 2: 27, 3: 32), and it probably deserves to be\ncalled the standard view in the secondary literature (see e.g.,\nHaugeland 2005 for an explicit supporting case). That said, one needs\nto be careful about precisely what sort of entity we are talking about\nhere. For Dasein is not to be understood as ‘the biological human\nbeing’. Nor is it to be understood as ‘the person’.\nHaugeland (2005, 423) argues that Dasein is “a way of\nlife shared by the members of some community”. (As Haugeland\nnotes, there is an analogy here, one that Heidegger himself draws, with\nthe way in which we might think of a language existing as an entity,\nthat is, as a communally shared way of speaking.) This appeal to the\ncommunity will assume a distinctive philosophical shape as the argument\nof Being and Time progresses.  \n\nThe foregoing considerations bring an important question to the\nfore: what, according to Heidegger, is so special about human beings as\nsuch? Here there are broadly speaking two routes that one might take\nthrough the text of Being and Time. The first unfolds as\nfollows. If we look around at beings in general—from particles\nto planets, ants to apes—it is human beings\nalone who are able to encounter the question of what it means\nto be (e.g., in moments of anxiety in which the world can appear\nmeaning-less, more on which later). More specifically, it is human\nbeings alone who (a) operate in their everyday activities with an\nunderstanding of Being (although, as we shall see, one which is\npre-ontological, in that it is implicit and vague) and (b) are\nable to reflect upon what it means to be. This gives us a way of\nunderstanding statements such as “Dasein is ontically\ndistinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an\nissue for it” (Being and Time 4: 32). Mulhall,\nwho tends to pursue this way of characterizing Dasein, develops the\nidea by explaining that while inanimate objects merely persist\nthrough time and while plants and non-human animals have their lives\ndetermined entirely by the demands of survival and\nreproduction, human beings lead their lives (Mulhall 2005,\n15). In terms of its deep ontological structure, although not typically\nin terms of how it presents itself to the individual in consciousness,\neach moment in a human life constitutes a kind of branch-point at which\na person ‘chooses’ a kind of life, a possible way to be. It\nis crucial to emphasize that one may, in the relevant sense,\n‘choose’ an existing path simply by continuing unthinkingly\nalong it, since in principle at least, and within certain limits, one\nalways had, and still has, the capacity to take a different path. (This\ngives us a sense of human freedom, one that will be unpacked more\ncarefully below.) This can all sound terribly inward-looking, but that\nis not Heidegger's intention. In a way that is about to become\nclearer, Dasein's projects and possibilities are essentially\nbound up with the ways in which other entities may become intelligible.\nMoreover, terms such as ‘lead’ and ‘choose’\nmust be interpreted in the light of Heidegger's account of care\nas the Being of Dasein (see later), an account that blunts any\ntemptation to hear these terms in a manner that suggests inner\ndeliberation or planning on the part of a reflective subject. (So\nperhaps Mulhall's point that human beings are distinctive in that\nthey lead their lives would be better expressed as the observation that\nhuman beings are the nuclei of lives laying themselves\nout.)  \n\nThe second route to an understanding of Dasein, and thus of what is\nspecial about human beings as such, emphasizes the link with the\ntaking-as structure highlighted earlier. Sheehan (2001) develops just\nsuch a line of exegesis by combining two insights. The first is that\nthe ‘Da’ of Da-sein may be profitably translated not as\n‘there’ but as ‘open’. This openness is in turn\nto be understood as ‘the possibility of taking-as’ and thus\nas a preintellectual openness to Being that is necessary for us to\nencounter beings as beings in particular ways (e.g., practically,\ntheoretically, aesthetically). Whether or not the standard translation\nof ‘Da’ as ‘there’ is incapable of doing\njustice to this idea is moot—one might express the same view by\nsaying that to be Dasein is to be there, in the midst of\nentities making sense a certain way. Nevertheless, the term\n‘openness’ does seem to provide a nicely graphic expression\nof the phenomenon in question. Sheehan's second insight, driven\nby a comment of Heidegger's in the Zollikon seminars to\nthe effect that the verbal emphasis in ‘Da-sein’ is to be\nplaced on the second syllable, is that the ‘sein’ of\n‘Da-sein’ should be heard as ‘having-to-be’, in\ncontrast with ‘occasionally or contingently is’. These dual\ninsights lead to a characterization of Dasein as the\nhaving-to-be-open. In other words, Dasein (and so human beings as\nsuch) cannot but be open: it is a necessary characteristic of human\nbeings (an a priori structure of our existential constitution, not an\nexercise of our wills) that we operate with the sense-making capacity\nto take-other-beings-as. \n\nThe two interpretative paths that we have just walked are not\nnecessarily in conflict: in the words of Vallega-Neu (2003, 12),\n“in existing, Dasein occurs… as a transcending beyond\nbeings into the disclosure of being as such, so that in this\ntranscending not only its own possibilities of being [our first route]\nbut also the being of other beings [our second route] is\ndisclosed”. And this helps us to grasp the meaning of\nHeidegger's otherwise opaque claim that Dasein, and indeed only\nDasein, exists, where existence is understood (via\netymological considerations) as ek-sistence, that is, as a\nstanding out. Dasein stands out in two senses, each of which\ncorresponds to one of the two dimensions of our proposed\ninterpretation. First, Dasein can stand back or ‘out’ from\nits own occurrence in the world and observe itself (see e.g., Gelven\n1989, 49). Second, Dasein stands out in an openness to and an opening\nof Being (see e.g., Vallega-Neu 2004, 11–12). \n\nAs we have seen, it is an essential characteristic of Dasein that,\nin its ordinary ways of engaging with other entities, it operates with\na preontological understanding of Being, that is, with a distorted or\nburied grasp of the a priori conditions that, by underpinning the\ntaking-as structure, make possible particular modes of Being. This\nsuggests that a disciplined investigation of those everyday modes of\nengagement on the part of Dasein (what Heidegger calls an\n“existential analytic of Dasein”) will be a first step\ntowards revealing a shared but hidden underlying meaning of Being.\nHeidegger puts it like this: \n whenever an ontology takes for its\ntheme entities whose character of Being is other than that of Dasein,\nit has its own foundation and motivation in Dasein's own ontical\nstructure, in which a pre-ontological understanding of Being is\ncomprised as a definite characteristic… Therefore fundamental\nontology, from which alone all other ontologies can take their rise,\nmust be sought in the existential analytic of Dasein. (Being\nand Time 3: 33–4)  \nIt is important to stress here that, in\nHeidegger's eyes, this prioritizing of Dasein does not lead to\n(what he calls) “a vicious subjectivizing of the totality of\nentities” (Being and Time 4: 34). This resistance\ntowards any unpalatable anti-realism is an issue to which we shall\nreturn. \n\nDasein is, then, our primary ‘object’ of study, and our\npoint of investigative departure is Dasein's everyday encounters\nwith entities. But what sort of philosophical method is appropriate for\nthe ensuing examination? Famously, Heidegger's adopted method is\na species of phenomenology. In the Heideggerian framework, however,\nphenomenology is not to be understood (as it sometimes is) as the study\nof how things merely appear in experience. Rather, in a recognizably\nKantian staging of the idea, Heidegger follows Husserl (1913/1983) in\nconceiving of phenomenology as a theoretical enterprise that takes\nordinary experience as its point of departure, but which, through an\nattentive and sensitive examination of that experience, aims to reveal\nthe a priori, transcendental conditions that shape and structure it. In\nHeidegger's Being-centred project, these are the conditions\n“which, in every kind of Being that factical Dasein may possess,\npersist as determinative for the character of its Being”\n(Being and Time 5: 38). Presupposed by ordinary experience,\nthese structures must in some sense be present with that experience,\nbut they are not simply available to be read off from its surface,\nhence the need for disciplined and careful phenomenological analysis to\nreveal them as they are. So far so good. But, in a departure from the\nestablished Husserlian position, one that demonstrates the influence of\nDilthey, Heidegger claims that phenomenology is not just\ntranscendental, it is hermeneutic (for discussion, see e.g.,\nCaputo 1984, Kisiel 2002 chapter 8). In other words, its goal is always\nto deliver an interpretation of Being, an interpretation that,\non the one hand, is guided by certain historically embedded ways of\nthinking (ways of taking-as reflected in Dasein's preontological\nunderstanding of Being) that the philosopher as Dasein and as\ninterpreter brings to the task, and, on the other hand, is ceaselessly\nopen to revision, enhancement and replacement. For Heidegger, this\nhermeneutic structure is not a limitation on understanding, but a\nprecondition of it, and philosophical understanding (conceived as\nfundamental ontology) is no exception. Thus Being and Time\nitself has a spiral structure in which a sequence of reinterpretations\nproduces an ever more illuminating comprehension of Being. As Heidegger\nputs it later in the text: \n\nWhat is decisive is not to get out of the circle but to come into it\nthe right way… In the circle is hidden a positive possibility of\nthe most primordial kind of knowing. To be sure, we genuinely take hold\nof this possibility only when, in our interpretation, we have\nunderstood that our first, last and constant task is never to allow our\nfore-having, fore-sight and fore-conception to be presented to us by\nfancies and popular conceptions, but rather to make the scientific\ntheme secure by working out these fore-structures in terms of the\nthings themselves. (Being and Time 32: 195) \n\nOn the face of it, the hermeneutic conception of phenomenology sits\nunhappily with a project that aims to uncover the a priori\ntranscendental conditions that make possible particular modes of Being\n(which is arguably one way of glossing the project of “working\nout [the] fore-structures [of understanding] in terms of the things\nthemselves”). And this is a tension that, it seems fair to say,\nis never fully resolved within the pages of Being and Time.\nThe best we can do is note that, by the end of the text, the\ntranscendental has itself become historically embedded. More on that\nbelow. What is also true is that there is something of a divide in\ncertain areas of contemporary Heidegger scholarship over whether one\nshould emphasize the transcendental dimension of Heidegger's\nphenomenology (e.g., Crowell 2001, Crowell and Malpas 2007) or the\nhermeneutic dimension (e.g., Kisiel 2002).  \n\nHow, then, does the existential analytic unfold? Heidegger argues\nthat we ordinarily encounter entities as (what he calls)\nequipment, that is, as being for certain sorts of tasks\n(cooking, writing, hair-care, and so on). Indeed we achieve our most\nprimordial (closest) relationship with equipment not by looking at the\nentity in question, or by some detached intellectual or theoretical\nstudy of it, but rather by skillfully manipulating it in a hitch-free\nmanner. Entities so encountered have their own distinctive kind of\nBeing that Heidegger famously calls readiness-to-hand. Thus:\n \nThe less we just stare at the hammer-thing, and the more we\nseize hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship\nto it become, and the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which\nit is—as equipment. The hammering itself uncovers the specific\n‘manipulability’ of the hammer. The kind of Being which\nequipment possesses—in which it manifests itself in its own\nright—we call ‘readiness-to-hand’. (Being\nand Time 15: 98) \n\nReadiness-to-hand has a distinctive phenomenological signature.\nWhile engaged in hitch-free skilled activity, Dasein has no conscious\nexperience of the items of equipment in use as independent\nobjects (i.e., as the bearers of determinate properties that exist\nindependently of the Dasein-centred context of action in which the\nequipmental entity is involved). Thus, while engaged in trouble-free\nhammering, the skilled carpenter has no conscious recognition of the\nhammer, the nails, or the work-bench, in the way that one would if\none simply stood back and thought about them.\nTools-in-use become phenomenologically transparent. Moreover, Heidegger\nclaims, not only are the hammer, nails, and work-bench in this way not\npart of the engaged carpenter's phenomenal world, neither, in a\nsense, is the carpenter. The carpenter becomes absorbed in his activity\nin such a way that he has no awareness of himself as a subject over and\nagainst a world of objects. Crucially, it does not follow from this\nanalysis that Dasein's behaviour in such contexts is automatic,\nin the sense of there being no awareness present at all, but rather\nthat the awareness that is present (what Heidegger calls\ncircumspection) is non-subject-object in form.\nPhenomenologically speaking, then, there are no subjects and no\nobjects; there is only the experience of the ongoing task (e.g.,\nhammering). \n\nHeidegger, then, denies that the categories of subject and object\ncharacterize our most basic way of encountering entities. He maintains,\nhowever, that they apply to a derivative kind of encounter. When Dasein\nengages in, for example, the practices of natural science, when sensing\ntakes place purely in the service of reflective or philosophical\ncontemplation, or when philosophers claim to have identified certain\ncontext-free metaphysical building blocks of the universe (e.g., points\nof pure extension, monads), the entities under study are\nphenomenologically removed from the settings of everyday equipmental\npractice and are thereby revealed as fully fledged independent objects,\nthat is, as the bearers of certain context-general determinate or\nmeasurable properties (size in metres, weight in kilos etc.). Heidegger\ncalls this mode of Being presence-at-hand, and he sometimes\nrefers to present-at-hand entities as ‘Things’. With this\nphenomenological transformation in the mode of Being of entities comes\na corresponding transformation in the mode of Being of Dasein. Dasein\nbecomes a subject, one whose project is to explain and predict the\nbehaviour of an independent, objective universe. Encounters with the\npresent-at-hand are thus fundamentally subject-object in structure. \n\nThe final phenomenological category identified during the first\nphase of the existential analytic is what Heidegger calls\nun-readiness-to-hand. This mode of Being of entities emerges\nwhen skilled practical activity is disturbed by broken or\nmalfunctioning equipment, discovered-to-be-missing equipment, or\nin-the-way equipment. When encountered as un-ready-to-hand, entities\nare no longer phenomenologically transparent. However, they are not yet\nthe fully fledged objects of the present-at-hand, since their broken,\nmalfunctioning, missing or obstructive status is defined relative to a\nparticular equipmental context. The combination of two key passages\nilluminates this point: First: \n \n[The] presence-at-hand of\nsomething that cannot be used is still not devoid of all\nreadiness-to-hand whatsoever; equipment which is present-at-hand in\nthis way is still not just a Thing which occurs somewhere. The damage\nto the equipment is still not a mere alteration of a Thing—not\na change of properties which just occurs in something\npresent-at-hand. (Being and Time 16: 103)\n \n And second:\n \nWhen something cannot be used—when, for instance, a tool\ndefinitely refuses to work—it can be conspicuous only in\nand for dealings in which something is manipulated. (Being\nand Time 68: 406) \n \nThus a driver does not encounter a punctured\ntyre as a lump of rubber of measurable mass; she encounters it as a\ndamaged item of equipment, that is, as the cause of a temporary\ninterruption to her driving activity. With such disturbances to skilled\nactivity, Dasein emerges as a practical problem solver whose\ncontext-embedded actions are directed at restoring smooth skilled\nactivity. \n\nAlthough Heidegger does not put things this way, the complex\nintermediate realm of the un-ready-to-hand is seemingly best thought of\nas a spectrum of cases characterized by different modes and degrees of\nengagement/disengagement. Much of the time Dasein's practical\nproblem solving will involve recovery strategies (e.g., switching to a\ndifferent mode of transport) which preserve the marks of fluid and\nflexible know-how that are present in ready-to-hand contexts. In the\nlimit, however (e.g., when a mechanic uses his theoretical knowledge of\nhow cars work to guide a repair), Dasein's problem solving\nactivity will begin to approximate the theoretical reasoning\ndistinctive of scientific inquiry into present-at-hand entities. But\neven here Dasein is not ‘just theorizing’ or ‘just\nlooking’, so it is not yet, in Heidegger's terms, a pure\ndisengaged subject. With this spectrum of cases in view, it is possible\nto glimpse a potential worry for Heidegger's account. Cappuccio\nand Wheeler (2010; see also Wheeler 2005, 143) argue that the situation\nof wholly transparent readiness-to-hand is something of an ideal state.\nSkilled activity is never (or very rarely) perfectly smooth. Moreover,\nminimal subjective activity (such as a nonconceptual awareness of\ncertain spatially situated movements by my body) produces a background\nnoise that never really disappears. Thus a distinction between Dasein\nand its environment is, to some extent, preserved, and this distinction\narguably manifests the kind of minimal subject-object dichotomy that is\ncharacteristic of those cases of un-readiness-to-hand that lie closest\nto readiness-to-hand. \n\nOn the interpretation of Heidegger just given, Dasein's access\nto the world is only intermittently that of a representing subject. An\nalternative reading, according to which Dasein always exists\nas a subject relating to the world via representations, is defended by\nChristensen (1997, 1998). Christensen targets Dreyfus (1990) as a\nprominent and influential exponent of the intermittent-subject view.\nAmong other criticisms, Christensen accuses Dreyfus of\nmistakenly hearing Heidegger's clear rejection of the thought\nthat Dasein's access to the world is always theoretical (or\ntheory-like) in character as being, at the same time, a rejection of\nthe thought that Dasein's access to the world is always in the\nmode of a representing subject; but, argues Christensen, there may be\nnon-theoretical forms of the subject-world relation, so the claim that\nHeidegger advocated the second rejection is not established by pointing\nout that he advocated the first. Let's assume that Christensen is\nright about this. The supporter of the intermittent-subject view might\nstill argue that although Heidegger holds that Dasein\nsometimes emerges as a subject whose access to the world is\nnon-theoretical (plausibly, in certain cases of un-readiness-to-hand),\nthere is other textual evidence, beyond that which indicates the\nnon-theoretical character of hitch-free skilled activity, to suggest\nthat readiness-to-hand must remain non-subject-object in form. Whether\nor not there is such evidence would then need to be\nsettled.  \n\nWhat the existential analytic has given us so far is a\nphenomenological description of Dasein's within-the-world\nencounters with entities. The next clarification concerns the notion of\nworld and the associated within-ness of Dasein. Famously, Heidegger\nwrites of Dasein as Being-in-the-world. In effect, then, the\nnotion of Being-in-the-world provides us with a reinterpretation of the\nactivity of existing (Dreyfus 1990, 40), where existence is\ngiven the narrow reading (ek-sistence) identified earlier. Understood\nas a unitary phenomenon (as opposed to a contingent, additive,\ntripartite combination of Being, in-ness, and the world),\nBeing-in-the-world is an essential characteristic of Dasein. As\nHeidegger explains:  \n\nBeing-in is not a ‘property’ which Dasein sometimes has\nand sometimes does not have, and without which it could\nbe just as well as it could be with it. It is not the case\nthat man ‘is’ and then has, by way of an extra, a\nrelationship-of-Being towards the ‘world’—a world\nwith which he provides himself occasionally. Dasein is never\n‘proximally’ an entity which is, so to speak, free from\nBeing-in, but which sometimes has the inclination to take up a\n‘relationship’ towards the world. Taking up relationships\ntowards the world is possible only because Dasein, as\nBeing-in-the-world, is as it is. This state of Being does not arise\njust because some entity is present-at-hand outside of Dasein and meets\nup with it. Such an entity can ‘meet up with’ Dasein only\nin so far as it can, of its own accord, show itself within a\nworld. (Being and Time 12: 84) \n\nAs this passage makes clear, the Being-in dimension of\nBeing-in-the-world cannot be thought of as a merely spatial relation in\nsome sense that might be determined by a GPS device, since Dasein is\nnever just present-at-hand within the world in the way demanded by that\nsort of spatial in-ness. Heidegger sometimes uses the term\ndwelling to capture the distinctive manner in which Dasein is\nin the world. To dwell in a house is not merely to be inside it\nspatially in the sense just canvassed. Rather, it is to belong there,\nto have a familiar place there. It is in this sense that Dasein is\n(essentially) in the world. (Heidegger will later introduce an\nexistential notion of spatiality that does help to illuminate\nthe sense in which Dasein is in the world. More on that below.) So now,\nwhat is the world such that Dasein (essentially) dwells in it? To\nanswer this question we need to spend some time unpacking the\nHeideggerian concept of an ‘involvement’\n(Bewandtnis). \n\nThe German term Bewandtnis is extremely difficult to\ntranslate in a way that captures all its native nuances (for\ndiscussion, see Tugendhat 1967; thanks to a reviewer for emphasizing\nthis point). And things are made more complicated by the fact that,\nduring his exposition, Heidegger freely employs a number of closely\nrelated notions, including ‘assignment’,\n‘indication’ and ‘reference’. Nevertheless,\nwhat is clear is that Heidegger introduces the term that Macquarrie and\nRobinson translate as ‘involvement’ to express the roles\nthat equipmental entities play—the ways in which they are\ninvolved—in Dasein's everyday patterns of activity.\nCrucially, for Heidegger, an involvement is not a stand-alone\nstructure, but rather a link in a network of intelligibility that he\ncalls a totality of involvements. Take the stock Heideggerian\nexample: the hammer is involved in an act of hammering; that hammering\nis involved in making something fast; and that making something fast is\ninvolved in protecting the human agent against bad weather. Such\ntotalities of involvements are the contexts of everyday equipmental\npractice. As such, they define equipmental entities, so the\nhammer is intelligible as what it is only with respect to the shelter\nand, indeed, all the other items of equipment to which it meaningfully\nrelates in Dasein's everyday practices. This relational ontology\ngenerates what Brandom (1983, 391–3) calls Heidegger's\n‘strong systematicity condition’, as given voice in\nHeidegger's striking claim that “[t]aken strictly, there\n‘is’ no such thing as an equipment”\n(Being and Time, 15: 97). And this radical holism spreads,\nbecause once one begins to trace a path through a network of\ninvolvements, one will inevitably traverse vast regions of\ninvolvement-space. Thus links will be traced not only from hammers to\nhammering to making fast to protection against the weather, but also\nfrom hammers to pulling out nails to dismantling wardrobes to moving\nhouse. This behaviour will refer back to many other behaviours\n(packing, van-driving) and thus to many other items of equipment (large\nboxes, removal vans), and so on. The result is a large-scale holistic\nnetwork of interconnected relational significance. Such networks\nconstitute worlds, in one of Heidegger's key senses of\nthe term—an ontical sense that he describes as having a\npre-ontological signification (Being and Time 14:\n93). \n\nBefore a second key sense of the Heideggerian notion of world is\nrevealed, some important detail can be added to the emerging picture.\nHeidegger points out that involvements are not uniform structures. Thus\nI am currently working with a computer (a with-which), in the\npractical context of my office (an in-which), in order to\nwrite this encyclopedia entry (an in-order-to), which is aimed\ntowards presenting an introduction to Heidegger's philosophy (a\ntowards-this), for the sake of my academic work, that is, for\nthe sake of my being an academic (a for-the-sake-of-which).\nThe final involvement here, the for-the-sake-of-which, is crucial,\nbecause according to Heidegger all totalities of involvements have a\nlink of this type at their base. This forges a connection between (i)\nthe idea that each moment in Dasein's existence constitutes a\nbranch-point at which it chooses a way to be, and (ii) the claim that\nDasein's projects and possibilities are essentially bound up with\nthe ways in which other entities may become intelligible. This is\nbecause every for-the-sake-of-which is the base structure of an\nequipment-defining totality of involvements and reflects a\npossible way for Dasein to be (an academic, a carpenter, a parent, or\nwhatever). Moreover, given that entities are intelligible only within\ncontexts of activity that, so to speak, arrive with Dasein, this helps\nto explain Heidegger's claim (Being and Time 16: 107)\nthat, in encounters with entities, the world is something with which\nDasein is always already familiar. Finally, it puts further flesh on\nthe phenomenological category of the un-ready-to-hand. Thus when I am\nabsorbed in trouble-free typing, the computer and the role that it\nplays in my academic activity are transparent aspects of my experience.\nBut if the computer crashes, I become aware of it as an entity with\nwhich I was working in the practical context of my office, in order to\nwrite an encyclopedia entry aimed towards presenting an introduction to\nHeidegger's philosophy. And I become aware of the fact that my\nbehaviour is being organized for the sake of my being an academic. So\ndisturbances have the effect of exposing totalities of involvements\nand, therefore, worlds. (For a second way in which worlds are\nphenomenologically ‘lit up’, see Heidegger's analysis\nof signs (Being and Time 17:107–114); for discussion, see\nDreyfus 1990, 100–2, Cappuccio and Wheeler 2010.)\n \n\nAs already indicated, Heidegger sometimes uses the expression\n‘world’ in a different key sense, to designate what he\ncalls the “ontologico-existential concept of\nworldhood” (Being and Time 14: 93). At this\npoint in the existential analytic, worldhood is usefully identified as\nthe abstract network mode of organizational configuration that is\nshared by all concrete totalities of involvements. We shall see,\nhowever, that as the hermeneutic spiral of the text unfolds, the notion\nof worldhood is subject to a series of reinterpretations until,\nfinally, its deep structure gets played out in terms of temporality.\n \n\nHaving completed what we might think of as the first phase of the\nexistential analytic, Heidegger uses its results to launch an attack\non one of the front-line representatives of the tradition, namely\nDescartes. This is the only worked-through example in Being and\nTime itself of what Heidegger calls the destruction\n(Destruktion) of the Western philosophical tradition, a\nprocess that was supposed to be a prominent theme in the ultimately\nunwritten second part of the text. The aim is to show that although the\ntradition takes theoretical knowledge to be primary, such knowledge\n(the prioritization of which is an aspect of the\n‘onticization’ of Being mentioned earlier) presupposes the\nmore fundamental openness to Being that Heidegger has identified as an\nessential characteristic of Dasein. \n\nAccording to Heidegger, Descartes presents the world to us\n“with its skin off” (Being and Time 20: 132),\ni.e., as a collection of present-at-hand entities to be encountered by\nsubjects. The consequence of this prioritizing of the present-at-hand\nis that the subject needs to claw itself into a world of equipmental\nmeaning by adding what Heidegger calls ‘value-predicates’\n(context-dependent meanings) to the present-at-hand. In stark contrast,\nHeidegger's own view is that Dasein is in primary epistemic\ncontact not with context-independent present-at-hand primitives (e.g.,\nraw sense data, such as a ‘pure’ experience of a patch of\nred), to which context-dependent meaning would need to be added via\nvalue-predicates, but rather with equipment, the kind of entity whose\nmode of Being is readiness-to-hand and which therefore comes already\nladen with context-dependent significance. What is perhaps\nHeidegger's best statement of this opposition comes later in\nBeing and Time. \n\nWhat we ‘first’ hear is never noises or complexes of\nsounds, but the creaking waggon, the motor-cycle. We hear the\ncolumn on the march, the north wind, the woodpecker tapping, the fire\ncrackling… It requires a very artificial and complicated frame\nof mind to ‘hear’ a ‘pure noise’. The fact that\nmotor-cycles and waggons are what we proximally hear is the phenomenal\nevidence that in every case Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, already\ndwells alongside what is ready-to-hand within-the-world; it certainly\ndoes not dwell proximally alongside ‘sensations’; nor would\nit first have to give shape to the swirl of sensations to provide a\nspringboard from which the subject leaps off and finally arrives at a\n‘world’. Dasein, as essentially understanding, is\nproximally alongside what is understood. (Being and Time 34:\n207) \n\nFor Heidegger, then, we start not with the present-at-hand, moving\nto the ready-to-hand by adding value-predicates, but with the\nready-to-hand, moving to the present-at-hand by stripping away the\nholistic networks of everyday equipmental meaning. It seems clear,\nthen, that our two positions are diametrically opposed to each other,\nbut why should we favour Heidegger's framework over\nDescartes'? Heidegger's flagship argument here is that the\nsystematic addition of value-predicates to present-at-hand primitives\ncannot transform our encounters with those objects into encounters with\nequipment. It comes in the following brief but dense passage:\n“Adding on value-predicates cannot tell us anything at all new\nabout the Being of goods, but would merely presuppose again that goods\nhave pure presence-at-hand as their kind of Being. Values would then be\ndeterminate characteristics which a thing possesses, and they would be\npresent-at-hand”(Being and Time 21: 132). In\nother words, once we have assumed that we begin with the\npresent-at-hand, values must take the form of determinate features of\nobjects, and therefore constitute nothing but more present-at-hand\nstructures. And if you add more present-at-hand structures to some\nexisting present-at-hand structures, what you end up with is not\nequipmental meaning (totalities of involvements) but merely a larger\nnumber of present-at-hand structures. \n\nHeidegger's argument here is (at best) incomplete (for\ndiscussion, see Dreyfus 1990, Wheeler 2005). The defender of\nCartesianism might concede that present-at-hand entities have\ndeterminate properties, but wonder why the fact that an entity has\ndeterminate properties is necessarily an indication of\npresence-at-hand. On this view, having determinate properties is\nnecessary but not sufficient for an entity to be present-at-hand. More\nspecifically, she might wonder why involvements cannot be thought of as\ndeterminate features that entities possess just when they are\nembedded in certain contexts of use. Consider for example the\nvarious involvements specified in the academic writing context\ndescribed earlier. They certainly seem to be determinate, albeit\ncontext-relative, properties of the computer. Of course, the massively\nholistic character of totalities of involvements would make the task of\nspecifying the necessary value-predicates (say, as sets of internal\nrepresentations) incredibly hard, but it is unclear that it makes that\ntask impossible. So it seems as if Heidegger doesn't really\ndevelop his case in sufficient detail. However, Dreyfus (1990) pursues\na response that Heidegger might have given, one that draws on the\nfamiliar philosophical distinction between knowing-how and\nknowing-that. It seems that value-predicates constitute a form of\nknowing-that (i.e., knowing that an entity has a certain\ncontext-dependent property) whereas the circumspective knowledge of\ntotalities of involvements (Dasein's skilled practical activity)\nconstitutes a form of knowing-how (i.e., knowing how to use equipment in\nappropriate ways; see the characterization of readiness-to-hand given\nearlier). Given the plausible (although not universally held)\nassumption that knowing-how cannot be reduced to knowledge-that, this\nwould explain why value-predicates are simply the wrong sort of\nstructures to capture the phenomenon of world-embeddedness. \n\nIn the wake of his critique of Cartesianism, Heidegger turns his\nattention to spatiality. He argues that Dasein dwells in the world in a\nspatial manner, but that the spatiality in question—Dasein's existential spatiality—cannot be a matter of\nDasein being located at a particular co-ordinate in physical, Cartesian\nspace. That would be to conceive of Dasein as present-at-hand, and\npresence-at-hand is a mode of Being that can belong only to entities\nother than Dasein. According to Heidegger, the existential spatiality\nof Dasein is characterized most fundamentally by what he calls\nde-severance, a bringing close.\n“ ‘De-severing’ amounts to making the farness vanish—that is, making the remoteness of something disappear, bringing\nit close” (Being and Time: 23: 139). This is of course\nnot a bringing close in the sense of reducing physical distance,\nalthough it may involve that. Heidegger's proposal is that\nspatiality as de-severance is in some way (exactly how is a matter of\nsubtle interpretation; see e.g., Malpas 2006) intimately related to the\n‘reach’ of Dasein's skilled practical activity. For\nexample, an entity is ‘near by’ if it is readily available\nfor some such activity, and ‘far away’ if it is not,\nwhatever physical distances may be involved. Given the Dasein-world\nrelationship highlighted above, the implication (drawn explicitly by\nHeidegger, see Being and Time 22: 136) is that the spatiality\ndistinctive of equipmental entities, and thus of the world, is not\nequivalent to physical, Cartesian space. Equipmental space is a matter\nof pragmatically determined regions of functional places, defined by\nDasein-centred totalities of involvements (e.g., an office with places\nfor the computers, the photocopier, and so on—places that are\ndefined by the way in which they make these equipmental entities\navailable in the right sort of way for skilled activity). For\nHeidegger, physical, Cartesian space is possible as something\nmeaningful for Dasein only because Dasein has de-severance as one of\nits existential characteristics. Given the intertwining of de-severance\nand equipmental space, this licenses the radical view (one that is\nconsistent with Heidegger's prior treatment of Cartesianism) that\nphysical, Cartesian space (as something that we can find intelligible)\npresupposes equipmental space; the former is the present-at-hand\nphenomenon that is revealed if we strip away the worldhood from the\nlatter.  \n\nMalpas (forthcoming) rejects the account of spatiality given in\nBeing and Time. Drawing on Kant, he argues that “[any]\nagent, insofar as it is capable of action at all (that is, insofar as\nit is, indeed, an agent), acts in a space that is an objective space,\nin which other agents also act, and yet which is always immediately\nconfigured subjectively in terms of the agent's own oriented\nlocatedness” (Malpas forthcoming, 14). According to Malpas, then,\nequipmental space (a space ordered in terms of practical activity and\nwithin which an agent acts) presupposes a more fundamental notion of\nspace as a complex unity with objective, intersubjective and subjective\ndimensions. If this is right, then of course equipmental space cannot\nitself explain the spatial. A further problem, as Malpas also notes, is\nthat the whole issue of spatiality brings into sharp focus the awkward\nrelationship that Heidegger has with the body in Being and\nTime. In what is now a frequently quoted remark, Heidegger sets\naside Dasein's embodiment, commenting that “this\n‘bodily nature’ hides a whole problematic of its own,\nthough we shall not treat it here” (Being and Time 23:\n143). Indeed, at times, Heidegger might be interpreted as linking\nembodiment with Thinghood. For example: “[as] Dasein goes along\nits ways, it does not measure off a stretch of space as a corporeal\nThing which is present-at-hand” (Being and Time 23:\n140). Here one might plausibly contain the spread of presence-at-hand\nby appealing to a distinction between material (present-at-hand) and\nlived (existential) ways in which Dasein is embodied. Unfortunately\nthis distinction isn't made in Being and Time (a point\nnoted by Ricoeur 1992, 327), although Heidegger does adopt it in the\nmuch later Seminar in Le Thor (see Malpas forthcoming, 5).\nWhat seems clear, however, is that while the Heidegger of Being and\nTime seems to hold that Dasein's embodiment somehow depends\non its existential spatiality (see e.g., 23: 143), the more obvious\nthing to say is that Dasein's existential spatiality somehow\ndepends on its embodiment. \n\nBefore leaving this issue, it is worth noting briefly that space\nreappears later in Being and Time (70: 418–21), where\nHeidegger argues that existential space is derived from temporality.\nThis makes sense within Heidegger's overall project, because, as\nwe shall see, the deep structure of totalities of involvements (and\nthus of equipmental space) is finally understood in terms of\ntemporality. Nevertheless, and although the distinctive character of\nHeidegger's concept of temporality needs to be recognized, there\nis reason to think that the dependency here may well travel in the\nopposite direction. The worry, as Malpas (forthcoming, 26) again points\nout, has a Kantian origin. Kant (1781/1999) argued that the temporal\ncharacter of inner sense is possible only because it is mediated by\nouter intuition whose form is space. If this is right, and if we can\ngeneralize appropriately, then the temporality that matters to\nHeidegger will be dependent on existential spatiality, and not the\nother way round. All in all, one is tempted to conclude that\nHeidegger's treatment of spatiality in Being and Time,\nand (relatedly) his treatment (or lack of it) of the body, face serious\ndifficulties.  \n\nHeidegger turns next to the question of “who it is\nthat Dasein is in its everydayness” (Being and Time,\nIntroduction to IV: 149). He rejects the idea of Dasein as a Cartesian\n‘I-thing’ (the Cartesian thinking thing conceived as a\nsubstance), since once again this would be to think of Dasein as\npresent-at-hand. In searching for an alternative answer, Heidegger\nobserves that equipment is often revealed to us as being for the sake\nof (the lives and projects of) other Dasein. \nThe boat anchored at the shore is assigned in its Being-in-itself to\nan acquaintance who undertakes voyages with it; but even if it is a\n‘boat which is strange to us’, it still is indicative of\nOthers. The Others who are thus ‘encountered’ in a\nready-to-hand, environmental context of equipment, are not somehow\nadded on in thought to some Thing which is proximally just\npresent-at-hand; such ‘Things’ are encountered from out of\na world in which they are ready-to-hand for Others—a world\nwhich is always mine too in advance. (Being and Time 26:\n154) \n\nOn the basis of such observations, Heidegger argues that to be\nDasein at all means to Be-with: “So far as Dasein is at all, it\nhas Being-with-one-another as its kind of Being” (Being and\nTime 26: 163). One's immediate response to this might be\nthat it is just false. After all, ordinary experience establishes that\neach of us is often alone. But of course Heidegger is thinking in an\nontological register. Being-with (Mitsein) is thus\nthe a priori transcendental condition that makes it possible that\nDasein can discover equipment in this Other-related fashion. And\nit's because Dasein has Being-with as one of its essential modes\nof Being that everyday Dasein can experience being alone. Being-with is\nthus the a priori transcendental condition for loneliness. \n\nIt is important to understand what Heidegger means by\n‘Others’, a term that he uses interchangeably with the more\nevocative ‘the “they” ’ (das Man). He\nexplains:  \nBy ‘Others’ we do not mean everyone else\nbut me—those over against whom the ‘I’ stands out.\nThey are rather those from whom, for the most part, one does not\ndistinguish oneself—those among whom one is too… By\nreason of this with-like Being-in-the-world, the world is\nalways the one that I share with Others. (Being and Time\n26: 154–5) \n \nA piece of data (cited by Dreyfus 1990) helps to illuminate this\nidea. Each society seems to have its own sense of what counts as an\nappropriate distance to stand from someone during verbal\ncommunication, and this varies depending on whether the other person\nis a lover, a friend, a colleague, or a business acquaintance, and on\nwhether communication is taking place in noisy or quiet circumstances.\nSuch standing-distance practices are of course normative, in that they\ninvolve a sense of what one should and shouldn't do. And the norms in\nquestion are culturally specific. So what this example illustrates is\nthat the phenomenon of the Others, the ‘who’ of everyday\nDasein, the group from whom for the most part I do not stand out, is\nmy culture, understood not as the sum of all its members, but as an\nontological phenomenon in its own right. This explains the following\nstriking remark. “The ‘who’ is not this one, not\nthat one, not oneself, not some people, and not the sum of them\nall. The ‘who’ is the neuter, the\n‘they’ ” (Being and Time 27:\n164). Another way to capture this idea is to say that what I do is\ndetermined largely by ‘what one does’, and ‘what one\ndoes’ is something that I absorb in various ways from my\nculture. Thus Dreyfus (1990) prefers to translate das Man not\nas ‘the “they” ’, but as ‘the\none’. \n\nThis all throws important light on the phenomenon of world, since we\ncan now see that the crucial for-the-sake-of-which structure that\nstands at the base of each totality of involvements is culturally and\nhistorically conditioned. The specific ways in which I behave for the\nsake of being an academic are what one does if one wants to be\nconsidered a good academic, at this particular time, in this particular\nhistorically embedded culture (carrying out research, tutoring\nstudents, giving lectures, and so on). As Heidegger himself puts the\npoint: “Dasein is for the sake of the ‘they’ in an\neveryday manner, and the ‘they’ itself articulates the\nreferential context of significance” (Being and Time 27:\n167). Worlds (the referential context of significance, networks of\ninvolvements) are then culturally and historically conditioned, from\nwhich several things seem to follow. First, Dasein's everyday\nworld is, in the first instance, and of its very essence, a shared\nworld. Second, Being-with and Being-in-the-world are, if not\nequivalent, deeply intertwined. And third, the sense in which worlds\nare Dasein-dependent involves some sort of cultural relativism,\nalthough, as we shall see later, this final issue is one that needs\ncareful interpretative handling. \n\nCritics of the manner in which Heidegger develops the notion of\nBeing-with have often focussed, albeit in different ways, on the\nthought that Heidegger either ignores or misconceives the fundamental\ncharacter of our social existence by passing over its grounding in\ndirect interpersonal interaction (see e.g., Löwith 1928, Binswanger\n1943/1964, Gallagher and Jacobson forthcoming). From this perspective,\nthe equipmentally mediated discovery of others that Heidegger sometimes\ndescribes (see above) is at best a secondary process that reveals other\npeople only to the extent that they are relevant to Dasein's\npractical projects. Moreover, Olafson (1987) argues that although\nHeidegger's account clearly involves the idea that Dasein\ndiscovers socially shared equipmental meaning (which then presumably\nsupports the discovery of other Dasein along with equipment), that\naccount fails to explain why this must be the case. Processes\nof direct interpersonal contact (e.g., in learning the use of equipment\nfrom others) might plausibly fill this gap. The obvious move for\nHeidegger to make here is to claim that the processes that the critics\nfind to be missing from his account, although genuine, are not a\npriori, transcendental structures of Dasein. Rather, they are\npsychological factors that enable (in a ‘merely’\ndevelopmental or causal way) human beings to realize the phenomenon of\nBeing-with (see e.g., Heidegger's response to the existentialist\npsychologist and therapist Binswanger in the Zollikon\nseminars, and see Dreyfus 1990, chapter 8, for a response to\nOlafson that exploits this point). However, one might wonder whether it\nis plausible to relegate the social processes in question to the status\nof ‘mere’ enabling factors (Gallagher and Jacobson\nforthcoming; Pöggeler 1989 might be read as making a similar\ncomplaint). If not, then Heidegger's notion of Being-with is at\nbest an incomplete account of our social Being. \n\nThe introduction of the ‘they’ is followed by a further\nlayer of interpretation in which Heidegger understands\nBeing-in-the-world in terms of (what he calls) thrownness,\nprojection and fallen-ness, and (interrelatedly) in terms\nof Dasein as a dynamic combination of disposedness,\nunderstanding and fascination with the world. In\neffect, this is a reformulation of the point that Dasein is the\nhaving-to-be-open, i.e., that it is an a priori structure of our\nexistential constitution that we operate with the capacity to\ntake-other-beings-as. Dasein's existence (ek-sistence)\nis thus now to be understood by way of an interconnected pair of\nthree-dimensional unitary structures: thrownness-projection-fallen-ness\nand disposedness-understanding-fascination. Each of these can be used\nto express the “formally existential totality of Dasein's\nontological structural whole” (Being and Time 42: 237),\na phenomenon that Heidegger also refers to as disclosedness or\ncare. Crucially, it is with the configuration of care that we\nencounter the first tentative emergence of temporality as a theme in\nBeing and Time, since the dimensionality of care will\nultimately be interpreted in terms of the three temporal dimensions:\npast (thrownness/disposedness), future (projection/understanding), and\npresent (fallen-ness/fascination). \n\nAs Dasein, I ineluctably find myself in a world that matters to me\nin some way or another. This is what Heidegger calls\nthrownness (Geworfenheit), a having-been-thrown into\nthe world. ‘Disposedness’ is Kisiel's (2002)\ntranslation of Befindlichkeit, a term rendered somewhat\ninfelicitously by Macquarrie and Robinson as\n‘state-of-mind’.\nDisposedness is the receptiveness (the just finding things mattering\nto one) of Dasein, which explains why Richardson (1963) renders\nBefindlichkeit as\n‘already-having-found-oneself-there-ness’. To make things\nless abstract, we can note that disposedness is the a priori\ntranscendental condition for, and thus shows up pre-ontologically in,\nthe everyday phenomenon of mood (Stimmung). According\nto Heidegger's analysis, I am always in some mood or other. Thus\nsay I'm depressed, such that the world opens up (is disclosed) to\nme as a sombre and gloomy place. I might be able to shift myself out of\nthat mood, but only to enter a different one, say euphoria or lethargy,\na mood that will open up the world to me in a different way. As one\nmight expect, Heidegger argues that moods are not inner subjective\ncolourings laid over an objectively given world (which at root is why\n‘state-of-mind’ is a potentially misleading translation of\nBefindlichkeit, given that this term names the underlying a\npriori condition for moods). For Heidegger, moods (and disposedness)\nare aspects of what it means to be in a world at all, not subjective\nadditions to that in-ness. Here it is worth noting that some aspects of\nour ordinary linguistic usage reflect this anti-subjectivist reading.\nThus we talk of being in a mood rather than a mood being in us, and we\nhave no problem making sense of the idea of public moods (e.g., the mood\nof a crowd). In noting these features of moods we must be careful,\nhowever. It would be a mistake to conclude from them that moods are\nexternal, rather than internal, states. A mood “comes neither\nfrom ‘outside’ nor from ‘inside’, but arises\nout of Being-in-the-world, as a way of such being” (Being and\nTime 29: 176). Nevertheless, the idea that moods have a social\ncharacter does point us towards a striking implication of\nHeidegger's overall framework: with Being-in-the-world identified\npreviously as a kind of cultural co-embeddedness, it follows that the\nrepertoire of world-disclosing moods in which I might find myself will\nitself be culturally conditioned. (For recent philosophical work that\nbuilds, in part, on Heidegger's treatment of moods, in order to\nidentify and understand certain affective phenomena—dubbed\n‘existential feelings’—that help us to understand\nvarious forms of psychiatric illness, see Ratcliffe 2008.)\n \n\nDasein confronts every concrete situation in which it finds itself\n(into which it has been thrown) as a range of possibilities for acting\n(onto which it may project itself). Insofar as some of these\npossibilities are actualized, others will not be, meaning that there is\na sense in which not-Being (a set of unactualized possibilities of\nBeing) is a structural component of Dasein's Being. Out of this\ndynamic interplay, Dasein emerges as a delicate balance of\ndetermination (thrownness) and freedom (projection). The projective\npossibilities available to Dasein are delineated by totalities of\ninvolvements, structures that, as we have seen, embody the culturally\nconditioned ways in which Dasein may inhabit the world. Understanding\nis the process by which Dasein projects itself onto such possibilities.\nCrucially, understanding as projection is not conceived, by Heidegger,\nas involving, in any fundamental way, conscious or deliberate\nforward-planning. Projection “has nothing to do with comporting\noneself towards a plan that has been thought out” (Being and\nTime 31: 185). The primary realization of understanding is as\nskilled activity in the domain of the ready-to-hand, but it can be\nmanifested as interpretation, when Dasein explicitly takes\nsomething as something (e.g., in cases of disturbance), and\nalso as linguistic assertion, when Dasein uses language to attribute a\ndefinite character to an entity as a mere present-at-hand object. (NB:\nassertion of the sort indicated here is of course just one linguistic\npractice among many; it does not in any way exhaust the phenomenon of\nlanguage or its ontological contribution.) Another way of putting the\npoint that culturally conditioned totalities of involvements define the\nspace of Dasein's projection onto possibilities is to say that\nsuch totalities constitute the fore-structures of Dasein's\npractices of understanding and interpretation, practices that, as we\nhave just seen, are projectively oriented manifestations of the\ntaking-as activity that forms the existential core of Dasein's\nBeing. What this tells us is that the hermeneutic circle is the\n“essential fore-structure of Dasein itself” (Being and\nTime 32: 195). \n\nThrownness and projection provide two of the three dimensions of\ncare. The third is fallen-ness. “Dasein has, in the\nfirst instance, fallen away from itself as an authentic potentiality\nfor Being its Self, and has fallen into the world” (Being and\nTime 38: 220). Such fallen-ness into the world is manifested in\nidle talk (roughly, conversing in a critically unexamined and\nunexamining way about facts and information while failing to use\nlanguage to reveal their relevance), curiosity (a search for\nnovelty and endless stimulation rather than belonging or dwelling), and\nambiguity (a loss of any sensitivity to the distinction\nbetween genuine understanding and superficial chatter). Each of these\naspects of fallen-ness involves a closing off or covering up of the\nworld (more precisely, of any real understanding of the world) through\na fascination with it. What is crucial here is that this\nworld-obscuring process of fallen-ness/fascination, as manifested in\nidle talk, curiosity and ambiguity, is to be understood as\nDasein's everyday mode of Being-with. In its everyday form,\nBeing-with exhibits what Heidegger calls levelling or\naverageness—a “Being-lost in the publicness of\nthe ‘they’ ” (Being and Time 38: 220). Here,\nin dramatic language, is how he makes the point. \nIn utilizing public means of transport and in making use of\ninformation services such as the newspaper, every Other is like the\nnext. This Being-with-one-another dissolves one's own Dasein\ncompletely into a kind of Being of ‘the Others’, in such a\nway, indeed, that the Others, as distinguishable and explicit, vanish\nmore and more. In this inconspicuousness and unascertainability, the\nreal dictatorship of the ‘they’ is unfolded. We take\npleasure and enjoy ourselves as they take pleasure; we read,\nsee, and judge about literature and art as they see and judge;\nlikewise we shrink back from the ‘great mass’ as\nthey shrink back; we find ‘shocking’ what\nthey find shocking. The ‘they’, which is nothing\ndefinite, and which all are, though not as the sum, prescribes the kind\nof Being of everydayness. (Being and Time 27: 164) \n\nThis analysis opens up a path to Heidegger's distinction\nbetween the authentic self and its inauthentic counterpart. At root,\n‘authentic’ means ‘my own’. So the authentic\nself is the self that is mine (leading a life that, in a sense to be\nexplained, is owned by me), whereas the inauthentic self is the fallen\nself, the self lost to the ‘they’. Hence we might call the\nauthentic self the ‘mine-self’, and the inauthentic self\nthe ‘they-self’, the latter term also serving to\nemphasize the point that fallen-ness is a mode of the self, not of\nothers. Moreover, as a mode of the self, fallen-ness is not an\naccidental feature of Dasein, but rather part of Dasein's\nexistential constitution. It is a dimension of care, which is the Being\nof Dasein. So, in the specific sense that fallen-ness (the they-self)\nis an essential part of our Being, we are ultimately each to blame for\nour own inauthenticity (Sheehan 2002). Of course, one shouldn't\nconclude from all this talk of submersion in the ‘they’\nthat a state of authenticity is to be achieved by re-establishing some\nversion of a self-sufficient individual subject. As Heidegger puts it:\n“Authentic Being-one's-Self does not rest upon an\nexceptional condition of the subject, a condition that has been\ndetached from the ‘they’; it is rather an existentiell\nmodification of the ‘they’ ” (Being and Time\n27: 168). So authenticity is not about being isolated from others, but\nrather about finding a different way of relating to others such that\none is not lost to the they-self. It is in Division 2 of Being and\nTime that authenticity, so understood, becomes a central\ntheme. \n\nAs the argument of Being and Time continues its\never-widening hermeneutic spiral into Division 2 of the text, Heidegger\nannounces a twofold transition in the analysis. He argues that we\nshould (i) pay proper heed to the thought that to understand Dasein we\nneed to understand Dasein's existence as a whole, and\n(ii) shift the main focus of our attention from the inauthentic self\n(the they-self) to the authentic self (the mine-self) (Being and\nTime 45: 276). Both of these transitions figure in\nHeidegger's discussion of death. \n\nSo far, Dasein's existence has been understood as thrown\nprojection plus falling. The projective aspect of this phenomenon means\nthat, at each moment of its life, Dasein is Being-ahead-of-itself,\noriented towards the realm of its possibilities, and is thus\nincomplete. Death completes Dasein's existence. Therefore, an\nunderstanding of Dasein's relation to death would make an\nessential contribution to our understanding of Dasein as a whole. But\nnow a problem immediately presents itself: since one cannot experience\none's own death, it seems that the kind of phenomenological\nanalysis that has hitherto driven the argument of Being and\nTime breaks\ndown, right at the crucial moment. One possible response to this worry,\ncanvassed explicitly by Heidegger, is to suggest that Dasein\nunderstands death through experiencing the death of others. However,\nthe sense in which we experience the death of others falls short of\nwhat is needed. We mourn departed others and miss their presence in the\nworld. But that is to experience Being-with them as dead, which is a\nmode of our continued existence. As Heidegger explains: \nThe greater the phenomenal appropriateness with which we take the\nno-longer-Dasein of the deceased, the more plainly is it shown that in\nsuch Being-with the dead, the authentic Being-come-to-an-end of the\ndeceased is precisely the sort of thing which we do not\nexperience. Death does indeed reveal itself as a loss, but a loss such\nas is experienced by those who remain. In suffering this loss, however,\nwe have no way of access to the loss-of-Being as such which the dying\nman ‘suffers’. The dying of Others is not something which\nwe experience in a genuine sense; at most we are always just\n‘there alongside’. (Being and Time 47: 282) \n\nWhat we don't have, then, is phenomenological access to the\nloss of Being that the dead person has suffered. But that, it seems, is\nprecisely what we would need in order to carry through the favoured\nanalysis. So another response is called for. Heidegger's move is\nto suggest that although Dasein cannot experience its own death as\nactual, it can relate towards its own death as a possibility that is\nalways before it—always before it in the sense that\nDasein's own death is inevitable. Peculiarly among Dasein's\npossibilities, the possibility of Dasein's own death must remain\nonly a possibility, since once it becomes actual, Dasein is no longer.\nDeath is thus the “possibility of the impossibility of any\nexistence at all” (Being and Time 53: 307). And it is\nthis awareness of death as an omnipresent possibility that cannot\nbecome actual that stops the phenomenological analysis from breaking\ndown. The detail here is crucial. What the failure of the ‘death\nof others’ strategy indicates is that in each instance death is\ninextricably tied to some specific individual Dasein. My death is mine\nin a radical sense; it is the moment at which all my relations to\nothers disappear. Heidegger captures this non-relationality by using\nthe term ‘ownmost’. And it is the idea of death “as\nthat possibility which is one's ownmost” (Being and\nTime 50: 294) that engages the second transition highlighted\nabove. When I take on board the possibility of my own not-Being, my own\nbeing-able-to-Be is brought into proper view. Hence my awareness of my\nown death as an omnipresent possibility discloses the authentic self (a\nself that is mine). Moreover, the very same awareness engages the first\nof the aforementioned transitions too: there is a sense in which the\npossibility of my not existing encompasses the whole of my existence\n(Hinman 1978, 201), and my awareness of that possibility illuminates\nme, qua Dasein, in my totality. Indeed, my own death is\nrevealed to me as inevitable, meaning that Dasein is essentially\nfinite. This explains why Heidegger says that death is disclosed to\nDasein as a possibility which is “not to be outstripped”\n(Being and Time 50: 294). \n\nHeidegger's account of Dasein's relation towards the\npossibility of its own not-Being forms the backbone of a\nreinterpretation of the phenomenon of care—the “formally\nexistential totality of Dasein's ontological structural\nwhole” (Being and Time 41: 237). Care is now interpreted\nin terms of Being-towards-death, meaning that Dasein has an internal\nrelation to the nothing (i.e., to not-being; see Vallega-Neu 2003, 21,\nfor an analysis that links this ‘not’ quality to the point\nmade earlier that sets of unactualized possibilities of Being are\nstructural components of Dasein's Being). As one might expect,\nHeidegger argues that Being-towards-death not only has the\nthree-dimensional character of care, but is realized in authentic and\ninauthentic modes. Let's begin with the authentic mode. We can\nthink of the aforementioned individualizing effect of Dasein's\nawareness of the possibility of its own not-Being (an awareness that\nilluminates its own being-able-to-Be) as an event in which Dasein\nprojects onto a possible way to be, in the technical sense of such\npossibilities introduced earlier in Being and Time. It is thus\nan event in which Dasein projects onto a for-the-sake-of-which, a\npossible way to be. More particularly, given the authentic character of\nthe phenomenon, it is an event in which Dasein projects onto a\nfor-the-sake-of-itself. Heidegger now coins the term\nanticipation to express the form of projection in which one\nlooks forward to a possible way to be. Given the analysis of death as a\npossibility, the authentic form of projection in the case of death is\nanticipation. Indeed Heidegger often uses the term anticipation in a\nnarrow way, simply to mean being aware of death as a possibility. But\ndeath is disclosed authentically not only in projection (the first\ndimension of care) but also in thrownness (the second dimension). The\nkey phenomenon here is the mode of disposedness that Heidegger calls\nanxiety. Anxiety, at least in the form in which Heidegger is\ninterested, is not directed towards some specific object, but rather\nopens up the world to me in a certain distinctive way. When I am\nanxious I am no longer at home in the world. I fail to find the world\nintelligible. Thus there is an ontological sense (one to do with\nintelligibility) in which I am not in the world, and the possibility of\na world without me (the possibility of my not-Being-in-the-world) is\nrevealed to me. “[The] state-of-mind [mode of disposedness] which\ncan hold open the utter and constant threat to itself arising from\nDasein's ownmost individualized Being, is anxiety. In this\nstate-of-mind, Dasein finds itself face to face with the\n‘nothing’ of the possible impossibility of its\nexistence” (Being and Time 53: 310). Heidegger has now\nreinterpreted two of the three dimensions of care, in the light of\nDasein's essential finitude. But now what about the third\ndimension, identified previously as fallen-ness? Since we are presently\nconsidering a mode of authentic, i.e., not fallen, Dasein, it seems that\nfallen-ness cannot be a feature of this realization of care, and indeed\nthat a general reformulation of the care structure is called for in\norder to allow for authentic Being. This is an issue that will be\naddressed in the next section. First, though, the inauthentic form of\nBeing-towards-death needs to be brought into view. \n\nIn everyday Being-towards-death, the self that figures in the\nfor-the-sake-of-itself structure is not the authentic mine-self, but\nrather the inauthentic they-self. In effect, the ‘they’\nobscures our awareness of the meaning of our own deaths by\nde-individualizing death. As Heidegger explains: in\n“Dasein's public way of interpreting, it is said that\n‘one dies’, because everyone else and oneself can talk\nhimself into saying that ‘in no case is it I myself’, for this\n‘one’ is the ‘nobody’ ” (Being and Time 51:\n297). In this way, everyday Dasein flees from the meaning of its own\ndeath, in a manner determined by the ‘they’. It is in this\nevasion in the face of death, interpreted as a further way in which\nDasein covers up Being, that everyday Dasein's fallen-ness now\nmanifests itself. To be clear: evasion here does not necessarily mean\nthat I refuse outright to acknowledge that I will someday die. After\nall, as I might say, ‘everyone dies’. However, the\ncertainty of death achieved by idle talk of this kind is of the wrong\nsort. One might think of it as established by the conclusion of some\nsort of inductive inference from observations of many cases of death\n(the deaths of many others). But “we cannot compute the certainty\nof death by ascertaining how many cases of death we encounter”\n(Being and Time 53: 309). \n\nThe certainty brought into view by such an inference is a sort of\nempirical certainty, one which conceals the apodictic character of the\ninevitability with which my own death is authentically revealed to me\n(Being and Time 52: 301). In addition, as we have seen,\naccording to Heidegger, my own death can never be actual for me, so\nviewed from my perspective, any case of death, i.e., any actual death,\ncannot be my death. Thus it must be a death that belongs to someone\nelse, or rather, to no one. \n\nInauthenticity in relation to death is also realized in thrownness,\nthrough fear, and in projection, through expectation.\nFear, as a mode of disposedness, can disclose only particular oncoming\nevents in the world. To fear my own death, then, is once again\nto treat my death as a case of death. This contrasts with anxiety, the\nform of disposedness which, as we have seen, discloses my death via the\nawareness of the possibility of a world in which I am not. The\nprojective analogue to the fear-anxiety distinction is\nexpectation-anticipation. A mundane example might help to illustrate\nthe generic idea. When I expect a beer to taste a certain way, I am\nwaiting for an actual event—a case of that distinctive taste in\nmy mouth—to occur. By contrast, when I anticipate the taste of\nthat beer, one might say that, in a cognitive sense, I actively go out\nto meet the possibility of that taste. In so doing, I make it mine.\nExpecting death is thus to wait for a case of death, whereas to\nanticipate death is to own it.  \nIn reinterpreting care in terms of Being-towards-death, Heidegger\nilluminates in a new way the taking-as structure that, as we have seen,\nhe takes to be the essence of human existence. Human beings, as Dasein,\nare essentially finite. And it is this\nfinitude that explains why the phenomenon of taking-as is an\nessential characteristic of our existence. An infinite Being would\nunderstand things directly, without the need for interpretative\nintercession. We, however, are Dasein, and in our essential finitude we\nmust understand things in a hermeneutically mediated, indirect way,\nthat is, by taking-as (Sheehan 2001).  What are we to make of Heidegger's analysis of death? Perhaps\nthe most compelling reason for being sceptical can be found in Sartre,\nwho argued that just as death cannot be actual for me, it cannot be one\nof my possibilities either, at least if the term\n‘possibility’ is understood, as Heidegger surely intends it\nto be, as marking a way of my Being, an intelligible way for me to be.\nSartre argues that death is the end of such possibilities. Thus:\n \n[The] perpetual appearance of chance at the heart of my projects\ncannot be apprehended as my possibility but, on the contrary, as the\nnihilation of all my possibilities. A nihilation which itself is no\nlonger a part of my possibilities. Thus death is not my possibility of\nno longer realizing a presence in the world but rather an always\npossible nihilation of my possibilities which is outside my\npossibilities. (Sartre 1956, 537) \nIf Sartre is right, there is a\nsignificant hole in Heidegger's project, since we would be left\nwithout a way of completing the phenomenological analysis of\nDasein. \n\nFor further debate over Heidegger's handling of death, see\nEdwards' (1975, 1976, 2004) unsympathetic broadsides alongside\nHinman's (1978) robust response. Carel (2006) develops an\nanalysis that productively connects Heidegger's and\nFreud's accounts of death, despite Heidegger's open\nantipathy towards Freud's theories in general. \n\nIn some of the most difficult sections of Being and Time,\nHeidegger now begins to close in on the claim that temporality is the\nontological meaning of Dasein's Being as care. The key notion\nhere is that of anticipatory resoluteness, which Heidegger identifies\nas an (or perhaps the) authentic mode of care. As we have\nseen, anticipation is the form of Being-towards in which one looks\nforward to a possible way to be. Bringing resoluteness into\nview requires further groundwork that begins with Heidegger's\nreinterpretation of the authentic self in terms of the phenomenon of\nconscience or Being-guilty. The authentic self is characterized by\nBeing-guilty. This does not mean that authenticity requires actually\nfeeling guilty. Rather, the authentic self is the one who is open\nto the call of conscience. The inauthentic self, by contrast, is\nclosed to conscience and guilt. It is tempting to think that this is\nwhere Heidegger does ethics. However, guilt as an existential structure\nis not to be understood as some psychological feeling that one gets\nwhen one transgresses some moral code. If the term ‘guilt’\nis to be heard in an ethical register at all, the phenomenon of\nBeing-guilty will, for Heidegger, be the a priori condition for there\nto be moral codes, not the psychological result of transgressions of\nthose codes. Having said that, however, it may be misleading to adopt\nan ethical register here. For Heidegger, conscience is fundamentally a\ndisclosive rather than an ethical phenomenon. What is more important\nfor the project of Being and Time, then, is the claim that the\ncall of conscience interrupts Dasein's everyday fascination with\nentities by summoning Dasein back to its own finitude and thereby to\nauthenticity. To see how the call of conscience achieves this, we need\nto unpack Heidegger's reformulation of conscience in terms of\nanticipatory resoluteness.  \n\nIn the by-now familiar pattern, Heidegger argues that conscience\n(Being-guilty) has the structure of care. However, there's now a\nmodification to the picture, presumably driven by a factor mentioned\nearlier, namely that authentic Dasein is not fallen. Since conscience\nis a mode of authentic Dasein, fallen-ness cannot be one of the\ndimensions of conscience. So the three elements of care are now\nidentified as projection, thrownness and discourse. What is\ndiscourse? It clearly has something to do with articulation, and it is\ntempting to make a connection with language, but in truth this aspect\nof Heidegger's view is somewhat murky. Heidegger says that the\n“intelligibility of Being-in-the-world… expresses itself\nas discourse” (Being and Time 34: 204). But this might\nmean that intelligibility is essentially a linguistic phenomenon; or it\nmight mean that discourse is intelligibility as put into language.\nThere is even room for the view that discourse is not necessarily a\nlinguistic phenomenon at all, but rather any way in which the\nreferential structure of significance is articulated, either by deeds\n(e.g., by hammering) or by words (see e.g., Dreyfus 1991, 215; Dreyfus\ntranslates the German term Rede not as ‘discourse’\nbut as ‘telling’, and notes the existence of non-linguistic\ntellings such as telling the time). But however we settle that point of\ninterpretation, there is something untidy about the status of discourse\nin relation to fallen-ness and authenticity. Elsewhere in Being and\nTime, the text strongly suggests that discourse has inauthentic\nmodes, for instance when it is manifested as idle talk; and in yet\nother sections we find the claim that fallen-ness has an authentic\nmanifestation called a moment-of-vision (e.g., Being and\nTime 68: 401). Regarding the general relations between discourse,\nfallen-ness and authenticity, then, the conceptual landscape is not\nentirely clear. Nevertheless, we can say this: when care is realized\nauthentically, I experience discourse as reticence, as a\nkeeping silent (ignoring the chatter of idle talk) so that I may hear\nthe call of conscience; I experience projection onto guilt as a\npossible way of Being in which I take responsibility for a lack or a\nnot-Being that is located firmly in my own self (where ‘taking\nresponsibility for’ means recognizing that not-Being is one of\nmy essential structures); and I experience thrownness as\nanxiety, a mode of disposedness that, as we have seen, leaves me\nestranged from the familiar field of intelligibility determined by the\n‘they’ and thereby discloses the possibility of my own\nnot-Being. So, reticence, guilt and anxiety all have the effect of\nextracting Dasein from the ontological clutches of the\n‘they’. That is why the unitary structure of\nreticence-guilt-anxiety characterizes the Being of authentic\nDasein. \n\nSo now what of resoluteness? ‘Resoluteness’ is perhaps\nbest understood as simply a new term for reticence-guilt-anxiety. But\nwhy do we need a new term? There are two possible reasons for thinking\nthat the relabelling exercise here adds value. Each of these indicates\na connection between authenticity and freedom. Each corresponds to an\nauthentic realization of one of two possible understandings of what\nHeidegger means by (human) existence (see above). The first take on\nresoluteness is emphasized by, for example, Gelven (1989), Mulhall\n(2005) and Polt (1999). In ordinary parlance, to be resolved is to\ncommit oneself to some project and thus, in a sense, to take ownership\nof one's life. By succumbing to, but without making any real\ncommitment to, the patterns laid down by the ‘they’ (i.e.,\nby uncritically ‘doing what one does’), inauthentic Dasein\navoids owning its own life. Authentic Being (understood as\nresoluteness) is, then, a freedom from the ‘they’—not, of course, in any sense that involves extracting oneself from\none's socio-cultural embeddedness (after all, Being-with is part\nof Dasein's existential constitution), but rather in a sense that\ninvolves individual commitment to (and thus individual ownership of)\none of the possible ways to be that one's socio-cultural\nembeddedness makes available (more on this below). Seen like this,\nresoluteness correlates with the idea that Dasein's existence is\nconstituted by a series of events in which possible ways to be are\nchosen. \n\nAt this point we would do well to hesitate. The emphasis on notions\nsuch as choice and commitment makes it all too easy to think that\nresoluteness essentially involves some sort of conscious\ndecision-making. For this reason, Vallega-Neu (2003, 15) reminds us\nthat resoluteness is not a “choice made by a human subject”\nbut rather an “occurrence that determines Dasein”. This\noccurrence discloses Dasein's essential finitude. It is here that\nit is profitable to think in terms of anticipatory\nresoluteness. Heidegger's claim is that resoluteness and\nanticipation are internally related, such that they ultimately emerge\ntogether as the unitary phenomenon of anticipatory resoluteness. Thus,\nhe argues, Being-guilty (the projective aspect of resoluteness)\ninvolves Dasein wanting to be open to the call of conscience for as\nlong as Dasein exists, which requires an awareness of the possibility\nof death. Since resoluteness is an authentic mode of Being, this\nawareness of the possibility of death must also be authentic. But the\nauthentic awareness of the possibility of death just is anticipation\n(see above). Thus “only as anticipating does resoluteness become\na primordial Being towards Dasein's ownmost\npotentiality-for-Being” (Being and Time 62: 354). Via\nthe internal connection with anticipation, then, the notion of\nresoluteness allows Heidegger to rethink the path to Dasein's\nessential finitude, a finitude that is hidden in fallen-ness, but\nwhich, as we have seen, is the condition of possibility for the\ntaking-as structure that is a constitutive aspect of Dasein. Seen this\nway, resoluteness correlates more neatly with the idea that human\nexistence is essentially a standing out in an openness to, and in an\nopening of, Being. \n\nIn a further hermeneutic spiral, Heidegger concludes that\ntemporality is the a priori transcendental condition for there to be\ncare (sense-making, intelligibility, taking-as, Dasein's own\ndistinctive mode of Being). Moreover, it is Dasein's openness to\ntime that ultimately allows Dasein's potential authenticity to be\nactualized: in authenticity, the constraints and possibilities\ndetermined by Dasein's cultural-historical past are grasped by\nDasein in the present so that it may project itself into the future in\na fully authentic manner, i.e., in a manner which is truest to the\nmine-self. \n\nThe ontological emphasis that\nHeidegger places on temporality might usefully be seen as an echo and\ndevelopment of Kant's claim that embeddedness in time is a\nprecondition for things to appear to us the way they do. (According to Kant, embeddedness in time is co-determinative of our\nexperience, along with embeddedness in space. See above for\nHeidegger's problematic analysis of the relationship between\nspatiality and temporality.) With the Kantian roots of\nHeidegger's treatment of time acknowledged, it must be registered\nimmediately that, in Heidegger's hands, the notion of temporality\nreceives a distinctive twist. Heidegger is concerned not with\nclock-time (an infinite series of self-contained nows laid out in an\nordering of past, present and future) or with time as some sort of\nrelativistic phenomenon that would satisfy the physicist. Time thought\nof in either of these ways is a present-at-hand phenomenon, and that\nmeans that it cannot characterize the temporality that is an internal\nfeature of Dasein's existential constitution, the existential\ntemporality that structures intelligibility (taking-as). As he puts it\nin his History of the Concept of Time (a 1925 lecture course):\n“Not ‘time is’, but ‘Dasein qua time\ntemporalizes its Being’ ” (319). To make sense of this\ntemporalizing, Heidegger introduces the technical term\necstases. Ecstases are phenomena that stand out from an\nunderlying unity. (He later reinterprets ecstases as horizons,\nin the sense of what limits, surrounds or encloses, and in so doing\ndiscloses or makes available.) According to Heidegger, temporality is a\nunity against which past, present and future stand out as ecstases\nwhile remaining essentially interlocked. The importance of this idea is\nthat it frees the phenomenologist from thinking of past, present and\nfuture as sequentially ordered groupings of distinct events. Thus: \nTemporalizing does not signify that ecstases come in a\n‘succession’. The future is not later than having been, and\nhaving-been is not earlier than the Present. Temporality temporalizes\nitself as a future which makes present in a process of having\nbeen. (Being and Time 68: 401)  \nWhat does this mean and\nwhy should we find it compelling? Perhaps the easiest way to grasp\nHeidegger's insight here is to follow him in explicitly\nreinterpreting the different elements of the structure of care in terms\nof the three phenomenologically intertwined dimensions of temporality.\n \n\nDasein's existence is characterized phenomenologically by\nthrown projection plus fallenness/discourse. Heidegger argues that for\neach of these phenomena, one particular dimension of temporality is\nprimary. Thus projection is disclosed principally as the manner in\nwhich Dasein orients itself towards its future. Anticipation, as\nauthentic projection, therefore becomes the predominantly futural\naspect of (what we can now call) authentic temporalizing, whereas\nexpectation, as inauthentic projection, occupies the same role for\ninauthentic temporalizing. However, since temporality is at root a\nunitary structure, thrownness, projection, falling and discourse must\neach have a multi-faceted temporality. Anticipation, for example,\nrequires that Dasein acknowledge the unavoidable way in which its past\nis constitutive of who it is, precisely because anticipation demands of\nDasein that it project itself resolutely onto (i.e., come to make its\nown) one of the various options established by its cultural-historical\nembeddedness. And anticipation has a present-related aspect too: in a\nprocess that Heidegger calls a moment of vision, Dasein, in\nanticipating its own death, pulls away from they-self-dominated\ndistractions of the present. \n\nStructurally similar analyses are given for the other elements of\nthe care structure. Here is not the place to pursue the details but, at\nthe most general level, thrownness is identified predominantly,\nalthough not exclusively, as the manner in which Dasein collects up its\npast (finding itself in relation to the pre-structured field of\nintelligibility into which it has been enculturated), while fallen-ness\nand discourse are identified predominantly, although not exclusively,\nas present-oriented (e.g., in the case of fallen-ness, through\ncuriosity as a search for novelty in which Dasein is locked into the\ndistractions of the present and devalues the past and the projective\nfuture). A final feature of Heidegger's intricate analysis\nconcerns the way in which authentic and inauthentic temporalizing are\nunderstood as prioritizing different dimensions of temporality.\nHeidegger argues that because future-directed anticipation is\nintertwined with projection onto death as a possibility (thereby\nenabling the disclosure of Dasein's all-important finitude), the\n“primary phenomenon of primordial and authentic temporality is\nthe future” (Being and Time 65: 378), whereas\ninauthentic temporalizing (through structures such as\n‘they’-determined curiosity) prioritizes the\npresent. \nWhat the foregoing summary of Heidegger's account of\ntemporality makes clear is that each event of intelligibility that\nmakes up a ‘moment’ in Dasein's existence must be\nunpacked using all three temporal ecstases. Each such event is\nconstituted by thrownness (past), projection (future) and\nfalling/discourse (present). In a sense, then, each such event\ntranscends (goes beyond) itself as a momentary episode of Being by, in\nthe relevant sense, co-realizing a past and a future along with a\npresent. This explains why “the future is not later than having\nbeen, and having-been is not earlier than the Present”. In the\nsense that matters, then, Dasein is always a combination of\nthe futural, the historical and the present. And since futurality,\nhistoricality and presence, understood in terms of projection,\nthrownness and fallenness/discourse, form the structural dimensions of\neach event of intelligibility, it is Dasein's essential\ntemporality (or temporalizing) that provides the a priori\ntranscendental condition for there to be care (the sense-making that\nconstitutes Dasein's own distinctive mode of Being). \n\n(Some worries about Heidegger's analysis of time will be\nexplored below. For a view which is influenced by, and contains an\noriginal interpretation of, Heidegger on time, see Stiegler's\n1996/2003 analysis according to which human temporality is constituted\nby technology, including alphabetical writing, as a form of\nmemory.) \n\nIn the final major development of his analysis of temporality,\nHeidegger identifies a phenomenon that he calls Dasein's\nhistoricality, understood as the a priori condition on the\nbasis of which past events and things may have significance for us. The\nanalysis begins with an observation that Being-towards-death is only\none aspect of Dasein's finitude. [Death] is only the ‘end’ of Dasein; and, taken\nformally, it is just one of the ends by which Dasein's totality\nis closed round. The other ‘end’, however, is the\n‘beginning’, the ‘birth’. Only that entity\nwhich is ‘between’ birth and death presents the whole which\nwe have been seeking… Dasein has [so far] been our theme only in\nthe way in which it exists ‘facing forward’, as it were,\nleaving ‘behind’ all that has been. Not only has\nBeing-towards-the-beginning remained unnoticed; but so too, and above\nall, has the way in which Dasein stretches along between birth and\ndeath. (Being and Time 72: 425). \n\nHere Dasein's beginning (its ‘birth’) is to be interpreted\nnot as a biological event, but as a moment of enculturation, following\nwhich the a priori structure underlying intelligibility (thrown\nprojection plus falling/discourse) applies.  Dasein's beginning is\nthus a moment at which a biological human being has become embedded\nwithin a pre-existing world, a culturally determined field of\nintelligibility into which it is thrown and onto which it projects\nitself. Such worlds are now to be reinterpreted historically as\nDasein's heritage. Echoing the way in which past, present and\nfuture were disclosed as intertwined in the analysis of temporality,\nDasein's historicality has the effect of bringing the past (its\nheritage) alive in the present as a set of opportunities for future\naction. In the original German, Heidegger calls this\nphenomenon Wiederholung, which Macquarrie and Robinson\ntranslate as repetition. Although this is an accurate\ntranslation of the German term, there is a way of hearing the word\n‘repetition’ that is misleading with regard to Heidegger's\nusage. The idea here is not that I can do nothing other than repeat\nthe actions of my cultural ancestors, but rather that, in authentic\nmode, I may appropriate those past actions (own them, make them mine)\nas a set of general models or heroic templates onto which I may\ncreatively project myself. Thus, retrieving may be a more\nappropriate translation. This notion of retrieving characterizes the\n“specific movement in which Dasein is stretched along and\nstretches itself along”, what Heidegger now calls Dasein's\nhistorizing. Historizing is an a priori structure of\nDasein's Being as care that constitutes a stretching along\nbetween Dasein's birth as the entity that takes-as and death as\nits end, between enculturation and finitude. “Factical Dasein\nexists as born; and, as born, it is already dying, in the sense of\nBeing-towards-death… birth and death are ‘connected’\nin a manner characteristic of Dasein. As care, Dasein is the\n‘between’ ”(Being and Time 73: 426–7). It is debatable whether the idea of creative appropriation does\nenough to allay the suspicion that the concept of heritage introduces a\nthreat to our individual freedom (in an ordinary sense of freedom) by\nway of some sort of social determinism. For example, since\nhistoricality is an aspect of Dasein's existential constitution,\nit is arguable that Heidegger effectively rules out the possibility\nthat I might reinvent myself in an entirely original way. Moreover,\nPolt (1999) draws our attention to a stinging passage from earlier in\nBeing and Time which might be taken to suggest that any\nattempt to take on board elements of cultures other than one's\nown should be judged an inauthentic practice indicative of fallen-ness.\nThus:  \nthe opinion may now arise that understanding the most\nalien cultures and ‘synthesizing’ them with one's own\nmay lead to Dasein's becoming for the first time thoroughly and\ngenuinely enlightened about itself. Versatile curiosity and restlessly\n‘knowing it all’ masquerade as a universal understanding of\nDasein. (Being and Time 38: 178) \n This sets the stage\nfor Heidegger's own final elucidation of human freedom. According\nto Heidegger, I am genuinely free precisely when I recognize that I am\na finite being with a heritage and when I achieve an authentic\nrelationship with that heritage through the creative appropriation of\nit. As he explains:  \nOnce one has grasped the finitude of one's existence, it\nsnatches one back from the endless multiplicity of possibilities which\noffer themselves as closest to one—those of comfortableness,\nshirking and taking things lightly—and brings Dasein to the\nsimplicity of its fate. This is how we designate Dasein's\nprimordial historizing, which lies in authentic resoluteness and in\nwhich Dasein hands itself down to itself, free for death, in a\npossibility which it has inherited and yet has chosen.\n(Being and Time 74: 435) \n\nThis phenomenon, a final reinterpretation of the notion of\nresoluteness, is what Heidegger calls primordial historizing\nor fate. And crucially, historizing is not merely a structure\nthat is partly constitutive of individual authentic Dasein.\nHeidegger also points out the shared primordial historizing of a\ncommunity, what he calls its destiny. \n\nWhen the contemporary reader of Being and Time encounters\nthe concepts of heritage, fate and destiny, and places them not only in\nthe context of the political climate of mid-to-late 1920s Germany, but\nalso alongside Heidegger's later membership of the Nazi party, it\nis hard not to hear dark undertones of cultural chauvinism and racial\nprejudice. This worry becomes acute when one considers the way in which\nthese concepts figure in passages such as the following, from the\ninaugural rectoral address that Heidegger gave at Freiburg University\nin 1933. \nThe third bond [knowledge service, in addition to labour service\nand military service] is the one that binds the [German] students to\nthe spiritual mission of the German Volk. This Volk is playing an\nactive role in shaping its own fate by placing its history into the\nopenness of the overpowering might of all the world-shaping forces of\nhuman existence and by struggling anew to secure its spiritual\nworld… The three bonds—through the Volk to the\ndestiny of the state in its spiritual mission—are equally\noriginal aspects of the German essence. (The Self-Assertion of\nthe German University, 35–6) \n\nThe issue of Heidegger's later relationship with Nazi politics\nand ideology will be discussed briefly below. For the moment, however,\nit is worth saying that the temptation to offer extreme social\ndeterminist or Nazi reconstructions of Being and Time is far\nfrom irresistible. It is at least arguable that Heidegger's claim\nat this point in his work is ‘merely’ that it is only on\nthe basis of fate—an honest and explicit retrieval of my own\nculture which allows me to recognize and accept the manifold ways in\nwhich I am shaped by that culture—that I can open up a genuine\npath to personal reconstruction or to the possibly enriching structures\nthat other cultures have to offer. And that does not sound nearly so\npernicious.  \n\nOne might think that an unpalatable relativism is entailed by any\nview which emphasizes that understanding is never preconception-free.\nBut that would be too quick. Of course, if authentic Dasein were\nindividualized in the sense of being a self-sufficient Cartesian\nsubject, then perhaps an extreme form of subjectivist relativism would\nindeed beckon. Fortunately, however, authentic Dasein isn't a\nCartesian subject, in part because it has a transformed and not a\nsevered relationship with the ‘they’. This reconnects us\nwith our earlier remark that the philosophical framework advocated\nwithin Being and Time appears to mandate a kind of\ncultural relativism. This seems right, but it is important to\ntry to understand precisely what sort of cultural relativism is on\noffer. Here is one interpretation. \n\nAlthough worlds (networks of involvements, what Heidegger sometimes\ncalls Reality) are culturally relative phenomena, Heidegger\noccasionally seems to suggest that nature, as it is in itself,\nis not. Thus, on the one hand, nature may be discovered as\nready-to-hand equipment: the “wood is a forest of timber, the\nmountain is a quarry of rock; the river is water-power, the wind is\nwind ‘in the sails’ ” (Being and Time 15:\n100). Under these circumstances, nature is revealed in certain\nculturally specific forms determined by our socially conditioned\npatterns of skilled practical activity. On the other hand, when nature\nis discovered as present-at-hand, by say science, its intelligibility\nhas an essentially cross-cultural character. Indeed, Heidegger often\nseems to hold the largely commonsense view that there are\nculture-independent causal properties of nature which explain why it is\nthat you can make missiles out of rocks or branches, but not out of air\nor water. Science can tell us both what those causal properties are,\nand how the underlying causal processes work. Such properties and\nprocesses are what Heidegger calls the Real, and he comments:\n“[the] fact that Reality [intelligibility] is ontologically\ngrounded in the Being of Dasein does not signify that only when Dasein\nexists and as long as Dasein exists can the Real [e.g., nature as\nrevealed by science] be as that which in itself it is”\n(Being and Time, 43: 255).  \n\nIf the picture just sketched is a productive way to understand\nHeidegger, then, perhaps surprisingly, his position might best be\nthought of as a mild kind of scientific realism. For, on this\ninterpretation, one of Dasein's cultural practices, the practice\nof science, has the special quality of revealing natural entities as\nthey are in themselves, that is, independently of Dasein's\nculturally conditioned uses and articulations of them. Crucially,\nhowever, this sort of scientific realism maintains ample conceptual\nroom for Sheehan's well-observed point that, for Heidegger, at\nevery stage of his thinking, “there is no ‘is’ to\nthings without a taking-as… no sense that is independent of\nhuman being… Before homo sapiens evolved, there was no\n‘being’ on earth… because ‘being’ for\nHeidegger does not mean ‘in existence’ ” (Sheehan\n2001). Indeed, Being concerns sense-making (intelligibility), and the\ndifferent ways in which entities make sense to us, including as\npresent-at-hand, are dependent on the fact that we are Dasein,\ncreatures with a particular mode of Being. So while natural entities do\nnot require the existence of Dasein in order just to occur (in an\nordinary, straightforward sense of ‘occur’), they do\nrequire Dasein in order to be intelligible at all, including\nas entities that just occur. Understood properly, then, the\nfollowing two claims that Heidegger makes are entirely consistent with\neach other. First: “Being (not entities) is dependent upon the\nunderstanding of Being; that is to say, Reality (not the Real) is\ndependent upon care”. Secondly: “[O]nly as long as Dasein\nis (that is, only as long as an understanding of Being is ontically\npossible), ‘is there’ Being. When Dasein does not exist,\n‘independence’ ‘is’ not either, nor\n‘is’ the ‘in-itself’ ”. (Both quotations\nfrom Being and Time, 43: 255.) \n\nHow does all this relate to Heidegger's account of truth?\nAnswering this question adds a new dimension to the pivotal phenomenon\nof revealing. Heidegger points out that the philosophical tradition\nstandardly conceives of truth as attaching to propositions, and as\ninvolving some sort of correspondence between propositions and states\nof affairs. But whereas for the tradition (as Heidegger characterizes\nit), propositional truth as correspondence exhausts the phenomenon of\ntruth, for Heidegger, it is merely the particular manifestation of\ntruth that is operative in those domains, such as science, that concern\nthemselves with the Real. According to Heidegger, propositional truth\nas correspondence is made possible by a more fundamental phenomenon\nthat he dubs ‘original truth’. Heidegger's key\nthought here is that before (in a conceptual sense of\n‘before’) there can be any question of correspondence\nbetween propositions and states of affairs, there needs to be in place\na field of intelligibility (Reality, a world), a sense-making structure\nwithin which entities may be found. Unconcealing is the\nDasein-involving process that establishes this prior field of\nintelligibility. This is the domain of original truth—what we\nmight call truth as revealing or truth as\nunconcealing. Original truth cannot be reduced to propositional\ntruth as correspondence, because the former is an a priori,\ntranscendental condition for the latter. Of course, since Dasein is the\nsource of intelligibility, truth as unconcealing is possible only\nbecause there is Dasein, which means that without Dasein there would be\nno truth—including propositional truth as correspondence. But\nit is reasonable to hear this seemingly relativistic consequence as a\nfurther modulation of the point (see above) that entities require\nDasein in order to be intelligible at all, including, now, as entities\nthat are capable of entering into states of affairs that may correspond\nto propositions. \n\nHeidegger's analysis of truth also countenances a third\nmanifestation of the phenomenon, one that is perhaps best characterized\nas being located between original truth and propositional\ntruth. This intermediate phenomenon is what might be called\nHeidegger's instrumental notion of truth (Dahlstrom\n2001, Overgaard 2002). As we saw earlier, for Heidegger, the\nreferential structure of significance may be articulated not only by\nwords but by skilled practical activity (e.g., hammering) in which items\nof equipment are used in culturally appropriate ways. By\nHeidegger's lights, such equipmental activity counts as a\nmanifestation of unconcealing and thus as the realization of a species\nof truth. This fact further threatens the idea that truth attaches only\nto propositions, although some uses of language may themselves be\nanalysed as realizing the instrumental form of truth (e.g., when I\nexclaim that ‘this hammer is too heavy for the job’, rather\nthan assert that it has the objective property of weighing 2.5 kilos;\nOvergaard 2002, 77; cf. Being and Time 33:199–200). \n\nIt is at this point that an ongoing dispute in Heidegger scholarship\ncomes to the fore. It has been argued (e.g., Dahlstrom 2001, Overgaard\n2002) that a number of prominent readings of Heidegger (e.g., Okrent\n1988, Dreyfus 1991) place such heavy philosophical emphasis on Dasein\nas a site of skilled practical activity that they end up simply\nidentifying Dasein's understanding of Being with skilled\npractical activity. Because of this shared tendency, such readings are\noften grouped together as advocating a pragmatist\ninterpretation of Heidegger. According to its critics, the inadequacy\nof the pragmatist interpretation is exposed once it is applied to\nHeidegger's account of truth. For although the pragmatist\ninterpretation correctly recognizes that, for Heidegger, propositional\ncorrespondence is not the most fundamental phenomenon of truth, it\ntakes the fundamental variety to be exhausted by Dasein's\nsense-making skilled practical activity. But (the critic points out)\nthis is to ignore the fact that even though instrumental truth is more\nbasic than traditional propositional truth, nevertheless it too depends\non a prior field of significance (one that determines the correct and\nincorrect uses of equipment) and thus on the phenomenon of original\ntruth. Put another way, the pragmatist interpretation falls short\nbecause it fails to distinguish original truth from instrumental truth.\nIt is worth commenting here that not every so-called pragmatist reading\nis on a par with respect to this issue. For example, Dreyfus (2008)\nseparates out (what he calls) background coping\n(Dasein's familiarity with, and knowledge of how to navigate the meaningful structures of,\nits world) from (what he calls) skilled or absorbed\ncoping (Dasein's skilled practical activity), and argues that,\nfor Heidegger, the former is ontologically more basic than the latter.\nIf original truth is manifested in background coping, and instrumental\ntruth in skilled coping, this disrupts the thought that the two notions\nof truth are being run together (for discussion, see Overgaard 2002\n85–6, note 17). \n\nHow should one respond to Heidegger's analysis of truth?\nOne objection is that original truth ultimately fails to qualify as a\nform of truth at all. As Tugendhat (1967) observes, it is a plausible\ncondition on the acceptability of any proposed account of truth that it\naccommodate a distinction between what is asserted or intended and how\nthings are in themselves. It is clear that propositional truth as\ncorrespondence satisfies this condition, and notice that (if we squint\na little) so too does instrumental truth, since despite my intentions,\nI can fail, in my actions, to use the hammer in ways that successfully\narticulate its place in the relevant equipmental network. However, as\nTugendhat argues, it is genuinely hard to see how original truth as\nunconcealing could possibly support a distinction between what is\nasserted or intended and how things are in themselves. After all,\nunconcealing is, in part, the process through which entities are made\nintelligible to Dasein in such a way that the distinction in question\ncan apply. Thus, Tugendhat concludes, although unconcealing may be a\ngenuine phenomenon that constitutes a transcendental condition for\nthere to be truth, it is not itself a species of truth. (For\ndiscussions of Tugendhat's critique, see Dahlstrom 2001,\nOvergaard 2002.) \n\nWhether or not unconcealing ought to count as a species of truth,\nit is arguable that the place which it (along with its partner\nstructure, Reality) occupies in the Heideggerian framework must\nultimately threaten even the mild kind of scientific realism that we\nhave been attributing, somewhat tentatively, to Heidegger. The tension\ncomes into view just at the point where unconcealing is reinterpreted\nin terms of Dasein's essential historicality. Because\nintelligibility, and thus unconcealing, has an essentially historical\ncharacter, it is difficult to resist the thought that the propositional\nand instrumental truths generated out of some specific field of\nintelligibility will be relativistically tied to a particular culture\nin a particular time period. Moreover, at one point, Heidegger suggests\nthat even truth as revealed by science is itself subject to this kind\nof relativistic constraint. Thus he says that “every factical\nscience is always manifestly in the grip of historizing”\n(Being and Time 76: 444). The implication is that, for\nHeidegger, one cannot straightforwardly subject the truth of one age to\nthe standards of another, which means, for example, that contemporary\nchemistry and alchemical chemistry might both be true (cf. Dreyfus\n1990, 261–2). But even if this more radical position is ultimately\nHeidegger's, there remains space here for some form of realism.\nGiven the transcendental relation that, according to Heidegger, obtains\nbetween fields of intelligibility and science, the view on offer might\nstill support a historically conditioned form of Kantian empirical\nrealism with respect to science. Nevertheless it must, it seems, reject\nthe full-on scientific realist commitment to the idea that the history\nof science is regulated by progress towards some final and unassailable\nset of scientifically established truths about nature, by a journey\ntowards, as it were, God's science (Haugeland 2007). The realist waters in which our preliminary interpretation has been\nswimming are muddied even further by another aspect of Dasein's\nessential historicality. Officially, it is seemingly not supposed to be\na consequence of that historicality that we cannot discover universal\nfeatures of ourselves. The evidence for this is that there are many\nconclusions reached in Being and Time that putatively apply to\nall Dasein, for example that Dasein's everyday experience is\ncharacterized by the structural domains of readiness-to-hand,\nun-readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand (for additional evidence, see\nPolt 1999 92–4). Moreover, Heidegger isn't saying that any route\nto understanding is as good as any other. For example, he prioritizes\nauthenticity as the road to an answer to the question of the meaning of\nBeing. Thus: the idea of existence, which guides us as that\nwhich we see in advance, has been made definite [transformed from\npre-ontological to ontological, from implicit and vague to explicitly\narticulated] by the clarification of our ownmost\npotentiality-for-Being. (Being and Time 63: 358) \n Still,\nif this priority claim and the features shared by all Dasein really are\nsupposed to be ahistorical, universal conditions (applicable everywhere\nthroughout history), we are seemingly owed an account of just how such\nconditions are even possible, given Dasein's essential\nhistoricality. \n\nFinally, one might wonder whether the ‘realist\nHeidegger’ can live with the account of temporality given in\nBeing and Time. If temporality is the a priori condition for\nus to encounter entities as equipment, and if, in the relevant sense,\nthe unfolding of time coincides with the unfolding of Dasein (Dasein,\nas temporality, temporalizes; see above), then equipmental entities\nwill be intelligible to us only in (what we might call) Dasein-time,\nthe time that we ourselves are. Now, we have seen previously that\nnature is often encountered as equipment, which means that natural\nequipment will be intelligible to us only in Dasein-time. But what\nabout nature in a non-equipmental form—nature (as one might\nsurely be tempted to say) as it is in itself? One might try to argue\nthat those encounters with nature that reveal nature as it is in itself\nare precisely those encounters that reveal nature as present-at-hand,\nand that to reveal nature as present-at-hand is, in part, to reveal\nnature within present-at-hand time (e.g., clock time), a time which is,\nin the relevant sense, independent of Dasein. Unfortunately\nthere's a snag with this story (and thus for the attempt to see\nHeidegger as a realist). Heidegger claims that presence-at-hand (as\nrevealed by theoretical reflection) is subject to the same\nDasein-dependent temporality as readiness-to-hand:  \n…if\nDasein's Being is completely grounded in temporality, then\ntemporality must make possible Being-in-the-world and therewith\nDasein's transcendence; this transcendence in turn provides the\nsupport for concernful Being alongside entities within-the-world,\nwhether this Being is theoretical or practical.\n(Being and Time 69: 415, my emphasis) \n But now if theoretical\ninvestigations reveal nature in present-at-hand time, and if in the\nswitching over from the practical use of equipment to the theoretical\ninvestigation of objects, time remains the same Dasein-time, then\npresent-at-hand time is Dasein-dependent too. Given this, it seems that\nthe only way we can give any sense to the idea of nature as it is in\nitself is to conceive of such nature as being outside of time.\nInterestingly, in the History of the Concept of Time (a text\nbased on Heidegger's notes for a 1925 lecture course and often\nthought of as a draft of Being and Time), Heidegger seems to\nembrace this very option, arguing that nature is within time only when\nit is encountered in Dasein's world, and concluding that nature\nas it is in itself is entirely atemporal. It is worth noting the\nsomewhat Kantian implication of this conclusion: if all understanding\nis grounded in temporality, then the atemporality of nature as it is in\nitself would mean that, for Heidegger, we cannot understand natural\nthings as they really are in themselves (cf. Dostal 1993). \n\nAfter Being and Time there is a shift in Heidegger's\nthinking that he himself christened ‘the turn’ (die\nKehre). In a 1947 piece, in which Heidegger distances his views\nfrom Sartre's existentialism, he links the turn to his own\nfailure to produce the missing divisions of Being and\nTime.  \nThe adequate execution and completion of this other thinking that\nabandons subjectivity is surely made more difficult by the fact that in\nthe publication of Being and Time the third division of the\nfirst part, “Time and Being,” was held back… Here\neverything is reversed. The division in question was held back because\neverything failed in the adequate saying of this turning and did not\nsucceed with the help of the language of metaphysics… This\nturning is not a change of standpoint from Being and Time, but\nin it the thinking that was sought first arrives at the location of\nthat dimension out of which Being and Time is experienced,\nthat is to say, experienced from the fundamental experience of the\noblivion of Being. (Letter on Humanism, pp. 231–2) \n\nNotice that while, in the turning, “everything is\nreversed”, nevertheless it is “not a change of standpoint\nfrom Being and Time”, so what we should expect from the\nlater philosophy is a pattern of significant discontinuities with\nBeing and Time, interpretable from within a basic project and\na set of concerns familiar from that earlier text. The quotation from\nthe Letter on Humanism provides some clues about what to look\nfor. Clearly we need to understand what is meant by the abandonment of\nsubjectivity, what kind of barrier is erected by the language of\nmetaphysics, and what is involved in the oblivion of Being. The second\nand third of these issues will be clarified later. The first bears\nimmediate comment. \n\nAt root Heidegger's later philosophy shares the deep concerns\nof Being and Time, in that it is driven by the same\npreoccupation with Being and our relationship with it that propelled\nthe earlier work. In a fundamental sense, then, the question of Being\nremains the question. However, Being and Time\naddresses the question of Being via an investigation of Dasein, the\nkind of being whose Being is an issue for it. As we have seen, this\ninvestigation takes the form of a transcendental hermeneutic\nphenomenology that begins with ordinary human experience. It is\narguable that, in at least one important sense, it is this\nphilosophical methodology that the later Heidegger is rejecting when he\ntalks of his abandonment of subjectivity. Of course, as conceptualized\nin Being and Time, Dasein is not a Cartesian subject, so the\nabandonment of subjectivity is not as simple as a shift of attention\naway from Dasein and towards some other route to Being. Nevertheless\nthe later Heidegger does seem to think that his earlier focus on Dasein\nbears the stain of a subjectivity that ultimately blocks the path to an\nunderstanding of Being. This is not to say that the later thinking\nturns away altogether from the project of transcendental hermeneutic\nphenomenology. The project of illuminating the a priori conditions on\nthe basis of which entities show up as intelligible to us is still at\nthe heart of things. What the later thinking involves is a\nreorientation of the basic project so that, as we shall see, the point\nof departure is no longer a detailed description of ordinary human\nexperience. (For an analysis of ‘the turn’ that identifies\na number of different senses of the term at work in Heidegger's\nthinking, and which in some ways departs from the brief treatment given\nhere, see Sheehan 2010.)\n \n\nA further difficulty in getting to grips with Heidegger's\nlater philosophy is that, unlike the early thought, which is heavily\ncentred on a single text, the later thought is distributed over a large\nnumber and range of works, including books, lecture courses, occasional\naddresses, and presentations given to non-academic audiences. So one\nneeds a navigational strategy. The strategy adopted here will be to\nview the later philosophy through the lens of Heidegger's strange\nand perplexing study from the 1930s called Contributions to\nPhilosophy (From Enowning), (Beitrage zur Philosophie (Vom\nEreignis)), henceforth referred to as the Contributions.\n(For a book-length introduction to the Contributions, see\nVallega-Neu 2003. For a useful collection of papers, see Scott et al.\n2001.) The key themes that shape the later philosophy will be\nidentified in the Contributions, but those themes will be\nexplored in a way that draws on, and make connections with, a selection\nof other works. From this partial expedition, the general pattern of\nHeidegger's post-turn thinking, although not every aspect of it,\nwill emerge. \n\nThe Contributions was written between 1936 and 1938.\nIntriguingly, Heidegger asked for the work not to appear in print until\nafter the publication of all his lecture courses, and although his\ndemand wasn't quite heeded by the editors of his collected works,\nthe Contributions was not published in German until 1989 and\nnot in English until 1999. To court a perhaps overly dramatic telling\nof Heideggerian history, if one puts a lot of weight on\nHeidegger's view of when the Contributions should have\nbeen published, one might conceivably think of those later writings\nthat, in terms of when they were produced, followed the\nContributions as something like the training material needed\nto understand the earlier work (see e.g., Polt 1999 140). In any case,\nduring his lifetime, Heidegger showed the Contributions to no\nmore than a few close colleagues. The excitement with which the\neventual publication of the text was greeted by Heidegger's\nreaders was partly down to the fact that one of the chosen few granted\na sneak preview was the influential interpreter of Heidegger, Otto\nPöggeler, who then proceeded to give it some rather extraordinary\nadvance publicity, describing it as the work in which Heidegger's\ngenuine and complete thinking is captured (see e.g., Pöggeler\n1963/1987). \n\nWhether or not the hype surrounding the Contributions was\njustified remains a debated question among Heidegger scholars (see e.g.,\nSheehan 2001, Thomson 2003). What is clear, however, is that reading\nthe work is occasionally a bewildering experience. Rather than a series\nof systematic hermeneutic spirals in the manner of Being and\nTime, the Contributions is organised as something like a\nmusical fugue, that is, as a suite of overlapping developments of a\nsingle main theme (Schoenbohm 2001; Thomson 2003). And while the\nstructure of the Contributions is challenging enough, the\nlanguage in which it is written can appear to be wilfully obscurantist.\nPolt (1999, 140) comments that “the most important sections of\nthe text can appear to be written in pure Heideggerese… [as\nHeidegger] exploits the sounds and senses of German in order to create\nan idiosyncratic symphony of meanings”. Less charitably, Sheehan\n(2001) describes it as “a needlessly difficult text, obsessively\nrepetitious, badly in need of an editor”, while Schurmann (1992,\n313, quoted by Thomson 2003, 57) complains that “at times one may\nthink one is reading a piece of Heideggerian plagiarism, so encumbered\nis it with ellipses and assertoric monoliths”. Arguably, the\nstyle in which the Contributions is written is\n‘merely’ the most extreme example (perhaps, the purest\nexample) of a ‘poetic’ style that Heidegger adopts pretty\nmuch throughout the later philosophy. This stylistic aspect of the turn\nis an issue discussed below. For the moment, however, it is worth\nnoting that, in the stylistic transition achieved in the\nContributions, Heidegger's writing finally leaves\nbehind all vestiges of the idea that Being can be represented\naccurately using some pseudo-scientific philosophical language.\nThe goal, instead, is to respond appropriately to Being\nin language, to forge a pathway to another kind of thinking—Being-historical thinking (for discussion of this\nterm, see Vallega 2001, von Herrmann 2001, Vallega-Neu 2003, 28-9). In\nits attempt to achieve this, the Contributions may be viewed\nas setting the agenda for Heidegger's post-turn thought. So what\nare the central themes that appear in the Contributions and\nwhich then resonate throughout the later works? Four stand out: Being\nas appropriation (an idea which, as we shall see, is bound up with a\nreinterpretation of the notion of dwelling that, in terms of explicit\ntextual development, takes place largely outwith the text of the\nContributions itself); technology (or machination);\nsafeguarding (or sheltering); and the gods. Each of these themes will\nnow be explored. \n\nIn Being and Time, the most fundamental a priori\ntranscendental condition for there to be Dasein's distinctive\nmode of Being which is identified is temporality. In the later\nphilosophy, the ontological focus ultimately shifts to the claim that\nhuman Being consists most fundamentally in dwelling. This shift of\nattention emerges out of a subtle reformulation of the question of\nBeing itself, a reformulation performed in the Contributions.\nThe question now becomes not ‘What is the meaning of\nBeing?’ but rather ‘How does Being essentially\nunfold?’. This reformulation means (in a way that should become\nclearer in a moment) that we are now asking the question of Being not\nfrom the perspective of Dasein, but from the perspective of Being (see\nabove on abandoning subjectivity). But it also suggests that Being\nneeds to be understood as fundamentally a timebound, historical\nprocess. As Heidegger puts it: “A being is: Be-ing holds\nsway [unfolds]”. (Contributions 10: 22. Quotations from\nthe Contributions will be given in the form ‘section: page\nnumber’ where ‘page number’ refers to the Emad and\nMaly English translation. The hyphenated term ‘be-ing’ is\nadopted by Emad and Maly, in order to respect the fact that, in the\nContributions, Heidegger substitutes the archaic spelling\n‘Seyn’ for the contemporary ‘Sein’ as a way of\ndistancing himself further from the traditional language of\nmetaphysics. This translational convention, which has not become\nstandard practice in the secondary literature, will not be adopted\nhere, except in quotations from the Emad and Maly\ntranslation.) \n\nFurther aspects of the essential unfolding of Being are revealed by\nwhat is perhaps the key move in the Contributions—a\nrethinking of Being in terms of the notion of Ereignis, a term\ntranslated variously as ‘event’ (most closely reflecting\nits ordinary German usage), ‘appropriation’,\n‘appropriating event’, ‘event of appropriation’\nor ‘enowning’. (For an analysis which tracks\nHeidegger's use of the term Ereignis at various stages\nof his thought, see Vallega-Neu 2010). The history of Being is now\nconceived as a series of appropriating events in which the different\ndimensions of human sense-making—the religious, political,\nphilosophical (and so on) dimensions that define the culturally\nconditioned epochs of human history—are transformed. Each such\ntransformation is a revolution in human patterns of intelligibility, so\nwhat is appropriated in the event is Dasein and thus the human capacity\nfor taking-as (see e.g., Contributions 271: 343). Once\nappropriated in this way, Dasein operates according to a specific set\nof established sense-making practices and structures. In a Kuhnian\nregister, one might think of this as the normal sense-making that\nfollows a paradigm-shift. But now what is it that does the\nappropriating? Heidegger's answer to this question is Being. Thus\nHeidegger writes of the “En-ownment [appropriation] of Da-sein by\nbe-ing” (Contributions 141: 184) and of “man as\nowned by be-ing” (Contributions 141: 185). Indeed,\nthis appropriation of Dasein by Being is what enables Being to unfold:\n“Be-ing needs man in order to hold sway [unfold]”\n(Contributions 133: 177). The claim that Being appropriates\nDasein might seem to invite the adoption of an ethereal voice and a\nfar-off look in the eye, but any such temptation towards mysticism of\nthis kind really ought to be resisted. The mystical reading seems to\ndepend on a view according to which “be-ing holds sway ‘for\nitself’ ” and Dasein “takes up the relating to\nbe-ing”, such that Being is “something over-against”\nDasein (Contributions 135: 179). But Heidegger argues that\nthis relational view would be ‘misleading’. That said, to\nmake proper inroads into the mystical reading, we need to reacquaint\nourselves with the notion of dwelling. \n\nAs we have seen, the term ‘dwelling’ appears in\nBeing and Time, where it is used to capture the distinctive\nmanner in which Dasein is in the world. The term continues to\nplay this role in the later philosophy, but, in texts such as\nBuilding Dwelling, Thinking (1954), it is reinterpreted and\nmade philosophically central to our understanding of Being. This\nreinterpretation of, and the new emphasis on, dwelling is bound up with\nthe idea from the Contributions of Being as appropriation. To\nexplain: Where one dwells is where one is at home, where one\nhas a place. This sense of place is what grounds\nHeidegger's existential notion of spatiality, as developed in the\nlater philosophy (see Malpas 2006). In dwelling, then, Dasein is\nlocated within a set of sense-making practices and structures with\nwhich it is familiar. This way of unravelling the phenomenon of\ndwelling enables us to see more clearly—and more concretely—what is meant by the idea of Being as event/appropriation.\nBeing is an event in that it takes (appropriates)\nplace (where one is at home, one's sense-making\npractices and structures) (cf. Polt 1999 148). In other words, Being\nappropriates Dasein in that, in its unfolding, it essentially\nhappens in and to Dasein's patterns of sense-making.\nThis way of thinking about the process of appropriation does rather\nless to invite obscurantist mysticism.\n \n\nThe reinterpretation of dwelling in terms of Being as appropriation\nis ultimately intertwined with a closely related reinterpretation of\nwhat is meant by a world. One can see the latter development in a\npregnant passage from Heidegger's 1954 piece, Building\nDwelling Thinking. \n[H]uman being consists in dwelling and, indeed, dwelling in the\nsense of the stay of mortals on the earth. \n But ‘on the earth’ already means ‘under the\nsky.’ Both of these also mean ‘remaining before the\ndivinities’ and include a ‘belonging to men's being with\none another.’ By a primal oneness the four—earth and sky,\ndivinities and mortals—belong together in one. (351) \n\nSo, human beings dwell in that they stay (are at home) on the earth,\nunder the sky, before the divinities, and among the mortals (that is,\nwith one another as mortals). It is important for Heidegger that these\ndimensions of dwelling are conceived not as independent structures but\nas (to use a piece of terminology from Being and Time)\necstases—phenomena that stand out from an underlying\nunity. That underlying unity of earth, sky, divinities and mortals—the ‘simple oneness of the four’ as Heidegger puts\nit in Building Dwelling Thinking (351)—is what he\ncalls the fourfold. The fourfold is the transformed\nnotion of world that applies within the later work (see e.g., The\nThing; for an analysis of the fourfold that concentrates on its\nrole as a thinking of things, see Mitchell 2010). It is possible to\nglimpse the character of the world-as-fourfold by noting that whereas\nthe world as understood through Being and Time is a culturally\nconditioned structure distinct from nature, the world-as-fourfold\nappears to be an integrated combination of nature (earth and sky) and\nculture (divinities and mortals). (Two remarks: First, it may not be\nobvious why the divinities count as part of culture. This will be\nexplained in a moment. Secondly, the later Heidegger sometimes\ncontinues to employ the sense of world that he established in Being\nand Time, which is why it is useful to signal the new usage as the\ntransformed notion of world, or as the world-as-fourfold.) \n\nThere is something useful, as a preliminary move, about interpreting\nthe fourfold as a combination of nature and culture, but it is an idea\nthat must be handled with care. For one thing, if what is meant by\nnature is the material world and its phenomena as understood by natural\nscience, then Heidegger's account of the fourfold tells against\nany straightforward identification of earth and sky with nature. Why\nthis is becomes clear once one sees how Heidegger describes the earth\nand the sky in Building Dwelling Thinking. “Earth is the\nserving bearer, blossoming and fruiting, spreading out in rock and\nwater, rising up into plant and animal… The sky is the vaulting\npath of the sun, the course of the changing moon, the wandering glitter\nof the stars, the year's seasons and their changes, the light and\ndusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency\nof the weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether”\n(351). What Heidegger's language here indicates is that the\nearth-as-dwelt-on and the sky-as-dwelt-under are spaces for a mode of\nhabitation by human beings that one might call poetic rather\nthan scientific. So, the nature of dwelling is the nature of the poet.\nIn dwelling we inhabit the poetic (for discussion, see e.g., Young 2002,\n99–100). \n\nHow does this idea of dwelling as poetic habitation work for the\ncultural aspects of the fourfold—dwelling among the mortals and\nbefore the divinities? To dwell among the mortals is to be\n“capable of death as death” (Building Dwelling\nThinking 352). In the language of Being and Time, this\nwould be to enter into an authentic and thus non-evasive relationship\nwith death (see above). However, as we shall see in a moment, the later\nHeidegger has a different account of the nothing and thus of the\ninternal relation with the nothing that death involves. It is this\nreworking of the idea of the nothing that ultimately marks out a newly\nconceived non-evasive relationship with death as an aspect of dwelling,\nunderstood in terms of poetic habitation. The notion of dwelling before\nthe divinities also turns on the development of a theme established in\nBeing and Time, namely that intelligibility is itself cultural\nand historical in character. More specifically, according to Being\nand Time, the a priori transcendental conditions for\nintelligibility are to be interpreted in terms of the phenomenon of\nheritage, that is as culturally determined structures that form\npre-existing fields of intelligibility into which individual human\nbeings are thrown and onto which they project themselves. A key aspect\nof this idea is that there exist historically important individuals who\nconstitute heroic cultural templates onto which I may now creatively\nproject myself. In the later philosophy these heroic figures are reborn\npoetically as the divinities of the fourfold, as “the ones to\ncome” (Contributions 248–52: 277–81), and as the\n“beckoning messengers of the godhead” (Building\nDwelling Thinking 351). When Heidegger famously announces that\nonly a god can save us (Only a God can Save Us),\nor that “the last god is not the end but the other beginning of\nimmeasurable possibilities for our history”\n(Contributions 256: 289), he has in mind not a religious\nintervention in an ‘ordinary’ sense of the divine, but\nrather a transformational event in which a secularized sense of the\nsacred—a sensitivity to the fact that beings are\ngranted to us in the essential unfolding of Being—is\nrestored (more on this below). \n\nThe notion of dwelling as poetic habitation opens up a path to what\nHeidegger calls ‘the mystery’ (not to be confused with the\nkind of obscurantist mysticism discussed above). Even though the world\nalways opens up as meaningful in a particular way to any individual\nhuman being as a result of the specific heritage into which he or she\nhas been enculturated, there are of course a vast number of alternative\nfields of intelligibility ‘out there’ that would be\navailable to each of us, if only we could gain access to them\nby becoming simultaneously embedded in different heritages. But\nHeidegger's account of human existence means that any such\nparallel embedding is ruled out, so the plenitude of alternative fields\nof intelligibility must remain a mystery to us. In\nHeidegger's later philosophy this mysterious region of Being\nemerges as a structure that, although not illuminated poetically in\ndwelling as a particular world-as-fourfold, nevertheless constitutes an\nessential aspect of dwelling in that it is ontologically co-present\nwith any such world. Appropriation is necessarily a twofold event: as\nDasein is thrown into an intelligible world, vast regions of Being are\nplunged into darkness. But that darkness is a necessary condition for\nthere to be any intelligibility at all. As Heidegger puts it in The\nQuestion Concerning Technology (330), “[a]ll revealing\nbelongs within a harboring and a concealing. But that which frees\n[entities for intelligibility]—the mystery—is concealed\nand always concealing itself…. Freedom [sense-making, the\nrevealing of beings] is that which conceals in a way that opens to\nlight, in whose clearing shimmers the veil that hides the essential\noccurrence of all truth and lets the veil appear as what\nveils”. \n\nIt is worth pausing here to comment on the fact that, in his 1935\nessay The Origin of the Work of Art, Heidegger writes of a\nconflict between earth and world. This idea may seem to sit\nunhappily alongside the simple oneness of the four. The essay in\nquestion is notoriously difficult, but the notion of the mystery may\nhelp. Perhaps the pivotal thought is as follows: Natural materials (the\nearth), as used in artworks, enter into intelligibility by establishing\ncertain culturally codified meanings—a world in the sense of\nBeing and Time. Simultaneously, however, those natural\nmaterials suggest the existence of a vast range of other possible, but\nto us unintelligible, meanings, by virtue of the fact that they\ncould have been used to realize those alternative meanings.\nThe conflict, then, turns on the way in which, in the midst of a world,\nthe earth suggests the presence of the mystery. This is one way to hear\npassages such as the following: “The world, in resting upon the\nearth, strives to surmount it. As self-opening it cannot endure\nanything closed. The earth, however, as sheltering and concealing,\ntends always to draw the world into itself and keep it there”\n(Origin of the Work of Art 174). \n\nBecause the mystery is unintelligible, it is the nothing\n(no-thing). It is nonetheless a positive ontological\nphenomenon—a necessary feature of the essential unfolding of\nBeing. This vision of the nothing, as developed in Heidegger's\nWhat is Metaphysics?, his 1929 inaugural lecture as Professor\nof Philosophy at Freiburg, famously attracts the philosophical disdain\nof the logical positivist Carnap. Carnap judged Heidegger's\nlecture to turn on a series of unverifiable statements, and thus to be\na paradigm case of metaphysical nonsense (Carnap 1932/1959; for a nice\naccount and analysis of the disagreement between Heidegger and Carnap,\nsee Critchley 2001). But placing Carnap's positivist critique to\none side, the idea of the nothing allows Heidegger to rethink our\nrelationship with death in relation to poetic habitation. In Being\nand Time, Being-towards-death is conceived as a relation to the\npossibility of one's own non-existence. This gives us a sense in\nwhich Dasein has an internal structural relation to the nothing. That\ninternal structural relation remains crucial to the later philosophy,\nbut now ‘the nothing’ is to be heard explicitly as\n‘the mystery’, a kind of ‘dark matter’ of\nintelligibility that must remain concealed in the unfolding of Being\nthrough which beings are unconcealed. This necessary concealment is\n“the essential belongingness of the not to being as such”\n(Contributions 160: 199). In Being-towards-death, this\n“essential belongingness” is “sheltered” and\n“comes to light with a singular keenness”\n(Contributions 160: 199). This is because (echoing a point\nmade earlier) the concealing-unconcealing structure of Being is\nultimately to be traced to Dasein's essential finitude. Sheehan\n(2001) puts it like this: “[o]ur finitude makes all\n‘as’-taking… possible by requiring us to understand\nthings not immediately and ontically… but indirectly and\nontologically (= imperfectly), through their being”. In\nBeing-towards-death, the human finitude that grounds the mystery, the\nplenitude of possible worlds in which I am not, is highlighted. As\nmortals, then, our internal relation to death links us to the mystery\n(see The Thing). So dwelling (as poetic habitation) involves\nnot only embeddedness in the fourfold, but also, as part of a unitary\nontological structure, a necessary relationship with the mystery. (As\nmentioned earlier (2.2.7), it is arguable that the sense of the nothing\nas unactualized possibilities of Being is already at work in Being\nand Time (see Vallega-Neu 2003, 21). Indeed, Heidegger's\nexplicit remarks on Being-towards-death in the Contributions\n(sections 160–2) suggest that it is. But even if that is so, the idea\nundoubtedly finds its fullest expression in the later\nwork.) \n\nIf the essence of human Being is to dwell in the fourfold, then\nhuman beings are to the extent that they so dwell. And this\nwill be achieved to the extent that human beings realize the\n“basic character of dwelling”, which Heidegger now argues\nis a matter of safeguarding “the fourfold in its\nessential unfolding” (Building Dwelling Thinking, 352).\nSuch safeguarding is unpacked as a way of Being in which human beings\nsave the earth, receive the sky as sky, await the divinities as\ndivinities, and initiate their own essential being as mortals. Perhaps\nthe best way to understand this four-way demand is to explore\nHeidegger's claim that modern humans, especially modern Western\nhumans, systematically fail to meet it. That is, we are marked out by\nour loss of dwelling—our failure to safeguard the fourfold in\nits essential unfolding. This existential malaise is what Heidegger\nrefers to in the Letter on Humanism as the oblivion of Being.\nAs we are about to see, the fact that this is the basic character of\nour modern human society is, according to Heidegger, explained by the\npredominance of a mode of sense-making that, in the\nContributions, he calls machination, but which he\nlater (and more famously) calls technology.  \n\nIn his 1953 piece The Question Concerning Technology,\nHeidegger begins with the everyday account of technology according to\nwhich technology is the vast array of instruments, machines, artefacts\nand devices that we human beings invent, build, and then exploit. On\nthis view technology is basically a tool that we control. Heidegger\nclaims that this everyday account is, in a sense, correct, but it\nprovides only a limited “instrumental and anthropological\ndefinition” of technology (Question Concerning\nTechnology 312). It depicts technology as a means to an end\n(instrumental) and as a product of human activity (anthropological).\nWhat needs to be exposed and interrogated, however, is something that\nis passed over by the everyday account, namely the essence of\ntechnology. To bring this into view, Heidegger reinterprets his earlier\nnotion of intelligibility in terms of the concept of a\nclearing. A clearing is a region of Being in which things are\nrevealed as mattering in some specific way or another. To identify the\nessence of technology is to lay bare technology as a clearing, that is,\nto describe a technological mode of Being. As Heidegger puts it in the\nContributions (61: 88), “[i]n the context of the\nbeing-question, this word [machination, technology] does not name a\nhuman comportment but a manner of the essential swaying of\nbeing”. \n\nSo what is the character of entities as revealed technologically?\nHeidegger's claim is that the “revealing that holds sway\nthroughout modern technology… [is]… a challenging…\nwhich puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy\nwhich can be extracted and stored as such” (Question\nConcerning Technology 320). The mode of revealing characteristic\nof modern technology understands phenomena in general—including\nthe non-biological natural world, plants, animals, and indeed human\nbeings—to be no more than what Heidegger calls\nstanding-reserve, that is, resources to be exploited as means\nto ends. This analysis extends to regions of nature and sections of\nsociety that have not yet been harnessed positively as resources. Such\nunexploited elements (e.g., an unexplored jungle, this year's\nunemployed school leavers) exist technologically precisely as\npotential resources. \n\nHeidegger's flagship example of technology is a hydroelectric\nplant built on the Rhine river that converts that river into a mere\nsupplier of water power. Set against this “monstrousness”\n(Question Concerning Technology 321) is the poetic habitation\nof the natural environment of the Rhine as signalled by an old wooden\nbridge that spanned the river for hundreds of years, plus the river as\nrevealed by Hölderlin's poem “The Rhine”. In\nthese cases of poetic habitation, natural phenomena are revealed to us\nas objects of respect and wonder. One might think that Heidegger is\nover-reacting here, and that despite the presence of the hydroelectric\nplant, the Rhine in many ways remains a glorious example of natural\nbeauty. Heidegger's response to this complaint is to focus on how\nthe technological mode of Being corrupts the very notion of unspoilt\nareas of nature, by reducing such areas to resources ripe for\nexploitation by the tourist industry. Turning our attention to\ninter-human affairs, the technological mode of Being manifests itself\nwhen, for example, a friendly chat in the bar is turned into networking\n(Dreyfus 1993). And, in the light of Heidegger's analysis, one\nmight smile wryly at the trend for companies to take what used to be\ncalled ‘personnel’ departments, and to rename them\n‘human resources’. Many other examples could be given, but\nthe general point is clear. The primary phenomenon to be understood is\nnot technology as a collection of instruments, but rather technology as\na clearing that establishes a deeply instrumental and, as Heidegger\nsees it, grotesque understanding of the world in general. Of course, if\ntechnological revealing were a largely restricted phenomenon,\ncharacteristic of isolated individuals or groups, then\nHeidegger's analysis of it would be of limited interest. The\nsting in the tale, however, is that, according to Heidegger,\ntechnological revealing is not a peripheral aspect of Being. Rather, it\ndefines our modern way of living, at least in the\nWest. \n\nAt this point one might pause to wonder whether technology really is\nthe structure on which we should be concentrating. The\ncounter-suggestion would be that technological thinking is merely the\npractical application of modern mathematical science, and that the\nlatter is therefore the primary phenomenon. Heidegger rejects this\nview, arguing in contrast that the establishment of the technological\nmode of revealing is a necessary condition for there to be mathematical\nscience at all, since such science “demands that nature be\norderable as standing-reserve” by requiring that “nature\nreport itself in some way or other that is identifiable through\ncalculation and that it remain orderable as a system of\ninformation” (Question Concerning Technology 328).\nEither way, one might object to the view of science at work here, by\npointing to analyses which suggest that while science may\nreduce objects to instrumental means rather than ends, it need not\nbehave in this way. For example, O'Neill (2003) develops such an\nanalysis by drawing explicitly on (one interpretation of) the Marxist\n(and ultimately Aristotelian) notion of the humanization of the\nsenses. Good science may depend on the capacity for the\ndisinterested use of the senses, and so foster a non-instrumental\nresponsiveness to natural objects as ends rather than as means. This is\na ‘humanization’ because the disinterested use of the\nsenses is a characteristically human capacity. Thus to develop such a\ncapacity is to develop a distinctively human virtue, something which is\na constituent of human well-being. Moreover, if science may sometimes\noperate with a sense of awe and wonder in the face of beings, it may\npoint the way beyond the technological clearing, an effect that, as we\nshall see later, Heidegger thinks is achieved principally by some great\nart.  \n\nBy revealing beings as no more than the measurable and the\nmanipulable, technology ultimately reduces beings to\nnot-beings (Contributions 2: 6). This is our first\nproper glimpse of the oblivion of Being, the phenomenon that, in the\nContributions, Heidegger also calls the abandonment of Being,\nor the abandonment of beings by Being (e.g., 55: 80). The notion of a\nnot-being signals two things: (i) technological revealing drives out\nany sense of awe and wonder in the presence of beings, obliterating the\nsecularized sense of what is sacred that is exemplified by the poetic\nhabitation of the natural environment of the Rhine; (ii) we are\nessentially indifferent to the loss. Heidegger calls this indifference\n“the hidden distress of no-distress-at-all”\n(Contributions 4: 8). Indeed, on Heidegger's diagnosis,\nour response to the loss of any feeling of sacredness or awe in the\nface of beings is to find a technological substitute for that feeling,\nin the form of “lived-experience”, a drive for\nentertainment and information, “exaggeration and uproar”\n(Contributions 66: 91). All that said, however, technology\nshould not be thought of as a wholly ‘negative’ phenomenon.\nFor Heidegger, technology is not only the great danger, it is also a\nstage in the unfolding of Being that brings us to the brink of a kind\nof secularized salvation, by awakening in us a (re-)discovery of the\nsacred, appropriately understood (cf. Thomson 2003, 64–66). A rough\nanalogy might be drawn here with the Marxist idea that the unfolding of\nhistory results in the establishment of capitalist means of production\nwith their characteristic ‘negative’ elements—labour treated merely as a commodity, the multi-dimensional alienation\nof the workers—that bring us to the brink of (by creating the\nimmediate social and economic preconditions for) the socialist\ntransformation of society. Indeed, the analogy might be pushed a little\nfurther: just as the socialist transformation of society remains\nanything but inevitable (Trotsky taught us that), Heidegger argues that\nthe salvation-bringing transformation of the present condition of human\nbeing is most certainly not bound to\noccur. \n\nTo bring all these points into better view, we need to take a step\nback and ask the following question. Is the technological mode of\nrevealing ultimately a human doing for which we are responsible?\nHeidegger's answer is ‘yes and no’. On the one hand,\nhumankind is the active agent of technological thinking, so humankind\nis not merely a passive element. On the other hand, “the\nunconcealment itself… is never a human handiwork”\n(Question Concerning Technology 324). As Heidegger later put\nit, the “essence of man is framed, claimed and challenged by a\npower which manifests itself in the essence of technology, a power\nwhich man himself does not control.” (Only a God\ncan Save Us; 107, my emphasis). To explicate the latter\npoint, Heidegger introduces the concepts of destining (cf. the\nearlier notion of ‘destiny’) and enframing.\nDestining is “what first starts man upon a way of\nrevealing” (Question Concerning Technology 329). As such\nit is an a priori transcendental structure of human Being and so beyond\nour control. Human history is a temporally organized kaleidoscope of\nparticular ordainings of destining (see also On the Essence of\nTruth). Enframing is one such ordaining, the “gathering\ntogether of the setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him\nforth, to reveal the actual, in the mode of ordering, as\nstanding-reserve” (Question Concerning Technology 325).\nThis is, of course, a way of unpacking the point (see above) that\ntechnology is “a manner of the essential swaying of being”\n(Contributions 61: 88), that is, of Being's own\nessential unfolding.  \n\nEnframing, then, is the ordaining of destining that ushers in the\nmodern technological clearing. But there is more to it than that. To\nsee why, consider the following criticism of Heidegger's\nanalysis, as we have unpacked it so far. Any suggestion that\ntechnological thinking has appeared for the first time along with our\nmodern Western way of living would seem to be straightforwardly false.\nTo put the point crudely, surely the ancient Greeks sometimes treated\nentities merely as instrumental means. But if that is right, and\nHeidegger would agree that it is, then how can it be that technological\nthinking defines the spirit of our age? The answer lies in\nHeidegger's belief that pre-modern, traditional artisanship (as\nexemplified by the old wooden bridge over the Rhine), manifests what he\ncalls poiesis. In this context poiesis is to be understood as\na process of gathering together and fashioning natural materials in\nsuch a way that the human project in which they figure is in a deep\nharmony with, indeed reveals—or as Heidegger sometimes\nsays when discussing poiesis, brings forth—the essence\nof those materials and any natural environment in which they are set.\nThus, in discussing what needs to be learnt by an apprentice to a\ntraditional cabinetmaker, Heidegger writes: \nIf he is to become a true cabinetmaker, he makes himself answer and\nrespond above all to the different kinds of wood and to the shapes\nslumbering within wood—to wood as it enters into man's\ndwelling with all the hidden riches of its essence. In fact, this\nrelatedness to wood is what maintains the whole craft. Without that\nrelatedness, the craft will never be anything but empty busywork, any\noccupation with it will be determined exclusively by business concerns.\nEvery handicraft, all human dealings, are constantly in that danger.\n(What is Called Thinking? 379) \n\nPoiesis, then, is a process of revealing. Poietic events are acts of\nunconcealment—one is tempted to coin the ugly neologism\ntruth-ing—in which entities are allowed to show\nthemselves. As with the closely related notion of original truth that\nis at work in Being and Time, the idea of entities showing\nthemselves does not imply that what is revealed in poiesis is something\nindependent of human involvement. Thus what is revealed by the\nartisanship of the cabinetmaker is “wood as it enters into\nman's dwelling”. This telling remark forges a crucial\nphilosophical link (and not merely an etymological one) between the\npoietic and poetic. Poietic events and poetic habitation involve the\nvery same mode of intelligibility. \n\nBy introducing the concept of poiesis, and by unearthing the\npresence of the phenomenon in traditional artisanship, Heidegger is\nsuggesting that even though technological thinking was a possibility in\npre-modern society, it was neither the only nor the dominant mode of\nbringing-forth. So what has changed? Heidegger argues that what is\ndistinctive about enframing as an ordaining of destining is (i) that it\n“drives out every other possibility of revealing”\n(Question Concerning Technology 332), and (ii) that it covers\nup revealing as such (more precisely, covers up the\nconcealing-unconcealing character of appropriation), thereby leaving us\nblind to the fact that technology is, in its essence, a clearing. For\nHeidegger, these dual features of enframing are intimately tied up with\nthe idea of technology as metaphysics completing itself. He\nwrites: “[a]s a form of truth [clearing] technology is grounded\nin the history of metaphysics, which is itself a distinctive and up to\nnow the only perceptible phase of the history of Being”\n(Letter on Humanism 244). According to Heidegger, metaphysics\nconceives of Being as a being (for more on the reduction of Being to a\nbeing, see section 2.2.1 above). In so doing, metaphysics obscures the\nconcealing-unconcealing dynamic of the essential unfolding of Being, a\ndynamic that provides the a priori condition for there to be beings.\nThe history of metaphysics is thus equivalent to the history of Western\nphilosophy in which Being as such is passed over, a history that, for\nHeidegger, culminates in the nihilistic forces of Nietzsche's\neternally recurring will-to-power. The totalizing logic of metaphysics\ninvolves the view that there is a single clearing (whatever it may be)\nthat constitutes reality. This renders thought insensitive to the\nfundamental structure of Being, in which any particular clearing is\nontologically co-present with the unintelligible plenitude of\nalternative clearings, the mystery. With this totalizing logic in view,\nenframing might be thought of as the ordaining of destining that\nestablishes the technological clearing as the one dominant picture, to\nthe exclusion of all others. Hence technology is metaphysics completing\nitself. \n\nWe are now in a position to deal with two items of unfinished\nbusiness. First, recall the stylistic shift that characterizes\nHeidegger's later work. Heidegger not only increasingly engages\nwith poetry in his later thinking (especially the works of the German\nlyric poet Hölderlin), he also adopts a substantially more poetic\nstyle of writing. But why? The language of metaphysics, which\nultimately unpacks itself as technological, calculative thinking, is a\nlanguage from which Heidegger believed he did not fully escape in\nBeing and Time (see quotation from the Letter on\nHumanism at the beginning of section 3.1 above, and Vallega-Neu\n2003 24–9 for discussion). What is needed to think Being historically,\nto think Being in its essential unfolding, is a different kind of\nphilosophical language, a language suggested by the poetic character of\ndwelling. It is important to realize that Heidegger's intention\nhere is not to place Being beyond philosophy and within the reach of\npoetry, although he does believe that certain poets, such as\nHölderlin, enable us to glimpse the mysterious aspect of Being.\nHis intention, rather, is to establish that the kind of philosophy that\nis needed here is itself poetic. This explains the stylistic component\nof the turn. \n\nSecondly, recall the loss of dwelling identified by Heidegger.\nModern humankind (at least in the West) is in the (enframed) grip of\ntechnological thinking. Because of this promotion of instrumentality as\nthe fundamental way of Being of entities, we have lost sight of how to\ninhabit the fourfold poetically, of how to safeguard the fourfold in\nits essential unfolding. Such safeguarding would, in a sense, be the\nopposite of technological thinking. But what ‘opposite’\namounts to here needs to be worked out with care. Given contemporary\nconcerns over deforestation, global warming and the like, it is\ntempting to think that Heidegger's analysis of technology might\nprovide the philosophical platform for some sort of extreme\neco-radicalism. However, while there is undoubtedly much of value to be\nsaid about the contribution that Heidegger's thinking may make to\ncontemporary debates in environmental ethics (see e.g., Zimmerman 1983,\n1993, 2002), Heidegger was no eco-warrior and no luddite. Although he\noften promoted a romantic image of a pre-technological age inhabited by\nworthy peasants in touch with nature, he did not believe that it is\npossible for modern humankind to forge some pastoral Eden from which\ntechnology (in both the everyday and the essential sense) is entirely\nabsent. So we should neither “push on blindly with\ntechnology” nor “curse it as the work of the devil”\n(Question Concerning Technology 330). Indeed, both these\noptions would at root be technological modes of thinking. The way\nforward, according to Heidegger, is not to end technology, but rather\nto inhabit it differently (see e.g., Vallega-Neu 2003 93 note 15). We\nneed to transform our mode of Being into one in which technology (in\nthe sense of the machines and devices of the modern age) is there for\nus to enjoy and use, but in which technology (in the sense of a mode of\nBeing-in-the-world) is not our only or fundamental way of encountering\nentities. And what is the basic character of this reinhabiting? It is\nto shelter the truth of Being in beings (e.g.,\nContributions 246: 273), to safeguard the fourfold in its\nessential unfolding. In what, then, does this safeguarding\nconsist? \n\nHeidegger argues that if humankind is to enter into safeguarding, it\nneeds to learn (or perhaps to learn once more) to think of Being as a\ngift that has been granted to us in history. Indeed, to think properly\nis precisely to be grateful for the gift of Being (see What is\nCalled Thinking?). (Terms such as ‘gift’ and\n‘granted’ should not be heard theologically, but in terms\nof secularized sacredness and destining.) In this learning process,\ncertain artworks constitute ontological beacons that disrupt the\ntechnological clearing. Thus recall that Heidegger identifies a shared\nform of disclosure that is instantiated both by the old wooden bridge\nover the Rhine and by Hölderlin's poem “The\nRhine”. We can now understand this identification in terms of the\nclaim that certain artworks (although of course not those that\nthemselves fall prey to technological thinking) share with traditional\nartisanship the capacity to realize poiesis. In so doing such artworks\nsucceed in bringing us into contact with the mystery through their\nexpression of dwelling (poetic habitation). In listening attentively\nand gratefully to how Being announces itself in such artworks,\nhumankind will prepare themselves for the task of\nsafeguarding. \n\nBut what exactly would one do in order to safeguard the\nfourfold in its essential unfolding. Recall that in Building\nDwelling Thinking Heidegger presents safeguarding as a\nfour-dimensional way of Being. The first two dimensions—saving\nthe earth and receiving the sky as sky—refer to our\nrelationship with the non-human natural world. As such they forge a\ngenuine connection between the later Heidegger and contemporary\nenvironmentalist thinking. However, the connection needs to be stated\nwith care. Once again the concept of poiesis is central. Heidegger\nholds that the self-organized unfolding of the natural world, the\nunaided blossoming of nature, is itself a process of poiesis.\nIndeed it is poiesis “in the highest sense” (Question\nConcerning Technology 317). One might think, then, that saving the\nearth, safeguarding in its first dimension, is a matter of leaving\nnature to its own devices, of actively ensuring that the conditions\nobtain for unaided natural poiesis. However, for Heidegger, saving the\nearth is primarily an ontological, rather than an ecological, project.\n‘Save’ here means “to set something free into its own\nessence” (Building Dwelling Thinking, p.352), and thus\njoins a cluster of related concepts that includes dwelling and also\npoiesis as realized in artisanship and art. So while, say,\nfiercely guarding the integrity of wilderness areas may be one route to\nsafeguarding, saving the earth may also be achieved through the kind of\nartisanship and its associated gathering of natural materials that is\ncharacteristic of the traditional cabinetmaker. The concept of saving\nas a setting free of something into its own essence also clears a path\nto another important point. All four dimensions of safeguarding have at\ntheir root the notion of staying with things, of letting\nthings be in their essence through cultivation or construction.\nHeidegger describes such staying with things as “the only way in\nwhich the fourfold stay within the fourfold [i.e., safeguarding] is\naccomplished at any time in simple unity” (Building Dwelling\nThinking 353). It is thus the unifying existential structure of\nsafeguarding. \n\nWhat now of safeguarding in its second dimension—to receive\nthe sky as sky? Here Heidegger's main concern seems to be to\nadvocate the synchronization of contemporary human life with the\nrhythms of nature (day and night, the seasons, and so on). Here\nsafeguarding is exemplified by the aforementioned peasants whose lives\nwere interlocked with such natural rhythms (through planting seasons\netc.) in a way that modern technological society is not. One might note\nthat this dislocation has become even more pronounced since\nHeidegger's death, with the advent of the Internet-driven,\n24-hours-a-day-7-days-a-week service culture. Once again we need to\nemphasize that Heidegger's position is not some sort of\nphilosophical ludditism, but a plea for the use of contemporary\nmachines and devices in a way that is sensitive to the temporal\npatterns of the natural world. (For useful discussion see Young 2002,\n110–113. Young makes an illuminating connection with Heidegger's\neulogy to van Gogh's painting of a pair of peasant shoes to be\nfound in The Origin of the Work of Art.)\n \n\nOf course, these relationships with nature are still only part of\nwhat safeguarding involves. Its third and fourth dimensions demand that\nhuman beings await the divinities as divinities and “initiate\ntheir own essential being—their being capable of death as death—into the use and practice of this capacity, so that there may\nbe a good death” (Building Dwelling Thinking 352). The\nlatter demand suggests that we may safeguard each other as mortals by\nintegrating a non-evasive attitude to death (see above) into the\ncultural structures (e.g., the death-related customs and ceremonies) of\nthe community. But now what about the third dimension of safeguarding?\nWhat does it mean to await the divinities as\ndivinities? \n\nLet's again approach our question via a potential problem with\nHeidegger's account. Echoing a worry that attaches to the concept\nof heritage in Being and Time, it may seem that the notion of\ndestining, especially in its more specific manifestation as enframing,\ninvolves a kind of fatalism. Despite some apparent rhetoric to the\ncontrary, however, Heidegger's considered view is that destining\nis ultimately not a “fate that compels”\n(Question Concerning Technology 330). We have been granted the\nsaving power to transform our predicament. Moreover, the fact that\nwe are at a point of danger—a point at which the grip of\ntechnological thinking has all but squeezed out access to the poetic\nand the mystical—will have the effect of thrusting this saving\npower to the fore. This is the good news. The bad news is that: \nphilosophy will not be able to effect an immediate transformation of\nthe present condition of the world. This is not only true of\nphilosophy, but of all merely human thought and endeavor. Only a god\ncan save us. The sole possibility that is left for us is to prepare a\nsort of readiness, through thinking and poetizing, for the appearance\nof the god or for the absence of the god in the time of foundering\n[Untergang]; for in the face of the god who is absent, we\nfounder. (Only a God can Save Us\n107) \n\nThat is what it means to await the divinities as divinities. \n\nHeidegger sometimes uses the term ‘god’ to mean the\nsecularized notion of the sacred already indicated, such that to\nembrace a god would be to maintain due sensitivity to the thought that\nbeings are granted to us in the essential unfolding of Being.\nWhen, in the Contributions, Heidegger writes of the last or\nultimate god of the other beginning (where ‘other’ is in\nrelation to the ‘first beginning’ of Western thought in\nancient Greece—the beginning of metaphysics), it often seems to\nbe this secularized sacredness that he has in mind (cf. Thomson 2003;\nsee Crownfield 2001for an alternative reading of the last god that\nmaintains a more robust theological dimension, although one which is\nconcrete and historicized). However, Heidegger sometimes seems to use\nthe term ‘god’ or ‘divinity’ to refer to a\nheroic figure (a cultural template) who may initiate (or help to\ninitiate) a transformational event in the history of Being by opening\nup an alternative clearing (for this interpretation, see e.g., Young\n2002, 98). These heroic figures are the grounders of the abyss, the\nrestorers of sacredness (Contributions 2: 6, see Sallis 2001\nfor analysis and discussion). It might even be consistent with\nHeidegger's view to relax the requirement that the divine\ncatalyst must be an individual being, and thus to conceive of certain\ntransformational cultural events or forces themselves as divinities\n(Dreyfus 2003). In any case, Heidegger argues that, in the present\ncrisis, we are waiting for a god who will reawaken us to the poetic,\nand thereby enable us to dwell in the fourfold. This task certainly\nseems to be a noble one. Unfortunately, however, it plunges us into the\nmurkiest and most controversial region of the Heideggerian intellectual\nlandscape, his infamous involvement with Nazism. \n\nHere is not the place to enter into the historical debate over\nexactly what Heidegger did and when he did it. However, given his\ndeliberate, albeit arguably short-lived, integration of Nazi ideology\nwith the philosophy of Being (see above), a few all-too-brief comments\non the relationship between Heidegger's politics and his\nphilosophical thought are necessary. (For more detailed evidence and\ndiscussion, as well as a range of positions on how we should interpret\nand respond to this relationship, see e.g., Farias 1989; Neske and\nKettering 1990; Ott 1993; Pattison 2000; Polt 1999; Rockmore 1992;\nSluga, 1993; Wolin 1990, 1993; Young 1997). There is no doubt that\nHeidegger's Nazi sympathies, however long they lasted, have a\nmore intimate relationship with his philosophical thought than might be\nsuggested by apologist claims that he was a victim of his time (in\n1933, lots of intelligent people backed Hitler without thereby\nsupporting the Holocaust that was to come) or that what we have here is\n‘merely’ a case of bad political judgment, deserving of\ncensure but with no implications for the essentially independent\nphilosophical programme. Why does the explanation run deeper? The\nanswer is that Heidegger believed (indeed continued to believe until he\ndied) that the German people were destined to carry out a monumental\nspiritual mission. That mission was nothing less than to be at the helm\nof the aforementioned transformation of Being in the West, from one of\ninstrumental technology to one of poetic dwelling. In mounting this\ntransformation the German people would be acting not imperialistically,\nbut for all nations in the encounter with modern technology. Of course\ndestining is not a fate that compels, so some divine catalyst would be\nneeded to awake the German nation to its historic mission, a catalyst\nprovided by the spiritual leaders of the Nazi Party. \n\nWhy did Heidegger believe that the German people enjoyed this\nposition of world-historical significance? In the later writings\nHeidegger argues explicitly that “[t]hinking itself can be\ntransformed only by a thinking which has the same origin and\ncalling”, so the technological mode of Being must be transcended\nthrough a new appropriation of the European tradition. Within this\nprocess the German people have a special place, because of the\n“inner relationship of the German language with the language of\nthe Greeks and with their thought”. (Quotations from\nOnly a God can Save Us 113.) Thus it is\nthe German language that links the German people in a privileged way\nto, as Heidegger sees it, the genesis of European thought and to a\npre-technological world-view in which bringing-forth as poiesis is\ndominant. This illustrates the general point that, for Heidegger, Being\nis intimately related to language. Language is, as he famously put it\nin the Letter on Humanism (217), the “house of\nBeing”. So it is via language that Being is linked to particular\npeoples. \n\nEven if Heidegger had some sort of argument for the world-historical\ndestiny of the German people, why on earth did he believe that the Nazi\nParty, of all things, harboured the divine catalyst? Part of the reason\nseems to have been the seductive effect of a resonance that exists\nbetween (a) Heidegger's understanding of traditional German rural\nlife as realizing values and meanings that may counteract the insidious\neffects of contemporary technology, and (b) the Nazi image of rustic\nGerman communities, rooted in German soil, providing a bulwark against\nforeign contamination. Heidegger certainly exploits this resonance in\nhis pro-Nazi writings. That said there is an important point of\ndisagreement here, one that Heidegger himself drew out. And once again\nthe role of language in Being is at the heart of the issue. Heidegger\nsteadfastly refused to countenance any biologistic underpinning to his\nviews. In 1945 he wrote that, in his 1934 lectures on logic, he\n“sought to show that language was not the biological-racial\nessence of man, but conversely, that the essence of man was based on\nlanguage as a basic reality of spirit” (Letter to\nthe Rector of Freiburg University, November 4, 1945, 64). In words\nthat we have just met, it is language and not biology that, for\nHeidegger, constitutes the house of Being. So the German Volk\nare a linguistic-historical, rather than a biological, phenomenon,\nwhich explains why Heidegger officially rejected one of the keystones\nof Nazism, namely its biologically grounded racism. Perhaps Heidegger\ndeserves some credit here, although regrettably the aforementioned\nlectures on logic also contain evidence of a kind of historically\ndriven ‘racism’. Heidegger suggests that while Africans\n(along with plants and animals) have no history (in a technical sense\nunderstood in terms of heritage), the event of an airplane carrying\nHitler to Mussolini is genuinely part of history (see Polt 1999,\n155). \n\nHeidegger was soon disappointed by his ‘divinities’. In\na 1935 lecture he remarks that the works that are being peddled\n(about) nowadays as the philosophy of National Socialism, but have\nnothing whatever to do with the inner truth and greatness of this\nmovement (namely, the encounter between global technology and\ncontemporary man), have all been written by men fishing the troubled\nwaters of values and totalities. (An Introduction to\nMetaphysics 166)  So Heidegger came to believe that the spiritual\nleaders of the Nazi party were false gods. They were ultimately agents\nof technological thought and thus incapable of completing the historic\nmission of the German people to transcend global technology.\nNonetheless, one way of hearing the 1935 remark is that Heidegger\ncontinued to believe in the existence of, and the philosophical\nmotivation for, that mission, a view that Rockmore (1992, 123–4) calls\n“an ideal form of Nazism”. This interpretation has some\nforce. But perhaps we can at least make room for the thought that\nHeidegger's repudiation of Nazism goes further than talk of an\nideal Nazism allows. For example, responding to the fact that Heidegger\ndrew a parallel between modern agriculture (as a motorized\nfood-industry) and “the manufacturing of corpses in gas chambers\nand extermination camps”, Young (1997) argues that this would\ncount as a devaluing of the Holocaust only on a superficial reading.\nAccording to Young, Heidegger's point is that both modern\nagriculture and the Final Solution are workings-out of the\ntechnological mode of Being, which does not entail that they should be\ntreated as morally equivalent. (Heidegger draws the parallel in a\nlecture called The Enframing given in 1949. The quotation is\ntaken from Young 1997, 172. For further discussion, see Pattison\n2000). \n\nHeidegger's involvement with Nazism casts a shadow over his\nlife. Whether, and if so to what extent, it casts a more concentrated\nshadow over at least some of his philosophical work is a more difficult\nissue. It would be irresponsible to ignore the relationship between\nHeidegger's philosophy and his politics. But it is surely\npossible to be critically engaged in a deep and intellectually\nstimulating way with his sustained investigation into Being, to find\nmuch of value in his capacity to think deeply about human life, to\nstruggle fruitfully with what he says about our loss of dwelling, and\nto appreciate his massive and still unfolding contribution to thought\nand to thinking, without looking for evidence of Nazism in every twist\nand turn of the philosophical path he lays down.
