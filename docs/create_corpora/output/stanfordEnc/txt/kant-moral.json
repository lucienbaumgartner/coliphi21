Kant characterized the CI\nas an objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle that\nwe must always follow despite any natural desires or inclinations we\nmay have to the contrary. All specific moral requirements, according\nto Kant, are justified by this principle, which means that all immoral\nactions are irrational because they violate the CI. Other\nphilosophers, such as Hobbes, Locke and Aquinas, had also argued that\nmoral requirements are based on standards of rationality. However,\nthese standards were either instrumental principles of rationality for\nsatisfying one’s desires, as in Hobbes, or external rational\nprinciples that are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and Aquinas.\nKant agreed with many of his predecessors that an analysis of\npractical reason reveals the requirement that rational agents must\nconform to instrumental principles. Yet he also argued that conformity\nto the CI (a non-instrumental principle), and hence to moral\nrequirements themselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential to\nrational agency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine that\na rational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free, in the sense\nof being the author of the law that binds it. The fundamental\nprinciple of morality — the CI — is none other than the\nlaw of an autonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant’s moral\nphilosophy is a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairs\ngoes well beyond that of a Humean ‘slave’ to the passions.\nMoreover, it is the presence of this self-governing reason in each\nperson that Kant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each as\npossessed of equal worth and deserving of equal respect.\n\n\nKant’s most influential positions in moral philosophy are found\nin The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (hereafter,\n“Groundwork”) but he developed, enriched, and in\nsome cases modified those views in later works such as The\nCritique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals,\nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, Religion\nwithin the Boundaries of Mere Reason as well as his essays on\nhistory and related topics. Kant’s Lectures on Ethics,\nwhich were lecture notes taken by three of his students on the courses\nhe gave in moral philosophy, also include relevant material for\nunderstanding his views. We will mainly focus on the foundational\ndoctrines of the Groundwork, even though in recent years some\nscholars have become dissatisfied with this standard approach to\nKant’s views and have turned their attention to the later works.\nWe find the standard approach most illuminating, though we will\nhighlight important positions from the later works where needed.\n\nThe most basic aim of moral philosophy, and so also of the\nGroundwork, is, in Kant’s view, to “seek\nout” the foundational principle of a “metaphysics of\nmorals,” which Kant understands as a system of a priori\nmoral principles that apply the CI to human persons in all times and\ncultures. Kant pursues this project through the first two chapters of\nthe Groundwork. He proceeds by analyzing and elucidating\ncommonsense ideas about morality, including the ideas of a “good\nwill” and “duty”. The point of this first project is\nto come up with a precise statement of the principle or principles on\nwhich all of our ordinary moral judgments are based. The judgments in\nquestion are supposed to be those that any normal, sane, adult human\nbeing would accept on due rational reflection. Nowadays, however, many\nwould regard Kant as being overly optimistic about the depth and\nextent of moral agreement. But perhaps he is best thought of as\ndrawing on a moral viewpoint that is very widely shared and which\ncontains some general judgments that are very deeply held. In any\ncase, he does not appear to take himself to be primarily addressing a\ngenuine moral skeptic such as those who often populate the works of\nmoral philosophers, that is, someone who doubts that she has any\nreason to act morally and whose moral behavior hinges on a rational\nproof that philosophers might try to give. For instance, when, in the\nthird and final chapter of the Groundwork, Kant takes up his\nsecond fundamental aim, to “establish” this foundational\nmoral principle as a demand of each person’s own rational will,\nhis conclusion apparently falls short of answering those who want a\nproof that we really are bound by moral requirements. He rests this\nsecond project on the position that we — or at least creatures\nwith rational wills — possess autonomy. The argument of this\nsecond project does often appear to try to reach out to a metaphysical\nfact about our wills. This has led some readers to the conclusion that\nhe is, after all, trying to justify moral requirements by appealing to\na fact — our autonomy — that even a moral skeptic would\nhave to recognize.  \nKant’s analysis of the common moral concepts of\n“duty” and “good will” led him to believe that\nwe are free and autonomous as long as morality, itself, is not an\nillusion. Yet in the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant also tried\nto show that every event has a cause. Kant recognized that there seems\nto be a deep tension between these two claims: If causal determinism\nis true then, it seems, we cannot have the kind of freedom that\nmorality presupposes, which is “a kind of causality” that\n“can be active, independently of alien causes determining\nit” (G 4:446). \nKant thought that the only way to resolve this apparent conflict is to\ndistinguish between phenomena, which is what we know through\nexperience, and noumena, which we can consistently think but\nnot know through experience. Our knowledge and understanding of the\nempirical world, Kant argued, can only arise within the limits of our\nperceptual and cognitive powers. We should not assume, however, that\nwe know all that may be true about “things in themselves,”\nalthough we lack the “intellectual intuition” that would\nbe needed to learn about such things. \nThese distinctions, according to Kant, allow us to resolve the\n“antinomy” about free will by interpreting the\n“thesis” that free will is possible as about noumena and\nthe “antithesis” that every event has a cause as about\nphenomena. Morality thus presupposes that agents, in an\nincomprehensible “intelligible world,” are able to make\nthings happen by their own free choices in a “sensible\nworld” in which causal determinism is true. \nMany of Kant’s commentators, who are skeptical about these\napparently exorbitant metaphysical claims, have attempted to make\nsense of his discussions of the intelligible and sensible worlds in\nless metaphysically demanding ways. On one interpretation (Hudson\n1994), one and the same act can be described in wholly physical terms\n(as an appearance) and also in irreducibly mental terms (as a thing in\nitself). On this compatibilist picture, all acts are causally\ndetermined, but a free act is one that can be described as determined\nby irreducibly mental causes, and in particular by the causality of\nreason. A second interpretation holds that the intelligible and\nsensible worlds are used as metaphors for two ways of conceiving of\none and the same world (Korsgaard 1996; Allison 1990; Hill 1989a,\n1989b). When we are engaging in scientific or empirical\ninvestigations, we often take up a perspective in which we think of\nthings as subject to natural causation, but when we deliberate, act,\nreason and judge, we often take up a different perspective, in which\nwe think of ourselves and others as agents who are not determined by\nnatural causes. When we take up this latter, practical, standpoint, we\nneed not believe that we or others really are free, in any deep\nmetaphysical sense; we need only operate “under the idea of\nfreedom” (G 4:448). Controversy persists, however, about whether\nKant’s conception of freedom requires a “two worlds”\nor “two perspectives” account of the sensible and\nintelligible worlds (Guyer 1987, 2009; Langton 2001; Kohl 2016;\nWood 1984; Hogan 2009). \nAlthough the two most basic aims Kant saw for moral philosophy are to\nseek out and establish the supreme principle of morality, they are\nnot, in Kant’s view, its only aims. Moral philosophy, for Kant,\nis most fundamentally addressed to the first-person, deliberative\nquestion, “What ought I to do?”, and an answer to that\nquestion requires much more than delivering or justifying the\nfundamental principle of morality. We also need some account, based on\nthis principle, of the nature and extent of the specific moral duties\nthat apply to us. To this end, Kant employs his findings from the\nGroundwork in The Metaphysics of Morals, and offers\na categorization of our basic moral duties to ourselves and others. In\naddition, Kant thought that moral philosophy should characterize and\nexplain the demands that morality makes on human psychology and forms\nof human social interaction. These topics, among others, are addressed\nin central chapters of the second Critique, the\nReligion and again in the Metaphysics of Morals, and\nare perhaps given a sustained treatment in Anthropology from a\nPragmatic Point of View. Further, a satisfying answer to the\nquestion of what one ought to do would have to take into account any\npolitical and religious requirements there are. Each of these\nrequirement turn out to be, indirectly at least, also moral\nobligations for Kant, and are discussed in the Metaphysics of\nMorals and in Religion. Finally, moral philosophy should\nsay something about the ultimate end of human endeavor, the Highest\nGood, and its relationship to the moral life. In the Critique of\nPractical Reason, Kant argued that this Highest Good for humanity\nis complete moral virtue together with complete happiness, the former\nbeing the condition of our deserving the latter. Unfortunately, Kant\nnoted, virtue does not insure wellbeing and may even conflict with it.\nFurther, he thought that there is no real possibility of moral\nperfection in this life and indeed few of us fully deserve the\nhappiness we are lucky enough to enjoy. Reason cannot prove or\ndisprove the existence of Divine Providence, on Kant’s view, nor\nthe immortality of the soul, which seem necessary to rectify these\nthings. Nevertheless, Kant argued, an unlimited amount of time to\nperfect ourselves (immortality) and a commensurate achievement of\nwellbeing (insured by God) are “postulates” required by\nreason when employed in moral matters. \nThroughout his moral works, Kant returns time and again to the\nquestion of the method moral philosophy should employ when pursuing\nthese aims. A basic theme of these discussions is that the fundamental\nphilosophical issues of morality must be addressed a priori,\nthat is, without drawing on observations of human beings and their\nbehavior. Kant’s insistence on an a priori method to\nseek out and establish fundamental moral principles, however, does not\nalways appear to be matched by his own practice. The Metaphysics\nof Morals, for instance, is meant to be based on a\npriori rational principles, but many of the specific duties that\nKant describes, along with some of the arguments he gives in support\nof them, rely on general facts about human beings and our\ncircumstances that are known from experience.  \nIn one sense, it might seem obvious why Kant insists on an a\npriori method. A “metaphysics of morals” would be,\nmore or less, an account of the nature and structure of moral\nrequirements — in effect, a categorization of duties and values.\nSuch a project would address such questions as, What is a\nduty? What kinds of duties are there? What is the\ngood? What kinds of goods are there?, and so on. These appear\nto be metaphysical questions. Any principle used to provide such\ncategorizations appears to be a principle of metaphysics, in a sense,\nbut Kant did not see them as external moral truths that exist\nindependently of rational agents. Moral requirements, instead, are\nrational principles that tell us what we have overriding reason to do.\nMetaphysical principles of this sort are always sought out and\nestablished by a priori methods. \nPerhaps something like this was behind Kant’s thinking. However,\nthe considerations he offers for an a priori method do not\nall obviously draw on this sort of rationale. The following are three\nconsiderations favoring a priori methods that he emphasizes\nrepeatedly. \nThe first is that, as Kant and others have conceived of it, ethics\ninitially requires an analysis of our moral concepts. We must\nunderstand the concepts of a “good will”,\n“obligation”, “duty” and so on, as well as\ntheir logical relationships to one another, before we can determine\nwhether our use of these concepts is justified. Given that the\nanalysis of concepts is an a priori matter, to the degree\nthat ethics consists of such an analysis, ethics is a priori\nas a well. \nOf course, even were we to agree with Kant that ethics should begin\nwith analysis, and that analysis is or should be an entirely a\npriori undertaking, this would not explain why all of\nthe fundamental questions of moral philosophy must be pursued a\npriori. Indeed, one of the most important projects of moral\nphilosophy, for Kant, is to show that we, as rational agents, are\nbound by moral requirements and that fully rational agents would\nnecessarily comply with them. Kant admits that his analytical\narguments for the CI are inadequate on their own because the most they\ncan show is that the CI is the supreme principle of morality if\nthere is such a principle. Kant must therefore address the\npossibility that morality itself is an illusion by showing that the CI\nreally is an unconditional requirement of reason that applies to us.\nEven though Kant thought that this project of\n“establishing” the CI must also be carried out a\npriori, he did not think we could pursue this project simply by\nanalyzing our moral concepts or examining the actual behavior of\nothers. What is needed, instead, is a “synthetic”, but\nstill a priori, kind of argument that starts from ideas of\nfreedom and rational agency and critically examines the nature and\nlimits of these capacities. \nThis is the second reason Kant held that fundamental issues in ethics\nmust be addressed with an a priori method: The ultimate\nsubject matter of ethics is the nature and content of the principles\nthat necessarily determine a rational will. \nFundamental issues in moral philosophy must also be settled a\npriori because of the nature of moral requirements themselves, or\nso Kant thought. This is a third reason he gives for an a priori\nmethod, and it appears to have been of great importance to Kant:\nMoral requirements present themselves as being unconditionally\nnecessary. But an a posteriori method seems ill-suited\nto discovering and establishing what we must do whether we\nfeel like doing it or not; surely such a method could only tell us\nwhat we actually do. So an a posteriori method of\nseeking out and establishing the principle that generates such\nrequirements will not support the presentation of moral\n“oughts” as unconditional necessities. Kant argued that\nempirical observations could only deliver conclusions about, for\ninstance, the relative advantages of moral behavior in various\ncircumstances or how pleasing it might be in our own eyes or the eyes\nof others. Such findings clearly would not support the unconditional\nnecessity of moral requirements. To appeal to a posteriori\nconsiderations would thus result in a tainted conception of moral\nrequirements. It would view them as demands for which compliance is\nnot unconditionally necessary, but rather necessary only if additional\nconsiderations show it to be advantageous, optimific or in some other\nway felicitous. Thus, Kant argued that if moral philosophy is to guard\nagainst undermining the unconditional necessity of obligation in its\nanalysis and defense of moral thought, it must be carried out entirely\na priori. \nKant’s analysis of commonsense ideas begins with the thought\nthat the only thing good without qualification is a “good\nwill”. While the phrases “he’s good hearted”,\n“she’s good natured” and “she means\nwell” are common, “the good will” as Kant thinks of\nit is not the same as any of these ordinary notions. The idea of a\ngood will is closer to the idea of a “good person”, or,\nmore archaically, a “person of good will”. This use of the\nterm “will” early on in analyzing ordinary moral thought\nprefigures later and more technical discussions concerning the nature\nof rational agency. Nevertheless, this idea of a good will is an\nimportant commonsense touchstone to which Kant returns throughout his\nworks. The basic idea, as Kant describes it in the Groundwork, is that\nwhat makes a good person good is his possession of a will that is in a\ncertain way “determined” by, or makes its decisions on the\nbasis of, the moral law. The idea of a good will is supposed to be the\nidea of one who is committed only to make decisions that she holds to\nbe morally worthy and who takes moral considerations in themselves to\nbe conclusive reasons for guiding her behavior. This sort of\ndisposition or character is something we all highly value, Kant\nthought. He believes we value it without limitation or qualification.\nBy this, we believe, he means primarily two things. \nFirst, unlike anything else, there is no conceivable circumstance in\nwhich we regard our own moral goodness as worth forfeiting simply in\norder to obtain some desirable object. By contrast, the value of all\nother desirable qualities, such as courage or cleverness, can be\ndiminished, forgone, or sacrificed under certain circumstances:\nCourage may be laid aside if it requires injustice, and it is better\nnot to be witty if it requires cruelty. There is no implicit\nrestriction or qualification to the effect that a commitment to give\nmoral considerations decisive weight is worth honoring, but\nonly under such and such circumstances. \nSecond, possessing and maintaining a steadfast commitment to moral\nprinciples is the very condition under which anything else is worth\nhaving or pursuing. Intelligence and even pleasure are worth having\nonly on the condition that they do not require giving up one’s\nfundamental moral convictions. The value of a good will thus cannot be\nthat it secures certain valuable ends, whether of our own or of\nothers, since their value is entirely conditional on our possessing\nand maintaining a good will. Indeed, since a good will is good under\nany condition, its goodness must not depend on any particular\nconditions obtaining. Thus, Kant points out that a good will must then\nalso be good in itself and not in virtue of its relationship\nto other things such as the agent’s own happiness, overall\nwelfare or any other effects it may or may not produce A good will\nwould still “shine like a jewel” even if it were\n“completely powerless to carry out its aims” (G\n4:394). \nIn Kant’s terms, a good will is a will whose decisions are\nwholly determined by moral demands or, as he often refers to this, by\nthe Moral Law. Human beings inevitably feel this Law as a constraint\non their natural desires, which is why such Laws, as applied to human\nbeings, are imperatives and duties. A human will in which the Moral\nLaw is decisive is motivated by the thought of duty. A\nholy or divine will, if it exists, though good,\nwould not be good because it is motivated by thoughts of duty because\nsuch a will does not have natural inclinations and so necessarily\nfulfills moral requirements without feeling constrained to do so. It\nis the presence of desires that could operate independently\nof moral demands that makes goodness in human beings a constraint, an\nessential element of the idea of “duty.” So in analyzing\nunqualified goodness as it occurs in imperfectly rational creatures\nsuch as ourselves, we are investigating the idea of being motivated by\nthe thought that we are constrained to act in certain ways that we\nmight not want to simply from the thought that we are morally\nrequired to do so. \nKant confirms this by comparing motivation by duty with other sorts of\nmotives, in particular, with motives of self-interest,\nself-preservation, sympathy and happiness. He argues that a dutiful\naction from any of these motives, however praiseworthy it may be, does\nnot express a good will. Assuming an action has moral worth only if it\nexpresses a good will, such actions have no genuine “moral\nworth.” The conformity of one’s action to duty in such\ncases is only related by accident to morality. For instance, if one is\nmotivated by happiness alone, then had conditions not conspired to\nalign one’s duty with one’s own happiness one would not\nhave done one’s duty. By contrast, were one to supplant any of\nthese motivations with the motive of duty, the morality of the action\nwould then express one’s determination to act dutifully out of\nrespect for the moral law itself. Only then would the action have\nmoral worth. \nKant’s views in this regard have understandably been the subject\nof much controversy. Many object that we do not think better of\nactions done for the sake of duty than actions performed out of\nemotional concern or sympathy for others, especially those things we\ndo for friends and family. Worse, moral worth appears to require not\nonly that one’s actions be motivated by duty, but also that no\nother motives, even love or friendship, cooperate. Yet Kant’s\ndefenders have argued that his point is not that we do not admire or\npraise motivating concerns other than duty, only that from the point\nof view of someone deliberating about what to do, these concerns are\nnot decisive in the way that considerations of moral duty are. What is\ncrucial in actions that express a good will is that in conforming to\nduty a perfectly virtuous person always would, and so ideally we\nshould, recognize and be moved by the thought that our conformity is\nmorally obligatory. The motivational structure of the agent should be\narranged so that she always treats considerations of duty as\nsufficient reasons for conforming to those requirements. In other\nwords, we should have a firm commitment not to perform an action if it\nis morally forbidden and to perform an action if it is morally\nrequired. Having a good will, in this sense, is compatible with having\nfeelings and emotions of various kinds, and even with aiming to\ncultivate some of them in order to counteract desires and inclinations\nthat tempt us to immorality. Controversy persists, however, about\nwhether Kant’s claims about the motive of duty go beyond this\nbasic point (Timmermann 2007; Herman 1993; Wood 1998; Baron 1995).\n \nSuppose for the sake of argument we agree with Kant. We now need to\nknow what distinguishes the principle that lays down our duties from\nthese other motivating principles, and so makes motivation by it the\nsource of unqualified value. \nAccording to Kant, what is singular about motivation by duty is that\nit consists of bare respect for the moral law. What naturally comes to\nmind is this: Duties are rules or laws of some sort combined with some\nsort of felt constraint or incentive on our choices, whether from\nexternal coercion by others or from our own powers of reason. For\ninstance, the bylaws of a club lay down duties for its officers and\nenforce them with sanctions. City and state laws establish the duties\nof citizens and enforce them with coercive legal power. Thus, if we do\nsomething because it is our “civic” duty, or our duty\n“as a boy scout” or “a good American,” our\nmotivation is respect for the code that makes it our duty. Thinking we\nare duty bound is simply respecting, as such, certain laws pertaining\nto us. \nHowever intuitive, this cannot be all of Kant’s meaning. For one\nthing, as with the Jim Crow laws of the old South and the Nuremberg\nlaws of Nazi Germany, the laws to which these types of “actions\nfrom duty” conform may be morally despicable. Respect for such\nlaws could hardly be thought valuable. For another, our motive in\nconforming our actions to civic and other laws is rarely unconditional\nrespect. We also have an eye toward doing our part in maintaining\ncivil or social order, toward punishments or loss of standing and\nreputation in violating such laws, and other outcomes of lawful\nbehavior. Indeed, we respect these laws to the degree, but only to the\ndegree, that they do not violate values, laws or principles we hold\nmore dear. Yet Kant thinks that, in acting from duty, we are not at\nall motivated by a prospective outcome or some other extrinsic feature\nof our conduct except insofar as these are requirements of duty\nitself. We are motivated by the mere conformity of our will to law as\nsuch. \nTo act out of respect for the moral law, in Kant’s view, is to\nbe moved to act by a recognition that the moral law is a supremely\nauthoritative standard that binds us and to experience a kind of\nfeeling, which is akin to awe and fear, when we acknowledge the moral\nlaw as the source of moral requirements. Human persons inevitably have\nrespect for the moral law even though we are not always moved by it\nand even though we do not always comply with the moral standards that\nwe nonetheless recognize as authoritative.  \nKant’s account of the content of moral requirements and the\nnature of moral reasoning is based on his analysis of the unique force\nmoral considerations have as reasons to act. The force of moral\nrequirements as reasons is that we cannot ignore them no matter how\ncircumstances might conspire against any other consideration. Basic\nmoral requirements retain their reason-giving force under any\ncircumstance, they have universal validity. So, whatever else may be\nsaid of basic moral requirements, their content is universal. Only a\nuniversal law could be the content of a requirement that has the\nreason-giving force of morality. This brings Kant to a preliminary\nformulation of the CI: “I ought never to act except in such a\nway that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal\nlaw” (G 4:402). This is the principle which motivates a good\nwill, and which Kant holds to be the fundamental principle of all of\nmorality. \nKant holds that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a\ncategorical imperative. It is an imperative\nbecause it is a command addressed to agents who could follow it but\nmight not (e.g. , “Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.”). It\nis categorical in virtue of applying to us unconditionally,\nor simply because we possesses rational wills, without reference to\nany ends that we might or might not have. It does not, in other words,\napply to us on the condition that we have antecedently adopted some\ngoal for ourselves.  \nThere are “oughts” other than our moral duties, according\nto Kant, but these oughts are distinguished from the moral ought in\nbeing based on a quite different kind of principle, one that is the\nsource of hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative\nis a command that also applies to us in virtue of our having a\nrational will, but not simply in virtue of this. It requires\nus to exercise our wills in a certain way given we have\nantecedently willed an end. A hypothetical imperative is thus a\ncommand in a conditional form. But not any command in this form counts\nas a hypothetical imperative in Kant’s sense. For instance,\n“if you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands!”\nis a conditional command. But the antecedent conditions under which\nthe command “clap your hands” applies to you do not posit\nany end that you will, but consist rather of emotional and cognitive\nstates you may or may not be in. Further, “if you want pastrami,\ntry the corner deli” is also a command in conditional form, but\nstrictly speaking it too fails to be a hypothetical imperative in\nKant’s sense since this command does not apply to us in virtue\nof our willing some end, but only in virtue of our\ndesiring or wanting an end. For Kant, willing an end\ninvolves more than desiring; it requires actively choosing or\ncommitting to the end rather than merely finding oneself with a\npassive desire for it. Further, there is nothing irrational in failing\nto will means to what one desires. An imperative that applied to us in\nvirtue of our desiring some end would thus not be a hypothetical\nimperative of practical rationality in Kant’s\nsense. \nThe condition under which a hypothetical imperative applies to us,\nthen, is that we will some end. Now, for the most part, the ends we\nwill we might not have willed, and some ends that we do not will we\nmight nevertheless have willed. But there is at least conceptual room\nfor the idea of a natural or inclination-based end that we\nmust will. The distinction between ends that we might or\nmight not will and those, if any, we necessarily will as the kinds of\nnatural beings we are, is the basis for his distinction between two\nkinds of hypothetical imperatives. Kant names these\n“problematic” and “assertoric”, based on how\nthe end is willed. If the end is one that we might or might not will\n— that is, it is a merely possible end — the\nimperative is problematic. For instance, “Don’t ever take\nside with anyone against the Family.” is a problematic\nimperative, even if the end posited here is (apparently) one’s\nown continued existence. Almost all non-moral, rational imperatives\nare problematic, since there are virtually no ends that we necessarily\nwill as human beings. \nAs it turns out, the only (non-moral) end that we will, as a matter of\nnatural necessity, is our own happiness. Any imperative that applied\nto us because we will our own happiness would thus be an\nassertoric imperative. Rationality, Kant thinks, can issue no\nimperative if the end is indeterminate, and happiness is an\nindeterminate end. Although we can say for the most part that if one\nis to be happy, one should save for the future, take care of\none’s health and nourish one’s relationships, these fail\nto be genuine commands in the strictest sense and so are instead mere\n“counsels.” Some people are happy without these, and\nwhether you could be happy without them is, although doubtful, an open\nquestion. \nSince Kant presents moral and prudential rational requirements as\nfirst and foremost demands on our wills rather than on external acts,\nmoral and prudential evaluation is first and foremost an evaluation of\nthe will our actions express. Thus, it is not an error of rationality\nto fail to take the necessary means to one’s (willed) ends, nor\nto fail to want to take the means; one only falls foul of\nnon-moral practical reason if one fails to will the means.\nLikewise, while actions, feelings or desires may be the focus of other\nmoral views, for Kant practical irrationality, both moral and\nprudential, focuses mainly on our willing. \nOne recent interpretive dispute (Hill 1973; Schroeder 2009; Rippon\n2014) has been about whether hypothetical imperatives, in Kant’s\nview, have a “wide” or “narrow” scope. That\nis, do such imperatives tell us to take the necessary means to our\nends or give up our ends (wide scope) or do they simply tell us that,\nif we have an end, then take the necessary means to it. \nKant describes the will as operating on the basis of subjective\nvolitional principles he calls “maxims”. Hence, morality\nand other rational requirements are, for the most part, demands that\napply to the maxims that we act on. . The form of a maxim is “I\nwill A in C in order to realize or produce\nE” where “A” is some act type,\n“C” is some type of circumstance, and\n“E” is some type of end to be realized or\nachieved by A in C. Since this is a principle stating only what some\nagent wills, it is subjective. (A principle that\ngoverns any rational will is an objective principle\nof volition, which Kant refers to as a practical law). For anything to\ncount as human willing, it must be based on a maxim to pursue some end\nthrough some means. Hence, in employing a maxim, any human willing\nalready embodies the form of means-end reasoning that calls for\nevaluation in terms of hypothetical imperatives. To that extent at\nleast, then, anything dignified as human willing is subject\nto rational requirements. \nKant’s first formulation of the CI states that you are to\n“act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at\nthe same time will that it become a universal law” (G 4:421).\nO’Neill (1975, 1989) and Rawls (1980, 1989), among others, take\nthis formulation in effect to summarize a decision procedure for moral\nreasoning, and we will follow their basic outline: First, formulate a\nmaxim that enshrines your reason for acting as you propose. Second,\nrecast that maxim as a universal law of nature governing all rational\nagents, and so as holding that all must, by natural law, act as you\nyourself propose to act in these circumstances. Third, consider\nwhether your maxim is even conceivable in a world governed by this law\nof nature. If it is, then, fourth, ask yourself whether you would, or\ncould, rationally will to act on your maxim in such a world.\nIf you could, then your action is morally permissible. \nIf your maxim fails the third step, you have a “perfect”\nduty admitting “of no exception in favor of inclination”\nto refrain from acting on that maxim (G 4:421). If your maxim fails\nthe fourth step, you have an “imperfect” duty requiring\nyou to pursue a policy that can admit of such exceptions. If your\nmaxim passes all four steps, only then is acting on it morally\npermissible. Following Hill (1971), we can understand the difference\nin duties as formal: Perfect duties come in the form “One must\nnever (or always) φ to the fullest extent possible in\nC”, while imperfect duties, since they require us to\nadopt an end, at least require that “One must sometimes and to\nsome extent φ in C.” So, for instance, Kant held\nthat the maxim of committing suicide to avoid future unhappiness did\nnot pass the third step, the contradiction in conception test. Hence,\none is forbidden to act on the maxim of committing suicide to avoid\nunhappiness. By contrast, the maxim of refusing to assist others in\npursuit of their projects passes the contradiction in conception test,\nbut fails the contradiction in the will test at the fourth step.\nHence, we have a duty to sometimes and to some extent aid and assist\nothers. \nKant held that ordinary moral thought recognized moral duties toward\nourselves as well as toward others. Hence, together with the\ndistinction between perfect and imperfect duties, Kant recognized four\ncategories of duties: perfect duties toward ourselves, perfect duties\ntoward others, imperfect duties toward ourselves and imperfect duties\ntoward others. Kant uses four examples in the Groundwork, one\nof each kind of duty, to demonstrate that every kind of duty can be\nderived from the CI, and hence to bolster his case that the CI is\nindeed the fundamental principle of morality. To refrain from suicide\nis a perfect duty toward oneself; to refrain from making promises you\nhave no intention of keeping is a perfect duty toward others; to\ndevelop one’s talents is an imperfect duty toward oneself; and\nto contribute to the happiness of others is an imperfect duty toward\nothers. Again, Kant’s interpreters differ over exactly how to\nreconstruct the derivation of these duties. We will briefly sketch one\nway of doing so for the perfect duty to others to refrain from lying\npromises and the imperfect duty to ourselves to develop talents. \nKant’s example of a perfect duty to others concerns a promise\nyou might consider making but have no intention of keeping in order to\nget needed money. Naturally, being rational requires not contradicting\noneself, but there is no self-contradiction in the maxim “I will\nmake lying promises when it achieves something I want.” An\nimmoral action clearly does not involve a self-contradiction in this\nsense (as would the maxim of finding a married bachelor). Kant’s\nposition is that it is irrational to perform an action if that\naction’s maxim contradicts itself once made into a universal\nlaw of nature. The maxim of lying whenever it gets you what you\nwant generates a contradiction once you try to combine it with the\nuniversalized version that all rational agents must, by a law of\nnature, lie when doing so gets them what they want. \nHere is one way of seeing how this might work: If I conceive of a\nworld in which everyone by nature must try to deceive people any time\nthis will get them what they want, I am conceiving of a world in which\nno practice of giving one’s word could ever arise and, because\nthis is a law of nature, we can assume that it is widely known that no\nsuch practice could exist. So I am conceiving of a world in which\neveryone knows that no practice of giving one’s word exists. My\nmaxim, however, is to make a deceptive promise in order to get needed\nmoney. And it is a necessary means of doing this that a practice of\ntaking the word of others exists, so that someone might take my word\nand I take advantage of their doing so. Thus, in trying to conceive of\nmy maxim in a world in which no one ever takes anyone’s word in\nsuch circumstances, and knows this about one another, I am trying to\nconceive of this: A world in which no practice of giving one’s\nword exists, but also, at the very same time, a world in which just\nsuch a practice does exist, for me to make use of in my maxim. It is a\nworld containing my promise and a world in which there can be no\npromises. Hence, it is inconceivable that I could sincerely act on my\nmaxim in a world in which my maxim is a universal law of nature. Since\nit is inconceivable that these two things could exist together, I am\nforbidden ever to act on the maxim of lying to get money. \nBy contrast with the maxim of the lying promise, we can easily\nconceive of adopting a maxim of refusing to develop any of our talents\nin a world in which that maxim is a universal law of nature. It would\nundoubtedly be a world more primitive than our own, but pursuing such\na policy is still conceivable in it. However, it is not, Kant argues,\npossible to rationally will this maxim in such a world. The argument\nfor why this is so, however, is not obvious, and some of Kant’s\nthinking seems hardly convincing: Insofar as we are rational, he says,\nwe already necessarily will that all of our talents and abilities be\ndeveloped. Hence, although I can conceive of a talentless world, I\ncannot rationally will that it come about, given that I already will,\ninsofar as I am rational, that I develop all of my own. Yet, given\nlimitations on our time, energy and interest, it is difficult to see\nhow full rationality requires us to aim to fully develop literally all\nof our talents. Indeed, it seems to require much less, a judicious\npicking and choosing among one’s abilities. Further, all that is\nrequired to show that I cannot will a talentless world is that,\ninsofar as I am rational, I necessarily will that some\ntalents in me be developed, not the dubious claim that I rationally\nwill that they all be developed. Moreover, suppose\nrationality did require me to aim at developing all of my talents.\nThen, there seems to be no need to go further in the CI procedure to\nshow that refusing to develop talents is immoral. Given that, insofar\nas we are rational, we must will to develop capacities, it is by this\nvery fact irrational not to do so. \nHowever, mere failure to conform to something we rationally will is\nnot yet immorality. Failure to conform to instrumental principles, for\ninstance, is irrational but not always immoral. In order to show that\nthis maxim is categorically forbidden, one strategy is to make use of\nseveral other of Kant’s claims or assumptions. \nFirst, we must accept Kant’s claim that, by “natural\nnecessity,” we will our own happiness as an end (G 4:415). This\nis a claim he uses not only to distinguish assertoric from problematic\nimperatives, but also to argue for the imperfect duty of helping\nothers (G 4:423) He also appears to rely on this claim in each of his\nexamples. Each maxim he is testing appears to have happiness as its\naim. One explanation for this is that, since each person necessarily\nwills her own happiness, maxims in pursuit of this goal will be the\ntypical object of moral evaluation. This, at any rate, is clear in the\ntalents example itself: The forbidden maxim adopted by the\nne’er-do-well is supposed to be “devoting his life solely\nto…enjoyment” (G 4:423) rather than to developing his\ntalents. \nSecond, we must assume, as also seems reasonable, that a necessary\nmeans to achieving (normal) human happiness is not only that we\nourselves develop some talent, but also that others develop some\ncapacities of theirs at some time. For instance, I cannot engage in\nthe normal pursuits that make up my own happiness, such as playing\npiano, writing philosophy or eating delicious meals, unless I have\ndeveloped some talents myself, and, moreover, someone else has made\npianos and written music, taught me writing, harvested foods and\ndeveloped traditions of their preparation. \nFinally, Kant’s examples come on the heels of defending the\nposition that rationality requires conformity to hypothetical\nimperatives. Thus, we should assume that, necessarily, rational agents\nwill the necessary and available means to any ends that they will. And\nonce we add this to the assumptions that we must will our own\nhappiness as an end, and that developed talents are necessary means to\nachieving that end, it follows that we cannot rationally will that a\nworld come about in which it is a law that no one ever develops any of\ntheir natural talents. We cannot do so, because our own happiness is\nthe very end contained in the maxim of giving ourselves over to\npleasure rather than self-development. Since we will the necessary and\navailable means to our ends, we are rationally committed to willing\nthat everyone sometime develop his or her talents. So since we cannot\nwill as a universal law of nature that no one ever develop any talents\n— given that it is inconsistent with what we now see that we\nrationally will — we are forbidden from adopting the maxim of\nrefusing to develop any of our own. \nMost philosophers who find Kant’s views attractive find them so\nbecause of the Humanity Formulation of the CI. This formulation states\nthat we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity, whether\nin ourselves or in others, as a means only but always as an end in\nitself. This is often seen as introducing the idea of\n“respect” for persons, for whatever it is that is\nessential to our humanity. Kant was clearly right that this and the\nother formulations bring the CI “closer to intuition” than\nthe Universal Law formula. Intuitively, there seems something wrong\nwith treating human beings as mere instruments with no value beyond\nthis. But this very intuitiveness can also invite\nmisunderstandings. \nFirst, the Humanity Formula does not rule out using people as means to\nour ends. Clearly this would be an absurd demand, since we apparently\ndo this all the time in morally appropriate ways. Indeed, it is hard\nto imagine any life that is recognizably human without the use of\nothers in pursuit of our goals. The food we eat, the clothes we wear,\nthe chairs we sit on and the computers we type at are gotten only by\nway of talents and abilities that have been developed through the\nexercise of the wills of many people. What the Humanity Formula rules\nout is engaging in this pervasive use of humanity in such a way that\nwe treat it as a mere means to our ends. Thus, the difference\nbetween a horse and a taxi driver is not that we may use one but not\nthe other as a means of transportation. Unlike a horse, the taxi\ndriver’s humanity must at the same time be treated as an end in\nitself. \nSecond, it is not human beings per se but the\n“humanity” in human beings that we must treat as an end in\nitself. Our “humanity” is that collection of features that\nmake us distinctively human, and these include capacities to engage in\nself-directed rational behavior and to adopt and pursue our own ends,\nand any other rational capacities necessarily connected with these.\nThus, supposing that the taxi driver has freely exercised his rational\ncapacities in pursuing his line of work, we make permissible use of\nthese capacities as a means only if we behave in a way that he could,\nwhen exercising his rational capacities, consent to — for\ninstance, by paying an agreed on price. \nThird, the idea of an end has three senses for Kant, two positive\nsenses and a negative sense. An end in the first positive sense is a\nthing we will to produce or bring about in the world. For instance, if\nlosing weight is my end, then losing weight is something I aim to\nbring about. An end in this sense guides my actions in that once I\nwill to produce something, I then deliberate about and aim to pursue\nmeans of producing it if I am rational. Humanity is not an\n“end” in this sense, though even in this case, the end\n“lays down a law” for me. Once I have adopted an end in\nthis sense, it dictates that I do something: I should act in ways that\nwill bring about the end or instead choose to abandon my goal. \nAn end in the negative sense lays down a law for me as well, and so\nguides action, but in a different way. Korsgaard (1996) offers\nself-preservation as an example of an end in a negative sense: We do\nnot try to produce our self-preservation. Rather, the end of\nself-preservation prevents us from engaging in certain kinds of\nactivities, for instance, picking fights with mobsters, and so on.\nThat is, as an end, it is something I do not act against in\npursuing my positive ends, rather than something I produce. \nHumanity is in the first instance an end in this negative sense: It is\nsomething that limits what I may do in pursuit of my other\nends, similar to the way that my end of self-preservation limits what\nI may do in pursuit of other ends. Insofar as it limits my\nactions, it is a source of perfect duties. Now many of our\nends are subjective in that they are not ends that every rational\nbeing must have. Humanity is an objective end, because it is\nan end that every rational being must have. Hence, my own humanity as\nwell as the humanity of others limit what I am morally\npermitted to do when I pursue my other, non-mandatory, ends. \nThe humanity in myself and others is also a positive end,\nthough not in the first positive sense above, as something to be\nproduced by my actions. Rather, it is something to realize, cultivate\nor further by my actions. Becoming a philosopher, pianist or novelist\nmight be my end in this sense. When my end is becoming a pianist, my\nactions do not, or at least not simply, produce something, being a\npianist, but constitute or realize the activity of being a pianist.\nInsofar as the humanity in ourselves must be treated as an end in\nitself in this second positive sense, it must be cultivated,\ndeveloped or fully actualized. Hence, the humanity in oneself is the\nsource of a duty to develop one’s talents or to\n“perfect” one’s humanity. When one makes one’s\nown humanity one’s end, one pursues its development, much as\nwhen one makes becoming a pianist one’s end, one pursues the\ndevelopment of piano playing. And insofar as humanity is a positive\nend in others, I must attempt to further their ends as well. In so\ndoing, I further the humanity in others, by helping further the\nprojects and ends that they have willingly adopted for themselves. It\nis this sense of humanity as an end-in-itself on which some of\nKant’s arguments for imperfect duties rely. \nFinally, Kant’s Humanity Formula requires “respect”\nfor the humanity in persons. Proper regard for something with absolute\nvalue or worth requires respect for it. But this can invite\nmisunderstandings. One way in which we respect persons, termed\n“appraisal respect” by Stephen Darwall (1977), is clearly\nnot the same as the kind of respect required by the Humanity Formula:\nI may respect you as a rebounder but not a scorer, or as a researcher\nbut not as a teacher. When I respect you in this way, I am positively\nappraising you in light of some achievement or virtue you possess\nrelative to some standard of success. If this were the sort of respect\nKant is counseling then clearly it may vary from person to person and\nis surely not what treating something as an end-in-itself requires.\nFor instance, it does not seem to prevent me from regarding\nrationality as an achievement and respecting one person as a rational\nagent in this sense, but not another. And Kant is not telling us to\nignore differences, to pretend that we are blind to them on mindless\negalitarian grounds. However, a distinct way in which we respect\npersons, referred to as “recognition respect” by Darwall,\nbetter captures Kant’s position: I may respect you because you\nare a student, a Dean, a doctor or a mother. In such cases of\nrespecting you because of who or what you are, I am giving the proper\nregard to a certain fact about you, your being a Dean for instance.\nThis sort of respect, unlike appraisal respect, is not a matter of\ndegree based on your having measured up to some standard of\nassessment. Respect for the humanity in persons is more like\nDarwall’s recognition respect. We are to respect human beings\nsimply because they are persons and this requires a certain sort of\nregard. We are not called on to respect them insofar as they have met\nsome standard of evaluation appropriate to persons. And, crucially for\nKant, persons cannot lose their humanity by their misdeeds –\neven the most vicious persons, Kant thought, deserve basic respect as\npersons with humanity. \nThe third formulation of the CI is “the Idea of the will of\nevery rational being as a will that legislates universal\nlaw.” (G 4:432). Although Kant does not state this as an\nimperative, as he does in the other formulations, it is easy enough to\nput it in that form: Act so that through your maxims you could be a\nlegislator of universal laws. This sounds very similar to the first\nformulation. However, in this case we focus on our status as universal\nlaw givers rather than universal law followers. This\nis of course the source of the very dignity of humanity Kant speaks of\nin the second formulation. A rational will that is merely bound by\nuniversal laws could act accordingly from natural and non-moral\nmotives, such as self-interest. But in order to be a legislator of\nuniversal laws, such contingent motives, motives that rational agents\nsuch as ourselves may or may not have, must be set aside. Hence, we\nare required, according to this formulation, to conform our behavior\nto principles that express this autonomy of the rational will —\nits status as a source of the very universal laws that obligate it. As\nwith the Humanity Formula, this new formulation of the CI does not\nchange the outcome, since each is supposed to formulate the very same\nmoral law, and in some sense “unite” the other\nformulations within it. Kant takes each formulation that succeeds the\nfirst in its own way as bringing the moral law “closer to\nfeeling”. The Autonomy Formula presumably does this by putting\non display the source of our dignity and worth, our status as free\nrational agents who are the source of the authority behind the very\nmoral laws that bind us. \nThis formulation has gained favor among Kantians in recent years (see\nRawls, 1971; Hill, 1972). Many see it as introducing more of a social\ndimension to Kantian morality. Kant states that the above concept of\nevery rational will as a will that must regard itself as enacting laws\nbinding all rational wills is closely connected to another concept,\nthat of a “systematic union of different rational beings under\ncommon laws”, or a “Kingdom of Ends” (G 4:433). The\nformulation of the CI states that we must “act in accordance\nwith the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a merely\npossible kingdom of ends” (G 4:439). It combines the others in\nthat (i) it requires that we conform our actions to the laws of an\nideal moral legislature, (ii) that this legislature lays down\nuniversal laws, binding all rational wills including our own, and\n(iii) that those laws are of “a merely possible kingdom”\neach of whose members equally possesses this status as legislator of\nuniversal laws, and hence must be treated always as an end in itself.\nThe intuitive idea behind this formulation is that our fundamental\nmoral obligation is to act only on principles which could earn\nacceptance by a community of fully rational agents each of whom have\nan equal share in legislating these principles for their\ncommunity. \nKant claimed that all of these CI formulas were equivalent.\nUnfortunately, he does not say in what sense. What he says is\nthat these “are basically only so many formulations of precisely\nthe same law, each one of them by itself uniting the other two within\nit,” and that the differences between them are “more\nsubjectively than objectively practical” in the sense that each\naims “to bring an Idea of reason closer to intuition (by means\nof a certain analogy) and thus nearer to feeling” (G 4:435). He\nalso says that one formula “follows from” another (G\n4:431), and that the concept foundational to one formula “leads\nto a closely connected” concept at the basis of another formula\n(G 4:433). Thus, his claim that the formulations are equivalent could\nbe interpreted in a number of ways. \nKant’s statement that each formula “unites the other two\nwithin it” initially suggests that the formulas are equivalent\nin meaning, or at least one could analytically derive one\nformula from another. Some of Kant’s commentators, for example,\nhave argued along the following lines: That I should always treat\nhumanity as an end in itself entails that I should act only on maxims\nthat are consistent with themselves as universal laws of nature\n(O’Neill 1975, 1990; Engstrom 2009; Sensen 2011). There are\nremaining doubts some commentators have, however, about whether this\nstrategy can capture the full meaning of the Humanity Formula or\nexplain all of the duties that Kant claims to derive from it (Wood\n1999, 2007; Cureton 2013). \nPerhaps, then, if the formulas are not equivalent in meaning, they are\nnevertheless logically interderivable and hence equivalent in this\nsense. The universal law formula is not itself derived, as some of\nKant’s interpreters have suggested, from the principle of\nnon-contradiction. That would have the consequence that the CI is a\nlogical truth, and Kant insists that it is not or at least that it is\nnot analytic. Since the CI formulas are not logical truths, then, it\nis possible that they could be logically interderivable. However,\ndespite his claim that each contains the others within it, what we\nfind in the Groundwork seems best interpreted as a derivation\nof each successive formula from the immediately preceding formula.\nThere are, nonetheless, a few places in which it seems that Kant is\ntrying to work in the opposite direction. One is found in his\ndiscussion of the Humanity Formula. There Kant says that only\nsomething “whose existence in itself had an absolute\nworth” could be the ground of a categorically binding law (G\n4:428). He then boldly proclaims that humanity is this absolutely\nvaluable thing, referring to this as a “postulate” that he\nwill argue for in the final chapter of the Groundwork (G\n4:429n). One might take this as expressing Kant’s intention to\nderive thereby the universal law formula from the Humanity Formula:\nIf something is absolutely valuable, then we must\nact only on maxims that can be universal laws. But (he postulates)\nhumanity is absolutely valuable. Thus, we must act only on\nmaxims that can be universal laws. This (we think) anomolous\ndiscussion may well get at some deep sense in which Kant thought the\nformulations were equivalent. Nonetheless, this derivation of the\nuniversal law formulation from the Humanity Formulation seems to\nrequire a substantive, synthetic claim, namely, that humanity\nis indeed absolutely valuable. And if it does require this, then,\ncontrary to Kant’s own insistence, the argument of\nGroundwork II does not appear to be merely an\nanalytic argument meant simply to establish the content of the moral\nlaw. \nThe most straightforward interpretation of the claim that the formulas\nare equivalent is as the claim that following or applying each formula\nwould generate all and only the same duties (Allison 2011). This seems\nto be supported by the fact that Kant used the same examples through\nthe Law of Nature Formula and the Humanity Formula. Thus, the\nUniversal Law Formulation generates a duty to φ if and only if the\nHumanity Formula generates a duty to φ, (and so on for the other\nformulations). In other words, respect for humanity as an end in\nitself could never lead you to act on maxims that would generate a\ncontradiction when universalized, and vice versa. This way of\nunderstanding Kant’s claim also fits with his statement that\nthere is no “objective practical difference” between the\nformulations although there are “subjective” differences.\nThe subjective differences between formulas are presumably differences\nthat appeal in different ways to various conceptions of what morality\ndemands of us. But this difference in meaning is compatible with there\nbeing no practical difference, in the sense that conformity to one\nformulation cannot lead one to violate another formulation. \nAt the heart of Kant’s moral theory is the idea of autonomy.\nMost readers interpret Kant as holding that autonomy is a property of\nrational wills or agents. Understanding the idea of autonomy was, in\nKant’s view, key to understanding and justifying the authority\nthat moral requirements have over us. As with Rousseau, whose views\ninfluenced Kant, freedom does not consist in being bound by no law,\nbut by laws that are in some sense of one’s own making. The idea\nof freedom as autonomy thus goes beyond the merely\n“negative” sense of being free from causes on our\nconduct originating outside of ourselves. It contains first and\nforemost the idea of laws made and laid down by oneself, and, in\nvirtue of this, laws that have decisive authority over oneself. \nKant’s basic idea can be grasped intuitively by analogy with the\nidea of political freedom as autonomy (See Reath 1994). Consider how\npolitical freedom in liberal theories is thought to be related to\nlegitimate political authority: A state is free when its citizens are\nbound only by laws in some sense of their own making — created\nand put into effect, say, by vote or by elected representatives. The\nlaws of that state then express the will of the citizens who are bound\nby them. The idea, then, is that the source of legitimate political\nauthority is not external to its citizens, but internal to them,\ninternal to “the will of the people.” It is because the\nbody politic created and enacted these laws for itself that it can be\nbound by them. An autonomous state is thus one in which the authority\nof its laws is in the will of the people in that state, rather than in\nthe will of a people external to that state, as when one state imposes\nlaws on another during occupation or colonization. In the latter case,\nthe laws have no legitimate authority over those citizens. In a\nsimilar fashion, we may think of a person as free when bound only by\nher own will and not by the will of another. Her actions then express\nher own will and not the will of someone or something else. The\nauthority of the principles binding her will is then also not external\nto her will. It comes from the fact that she willed them. So autonomy,\nwhen applied to an individual, ensures that the source of the\nauthority of the principles that bind her is in her own will.\nKant’s view can be seen as the view that the moral law is just\nsuch a principle. Hence, the “moral legitimacy” of the CI\nis grounded in its being an expression of each person’s own\nrational will. It is because each person’s own reason is the\nlegislator and executor of the moral law that it is authoritative for\nher. (For a contrasting interpretation of autonomy that emphasizes the\nintrinsic value of freedom of choice and the instrumental role of\nreason in preserving that value, see Guyer 2007).  \nKant argues that the idea of an autonomous will emerges from a\nconsideration of the idea of a will that is free “in a negative\nsense.” The concept of a rational will is of a will that operates\nby responding to what it takes to be reasons. This is, firstly, the\nconcept of a will that does not operate through the influence of\nfactors outside of this responsiveness to apparent reasons. For a will\nto be free is thus for it to be physically and psychologically unforced\nin its operation. Hence, behaviors that are performed because of\nobsessions or thought disorders are not free in this negative sense.\nBut also, for Kant, a will that operates by being determined through\nthe operation of natural laws, such as those of biology or psychology,\ncannot be thought of as operating by responding to reasons. Hence,\ndetermination by natural laws is conceptually incompatible with being\nfree in a negative sense. \nA crucial move in Kant’s argument is his claim that a rational\nwill cannot act except “under the Idea” of its own freedom\n(G 4:448). The expression “acting under the Idea of\nfreedom” is easy to misunderstand. It does not mean that a\nrational will must believe it is free, since determinists are\nas free as libertarians in Kant’s view. Indeed, Kant goes out of\nhis way in his most famous work, the Critique of Pure Reason,\nto argue that we have no rational basis for believing our\nwills to be free. This would involve, he argues, attributing a\nproperty to our wills that they would have to have as ‘things in\nthemselves’ apart from the causally determined world of\nappearances. Of such things, he insists, we can have no knowledge. For\nmuch the same reason, Kant is not claiming that a rational will cannot\noperate without feeling free. Feelings, even the feeling of\noperating freely or the “looseness” Hume refers to when we\nact, cannot be used in an a priori argument to establish the\nCI, since they are empirical data. \nOne helpful way to understand acting “under the Idea of\nfreedom” is by analogy with acting “under the Idea”\nthat there are purposes in nature: Although there is, according to\nKant, no rational basis for the belief that the natural world is (or\nis not) arranged according to some purpose by a Designer, the actual\npractices of science often require looking for the purpose of this or\nthat chemical, organ, creature, environment, and so on. Thus, one\nengages in these natural sciences by searching for purposes in nature.\nYet when an evolutionary biologist, for instance, looks for the\npurpose of some organ in some creature, she does not after all thereby\nbelieve that the creature was designed that way, for\ninstance, by a Deity. Nor is she having some feeling of\n“designedness” in the creature. To say that she\n“acts under the Idea of” design is to say something about\nthe practice of biology: Practicing biology involves searching for the\npurposes of the parts of living organisms. In much the same way,\nalthough there is no rational justification for the belief that our\nwills are (or are not) free, the actual practice of practical\ndeliberation and decision consists of a search for the right causal\nchain of which to be the origin — consists, that is, seeking to\nbe the first causes of things, wholly and completely through the\nexercise of one’s own will. \nKant says that a will that cannot exercise itself except under the\nIdea of its freedom is free from a practical point of view\n(im practischer Absicht). In saying such wills are free from\na practical point of view, he is saying that in engaging in practical\nendeavors — trying to decide what to do, what to hold oneself\nand others responsible for, and so on — one is justified in\nholding oneself to all of the principles to which one would be\njustified in holding wills that are autonomous free wills. Thus, once\nwe have established the set of prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives that would bind an autonomous free will, we then hold\nourselves to this very same of set prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives. And one is justified in this because rational agency can\nonly operate by seeking to be the first cause of its actions, and\nthese are the prescriptions, and so on, of being a first cause of\naction. Therefore, rational agents are free in a negative sense\ninsofar as any practical matter is at issue. \nCrucially, rational wills that are negatively free must be autonomous,\nor so Kant argues. This is because the will is a kind of\ncause—willing causes action. Kant took from Hume the idea that\ncausation implies universal regularities: if x causes\ny, then there is some universally valid law connecting\nXs to Ys. So, if my will is the cause of my\nφing, then Φing is connected to the sort of willing I engage\nin by some universal law. But it can’t be a natural law, such as\na psychological, physical, chemical or biological law. These laws,\nwhich Kant thought were universal too, govern the movements of my\nbody, the workings of my brain and nervous system and the operation of\nmy environment and its effects on me as a material being. But they\ncannot be the laws governing the operation of my will; that, Kant\nalready argued, is inconsistent with the freedom of my will in a\nnegative sense. So, the will operates according to a universal law,\nthough not one authored by nature, but one of which I am the origin or\nauthor. And that is to say that, in viewing my willing to φ as a\nnegatively free cause of my φing, I must view my will as the\nautonomous cause of my having φed, as causing my having φed by\nway of some law that I, insofar as I am a rational will, laid down for\nmy will.  \nThus, Kant argues, a rational will, insofar as it is rational, is a\nwill conforming itself to those laws valid for any rational will.\nAddressed to imperfectly rational wills, such as our own, this becomes\nan imperative: “Conform your action to a universal non-natural\nlaw.” Kant assumed that there was some connection between this\nformal requirement and the formulation of the CI which enjoins us to\n“Act as though the maxim of your action were to become by your\nwill a universal law of nature.” But, as commentators have long\nnoticed (see, e.g. , Hill, 1989a, 1989b), it is not clear what the\nlink is between the claim that rational autonomous wills conform\nthemselves to whatever universally valid laws require, and the more\nsubstantial and controversial claim that you should evaluate your\nmaxims in the ways implied by the universal law of nature\nformulation. \nKant appeared not to recognize the gap between the law of an\nautonomous rational will and the CI, but he was apparently unsatisfied\nwith the argument establishing the CI in Groundwork III for\nanother reason, namely, the fact that it does not prove that we really\nare free. In the Critique of Practical Reason, he states that\nit is simply a “fact of reason” (Factum der\nVernunft) that our wills are bound by the CI, and he uses this to\nargue that our wills are autonomous. Hence, while in the\nGroundwork Kant relies on a dubious argument for our autonomy\nto establish that we are bound by the moral law, in the second\nCritique, he argues from the bold assertion of our being\nbound by the moral law to our autonomy. \nThe apparent failure of Kant’s argument to establish the\nautonomy of the will, and hence the authority of moral demands over\nus, has not deterred his followers from trying to make good on this\nproject. One strategy favored recently has been to turn back to the\narguments of Groundwork II for help. Kant himself repeatedly\nclaimed that these arguments are merely analytic but that they do not\nestablish that there is anything that answers to the concepts he\nanalyzes. The conclusions are thus fully compatible with morality\nbeing, as he puts it, a “mere phantom of the brain” (G\n4:445). Kant clearly takes himself to have established that rational\nagents such as ourselves must take the means to our ends, since this\nis analytic of rational agency. But there is a chasm between this\nanalytic claim and the supposed synthetic conclusion that rational\nagency also requires conforming to a further, non-desire based,\nprinciple of practical reason such as the CI. Nevertheless, some see\narguments in Groundwork II that establish just this. These\nstrategies involve a new “teleological” reading of\nKant’s ethics that relies on establishing the existence of an\nabsolute value or an “end in itself” (we say more about\nthis teleological reading below). They begin with Kant’s own\nstated assumption that there is such an end in itself if and only if\nthere is a categorical imperative binding on all rational agents as\nsuch. If this assumption is true, then if one can on independent\ngrounds prove that there is something which is an end in itself, one\nwill have an argument for a categorical imperative. One such strategy,\nfavored by Korsgaard (1996) and Wood (1999) relies on the apparent\nargument Kant gives that humanity is an end in itself. Guyer, by\ncontrast, sees an argument for freedom as an end in itself (Guyer\n2000). Both strategies have faced textual and philosophical hurdles.\nConsiderable interpretive finesse, for instance, is required to\nexplain Kant’s stark insistence on the priority of principles\nand law over the good in the second Critique (CPrR\n5:57–67) \nAlthough most of Kant’s readers understand the property of\nautonomy as being a property of rational wills, some, such as Thomas\nE. Hill, have held that Kant’s central idea is that of autonomy\nis a property, not primarily of wills, but of principles. The core\nidea is that Kant believed that all moral theories prior to his own\nwent astray because they portrayed fundamental moral principles as\nappealing to the existing interests of those bound by them. By\ncontrast, in Kant’s view moral principles must not appeal to\nsuch interests, for no interest is necessarily universal. Thus, in\nassuming at the outset that moral principles must embody some interest\n(or “heteronomous” principles), such theories rule out the\nvery possibility that morality is universally binding. By contrast,\nthe Categorical Imperative, because it does not enshrine existing\ninterests, presumes that rational agents can conform to a principle\nthat does not appeal to their interests (or an\n“autonomous” principle), and so can fully ground our\nconception, according to Kant, of what morality requires of us. \nA different interpretive strategy, which has gained prominence in\nrecent years, focuses on Kant’s apparent identification, in\nGroundwork III, of the will and practical reason. One natural\nway of interpreting Kant’s conception of freedom is to\nunderstand it in terms of the freedom and spontaneity of reason\nitself. This in turn apparently implies that our wills are necessarily\naimed at what is rational and reasonable. To will something, on this\npicture, is to govern oneself in accordance with reason. Often,\nhowever, we fail to effectively so govern ourselves because we are\nimperfect rational beings who are caused to act by our\nnon–rational desires and inclinations. The result, at least on\none version of this interpretation (Wolff 1973), is that we either act\nrationally and reasonably (and so autonomously) or we are merely\ncaused to behave in certain ways by non–rational forces acting\non us (and so heteronomously). This is, however, an implausible view.\nIt implies that all irrational acts, and hence all immoral acts, are\nnot willed and therefore not free. Most interpreters have denied that\nthis is the proper interpretation of Kant’s views. However,\nseveral prominent commentators nonetheless think that there is some\ntruth in it (Engstrom 2009; Reath 2015; Korsgaard 1996, 2008, 2009).\nThey agree that we always act under the “guise of the\ngood” in the sense that our will is necessarily aimed at what is\nobjectively and subjectively rational and reasonable, but these\ninterpreters also think that, for Kant, there is a middle–ground\nbetween perfect conformity to reason and being caused to act by\nnatural forces. In particular, when we act immorally, we are either\nweak–willed or we are misusing our practical reason by willing\nbadly. We do not have the capacity to aim to act on an immoral maxim\nbecause the will is identified with practical reason, so when we will\nto perform an immoral act, we implicitly but mistakenly take our\nunderlying policy to be required by reason. By representing our\nimmoral act as rational and reasonable, we are not exercising our\npowers of reason well, so we are simply making a “choice”\nthat is contrary to reason without “willing” it as such.\nOur choice is nonetheless free and attributable to us because our will\nwas involved in leading us to take the act to be rational and\nreasonable. It remains to be seen whether, on this complicated\ninterpretation of Kant, it sufficiently allows for the possibility\nthat one can knowingly and willingly do wrong if the will is practical\nreason and practical reason is, in part, the moral law. \nKant defines virtue as “the moral strength of a human\nbeing’s will in fulfilling his duty” (MM 6:405) and\nvice as principled immorality (MM 6:390). This definition appears to\nput Kant’s views on virtue at odds with classical views such as\nAristotle’s in several important respects. \nFirst, Kant’s account of virtue presupposes an account of moral\nduty already in place. Thus, rather than treating admirable character\ntraits as more basic than the notions of right and wrong conduct, Kant\ntakes virtues to be explicable only in terms of a prior account of\nmoral or dutiful behavior. He does not try to make out what shape a\ngood character has and then draw conclusions about how we ought to act\non that basis. He sets out the principles of moral conduct based on\nhis philosophical account of rational agency, and then on that basis\ndefines virtue as a kind of strength and resolve to act on those\nprinciples despite temptations to the contrary. \nSecond, virtue is, for Kant, strength of will, and hence does not\narise as the result of instilling a “second nature” by a\nprocess of habituating or training ourselves to act and feel in\nparticular ways. It is indeed a disposition, but a disposition of\none’s will, not a disposition of emotions, feelings, desires or\nany other feature of human nature that might be amenable to\nhabituation. Moreover, the disposition is to overcome obstacles to\nmoral behavior that Kant thought were ineradicable features of human\nnature. Thus, virtue appears to be much more like what Aristotle would\nhave thought of as a lesser trait, viz., continence or\nself-control. \nThird, in viewing virtue as a trait grounded in moral principles, and\nvice as principled transgression of moral law, Kant thought of himself\nas thoroughly rejecting what he took to be the Aristotelian view that\nvirtue is a mean between two vices. The Aristotelian view, he claimed,\nassumes that virtue typically differs from vice only in terms of\ndegree rather than in terms of the different principles each involves\n(MM 6:404, 432). Prodigality and avarice, for instance, do not differ\nby being too loose or not loose enough with one’s means. They\ndiffer in that the prodigal person acts on the principle of acquiring\nmeans with the sole intention of enjoyment, while the avaricious\nperson acts on the principle of acquiring means with the sole\nintention of possessing them. \nFourth, in classical views the distinction between moral and non-moral\nvirtues is not particularly significant. A virtue is some sort of\nexcellence of the soul, but one finds classical theorists treating wit\nand friendliness alongside courage and justice. Since Kant holds moral\nvirtue to be a trait grounded in moral principle, the boundary between\nnon-moral and moral virtues could not be more sharp. Even so, Kant\nshows a remarkable interest in non-moral virtues; indeed, much of\nAnthropology is given over to discussing the nature and\nsources of a variety of character traits, both moral and\nnon-moral. \nFifth, virtue cannot be a trait of divine beings, if there are such,\nsince it is the power to overcome obstacles that would not be present\nin them. This is not to say that to be virtuous is to be the victor in\na constant and permanent war with ineradicable evil impulses or\ntemptations. Morality is “duty” for human beings because\nit is possible (and we recognize that it is possible) for our\ndesires and interests to run counter to its demands. Should all of our\ndesires and interests be trained ever so carefully to comport with\nwhat morality actually requires of us, this would not change in the\nleast the fact that morality is still duty for us. For should this\ncome to pass, it would not change the fact that each and every desire\nand interest could have run contrary to the moral law. And it\nis the fact that they can conflict with moral law, not the\nfact that they actually do conflict with it, that makes duty\na constraint, and hence is virtue essentially a trait concerned with\nconstraint. \nSixth, virtue, while important, does not hold pride of place in\nKant’s system in other respects. For instance, he holds that the\nlack of virtue is compatible with possessing a good will (G 6: 408).\nThat one acts from duty, even repeatedly and reliably can thus be\nquite compatible with an absence of the moral strength to overcome\ncontrary interests and desires. Indeed, it may often be no challenge\nat all to do one’s duty from duty alone. Someone with a good\nwill, who is genuinely committed to duty for its own sake, might\nsimply fail to encounter any significant temptation that would reveal\nthe lack of strength to follow through with that commitment. That\nsaid, he also appeared to hold that if an act is to be of genuine\nmoral worth, it must be motivated by the kind of purity of motivation\nachievable only through a permanent, quasi-religious conversion or\n“revolution” in the orientation of the will of the sort\ndescribed in Religion. Until one achieves a permanent change\nin the will’s orientation in this respect, a revolution in which\nmoral righteousness is the nonnegotiable condition of any of\none’s pursuits, all of one’s actions that are in\naccordance with duty are nevertheless morally worthless, no matter\nwhat else may be said of them. However, even this revolution in the\nwill must be followed up with a gradual, lifelong strengthening of\none’s will to put this revolution into practice. This suggests\nthat Kant’s considered view is that a good will is a will in\nwhich this revolution of priorities has been achieved, while a\nvirtuous will is one with the strength to overcome obstacles to its\nmanifestation in practice. \nKant distinguishes between virtue, which is strength of will to do\none’s duty from duty, and particular virtues, which are\ncommitments to particular moral ends that we are morally required to\nadopt. Among the virtues Kant discusses are those of self-respect,\nhonesty, thrift, self-improvement, beneficence, gratitude,\nsociability, and forgiveness. Kant also distinguishes vice, which is a\nsteadfast commitment to immorality, from particular vices, which\ninvolve refusing to adopt specific moral ends or committing to act\nagainst those ends. For example, malice, lust, gluttony, greed,\nlaziness, vengefulness, envy, servility, contempt and arrogance are\nall vices in Kant’s normative ethical theory.  \n(Interest in Kant’s conception of virtue has rapidly grown in\nrecent years. For further discussion, see Cureton and Hill 2014,\nforthcoming; Wood 2008; Surprenant 2014; Sherman 1997; O’Neil\n1996; Johnson 2008; Hill 2012; Herman 1996; Engstrom 2002; Denis 2006;\nCureton forthcoming; Betzler 2008; Baxley 2010). \nThe Categorical Imperative, in Kant’s view, is an objective,\nunconditional and necessary principle of reason that applies to all\nrational agents in all circumstances. Although Kant gives several\nexamples in the Groundwork that illustrate this principle, he\ngoes on to describe in later writings, especially in The\nMetaphysics of Morals, a complicated normative ethical theory for\ninterpreting and applying the CI to human persons in the natural\nworld. His framework includes various levels, distinctions and\napplication procedures. Kant, in particular, describes two subsidiary\nprinciples that are supposed to capture different aspects of the CI.\nThe Universal Principle of Right, which governs issues about justice,\nrights and external acts that can be coercively enforced, holds that\n“Any action is right if it can coexist with\neveryone’s freedom in accordance with a universal law, or if on\nits maxim the freedom of choice of each can coexist with\neveryone’s freedom in accordance with a universal law” (MM\n6:230). The Supreme Principle of the Doctrine of Virtue, which governs\nquestions about moral ends, attitudes, and virtue, requires us to\n“act in accordance with a maxim of ends that it can be\na universal law for everyone to have” (MM 6:395). These\nprinciples, in turn, justify more specific duties of right and of\nethics and virtue. \nIn Kant’s framework, duties of right are narrow and perfect\nbecause they require or forbid particular acts, while duties of ethics\nand virtue are wide and imperfect because they allow significant\nlatitude in how we may decide to fulfill them. For example, Kant\nclaims that the duty not to steal the property of another person is\nnarrow and perfect because it precisely defines a kind of act that is\nforbidden. The duty of beneficence, on the other hand, is\ncharacterized as wide and imperfect because it does not specify\nexactly how much assistance we must provide to others. \nEven with a system of moral duties in place, Kant admits that judgment\nis often required to determine how these duties apply to particular\ncircumstances. Moral laws, Kant says, “must be meticulously\nobserved” but “they cannot, after all, have regard to\nevery little circumstance, and the latter may yield exceptions, which\ndo not always find their exact resolution in the laws” (V\n27:574; see also CPR A133/B172; MM 6:411). \nThe received view is that Kant’s moral philosophy is a\ndeontological normative theory at least to this extent: it denies that\nright and wrong are in some way or other functions of goodness or\nbadness. It denies, in other words, the central claim of teleological\nmoral views. For instance, act consequentialism is one sort of\nteleological theory. It asserts that the right action is that action\nof all the alternatives available to the agent that has the best\noverall outcome. Here, the goodness of the outcome determines the\nrightness of an action. Another sort of teleological theory might\nfocus instead on character traits. “Virtue ethics” asserts\nthat a right action in any given circumstance is that action a\nvirtuous person does or would perform in those circumstances. In this\ncase, it is the goodness of the character of the person who does or\nwould perform it that determines the rightness of an action. In both\ncases, as it were, the source or ground of rightness is goodness. And\nKant’s own views have typically been classified as deontological\nprecisely because they have seemed to reverse this priority and deny\njust what such theories assert. Rightness, on the standard reading of\nKant, is not grounded in the value of outcomes or character. \nThere are several reasons why readers have thought that Kant denies\nthe teleological thesis. First, he makes a plethora of statements\nabout outcomes and character traits that appear to imply an outright\nrejection of both forms of teleology. For instance, in\nGroundwork I, he says that he takes himself to have argued\nthat “the objectives we may have in acting, and also our\nactions’ effects considered as ends and what motivates our\nvolition, can give to actions no unconditional or moral\nworth…[this] can be found nowhere but in the principle of the\nwill, irrespective of the ends that can be brought about by such\naction” (G 4: 400). This appears to say that moral rightness is\nnot a function of the value of intended or actual outcomes. Kant\nsubsequently says that a categorical imperative “declares an\naction to be objectively necessary of itself without reference to any\npurpose—that is, even without any further end” (G 4:415).\nA categorical imperative “commands a certain line of conduct\ndirectly, without assuming or being conditional on any further goal to\nbe reached by that conduct” (G 4:416). These certainly appear to\nbe the words of someone who rejects the idea that what makes actions\nright is primarily their relationship to what good may come of those\nactions, someone who rejects outright the act consequentialist form of\nteleology. Moreover, Kant begins the Groundwork by noting\nthat character traits such as the traditional virtues of courage,\nresolution, moderation, self-control, or a sympathetic cast of mind\npossess no unconditional moral worth, (G 4:393–94,\n398–99). If the moral rightness of an action is grounded in the\nvalue of the character traits of the person who performs or would\nperform it then it seems Kant thinks that it would be grounded in\nsomething of only conditional value. This certainly would not comport\nwell with the virtue ethics form of teleology. \nSecond, there are deeper theoretical claims and arguments of\nKant’s in both the Groundwork and in the second\nCritique that appear to be incompatible with any sort of\nteleological form of ethics. These claims and arguments all stem from\nKant’s insistence that morality is grounded in the autonomy of a\nrational will. For instance, Kant states that “if the will seeks\nthe law that is to determine it anywhere else than in the fitness of\nits maxims for its own giving of universal law…heteronomy\nalways results” (G 4:441). If the law determining right and\nwrong is grounded in either the value of outcomes or the value of the\ncharacter of the agent, it seems it will not be found in the fitness\nof the action’s maxim to be a universal law laid down by the\nagent’s own rational will. And Kant’s most complete\ntreatment of value, the second Critique’s “On the\nConcept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason”, appears to be a\nrelentless attack on any sort of teleological moral theory. “The\nconcept of good and evil” he states, “must not be\ndetermined before the moral law (for which, as it would seem, this\nconcept would have to be made the basis) but only (as was done here)\nafter it and by means of it” (CPrR 5:63). \nA number of Kant’s readers have come to question this received\nview, however. Perhaps the first philosopher to suggest a teleological\nreading of Kant was John Stuart Mill. In the first chapter of his\nUtilitarianism, Mill implies that the Universal Law\nformulation of the Categorical Imperative could only sensibly be\ninterpreted as a test of the consequences of universal adoption of a\nmaxim. Several 20th century theorists have followed Mill’s\nsuggestion, most notably, R. M. Hare. Hare argued that moral judgments\nsuch as “Stealing is wrong” are in fact universal\nprescriptions (“No stealing anywhere by anyone!”). And\nbecause they are universal, Hare argued, they forbid making\nexceptions. That in turn requires moral judgments to give each\nperson’s wellbeing, including our own, equal weight. And when we\ngive each person’s wellbeing equal weight, we are acting to\nproduce the best overall outcome. Thus, in his view, the CI is\n“simply utilitarianism put into other words” (1993, p.\n103). More recently, David Cummiskey (1996) has argued that\nKant’s view that moral principles are justified because they are\nuniversalizable is compatible with those principles themselves being\nconsequentialist. Indeed, Cummiskey argues that they must be: Respect\nfor the value of humanity entails treating the interests of each as\ncounting for one and one only, and hence for always acting to produce\nthe best overall outcome. \nThere are also teleological readings of Kant’s ethics that are\nnon-consequentialist. Barbara Herman (1993) has urged philosophers to\n“leave deontology behind” as an understanding of\nKant’s moral theory on the grounds that the conception of\npractical reason grounding the Categorical Imperative is itself a\nconception of value. Herman’s idea is that Kant never meant to\nsay that no value grounds moral principles. That, she argues, would\nimply that there would be no reason to conform to them. Instead, Kant\nthought the principles of rationality taken together constitute\nrational agency, and rational agency so constituted itself functions\nas a value that justifies moral action (1993, 231). Herman’s\nproposal thus has Kant’s view grounding the rightness of actions\nin rational agency, and then in turn offering rational agency itself\nup as a value. Both Paul Guyer and Allen Wood have offered proposals\nthat differ from Herman’s in content, but agree on the general\nform of teleology that she defends as a reading of Kant. Guyer argues\nthat autonomy itself is the value grounding moral requirements. Moral\nthinking consists in recognizing the priceless value of a rational\nagent’s autonomous will, something in light of whose value it is\nnecessary for any rational agent to modify his behavior (1998,\n22–35). And Wood argues that humanity itself is the grounding\nvalue for Kant. While the second Critique claims that good\nthings owe their value to being the objects of the choices of rational\nagents, they could not, in his view, acquire any value at all if the\nsource of that value, rational agency, itself had no value (1999, 130;\nsee also 157–8). Finally, Rae Langton has argued that if\nKant’s theory is to be thought of as an objectivistic view, we\nmust suppose that the value of humanity and the good will are\nindependent of simply being the objects of our rational choices. If\ntheir value thereby becomes the source of the rightness of our actions\n— say, our actions are right if and because they treat that\nself-standing value in various ways — then her reading too is\nteleological. \nIt is of considerable interest to those who follow Kant to determine\nwhich reading — teleological or deontological — was\nactually Kant’s, as well as which view ought to have been his. A\npowerful argument for the teleological reading is the motivation for\nHerman’s proposal: What rationale can we provide for doing our\nduty at all if we don’t appeal to it’s being good to do\nit? But a powerful argument for the deontological reading is\nKant’s own apparent insistence that the authority of moral\ndemands must come simply from their being the demands of a rational\nwill, quite apart from the value that will may have (see Schneewind\n1996; Johnson 2007, 2008; and Reath 1994). On the latter view, moral\ndemands gain their authority simply because a rational will, insofar\nas you are rational, must will them. Proponents of this reading are\nleft with the burden of answering Herman’s challenge to provide\na rationale for having willed such demands, although one response may\nbe that the very question Herman raises does not make sense because it\nasks, in effect, why it is rational to be rational. On the former\nview, by contrast, a rationale is at hand: because your will is,\ninsofar as it is rational, good. Proponents of this former reading\nare, however, then left with the burden of explaining how it could be\nthe autonomy of the will alone that explains the authority of\nmorality. \nIt has seemed to a number of Kant’s interpreters that it is\nimportant to determine whether Kant’s moral philosophy was\nrealist, anti-realist or something else (e.g. a constructivist). This\nissue is tricky because the terms “realism,”\n“anti-realism” and “constructivism” are terms\nof art.  \nOne relevant issue is whether Kant’s views commit him to the\nthesis that moral judgments are beliefs, and so apt to be evaluated\nfor their truth or falsity (or are “truth apt”). \nOne might have thought that this question is quite easy to settle. At\nthe basis of morality, Kant argued, is the Categorical Imperative, and\nimperatives are not truth apt. It makes little sense to ask whether\n“Leave the gun, take the cannoli.” is true. But, in fact,\nthe question is not at all easy. For one thing, moral judgments such\nas “Lying is wrong” might well be best analyzed according\nto Kant’s views as “The Categorical Imperative commands us\nnot to lie”, and this judgment is not an imperative, but a\nreport about what an imperative commands. Thus while at the foundation\nof morality there would be an imperative which is not truth apt,\nparticular moral judgments themselves would describe what that\nimperative rules out and so would themselves be truth apt. \nPhilosophers such as R.M. Hare, however, have taken Kant’s view\nto be that moral judgments are not truth apt. Although on the surface\nmoral judgments can look as if they describe a moral world, they are,\nas Hare reads Kant, “prescriptions”, not\n“descriptions”. This is not, in his view, to say that\nKant’s ethics portrays moral judgments as lacking objectivity.\nObjectivity, according to Hare, is to be understood as universality,\nand the Categorical Imperative prescribes universally. \nA second issue that has received considerable attention is whether\nKant is a metaethical constructivist or realist. \nConstructivism in metaethics is the view that moral truths are, or are\ndetermined by, the outcomes of actual or hypothetical procedures of\ndeliberation or choice. Many who interpret Kant as a constructivist\nclaim that his analysis of “duty” and “good\nwill” reveals that if there are moral requirements then the\nagents who are bound to them have autonomy of the will (Rawls 1980;\nKorsgaard 1996; O’Neil 1989; Reath 2006; Hill 1989a, 1989b,\n2001; Cureton 2013, 2014; Engstrom 2009). Autonomy, in this sense,\nmeans that such agents are both authors and subjects of the moral law\nand, as such, are not bound by any external requirements that may\nexist outside of our wills. Instead, we are only subject to moral\nrequirements that we impose on ourselves through the operation of our\nown reason independently of our natural desires and inclinations. The\ncommon error of previous ethical theories, including sentimentalism,\negoism and rationalism, is that they failed to recognize that morality\npresupposes that we have autonomy of the will. These theories\nmistakenly held that our only reasons to be moral derive from\nhypothetical imperatives about how to achieve given moral ends that\nexist independently of the activity of reason itself (for a discussion\nof Kant’s more specific objections to previous ethical theories,\nsee Schneewind 2009). On these interpretations, Kant is a skeptic\nabout arbitrary authorities, such as God, natural feelings, intrinsic\nvalues or primitive reasons that exist independently of us. Only\nreason itself has genuine authority over us, so we must exercise our\nshared powers of reasoned deliberation, thought and judgment, guided\nby the Categorical Imperative as the most basic internal norm of\nreason, to construct more specific moral requirements. Kantians in\nthis camp, however, disagree about how this rational procedure should\nbe characterized. \nOther commentators interpret Kant as a robust moral realist (Ameriks\n2003; Wood 1999; Langton 2007; Kain 2004). According to these\nphilosophers, Kant’s theory, properly presented, begins with the\nclaim that rational nature is an objective, agent-neutral and\nintrinsic value. The moral law then specifies how we should regard and\ntreat agents who have this special status. Autonomy of the will, on\nthis view, is a way of considering moral principles that are grounded\nin the objective value of rational nature and whose authority is thus\nindependent of the exercise of our wills or rational capacities. \nSome interpreters of Kant, most notably Korsgaard (1996), seem to\naffirm a kind of quietism about metaethics by rejecting many of the\nassumptions that contemporary metaethical debates rest on. For\nexample, some of these philosophers seem not to want to assert that\nmoral facts and properties just are the outcomes of deliberative\nprocedures. Rather, they seem more eager to reject talk of facts and\nproperties as unnecessary, once a wholly acceptable and defensible\nprocedure is in place for deliberation. That is, the whole framework\nof facts and properties suggests that there is something we need to\nmoor our moral conceptions to “out there” in reality, when\nin fact what we only need a route to decision. Once we are more\nsensitive to the ethical concerns that really matter to us as rational\nagents, we will find that many of the questions that animate\nmetaethicists turn out to be non-questions or of only minor\nimportance. Others have raised doubts, however, about whether Kantians\ncan so easily avoid engaging in metaethical debates (Hussain &\nShaw 2013).","contact.mail":"JohnsonRN@missouri.edu","contact.domain":"missouri.edu"},{"date.published":"2004-02-23","date.changed":"2016-07-07","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/","author1":"Robert Johnson","author1.info":"https://philosophy.utk.edu/staff/cureton.php","entry":"kant-moral","body.text":"\n\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that the supreme principle of\nmorality is a standard of rationality that he dubbed the\n“Categorical Imperative” (CI). Kant characterized the CI\nas an objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle that\nwe must always follow despite any natural desires or inclinations we\nmay have to the contrary.

However,\nthese standards were either instrumental principles of rationality for\nsatisfying one’s desires, as in Hobbes, or external rational\nprinciples that are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and Aquinas.\nKant agreed with many of his predecessors that an analysis of\npractical reason reveals the requirement that rational agents must\nconform to instrumental principles. Yet he also argued that conformity\nto the CI (a non-instrumental principle), and hence to moral\nrequirements themselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential to\nrational agency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine that\na rational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free, in the sense\nof being the author of the law that binds it. The fundamental\nprinciple of morality — the CI — is none other than the\nlaw of an autonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant’s moral\nphilosophy is a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairs\ngoes well beyond that of a Humean ‘slave’ to the passions.\nMoreover, it is the presence of this self-governing reason in each\nperson that Kant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each as\npossessed of equal worth and deserving of equal respect.\n\n\nKant’s most influential positions in moral philosophy are found\nin The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (hereafter,\n“Groundwork”) but he developed, enriched, and in\nsome cases modified those views in later works such as The\nCritique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals,\nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, Religion\nwithin the Boundaries of Mere Reason as well as his essays on\nhistory and related topics. Kant’s Lectures on Ethics,\nwhich were lecture notes taken by three of his students on the courses\nhe gave in moral philosophy, also include relevant material for\nunderstanding his views. We will mainly focus on the foundational\ndoctrines of the Groundwork, even though in recent years some\nscholars have become dissatisfied with this standard approach to\nKant’s views and have turned their attention to the later works.\nWe find the standard approach most illuminating, though we will\nhighlight important positions from the later works where needed.\n\nThe most basic aim of moral philosophy, and so also of the\nGroundwork, is, in Kant’s view, to “seek\nout” the foundational principle of a “metaphysics of\nmorals,” which Kant understands as a system of a priori\nmoral principles that apply the CI to human persons in all times and\ncultures. Kant pursues this project through the first two chapters of\nthe Groundwork. He proceeds by analyzing and elucidating\ncommonsense ideas about morality, including the ideas of a “good\nwill” and “duty”. The point of this first project is\nto come up with a precise statement of the principle or principles on\nwhich all of our ordinary moral judgments are based. The judgments in\nquestion are supposed to be those that any normal, sane, adult human\nbeing would accept on due rational reflection. Nowadays, however, many\nwould regard Kant as being overly optimistic about the depth and\nextent of moral agreement. But perhaps he is best thought of as\ndrawing on a moral viewpoint that is very widely shared and which\ncontains some general judgments that are very deeply held. In any\ncase, he does not appear to take himself to be primarily addressing a\ngenuine moral skeptic such as those who often populate the works of\nmoral philosophers, that is, someone who doubts that she has any\nreason to act morally and whose moral behavior hinges on a rational\nproof that philosophers might try to give. For instance, when, in the\nthird and final chapter of the Groundwork, Kant takes up his\nsecond fundamental aim, to “establish” this foundational\nmoral principle as a demand of each person’s own rational will,\nhis conclusion apparently falls short of answering those who want a\nproof that we really are bound by moral requirements. He rests this\nsecond project on the position that we — or at least creatures\nwith rational wills — possess autonomy. The argument of this\nsecond project does often appear to try to reach out to a metaphysical\nfact about our wills. This has led some readers to the conclusion that\nhe is, after all, trying to justify moral requirements by appealing to\na fact — our autonomy — that even a moral skeptic would\nhave to recognize.  \nKant’s analysis of the common moral concepts of\n“duty” and “good will” led him to believe that\nwe are free and autonomous as long as morality, itself, is not an\nillusion. Yet in the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant also tried\nto show that every event has a cause. Kant recognized that there seems\nto be a deep tension between these two claims: If causal determinism\nis true then, it seems, we cannot have the kind of freedom that\nmorality presupposes, which is “a kind of causality” that\n“can be active, independently of alien causes determining\nit” (G 4:446). \nKant thought that the only way to resolve this apparent conflict is to\ndistinguish between phenomena, which is what we know through\nexperience, and noumena, which we can consistently think but\nnot know through experience. Our knowledge and understanding of the\nempirical world, Kant argued, can only arise within the limits of our\nperceptual and cognitive powers. We should not assume, however, that\nwe know all that may be true about “things in themselves,”\nalthough we lack the “intellectual intuition” that would\nbe needed to learn about such things. \nThese distinctions, according to Kant, allow us to resolve the\n“antinomy” about free will by interpreting the\n“thesis” that free will is possible as about noumena and\nthe “antithesis” that every event has a cause as about\nphenomena. Morality thus presupposes that agents, in an\nincomprehensible “intelligible world,” are able to make\nthings happen by their own free choices in a “sensible\nworld” in which causal determinism is true. \nMany of Kant’s commentators, who are skeptical about these\napparently exorbitant metaphysical claims, have attempted to make\nsense of his discussions of the intelligible and sensible worlds in\nless metaphysically demanding ways. On one interpretation (Hudson\n1994), one and the same act can be described in wholly physical terms\n(as an appearance) and also in irreducibly mental terms (as a thing in\nitself). On this compatibilist picture, all acts are causally\ndetermined, but a free act is one that can be described as determined\nby irreducibly mental causes, and in particular by the causality of\nreason. A second interpretation holds that the intelligible and\nsensible worlds are used as metaphors for two ways of conceiving of\none and the same world (Korsgaard 1996; Allison 1990; Hill 1989a,\n1989b). When we are engaging in scientific or empirical\ninvestigations, we often take up a perspective in which we think of\nthings as subject to natural causation, but when we deliberate, act,\nreason and judge, we often take up a different perspective, in which\nwe think of ourselves and others as agents who are not determined by\nnatural causes. When we take up this latter, practical, standpoint, we\nneed not believe that we or others really are free, in any deep\nmetaphysical sense; we need only operate “under the idea of\nfreedom” (G 4:448). Controversy persists, however, about whether\nKant’s conception of freedom requires a “two worlds”\nor “two perspectives” account of the sensible and\nintelligible worlds (Guyer 1987, 2009; Langton 2001; Kohl 2016;\nWood 1984; Hogan 2009). \nAlthough the two most basic aims Kant saw for moral philosophy are to\nseek out and establish the supreme principle of morality, they are\nnot, in Kant’s view, its only aims. Moral philosophy, for Kant,\nis most fundamentally addressed to the first-person, deliberative\nquestion, “What ought I to do?”, and an answer to that\nquestion requires much more than delivering or justifying the\nfundamental principle of morality. We also need some account, based on\nthis principle, of the nature and extent of the specific moral duties\nthat apply to us. To this end, Kant employs his findings from the\nGroundwork in The Metaphysics of Morals, and offers\na categorization of our basic moral duties to ourselves and others. In\naddition, Kant thought that moral philosophy should characterize and\nexplain the demands that morality makes on human psychology and forms\nof human social interaction. These topics, among others, are addressed\nin central chapters of the second Critique, the\nReligion and again in the Metaphysics of Morals, and\nare perhaps given a sustained treatment in Anthropology from a\nPragmatic Point of View. Further, a satisfying answer to the\nquestion of what one ought to do would have to take into account any\npolitical and religious requirements there are. Each of these\nrequirement turn out to be, indirectly at least, also moral\nobligations for Kant, and are discussed in the Metaphysics of\nMorals and in Religion. Finally, moral philosophy should\nsay something about the ultimate end of human endeavor, the Highest\nGood, and its relationship to the moral life. In the Critique of\nPractical Reason, Kant argued that this Highest Good for humanity\nis complete moral virtue together with complete happiness, the former\nbeing the condition of our deserving the latter. Unfortunately, Kant\nnoted, virtue does not insure wellbeing and may even conflict with it.\nFurther, he thought that there is no real possibility of moral\nperfection in this life and indeed few of us fully deserve the\nhappiness we are lucky enough to enjoy. Reason cannot prove or\ndisprove the existence of Divine Providence, on Kant’s view, nor\nthe immortality of the soul, which seem necessary to rectify these\nthings. Nevertheless, Kant argued, an unlimited amount of time to\nperfect ourselves (immortality) and a commensurate achievement of\nwellbeing (insured by God) are “postulates” required by\nreason when employed in moral matters. \nThroughout his moral works, Kant returns time and again to the\nquestion of the method moral philosophy should employ when pursuing\nthese aims. A basic theme of these discussions is that the fundamental\nphilosophical issues of morality must be addressed a priori,\nthat is, without drawing on observations of human beings and their\nbehavior. Kant’s insistence on an a priori method to\nseek out and establish fundamental moral principles, however, does not\nalways appear to be matched by his own practice. The Metaphysics\nof Morals, for instance, is meant to be based on a\npriori rational principles, but many of the specific duties that\nKant describes, along with some of the arguments he gives in support\nof them, rely on general facts about human beings and our\ncircumstances that are known from experience.  \nIn one sense, it might seem obvious why Kant insists on an a\npriori method. A “metaphysics of morals” would be,\nmore or less, an account of the nature and structure of moral\nrequirements — in effect, a categorization of duties and values.\nSuch a project would address such questions as, What is a\nduty? What kinds of duties are there? What is the\ngood? What kinds of goods are there?, and so on. These appear\nto be metaphysical questions. Any principle used to provide such\ncategorizations appears to be a principle of metaphysics, in a sense,\nbut Kant did not see them as external moral truths that exist\nindependently of rational agents. Moral requirements, instead, are\nrational principles that tell us what we have overriding reason to do.\nMetaphysical principles of this sort are always sought out and\nestablished by a priori methods. \nPerhaps something like this was behind Kant’s thinking. However,\nthe considerations he offers for an a priori method do not\nall obviously draw on this sort of rationale. The following are three\nconsiderations favoring a priori methods that he emphasizes\nrepeatedly. \nThe first is that, as Kant and others have conceived of it, ethics\ninitially requires an analysis of our moral concepts. We must\nunderstand the concepts of a “good will”,\n“obligation”, “duty” and so on, as well as\ntheir logical relationships to one another, before we can determine\nwhether our use of these concepts is justified. Given that the\nanalysis of concepts is an a priori matter, to the degree\nthat ethics consists of such an analysis, ethics is a priori\nas a well. \nOf course, even were we to agree with Kant that ethics should begin\nwith analysis, and that analysis is or should be an entirely a\npriori undertaking, this would not explain why all of\nthe fundamental questions of moral philosophy must be pursued a\npriori. Indeed, one of the most important projects of moral\nphilosophy, for Kant, is to show that we, as rational agents, are\nbound by moral requirements and that fully rational agents would\nnecessarily comply with them. Kant admits that his analytical\narguments for the CI are inadequate on their own because the most they\ncan show is that the CI is the supreme principle of morality if\nthere is such a principle. Kant must therefore address the\npossibility that morality itself is an illusion by showing that the CI\nreally is an unconditional requirement of reason that applies to us.\nEven though Kant thought that this project of\n“establishing” the CI must also be carried out a\npriori, he did not think we could pursue this project simply by\nanalyzing our moral concepts or examining the actual behavior of\nothers. What is needed, instead, is a “synthetic”, but\nstill a priori, kind of argument that starts from ideas of\nfreedom and rational agency and critically examines the nature and\nlimits of these capacities. \nThis is the second reason Kant held that fundamental issues in ethics\nmust be addressed with an a priori method: The ultimate\nsubject matter of ethics is the nature and content of the principles\nthat necessarily determine a rational will. \nFundamental issues in moral philosophy must also be settled a\npriori because of the nature of moral requirements themselves, or\nso Kant thought. This is a third reason he gives for an a priori\nmethod, and it appears to have been of great importance to Kant:\nMoral requirements present themselves as being unconditionally\nnecessary. But an a posteriori method seems ill-suited\nto discovering and establishing what we must do whether we\nfeel like doing it or not; surely such a method could only tell us\nwhat we actually do. So an a posteriori method of\nseeking out and establishing the principle that generates such\nrequirements will not support the presentation of moral\n“oughts” as unconditional necessities. Kant argued that\nempirical observations could only deliver conclusions about, for\ninstance, the relative advantages of moral behavior in various\ncircumstances or how pleasing it might be in our own eyes or the eyes\nof others. Such findings clearly would not support the unconditional\nnecessity of moral requirements. To appeal to a posteriori\nconsiderations would thus result in a tainted conception of moral\nrequirements. It would view them as demands for which compliance is\nnot unconditionally necessary, but rather necessary only if additional\nconsiderations show it to be advantageous, optimific or in some other\nway felicitous. Thus, Kant argued that if moral philosophy is to guard\nagainst undermining the unconditional necessity of obligation in its\nanalysis and defense of moral thought, it must be carried out entirely\na priori. \nKant’s analysis of commonsense ideas begins with the thought\nthat the only thing good without qualification is a “good\nwill”. While the phrases “he’s good hearted”,\n“she’s good natured” and “she means\nwell” are common, “the good will” as Kant thinks of\nit is not the same as any of these ordinary notions. The idea of a\ngood will is closer to the idea of a “good person”, or,\nmore archaically, a “person of good will”. This use of the\nterm “will” early on in analyzing ordinary moral thought\nprefigures later and more technical discussions concerning the nature\nof rational agency. Nevertheless, this idea of a good will is an\nimportant commonsense touchstone to which Kant returns throughout his\nworks. The basic idea, as Kant describes it in the Groundwork, is that\nwhat makes a good person good is his possession of a will that is in a\ncertain way “determined” by, or makes its decisions on the\nbasis of, the moral law. The idea of a good will is supposed to be the\nidea of one who is committed only to make decisions that she holds to\nbe morally worthy and who takes moral considerations in themselves to\nbe conclusive reasons for guiding her behavior. This sort of\ndisposition or character is something we all highly value, Kant\nthought. He believes we value it without limitation or qualification.\nBy this, we believe, he means primarily two things. \nFirst, unlike anything else, there is no conceivable circumstance in\nwhich we regard our own moral goodness as worth forfeiting simply in\norder to obtain some desirable object. By contrast, the value of all\nother desirable qualities, such as courage or cleverness, can be\ndiminished, forgone, or sacrificed under certain circumstances:\nCourage may be laid aside if it requires injustice, and it is better\nnot to be witty if it requires cruelty. There is no implicit\nrestriction or qualification to the effect that a commitment to give\nmoral considerations decisive weight is worth honoring, but\nonly under such and such circumstances. \nSecond, possessing and maintaining a steadfast commitment to moral\nprinciples is the very condition under which anything else is worth\nhaving or pursuing. Intelligence and even pleasure are worth having\nonly on the condition that they do not require giving up one’s\nfundamental moral convictions. The value of a good will thus cannot be\nthat it secures certain valuable ends, whether of our own or of\nothers, since their value is entirely conditional on our possessing\nand maintaining a good will. Indeed, since a good will is good under\nany condition, its goodness must not depend on any particular\nconditions obtaining. Thus, Kant points out that a good will must then\nalso be good in itself and not in virtue of its relationship\nto other things such as the agent’s own happiness, overall\nwelfare or any other effects it may or may not produce A good will\nwould still “shine like a jewel” even if it were\n“completely powerless to carry out its aims” (G\n4:394). \nIn Kant’s terms, a good will is a will whose decisions are\nwholly determined by moral demands or, as he often refers to this, by\nthe Moral Law. Human beings inevitably feel this Law as a constraint\non their natural desires, which is why such Laws, as applied to human\nbeings, are imperatives and duties. A human will in which the Moral\nLaw is decisive is motivated by the thought of duty. A\nholy or divine will, if it exists, though good,\nwould not be good because it is motivated by thoughts of duty because\nsuch a will does not have natural inclinations and so necessarily\nfulfills moral requirements without feeling constrained to do so. It\nis the presence of desires that could operate independently\nof moral demands that makes goodness in human beings a constraint, an\nessential element of the idea of “duty.” So in analyzing\nunqualified goodness as it occurs in imperfectly rational creatures\nsuch as ourselves, we are investigating the idea of being motivated by\nthe thought that we are constrained to act in certain ways that we\nmight not want to simply from the thought that we are morally\nrequired to do so. \nKant confirms this by comparing motivation by duty with other sorts of\nmotives, in particular, with motives of self-interest,\nself-preservation, sympathy and happiness. He argues that a dutiful\naction from any of these motives, however praiseworthy it may be, does\nnot express a good will. Assuming an action has moral worth only if it\nexpresses a good will, such actions have no genuine “moral\nworth.” The conformity of one’s action to duty in such\ncases is only related by accident to morality. For instance, if one is\nmotivated by happiness alone, then had conditions not conspired to\nalign one’s duty with one’s own happiness one would not\nhave done one’s duty. By contrast, were one to supplant any of\nthese motivations with the motive of duty, the morality of the action\nwould then express one’s determination to act dutifully out of\nrespect for the moral law itself. Only then would the action have\nmoral worth. \nKant’s views in this regard have understandably been the subject\nof much controversy. Many object that we do not think better of\nactions done for the sake of duty than actions performed out of\nemotional concern or sympathy for others, especially those things we\ndo for friends and family. Worse, moral worth appears to require not\nonly that one’s actions be motivated by duty, but also that no\nother motives, even love or friendship, cooperate. Yet Kant’s\ndefenders have argued that his point is not that we do not admire or\npraise motivating concerns other than duty, only that from the point\nof view of someone deliberating about what to do, these concerns are\nnot decisive in the way that considerations of moral duty are. What is\ncrucial in actions that express a good will is that in conforming to\nduty a perfectly virtuous person always would, and so ideally we\nshould, recognize and be moved by the thought that our conformity is\nmorally obligatory. The motivational structure of the agent should be\narranged so that she always treats considerations of duty as\nsufficient reasons for conforming to those requirements. In other\nwords, we should have a firm commitment not to perform an action if it\nis morally forbidden and to perform an action if it is morally\nrequired. Having a good will, in this sense, is compatible with having\nfeelings and emotions of various kinds, and even with aiming to\ncultivate some of them in order to counteract desires and inclinations\nthat tempt us to immorality. Controversy persists, however, about\nwhether Kant’s claims about the motive of duty go beyond this\nbasic point (Timmermann 2007; Herman 1993; Wood 1998; Baron 1995).\n \nSuppose for the sake of argument we agree with Kant. We now need to\nknow what distinguishes the principle that lays down our duties from\nthese other motivating principles, and so makes motivation by it the\nsource of unqualified value. \nAccording to Kant, what is singular about motivation by duty is that\nit consists of bare respect for the moral law. What naturally comes to\nmind is this: Duties are rules or laws of some sort combined with some\nsort of felt constraint or incentive on our choices, whether from\nexternal coercion by others or from our own powers of reason. For\ninstance, the bylaws of a club lay down duties for its officers and\nenforce them with sanctions. City and state laws establish the duties\nof citizens and enforce them with coercive legal power. Thus, if we do\nsomething because it is our “civic” duty, or our duty\n“as a boy scout” or “a good American,” our\nmotivation is respect for the code that makes it our duty. Thinking we\nare duty bound is simply respecting, as such, certain laws pertaining\nto us. \nHowever intuitive, this cannot be all of Kant’s meaning. For one\nthing, as with the Jim Crow laws of the old South and the Nuremberg\nlaws of Nazi Germany, the laws to which these types of “actions\nfrom duty” conform may be morally despicable. Respect for such\nlaws could hardly be thought valuable. For another, our motive in\nconforming our actions to civic and other laws is rarely unconditional\nrespect. We also have an eye toward doing our part in maintaining\ncivil or social order, toward punishments or loss of standing and\nreputation in violating such laws, and other outcomes of lawful\nbehavior. Indeed, we respect these laws to the degree, but only to the\ndegree, that they do not violate values, laws or principles we hold\nmore dear. Yet Kant thinks that, in acting from duty, we are not at\nall motivated by a prospective outcome or some other extrinsic feature\nof our conduct except insofar as these are requirements of duty\nitself. We are motivated by the mere conformity of our will to law as\nsuch. \nTo act out of respect for the moral law, in Kant’s view, is to\nbe moved to act by a recognition that the moral law is a supremely\nauthoritative standard that binds us and to experience a kind of\nfeeling, which is akin to awe and fear, when we acknowledge the moral\nlaw as the source of moral requirements. Human persons inevitably have\nrespect for the moral law even though we are not always moved by it\nand even though we do not always comply with the moral standards that\nwe nonetheless recognize as authoritative.  \nKant’s account of the content of moral requirements and the\nnature of moral reasoning is based on his analysis of the unique force\nmoral considerations have as reasons to act. The force of moral\nrequirements as reasons is that we cannot ignore them no matter how\ncircumstances might conspire against any other consideration. Basic\nmoral requirements retain their reason-giving force under any\ncircumstance, they have universal validity. So, whatever else may be\nsaid of basic moral requirements, their content is universal. Only a\nuniversal law could be the content of a requirement that has the\nreason-giving force of morality. This brings Kant to a preliminary\nformulation of the CI: “I ought never to act except in such a\nway that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal\nlaw” (G 4:402). This is the principle which motivates a good\nwill, and which Kant holds to be the fundamental principle of all of\nmorality. \nKant holds that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a\ncategorical imperative. It is an imperative\nbecause it is a command addressed to agents who could follow it but\nmight not (e.g. , “Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.”). It\nis categorical in virtue of applying to us unconditionally,\nor simply because we possesses rational wills, without reference to\nany ends that we might or might not have. It does not, in other words,\napply to us on the condition that we have antecedently adopted some\ngoal for ourselves.  \nThere are “oughts” other than our moral duties, according\nto Kant, but these oughts are distinguished from the moral ought in\nbeing based on a quite different kind of principle, one that is the\nsource of hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative\nis a command that also applies to us in virtue of our having a\nrational will, but not simply in virtue of this. It requires\nus to exercise our wills in a certain way given we have\nantecedently willed an end. A hypothetical imperative is thus a\ncommand in a conditional form. But not any command in this form counts\nas a hypothetical imperative in Kant’s sense. For instance,\n“if you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands!”\nis a conditional command. But the antecedent conditions under which\nthe command “clap your hands” applies to you do not posit\nany end that you will, but consist rather of emotional and cognitive\nstates you may or may not be in. Further, “if you want pastrami,\ntry the corner deli” is also a command in conditional form, but\nstrictly speaking it too fails to be a hypothetical imperative in\nKant’s sense since this command does not apply to us in virtue\nof our willing some end, but only in virtue of our\ndesiring or wanting an end. For Kant, willing an end\ninvolves more than desiring; it requires actively choosing or\ncommitting to the end rather than merely finding oneself with a\npassive desire for it. Further, there is nothing irrational in failing\nto will means to what one desires. An imperative that applied to us in\nvirtue of our desiring some end would thus not be a hypothetical\nimperative of practical rationality in Kant’s\nsense. \nThe condition under which a hypothetical imperative applies to us,\nthen, is that we will some end. Now, for the most part, the ends we\nwill we might not have willed, and some ends that we do not will we\nmight nevertheless have willed. But there is at least conceptual room\nfor the idea of a natural or inclination-based end that we\nmust will. The distinction between ends that we might or\nmight not will and those, if any, we necessarily will as the kinds of\nnatural beings we are, is the basis for his distinction between two\nkinds of hypothetical imperatives. Kant names these\n“problematic” and “assertoric”, based on how\nthe end is willed. If the end is one that we might or might not will\n— that is, it is a merely possible end — the\nimperative is problematic. For instance, “Don’t ever take\nside with anyone against the Family.” is a problematic\nimperative, even if the end posited here is (apparently) one’s\nown continued existence. Almost all non-moral, rational imperatives\nare problematic, since there are virtually no ends that we necessarily\nwill as human beings. \nAs it turns out, the only (non-moral) end that we will, as a matter of\nnatural necessity, is our own happiness. Any imperative that applied\nto us because we will our own happiness would thus be an\nassertoric imperative. Rationality, Kant thinks, can issue no\nimperative if the end is indeterminate, and happiness is an\nindeterminate end. Although we can say for the most part that if one\nis to be happy, one should save for the future, take care of\none’s health and nourish one’s relationships, these fail\nto be genuine commands in the strictest sense and so are instead mere\n“counsels.” Some people are happy without these, and\nwhether you could be happy without them is, although doubtful, an open\nquestion. \nSince Kant presents moral and prudential rational requirements as\nfirst and foremost demands on our wills rather than on external acts,\nmoral and prudential evaluation is first and foremost an evaluation of\nthe will our actions express. Thus, it is not an error of rationality\nto fail to take the necessary means to one’s (willed) ends, nor\nto fail to want to take the means; one only falls foul of\nnon-moral practical reason if one fails to will the means.\nLikewise, while actions, feelings or desires may be the focus of other\nmoral views, for Kant practical irrationality, both moral and\nprudential, focuses mainly on our willing. \nOne recent interpretive dispute (Hill 1973; Schroeder 2009; Rippon\n2014) has been about whether hypothetical imperatives, in Kant’s\nview, have a “wide” or “narrow” scope. That\nis, do such imperatives tell us to take the necessary means to our\nends or give up our ends (wide scope) or do they simply tell us that,\nif we have an end, then take the necessary means to it. \nKant describes the will as operating on the basis of subjective\nvolitional principles he calls “maxims”. Hence, morality\nand other rational requirements are, for the most part, demands that\napply to the maxims that we act on. . The form of a maxim is “I\nwill A in C in order to realize or produce\nE” where “A” is some act type,\n“C” is some type of circumstance, and\n“E” is some type of end to be realized or\nachieved by A in C. Since this is a principle stating only what some\nagent wills, it is subjective. (A principle that\ngoverns any rational will is an objective principle\nof volition, which Kant refers to as a practical law). For anything to\ncount as human willing, it must be based on a maxim to pursue some end\nthrough some means. Hence, in employing a maxim, any human willing\nalready embodies the form of means-end reasoning that calls for\nevaluation in terms of hypothetical imperatives. To that extent at\nleast, then, anything dignified as human willing is subject\nto rational requirements. \nKant’s first formulation of the CI states that you are to\n“act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at\nthe same time will that it become a universal law” (G 4:421).\nO’Neill (1975, 1989) and Rawls (1980, 1989), among others, take\nthis formulation in effect to summarize a decision procedure for moral\nreasoning, and we will follow their basic outline: First, formulate a\nmaxim that enshrines your reason for acting as you propose. Second,\nrecast that maxim as a universal law of nature governing all rational\nagents, and so as holding that all must, by natural law, act as you\nyourself propose to act in these circumstances. Third, consider\nwhether your maxim is even conceivable in a world governed by this law\nof nature. If it is, then, fourth, ask yourself whether you would, or\ncould, rationally will to act on your maxim in such a world.\nIf you could, then your action is morally permissible. \nIf your maxim fails the third step, you have a “perfect”\nduty admitting “of no exception in favor of inclination”\nto refrain from acting on that maxim (G 4:421). If your maxim fails\nthe fourth step, you have an “imperfect” duty requiring\nyou to pursue a policy that can admit of such exceptions. If your\nmaxim passes all four steps, only then is acting on it morally\npermissible. Following Hill (1971), we can understand the difference\nin duties as formal: Perfect duties come in the form “One must\nnever (or always) φ to the fullest extent possible in\nC”, while imperfect duties, since they require us to\nadopt an end, at least require that “One must sometimes and to\nsome extent φ in C.” So, for instance, Kant held\nthat the maxim of committing suicide to avoid future unhappiness did\nnot pass the third step, the contradiction in conception test. Hence,\none is forbidden to act on the maxim of committing suicide to avoid\nunhappiness. By contrast, the maxim of refusing to assist others in\npursuit of their projects passes the contradiction in conception test,\nbut fails the contradiction in the will test at the fourth step.\nHence, we have a duty to sometimes and to some extent aid and assist\nothers. \nKant held that ordinary moral thought recognized moral duties toward\nourselves as well as toward others. Hence, together with the\ndistinction between perfect and imperfect duties, Kant recognized four\ncategories of duties: perfect duties toward ourselves, perfect duties\ntoward others, imperfect duties toward ourselves and imperfect duties\ntoward others. Kant uses four examples in the Groundwork, one\nof each kind of duty, to demonstrate that every kind of duty can be\nderived from the CI, and hence to bolster his case that the CI is\nindeed the fundamental principle of morality. To refrain from suicide\nis a perfect duty toward oneself; to refrain from making promises you\nhave no intention of keeping is a perfect duty toward others; to\ndevelop one’s talents is an imperfect duty toward oneself; and\nto contribute to the happiness of others is an imperfect duty toward\nothers. Again, Kant’s interpreters differ over exactly how to\nreconstruct the derivation of these duties. We will briefly sketch one\nway of doing so for the perfect duty to others to refrain from lying\npromises and the imperfect duty to ourselves to develop talents. \nKant’s example of a perfect duty to others concerns a promise\nyou might consider making but have no intention of keeping in order to\nget needed money. Naturally, being rational requires not contradicting\noneself, but there is no self-contradiction in the maxim “I will\nmake lying promises when it achieves something I want.” An\nimmoral action clearly does not involve a self-contradiction in this\nsense (as would the maxim of finding a married bachelor). Kant’s\nposition is that it is irrational to perform an action if that\naction’s maxim contradicts itself once made into a universal\nlaw of nature. The maxim of lying whenever it gets you what you\nwant generates a contradiction once you try to combine it with the\nuniversalized version that all rational agents must, by a law of\nnature, lie when doing so gets them what they want. \nHere is one way of seeing how this might work: If I conceive of a\nworld in which everyone by nature must try to deceive people any time\nthis will get them what they want, I am conceiving of a world in which\nno practice of giving one’s word could ever arise and, because\nthis is a law of nature, we can assume that it is widely known that no\nsuch practice could exist. So I am conceiving of a world in which\neveryone knows that no practice of giving one’s word exists. My\nmaxim, however, is to make a deceptive promise in order to get needed\nmoney. And it is a necessary means of doing this that a practice of\ntaking the word of others exists, so that someone might take my word\nand I take advantage of their doing so. Thus, in trying to conceive of\nmy maxim in a world in which no one ever takes anyone’s word in\nsuch circumstances, and knows this about one another, I am trying to\nconceive of this: A world in which no practice of giving one’s\nword exists, but also, at the very same time, a world in which just\nsuch a practice does exist, for me to make use of in my maxim. It is a\nworld containing my promise and a world in which there can be no\npromises. Hence, it is inconceivable that I could sincerely act on my\nmaxim in a world in which my maxim is a universal law of nature. Since\nit is inconceivable that these two things could exist together, I am\nforbidden ever to act on the maxim of lying to get money. \nBy contrast with the maxim of the lying promise, we can easily\nconceive of adopting a maxim of refusing to develop any of our talents\nin a world in which that maxim is a universal law of nature. It would\nundoubtedly be a world more primitive than our own, but pursuing such\na policy is still conceivable in it. However, it is not, Kant argues,\npossible to rationally will this maxim in such a world. The argument\nfor why this is so, however, is not obvious, and some of Kant’s\nthinking seems hardly convincing: Insofar as we are rational, he says,\nwe already necessarily will that all of our talents and abilities be\ndeveloped. Hence, although I can conceive of a talentless world, I\ncannot rationally will that it come about, given that I already will,\ninsofar as I am rational, that I develop all of my own. Yet, given\nlimitations on our time, energy and interest, it is difficult to see\nhow full rationality requires us to aim to fully develop literally all\nof our talents. Indeed, it seems to require much less, a judicious\npicking and choosing among one’s abilities. Further, all that is\nrequired to show that I cannot will a talentless world is that,\ninsofar as I am rational, I necessarily will that some\ntalents in me be developed, not the dubious claim that I rationally\nwill that they all be developed. Moreover, suppose\nrationality did require me to aim at developing all of my talents.\nThen, there seems to be no need to go further in the CI procedure to\nshow that refusing to develop talents is immoral. Given that, insofar\nas we are rational, we must will to develop capacities, it is by this\nvery fact irrational not to do so. \nHowever, mere failure to conform to something we rationally will is\nnot yet immorality. Failure to conform to instrumental principles, for\ninstance, is irrational but not always immoral. In order to show that\nthis maxim is categorically forbidden, one strategy is to make use of\nseveral other of Kant’s claims or assumptions. \nFirst, we must accept Kant’s claim that, by “natural\nnecessity,” we will our own happiness as an end (G 4:415). This\nis a claim he uses not only to distinguish assertoric from problematic\nimperatives, but also to argue for the imperfect duty of helping\nothers (G 4:423) He also appears to rely on this claim in each of his\nexamples. Each maxim he is testing appears to have happiness as its\naim. One explanation for this is that, since each person necessarily\nwills her own happiness, maxims in pursuit of this goal will be the\ntypical object of moral evaluation. This, at any rate, is clear in the\ntalents example itself: The forbidden maxim adopted by the\nne’er-do-well is supposed to be “devoting his life solely\nto…enjoyment” (G 4:423) rather than to developing his\ntalents. \nSecond, we must assume, as also seems reasonable, that a necessary\nmeans to achieving (normal) human happiness is not only that we\nourselves develop some talent, but also that others develop some\ncapacities of theirs at some time. For instance, I cannot engage in\nthe normal pursuits that make up my own happiness, such as playing\npiano, writing philosophy or eating delicious meals, unless I have\ndeveloped some talents myself, and, moreover, someone else has made\npianos and written music, taught me writing, harvested foods and\ndeveloped traditions of their preparation. \nFinally, Kant’s examples come on the heels of defending the\nposition that rationality requires conformity to hypothetical\nimperatives. Thus, we should assume that, necessarily, rational agents\nwill the necessary and available means to any ends that they will. And\nonce we add this to the assumptions that we must will our own\nhappiness as an end, and that developed talents are necessary means to\nachieving that end, it follows that we cannot rationally will that a\nworld come about in which it is a law that no one ever develops any of\ntheir natural talents. We cannot do so, because our own happiness is\nthe very end contained in the maxim of giving ourselves over to\npleasure rather than self-development. Since we will the necessary and\navailable means to our ends, we are rationally committed to willing\nthat everyone sometime develop his or her talents. So since we cannot\nwill as a universal law of nature that no one ever develop any talents\n— given that it is inconsistent with what we now see that we\nrationally will — we are forbidden from adopting the maxim of\nrefusing to develop any of our own. \nMost philosophers who find Kant’s views attractive find them so\nbecause of the Humanity Formulation of the CI. This formulation states\nthat we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity, whether\nin ourselves or in others, as a means only but always as an end in\nitself. This is often seen as introducing the idea of\n“respect” for persons, for whatever it is that is\nessential to our humanity. Kant was clearly right that this and the\nother formulations bring the CI “closer to intuition” than\nthe Universal Law formula. Intuitively, there seems something wrong\nwith treating human beings as mere instruments with no value beyond\nthis. But this very intuitiveness can also invite\nmisunderstandings. \nFirst, the Humanity Formula does not rule out using people as means to\nour ends. Clearly this would be an absurd demand, since we apparently\ndo this all the time in morally appropriate ways. Indeed, it is hard\nto imagine any life that is recognizably human without the use of\nothers in pursuit of our goals. The food we eat, the clothes we wear,\nthe chairs we sit on and the computers we type at are gotten only by\nway of talents and abilities that have been developed through the\nexercise of the wills of many people. What the Humanity Formula rules\nout is engaging in this pervasive use of humanity in such a way that\nwe treat it as a mere means to our ends. Thus, the difference\nbetween a horse and a taxi driver is not that we may use one but not\nthe other as a means of transportation. Unlike a horse, the taxi\ndriver’s humanity must at the same time be treated as an end in\nitself. \nSecond, it is not human beings per se but the\n“humanity” in human beings that we must treat as an end in\nitself. Our “humanity” is that collection of features that\nmake us distinctively human, and these include capacities to engage in\nself-directed rational behavior and to adopt and pursue our own ends,\nand any other rational capacities necessarily connected with these.\nThus, supposing that the taxi driver has freely exercised his rational\ncapacities in pursuing his line of work, we make permissible use of\nthese capacities as a means only if we behave in a way that he could,\nwhen exercising his rational capacities, consent to — for\ninstance, by paying an agreed on price. \nThird, the idea of an end has three senses for Kant, two positive\nsenses and a negative sense. An end in the first positive sense is a\nthing we will to produce or bring about in the world. For instance, if\nlosing weight is my end, then losing weight is something I aim to\nbring about. An end in this sense guides my actions in that once I\nwill to produce something, I then deliberate about and aim to pursue\nmeans of producing it if I am rational. Humanity is not an\n“end” in this sense, though even in this case, the end\n“lays down a law” for me. Once I have adopted an end in\nthis sense, it dictates that I do something: I should act in ways that\nwill bring about the end or instead choose to abandon my goal. \nAn end in the negative sense lays down a law for me as well, and so\nguides action, but in a different way. Korsgaard (1996) offers\nself-preservation as an example of an end in a negative sense: We do\nnot try to produce our self-preservation. Rather, the end of\nself-preservation prevents us from engaging in certain kinds of\nactivities, for instance, picking fights with mobsters, and so on.\nThat is, as an end, it is something I do not act against in\npursuing my positive ends, rather than something I produce. \nHumanity is in the first instance an end in this negative sense: It is\nsomething that limits what I may do in pursuit of my other\nends, similar to the way that my end of self-preservation limits what\nI may do in pursuit of other ends. Insofar as it limits my\nactions, it is a source of perfect duties. Now many of our\nends are subjective in that they are not ends that every rational\nbeing must have. Humanity is an objective end, because it is\nan end that every rational being must have. Hence, my own humanity as\nwell as the humanity of others limit what I am morally\npermitted to do when I pursue my other, non-mandatory, ends. \nThe humanity in myself and others is also a positive end,\nthough not in the first positive sense above, as something to be\nproduced by my actions. Rather, it is something to realize, cultivate\nor further by my actions. Becoming a philosopher, pianist or novelist\nmight be my end in this sense. When my end is becoming a pianist, my\nactions do not, or at least not simply, produce something, being a\npianist, but constitute or realize the activity of being a pianist.\nInsofar as the humanity in ourselves must be treated as an end in\nitself in this second positive sense, it must be cultivated,\ndeveloped or fully actualized. Hence, the humanity in oneself is the\nsource of a duty to develop one’s talents or to\n“perfect” one’s humanity. When one makes one’s\nown humanity one’s end, one pursues its development, much as\nwhen one makes becoming a pianist one’s end, one pursues the\ndevelopment of piano playing. And insofar as humanity is a positive\nend in others, I must attempt to further their ends as well. In so\ndoing, I further the humanity in others, by helping further the\nprojects and ends that they have willingly adopted for themselves. It\nis this sense of humanity as an end-in-itself on which some of\nKant’s arguments for imperfect duties rely. \nFinally, Kant’s Humanity Formula requires “respect”\nfor the humanity in persons. Proper regard for something with absolute\nvalue or worth requires respect for it. But this can invite\nmisunderstandings. One way in which we respect persons, termed\n“appraisal respect” by Stephen Darwall (1977), is clearly\nnot the same as the kind of respect required by the Humanity Formula:\nI may respect you as a rebounder but not a scorer, or as a researcher\nbut not as a teacher. When I respect you in this way, I am positively\nappraising you in light of some achievement or virtue you possess\nrelative to some standard of success. If this were the sort of respect\nKant is counseling then clearly it may vary from person to person and\nis surely not what treating something as an end-in-itself requires.\nFor instance, it does not seem to prevent me from regarding\nrationality as an achievement and respecting one person as a rational\nagent in this sense, but not another. And Kant is not telling us to\nignore differences, to pretend that we are blind to them on mindless\negalitarian grounds. However, a distinct way in which we respect\npersons, referred to as “recognition respect” by Darwall,\nbetter captures Kant’s position: I may respect you because you\nare a student, a Dean, a doctor or a mother. In such cases of\nrespecting you because of who or what you are, I am giving the proper\nregard to a certain fact about you, your being a Dean for instance.\nThis sort of respect, unlike appraisal respect, is not a matter of\ndegree based on your having measured up to some standard of\nassessment. Respect for the humanity in persons is more like\nDarwall’s recognition respect. We are to respect human beings\nsimply because they are persons and this requires a certain sort of\nregard. We are not called on to respect them insofar as they have met\nsome standard of evaluation appropriate to persons. And, crucially for\nKant, persons cannot lose their humanity by their misdeeds –\neven the most vicious persons, Kant thought, deserve basic respect as\npersons with humanity. \nThe third formulation of the CI is “the Idea of the will of\nevery rational being as a will that legislates universal\nlaw.” (G 4:432). Although Kant does not state this as an\nimperative, as he does in the other formulations, it is easy enough to\nput it in that form: Act so that through your maxims you could be a\nlegislator of universal laws. This sounds very similar to the first\nformulation. However, in this case we focus on our status as universal\nlaw givers rather than universal law followers. This\nis of course the source of the very dignity of humanity Kant speaks of\nin the second formulation. A rational will that is merely bound by\nuniversal laws could act accordingly from natural and non-moral\nmotives, such as self-interest. But in order to be a legislator of\nuniversal laws, such contingent motives, motives that rational agents\nsuch as ourselves may or may not have, must be set aside. Hence, we\nare required, according to this formulation, to conform our behavior\nto principles that express this autonomy of the rational will —\nits status as a source of the very universal laws that obligate it. As\nwith the Humanity Formula, this new formulation of the CI does not\nchange the outcome, since each is supposed to formulate the very same\nmoral law, and in some sense “unite” the other\nformulations within it. Kant takes each formulation that succeeds the\nfirst in its own way as bringing the moral law “closer to\nfeeling”. The Autonomy Formula presumably does this by putting\non display the source of our dignity and worth, our status as free\nrational agents who are the source of the authority behind the very\nmoral laws that bind us. \nThis formulation has gained favor among Kantians in recent years (see\nRawls, 1971; Hill, 1972). Many see it as introducing more of a social\ndimension to Kantian morality. Kant states that the above concept of\nevery rational will as a will that must regard itself as enacting laws\nbinding all rational wills is closely connected to another concept,\nthat of a “systematic union of different rational beings under\ncommon laws”, or a “Kingdom of Ends” (G 4:433). The\nformulation of the CI states that we must “act in accordance\nwith the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a merely\npossible kingdom of ends” (G 4:439). It combines the others in\nthat (i) it requires that we conform our actions to the laws of an\nideal moral legislature, (ii) that this legislature lays down\nuniversal laws, binding all rational wills including our own, and\n(iii) that those laws are of “a merely possible kingdom”\neach of whose members equally possesses this status as legislator of\nuniversal laws, and hence must be treated always as an end in itself.\nThe intuitive idea behind this formulation is that our fundamental\nmoral obligation is to act only on principles which could earn\nacceptance by a community of fully rational agents each of whom have\nan equal share in legislating these principles for their\ncommunity. \nKant claimed that all of these CI formulas were equivalent.\nUnfortunately, he does not say in what sense. What he says is\nthat these “are basically only so many formulations of precisely\nthe same law, each one of them by itself uniting the other two within\nit,” and that the differences between them are “more\nsubjectively than objectively practical” in the sense that each\naims “to bring an Idea of reason closer to intuition (by means\nof a certain analogy) and thus nearer to feeling” (G 4:435). He\nalso says that one formula “follows from” another (G\n4:431), and that the concept foundational to one formula “leads\nto a closely connected” concept at the basis of another formula\n(G 4:433). Thus, his claim that the formulations are equivalent could\nbe interpreted in a number of ways. \nKant’s statement that each formula “unites the other two\nwithin it” initially suggests that the formulas are equivalent\nin meaning, or at least one could analytically derive one\nformula from another. Some of Kant’s commentators, for example,\nhave argued along the following lines: That I should always treat\nhumanity as an end in itself entails that I should act only on maxims\nthat are consistent with themselves as universal laws of nature\n(O’Neill 1975, 1990; Engstrom 2009; Sensen 2011). There are\nremaining doubts some commentators have, however, about whether this\nstrategy can capture the full meaning of the Humanity Formula or\nexplain all of the duties that Kant claims to derive from it (Wood\n1999, 2007; Cureton 2013). \nPerhaps, then, if the formulas are not equivalent in meaning, they are\nnevertheless logically interderivable and hence equivalent in this\nsense. The universal law formula is not itself derived, as some of\nKant’s interpreters have suggested, from the principle of\nnon-contradiction. That would have the consequence that the CI is a\nlogical truth, and Kant insists that it is not or at least that it is\nnot analytic. Since the CI formulas are not logical truths, then, it\nis possible that they could be logically interderivable. However,\ndespite his claim that each contains the others within it, what we\nfind in the Groundwork seems best interpreted as a derivation\nof each successive formula from the immediately preceding formula.\nThere are, nonetheless, a few places in which it seems that Kant is\ntrying to work in the opposite direction. One is found in his\ndiscussion of the Humanity Formula. There Kant says that only\nsomething “whose existence in itself had an absolute\nworth” could be the ground of a categorically binding law (G\n4:428). He then boldly proclaims that humanity is this absolutely\nvaluable thing, referring to this as a “postulate” that he\nwill argue for in the final chapter of the Groundwork (G\n4:429n). One might take this as expressing Kant’s intention to\nderive thereby the universal law formula from the Humanity Formula:\nIf something is absolutely valuable, then we must\nact only on maxims that can be universal laws. But (he postulates)\nhumanity is absolutely valuable. Thus, we must act only on\nmaxims that can be universal laws. This (we think) anomolous\ndiscussion may well get at some deep sense in which Kant thought the\nformulations were equivalent. Nonetheless, this derivation of the\nuniversal law formulation from the Humanity Formulation seems to\nrequire a substantive, synthetic claim, namely, that humanity\nis indeed absolutely valuable. And if it does require this, then,\ncontrary to Kant’s own insistence, the argument of\nGroundwork II does not appear to be merely an\nanalytic argument meant simply to establish the content of the moral\nlaw. \nThe most straightforward interpretation of the claim that the formulas\nare equivalent is as the claim that following or applying each formula\nwould generate all and only the same duties (Allison 2011). This seems\nto be supported by the fact that Kant used the same examples through\nthe Law of Nature Formula and the Humanity Formula. Thus, the\nUniversal Law Formulation generates a duty to φ if and only if the\nHumanity Formula generates a duty to φ, (and so on for the other\nformulations). In other words, respect for humanity as an end in\nitself could never lead you to act on maxims that would generate a\ncontradiction when universalized, and vice versa. This way of\nunderstanding Kant’s claim also fits with his statement that\nthere is no “objective practical difference” between the\nformulations although there are “subjective” differences.\nThe subjective differences between formulas are presumably differences\nthat appeal in different ways to various conceptions of what morality\ndemands of us. But this difference in meaning is compatible with there\nbeing no practical difference, in the sense that conformity to one\nformulation cannot lead one to violate another formulation. \nAt the heart of Kant’s moral theory is the idea of autonomy.\nMost readers interpret Kant as holding that autonomy is a property of\nrational wills or agents. Understanding the idea of autonomy was, in\nKant’s view, key to understanding and justifying the authority\nthat moral requirements have over us. As with Rousseau, whose views\ninfluenced Kant, freedom does not consist in being bound by no law,\nbut by laws that are in some sense of one’s own making. The idea\nof freedom as autonomy thus goes beyond the merely\n“negative” sense of being free from causes on our\nconduct originating outside of ourselves. It contains first and\nforemost the idea of laws made and laid down by oneself, and, in\nvirtue of this, laws that have decisive authority over oneself. \nKant’s basic idea can be grasped intuitively by analogy with the\nidea of political freedom as autonomy (See Reath 1994). Consider how\npolitical freedom in liberal theories is thought to be related to\nlegitimate political authority: A state is free when its citizens are\nbound only by laws in some sense of their own making — created\nand put into effect, say, by vote or by elected representatives. The\nlaws of that state then express the will of the citizens who are bound\nby them. The idea, then, is that the source of legitimate political\nauthority is not external to its citizens, but internal to them,\ninternal to “the will of the people.” It is because the\nbody politic created and enacted these laws for itself that it can be\nbound by them. An autonomous state is thus one in which the authority\nof its laws is in the will of the people in that state, rather than in\nthe will of a people external to that state, as when one state imposes\nlaws on another during occupation or colonization. In the latter case,\nthe laws have no legitimate authority over those citizens. In a\nsimilar fashion, we may think of a person as free when bound only by\nher own will and not by the will of another. Her actions then express\nher own will and not the will of someone or something else. The\nauthority of the principles binding her will is then also not external\nto her will. It comes from the fact that she willed them. So autonomy,\nwhen applied to an individual, ensures that the source of the\nauthority of the principles that bind her is in her own will.\nKant’s view can be seen as the view that the moral law is just\nsuch a principle. Hence, the “moral legitimacy” of the CI\nis grounded in its being an expression of each person’s own\nrational will. It is because each person’s own reason is the\nlegislator and executor of the moral law that it is authoritative for\nher. (For a contrasting interpretation of autonomy that emphasizes the\nintrinsic value of freedom of choice and the instrumental role of\nreason in preserving that value, see Guyer 2007).  \nKant argues that the idea of an autonomous will emerges from a\nconsideration of the idea of a will that is free “in a negative\nsense.” The concept of a rational will is of a will that operates\nby responding to what it takes to be reasons. This is, firstly, the\nconcept of a will that does not operate through the influence of\nfactors outside of this responsiveness to apparent reasons. For a will\nto be free is thus for it to be physically and psychologically unforced\nin its operation. Hence, behaviors that are performed because of\nobsessions or thought disorders are not free in this negative sense.\nBut also, for Kant, a will that operates by being determined through\nthe operation of natural laws, such as those of biology or psychology,\ncannot be thought of as operating by responding to reasons. Hence,\ndetermination by natural laws is conceptually incompatible with being\nfree in a negative sense. \nA crucial move in Kant’s argument is his claim that a rational\nwill cannot act except “under the Idea” of its own freedom\n(G 4:448). The expression “acting under the Idea of\nfreedom” is easy to misunderstand. It does not mean that a\nrational will must believe it is free, since determinists are\nas free as libertarians in Kant’s view. Indeed, Kant goes out of\nhis way in his most famous work, the Critique of Pure Reason,\nto argue that we have no rational basis for believing our\nwills to be free. This would involve, he argues, attributing a\nproperty to our wills that they would have to have as ‘things in\nthemselves’ apart from the causally determined world of\nappearances. Of such things, he insists, we can have no knowledge. For\nmuch the same reason, Kant is not claiming that a rational will cannot\noperate without feeling free. Feelings, even the feeling of\noperating freely or the “looseness” Hume refers to when we\nact, cannot be used in an a priori argument to establish the\nCI, since they are empirical data. \nOne helpful way to understand acting “under the Idea of\nfreedom” is by analogy with acting “under the Idea”\nthat there are purposes in nature: Although there is, according to\nKant, no rational basis for the belief that the natural world is (or\nis not) arranged according to some purpose by a Designer, the actual\npractices of science often require looking for the purpose of this or\nthat chemical, organ, creature, environment, and so on. Thus, one\nengages in these natural sciences by searching for purposes in nature.\nYet when an evolutionary biologist, for instance, looks for the\npurpose of some organ in some creature, she does not after all thereby\nbelieve that the creature was designed that way, for\ninstance, by a Deity. Nor is she having some feeling of\n“designedness” in the creature. To say that she\n“acts under the Idea of” design is to say something about\nthe practice of biology: Practicing biology involves searching for the\npurposes of the parts of living organisms. In much the same way,\nalthough there is no rational justification for the belief that our\nwills are (or are not) free, the actual practice of practical\ndeliberation and decision consists of a search for the right causal\nchain of which to be the origin — consists, that is, seeking to\nbe the first causes of things, wholly and completely through the\nexercise of one’s own will. \nKant says that a will that cannot exercise itself except under the\nIdea of its freedom is free from a practical point of view\n(im practischer Absicht). In saying such wills are free from\na practical point of view, he is saying that in engaging in practical\nendeavors — trying to decide what to do, what to hold oneself\nand others responsible for, and so on — one is justified in\nholding oneself to all of the principles to which one would be\njustified in holding wills that are autonomous free wills. Thus, once\nwe have established the set of prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives that would bind an autonomous free will, we then hold\nourselves to this very same of set prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives. And one is justified in this because rational agency can\nonly operate by seeking to be the first cause of its actions, and\nthese are the prescriptions, and so on, of being a first cause of\naction. Therefore, rational agents are free in a negative sense\ninsofar as any practical matter is at issue. \nCrucially, rational wills that are negatively free must be autonomous,\nor so Kant argues. This is because the will is a kind of\ncause—willing causes action. Kant took from Hume the idea that\ncausation implies universal regularities: if x causes\ny, then there is some universally valid law connecting\nXs to Ys. So, if my will is the cause of my\nφing, then Φing is connected to the sort of willing I engage\nin by some universal law. But it can’t be a natural law, such as\na psychological, physical, chemical or biological law. These laws,\nwhich Kant thought were universal too, govern the movements of my\nbody, the workings of my brain and nervous system and the operation of\nmy environment and its effects on me as a material being. But they\ncannot be the laws governing the operation of my will; that, Kant\nalready argued, is inconsistent with the freedom of my will in a\nnegative sense. So, the will operates according to a universal law,\nthough not one authored by nature, but one of which I am the origin or\nauthor. And that is to say that, in viewing my willing to φ as a\nnegatively free cause of my φing, I must view my will as the\nautonomous cause of my having φed, as causing my having φed by\nway of some law that I, insofar as I am a rational will, laid down for\nmy will.  \nThus, Kant argues, a rational will, insofar as it is rational, is a\nwill conforming itself to those laws valid for any rational will.\nAddressed to imperfectly rational wills, such as our own, this becomes\nan imperative: “Conform your action to a universal non-natural\nlaw.” Kant assumed that there was some connection between this\nformal requirement and the formulation of the CI which enjoins us to\n“Act as though the maxim of your action were to become by your\nwill a universal law of nature.” But, as commentators have long\nnoticed (see, e.g. , Hill, 1989a, 1989b), it is not clear what the\nlink is between the claim that rational autonomous wills conform\nthemselves to whatever universally valid laws require, and the more\nsubstantial and controversial claim that you should evaluate your\nmaxims in the ways implied by the universal law of nature\nformulation. \nKant appeared not to recognize the gap between the law of an\nautonomous rational will and the CI, but he was apparently unsatisfied\nwith the argument establishing the CI in Groundwork III for\nanother reason, namely, the fact that it does not prove that we really\nare free. In the Critique of Practical Reason, he states that\nit is simply a “fact of reason” (Factum der\nVernunft) that our wills are bound by the CI, and he uses this to\nargue that our wills are autonomous. Hence, while in the\nGroundwork Kant relies on a dubious argument for our autonomy\nto establish that we are bound by the moral law, in the second\nCritique, he argues from the bold assertion of our being\nbound by the moral law to our autonomy. \nThe apparent failure of Kant’s argument to establish the\nautonomy of the will, and hence the authority of moral demands over\nus, has not deterred his followers from trying to make good on this\nproject. One strategy favored recently has been to turn back to the\narguments of Groundwork II for help. Kant himself repeatedly\nclaimed that these arguments are merely analytic but that they do not\nestablish that there is anything that answers to the concepts he\nanalyzes. The conclusions are thus fully compatible with morality\nbeing, as he puts it, a “mere phantom of the brain” (G\n4:445). Kant clearly takes himself to have established that rational\nagents such as ourselves must take the means to our ends, since this\nis analytic of rational agency. But there is a chasm between this\nanalytic claim and the supposed synthetic conclusion that rational\nagency also requires conforming to a further, non-desire based,\nprinciple of practical reason such as the CI. Nevertheless, some see\narguments in Groundwork II that establish just this. These\nstrategies involve a new “teleological” reading of\nKant’s ethics that relies on establishing the existence of an\nabsolute value or an “end in itself” (we say more about\nthis teleological reading below). They begin with Kant’s own\nstated assumption that there is such an end in itself if and only if\nthere is a categorical imperative binding on all rational agents as\nsuch. If this assumption is true, then if one can on independent\ngrounds prove that there is something which is an end in itself, one\nwill have an argument for a categorical imperative. One such strategy,\nfavored by Korsgaard (1996) and Wood (1999) relies on the apparent\nargument Kant gives that humanity is an end in itself. Guyer, by\ncontrast, sees an argument for freedom as an end in itself (Guyer\n2000). Both strategies have faced textual and philosophical hurdles.\nConsiderable interpretive finesse, for instance, is required to\nexplain Kant’s stark insistence on the priority of principles\nand law over the good in the second Critique (CPrR\n5:57–67) \nAlthough most of Kant’s readers understand the property of\nautonomy as being a property of rational wills, some, such as Thomas\nE. Hill, have held that Kant’s central idea is that of autonomy\nis a property, not primarily of wills, but of principles. The core\nidea is that Kant believed that all moral theories prior to his own\nwent astray because they portrayed fundamental moral principles as\nappealing to the existing interests of those bound by them. By\ncontrast, in Kant’s view moral principles must not appeal to\nsuch interests, for no interest is necessarily universal. Thus, in\nassuming at the outset that moral principles must embody some interest\n(or “heteronomous” principles), such theories rule out the\nvery possibility that morality is universally binding. By contrast,\nthe Categorical Imperative, because it does not enshrine existing\ninterests, presumes that rational agents can conform to a principle\nthat does not appeal to their interests (or an\n“autonomous” principle), and so can fully ground our\nconception, according to Kant, of what morality requires of us. \nA different interpretive strategy, which has gained prominence in\nrecent years, focuses on Kant’s apparent identification, in\nGroundwork III, of the will and practical reason. One natural\nway of interpreting Kant’s conception of freedom is to\nunderstand it in terms of the freedom and spontaneity of reason\nitself. This in turn apparently implies that our wills are necessarily\naimed at what is rational and reasonable. To will something, on this\npicture, is to govern oneself in accordance with reason. Often,\nhowever, we fail to effectively so govern ourselves because we are\nimperfect rational beings who are caused to act by our\nnon–rational desires and inclinations. The result, at least on\none version of this interpretation (Wolff 1973), is that we either act\nrationally and reasonably (and so autonomously) or we are merely\ncaused to behave in certain ways by non–rational forces acting\non us (and so heteronomously). This is, however, an implausible view.\nIt implies that all irrational acts, and hence all immoral acts, are\nnot willed and therefore not free. Most interpreters have denied that\nthis is the proper interpretation of Kant’s views. However,\nseveral prominent commentators nonetheless think that there is some\ntruth in it (Engstrom 2009; Reath 2015; Korsgaard 1996, 2008, 2009).\nThey agree that we always act under the “guise of the\ngood” in the sense that our will is necessarily aimed at what is\nobjectively and subjectively rational and reasonable, but these\ninterpreters also think that, for Kant, there is a middle–ground\nbetween perfect conformity to reason and being caused to act by\nnatural forces. In particular, when we act immorally, we are either\nweak–willed or we are misusing our practical reason by willing\nbadly. We do not have the capacity to aim to act on an immoral maxim\nbecause the will is identified with practical reason, so when we will\nto perform an immoral act, we implicitly but mistakenly take our\nunderlying policy to be required by reason. By representing our\nimmoral act as rational and reasonable, we are not exercising our\npowers of reason well, so we are simply making a “choice”\nthat is contrary to reason without “willing” it as such.\nOur choice is nonetheless free and attributable to us because our will\nwas involved in leading us to take the act to be rational and\nreasonable. It remains to be seen whether, on this complicated\ninterpretation of Kant, it sufficiently allows for the possibility\nthat one can knowingly and willingly do wrong if the will is practical\nreason and practical reason is, in part, the moral law. \nKant defines virtue as “the moral strength of a human\nbeing’s will in fulfilling his duty” (MM 6:405) and\nvice as principled immorality (MM 6:390). This definition appears to\nput Kant’s views on virtue at odds with classical views such as\nAristotle’s in several important respects. \nFirst, Kant’s account of virtue presupposes an account of moral\nduty already in place. Thus, rather than treating admirable character\ntraits as more basic than the notions of right and wrong conduct, Kant\ntakes virtues to be explicable only in terms of a prior account of\nmoral or dutiful behavior. He does not try to make out what shape a\ngood character has and then draw conclusions about how we ought to act\non that basis. He sets out the principles of moral conduct based on\nhis philosophical account of rational agency, and then on that basis\ndefines virtue as a kind of strength and resolve to act on those\nprinciples despite temptations to the contrary. \nSecond, virtue is, for Kant, strength of will, and hence does not\narise as the result of instilling a “second nature” by a\nprocess of habituating or training ourselves to act and feel in\nparticular ways. It is indeed a disposition, but a disposition of\none’s will, not a disposition of emotions, feelings, desires or\nany other feature of human nature that might be amenable to\nhabituation. Moreover, the disposition is to overcome obstacles to\nmoral behavior that Kant thought were ineradicable features of human\nnature. Thus, virtue appears to be much more like what Aristotle would\nhave thought of as a lesser trait, viz., continence or\nself-control. \nThird, in viewing virtue as a trait grounded in moral principles, and\nvice as principled transgression of moral law, Kant thought of himself\nas thoroughly rejecting what he took to be the Aristotelian view that\nvirtue is a mean between two vices. The Aristotelian view, he claimed,\nassumes that virtue typically differs from vice only in terms of\ndegree rather than in terms of the different principles each involves\n(MM 6:404, 432). Prodigality and avarice, for instance, do not differ\nby being too loose or not loose enough with one’s means. They\ndiffer in that the prodigal person acts on the principle of acquiring\nmeans with the sole intention of enjoyment, while the avaricious\nperson acts on the principle of acquiring means with the sole\nintention of possessing them. \nFourth, in classical views the distinction between moral and non-moral\nvirtues is not particularly significant. A virtue is some sort of\nexcellence of the soul, but one finds classical theorists treating wit\nand friendliness alongside courage and justice. Since Kant holds moral\nvirtue to be a trait grounded in moral principle, the boundary between\nnon-moral and moral virtues could not be more sharp. Even so, Kant\nshows a remarkable interest in non-moral virtues; indeed, much of\nAnthropology is given over to discussing the nature and\nsources of a variety of character traits, both moral and\nnon-moral. \nFifth, virtue cannot be a trait of divine beings, if there are such,\nsince it is the power to overcome obstacles that would not be present\nin them. This is not to say that to be virtuous is to be the victor in\na constant and permanent war with ineradicable evil impulses or\ntemptations. Morality is “duty” for human beings because\nit is possible (and we recognize that it is possible) for our\ndesires and interests to run counter to its demands. Should all of our\ndesires and interests be trained ever so carefully to comport with\nwhat morality actually requires of us, this would not change in the\nleast the fact that morality is still duty for us. For should this\ncome to pass, it would not change the fact that each and every desire\nand interest could have run contrary to the moral law. And it\nis the fact that they can conflict with moral law, not the\nfact that they actually do conflict with it, that makes duty\na constraint, and hence is virtue essentially a trait concerned with\nconstraint. \nSixth, virtue, while important, does not hold pride of place in\nKant’s system in other respects. For instance, he holds that the\nlack of virtue is compatible with possessing a good will (G 6: 408).\nThat one acts from duty, even repeatedly and reliably can thus be\nquite compatible with an absence of the moral strength to overcome\ncontrary interests and desires. Indeed, it may often be no challenge\nat all to do one’s duty from duty alone. Someone with a good\nwill, who is genuinely committed to duty for its own sake, might\nsimply fail to encounter any significant temptation that would reveal\nthe lack of strength to follow through with that commitment. That\nsaid, he also appeared to hold that if an act is to be of genuine\nmoral worth, it must be motivated by the kind of purity of motivation\nachievable only through a permanent, quasi-religious conversion or\n“revolution” in the orientation of the will of the sort\ndescribed in Religion. Until one achieves a permanent change\nin the will’s orientation in this respect, a revolution in which\nmoral righteousness is the nonnegotiable condition of any of\none’s pursuits, all of one’s actions that are in\naccordance with duty are nevertheless morally worthless, no matter\nwhat else may be said of them. However, even this revolution in the\nwill must be followed up with a gradual, lifelong strengthening of\none’s will to put this revolution into practice. This suggests\nthat Kant’s considered view is that a good will is a will in\nwhich this revolution of priorities has been achieved, while a\nvirtuous will is one with the strength to overcome obstacles to its\nmanifestation in practice. \nKant distinguishes between virtue, which is strength of will to do\none’s duty from duty, and particular virtues, which are\ncommitments to particular moral ends that we are morally required to\nadopt. Among the virtues Kant discusses are those of self-respect,\nhonesty, thrift, self-improvement, beneficence, gratitude,\nsociability, and forgiveness. Kant also distinguishes vice, which is a\nsteadfast commitment to immorality, from particular vices, which\ninvolve refusing to adopt specific moral ends or committing to act\nagainst those ends. For example, malice, lust, gluttony, greed,\nlaziness, vengefulness, envy, servility, contempt and arrogance are\nall vices in Kant’s normative ethical theory.  \n(Interest in Kant’s conception of virtue has rapidly grown in\nrecent years. For further discussion, see Cureton and Hill 2014,\nforthcoming; Wood 2008; Surprenant 2014; Sherman 1997; O’Neil\n1996; Johnson 2008; Hill 2012; Herman 1996; Engstrom 2002; Denis 2006;\nCureton forthcoming; Betzler 2008; Baxley 2010). \nThe Categorical Imperative, in Kant’s view, is an objective,\nunconditional and necessary principle of reason that applies to all\nrational agents in all circumstances. Although Kant gives several\nexamples in the Groundwork that illustrate this principle, he\ngoes on to describe in later writings, especially in The\nMetaphysics of Morals, a complicated normative ethical theory for\ninterpreting and applying the CI to human persons in the natural\nworld. His framework includes various levels, distinctions and\napplication procedures. Kant, in particular, describes two subsidiary\nprinciples that are supposed to capture different aspects of the CI.\nThe Universal Principle of Right, which governs issues about justice,\nrights and external acts that can be coercively enforced, holds that\n“Any action is right if it can coexist with\neveryone’s freedom in accordance with a universal law, or if on\nits maxim the freedom of choice of each can coexist with\neveryone’s freedom in accordance with a universal law” (MM\n6:230). The Supreme Principle of the Doctrine of Virtue, which governs\nquestions about moral ends, attitudes, and virtue, requires us to\n“act in accordance with a maxim of ends that it can be\na universal law for everyone to have” (MM 6:395). These\nprinciples, in turn, justify more specific duties of right and of\nethics and virtue. \nIn Kant’s framework, duties of right are narrow and perfect\nbecause they require or forbid particular acts, while duties of ethics\nand virtue are wide and imperfect because they allow significant\nlatitude in how we may decide to fulfill them. For example, Kant\nclaims that the duty not to steal the property of another person is\nnarrow and perfect because it precisely defines a kind of act that is\nforbidden. The duty of beneficence, on the other hand, is\ncharacterized as wide and imperfect because it does not specify\nexactly how much assistance we must provide to others. \nEven with a system of moral duties in place, Kant admits that judgment\nis often required to determine how these duties apply to particular\ncircumstances. Moral laws, Kant says, “must be meticulously\nobserved” but “they cannot, after all, have regard to\nevery little circumstance, and the latter may yield exceptions, which\ndo not always find their exact resolution in the laws” (V\n27:574; see also CPR A133/B172; MM 6:411). \nThe received view is that Kant’s moral philosophy is a\ndeontological normative theory at least to this extent: it denies that\nright and wrong are in some way or other functions of goodness or\nbadness. It denies, in other words, the central claim of teleological\nmoral views. For instance, act consequentialism is one sort of\nteleological theory. It asserts that the right action is that action\nof all the alternatives available to the agent that has the best\noverall outcome. Here, the goodness of the outcome determines the\nrightness of an action. Another sort of teleological theory might\nfocus instead on character traits. “Virtue ethics” asserts\nthat a right action in any given circumstance is that action a\nvirtuous person does or would perform in those circumstances. In this\ncase, it is the goodness of the character of the person who does or\nwould perform it that determines the rightness of an action. In both\ncases, as it were, the source or ground of rightness is goodness. And\nKant’s own views have typically been classified as deontological\nprecisely because they have seemed to reverse this priority and deny\njust what such theories assert. Rightness, on the standard reading of\nKant, is not grounded in the value of outcomes or character. \nThere are several reasons why readers have thought that Kant denies\nthe teleological thesis. First, he makes a plethora of statements\nabout outcomes and character traits that appear to imply an outright\nrejection of both forms of teleology. For instance, in\nGroundwork I, he says that he takes himself to have argued\nthat “the objectives we may have in acting, and also our\nactions’ effects considered as ends and what motivates our\nvolition, can give to actions no unconditional or moral\nworth…[this] can be found nowhere but in the principle of the\nwill, irrespective of the ends that can be brought about by such\naction” (G 4: 400). This appears to say that moral rightness is\nnot a function of the value of intended or actual outcomes. Kant\nsubsequently says that a categorical imperative “declares an\naction to be objectively necessary of itself without reference to any\npurpose—that is, even without any further end” (G 4:415).\nA categorical imperative “commands a certain line of conduct\ndirectly, without assuming or being conditional on any further goal to\nbe reached by that conduct” (G 4:416). These certainly appear to\nbe the words of someone who rejects the idea that what makes actions\nright is primarily their relationship to what good may come of those\nactions, someone who rejects outright the act consequentialist form of\nteleology. Moreover, Kant begins the Groundwork by noting\nthat character traits such as the traditional virtues of courage,\nresolution, moderation, self-control, or a sympathetic cast of mind\npossess no unconditional moral worth, (G 4:393–94,\n398–99). If the moral rightness of an action is grounded in the\nvalue of the character traits of the person who performs or would\nperform it then it seems Kant thinks that it would be grounded in\nsomething of only conditional value. This certainly would not comport\nwell with the virtue ethics form of teleology. \nSecond, there are deeper theoretical claims and arguments of\nKant’s in both the Groundwork and in the second\nCritique that appear to be incompatible with any sort of\nteleological form of ethics. These claims and arguments all stem from\nKant’s insistence that morality is grounded in the autonomy of a\nrational will. For instance, Kant states that “if the will seeks\nthe law that is to determine it anywhere else than in the fitness of\nits maxims for its own giving of universal law…heteronomy\nalways results” (G 4:441). If the law determining right and\nwrong is grounded in either the value of outcomes or the value of the\ncharacter of the agent, it seems it will not be found in the fitness\nof the action’s maxim to be a universal law laid down by the\nagent’s own rational will. And Kant’s most complete\ntreatment of value, the second Critique’s “On the\nConcept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason”, appears to be a\nrelentless attack on any sort of teleological moral theory. “The\nconcept of good and evil” he states, “must not be\ndetermined before the moral law (for which, as it would seem, this\nconcept would have to be made the basis) but only (as was done here)\nafter it and by means of it” (CPrR 5:63). \nA number of Kant’s readers have come to question this received\nview, however. Perhaps the first philosopher to suggest a teleological\nreading of Kant was John Stuart Mill. In the first chapter of his\nUtilitarianism, Mill implies that the Universal Law\nformulation of the Categorical Imperative could only sensibly be\ninterpreted as a test of the consequences of universal adoption of a\nmaxim. Several 20th century theorists have followed Mill’s\nsuggestion, most notably, R. M. Hare. Hare argued that moral judgments\nsuch as “Stealing is wrong” are in fact universal\nprescriptions (“No stealing anywhere by anyone!”). And\nbecause they are universal, Hare argued, they forbid making\nexceptions. That in turn requires moral judgments to give each\nperson’s wellbeing, including our own, equal weight. And when we\ngive each person’s wellbeing equal weight, we are acting to\nproduce the best overall outcome. Thus, in his view, the CI is\n“simply utilitarianism put into other words” (1993, p.\n103). More recently, David Cummiskey (1996) has argued that\nKant’s view that moral principles are justified because they are\nuniversalizable is compatible with those principles themselves being\nconsequentialist. Indeed, Cummiskey argues that they must be: Respect\nfor the value of humanity entails treating the interests of each as\ncounting for one and one only, and hence for always acting to produce\nthe best overall outcome. \nThere are also teleological readings of Kant’s ethics that are\nnon-consequentialist. Barbara Herman (1993) has urged philosophers to\n“leave deontology behind” as an understanding of\nKant’s moral theory on the grounds that the conception of\npractical reason grounding the Categorical Imperative is itself a\nconception of value. Herman’s idea is that Kant never meant to\nsay that no value grounds moral principles. That, she argues, would\nimply that there would be no reason to conform to them. Instead, Kant\nthought the principles of rationality taken together constitute\nrational agency, and rational agency so constituted itself functions\nas a value that justifies moral action (1993, 231). Herman’s\nproposal thus has Kant’s view grounding the rightness of actions\nin rational agency, and then in turn offering rational agency itself\nup as a value. Both Paul Guyer and Allen Wood have offered proposals\nthat differ from Herman’s in content, but agree on the general\nform of teleology that she defends as a reading of Kant. Guyer argues\nthat autonomy itself is the value grounding moral requirements. Moral\nthinking consists in recognizing the priceless value of a rational\nagent’s autonomous will, something in light of whose value it is\nnecessary for any rational agent to modify his behavior (1998,\n22–35). And Wood argues that humanity itself is the grounding\nvalue for Kant. While the second Critique claims that good\nthings owe their value to being the objects of the choices of rational\nagents, they could not, in his view, acquire any value at all if the\nsource of that value, rational agency, itself had no value (1999, 130;\nsee also 157–8). Finally, Rae Langton has argued that if\nKant’s theory is to be thought of as an objectivistic view, we\nmust suppose that the value of humanity and the good will are\nindependent of simply being the objects of our rational choices. If\ntheir value thereby becomes the source of the rightness of our actions\n— say, our actions are right if and because they treat that\nself-standing value in various ways — then her reading too is\nteleological. \nIt is of considerable interest to those who follow Kant to determine\nwhich reading — teleological or deontological — was\nactually Kant’s, as well as which view ought to have been his. A\npowerful argument for the teleological reading is the motivation for\nHerman’s proposal: What rationale can we provide for doing our\nduty at all if we don’t appeal to it’s being good to do\nit? But a powerful argument for the deontological reading is\nKant’s own apparent insistence that the authority of moral\ndemands must come simply from their being the demands of a rational\nwill, quite apart from the value that will may have (see Schneewind\n1996; Johnson 2007, 2008; and Reath 1994). On the latter view, moral\ndemands gain their authority simply because a rational will, insofar\nas you are rational, must will them. Proponents of this reading are\nleft with the burden of answering Herman’s challenge to provide\na rationale for having willed such demands, although one response may\nbe that the very question Herman raises does not make sense because it\nasks, in effect, why it is rational to be rational. On the former\nview, by contrast, a rationale is at hand: because your will is,\ninsofar as it is rational, good. Proponents of this former reading\nare, however, then left with the burden of explaining how it could be\nthe autonomy of the will alone that explains the authority of\nmorality. \nIt has seemed to a number of Kant’s interpreters that it is\nimportant to determine whether Kant’s moral philosophy was\nrealist, anti-realist or something else (e.g. a constructivist). This\nissue is tricky because the terms “realism,”\n“anti-realism” and “constructivism” are terms\nof art.  \nOne relevant issue is whether Kant’s views commit him to the\nthesis that moral judgments are beliefs, and so apt to be evaluated\nfor their truth or falsity (or are “truth apt”). \nOne might have thought that this question is quite easy to settle. At\nthe basis of morality, Kant argued, is the Categorical Imperative, and\nimperatives are not truth apt. It makes little sense to ask whether\n“Leave the gun, take the cannoli.” is true. But, in fact,\nthe question is not at all easy. For one thing, moral judgments such\nas “Lying is wrong” might well be best analyzed according\nto Kant’s views as “The Categorical Imperative commands us\nnot to lie”, and this judgment is not an imperative, but a\nreport about what an imperative commands. Thus while at the foundation\nof morality there would be an imperative which is not truth apt,\nparticular moral judgments themselves would describe what that\nimperative rules out and so would themselves be truth apt. \nPhilosophers such as R.M. Hare, however, have taken Kant’s view\nto be that moral judgments are not truth apt. Although on the surface\nmoral judgments can look as if they describe a moral world, they are,\nas Hare reads Kant, “prescriptions”, not\n“descriptions”. This is not, in his view, to say that\nKant’s ethics portrays moral judgments as lacking objectivity.\nObjectivity, according to Hare, is to be understood as universality,\nand the Categorical Imperative prescribes universally. \nA second issue that has received considerable attention is whether\nKant is a metaethical constructivist or realist. \nConstructivism in metaethics is the view that moral truths are, or are\ndetermined by, the outcomes of actual or hypothetical procedures of\ndeliberation or choice. Many who interpret Kant as a constructivist\nclaim that his analysis of “duty” and “good\nwill” reveals that if there are moral requirements then the\nagents who are bound to them have autonomy of the will (Rawls 1980;\nKorsgaard 1996; O’Neil 1989; Reath 2006; Hill 1989a, 1989b,\n2001; Cureton 2013, 2014; Engstrom 2009). Autonomy, in this sense,\nmeans that such agents are both authors and subjects of the moral law\nand, as such, are not bound by any external requirements that may\nexist outside of our wills. Instead, we are only subject to moral\nrequirements that we impose on ourselves through the operation of our\nown reason independently of our natural desires and inclinations. The\ncommon error of previous ethical theories, including sentimentalism,\negoism and rationalism, is that they failed to recognize that morality\npresupposes that we have autonomy of the will. These theories\nmistakenly held that our only reasons to be moral derive from\nhypothetical imperatives about how to achieve given moral ends that\nexist independently of the activity of reason itself (for a discussion\nof Kant’s more specific objections to previous ethical theories,\nsee Schneewind 2009). On these interpretations, Kant is a skeptic\nabout arbitrary authorities, such as God, natural feelings, intrinsic\nvalues or primitive reasons that exist independently of us. Only\nreason itself has genuine authority over us, so we must exercise our\nshared powers of reasoned deliberation, thought and judgment, guided\nby the Categorical Imperative as the most basic internal norm of\nreason, to construct more specific moral requirements. Kantians in\nthis camp, however, disagree about how this rational procedure should\nbe characterized. \nOther commentators interpret Kant as a robust moral realist (Ameriks\n2003; Wood 1999; Langton 2007; Kain 2004). According to these\nphilosophers, Kant’s theory, properly presented, begins with the\nclaim that rational nature is an objective, agent-neutral and\nintrinsic value. The moral law then specifies how we should regard and\ntreat agents who have this special status. Autonomy of the will, on\nthis view, is a way of considering moral principles that are grounded\nin the objective value of rational nature and whose authority is thus\nindependent of the exercise of our wills or rational capacities. \nSome interpreters of Kant, most notably Korsgaard (1996), seem to\naffirm a kind of quietism about metaethics by rejecting many of the\nassumptions that contemporary metaethical debates rest on. For\nexample, some of these philosophers seem not to want to assert that\nmoral facts and properties just are the outcomes of deliberative\nprocedures. Rather, they seem more eager to reject talk of facts and\nproperties as unnecessary, once a wholly acceptable and defensible\nprocedure is in place for deliberation. That is, the whole framework\nof facts and properties suggests that there is something we need to\nmoor our moral conceptions to “out there” in reality, when\nin fact what we only need a route to decision. Once we are more\nsensitive to the ethical concerns that really matter to us as rational\nagents, we will find that many of the questions that animate\nmetaethicists turn out to be non-questions or of only minor\nimportance. Others have raised doubts, however, about whether Kantians\ncan so easily avoid engaging in metaethical debates (Hussain &\nShaw 2013).","contact.mail":"adamcureton@utk.edu","contact.domain":"utk.edu"}]
