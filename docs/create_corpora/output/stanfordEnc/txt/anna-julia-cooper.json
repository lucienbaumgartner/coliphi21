Authoring\none of the earliest book-length analyses of the unique situation of\nBlack women in the United States, Cooper offers clearly articulated\ninsights about racialized sexism and sexualized racism without\nignoring the significance of class and labor, education and\nintellectual development, and conceptions of democracy and\ncitizenship.[1]\n  With an academic training deeply rooted in the history\nof Western philosophy and the classics, Cooper’s philosophical\nsignificance also lies in her foundational contributions to feminist\nphilosophy, standpoint theory, and epistemology, as well as critical\nphilosophy of race and African-American philosophy (including African\nAmerican political philosophy). The first two sections of this entry\nsituate Cooper by providing some context for her two best known\nwritings and then exploring the historical and contemporary reception\nof Cooper’s philosophy. From here, the main topics covered include an\nin-depth analysis of her scholarship with special attention given to A\nVoice from the South By a Black Woman of the South, her dissertation\n(L’attitude de la France à l’égard de\nl’esclavage pendant la revolution), and other select essays\nbeyond these two texts. The entry  concludes with a biographical\nsketch of Cooper in order to prioritize her scholarship and critically\nengage her theories (rather than commencing by recounting her life\nstory).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnna Julia Cooper’s best-known written work, A Voice from the\nSouth by a Black Woman of the South, was published in 1892. This collection of essays and\nspeeches, described by Mary Helen Washington as an “unparalleled\narticulation of black feminist thought” and by Beverley\nGuy-Sheftall as the first book length Black feminist text, emphasizes\nthe import of a woman’s voice and her unique contributions while at\nthe same time highlighting the racialization of gender and the\nsexualization of race. Cooper takes an intersectional approach to\nexamining the interlocking systems of race, gender, and class\noppression—explicitly articulating how Black women are\nsimultaneously impacted by racism (the race problem) and sexism (the\nwoman question) and yet she is either an unknown or unacknowledged (by\nwhite women, white men, or Black men) factor in examining or\neliminating these systems of oppression. For these reasons, Cooper\nargues, Black women have a unique epistemological standpoint from\nwhich to observe society and its oppressive systems as well as a\nunique ethical contribution to make in confronting and correcting\nthese oppressive systems. Other central themes in Voice include the importance of education and intellectual\ndevelopment; the necessity of respecting difference and the special\ncontribution that each racial group makes for human progress; an\neconomic, materialist, and existential conceptualization of value or\nworth; and a theory of truth. Thus, this seminal text has\nphilosophical import not only for feminist philosophy, standpoint\ntheory, and epistemology, but also for Critical Philosophy of Race and\nAfrican American philosophy. \n\nAnna Julia Cooper’s Voice was published less than 30\nyears after the 1865 13th Amendment to the Constitution\nwhich declared: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a\npunishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,\nshall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their\njurisdiction.” Select major works that come before Cooper’s Voice include Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge (1838); Religious Experience and the Journal of Mrs. Jarena Lee, Giving an Account of Her Call to Preach the Gospel (1849);  Narrative of SojournerTruth (1850) and the “Ain’t I a Woman” remarks\nattributed to Sojourner Truth (from the 1851 Women’s convention\n in Akron, OH[2]); Narrative of\nthe Life of Frederick Douglass (1845) and Douglass’s My\nBondage and My Freedom (1855); and Martin Delany’s \nThe Origins of Races and Color (1879). \n\nSignificantly, Cooper’s Voice is published\nbefore Booker T. Washington’s famous “Atlanta\nAddress” (1895), his autobiographical works The Story of My\nLife and Work (1896) and Up From Slavery (1901), as well\nas Washington’s historic two-volume The Story of the\nNegro (1909). It is also published ahead of W.E.B. Du\nBois’s well-known “The Conservation of Races” (1897)\nspeech, the publication of The Souls of Black Folk (composed\nof essays and speeches written by Du Bois between 1897 and 1903), and\nDarkwater: Voices from Within the Veil (1920) which not only\nborrows the language of Cooper’s book title, but also relies on\nCooper’s astute insights on race and gender. As Mary Helen\nWashington and Joy James have noted, Du Bois quoted a passage from\nCooper’s “Womanhood: A Vital Element in the Regeneration\nand Progress of a Race,” in his essay “The Damnation of\nWomen” from Darkwater, however; he truncates\nCooper’s full argument in his selective quotations and he fails\nto acknowledge her as the source of the quote. \n\nCooper’s scholarly contributions beyond A Voice from the\nSouth include her translation of the classic French text Le\nPèlerinage de Charlemagne in 1917 and, of course, her\ndissertation—L’attitude de la France à\nl’égard l’esclavage pendant la revolution\n(later translated by Frances Richardson Keller Slavery and the\nFrench Revolutionists) which she defended in Paris, France at the\n Sorbonne in\n 1925.[3]\n Cooper\nbecame the fourth African American woman in the US to earn a Ph.D. and\naccomplishes this feat the same year as Alain Locke publishes two\nseminal writings. Locke, having earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from\nHarvard University in 1918, on the topic “The Problem of\nClassification in Theory of Value” goes on to publish\n“Harlem: Mecca of the New Negro” and then the book length\n version The New Negro: An Interpretation in\n 1925.[4] \n There are several newspaper\narticles announcing Cooper’s achievement, but the event itself,\nand perhaps more importantly the scholarly contributions made by Cooper\nin her thesis, seems to slip into oblivion. Cooper’s\nproject examines the ways in which attitudes about race and the\ninstitution of slavery in France and San Dominique impacted\nconceptualizations of rights and freedom in the contexts of the French\nand Haitian Revolutions (and the Age of Reason and Revolution more\ngenerally). This work by Cooper is quite significant insofar as\nthe Haitian Revolution is too often overlooked in relation to the\nAmerican and French Revolutions, and furthermore, there was a United\nStates military occupation of Haiti at the time she wrote it\n(1914–1935). Cooper’s dissertation offers an insightful and\nyet underappreciated analysis of the Haitian Revolution that could be\npaired well with, for example, C.L.R. James’s The Black\nJacobins. \n\nIn addition to these better-known major scholarly writings, Cooper\nwent on to write and publish other essays and critical commentaries\nover several decades—including a memoir about earning her doctorate\nfrom the Sorbonne titled The Third Step and a memoir about the\nGrimké family titled The Early Years in Washington:\nReminiscences of Life with the Grimkés (both memoirs\npublished about the middle of the twentieth century). \nIntentionally placing Cooper’s scholarship and activism front and\ncenter in recognizing her philosophical import goes against\ncommentaries that cast aside Cooper’s theoretical contributions\nto focus almost exclusively on her biography and personal life. \nAs Lewis Gordon has noted in Existentia Africana: Understanding\nAfricana Existential Thought (2000), too often we find a close\nexamination of the ideas and theories of Black intellectuals absent\nbecause interpretations of their biographies and experiences have been\npreferred focal points. Vivian M. May takes this a step further\nin Anna Julia Cooper, Visionary Black Feminist: A Critical\nIntroduction (2007) where she notes a disturbing tendency among\nmany writers to focus on Black women intellectuals’ lives rather\nthan their theories. Consequently, Black women’s arguments\nand theoretical contributions have frequently been under-engaged or\neven dismissed altogether because so much attention is concentrated on\ntheir life stories. Indeed, the bulk of this encyclopedia entry\nfocuses on Cooper’s scholarship, activism, and philosophical\ncontributions in order to resist this troubling trend. A brief\nbiographical and historical background is available at the end of this\nentry to locate Cooper’s theoretical work within a larger\nsocio-historical and biographical context. \n\nHistorically, Anna Julia Cooper was directly and indirectly engaged in\ndebates about ideas related to race, gender, progress, leadership,\neducation, justice, and rights in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries with race men like Frederick Douglass,\nMartin Delany, Alexander Crummell, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Booker\nT. Washington as well as activist women such as Maria W. Stewart,\nSojourner Truth, Frances Harper, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and Mary Church\nTerrell. These debates transpired not only through speeches and\nwritings (including public essays and private letters), but also at\nmajor meetings like the Hampton Conference (1892), the Chicago World’s\nFair (1893), and the Pan African Conference (1900)—to give only\na few examples. \n\nIn the early African American philosophical canon,\nactivist-intellectuals like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington,\nAlain Locke, and W.E.B. Du Bois tend to be the more readily recognized\nphilosophical figures of the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies in the United States than Anna Julia Cooper and other Black\nwomen scholars and activists from this era who are largely overlooked.\nThe canonization of Black men of this period is evidenced by\nbook-length scholarly publications produced throughout the 1990s such\nas Leonard Harris’s The Philosophy of Alain Locke: Harlem\nRenaissance and Beyond (1991); Howard Brotz’s African\nAmerican Social and Political Thought, 1850–1920 (1992);\nHoward McGary and Bill Lawson’s Between Slavery and Freedom:\nPhilosophy and American Slavery (1993); and Howard McGary’s\nRace and Social Justice (1999). Certainly, the works of prominent\nphilosophers who write about this tradition have made it\npossible even to describe an area of philosophy called “African\nAmerican Philosophy.” Unfortunately these early contributions to\nAfrican American philosophical discourse frequently ignored the\nphilosophical contributions of African American women including\nCooper. Fortunately there is at least one exception to this exclusive\nfocus on men, specifically Joy James’s Transcending the Talented\nTenth (1996) in which Anna Julia Cooper figures prominently\nbeside W.E.B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells-Barnett. James notes the ways\nin which Cooper argued for a bottom up rather than a top down approach\nto leadership and standard of measurement for liberation. Rather than\nfocusing on Black intellectual male elites, Cooper asserted that we\nmust pay attention to the conditions of working class and poor Black\nwomen. This position offers an ethics of the oppressed consistent\nwith many Black feminist philosophies and also comparable with\nContinental figures like Jean-Paul Sartre who makes similar claims\n decades \n later.[5] \n\nAttention to Cooper in the philosophical literature increases as we\nmove into the twenty-first century. For example, when it comes to\nanthologizing Cooper’s scholarship her writings have been\nfeatured in over thirty anthologies, including philosophy anthologies\nsuch as James A. Montmarquet and William H. Hardy’s\nReflections: An Anthology of African American Philosophy\n(2000); Leonard Harris, Scott L. Pratt, and Ann S. Waters’s\nAmerican Philosophies: An Anthology (2001); and Tommy\nLott’s African American Philosophy: Selected Readings\n(2002). More recently, Cooper has earned an important place in\narticles focusing specifically on African American women’s\nphilosophical traditions in special issues of journals.\n Hypatia, Special Issue on Women in the American\nPhilosophical Tradition, Volume 19, Number 2, Spring 2004 (Edited\nby Dorothy Rogers and Therese B. Dykeman) is one example. This\nissue includes two articles on Cooper. The first by Cathryn\nBailey examines Cooper’s philosophy of education (for Cooper,\nliberal arts education provided the tools needed to live an examined\nlife worth living rather than only earning a living) along with\nCooper’s constructions of Black womanhood against prevailing\nnotions that Black women were not true women. And the second\nby Vivan M. May emphasizes Cooper’s intersectional approaches to\nliberation and the epistemological significance of Cooper writing\nherself into typically exclusionary intellectual traditions. \n\nPhilosophia Africana: Analysis of Philosophy and Issues in\nAfrican and the Black Diaspora, Special Issue: Anna Julia\nCooper, Volume 12, Number 1, March 2009 (Edited by Kathryn T.\nGines and Ronald R. Sundstrom) is a special issue devoted entirely to\nCooper. The featured articles connect Cooper’s feminist\nphilosophy with her social and political writings; virtue and care\nethics in Cooper’s writings; romantic conceptions of human nature\nand flourishing; Cooper’s legacy as a public intellectual; and\nher philosophy of social justice that informs her philosophy of\neducation. Likewise African American Review: Special Section\non Anna Julia Cooper, Volume 43, Number 2, Spring 2009 (Edited by\nShirley Moody-Turner) traces the trajectory of Cooper studies from A\nVoice from the South and beyond. Articles here take up\nCooper’s contributions to social theorizing and ethical social\nrelations, race and gender domination, critiques of racial\nrepresentation, social and economic oppression, radical approaches to\neducation, and community advocacy. \n\nIn addition to Gines, Sundstrom, and Bailey above, prominent\nphilosophers like Lewis Gordon have also highlighted Cooper’s\nphilosophical import, including her contributions to existentialism,\nBlack feminist philosophy, and theories of worth, in two important\ntexts. In Existentia Africana: Understanding Africana\nExistential Thought (2000) Gordon presents Cooper as a nineteenth\ncentury figure exploring questions of problematic existence and\nsuffering within black intellectual existential productions. \nCooper engaged ontological questions of being—from liberation\nand humanization to revolution and freedom. With this in mind,\nGordon examines the existential dimensions of Cooper’s A\nVoice from the South, placing it beside texts like W.E.B. Du\nBois’s Souls of Black Folk, Ralph Ellison’s\nGoing into the Territory, Frantz Fanon’s Black Skin,\nWhite Masks, and Toni Morrison’s Playing in the\nDark. \n\nIn An Introduction to Africana Philosophy—Cambridge\nIntroductions to Philosophy (2008), Gordon asserts that Cooper,\n“is without question the most sophisticated thinker on what is\nknown today as black feminist thought from the late nineteenth century\ninto the early twentieth century” (Gordon 2008, 71).  More\nspecifically, Gordon explains how Cooper’s A Voice from the\nSouth “articulated the argument that continues to resonate\nin black feminist thought, namely, that black women must become agents\nof their own future, and that much of the health of their community\nrests on their shoulders because of the burdens they are forced to\ncarry.  This argument is advanced through her theory of worth, which\nshe issues in response to racist arguments against the value of black\npeople.” Cooper’s theory of worth, described by Gordon as\n“an efficiency theory of worth” is especially evident in\nher essay “What Are We Worth?” (Gordon 2008, 71).  Gordon\nplaces Cooper’s philosophical insights here in conversation with\nMarx (“Cooper, like Marx, was in fact working with a model of\nalienation that did not require the category of oppression, although\nsubjugation and correlates with slavery were hallmarks of their\nthought”) and Nietzsche (both explored the relationship between\nworth and health—those benefiting from absence of adversity are\nless healthy than those facing and overcoming adversity). \n\nThere is not yet a book length analysis written by a philosopher\nthat focuses on Cooper’s philosophical import and contributions,\nhowever; one could certainly argue that Vivian M. May’s Anna\nJulia Cooper, Visionary Black Feminist: A Critical Introduction\n(2007) offers the most comprehensive analysis of Cooper’s\nwritings to date. Going against critical readings and\n(mis)interpretations of Cooper as an elitist who subscribed to Western\nethnocentrism and Victorian constructions of the “Cult of True\nWomanhood,” May challenges Cooper’s readers and critics to\nengage in a more nuanced analysis of her writings and activism.\nFor example, May emphasizes Cooper’s activism (which is often\nmarginalized and/or erased altogether in the secondary literature) in a\nway that demonstrates how Cooper’s lived experience and\nscholarship were quite anti-elitist. According to May,\n“Perhaps, then, the challenge lies in developing flexible\ninterpretative strategies able to attend to Cooper’s different\nvocal registers or resonances without silencing them, and more\nexpansive notions of political action or of counter-publics able to\nrecognize a broader range of activities as, in fact, activist”\n(50). Additionally, in response to Stephanie Athey’s\nframing of Cooper as problematically relying on eugenic language and\nideology, May presents a counter-argument reading Cooper as\ncontributing to an early materialist Black feminist analysis of Black\nwomen’s oppression (55). Contra claims that Cooper sought\nto imitate whiteness or Western ethnocentrism and Eurocentrism, May\nunderscores Cooper’s contention that “imitation is the\nworst of suicide” and adds, “Cooper argued that what\nAfrican Americans needed most was ‘deliverance’ from\nnormative whiteness” (61). May also emphatically rejects\ndismissals of Cooper as a woman invested in the oppressive\nhabitus of “True Womanhood,” offering an alternate\nreading of Cooper as one who manipulates and strategically redeploys,\nrather than fully accepts or embraces, the tenets of True\nWomanhood. \n\nThe historical neglect of Cooper’s scholarship by philosophers\nrequires an extensive overview of Cooper’s scholarly\nwritings. This section reintroduces A Voice from the\nSouth in order to advance Cooper’s place, not only in\nAfrican American philosophy and Critical Philosophy of Race, but also\nin Feminist and Social and Political Philosophy. Voice\nis organized into two parts.  The first part, “The Colored\nWoman’s Office”, includes: “Our Raison\nd’Être” (1892); “Womanhood: A Vital Element in\nthe Regeneration and Progress of a Race” (1892); “The\nHigher Education of Women” (1890–1891); “Woman Versus the\nIndian” (1891–1892); and “The Status of Women in\nAmerica”(1892). The second part, “Race and\nCulture” features: “Has America a Race Problem: If So, How\nCan it Best Be Solved?” (1892); “The Negro as Presented in\nAmerican Literature” (1892); “What Are We Worth?”\n(1892); and “The Gain from a Belief” (1892). In this\ncollection of essays, several of which were originally delivered as\npublic speeches, Cooper argues that woman’s experience in general\nand Black woman’s experience in particular, places her in a\nunique position to have a distinctive voice, influence, and\ncontribution to make to her race, to the nation, and to the world more\nbroadly. \n\nIn the short but powerful opening statement of A Voice from the\nSouth, “Our Raison d’Être” (1892) Cooper\nexplains that while the voice of the Negro (man) of the South has been\nbut a muffled chord, “the one mute and voiceless note has been\nthe sadly expectant Black woman…” (cited in The Voice of\nAnna Julia Cooper, hereafter VAJC, p. 51).  Using the analogy of a\ncourtroom trial, Cooper explains that the plaintiff’s and\ndefendant’s attorneys:  \n\nCooper underscores how the Black [male] client, the muffled voice,\nhas at least been consulted, even if only with “ignorance”\nand “misapprehension.” But the “one important\nwitness,” i.e. the Black woman, has been rendered mute and\nvoiceless. Cooper asserts that the white man cannot speak to Black\nmen’s experiences and furthermore, that Black men cannot speak to\nBlack women’s experiences. She elaborates on this position in\n“Womanhood, A Vital Element in the Regeneration and Progress of\na Race.” \n\nIn “Womanhood: A Vital Element in the Regeneration and\nProgress of a Race” (1886) Cooper astutely addresses intersecting\nissues of race, gender, and society—including intra-group\nracial politics, intra-group gender politics, and the professed ideals\nof American society. Her observations speak directly to debates\nin early African American philosophy and political thought around\nleadership, representation, and competing philosophies of race (for\nexample between Frederick Douglass’s assimilationism and Martin\nDelany’s separatism). Concerning intra-group racial\npolitics, Cooper asserts: “The Late Martin Delany, who was an\nunadulterated black man, used to say when honors fell upon him, that\nwhen he entered the council of kings the black race entered with him;\nmeaning, I suppose, that there was no discounting his race identity and\nattributing his achievements to some admixture of Saxon blood”\n(VAJC 63). As a Black woman whose father is thought to have been\nher mother’s white master, Cooper pushes back on two fronts.\n Not only can Delany not represent the whole simply by virtue of\nhis “pure” Black blood (unmixed with Saxon blood), but also\nbecause “no man can represent the race” (VAJC 63). It\nis in this context that Cooper made the now famous declaration that\n“Only the BLACK WOMAN can say ‘when and where I enter, in\nthe quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and\nwithout suing or special patronage, then and there the whole Negro\nrace enters with me” (VAJC, 63). Here she\nproblematizes intra-group race and gender politics (specifically Black\nmale patriarchy) by insisting on the significance of the BLACK WOMAN in\ngeneral and laying claim to her particular significance as a Black\nwoman to the progress of the race—this despite the admixture of Saxon\nblood, which in her case had been violently imposed by the legacy of\nslavery and the systematic sexual exploitation of Black women. \n\nThis analysis also provides a different background against which we\ncan read Cooper’s description of the “colored girls”\nof the South as: “that large, bright, fatally beautiful class\nthat stand shivering like delicate plantlets before the fury of\ntempestuous elements, so full of promise, yet so sure of destruction;\noften without a father to whom they dare apply the loving term, often\nwithout a stronger brother to espouse their cause and defend their\nhonor…” (VAJC 60). This passage not only underscores the\ndanger that Black girls and women faced in terms of sexual\nexploitation it also challenges some claims made by Alexander Crummell\nin a speech given three years earlier titled “The Black Woman of\nthe South: Her Neglects and Her Needs” (1883).  Crummell makes a\nclear distinction between the colored people (whom he\ndescribes as those who were more educated and had better material\nconditions) and the negro population (whom he describes as\nintellectual starvelings).  Crummell attributes the affluence of\ncolored people to “the kindness and generosity of their white\nkindred—white fathers and relatives (1883, 212).  Cooper is\nmaking the case that “colored” people don’t always\nhave a “father to whom they dare apply the loving term” or\nthe kindness and generosity that having white kindred in selective\ninstances might have entailed. She also makes many references to the\nways in which white men protected “English womanhood” and\nthe perceived lack of protection of Black women by Black men. When\nCooper asserts that snares and traps are set for the\n“unprotected, untrained colored girl of the South,” this\nis a reference to the sexual exploitation of Black girls and\nwomen (VAJC, 64). \n\nCooper emphasizes the honor of Black women, the idea that they\nshould occupy the role of mother or a family role (“Woman,\nMother,—your responsibility is one that might make the angels\ntremble…The training of children…” [VAJC, 59]), and\ntheir responsibility for the moral education of Black youth and the\nregeneration of the race (“…the regeneration…the\nretraining of the race…must be the black woman” [VAJC,\n62]). On this basis, some have argued that Cooper upholds American\nideals of womanhood and attempts to assimilate Black women to the\ncharacteristics often assigned to their white female\ncounterparts. Other examples of these ideals include\nCooper’s claim that “the hope of our\ncountry…rests…on the home life and the influence of good\nwomen in those homes” (VAJC, 55). And furthermore, that the\nresponsibility of woman and mother is to train children (VAJC,\n55). Cooper asserts: “…the position of woman in\nsociety determines the vital elements of its regeneration and\nprogress. Now that this is so on a priori grounds all\nmust admit. And this is not because woman is better or stronger\nor wiser than man, but…because it is she who must first form the\nman by directing the earliest impulses of his character” (VAJC\n59). These ideas about women’s role in society,\nand/or civilization are comparable to those expressed by Thomas\nBabington Macaulay, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Martin Delany.  \n\nMacaulay states, “‘You may judge a nation’s rank\nin the scale of civilization from the way they treat their\nwomen’” (VAJC, 55). Likewise Ralph Waldo Emerson\nclaims in “American Civilization”: \n\nAnd in The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the\nColored People of the United States, Martin Delany declares,\n“No people are ever elevated above the condition of their\nfemales; hence, the condition of the mother\ndetermines the condition of the child. To know the position of a\npeople, it is only necessary to know the condition of their\nfemales; and despite themselves, they cannot rise above\ntheir level” (Delany 1862, Chapter 24, Delany's \nemphasis).[6] \n\nIn addition to questions about gender, Cooper also interrogates ideals\nabout civilization and society. Some take Cooper’s representation of\nAmerican society as an exemplar to be problematic,\nespecially when she looks down on other societies to\njustify this idealized standard. For example, she disparages the lifestyles\nof those in Turkey describing them as “the vilest of the vile,\nunprogressive, unambitious, and inconceivably low…[Turkey is an]\neffete and immobile civilization” (VAJC, 54). At times she\nglorifies American society and contrasts it with others. America\nis described as fresh, vigorous, progressive, elevating and inspiring,\n“the European bud and the American flower of civilization”\n(VAJC, 54). She acknowledges we have not yet reached our ideal\nAmerican civilization, but assures her audience that “America is the\narena in which the next triumph of civilization is to be won”\n(VAJC, 54). Cooper, however, does not completely romanticize the\nAmerican experience. Although she describes America as the\n“flower of modern civilization” she quickly notes that\nevery person in America is not able to fully experience this\n“floral” aspect of American life. Cooper is very aware\nthat the Black experience in America is quite contrary to that of their\nwhite counterparts. But she is hopeful, perhaps over-optimistic,\nabout improving the status and experience of Blacks in America,\nstating, “our satisfaction in American institutions rests not in\nthe fruition we now enjoy, but it springs rather from the possibilities\nand promise that are inherent in the system, though as yet, perhaps,\nfar in the future” (VAJC, 54). Some might read this as\nCooper’s attempt to hold America up to its professed ideals.  \n\nIn the essay “The Higher Education of Women”\n(1890–1891) Cooper provides a feminist argument for educating\nwomen. She examines the sentiments against the education of women\nin the early 1800s and provides a counter argument by referencing the\npositive impact that education has had in the lives of women who were\nable to attend colleges and pursue B. A. degrees as well as the\npositive impact on the world more broadly. According to Cooper, higher\neducation among women “…has given symmetry and\ncompleteness to the world’s agencies” (VAJC, 76). Thus, one of\nthe objectives of giving women access to higher education is to better\nequip them to influence humanity and to contribute to the questions,\nproblems and debates on the world stage. Cooper argues, “the\nfeminine factor can have its proper effect only through women’s\ndevelopment and education so that she may fitly and intelligently\nstamp her force on the forces of her day…” (VAJC,\n78). \nCooper not only discusses the education of women in general, she\nis also acutely aware of the importance of education in the lives of\nBlack women and girls in particular. We are again reminded of the double\ndamnation of Black women, here in the area of education. While\nthere were constraints on educational opportunities for\nBlack people more generally, she brings attention to an attitude of\nresistance from Black men concerning academic development among\nwomen. Cooper admits, “It seems hardly a gracious thing to\nsay, but it strikes me as true, that while our men seem thoroughly\nabreast of the times in almost every other subject, when they strike\nthe woman question they drop back into sixteenth century logic”\n(VAJC, 85). She notes that while Black men were aware of\nissues such as racial uplift, they largely ignored the problems\nspecific to (Black) women, i.e. the other “half” of the\nrace that they were supposedly uplifting. This antiquated\nattitude is not limited to the higher education of adult women, but\nalso applied to young girls. Cooper exclaims, “[G]ive\nthe girls a chance!… Let our girls feel that we expect more from\nthem than that they merely look pretty and appear well in\nsociety. Teach them that there is a race with special needs which\nthey and only they can help; that the world needs and is already asking\nfor their trained, efficient forces” (VAJC, 86–87). \n\nIn “The Higher Education of Women” we see Cooper’s\ncommitment to the idea that women (and girls) have a voice that must be\nheard, they have an influence and contribution that must be made to the\nrace and to all of humanity. The attainment of higher education\nby women has produced well-equipped and thoughtful women “whom\nthe world has long awaited for in pain and anguish till there should be\nadded…the complement of that masculine influence which has\ndominated it for fourteen centuries” (VAJC, 73). Cooper expounds\non her theories about the unique mission and influence of women, namely\n“to put in the tender and sympathetic cord in nature’s\ngrand symphony, and counteract, or better, harmonize the diapason of\nmere strength and might” (VAJC, 75). Cooper acknowledges\nthat with the (negative) influence of men, some women may strike a\n“false note” or parrot “cold \nconceits”—however, Cooper insists that “her \nheart is aglow with sympathy\nand loving kindness, and she cannot be true to her real self without\ngiving out these elements into the forces of the world” (VAJC,\n75). \n\nIn “Woman Versus the Indian” Cooper situates her\nphilosophy of rights intersectionally—calling for the natural\ninherent rights of all people, or “the rights of humanity”\nbut also specifying groups typically denied these rights such as\nBlacks, women, Indians (or Native Americans), and the poor. Just as\nshe is critical of Black men for their sexism, Cooper is equally\ncritical of white women’s racism, particularly the racism expressed by\nwhite women’s organizations that claimed to be tackling the oppression\nof all women. She challenges the tendency in the (white)\nwoman’s movement to fight for (white) women’s rights at the expense\nof, or instead of, others’ rights. Taking a strong stand against all\nforms of oppression in “Woman Versus the Indian”\n(1891–1892) she declares: \n\nIn this essay, Cooper is responding in part to an essay by Ann Shaw\nwith the same title. Shaw’s essay, as the title suggests,\nplaces the issue of women’s rights against the rights of American\nIndians. It is noteworthy that Cooper rejects exclusionary\nreasoning (by inference or by argument) stating, “All prejudices,\nwhether of race, sect, or sex, class pride, and caste distinctions are\nthe belittling inheritance and badge of snobs and prigs” (VAJC,\n105). Cooper’s disdain for such thinking is thoroughly\ncommunicated. She adds, “The philosophic mind sees that its\nown ‘rights’ are the rights of humanity” (VAJC, 105).\nCooper is denouncing oppression against all persons, “The\nwhite woman does not need to sue the Indian, or the Negro, or any other\nrace or class who have been crushed under the iron heel of Anglo Saxon\npower and selfishness” (VAJC, 108). \n\nFor Cooper, it is necessary to reject and speak out against all\nforms of oppression. She petitions: \n\nShe pleads the cause of every man and woman who is wronged,\nrejecting oppression against the ignorant, various races, and\nwomen. \n\nIn “The Status of Woman in America” (1892), Cooper\ndemonstrates continued awareness of issues facing Black women in\nAmerica and she advocates their political involvement and\nempowerment. Cooper discusses the U.S. economy and the condition\nof women during the woman’s era of the late nineteenth century,\n(VAJC,\n 11).[7] \nShe brings\nto the forefront the dilemma of the Black woman, the fact that\n“She is confronted by both a woman question and a race problem\nand is as yet an unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both” (VAJC,\n112).  \n\nCooper emphasizes the dedication of educated and uneducated Black\nwomen to the survival of the race. Both have demonstrated their\ncommitment to the race in concrete ways, for example, by leaving their\nhusbands for committing “race disloyalty” in their voting\nchoices during Reconstruction (VAJC, 133 and 115). She states,\n“It is notorious that ignorant black women in the South have\nactually left their husband’s homes…for what was understood by\nthe wife to be race disloyalty, or ‘voting away’ as she\nexpresses it, the privileges of herself and her little ones”\n(VAJC, 115). Cooper makes many references here to Black men, the role\nthey played in politics, and how they were “absorbed in the\nimmediate needs of their own political interests” (VAJC,\n113). She also mentions the perception that the “Democratic\nNegro is a traitor and a time server” (VAJC, 115). She adds,\n“…there are not many men…who would dare face a\nwife quivering in every fiber with the consciousness that her husband\nis a coward who could be paid to desert her deepest and dearest\ninterests” (VAJC, 115).  \n\nIn this essay, Cooper makes no attempt to gloss over the sexist\nchallenges faced by Black women. She states that Black women are\n“hampered and shamed by a less liberal sentiment and a more\nconservative attitude on the part of those for whose opinion she cares\nmost [i.e. Black men]” (VAJC, 113). She adds, “As far as\nmy experience goes the average man of our race is less frequently\nready to admit the actual need among the sturdier forces of the world\nfor women’s help or influence” (VAJC, 113). Cooper asserts that\nwomen have significant contributions to make to social, economic, and\nnational issues (“Great social and economic questions await her\ninfluence” [VAJC, 113]).  They can shed light on the\nmanagement of school systems, public institutions, prison systems, and\nmental institutions (VAJC, 113). Cooper understood that the status of\nwomen and their role in the progress of the race was changing. She\nrecalls that fifty years before her time a woman’s activity was\nlimited to “a clearly cut ‘sphere’, including\nprimarily the kitchen and the nursery… [But] the woman of today\nfinds herself in the presence of responsibilities which ramify through\nthe profoundest and most varied interests of her country and\nrace” (VAJC, 116). \n\nThis can be read in contrast to some of the gender roles that Cooper\noutlined in the “Womanhood” essay. In the\n“Status” essay we see Cooper take up a stronger more\nencompassing notion of Black female agency that more readily embraces\nnew opportunities and possibilities for Black women outside of the\ndomestic sphere. She is speaking here of the vital roles that\nwomen must play outside of the home in order to see progress for the\nBlack race. What she has in mind here goes beyond the traditional\nstandards of white womanhood.  \n\nIn “Has America a Race Problem? If So, How Can it Best\nBe Solved?” (1892) Cooper argues that progressive peace is\nachieved through fair conflict and difference, anticipating later work\nby Audre Lorde. According to Cooper, “All through\nGod’s universe we see eternal harmony and symmetry as the\nunvarying result of the equilibrium of opposing forces” (VAJC,\n121). Operating at the forefront of this analysis is racial conflict. What Cooper has in mind is not the obliteration\nof one race by another, but the progress that is achievable when we\nembrace difference and change. Cooper endorses multiculturalism\nand racial diversity for the purpose of progress and argues that\nisolation hinders the development of racial groups rather\nthan making them stronger. Here Cooper is responding to various\npositions about interactions, or even admixture, between races. \nLike Crummell before her and Du Bois after her, Cooper was convinced\nthat every race had a particular purpose and message to contribute\ntoward human progress. Du Bois has been credited with\nmaking this claim in “Conservation of Races” from\nThe Souls of Black Folk, but this idea had been prevalent for\nyears before the 1897 “Conservation of Races” speech. \n\nRobert Bernasconi has traced this idea back to the philosophy of\nJohann Gottfried von Herder who wrote Ideas on the Philosophy of\nthe History of Humankind (1784). Herder (against Immanuel Kant)\nactually “rejected the division of humanity into races and\ninsisted that a division into peoples is more appropriate”\n(Bernasconi 2000, 23).  Herder argued that each group of peoples has a\nunique and important contribution to make to civilization. Going\nagainst prevailing 18th century ideas about civilization\nand race, Herder asserted that the Negro is a human and not an\nanimal. He adds, “You should not oppress him, nor murder him,\nnor steal from him: for he is a human being just as you\nare…” (Bernasconi 2000, 26). \n\nThis provides greater insight into not only Du Bois’s claim that\n“manifestly some of the great races of today—particularly\nthe Negro race—have not as yet given to civilization the full\nspiritual message which they are capable of giving (Du Bois 1897,\nquoted from Du Bois 1903, 26), but also Cooper’s claim (five years\nbefore Du Bois) that “Each race has its badge, its exponent, its\nmessage, branded in its forehead by the great Master’s hand\nwhich is its own peculiar keynote, and its contribution to the harmony\nof the nations” (VAJC, 122). For Cooper, the delivery of each\nmessage requires contact and conflict, but\nnot brutal repression and racial domination. Cooper is\nclear that prejudice and race domination only leads to immobility and\ndeath. Implicit in her argument is a rejection of the complete\nassimilation (or even amalgamation) of one race into another. (This is also a theme that is taken up later by Du Bois.) \nCooper constantly reiterates the point that race differences are\nintended to encourage races to sharpen or improve one another through\nequilibrium, conflict, and harmony, not through domination and\nhierarchy, or even assimilation. We see the significance of God\neven in Cooper’s philosophy of history as it relates to conflict\nand progress when she explains, “the God of battles is in the\nconflicts of history. The evolution of civilization is in His\ncare, eternal progress His delight” (VAJC, 129). \n\nIn “The Negro As Presented in American Literature”\n(1892) Cooper shows that standpoint theory does not have to devolve\ninto unending relativism when we take into account the possibility of\nan inauthentic standpoint. She expresses her outrage at\npseudo-intellectuals who disingenuously take up the “Negro\nquestion” to analyze race, bringing with them their prejudices,\nantipathies, and a rejection of any candid and careful study. She\nexplains that with “flippant indifference” many\n“aspire to enlighten the world with dissertations on the racial\ntraits of the Negro” (VAJC, 140). This is the case, not only for\ndissertations on race, but also for art and literature that seeks to\nportray a distorted image of the Negro. Cooper asserts, “it is an insult\nto humanity and a sin against God to publish any such sweeping\ngeneralizations of a race on such meager and superficial\ninformation. We meet at every turn—this obtrusive and\noffensive vulgarity, this gratuitous sizing up of the Negro and\nconclusively writing down his equation, sometimes even among his ardent\nfriends and bravest defenders” (VAJC, 147). \n\nCooper calls into question the standpoint from which such\ndissertations are written and argues that the Negro has the right to\nidentify the shortcomings of such analyses. The issues raised by\nCooper here concern not only the standpoint from which these materials\nare produced, but also the inauthenticity of the product itself.  This\ninauthenticity leads to a mass production of images that\n“portray colored persons only as bootblacks and hotel waiters,\ngrinning from ear to ear and bowing and curtseying for the extra\ntips” (VAJC, 149). As a result of this false yet dominating\nimage, many have not seen, “and therefore cannot be convinced\nthat there exists a quiet, self-respecting, dignified class,\n…of cultivated tastes and habits…” among Negroes,\n(VAJC, 149). Even more impressive than Cooper’s ability to advance\nissues of standpoint theory and authenticity, is her insight about the\nproducers of these controling negative images. Cooper asserts that\nrather than producing an accurate picture of the Black man, these\nportraits only reveal the consciousness (or subconsciousness) of the\nwhite man producing the images.  According to Cooper, the authentic\nimage of the Negro has not yet been produced. She assets, “an\nauthentic portrait, at once aesthetic and true to life, presenting the\nBlack man as a free American citizen, not just the humble slave of\nUncle Tom’s Cabin—but the man, divinely\nstruggling and aspiring yet tragically warped and distorted by the\nadverse winds of circumstance, has not yet been painted…that\ncanvass awaits the brush of the colored man himself” (VAJC,\n158). \n\nIn “What Are We Worth?” Cooper provides a theoretical\nrendering of race prejudice, grounding it in sentiment and/or\nideas. Cooper’s starting point for these reflections is a\nquote from Henry Ward Beecher (brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe) in\nwhich he asks, if Africa and Africans where to sink into the ocean\n“how much poorer would the world be?” and then posits that\nin the end “not a poem, not an invention, not a piece of art\nwould be missed from the world”—suggesting that none of\nthe above have been contributed to the world by Africa or\nAfricans. From this starting point Cooper goes on to describe\nsentiment as “ephemeral”, “shifting”, and\n“unreliable”, and furthermore that “color\nprejudice or race prejudice is mere sentiment governed by the\nassociation of ideas” (VAJC, 162). Cooper surmises that when she\nhears expressions of dislike of the Negro for being “weak”\nsuch sentiments are an example of narrow-mindedness that is not worth\nengaging. She states, “Now this dislike it is useless to\ninveigh against and folly to rail at” (VAJC, 162). \n\nPresenting race prejudice as sentiment governed by the association\nof ideas, Cooper explains that it is “impervious to reason”\nand “cannot be annihilated by rhetoric” (VAJC, 163). \nThus, rather than approach the question of the worth of Africans from the standpoint of sentiment, Cooper raises the\nexistential and phenomenological question of the value of human\npersons, particularly persons of African descent in the American\ncontext. She then shifts her analysis of worth to market value,\nexamining the notion of worth as determined by the value of material,\nlabor, and in the case of persons, the vital importance of education\n(“Education, then, is the safest and richest investment possible\nto man” [VAJC, 168]). \n\nCooper offers an array of statistics on Black schools (including\nearly childhood developments, colleges, and universities), teachers,\nministers, and other professionals (e.g. doctors and lawyers) to make\nthe case for the “unassisted effort of the colored people for\nself-development” (VAJC, 169). She also provides\nstatistics on the high mortality rates, the economic disempowerment of\nshare cropping systems, and the limited housing opportunities among\nBlack Americans. Cooper describes the white labor unions of the\nNorth as tyrannical insofar as their working conditions are far more\npreferable to those of Black men working for fifty cents per day in the\nfields and “the pinched and down-trodden colored women bending\nover wash-tubs and ironing boards—with children to feed and\nhouse rent to pay, wood to buy, soap and starch to \nfurnish—lugging home weekly great baskets of clothes for \nfamilies who pay them\nfor a month’s laundrying barely enough to purchase a substantial\npair of shoes” (VAJC, 173). Cooper critiques labor unions when she describes\n“foreigners” and “immigrant laborers, who cannot even\nspeak English” threatening to “cut off the nerve and\nparalyze the progress of an industry that gives work to an\nAmerican-born citizen” (VAJC, 173–174). \n\nReturning to the education question, Cooper is clear that she\nsupports both classical education and trade education based on what is\nmost appropriate for the individual student. On the one hand, she notes, “I\nwant nothing I may say to be construed into an attack on classical\ntraining or on art development and culture. I believe in allowing\nevery longing of the human soul to attain its utmost reach”\n(VAJC, 175). On the other hand, she is clear that, “The\npower of appreciation is the measure of an individual’s\naptitudes; and if a boy hates Greek and Latin and spends all his time\nwhittling out steamboats, it is rather foolish to try to force him into\nthe classics” (VAJC, 175). \n\nAs if rebutting the opening suggestion by Beecher that Africans have\nnot contributed poetry, inventions, or art—Cooper highlights\nthe poetic contributions of Phillis Wheatley, the inventions of\nsuccessful Black farmers, the heroism of Black soldiers, and the\nartistic work of sculptor Mary Edmonia Lewis. Coming full circle\nback to her description of race prejudice as sentiment Cooper\nconcludes: “Short sighted idiosyncrasies are but transient\nphenomena. It is futile to combat them, and unphilosophical to be\ndepressed by them…Our only care need be the intrinsic worth of\nour contributions…and if we contribute a positive value in those\nthings the world prizes, no amount of negrophobia can ultimately\nprevent its recognition” (VAJC, 187). \n\nIn “The Gain from a Belief” Cooper takes on English and\nFrench progressivism and positivism of the 19th century\n(Mill, Comte, and others) using these figures’ organic metaphors\nand visions of cultural development to explore the debates about racial\nuplift, the so-called Negro problem, liberalism, cosmopolitanism, and\nuniversal brotherhood. She presents the reader with a\nphilosophical antagonist—a solitary figure with a cold,\nintellectual eye, pallid check, and harrowed brow. He represents\n\n“Speculative unbelief, curiously and sneeringly watching the\n\nhumdrum, common-place, bread-and-butter toil of unspeculative\nbelief” (VAJC, 188). This thinker—with his\nspeculative unbelief, skepticism, positivism, and agnosticism, is\njuxtaposed with “struggling, working, believing humanity”\nthat holds unscientific faith. Confronting the imagined\nphilosophical figure Cooper states, “Sir…Your philosophy,\nI presume, lifts you above the toils and anxieties, the ambitions and\naspirations of the common herd. Pardon me, but do you not feel\ncalled to devote those superior powers of yours to the uplifting of\nyour less favored brotheren?” (VAJC, 188). \n\nCooper goes on to describe various philosophical positions\nconcerning positivism, agnosticism, and skepticism looking at the works\nof Pascal, Ritcher, Hume, Comte, Huxley, Mill, Spencer, Lewes, and\nIngersoll. Against these philosophies, Cooper makes the case for\nthe import of heroism, devotion, and sacrifice inspired by feeling,\nfaith, and belief. She clarifies her position of faith noting,\n“I do not mean by faith the holding of correct views and\nunimpeachable opinions on mooted questions; nor to I understand it to\nbe the ability to forge cast-iron formulas and dub them TRUTH…To\nme, faith means treating the truth as true” (VAJC,\n193). These points are directed toward the possibilities and\nvarious beliefs concerning racial uplift.  \n\nCooper asserts, “Life must be more than dilettante\nspeculation” (VAJC, 194). Rather than talking as a\nspectator, you ought to lead, finance, and live what you believe. \nTaking up some of the racial debates of that time, Cooper argues that\none’s actions should follow from one’s beliefs. If\nyou believe that “…the Negro race in America has a\nveritable destiny in His [God’s] eternal purposes”…\nthen time should not be wasted on “discussing the ‘Negro\nProblem’ amid the clouds of your fine Havana, ensconced in your\nfriend’s well-cushioned arm-chair and with your patent leather\nboot-tips elevated to the opposite mantle” (VAJC, 194).\nIf you believe that “God hath made one blood of all\nnations of the earth; and that interests which specialize and contract\nbroad, liberal, cosmopolitan idea of universal brotherhood and equality\nare narrow and pernicious, then treat that truth as true” (VAJC,\n194). Cooper asks philosophers and thinkers to be consistent in\napplying their positions and expressing their beliefs. She\nadvises, “Don’t inveigh against lines of longitude drawn by\nothers when at the same time you are applying your genius to devising\nlines of latitude which are neither race lines, nor character lines,\nnor intelligence lines—but certain social-appearance circlets\nassorting your ‘universal brotherhood’ by shapes of noses\nand texture of hair” (VAJC, 194). Cooper continues,\n“If you object to imaginary lines—don’t\ndraw them! Leave only the real lines of nature and\ncharacter” (VAJC, 195). She concludes by returning to the\nimport of the power of belief, “If thou believest, all things are\npossible; and as thou believest, so be it to thee”\n(VAJC, 196). \n\nCooper’s dissertation provides insights and analyses pertinent\nto social and political philosophy, critical philosophy of race, as\nwell as critical interpretations of French Enlightenment. Like\nVoice, this text by Cooper warrants an extensive overview\nbecause it has remained almost wholly overlooked by philosophers. In\nL’attitude de la France à l’égard de\nl’esclavage pendant la revolution, Cooper succeeds in\nresituating racial oppression, colonialism, and slavery as issues\ncentral to rather than tangential to the French and Haitian\nRevolutions. Her topic was motivated by several observations\nincluding comments from French President Poincaré—which to her\nseemed significant to France’s attitude about racial equality, as\nwell as the erection of a monument in Dakar, “A la Gloire de l\nArmée Noirse” (VAJC, 324). Additionally, Cooper was\nresearching “the Franco Japanese Treaty of 1896—The\nNaturalization of France: a) for Japanese, b) Hindus, c) Negroes, and\nof course the discussions of the National Assemblies during the French\nRevolution; the writings and speeches of and about La\nSociété des Amis des Noir—l’Abbe Gregoire\nand others” (VAJC, 324). \n\nTo these interests and influences, Cooper adds her avid reading of\nLe Monde Noir (or La Revue du Monde Noir) and\ncontributions from thinkers such as Franz Boas, Jean Finot, Author de\nGobineau, along with discourses from Alphanse de Lamartine and his\ndrama Toussaint L’Ouverture. La Revue du Monde\nNoir, launched in October 1931, was conceptualized at the Clamart\nsalon (located in the Paris apartment of Jane and Paulette Nardal) and\nmanaged by the Nardal sisters along with Léo Sajous, Clara\nShepard, and Louis-Jean Finot. An original issue of La\nRevue du Monde Noir is in Cooper’s archived papers at Howard\nUniversity’s Moorland-Springarn Center. Priced at 7 francs\n50 or 30 cents U.S., the issue contains such contributions as\n“Race Equality” by Louis-Jean Finot, “The Creole\nRace” by Maître Jean-Louis, a poem by Claude McKay, and\n“A Negro Woman speaks at Cambridge and Geneva” by Paulette\nNardal. \n\nThe introduction to Cooper’s thesis outlines the origins of the\ninstitution of “Negro slave trade,” which was\n“founded on the abuse of power…and maintained by\nviolence” (SFHR, 31). Cooper discusses the impact of the slave\ntrade on mortality rates of the enslaved (e.g. through the middle\npassage) along with the ways in which slavery and colonialism\nunderdeveloped the continent of Africa while enriching the Spanish,\nPortuguese, Iberian peoples, the United States, England and\nFrance—among others. She highlights the harms of slavery for\nboth the slavers and the enslaved while also underscoring the\nprominent role of slavery in the colonial system. In France in\nparticular she asserts, “the colonists, the rich merchants, had\ntoo much to gain from the shameful traffic in slaves to be willing\neven to consider the possibility of suppressing slavery. Since the\ntime of Colbert, too many French ports had been developed and enriched\nby the trade” (SFHR, 37). The struggle against slavery and the\nopposing interests of the colonists against the Blacks would have been\none-sided in the interest of the colonist, Cooper asserts, if not for\nthe establishment of the Friends of the Blacks by Brissot,\nSièyes, and Condorcet in 1787, (SFHR, 37). \n\nAgainst this background, in the first chapter of the thesis Cooper\ndetails the prosperity of the French colonies, especially Santo\nDomingo, on the eve of the Revolution (“The Social Conditions of\nthe French-American Colonies; the Class Structure”). She\ndescribes the various classes including the “petite blancs”\n(lower middle class whites), “mulatto class” (sometimes\nrather well educated and extremely desirous of affirming their equality\nwith whites), “colored men” (a term used by the petit\nblancs that included both those with a mixture of the white race and\nthe black race, as well as the pure Negro natives of Africa or the\ncolonies), and “freed men” (who were generally poor and who\nwere almost as jealous of the mulattos as of the whites), (SFHR,\n44–45).  \n\nFrom here Cooper details the geography of Santo Domingo and the\nconflicts (including slave revolts and the violence of the colonial and\nslave systems) that contributed to the white colonists of Santo Domingo\napproaching the National Assembly of France. Disturbed about the\ninfluence of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, the colonists\nestablished an adversarial group called the Massiac Club, which claimed\nthe right to be represented in the National Assembly. The\nunexpected result was the increased visibility of the colonial problem\nfor the public, which actually strengthened the position of the Friends\nof the Blacks concerning the problem of human liberty and equality\nbetween the races, (SFHR, 48–49). Cooper states, “Thus the\nFriends of the Blacks profited from the admission of the deputies of\nSanto Domingo to draw attention toward the great problem of equality of\nthe races, and to the concurrent problem of the suppression of\nslavery” (SFHR, 53). Another outcome of this debate was\nthe question of the principle of colonial representation—the idea\nthat the colonies are a part of the national territory of France, not\njust lands to be exploited, (SFHR, 56). \n\nIn Chapter Two, Cooper describes the formation of “The\nAmerican Colonists”—a committee of colored men organized\nby “the elder Raimond, Jacques and Vincent Ogé”\n(SFHR, 59). They sought the admission of a deputy to represent\nthem in the Constituent Assembly and demanded “the absolute\nequality of colored men and free Negroes with white colonists”\n(SFHR, 60). This reopened debates about the problem of equality\nof the races in the colonies and raised “A graver question, that\nof the abolition of the trade and slavery” (SFHR, 60). In\naddition to considering the “fate of the blacks” there are\nalso the other events of the Revolution in France including Bastille,\nthe Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, and the height of the\nreign of terror, (SFHR, 61). Cooper asserts, “It is certain\nthat if the whites had adopted a more conciliatory attitude toward the\nfree mulattos many disasters could have been avoided” (SFHR,\n63). But the colonist joined forces with the Massiac Club to\nprevent the emancipation of slaves and to establish a force in the\ncolonies that could resist any legislation against slavery. The\nresult was, in part, the establishment of a Colonial Committee that\nwould centralize colonial questions in the hands of a few and remove\nthem from the Friends of the Blacks, (SFHR, 65). Cooper is clear\nthat financial concerns outweighed ideals about freedom and racial\nequality. She argues that the establishment of this Colonial\nCommittee was indicative of the necessity to “slow down a\nrevolutionary moment menacing the whole of the West Indies”\ncoupled with a desire to protect the financial interests and national\nwealth of France insofar as “trade with Santo Domingo represented\ntwo thirds of the total trade of France” (SFHR, 66). \n\nThe Friends of the Blacks were “prepared to sacrifice\neverything for the success of their cause,” and the Massaic Club\ncolonialists “were just as dedicated to their detestable\ncause” (SFHR, 71). Barnave presented a decree (March\n1790), which contained the principle that the colonies were to provide\ntheir own constitution, thereby ending arbitrary administration. \nThe colonists then demanded independence, but “Without making any\ndistinction between the whites and the colored men, without even\nmentioning one or the other, they contented themselves in the famous\nArticle IV, with conferring civil rights upon ‘all property\nowners of twenty-five years of age,’ who possessed real estate,\nor lacking such property, had been domiciled in and had contributed to\nthe parish for two years” (SFHR, 71). Cooper notes that\nthe ambiguity of the article allowed landholding mulattoes to hope that\nthese civil rights applied to them “without assuring them any\nbenefit” (SFHR, 72). Furthermore, colored men in Paris\nwere alarmed by the silence of the decree on their particular\nrights. Just as mulattos were seeking the same rights as whites,\nBlacks would go on to claim the same rights as mulattos. The\nresult of the decree was resistance and insurrection. “In\nspite of all of these measures,” Cooper notes, “it was in\nvain that the Constituent Assembly and its Colonial Committee had hoped\nto save the colonies from danger of insurrections,” (SFHR, 77). \nThe decree of May 15, 1791 which accorded political rights to mulattoes\nborn of free parents and recognizing them as active citizens was a\ndefeat for the colonists, yet they refused to comply with it (SFHR,\n80). The white colonists revolted, the decree was retracted\n(though not altogether annulled), and the Friends of the Blacks and the\nJacobin Club were brought closer together. \n\nIn the third chapter Cooper documents the various Civil Commissions\nsent to Santo Domingo along with the resulting reports and decrees that\nfollowed with those visits. White colonists continued to act in\nopen opposition to any semblance of political equality (which they\nfeared might also lead to social equality) for mulattoes (SFHR,\n88). She notes, “…April 4th a new\nNational Law annulled the Constitutional Decree of September\n24th, 1791, conferred upon colored men and free Negroes\nequal political rights with whites, and ordered a new election, more in\naccord with principles of equality, of the colonial and parochial\nassemblies which had been reinvigorated by then to enforce the new Law\nthe [a]ssembly provided for the appointment of three new Civil\nCommissioners having dictatorial powers and supported by a sufficient\nmilitary force” (SFHR, 88). \n\nIn time the Commissioners “let the blacks do as they\nwished,” emancipation was proclaimed in the West and in the\nSouth, “Negroes everywhere refused to work, and economic\nconditions worsened to the extent that insubordination\nincreased” (SFHR, 95–97). In examining the correspondence\nof this particular period, Cooper notes the descriptions of\ninsurrections and loss of property, and the seemingly secondary\nattention to the question of slavery. She asserts, “Thus we\nfind one more argument in support of the idea, which inevitably grows\nstronger as one reads so many convincing documents, that the question\nof the emancipation of the slaves had only been considered and embraced\nby a few enthusiasts, idealists like Brissot and his friends…who\nhad only seen a problem to be resolved by humanity and theory where in\nfact a thorough practical preparation was necessary” (SFHR,\n98). \n\nCooper also outlines the events leading up to the rise in power of\nToussaint Louverture (whom she describes as “a grand\nfigure” “intelligent and capable” and “endowed\nwith a strong personality that towered over those of his\ncompanions” (SFHR, 101). A leader able to “see and\nforesee,” Louverture sent Sonthoax back to France followed by\nHédouville and Raimond. In a campaign against Rigaurd for\npower, Louverture facilitated massacres of mulattoes in the North\nand eventually “made himself master of all the Spanish\nterritory” (SFHR, 106). Expecting a strong response from\nFrance and Napoleon, Louverture forced Blacks back to work to increase\nthe prosperity of the island and “permitted no revolt, finishing\noff insurrectionists swiftly…” (SFHR, 108). In the\nend, Louverture would be sent to France where he died on April 7, 1803. Napoleon went on to reestablish slavery\nand slave trade in the French colonies. Cooper observes,\n“In truth, it seems that Napoleon never gave more than absent\nminded thoughts to the obviously complicated problem presented by that\ntoo distant island” (SFHR, 111). A new “war of\nextermination” broke out against the “last vestiges of the\nwhite race at Santo Domingo” (SFHR, 111). \nLouverture’s successor Dessallines declared the island\nindependent and restored the Indian name of Haiti “so that there\nwould no longer be reminders of the European occupation” (SFHR,\n111). \n\nIn her conclusion, Cooper reflects on the various factors that\ncomplicated the entire situation from the economic conditions in\nrevolutionary France to the issue of slavery and the problem of\nrace—a problem that was not simply Black and white, but also\ninvolved “the intermediate mulatto,” and finally, a\npolitical problem, (SFHR, 114). Cooper describes the political problem\nin this way, “The change in regime was not accepted in these\ndistant countries as it should have been, because it was not\nunderstood. The majority of the colonists remained royalists. And\nso did the blacks. A war of parties was added to the war of\nraces” (SFHR, 114). \n\nIn “The Ethics of the Negro Question” (1902) Cooper\nconfronts the hypocrisy of Christianity in America. According to\nCooper, the Negro “stands in the United States of America today\nas the passive and silent rebuke to the Nation’s Christianity, the\ngreat gulf between its professions and its practices, furnishing the\nchief ethical element in its politics, …[and pointing the\nfinger at so-called] ideals of civilization” (VAJC, 206). This\nsentiment is reiterated in “The Negro in American\nLiterature” where Cooper asserts that the color caste in this\ncountry is a “scathing rebuke to weak-eyed Christians who cannot\nread the golden rule across the color line” (VAJC, 145).  Cooper recounts the harsh circumstances under which the Negro is\nuprooted and transplanted to this “Christian” nation,\nreduced to chattel and beasts of burden for the purpose of producing\nwealth for white men and the economy of the nation (VAJC, 207).  Like\nFrederick Douglass and others, Cooper underscores this\nnation’s failure to adhere to the declaration that “all men are created equal” from the beginning. Her\nuse of language and imagery are worth quoting at length. She\nasserts:  \n\nCooper not only highlights the discontinuity between religion,\nfaith, reason, and conscience on the one hand and the atrocities of\nslavery on the other, she also exposes the white male slave owner as a\nrapist who fathers children by Black female slaves and then exploits\nthe labor of those children who must assume the slave status of their\nmothers. This is a constant point of emphasis by Cooper not only\nbecause of its prevalence during and after slavery, but also because\nof her own her lived experience. Added to all of this is the problem\nof lynching—adeptly described by Ida B. Wells-Barnett as “Our\nNational Crime”. \n\nCooper wrote “My Racial Philosophy” (1930) in response to\na survey distributed by Charles S. Johnson to Black college\ngraduates. In 1927 Johnson became chair of a newly formed social\nscience department at Fisk University. Other prominent members of the\ndepartment faculty at that time included now famed social scientists\nRobert E. Park and E. Franklin Frazier. The formation of this\ndepartment at Fisk was made possible by a $200,000 contribution from\nthe Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial—for whom Spelman College,\nthe renowned historically Black college for women in Atlanta, GA is\nalso named (Gasman 1999, 6). By 1930, Johnson was collecting data from\nthis survey taken by Cooper and numerous others, and by 1946 Johnson\nhad become the sixth president, though the first Black president, of\nFisk.  \n\nThe question to which Cooper was replying in Johnson’s 1930\nsurvey is (question # 65): “Have you a ‘racial\nphilosophy’ that can be briefly stated?” Cooper begins her\ntwo-page reply by emphasizing the fact that race and gender prejudice\nis often overlapping, particularly for Black women. The analysis\nof race and gender intersectionality dominates Cooper’s\nphilosophy, not only here, but throughout A Voice from the\nSouth. Here she asserts, “the whips and stings of\nprejudice, whether of color or sex, find me neither too calloused to\nsuffer, nor too ignorant to know what is due me” (VAJC, 236).\n Cooper adds that one would be mistaken to “imagine that\noppression goes only with color” and explains, “When I\nencounter brutality I need not always charge it to my\nrace” (VAJC, 236). Even more significant in Cooper’s\nracial philosophy is the correlation she draws between prejudice,\ncivilization, and our responsibility in the formation of our\ncivilization. Cooper claims that the brutality of prejudice is\n“chargeable to the imperfections in the civilization…for\nwhich as a teacher and a trained thinker I take my share in\nresponsibility” (VAJC, 236). \n\nAnna Julia Cooper was born into slavery as Annie Hayward in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina on August 10, likely in 1858 (though some sources date\nher birth in 1859) before the Civil War. Cooper describes her\nmother Hannah Haywood as “the finest woman” she had ever\nknown who despite being “untutored” was still able to\n “read her bible and write a\n little.”[8] \n Cooper presumes that her father was her\nmother’s master, adding that her mother “was always too\nmodest and shamefaced ever to mention him.” With this one\nsentence Cooper captures both the plights of enslaved Black women of\nthat time—being untutored and sexually exploited; as well as\nthe significant triumphs—learning to read and write against the odds\n(and in many cases against the law). \n\nAt the young age of nine, barely removed from slavery, Cooper (then\nAnnie Haywood) begins school at Saint Augustine Normal School in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina where she continued her education for about fourteen\nyears. During this time she also worked as a tutor and\nteacher. Cooper completed studies at what became Saint\nAugustine’s Normal Collegiate School in 1877 and then married\nGeorge Cooper. The newlyweds continued to study and teach at Saint\nAugustine’s, but George Cooper, who went on to become an\nEpiscopal priest, died two short years later. In a letter seeking\nadmission to Oberlin College in Ohio, Cooper lists the content of her\nprevious studies including English; Latin: Cesar (seven\nbooks), Virgil’s Aeneid (six books), Sallust’s\nCataline and Jugurtha, a few orations of\nCicero; Greek: White’s first lessons, Goodwin’s\nGreek Reader—including selections from Xenophon, Plato,\nHerodotus, and Thucydides, the Iliad; along with Algebra and\nGeometry. It is obvious that her education was deeply rooted in the\nhistory of Western philosophy and the classics. Cooper gains\nadmission and leaves Saint Augustine’s for Oberlin\nCollege in 1881 where she goes on to earn a B.A. in mathematics in 1884\nand then an M.A. for college teaching in 1887. \n\nAlthough Cooper’s affinity for the Western philosophical canon,\nlanguages, and advanced mathematics at times resulted in her being\nmisread as elitist, it must be noted that these academic and scholarly\nachievements are complemented by her lifetime commitment to education,\nactivism, and community service. The depth of this commitment is\nevidenced by her work as a tutor in North Carolina in her youth, and\nlater as a teacher at Saint Augustine’s College and Wilberforce College\nwhere she taught mathematics, literature, and modern languages. Cooper\nwould have many more years of teaching and administrative experience\nat M Street High School in Washington D.C., where she was appointed\nprincipal from January 2, 1902 to June 30, 1906. After a controversy\nat M Street High School, Cooper left Washington D.C. to teach for\nseveral years at Lincoln University in Missouri. The controversy\ncentered on claims about the immorality of the teachers and misconduct\namong students. It has been speculated that these charges were raised\nbecause some were disgruntled by Cooper’s commitment to teaching\nclassical texts and languages—an approach often associated with\nDu Bois’s educational philosophy rather than Washington’s emphasis on\nvocational training. But Louise Daniele Hutchinson has made the case\nthat Percy M. Hughes, the white director of Washington High Schools at\nthe time, played a role in this controversy insofar as he brought the\ncharges against Cooper. Despite public support for Cooper, the\nbrouhaha ultimately resulted in her not being reappointed as principal\nof M Street High School in 1906. Cooper did eventually return to teach\nat M Street from 1910 to 1930, before teaching at Frelinghuysen\nUniversity where she held the office of the president from\n1930 to 1941. \n\nIn addition to these educational and administrative contributions,\nCooper also did work at a War Camp in Indianapolis, supervised a\nplayground in West Virginia, supervised the Colored Settlement House in\nWashington D.C., and helped to facilitate the opening of the first YWCA\nchapter for Black women in Washington, D.C. She was also very active\nin the racial and gender uplift movement, including the Negro\nWomen’s Club Movement—playing a leadership role in the\nWashington Colored Woman’s League which eventually became a part\nof the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs. \nCooper was a speaker at the Hampton Conference in 1892, a speaker at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893, and she co-founded the Colored Women’s League in 1894 in Washington, D.C. She helped\norganize and also addressed the Pan African Conference in London in\n1900 (which later became the Pan African Congress) before touring\nEurope with her foster daughter Lula Love (visiting the Paris\nExposition, Oberammergau, Munich, and several cities in Italy). \nFurthermore, Shirley Moody-Turner has noted that Cooper was active in\nthe Hampton Folklore Society (working as an interim editor for the\nSouthern Workman) and the Washington Negro Folklore Society\n(as a founder and corresponding secretary). Some have claimed\nthat Cooper was the only female member of the American Negro Academy\n(though others have argued that she was not an official\nmember). \n\nIn 1925, at the age of 66, Cooper earned a Ph.D. at the Sorbonne in\nParis, France becoming the fourth Black American woman to earn a\nPh.D. The first three black women to earn the Ph.D. in the U.S.\ninclude Sadie T.M. Alexander (University of Pennsylvania), Georgianna\nRosa Simpson (University of Chicago), and Eva B. Dykes (Radcliff\nCollege) and each did so in 1921. Cooper recalls the Herculean\neffort required to complete her exams and thesis for the doctorate in\nThe Third Step. She took courses at La Guilde\nInternationale, Paris in French Literature, History, and Phonetics\nduring the summer months in 1911, 1912, and 1913. After starting\nher doctoral studies at Columbia University in New York in the summer\nof 1914, Cooper would then take guardianship of five children\n(her great-nieces and nephews) and in 1916 she purchased a five-bedroom\nhome in which to raise them. By 1917 she earned thirty-two\ncredits and was certified in French, Latin, and Greek at\nColumbia. However, Cooper could not meet the one-year residential\nrequirements as she was still working at M Street High School in\nWashington, D.C. She later decided to transfer her credits from\nColumbia to the University of Paris in France. In December\nof 1923 Cooper came down with influenza and asked for a sick leave from\nher teaching obligations. By February 1924 she selected her\nthesis topic, but then learned that she had only sixty days to return\nto her teaching post or be “dropped” from her position at M\nStreet High School. Cooper returned to her teaching position on\nthe sixtieth day and continued to do research and writing on the thesis\nat the Library of Congress on evenings and weekends. She defended\nher thesis on March 23, 1925 and received her diplôme de\nDocteur ès lettres de la Faculté de Paris on\nDecember 29, 1925 in a ceremony supported by the Alpha Kappa Alpha\nsorority at Howard University. \n\nCooper continued teaching at M Street High School until 1930. \nShe also taught at Frelinghuysen University, holding the office of the\npresident from 1930 to 1941. Over the decades various magazines and\nnewspapers published several of her commentaries on the state of the\nrace. Cooper lived to be 105 years old, residing in Washington\nD.C. until her death on February 27, 1964. Memorial services were\nheld in Raleigh, North Carolina where she is buried.
