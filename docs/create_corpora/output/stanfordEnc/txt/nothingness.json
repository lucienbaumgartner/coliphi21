But ever since Parmenides in the fifth century BCE,\nthere has been rich commentary on whether an empty world is possible,\nwhether there are vacuums, and about the nature of privations and\nnegation.\n\n\n\nThis survey starts with nothingness at a global scale and then\nexplores local pockets of nothingness. Let’s begin with a question that\nMartin Heidegger famously characterized as the most fundamental issue\nof philosophy.\n\n\n\nWell, why not? Why expect nothing rather than something? No\nexperiment could support the hypothesis ‘There is nothing’\nbecause any observation obviously implies the existence of an\nobserver. \n\nIs there any a priori support for ‘There is\nnothing’? One might respond with a methodological principle that\npropels the empty world to the top of the agenda. For instance, many\nfeel that whoever asserts the existence of something has the burden of\nproof. If an astronomer says there is water at the south pole of the\nMoon, then it is up to him to provide data in support of the lunar\nwater. If we were not required to have evidence to back our existential\nclaims, then a theorist who fully explained the phenomena with one set\nof things could gratuitously add an extra entity, say, a pebble outside our\nlight cone. We\nrecoil from such add-ons. To prevent the intrusion of superfluous\nentities, one might demand that metaphysicians start with the empty\nworld and admit only those entities that have credentials. This is the\nentry requirement imposed by René Descartes. He clears everything out and then\nonly lets back in what can be proved to exist. \n\nSt. Augustine had more conservative counsel: we should not start at\nthe beginning, nor at the end, but where we are, in the middle. We\nreach a verdict about the existence of controversial things by\nassessing how well these entities would harmonize with the existence of\nbetter established things. If we start from nothing, we lack the\nbearings needed to navigate forward. Conservatives, coherentists and\nscientific gradualists all cast a suspicious eye on ‘Why is there\nsomething rather than nothing?’. \n\nMost contemporary philosophers feel entitled to postulate whatever\nentities are indispensable to their best explanations of well accepted\nphenomena. They feel the presumption of non-existence is only plausible\nfor particular existence claims. Since the presumption only applies on\na case by case basis, there is no grand methodological preference for\nan empty world. Furthermore, there is no burden of proof when everybody\nconcedes the proposition under discussion. Even a solipsist agrees\nthere is at least one thing! \n\nA more popular way to build a presumption in favor of nothingness is\nto associate nothingness with simplicity and simplicity with\nlikelihood. The first part of this justification is plausible.\n‘Nothing exists’ is simple in the sense of being an easy to\nremember generalization. Consider a test whose questions have the form\n‘Does x exist?’. The rule ‘Always answer\nno!’ is unsurpassably short and comprehensive. \n\nIn Les Misérables, Victor Hugo contrasts universal\nnegation with universal affirmation: \n\nAs far as simplicity is concerned, there is a tie between the nihilistic rule\n‘Always answer no!’ and the inflationary rule ‘Always\nanswer yes!’. Neither rule makes for serious metaphysics. \n\nEven if ‘Nothing exists’ were the uniquely simplest\npossibility (as measured by memorability), why should we expect that\npossibility to be actual? In a fair lottery, we assign the same\nprobability of winning to the ticket unmemorably designated 4,169,681\nas to the ticket memorably labeled 1,111,111. \n\nIndeed, the analogy with a lottery seems to dramatically reverse the\npresumption of non-existence. If there is only one empty world and many\npopulated worlds, then a random selection would lead us to expect a\npopulated world. \n\nPeter van Inwagen (1996) has nurtured this statistical argument. In\nan infinite lottery, the chance that a given ticket is the winner is 0.\nVan Inwagen reasons that since there are infinitely many populated\nworlds, the probability of a populated world is equal to 1. Although\nthe empty world is not impossible, it is as improbable as anything can\nbe! \n\nFor the sake of balanced reporting, van Inwagen should acknowledge\nthat, by his reasoning, the actual world is also as improbable as\nanything can be. What really counts here is the probability of\n‘There is something’ as opposed to ‘There is\nnothing’. \n\nIs this statistical explanation scientific? Scientists stereotypically\noffer causal explanations. These are not feasible given the comprehensive reading of\n‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’. However,\nElliott Sober (1983) argues that scientists also accept “equilibrium\nexplanations”. These explain the actual situation as the outcome of\nmost or all of the possible initial states. There is no attempt to\ntrace the path by which the actual initial state developed into the\npresent situation. It suffices that the result is invariant. Why do I\nhave enough oxygen to breathe even though all the oxygen molecules\ncould have congregated in one corner of my room?  The physicist explains\nthat while this specific arrangement is just as likely as any other,\nthe overwhelming majority of arrangements do not segregate\noxygen.   \n\nMost philosophers would grant Peter van Inwagen’s premise that there\nis no more than one empty world. They have been trained to model the\nempty world on the empty set. Since a set is defined in terms of its\nmembers, there can be at most one empty set. \nHowever, medieval philosophers differentiated empty worlds by the\npower of places within those worlds (Grant 1981). The Condemnation of\n1277 forced Aristotelian philosophers to acknowledge the possibility\nof a void (to respect God’s omnipotence and the Christian doctrine of\ncreation from nothing). Most thinkers retained Aristotle’s assumption\nthat there was a unique center of the universe. If rocks were\nintroduced into such a world, they would all head toward their natural\nlocation at the center of the universe. (Aristotle uses this point to\nprovide a spectacular explanation of why there are not two earths;\nthey would have collided!) However, Nicole Oresme imagined a world\nwithout any center. He predicted the rocks would head toward each\nother. Since air, fire, earth, and water each had their own places in\nAristotle’s physics, fourteenth century philosophers could imagine\nworlds that differed as to which of these places to retain. The void\nwas rarely pictured as homogeneous. \nAristotle’s world was self-governed. Objects have powers that\ncollectively explain the order of the universe. Thinkers in the\nAbrahamic tradition replaced Aristotle’s invisible hand explanation\nwith God’s hidden hand. God dictated laws of nature to which He made\nperiodic adjustments (like clockmakers who regularly serviced their\ncreations, correcting the accumulating errors). Reflection on God’s\nperfection eventually made these divine interventions seem like an\nimpious slight against God’s foreknowledge. After the miracles were\nrescinded, God Himself was retired. What was left were the laws of\nnature. Since there was no longer any constraint on what laws had to\nbe, the actual world looks highly contingent. At first blush, this\nvindicates van Inwagen’s probabilistic argument. But the contingency\nof laws also raises the possibility of individuating empty worlds by\ntheir laws (Carroll 1994, 64). For instance, Isaac Newton’s first law\nof motion says an undisturbed object will continue in motion in a\nstraight line. Some previous physicists suggested that such an object\nwill slow down and tend to travel in a circle. This empty world\ndiffers from the Newtonian empty world because different\ncounterfactual statements are true of it. \n\nIf variation in empty worlds can be sustained by differences in the\nlaws that apply to them, there will be infinitely many empty worlds.\nThe gravitational constant of an empty world can equal any real number\nbetween 0 and 1, so there are more than countably many empty worlds.\nIndeed, any order of infinity achieved by the set of populated possible\nworlds will be matched by the set of empty worlds. \nJohn Heil (2013) is bemused by this War of the Possible Worlds. Having\ngiven up the Law Maker, we should give up the laws. Once we return to\na self-governed world, there will be no temptation to see the world as\na lucky accident. After all, we do not literally see states of affairs\nas contingent.  Contingency, unlike color or shape, is not\nperceptible. Nor is there any presumption for regarding states of\naffairs as contingent. According to Heil, ‘Why is there\nsomething rather than nothing?’ owes its urgency to a partisan\nbackground theory, not a neutral arbiter such as perception or\nmethodology. \nAlthough possible worlds became intensely popular among analytic\nphilosophers after revolutionary advances in modal logic in the 1960s,\nthey receive little attention from existentialists. Their discussion\nof objects is more in line with powers ontology advocated by\nHeil. Indeed, some existentialists picture nothingness as a kind of\nforce that impedes each object’s existence. Since there is something\nrather than nothing, any such nihilating force cannot have actually\ngone unchecked.  What could have blocked it? Robert Nozick (1981, 123)\ntoys with an interpretation of Heidegger in which this nihilating\nforce is self-destructive. This kind of double-negation is depicted in\nthe Beatles’s movie Yellow Submarine. There is a creature\nthat zooms around like a vacuum cleaner, emptying everything in its\npath.  When this menace finally turns on itself, a richly populated\nworld pops into existence. \n\nSome cultures have creation myths reminiscent of Yellow\nSubmarine. Heidegger would dismiss them as inappropriately\nhistorical. ‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’\nis not about the origin of the world. Increasing the scientific\nrespectability of the creation story (as with the Big Bang hypothesis)\nwould still leave Heidegger objecting that the wrong question is being\naddressed. \n\nSome disagree with van Inwagen’s assumption that each possible\nworld is as likely as any other (Kotzen 2013). There have been metaphysical systems\nthat favor less populated worlds. \n\nIndeed, the original purveyor of possible worlds, Gottfried Leibniz,\npictured possible things as competing to become actual. The more a\nthing competes with other things, the more likely that there will be\nsomething that stops it from becoming real.  The winners in Leibniz’s\nstruggle for existence are cooperative. They uniquely fit the niche\nformed by other things. This key hole into existence implicitly\nconveys information about everything.  The little bit that is not,\ntells us about all that there is. \n\nOn the one hand, this metaphysical bias in favor of simplicity is\nheartening because it suggests that the actual world is not too complex\nfor human understanding. Scientists have penetrated deeply into the\nphysical world with principles that emphasize parsimony and\nuniformity: Ockham’s razor, the least effort principle, the anthropic\nprinciple, etc. \n\nOn the other hand, Leibniz worried that the metaphysical bias for\nsimplicity, when driven to its logical conclusion, yields the\nembarrassing prediction that there is nothing. After all, an empty\nworld would be free of objects trying to elbow each other out. It is\nthe world that requires the least effort to produce (Just do nothing!) and\nsustain (Continue doing nothing!). So why is there something rather\nthan nothing? \n\nLeibniz’s worry requires a limbo between being and\nnon-being. If the things in this limbo state do not really exist, how\ncould they prevent anything else from existing?  \n\nLeibniz’s limbo illustrates an explanatory trap. To explain why\nsomething exists, we standardly appeal to the existence of something\nelse. There are mountain ranges on Earth because there are plates on\nits surface that slowly collide and crumple up against each other.\nThere are rings around Saturn because there is an immense quantity of\nrubble orbiting that planet. This pattern of explanation is not\npossible for ‘Why is there something rather than nothing’.\nFor instance, if we answer ‘There is something because the\nUniversal Designer wanted there to be something’, then our\nexplanation takes for granted the existence of the Universal Designer.\nSomeone who poses the question in a comprehensive way will not grant\nthe existence of the Universal Designer as a starting point. \n\nIf the explanation cannot begin with some entity, then it is hard to\nsee how any explanation is feasible. Some philosophers conclude\n‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’ is\nunanswerable. They think the question stumps us by imposing an\nimpossible explanatory demand, namely, Deduce the existence of\nsomething without using any existential premises. Logicians should\nfeel no more ashamed of their inability to perform this deduction than\ngeometers should feel ashamed at being unable to square the circle. \n\nDavid Hume offers a consolation prize: we might still be able to\nexplain the existence of each event even if it is impossible to explain\neverything all together. Suppose that the universe is populated with an\ninfinite row of dominoes. The fall of each domino can be explained by\nthe fall of its predecessor. \nBut what is responsible for the arrangement to begin with? Why is\nthere anything in our domain of discourse? There is a tradition of\ndenying that this kind of comprehensive questioning is\ncoherent. Principles that apply within a system need not be applicable\nto the system itself. \nIs there a world? Can worlds be counted in the way presupposed by\nmodal metaphysics? Doubts about absolute generality can descend from\nlogical theorizing about quantification (Rayo 2013). They can also\nbubble up from suspicions about abstraction (Maitzen 2012). A sortal\nsuch as KITTEN tells us the nature of a thing, thereby supplying\ncriteria for counting and persistence. THING is a dummy sortal. How\nmany things do you have when you have a capped pen? The question\ncannot be answered because you have not been given criteria governing\nwhether the cap and the pen count as separate objects. All questions\nabout existence must be relativized to sorts. Consequently, the\nquestion of why there is something rather than nothing is\nincomplete. Once we remedy the incompleteness with a sortal, the\nquestion will be answered by science. \nEmpiricists such as Hume deny that the existence of anything could be\nproved by reason alone. Rationalists have been more optimistic. Many\nhave offered\na priori proofs of God’s existence. Such a proof would double\nas an explanation of why there is something. If God exists, then\nsomething exists. After all, God is something. \n\nBut would God be the right sort of something? If we are only seeking\nan a priori proof of something (anything at all!),\nthen why not rest content with a mathematical demonstration that there\nexists an integer between a square and a cube? There must exist\nsuch an integer because 25 is a square and 27 is a cube and only one\ninteger can be between 25 and 27. Therefore, something exists.\nWhy does this come off as a mathematical joke? \n\nVan Inwagen’s answer is that we are actually interested in\nconcrete things. A grain of sand, a camel, and an oasis are\neach concrete entities. They are part of the causal order. In\ncontrast, abstract entities (numbers, sets, possible worlds) do not\ncause anything. Those who adopt the principle that only causes are\nreal will become nominalists; everything is concrete. \nA second characterization of concrete entities is in terms of\nlocatability; a concrete entity has a position in space or time. Since\nconcrete entities are situated, they have boundaries with their\nenvironment. (The only exception would be an entity that took up all\nspace or all time, say Nature.)   \n\nAdmittedly, points in space and time have locations. But concrete\nentities are only accidentally where and when they are. All concrete\nentities have intrinsic properties (which make their boundaries\nnatural rather than conventional, say Efird and Stoneham (2005,\n314)). Their natures are not exhausted by their relationships with\nother things. Max Black imagines twin iron spheres in an otherwise\nempty universe. The spheres are distinct yet have the same\nrelationships and the same intrinsic properties. \nAll material things are concrete but some concrete things might be\nimmaterial. Shadows and holes have locations and durations but they\nare not made of anything material. There is extraneous light in\nshadows and extraneous matter in holes; but these are contaminants\nrather than constituents. Cracks can spread, be counted, and\nconcealed. Once we acknowledge the existence of cracks, we get an\nunexpected transcendental explanation of why there is\nsomething: If there is nothing then there is an absence of\nanything. Therefore, there exists something (either a positive\nconcrete entity or an absence). \nOntological pluralists do not dismiss this proof as sophistry. Kris\nMcDaniel (2013, 277) thinks the proof is trivially correct. To address\na more interesting question, McDaniel follows Aristotle’s principle\nthat there are many ways of being. From the pluralist’s perspective,\ndebate over whether holes exist is equivocal. The friends of absences\nuse a broad sense of being. The enemies of holes speak from a higher\nlink in the chain of being. From this altitude, holes depend on their\nhosts and so cannot be as real. Alexius Meinong’s talk of subsistence\nalludes to the lowest level of being. “Why does anything\nsubsist?” is a perfectly legitimate question, according to\nMcDaniel. \n\nIf there are souls or Cartesian minds, then they will also qualify as\nimmaterial, concrete entities. Although they do not take up space,\nthey take up time. An idealist such as George Berkeley could ask\n‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’ even though\nhe was convinced that material things are not possible.  \nWilliam James denied that his defense of parapsychology provided a\nresource for answering, ‘How comes the world to be here at all\ninstead of the non-entity which might be imagined in its\nplace?’ Philosophy, be it natural or supernatural, can make no\nprogress on this issue “for from nothing to being there is no\nlogical bridge” (1911, 40). James concludes: “The question\nof being is the darkest in all philosophy. All of us are beggars here,\nand no school can speak disdainfully of another or give itself\nsuperior airs” (1911, 46). \n\nAlthough all concrete things are in space or time, neither space nor\ntime are concrete things. Where would space be? When would time occur?\nThese questions can only be answered if space were contained in\nanother higher space. Time would be dated within another time. Since\nthe same questions can be posed for higher order space and higher\norder time, we would face an infinite regress. \n\nThere is no tradition of wondering ‘Why is there space and\ntime?’. One reason is that space and time seem like a framework\nfor there being any contingent things. \n\nAbsolutists think of the framework as existing independently of what\nit frames.  For instance, Newton characterized space as an eternal,\nhomogeneous, three dimensional container of infinite extent.  He\nbelieved that the world was empty of objects for an infinite period\nprior to creation (setting aside an omnipresent God). An empty world\nwould merely be a continuation of what creation interrupted. \n\nOthers think the framework depends on what it frames.  Like Leibniz,\nAlbert Einstein pictured (or “pictured”) space as an\nabstraction from relations between objects.  Consequently, space can\nbe described with the same metaphors we use for family trees. Maybe\nspace grows bigger. Maybe space is curved or warped or has\nholes. There is much room to wonder why space has the properties that it\nhas. But since space is an abstraction from objects, answers to any\nriddles about space reduce to questions about objects. One can wonder why\nthere is space. But this is only to wonder why there are objects. \n\nAll concrete things appear to be contingent beings. For instance,\nthe planet Earth would not have existed had the matter which now constitutes\nour solar system formed, as usual, two stars instead of one. If no\nconcrete thing is a necessary being, then no concrete thing can explain the\nexistence of concrete things. \n\nEven if God is not concrete, proof of His existence would raise hope\nof explaining the existence of concrete things. For instance, the\nGenesis creation story suggests that God made everything\nwithout relying any antecedent ingredients. The story also suggests\nthat God had a reason to create. If this account could be corroborated\nwe would have an explanation of why there are some concrete\nthings. \n\nThis divine explanation threatens to over-explain the data. Given\nthat God is a necessary being and that the existence of God\nnecessitates the existence of Earth, then Earth would be a\nnecessary being rather than a contingent being. \n\nThe dilemma was generalized by William Rowe (1975). Consider all the\ncontingent truths. The conjunction of all these truths is itself a\ncontingent truth. On the one hand, this conjunction cannot be explained\nby any contingent truth because the conjunction already contains all\ncontingent truths; the explanation would be circular. On the other\nhand, this conjunction cannot be explained by a necessary truth because\na necessary truth can only imply other necessary truths. This dilemma\nsuggests that ‘Why are there any contingent beings?’ is\nimpossible to answer. \n\nRowe presupposes that an answer would have to be\na deductive explanation.  If there are ‘inferences to\nthe best explanation’ or inductive explanations, then there\nmight be a way through the horns of Rowe’s dilemma. \n\nThere also remains hope that Rowe’s dilemma can be bypassed by showing\nthat the empty world is not a genuine possibility. Then the retort to\n‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’ is\n‘There is no alternative to there being\nsomething!’.  \n\n ‘There might be nothing’ is false when read\nepistemically. (Roughly, a proposition is epistemically possible if it\nis consistent with everything that is known.) For we know that\nsomething actually exists and knowledge of actuality\nprecludes all rival epistemic possibilities.  But when read metaphysically,\n‘There might be nothing’ seems true. So ‘Why is\nthere something rather than nothing?’ is, so far, a live\nquestion.   \n The question is not undermined by the a priori status of\nknowledge that something exists. (I know a priori that\nsomething exists because I know a priori that I exist and\nknow this entails ‘Something exists’.)  Knowledge, even\na priori knowledge, that something is actually true is\ncompatible with ignorance as to how it could be true.   \n Residual curiosity is possible even when the proposition is known to\nbe a necessary truth.  A reductio ad absurdum proof that 1\n− 1/3 + 1/5 − 1/7 + … converges to π/4 might\npersuade one that there is no alternative without illuminating how it\ncould be true. For this brute style of proof does not explain how π\nwandered into the solution. (Reductio ad absurdum just shows\na contradiction would follow if the conclusion were not true.)  This\nraises the possibility that even a logical demonstration of the\nmetaphysical necessity of ‘Something exists’ might still\nleave us asking why there is something rather than nothing (though\nthere would no longer be the wonder about the accidentality of there\nbeing something). This leads Andrew Brenner (2016) to deny that\n‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’ is\nrestricted to contingent entities. Brenner argues the question is\nhighly ambiguous. At best there is only a family resemblance between\nthe questions under discussion. What appears to be disagreement is too\noften a verbal dispute. \n\nHenri Bergson maintained that nothingness is precluded by the\npositive nature of reality. The absence of a female pope is not a brute\nfact. ‘There is not a female pope’ is made true by a\npositive fact such as the Catholic Church’s regulation that all priests\nbe men and the practice of drawing popes from the priesthood. Once we\nhave the positive facts and the notion of negation, we can derive all\nthe negative facts. ‘There is nothing’ would be a\ncontingent, negative fact. But then it would have to be grounded on\nsome positive reality. That positive reality would ensure that there is\nsomething rather than nothing. \n\nHuman beings have a strong intuition that positive truths, such as\n‘Elephants are huge’ are more fundamental than negative\ntruths such as ‘Elephants do not jump’. The robustness of\nthis tendency makes negative things objects of amusement. Consider the\nProfessor’s remark during his chilly banquet in Lewis Carroll’s\nSylvie and Bruno Concluded. \n\nThe sentence sounded well, but somehow I couldn’t quite\nunderstand it … (chapter 22) \n\nHow can we perceive absences? They seem causally inert and so not\nthe sort of thing that we could check empirically. Negative truths seem\nredundant; there are no more truths than those entailed by the\nconjunction of all positive truths. The negative truths seem\npsychological; we only assert negative truths to express a frustrated\nexpectation. When Jean Paul Sartre (1969, 41) arrives late for his\nappointment with Pierre at the cafe, he sees the absence of Pierre but\nnot the absence of the Duke of Wellington. \n\nPhilosophers have had much trouble vindicating any of these\nintuitions. Bertrand Russell (1985) labored mightily to reduce negative\ntruths to positive truths. Russell tried paraphrasing ‘The cat is\nnot on the mat’ as ‘There is a state of affairs\nincompatible with the cat being on the mat’. But this paraphrase\nis covertly negative; it uses ‘incompatible’ which means\nnot compatible. He tried modeling ‘Not\np’ as an expression of disbelief that p. But\n‘disbelief’ means believing that something is not\nthe case. Is it even clear that absences are causally inert? Trapped\nminers are killed by the absence of oxygen. In the end Russell\nsurrendered his intuition that reality is positive.  In a famous\nlecture at Harvard, Russell concluded that irreducibly negative facts\nexist. He reports this nearly caused a riot. \n\nWere it not for the threat to social order, one might stand the\nintuition on its head: Negative truths are more fundamental than\npositive truths. From a logical point of view, there is greater promise\nin a reduction of positive truths to negative truths. Positive truths\ncan be analyzed as the negations of negative truths or perhaps as\nfrustrated disbelief. Positive truths would then be the redundant\nhanger-ons, kept in circulation by our well-documented difficulty in\ncoping with negative information. Think of photographic negatives. They\nseem less informative than positive prints. But since the prints are\nmanufactured from the negatives, the negatives must be merely more\ndifficult for us to process. \n\nAs difficult as negation might be psychologically, it is easier to\nwork with than the alternatives suggested by Henry Sheffer. In 1913,\nhe demonstrated that all of the logical connectives can be defined in\nterms of the dual of conjunction, now known as NAND (short for NOT\nAND). Sheffer translates ‘p NAND q’ as\n‘either not p or not q’.\n‘Not p’ is defined as ‘p\nNAND p’.  Sheffer notes that the dual of disjunction, NOR\n(short for NOT OR), can also define all the connectives. Sheffer\ntranslates ‘p NOR q’ as\n‘neither p nor q’. From a logical point\nof view, negation is dispensable. This raises hope that all of the\nparadoxes of negation can be translated away. \n\nBertrand Russell quickly incorporated NAND into Principia\nMathematica. Sheffer’s functions have also been a great economy\nto the assembly line symbol manipulation of computers (as witnessed by\nthe popularity of NAND gates and NOR gates).  However, human beings\nhave trouble achieving fluency with Sheffer’s connectives. Even\nSheffer translates them negatively. Psychologically, the phrases\n‘either not p or not q’ and\n‘neither p nor q’ are each heard as a\ndouble dose of negation rather than as an alternative to negation. \nBut we could let computers do our metaphysics just as we let them do\nour taxes.  The only serious objection is that the problems of\nnegation do not really go away when we translate into artificial\nlanguages. For instance, the challenge posed by negative existential\nsentences such as ‘Pegasus does not exist’ persists when\ntranslated as ‘Pegasus exists NAND Pegasus exists’.  Any\ndesire to make ‘Pegasus does not exist’ come out true\nwarrants a desire to make ‘Pegasus exists NAND Pegasus\nexists’ come out true. (Since classical logic does not permit\nempty names, the NAND existential sentence will not be true.) \n\nThe more general concern is that the problems which are naturally\ncouched in terms of negation persist when they are translated into a\ndifferent logical vocabulary.  Given that the translation preserves\nthe meaning of the philosophical riddle, it will also preserve its\ndifficulty. \n We engage in negative thinking to avoid highly complicated positive\nthinking.  What is the probability of getting at least one head in ten\ntosses of a coin? Instead of directly computing the probability of\nthis highly disjunctive positive event, we switch to a negative\nperspective. We first calculate the probability of a total absence of\nheads and then exploit the complement rule: Probability (at least one\nhead) = 1 − Probability (no heads). An apt anagram of NEGATIVISM\nis TIMESAVING. \n Some possible worlds are easier to contemplate negatively. Thales\nsaid that all is water. Suppose he was nearly right except for the\nexistence of two bubbles. These two absences of water become the\ninteresting players (just as two drops of water in an otherwise empty\nspace become interesting players in the dual of this universe). How\nwould these bubbles relate to each other? Would the bubbles repel each other?\nWould the bubbles be mutually unaffected? Deep thinking about gravity yields\nthe conclusion that the bubbles would attract each other! (Epstein\n1983, 138–9)  \n The hazard of drawing metaphysical conclusions from psychological\npreferences is made especially vivid by caricatures. We know that\ncaricatures are exaggerated representations. Despite the flagrant\ndistortion (and actually because of it) we more easily recognize\npeople from caricatures rather than from faithful portraits.   \n For navigational purposes, we prefer schematic subway maps over ones\nthat do justice to the lengths and curves of the track lines. But this\nis not a basis for inferring that reality is correspondingly schematic.   \n Our predilection for positive thinking could reflect an objective\nfeature of our world (instead of being a mere anthropocentric\nprojection of one style of thought). But if this objective\npositiveness is itself contingent, then it does not explain why there\nis something rather than nothing. For Bergson’s explanation to\nsucceed, the positive nature of reality needs to be a metaphysically\nnecessary feature.   \n\nThomas Baldwin (1996) reinforces the possibility of an\nempty world by refining the following thought experiment: Imagine a world\nin which there are only finitely many objects. Suppose each object\nvanishes in sequence. Eventually you run down to three objects, two\nobjects, one object and then Poof! There’s your empty\nworld. \n\nWhat can be done temporally can be done modally. There is only a small\ndifference between a possible world with a hundred objects and a\npossible world with just ninety-nine, and from there …. well,\njust do the arithmetic! \nCan the subtraction be completed if there necessarily are infinitely\nmany things?  Penelope Maddy (1990) claims that unit sets are concrete\nentities, sharing the location of their members. The existence of one\nconcrete entity would guarantee the existence of infinitely\nmany. Consequently, there would be no finite worlds.  \nBaldwin avoids this issue with a different definition. Concrete\nentities are violators of Leibniz’s principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. Concrete things may have exact duplicates. For\ninstance, Cameron Winklevoss could have a twin who PERFECTLY resembles\nhim (unlike his homozygotic twin Tyler Winklevoss). In contrast, the\nunit set comprised of Cameron Winklevoss cannot have a perfect\ntwin. All sets obey Leibniz’s principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles and so Baldwin counts them as abstract entities.  \nGeraldine Coggins (2010, chapter 4) objects that Baldwin’s definition\nof concreteness is inferior to the customary spatiotemporal definition. She\ndeems the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties as\ntoo problematic to ground the distinction between concrete and\nabstract objects. \nAnother concern is that infinite proliferation can be\nprecipitated by the constitution relation. Assume that each part of a\nconcrete entity is itself concrete. Also assume that concrete entities\nare infinitely divisible (as seems natural given that space is\ndense). An infinitely complex object cannot be nibbled away with any\nnumber of finite bites. \n\nGonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra (2013) suggests that we instead take big,\ninfinite bites. Instead of subtracting entity by entity, subtract by\nthe chunk (of infinitely composite entities). \n\nOur metaphysical calculations are subliminally influenced by how we picture\npossible worlds (Coggins 2010, chapter 3).  If possible worlds are envisaged as\ncontainers, then they can be completely emptied.  Similarly, if\npossible worlds are pictured as stories (say maximally consistent ways\nthings could have been), then our library will contain a tale lacking\nany concrete entities as characters. But if possible worlds are\npictured mereologically, as giant conglomerates of concrete objects\n(Lewis 1986), our subtraction falters before we reach zero. Similarly,\nif possible worlds require an active construction (say, Ludwig\nWittgenstein’s imaginary rearrangements of objects drawn from the\nactual world), then the very process of construction ensures that\nthere are some concrete objects in every possible world. \n\nSome kind of background theory of possible worlds is needed. For\nwithout this substantive guidance, the subtraction argument seems\ninvalid. More specifically, from a metaphysically neutral perspective,\nthe fact that it is possible for each object to not exist seems\ncompatible with it being necessary that at least one object\nexists. \n\nThe founder of modal logic, Aristotle, has special reason to deny that\n‘Necessarily (p or q)’ entails\n‘Necessarily p or necessarily\nq’. Aristotle believed that all abstract entities\ndepend on concrete entities for their existence. Yet he also believed\nthat there are necessary truths. The existence of any particular\nindividual is contingent but it is necessary that some individuals\nexist. \n\nScience textbooks teem with contingent abstract entities: the\nequator, Jupiter’s center of gravity, NASA’s space budget, etc.\nTwentieth century mathematics makes sets central. Sets are defined in\nterms of their members. Therefore, any set that contains a contingent\nentity is itself a contingent entity. Any set that contains Cameron Winklevoss is an\nabstract entity that has no weight or color or electric charge. But it\nstill depends on Winklevoss for its existence. \n\nMathematics can be reconstructed in terms of sets given the assumption\nthat something exists. From Cameron Winklevoss, set theorists can\nderive the set containing him, then the set containing that set, then\nthe set containing that larger set, and so on. Through arachnophilic\ncraftiness, all of mathematics can be reconstructed from sets. But\nfounding all of mathematics on Cameron Winklevoss would fail to\nreflect the necessary status of mathematical truth. Founding\nmathematics on a necessary being such as God would alienate\natheists. So ecumenical set theorists instead spin this amazing\nstructure from only the set that does not depend on the existence of\nanything: the empty set. This is the closest mathematicians get to\ncreation from nothing! \n\nThis does not avoid all controversy. Early set theorists and an array\ncontemporary metaphysicians reject the empty set. Yet the loveliness\nof the construction makes many of their colleagues receptive to Wesley\nSalmon’s ontological argument: “The fool saith in his heart that\nthere is no empty set. But if that were so, then the set of all such\nsets would be empty, and hence it would be the empty\nset.” \n\nE. J. Lowe (2013, 192) argues on behalf of the fool: Two sets are\nidentical exactly if they have the same members. So the identity of a\nset is grounded on the identity conditions of its members. In the\nabsence of members, the set is ill-defined. Mathematicians may wield\nit as a useful fiction. But utility should not be confused with\ntruth. Since mathematical statements such as ‘The first prime\nnumber after 1,000,000 is 1,000,003’ are necessary truths and\ncan only be rendered true by the existence of a contingent being, such\nas Cameron Winklevoss, Lowe concludes that there necessarily exists\nat least one contingent being. Consequently, the empty world is\nimpossible even if there are no necessary beings. \n\nThere are other metaphysical systems that make the existence of some\nconcrete entities necessary without implying that there are any\nnecessarily existing concrete things. In his Tractatus phase,\nLudwig Wittgenstein takes a world to be a totality of facts. A fact\nconsists of one or more objects related to each other in a certain\nway. By an act of selective attention, we concentrate on just the\nobjects or just the relations. But objects and relations are always\ninextricably bound up with each other. Since every fact requires at\nleast one object, a world without objects would be a world without\nfacts. But a factless world is a contradiction in terms. Therefore,\nthe empty world is impossible. \n\nNevertheless, the persuasiveness of the subtraction argument is not\nentirely hostage to background theories about the nature of possible\nworlds. Even those with metaphysical systems that guarantee the\nexistence of some concrete entities feel pressure to revise those\nsystems to accommodate the empty world, or at least to look for some\nloophole that would make their system compatible with Baldwin’s\nthought experiment.  \n\nConsider the combinatorialist David Armstrong. He eventually acquiesced\nto the empty world by relaxing his account of truthmakers. A\ntruthmaker is a piece of reality that makes a statement true.\nArmstrong believes that every contingent truth is made true by a\ntruthmaker and has wielded the principle forcefully against analytical\nbehaviorists, phenomenalists, nominalists, and presentists. Since\nthere can be no truthmaker for an empty world, Armstrong appears to\nhave a second objection to the empty world (supplementing the\nobjection based on his combinatorial conception of a possible\nworld). Yet Armstrong (2004, 91) instead claims that the empty world\ncould borrow truthmakers from the actual world. His idea is that the\ntruthmakers for possibilities are actual objects and that these actual\nobjects could serve as the truthmakers for the empty world. David\nEfird and Tom Stoneham (2009) object that cross-world truthmakers\nwould be equally handy to the analytical behaviorists, phenomenalists\nand their ilk. Whether or not Armstrong has contradicted himself, he\nhas illustrated the persuasiveness of the subtraction argument. \n\nAristotle assumes that universal generalizations have existential\nimport; ‘All gods are immortal’ implies that there are\ngods. Contemporary logicians agree that universal quantifiers have\nexistential import: pantheism, ‘All is god’, entails\ntheism, ‘There is a god’ . However, contemporary logicians\ndiffer from Aristotle in analyzing universal generalizations as\nconditionals.  They think ‘All gods are immortal’ has the\nform ‘For each thing, if it is a god, then it is\nimmortal’. So if there are no gods, the conditional is vacuously\ntrue. This explains why the atheist can consistently argue: All gods\nare immortal. Immortality is impossible. Therefore, there are no\ngods. \nContemporary logicians are also impressed by the intuitive equivalence\nbetween ‘All men are mortal’ and its contrapositive\n‘All immortals are non-men’.  This equivalence is\npredicted by the hypothesis that universal generalizations are\nconditionals. \nTolerance of vacuously true generalizations does not stop contemporary \nclassical logic from precluding an empty world.\nSince its universal quantifier has existential import, each of\nits logical laws imply that something exists. For instance, the\nprinciple of identity,\nEverything is identical to itself entails There exists\nsomething that is identical to itself. All sorts of attractive\ninferences are jeopardized by the empty world. \n\nLogicians do not treat their intolerance of the empty world as a\nresource for metaphysicians. They do not want to get involved in\nmetaphysical disputes. They feel that logic should be neutral with\nrespect to the existence of anything. They yearn to rectify this\n“defect in logical purity” (Russell 1919, 203). \n\nThe ideal of ontological neutrality has led some philosophers to\nreject classical logic. A direct response would be to challenge the\nexistential import of the classical quantifiers.  \nProponents of “free logic” prefer to challenge the\nexistential presupposition of singular terms (Lambert 2003, 124). In\nclassical logic, names must have bearers. Free logic lacks this\nrestriction and so countenances empty names as in ‘Sherlock\nHolmes is a detective’ and negative existentials such as\n‘Pegasus does not exist’.  Proponents of free logic\nsuggest that these departures are a necessary condition for not\ntrivially implying an existential proposition. Jan Heylen (2017)\nagrees but contends that free logic trivially implies other\nexistential sentences. He concludes that any deductive answer to the\nquestion will beg the question. The background logic will always\nintrude. \nIn any case, the changes recommended by free logicians would certainly\nundermine W. V. Quine’s (1953a) popular criterion for ontological\ncommitment. Quine says that we can read off our ontology from the\nexistentially quantified statements constituting our well-accepted\ntheories. For instance, if evolutionary theory says that there are\nsome species that evolved from other species, and if we have no way to\nparaphrase away this claim, then biologists are committed to the\nexistence of species. Since philosophers cannot improve on the\ncredentials of a scientific commitment, metaphysicians would also be\nobliged to accept species. \n\nSo how does Quine defend his criterion of ontological commitment\nfrom the menace looming from the empty domain? By compromise. Normally\none thinks of a logical theorem as a proposition that holds in all\ndomains. Quine (1953b, 162) suggests that we weaken the requirement to\nthat of holding in all non-empty domains. In the rare circumstances in\nwhich the empty universe must be considered, there is an easy way of\ntesting which theorems will apply: count all the universal\nquantifications as true, and all the existential quantifications as\nfalse, and then compute for the remaining theorems. \n\nIs Quine being ad hoc? Maybe. But exceptions are common for\nnotions in the same family as the empty domain. For instance,\ninstructors halt their students’ natural pattern of thinking about\ndivision to forestall the disaster that accrues from permitting\ndivision by zero. If numbers were words, zero would be an irregular\nverb. \n\nMany of the principles used to rule out total emptiness also preclude\nsmall pockets of emptiness. Leibniz says that the actual world must\nhave something rather than nothing because the actual world must be the\nbest of all possible worlds, and something is better than nothing. But\nby the same reasoning, Leibniz concludes there are no vacuums in the\nactual world: more is better than less. \n\nLeibniz also targets the possibility\nof there being more than one void. If there could be more than one\nvoid, then there could be two voids of exactly the same shape and size.\nThese two voids would be perfect twins; everything true of one void\nwould be true of the other. This is precluded by the principle of the\nidentity of indiscernibles: if everything true of x is true of\ny, then x is identical to y. \n\nA second problem with multiple voids arises from efforts to\nparaphrase them away. From the time of Melissus, there have been\narguments against the possibility of a void existing in the manner that\nan object exists: “Nor is there any void, for void is nothing, and\nnothing cannot be.” (Guthrie 1965, 104) If you say there is a vacuum in\nthe flask, then you are affirming the existence of something in the\nflask—the vacuum. But since ‘vacuum’ means an\nabsence of something, you are also denying that there is something in\nthe flask. Therefore, ‘There is a vacuum in the flask’ is a\ncontradiction. \n\nSome react to Melissus’s argument by analyzing vacuums as properties\nof things rather than things in their own right. According to C. J. F.\nWilliams (1984, 383), ‘There is a vacuum in the flask’\nshould be rendered as ‘The flask noths’. He does this in\nthe same spirit that he renders ‘There is fog in\nWinchester’ as ‘Winchester is foggy’ and\n‘There is a smell in the basement’ as ‘The basement\nsmells’. \n\nIf this paraphrase strategy works for vacuums, it ought to work for\nthe more prosaic case of holes. Can a materialist believe that there\nare holes in his Swiss cheese? The holes are where the matter is not. So to\nadmit the existence of holes is to admit the existence of immaterial\nobjects!  \nOne response is to paraphrase ‘There is a hole in the\ncheese’ as ‘The cheese holes’ or, to be a bit easier\non the ear, as ‘The cheese is perforated’. What appeared to\nbe a wild existential claim has been domesticated into a comment on the shape of the\ncheese. \n\nBut how are we to distinguish between the cheese having two holes as\nopposed to one? (Lewis and Lewis 1983, 4) Well, some cheese is singly\nperforated, some cheese is doubly-perforated, yet other cheese is\nn-perforated where n equals the number of holes in\nthe cheese. \n\nWhoa! We must be careful not to define\n‘n-perforation’ in terms of holes; that would\nre-introduce the holes we set out to avoid.  \nCan holes be evaded by confining ourselves to the process of perforation? \nSingle-hole punchers differ from triple-hole punchers by how they act; singlely\nrather than triply. \n \nThe difficulty with this process-oriented proposal that the product, a\nhole, is needed to distinguish between successful and merely attempted\nperforation. Furthermore, the paraphrase is incomplete because it does\nnot extend to holes that arise from processes such as looping. If the universe\npopped into existence five minutes ago, then most holes formed without\nany process. \nCan we just leave expressions of the form\n‘n-perforated’ as primitive, unanalyzed shape\npredicates? David and Stephanie Lewis (1983) note that this strands us with an infinite\nlist of primitive terms. Such a list could never have been\nmemorized. The Lewises do not see how\n‘n-perforated’ can be recursively defined without\nalluding to holes. \n\nThe paraphrase prospects seem equally bleak for being\n‘n-vacuumed’. Big meteorites pass through the\natmosphere in about one second leaving a hole in the\natmosphere—a vacuum in “thin air”. The air cannot\nrush in quickly enough to fill the gap. This explains why rock vapor\nfrom the impact shoots back up into the atmosphere and later rains\ndown widely on the surface. During a meteorite shower, the atmosphere\nis multiply vacuumed. But this is just to say that there are many\nvacuums in the atmosphere. \n\nThe trouble sustaining multiple voids may push us to the most\nextreme answer to ‘Why is there something rather than\nnothing?’, namely, ‘There must not only be something but\nthere must not be any emptiness at all!’. \n\nParmenides maintained that it is self-defeating to say that\nsomething does not exist. The linguistic rendering of this insight is\nthe problem of negative existentials: ‘Atlantis does not\nexist’ is about Atlantis. A statement can be about something only\nif that something exists. No relation without relata! Therefore,\n‘Atlantis does not exist’ cannot be true. Parmenides and\nhis disciples elaborated conceptual difficulties with negation into an\nincredible metaphysical monolith. \n\nThe Parmenideans were opposed by the atomists. The atomists said\nthat the world is constituted by simple, indivisible things moving in\nempty space. They self-consciously endorsed the void to explain\nempirical phenomena such as movement, compression, and absorption. \n\nParmenides’s disciple, Zeno of Elea, had already amassed an amazing\nbattery of arguments to show motion is impossible. Since these imply\nthat compression and absorption are also impossible, Zeno rejects the\ndata of the atomists just as physicists reject the data of parapsychologists. \n\nLess radical opponents of vacuums, such as Aristotle, re-explained\nthe data within a framework of plenism: although the universe is full,\nobjects can move because other objects get out of the way. Compression\nand absorption can be accommodated by having things pushed out of the way\nwhen other things jostle their way in. \nIn the Timaeus, Aristotle’s teacher Plato attempted to\ncombine atomism with plenism as a “likely story”.  The\natoms are the Platonic solids (regular, convex polyhedra), each having\na distinctive role in the composition of objects. Like an irreverently\nintelligent school boy, Aristotle objects that the Platonic solids\ncannot fill space. Every arrangement of Platonic solids yields the\nsort of gaps that one can more readily predict in a universe composed\nsolely of spherical atoms. \nAristotle agrees that atoms could fill space if they were all\ncubes. Pressing his luck, Aristotle goes on to claim that tetrahedra\ncan also complete space. It is testament to Aristotle’s subsequent\nauthority that this claim was accepted for seventeen hundred \nyears—despite being easily refutable by anyone trying to snugly\ncombine tetrahedral blocks. Almost any choice of shapes guarantees\ninterstitial vacua. This geometrical pressure for tiny vacua creates a\nprecedent for the cosmic void (which surrounds the material cosmos)\nand the intermediate empty spaces that provide a promising explanation\nof how motion is possible. \n\nYet Aristotle denied the void can explain how things move. Movement\nrequires a mover that is pushing or pulling the object. An object in a\nvacuum is not in contact with anything else. If the object did move,\nthere would be nothing to impede its motion. Therefore, any motion in a\nvacuum would be at an unlimited speed. This conflicts with the principle that\nno object can be in two separate places at the same time. \n\nAristotle’s refutation of the void persuaded most commentators for\nthe next 1500 years. There were two limited dissenters to his thesis\nthat vacuums are impossible. The Stoics agreed that terrestrial vacuums\nare impossible but believed there must be a void surrounding the\ncosmos. Hero of Alexandria agreed that there are no naturally occurring\nvacuums but believed that they can be formed artificially. He cites\npumps and siphons as evidence that voids can be created. Hero believed\nthat bodies have a natural horror of vacuums and struggle to prevent\ntheir formation. You can feel the antipathy by trying\nto open a bellows that has had its air hole plugged. Try as you might,\nyou cannot separate the sides. However, unlike Aristotle, Hero thought\nthat if you and the bellows were tremendously strong, you could\nseparate the sides and create a vacuum. \n\nHero’s views became more discussed after the Church’s\nanti-Aristotelian condemnation of 1277 which required Christian\nscholars to allow for the possibility of a vacuum. The immediate\nmotive was to preserve God’s omnipotence. God could have chosen to\ncreate the world in a different spot. He could have made it bigger or\nsmaller. God could have also chosen to make the universe a different\nshape. This possibilities entail the possibility of a vacuum. \nA second motivation is a literal reading of Genesis 1:1. This opening\npassage of the Bible describes God as creating the world from\nnothing. Such a construction seems logically impossible. Commitment to\nan illogical miracle jeopardized the Christian’s overarching\ncommitment to avoid outright irrationality.  If creation out of\nnothing were indeed a demonstrable impossibility, then faith would be\nforced to override an answer given by reason rather than merely answer\na question about which reason is silent. \nAll Greek philosophy had presupposed creation was from something more\nprimitive, not nothing. Consistently, the Greeks assumed destruction\nwas disassembly into more basic units. (If destruction into\nnothingness were possible, the process could be reversed to get\ncreation from nothing.) The Christians were on their own when trying\nto make sense of creation from nothing. (Ancient Chinese philosophers\nare sometimes translated as parallel believers in creation from\nnothing. JeeLoo Liu (2014) cautions that both the Daoist and\nConfucians are speaking about formlessness rather than\nnothingness.) \nCreation out of nothing presupposes the possibility of total\nnothingness.  This in turn implies that there can be some\nnothingness. Thus Christians had a motive to first establish the\npossibility of a little nothingness.  Their strategy was to start small\nand scale up. \n\nAccordingly, scholars writing in the aftermath of the condemnation of 1277\nproposed various recipes for creating vacuums (Schmitt 1967). One scheme was to\nfreeze a sphere filled with water. After the water contracted into\nice, a vacuum would form at the top. \n \nAristotelians replied that the sphere would bend at its weakest point. \nWhen the vacuists stipulated that the sphere was perfect, the rejoinder\nwas that this would simply prevent the water from turning into ice. \n\nNeither side appears to have tried out the recipe. If either had, then\nthey would have discovered that freezing water expands rather than\ncontracts. \nTo contemporary thinkers, this dearth of empirical testing is bizarre.\nThe puzzle is intensified by the fact that the medievals did empirically\ntest many hypotheses, especially in optics.  \n\nHero was eventually refuted by experiments conducted by Evangelista\nTorricelli and Blaise Pascal. In effect, they created a barometer\nconsisting of a tube partially submerged, upside down, in bowl of\nmercury. What keeps the mercury suspended in the tube? Is there an\nunnatural vacuum that causes the surrounding glass to pull the liquid\nup? Or is there no vacuum at all but rather some rarefied and\ninvisible matter in the “empty space”? Pascal answered\nthat there really was nothing holding up the mercury. The mercury\nrises and falls due to variations in the weight of the atmosphere. The\nmercury is being pushed up the tube, not pulled up by\nanything. \n\nWhen Pascal offered this explanation, Descartes wrote Christian\nHuygens (8 December 1647) that the hasty young man had the vacuum too\nmuch on his mind. (A more amusing translation of the letter has\nDescartes complaining that Pascal had too much vacuum in his head;\nalas, Descartes’ writing loses something in the original.)  Descartes\nidentified bodies with extension and so had no room for vacuums. If\nthere were nothing between two objects, then they would be touching\neach other. And if they are touching each other, there is no gap\nbetween them. \n\nWell maybe the apparent gap is merely a thinly occupied region of\nspace. On this distributional model, there is no intermediate “empty\nobject” that separates the two objects. There is merely unevenly spread\nmatter. This model is very good at eliminating vacuums in the sense of\nempty objects. However, it is also rather good at eliminating ordinary\nobjects. What we call objects would just be relatively thick deposits\nof matter. There would be only one natural object: the whole universe.\nThis may have been the point of Spinoza’s attack on vacuums (Bennett\n1980).  (Indian philosophers associate nothingness with lack of differentiation.\nThey may prefer to describe Spinoza’s world as a realm of nothingness dominated\nby a single overarching unity.) \n\nDescartes was part of a tradition that denied action at a distance. This\northodoxy included\nGalileo. He was distressed by Johannes Kepler’s hypothesis that the moon\ninfluences the tides because the hypothesis seems to require causal\nchains in empty space. How could the great Kepler believe something so\nsilly? After Isaac Newton resurrected Kepler’s hypothesis he eventually capitulated\nto orthodoxy and stuffed the space between the moon and the Earth with\nether. \n\nIndeed, the universality of Newton’s law of gravitation seems to\nrequire that the whole universe be filled with a subtle substance.\nHow else could the universe be bound together by causal chains?\nHunger for ether intensified as the wave-like features of light became\nestablished. It is tautologous that a wave must have a medium. \n\nOr is it? As the theoretical roles of the ether proliferated,\nphysicists began to doubt there could be anything that accomplished\nsuch diverse feats. These doubts about the existence of ether were\nintensified by the emergence of Einstein’s theory of relativity. He\npresented his theory as a relational account of space; if there were no\nobjects, there would be no space. Space is merely a useful abstraction.  \n\nEven those physicists who wished to retain substantival space broke\nwith the atomist tradition of assigning virtually no properties to the\nvoid. They re-assign much of ether’s responsibilities to space itself.\nInstead of having gravitational forces being propagated through the\nether, they suggest that space is bent by mass. To explain how space\ncan be finite and yet unbounded, they characterize space as spherical.\nWhen Edwin Hubble discovered that heavenly bodies are traveling away\nfrom each other (like ants resting on an expanding balloon),\ncosmologists were quick to suggest that space may be expanding.\n“Expanding into what?” wondered bewildered laymen,\n“How can space bend?”, “How can space have a\nshape?”, ….  \n\nHistorians of science wonder whether the ether that was loudly pushed\nout the front door of physics is quietly returning through the back\ndoor under the guise of “space”. Quantum field theory\nprovides especially fertile ground for such speculation. Particles are\ncreated with the help of energy present in “vacuums”. To\nsay that vacuums have energy and energy is convertible into mass, is\nto deny that vacuums are empty. Many physicists revel in the discovery\nthat vacuums are far from empty.  \n\nFrank Wilczek (1980), Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow (2010, 180)\nas well as Lawrence Krauss (2012) explicitly claim that this answers\nthe question of why there is something rather than nothing. The basic\nidea goes back to an issue raised by the symmetry of matter and\nanti-matter. Given that the symmetry implies equality, matter and\nanti-matter should have annihiliated each other. Creation should have\nbeen aborted. Why is there NOW something (particles) rather than\nnothing (mere energy in a quantum field)? This question was answered\nby calculations suggesting that there was about a billionth more\nmatter than anti-matter. Although it is still possible for the\nuniverse to be without particles, the slight numeric imbalance biases\nthe universe toward states in which there are many particles. A small\nrandom change can trigger a phase transition analogous to the\ntransformation of very cold liquid beer into solid beer when the cap of the bottle\nis popped (suddenly reducing the pressure in the bottle).  \nA proud physicist is naturally tempted to announce these insights\nthrough the bullhorn of metaphysics. But philosophers interested in\nthe logic of questions will draw attention to the role of emphasis in\nframing requests for explanations.  ‘Why did Eve eat\nthe apple?’, ‘Why did Eve eat the apple?’,\nand ‘Why did Eve eat the apple?’ are different\nquestions because they specify different contrast classes (van\nFraassen 1980, 127–130). Philosophers read ‘Why is there\nsomething rather than nothing?’ tenselessly as in\n\n‘Why is π an irrational number?’. The philosophers also\nread ‘something’ as a quantifier ranging over any concrete\nentity. The quantum vacuum is a concrete entity (in the sense\ndescribed in sections 4 and 7) and so is in the philosopher’s domain\nof discourse. But for rhetorical effect, physicists anachronistically\nback-date their domain of discourse to the things of nineteenth\ncentury physics. Thus the physicists wind up addressing\n‘Why is there some thing rather than\nnothing?’. \nPhilosophers complain of misleading advertising. They asked one\nquestion and the proud physicists answered a different question.\nLawrence Krauss defends the switch as an improvement. Often scientists\nmake progress by altering the meaning of key terms. Why stick with an\nintractable (and arguably meaningless) question? We should wriggle\nfree from the dead hand of the past and rejuvenate our curiosity with\nthe vocabulary of contemporary cosmology.   \nThe physicist turned philosopher, Rudolf Carnap (1950), recalls how\nthermodynamicists explicated “heat” into the more\nprecise concepts of temperature, thermal energy, and heat\ntransfer. Although the new terms are not synonymous with the old, they\nbear enough similarity to disarm the objection that the physicists are\nmerely changing the topic. Our questions, like our children, can\nmature without losing their identity over time. (The idea of there\nbeing two different questions being asked is pursued in Carroll 2012,\nOther Internet Resources.) \nDavid Albert is open to the possibility of old questions being\nimproved by new interests and discoveries. However, he denies that\nLawrence Krauss’s particular change of meaning constitutes an\nimprovement (2012, Other Internet Resources): \n\nAfter a mystical experience in 1654, Blaise Pascal’s interest in\nnothingness passed from its significance to science to the\nsignificance of nothingness to the human condition. Pascal thinks\nhuman beings have a unique perspective on their\nfinitude. His Pensées is a roller coaster ride surveying the\nhuman lot. Pascal elevates us to the level of angels by exalting in\nour grasp of the infinite, and then runs us down below the beasts for\nwittingly choosing evil over goodness. From this valley of depravity\nPascal takes us up again by marveling at how human beings tower over\nthe microscopic kingdom, only to plunge us down toward insignificance\nby having us dwell on the vastness of space, and the immensity of\neternity. \n\nFor in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison with the\nInfinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a mean between nothing\nand everything. Since he is infinitely removed from comprehending the\nextremes, the end of things and their beginning are hopelessly hidden\nfrom him in an impenetrable secret; he is equally incapable of seeing\nthe Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he is\nswallowed up. (Pensées sect. II, 72) \n\nPascal’s association of nothingness with insignificance and\nmeaninglessness was amplified by the Romantics. Their poetry\nde-emphasized salvation, seeking to immerse the reader in a raw\napprehension of nature, unmediated by reason. Kant further obscured\nGod by casting Him into the noumenal abyss, available only through\npractical faith rather than theoretical reason. \nAs among the first forthright atheists, Arthur Schopenhauer faced the\nfull force of ‘Why is there something rather than\nnothing?’. According to Schopenhauer, religion and rationalism\naim to reassure us that the universe has a design. Our astonishment\nthat there is anything betrays awareness that it is all a meaningless\naccident. \nReaders of Schopenhauer were presented with the awesome contingency as\nan actuality rather than a terrible possibility.  The experience\ncaptured the attention of William James (who had experimented with\nnitrous oxide to understand the oceanic philosophy of Georg Hegel and,\nin 1882, published the phenomenological investigation\nin Mind). James provides a simple recipe for eliciting the\nemotion: \nOne need only shut oneself in a closet and begin to think of the fact\nof one’s being there, of one’s queer bodily shape in the darkness\n… of one’s fantastic character and all, to have the wonder steal\nover the detail as much as over the general fact of being, and to see\nthat it is only familiarity that blunts it. Not only\nthat anything should be, but that this very thing\nshould be, is mysterious! (1911, 39)\n\n \nAnother close reader of Schopenhauer, Ludwig Wittgenstein,\ncharacterizes the phenomenology as exhausting the thrust of the riddle\nof existence. Instead of expressing a well-formed question, ‘Why\nis there something rather than nothing?’ is an expression of the\nmystical wonder \n6.44 It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that it exists.\n \n6.45 To view the world sub specie aeterni is to view it as a whole—as a limited whole.\nFeeling the world as a limited whole—it is this that is mystical. \n6.5 When an answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question—the riddle does not\n exist. (From Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus) \nThis emotional characterization persists into Wittgenstein’s later\nphilosophy. In Lectures on Ethics, Wittgenstein uses the language of\nseeing-as. ‘Why is there something rather than nothing?’\nis a prompt to see the world as a miracle. This gestalt switch is not\na mistake. Nor is it an insight. Even the logical positivists were\nwilling to grant the question has emotive meaning (just not cognitive\nmeaning). \nThe characteristic phenomenology of the question has also been\nsuggested as a resource in explaining why we fail to recognize the\nradical ambiguity of the question.  Andrew Brenner (2016, 1319)\nconjectures that the multiplicity of interpretations is masked by the\nemotional unity. \nThinkers in the tradition of Phenomenology retained Schopenhauer’s\nconviction that the emotion harbors a metaphysical insight. Instead of\ntossing the question into the emotivist waste basket, like the logical\npositivists, or lapsing into quietism, like Wittgenstein,\nexistentialists provide detailed treatments of the awe expressed by\nthe ultimate question. They built on Schopenhauer’s literary approach\nto philosophy, depicting the emotion in plays and novels such as\nSartre’s Nausea. \n\nIn The Concept of\nDread, Søren Kierkegaard (1844) claims that nothingness wells up\ninto our awareness through moods and emotions.  Emotions are\nintentional states; they are directed toward something. If angered, I\nam angry at something. If amused, there is something I find\namusing. Free floating anxiety is often cited as a counterexample. But\nKierkegaard says that in this case the emotion is directed at\nnothingness. \n\nAccording to Heidegger, we have several motives to shy away from the\nsignificance of our emotional encounters with nothingness. They are\npremonitions of the nothingness of death. They echo the groundlessness\nof human existence. \n\nSome have hoped that our recognition of our rootlessness would\nrescue meaning from the chaos of nothing. But Heidegger denies\nus such solace. \n\nHeidegger does think freedom is rooted in nothingness. He also says\nwe derive our concept of logical negation from this experience of\nnothing. This suggests a privileged perspective for human beings.\nWe differ from animals with respect to nothing.  \nSince Heidegger thinks that animals do not experience nothingness, he\nis committed to skepticism about animal reasoning involving\nnegation. Consider the Stoic example of a dog that is following a\ntrail. The dog reaches a fork in the road, sniffs at one road and\nthen, without a further sniff, proceeds down the only remaining\nroad. The Stoics took this as evidence that the dog has performed a\ndisjunctive syllogism: “Either my quarry went down this road or\nthat road. Sniff—he did not go down this road.\nTherefore, he went down that road.” Heidegger must discount this\nas anthropomorphism. \n\nMany biologists and psychologists side with the Stoic’s emphasis on\nour continuity with animals. They deny that human beings have a\nmonopoly on nothingness. A classic anomaly for the stimulus-response\nbehaviorist was the laboratory rat that responds to the absence of a\nstimulus:  \n\nThese anomalies for behaviorism fill rationalists with mixed\nemotions. On the one hand, the experiments refute the empiricist\nprinciple that everything is learned from experience. On the other\nhand, the experiments also constitute a caution against\nover-intellectualizing absences. A correct explanation of emotional\nengagement with absences must be more general and cognitively less\ndemanding than rationalists tend to presuppose. Even mosquito larvae\nsee shadows. Doubts about whether they have consciousness do not make\nus doubt that they see shadows. So the perception of absences cannot\ndepend on consciousness or any other advanced mental state. Perhaps\nthe earliest form of vision was of these absences of light. So instead\nof being a pinnacle of intellectual sophistication, cognition of\nabsences may be primal. \nExistentialists tend to endorse the high standards assumed by\nrationalists. Their disagreement with the rationalists is over whether\nthe standards are met.  The existentialists are impressed by the\ncontrast between our expectations of how reality ought to behave and\nhow it in fact performs. \nThis sense of absurdity makes existentialists more accepting of\nparadoxes. Whereas rationalists nervously view paradoxes as a\nchallenge to the authority of reason, existentialists greet them as\nopportunities to correct unrealistic hopes. Existentialists are fond\nof ironies and do not withdraw reflexively from the pain of\ncontradiction.  They introspect upon the inconsistency in the hope of\nachieving a resolution that does justice to the three dimensionality\nof deep philosophical problems. For instance, Heidegger is sensitive\nto the hazards of saying that nothing exists. Like an electrician who\nmust twist and bend a wire to make it travel through an intricate\nhole, the metaphysician must twist and bend a sentence to probe deeply\ninto the nature of being. \nRudolf Carnap thinks Heidegger’s contorted sentences malfunction.  To\nillustrate, Carnap quotes snippets from Heidegger’s What is\nMetaphysics?: \n\nThis paragraph, especially the last sentence, became notorious as a\nspecimen of metaphysical nonsense. \nThe confusion caused by Heidegger’s linguistic contortions is\nexacerbated by separating them from their original text and herding\nthem into a crowded pen. There is a difference between a failure\nto understand and an understanding of failure. The real test for\nwhether Heidegger’s sentences are meaningless is to see what can be\nmade of them in action, applied to the questions they were designed to\nanswer.  \nCarnap also needs to consider the possibility that Heidegger’s\nsentences are illuminating nonsense. After all, Carnap was patient\nwith the cryptic Wittgenstein. In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein\nspeaks like an oracle. He even characterized his carefully enumerated\nsentences as rungs in a ladder that must be cast away after we have\nmade the ascent and achieved an ineffable insight. And Wittgenstein\nmeant it, quitting philosophy to serve as a lowly schoolmaster in a\nrural village. \n\nOther critics deny that What is Metaphysics? suffers from an\nabsence of meaning. Just the reverse: they think Heidegger’s passages\nabout nothing involve too many meanings. When Heidegger\nconnects negation with nothingness and death, these logicians are put\nin mind of an epitaph that toys with the principle of excluded middle:\nMrs Nott was Nott Alive and is Nott Dead. According to these\ncritics, Heidegger’s writings can only be understood in the way we\nunderstand the solution to equivocal riddles: \n\n(Leeming, 1953, 201) \n\nThe answer, Nothing, can only be seen through a kaleidoscope\nof equivocations. \nSome of the attempts to answer ‘Why is there something rather\nthan nothing?’ equivocate or lapse into meaninglessness.  The\ncomedic effect of such errors is magnified by the fundamentality of\nthe question.  Error here comes off as pretentious error. \nThose who ask the question ‘Why is there something rather\nthan nothing?’ commonly get confused. But the question\nitself appears to survive tests for being\nmerely a verbal confusion.  \nIn any case, the question (or pseudo-question) has helped to hone the\ndiagnostic tools that have been applied to it. As the issue gets\nshaped and re-shaped by advances in our understanding of\n‘is’, quantification and explanatory standards, it becomes\nevident that the value of these diagnostic tools is not exhausted by\ntheir service in exposing pseudo-questions. For genuine questions\nbecome better understood when we can discriminate them from their\nspurious look-alikes.","contact.mail":"roy.sorensen@austin.utexas.edu","contact.domain":"austin.utexas.edu"}]
