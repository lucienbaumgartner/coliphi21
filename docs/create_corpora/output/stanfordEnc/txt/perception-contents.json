For example, suppose you are looking into a\npiano at the array of hammers and strings. There will be a way these\nthings look to you when you see them: they will look to have a certain\nshape, color, texture, and arrangement relative to one another, among\nother things. Your visual experience conveys to you that the piano has\nthese features. If your experience is illusory in some respect then\nthe piano won't really have all those features. But even then, there\nwill still be something conveyed to you by your experience. Three main\nquestions will be addressed in this entry. First (Sections\n1–2), what are contents and what is their relation to\nexperiences?  Second (Sections 3–7), which contents are contents\nof experience?  Finally (Section 8), in virtue of what do experiences\nhave contents, when they do?\n\n\n\nThis entry will focus exclusively on the contents of perceptual\nexperiences. It is definitional of experience, as the term is\nused here, that they have some phenomenal character, or more briefly,\nsome phenomenology. The phenomenology of an experience is what it is\nlike for the subject to have it. At any given waking moment, one\nnormally has experiences in some (perhaps all) of the five sense\nmodalities, along with proprioceptive experience of some sort. Like\noccurrent emotions and background moods, these contribute to one's\noverall experience. Each of five sense modalities seems to be\naccompanied by a distinctive kind of phenomenology. Sometimes the\nboundaries between them can be hard to draw, for example between\nolfactory and gustatory phenomenology, kinesthetic experience and\nhaptic-tactile experience (that is, tactile experiences involving\nmovement rather than just pressure sensation), and perhaps, in some\ncases, between the latter two and visual experience (on the last point\nsee Press et al. 2004, Kennett et al. 2001,\nFotopoulou et al. 2009). Despite these difficulties, some\nrough distinctions can be drawn: the difference between seeing red and\nseeing blue is not a difference in how things sound, or in how one's\nbody feels. \n\nIn what follows, “experiences” will be restricted to\nexperiences in any of the five modalities or kinesthetic experience or\nsome combination. In the analytic tradition, most of the questions\ndiscussed in this entry have been addressed with regard to visual\nexperience and pain. In contrast, the phenomenological tradition\nexplored similar questions with respect to other modalities. For\ninstance, Husserl's exploration of auditory experience of hearing a\nmelody is central to his discussion of the experience of time (see\nthe entries\n on phenomenology,\n auditory perception,\n and the perception of time). \n In principle, however, the questions addressed here could be raised\nwith respect to any kind of experience. \n\nWhen one speaks of the contents of a bucket, one is talking about what\nis spatially inside the bucket.  An analogous use of “the\ncontents of perception” would pick out what is ‘in the\nmind’ when one has a perceptual experience. In contrast, when\none speaks of the contents of a newspaper, one is talking about what\ninformation the newspaper stories convey. Most contemporary uses\nof “the contents of perception” take such contents to be\nanalogous to the contents of a newspaper story, rather than the\ncontents of a bucket. This notion of content can straightforwardly\naccommodate the idea that there is such a thing as the\n‘testimony of the senses’. \n\nOne influential version of the idea that the contents of perception\nare analogous to the contents of a newspaper story holds that the\ncontents of an experience are given by the conditions under which it\nis accurate. What an experience conveys to the subject, according to\nthis conception, is that those conditions are satisfied. \n\nOn the conception of contents as given by accuracy conditions, there\nis a broad analogy between the contents of experience and the contents\nof thoughts and utterances, in that both contents are assessable for\naccuracy. Suppose I utter the sentence “Dogs are lively, loyal\ncreatures” and thereby express my belief that dogs are lively,\nloyal creatures. The content of my utterance is what I assert, and the\ncontent of my belief is what I believe—in both cases, that dogs\nare lively, loyal creatures. Usually these contents are thought of as\nsome kind of proposition—an abstract object that is the kind of\nthing that can be true or false (see the entry\n on structured propositions). \n Notice that both the utterance and the belief are assessable for\ntruth: their content is true just in case dogs really are lively,\nloyal creatures. \n\nIn the case of beliefs and utterances, it is not just their contents\nthat are assessable for accuracy (where accuracy is truth); the\nbeliefs and utterances themselves are as well. A belief or utterance\ninherits its truth-value from the truth-value of its content. This\nstands in contrast to desires or hopes, which may have contents that\nare assessable for accuracy, but are not themselves so assessable. If\nexperiences have accuracy conditions, then they are like beliefs and\nutterances in this respect, and unlike desires and hopes. \n\nThe conception of the contents of experience as given by its accuracy\ncondition is initially motivated by the idea that one can be misled by\none's experiences. Suppose you see a fish while unwittingly looking in\na mirror. It may look as if there is a red fish in front of you, when\nin fact the red fish you see is behind you and there is no fish at all\nin front of you. Similarly, in auditory or olfactory hallucinations,\none may seem to hear voices when in fact no one is speaking, or to\nsmell an odor when in fact nothing is emitting that smell. In phantom\nlimb pain, one feels pain as located where one's limb used to be but\nis no longer. These are cases of being misled by one's senses, and it\nis natural to say that in these cases things are not as they appear to\nbe. \n\nOnce one recognizes the datum that one can be misled by one’s\nsenses, it is a further claim that experiences themselves can be\nassessed for accuracy. It is a further claim, because one might be\nmisled by something that is not itself assessable for accuracy: e.g.,\none might be misled by the car in the driveway into thinking that your\nneighbor is home. So the fact that something plays the role of\nmisleading you does not show that it is assessable for accuracy.  But\nin the case of experiences, this further claim is motivated in the\nfollowing way. Given an experience—either one we actually have,\nor a hypothetical one—we at least sometimes have intuitions\nabout whether the experience is accurate (“veridical”) or\ninaccurate (“falsidical”). To this extent, we seem to be\nable to assess experiences for accuracy. \n\nWhen we assess an experience as accurate or inaccurate, we consider\nhow things are in the world. This suggests that experiences which\ncan be assessed for accuracy are associated with accuracy\nconditions: conditions under which the experience is\naccurate. When we have intuitions about whether an experience is\naccurate, we at least sometimes also have intuitions about the\nconditions under which it would be accurate. (For discussion of such\nintuitions, see Siewert (1998), chapter 7). Going with this, we seem\nto have intuitions about when experiences are incorrect. \n\nIn large part, our intuitions about when experiences are accurate\nconcern objects and properties. For instance, many have the intuition\nthat the following experience is falsidical: you see a fish that\nappears blue to you, but is actually red. According to the intuition,\nthe fish's failing to be blue suffices for the experience to be\nfalsidical. Intuitively, for the experience to be accurate, the fish\nin question must really be blue. It is an open question how specific\nand how extensive such intuitions are, hence to what extent such\nintuitions can reveal which accuracy conditions experiences have,\nassuming that they have accuracy conditions at all. But so long as\nthere are some such intuitions, there is a prima facie case for\nexperiences having accuracy conditions. \n\nSome philosophers deny that experiences have accuracy conditions. Such\nphilosophers must offer a different account of what is happening in\ncases where one is misled by one's senses, and they must dismiss or\nexplain away putative intuitions about the accuracy or inaccuracy of\nexperiences. A natural way to do so is to confine accuracy and\ninaccuracy to the level of belief, further downstream from\nexperience. \n\nThere are a number of positions that deny that experiences have\naccuracy conditions. All these positions deny this claim on the\ngrounds that it is not supported by either the metaphysics of\nexperience or by its phenomenology. The positions differ, however, on\ntheir positive views of the metaphysics and phenomenology of\nexperience. \n\nThe first position is the view that experiences are raw feels, or\nsensory affectations of the subject, that do not purport to represent\nthe world in any way at all. The eighteenth-century \n philosopher Thomas Reid \n held a view of this sort: Reid argued that experiences have a sensory\npart that is a mere raw feel, and that is independent of judgments\nabout how things are in the environment. (He took the latter\nessentially to involve concepts). One might, on this view, speak more\nbroadly about experiences as having two parts, sensory part and a\njudgment part; or one might speak more narrowly about experience as\nbeing limited to the sensory part that is typically accompanied by\njudgment. Which way one speaks is merely a matter of terminology. The\ncore feature of the view is its cleavage between the sensory aspect of\nexperiences, on the one hand, and assessability for accuracy, on the\nother. Given a judgement that occurs simultaneously with a sensation,\none could in principle make that very same judgment without having any\nsensation, and one could in principle have those very sensations\nwithout making any judgments. That is the force of saying that these\ntwo aspects, sensation and judgment, are independent.  If experiences\nare understood narrowly as being limited to the sensory part, then\nthey are not assessable for accuracy; and if they are understood\nbroadly as having both a sensory part and a judgmental part, then it\nis only the latter that is assessable for accuracy. \n\nThe second position is a version of adverbialism about visual\nexperiences, according to which such experiences are nothing more than\nmodifications of a subject that can be characterized by specialized\nadverbs specifying how one is visually\n‘appeared-to’. E.g., normally, when one sees a red tomato,\none is appeared to red-ly and round-ly. Visual experience, on this\nview, does not by itself even purport to present one with objects or\ntheir properties. There are thus no accuracy conditions associated\nwith such experiences. Instead, on this view, to be misled by one's\nsense is to end up with a false belief that is caused by one's\nexperience.  (For further discussion of adverbialism, see \n the problem of perception; \n also Chisholm 1957, Ducasse 1942, Tye 1984, Sellars 1975, and for\ncritical discussion, Jackson 1977). Strictly speaking, it should be\nnoted that so long as the core thesis of adverbialism is that\nexperiences are modifications or properties of the subject,\nadverbialism leaves open whether experiences are assessable for\naccuracy or not. For all that core thesis says, being appeared-to\nF-ly could be a way of representing that something is\nF. Historically, adverbialists’ main motivation was to\noppose the act-object conception of experience, according to which\nexperiences are structured by an act of awareness, on the one hand,\nand an object of awareness, on the other. Early formulations of view\npresented it as a view according which experiences were not assessable\nfor accuracy. \n\nThere is a third position that denies that experiences have accuracy\nconditions. This position starts with the claim that some experiences\nconsist in a chunk of the environment—for instance, a lavender\nbush—being perceptually presented to a subject, so that both the\nlavender bush and the perceptual relation between it and the subject\nare constituents of the experience. (Note that this is more specific\nthan the view that says merely that perception of public\nobjects is ‘direct’. That view is silent on what the\nnature of perceptual experience is). According to one version of this view, when you\nsee a lavender bush, some of its properties are presented to you, and\nyour experience consists in your being so related to the bush and\nthose of its properties that are presenting themselves to you. You\ncould have an experience that was indistinguishable from one of so\nseeing that very lavender bush: as it might be, an experience of\nseeing a different lavender bush, or a hallucination that was\nindistinguishable from the original experience. But neither of these\nexperiences, according to this view, would be the same sort of\nexperience as the experience of seeing the original lavender\nbush. Martin (2006) and Smith (2002) call this view\n“naïve realism”. Another version of this approach, developed by Johnston (2006) and (2014), develops the idea that perceivers are presented with instances of properties rather than with universals. Note that both versions are simply silent\non the nature of hallucinatory experiences. (For more on naïve\nrealism see the entry on\n  the disjunctive theory of perception). \n\nAs stated so far, naïve realism is neutral on whether any\nexperiences have accuracy conditions. A version of the view, however,\nexplicitly denies this. This version holds that experiences are\nanalogous to chunks of the environment that clearly lack accuracy\nconditions. The lawn chair on the deck is not the kind of thing that\ncan be accurate or inaccurate (though it may figure in the accuracy\nconditions of an utterance, such as an utterance of “that is a\nlawn chair”). Travis (2004, 2013) develops naïve realism in just\nthis way. He also offers further reasons for denying that experiences\nhave accuracy conditions. Travis agrees that in having an experience\none may represent that such-and-such is the case. He holds, however,\nthat there is no unique ‘taking’ associated with an\nexperience, and experience is only ever an input to representation,\nnever the result of it. One of Travis's examples is this: if you see\nSid and Pia touch hands at the dinner table, you make take them to be\ntrysting. But considered independently of this ‘taking’,\nyour experience simply consists in being presented with an unrepeatable, particular chunk of the\nenvironment, namely Sid and Pia at the table touching hands. (The\nnotion of being ‘presented with’ is left as\nprimitive). Accuracy conditions come into the picture only after you\ntake the environment as it is presented to you to be some specific, potentially repeatable\nway. So according to Travis, the experience does not map onto any\nunique set of accuracy conditions. Since illusions involve inaccuracy,\nby Travis's lights illusory experiences are experiences that have been\n‘taken’ in such a way that the ‘taking’ is\nfalse. \n\nA fourth position that denies that experiences have accuracy\nconditions says that experiences are raw feels, but also holds that\nall experiences have the same structure as perception of objects. On\nthis view, experience consists in immediately perceiving private\nobjects known as sense-data. According to sense-datum\ntheories, when your experience is a case of perceiving a public\nobject, such as a white wall that looks red, you indirectly\nperceive the wall by immediately perceiving a red sense-datum. In\ngeneral, sense-data really have the properties that public objects\nlook to have. In this way your having (i.e., immediately perceiving)\nthe sense-data you do is supposed to account for what it is for a\npublic object to appear to you to be a certain way; and you have\nsense-data whether or not there is any public object that you\nindirectly perceive by immediately perceiving them. \n\nIt should be noted that if the core commitment of sense-datum theories\nis that one immediately perceives mental objects in experience, then\nsense-datum theories are neutral on whether experiences are assessable\nfor accuracy. From the fact that one perceives (or immediately\nperceives) a particular object (be it a public object or a private\nmental one), nothing at all follows about whether the experience of so\nperceiving is assessable for accuracy or not (for more on sense-datum\ntheories, see the entries on\n sense data \n and the problem of perception). \n Jackson (1977) defends a version of the sense-datum view according to\nwhich experiences are not assessable for accuracy. \n\nAll four of these positions could be seen as offering construals of\nthe contents of the perceiver's mind, where these are analogous to the\ncontents of a bucket. Such construals contrast with the newspaper\nmodel of perceptual contents, and more specifically with the\nconception of contents as the accuracy conditions of\nexperience. Henceforth ‘the contents of experience’ will\nbe restricted to a notion that says that the contents of an experience\nare the conditions of accuracy associated with it. The claim that\nexperiences have contents in this sense is substantive, and, as we\nhave seen, is denied by some philosophers. But many philosophers\naccept that experiences have contents in this sense, and this\nconception of the contents of experience dominates the recent\nphilosophical literature on perception. Defenses of the thesis\nthat experiences have contents can be found in Byrne 2009, Pautz 2010, Schellenberg 2011,\nand Siegel 2010a and 2010b, and criticisms of those defenses in Breckenridge 2007 and Locatelli and Wilson (forthcoming). \n\nThere are many ways of developing the idea that experiences are\nassessable for accuracy. One idea is that the contents of experience\nderive in some fashion from the contents of beliefs, so that\nexperiences bear some constitutive link to beliefs. Three sorts of\nconstitutive links to belief have been discussed in the\nliterature. The first is that experiences are acquisitions of\nbeliefs; the second is that they are dispositions to form\nbeliefs; the third is that they are grounds of dispositions\nto form beliefs. A fourth position simply identifies experiences with beliefs\nabout how things look (Gluer 2009), or  even more simply, with beliefs whose content characterizes the way things look (Bryne 2016). \n\nFirst, suppose experiences are acquisition of beliefs formed\nby a standard use of a perceptual apparatus.  When applied to visual\nexperiences, this view says that for as long as you see something that\nlooks like a red, shiny fish in front of you, you are acquiring a\nbelief that there is a red, shiny fish in front of you. The content of\nexperience, on this view, will be the same as the content of the\nbeliefs with whose acquisition the experience is identical. And what\nmakes a content the content of an experience, as opposed to some other\nkind of mental state, will be whatever makes it the content of those\nbeliefs. (This view is critically discussed by Pitcher in his 1971,\nchapter 2.) \n\nA standard objection to so identifying experiences with the\nacquisition of beliefs is that one may not believe that things are the\nway they appear. (This objection is discussed by Pitcher, op cit, and\nby Armstrong 1968). For instance, if you have background knowledge\nthat despite appearances there is no red shiny fish in front of you,\nthen you will not believe that there is one.  To accommodate this\nobjection, the relation between experiences and the acquisition of\nbeliefs must be something other than identity. \n\nSecond, suppose that experiences are dispositions on the part\nof the subject of the experience to form beliefs. This view is\ndefended by D. Armstrong (1968), G. Pitcher (1971), D. Dennett\n(1991). Which disposition an experience is, on this view,\ndepends on how things appear to the subject in the experience. For\ninstance, if you seem to see a red shiny fish in front of you, then\n(on this view) you have a disposition to believe that there is a fish\nin front of you, and your experience is identical with this\ndisposition. \n\nIf experiences are dispositions on the part of the subject to form\nbeliefs about how things appear to her, a natural accompanying view\nabout the contents of experience is that these just are the contents\nof the beliefs one is disposed to form. According to this view, what\nmakes some contents contents of experience, as opposed to\nbeing contents of some other kind of mental state, is in part that one\nis disposed to believe those contents. \n\nOne could then develop the idea that experiences are assessable for\naccuracy in the following way: \n\nPitcher's view in his 1971 is (a). Claim (b) is a natural extension of\n(a), given the assumption that beliefs have accuracy\nconditions. (Pitcher doesn't talk explicitly about accuracy\nconditions). \n\nOne difficulty with (a), and so with (a) and (b), is that it leaves\nopen how the relevant dispositions must be grounded. You could be\ndisposed to believe that there was music playing next door because\nsomeone told you it was, and yet, it seems, not hear or even seem to\nhear any music: you might be totally deaf, for instance. In this case\nyou would not have any auditory experience of music, despite being\ndisposed to believe that music is playing. So proponents of (a) seem\nwell-advised to specify an appropriate ground for the dispositions\nthey identify with experiences, so that they do not misclassify as\nexperiences events that intuitively are not experiences. \n\nThis brings us to the third position on the relation between\nexperience and belief: that experiences are perceptual grounds of\ndispositions to form beliefs. Just what a specifically perceptual\nground is has to be spelled out—a natural suggestion is that it\nrequires a certain etiology involving sensory organs, or functional\nequivalents. Given this third position, a natural accompanying\nconception of the contents of an experience is that they are the same\nas the contents of beliefs that one is disposed to form in having the\nexperience (claim (b) above). However, another version of the view\nmight hold that although the experience itself is constitutively\nlinked to beliefs, it does not have contents that are\nconstitutively linked to the contents of the beliefs. \n\nClaim (b) above, which identifies the contents of an experience with\ncontents of beliefs one is disposed to form in having the experience,\nassumes that the contents of both kinds of state can be the same. Some\nphilosophers have argued that the contents of such states must differ.\nIf this is correct then none of the views here mentioned can be\ncorrect as stated. (For discussion of how the views might be modified,\nsee \n Section 6.2 \n below, and the entry \n on non-conceptual content.)\n \n\nAnother objection to views that posit constitutive links between\nexperiences and beliefs, or between experiential contents and belief\ncontents focuses on primitive creatures that can have experiences,\neven though they lack the capacity and disposition to form\nbeliefs. Such creatures would seem to be impossible if experiences\nwere constitutively linked to beliefs, as the views discussed here\nhold. This objection seems to apply to the position that identifies\nexperiences with beliefs about the ways things look (defended by Glüer\n2009). In contrast, Glüer's (2009) view seems immune from the objection that assimilating perceptual experience to belief would entail that subjects of known illusions have contradictory beliefs, and so are irrational. This objection applies to Byrne (2016), who argues that this consequence is plausible.  \n\nInstead of holding that the perceptual content derives from the\ncontent of belief, one might instead hold that the contents of\nperception and the contents of belief are in some sense analogous, and\nmore generally that experiences and beliefs are similarly structured\nby contents on the one hand, and a relation to those contents, on the\nother. \n\nBeliefs are often thought to be relations to contents, and contents of\nbeliefs are often thought to be contents that one can stand in other\nrelations toward, besides belief. Such relations are sometimes called\n‘attitudes’, where examples of these are supposed to be\nnotions from folk-psychology such as hoping, wanting, or\nsupposing. However, it is useful to construe the notion of\n‘attitude’ more broadly, so that it is more generally a\nway of having content.  Subpersonal states of visual processing, if\nthey are informational states with accuracy conditions (and so with\ncontents in our sense), will instantiate ways of having content; so\nwould the propositional attitudes as they are traditionally conceived.\nFrom now on ‘attitudes’ will be relations in which one can\nstand to contents, when one has a contentful mental state. Both\nphilosophers and psychologists have found it useful to mark such a\n distinction.[1]\n More recently, Crane (2003) calls attitudes in this broader sense\n‘intentional modes’. (See also Searle 1983, Chapter 1.)\nThese are all distinctions between aspects of mental states, where\none feature (akin to content) characterizes the subject-matter of the\nmental state, and the other (akin to attitude) characterizes a mode of\nentertaining it. \n\nIf experiences have contents, then they will be structured by attitude\nand content: the experience will have content in an experiential way.\nSeveral substantive questions arise about what experiential attitudes\nare. \n\nFirst, it is an open question how finely grained the experiential\nattitudes may be. A natural proposal is that there are different\nexperiential ways of having content corresponding to the different\nsense modalities. But it is far from given that the modalities mark\nout natural kinds of sensory experience, let alone the only natural\nkinds of such experience, since it is a complicated question how to\ndistinguish the different kinds of sensory experience from one\nanother. Furthermore, there are multi-sensory phenomena, such as\nsynesthesia, which defy straightforward categorization as a single\nkind of sensory experience. Another problem case may be the experience\nof bodily actions, in which (say) visual, kinesthetic and tactile\nexperiences are intertwined.  (See Press et al. 2004,\nKennett et al.  2001 and Fotopoulou et al. 2009 for\ndiscussion of cases in which visual experience enhances tactile acuity\nand kinesthetic experience generally). \n\nSecond, it is a substantive question what constitutes an\nexperiential way of having content. Tye (1995, 2000) has\nproposed that what makes a state have a content in the experiential\nway is that it has a certain functional role: it is\n‘poised’ for a certain kind of use in the cognitive\nsystem; and in addition it has non-conceptual content (see \n Section 6.2) \n and is not individuated by any objects that it may represent. Another\noption is that what makes a state have content in an experiential way\nis that it has the appropriate sort of phenomenology (see Chalmers\n2004). A third option is that the experiential way of entertaining\ncontent overlaps with the belief way of entertaining it—whatever\nexactly that is. This last option seems to underlie a very influential\nidea developed in Armstrong and Pitcher's proposals, that experiences\nare belief-like in an important way. (Cf. Pendelbury's discussion of\nsensuous belief in his 1986; Heck's discussion of ‘assertoric\nforce’ in his 2000; Martin's discussion of\n‘coerciveness’ in his 2002). These options are not\nexclusive. \n\nThird, it is a substantive question to what extent attitude and\ncontent are independent from one another. Once we fix on an\nexperiential way of entertaining content, what if anything limits the\nrange of contents that can be entertained in that way? Going in the\nother direction, once we fix on a content, are there limits on what\nattitudes may be taken toward it? How this question is answered bears\non several neighboring issues. If any content that can be entertained\nexperientially can also be entertained unconsciously, then it will not\nbe contents alone that give an experience its phenomenality. The\nquestion also bears on the question of whether there is\nnon-conceptual content (see \n Section 6.2 \n and the entry \n on non-conceptual content). \n\nFourth, it is sometimes assumed that if experiences are structured by\nattitude and content, then experience types will be individuated by\ntheir specific attitude plus their contents, so that if an experience\nE1 with content C is type-identical to an\nexperience E2, then E2 will\nalso have content C, and E1 and\nE2 will instantiate the same experiential\nattitude. The source of this idea may be an analogous claim about\nbeliefs: namely, the claim that if belief B1 with\ncontent C is the same belief-type as B2,\nthen B2 will also have content\nC. However, it should not be taken as a consequence of the\nclaim that experiences have content that their contents individuate\nexperience-types. Rather, this is a substantive claim that needs both\nrefinement and defense. Even if beliefs were individuated by their\ncontents, that would not suffice to show that experiences are as\nwell. Some additional reason would be needed to think that experiences\nand beliefs are alike in this respect. \n\nIf one holds that experiences are not constitutively linked to beliefs\nbut are similarly structured by attitude and content, then this is one\nmotivation for thinking there are experiential attitudes distinct from\nbelief. However, one could hold that experiences are so structured (by\nattitude and content), while also holding that experiences have their\ncontents in virtue of their connections to beliefs. \n\nSo far, we've reviewed two broad ways of developing the idea that\nexperiences have accuracy conditions: on the first way, these derive\nfrom the contents of beliefs; on the second way, they don't.  On\neither of these two approaches, the question arises of what kinds of\ncontent experiential contents are. \n\nWhichever of the two approaches are taken, a basic constraint on the\ncontents of an experience is that these should reflect (at least some)\nintuitions about when experiences are accurate or inaccurate. Another\ncommonly-held constraint is that the contents must be adequate to its\nphenomenology: any proposal for what contents a given experience has\nmust in some way reflect the phenomenology of the experience. The\nnotion of phenomenal adequacy has considerable intuitive\nforce. Theories of the contents of experience are often defended on\nthe grounds that they “do justice to the phenomenology”\n(for example, see the discussion in\n Section 6.2 \n of the ‘richness’ motivation for non-conceptual content, the discussion in\n Section 3.4 \n of indexical content, and Chalmers (2006)) or are criticized on the grounds that they\n“get the phenomenology wrong” (e.g., Smith 2003, 259ff;\nDainton 2000, 115; Johnston 2004, 120).  These appeals presuppose that\nthe contents of experience have to in some way reflect the\nphenomenology of the experience.  \n\nThis section reviews the main theories of what kinds of contents\nexperience contents are. \n\nSome philosophers of language defend the view that an utterance of the\nform ‘N is F’, where\n‘N’ is an ordinary proper name, expresses a\nstructured propositional content consisting of the referent of the\nname ‘N’ and the property expressed by the\npredicate ‘F’. For instance, if the sentence\nuttered is ‘Frida is cold’, then the associated content\nwould consist in Frida herself and the property of being\ncold. Contents consisting of referents of singular terms and\nproperties expressed by predicates are known as Russellian,\nbecause at one time Russell advocated the view that singular terms\ncontribute only their referents to the proposition expressed by\nsentences in which they occur (or utterances of such sentences). Our\nexample uses the ordinary proper name ‘Frida’; but Russell\nhimself thought that such names were not genuine singular terms, and\ndenied that public objects ever got into Russellian contents. In\ncontemporary discussions, such contents are also\ncalled singular contents, because they include the referent\nof a singular term itself rather than a description that picks out\ndifferent objects depending on which thing in the world satisfies\nit. \n\nOne of the simplest theories of the contents of experiences says that\nexperiences have contents that are Russellian, and that these contents\nconsist of the very things that appear to have certain properties and\nthe very properties that they appear to have. For instance, if one has\na visual experience representing a red cube, the contents of\nexperience on this view would be the structured proposition containing\nthe object one sees that looks like a red cube and the property of\nbeing a red cube. This content would have the form\n[o,P], where o is the very object one is\nperceiving in having the experience, and P is the property\nthat o appears to have. Note that this is a view both about\nthe nature of the contents themselves, and about the conditions under\nwhich such experiences have them: an experience has such contents when\nthe subject is seeing an individual that appears to have the\nproperty that occurs in the content. \n\nThe strongest Russellian contents include both objects and\nproperties. In practice, the Russellian content of a complex visual\nexperience might involve a number of different objects having a\nconjunction of different properties: location properties, shape\nproperties, color properties, and so on. \n\nInstead of strongly Russellian contents just described, one could\ndefine weaker Russellian contents that involve the very properties\nthings appear to have, but don't involve the very objects that appear\nto have them. These weaker Russellian contents are said to be\nexistentially quantified contents, which would be naturally\nexpressed by saying something of the form ‘There is a red cube\nat location L’. Most philosophers who defend the view\nthat experiences have Russellian contents hold that these contents are\nweaker Russellian contents. (For general discussion, see Chalmers 2004;\nfor discussion of the case of color, see Thau 2002, Shoemaker 1990,\n1994, 2005, Holman 2002, Maund 1995, Wright 2003.) One reason for\nweakening contents is this way is to respect the ideas that two\nexperiences can represent the world as being the same way, even if\nthey are experiences of perceiving numerically different objects, such\nas twins. Another reason sometimes given for positing weak as opposed\nto strong Russellian contents is that two experiences can represent\nthe world as being the same way, even if one is a hallucination in\nwhich no object is perceived at all.  (see e.g., Tye 1995, chapter 5,\nand Tye 2000, chapter 3). Here, though, it is important to distinguish\nthe view that contents are individuated by the objects they comprise,\nfrom the view that an experience has a Russellian content that\nincludes the object o only if the subject is perceiving the o. This\nlatter view is an optional extra (built in to the simple Russellian\nview discussed above), not entailed by the claim that experience has\nRussellian content. (Logical space has room for the view that\nhallucinations can sometimes have Russellian contents, as when one\nhallucinates one's father, or some other particular person. For\ndiscussion of this issue see McLaughlin 1989, Smith 2002, ch. 7\nand Johnston 2004). \n\nSome philosophers have argued that experiences can't have\ncolor-involving Russellian contents and can't have location-involving\ncontents on the grounds that this would allow phenomenally different\nexperiences of colors and locations to have the same Russellian\ncontents. These criticisms illustrate the appeal to the phenomenal\nadequacy constraint on contents. More exactly, they appeal to a\nway of specifying that constraint by holding that when two experiences\nare phenomenally the same, or are phenomenally the same in a respect,\nthere should be some contents that they have in common. These\ncriticisms are discussed in\n Section 4.1 (color)\n and\n Section 4.2 (location). \n\nAnother simple theory says that the contents of experiences are sets\nof possible worlds in which things are as they appear to be in the\nexperience. For instance, if one has a visual experience representing\na red cube, the contents of experience on this view would be a set of\npossible worlds in which there really is a red cube in front of\nyou. Or perhaps they might be a set of possible worlds in which the\nvery cube C that is actually in front of you is red. The\ncentral idea behind this view is that to represent a\nsituation—whether in language, in thought, or in\nexperience—is to distinguish between two ways the world might\nbe: first, ways the world might be if the situation does obtain, where\nthese include the actual world; second, ways the world might be if the\nsituation does not obtain. For instance, if a subject's experience\nrepresents that there is a red cube in front of her, she thereby (on\nthis general view of representation) represents the actual world as\nbeing among the worlds in which there is a red cube in front of\nher. Stalnaker (1984) and Lewis (1986) think this view best reflects\nthe nature of representation. \nOne potential problem with possible-worlds contents concerns\nexperiences that represent impossible scenes. Consider the staircase\ndepicted in the Escher drawing, on which one seems to be able to make\nfour consecutive left turns, ending where one begins, yet walking\ndownstairs (or upstairs) the whole time. Another example of\ncontradictory contents comes from the waterfall illusion, when one\nlooks at a stationary object after looking at a waterfall, the object\nappears to move, yet appears to stay still relative to its\nbackground. Similar illusions of movement can be achieved by looking\nat spirals on paper. These experiences differ phenomenally from one\nanother. Moreover, although all seem to represent both that something\nis moving and that the very same thing is not moving, they represent\nmuch more specific scenes as well, and these specifics clearly\ndiffer. It seems that possible-worlds contents could not reflect these\ndifferences. Since the set of possible of worlds in which things are\nas the experience represents them to be is the null set, the view that\nsays that the only contents of experience are possible worlds would\nposit the same content (i.e., the null set) for all of them. \n\nA third theory says that the contents of experience are composed of\nmodes of presentation of objects and properties, rather than\nobjects and properties themselves. The key feature of modes of\npresentation, on this view, is that a single object or property can\nhave multiple modes of presentation. A Fregean content will be true\nonly if the object presented by a mode of presentation in the content\nhas the property (or properties) presented by a mode of presentation\nin the content. (See Chalmers 2004). \n\nThe Fregean theory is motivated in part by the same considerations\nthat motivate analogous views in the philosophy of language. The key\nsort of example in the philosophy of language involves a pair of\nsentences, such as “Hesperus is the morning star” and\n“Hesperus is the evening star”, that are the same except\nfor containing different terms that refer to or denote the same thing\n(both “the morning star” and “the evening\nstar” denote Venus). Suppose a subject rationally accepts one of\nthese sentences while rationally rejecting or remaining neutral on the\nother. Then, it is argued, though the sentences cannot differ in their\ntruth-value, they must play different roles in the subject's\nreasoning: for example, the subject will list Hesperus among the\nheavenly bodies visible in the evening, but she won't list Hesperus\namong the heavenly bodies visible in the morning. Fregean theorists\ntake there to be an aspect of meaning that is linked to cognitive role\nin this way. \n\nFregean contents of experience are supposed to play the same role, and\nthus are motivated by cases with the same structure. Recall our\nexample of two people with experiences that represent the same red\ncube at the same location L, but from different\nperspectives. The Fregean addresses this sort of case by holding that\nthe experiences contain different modes of presentation of the\ncube. An example of such a view is defended in Burge (1991). \n\nAnother example that motivates the view that experiences have Fregean\ncontents involves perceptual constancies. In the case of color\nconstancy, a table can look such a way that one would readily judge\nthat it is uniformly brown, even though one can discern variations in\nlightness and darkness. Sometimes the variations are brought into\nfocus by considering how many different shades of paint one would have\nto use to paint a realistic picture of the table. The central problem\nthese cases pose for the theory of experiential content is to say\nexactly what ‘lightness and darkness’ are lightness and\ndarkness of: since there is a good sense in which the table\nlooks brown, it is not variation in the table's color; but the\nvariations seems nonetheless to be closely related to color. Size\nconstancy illustrates the same problem: a departing train does not\nappear to shrink as it moves away from you; but there is something\nlike size (even if it is not the size of the train) that does appear\nto lessen, and the problem for the theory of content is say what this\nis. Accounting for the constancies is a problem for the theory of\nexperience content, because both the constant features and the varying\nones are reflected in phenomenology, so by the phenomenal adequacy\nconstraint, the contents should reflect them. The problem presented by\nthe constancies is to show how it is that the constant and varying\nfeatures don't conflict in such a way as to make the experience\nfalsidical (for having contradictory contents). \n\nOne attempt to account for the variation in these cases is to invoke\nFregean modes of presentation of the constant features. In\nthe case of color, such a Fregean proposal would say that experience\nrepresents the brownness of the table under modes of presentation that\nvary with the variations in lightness and darkness. The appeal of this\nstrategy is that it does not treat the constant property and varying\nones on a par: the constant feature is represented at the level of\nreference; the varying features at the level of sense. The table does\nnot look to be both brown and shiny white or grey; it looks to be\nbrown, by looking shinier or brighter in some parts than it does in\nothers. \n\nIt should be noted that the other historically influential attempts to\naccount for the constancies was the sense-datum theory, which (in the\ncase of the table) would posit a sense-datum that really is shiny and\nwhite, in addition to the brown table itself. The Fregean attempt\nclaims to acknowledge both constant and varying features, without\npositing such additional entities. \n\nThe main challenges for Fregean views (of utterance content, belief\ncontent, and experience content) is to make precise in each case what\nmodes of presentation are such that they can reflect these\nvariations. (For criticisms of Fregean views about the contents of\nboth beliefs and experiences, see Thau 2002, ch. 2.  For defense of\nthe Fregean view drawing on epistemological considerations, see Silins\n2011).  \n\nMany contentful experiences seem to have contents that must be\nspecified by the use of indexical expressions, such as\n‘over there’, ‘to the left’,\n‘here’, ‘in front of/behind me’, ‘just a\nsecond ago’, ‘since a few second ago’, and so\non. For instance, some auditory experiences seem to present sounds as\ncoming from a direction relative to the ears; some proprioceptive\nexperiences seem to present pressure sensations as located in specific\nparts of the body; visual experiences seem to present things in\nlocations relative to the eyes and the rest of the body. More\ngenerally, contentful experiences present the world from the subject's\nperspective both in space and in time. If one tried to characterize\nthe perspective aspect of contents in language, it would be natural to\nuse indexical expressions for spatial properties, for the subject\nherself, and for times. \n\nTo begin with spatial content, suppose you hear a sound as coming from\nyour left. Someone else facing you, due to different orientation,\nhears the same sound as coming from the right. Moreover, a third\nperceiver situated halfway around the world could hear a qualitatively\nidentical sound as coming from her left. The area to the\nfirst perceiver's left is the very same spot as the area to the second\nperceiver's right, whereas the area to the left of the third\nperceiver, who is very far away from the other two, is a completely\ndifferent part of space. Now, if contents are to reflect which side of\nthe perceiver the sound seems to come from, then it is not\nenough simply to include the very area from which sounds are coming in\nthe content. That would not reflect what's in common between you and\nthe third perceiver, who is halfway around the world. It would also\nfail to reflect what's different between you and the second perceiver,\nwho is differently oriented than you. So it seems that some more\nspecific representation of location and direction is needed. \n\nIf locations and directions are represented in experience, then it\nseems they are represented relative to the subject, in which case\nthere has to be some way of representing the subject herself (or\nitself)—or at least the perceptual organs or body parts that are\non the subject-side of the spatial relations. This suggests that\nbodily awareness of some sort may be involved in contentful\nexperiences, even when those experiences are otherwise visual or\nauditory, so that experiential attitudes may have to be cross-modal,\nrather than being individuated simply by sensory modality. Another\nquestion is how self-representation works in experience. Some forms of\nself-awareness are cognitively demanding; yet representation of\nperceiver-relative locations and directions are clearly involved in\nexperiential contents. There is a theoretical need, then, for an\naccount of self-representations that could be had by cognitively\nprimitive creatures, such as animals and human infants (for\ndiscussion, see Peacocke 1994). \n\nPeacocke has argued (1992 chapter 3) that to adequately reflect the\nspatial and first-personal perspectives in experience, a special kind\nof content is needed. He calls his sort of content scenario\ncontent.  Scenario contents are ways of filling out the space\naround the perceiver, consistent with the experience being\ncorrect. They include a point of origin and orientation on axes, in\nrelation to which things are located. In our example, the sound comes\nfrom the left, relative to the origin in the subject's body, which\nPeacocke proposes is the middle of the chest. \n\nIndexical contents (spatial, first-personal and temporal) require\nmodification or further specification of all three views about the\ncontents of experience mentioned so far. In the case of possible-world\ncontents, one way to have such an axis is to appeal to centered\npossible worlds: worlds centered on a subject, and possibly also a\ntime and/or a location. The further features of the worlds can then be\nspecified in relation to the point of origin: in the example, coming\nfrom the left of the center (or being such-and-such distance and\ndirection from it). (See discussion of Peacocke's ‘positioned\nscenarios’ in his 1992 ch. 3 and below.) \n\nSomewhat similarly, Russellian contents may be modified in order to\nreflect first-personal indexical contents by introducing contents that\nare akin to open sentences, with a gap in place of a component\ncorresponding to the subject. In the example involving the red cube,\nthe contents might be something like a structured proposition\ncontaining the cube, the non-locational properties it appears to have\n(e.g., being red, being cubical, and so on), and then a component\nexpressed by ‘two feet in front of ____’, where the gap\ncan be filled in with different subjects in different\ncircumstances. To assess this special semantic entity for accuracy,\nthe gap would need to have a value. Whether its gap is filled or not,\nthis entity is something that in principle two experiences had by\ndifferent subjects could share. For discussion of these contents for\nexperience, see Bach 1997 (in the Other Internet Resources section\nbelow); for a Fregean version of gappy contents see Burge 1991 and\nSchellenberg 2010; for a Russellian version of gappy contents for\nbelief and utterances, see Braun 1993. \n\nHow to treat indexicality is one of the main challenges to Fregean\ncontents of utterances as Frege himself understood these. (See Perry\n1977, Evans 1990, Burge 1991.) One of the roles of modes of\npresentation according to Frege was to determine reference, so that\nany two expressions (or occurrences thereof) with the same sense would\nhave the same reference. Another role is to reflect cognitive\nsignificance of sentences such as “Now it is 5pm, October 1st\n2005”. The occurrence of “now” and of “5pm\nOctober 1st 2005” seem to refer to the same time, yet an\nutterance of the sentence could be informative to someone who did not\nknow the date and time. One and the same time seems in some intuitive\nsense to have different ‘modes of presentation’: one\nexpressed by ‘now’, the other expressed by ‘5pm\nOctober 1st 2005’. \n\nIn the case of indexical expressions, it is hard to see what feature\nof the meaning of ‘now’, if any, plays both of these two\nroles. This poses a problem for the Fregean doctrine of senses. Later\ntheorists have rejected the feature of sense or modes of presentation\nwhereby they determine reference, while retaining the idea a single\nobject or property can have multiple modes of presentation. (See\nChalmers 2002). In rejecting the idea that modes of presentation\ndetermine referents by themselves, they say that reference is\ndetermined by mode of presentation plus select facts about the\nenvironment in which the utterance or experience are had. \n\nProponents of these new Fregean modes of presentation invoke them to\naccount for indexical features of experience contents. In the example\nof sounds coming from one's left, the new Fregeans about experience\ncontents invoke a mode of presentation that is shared by the\nexperiences of the two perceivers in different places who hear the\nsound coming from their left, and a different mode of presentation for\nthe experience of the perceiver who hears the sound as coming from the\nright. The former mode of presentation (roughly the same, they would\nsay, as the mode of presentation associated with the expression\n‘to the left’) refers to different places for each\nperceiver. The latter mode of presentation (roughly the same, they\nwould say, as the mode of presentation had by the expression ‘to\nthe right’), when it's in the contents of the experience of the\nperceiver who hears the sound coming from the right, refers to the\nsame place as the mode of presentation ‘to the left’ when\nit is in the contents of the experience of the original perceiver. \n\nModifications would also be needed for Russellian, possible-worlds, or\nFregean contents of beliefs; and proponents of each of these\nviews have discussed what those might be in the case of belief.  (For\ndiscussion of indexicals and Russellian contents, see Kaplan 1977,\nSchiffer 1981, Austin 1990, and the entry on\n indexicals; for discussion of indexicals\nand possible-worlds content, see Stalnaker 1981; for discussion of\nindexical beliefs and Fregean contents, see Perry 1977; Evans 1981,\nMcDowell 1984.) It is an open question whether modifications that\nsucceed for the case of belief can also succeed for the case of\nexperience. An influential approach that has been developed for both\nbeliefs and experiences appeals to a special kind of possible world:\ncentered worlds, where these are possible worlds marked with a\ndesignated subject and perhaps a designated time or other\nparameters. The centered-world framework can provide a level of\ncontent that can be shared by two perceivers who perceive\nqualitatively identical but numerically distinct cubes in different\nlocations as being nearby: each experience is true in worlds where\nthere is a cube nearby the designated center of that world. Features\nsuch as being nearby the center are called “centering\nfeatures” (see Egan 2006a, 2006b, 2010), and can be used to\ndescribe both the phenomena that indexicals are apt for describing, as\nwell as perceptual constancies and secondary qualities. For discussion\nsee Brogaard 2010, Chalmers 2006, Egan 2006a, 2006b, 2010. Centered\nworlds are implicit in Peacocke's 1992 discussion of scenario\ncontent. \n\nIf experiences have at most only one kind of content, then there will\nbe a substantive debate about whether experience contents are\nRussellian, unstructured, Fregean, or versions of these modified to\ntake account of indexicality. Three sorts of considerations are\ntypically invoked to decide between these: (i) which best reflect\nintuitions about veridicality of experiences; (ii) which best reflect\ndistinctions to which experiences are sensitive; (iii) which contents\nbest reflect the phenomenology of experience. \n\nSome philosophers have proposed that there are different explanatory\npurposes for contents to serve, and one kind of content cannot serve\nall of them. (On the general strategy of dividing contents in this way\nsee Fodor 1987 and White 1991.) Such philosophers think experiences\nhave multiple contents. One example of such a position holds that\nexperiences have contents that are both conceptual and\nnon-conceptual (for more on this distinction, see \n Section 6.2 \n below. This kind of duality is explored by Reiland and Lyons 2015, and defended by by Lyons 2005a, 2005b and Bengson, Grube and Korman 2011). Another holds that experiences have both ‘gappy’\ncontents (somewhat akin to open sentences), but have object-involving\ncontents as well when the experience stands in the right causal\nrelations to environment (e.g., Burge 1991 and Schellenberg 2010; for\ndiscussion, see Martin 2003). Here the idea is that the gappy content\nreflects the phenomenology of the experience and the commonality in\ncontent between indistinguishable hallucinations and\nnon-hallucinations, whereas the object-involving contents reflect\nintuitions about accuracy conditions for experiences that are\nadequately connected to the environment. A related idea is that\ncontents of experience include both general and object-involving\ncontents (Siegel 2010b). \n\nAnother example of a view positing multiple contents for multiple\nexplanatory purposes is Shoemaker's theory of color experience,\naccording to which experience represents both color properties, partly\nin virtue of representing associated ‘appearance\nproperties’ (see \n Section 4.1 \n for discussion). The representation of appearance properties is\nsupposed to explain the phenomenal sameness of certain\nexperiences with inverted qualia; whereas the representation of color\nproperties is supposed to underlie intuitions about the veridicality\nof the experiences. (This is explained more fully in \n Section 4.1). \n A somewhat similar rationale is given for a form of\n‘two-dimensionalism’ about experience contents, which\nholds that experiences have both indexical Fregean contents, and\nnon-Fregean contents (either Russellian or unstructured) determined by\nthe Fregean contents in conjunction with select facts about the\nenvironment in which the experience is had (Chalmers 2004, Thompson\n2003). The indexical Fregean contents are supposed to reflect the\ninferential role and phenomenology of experience, while the\nnon-Fregean contents are supposed to reflect the properties that we\ntake experiences to attribute to objects. A related two-dimensionalist\nposition (Chalmers 2006) adds a third kind of Russellian content to\nexperience, ‘Edenic’ content, involving special\nnon-instantiated ‘Edenic’ properties, which are supposed\nto reflect phenomenology perfectly—unlike indexical Fregean\ncontent, which is supposed to reflect it only imperfectly. \n\nIf experiences have accuracy conditions, then it is natural to think\nof those conditions as conditions under which certain objects\nhave certain properties. For instance, experiences seem to\nattribute properties to ordinary objects such as people, fish,\nbottles, shoes and the like: the bottle feels round to haptic touch;\nthe shoes make clicking sounds as they hit the floor; a person's face\nlooks to be only 3 feet away and angry; the fish smells and tastes\nfishy. Taking ‘object’ in a broader sense, the attribution\nof properties to objects seems even more widespread: auditory\nexperience can present sounds as loud; proprioception can\npresent pains as throbbing; kinesthetic experience can\npresent one's toes as cold and wiggling; visual experience\ncan present an entire expanse as bright pink; haptic-tactile\nexperience can present a surface as smooth. Contents of\nexperience, then, often seem to have a predicative structure,\ninvolving objects (in either narrow or broad senses) and\nproperties. It then seems possible to theorize separately about the\naccuracy conditions that concern the properties things appear\nto have, on the one hand; and the accuracy conditions that concern the\nobjects or things that appear to have the properties. The\nrest of section 4 will focus on accuracy conditions associated with\nproperties; accuracy conditions associated with objects will be\ndiscussed in \n Section 5. \n\nWhen the accuracy-conditions of an experience require that a certain\nproperty is instantiated, the experience represents that property. For\ninstance, if the experience one has when seeing a grape is accurate\nonly if the grape is green, then the experience represents the\nproperty of being green. \n\nThe literature on how properties are represented in experience has\nfocused largely on the case of visual experience and color\nproperties. The question of how color is represented in experience is\na good case with which to review debates about what sorts of contents\nexperiences have. But one should generalize from the case of color\nexperience with caution: views that seem strongest for the case of\ncolor properties may seem weaker for cases of other properties; views\nthat seem strongest for the case of visual experience may seem weaker\nfor other modalities, or for combinations of modalities. \n\nThe central issue here—which color-related properties are\nrepresented in experience—is closely tied up with the more\ngeneral question of how the phenomenology of experience relates to its\nhaving contents. These more general issues are discussed in \n Section 7; \n but because the general discussion to date has focused so narrowly on\ncolor and visual experience, the considerations overlap greatly. \n\nIt is widely held that visual experiences represent color properties,\nattributing them to objects, surfaces, volumes and locations. However,\nthere is substantial debate about what experiences represent when they\nrepresent colors. Let R-experiences be experiences with\nphenomenal character R, where R is the phenomenal\ncharacter that normal perceivers have when they see red things. Let\nG-experiences be experiences with phenomenal character\nG, where G is the phenomenal character that normal perceivers\nhave when they see green things. \n\nAccording to a simple theory, G experiences represents\ngreenness, and R experiences represent redness. An objection\nto this theory arises from a putative case of inverted qualia\nwithout illusion. The case goes like this. One perceiver, call\nher Nonvert, typically has R-experiences when she veridically\nperceives and is in causal contact with red things, and she typically\nhas G-experiences when she veridically perceives and is in\ncausal contact with green things. Another perceiver, call him Invert,\ntypically has R-experiences when he veridically perceives and\nis in causal contact with green things, and has G-experiences\nwhen he veridically perceives and is in causal contact with red\nthings. So, in the thought experiment, when Invert, with his\nG-experiences, sees a red tomato, his experience represents\nredness; when Nonvert sees the same tomato with his\nR-experiences, his experiences also represents redness. \n\nOn the assumption that experiences with the same color phenomenology\nwill have the same color content, this thought experiment challenges\nthe simple theory we began with, since it purports to describe a case\nin which a G-experience is an experience of veridically seeing\nred. Defenders of the simple theory may reject the assumption.\nAlternatively, they may challenge the part of the thought experiment\nthat purports to describe inverted qualia without\nillusion. That is, they may challenge the idea that Invert's\nG-experiences veridically represent redness, rather than\nnon-veridically representing greenness.  In response to this\nchallenge, most interpretations of this thought experiment build in\nsubstantive assumptions about what sorts of conditions are sufficient\nfor making it the case that experiences represent one color property\nrather than another. It is standardly said that the phenomenally\ndifferent color experiences come to represent the same property due to\nexternalism about color contents of experience, whereby when\na type of experience stands in the right sort of causal relations to,\nsay, redness, this suffices to make experiences of that type represent\nredness. \n\nIf the thought experiment describes a genuine possibility, there are\nat least three ways to modify the simple view: (i) Deny that content\nsupervenes on phenomenology, allowing that two experience with the\nsame color phenomenology can nonetheless differ in content. One\nversion of this response says that the phenomenal difference is a\n‘raw feel’ or ‘qualia’ (see Block 1990, 1996);\nanother version holds that a single color property can present itself\nto a perceiver in phenomenally different ways. (ii) Hold that there\nare phenomenal differences between G-experiences that\nrepresent redness and G-experiences that represent greenness,\nso that ‘G-experience’ does not pick out a fully\ndeterminate phenomenal type An example of this response is\nexternalism about phenomenology, defended by Lycan 2001 and\nDretske 1995. (iii) Hold that there are contents shared by\nG-experiences that represent redness and\nG-experiences that represent greenness. This response is\ndeveloped by Thau 2002, who offers a Russellian version of it; Chalmers\n2004, who offers a Fregean version of it; and Shoemaker 1994, 2005,\nwho offers another Russellian version of it. \n\nResponses (i) and (ii) will be discussed in \n Section 7. \n Regarding response (iii), one Fregean theory about this thought\nexperiment is that it is a case in which the experiences of Invert and\nNonvert have different modes of presentation of the same color\nproperty (say, redness). On this view, redness would be presented in\nInvert's experience under a G-mode, and it would be presented\nin Nonvert's experience under a R-mode, so that the\nphenomenal difference between Invert and Nonvert's experience would\nalso be a difference in Fregean content. \n\nA Russellian theory is that in addition to color properties, Invert\nand Nonvert's experiences of the red tomato also represent a property\nclosely associated with redness but distinct from it, and is\nrepresented by and only by R-experiences. Shoemaker calls\nthese properties ‘appearance properties’. Call this the\nShoemaker proposal.  (Shoemaker 1994, Thau 2002, though Thau\ndenies that colors are represented in experience, claiming that only\nthe other properties are—so he does not accept the thought\nexperiment exactly as stated. For another denial that colors are\nrepresented in experiences see Tolliver 1994). \n\nA final theory about this thought experiment combines aspects of the\nFregean and Russellian proposals. It says that Invert's and Nonvert's\nexperience each has two contents associated with it. One set of\ncontents involves objects and properties represented by the\nexperiences; the other involves modes of presentation of these objects\nand properties. On this proposal, the object-property contents\nassociated with Invert's experiences are the same as Nonvert's, but\ntheir modes of presentation are different. \n\nThe issue between the Fregean and Shoemaker proposals is subtle. Both\nagree (contrary to response (i), which includes the qualia view) that\nthe difference between Invert and Nonvert's experience of redness is a\nrepresentational difference of some sort, as opposed to a raw\nfeel. And both views posit entities associated with this difference:\nappearance properties for the Shoemaker proposal; modes of\npresentation for the Fregean proposal. The difference concerns the\nstatus of the entities associated with yet distinct from color\nproperties: are they modes of presentation of the colors, or are they\nsimply other properties, represented alongside the colors (or instead\nof them, as Thau holds). In Shoemaker's 1994 version, color properties\nare represented in experience by representing appearance\nproperties. The issue is sometimes described by saying that the\nShoemaker proposal predicts that there are two\ncolor-associated ways that the tomato looks to be to each perceiver:\nit looks to be red; and it looks to have the appearance property. In\ncontrast, the Fregean view predicts that there is just one\ncolor-associated way that the tomato looks to be: it simply looks to\nbe red. \n\nA related question is which properties color experience represents\nthings as having when it represents them as being colored. Since color\nexperiences in principle could be systematically in error, this is\ndistinct from the ontological question of which properties the colors\nare, though the same options suggest themselves. According to one\nposition, when an experience represents that an apple is red, it\nrepresents that it has a disposition to cause certain kinds of\nexperiences. (See Langsam 2000 and McDowell 1985) According to an\nopposed position, when an experience represents that an apple is red,\nit represents that it has a non-dispositional property (McGinn 1983,\nJohnston 1992, Boghossian and Velleman 1992). One version of the\nlatter says that experience represents a primitive property that\ncannot be specified in non-chromatic terms (Broackes 1992, Campbell\n2003). Yet another says experience is neutral on whether redness is or\nisn't primitive. (Byrne and Hilbert 2003) Another question is\nwhether colors are represented as being properties of external\nobjects, or of sense-data (where these are private mental objects), or\nboth. \n\nMany contentful experiences represent properties as being instantiated\nat certain locations: one hears sounds as coming from certain\ndirections; one experiences pains in specific parts of the body; one\nsees different colors in different places in the scene before the\neyes. It is more controversial whether gustatory and olfactory\nexperiences represent locations. We certainly end up attributing\ntastes and odors to things in the external world, but this alone does\nnot show that the associated experiences represent any locations. (For\ndiscussion of olfactory experience see Lycan 2000, Smith 2002, ch 5, Batty 2010, Richardson 2013;\nfor discussion of gustatory experience see Smith ibid.) How\nare locations represented in experience, when they are? \n\nOne debate about the nature of representation of space concerns\nwhether the positional properties represented in visual experience are\nrelational or monadic.  For discussion, see Casullo 1986. \n\nA different debate concerns which contents are best to reflect\nimportant similarities in spatial experiences. Consider an experience\nwhose contents include those that are expressed by an utterance of\n‘There is a red cube at location L’. A simple view is that\nnothing more finely grained than location L itself is\nincluded in these contents. Peacocke (in his 1992, chapter 3)\ncriticizes this view. Suppose that the experience in the example is\nveridical, so that there really is a red cube at L, And\nsuppose L is to the left of the original perceiver, but that\nthere is a second perceiver who is seeing the same red cube, except\ngiven her position relative to the cube it is on her right. The\nexperiences differ: the perceivers see the cube as being in different\npositions relative to their bodies, and the experiences will affect\nactions of the perceivers differently, in that one would have to move\nto her right while the other will move to her left to get to the\ncube. Going with these differences, there seems to be a phenomenal\ndifference between the experience of seeing a red cube to your left\nand seeing a red cube to your right. If the contents of experience are\nto reflect such differences, then there must be some more specific\nrepresentation of location L than is allowed by simply\nincluding the area itself in the contents. The potential problem\ndiscussed here for location suggests that the contents of experience\ninclude indexical contents of some sort. \n\nPeacocke has argued scenario contents are needed to\nadequately reflect how locations are represented in experience. A\nscenario is a spatial type, with a fixed origin in the human\nbody and axes given by directions front/back, left/right, and\nup/down. Once the origin and axes are fixed, the scenario specifies\nthe way the space is filled in at each point-type identified by its\ndistance and direction from the origin. A positioned scenario\nis a scenario that has specific origin and axes at a specific time,\nand is thus assessable for accuracy.  Positioned scenarios are\nsupposed to reflect the way in which locations are represented in\nexperience. \n\nAccording to another proposal about spatial experiences, made by\nCussins (1990), experiences of space consist in the subject's having\nabilities to move in certain ways. On this view, to experience a sound\nas coming from the left is to know how to locate the place it is\ncoming from, where this knowledge is practical knowledge about how to\nmove through the environment. Having these abilities, according to\nCussins, enables the subject to form beliefs and other mental states\nthat are assessable for accuracy (or that have contents in our sense);\nbut the abilities themselves, which are supposed to constitute\nexperiences, are not; and even a creature who hadn't yet or couldn't\nform such states could still have the abilities. To have the\nabilities, according to Cussins, is to be presented with locations in\nexperience. In his 1990 he calls this way of being presented with\nlocations construction-theoretic content (where this kind of\n‘content’ is not assessable for truth). \n\nPeacocke has objected to Cussins’ construction-theoretic content\nthat there appear to be cases where subjects lack the abilities to\nmove to the locations presented in experience, for instance due to\nparalysis. Whether this objection has force depends on the notion of\n‘abilities’; one might think the paralyzed have abilities\nthat they can't exercise. \n\nPeacocke's and Cussins’ theories differ in that scenario\ncontents are assessable for accuracy and construction-theoretic\ncontents aren't, and both purport to be contents of the same\nexperiences. However, something like construction-theoretic contents\ncan be combined with scenario contents. One outstanding question for\nPeacocke's theory is how an experience comes to have scenario\ncontents, and a potential answer to this is that an experience comes\nto have the scenario contents it does by the subject's having the\nabilities Cussins describes. More generally, the question of what\nmakes it the case that one has the experience contents one does is an\noutstanding question for many theories of content (this issue is\ndiscussed further in the \n Section 8). \n\nAnother debate about the representation of spatial properties concerns\nthe phenomenal difference between the experiences of seeing a\nfour-sided equilateral figure as a square and seeing it as a regular\ndiamond. (The example is from Mach 1914). \n\nIn one version of this contrast, there are two figures differing only\nin their orientation to the viewer (on a page, the top and bottom of\nthe square is parallel with the top and bottom of the page; while the\ndiamond is just like the square except rotated 45 degrees around its\ncenter.) Assuming that the property of being a square is the same as\nthe property of being a regular diamond (an assumption defended by\nPeacocke in 1993, contested by Tye 2003, but granted by Tye 2004),\nthis appears to be a case in which there is a phenomenal difference\nwithout any difference in the properties represented. The options,\nthen, are similar to the ones listed in the discussion of the inverted\ncolor qualia: (i) deny that there is a difference in content\ncorresponding to the phenomenal difference; (ii) hold that there are\ndifferences in the way the property of being square is\nrepresented, i.e., invoke different modes of presentation of this\nproperty (Peacocke 2001a, 2001b); (iii) find some other property that is\nrepresented in one experience but not the other, such as the\nviewer-relative property of resting on a side, or the property having\ntwo horizontal sides (properties allegedly attributed by experience to\nthe square but not the diamond); and the property of standing on a\npoint or the property of having inclined sides (properties allegedly\nattributed by the experience to the diamond but not to the square)\n(Tye 2005). Here we have another case of a debate between Fregean and\nRussellian positions on the nature of experience content. \n\nAnother topic concerning spatial representation in experience is the\nrelation between representing locations of things, on the one hand,\nand representing things as mind-independent, on the other. According\nto some philosophers, for the case of visual experience, representing\nthings as occupying three dimensions of space suffices for\nrepresenting them as mind-independent (see Strawson 1958, Peacocke\n1983, Masrour 2011; for dissent, see Smith ch 5, and \n 2000). According to others, visual experience represents spatial locations as locations from which one could act (Schellenberg 2007). [2] \n\nPositions on which properties are represented in experience can be\nlocated on a rough continuum, with low-level properties (where these\ninclude color, shape, illumination, and depth) at one end, and\nhigh-level properties (where these include kind properties, agential\nor other emotional properties, and semantic properties) at the\nother. The issue is which of these properties can be perceived as\nbeing instantiated: e.g., whether one can have a visual experience\nthat represents that someone is trying to do something. The\ndebate about this is closely related to the earlier debate in the\nphilosophy of science about whether one can distinguish between\nobservational and theoretical properties (see Introduction to Suppe\n(1979)). In the philosophy of mind, defenders of the view that only\nlow-level properties are represented in experience include Tye 1995,\nDretske 1995, Clark 2000, Price 2009, Brogaard 2013, Bryne 2017; defenders of the view that high-level\nproperties are represented in experience include Peacocke 1992,\nSiewert 1998, Bayne 2009, Masrour 2011, Nanay 2011, Block 2014, Siegel 2006 and 2017). It is worth noting that analogous debates can be pursued for views of experience that deny that experiences have\naccuracy conditions: for instance, if (with naive realism of the sort\nchampioned by Martin) one thinks that veridical experiences consist in\nbeing perceptually presented with an object and its properties, the\ndebate will concern which properties of objects one can be\nperceptually presented with; if one is a pure sense-datum theorist,\nthe debate will concern which properties sense-data can have. \n\nAccording to one type of argument that high-level properties can be\nrepresented in experience, experiences can be theory-laden, in the\nsense that being disposed to recognize an object or property\ninfluences the phenomenology and content of the experience. The main\npremise of the argument is a claim about phenomenology: a place, such\nas your neighborhood, or a person, such as a close friend, may look\ndifferent to you than it did when you first saw them (these examples\nare discussed by Siewert 1998); written text and spoken words in an\ninitially unfamiliar language may look and sound different before and\nafter you come to know their meaning (the auditory example is\ndiscussed by Peacocke and Siegel). These are cases in which background\nknowledge or abilities putatively influences what is represented in\nexperience. If this can happen, then even if a distinction in the\nphilosophy of science between ‘observation and\n‘theory’ can be drawn, it will not align with the\nrepresentation of low-level properties, on the one hand, and\nhigh-level properties on the other. \n\nOne type of case for denying that high-level properties are\nrepresented in visual experience appeals to two main ideas. First,\nthat the only experiential representations are those that result in a\nlawlike way from retinal stimulation. Second, retinal stimulation, in\nturn, is said to give rise to experiences independently of other\ncognitive apparatus on the part of the subject, and is insulated from\nany information processed cognitively.  A case of this sort is given\nby O'Shaughnessy (2000), chapter 17. \n\nSome debates about which properties can be represented in perception\nfocus on specific properties. It is important to distinguish between,\nfirst, perceiving causation, on the one hand, and, second,\nrepresenting causal relations in experience, on the other. It is a\nsubstantive question whether the former can happen only if the latter\ndoes.  The first issue concerns whether one can perceive causation, or\nwhether all one can perceive is a sequence of events, minus its causal\nnature (assuming there is such a thing). For discussion see Ducasse\n1965, Armstrong 1997, Fales 1990, Pietroski 2000, Beebee 2003, Butterfill 2011. For\ndiscussion in psychology of cognition regarding causation, see\nMichotte (1963) and essays in Premack, Premack and Sperber (1995.) The\nsecond issue concerns whether experiences can represent causal\nrelations, in the same way they represent colors, shapes and whatever\nelse is plausibly represented in experience. \n\nAnother example of this sort of debate concerns absences. As before,\none can distinguish the question whether you perceive that something\nis absent, from the question whether absences can be represented in\nexperience. Putative examples of perceiving absences include hearing\npauses, sensing the emptiness of your stomach, seeing the total\ndarkness of a cave, or feeling the holes in old-fashioned computer\npaper by running your finger down the sides of the page (these\nexamples are from Sorensen 2004; see also Sartre 1958 and Farennikova 2013 and 2015). Another\nputative example comes from Taylor (1952), which contains a diagram\nconsisting of two circles, one with a dot in it, the other\nempty. Arguably, you can see that there is no dot in the empty one;\nthis is a putative example of seeing that a dot is absent from the\nempty circle, once one is primed to see the absence by seeing the\ndotted circle next to the empty one. This interacts with discussions\nof the role of causation in seeing (for discussion of the role of\ncausation in perception, see entry on the causation and\nperception). Turning to questions about whether absences are\nrepresented in experience, one question is whether the absence of some\nparticular thing, or of some kind of thing, can be represented in any\nkind of experience. Perhaps one could represent (or, if one is\nfortunate, misrepresent) that one's limb is missing, or that no one is\nhome. Some phenomena involving absences may be tough to\ncategorize. For instance, if, while seeing the empty circle, by some\nnon-hallucinatory process you came to seem to see a dot in the circle,\nwould you thereby misperceive the absence of a dot as a dot? Or would\nyou merely falsidically represent that there is a dot in the circle?\n A final example of debate concerning specific properties concerns\naffordances. Affordances are possibilities of action of a creature\n(Gibson 1977). Some philosophers argue that we perceive affordances\n(Nanay 2011) or that affordances can be presented in visual experience\n(Prosser 2011, Siegel 2014).\n \n\nWhen properties are represented in experience, they are often\nattributed to ordinary objects: for instance, one may have a visual\nexperience that attributes redness and sphericality to a tomato, or a\nhaptic tactile experience that represents smoothness and\ncylindricality of a cup in one's hands, or an olfactory experience\nattributing scents to flowers, or a gustatory experience attributing\ndeliciousness to something one is chewing. In order for properties to\nbe attributed to objects in experience, the object must be represented\nin some way. A variety of different ways have been proposed for the\ncase of visual experiences, so we will focus on these. The debate is\nbest introduced by considering an example. \n\nSuppose you are seeing a cube that looks red and looks to be at\nlocation L. To simplify matters, let us ignore properties it\nlooks to have besides color and location, and let us ignore as well\nall the other issues discussed about how properties including\nsubject-relative locations are represented in experience, in\nparticular whether the contents include modes of representation of\nproperties or properties themselves as constituents. All that matters\nfor this discussion is that there be some properties attributed to the\nobjects. \n\nOne proposal is that when you have this experience, you entertain\ncontents that have the cube itself as a constituent, and attribute to\nit whatever properties the cube looks to have. \n\nAccording to this proposal, when you represent an object in\nexperience, you entertain contents such as (1): \n\nHere, the object itself is a constituent of the content. McDowell\ndefends a less simple view that an object-involving Fregean sense is a\nconstituent of the content, rather than the object by itself.  For now\nit will be simplest if we focus on the simpler version. \n\nA second proposal is a bit more complicated. On this view,\nhallucinations can share the same phenomenology as cases of\nobject-perception, and this phenomenology suffices for the subject to\nexperientially entertain a special semantic entity akin to an open\nsentence. This might be a thought of as a structured proposition with\nthe same form as (1), except that in place of the perceived object,\nthere is an unfilled position in a structure. This can be symbolized\nas follows: \n\nOn this view, in cases of object-perception, the properties expressed\nby the special semantic entity that is experientially entertained\ncharacterizes the way the perceived object appears. It is thus written\ninto this proposal that the gap gets a value only in cases of\nperceptual contact with an object. It thus posits multiple contents to\nexperience. Versions of this view have been defended by Bach 1997 (in\nthe Other Internet Resources section below) and Burge 1991. Bach's\nproposal is closer to the one stated. Burge holds that in place of the\ngap, there is a demonstrative mode of presentation of an object. See\nalso Schellenberg 2010. \n\nA third proposal (a version of which is defended by McGinn 1981) is\nthat when you see the cube, you entertain existentially quantified\ncontents, such as (3): \n\nSome philosophers argue against this proposal on the grounds that it\nis not adequate to the phenomenology of seeing objects, wherein one\nalways (it is said) seems to see a particular object. The simple\nexistentially quantified contents, it is said, cannot reflect the\nphenomenology of being visually presented with a particular\nobject. (For this line of criticism, see Campbell 2002 ch. 6, Soteriou\n2000, Martin 2003, Burge 1991.) Others go further and say that only\ncontents that could naturally be expressed using a demonstrative\nexpression putatively referring to the seen object will be adequate to\nthis phenomenology. (Campbell 2002 ch. 6) \n\nAnother consideration that has been brought to bear on the debate\nabout how objects are represented in experience is the predictions\nthat the proposals make about the accuracy (veridicality or\nfalsidicality) of experiences. One kind of case that brings the\ndifferent predictions into focus is a case discussed by Grice\n(1961). Suppose you see a cube (Grice's example involves a pillar\ninstead of a cube). Unbeknownst to you, you are seeing the cube in a\nmirror, so that the cube is behind you, though it looks to be at\nlocation L in front of you. In addition, the cube you are\nseeing is orange, though due to strange lighting it looks red. Now\nsuppose that behind the mirror, at the exact location where the orange\ncube appears to be, there really is a red cube. The situation is then\nthis: there are two cubes, one orange and one red; you see the orange\none but it's not at location L, whereas you don't see the red\none but it is at location L.  With respect to this case, the\nview that says that objects are represented in experience via\nobject-property contents such as (1) will predict that your experience\nis inaccurate (‘falsidical’), because the cube you see is\nnot red and at L. In contrast, the simple existentially\nquantified contents, (3), predict that the experience is veridical,\nbecause the way things appear (on that view) is that there is a red\ncube at L, and there is a red cube at L. If one of\nthese verdicts is intuitively stronger than the others, then that\ncounts in favor of the view(s) that predict it. \n\nWhat about the gappy contents, proposal (2)? Since it is written into\nthe proposal that the gap gets a value when the subject of the\nexperience sees an object that appears to have the properties attached\nto the gap, the experience in the cube case will be falsidical, since\neven though there is a red cube at l, that cube is not the\none you see. The cube you see is not red and at L, so the\ncontents are false, hence the experience is falsidical. Soteriou\n(2000) argues that this is the right verdict (intuitively, the\nexperience is falsidical), and so cube cases count against the\nproposal (3) which predicts that the experience is veridical. \n\nA third consideration bearing on the choice between (1), (2) and (3)\nconcerns phenomenal sameness. If two experiences that are phenomenally\nthe same have the same content, then proposal (1) will not work,\nunless it is part of a more complex proposal that experiences of\nseeing objects have multiple contents: gappy ones shared by\nphenomenally indistinguishable experiences, and object-involving ones\nthat are not so shared. \n\nOf the three proposals considered so far, the two that posit\nobject-involving contents ((1) and the multiple-content proposal (2))\npredict that the cube experience will be falsidical. Searle (1983)\ndefends a fourth proposal about how objects are represented in\nexperience that makes the same prediction, but without positing\nobject-involving contents. He proposes that when you see the cube, you\nexperientially entertain complex contents of the following form: \n\nSearle's proposal predicts that the cube experience is falsidical,\nbecause the fact that there is a red cube at L is\nnot causing your experience, and the second clause of his\ncomplex existentially quantified contents says that it is. According\nto Searle, this proposal also reflects the phenomenology of\nparticularity. \n\nSearle's proposal entails that in experiences of seeing objects, the\nexperience itself is represented (note the occurrence of ‘this\nexperience’ in (4)). Armstrong, Burge, Soteriou and others have\nobjected to Searle's proposal on the grounds that these contents are\ntoo cognitively sophisticated to be contents of experiences of\nseeing. They argue that only sophisticated creatures have the\ncognitive resources needed for this form of self-reference, and plenty\nof creatures can have visual experiences of seeing objects even while\nlacking these resources; so such self-reference cannot be a necessary\ncondition for visually experiencing objects. Another objection, also\nraised by Armstrong, Burge and Soteriou, is that causal relations\nbetween experiences and facts are not represented in\nexperience. Armstrong claims that this too is overly sophisticated;\nBurge claims that it is not part of the phenomenology of visual\nexperience. The debate turns on exactly what cognitive resources are\nneeded for an experience to represent (a) itself, and (b) causal\nrelations between itself and other things. If one denies that causal\nrelations of any sort can be represented in experience, then one will\nthink Searle's view is false. \n\nIn principle several replies to these objections are open to defenders\nof Searle's position. First, they can claim that what is needed for\nrepresentations of (a) and (b) is not so cognitively sophisticated\nafter all. Second, they can deny that the cognitively sophisticated\nand cognitively unsophisticated creatures have experiences with the\nsame contents. Third, they can argue that such causal relations really\nare present in visual phenomenology, for example by contrasting visual\nexperiences of seeing objects with visual experiences of imagining\nthem. Searle himself pursues the last strategy in his 1989. \n\nThe discussion so far has assumed that ordinary objects are\nrepresented in at least some experiences. Some philosophers assume\nthat ordinary objects are represented in visual experience, but this\nis a matter of some controversy. According to theories on which visual\nexperience represents only very low-level properties, such as color,\nthe shapes of facing surfaces, their illumination properties and\nnothing more, visual experience does not carry information about\nwhether any of the facing surfaces belong to the same ordinary object,\nand does not carry information about whether there are any ordinary\nobjects in the immediate environment at all. Instead, visual\nexperience represents that low-level properties are instantiated at\ncertain locations, without taking a stand on whether ordinary objects\nare instantiating them. A version of this view is defended by Austen\nClark (2000, ch. 5), who argues that experience represents colors (and\nperhaps other low-level properties) instantiated in regions of\nspace-time around the perceiver, and nothing else. In Clark's terms,\nreference within experience is limited to reference to places: these\nare the only things to which properties are attributed in\nexperience. Clark refines his view in 2004. \n\nSome perceptual experiences arguably represent objects as existing\nindependently of the subject's mind (where something is\nmind-independent only if it does not depend for its existence on being\nperceived). One might think that representing that something exists\nindependently of being perceived is a precondition for representing\nthe occurrence of more mundane happenings in the external world, such\nas a tomato's being round, or a cat's sitting on a mat. Representing\nmind-independence is thus arguably a fundamental kind of content. In\nwhat different ways might experiences represent things as mind-independent? \n\nOne debate in this area (already mentioned in connection with spatial\nrepresentation) is whether a visual experience's representing things\nas occupying three dimensions suffices to represent things as\nmind-independent (see Strawson 1958, Peacocke 1983, Smith 2002). \n\nAnother idea, prominent in the writings of Merleau-Ponty 1945 and\nHusserl 1900, is that some experiences are about things in the world\nexternal to the mind in virtue of representing possible interaction\nbetween the subject and the thing represented. For instance, according\nto one version of this view, a visual experience's representing (say)\na bird as mind-independent consists (at least in part) in its\nrepresenting that if the subject moves relative to the bird, different\nparts of the bird will come into view, and that if something opaque\nmoves between the subject's eyes and the bird, then the bird will be\noccluded. More generally, the idea is that an object looks\nmind-independent if it looks as if different perspectives on it may be\ntaken. \n\nIt is clear that subjects have some sort of expectations to this\neffect. But what concerns Merleau-Ponty and Husserl is what bearing\nthese expectations have on experience itself. These two philosophers\nagreed that experience would not be what it is without such\nexpectations; but they disagreed about how exactly they are\nincorporated into experience. According to Merleau-Ponty, the\n‘expectations’ took the form of ‘readiness’ on\nthe part of the subject to move her body relative to an object in\norder to get a better view, if she so wished. Rather than posit mental\nstates that represent the possibility and possible results of\nsuch interaction, Merleau-Ponty thought that such representation was\nimplicit in the subject's own dispositions. This idea has been\ndeveloped in the literature on so-called ‘embodied\ncognition’ (see Clark 1997, Hurley 2000, Noe and O’Regan\n2001). Husserl, in contrast, held that the subject's\nexpectations about how phenomenology would change with\nchanges in the perceiver's apparent movement were presented in\nexperience along with other properties, such as location and\nshape. Similar ideas are developed in Smith 2002 and Siegel\n2006b. \n\nA third idea in the area is that tactile experiences themselves, by\nvirtue of their phenomenology alone, represent things as external to\nthe subject's body. Consider the experience of grasping a rounded\nbottle. In experiencing the limits of one's body, one seems\nsimultaneously to experience the surfaces of things external to\none. This seem to yield two ways of describing tactile phenomenology:\nit involves both a feeling of pressure, located roughly at the places\non the hands where the glass is touching; and a feeling of something\nspatially external to the body, located at the point where it touches\nthe body. Moreover, tactile experiences of grasping a rounded bottle\nseems to represent the surfaces touching each part of the hand as\nsurfaces that are part of the same object, so that it is also part of\nwhat the experience represents that the surfaces extend through space\nnot occupied by the body. If so, then tactile experiences represent\nboth happenings inside the body and things outside the body. \n\nNow, in principle something could exist in the space outside a\nsubject's body, yet not exist independently of that subject's\nmind. But assuming that things outside the body are not also internal\nto the mind, this would be a way of representing things outside the\nmind as well. For further discussion of the relation between tactile\nexperience and mind-independence, see O'Shaughnessy 1989, Martin 1992b,\nSmith 2002, Condillac 1947. \n\nMany philosophers hold that beliefs and concepts are related\nin the following way: in order to have a belief that x is\nF, for any object x and any property F, a\nsubject must have concepts of the object and the property, and must\ndeploy those concepts in the belief. When concepts and\nbeliefs are related in this way, belief content is said to be\nconceptual. Call this view belief conceptualism\n(endorsed by Dretske 1981 and Martin 1992a, among others). Belief\nconceptualism is typically defended on the grounds that beliefs differ\nfrom one another according to which concepts one has. One can believe\nthat whales swim without believing that large sea-dwelling mammals\nswim, even though whales are large sea-dwelling mammals. According to\na common defense of belief conceptualism, the relevant beliefs differ\nin which concepts the thinker is deploying, and that explains how it\nis that someone can have one of these beliefs without the\nother. According to a related defense of belief conceptualism, it\nexplains why some thinkers cannot have any thoughts about some subject\nmatter. Suppose the thinker lacked the concept ‘whale’:\nshe had no idea what whales were, nor even that there was such a\nthing. Arguably such a thinker could not believe that whales swim,\nthat whales are blue, or anything else about whales. According to\nbelief conceptualism, this is because she lacks the concept of a\nwhale. A full specification of belief conceptualism would require\nexplicating what concepts are, and what it is to possess and deploy\none. \n\nIf beliefs have conceptual content, a question arises about whether\nexperiences do as well. Here it is useful to distinguish between two\ntheses about experiences. The first concerns concepts explicitly, and\nis the straightforward analog of the thesis above. \n\nThe second thesis says that the contents of experiences are the same\nkind of content as belief contents. This thesis does not mention\nconcepts explicitly. \n\nIn principle two strands to the debate about the role of concepts in\nexperience contents can be distinguished: whether experiences have any\ncontents that cannot be believed, and whether concepts play the same\nrole in the contents of beliefs as they play in the contents of\nexperience. Some philosophers accept the same-content thesis and\nbelief-conceptualism but deny experience-conceptualism, e.g., Tye\n(2005). Speaks (2005, 2009) defends same-content thesis but denies experience-conceptualism. \n\nExperience conceptualism and the same-content thesis go naturally with\nthe views (discussed in\n Section 2.2\n above) that link the content of experience to the contents of beliefs,\neither by identifying experiences with beliefs or with dispositions to\nform beliefs. However, McDowell (1994), Sedivy (1996) and Brewer (1999)\nendorse both theses while denying that experiences and beliefs are\nlinked in either of these ways. They defend both theses on the grounds\nthat experiences can provide justification for beliefs only if these\ntheses are true. Peacocke (2001a), Byrne (1996), Heck (2000) and others\nhave objected to these ‘epistemic’ defenses of experience\nconceptualism on the grounds that experience can stand in inferential\nrelations with beliefs if they have accuracy conditions, and they can\nhave accuracy conditions even if experience conceptualism is\nfalse. (Earlier defenses of experience-conceptualism are found in\nCraig (1976) and Peacocke (1983)). \n\nDretske and Martin have argued against experience conceptualism on the\ngrounds that it cannot reflect the informational richness of\nexperience (see Dretske 1981, Martin 1992a, see also Bermudez and\nMacpherson 1999) and Chuard (2007). The main idea\nthat experiences can (and typically do) convey information about so\nmany objects, properties and relations in the environment that it is\nimplausible to suppose in those cases that the subject could possess\nand deploy concepts for every object, property and relation that\nexperience represents. The richness argument thus has two main parts:\nthe first part defending the alleged phenomenal and informational\nrichness of experience; the second defending that inference from\nrichness to the falsity of experiential conceptualism. \n\nMartin in his 1992a makes a version of the richness argument against\nexperiential conceptualism. His strategy is to consider cases in which\none remembers a perceived object or property that one did not notice\nat the time of the experience itself. In Martin's example, someone is\nlooking for cufflinks in a drawer, and fails to see them even though\nthey are right there in front of him; but later on, when remembering\nthe look of the drawer's contents, realizes that the cufflinks were\namong them. The fact (if it is a fact) that one can have such memories\nsuggests that the cufflinks were perceived consciously after all. \n\nHow is this sort of case supposed to counter experiential\nconceptualism? If deploying a concept of an object or property is\nsufficient for noticing it, then the fact that one can perceive\nsomething without noticing it implies that one can perceive something\nwithout forming a concept of it. And that in turn suggests that one\ncan represent an object or property in experience without forming a\nconcept of it—contra experiential conceptualism. \n\nDretske develops the richness argument slightly differently. He\ndistinguishes between digital and analog ways of\nencoding information, where the difference between these is analogous\nto the difference between the way statements and pictures\n(respectively) encode information. When information that s is\nF is encoded in digital form (as in a sentence, for example),\nno extra information is carried in the encoding; but when information\nthat s if F is encoded in analog form (as in a\nphotograph, for example), extra information will usually be carried in\nthe encoding. After explicating the difference between analog and\ndigital encodings of information, Dretske (in his 1981) writes,\n“The traditional idea that knowledge, belief and thought involve\nconcepts while sensation (or sensory experience) does not is\nreflected in this coding difference”.  Dretske thinks that\nexperiences encode information in the analog way, whereas beliefs\nencode information in the digital way. This view targets both the\nsame-content thesis, and experiential conceptualism. \n\nA different argument against experiential conceptualism appeals to the\nidea that the contents of experience are sometimes very finely\ngrained. The idea here is that experiences often provide\ndetailed, determinate information, in contrast to thought. Consider\nthe case of color experience. If you have an experience as of\nsomething red, you will experience it as being a determinate shade of\nred. In contrast, if you think that something is red, there need not\nbe any determinate shade of red such that you think that it is that\nshade of red. It is worth noting that an experience could be\nfinely-grained without being informationally rich—as a visual\nexperience would if it represented nothing but a uniform field\n(sometimes called a ‘ganzfeld’) of a single color. \n\nIn his 1995, Tye attacks experience-conceptualism using the example of\ndeterminate color properties, which he says can be represented in\nexperience even by subjects who lack concepts of them. A similar point\nis made by Raffman (1995) who discusses evidence that humans\nperceptually discriminate more shades of color than they remember and\nhave concepts of.  It is supposed to be independently plausible that\nthe discriminated shades are represented in experience; so if the\nsubjects really do lack concepts of them, then experiential\nconceptualism is false. A similar line of thought is hinted at by\nEvans (1982), who asks (apparently rhetorically) “Do we really\nunderstand the proposal that we have as many colour concepts as there\nare shades of colour that we can sensibly discriminate?”\n(229). \n\nIn response to this line of thought, McDowell (1994) has proposed that\nthe subjects really do possess fine-grained color concepts, albeit\ndemonstrative ones. This proposal has sparked debate about\nwhat counts as possessing a demonstrative concept. One point of debate\nconcerns whether a subject counts as having a demonstrative concept of\na shade of color, only if she can re-identify the shade on subsequent\noccasions. If so, then McDowell's argument fails, since this is\nprecisely what human subjects cannot always do. It is a matter of\ncontroversy, however, whether having demonstrative concepts does\nrequire this (as Kelly 2001 argues), or whether there can be one-off\ndemonstrative concepts. Another point of debate raised by McDowell's\nconcerns whether it is possible to form demonstrative concepts of the\nshade represented in experience in cases of illusion, when the shade\nrepresented in experience differs from the shade of the thing seen. If\ndemonstrative concepts of color shades can pick out only shades\nactually had by the thing demonstrated (as Heck 2000 contends), then\nagain McDowell's argument fails. However, it is again a matter of\ncontroversy whether demonstrative concepts are limited in this way.\nYet another point of debate in this area is whether experience itself\nwould be needed to anchor demonstrative concepts in the first place —\nin which case, it is said, they could not already be constituted by\nthem (Heck defends this view). \n\nThis section reviews some proposals about the contents of experience\nthat use the label ‘non-conceptual content’. \n\nOne way to argue against the same-content thesis is to assume, or\nindependently defend, a theory of belief content, and then offer a\npositive account of experience content that differs from it. This is\nPeacocke's strategy in his 1992. (Note the change in view from\nexperiential conceptualism, which Peacocke defends in his\n1983). Peacocke accepts belief conceptualism, and has the view that\nbelief contents are Fregean, composed of Fregean senses. Peacocke\ndescribes a kind of content called scenario content that is\nnot composed of Fregean senses, but is the content of\nexperiences. Scenario content is a set of ways of filling out the\nspace around the perceiver, relative to an origin and axes marking\ndirections, that is consistent with the perceiver's experience being\nveridical. Peacocke stresses that although spatial concepts may be\nneeded to specify a scenario, those concepts need not be possessed by\nsubjects whose experiences have that scenario content. Thus, according\nto Peacocke, spatial properties (such as coming from the left of the\nperceiver, or being approximately three feet away) can be represented\nin experiences, even when the subject lacks the concept ‘to the\nleft’ or ‘being approximately three feet away’. If\nexperiences have scenario content, and if Peacocke is right that the\nrelevant concepts are not required for experiences to have scenario\ncontent, then experience conceptualism is false (barring the necessary\naccompaniment to scenario content of other contents that can be had\nonly if the subject possesses and deploys concepts of the very ways of\nfilling out the space around the perceiver that are specified by\nscenario content). \n\nAccording to Peacocke, one role of scenario content is to make it\npossible for the subject to form demonstrative concepts, such as ones\nthat might naturally be expressed by that figure, that\ncolor, that shape, where the figure, color or shape\npicked out by the concept is one that is represented in\nexperience. Like demonstrative expressions, demonstrative concepts\npick out different things on different occasions, and as Peacocke sees\nit the role of experience is to anchor a demonstrative concept to its\nreferent. Positioned scenario content is the content of experience\nthat does this. \n\nIn another example involving Mach figures (discussed in\n Section 4.2), \n one focuses on a single four-sided equilateral figure, and contrasts\nthe experience of seeing it as a square and seeing it as a\ndiamond. The experiences supposedly differ phenomenally. According to\nPeacocke, there can be no difference in the scenario content of these\nexperiences, because they represent the space around the perceiver as\nfilled in in the same way. Rather, according to Peacocke, the\ndifference is in the way in which the very same shape\nproperty is represented in experience.  The central claim in support\nof this view is that the properties represented do not differ. In his\n(2001a) Peacocke offers two other examples in support of this\nclaim. First, there are supposedly two ways of hearing the interval\nthat sounds when middle C and F-sharp just above it are played on a\npiano: one and the same interval, he says, can be heard as an\naugmented fourth, or as a diminished fifth. Second, a matrix of evenly\nspaced dots can be seen as a set of rows or a set of columns. \n\nThe multiple ‘ways’ in which the same property can be\nrepresented, according to Peacocke, are not modes of presentation of\nthe sort that constitute the contents of beliefs. In the three\nputative examples of single properties that are represented in\ndifferent ways (the four-sided figure, the middle C/F-sharp interval,\nand the arrangement of dots), there are (according to Peacocke)\nmultiple concepts in the vicinity that pick out the same shape,\ninterval, or arrangement. The concepts ‘regular diamond’\nand ‘regular square’, or simply two occurrences of\n‘that shape’, one for each way of seeing the four-sided\nfigure; the concepts ‘augmented fourth’ and\n‘diminished fifth’ in the case of the interval; and the\nconcepts ‘row’ and ‘column’ in the case of the\ndots. These concepts differ from the perceptual ‘ways’ of\nrepresenting the shape (or the interval or the dot-arrangement),\naccording to Peacocke, in that the perceptual ‘ways’ make\nit possible to acquire the concepts, and so cannot be identical with\nthem. In the case of the two demonstrative shape concepts, these are\nanchored to each shape by the experience of it, and in order to play\nthis role, they cannot be the same as demonstrative concepts (a point\nechoed by Heck). In his (1992), Peacocke uses the label\n‘proto-propositional content’ for contents just\ndescribed. The discussion of these examples in his (2001) is intended\nto clarify the 1992 discussion (see 2001, fn 14). \n\nAccording to the state view, an experience E has\nnon-conceptual content just in case (i) E has accuracy\nconditions; and (ii) the subject of E need not possess any of\nthe concepts used to specify E's correctness conditions. This\nthesis that experiences have non-conceptual content in this sense is\nsometimes called the state view of non-conceptual content\n(Heck 2000), because it is only a condition on the possession of\nconcepts, rather than being a condition on the kind of content had by\nE. Note that while the state view is incompatible with\nexperiential conceptualism (assuming that the concepts required by the\nlatter are those used in a canonical specification), it is neutral on\nthe same-content thesis. Consider a subject who doesn't possess the\nconcept RED29 (where red29 is a specific shade of red), but whose\nexperience represents something as being red29. Nothing in the state\nview prevents some other subject from believing the contents of the\nfirst subject's experience.  Some philosophers (e.g., Crane 1992) have\ndefended the state view using arguments from richness and\nfine-grainedness of experience (reviewed in \n Section 6.1). \n Other defenses of the state view include Stalnaker (1998a). \n\nAnother kind of content that is called ‘non-conceptual\ncontent’ is Cussins’ construction-theoretic\ncontent; this is introduced in\n Section 4.2. \n\nAs the term ‘experiences’ is used here, it is definitional\nof experiences that they have a phenomenal character. If they have\ncontents as well, then a question arises as to how these two features\nare related. It is useful to contrast different views on the relation\nbetween the content of an experience and its phenomenology by\nconsidering phenomenally indistinguishable experiences, or\nexperiences with the ‘same phenomenology’, on the one\nhand; and experiences with the same content, on the other. A\npreliminary remark about this notion is in order. \n\nThe notion of phenomenal indistinguishability of unrepeatable\nexperiences cannot be defined as a statistical notion. Exactly how it\nshould be defined is a matter of controversy. Gottlob Frege and Moritz\nSchlick raised doubts about the coherence of the notion of\ninterpersonal phenomenal indistinguishability, (these\n‘Frege-Schlick’ doubts are discussed by Stalnaker 2000,\nShoemaker 1981 and 1996) In addition, though phenomenal\nindistinguishabilty is commonly taken to be a sort of\nphenomenal sameness, some philosophers use the expression to\npick out a merely epistemic notion, involving experiences that\nsubjects cannot distinguish (for discussion, see T. Williamson (1990),\nMartin (2004), Siegel (2004), and entry on the disjunctive theory of perception.) Martin and Williamson regard it as a substantive claim\nthat experiences said to be ‘phenomenally the same’ have anything more than an epistemic property of indistinguishability in\ncommon. \n\nThere are several relations in which the content of an experience has\nbeen thought to stand to its phenomenology. One position holds that\ncontent suffices for phenomenology. A stronger position holds that the\ncontent of experience is identical with its phenomenology. A third\nposition is that the phenomenology of an experience determines its\ncontent. These positions and others are discussed below. \n\nRepresentationalism (or intentionalism) is the\nthesis that phenomenal properties are determined by representational\nproperties. The thesis is sometimes stated as the supervenience claim\nthat phenomenal properties supervene on the representational\nproperties of an experience, so that any two experiences that have the\nsame representational properties have the same phenomenology. \n\nRepresentationalism comes in many versions. One way in which versions\ndiffer is that they may be claims about all sensory experience, or\njust some kinds of sensory experience. (Tye 1995 defends a version of\nrepresentationalism about all sensory experience; most discussions to\ndate have focused on visual experience, as does Pautz 2010.) \n\nA challenge to across-the-board representationalism comes from\nexperiences in modalities where it is unclear whether the experiences\nrepresent happenings in the space outside the body, such as gustation,\nolfaction, and experiences of afterimages. However, the notion of\naccuracy conditions that defines the notion of content we’ve\nbeen working with leaves it open whether those conditions pertain to\nthe world outside the mind or not. Consider whether olfactory\nexperiences represent anything about the smells or sources of smells\noutside the body (for discussion see Smith (2002), chapter 5, Batty 2010, 2011, Richardson 2013). There\nis a coherent view on which an olfactory experience can have accuracy\nconditions, even if they are of the form ‘an odor like so is\npresent to me’. To take another example, consider\nafterimages. According to Loar (2003), experiences of afterimages\nrepresent ‘luminous happenings in strange spaces’, which\nsuggests that an experience of an afterimage could include a content\nroughly like ‘there is a reddish luminous occurrence over\nthere’, where ‘there’ indicates a position in the\n‘strange space’. (Perhaps the experience is neutral about\nwhether the space is inside or outside the mind).  The notion of\naccuracy conditions also leaves it open whether there could be\naccuracy conditions that were met whenever a subject had an experience\nwith those conditions. For instance, suppose that sense can be made of\nthe notion of ‘mental space’ or ‘subjective\nspace’, and that some experiences have accuracy conditions\nconcerning smells, tastes or afterimages that reside in such\nspace. Given these suppositions, one might think that whenever an\nexperience represents that something occurs in such spaces, the\nexperience is accurate. In opposition to this idea, Bengson (2013) argues that the visual experiences of pink glow or seeing blackness, and  the auditory experience of ringing in the ears fail to attribute color, luminance, or auditory properties to anything at all, and so resist analysis in terms of accuracy conditions.  \n\nAnother potential problem for across-the-board representationalism\nconcerns experiences in different sense-modalities. As stated,\nrepresentationalism requires that any two experiences with the same\ncontent have the same phenomenology, even if the experiences occur in\ndifferent sensory modalities. Seeing something square and touching\nsomething square are phenomenally different.  If representationalism\nis true for both haptic-tactile and visual experiences, then these\nexperiences cannot have the same content. Normally two such\nexperiences would probably not have exactly the same content anyway,\nfor instance if the visual experience represented properties (e.g.,\ncolors) that the tactile experience didn't. But abstracting away from\nthose differences, there is a strong intuition that the visual\nphenomenology correlated with visually representing squareness differs\nfrom the tactile phenomenology correlated with feeling something to be\nsquare. It seems that across-the-board representationalism must either\n(i) deny the intuition that the visual phenomenology correlated with\nvisually representing squareness differs from the tactile\nphenomenology correlated with feeling something to be square, or else\n(ii) deny that the contents related to representations of squareness\nreally are the same after all, so that each modality (or natural\ngrouping of modalities) has a special kind of content to call its own,\nand one cannot experience by one modality exactly the same thing as\none can experience by another. Response (ii) is illustrated by one\nanswer to Molyneux's question (see entry on\n Molyneux's problem)\n whether someone born blind and was familiar with the feel of\na cube could recognize a cube upon seeing it for the time, without\nalso touching it. If the answer to Molyneux's question is that the\npreviously blind person could not visually recognize cubes, one might\nconjecture that this is because the shape properties represented by\nvisual experience on the one hand and by haptic tactile experience on\nthe other differ. \n\nAnother response to this potential problem revises the thesis of\nrepresentationalism, construing the representational properties that\ndetermine phenomenology as attitude-content complexes rather than\ncontents alone. For example, Chalmers 2004 distinguishes pure\nrepresentational properties—the property of having a\ncertain content—from impure representational\nproperties—the property of having a certain content\nrepresented in a certain way.  Examples of impure representational\nproperties include the property of having a certain content\nrepresented in modality M, and that of having attitude\nA to a certain content. Impure representationalism\nis then the thesis that impure representational properties determine\nphenomenology, so that any two experiences with the same impure\nrepresentational properties have the same phenomenology. This position\nallows that experiences in different modalities, or experiences that\ninstantiate different attitudes, could have the same content, yet\ndiffer phenomenally because, say, one is visual and the other\nkinesthetic. For instance, perhaps both represent that one's hand is\nmoving, or that something is round. Versions of impure\nrepresentationalism are held by Lycan 1996, Chalmers 2004, 2006, Pautz 2010. \n\nThe converse of representationalism is the thesis (put roughly) that\nthe phenomenology of an experience determines its content. The thesis\nis often more precisely formulated as a supervenience claim. Two\ntheses here should be distinguished: \n\n(2) Any two phenomenally identical experiences have the same accuracy\nconditions. \n\nClaim (2) says that all accuracy conditions are determined by\nphenomenology, claim (1) says that at least some are. \n\nClaim (1) constrains which contents experiences have. Shoemaker\ndevelops this idea in a series of papers (1994, 2005). See also\nChalmers (2004, 2005). \n\nThe two theses above are both entailed by a strong version of\nrepresentationalism, which combines representationalism with the\nthesis that any two experiences with the same phenomenal properties\nhave the same representational properties.  This sort of\nrepresentationalism is sometimes held in the guise of an identity\nclaim: the claim that phenomenal properties are identical to\nrepresentational properties. Versions of this view are defended by\nDretske 1995, Tye 2000, and Carruthers 2000.  But theses (1) and (2)\ncan be held even if one rejects these strong representationalist\ntheses.  Some philosophers hold (1) on the grounds that the\nrepresentational content of an experience is grounded in its\nphenomenology.  According to Horgan and Tienson 2002, for example,\nthere is a kind of content that experiences have in virtue of their\nphenomenology, so that their phenomenology has explanatory priority\nover the content itself. This view is suggested by Siewert (1998) and\ndefended by Kriegel (2002; 2013), and see entry on phenomenal intentionality. \n\n \n\nSome philosophers deny both (1) and (2) on the grounds that the\naccuracy-conditions of an experience are determined in part by\nextra-cranial features, while the phenomenology of an experience is\nnot.  These philosophers are internalist about phenomenology, but\nexternalist about experience content. (Block 1990 and 1996, Speaks 2009). \n\nSo far, we've discussed some reasons to think that there are\ncontentful experiences, and some questions about what sorts of\ncontents there might be. A different cluster of questions concerns\nwhat makes it the case that an experience has the contents it\ndoes. How is representation of any property is possible? Two sorts of\ntheories addressing this question are addressed  in\n Section 8.2 \n and Section 8.3, \n and some possible constraints on such theories are reviewed in\n Section 8.1. \n\nExternalism about experience content (or\nexperience-content externalism) is the thesis that subjects\nalike in properties that are intrinsic to them need not share the same\nexperience contents. If experience-content externalism is true, then\nwhat makes it the case that an experience has the content it does\ndepends on external relations to things outside the subject's skin,\nsuch as social relations between the subject and others, or causal\nrelations to things in the environment. Defenders of\nexperience-content externalism include Dretske, Lycan, and Tye, all of\nwhom argue for experiential externalism on the grounds that the\nalleged best naturalistic theories of intentionality for experience\nare externalist theories. (For discussion of externalism about the\ncontent of other mental states, see the entry on\n external theories of content.) \n\nA thesis opposed to experience-content externalism is\nexperience-content internalism. Put roughly, this is the\nthesis that experience content is determined entirely by the\nindividual's intrinsic properties. Total experience-content\ninternalism is the thesis that all experience content is\ndetermined by the individual's intrinsic properties (i.e., that two\nsubjects alike in all intrinsic respects will have exactly the same\nexperiential contents). Partial experience-content\ninternalism is the thesis that there is a sort of\nexperiential content that is determined by a subject's intrinsic\nproperties (i.e., two subjects alike in all intrinsic respects will\nhave the same experiential contents of this sort.  This thesis allows\nthat experiences may also have some externally determined\ncontents. Total experiential internalism is defended by Segal 1991 and\nMatthews 1985; partial experience-content internalism is defended by\nChalmers 2004. \n\nExternalism and internalism about contents are distinct theses from\nexternalism and internalism about phenomenology. Internalism about\nphenomenology is the thesis that intrinsic duplicates are\nphenomenal duplicates.  Externalism about phenomenology is\nthe denial of this thesis, on the grounds that phenomenology is\ndetermined in part by factors outside a subject's skin.  Externalism\nabout phenomenology is sometimes motivated by representationalism\nabout phenomenology combined with externalism about content.  If one\nis externalist about experiential content, and if one holds that the\ncontent and the phenomenology of an experience co-vary, then one must\nalso be an externalist about phenomenology.  This thesis is defended\nby Dretske (1995) and Lycan (2001), and criticized by Block (1990) and\n(1996). For further discussion, see the entry on\n external theories of content. \n\nOne of the main motivations for experience-content internalism is the\nidea that only internally individuated states can figure in\npsychological explanations. This mirrors one of the main motivations\nfor internalism about the contents of other mental states. The general\nissue is reviewed in the entry \n on externalism. \n In the case of experience, philosophers have pursued this debate with\nrespect to Marr's computational theory of vision, one of the leading\nempirical theories of visual processing. The debate is over whether\nMarr's theory itself posits any externally-individuated contents, or\nwhether the contents it posits are all individuated\ninternalistically. If Marr's theory is correct and explanatory, and if\nthe representational contents it posits are externally individuated,\nthen it provides a counter-example to individualists’ claims\nthat only internally-determined contents figure in psychological\nexplanation. The debate thus focuses on exactly what commitments\nMarr's theory makes about the individuation of perceptual content. \n\nThough Marr's theory posits representational states, it does not make\nuse of the notion of a visual experience, and it is an open question\nhow experiences map onto the stages of computational visual processing\nposited by the theory (see Marr (1982), section 7.2 for Marr's own\nbrief discussion of this issue). Marr's theory seeks to explain how\nthe visual system arrives at representations of a three-dimensional\narray given retinal stimulation as input. The retinal stimulations, or\n‘gray arrays’, are computational descriptions that\nrepresent light and intensity values in a two-dimensional coordinate\nsystem. According to Marr, the visual system computes a description of\na three-dimensional scene in three stages. First, given the gray\narrays, it computes a ‘primal sketch’ of reflectance\nchanges on the surface outside the viewer. Next, with the primal\nsketch as input, it computes a ‘2.5-D sketch’ of this\nsurface, a sketch that explicitly represents information concerning\ndepth and contours of the surfaces relative to the viewer. (The depth\ninformation concerns only facing surfaces, so that the 2.5 sketch\ncontains no information—and therefore no\nmisinformation—about how surfaces continue out of view.)\nFinally, given the 2.5 sketch as input, the visual system computes\ninformation concerning all three dimensions of objects, one that\ndescribes their shapes and orientations. According to the theory, the\ncomputation at each stage combines the input from the previous stage\nwith assumptions that are supposedly built into the visual system. \n\nThe debate is over whether Marr's theory allows two subjects, call\nthem V and V*, to have different visual contents,\nwhen V is a normal perceiver on earth, and V* is an\nintrinsic duplicate of V, with the same gray arrays as those\nhad by V, and undergoes the same sequence of computations,\nviewed internally. V*'s gray arrays, however, have different\ndistal causes. Borrowing an example from Burge (1986), suppose that\nV's gray arrays are typically caused by shadows, and\noccasionally caused by cracks; whereas V* lives in a world\nwhere the optical laws are different, and there are no instances of\nthe sort of shadows that cause V's gray arrays. According to\nBurge, Marr's theory says that the contentful visual states that are\ncomputed from V's gray arrays always represent shadows, and\nthus the ones that arise from gray arrays caused by cracks are\nmisperceptions; while the contentful visual states that are computed\nfrom V*'s gray arrays represent cracks. Neither V\nnor V* can discriminate the relevant sorts of cracks from the\nrelevant sort of shadows, but according to Burge this is not\nsufficient to make their contents the same. According to Gabriel\nSegal, in contrast, the contentful visual states computed from both\nV and V*'s gray arrays represent a property more\ngeneral than the property of being a crack or the property of being a\nshadow—a ‘crackdow’. (For further discussion, see\nMatthews 1988, Burge 1988, Davies 1991, Shapiro 1993, Egan\n1991, and Patterson 1996.) \n\nDretske and Tye have each proposed that an experience has the contents\nit does in virtue of having certain functional properties. \n\nAccording to Dretske, an experience has its content fixed by the\nbiological, phylogenetically determined function of the system (or\ncombination of systems: (1995), 22) of which it is a state. The\nfunction of the system is to provide information: for instance, the\nfunction of the auditory system is to provide information about pitch,\nintensity, timbre, and direction of sound, and it does this by\noccupying different states corresponding to different values for each\nof these properties. The different states are all the different\nauditory experiences that a given system is capable of being in. The\nsame main idea is developed by Ruth Millikan, who focuses on mental\ncontent generally rather than on experience content per\nse. \n\nTye's account of experience content derives from the theories of\nintentionality for belief developed by Stampe (1977) and Stalnaker\n(1984). According to Tye, an experience S of creature\nc has the content that p just in case: “If\noptimal conditions were to obtain, S would be tokened in\ncreature c if and only if P were the case; moreover,\nin these circumstances, S would be tokened in c\nbecause P is the case” (2000, 136, note omitted; cf. 1995,\n101). For the case of visual experiences, Tye, like Dretske, appeals\nto the design of the visual system to explain what “optimal\nconditions” are: “In the case of evolved creatures, it is\nnatural to hold that such conditions for vision involve the various\ncomponents of the visual system operating as they were designed to do\nin the sort of external environment in which they were designed to\noperate” (Tye 2000, 138). \n\nBoth kinds of theories are externalist: according to them,\nwhat makes it the case that a subject's mental state has the content\nit does is in part facts about the subject's environment. Any\nobjections to externalism about mental content are thus also\nobjections to these theories of intentionality. For instance, suppose\nthere was a creature, Swampman, who suddenly popped into existence due\nto random conglomeration of particles, and happened to be an intrinsic\nmolecular duplicate of, say, Jerry Fodor. Pure externalist theories\n(that is, theories that hold that the only way mental states can have\ncontent is by standing in the right external relations to the\nsubject's environment) are committed to denying that Swampman would\nhave any contentful mental states. Some philosophers have found this\ncommitment counterintuitive. For further discussion of this objection\nand others, see the entry on\n external theories of mental content. \n\nA central challenge facing Dretske's and Millikan's theory is to\nspecify the relevant notions of informational system and\nfunction in an informational system. One question in the area\nis whether informational systems and functions within them are\ncontained within an organism, or whether they rather encompass\nmultiple organisms in a community.  Much work by Millikan has been\ndevoted to this topic. According to her, an informational system\nencompasses both creatures who produce representations, and creatures\nwho use or receive them; and the relevant notion of function is\nsupposed to be defined in terms of both parts of such a system. For\ninstance, in a bee dance, what makes it the case that the bee dance\nrepresents the location of nectar is in part that other bees respond\nto it by flying to the nectar. A analogous challenge for co-variation\ntheories inspired by Stampe and Stalnaker is to specify what the\nrelevant ‘becausal’ relations are. Until these central\nnotions are pinned down, the theories remain programmatic. \n\nOne objection that has been raised against both kinds of informational\ntheories of experience (those that invoke biological functions, and\nthose that invoke co-variation) is that these theories are\ninsufficiently general. According to the objection, there can be\nproperties represented in a subject's experience even if she has not\nbeen in causal contact with instances of those properties before, and\nwhich it is no part of the biological function of the visual system to\nrepresent. For example, consider impossible scenes depicted in Escher\ndrawings, or a hallucination of a color that one has never seen before\n(such as Hume's missing shade of blue). Suppose experiences can\nrepresent that one is standing before an Escher staircase, or that\nsomething is the missing shade of blue. According to Tye's theory,\nthis can happen only if in optimal conditions that type of experience\nis tokened because these things are the case. But since it is\nlogically impossible to be standing before an Escher staircase, this\ncondition can never be met. And if it is nomologically impossible to\nbe seeing anything that is the missing shade of blue, then even if the\nproposed necessary condition in principle can be met, the worlds in\nwhich it is met would seem to be irrelevant ones for the purpose of\nthe theory. So, the objection concludes, Tye's theory must predict\nthat Escher staircases and missing shades of color cannot be\nrepresented in experience. For further discussion of objections to\ninformational theories, see the entry on \n causal theories of mental content.\n \n\nAccording to some philosophers (e.g., Horgan and Tienson 2002; Kriegel 2002, 2013; Siewert 1998), there is a some\ncontent of experience that is constitutively determined by the\nexperience's phenomenology alone (Horgan and Tienson 2002,\np. 524). Horgan and Tienson call this thesis\nphenomenal intentionality (See entry on phenomenal intentionality).\n\n\n A consequence of the thesis is\nthat phenomenology enjoys explanatory priority over\nintentionality. Proponents of phenomenal intentionality take\nphenomenology as a primitive notion, which cannot be reduced to\ncontent, and then try to explain (at least some kinds of) content in\nterms of it. \n\nIf the phenomenal intentionality thesis is true, then phenomenology\ncannot be reduced or identified with content, or with the having of\ncontent. The thesis thus stands in contrast to views defended by\nDretske and Tye according to which the content of experience is wholly\nexplained in causal or functional terms, where one does not need to\ninvoke phenomenology to explain why an experience has the content it\nhas. These latter views leave open the possibility that the content of\nan experience enjoys explanatory priority over its phenomenology, so\nthat one can explain phenomenology in terms of content. \n\nTogether with the assumption (made by Horgan and Tienson and by\nKriegel) that phenomenology is narrow (i.e., shared by intrinsic\nduplicates), the thesis of phenomenal intentionality yields an\ninternalist theory of experience content. This introduces\nanother respect in which phenomenal intentionality stands opposed to\nsome versions of functionalist informational theories of experience\ncontent—namely, those versions that hold that the only\ncontents experiences can have are those had in virtue of the\nfunctional properties of the sort discussed in\n Section 8.2. \n If the thesis of phenomenal intentionality is true and phenomenology\nis narrow, then there are narrow contents that are constitutively\ndetermined by phenomenology. Any objections to narrow content will\nthus also apply to this thesis. For further discussion of narrow\ncontent, see the entry\n on narrow content. \n\nThere is much more research in philosophy to be done on the contents\nof experience. A great deal of theorizing has focused on visual\nexperiences. Even so, none of the questions discussed above are fully\nsettled, and so there is plenty of opportunity for further research on\nany of those topics. Additional topics ripe for future research\ninclude questions such as: what is the relation between perceptual\ncontent and perceptual contact with reality?; how do experiences in\ndifferent modalities interact?; what role does experiential content\nplay in reasoning, in intentional action and more generally in being\nan agent?; and how are perceptual constancies reflected in the\ncontents of experience?; what notion of contents of experience is most\ntheoretically useful for unconscious perception, and how may the\nlatter be distinguished among the varieties of subpersonal information\nprocessing?","contact.mail":"ssiegel@fas.harvard.edu","contact.domain":"fas.harvard.edu"}]
