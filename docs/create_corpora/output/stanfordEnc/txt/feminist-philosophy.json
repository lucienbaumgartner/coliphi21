As they do so, they are also intervening in how\nlongstanding basic philosophical problems are understood. As feminist\nphilosophers carry out work in traditional philosophical fields, from\nethics to epistemology, they have introduced new concepts and\nperspectives that have transformed philosophy itself. They are also\nrendering philosophical previously un-problematized topics, such as\nthe body, class and work, disability, the family, reproduction, the\nself, sex work, human trafficking, and sexuality. And they are\nbringing a particularly feminist lens to issues of science,\nglobalization, human rights, popular culture, and race and racism.\n\nAs this entry describes, feminism is both an intellectual commitment\nand a political movement that seeks justice for women and the end of\nsexism in all forms. Motivated by the quest for social justice,\nfeminist inquiry provides a wide range of perspectives on social,\ncultural, economic, and political phenomena. Yet despite many overall\nshared commitments, there are numerous differences among feminist\nphilosophers regarding philosophical orientation (whether, for\nexample, Continental or analytic), ontological commitments (such as\nthe category of woman), and what kind of political and moral remedies\nshould be sought. \nContemporary feminist philosophical scholarship emerged in the 1970s\nas more women began careers in higher education, including philosophy.\nAs they did so, they also began taking up matters from their own\nexperience for philosophical scrutiny. These scholars were influenced\nboth by feminist movements in their midst as well as by their\nphilosophical training, which was anything but feminist. Until\nrecently one could not go to graduate school to study “feminist\nphilosophy”. While students and scholars could turn to the\nwritings of Simone de Beauvoir or look back historically to the\nwritings of “first wave” feminists like Mary\nWollstonecraft, most of the philosophers writing in the first decades\nof the emergence of feminist philosophy brought their particular\ntraining and expertise to bear on analyzing issues raised by the\nwomen’s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s, such as\nabortion, affirmative action, equal opportunity, the institutions of\nmarriage, sexuality, and love. Additionally, feminist philosophical\nscholarship increasingly focused on the very same types of issues\nphilosophers had been and were dealing with. \nFeminist philosophical scholarship begins with attention to women, to\ntheir roles and locations. What are women doing? What social/political\nlocations are they part of or excluded from? How do their activities\ncompare to those of men? Are the activities or exclusions of some\ngroups of women different from those of other groups and why? What do\nthe various roles and locations of women allow or preclude? How have\ntheir roles been valued or devalued? How do the complexities of a\nwoman’s situatedness, including her class, race, ability, and\nsexuality impact her locations? To this we add attention to the\nexperiences and concerns of women. Have any of women’s\nexperiences or problems been ignored or undervalued? How might\nattention to these transform our current methods or values? And from\nhere we move to the realm of the symbolic. How is the feminine\ninstantiated and constructed within the texts of philosophy? What role\ndoes the feminine play in forming, either through its absence or its\npresence, the central concepts of philosophy? And so on. \nFeminist philosophers brought their philosophical tools to bear on\nthese questions. And since these feminist philosophers employed the\nphilosophical tools they knew best and found most promising, feminist\nphilosophy began to emerge from all the traditions of Western\nphilosophy prevalent at the end of the twentieth century including\nanalytic, Continental, and classical American philosophy. It should\ncome as no surprise then that the thematic focus of their work was\noften influenced by the topics and questions highlighted by these\ntraditions. Hence, as a result, a given question can be taken up and\naddressed from an array of views, sometimes, as discussed below, with\nquite contradictory answers. \nHence feminist philosophical scholarship is not homogeneous either in\nmethods or in conclusions. Indeed, there has been significant debate\nwithin feminist philosophical circles concerning the effectiveness of\nparticular methods within philosophy for feminist goals. Some, for\nexample, have found the methods of analytic philosophy to provide\nclarity of both form and argumentation not found in some schools of\nContinental philosophy, while others have argued that such alleged\nclarity comes at the expense of rhetorical styles and methodological\napproaches that provide insights into affective, psychic, or embodied\ncomponents of human experience. Other feminists find approaches within\nAmerican pragmatism to provide the clarity of form and argumentation\nsometimes missing in Continental approaches and the connection to real\nworld concerns sometimes missing in analytic approaches. \nFounded in 1982 as a venue for feminist philosophical scholarship,\nHypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy has embraced a\ndiversity of methodological approaches in feminist philosophy,\npublishing work from all three traditions. Feminist scholarship in\neach of these traditions is also advanced and supported though\nscholarly exchange at various professional societies, including the\nSociety for Women in Philosophy, founded in the United States in 1972.\nAdditionally, the Society for Analytical Feminism, founded in 1991,\npromotes the study of issues in feminism by methods broadly construed\nas analytic, to examine the use of analytic methods as applied to\nfeminist issues, and to provide a means by which those interested in\nanalytical feminist can meet and exchange ideas. philoSOPHIA was\nestablished in 2005 to promote Continental feminist scholarly and\npedagogical development. The Society for the Study of Women\nPhilosophers was established in 1987 to promote the study of the\ncontributions of women to the history of philosophy. Similar\norganizations and journals on many continents continue to advance\nscholarship in feminist philosophy. \n\n \nMany of the ways in which feminist philosophy is not monolithic will\nbe discussed below. Nevertheless, it is worth noting here at the start\nthat although feminist philosophers have intended that their\nwork—unlike the traditional philosophy they criticize—be\napplicable to all women and reflect the diverse experiences of women,\nin practice it has not always been the case. One important limitation\nthat feminist philosophers are trying to overcome is their\ninsufficient attention to the many interacting ways that human beings\nare oppressed, for example, along lines of race, sexuality, ability,\nclass, religion, and nationality. Feminist philosophy strives for\ninclusivity and pluralism, even if it falls short. \nThe term “feminism” has many different uses and its\nmeanings are often contested. For example, some writers use the term\n“feminism” to refer to a historically specific political\nmovement in the United States and Europe; other writers use it to\nrefer to the belief that there are injustices against women, though\nthere is no consensus on the exact list of these injustices. Although\nthe term “feminism” has a history in English linked with\nwomen’s activism from the late nineteenth century to the\npresent, it is useful to distinguish feminist ideas or beliefs from\nfeminist political movements, for even in periods where there has been\nno significant political activism around women’s subordination,\nindividuals have been concerned with and theorized about justice for\nwomen. So, for example, it makes sense to ask whether Plato was a\nfeminist, given his view that some women should be trained to rule\n(Republic, Book V), even though he was an exception in his\nhistorical context (see, e.g., Tuana 1994). \nOur goal here is not to survey the history of feminism—as a set\nof ideas or as a series of political movements—but rather to\nsketch some of the central uses of the term that are most relevant to\nthose interested in contemporary feminist philosophy. The references\nwe provide below are only a small sample of the work available on the\ntopics in question; more complete bibliographies are available at the\nspecific topical entries and also at the end of this entry. \nIn the mid-1800s the term “feminism” was used to refer to\n“the qualities of females”, and it was not until after the\nFirst International Women’s Conference in Paris in 1892 that the\nterm, following the French term féministe, was used\nregularly in English for a belief in and advocacy of equal rights for\nwomen based on the idea of the equality of the sexes. Although the\nterm “feminism” in English is rooted in the mobilization\nfor woman suffrage in Europe and the United States during the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth century, of course efforts to obtain\njustice for women did not begin or end with this period of activism.\nSo some have found it useful, if controversial, to think of the\nwomen’s movement in the United States as occurring in\n“waves”. On the wave model, the struggle to achieve basic\npolitical rights during the period from the mid-nineteenth century\nuntil the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 counts as\n“First Wave” feminism. Feminism waned between the two\nworld wars, to be “revived” in the late 1960s and early\n1970s as “Second Wave” feminism. In this second wave,\nfeminists pushed beyond the early quest for political rights to fight\nfor greater equality across the board, e.g., in education, the\nworkplace, and at home. More recent transformations of feminism have\nresulted in a “Third Wave”. Third Wave feminists often\ncritique Second Wave feminism for its lack of attention to the\ndifferences among women due to race, ethnicity, class, nationality,\nreligion (see\n Section 2.3\n below; also Breines 2002; Spring 2002), and emphasize\n“identity” as a site of gender struggle. (For more\ninformation on the “wave” model and each of the\n“waves”, see\n Other Internet Resources.)\n  \nHowever, some feminist scholars object to identifying feminism with\nthese particular moments of political activism, on the grounds that\ndoing so eclipses the fact that there has been resistance to male\ndomination that should be considered “feminist” throughout\nhistory and across cultures: i.e., feminism is not confined to a few\n(White) women in the West over the past century or so. Moreover, even\nconsidering only relatively recent efforts to resist male domination\nin Europe and the United States, the emphasis on “First”\nand “Second” Wave feminism ignores the ongoing resistance\nto male domination between the 1920s and 1960s and the resistance\noutside mainstream politics, particularly by women of color and\nworking class women (Cott 1987). \nOne strategy for solving these problems would be to identify feminism\nin terms of a set of ideas or beliefs rather than participation in any\nparticular political movement. As we saw above, this also has the\nadvantage of allowing us to locate isolated feminists whose work was\nnot understood or appreciated during their time. But how should we go\nabout identifying a core set of feminist beliefs? Some would suggest\nthat we should focus on the political ideas that the term was\napparently coined to capture, viz., the commitment to women’s\nequal rights. This acknowledges that commitment to and advocacy for\nwomen’s rights has not been confined to the Women’s\nLiberation Movement in the West. But this too raises controversy, for\nit frames feminism within a broadly liberal approach to political and\neconomic life. Although most feminists would probably agree that there\nis some sense of rights on which achieving equal rights for women is a\nnecessary condition for feminism to succeed, most would also argue\nthat this would not be sufficient. This is because women’s\noppression under male domination rarely if ever consists solely in\ndepriving women of political and legal rights, but also extends into\nthe structure of our society and the content of our culture, the\nworkings of languages and how they shape perceptions and permeate our\nconsciousness (e.g., Bartky 1988, Postl 2017). \nIs there any point, then, to asking what feminism is? Given the\ncontroversies over the term and the politics of circumscribing the\nboundaries of a social movement, it is sometimes tempting to think\nthat the best we can do is to articulate a set of disjuncts that\ncapture a range of feminist beliefs. However, at the same time it can\nbe both intellectually and politically valuable to have a schematic\nframework that enables us to map at least some of our points of\nagreement and disagreement. We’ll begin here by considering some\nof the basic elements of feminism as a political position or set of\nbeliefs. \nIn many of its forms, feminism seems to involve at least two groups of\nclaims, one normative and the other descriptive. The normative claims\nconcern how women ought (or ought not) to be viewed and treated and\ndraw on a background conception of justice or broad moral position;\nthe descriptive claims concern how women are, as a matter of fact,\nviewed and treated, alleging that they are not being treated in\naccordance with the standards of justice or morality invoked in the\nnormative claims. Together the normative and descriptive claims\nprovide reasons for working to change the way things are; hence,\nfeminism is not just an intellectual but also a political\nmovement. \nSo, for example, a liberal approach of the kind already mentioned\nmight define feminism (rather simplistically here) in terms of two\nclaims: \nOn this account, that women and men ought to have equal rights and\nrespect is the normative claim; and that women are denied equal rights\nand respect functions here as the descriptive claim. Admittedly, the\nclaim that women are disadvantaged with respect to rights and respect\nis not a “purely descriptive” claim since it plausibly\ninvolves an evaluative component. However, our point here is simply\nthat claims of this sort concern what is the case not what ought to be\nthe case. Moreover, as indicated by the ellipsis above, the\ndescriptive component of a substantive feminist view will not be\narticulable in a single claim, but will involve an account of the\nspecific social mechanisms that deprive women of, e.g., rights and\nrespect. For example, is the primary source of women’s\nsubordination her role in the family? (Engels 1845; Okin 1989). Or is\nit her role in the labor market? (Bergmann 2002). Is the problem\nmales’ tendencies to sexual violence (and what is the source of\nthese tendencies?)? (Brownmiller 1975; MacKinnon 1987). Or is it\nsimply women’s biological role in reproduction? (Firestone\n1970). \nDisagreements within feminism can occur with respect to\neither the descriptive or normative claims, e.g., feminists differ on\nwhat would count as justice or injustice for women (what counts as\n“equality”, “oppression”,\n“disadvantage”, what rights should everyone be accorded?)\n, and what sorts of injustice women in fact suffer (what aspects of\nwomen’s current situation are harmful or unjust?). Disagreements\nmay also lie in the explanations of the injustice: two feminists may\nagree that women are unjustly being denied proper rights and respect\nand yet substantively differ in their accounts of how or why the\ninjustice occurs and what is required to end it (Jaggar 1994). \nDisagreements between feminists and non-feminists can occur with\nrespect to both the normative and descriptive claims as well, e.g.,\nsome non-feminists agree with feminists on the ways women ought to be\nviewed and treated, but don’t see any problem with the way\nthings currently are. Others disagree about the background moral or\npolitical views. \nIn an effort to suggest a schematic account of feminism, Susan James\ncharacterizes feminism as follows: \nFeminism is grounded on the belief that women are oppressed or\ndisadvantaged by comparison with men, and that their oppression is in\nsome way illegitimate or unjustified. Under the umbrella of this\ngeneral characterization there are, however, many interpretations of\nwomen and their oppression, so that it is a mistake to think of\nfeminism as a single philosophical doctrine, or as implying an agreed\npolitical program. (James 1998: 576) \nJames seems here to be using the notions of “oppression”\nand “disadvantage” as placeholders for more substantive\naccounts of injustice (both normative and descriptive) over which\nfeminists disagree. \nSome might prefer to define feminism in terms of a normative claim\nalone: feminists are those who believe that women are entitled to\nequal rights, or equal respect, or…(fill in the blank with\none’s preferred account of injustice), and one is not required\nto believe that women are currently being treated unjustly. However,\nif we were to adopt this terminological convention, it would be harder\nto identify some of the interesting sources of disagreement both with\nand within feminism, and the term “feminism” would lose\nmuch of its potential to unite those whose concerns and commitments\nextend beyond their moral beliefs to their social interpretations and\npolitical affiliations. Feminists are not simply those who are\ncommitted in principle to justice for women; feminists take themselves\nto have reasons to bring about social change on women’s\nbehalf. \nTaking “feminism” to entail both normative and empirical\ncommitments also helps make sense of some uses of the term\n“feminism” in recent popular discourse. In everyday\nconversation it is not uncommon to find both men and women prefixing a\ncomment they might make about women with the caveat, “I’m\nnot a feminist, but…”. Of course this qualification might\nbe (and is) used for various purposes, but one persistent usage seems\nto follow the qualification with some claim that is hard to\ndistinguish from claims that feminists are wont to make. For example,\nI’m not a feminist but I believe that women should earn equal\npay for equal work; or I’m not a feminist but I’m\ndelighted that first-rate women basketball players are finally getting\nsome recognition in the WNBA. If we see the identification\n“feminist” as implicitly committing one to both a\nnormative stance about how things should be and an interpretation of\ncurrent conditions, it is easy to imagine someone being in the\nposition of wanting to cancel his or her endorsement of either the\nnormative or the descriptive claim. So, e.g., one might be willing to\nacknowledge that there are cases where women have been disadvantaged\nwithout wanting to buy any broad moral theory that takes a stance on\nsuch things (especially where it is unclear what that broad theory\nis). Or one might be willing to acknowledge in a very general way that\nequality for women is a good thing, without being committed to\ninterpreting particular everyday situations as unjust (especially if\nis unclear how far these interpretations would have to extend).\nFeminists, however, at least according to popular discourse, are ready\nto both adopt a broad account of what justice for women would require\nand interpret everyday situations as unjust by the standards of that\naccount. Those who explicitly cancel their commitment to feminism may\nthen be happy to endorse some part of the view but are unwilling to\nendorse what they find to be a problematic package. \nAs mentioned above, there is considerable debate within feminism\nconcerning the normative question: what would count as (full) justice\nfor women? What is the nature of the wrong that feminism seeks to\naddress? For example, is the wrong that women have been deprived equal\nrights? Is it that women have been denied equal respect for their\ndifferences? Is it that women’s experiences have been ignored\nand devalued? Is it all of the above and more? What framework should\nwe employ to identify and address the issues? (see, e.g., Jaggar 1983;\nYoung 1985; Tuana & Tong 1995). Feminist philosophers in\nparticular have asked: Do the standard philosophical accounts of\njustice and morality provide us adequate resources to theorize male\ndomination, or do we need distinctively feminist accounts? (e.g., Okin\n1979; Hoagland 1989; Okin 1989; Ruddick 1989; Benhabib 1992; Hampton\n1993; Held 1993; Tong 1993; Baier 1994; Moody-Adams 1997; M. Walker\n1998; Kittay 1999; Robinson 1999; Young 2011; O’Connor\n2008). \nNote, however, that by phrasing the task as one of identifying the\nwrongs women suffer (and have suffered), there is an implicit\nsuggestion that women as a group can be usefully compared against men\nas a group with respect to their standing or position in society; and\nthis seems to suggest that women as a group are treated in the same\nway, or that they all suffer the same injustices, and men as a group\nall reap the same advantages. But of course this is not the case, or\nat least not straightforwardly so. As bell hooks so vividly pointed\nout, in 1963 when Betty Friedan urged women to reconsider the role of\nhousewife and demanded greater opportunities for women to enter the\nworkforce (Friedan 1963), Friedan was not speaking for working class\nwomen or most women of color (hooks 1984: 1–4). Neither was she\nspeaking for lesbians. Women as a group experience many different\nforms of injustice, and the sexism they encounter interacts in complex\nways with other systems of oppression. In contemporary terms, this is\nknown as the problem of intersectionality (Crenshaw 1991, Botts 2017).\nThis critique has led some theorists to resist the label\n“feminism” and to adopt a different name for their view.\nEarlier, during the 1860s–80s, the term “womanism”\nhad sometimes been used for such intellectual and political\ncommitments; in 1990, Alice Walker proposed that\n“womanism” provides a contemporary alternative to\n“feminism” that better addresses the needs of Black women\nand women of color more generally. But given more recent work on\n trans issues\n such a gender-specific term would today raise many more problems than\nit would solve. \nTo consider some of the different strategies for responding to the\nphenomenon of intersectionality, let’s return to the schematic\nclaims that women are oppressed and this oppression is wrong or\nunjust. Very broadly, then, one might characterize the goal of\nfeminism to be ending the oppression of women. But if we also\nacknowledge that women are oppressed not just by sexism, but in many\nways, e.g., by classism, homophobia, racism, ageism, ableism, etc.,\nthen it might seem that the goal of feminism is to end all oppression\nthat affects women. And some feminists have adopted this\ninterpretation (e.g., Ware 1970, quoted in Crow 2000: 1). \nNote, however, that not all agree with such an expansive definition of\nfeminism. One might agree that feminists ought to work to end all\nforms of oppression—oppression is unjust and feminists, like\neveryone else, have a moral obligation to fight\ninjustice—without maintaining that it is the mission of feminism\nto end all oppression. One might even believe that in order to\naccomplish feminism’s goals it is necessary to combat racism and\neconomic exploitation, but also think that there is a narrower set of\nspecifically feminist objectives. In other words, opposing oppression\nin its many forms may be instrumental to, even a necessary means to,\nfeminism, but not intrinsic to it. For example, bell hooks argues: \nFeminism, as liberation struggle, must exist apart from and as a part\nof the larger struggle to eradicate domination in all its forms. We\nmust understand that patriarchal domination shares an ideological\nfoundation with racism and other forms of group oppression, and that\nthere is no hope that it can be eradicated while these systems remain\nintact. This knowledge should consistently inform the direction of\nfeminist theory and practice. (hooks 1989: 22) \nOn hooks’ account, the defining characteristic that\ndistinguishes feminism from other liberation struggles is its concern\nwith sexism: \nUnlike many feminist comrades, I believe women and men must share a\ncommon understanding—a basic knowledge of what feminism\nis—if it is ever to be a powerful mass-based political movement.\nIn Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center, I suggest that\ndefining feminism broadly as “a movement to end sexism and\nsexist oppression” would enable us to have a common political\ngoal…Sharing a common goal does not imply that women and men\nwill not have radically divergent perspectives on how that goal might\nbe reached. (hooks 1989: 23) \nhooks’ approach depends on the claim that sexism is a particular\nform of oppression that can be distinguished from other forms, e.g.,\nracism and homophobia, even though it is currently (and virtually\nalways) interlocked with other forms of oppression. Feminism’s\nobjective is to end sexism, though because of its relation to other\nforms of oppression, this will require efforts to end other forms of\noppression as well. For example, feminists who themselves remain\nracists will not be able to fully appreciate the broad impact of\nsexism on the lives of women of color—nor the interconnections\nbetween racism and sexism. Furthermore because sexist institutions are\nalso, e.g., racist, classist, and homophobic, dismantling sexist\ninstitutions will require that we dismantle the other forms of\ndomination intertwined with them (Heldke & O’Connor 2004).\nFollowing hooks’ lead, we might characterize feminism\nschematically (allowing the schema to be filled in differently by\ndifferent accounts) as the view that women are subject to sexist\noppression and that this is wrong. This move shifts the burden of our\ninquiry from a characterization of what feminism is to a\ncharacterization of what sexism, or sexist oppression, is. \nAs mentioned above, there are a variety of\ninterpretations—feminist and otherwise—of what exactly\noppression consists in, but the leading idea is that oppression\nconsists in “an enclosing structure of forces and barriers which\ntends to the immobilization and reduction of a group or category of\npeople” (Frye 1983: 10–11). Not just any “enclosing\nstructure” is oppressive, however, for plausibly any process of\nsocialization will create a structure that both limits and enables all\nindividuals who live within it. In the case of oppression, however,\nthe “enclosing structures” in question are part of a\nbroader system that asymmetrically and unjustly disadvantages one\ngroup and benefits another. So, for example, although sexism restricts\nthe opportunities available to—and so unquestionably\nharms—both men and women (and considering some pairwise\ncomparisons may even have a greater negative impact on a man than a\nwoman), overall, women as a group unjustly suffer the greater harm. It\nis a crucial feature of contemporary accounts, however, that one\ncannot assume that members of the privileged group have intentionally\ndesigned or maintained the system for their benefit. The oppressive\nstructure may be the result of an historical process whose originators\nare long gone, or it may be the unintended result of complex\ncooperative strategies gone wrong. \nLeaving aside (at least for the moment) further details in the account\nof oppression, the question remains: What makes a particular form of\noppression sexist? If we just say that a form of oppression counts as\nsexist oppression if it harms women, or even primarily harms women,\nthis is not enough to distinguish it from other forms of oppression.\nVirtually all forms of oppression harm women, and arguably some\nbesides sexism harm women primarily (though not exclusively), e.g.,\nbody size oppression, age oppression. Besides, as we’ve noted\nbefore, sexism is not only harmful to women, but is harmful to all of\nus. \nWhat makes a particular form of oppression sexist seems to be not just\nthat it harms women, but that someone is subject to this form of\noppression specifically because she is (or at least appears to be) a\nwoman. Racial oppression harms women, but racial oppression (by\nitself) doesn’t harm them because they are women, it harms them\nbecause they are (or appear to be) members of a particular race. The\nsuggestion that sexist oppression consists in oppression to which one\nis subject by virtue of being or appearing to be a woman provides us\nat least the beginnings of an analytical tool for distinguishing\nsubordinating structures that happen to affect some or even all women\nfrom those that are more specifically sexist (Haslanger 2004). But\nproblems and unclarities remain. \nFirst, we need to explicate further what it means to be oppressed\n“because you are a woman”. For example, is the idea that\nthere is a particular form of oppression that is specific to women? Is\nto be oppressed “as a woman” to be oppressed in a\nparticular way? Or can we be pluralists about what sexist oppression\nconsists in without fragmenting the notion beyond usefulness? \nTwo strategies for explicating sexist oppression have proven to be\nproblematic. The first is to maintain that there is a form of\noppression common to all women. For example, one might interpret\nCatharine MacKinnon’s work as claiming that to be oppressed as a\nwoman is to be viewed and treated as sexually subordinate, where this\nclaim is grounded in the (alleged) universal fact of the eroticization\nof male dominance and female submission (MacKinnon 1987, 1989).\nAlthough MacKinnon allows that sexual subordination can happen in a\nmyriad of ways, her account is monistic in its attempt to unite the\ndifferent forms of sexist oppression around a single core account that\nmakes sexual objectification the focus. Although MacKinnon’s\nwork provides a powerful resource for analyzing women’s\nsubordination, many have argued that it is too narrow, e.g., in some\ncontexts (especially in developing countries) sexist oppression seems\nto concern more the local division of labor and economic exploitation.\nAlthough certainly sexual subordination is a factor in sexist\noppression, it requires us to fabricate implausible explanations of\nsocial life to suppose that all divisions of labor that exploit women\n(as women) stem from the “eroticization of dominance and\nsubmission”. Moreover, it isn’t obvious that in order to\nmake sense of sexist oppression we need to seek a single form of\noppression common to all women. \nA second problematic strategy has been to consider as paradigms those\nwho are oppressed only as women, with the thought that complex cases\nbringing in additional forms of oppression will obscure what is\ndistinctive of sexist oppression. This strategy would have us focus in\nthe United States on white, wealthy, young, beautiful, able-bodied,\nheterosexual women to determine what oppression, if any, they suffer,\nwith the hope of finding sexism in its “purest” form,\nunmixed with racism or homophobia, etc. (see Spelman 1988:\n52–54). This approach is not only flawed in its exclusion of all\nbut the most elite women in its paradigm, but it assumes that\nprivilege in other areas does not affect the phenomenon under\nconsideration. As Elizabeth Spelman makes the point: \n…no woman is subject to any form of oppression simply because\nshe is a woman; which forms of oppression she is subject to depend on\nwhat “kind” of woman she is. In a world in which a woman\nmight be subject to racism, classism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, if\nshe is not so subject it is because of her race, class, religion,\nsexual orientation. So it can never be the case that the treatment of\na woman has only to do with her gender and nothing to do with her\nclass or race. (Spelman 1988: 52–3) \nOther accounts of oppression are designed to allow that oppression\ntakes many forms, and refuse to identify one form as more basic or\nfundamental than the rest. For example, Iris Young describes five\n“faces” of oppression: exploitation, marginalization,\npowerlessness, cultural imperialism, and systematic violence (Young\n1980 [1990a: ch. 2]). Plausibly others should be added to the list.\nSexist or racist oppression, for example, will manifest itself in\ndifferent ways in different contexts, e.g., in some contexts through\nsystematic violence, in other contexts through economic exploitation.\nAcknowledging this does not go quite far enough, however, for monistic\ntheorists such as MacKinnon could grant this much. Pluralist accounts\nof sexist oppression must also allow that there isn’t an\nover-arching explanation of sexist oppression that applies to all its\nforms: in some cases it may be that women’s oppression as women\nis due to the eroticization of male dominance, but in other cases it\nmay be better explained by women’s reproductive value in\nestablishing kinship structures (Rubin 1975), or by the shifting\ndemands of globalization within an ethnically stratified workplace. In\nother words, pluralists resist the temptation to “grand social\ntheory”, “overarching metanarratives”,\n“monocausal explanations”, to allow that the explanation\nof sexism in a particular historical context will rely on economic,\npolitical, legal, and cultural factors that are specific to that\ncontext which would prevent the account from being generalized to all\ninstances of sexism (Fraser & Nicholson 1990). It is still\ncompatible with pluralist methods to seek out patterns in\nwomen’s social positions and structural explanations within and\nacross social contexts, but in doing so we must be highly sensitive to\nhistorical and cultural variation. \nHowever, if we pursue a pluralist strategy in understanding sexist\noppression, what unifies all the instances as instances of sexism?\nAfter all, we cannot assume that the oppression in question takes the\nsame form in different contexts, and we cannot assume that there is an\nunderlying explanation of the different ways it manifests itself. So\ncan we even speak of there being a unified set of\ncases—something we can call “sexist\noppression”—at all? \nSome feminists would urge us to recognize that there isn’t a\nsystematic way to unify the different instances of sexism, and\ncorrespondingly, there is no systematic unity in what counts as\nfeminism: instead we should see the basis for feminist unity in\ncoalition building (Reagon 1983). Different groups work to combat\ndifferent forms of oppression; some groups take oppression against\nwomen (as women) as a primary concern. If there is a basis for\ncooperation between some subset of these groups in a given context,\nthen finding that basis is an accomplishment, but should not be taken\nfor granted. \nAn alternative, however, would be to grant that in practice unity\namong feminists cannot be taken for granted, but to begin with a\ntheoretical common ground among feminist views that does not assume\nthat sexism appears in the same form or for the same reasons in all\ncontexts. We saw above that one promising strategy for distinguishing\nsexism from racism, classism, and other forms of injustice is to focus\non the idea that if an individual is suffering sexist oppression, then\nan important part of the explanation why she is subject to the\ninjustice is that she is or appears to be a woman. This includes cases\nin which women as a group are explicitly targeted by a policy or a\npractice, but also includes cases where the policy or practice affects\nwomen due to a history of sexism, even if they are not explicitly\ntargeted. For example, in a scenario in which women are\nchildren’s primary caregivers and cannot travel for work as\neasily as men, then employment practices that reward those who can\ntravel can be deemed sexist because the differential is due to sexist\npractices. The commonality among the cases is to be found in the role\nof gender in the explanation of the injustice rather than the specific\nform the injustice takes. Building on this we could unify a broad\nrange of feminist views by seeing them as committed to the (very\nabstract) claims that: \nWe have so far been using the term “oppression” loosely to\ncover whatever form of wrong or injustice is at issue. Continuing with\nthis intentional openness in the exact nature of the wrong, the\nquestion still remains what it means to say that women are subjected\nto injustice because they are women. To address this question, it may\nhelp to consider a familiar ambiguity in the notion\n“because”: are we concerned here with causal explanations\nor justifications? On one hand, the claim that someone is oppressed\nbecause she is a woman suggests that the best (causal) explanation of\nthe subordination in question will make reference to her sex: e.g.,\nPaula is subject to sexist oppression on the job because the best\nexplanation of why she makes $10.00 less an hour for doing comparable\nwork as Paul makes reference to her sex (possibly coupled with her\nrace or other social classifications). On the other hand, the claim\nthat someone is oppressed because she is a woman suggests that the\nrationale or basis for the oppressive structures requires that one be\nsensitive to someone’s sex in determining how they should be\nviewed and treated, i.e., that the justification for someone’s\nbeing subject to the structures in question depends on a\nrepresentation of them as sexed male or female. For example, Paula is\nsubject to sexist oppression on the job because the pay scale for her\njob classification is justified within a framework that distinguishes\nand devalues women’s work compared with men’s. \nNote, however, that in both sorts of cases the fact that one is or\nappears to be a woman need not be the only factor relevant in\nexplaining the injustice. It might be, for example, that one stands\nout in a group because of one’s race, or one’s class, or\none’s sexuality, and because one stands out one becomes a target\nfor injustice. But if the injustice takes a form that, e.g., is\nregarded as especially apt for a woman, then the injustice should be\nunderstood intersectionally, i.e., as a response to an intersectional\ncategory. For example, the practice of raping Bosnian women was an\nintersectional injustice: it targeted them both because they were\nBosnian and because they were women. \nOf course, these two understandings of being oppressed because you are\na woman are not incompatible; in fact they typically support one\nanother. Because human actions are often best explained by the\nframework employed for justifying them, one’s sex may play a\nlarge role in determining how one is treated because the background\nunderstandings for what’s appropriate treatment draw invidious\ndistinctions between the sexes. In other words, the causal mechanism\nfor sexism often passes through problematic representations of women\nand gender roles. \nIn each of the cases of being oppressed as a woman mentioned above,\nPaula suffers injustice, but a crucial factor in explaining the\ninjustice is that Paula is a member of a particular group, viz.,\nwomen. This, we think, is crucial in understanding why sexism (and\nracism, and other -isms) are most often understood as kinds of\noppression. Oppression is injustice that, first and foremost, concerns\ngroups; individuals are oppressed just in case they are subjected to\ninjustice because of their group membership. On this view, to claim\nthat women as women suffer injustice is to claim that women are\noppressed. \nWhere does this leave us? “Feminism” is an umbrella term\nfor a range of views about injustices against women. There are\ndisagreements among feminists about the nature of justice in general\nand the nature of sexism, in particular, the specific kinds of\ninjustice or wrong women suffer; and the group who should be the\nprimary focus of feminist efforts. Nonetheless, feminists are\ncommitted to bringing about social change to end injustice against\nwomen, in particular, injustice against women as women. \nFeminism brings many things to philosophy including not only a variety\nof particular moral and political claims, but ways of asking and\nanswering questions, constructive and critical dialogue with\nmainstream philosophical views and methods, and new topics of inquiry.\nFeminist philosophers work within all the major traditions of\nphilosophical scholarship including analytic philosophy, American\npragmatist philosophy, and Continental philosophy. Entries in this\nEncyclopedia appearing under the heading “feminism,\napproaches” discuss the impact of these traditions on feminist\nscholarship and examine the possibility and desirability of work that\nmakes links between two traditions. Feminist contributions to and\ninterventions in mainstream philosophical debates are covered in\nentries in this encyclopedia under “feminism,\ninterventions”. Entries covered under the rubric\n“feminism, topics” concern philosophical issues that arise\nas feminists articulate accounts of sexism, critique sexist social and\ncultural practices, and develop alternative visions of a just world.\nIn short, they are philosophical topics that arise within\nfeminism. \nApproaches to feminist philosophy are almost as varied as approaches\nto philosophy itself, reflecting a variety of beliefs about what kinds\nof philosophy are both fruitful and meaningful. To spell out such\ndifferences, this section of the SEP provides overviews of the\nfollowing dominant (at least in more developed societies) approaches\nto feminist philosophy. The following are links to essays in this\nsection: \nAll these approaches share a set of feminist commitments and an\noverarching criticism of institutions, presuppositions, and practices\nthat have historically favored men over women. They also share a\ngeneral critique of claims to universality and objectivity that ignore\nmale-dominated theories’ own particularity and specificity.\nFeminist philosophies of most any philosophical orientation will be\nmuch more perspectival, historical, contextual, and focused on lived\nexperience than their non-feminist counterparts. Unlike mainstream\nphilosophers who can seriously consider the philosophical conundrums\nof brains in a vat, feminist philosophers always start by seeing\npeople as embodied. Feminists have also argued for the reconfiguration\nof accepted structures and problematics of philosophy. For example,\nfeminists have not only rejected the privileging of epistemological\nconcerns over moral and political concerns common to much of\nphilosophy, they have argued that these two areas of concern are\ninextricably intertwined. Part 2 of the entry on\n analytic feminism\n lays out other areas of commonality across these various approaches.\nFor one, feminist philosophers generally agree that philosophy is a\npowerful tool for understanding  \nourselves and our relations to each other, to our communities, and to\nthe state; to appreciate the extent to which we are counted as knowers\nand moral agents; [and] to uncover the assumptions and methods of\nvarious bodies of knowledge.  \nFor another, feminist philosophers all generally are keenly attuned to\nmale biases at work in the history of philosophy, such as those\nregarding “the nature of woman” and supposed value\nneutrality, which on inspection is hardly neutral at all. Claims to\nuniversality, feminist philosophers have found, are usually made from\na very specific and particular point of view, contrary to their\nmanifest claims. Another orientation that feminist philosophers\ngenerally share is a commitment to normativity and social change; they\nare never content to analyze things just as they are but are instead\nlooking for ways to overcome sexist practices and institutions. \nSuch questioning of the problematic of mainstream approaches to\nphilosophy has often led to feminists using methods and approaches\nfrom more than one philosophical tradition. As Ann Garry notes in part\nthree of the entry on\n Analytic Feminism\n (2017), it is not uncommon to find analytic feminists drawing on\nnon-analytic figures such as Beauvoir, Foucault, or Butler; and\nbecause of their motivation to communicate with other feminists, they\nare more motivated than other philosophers “to search for\nmethodological cross-fertilization”. \nEven with their common and overlapping orientations, the differences\nbetween the various philosophical approaches to feminism are\nsignificant, especially in terms of styles of writing, influences, and\noverall expectations about what philosophy can and should achieve.\nAnalytic feminist philosophy tends to value analysis and\nargumentation, Continental feminist theory values interpretation and\ndeconstruction, and pragmatist feminism values lived experience and\nexploration. Coming out of a post-Hegelian tradition, both Continental\nand pragmatist philosophers usually suspect that “truth”,\nwhatever that is, emerges and develops historically. They tend to\nshare with Nietzsche the view that truth claims often mask power\nplays. Yet where Continental and pragmatist are generally wary about\nnotions of truth, analytic feminists tend to argue that the way to\n \ncounter sexism and androcentrism is through forming a clear conception\nof and pursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality,\njustice, and the good. (Cudd 1996: 20). \nThese differences and intersections play out in the ways that various\nfeminists engage topics of common concern. One key area of\nintersection noted by Georgia Warnke is the appropriation of\npsychoanalytic theory, with Anglo-American feminists generally\nadopting object-relations theories and Continental feminists drawing\nmore on Lacan and contemporary French psychoanalytic theory, though\nthis is already beginning to change (entry on\n intersections between analytic and continental feminism).\n The importance of psychoanalytic approaches is also underscored in\nShannon Sullivan’s essay\n Intersections Between Pragmatist and Continental Feminism.\n Given the importance of\n psychoanalytic feminism\n for all three traditions, a separate essay on this approach to\nfeminist theory is included in this section. \nNo topic is more central to feminist philosophy than sex and gender,\nbut even here many variations on the theme flourish. Where analytic\nfeminism, with its critique of essentialism, holds the sex/gender\ndistinction practically as an article of faith (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender\n and Chanter 2009), Continental feminists tend to suspect either (1)\nthat even the supposedly purely biological category of sex is itself\nsocially constituted (Butler 1990 and 1993 or (2) that sexual difference itself needs to be valued and theorized (see especially Cixous 1976 and Irigaray 1974. \nDespite the variety of different approaches, styles, societies, and\norientations, feminist philosophers’ commonalities are greater\nthan their differences. Many will borrow freely from each other and\nfind that other orientations contribute to their own work. Even the\ndifferences over sex and gender add to a larger conversation about the\nimpact of culture and society on bodies, experience, and pathways for\nchange. \nPhilosophers who are feminists have, in their work in traditional\nfields of study, begun to change those very fields. The\nEncyclopedia includes a range of entries on how feminist\nphilosophies have intervened in conventional areas of philosophical\nresearch, areas in which philosophers often tend to argue that they\nare operating from a neutral, universal point of view (notable\nexceptions are pragmatism, poststructuralism, and some phenomenology).\nHistorically, philosophy has claimed that the norm is universal and\nthe feminine is abnormal, that universality is not gendered, but that\nall things feminine are not universal. Not surprisingly, feminists\nhave pointed out how in fact these supposed neutral enterprises are in\nfact quite gendered, namely, male gendered. For example, feminists\nworking on environmental philosophy have uncovered how practices\ndisproportionately affect women, children, and people of color.\nLiberal feminism has shown how supposed universal truths of liberalism\nare in fact quite biased and particular. Feminist epistemologists have\ncalled out “epistemologies of ignorance” that traffic in\nnot knowing. Across the board, in fact, feminist philosophers are\nuncovering male biases and also pointing to the value of\nparticularity, in general rejecting universality as a norm or\ngoal. \nEntries under the heading of feminist interventions include the\nfollowing: \nFeminist critical attention to philosophical practices has revealed\nthe inadequacy of dominant philosophical tropes. For example,\nfeminists working from the perspective of women’s lives have\nbeen influential in bringing philosophical attention to the phenomenon\nof care and care-giving (Ruddick 1989; Held 1995, 2007; Hamington\n2006), dependency (Kittay 1999), disability (Wilkerson 2002; Carlson\n2009) women’s labor (Waring 1999; Delphy 1984; Harley 2007), and\nscientific bias and objectivity (Longino 1990), and have revealed\nweaknesses in existing ethical, political, and epistemological\ntheories. More generally, feminists have called for inquiry into what\nare typically considered “private” practices and personal\nconcerns, such as the family, sexuality, and the body, in order to\nbalance what has seemed to be a masculine pre-occupation with\n“public” and impersonal matters. Philosophy presupposes\ninterpretive tools for understanding our everyday lives; feminist work\nin articulating additional dimensions of experience and aspects of our\npractices is invaluable in demonstrating the bias in existing tools,\nand in the search for better ones. \nFeminist explanations of sexism and accounts of sexist practices also\nraise issues that are within the domain of traditional philosophical\ninquiry. For example, in thinking about care, feminists have asked\nquestions about the nature of the self; in thinking about gender,\nfeminists have asked what the relationship is between the natural and\nthe social; in thinking about sexism in science, feminists have asked\nwhat should count as knowledge. In some such cases mainstream\nphilosophical accounts provide useful tools; in other cases,\nalternative proposals have seemed more promising. \nIn the sub-entries included under “feminism (topics)” in\nthe\n Table of Contents\n to this Encyclopedia, authors survey some of the recent\nfeminist work on a topic, highlighting the issues that are of\nparticular relevance to philosophy.
