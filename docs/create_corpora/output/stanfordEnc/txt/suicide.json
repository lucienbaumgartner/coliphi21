Suicide is now an object of multidisciplinary\nscientific study, with sociology, anthropology, psychology, and\npsychiatry each providing important insights into suicide.\nParticularly promising are the significant advances being made in our\nscientific understanding of the neurological and genetic bases of\nsuicidal behavior (Stoff and Mann 1997, Jamison 2000, Joiner 2010,\n228–236) and the mental conditions associated with it.\nNonetheless, many of the most controversial questions surrounding\nsuicide are philosophical. For philosophers, suicide raises a host of\nconceptual, moral, and psychological questions. Among these questions\nare: What makes a person’s behavior suicidal? What motivates\nsuch behavior? Is suicide morally permissible, or even morally\nrequired in some extraordinary circumstances? Is suicidal behavior\nrational? This article will examine the main currents of historical\nand contemporary Western philosophical thought surrounding these\nquestions.\n\nSurprisingly, philosophical difficulties emerge when we attempt to\ncharacterize suicide precisely, and attempts to do so introduce\nintricate issues about how to describe and explain human action. In\nparticular, identifying a set of necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor suicide that fits well with our typical usage of the term is\nespecially challenging. A further challenge is that due to\nsuicide’s strong negative emotional or moral connotations,\nefforts to distinguish suicidal behavior from other behavior often\nclandestinely import moral judgments about the aims or moral worth of\nsuch behavior. That is, views about the nature of suicide often\nincorporate, sometimes unknowingly, views about the prudential or\nmoral justifiability of suicide and are therefore not value-neutral\ndescriptions of suicide (Paterson 2003, 353, Cholbi 2011,\n17–20). For example, Hitler, most people contend, was clearly a\nsuicide, but Socrates and Jesus were not (though on Socrates, see Frey\n1978). This illustrates that suicide still carries a strongly negative\nsubtext, and on the whole, we exhibit a greater willingness to\ncategorize self-killings intended to avoid one’s just deserts as\nsuicides than self-killings intended to benefit others (Beauchamp\n& Childress 1983, 93–94).  \nSuch conceptual slipperiness complicates moral arguments about the\njustifiability of suicide by permitting us to ‘define\naway’ self-killings we believe are justified as something other\nthan suicide, whereas it would be desirable to identify first a\ndefensible non-normative conception of suicide and then proceed to\ndiscuss the moral merits of various acts of suicide (Stern-Gillett\n1987, Kupfer 1990). In other words, ‘suicide’ should not\nbe equatable with wrongful self-killing in the way that\n‘murder’ is equated with wrongful killing of\nanother, lest we render ourselves unable to refer even to the\npossibility of a morally justified self-killing.  \nIf a purely descriptive account of suicide is possible, where should\nit begin? While it is tempting to say that suicide is any self-caused\ndeath, this account is vulnerable to obvious counterexamples. An\nindividual who knows the health risks of smoking or of skydiving, but\nwillfully engages in these behaviors and dies as a result, could be\nsaid to be causally responsible for her own death but not to have died\nby suicide. Similarly, an individual who takes a swig of hydrochloric\nacid, believing it to be lemonade, and subsequently dies causes her\nown death but does not engage in suicidal behavior. Moreover, not only\nare there self-caused deaths that are not suicides, but there are\nbehaviors that result in death and are arguably suicidal in which the\nagent is not the cause of her own death or is so only at one remove.\nThis can occur when an individual arranges the circumstances for her\ndeath. A terminally ill patient who requests that another person\ninject her with a lethal dose of tranquilizers has, intuitively, died\nby suicide. Though she is not immediately causally responsible for her\ndeath, she appears morally responsible for her death, since she\ninitiates a sequence of events which she intended to culminate in her\ndeath, a sequence which cannot be explained without reference to her\nbeliefs and desires. (Such a case exemplifies\n voluntary euthanasia.)\n Likewise, those who die via ‘suicide by cop,’ where an\narmed crime is committed in order to provoke police into killing its\nperpetrator, are responsible for their own deaths despite not being\nthe causes of their deaths. In these kinds of cases, such agents would\nnot die, or would not be at an elevated risk for death, were it not\nfor their initiating such causal sequences. (See Brandt 1975, Tolhurst\n1983, Frey 1981, but for a possible objection see Kupfer 1990.) \nFurthermore, many philosophers (Fairbairn 1995, chapter 5) doubt\nwhether an act’s actually resulting in death is essential to\nsuicide at all. Just as there can be attempted murders or attempted\nacts of deception, so too can there be ‘attempted’\nsuicides, instances where because of agents’ false beliefs\n(about the lethality of their behavior, for example), unforeseen\nfactual circumstances, others’ interventions, etc., an act which\nmight have resulted in an agent’s death does not. \nHence, suicidal behavior need not result in death, nor must the\ncondition that hastens death be self-caused. Definitions according to\nwhich suicide occurs when a person acts knowing that her act will\ncause her own death (Durkheim (1897)) thus fail to capture how death\nis in some respect an aim of suicidal behavior. Second, what\nappears essential for a behavior to count as suicide is that the\nperson in question chooses to die. Suicide is an attempt to\ninflict death upon oneself and is “intentional rather\nthan consequential in nature” (Fairbairn 1995, 58). These\nconditions imply that suicide must rest upon an individual’s\nintentions, where an intention implicates an\nindividual’s beliefs and desires about her action. (See Brandt\n1975, Graber 1981 Tolhurst 1983, Frey 1978, O’Keeffe 1981,\nMcMahan 2002, 455, Paterson 2003, Cholbi 2011, 20–31, Hill 2011)\nAn intention-based account of suicide would say, roughly, that \nThis account renders the notion of suicide as self-inflicted attempted\ndeath more precise, but it is not unproblematic. \nCondition (a) is a doxastic condition. It is meant to show\nthat deaths (or increased risks for death) resulting from an\nindividual’s act that causes death (or the risk thereof) are not\nsuicides if the individual acts in ignorance of the relevant risks of\nher behavior (for example, when an individual accidentally takes a\nlethal dose of a prescription drug). At the same time, (a) accounts\nfor cases such as the aforementioned terminally ill patient whose\ndeath is caused only indirectly by her request to die. Condition (a)\ndoes not require that S know that B will\nput her at a significantly greater risk for death, nor even that\nS’s beliefs about B’s lethality be true\nor even justified. Suicidal individuals sometimes have false beliefs\nabout the lethality of their chosen suicide methods, greatly\noverestimating the lethality of over the counter painkillers while\nunderestimating the lethality of handguns, for instance. An individual\ncould believe falsely, or on the basis of inadequate evidence, that\nplacing one’s head in an electric oven significantly increases\none’s chances of dying, but that behavior is nonetheless\nsuicidal. The demand that S believe that B makes\ndeath highly likely is admittedly inexact, but it permits us to\nnavigate between two extreme and mistaken views. On the one hand, it\nimplies that behavior which is in fact only marginally more likely to\ncause a person’s death is not suicidal (you are more likely to\ndie driving your car than in your living room, but driving your car\nhardly qualifies as ‘suicidal’). On the other hand, to\ndemand that S believe that B certainly or almost certainly\nwill cause S’s death is too strict, since it will\nrarely be the case (given the possibility of intervening conditions,\netc.) that B will necessarily cause S’s death,\nand in fact many suicidal individuals are ambivalent about their\nactions (Cholbi 2011, 31–35), an ambivalence which is in turn\nreflected in their selecting suicide methods that are far from certain\nto cause death. It also allows us to distinguish genuinely suicidal\nbehavior from suicidal gestures, in which individuals engage\nin behavior they believe is not likely to cause their death\nbut is nonetheless associated with suicide attempts, while in fact\nhaving some other intention (e.g., gaining others’ sympathy) in\nmind. \nCondition (b), however, is far more knotty. For what is it to intend\nthat death result from one’s behavior? There are examples in\nwhich condition (a) is clearly met, but whether (b) is met is more\nproblematic. For instance, does a soldier who leaps upon a live\ngrenade tossed into a foxhole in order to save his comrades engage in\nsuicidal behavior? Many, especially partisans of\n the doctrine of double effect\n would answer ‘no’: Despite the fact that the soldier knew\nhis behavior would likely cause him to die, his intention was to\nabsorb the blast so as to save the other soldiers, whereas his death\nwas only a foreseen outcome of his action. Needless to say, whether a\nclear divide exists between foreseen and intended outcomes is\ncontroversial, and critics raise the worry that almost any outcome can\nbe described as foreseen (Glover 1990, ch. 6). (It is of course\npossible that whether death is foreseen or intended has no bearing on\nwhether an act counts as suicide but still bears on whether that\nsuicide is justified.) Some would argue that given the near certainty\nof his dying by jumping on the grenade, his death was intended, for\neven though death is not the justifying aim of his action and he may\nprefer not to die, his dying nevertheless has his endorsement in the\ncircumstances in which he acts (Tolhurst 1983, Cholbi 2011,\n26–31). A further complication is that current psychological\nevidence suggests that suicide is often an ambivalent act in which\nindividuals who wish to die must nevertheless overcome the ordinary\nhuman fear of death (Cholbi 2011, 31–34, Joiner 2010,\n62–70). Given this ambivalence, it may be difficult to determine\nprecisely whether an act that poses an apparently lethal threat to the\nagent who performs it was in fact an act in which death was intended.\nWhen a person dies in such circumstances, it may prove difficult\nwhether to classify the death as resulting from suicide (i.e.,\nintentional self-killing) or as accidental. Such cases might indicate\nthe need for a third category besides intentional suicide and\naccidental death (Cholbi 2007).  \nThe essential logical difficulty here resides in the notion of\nintending to die, for acting so as to produce one’s death nearly\nalways has some other aim or justification. That is, death is\ngenerally not chosen for its own sake, or is not the end of suicidal\nbehavior. Suicidal behavior can have any number of objectives: the\nrelief of physical pain, the relief of psychological anguish,\nmartyrdom in the service of a moral cause, the fulfillment of\nperceived societal duties (e.g., suttee and\nseppuku), the avoidance of judicial execution, revenge on\nothers, protection of others’ interests or well-being. (See\nFairbairn 1995, ch. 9, for a taxonomy of the varieties of suicide.)\nTherefore, it is not the case that suicidal individuals intend death\nper se, but rather that death is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a\nmeans for the fulfillment of another of the agent’s aims (Graber\n1981, 56). In short, there do not appear to be any compelling examples\nof “noninstrumental” self-killings in which “the\noverriding intention is simply to end one’s life and there is no\nfurther independent objective involved in the action”\n(O’Keeffe 1981, 357). Nor does requiring that the individual\nwish to be dead (Fairbairn 1995, ch. 6) address this issue,\nsince again, what one wishes is presumably not death itself but some\noutcome of death. Both the grenade-jumping soldier and the depressed\nindividual may wish not to die insofar as they might prefer that their\ndesires could be satisfied without dying or without putting themselves\nat the risk thereof. However, this is consistent with their willingly\nchoosing to die in order to satisfy their aims. \nSome (e.g., Beauchamp 1992, Cholbi 2011, 35–37) might wish to\nadd a further condition to (a) and (b) above: \nYet again, both the concept of coercion and its applicability to\ninstances of risky or self-harming behavior is unclear. Typically,\ncoercion denotes interference by others. So, according to condition\n(c), a spy threatened with torture lest he relinquish crucial military\nsecrets who then poisons himself did not die by suicide, some would\ncontend, since the spy’s captors compelled him to take his life.\nHowever, one can imagine a similar situation in which the agent of\n“coercion” is not another person. An extremely ill patient\nmay opt to take his own life rather than face a future fraught with\nphysical pain. But why should we not say that this patient was\n‘coerced’ by his situation and therefore did not die by\nsuicide? Because of their desires, loyalties, and values, both the spy\nand the ill patient saw themselves as having no other alternative,\ngiven their ends, but to cause their own deaths. In both instances,\nwhat the individual has reason to do was modified by circumstances\noutside their control so as to make death a rational option where it\npreviously was not. Thus, there does not appear to be grounds for\nrestricting coercion only to interference by other people, since\nfactual circumstances can be similarly coercive. Either any\nfactor, natural, human, or otherwise, that influences an\nindividual’s reasoning so as to make death the most rational\noption counts as coercion, at which point condition (c) hardly\nfunctions as a restriction at all, or cases such as the spy facing\ntorture are suicides too and (c) is unnecessary. (See Tolhurst 1983,\n113–115.) Nor is it obvious that coercion necessarily changes\nthe nature of a coerced act. A person coerced into singing is\nnevertheless singing. Hence, an act that is otherwise suicidal remains\nsuicidal even if it is coerced (Paterson 2003).  \nThis brief attempt at conceptual analysis of suicide illustrates the\nfrustrations of such a project, as the unclear notion of suicide is\napparently replaced by equally unclear notions such as intention and\ncoercion. We may be attracted to increasingly convoluted analyses of\nsuicide (Donnelly 1998, 20) or accept that suicide is an ‘open\ntextured’ concept instances of which are bound together only by\nweak Wittgensteinian family resemblance and hence resistant to\nanalysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions (Windt\n1981). \nAn alternative to providing necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsuicidal behavior is to view it along a continuum. In the\npsychological sciences, many suicidologists view suicide not as an\neither/or notion but as a gradient notion, admitting of degrees based\non individuals’ beliefs, strength of intentions, and attitudes.\nThe Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation is perhaps the best example of\nthis approach. (See Beck 1979.) \nWestern philosophical discourse about suicide stretches back at least\nto the time of Plato. Still, prior to the Stoics at least, suicide\ntended to get sporadic rather than systematic attention from\nphilosophers in the ancient Mediterranean world. As John Cooper has\nnoted (Cooper 1989, 10), neither ancient Greek nor Latin had a single\nword that aptly translates our ‘suicide,’ even though most\nof the ancient city-states criminalized self-killing. \nPlato explicitly discussed suicide in two works. First, in\nPhaedo, Socrates expresses guarded enthusiasm for the thesis,\nassociated with the Pythagoreans, that suicide is always wrong because\nit represents our releasing ourselves (i.e., our souls) from a\n“guard-post” (i.e., our bodies) the gods have placed us in\nas a form of punishment (Phaedo 61b-62c). Later, in the\nLaws, Plato claimed that suicide is disgraceful and its\nperpetrators should be buried in unmarked graves. However, Plato\nrecognized four exceptions to this principle: (1) when one’s\nmind is morally corrupted and one’s character can therefore not\nbe salvaged (Laws IX 854a3–5), (2) when the\nself-killing is done by judicial order, as in the case of Socrates,\n(3) when the self-killing is compelled by extreme and unavoidable\npersonal misfortune, and (4) when the self-killing results from shame\nat having participated in grossly unjust actions (Laws IX\n873c-d). Suicide under these circumstances can be excused, but,\naccording to Plato, it is otherwise an act of cowardice or laziness\nundertaken by individuals too delicate to manage life’s\nvicissitudes. Aristotle’s only discussion of suicide\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1138a5–14) occurs in the midst of a\ndiscussion of the possibility of treating oneself unjustly. Aristotle\nconcludes that self-killing does not treat oneself unjustly so long as\nit is done voluntarily because the harm done to oneself is consensual.\nHe concludes that suicide is somehow a wrong to the state or the\ncommunity, though he does not outline the nature of this wrong or the\nspecific vices that suicidal individuals exhibit. \nTo contemporary readers, the most striking feature of Plato’s\nand Aristotle’s texts on suicide is their relative absence of\nconcern for individual well-being or rights. Both limit the\njustifications for suicide largely to considerations about an\nindividual’s social roles and obligations. In contrast, the\nStoics held that whenever the means to living a naturally flourishing\nlife are not available to us, suicide may be justified, regardless of\nthe character or virtue of the individual in question. Our natures\nrequire certain “natural advantages” (e.g., physical\nhealth) in order for us to be happy, and a wise person who recognizes\nthat such advantages may be lacking in her life sees that ending her\nlife neither enhances nor diminishes her moral virtue. \nHence, not only may concerns related to one’s obligations to\nothers justify suicide, but one’s own private good is relevant\ntoo. The Roman Stoic Seneca, who was himself compelled to engage in\nsuicide, was even bolder, claiming that since “mere living is\nnot a good, but living well”, a wise person “lives as long\nas he ought, not as long as he can.” For Seneca, it is the\nquality, not the quantity, of one’s life that matters. \nThe advent of institutional Christianity was perhaps the most\nimportant event in the philosophical history of suicide, for Christian\ndoctrine has by and large held that suicide is morally wrong, despite\nthe absence of clear Scriptural guidance regarding suicide. Although\nthe early church fathers opposed suicide, St. Augustine is generally\ncredited with offering the first justification of the Christian\nprohibition on suicide (Amundsen 1989). He saw the prohibition as a\nnatural extension of the fifth commandment: \nSuicide, Augustine determined, was an unrepentable sin. St. Thomas\nAquinas later defended this prohibition on three grounds. (1) Suicide\nis contrary to natural self-love, whose aim is to preserve us. (2)\nSuicide injures the community of which an individual is a part. (3)\nSuicide violates our duty to God because God has given us life as a\ngift and in taking our lives we violate His right to determine the\nduration of our earthly existence (Aquinas 1271, part II, Q64, A5).\nThis conclusion was codified in the medieval doctrine that suicide\nnullified human beings’ relationship to God, for our control\nover our body was limited to usus (possession, employment)\nwhere God retained dominium (dominion, authority). Law and\npopular practice in the Middle Ages sanctioned the desecration of the\nsuicidal corpse, along with confiscation of the individual’s\nproperty and denial of Christian burial. \nThe rediscovery of numerous texts of classical antiquity was one of\nthe spurs of the Renaissance, but for the most part, Renaissance\nintellectuals generally affirmed the Church’s opposition to\nsuicide and were not sympathetic to the more permissive attitudes\ntoward suicide found among the ancient pagans. Two intriguing\nsixteenth century exceptions were Thomas More and Michel de Montaigne.\nIn his Utopia, More appears to recommend voluntary suicide\nfor those suffering from painful and incurable diseases, though the\nsatirical and fantastical tone of that work makes it doubtful that\nMore supported this proposal in reality. In his Essais,\nMontaigne relates several anecdotes of individuals taking their own\nlives and intersperses these anecdotes with quotations from Roman\nwriters praising suicide. While his general skepticism prevented\nMontaigne from staking out a firm moral position on suicide, he gives\nonly a nod to the orthodox Christian position and conceptualizes the\nissue not in traditional theological terms but as a matter of personal\njudgment or conscience (Minois 1999, 89–92).  \nThe Protestant Reformers, including Calvin, condemned suicide as\nroundly as did the established Church, but held out the possibility of\nGod treating suicide mercifully and permitting repentance. Interest in\nmoral questions concerning suicide was particularly strong in this\nperiod among England’s Protestants, notably the Puritans (Sprott\n1961). Nonetheless, the traditional Christian view prevailed well into\nthe late seventeenth century, where even an otherwise liberal thinker\nsuch as John Locke echoed earlier Thomistic arguments, claiming that\nthough God bestowed upon us our natural personal liberty, that liberty\ndoes not include the liberty to destroy oneself (Locke 1690, ch. 2,\npara. 6). \nIn all likelihood, the first comprehensive modern defense of suicide\nwas John Donne’s Biathanatos (c. 1607). Not intended\nfor publication, Biathanatos drew upon an array of classical\nand modern legal and theological sources to argue that Christian\ndoctrine should not hold that suicide is necessarily sinful. His\ncritique is in effect internal, drawing upon the logic of Christian\nthought itself to suggest that suicide is not contrary to the laws of\nnature, of reason, or of God. Were it contrary to the law of nature\nmandating self-preservation, all acts of self-denial or privation\nwould be similarly unlawful. Moreover, there may be circumstances in\nwhich reason might recommend suicide. Finally, Donne observes, not\nonly does Biblical Scripture lack a clear condemnation of suicide,\nChristian doctrine has permitted other forms of killing such as\nmartyrdom, capital punishment and killing in wartime (Minois 1999,\n20–21). \nDonne’s casuistical treatise was an early example of the\nliberalized Enlightenment attitudes of the 1700s. The Thomistic\nnatural-law stance on suicide came under increasing attack as suicide\nwas examined through the lens of science and psychology. Where\nChristian theology has understood suicide as “an affair between\nthe devil and the individual sinner” (Minois 1999, 300),\nEnlightenment philosophers tended to conceive of suicide in secular\nterms, as resulting from facts about individuals, their natural\npsychologies, and their particular social settings. David Hume gave\nvoice to this new approach with a direct assault on the Thomistic\nposition in his unpublished essay “Of suicide” (1783).\nHume saw traditional attitudes toward suicide as muddled and\nsuperstitious. According to the Thomistic argument, suicide violates\nthe order God established for the world and usurps God’s\nprerogative in determining when we shall die. Hume’s argument\nagainst this thesis is intricate and rests on the following\nconsiderations: \nFurthermore, suicide does not necessarily violate any duties toward\nother people, according to Hume. Reciprocity may require that we\nbenefit society in exchange for the benefits it provides, but surely\nsuch reciprocity reaches its limit when by living we provide only a\n“frivolous advantage” to society at the expense of\nsignificant harm or suffering for ourselves. In more extreme\nsituations, we are actually burdens to others, in which case our\ndeaths are not only “innocent, but laudable.” \nFinally, Hume rejects the thesis that suicide violates our duties to\nself. Sickness, old age, and other misfortunes can make life\nsufficiently miserable that continued existence is worse than death.\nAs to worries that people are likely to attempt to take their lives\ncapriciously, Hume replies that our natural fear of death ensures that\nonly after careful deliberation and assessment of our future prospects\nwill we have the courage and clarity of mind to kill ourselves. \nIn the end, Hume concludes that suicide “may be free of\nimputation of guilt and blame.” His position is largely\nutilitarian, allied with a strong presumption of personal liberty. The\nEnlightenment was of course not univocal in its comparatively\npermissive attitudes toward suicide. The most noteworthy opponent of\nsuicide in this period was Immanuel Kant. Kant’s arguments,\nthough they reflect earlier natural law arguments, draw upon his view\nof moral worth as emanating from the autonomous rational wills of\nindividuals (Cholbi 2000, 2010). For Kant, our rational wills are the\nsource of our moral duty, and it is therefore a kind of practical\ncontradiction to suppose that the same will can permissibly destroy\nthe very body that carries out its volitions and choices. Given the\ndistinctive worth of an autonomous rational will, suicide is an attack\non the very source of moral authority. \n(For a contemporary expression of this Kantian view of suicide, see\nVelleman 1999.) \nThe nineteenth and early twentieth centuries brought several\ndevelopments that, while not explicitly philosophical, have shaped\nphilosophical thought about suicide. The first was the emergence, in\nnovels by Rousseau, Goethe, and Flaubert, of a Romantic idealized\n‘script’ for suicide, according to which suicide was the\ninevitable response of a misunderstood and anguished soul jilted by\nlove or shunned by society (Lieberman 2003). The second was the\nemergence of psychiatry as an autonomous discipline, populated by\nexperts capable of diagnosing and treating melancholy, hysteria and\nother ailments responsible for suicide. Lastly, largely thanks to the\nwork of sociologists such as Durkheim and Laplace, suicide was\nincreasingly viewed as a social ill reflecting widespread alienation,\nanomie, and other attitudinal byproducts of modernity. In many\nEuropean nations, the rise in suicide rates was thought to signal a\ncultural decline. These latter two developments made suicide\nprevention a bureaucratic and medical preoccupation, leading to a wave\nof institutionalization for suicidal persons. All three conspired to\nsuggest that suicide is caused by impersonal social or psychological\nforces rather than by the agency of individuals. \nThe principal moral issue surrounding suicide has been  \nSeveral important historical answers to (1) have already been\nmentioned. \nThis question should be distinguished from three others: \nObviously, answers to any one of these four questions will bear on how\nthe other three ought to be answered. For instance, it might be\nassumed that if suicide is morally permissible in some circumstances,\nthen neither other individuals nor the state should interfere with\nsuicidal behavior (in those same circumstances). However, this\nconclusion might not follow if those same suicidal individuals are\nirrational and interference is required in order to prevent them from\ntaking their lives, an outcome they would regret were they more fully\nrational. Furthermore, for those moral theories that emphasize\nrational autonomy, whether an individual has rationally chosen to take\nher own life may settle all four questions. In any event, the\ninterrelationships among suicide’s moral permissibility, its\nrationality, and the duties of others and of society as a whole is\ncomplex, and we should be wary of assuming that an answer to any one\nof these four questions decisively settles the other three. \nThe simplest moral outlook on suicide holds that it is necessarily\nwrong because human life is sacred. Though this position is often\nassociated with religious thinkers, especially Catholics, Ronald\nDworkin (1993) points out that atheists may appeal to this claim as\nwell. According to this ‘sanctity of life’ view, human\nlife is inherently valuable and precious, demanding respect from\nothers and reverence for oneself. Hence, suicide is wrong because it\nviolates our moral duty to honor the inherent value of human life,\nregardless of the value of that life to others or to the person whose\nlife it is. The sanctity of life view is thus a deontological position\non suicide. \nThe great merit of the sanctity of life position is that it reflects a\ncommon moral sentiment, namely, that killing is wrong in itself. The\nchief difficulties for the sanctity of life position are these: \nFirst, its proponents must be willing to apply the position\nconsistently, which would also morally forbid controversial forms of\nkilling such as capital punishment or killing in wartime. But it would\nalso forbid forms of killing that seem intuitively reasonable, such as\nkilling in self-defense. To accept the sanctity of life argument seems\nto require endorsing a thoroughgoing pacifism. \nSecondly, the sanctity of life view must hold that life itself, wholly\nindependent of the happiness of the individual whose life it is, is\nvaluable. Many philosophers reject the notion that life is\nintrinsically valuable, since it suggests, e.g., that there is value\nin keeping alive an individual in a persistent vegetative state simply\nbecause she is biologically alive. It would also suggest that a life\ncertain to be filled with limitless suffering and anguish is valuable\njust by virtue of being a human life. Peter Singer (1994) and others\nhave argued against the sanctity of life position on the grounds that\nthe value of a continuing life is not intrinsic but extrinsic, to be\njudged on the basis of the individual’s likely future quality of\nlife. If the value of a person’s continued life is measured by\nits likely quality, then suicide may be permissible when that quality\nis low (see\n section 3.5)\n (This is not to suggest that quality of life assessments are\nstraightforward or uncontroversial. See Hayry 1991 for\ndiscussion). \nFinally, it is not obvious that adequate respect for the sanctity of\nhuman life prohibits ending a life, whether by suicide or other means.\nThose who engage in suicidal behavior when their future promises to be\nextraordinarily bleak do not necessarily exhibit insufficient regard\nfor the sanctity of life (Dworkin 1993, 238). To end one’s life\nbefore its natural end is not necessarily an insult to the value of\nlife. Indeed, it may be argued that suicide may be life-affirming in\nthose circumstances where medical or psychological conditions reduce\nindividuals to shadows of their former fully capable selves (Cholbi\n2002). \nTwo general categories of arguments for the moral impermissibility of\nsuicide have emerged from the Christian religious tradition. The first\nof these is the aforementioned Thomistic natural law position,\ncritiqued by Hume (see\n section 2.3)\n According to this tradition, suicide violates the natural law God has\ncreated to govern the natural world and human existence. This natural\nlaw can be conceived of in terms of (a) natural causal laws, such that\nsuicide violates this causal order, (b) teleological laws, according\nto which all natural beings seek to preserve themselves, or (c) the\nlaws governing human nature, from which it follows that suicide is\n‘unnatural’ (Pabst Battin 1996, 41–48). These\nnatural law arguments are no longer the main focus of philosophical\ndiscussion, as they have been subjected to strenuous criticism by Hume\nand others (though see Gay-Williams 1996). These criticisms include\nthe following: (1) the natural law arguments cannot be disentangled\nfrom a highly speculative theistic metaphysics; (2) the claims of\nnatural law are confuted by observations of human nature (e.g., the\nexistence of self-destructive human behaviors casts doubt on the claim\nthat we “naturally” preserve ourselves); and (3) other\nacts (e.g., religious martyrdom) which God is assumed not to condemn,\nalso violate these natural laws, making the prohibition on suicide\nappear arbitrary. \nThe second general category of religious arguments rest on analogies\nconcerning the relationship between God and humanity. For the most\npart, these arguments aim to establish that God, and not human\nindividuals, has the proper moral authority to determine the\ncircumstances of their deaths. One historically prominent analogy\n(suggested by Aquinas and Locke) states that we are God’s\nproperty and so suicide is a wrong to God akin to theft or destruction\nof property. This analogy seems weak on several fronts. First, if we\nare God’s property, we are an odd sort of property, in that God\napparently bestowed upon us free will that permits us to act in ways\nthat are inconsistent with God’s wishes or intentions. It is\ndifficult to see how an autonomous entity with free will can be\nsubject to the kind of control or dominion to which other sorts of\nproperty are subject. Second, the argument appears to rest on the\nassumption that God does not wish his property destroyed. Yet given\nthe traditional theistic conception of God as not lacking in any way,\nhow could the destruction of something God owns (a human life) be a\nharm to God or to his interests (Holley 1989, 105)? Third, it is\ndifficult to reconcile this argument with the claim that God is\nall-loving. If a person’s life is sufficiently bad, an\nall-loving God might permit his property to be destroyed through\nsuicide. Finally, some have questioned the extent of the duties\nimposed by God’s property right in us by arguing that the\ndestruction of property might be morally justified in order to prevent\nsignificant harm to oneself. If the only available means to saving\nmyself from a ticking bomb is to stash it in the trunk of the nearest\ncar to dampen the blast, and the nearest car belongs to my neighbor,\nthen destroying his property appears justified in order to avoid\nserious harm to myself. Likewise, if only by killing myself can I\navoid a serious future harm to myself, I appear justified in\ndestroying my life even if it is God’s property. \nAnother common analogy asserts that God bestows life upon us as a\ngift, and it would be a mark of ingratitude or neglect to reject that\ngift by taking our lives. The obvious weakness with this “gift\nanalogy” is that a gift, genuinely given, does not come with\nconditions such as that suggested by the analogy, i.e., once given, a\ngift becomes the property of its recipient and its giver no longer has\nany claim on what the recipient does with this gift. It may perhaps be\nimprudent to waste an especially valuable gift, but it does not appear\nto be unjust to a gift giver to do so. As Kluge (1975, 124) put it,\n“a gift we cannot reject is not a gift”. A\nvariation of this line of argument holds that we owe God a debt of\ngratitude for our lives, and so to kill ourselves would be\ndisrespectful or even insulting to God, (Ramsey 1978, 146) or would\namount to an irresponsible use of this gift. Yet this variation does\nnot really evade the criticism directed at the first version: Even if\nwe owe God a debt of gratitude, disposing of our lives does not seem\ninconsistent with our expressing gratitude for having lived at all\n(Beauchamp 1992). Furthermore, if a person’s life is rife with\nmisery and unhappiness, it is far from clear that she owes God much in\nthe way of gratitude for this apparently ill-chosen “gift”\nof life. Defenders of the gift analogy must therefore defend the claim\nthat life, simply because it is given to us by a loving God, is an\nexpression of God’s benevolent nature and is therefore\nnecessarily a benefit to us (Holley 1989, 113–114). \nIn addition, there is a less recognized undercurrent of religious\nthought that favors suicide. For example, suicide permits us\nto reunite with deceased loved ones, allows those who have been\nabsolved of sin to assure their entrance to heaven, and releases the\nsoul from the bondage of the body. In both Christian and Asian\nreligious traditions, suicide holds the promise of a vision of, or\nunion with, the divine (Pabst Battin 1996, 53–64). \nFor libertarians, suicide is morally permissible because individuals\nenjoy a right to suicide. (It does not of course follow that\nsuicide is necessarily rational or prudent.) Libertarianism, which has\nhistorical precedent in the Stoics and in Schopenhauer, is strongly\nassociated with the ‘anti-psychiatry’ movement of the last\nhalf century. According to that movement, attempts by the state or by\nthe medical profession to interfere with suicidal behavior are\nessentially coercive attempts to pathologize morally permissible\nexercises of individual freedom (Szasz 2002). \nLibertarianism typically asserts that the right to suicide is a\nright of noninterference, to wit, that others are morally\nbarred from interfering with suicidal behavior. Some assert the\nstronger claim that the right to suicide is a liberty right,\nsuch that individuals have no duty to forego suicide (i.e., that\nsuicide violates no moral duties), or a claim right,\naccording to which other individuals may be morally obliged not only\nnot to interfere with a person’s suicidal behavior but to assist\nin that behavior. (See the entry on\n rights.)\n Our having a claim right to suicide implies that we also have rights\nof noninterference and of liberty and is a central worry about\nphysician-assisted suicide (Pabst Battin 1996, 163–164). Since\nwhether we have a liberty right to suicide concerns whether it\nviolates other moral obligations, including obligations to other\npeople, I shall leave discussion of that issue to\n section 3.5\n and focus here on whether there is a right of noninterference.\n(Whether suicidal individuals have a claim right to others’\nassistance is addressed in\n section 3.8.)\n  \nA popular basis supporting a right to suicide is the idea that we own\nour bodies and hence are morally permitted to dispose of them as we\nwish. (Recall from\n section 3.3\n that some religious arguments for the impermissibility of suicide\ndepend on God’s ownership of our bodies.) On this view, our\nrelationship to our bodies is like that of our relationship to other\nitems over which we enjoy property rights: Just as our having a right\nto a wristwatch permits us to use, improve, and dispose of it as we\nwish, so too does our having a right to our bodies permit us to\ndispose of them as we see fit. Consequently, since property rights are\nexclusive (i.e., our having property rights to a thing prohibits\nothers from interfering with it), others may not interfere with our\nefforts to end our lives. The notion of self-ownership invoked in this\nargument is quite murky though. What enables us to own ordinary\nmaterial items is their metaphysical distinctness from us (Cholbi\n2011, 84–86). We can own a wristwatch only because it\nis distinct from us. Materialist philosophers, who hold that we are\nidentical to our bodies, would deny that our bodies are distinct from\nourselves, and even under the most dualistic views of human nature,\nour selves are sufficiently dependent upon our bodies to make\nownership of the body by the self an implausible notion. Indeed, the\nfact that certain ways of treating ordinary property are not available\nto us as ways of treating our bodies (we cannot give away or sell our\nbodies in any literal sense) suggests that self-ownership may be only\na metaphor meant to capture a deeper moral relationship (Kluge 1975,\n119). In addition, uses of one’s property, including its\ndestruction, can be harmful to others. Thus, in cases where suicide\nmay harm others, we may be morally required to refrain from suicide.\n(See\n section 3.5\n for arguments concerning duties to others.) \nAnother rationale for a right of noninterference is the claim that we\nhave a general right to decide those matters that are most intimately\nconnected to our well-being, including the duration of our lives and\nthe circumstances of our deaths. On this view, the right to suicide\nfollows from a deeper right to self-determination, a right to shape\nthe circumstances of our lives so long as we do not harm or imperil\nothers (Cholbi 2011, 88–89). As presented in the “death\nwith dignity” movement, the right to suicide is the natural\ncorollary of the right to life. That is, because individuals have the\nright not to be killed by others, the only person with the moral right\nto determine the circumstances of a person’s death is that\nperson herself and others are therefore barred from trying to prevent\na person’s efforts at self-inflicted death. \nThis position is open to at least two objections. First, it does not\nseem to follow from having a right to life that a person has a right\nto death, i.e., a right to take her own life. Because others are\nmorally prohibited from killing me, it does not follow that I am\npermitted to kill me. This conclusion is made stronger if the right to\nlife is inalienable, since in order for me to kill myself, I must\nfirst renounce my inalienable right to life, which I cannot do\n(Feinberg 1978). It is at least possible that no one has the\nright to determine the circumstances of a person’s death!\nFurthermore, as with the property-based argument, the right to\nself-determination is presumably circumscribed by the possibility of\nharm to others. \nA fourth approach to the question of suicide’s permissibility\nasks not whether others may interfere with suicidal behavior but\nwhether we have a liberty right to suicide, whether, that is, suicide\nviolates any moral duties to others. Those who argue that suicide can\nviolate our duties to others generally claim that suicide can harm\neither specific others (family, friends, etc.) or is a harm to the\ncommunity as a whole. \nNo doubt the suicide of a family member or loved one produces a number\nof harmful psychological and economic effects. In addition to the\nusual grief, suicide “survivors” confront a complex array\nof feelings. Various forms of guilt are quite common, such as that\narising from (a) the belief that one contributed to the suicidal\nperson’s anguish, or (b) the failure to recognize that anguish,\nor (c) the inability to prevent the suicidal act itself. Suicide also\nleads to rage, loneliness, and awareness of vulnerability in those\nleft behind. Indeed, the sense that suicide is an essentially selfish\nact dominates many popular perceptions of suicide (Fedden 1938, 209).\nStill, some of these reactions may be due to the strong stigma and\nshame associated with suicide, in which case these reactions cannot,\nwithout logical circularity, be invoked in arguments that suicide is\nwrong because it produces these psychological reactions (Pabst Battin\n1996, 68–69). Suicide can also cause clear economic or material\nharm, as when the suicidal person leaves behind dependents unable to\nsupport themselves financially. Suicide can therefore be understood as\na violation of the distinctive “role obligations”\napplicable to spouses, parents, caretakers, and loved ones. However,\neven if suicide is harmful to family members or loved ones, this does\nnot support an absolute prohibition on suicide, since some suicides\nwill not leave survivors, and among those that do, the extent of these\nharms is likely to differ such that the stronger these relationships\nare, the more harmful suicide is and the more likely it is to be\nmorally wrong. Besides, from a utilitarian perspective, these harms\nwould have to be weighed against the harms done to the would-be\nsuicide by continuing to live a difficult or painful life. At most,\nthe argument that suicide is a harm to family and to loved ones\nestablishes that it is sometimes wrong (Cholbi 2011, 62–64).\n \nA second brand of social argument echoes Aristotle in asserting that\nsuicide is a harm to the community or the state. One general form such\narguments take is that because a community depends on the economic and\nsocial productivity of its members, its members have an obligation to\ncontribute to their society, an obligation clearly violated by suicide\n(Pabst Battin 1996, 70–78, Cholbi 2011, 58–60). For\nexample, suicide denies a society the labor provided by its members,\nor in the case of those with irreplaceable talents such as medicine,\nart, or political leadership, the crucial goods their talents enable\nthem to provide. Another version states that suicide deprives society\nof whatever individuals might contribute to society morally (by way of\ncharity, beneficence, moral example, etc.) Still, it is difficult to\nshow that a society has a moral claim on its members’ labor,\ntalents, or virtue that compels its members to contribute to\nsocietal well-being no matter what. After all, individuals often fail\nto contribute as much as they might in terms of their labor or special\ntalents without incurring moral blame. It does not therefore seem to\nbe the case that individuals are morally required to benefit society\nin whatever way they are capable, regardless of the harms to\nthemselves. Again, this line of argument appears to show at most only\nthat suicide is sometimes wrong, namely, when the benefit (in terms of\nfuture harm not suffered) the individual gains by dying is less than\nthe benefits she would deny to society by dying. \nA modification of this argument claims that suicide violates a\nperson’s duty of reciprocity to society (Cholbi 2011,\n60–62). On this view, an individual and the society in which she\nlives stand in a reciprocal relationship such that in exchange for the\ngoods the society has provided to the individual, the individual must\ncontinue to live in order to provide her society with the goods that\nrelationship demands. Yet in envisioning the relationship between\nsociety and the individual as quasi-contractual in nature, the\nreciprocity argument reveals its principal flaw: The conditions of\nthis “contract” may not be met, and also, once met, impose\nno further obligations upon the parties. As Baron d’Holbach\n(1970, 136–137) pointed out, the contract between an individual\nand her society is a conditional one, presupposing “mutual\nadvantages between the contracting parties.” Hence, if a society\nfails to fulfill its obligations under the contract, namely to provide\nindividuals with the goods needed for a decent quality of life, then\nthe individual is not morally required to live in order to reciprocate\nan arrangement that society has already reneged on. Moreover, once an\nindividual has discharged her obligations under this societal\ncontract, she no longer is under an obligation to continue her life.\nHence, the aged or others who have already made substantial\ncontributions to societal welfare would be morally permitted to engage\nin suicide under this argument. \nTo this point, we have addressed arguments that concern whether a\nmoral permission to engage in suicidal behavior exists, and\nindeed, it is this question that has dominated ethical discussion of\nsuicide. Yet the social arguments against suicide are fundamentally\nconsequentialist, and some act-utilitarians have discussed the\ncorrelative possibility that the good consequences of suicide might so\noutweigh its bad consequences as to render suicide admirable or even\nmorally obligatory (Cosculluela 1995, 76–81). In fact,\nin some cases, suicide may be honorable. Suicides that are clearly\nother-regarding, aiming at protecting the lives or well-being of\nothers, or at political protest, may fall into this category (Kupfer\n1990, 73–74). Examples of this might include the grenade-jumping\nsoldier mentioned earlier, or the spy who takes his life in order not\nto be subjected to torture that will lead to his revealing vital\nmilitary secrets. Utilitarians have given particular attention to the\nquestion of end-of-life euthanasia, suggesting that at the very least,\nthose with painful terminal illnesses have a right to voluntary\neuthanasia (Glover 1990, chs. 14–15, Singer 1993, ch. 7). Yet\nutilitarian views hold that we have a moral duty to maximize\nhappiness, from which it follows that when an act of suicide will\nproduce more happiness than will remaining alive, then that suicide is\nnot only morally permitted, but morally required. \nHowever, the thesis that there may exist a “duty to die”\nneed not be defended by appeal to overtly consequentialist or\nutilitarian reasoning. In the course of articulating what he terms a\n“family-centered” approach to bioethics, the philosopher\nJohn Hardwig (1996, 1997) has argued that sometimes the burdens that a\nperson imposes on others, particularly family members or loved ones,\nby continuing to live are sufficiently great that one may have a duty\nto die in order to relieve them of these burdens. Hardwig’s\nargument thus seems to turn not on the overall balance of costs and\nbenefits that result from a person living or dying, but on the\nfairness of the burdens that a person imposes on others by continuing\nto live. \nWhile generally acknowledging Hardwig’s suggestion that duties\nto others have been neglected in discussion of the ethics of suicide,\ncritics of morally required suicide raise a number of objections to\nhis proposal. (See Hardwig et al. 2000, Humber & Almeder 2000.)\nSome doubt that the duty of beneficence to which Hardwig appeals\njustifies anything stronger than a permission to take one’s own\nlife when continuing to live is burdensome to others (Cholbi 2010b).\nOthers worry that a moral requirement to engage in suicide raises the\nsinister and totalitarian prospect that individuals may be obliged to\nengage in suicide against their wishes (Moreland & Geisler 1990,\n94, Pabst Battin 1996, 94–95). This worry may reflect an\nimplicit acceptance of a variation of the sanctity of life view (see\n section 3.2)\n or may reflect concerns about infringements upon individual’s\nautonomy (see\n section 3.6).\n Other critics suggest that even if there is a duty to die, this duty\nshould not be understood as a duty that entails that others may compel\nthose with such a duty to take their lives (Menzel 2000, Narveson\n2000). Questions about social justice and equality (whether, for\nexample, especially vulnerable populations such as women or the poor\nmight be more likely to act on such a duty) are also raised. One\nutilitarian response to these objections is to reject a duty to die on\nrule utilitarian grounds: Suicide would be morally forbidden because\ngeneral adherence to a rule prohibiting suicide would produce better\noverall consequences than would general adherence to a rule permitting\nsuicide (Brandt 1975, Pabst Battin 1996, 96–98). \nA more restricted version of the claim that we have a right to\nnoninterference regarding suicide holds that suicide is permitted so\nlong as—leaving aside questions of duties to others—it is\nrationally chosen. In a similar vein, Kantians might claim that\nsuicidal choices must be respected if those choices are\nautonomous, that is, if an individual chooses to end her life\non the basis of reasons that she acknowledges as relevant to her\nsituation. Such positions are narrower than the libertarian view, in\nthat they permit suicide only when it is performed on a rational basis\n(or a rational basis that the individual acknowledges as relevant to\nher situation) and permits others to interfere only when it is not\nperformed on that basis. \nOne initial challenge to the possibility of rational suicide rests on\nthe notion that suicide, being a choice to end one’s life, is\nnecessarily irrational. The thought here is that any coherent\njudgment of suicide’s rationality requires comparing the state\nof being alive (or continuing to live) with being dead. But either\nbecause no one has sufficient knowledge of the state of being dead\n(Devine 1978) or because suicide ensures that the suicidal person has\nno future to look forward to (Cowley 2006), judgments that ending\none’s life is rational are incoherent or misplaced. \nIn recent years, this ‘two-state’ requirement (that death\ncan only be judged rational or irrational if it is possible to compare\nthe state of being alive with the state of being dead) has been widely\nrejected. In particular, the rationality of the decision to end\none’s life need not be construed in terms of the value of being\nalive versus the value of being dead (Luper 2009, 82–88). What\nthose contemplating ending their lives are considering are different\ndurations of their lives, or as Richard Brandt put it: \nHence, on this view, a rational judgment about one’s own death\nrequires a comparison between the overall goodness of one’s life\nas it would be if it continued on its present course and the overall\ngoodness of one’s life if that life ended before its present\ncourse. This view has given rise to a rich philosophical literature\ntrying to identify the conditions under which a person’s\ndecision to die is rational. For the most part, this literature\ndivides the conditions for rational suicide into cognitive\nconditions, conditions ensuring that individuals’\nappraisals of their situation are rational and well-informed, and\ninterest conditions, conditions ensuring that suicide in fact\naccords with individuals’ considered interests. \nExamples of this approach include Glenn Graber, who states that a\nsuicide is rationally justified “if a reasonable appraisal of\nthe situation reveals that one is better off dead.” (Graber\n1981, 65). An appraisal is reasonable, according to Graber, if it\nresults from a clearheaded assessment of how suicide would further or\nimpede one’s overall interests, including one’s present\nand probable future values and preferences. Margaret Battin identifies\nthree cognitive conditions for rational suicide (a facility for causal\nand inferential reasoning, possession of a realistic world view, and\nadequacy of information relevant to one’s decision), along with\ntwo interest conditions (that dying enables one to avoid future harms,\nand that dying accords with one’s most fundamental interests and\ncommitments) (Pabst Battin 1996, 115). \nFor the most part, suicidal individuals do not manifest signs of\nsystemic irrationality, much less the signs of legally\ndefinable insanity, (Radden 1982) and engage in suicidal conduct\nvoluntarily. However, these facts are consistent with the choice to\nengage in suicidal behavior being irrational, and serious questions\ncan be raised about just how often the conditions for rational suicide\nare met in actual cases of self-inflicted death. Indeed, the\npossibility of rational suicide requires that certain assumptions\nabout suicidal individuals’ rational autonomy be true which may\nnot be in many cases. A person’s choice to undertake suicidal\nbehavior may not be a reflection of her considered interests and her\nself-inflicted death could be an act that she would, in calmer and\nclearer moments, recoil at. In other words, even if there is a right\nto suicide rooted in the value of rational autonomy, it seems to imply\na right to suicide only when one makes that determination on\nminimally rational grounds, and there are numerous factors\nthat may compromise a person’s rational autonomy and hence make\nthe decision to engage in suicidal behavior not a reflection of\none’s considered values or aims. Some of these factors\ncognitively distort agents’ deliberation about whether to engage\nin suicide. Though many suicidal persons engage in extensive planning\nfor their own deaths, the final determination to end one’s life\nis often impulsive, reflecting the intense psychological vulnerability\nof suicidal persons and their proclivity toward volatility and\nagitation (Cholbi 2002, Joiner 2010, 70–84). Suicidal persons\ncan also have difficulty fully acknowledging the finality of their\ndeath, believing that (assuming there is no afterlife) they will\nsomehow continue to be subjects of conscious experience after they\ndie. \nParticularly worrisome is the evident link between suicidal thoughts\nand mental illnesses such as depression. While disagreement continues\nabout the strength of this link (Pabst Battin 1996, 5) little doubt\nexists that the presence of depression or other mood disorders greatly\nincreases the likelihood of suicidal behavior. Some studies of suicide\nindicate that over 90% of suicidal persons displayed symptoms of\ndepression before death, while others estimate that suicide is at\nleast 20 times more common among those with clinical depression than\nin the general population. In cases of suicide linked with depression,\nindividuals’ attitudes toward their own death are colored by\nstrongly negative and occasionally distorted beliefs about their life\nsituations (career prospects, relationships, etc.). As Brandt (1975)\nobserved, depression can “primitivize one’s intellectual\nprocesses,” leading to poor estimation of probabilities and an\nirrational focus on present suffering rather than on possible good\nfuture states of affairs. The suicidally depressed can also exhibit\nromanticized and grandiose beliefs about the likely effects of their\ndeaths (delusions of martyrdom, revenge, etc.) Furthermore, suicidal\npersons are often hesitant about their own actions, hoping that others\nwill intervene and signaling to others the hope that they will\nintervene (Shneidman 1985). Finally, although repeated suicide\nattempts by the same individual are common, the impulse to suicidal\nbehavior is often transient and dissipates of its own accord (Blauner\n2003). Taken together, these considerations indicate that the scope of\nsuicidal conduct that genuinely manifests fully informed and rational\nself-evaluation may be rare and so only occasionally will suicide be\nrational or morally permissible. Moreover, if suicide is frequently\nnot an expression of individuals’ rational appraisal of their\nown well-being, that suggests that others may have a prima\nfacie reason to interfere with suicidal behavior and so is there\nis no general right to noninterference. (See\n section 3.7.) \nWith the exception of the libertarian position that each person has a\nright against others that they not interfere with her suicidal\nintentions (Szasz 2002) each of the moral positions on suicide we have\naddressed so far would appear to justify others intervening in\nsuicidal plans, at least on some occasions. Little justification is\nnecessary for actions that aim to prevent another’s suicide but\nare non-coercive. Pleading with a suicidal individual, trying to\nconvince her of the value of continued life, recommending counseling,\netc. are morally unproblematic, since they do not interfere with the\nindividual’s conduct or plans except by engaging her rational\ncapacities (Cosculluela 1994, 35; Cholbi 2002, 252). The more\nchallenging moral question is whether more coercive measures such as\nphysical restraint, medication, deception, or institutionalization are\never justified to prevent suicide and when. In short, the question of\nsuicide intervention is a question of how to justify paternalistic\ninterference (Kleinig 1983, 96–104). \nAs mentioned in\n section 3.6,\n the impulse toward suicide is often sporadic, ambivalent, and\ninfluenced by mental illnesses such as depression, all indicators that\nsuicide may be undertaken with less than full rationality. And while\nindividuals usually have the right to make bad or irrational decisions\non their own behalf, these indicators, when juxtaposed with the stakes\nof the decision to end one’s life (that death is irreversible,\nthat continued life is a condition of all other goods, etc.), justify\nintervention in others’ suicidal plans on the ‘soft’\npaternalist grounds that suicide is not in the individual’s\ninterests as they would rationally conceive those interests. We might\ncall this the ‘no regrets’ or ‘err on the side of\nlife’ approach to suicide intervention (Martin 1980; Pabst\nBattin 1996, 141; Cholbi 2002). Since most situations in which another\nperson intends to kill herself will be ones where we are unsure of\nwhether she is rationally choosing to die, it is better to temporarily\nprevent “an informed person who is in control of himself from\ncommitting suicide” than to do “nothing while, say, a\nconfused person kills himself, especially since, in all likelihood,\nthe would-be suicide could make another attempt if this one were\nprevented and since the suicidal option is irreversible if\nsuccessful” (Cosculluela 1994, 40). Further psychiatric or\nmedical examinations may settle the matter regarding the rationality\nof the suicidal individual’s decision. The coerciveness of the\nmeasures used should be proportional to the apparent seriousness of\nthe suicidal person’s intention to die (Cholbi 2011,\n122–129). \nLastly, if there is sometimes a duty to prevent acts of suicide, is it\never morally permissible, or even morally obligatory, to aid others in\nending their lives? (This possibility is directly related to\nphysician-assisted suicide and the larger question of whether the\nright to suicide is a claim right.) If there are circumstances that\njustify our intervening to prevent suicide undertaken irrationally or\ncontrary to a person’s self-interest, then the same\npaternalistic rationale would justify our helping to promote or enable\nthose suicides that are rational and in accordance with a\nperson’s self-interest. \nCritics of a duty to assist in suicide assert that the widespread\nmoral acceptance of aiding others in suicide invites the prospect of a\n‘slippery slope,’ wherein assisted suicide becomes so\ncommonplace that individuals (particularly members of vulnerable\npopulations such as the aged, the disabled, or socially marginalized\npopulations) for whom suicide is not rational could nevertheless be\nsusceptible to various forms of abuse, manipulation, or undue\npressure, By giving license for others to assist in suicides, critics\nallege, we may unwittingly permit them to encourage suicides not\nbecause those suicides are in fact in the best interests of the\nindividual in question, but because those suicides advance the\ninterests of other people or of institutions.(Pabst Battin 1996,\n145–157). Whether such ‘slippery slope’ worries are\nwarranted is an empirical matter, and existing studies of societies\nthat have legalized assisted suicide by medical personnel do not\nprovide unequivocal support for these worries (Cholbi 2011,\n148–157).  \nSections 3.1-3.8 largely address suicide as a question of\ninterpersonal morality, that is, as a question about our duties to one\nanother (though it should be noted that Kant’s opposition to\nsuicide was rooted in his belief that it violates duties we owe to\nourselves rather than duties we owe to others). However, suicide also\nraises what might be termed ethical questions, such as whether suicide\nexemplifies virtue. Bogen (1980) observes that even when we have\nadequately determined that a given act of suicide is morally\npermissible, questions remain about whether that act represents\n“the best way to live and to end one’s life.” A full\nnormative account of suicide may thus require us to supplement the\nlanguage of interpersonal obligation and rights with the language of\nvirtues and vices: Under what conditions does an act of suicide\nexhibit such virtues as courage, generosity, or justice? Conversely,\nunder what conditions does an act of suicide exhibit such vices as\ncowardice, selfishness, or rashness? While such questions are germane\nto whether suicide is defensible all things considered, they are\ninfrequently addressed in the philosophical literature (though see van\nZyl 2000; Hardwig 1997 can plausibly be read as claiming that\ncontinuing to live is sometimes selfish).  \nSuicide also raises other normative questions that are not obviously\nmoral, such as how suicide may contribute to or detract from the\nmeaningfulness of an individual’s life. For the twentieth\ncentury existentialists, suicide was not a choice to be made mainly by\nappeal to moral considerations but by analyzing whether suicide is an\nappropriate response to the absurdity or meaninglessness of the world\nand of human endeavor. Albert Camus illustrated this absurdity in his\nphilosophical essay The Myth of Sisyphus. For Camus, Sisyphus\nheroically does not try to escape his absurd task of endlessly and\nfutilely pushing a rock up a mountain, but instead perseveres and in\nso doing resists the lure of suicide. Suicide, Camus contends, tempts\nus with the promise of an illusory freedom from the absurdity of our\nexistence, but is in the end an abdication of our responsibility to\nconfront or defy that absurdity head on (Campbell and Collinson 1988,\n61–70). Jean-Paul Sartre was likewise struck by the possibility\nof suicide as an assertion of authentic human will in the face of\nabsurdity. Suicide represents, according to Sartre, an opportunity to\nstake out our understanding of our essence as individuals in a godless\nworld. Questions of whether a life saturated with pain or suffering\ncan be meaningful have also played a part in recent debates about the\njustification of assisted suicide (Little 1999, Varelius 2013). \nAs the foregoing discussion indicates, suicide has been and continues\nto be a rich field of philosophical investigation. Recent advances in\nmedical technology are responsible for the extensive philosophical\nattention paid to one kind of suicide, euthanasia or\nphysician-assisted suicide (PAS), while more\n“run-of-the-mill” suicide motivated by psychological\nanguish is somewhat overlooked. This is somewhat unfortunate:\nEuthanasia and physician-assisted suicide raise issues beyond those\nassociated with other suicides, including the allocation of health\ncare resources, the nature of the medical profession, the\npatient-physician relationship, and the prospect that allowing\nrelatively benign forms of killing such as voluntary euthanasia of PAS\nwill lead down a “slippery slope” to more morally\nworrisome killings. However, many of the same issues and concerns that\nsurround PAS and euthanasia also surround run-of-the mill suicide, and\nmany writers who address the former often disregard the vast\nliterature on the latter. (In addition to the entry on voluntary\neuthanasia, Dworkin et al. 1998, Barry 2007, Pabst Battin\n2003, and Cholbi 2011, 139–61, provide overviews of the moral\ndebates surrounding euthanasia and PAS.) \nNot only is suicide worthy of philosophical investigation in its own\nright, it is a source of insight for various philosophical\nsubdisciplines: moral psychology, ethical theory, social and political\nphilosophy, the metaphysics of personhood, and action theory. Suicide\nis also an area where philosophical interests intersect with those of\nthe empirical sciences. The collective efforts of philosophers and\nothers continue to illuminate one of the most enigmatic of human\nbehaviors.","contact.mail":"mjcholbi@cpp.edu","contact.domain":"cpp.edu"}]
