Republicanism is a political philosophy\nthat defends a concept of freedom as non-domination, and identifies\nthe institutions that protect it (Pettit 1999). In particular,\nrepublicanism stands against two alternative theories of politics. The\nfirst is despotism, especially as manifested in any form of one-man\nrule; a republic is self-governing, and so are its denizens. The\nsecond is liberalism, which posits the primacy of the autonomous\nindividual vis-à-vis public order and government; the\nrepublican values civic engagement in order to realize a form of\nliberty achievable only in and through the community. Republican\ntheorists sometimes refer to writings by historically antecedent\nauthors, such as Aristotle or Machiavelli, but their concern is not\nprimarily accurate interpretation. Rather, to the extent that they\nshow an interest in the past, it is as a source of ideas that they\nfind useful.\n\n\nBy contrast, civic humanism is a historiographical construct. As\nconventionally employed by scholars, the term refers to a group of\nthinkers who emerged during the period of the Italian Renaissance,\nespecially in Florence, and who were committed to public engagement\n(in theory as well as practice) and whose values were fundamentally\nantithetical to the medieval past. The “invention” of\ncivic humanism is primarily associated with Hans Baron\n(1900–1988), the famed German-American historian (Fubini 1992).\nAlthough he first used the phrase in its original German form\n(Bürgerhumanismus) as early as 1925, its popularity\nstems from the publication in 1955 of his classic book The Crisis\nof the Early Italian Renaissance: Civic Humanism and Republican\nLiberty in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny (revised 1966). In\nthis volume, as well as in later writings that built upon it (many\ncollected in Baron 1968 and 1988), he developed what has come to be\ncalled the “Baron thesis” (Witt 1996; Hankins 1995). Baron\nwas not, however, the first scholar to propose the form of humanism\nthat emerged during the fifteenth century in the Italian cities mainly\npromoted the civic vita activa rather than the literary and\nphilological pursuits ordinarily ascribed to the humanists. In two\nbooks from 1952 and 1954,\nwritten and published in Italian, Eugenio Garin defended a position\nalmost identical to that of Baron’s: Renaissance humanism,\nespecially as propounded in Florence, reflects a pronounced shift from\nthe emphasis on contemplation typical of the Middle Ages to the\npriority of civil action to attain a common good (Garin 1947 [1965]).\n(If not for purely contingent reasons, the historiographical label for\ncivic humanism might readily have been “the Garin\nthesis”.) In the present context, it should be noted that some\nadvocates of civic humanism were disposed toward republicanism, but\nthe latter is not entailed by the former.\n\nBaron used the term civic humanism to describe the fusion of two\ndistinct currents of Florentine thought: apolitical so-called\n“Petrarchan” humanism, on the one hand, and the Guelf\ntradition of patriotic resistance by the Florentine city-state to\nimperial domination, on the other (Kallendorf 1996). The\n“rebirth” of ancient letters and wisdom (studia\nhumanitas) marked a revolutionary change in the European mind,\nbut it remained limited to the contemplative pleasure and edification\nof quietist poets and scholars until the beginning of the fifteenth\ncentury. Thereafter, it merged with the assertive defense of the\nsovereign independence of the increasingly rich, powerful, and\nconfident merchant cities of Italy. The fusion was effected, according\nto Baron, as a response to a crisis, namely, the reaction of the\nintellectual and political leadership of Florence to the aggressive\nexpansionism of the despots of Milan. The resulting exaltation of\nliberty combined patriotic self-defense with the upholding of a\nrepublican way of life that departed from medieval ideals by asserting\nworldly values and embracing the active life in a manner evocative of\nthe republics of antiquity. According to Baron’s thesis, in the\nface of military danger the patterns of society, economy, and politics\ncame to cohere in a culture, i.e., an ethos infused with an\neducational vision. The main champions of this were the great\nchancellors of the Florentine Republic, Coluccio Salutati and,\nespecially, Leonardo Bruni, top civil servants and public\nintellectuals combined, who restored the practical pertinence of\nclassical learning in the process of establishing the terms of a new\ncivil consensus. \nBeyond seeking to identify civic humanism with a particular time and\nplace, Baron studied the political culture of Renaissance Florence as\nan instance of an exemplary mode of communal existence. Florentine\ncivic humanism represented for him furthermore a decisive turning\npoint in history. For Baron it was an epochal event that, by looking\nbackward to antiquity, pointed forward to modernity—a movement\nthat he embraced wholeheartedly as a liberating, civilizing,\nprogressive process. The advent of civic humanism marked for Baron the\nvictory of secular economic, social, and political ideals versus the\nasceticism, religious obscurantism, and hierarchy of the Middle Ages.\nCivic humanism provided the vital vehicle for the translation of the\nexalted ancient idea of citizenship to the modern age. The humanist\ndefense of republican liberty against monarchical tyranny announced\nfor him the beginnings of modern democratic thought, elevated by an\neducational ideal of classical inspiration, and accompanied by renewed\ncultural creativity. Civic humanism was thus the harbinger of the\nunequivocally positive trends in modern European civilization. The\nvalue of such achievements appeared all the more compelling since they\nwere not theoretical postulates derived from abstract speculation, but\nrepresented historically realized exempla. \nBaron’s reconstruction of civic humanism was not only directed\nagainst other-worldly values and notions of medieval deference, but\nalso against different modes of construing modernity in terms of the\nautonomy of the self. At issue here, beyond the characterization of a\nhistorical period, was the definition and evaluation of modernity\nitself. Baron wished to see the autonomous humanity he perceived\nemerging in quattrocento Florence integrated within a constitutional\nframe and anchored by patriotic attachment to the community. Baron\nadvocated a vast scholarly program to establish the Italian humanist\ntradition as a major source of modernity. The polities he posited as\ncommendable are not conceived as formal frames of individual life\ngoals—in other words, empty liberalism—but textured wholes\ninto which human autonomy is woven. To state it somewhat\nanachronistically, accepting the nexus of public solidarity embedded\nin civic humanism, and viewing it as an equivalent of civil society,\nBaron’s thesis overlaps considerably with today’s\ncommunitarianism. \nAs previously suggested, both Baron and Garin generally regarded civic\nhumanism as an equivalent to or as a particular variant of\nrepublicanism, meaning a conception of politics in which government is\nin principle the common business of the citizens. The\n“city” provides the environment—a public\nspace—for human fulfillment. More specifically, they appear to\nbelieve that civic humanism derives from classical republicanism of\nsome variety ascribed to Aristotle, Cicero, and Polybius among others\n(although knowledge of Book VI of the latter’s\nHistories before the beginning of the sixteenth century is\ndisputed [Nederman 2016]). Civic humanism is linked in principle to a\nclassical educational program that goes beyond the formative capacity\nof participatory citizenship itself and involves the conscious revival\nof ancient ideals. Republican candor, simplicity of manner, opposition\nto ostentation, luxury and lucre, are common, though not universal,\nrepublican themes. Civic humanists, it is said, promote republican\nideals responding to the fragility of the republic and the need to\nprovide against its corruption and decay with the passage of time. \nAccording to Baron, numerous civic humanist theorists emphasized that\nthe republic requires widespread civic virtue, i.e., the active\nengagement of citizens united by a concern for the common good. The\nvirtues of citizenship are in turn developed and enhanced by being\nexercised in upholding republican political and legal institutions and\nmaking them work by being involved in their operation. Republican life\nis then thought to be formative of the public spirit on which it\nrests. Republican freedom depends on constant civic activity. The\npolity is taken to cohere by means of the common acceptance of\nstandards of justice that are more than procedural rules. The purpose\nof the commonwealth is the realization of human potentiality,\nencouraging the flowering of all forms of creativity and ingenuity\ninsofar as they contribute to public welfare. The republic is the\nnecessary medium of self-realization, not merely the condition of\npossibility of private endeavors. There is a link furthermore between\nthe freedom of the citizen and the independence of the republic.\nCitizen armies and the right to bear arms are therefore common\npostulates of republican theory. Adherents to the “Baron\nthesis” use all of these confluences of civic humanism and\nrepublicanism to support their contention that the two positions are\ninseparable. \nOne important extension of Baron’s position has been proposed by\nJohn Pocock (1975). Pocock takes Renaissance civic humanism to be an\nestimable manifestation of republican and patriotic collective\nsentiment. For Pocock as well as Baron, civic humanism must be\nconsidered the response to a crisis amounting to what Machiavelli\nwould call an occasione, a moment of disorder that gives\nscope to the formative activity of a new beginning that nevertheless\nlooks to the past in order to guide its future. The dilemma faced by\nFlorentine civic humanists, according to Pocock, was to fit the idea\nof an Aristotelian polis within the framework of a Christian\nunderstanding of time. One answer to the experience of disorder was\nthe explicitly millenarian exaltation of the leader of\nFlorence’s republic from 1494–1498, the Dominican preacher\nGirolamo Savonarola. In Pocock’s view, civic humanism provided a\nsecular alternative to Savanarola’s prophetic republicanism, in\nthe form of a revived Aristotelian “science of virtue” as\nthe means of overcoming the republic’s temporal finitude. Given\ndoubts that have been raised with regard to the philosophical depth of\nthe supposed Aristotelianism of the Florentine humanists, another\nrecent scholar of civic humanism, Quentin Skinner has, as an\nalternative, stressed its Roman rather than Hellenic antecedents\n(Bock, Skinner, & Viroli 1990: 121–141). This is not just a\nmatter of identifying sources. Skinner’s revised position means\nrather that in his view, civic humanism advocated active citizenship\nas a means to liberty from foreign and domestic domination, rather\nthan as a self-fulfilling human end. In more recent times, Skinner has\nshifted his position from an historical claim to an entirely\nphilosophical one, in line with the purely theoretical conception of\nrepublicanism discussed above (e.g., Skinner 1998). \nIronically, in Pocock’s adaptation of Baron’s thesis,\nvirtue is opposed to property, and it is the urban, bourgeois\nentrepreneurs and the chancery of the modernizing state, the very\ncreators of civic humanism in Baron’s mind, that reside on the\nwrong side of the fence. Baron’s civic humanists advocated a\ndeparture from the medieval ideals of contemplation and asceticism to\nassert an active life that included trade and profit (Jurdjevic 2001:\n727–728). In the Pocockean version of republicanism, civic\nvirtue is opposed to a vision of citizenship that embraces the private\npursuit of gain. This kind of virtuous polity cannot, however, be\nFlorence—and certainly not Baron’s Florence—the\npalazzi of which were built with the profits of banking,\nmanufacturing, international trade, and interest on the city’s\npublic debt. Pocock’s rearward glance to Aristotle (and even\nSkinner’s to Rome) did not take into account the historical\nrealities of the Renaissance Italian cities, Florence in\nparticular. \nBaron’s interpretation assumes that civic humanism has a core\nthat holds together all of those with whom is associated. In other\nwords, there is presumed to be a single set of principles to which all\ncivic humanists must subscribe in order to merit that appellation.\nPocock attempted to circumvent this problem by treating republicanism\nas “not a program, but a language”. As such it was\navailable to be picked up, selectively and thematically, as\ncircumstances dictated or allowed. Taken on its face, Pocock’s\nconception of republicanism invites us, in turn, say the same about\ncivic humanism, namely, that it need not be equated with a single\npolitical position (that is, republicanism). Although Pocock does not\nacknowledge it, the general discursive ambit of civic humanism\nlicenses Italian thinkers to apply its language to an extensive range\nof political forms and phenomena. \nFor Baron and many others, Leonardo Bruni (1369–1444) was\nregarded to be the paragon of Italian civic humanism (Hankins 1995:\n327; Witt 2003: 392–442), the exemplar of the synthesis of\nhumanistic study and public engagement: he served twice as the\nChancellor of Florence and was intermittently employed in\nadministrative posts by the papacy. At the same time, Bruni was a\nprodigious author and translator, composing a multi-volume history of\nthe Florentine people (based on his access to primary sources),\nproducing Latin versions of works by Aristotle (including\nthe Politics) and other Greek texts, writing biographies of\nnotable Italians for popular consumption, among many other literary\nactivities. \nMost significantly for current purposes, Bruni used his great\nerudition to defend and promote the cause of republican government,\nespecially as practiced in Florence during his day. His\nLaudatio\n(1403–1404 [1978]) are paeans to the city generally (for instance, in\nterms of architectural and artistic beauty, its cleanliness, its\nlocale, and its plentiful resources) but also specifically to the\nvirtue of its citizens and its institutions. (Recall a central feature\nof the “Baron thesis” mentioned above derived from the\nclaim that the Milan crisis of 1402 gave birth to civic humanism in\nboth theory and practice, with Bruni as its exemplary exponent.) Like\nhis contemporaries, Bruni believed that Florence had been founded by\nthe Romans during the republican period, rendering its citizens\ncharacteristically lovers of freedom who stood also opposed to\nimperial and tyrannical rule. This heritage from Rome also yielded the\nsource for Florence’s mild and peaceful relations with other\nItalian cities and their citizens, signaled by its protection of all\nItaly from the domination threatened by the Milanese. Florence was, in\neffect, the savior of the Italian people. \nBoth the Panegyric and the Laudatio explain the\ngreatness of Florence in terms of its self-governing political system.\nThe institutions both foster and are fostered by the public virtue of\ncitizens. Bruni postulates a triad of fundamental republican\nprinciples that Florence draws together: liberty (libertas),\nequality (aequalitas), and just law (ius). The\nFlorentine constitution is so organized that citizens are free because\nthey are equal before the law. These qualities bring us to one of\nBruni’s favorite concepts in his political theory: harmonious\ncooperation and balance among all groups and classes within the city.\nOther Italian cities, he observes, are rife with class conflict\nbetween the great men and mass of the people. The Florentine republic\ndiffers because the entire body of its citizens participate, as\nappropriate, in the government, which, because it is checked in its\npower, resists the temptation of tyranny, whether by the few or the\nmany. Civic humanism, at least as understood by Baron and scholars\nworking in a similar vein, is perfectly captured in the accounts of\nFlorence in the Panegyric and Laudatio. \nYet the fundamental premises of Renaissance civic humanism do not\nnecessarily entail republicanism. Many of the cities of\nfifteenth-century Italy were in fact governed by individuals who were\nself-styled princes or by oligarchic dynasties. As Quentin Skinner\nobserved many years ago (1978: 118–128), humanists were not\nadverse to modification of the virtues associated with civic\ngovernment to suit conditions of a princely regime (see also Skinner\n2002: 118–159). Baron sought to excuse or dismiss such ideas,\nbut his arguments have been challenged  \nOne of the most notable figures to take up this agenda was Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406) in a treatise entitled De tyranno (On Tyranny; 1400 [1927]. Salutati had been not only\nBruni’s instructor but also his immediate predecessor as\nChancellor of the Florentine republic. In the view of Salutati, there\nare valid reasons that one should stand prepared to countenance\ntyrannical rulers at times. In support of what might seem at first\nglance an odd position for a humanist to embrace, he introduces a\ndistinction between two types of tyrants: those who rule without valid\ntitle (usurpers) and those who possess a legitimate claim to office\nbut use their powers unlawfully and unjustly as a result of their\nprideful characters. This difference is decisive for Salutati, whose\nmain concern is with the propriety of slaying tyrants in general and\nwith the murder of Julius Caesar in particular. \nAccording to Salutati, the appropriate treatment of a tyrant is wholly\ndependent upon whether or not he is a usurper. If so, then those\nsubject to him may invoke the Roman law principle that it is\n“lawful to repel by force the assailant of an individual or a\npiece of property and if he persists, to kill him” in order to\njustify resistance to a tyrant. By contrast, Salutati condemns those\nwho argue that wicked princes ought to be killed even when they hold\ntheir office by right. He asserts that only the public authority that\nplaced a ruler in office (whether a superior or the community) enjoys\nthe right to remove him from power; private persons, acting in their\nown right, have no say in the matter. \nSalutati rounds off his treatise by applying his argument to the case\nof Caesar. He purports to prove (in a highly polemical refutation of\nCicero) that Caesar was not a usurper, but instead held legitimate\noffice authorized by the Roman people. Indeed, Salutati maintains that\nif Caesar seemed to behave tyrannically, it was because the tumultuous\ncondition of the times called for such conduct. Caesar is to be\npraised as the savior of Rome, not condemned as a tyrant.\nConsequently, it was entirely wrong for private citizens to slay\nCaesar, since he had not usurped public power. Moreover, to the extent\nthat he was serving the common good, the Romans as a people had no\nlegitimate warrant to remove him from office. Salutati thus\napproaches, if he does not explicitly endorse, a conception of\nbenevolent despotism that challenges the usual bases for\ndistinguishing between king and tyrant. \nAnother Florentine humanist—albeit it one not of the stature of\nBruni and Salutati—went still further in praising monarchy.\nAurelio Lippo Brandolini (c.1454–1497) in his De\ncomparatione reipublicae et regni (On the Comparison of\nRepublic and Kingdoms; c. 1490) defends kingship against the\ncharge made by his fellow Italians (especially, Florentines) that it\nwas inferior to republican government. Writing at the court of the\nHungarian King Mattias, whose patronage he briefly enjoyed, Brandolini\nconstructed a dialogue between a Florentine merchant, Domenico, and\nthe king himself, in which every conventional rationale for the\nsuperiority of republics to other constitutional systems, especially\nmonarchies, is proposed and examined, only to be decimated. Regardless\nof whether or not Brandolini wrote De comparatione merely as\npiece of flattery for King Mattias, his arguments for kingship still\nwarrant serious attention. \nIn the first two books of the dialogue, Domenico’s case in favor\nof the superiority of republican constitutions is demolished by\nMattias. This is hardly what might be expected of a civic humanist, at\nleast if one regards Bruni as the paradigmatic instance thereof. But\nBrandolini manages to use precisely the tools of his humanist training\nto dismiss the main values that led humanists to praise the Florentine\nrepublican constitution. Of more immediate interest, at the beginning\nof the third and final book of De comparatione, the\ndiscussion turns to the examination and defense of the proposition\nthat the governance of one person is best. Initially, this position is\nsupported by means of a set of analogies to the helmsman, the military\ncommander, and the head of the household. Thereafter, the debate\nconcentrates on how the rule of a single excellent man constitutes a\nsafeguard against the real possibility of destructive factionalism\nthat flows from governance by the many. \nBy way of proof, Mattias narrates a notably revisionist account of\nRoman history, according to which the early kings successfully\npreserved peace and concord. Their replacement by consuls led\nnaturally and inescapably to the decline of the city over time into a\nseries of civil wars in which various men contended for power. In the\nsame passage, Mattias indicates that Lorenzo de’Medici in\nFlorence achieved the same effect as did the Roman monarchs, namely,\neliminating from the city the tumults caused by factionalism. A\nsingle, defining political will yields unity. Brandolini thereby\nadopts a position precisely opposed to Bruni, who, as has been seen,\nclaimed that the Florentine republican constitution was the source of\nharmonization among the classes. Brandolini and Bruni focus on\nprecisely the same problem—how to curb faction leading to class\nconflict—but they arrive at radically different conclusions.\nArguably, nothing about Bruni’s position is inherently more\nexemplary of civic humanist than Brandolini’s. \nIt would be difficult to find anyone during the fifteenth century\nbetter qualified than Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini (1405–1464) to\nclaim the mantle of civic humanism. As was the case with the authors\nalready discussed he was steeped in the studia humanitas from\na fine Florentine education. An almost exact contemporary of the great\nhumanists Palmieri, Valla and Patrizi, he enjoyed a sterling\nreputation for his writings; his letters, in particular, compare\nfavorably in their style as well as their substance with the best of\nhumanist literature. He held positions in the imperial court as a\nsecretary and diplomat, and eventually worked his way up the ladder of\necclesiastical preferment to be elevated to the papal see as Pius\nII—often called the first “humanist pope”. Yet, in\nhis most famous work of political thought, De ortu et auctoritate\nimperii Romani (On the Origin and Authority of the Roman\nEmpire; 1446), Piccolomini advanced a defense of a universalist,\nimperial and even absolutist ideal of government under the banner of\nthe Holy Roman Empire. As with many of the authors previously\nsurveyed, such a position would seem wholly incompatible with civic\nhumanism. \nPiccolomini’s argument starts, but does not finish, with\nkingship. Kings were first authorized in the earliest times of human\nhistory in order to shield the rights of weaker men from injury by the\nstronger. This is a theme common to numerous republican civic\nhumanists, drawn from a position held by Cicero, who was an important\nsource for them. The king is regarded as the personification of\njustice. His moral character outshines that of his fellows, so he does\nnot require law as the foundation of his rule, since his judgments are\nso rooted in a sense of justice and equity that they enjoy the force\nof law. A conventional account of the breakdown of kingship would\ninvolve the declining morality of successive kings, leading to\ntyranny. By contrast, Piccolomini detects a quite different inherent\nweakness in political arrangements associated with kingship,\nregardless of the moral qualities of a particular royal incumbent. \nIn De ortu, he points out that the creation of a king was not\na unique or isolated event. Rather, throughout the world there are\nmany kings who rule over a plurality of territories. As these kingdoms\ndefined and expanded their geographical boundaries or spheres of\njurisdiction, they inevitably came into conflict. And since there was\nno means of arbitration amongst such coequal powers, the resolution of\ndisputes between them occurred by means of armed engagements. These\nensuing conflicts between royal powers and their peoples are directly\nthe function of an inescapable structural limitation endemic to\nlocalized or regional kingship per se. It is not morally\ncorrupt rulers alone who are held responsible for clashes over lands\nand rights. Instead, any king who is performing his duties properly\nwill, Piccolomini supposes, inevitably enter into contention with\nanother king and will be compelled to turn to warfare. \nConsequently, the political model of an independent network of\nkingships is incompatible with the very purpose which warranted the\ncreation of kings, namely, the maintenance of just and harmonious\nrelations among human beings. The decentralized distribution of royal\npower ultimately produces an effect which is exactly contrary to that\nintended. Empowered as the agent of social harmony, kingship proves to\nbe its enemy, confounding rather than reinforcing the justice which\nthe ruler is charged with upholding. Notice here how the problems of\nconflict and the absence of harmony, addressed by many civic\nhumanists, manifest themselves in Piccolomini’s thought as well.\nHis solution, however, is quite different from his Florentine\ncolleagues. Since the particularity of royal regimes runs afoul of the\nordained end of political power, the attainment of justice, and the\norder that comes with it, can only be achieved by a universality of\npolitical rule, that is, a single world empire. In imperial government\nalone does political power finally attain a form consistent with the\naim of its original authorization. Once again, one may plausibly\nassert that civic humanist principles might move in a direction quite\ndivergent from republicanism (Lee 2018). \nMachiavelli (1469–1527) is doubtless the best known of all the\nauthors discussed here on account of his Il principe\n(Prince; c. 1512–1513) and (to a lesser extent)\nDiscorsi (Discourses; c. 1514–1519). The\nformer is a somewhat notorious advice-book for rulers who wish to gain\nand hold power; the latter evaluates the strengths of a republican system of\ngovernment. Machiavelli was deeply involved in governing the republic\nof Florence, serving in several important official capacities, until a\n1512 coup against the regime engineered by the Medici family cost him\nhis position. Less often recognized is that he wrote\nprolifically—poetry, plays, histories, military\nmanuals—and left us with a large collection of correspondence\nand dispatches from his diplomatic activities. Scholars from many\nviewpoint, judge Machiavelli to be the epitome of civic humanist\nrepublicanism during the later Italian Renaissance (Najemy 1996). The\nacademic literature on Machiavelli’s thought is immense. Any\nserious attempt to summarize it is a fool’s errand. \nStated simply, Machiavelli encapsulates the multiple forms of civic\nhumanism that have been examined. On the one hand, the\nDiscorsi is said to epitomize the republican ideals of\nself-governance and active citizenship commonly associated with the\nessence of civic humanism. (As mentioned in the Introduction,\nMachiavelli is one of the primary historical figures to whom\ncontemporary republican philosophers look for ideas and inspiration.)\nOn the other hand, Il principe exemplifies the tendency of\nsome civic humanists who have been considered above to look toward\nmonarchic regimes as the preferable form of rule. A plethora of\nscholarly effort has been directed toward attempting to reconcile\nthese two evidently very contradictory positions. Some interpreters\nsuggest, for instance, that the Discorsi represents his\n“real” views, and that Il principe is a satire or\nan attempt to win back his job in the Florentine government or to\nreveal to his fellow citizens the “real” inner workings of\nprincely regimes. Others propose that Il principe reflects\nMachiavelli’s true teachings and that the principles ascribed to\nthe Discorsi are little more than extensions of his earlier\ntract. And some simply assert that no accord is possible. \nIt should be obvious, then, that the characteristics of the civic\nhumanist propensities ascribed by scholars to Machiavelli may be\nunderstood in a vast number of ways. Given the diversity of\ninterpretations, it is perhaps of greater utility to identify a single\ncentral theme shared by Il principe and the Discorsi\nand various civic humanists already discussed. Specifically,\nMachiavelli, like prior Florentine humanists, confronted in his\nwritings the quarrels that arose from conflicts between contending\nsets of interests, whether classes or political entities. All of the\nauthors previously addressed praised their favored form of government\n(republic, monarchy, empire) on the grounds that it introduced harmony\nand peace between clashing groups. \nIn both of his works, Machiavelli acknowledges the existence within\nevery community of two inherently incompatible classes: the\ngrandi (nobles) and the popolo (masses). The nobles\nseek to dominate those beneath them; the masses desire only to be free\nfrom domination. He clearly believes that these two parties can never\nbe brought together in a peaceful fashion. Their interests are simply\nincommensurable. So, Machiavelli’s dilemma is how to avoid the\nnobles and the masses from warring against one another. He provides\ntwo possibilities. In Il principe, he remarks that a prince\nwho wishes to maintain his power must curb the aspirations of the\nnobility, to the extent that a ruler may reasonably consider\ncold-blooded murder as one of his tools. The people, by contrast,\nshould be treated mildly. Indeed, Machiavelli insists that if a prince\nmust choose to side with one or the other class, he should always take\nup the cause of the masses. Why? First, because their numbers are so\nmuch greater than those of the nobles that they are bound to prevail.\nSecond, because the popolo are so distant from the machinery\nof government headed by the prince that they are unable to observe the\nsometimes vicious means by which he must rule. Third, because they,\nbeing uneducated, are easily led by appearances and are unable to\napprehend the truth that the prince seeks to conceal. \nThe Discorsi treats class conflict in an entirely different\nway, namely, as a positive or productive feature of a well-developed\nrepublican system. Machiavelli’s epitome of an ideal republic is\nancient Rome, in which tumult was rife. According to him, by\npermitting rather than suppressing the collision between these two\nsets of interests, Rome succeeded in actualizing and maintaining the\nparamount value of liberty. In a republic of the Roman sort, the\nnobility (via the Senate) has the main responsibility for governing,\nbut the people check that power by means of countervailing offices\n(such as the tribunes) and popular dissent. The struggle between them\nactually generates the liberty of the whole, both in terms of\nself-government unbeholden to either external forces or to tyranny and\nby assuring that the people’s desire not to be dominated is\nachieved. \nMachiavelli recognizes that he is adopting an unusual perspective,\nsince customarily the blame for the collapse of the Roman Republic has\nbeen assigned to warring factions that eventually ripped it apart. By\ncontrast, he insists that precisely those conflicts generated a\n“creative tension” that was the source of Roman liberty.\nOther republican models (such as those adopted by Sparta or Venice)\nproduced weaker political systems, ones that are either stagnant or\nprone to decay when circumstances change. The ultimate sign of the\nunique greatness of the Roman Republic is its conquest of huge amounts\nof territory, as a result of the grandi and the\npopolo setting aside their ultimately interminable struggles\n(at least for a time) in order to cooperate in the subjugation and\nexploitation of vast lands. Class struggle is thus socialized and put\nto effective use. It has been suggested, and with good reason, that a\nsignal element of Machiavelli’s political project was to promote\nFlorence as the new Rome that will impose its domination over the rest\nof Italy. It is perhaps not too great a stretch to call him a civic\nhumanist with imperialistic pretensions (Hörnqvist 2004). \nAs previously noted, Baron posited that the birth of civic humanism\noccurred precisely out of the 1402 crisis in Florence. This position\nhas been challenged on various historical grounds, most notably by\nSeigel (1966). One problem with Baron’s claim stems from his\nevident lack of familiarity with the political philosophy of preceding\ncenturies. Long before the beginning of the quattrocento,\npolitical authors (some of Florentine origin) had undertaken the\ndefense of the republican system of government generally and of the\nRoman Republic in particular in terms redolent of civic humanism.\nWriting c. 1265, a Florentine civil servant exiled to France, Brunetto\nLatini (1948), argued for the superiority of republics (communes) over\nother types of constitution and also described in detail the\nmechanisms of republican governance. Around 1300, another Italian, the\nParis-educated scholastic philosopher Ptolemy of Lucca (1997),\ncomposed an extensive brief favoring the Roman Republic as the ideal\nform of government. The size of the list of pro-republican political\ntheorists writing before 1402 could be multiplied many times over. \nWhy Baron was inattentive to pre-Renaissance European republicanism?\nThe answer may be traced to what civic humanism represented to him:\nmodernity, secularity, rationality; in sum, the “glory” of\nthe Renaissance in contrast with the benighted Middle Ages. Scholars\nhave long since realized that a dividing line drawn between medieval\nand early modern periods is wholly unwarranted (Nederman 2009). Just\nas civic humanism as the designation of an intellectual movement\nwithin the tradition of Western political theory proves to be quite\ncapacious, so its existence and development should be regarded as more\nfluid historically than has often been claimed.
