He\nis famous for uncompromising criticisms of traditional European\nmorality and religion, as well as of conventional philosophical ideas\nand social and political pieties associated with modernity. Many of\nthese criticisms rely on psychological diagnoses that expose false\nconsciousness infecting people’s received ideas; for that\nreason, he is often associated with a group of late modern thinkers\n(including Marx and Freud) who advanced a “hermeneutics of\nsuspicion” against traditional values (see Foucault [1964] 1990,\nRicoeur [1965] 1970, Leiter 2004). Nietzsche also used his\npsychological analyses to support original theories about the nature\nof the self and provocative proposals suggesting new values that he\nthought would promote cultural renewal and improve social and\npsychological life by comparison to life under the traditional values\nhe criticized.\n\nNietzsche was born on October 15, 1844, in Röcken (near Leipzig),\nwhere his father was a Lutheran minister. His father died in 1849, and\nthe family relocated to Naumburg, where he grew up in a household\ncomprising his mother, grandmother, two aunts, and his younger sister,\nElisabeth. Nietzsche had a brilliant school and university career,\nculminating in May 1869 when he was called to a chair in classical\nphilology at Basel. At age 24, he was the youngest ever appointed to\nthat post. His teacher Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl wrote in his letter\nof reference that Nietzsche was so promising that “He will\nsimply be able to do anything he wants to do” (Kaufmann 1954:\n8). Most of Nietzsche’s university work and his early\npublications were in philology, but he was already interested in\nphilosophy, particularly the work of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich\nAlbert Lange. Before the opportunity at Basel arose, Nietzsche had\nplanned to pursue a second Ph.D. in philosophy, with a project about\ntheories of teleology in the time since Kant.  \nWhen he was a student in Leipzig, Nietzsche met Richard Wagner, and\nafter his move to Basel, he became a frequent guest in the Wagner\nhousehold at Villa Tribschen in Lucerne. Nietzsche’s friendship\nwith Wagner (and Cosima Liszt Wagner) lasted into the mid-1870s, and\nthat friendship—together with their ultimate break—were\nkey touchstones in his personal and professional life. His first book,\nThe Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music (1872), was\nnot the careful work of classical scholarship the field might have\nexpected, but a controversial polemic combining speculations about the\ncollapse of the tragic culture of fifth century Athens with a proposal\nthat Wagnerian music-drama might become the source of a renewed tragic\nculture for contemporary Germany. The work was generally ill received\nwithin classical studies—and savagely reviewed by Ulrich\nWilamovitz-Möllendorff, who went on to become one of the leading\nclassicists of the generation—even though it contained some\nstriking interpretive insights (e.g., about the role of the chorus in\nGreek tragedy). Following the first book, Nietzsche continued his\nefforts to influence the broader direction of German intellectual\nculture, publishing essays intended for a wide public on David\nFriedrich Strauss, on the “use of history for life”, on\nSchopenhauer, and on Wagner. These essays are known collectively as\nthe Untimely Meditations.  \nAlthough he assisted in early planning for Wagner’s Bayreuth\nproject and attended the first festival, Nietzsche was not favorably\nimpressed by the cultural atmosphere there, and his relationship with\nthe Wagners soured after 1876. Nietzsche’s health, always\nfragile, forced him to take leave from Basel in 1876–77. He used\nthe time to explore a broadly naturalistic critique of traditional\nmorality and culture—an interest encouraged by his friendship\nwith Paul Rée, who was with Nietzsche in Sorrento working on\nhis Origin of Moral Sensations (see Janaway 2007:\n74–89; Small 2005). Nietzsche’s research resulted in\nHuman, All-too-human (1878), which introduced his readers to\nthe corrosive attacks on conventional pieties for which he became\nfamous, as well as to a style of writing in short, numbered paragraphs\nand pithy aphorisms to which he often returned in later work. When he\nsent the book to the Wagners early in 1878, it effectively ended their\nfriendship: Nietzsche later wrote that his book and Wagner’s\nParsifal libretto crossed in the mail “as if two swords\nhad crossed” (EH III; HH 5).  \nNietzsche’s health did not measurably improve during the leave,\nand by 1879, he was forced to resign his professorship altogether. As\na result, he was freed to write and to develop the style that suited\nhim. He published a book almost every year thereafter. These works\nbegan with Daybreak (1881), which collected critical\nobservations on morality and its underlying psychology, and there\nfollowed the mature works for which Nietzsche is best known: The\nGay Science (1882, second expanded edition 1887), Thus Spoke\nZarathustra (1883–5), Beyond Good and Evil (1886),\nOn the Genealogy of Morality (1887), and in the last year of\nhis productive life Twilight of the Idols (1888) and The\nWagner Case (1888), along with The Antichrist and his\nintellectual biography, Ecce Homo, which were published only\nlater. At the beginning of this period, Nietzsche enjoyed an intense\nbut ultimately painful friendship with Rée and Lou\nSalomé, a brilliant young Russian student. The three initially\nplanned to live together in a kind of intellectual commune, but\nNietzsche and Rée both developed romantic interest in\nSalomé, and after Nietzsche unsuccessfully proposed marriage,\nSalomé and Rée departed for Berlin. Salomé later\nwrote an illuminating book about Nietzsche (Salomé [1894]\n2001), which first proposed an influential periodization of his\nphilosophical development.  \nIn later years, Nietzsche moved frequently in the effort to find a\nclimate that would improve his health, settling into a pattern of\nspending winters near the Mediterranean (usually in Italy) and summers\nin Sils Maria, Switzerland. His symptoms included intense headaches,\nnausea, and trouble with his eyesight. Recent work (Huenemann 2013)\nhas convincingly argued that he probably suffered from a retro-orbital\nmeningioma, a slow-growing tumor on the brain surface behind his right\neye. In January 1889, Nietzsche collapsed in the street in Turin, and\nwhen he regained consciousness he wrote a series of increasingly\nderanged letters. His close Basel friend Franz Overbeck was gravely\nconcerned and travelled to Turin, where he found Nietzsche suffering\nfrom dementia. After unsuccessful treatment in Basel and Jena, he was\nreleased into the care of his mother, and later his sister, eventually\nlapsing entirely into silence. He lived on until 1900, when he died of\na stroke complicated by pneumonia.  \nDuring his illness, his sister Elisabeth assumed control of his\nliterary legacy, and she eventually published The Antichrist\nand Ecce Homo, as well as a selection of writing from his\nnotebooks for which she used the title The Will to Power,\nfollowing Nietzsche’s remark in the Genealogy\n(GM III, 27) that he planned a major work under that title.\nThe editorial work was not well founded in Nietzsche’s surviving\nplans for the book and was also marred by Elisabeth’s strong\nanti-Semitic commitments, which had been extremely distressing to\nNietzsche himself. As a result, The Will to Power leaves a\nsomewhat misleading impression of the the general character and\ncontent of the writings left in Nietzsche’s notebooks. That\nwriting is now available in an outstanding critical edition\n(KGA, more widely available in KSA; English\ntranslations of selections are available in WEN and\nWLN.)  \nNietzsche’s life has been the subject of several full length\nbiographies (Hayman 1980, Cate 2002, Safranski 2003, Young 2010), as\nwell as speculative fictional reconstructions (Yalom 1992); readers\ncan find more details about his life and particular works in the\n entry on\n Nietzsche’s Life and Works\n and in the articles comprising\nthe first three parts of Gemes and Richardson (2013).  \nNietzsche is arguably most famous for his criticisms of traditional\nEuropean moral commitments, together with their foundations in\nChristianity. This critique is very wide-ranging; it aims to undermine\nnot just religious faith or philosophical moral theory, but\nalso many central aspects of ordinary moral consciousness, some of\nwhich are difficult to imagine doing without (e.g., altruistic\nconcern, guilt for wrongdoing, moral responsibility, the value of\ncompassion, the demand for equal consideration of persons, and so on).\n \nBy the time Nietzsche wrote, it was common for European intellectuals\nto assume that such ideas, however much inspiration they owed to the\nChristian intellectual and faith tradition, needed a rational\ngrounding independent from particular sectarian or even ecumenical\nreligious commitments. Then as now, most philosophers assumed that a\nsecular vindication of morality would surely be forthcoming and would\nsave the large majority of our standard commitments. Nietzsche found\nthat confidence naïve, and he deployed all his rhetorical prowess\nto shock his readers out of complacency on this score. For example,\nhis doubts about the viability of Christian underpinnings for moral\nand cultural life are not offered in a sunny spirit of anticipated\nliberation, nor does he present a sober but basically confident call\nto develop a secular understanding of morality; instead, he launches\nthe famous, aggressive and paradoxical pronouncement that “God\nis dead” (GS 108, 125, 343). The idea is not so much\nthat atheism is true—in GS 125, he depicts this\npronouncement arriving as fresh news to a group of\natheists—but instead that because “the belief in the\nChristian God has become unbelievable”, everything that was\n“built upon this faith, propped up by it, grown into it”,\nincluding “the whole of our European morality”,\nis destined for “collapse” (GS 343). Christianity\nno longer commands society-wide cultural allegiance as a framework\ngrounding ethical commitments, and thus, a common basis for collective\nlife that was supposed to have been immutable and invulnerable has\nturned out to be not only less stable than we assumed, but\nincomprehensibly mortal—and in fact, already lost. The\nresponse called for by such a turn of events is mourning and deep\ndisorientation. \nIndeed, the case is even worse than that, according to Nietzsche. Not\nonly do standard moral commitments lack a foundation we thought they\nhad, but stripped of their veneer of unquestionable authority, they\nprove to have been not just baseless but positively harmful.\nUnfortunately, the moralization of our lives has insidiously attached\nitself to genuine psychological needs—some basic to our\ncondition, others cultivated by the conditions of life under\nmorality—so its corrosive effects cannot simply be removed\nwithout further psychological damage. Still worse, the damaging side\nof morality has implanted itself within us in the form of a\ngenuine self-understanding, making it hard for us to imagine\nourselves living any other way. Thus, Nietzsche argues, we are faced\nwith a difficult, long term restoration project in which the most\ncherished aspects of our way of life must be ruthlessly investigated,\ndismantled, and then reconstructed in healthier form—all while\nwe continue somehow to sail the ship of our common ethical life on the\nhigh seas. \nThe most extensive development of this Nietzschean critique of\nmorality appears in his late work On the Genealogy of\nMorality, which consists of three treatises, each devoted to the\npsychological examination of a central moral idea. In the First\nTreatise, Nietzsche takes up the idea that moral consciousness\nconsists fundamentally in altruistic concern for others. He begins by\nobserving a striking fact, namely, that this widespread conception of\nwhat morality is all about—while entirely commonsensical to\nus—is not the essence of any possible morality, but a historical\ninnovation.  \nTo make the case for historical change, he identifies two patterns of\nethical assessment, each associated with a basic pair of evaluative\nterms, a good/bad pattern and a good/evil pattern. Understood\naccording to the good/bad pattern, the idea of goodness originated in\nsocial class privilege: the good were first understood to be those of\nthe higher social order, but then eventually the idea of goodness was\n“internalized”—i.e., transferred from social class\nitself to traits of character and other personal excellences that were\ntypically associated with the privileged caste (for example, the\nvirtue of courage for a society with a privileged military class, or\nmagnanimity for one with a wealthy elite, or truthfulness and\n(psychological) nobility for a culturally ambitious aristocracy; see\nGM I, 4). In such a system, goodness is associated with\nexclusive virtues. There is no thought that everyone should\nbe excellent—the very idea makes no sense, since to be excellent\nis to be distinguished from the ordinary run of people. In that sense,\ngood/bad valuation arises out of a “pathos of distance”\n(GM I, 2) expressing the superiority excellent people feel\nover ordinary ones, and it gives rise to a “noble\nmorality” (BGE 260). Nietzsche shows rather\nconvincingly that this pattern of assessment was dominant in ancient\nMediterranean culture (the Homeric world, later Greek and Roman\nsociety, and even much of ancient philosophical ethics).  \nThe good/evil pattern of valuation is quite different. It focuses its\nnegative evaluation (evil) on violations of the interests or\nwell-being of others—and consequently its positive evaluation\n(good) on altruistic concern for their welfare. Such a morality needs\nto have universalistic pretensions: if it is to promote and protect\nthe welfare of all, its restrictions and injunctions must apply to\neveryone equally. It is thereby especially amenable to ideas of basic\nhuman equality, starting from the thought that each person has an\nequal claim to moral consideration and respect. These are familiar\nideas in the modern context—so familiar, indeed, that Nietzsche\nobserves how easily we confuse them with “the moral manner of\nvaluation as such” (GM Pref., 4)—but the\nuniversalist structure, altruistic sentiments, and egalitarian\ntendency of those values mark an obvious contrast with the valuation\nof exclusive virtues in the good/bad pattern. The contrast, together\nwith the prior dominance of good/bad structured moralities, raises a\nstraightforward historical question: What happened? How did we get\nfrom the widespread acceptance of good/bad valuation to the near\nuniversal dominance of good/evil thinking? \nNietzsche’s famous answer is unflattering to our modern\nconception. He insists that the transformation was the result of a\n“slave revolt in morality” (GM I, 10; cf.\nBGE 260). The exact nature of this alleged revolt is a matter\nof ongoing scholarly controversy (in recent literature, see Bittner\n1994; Reginster 1997; Migotti 1998; Ridley 1998; May 1999:\n41–54; Leiter 2002: 193–222; Janaway 2007: 90–106,\n223–9; Owen 2007: 78–89; Wallace 2007; Anderson 2011;\nPoellner 2011), but the broad outline is clear enough. People who\nsuffered from oppression at the hands of the noble, excellent, (but\nuninhibited) people valorized by good/bad morality—and who were\ndenied any effective recourse against them by relative\npowerlessness—developed a persistent, corrosive emotional\npattern of resentful hatred against their enemies, which Nietzsche\ncalls ressentiment. That emotion motivated the development of\nthe new moral concept <evil>, purpose-designed for the\nmoralistic condemnation of those enemies. (How conscious or\nunconscious—how “strategic” or not—this\nprocess is supposed to have been is one matter of scholarly\ncontroversy.) Afterward, via negation of the concept of evil, the new\nconcept of goodness emerges, rooted in altruistic concern of a sort\nthat would inhibit evil actions. Moralistic condemnation using these\nnew values does little by itself to satisfy the motivating desire for\nrevenge, but if the new way of thinking could spread, gaining more\nadherents and eventually influencing the evaluations even of the\nnobility, then the revenge might be impressive—indeed,\n“the most spiritual” form of revenge (GM I, 7;\nsee also GM I, 10–11). For in that case, the revolt\nwould accomplish a “radical revaluation” (GM I,\n7) that would corrupt the very values that gave the noble way\nof life its character and made it seem admirable in the first place.\n \nFor Nietzsche, then, our morality amounts to a vindictive effort to\npoison the happiness of the fortunate (GM III, 14), instead\nof a high-minded, dispassionate, and strictly rational concern for\nothers. This can seem hard to accept, both as an account of how the\nvaluation of altruistic concern originated and even more as a\npsychological explanation of the basis of altruism in modern moral\nsubjects, who are far removed from the social conditions that figure\nin Nietzsche’s story. That said, Nietzsche offers two strands of\nevidence sufficient to give pause to an open minded reader. In the\nChristian context, he points to the surprising prevalence of what one\nmight call the “brimstone, hellfire, and damnation\ndiatribe” in Christian letters and sermons: Nietzsche cites at\nlength a striking example from Tertullian (GM I, 15), but\nthat example is the tip of a very large iceberg, and it is a troubling\npuzzle what this genre of “vengeful outbursts”\n(GM I, 16) is even doing within (what is supposed to be) a\nreligion of love and forgiveness. Second, Nietzsche observes with\nconfidence-shaking perspicacity how frequently indignant moralistic\ncondemnation itself, whether arising in serious criminal or public\nmatters or from more private personal interactions, can detach itself\nfrom any measured assessment of the wrong and devolve into a\nfree-floating expression of vengeful resentment against some (real or\nimagined) perpetrator. The spirit of such condemnations is\ndisturbingly often more in line with Nietzsche’s diagnosis of\naltruism than it is with our conventional (but possibly\nself-satisfied) moral self-understanding. \nThe First Treatise does little, however, to suggest why inhabitants of\na noble morality might be at all moved by such condemnations,\ngenerating a question about how the moral revaluation could have\nsucceeded. Nothing internal to the nobles’ value system gives\nthem any grounds for general altruistic concern or any reason to pay\nheed to the complaints of those whom they have already dismissed as\ncontemptible. The Second Treatise, about guilt and bad conscience,\noffers some materials toward an answer to this puzzle.  \nNietzsche begins from the insight that guilt bears a close conceptual\nconnection to the notion of debt. Just as a debtor’s failure to\nrepay gives the creditor the right to seek alternative compensation\n(whether via some remedy spelled out in a contract, or less formally,\nthrough general social or legal sanctions), so a guilty party owes the\nvictim some form of response to the violation, which serves as a kind\nof compensation for whatever harm was suffered. Nietzsche’s\nconjectural history of the “moralized” (GM II,\n21) notion of guilt suggests that it developed through a transfer of\nthis structure—which pairs each loss to some\n(punishment-involving) compensation—from the domain of material\ndebt to a wider class of actions that violate some socially accepted\nnorm. The really important conceptual transformation, however, is not\nthe transfer itself, but an accompanying purification and\ninternalization of the feeling of indebtedness, which connect\nthe demand for compensation to a source of wrongful action that is\nsupposed to be entirely within the agent’s control, and thereby\nattach a negative assessment to the guilty person’s basic sense\nof personal worth.  \nThe highly purified character of moralized guilt suggests how it might\nbe a powerful tool for moral revaluation and simultaneously indicates\nsome of Nietzsche’s reasons for skepticism against it. As\nWilliams (1993a) observes, a purified notion of guilt pertaining to\nwhat is completely under the agent’s control (and so entirely\nimmune from luck) stands in a particularly tight fit with\nblame: “Blame needs an occasion—an\naction—and a target—the person who did the action and goes\non to meet the blame” (Williams 1993a: 10). The pure idea of\nmoralized guilt answers this need by tying any wrong action\ninextricably and uniquely to a blamable agent. As we saw, the impulse\nto assign blame was central to the ressentiment that\nmotivated the moral revaluation of values, according to the First\nTreatise. Thus, insofar as people (even nobles) become susceptible to\nsuch moralized guilt, they might also become vulnerable to the\nrevaluation, and Nietzsche offers some speculations about how and why\nthis might happen (GM II, 16–17).  \nBut Nietzsche’s main concern in the Second Treatise is the\ndanger he takes moralized guilt to pose to psychological health. These\ncriticisms have attracted an increasingly subtle secondary literature;\nsee Reginster (2011), as well as Williams (1993a, b),\nRidley (1998), May (1999: 55–80), Leiter (2002: 223–44),\nRisse (2001, 2005), Janaway (2007: 124–42), and Owen (2007:\n91–112). One salient thought is that guilt’s very moral\npurity makes it liable to turn against the agent herself—even in\ncases where it plays no legitimate role in self-regulation, or in ways\nthat outstrip any such role. For example, given guilt’s intense\ninternalization, no connection to an actual victim is\nessential to it. Any observer (whether real or ideal/imagined) of the\nviolation can equally be entitled to resent the guilty party, and that\nfact makes space for religious (or other ideological) systems to\nattach guilt to practically any kind of rule violation, even when no\none was harmed. In such cases, free-floating guilt can lose its social\nand moral point and develop into something hard to distinguish from a\npathological desire for self-punishment. \nThe Genealogy’s Third Treatise explores the\nintensification of such self-punishment via the idealization of\nasceticism. Ascetic self-denial is a curious phenomenon (indeed, on\ncertain psychological assumptions, like descriptive psychological\negoism or ordinary hedonism, it seems incomprehensible), but it is\nnevertheless strikingly widespread in the history of religious\npractice. The Genealogy misses no chance to criticize\nreligious versions of asceticism, but its target is\nbroader—including, for example, the more rational form\nasceticism takes in Schopenhauer’s ethics. What unifies the\ndifferent versions is their extension of the valorization of\nself-discipline in the interest of virtue (which Nietzsche himself\nwould advocate) into a thoroughgoing form of self-condemnation, in\nwhich self-discipline is turned against the agent herself and comes to\nexpress the person’s commitment to her own fundamental\nworthlessness. (One obvious route to such a value system, though far\nfrom the only one, is for the moralist to identify a set of drives and\ndesires that people are bound to have—perhaps rooted in their\nhuman or animal nature—and to condemn those as evil;\nanti-sensualist forms of asceticism follow this path.)  \nAs Nietzsche emphasizes, purified guilt is naturally recruited as a\ntool for developing asceticism. Suffering is an inevitable part of the\nhuman condition, and the ascetic strategy is to interpret such\nsuffering as punishment, thereby connecting it to the notion\nof guilt. Despite turning her own suffering against her, the move\nparadoxically offers certain advantages to the agent—not only\ndoes her suffering gain an explanation and moral justification, but\nher own activity can be validated by being enlisted on the side of\npunishment (self-castigation):  \nFor every sufferer instinctively seeks a cause for his suffering;\nstill more precisely, a perpetrator, still more specifically, a\nguilty perpetrator who is susceptible to suffering,  \nand  \nthe ascetic priests says to him: “That’s right, my sheep!\nsomeone must be to blame for it; but you yourself are this someone,\nyou alone are to blame for it—you alone are to blame for\nyourself!”. (GM III, 15)  \nThus, Nietzsche suggests,  \nThe principal bow stroke the ascetic priest allowed himself to cause\nthe human soul to resound with wrenching and ecstatic music of every\nkind was executed—everyone knows this—by exploiting\nthe feeling of guilt. (GM III, 20)  \nGiven that guilt involves a serious diminution of personal worth, the\neffects of this guilt-inflected ascetic self-understanding must be\nextremely destructive for the agent’s sense of self-worth, and\nultimately for psychological health. \nNietzsche’s account places asceticism in an unattractive light,\nbut the ascetic conception of morality is by no means refuted by\nargument through these considerations. Consider, for example, the\nstance of Schopenhauerian pessimism, according to which human life and\nthe world have negative absolute value. From that standpoint,\nthe moralist can perfectly well allow that ascetic valuation is\nself-punishing and even destructive for the moral agent, but such\nconclusions are entirely consistent with—indeed, they seem like\nwarranted responses to—the pessimistic evaluation. That\nis, if life is an inherent evil and nothingness is a concrete\nimprovement over existence, then diminishing or impairing life through\nasceticism yields a net enhancement of value. Nietzsche’s\nconcern is not so much to refute that view as to\ndiagnose it. He insists that such evaluative commitments are\nsymptoms of psychological and cultural sickness, and that the ascetic\nresponse is an “instinctive”, but ultimately\nself-defeating, effort at self-medication (GM III, 13, 16).\nWhile asceticism imposes self-discipline on the sick practitioner, it\nsimultaneously makes the person sicker, plunging her into intensified\ninner conflict (GM III, 15, 20–21). Thus,\nNietzsche’s fundamental objection to asceticism is that it is\npsychologically destructive and practically self-defeating, even for\nthose (the sick) for whom it does its best work—and this is so\neven if it remains (from a certain perspective) the best they\ncan do for themselves in their condition. \nWhile this section has focused on the Genealogy, it is worth noting\nthat its three studies are offered only as examples of\nNietzschean skepticism about conventional moral ideas. To highlight\njust one other example, Nietzsche attacks the value of compassion\n(another central element in Schopenhauer’s moral theory).\nNietzsche tried out many different arguments against pity and\ncompassion beginning already in Human, All-too-human (1878)\nand continuing to the end of his productive life—for discussion,\nsee Reginster (2000), Janaway (forthcoming), and Nussbaum (1994). At\ntimes, he emphasized the ad hominem suggestion that\ncompassion is less altruistic than it seems, either based on the La\nRochefoucauld-inspired reasoning that apparently altruistic compassion\nis in reality just cloaked egoism (D 133), or based on the\npsychologically subtle point that the satisfactions of pity\nessentially involve a feeling of “small superiority” over\nothers (GM III, 18)—(note that Rousseau relies on a\nsimilar observation as part of his defense of pity’s\nrole in moral development; Rousseau [1762] 1979: 221). But\nNietzsche’s deeper complaints begin from the observation that a\nmorality of compassion centers attention on the problem of suffering,\npresupposing that suffering is bad as such. Nietzsche resists the\nhedonistic doctrine that pleasure and pain lie at the basis of all\nvalue claims, which would be the most natural way to defend such a\npresupposition. If he is right that there are other values,\nindependent of consequences for pleasures and pains, that fact raises\nthe possibility that the ultimate value of any particular incidence of\nsuffering could depend on the role it plays in the sufferer’s\nlife overall and how it might contribute to those other\nvalues; in that case, its badness would not follow immediately from\nthe bare fact that it is suffering. Nietzsche builds this idea into a\nserious argument against the morality of compassion, suggesting that\nsuffering may sometimes promote a person’s growth, or\nprogress toward excellence (GS 338; see also Janaway,\nforthcoming). From that point of view, the morality of compassion\nlooks both presumptuous and misguided. It is presumptuous because it\nconcludes from the outside that a person’s suffering must be\nbad, thereby flattening out “what is most personal”\n(GS 338) in the person’s life and interfering with her\ndeciding for herself on the value of her suffering. It is misguided\nboth because it runs the risk of robbing individuals of their\nopportunity to make something positive (individually\nmeaningful) out of their suffering, and because the global devaluation\nof suffering as such dismisses in advance the potentially valuable\naspects of our general condition as vulnerable and finite creatures\n(GS 338; compare Williams 1973: 82–100). \nThis survey hits only a few highlights of Nietzsche’s\nfar-reaching critique of traditional moral and religious values, which\nextends to many other moral ideas (e.g., sin, otherworldly\ntranscendence, the doctrine of free will, the value of selflessness,\nanti-sensualist moral outlooks, and more). For him, however, human\nbeings remain valuing creatures in the last analysis. It follows that\nno critique of traditional values could be practically effective\nwithout suggesting replacement values capable of meeting our\nneeds as valuers (see GS 347; Anderson 2009, esp. at\n225–7). Nietzsche thought it was the job of philosophers to\ncreate such values (BGE 211), so readers have long and\nrightly expected to find an account of value creation in his\nworks. \nUnfortunately, neither Nietzsche’s ideas about the nature of\nvalue creation nor his suggestions about what specific values should\nbe “created” have seemed as clear to readers as his\nnegative critique of traditional values. (The disparity is often\nmarked in the literature by doubts about whether Nietzsche has a\n“positive” ethics to offer.) There is something to this\nreaction: Nietzsche’s critique has a clear target and is\ndeveloped at an extended scale, whereas his suggestions about\nalternative values can seem scattered or telegraphic. That said, it is\nnot as though Nietzsche is the least bit shy about making evaluatively\nloaded claims, including “positive” ones. To some extent,\ndisappointment among commentators in search of “positive\nviews” arises from our looking for the wrong things—for\nexample, seeking a systematically organized axiological theory when\nNietzsche himself is skeptical of any such project, or expecting any\n“positive” ethics to accommodate certain “moral\nintuitions” which Nietzsche is more inclined to challenge than\nto save. This section surveys some territory Nietzsche covers under\nthe heading “value creation”. After mentioning different\noptions for understanding the nature of such “creation”, it explores some of the values he promotes. \nNietzsche’s talk about the creation of values challenges\nphilosophical common sense. It is common, if not altogether standard,\nto explain values by contrasting them against mere\ndesires. Both are positive attitudes toward some object or\nstate of affairs (“pro-attitudes”), but valuing seems to\ninvolve an element of objectivity absent in desiring. (Consider: If I\nbecome convinced that something I valued is not in fact valuable, that\ndiscovery is normally sufficient to provoke me to revise my value,\nsuggesting that valuing must be responsive to the world; by contrast,\nsubjective desires often persist even in the face of my judgment that\ntheir objects are not properly desirable, or are unattainable; see\nthe  entries on\n value theory\n and\n desire.)\n Nietzsche challenges this basic philosophical conception when he\ntreats value as “created” rather than discovered in the\nworld:  \nWe [contemplatives] … are those who really continually\nfashion something that had not been there before: the whole\neternally growing world of valuations, colors, accents, perspectives,\nscales, affirmations, and negations. … Whatever has\nvalue in our world now does not have value in itself,\naccording to its nature—nature is always value-less—but\nhas been given value at some time, as a present—and it\nwas we who gave and bestowed it. Only we have created the\nworld that concerns man! (GS 301; see also\nGS 78, 109, 139, 143, 276, 289, 290, 299; Z I, 17,\n22, II, 20, III, 12; BGE 203, 211, 260, 261, 285; TI\nIX, 9, 24, 49)  \nPassages like GS 301 have an unmistakable subjectivist\nflavor, tracing value to some source in our own attitudes and/or\nagency, but it is a difficult question how this subjectivist strand of\nNietzsche’s thought is to be reconciled with his ubiquitous (and\nuncompromising, unqualified) insistence that his own value judgments\nare correct and those he opposes are false, or even rest on\nlies. Some scholars take the value creation passages as evidence that\nNietzsche was an anti-realist about value, so that his confident\nevaluative judgments should be read as efforts at rhetorical\npersuasion rather than objective claims (Leiter 2002), or (relatedly)\nthey suggest that Nietzsche could fruitfully be read as a skeptic, so\nthat such passages should be evaluated primarily for their practical\neffect on readers (Berry 2011; see also Leiter 2014). Others (Hussain\n2007) take Nietzsche to be advocating a fictionalist posture,\naccording to which values are self-consciously invented contributions\nto a pretense through which we can satisfy our needs as valuing\ncreatures, even though all evaluative claims are (strictly speaking)\nfalse. Still others (Richardson 2004; Reginster 2006; Anderson 2005,\n2009) are tempted to suppose that Nietzsche’s talk of\n“creation” is meant to suggest one or another form of\n“subjective realism”—a view according to which\nvalues have some basis in subjective attitudes of valuing, but\nnevertheless also gain some kind of objective standing in the\nworld once those attitudes have done their work and\n“created” the values.  \nNietzsche’s meta-ethical stance is treated elsewhere (see \nSection 3 of the entry on \n (Nietzsche’s moral and political philosophy;\n see also Hussain 2013, Huddleston 2014), so in lieu of detailed\ndiscussion, here are three textual observations. First, while a\nfew passages appear to offer a conception of value creation as some\nkind of legislative fiat (e.g., BGE 211), such a view is hard\nto reconcile with the dominant strand of passages, which presents\nvalue creation as a difficult achievement characterized by substantial\nworldly constraints and significant exposure to luck, rather than\nsomething that could be done at will. Second, a great many of the\npassages (esp. GS 78, 107, 290, 299, 301) connect value\ncreation to artistic creation, suggesting that Nietzsche took artistic\ncreation and aesthetic value as an important paradigm or metaphor for\nhis account of values and value creation more generally. While some\n(Soll 2001) attack this entire idea as confused, other scholars have\ncalled on these passages as support for either fictionalist or\nsubjective realist interpretations. In either case, their import\nobviously depends on a suitable understanding of Nietzsche’s\nconception of artistic creation itself. Finally, Nietzsche’s\naccount of “revaluation” remains an understudied source of\nexamples for what he might mean by “value creation”. After\nall, the moral revaluation achieved by the “slave revolt in\nmorality” (see\n section 2)\n is presented as a creation of new values (GM I, 10, et\npassim). In addition to showing that not all value creation leads\nto results that Nietzsche would endorse, this observation leads to\ninteresting questions—e.g., Did Nietzsche hold that all value\ncreation operates via revaluation (as suggested, perhaps, by\nGM II, 12–13)? Or is “value creation ex\nnihilo” also supposed to be a possibility? If so, what\ndifferentiates the two modes? Can we say anything about which is to be\npreferred? etc. \nAside from issues about what it is to create values in the first\nplace, many readers find themselves puzzled about what\n“positive” values Nietzsche means to promote. One\nplausible explanation for readers’ persisting sense of unclarity\nis that Nietzsche disappoints the expectation that philosophy should\noffer a reductive (or at least, highly systematized) account of the\ngood, along the lines of “Pleasure is the good”;\n“The only thing that is truly good is the good will”;\n“The best life is characterized by tranquility”; or the\nlike. Nietzsche praises many different values, and in the\nmain, he does not follow the stereotypically philosophical strategy of\nderiving his evaluative judgments from one or a few foundational\nprinciples. While the resulting axiological landscape is complex, we\ncan get a sense of its shape by considering six values that play\nindisputably important roles in Nietzsche’s sense of what\nmatters. \nThe closest Nietzsche comes to organizing his value claims\nsystematically is his insistence on the importance of power,\nespecially if this is taken together with related ideas about\nstrength, health, and “life”. A well-known passage appears\nnear the opening of the late work, The Antichrist: \nWhat is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man,\nthe will to power, power itself. \nWhat is bad? Everything that is born of weakness. \nWhat is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that\nresistance is overcome. \nNot contentedness but more power; not peace but war; not virtue but\nfitness (Renaissance virtue, virtù, virtue that is\nmoraline-free). (A 2) \nIn the literature, claims of this sort are associated with a\n“will to power doctrine”, commonly viewed as one of\nNietzsche’s central ideas (see\n section 6.1).\n That doctrine seems to include the proposal that creatures like us\n(or more broadly: all life, or even all things period) aim at the\nenhancement of their power—and then further, that this fact\nentails that enhanced power is good for us (or for everything).  \nIn the middle of the twentieth century, many readers (more or less\ncasually) received this as a deeply unattractive, blunt claim that\n“Might makes right”, which they associated with disturbing\nsocial and political tendencies salient in the era (see, e.g.,\nBeauvoir 1948: 72). After the Second World War, Walter Kaufmann ([1950]\n1974: 178–333) engaged in a long-term campaign to recuperate\nNietzsche’s thought from this unsavory line of interpretations,\nlargely by insisting on how often the forms of power emphasized by\nNietzsche involve internally directed self-control and the\ndevelopment of cultural excellence, rather than mindless domination of\nothers. While this account rightly highlighted internal complexity and\nnuance that were flattened out by the oversimplified “might\nmakes right” reception dominant at mid-century, Kaufmann’s\napproach threatens to sanitize aspects of Nietzsche’s view that\nwere intended to pose a stark challenge to our moral intuitions. More\nsophisticated versions of this broad approach—like\nRichardson’s (1996) development of Nietzsche’s distinction\nbetween tyranny (in which a dominant drive wholly effaces\nwhat it dominates) and mastery (in which a more dominant\ndrive allows some expression to the less dominant one but controls and\nredirects that expression to its own larger ends)—are rightly\ninclined to concede the troubling aspects of Nietzsche’s view\n(e.g., that the doctrine countenances tyranny as well as mastery, even\nif it privileges the latter).  \nTogether with such concessions, recent work has made important\nprogress in understanding the internal complexities of\nNietzsche’s position valorizing power. One of the most important\nstrands is Bernard Reginster’s (2006: 103–47) emphasis on\nNietzsche’s conception of power as overcoming\nresistance (BGE 259, 230; GM I, 13; II,\n16–17; A 2; KSA 11[111] 13: 52–3;\n14[173] 13: 358–60; 14[174] 13: 360–2; 11[75] 13:\n37–8; 9[151] 12: 424). This conception connects power directly\nto the person’s capacity to reshape her environment in the\nservice of her ends, and it thereby provides a more intuitive sense of\nwhat, exactly, is supposed to be good about power. In addition, the\ninterpretation locates Nietzsche’s view directly athwart\nSchopenhauer’s efforts to motivate pessimism by appeal to a\nubiquitous “will to life”. By replacing\nSchopenhauer’s will to life with his will to power (understood\nas a drive to overcome resistance, which wills the\nworld’s resistance along with its overcoming;\nKSA 9[151] 12: 424), Nietzsche can argue that our basic\ncondition as desiring, striving creatures can lead to a mode of\nexistence worthy of endorsement, rather than to inevitable frustration\n(as Schopenhauer had it). The same conception has been developed by\nPaul Katsafanas (2013), who argues that, qua agents, we are\nineluctably committed to valuing power because a Reginster-style will\nto power is a constitutive condition on acting at all. (His account\nthereby contributes to the constitutivist strategy in ethics pioneered\nby Christine Korsgaard (1996) and David Velleman (2000, 2006).)  \nA second important strand of recent work emphasizes not a general,\nstructural feature of power like overcoming resistance, but a\n“thicker”, more substantive ethical idea. On this view,\nwhat Nietzsche values is power understood as a tendency toward growth,\nstrength, domination, or expansion (Schacht 1983: 365–88;\nHussain 2011). Brian Leiter (2002: 282–3) criticized what he\ncalled a “Millian” version of this idea, according to\nwhich power is valuable simply because (per the alleged\nNietzschean doctrine) power is in fact our fundamental aim. (This is\nsupposed to be analogous to Mill’s strategy for deriving the\nprinciple of utility, based on the thought that we can show\nsomething—viz., pleasure—to be desirable by showing it to\nbe desired.) Leiter is surely right to raise worries about the Millian\nreconstruction. Nietzsche apparently takes us to be committed to a\nwide diversity of first order aims, which raises prima\nfacie doubts about the idea that for him all willing\nreally takes power as its first-order aim (as the Millian argument\nwould require). Moreover, Nietzsche’s sensitivity to pessimism\nas a possible evaluative outlook creates problems for the soundness of\nthe argument form itself—e.g., even supposing we must aim at\npower, maybe that is exactly what makes the world a terrible place,\nrather than providing any reason to think that power, or its pursuit,\nis valuable.  \nBut Hussain (2011) persuasively argues that if we shift our focus away\nfrom the pursuit of power in any narrow sense to the broader (and\nquite Nietzschean) idea that growth, strength, power-expansion, and\nthe like are all manifestations of life, then at least some\nof Leiter’s philosophical and most of his textual objections can\nbe avoided. On the resulting picture, Nietzsche’s position reads\nas a form of ethical naturalism, arguing that expression of these\nfundamental life tendencies is good for us precisely because they\nare our basic tendencies and we are inescapably in\ntheir grip (Hussain 2011: 159, et passim). It is not clear\nthat this view can avoid the objection rooted in the possibility of\npessimism (i.e., that the value of life/power cannot follow from its\ninescapability for us, since that might be a state to which we are\ncondemned). Given his engagement with Schopenhauer, Nietzsche\nshould have been sensitive to the worry. But Hussain (2011) shows that\na substantial strand of Nietzschean texts do fit the picture, and that\nmany other nineteenth century philosophers who share Nietzsche’s\nanti-supernaturalist commitments were attracted by such naturalist\narguments from inescapability. \nA second value commitment prominent in Nietzsche’s work (and\narguably related to his positive assessments of life and power) is the\nvalue of affirmation. According to Reginster (2006: 2),\n“Nietzsche regards the affirmation of life as his defining\nphilosophical achievement”. This theme enters forcefully in Book\nIV of The Gay Science, which opens with an expression of\ndedication to “amor fati”: \nI want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in\nthings; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful.\nAmor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to\nwage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even\nwant to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my\nonly negation. And all in all and on the whole: someday I wish to be\nonly a Yes-sayer. (GS 276) \nAfter that opening move, Nietzsche develops the idea in several more\nsections: GS 277 expresses Nietzsche’s worries about a\nseductive doctrine of “personal providence”, according to\nwhich “everything that happens to us turns out for the\nbest”, but such an idea could be tempting at all only because of\na far-reaching (and, Nietzsche thinks, admirable) affirmation of life,\nrooted in a talent for self-interpretation that creatively identifies\nsome description under which things really do have “a profound\nsignificance and use precisely for us”; a bit later,\nGS 304 (entitled, “By doing we forego”)\nrecommends against any ethic demanding that we renounce this\nor that or the other, and in favor of one that demands that one  \ndo something and do it again, from morning till evening… and to\nthink of nothing except doing this well, as well as\nI alone can do it;  \nand then in GS 321, Nietzsche suggests that we give up on\nreproaching others directly and just focus on  \nsee[ing] to it that our own influence on all that is yet to\ncome balances and outweighs his…. Let our brilliance make\nthem look dark. No, let us not become darker ourselves on their\naccount, like all those who punish…. Let us look away.  \nFamously, the book concludes with Nietzsche’s first introduction\nof his thought of eternal recurrence, which is supposed to place\n“The greatest weight” on each event through its\nsuggestion that our life is good only if, upon imagining its return in\nevery detail, we can affirm it as it is (GS 341). After that\npenultimate section, Nietzsche quotes the first section of Thus\nSpoke Zarathustra, which returns repeatedly to the same theme of\naffirmation (see, e.g., Z I, 1, 5, 17, 21, 22; II, 7, 12, 20;\nIII, 3, 7, 13, 16; et passim; BGE 56; TI\nVIII, 6 and IX, 49). \nSome have found Nietzsche’s valorization of affirmation ironic,\ngiven the polemical zeal of his negative attacks on Christianity and\ntraditional morality, but in fact, the value of affirmation meshes\nnicely with some key aspects of Nietzsche’s critique. That\ncritique is directed in large measure against aspects of morality that\nturn the agent against herself—or more broadly, against the side of\nChristianity that condemns earthly existence, demanding that we repent\nof it as the price of admission to a different, superior plane of\nbeing. What is wrong with these views, according to Nietzsche, is that\nthey negate our life, instead of affirming it. Bernard Reginster\n(2006), who has made more (and more systematic) sense of\nNietzsche’s praise of affirmation than anyone, shows that the\nmain philosophical problem it is meant to address is the crisis of\n“nihilism”—provoked by a process in which “the\nhighest values de-value themselves” (KSA 9[35] 12:\n350). Such “de-valuation” may rest either on some\ncorrosive argument undermining the force of all evaluative claims\nwhatsoever, or instead, on a judgment that the highest values cannot\nbe realized, so that, by reference to their standard, the world as it\nis ought not to exist. The affirmation of life can be framed as the\nrejection of nihilism, so understood. For Nietzsche, that involves a\ntwo-sided project: it should both undermine values by\nreference to which the world could not honestly be affirmed, while\nalso articulating the values exemplified by life and the world that\nmake them affirmable. (Readers interested in this issue about the\ncompatibility of Nietzschean affirmation with Nietzschean critique\nshould also consult Huddleston, forthcoming, a, which reaches a more\ndiffident conclusion than this entry.) \nIf we are to affirm our life and the world, however, we had better be\nhonest about what they are really like. Endorsing things under some\nillusory Panglossian description is not affirmation, but\nself-delusion. In that sense, Nietzsche’s value of\nlife-affirmation simultaneously commits him to honesty. And arguably,\nin fact, no other virtue gets more, or more unqualified, praise in the\nNietzschean corpus: honesty is “our virtue, the last\none left to us” (BGE 227), and truthfulness is the\nmeasure of strength (BGE 39), or even of value as such:  \nHow much truth does a spirit endure, how much truth does it\ndare? More and more that became for me the real measure of\nvalue. (EH Pref., 3)  \nFour strands in Nietzsche’s valuation of honesty deserve\nmention. Some texts present truthfulness as a kind of personal\ncommitment—one tied to particular projects and a way of life in\nwhich Nietzsche happens to have invested. For example, in GS\n2 Nietzsche expresses bewilderment in the face of people who do not\nvalue honesty:  \nI do not want to believe it although it is palpable: the great\nmajority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. … I\nmean: the great majority of people does not consider it\ncontemptible to believe this or that and live accordingly, without\nhaving first given themselves an account of the final and most certain\nreasons pro and con, and without even troubling themselves about such\nreasons afterward.  \nNietzsche often recommends the pursuit of knowledge as a way of life:\n \nNo, life has not disappointed me… ever since the day when the\ngreat liberator came to me: the idea that life could be an experiment\nfor the seeker for knowledge…. (GS 324)  \nIndeed, he assigns the highest cultural importance to the experiment\ntesting whether such a life can be well lived: \nA thinker is now that being in whom the impulse for truth and those\nlife-preserving errors now clash for their first fight, after the\nimpulse for truth has proved to be also a life-preserving power.\nCompared to the significance of this fight, everything else is a\nmatter of indifference: the ultimate question about the conditions of\nlife has been posed here, and we confront the first attempt to answer\nthe question by experiment. To what extent can truth endure\nincorporation? That is the question; that is the experiment.\n(GS 110) \nA second strand of texts emphasizes connections between truthfulness\nand courage, thereby valorizing honesty as the manifestation\nof an overall virtuous character marked by resoluteness,\ndetermination, and spiritual strength. BGE 39 belongs here,\nas does the passage from the EH Preface quoted above. The\nsame evaluative commitment underwrites Nietzsche’s widespread\nattacks against what he calls “the Biblical ‘proof of\nstrength’”—a form of argument that purports to\njustify belief in some claim because that belief “makes one\nblessed” or carries some emotional or practical benefit\n(GS 347; GM III, 24; TI VI, 5; A\n50–51; KSA 15[46] 13: 441). Such wishful thinking is\nnot only cognitively corrupt, for Nietzsche, but a troubling\nmanifestation of irresolution and cowardice. \nGiven Nietzsche’s personal commitment to truthfulness and his\nargument that its absence amounts to cowardice, it is no surprise to\nfind him, third, attacking the alleged mendaciousness and intellectual\ncorruption of traditional religio-moral consciousness as one of the\nvery worst things about it. The dishonesty of the moralistic\n“slave revolt” is a constant theme (GM I, 14; see\nalso Janaway 2007: 102–4, and GM I, 10, 13; II, 11;\nIII, 26; TI V, 5; VI, 7; A 15, 24, 26–7, 36,\n38, 42, 44, 47, 48–53, 55–6), and it elicits some of\nNietzsche’s most extreme and indignant rhetoric: \nOur educated people of today, our “good people”, do not\ntell lies—that is true; but that is not to their\ncredit. … [That] would demand of them what one may not\ndemand, that they should know how to distinguish true and false in\nthemselves. All they are capable of is a dishonest lie;\nwhoever today accounts himself a “good man” is utterly\nincapable of confronting any matter except with dishonest\nmendaciousness—a mendaciousness that is abysmal but\ninnocent, truehearted, blue-eyed, and virtuous. These “good\nmen”—they are one and all moralized to the very depths and\nruined and botched to all eternity as far as honesty is\nconcerned… (GM III, 19) \nFinally, it is worth noting that even when Nietzsche raises doubts\nabout this commitment to truthfulness, his very questions are clearly\nmotivated by the central importance of that value. The\nGenealogy’s Third Treatise famously closes with the\nworry that the unconditional will to truth is a form of asceticism\n(GM III, 24). As Nietzsche observes, relentless truthfulness\ncan be corrosive for cherished values that make our lives seem worth\nliving: one cross-examination of the norm of “truth at any\nprice” concludes with the exclamation,  \n“At any price”: how well we understand these words once we\nhave offered and slaughtered one faith after another on this altar!\n(GS 344)  \nBut even in the face of such worries, Nietzsche does not simply give\nup on truthfulness. Instead, he calls for a “critique”\nthat will “experimentally” assess its value and legitimacy\n(GM III, 24). That experiment can be no other than the\n“life of the thinker” we met with already—the same\n“ultimate question” about the extent to which truthfulness\ncan “endure incorporation” and be made compatible with\nlife (GS 110). Again and again, in fact, Nietzsche presents\nthis question, “the question of the value of\ntruth” (BGE 1), as his distinctive question,\nthe one centrally driving his philosophy (BGE 1; GM\nIII, 24, 27, GS 110, 324, 344, 346; see also BGE\n204–13, 227–30). It can carry such central significance\nonly because, in Nietzsche’s eyes, the honest devotion to truth\nwas both so indispensably valuable and (potentially)\ndangerous. \nBut if truthfulness is a core value for Nietzsche, he is nevertheless\nfamous for insisting that we also need illusion to live well.\nFrom the beginning of his career to the end, he insisted on the\nirreplaceable value of art precisely because of its power to\nensconce us in illusion. The idea was a major theme of The Birth\nof Tragedy (BT 1, 3, 4, 7, 15, 25), and although\nNietzsche later came to see the point somewhat differently, he never\ngave it up (see GS 107, also TI IX, 7–9). In a\nslogan, “We possess art lest we perish of the\ntruth” (KSA 16[40] 13: 500).  \nArt and artistry carry value for Nietzsche both as a straightforward\nfirst-order matter, and also as a source of higher-order lessons about\nhow to create value more generally. At the higher-order level, he\ninsists that we should learn from artists “how to make things\nbeautiful, attractive, desirable for ourselves when they are\nnot” (GS 299; see also GS 78). The suggestion\nis that artistic methods (“Moving away from things until there\nis a good deal that one no longer sees…; seeing things…\nas cut out and framed…; looking at them in the light of the\nsunset”, and so on; GS 299) provide a kind of formal\nmodel (Landy 2012: 4, 8–19, et passim) for the\ndevelopment of analogous techniques that could be deployed beyond art,\nin life itself—“For with them this subtle power usually\ncomes to an end when art ends and life begins, but we want to be the\npoets of our life” (GS 299). But Nietzsche is just as\ninvested in the first-order evaluative point that what makes a life\nadmirable includes its aesthetic features. Famously (or notoriously),\nNietzsche argues that to “attain satisfaction with\nhimself” one should “‘give style’ to\none’s character” (GS 290). Here, it is the fact\nthat the person’s character (or her life) has certain aesthetic\nproperties—that it manifests an “artistic plan”,\nthat it has beauty or sublimity, that its moments of ugliness have\nbeen gradually removed or reworked through the formation of a second\nnature, that it exhibits a satisfying narrative (or other artistic)\nform—that constitutes its value (GS 290, 299, 370;\nTI IX, 7; EH Frontispiece). Alexander Nehamas (1985)\narticulates and explores this Nietzschean theme of imposing artistic\nstructure onto one’s individual life in considerable detail, and\nmany other scholars have built on his view or explored related aspects\nof the topic (see Gerhardt 1992; Young 1992; Soll 1998; Ridley\n2007a,b; Anderson 2005, 2009; Huddleston, forthcoming, c;\nAnderson and Cristy, forthcoming;\nand the essays in Came 2014). \nOne last point deserves special mention. In Nietzsche’s\npresentations, the value of art and artistry routinely stands in\nopposition to the value of truthfulness—we are supposed\nto need art to save us from the truth (see Ridley 2007a,\nLandy 2002). Significantly, the opposition here is not just the one\nemphasized in The Birth of Tragedy—that the substantive\ntruth about the world might be disturbing enough to demand some\nartistic salve that helps us cope. Nietzsche raises a more specific\nworry about the deleterious effects of the virtue of\nhonesty—about the will to truth, rather than what\nis true—and artistry is wheeled in to alleviate them, as\nwell: \nIf we had not welcomed the arts and invented this kind of cult of the\nuntrue, then the realization of general untruth and mendaciousness\nthat now comes to us through science—the realization that\ndelusion and error are conditions of human knowledge and\nsensation—would be utterly unbearable. Honesty would\nlead to nausea and suicide. But now there is a counterforce against\nour honesty that helps us to avoid such consequences: art as the\ngood will to appearance. (GS 107) \nNietzsche’s formulation (“that delusion and error are\nconditions of human knowledge and sensation”, and that this\ninsight “comes to us through science”) suggests that the\nspecific error theory he has in mind is rooted in the Kantian and\nSchopenhauerian theories of cognition, perhaps as developed in more\nnaturalistic, psychologically-inflected form by later neo-Kantian and\npositivist thinkers. Those views would entail that the basic\nconditions of cognition prevent our ever knowing things as they really\nare, independently of us (see Anderson 2002, 2005; Hussain 2004; and\nthe entry on\n Friedrich Albert Lange).\n But while those are the immediate allusions, Nietzsche also endorses\nmore general ideas with similar implications—e.g., skepticism\nagainst any thought (be it of the theological/metaphysical, or\nHegelian, or more modest, third Critique oriented sort) that\nthe world is purposively suited to fit the needs of our cognitive\nfaculties.  \nWhat is most important, however, is the structure of the thought\nin GS 107. Nietzsche’s idea is that truthfulness\nitself, rigorously pursued through the discipline of science, has\nforced us to the conclusion that our cognitive powers lead us into\n“delusion and error”, so that those very demands of\ntruthfulness cannot be satisfied. This is not just one more case of\nthe world’s being inhospitable to our values, but a special\ninstance where the cultivation of a virtue (honesty) itself\nleads to the unwelcome realization that we can never live up to its\ngenuine demands. In the face of such results, Nietzsche suggests, the\nonly way to escape pessimism is the recognition of another, quite\ndifferent value, suitable to serve as a “counterforce”\nagainst our honesty by showing that there can be something valuable\nabout remaining content with appearances. The cultural value of art in\nGS 107 thus rests on the opposition to honesty offered by the\n“good will to appearance”. So it seems that the\nvalues Nietzsche endorses conflict with one another, and that\nvery fact is crucial to the value they have for us (Anderson 2005:\n203–11). \nFrom the earliest reception, commentators have noted the value\nNietzsche places on individuality and on the independence of the\n“free spirit” from confining conventions of society,\nreligion, or morality (e.g., Simmel [1907] 1920). This strand of\nthought continues to receive strong emphasis in recent\ninterpretations—see, e.g., Nehamas (1985), Thiele (1990),\nGerhardt (1992), Strong ([1975] 2000: 186–217), Reginster\n(2003), Richardson (2004: 94–103), Anderson (2006, 2012a),\nHiggins (2006), Schacht (2006), Acampora (2013), and the essays in\nYoung (2015)—and there is an impressive body of textual evidence\nto support it (UM III, 2, 5–6, 8; GS 116, 117,\n122, 143, 149, 291, 335, 338, 347, 354; BGE 29, 41, 259;\nGM I, 16, II, 1–3; TI IX, 41, 44, 49;\nA 11). Salient as Nietzsche’s praise of individuality\nis, however, it is equally obvious that he resists any thought that\nevery single human person has value on the strength of individuality\nalone—indeed, he is willing to state that point in especially\nblunt terms: “Self-interest is worth as much as the person who\nhas it: it can be worth a great deal, and it can be unworthy and\ncontemptible” (TI IX, 33). Scholars have advocated\nquite different explanations of what makes a person’s\nindividuality valuable in the privileged cases. Some hold that certain\ngiven, natural characteristics that admit no (or not much) further\nexplanation entail that some individuals are “higher men”\nmanifesting genuine value, whereas others have no such\nvalue—Leiter (2002) offers a strongly developed naturalistic\nversion of this approach—whereas others take the\n”true” or “higher self” to be a kind of ideal\nor norm to which a person may, or may not, live up (Conant 2001; see\nalso Kaufmann [1950] 1974: 307–16). Still others attempt to\ndevelop a position that combines aspects of both views (Schacht 1983:\n330–38), or hold that Nietzsche’s position on the\n“overman” or “higher man” is simply riven by\ninternal contradiction (Müller-Lauter [1971] 1999:\n72–83). \nA different approach takes its lead from Nietzsche’s connection\nbetween individuality and freedom of spirit (GS 347;\nBGE 41–44). As Reginster (2003) shows, what opposes\nNietzschean freedom of spirit is fanaticism, understood as a\nvehement commitment to some faith or value-set given from without,\nwhich is motivated by a need to believe in something because\none lacks the self-determination to think for oneself (GS\n347). This appeal to self-determination suggests that we\nmight explain the value of individuality by appeal to an underlying\nvalue of autonomy: valuable individuals would be the ones who\n“give themselves laws, who create themselves” (GS\n335), who exhibit self-control or self-governance (TI, V, 2;\nVIII, 6; IX, 38, 49; BGE 203), and who are thereby able to\n“stand surety” for their own future (GM II,\n2–3). A variety of scholars have recently explored the resources\nof this line of thought in Nietzsche; Anderson (2013) surveys the\nliterature, and notable contributions include Ridley (2007b), Pippin\n(2009, 2010), Reginster (2012), Katsafanas (2011b, 2012, 2014, 2016), and\nespecially the papers in Gemes and May 2009.  \nWe have seen that Nietzsche promotes a number of different values. In\nsome cases, these values reinforce one another. For example,\nNietzsche’s emphasis on affirming life could be taken to enhance\nor to confirm the value of life itself, qua successful\nexpression of will to power, or conversely, one might trace the value\nof affirmation to its acknowledgment of our inescapable condition as\nliving, power-seeking creatures. Similarly, we saw that both the\nvirtue of honesty and the value of art and artistry play essential\nroles in support of the person’s ability to affirm life\n(Anderson 2005: 203–11). Nietzsche appeals to the metaphor of a\ntree’s growth to capture this sort of organic interconnection\namong his commitments: \nFor this alone is fitting for a philosopher. We have no right to be\nsingle in anything: we may neither err nor hit upon the truth\nsingly. Rather, with the necessity with which a tree bears its fruit\nour thoughts grow out of us, our values, our yes’s and\nno’s and if’s and whether’s—the whole lot\nrelated and connected among themselves, witnesses to one will, one\nhealth, one earthly kingdom, one sun. (GM Pref., 2) \nHowever interrelated Nietzsche’s values, though, they appear to\nremain irreducible to a single common value or principle that explains\nthem all. For example, the account of honesty and artistry explored in\nsections\n 3.2.3\n and\n 3.2.4\n revealed that the support they provide to the value of affirmation\ndepends on their opposition to one another, as\n“counterforces” (GS 107): if this is right, then\nNietzsche’s various values may interact within an organic whole,\nbut some of the interactions are oppositional, so they cannot all\narise from a monistic philosophical system. \nThat very fact, however, fits nicely with another of Nietzsche’s\ncore values, the value of pluralism itself. For Nietzsche, a\nperson’s ability to deploy and be responsive to a multiplicity\nof values, of virtues, of outlooks and “perspectives”, is\na positive good in its own right. Nietzsche’s defense of this\nidea is perhaps clearest in the epistemic case, where he insists on\nthe value of bringing multiple perspectives to bear on any question:\nthe thinker must “know how to make precisely the\ndifference in perspectives and affective interpretations\nuseful for knowledge”, because  \nThere is only a perspectival seeing, only a\nperspectival “knowing”; and the more affects we\nallow to speak about a matter, the more eyes, different eyes,\nwe know how to bring to bear on one and the same matter, that much\nmore complete will our “concept” of this matter, our\n“objectivity”, be. (GM III, 12)  \nAs the passage makes clear, however, Nietzschean perspectives are\nthemselves rooted in affects (and the valuations to which affects give\nrise), and in his mind, the ability to deploy a variety of\nperspectives is just as important for our practical and evaluative\nlives as it is for cognitive life. In GM I, 16, for example,\nhe wraps up a discussion of the sharp opposition between the good/bad\nand good/evil value schemes with a surprising acknowledgment that the\nbest of his contemporaries will need both, despite the opposition:\n \ntoday there is perhaps no more decisive mark of the “higher\nnature”, of the more spiritual nature, than to be\nconflicted in this sense and to be still a real battleground for these\nopposites. (GM I, 16; see also BGE 212; TI\nV, 3; and EH I)  \nWhile efforts to provide a systematic reconstruction unifying\nNietzsche’s philosophy around one fundamental thought or basic\nvalue retain their attraction for many commentators, it is fair to say\nthat all such efforts have remained controversial. Meanwhile,\nNietzschean pluralism has been a major theme of several landmark\nNietzsche studies (e.g., Nehamas 1985, Schacht 1983, Poellner 1995,\nRichardson 2004), and some of the most sophisticated recent treatments\nof his value theory have returned evaluative pluralism to the center\nof attention (Railton 2012; Huddleston, forthcoming, b).\nHuddleston’s view is particularly noteworthy, since he argues\nthat Nietzsche’s conceptions of strength and health—which,\nas we saw, are connected to the allegedly foundational value of\npower—are themselves disunified “cluster concepts”\ninvolving an internal plurality of separate and irreducible\ncommitments. In fact, Nietzsche’s commitment to pluralism helps\nus understand how his diverse positive values fit together. From his\npluralistic point of view, it is a selling point, not a drawback, that\nhe has many other value commitments, and that they interact in complex\npatterns to support, inform, and sometimes to oppose or limit one\nanother, rather than being parts of a single, hierarchically ordered,\nsystematic axiology. \nA probing investigation into the psyche was a leading preoccupation\nfor Nietzsche throughout his career, and this aspect of his thought\nhas rightly been accorded central importance across a long stretch of\nthe reception, all the way from Kaufmann (1950) to recent work by\nPippin (2010), Katsafanas (2016), and others. Some of\nNietzsche’s own programmatic reflections highlight the\ncentrality of this enterprise: perhaps most famously, he closes an\nextended treatment of the shortcomings of previous philosophy (in Part\nI of Beyond Good and Evil) with a demand  \nthat psychology be recognized again as the queen of the sciences, for\nwhose service and preparation the other sciences exist. For psychology\nis once again on the path to the fundamental problems. (BGE\n23)  \nIn\n section 2,\n we saw that Nietzsche’s critique of morality rests crucially on\npsychological analyses that purport to expose the self-destructive\neffects of moral attitudes like guilt and ascetic self-denial, as well\nas the corrosive mismatch between the official claims of altruistic\nmorality and its underlying motivation in ressentiment. On\nthe positive side, Nietzsche is equally keen to detail the\npsychological conditions he thinks would be healthier for both\nindividuals and cultures (see, e.g., GS Pref. and 382;\nBGE 212; TI V, 3 and VIII, 6–7). Thus,\nNietzsche’s psychology is central to his evaluative agenda and\nto his projects as a cultural critic. Aside from its instrumental\nsupport for these other projects, Nietzsche pursues psychological\ninquiry for its own sake, and apparently also for the sake of the\nself-knowledge that it intrinsically involves (GM III, 9;\nGS Pref., 3 and 324; but cf. GM Pref., 1). Still,\ndespite widespread appreciation of Nietzsche’s psychological\nacumen that started with Freud himself—and despite the\ncentrality of psychology to his philosophical method, core questions,\nand evaluative aims—even the most basic outlines of his\nsubstantive psychology remain a matter of controversy. Debate begins\nwith the object of psychology itself, the psyche, self, or soul. \nA significant body of Nietzschean texts express extreme skepticism\nthat there is any such thing as a “self”, or\n“soul”, as well as doubts about the traditional faculties\nof the soul and the basic capacities they were supposed to exercise\n(thinking, willing, feeling). This passage from the notebooks is\ntypical—“To indulge the fable of ‘unity,’\n‘soul,’ ‘person,’ this we have forbidden: with\nsuch hypotheses one only covers up the problem” (KSA\n37[4] 11: 577)—and there are many, probably hundreds, like it\n(see D 109; GS 333; BGE 12, 17, 19, 54;\nGM I, 13; TI III, 5 and VI, 3). At the same time,\nNietzsche’s own psychological analyses make free appeal not only\nto the self, but even to some of the traditional faculties, like the\nwill, of which he is most skeptical elsewhere: for example, the\n“sovereign individual” of GM II, 1–3 is\ndistinctive for developing a “memory of the will” that\nunderwrites his capacity to keep promises and “vouch for himself\nas future” (GM I, 13); or again, Nietzsche’s\nfavored strategy of deploying a multiplicity of perspectives in\nknowledge (see\n section 3.2.6)\n assumes the existence of a cognitive self that stands back from\nparticular drives and affects, and so has “the ability to\ncontrol one’s Pro and Con and dispose of them” in\nsupport of the larger cognitive project (GM III, 12, see also\nBGE 284).  \nThis apparent conflict in the texts has encouraged competing\ninterpretations, with commentators emphasizing the strands in\nNietzsche to which they have more philosophical sympathy. For example,\nstrongly naturalist interpreters like Brian Leiter (2002, 2007) and\nMatthias Risse (2007) focus on Nietzsche’s skepticism about the\nwill and the pure soul to reject any Kantian-style source of agency\nthat can stand apart from and direct the person’s basic drives\nor fundamental nature. Somewhat similarly, readers attracted by a\nCartesian conception of consciousness as the essence of the mental,\nbut repelled by Cartesian dualism, highlight Nietzsche’s\nemphasis on the importance of the body (GM III, 16;\nZ I, 4) to suggest that his apparent claims about psychology\nshould be heard instead as a kind of physiology of drives\nthat rejects mental psychology altogether (for different\nversions, see Poellner 1995: 216–29, 174; Haar [1993] 1996: 90,\net passim). Attacking unity rather than mentality, a group of\nreaders interested in Nietzsche’s agonistic conception of\npolitics tends to emphasize his similarly agonistic, internally\ncontested, conception of the self (Hatab 1995; Acampora 2013). In a\ndiametrically opposed direction from those first three, Sebastian\nGardner (2009) insists that, while Nietzsche was sometimes tempted by\nskepticism about a self which can stand back from the solicitations of\ninclination and control them, his own doctrines about the creation of\nvalue and self-overcoming in fact commit him to something like a\nKantian transcendental ego, despite his protestations to the contrary.\n \nNietzsche’s actual psychological explanations rely heavily on\nappeals to sub-personal psychological attitudes. As Janaway (2009: 52)\nobserves, a great many different kinds of attitude enter these\naccounts (including not only the standard beliefs and desires of\ncurrent-day moral psychology, but also “wills”, feelings,\nsensations, moods, imaginings, memories, valuations, convictions, and\nmore), but arguably the core attitudes that do the most work for him\nare drives and affects. These attitude types have\nbeen intensively studied in recent work (see esp. Richardson 1996 and\nKatsafanas 2011b, 2013, 2016; see also Anderson 2012a, Clark and\nDudrick 2015). While much remains controversial, it is helpful to\nthink of drives as dispositions toward general patterns of activity;\nthey aim at activity of the relevant sort (e.g., an eating drive, a\ndrive for power), and they also represent some more specific object or\noccasion of the activity in a particular case (e.g., this ice cream,\nor overcoming a particular problem in the course of writing a paper).\nAffects are emotional states that combine a receptive and felt\nresponsiveness to the world with a tendency toward a distinctive\npattern of reaction—states like love, hate, anger, fear, joy,\netc. Typically, the sub-personal attitudes postulated in\nNietzsche’s psychological explanations represent the world in\none way or another. Since he endorses Leibniz’s thought that\nrepresentation, not consciousness, is the decisive mark of the mental\n(GS 354), it is reasonable to treat these attitudes as\ndistinctively psychological, whether they are conscious or not. \nBut what about a personal-level self to serve as the owner of such\nattitudes? It seems that Nietzsche’s postulated drives and\naffects could not coherently be counted as psychological (and\nsub-personal) without such a self, and yet, the skeptical\npassages canvassed above seem to rule out any such thing. This remains\na controversial problem, but it is clear at least that\nNietzsche’s own proposal was to develop a radically reformed\nconception of the psyche, rather than to reject the self, or soul,\naltogether. BGE 12 provides some provocative ideas about what\nsuch a reformed conception might involve: there, Nietzsche insists\nthat we should “give the finishing stroke” to what he\ncalls “the soul atomism”, which he goes on to\nexplain as \nthe belief which regards the soul as something indestructible,\neternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon:…\nBetween ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of “the\nsoul” at the same time, and thus to renounce one of the most\nancient and venerable hypotheses—as happens frequently to clumsy\nnaturalists who can hardly touch on “the soul” without\nimmediately losing it. But the way is now open for new versions and\nrefinements of the soul hypothesis, [including] “mortal\nsoul”, “soul as subjective multiplicity”, and\n“soul as social structure of the drives and\naffects”… (BGE 12) \nHere Nietzsche alludes to traditional rational psychology, and its\nbasic inference from the pure unity of consciousness to the\nsimplicity of the soul, and thence to its indivisibility,\nindestructibility, and immortality. As he notes, these moves treat the\nsoul as an indivisible (hence incorruptible) atom, or monad.\nNietzsche’s alternative proposal takes its shape from the\nrejection of such atomism—the soul as he understands it will be\ninternally complex, rather than simple, and therefore subject to\ndisintegration. That idea informs Nietzsche’s striking slogans\nabout the soul’s “mortality”,\n“multiplicity”, and internal “social\nstructure”. The “drives and affects” are evidently\nsupposed to serve as the constituents comprising this multiplicity.\nNietzsche thus construes the psyche, or self, as an emergent structure\narising from such sub-personal constituents (when those stand in the\nappropriate relations), thereby reversing the traditional account,\nwhich treats sub-personal attitudes as mere modes, or ways of being,\nproper to a preexisting unitary mental substance—(see Anderson\n2012a for an attempt to flesh out the picture; see also Gemes 2001;\nHales and Welshon 2000: 157–82). But however vulnerable, mortal,\nand subject to inner division the soul is supposed to be on the\nreformed conception, it nevertheless remains (as Nietzsche’s\nrejection of reductive naturalism makes clear) a genuinely\npsychological entity over and above its constituent drives\nand affects. Moreover, since the drives and affects that constitute it\nare individuated largely in terms of what (and how) they\nrepresent, the psychology needed to investigate the soul must\nbe an interpretive, and not merely and strictly a causal, form of\ninquiry (see Pippin 2010). \nIn these respects, Nietzsche’s psychology treats the self as\nsomething that has to be achieved or constructed, rather than\nas something fundamentally given as part of the basic\nmetaphysical equipment with which a person enters the world. This idea\nof the self as achieved rather than given was noticed already by\nSchacht (1983), and was elevated into a central theme in\nNehamas’s (1985) influential Nietzsche interpretation. On that\nreading, the project of individual self-fashioning, or self-creation,\nis located at the heart of Nietzsche’s philosophical agenda (see\nesp. GS 290, 335; TI IX, 49). Highlighting\nNietzsche’s commitments to the values of artistry and\nindividuality, the interpretation claims that the main goal of\nNietzsche’s new philosophers would be to construct novel,\ninteresting, and culturally resonant individual lives, whose overall\nshape they could affirm (despite whatever setbacks they involve) on\nthe strength of the (broadly) aesthetic value they instantiate. In\nNehamas’s version, this agenda was centrally bound up with\nNietzsche’s project as a writer; he is supposed to have created\nhimself, in the relevant sense, as an authorial persona through\nwriting such distinctive books (Nehamas 1985; see esp. 233–4).\nWhile this suggestion, and even the very idea of self-creation, has\nremained controversial both textually and philosophically (see, e.g.,\nPippin 2010: 109–11),\nit has led to much further\nwork—some directly influenced by Nehamas (1985), some developed\nin partial or entire opposition to it—yielding real insights\nabout the nature of Nietzschean selfhood, and the relations among the\nkey ideas of self-creation, the creation of value, individuality, and\nNietzschean freedom (see, e.g., Gerhardt 1992; Nehamas 1998:\n128–56; Leiter 1998; May 1999: 107–26; Anderson and Landy\n2001; Reginster 2003; Anderson 2005, 2009, 2012a;\nRidley 2007a,b; Gardner 2009;\nGemes 2009a; Pippin 2009, 2010; Poellner 2009; Richardson 2009;\nAcampora 2013; Katsafanas 2016: 164–96, 220–56; Anderson\nand Cristy, forthcoming). \nFor all the novelty of Nietzsche’s doctrines and the apparent\nextremity of his criticisms of traditional morality, religion, and\nphilosophy, perhaps nothing about his work seems more out of step with\nthe ordinary procedures of philosophy than the way he writes. The\npoint is sufficiently obvious that it has by now become an entirely\nconventional trope to begin commentaries with remarks about the\nunconventional character of Nietzsche’s style. Despite\nthe attention it gets, however, we continue to lack anything like a\ncomprehensive account of Nietzsche’s strategies as a writer and\nrhetorician. Most of us (this entry included) are defeated by the\nbewildering richness of the subject matter and content ourselves with\na few observations of special relevance to our other purposes. Perhaps\nAlexander Nehamas (1985: 13–41) comes closest to meeting the\nexplanatory challenge by highlighting the key underlying fact that\ndefeats our interpretive efforts—the seemingly endless variety\nof stylistic effects that Nietzsche deploys. In doing so, he follows\nthe lead of Nietzsche’s own retrospective assessment from\nEcce Homo: “I have many stylistic\npossibilities—the most multifarious art of style that has ever\nbeen at the disposal of one man” (EH III, 4). This\nentry will focus on a few points useful for readers making their early\napproaches to Nietzsche’s texts. \nNietzsche’s most obvious departure from conventional\nphilosophical writing is the basic plan and construction of his books.\nMost philosophers write treatises or scholarly articles, governed by a\nprecisely articulated thesis for which they present a sustained and\ncarefully defended argument. Nietzsche’s books are nothing like\nthat. Many are divided into short, numbered sections, which only\nsometimes have obvious connections to nearby sections. While the\nsections within a part are often thematically related (see, e.g.,\nGS Book II or BGE Parts I, V, VI), even then they do\nnot typically fit together into a single overall argument. Nietzsche\nhimself notes the briskness with which he treats his concerns,\ninsisting that “I approach deep problems like cold baths:\nquickly into them and quickly out again”. To the natural\ncomplaint that such telegraphic treatment courts misunderstanding, he\nreplies that  \nOne does not only wish to be understood when one writes; one wishes\njust as surely not to be understood. … [Some authors]\ndid not wish to be understood by “just anybody”.\n(GS 381)  \nSome of Nietzsche’s books (notably The Birth of\nTragedy, the Genealogy, and the Antichrist)\noffer greater continuity of argumentation, but even there, he will\noften take advantage of section breaks to drop one thread of reasoning\nand move on to apparently unrelated points, leaving the reader to\npiece together how the various aspects of his case are supposed to fit\ntogether (GM II is a notoriously challenging case in point).\nThus Spoke Zarathustra is unified by following the career of\na central character, but the unity is loose and\npicaresque-like—a sequence of episodes which arrives at a\nsomewhat equivocal (or at a minimum, at a controversial)\nconclusion that imposes only weak narrative unity on the whole. \nThis mode of writing is often classified as “aphoristic”,\nand Nietzsche is rightly granted an honored place within the\ndistinguished lineage of that form in German philosophy, which goes\nback at least to Georg Lichtenberg’s Waste Books.\nLichtenberg wrote his fragments for himself rather than the public,\nbut the strategies he developed nevertheless made a serious impact.\nHis aphorisms revealed how the form could be extended from its\nessentially pedagogical origins (providing compressed, memorable form\nfor some principle or observation) into a sustained, exploratory mode\nof reasoning with oneself. Schopenhauer was a particular admirer, and\nhis pursuit of the form (especially in Parerga and\nParalipomena) clearly influenced Nietzsche’s use of the\ntechnique to frame his psychological observations—(the French\nmoralistes were also an important influence; see Pippin\n2010).  \nSome of Nietzsche’s efforts consist in straightforward\npsychological analysis, like this—“Egoism is the law of\nperspective applied to feelings: what is closest appears large and\nweighty, and as one moves further away size and weight decrease”\n(GS 162)—while others encapsulate a point Nietzsche has\nbeen developing through the section (see, e.g., “We are always\nonly in our own company”, GS 166). More distinctively,\nhowever, many Nietzschean aphorisms rely on a “twist”\neffect—the first part sets up a certain expectation, which is\nthen controverted or deepened by a thought-provoking reversal in the\nsecond part. Occasionally, these aphorisms are even set up as\nmini-dialogues:  \nA: “One is praised only by one’s peers.”\n\nB: “Yes, and whoever praises you says: I am your peer”.\n(GS 190)  \nMany aphorisms exhibiting this sort of “twist” trade on\nthe type of cynicism typical in moralistes like La\nRochefoucauld, but however much he learned from the French, Nietzsche\nbrought larger ambitions to the form; he is equally willing to leave\ncynicism behind and deploy the twist form simply to provoke active\nreflection in the reader, as he does here: “Every habit lends\nour hand more wit but makes our wit less handy” (GS\n247). Kaufmann ([1950] 1974: 72–95) famously suggested that\nNietzsche coined his aphorisms in the service of an\n“experimentalist” mode of philosophizing, and there is\nsomething to the idea. But the reader should take care, for not every\nNietzschean aphorism is an experiment, and not every short section is\nan aphorism. Indeed, many sections build up to an aphorism,\nwhich enters only as a proper part included within the section,\nperhaps serving as its culmination or a kind of summative conclusion\n(rather than experiment).  \nA particularly important case in point is the “aphorism placed\nbefore this [Third] treatise” of the Genealogy, which\nNietzsche’s Preface (GM Pref., 8) offers to the reader\nas an especially good example of the densely summative power of the\nform—the entire Third Treatise is supposed to be just an\ninterpretation of that aphorism. Maudemarie Clark (1997), John Wilcox\n(1997), and Christopher Janaway (1997) showed convincingly that the\naphorism in question appears in section 1 of the Third Treatise, and\nis not the Treatise’s epigram. But the first section itself is\nnot simply one long aphorism. Instead, the aphorism that requires so\nmuch interpretation is the compressed, high-impact arrival point of\nGM III, 1; the section begins by noting a series of different\nthings that the ascetic ideal has meant, listed one after another and\nserving as a kind of outline for the Treatise, before culminating in\nthe taut aphorism:  \nThat the ascetic ideal has meant so much to man, however, is\nan expression of the basic fact of the human will, its horror\nvacui: it needs a goal,—and it would rather will\nnothingness than not will. (GM III, 1)  \n(It is to this compressed formulation, and not the entirety of the\nsection, that Nietzsche returns when he wraps up his interpretation in\nGM III, 28.) \nNietzsche’s proclivity for aphorisms is responsible for some of\nthe difficulty of his writing; these formulations stand out from their\nbackground context, making it harder to integrate Nietzsche’s\ndiscourse from one section to the next. But the aphoristic form is\nonly one challenge among many. As has been widely noted (by every\nreader, I suppose, but see Blondel [1971] 1977; Derrida 1978; de Man\n1979; Kofman [1983] 1993; Nehamas 1985; Higgins 1987, 2000; Thomas\n1999), Nietzsche’s writing is full of figures of speech and\nliterary tropes, and decoding these modes of indirection demands\nactive engagement and subtlety from the reader. Indeed, some of\nNietzsche’s most favored and widespread figures (e.g.,\nhyperbole, litotes, irony) involve purposely saying something more, or\nless, or other than one means, and so forcing the reader to adjust.\nWhat is more, Nietzsche makes heavy use of allusions to both\ncontemporary and historical writing, and without that context one is\nvery likely to miss his meaning—BGE 11–15 offers\na particularly dense set of examples; see Clark and Dudrick (2012:\n87–112) for one reading to which Hussain (2004) and Anderson\n(2002) propose alternatives. Almost as often, Nietzsche invents a\npersona so as to work out some view that he will go on to qualify or\nreject (BGE 2 is a clear example), so it can be a steep\nchallenge just to keep track of the various voices in action within\nthe text. \nNehamas (1988: 46–51) offers perhaps the best description of the\ncomplexities of the resulting reading experience: our attention is\nfixated by certain brilliant, striking passages, or even whole\nsections, but because their connections to nearby sections are not\nspecified, and because the text seems to switch from one voice to\nanother, the reader simply moves on, taking each new section on its\nown terms; in short order, one forgets the details, the points, the\ncautions, or even the subject matter of passages several sections\nback—except, perhaps, for a few, especially memorable\nhighlights, which we then call “aphorisms”. In this way,\nit is all too easy to fail to read Nietzsche’s books as\nbooks at all. Nevertheless, such comprehensive readings are there\nto be had. Clark and Dudrick (2012) offer a a sustained, albeit\ncontroversial, close reading exploring the unity of Part I of\nBeyond Good and Evil; their efforts reveal the scope of the\ndifficulty—they needed an entire book to explain the allusions\nand connections involved in just twenty-three sections of Nietzsche,\ncovering some couple-dozen pages! Attacking the same problem in a\ndifferent spirit, Nehamas (1988) calls attention to the loose,\n“train of thought”-type connections that connect one\nsection to another through large swaths of works like Beyond Good\nand Evil or The Gay Science. Following such connections,\nhe proposes, allows us to understand the books as monologues\npresented by a narrator. For Nehamas, the creation of such a narrative\npersona is central to Nietzsche’s larger project of authorial\nself-fashioning. By contrast, in a series of papers, Elijah Millgram\nhas counter-proposed that\nNietzsche deploys different “voices”, different\nnarrators, in his different books (see Millgram 2007, together with\nthe related unpublished paper available from the Other Internet\nResources). On this less unified picture, the sort of\n“persona-inhabiting” effect noted above for the obvious\ncase of BGE 2 is a much more widespread and destabilizing\nfeature of Nietzsche’s writing. It becomes a precondition for\nadequately understanding each particular book that we first work out\nin what voice Nietzsche means to be speaking—and what attitude\nhe, and we, are supposed to have toward that character—before we\ncan assess the work’s first-order claims and effects. \nWhile Millgram’s view is extreme in the demands it takes\nNietzsche’s writing to place on the reader, demands of the broad\nsort he indicates—a demand, for example, to hear\nNietzsche’s interventions in the right tone, or\n“spirit”, if they are to be understood—do\nseem to be imposed by some rather straightforward features of the\ntexts. Consider, for instance, what the point could be of that most\nobvious feature of Nietzsche’s rhetoric—the heat and\nvitriol with which his condemnations of traditional values are\npresented. The Genealogy of Morality advertises itself as\n“a Polemic”, but even in that genre, it is an outlier for\nrhetorical intensity; Nietzsche passes up no opportunity for\nemotionally charged attacks, he repeatedly blasphemes what is held\nmost sacred in the culture, he freely deploys offensive anti-Semitic\ntropes (turned back, ironically, against anti-Semitic Christians\nthemselves), he fairly shouts, he sneers between scare quotes, he\nrepeatedly charges bad faith and dishonesty on the part of his\nopponents, and on and on. It is impossible to conclude that the work\nis not deliberately designed to be as offensive as possible\nto any earnest Christian believer. Why? Given Nietzsche’s\nexpressed conviction that many Christians ought to remain ensconced\nwithin their ideology because it is the best they can do for\nthemselves (that “the sense [Sinn] of the herd should\nrule in the herd”; KSA 7[6], 12: 280), perhaps the\nright way to understand this much rhetorical overkill is that it\noperates as a strategy for audience partition. In\nNietzsche’s mind, those who cannot do without Christianity and\nits morality would only be harmed by understanding how destructive and\nself-defeating it is; Nietzsche wants to explain those terrible\neffects, but he also wants to protect Christianity-dependent readers\nfrom harm. He achieves both at once by ensuring that exactly those\nreaders will be so offended by his tone that their anger will impair\nunderstanding and they will fail to follow his argument. If this is\nright, the very vitriol of the Genealogy arises from an aim\nto be heard only by the right audience—the one it can\npotentially aid rather than harm—thereby overcoming the problem\nthat  \nThere are books that have opposite values for soul and health,\ndepending on whether the lower soul… or the higher and more\nvigorous ones turn to them. (BGE 30; compare BGE\n26–7, 40 and GS 381)  \nThat such an interpretation of Nietzsche’s intentions is even\npossible shows how great a challenge these explosive, carefully\ncrafted texts pose to their readers. \nThis entry has focused on broad themes pursued throughout\nNietzsche’s writing, but much—even\nmost—philosophically sophisticated commentary on his work has\nbeen devoted to the explication of certain core doctrinal commitments,\nwhich Nietzsche seems to rely upon throughout, but which he does not\ndevelop systematically in his published works in the way typical for\nphilosophers. Some of these doctrines, like the idea of the eternal\nrecurrence of the same, are described as “fundamental” by\nNietzsche himself (EH III; Z 1), but are formulated\nin surprisingly cryptic or metaphorical ways—and discussed, or\neven mentioned at all, much more rarely than one would expect given\nthe importance Nietzsche placed on them. Others are alluded to more\nfrequently, but raise theoretical questions that would normally call\nfor careful philosophical development that is largely absent in\nNietzsche’s books. Commentators have therefore expended\nconsiderable effort working out rational reconstructions of these\ndoctrines. This section offers brief explanations of three of the most\nimportant: the will to power, the eternal recurrence, and\nperspectivism. \nThe will to power doctrine seems to claim that everything that exists\nrests fundamentally on an underlying basis of\n“power-centers”, whose activity and interactions are\nexplained by a principle that they pursue the expansion of their\npower. But it is far from obvious what these\n“power-centers” are supposed to be, fundamentally, and\nmuch scholarly controversy concerns what kind of doctrine Nietzsche\nintended to advance, in the first place. Some readers take it as\nNietzsche’s version of a foundational metaphysics (see Heidegger\n1961, Jaspers [1936] 1965, and for a sophisticated recent approach in\nthe same broad vein, Richardson 1996). Others receive it as an\nanti-essentialist rejection of traditional metaphysical theorizing in\nwhich abstract and shifting power-centers replace stable entities\n(Nehamas 1985: 74–105, Poellner 1995: 137–98), or else as\na psychological hypothesis (Kaufmann [1950] 1974, Soll 2015; Clark and\nDudrick 2015), or a (quasi-)scientific conjecture (Schacht 1983; Abel\n1984; Anderson 1994,\n2012b). Opposing all such readings of the will to power as a doctrine\nin theoretical philosophy, Maudemarie Clark (2000, see also 1990:\n205–44) reads the will to power as a strand of thought that\nmakes no claim about the world, but instead expresses\nNietzsche’s values. As we saw (3.B.i.), the idea that the\nexpansion of power is good does have a better claim than other\nprinciples to systematize Nietzsche’s various value commitments,\nand different evaluative interpretations have been developed by\nReginster (2006), Katsafanas (2013), and Hussain (2011). But there are\nalso a large number of other texts suggesting that Nietzsche’s\nmain agenda was to argue that the psychological world—or the\nworld as a whole—is fundamentally composed of centers of power\nexerting force against one another (see GS 13; BGE\n23, 36, 259; GM II, 16–17; III, 13–15; as well as\nmany passages from the notebooks). Nietzsche’s description of\nsuch “power centers” is sometimes fairly abstract, evoking\nmathematically characterized “force-centers” like those\nsometimes postulated in nineteenth century physics, but at other\ntimes, concrete psychological or biological entities (people, drives,\norganisms) are the things exerting will to power. \nReginster’s (2006) account of the will to power as a drive\ntoward overcoming resistance can marshal a large body of textual\nsupport (particularly from the notebooks), and it also has some\nparticular philosophical advantages. From a dialectical point of view,\nReginster’s reading substantially clarifies the target and the\nphilosophical point of Nietzsche’s views about power: they are\naimed against Schopenhauer’s ideas about the will to life and\nhis use of those ideas to motivate pessimism. The will to power\nthereby contributes directly to Nietzsche’s program of\ncombatting nihilism (in its guise as the evaluative claim that the\nworld ought not to exist). Reginster’s reading also makes good\nsense of the apparent centrality of the will to power in\nNietzsche’s psychology. In the same passage where he claims that\npsychology should “be recognized again as the queen of the\nsciences”, Nietzsche proposes to understand psychology “as\nmorphology and the doctrine of the development of the will to\npower” (BGE 23). Some commentators take this to\nsuggest a monistic psychology in which all drives whatsoever aim at\npower, and so count as manifestations of a single underlying drive (or\ndrive-type). That interpretation makes a poor fit for the prodigious\ndiversity of Nietzsche’s actual psychological explanations (and\nfor his pluralist leanings), but Reginster’s view redirects\nattention away from drives’ first-order aims toward a general\nstructural feature of drives—their tendency to overcome\nresistance in the course of pursuing whatever first-order activities\nthey pursue. (It thereby builds on a productive earlier line of\nthought from Richardson (1996), according to which the drives’\nwilling power is not a matter of their taking power as a first-order\naim, but concerns the manner of their pursuit of various\nfirst-order aims.) The Reginster account thereby permits the will to\npower to retain an important centrality within Nietzsche’s\npsychology, without needing to claim that no one (or no drive) ever\naims at anything else besides power.  \nOther scholars have emphasized Nietzsche’s speculations that\nbiological and physical phenomena could be explained by a postulated\nsystem of interacting power centers (Abel 1984; Müller-Lauter\n1999a; Moore 2002; Gemes 2013). Abel (1984) offers a particularly\nsystematic and carefully argued version of the approach, which\nhighlights important resonances between Nietzsche’s ideas and\nelements of Leibniz’s dynamical physics and metaphysics, whereas\nMoore (2002) pursues a fascinating line of connections between\nNietzsche’s thoughts about power and certain physiological ideas\nadvanced by Wilhelm Roux (1881). Moore’s reading emphasizes the\nbiologized rhetoric Nietzsche often uses in his talk about power\n(together with its connections to health and sickness, degeneration,\netc.) as part of a case that the will to power idea locates\nNietzsche’s philosophy within a wider intellectual trend toward\n“biologism” prevalent at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. \nMuch of Nietzsche’s reaction to the theoretical philosophy of\nhis predecessors is mediated through his interest in the notion of\nperspective. He thought that past philosophers had largely ignored the\ninfluence of their own perspectives on their work, and had therefore\nfailed to control those perspectival effects (BGE 6; see\nBGE I more generally). Commentators have been both fascinated\nand perplexed by what has come to be called Nietzsche’s\n“perspectivism”, and it has been a major concern in a\nnumber of large-scale Nietzsche commentaries (see, e.g., Danto 1965;\nKaulbach 1980, 1990; Schacht 1983; Abel 1984; Nehamas 1985; Clark\n1990; Poellner 1995; Richardson 1996; Benne 2005). There has been as\nmuch contestation over exactly what doctrine or group of commitments\nbelong under that heading as about their philosophical merits, but a\nfew points are relatively uncontroversial and can provide a useful way\ninto this strand of Nietzsche’s thinking. \nNietzsche’s appeals to the notion of perspective (or,\nequivalently in his usage, to an “optics” of knowledge)\nhave a positive, as well as a critical side. Nietzsche frequently\ncriticizes “dogmatic” philosophers for ignoring the\nperspectival limitations on their theorizing, but as we saw, he\nsimultaneously holds that the operation of perspective makes a\npositive contribution to our cognitive endeavors: speaking of (what he\ntakes to be) the perversely counterintuitive doctrines of some past\nphilosophers, he writes, \nParticularly as knowers, let us not be ungrateful toward such resolute\nreversals of the familiar perspectives and valuations with which the\nspirit has raged against itself all too long… : to see\ndifferently in this way for once, to want to see differently,\nis no small discipline and preparation of the intellect for its future\n“objectivity”—the latter understood not as\n“disinterested contemplation” (which is a non-concept and\nabsurdity), but rather as the capacity to have one’s Pro and\nContra in one’s power, and to shift them in and out, so\nthat one knows how to make precisely the difference in\nperspectives and affective interpretations useful for knowledge.\n(GM III, 12) \nThis famous passage bluntly rejects the idea, dominant in philosophy\nat least since Plato, that knowledge essentially involves a form of\nobjectivity that penetrates behind all subjective appearances to\nreveal the way things really are, independently of any point of view\nwhatsoever. Instead, the proposal is to approach\n“objectivity” (in a revised conception) asymptotically, by\nexploiting the difference between one perspective and another, using\neach to overcome the limitations of others, without assuming that\nanything like a “view from nowhere” is so much as\npossible. There is of course an implicit criticism of the traditional\npicture of a-perspectival objectivity here, but there is equally a\npositive set of recommendations about how to pursue knowledge as a\nfinite, limited cognitive agent. \nIn working out his perspective optics of cognition, Nietzsche built on\ncontemporary developments in the theory of\ncognition—particularly the work of non-orthodox neo-Kantians\nlike Friedrich Lange and positivists like Ernst Mach, who proposed\nnaturalized, psychologically-based versions of the broad type of\ntheory of cognition initially developed by Kant and Schopenhauer (see\nClark 1990; Kaulbach 1980, 1990; Anderson 1998, 2002, 2005; Green\n2002; Hill 2003; Hussain 2004). The Kantian thought was that certain\nvery basic structural features of the world we know (space, time,\ncausal relations, etc.) were artifacts of our subjective cognitive\nfaculties rather than properties or relations of things in themselves;\nbut where Kant and Schopenhauer had treated these structures as\nnecessary, a priori conditions of any possible experience whatsoever,\nthe more naturalistically oriented figures who influenced Nietzsche\nsought to trace them to sources in human empirical psychology, which\nwould of course be contingent. The potential of these ineliminable\nsubject-side influences to vary suggests Nietzsche’s\nidea of treating them as a kind of perspective, and he does\nnot hesitate to tie these cognitively important perspectives back to\nhis own ideas about psychology. In particular, the Genealogy\npassage emphasizes that for him, perspectives are always rooted in\naffects and their associated patterns of valuation. For that\nreason, Nietzsche holds that “every great philosophy so\nfar” has been “the personal confession of its author and a\nkind of involuntary and unconscious memoir” (BGE 6).\nThus, theoretical claims not only need to be analyzed from the point\nof view of truth, but can also be diagnosed as symptoms and\nthereby traced back to the complex configurations of drive and affect\nfrom the point of view of which they make sense. Nietzsche’s\nperspectivism thus connects to his “genealogical” program\nof criticizing philosophical theories by exposing the psychological\nneeds they satisfy; perspectivism serves both to motivate the program,\nand to provide it with methodological guidance. \nBut Nietzsche’s perspectivism and his arguments for it go beyond\nepistemology, or the “theory of cognition”\n(Erkenntnistheorie), as it was practiced in the broadly\nKantian milieu of his contemporary philosophy. (One should say, they\n“go beyond” the theory of cognition at least;\nGemes (2009c, 2013) argues that epistemological interpretations of\nperspectivism are altogether mistaken, and that it should be taken\ninstead as fundamentally a doctrine within moral psychology, about the\ndrives and affects.) Nietzsche makes perspectivist claims not only\nconcerning the side of the cognitive subject, but also about the side\nof the truth, or reality, we aim to know. His views on this topic have\nbeen highly controversial, with some scholars emphasizing\nNietzsche’s apparent denials of truth (either skeptical denials\nthat any truth is ever knowable, or more radical claims that the very\nidea of truth is somehow incoherent), and others highlighting his own\nfrequent and routine claims for the truth of his own views, as well as\nthe valorization of truthfulness and honesty we saw above (3.B.iv.). A\nnumber of different strategies have been proposed for reconciling the\ntensions between these different strands of text, including the\nsupposition that at least some of Nietzsche’s own claims must\nfall outside the scope of his denials of truth (Hales and Welshon\n2000), the idea that Nietzsche distinguished different senses of\n“truth” (Schacht 1983; Anderson 1998, 2005), and the\ndevelopmental proposal that Nietzsche eventually gave up on his\ndenials of truth late in his career (Clark 1990, 1998). In addition to\nwork focused on Nietzsche’s understanding of truth per\nse, a good deal of scholarly effort has explored the way\nNietzsche attempts to build his perspectivism down into the ontology\nof the world by understanding reality itself as a system of\never-shifting force-centers which themselves constitute a variety of\npoints of view on the whole (notable contributions include Deleuze\n[1962] 1983; Abel 1984; Poellner 1995; Richardson 1996;\nMüller-Lauter 1999a; Hales and Welshon 2000; Gemes 2013). These\nefforts argue for strong connections between perspectivism and the\nwill to power doctrine\n (section 6.1). \nNietzsche himself suggests that the eternal recurrence was his most\nimportant thought, but that has not made it any easier for\ncommentators to understand. Nietzsche’s articulations of the\ndoctrine all involve hypothesizing—(or inducing the reader to\nimagine, or depicting a character considering)—the idea that all\nevents in the world repeat themselves in the same sequence through an\neternal series of cycles. But the texts are difficult to interpret.\nAll Nietzsche’s official presentations of the thought in\npublished work are either presented in hypothetical terms (GS\n341), or extremely elliptical and allusive (e.g., GS 109), or\nhighly metaphorical and quasi-hermetic (Z III, 2, 13), or all\nthree together. Most allusions to the idea, in fact, assume that one\nalready knows what it means—even the claims in Ecce\nHomo that it is the “fundamental conception” or\n“basic idea” of Zarathustra have this character.\nIn the early reception, most readers took Nietzsche to be offering a\ncosmological hypothesis about the structure of time or of fate (see\nSimmel [1907] 1920; Heidegger 1961; Löwith [1935] 1997; Jaspers [1936] 1965), and various problems have\nbeen posed for the thesis, so understood (Simmel [1907] 1920:\n250–1n; Soll 1973; Anderson 2005: 217 n28). Many later\ncommentators have focused instead on the existential or practical\nsignificance of the thought (Magnus 1978; Nehamas 1980, 1985), or its\n“mythological” import (Hatab 2005). \nIn the aftermath of Nehamas (1985), an influential line of readings\nhas argued that the thought to which Nietzsche attributed such\n“fundamental” significance was never a cosmological or\ntheoretical claim at all—whether about time, or fate, or the\nworld, or the self—but instead a practical thought\nexperiment designed to test whether one’s life has been\ngood. The broad idea is that one imagines the endless return\nof life, and one’s emotional reaction to the prospect reveals\nsomething about how valuable one’s life has been, much as\n(quoting Maudemarie Clark’s memorable analogy) a spouse’s\nquestion about whether one would marry again evokes—and indeed,\nfairly demands—an assessment of the state of the marriage (see\nClark 1990: 245–86; Wicks 1993; Ridley 1997; Williams 2001;\nReginster 2006: 201–27; Anderson 2005, 2009; Risse 2009;\nHuddleston, forthcoming, a). Naturally, the threat of emerging\nscholarly consensus around this line of interpretation has prompted\npushback, and Paul Loeb (2006, 2013) has recently offered vigorous\ndefense of a cosmological interpretation of Nietzsche’s idea,\nbuilding on earlier work by Alistair Moles (1989, 1990). \nSkeptics like Loeb are correct to insist that, if recurrence is to be\nunderstood as a practical thought experiment, commentators owe us an\naccount of how the particular features of the relevant thoughts are\nsupposed to make any difference (Soll 1973 already posed a stark form\nof this challenge). Three features seem especially salient: we are\nsupposed to imagine 1) that the past recurs, so that what has\nhappened in the past will be re-experienced in the future; 2) that\nwhat recurs is the same in every detail; and 3) that the\nrecurrence happens not just once more, or even many times more, but\neternally. The supposed recurrence (1) plausibly\nmatters as a device for overcoming the natural bias toward the future\nin practical reasoning. Since we cannot change the past but think of\nourselves as still able to do something about the future, our\npractical attention is understandably future directed. But if the\nquestion is about the value of our life overall, events in\nthe past matter just as much as those in the future, and disregarding\nthem is a mistake, at best, and a case of motivated reasoning or\ndishonesty, if we are exploiting future-bias to ignore aspects of\nourselves we would rather not own up to (General form: “Whew! At\nleast I’ll never have to go through that\nagain…”). By imaginatively locating our entire life once\nagain in the future, the thought experiment can mobilize our practical\nself-concern to direct its evaluative resources onto our life as a\nwhole. Similar considerations motivate the constraint of\nsameness (2). If my assessment of myself simply\nelided any events or features of my self, life, or world with\nwhich I was discontent, it would hardly count as an honest, thorough\nself-examination. The constraint that the life I imagine to recur must\nbe the same in every detail is designed to block any such elisions.\n \nAs Reginster (2006: 222–7) observes, it is more difficult to\nexplain the role of the third constraint, eternity. It is\nnevertheless clear that it does make a practical difference: to put a\nsharp point on it, return to Clark’s marriage analogy; one might\nwell be very happy to live one’s marriage again (once, or twice,\nor even many times), but still prefer some variation in spousal\narrangements over the course of eternity—indeed, Milan Kundera\n(1991) seems to be putting his character Agnes in something like that\nsituation in his use of the Nietzschean thought experiment early on in\nImmortality. Reginster proposes that the eternity constraint\nis meant to reinforce the idea that the thought experiment calls for\nan especially wholehearted form of\naffirmation—joy—whose strength is measured by the\ninvolvement of a wish that our essentially finite lives could be\neternal. More modestly, one might think that Nietzsche considered it\nimportant to rule out as insufficient a particular kind of\nconditional affirmation, which is suggested by the Christian\neschatological context, and which would leave in place the judgment\nthat earthly human life carries intrinsically negative value. After\nall, the devout Christian might affirm her earthly life as a test\nof faith, which is to be redeemed by an eternal heavenly reward\nshould one pass that test—all the while retaining her commitment\nthat, considered by itself, earthly life is a sinful condition to be\nrejected. Imagining that my finite life recurs eternally\nblocks this avenue (and returns the focus of assessment to the finite\nfeatures of real life) by supposing that there will never be a point\nat which one could pretend that finite life is once and for all\n“over and done with” (Anderson 2005: 198, 203; 2009:\n237–8).","contact.mail":"lanier@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
