The metaphysical\nview amounts to the claim that the world consists of a plurality of\nindependently existing things exhibiting qualities and standing in\nrelations. According to logical atomism, all truths are ultimately\ndependent upon a layer of atomic facts, which consist either of a\nsimple particular exhibiting a quality, or multiple simple particulars\nstanding in a relation. The methodological view recommends a process of\nanalysis, whereby one attempts to define or reconstruct more complex\nnotions or vocabularies in terms of simpler ones. This process often reveals\nthat what we take to be brute necessities are instead purely logical. According to Russell,\nat least early on during his logical atomist phase, such an analysis\ncould eventually result in a language containing only words\nrepresenting simple particulars, the simple properties and relations\nthereof, and logical constants, which, despite this limited vocabulary,\ncould adequately capture all truths. \n\n\n Russell’s logical atomism had a profound influence on analytic\nphilosophy in the first half of the 20th century; indeed, it is\narguable that the very name “analytic philosophy” derives from\nRussell’s defense of the method of analysis. \n\n\nBertrand Russell (1872–1970) introduced the phrase\n“logical atomism” to describe his philosophy in 1911\n(RA, 94), and used the phrase consistently throughout the\n1910s and 1920s (OKEW, 12;\nSMP, 84; PLA, 178; LA, 323; OOP,\n259).  Russell’s logical atomism is perhaps best described as partly a\nmethodological viewpoint, and partly a metaphysical theory.  \n \nMethodologically, logical atomism can be seen as endorsement of\nanalysis, understood as a two-step process in which one\nattempts to identify, for a given domain of inquiry, set of beliefs or\nscientific theory, the minimum and most basic concepts and vocabulary\nin which the other concepts and vocabulary of that domain can be\ndefined or recast, and the most general and basic principles from\nwhich the remainder of the truths of the domain can be derived or\nreconstructed.  \n \nMetaphysically, logical atomism is the view that the world consists in\na plurality of independent and discrete entities, which by coming\ntogether form facts.  According to Russell, a fact is a kind of\ncomplex, and depends for its existence on the simpler entities making\nit up. The simplest sort of complex, an atomic fact, was\nthought to consist either of a single individual exhibiting a simple\nquality, or of multiple individuals standing in a simple\nrelation.  \n The methodological and metaphysical elements of logical atomism come\ntogether in postulating the theoretical, if not the practical,\nrealizability of a fully analyzed language, in which all truths could\nin principle be expressed in a perspicuous manner. Such a “logically\nideal language”, as Russell at times called it, would, besides logical\nconstants, consist only of words representing the constituents of\natomic facts. In such a language, the simplest sort of complete\nsentence would be what Russell called an “atomic proposition”,\ncontaining a single predicate or verb representing a quality or\nrelation along with the appropriate number of proper names, each\nrepresenting an individual. The truth or falsity of an atomic\nproposition would depend entirely on a corresponding atomic fact. The\nother sentences of such a language would be derived either by\ncombining atomic propositions using truth-functional connectives,\nyielding molecular propositions, or by replacing constituents\nof a simpler proposition by variables, and prefixing a universal or\nexistential quantifier, resulting in general and\nexistential propositions. According to the stronger form of\nlogical atomism Russell at times adopted, he held that in such a\nlanguage, “[g]iven all true atomic propositions, together with the\nfact that they are all, every other true proposition can theoretically\nbe deduced by logical methods” (PM2, xv; cf. OKEW,\n50). This puts the truth or falsity of atomic propositions at the core\nof Russell’s theory of truth, and hence, puts atomic facts at the\ncenter of Russell’s metaphysics. \nRussell also at times suggests that analysis demonstrates that what we take to be essential or necessary properties of things and relations between things are the result of the logical forms the these things, properties and relations are logically constructed to have. This suggests that there are no such connections between simple entities, that all atomic propositions are independent of each other, and that all forms of necessity reduce to (formal) logical necessity. Some commentators interpret these theses to be central to Russell’s logical atomism, though explicit commitment to them is scant in his writings.\n \n \nIn what follows, various aspects of Russell’s logical atomism are\ndiscussed in greater detail. The next section discusses the origins of\nlogical atomism in the break made by Russell and G.E. Moore from the\ntradition of British Idealism, and its development during the years in\nwhich Russell worked on Principia Mathematica. In section 3,\nwe examine Russell’s notion of analysis as a philosophical method, and\ngive various examples of analysis as Russell understood it. In section\n4, we turn to a more detailed look at certain metaphysical aspects of\nRussell’s atomism, and in particular, the nature and classification of\nfacts, as well certain points of controversy regarding his views. In\nparticular, we’ll examine whether or not Russell’s logical\natomism necessarily presupposes a fundamental realm of ultimate\nsimples, and whether or not the atomic propositions of Russell’s\natomism were understood as logically independent. The final section is\ndedicated to a discussion of the influence and reception of Russell’s\nlogical atomism within the subsequent philosophical tradition. \n In 1959, Russell himself dated his first acceptance of logical\natomism to the years 1899–1900, when he and G.E. Moore rejected the\nmain tenets of the dominant school of philosophy in Britain at the\ntime (to which both had previously been adherents), the tradition of\nneo-Hegelian Idealism exemplified in works of F.H. Bradley and J.M.E.\nMcTaggart, and adopted instead a fairly strong form of realism\n(MPD,  9). Of their break with idealism, Russell wrote that\n“Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his footsteps”\n(MPD, 42).  \n \nIn 1899, Moore published a paper entitled “The Nature of Judgment”, in\nwhich he outlined his main reasons for accepting the new realism.  It\nbegins with a discussion of a distinction made by Bradley between\ndifferent notions of idea. According to Bradley, the notion of idea\nunderstood as a mental state or mental occurrence is not the notion of\n“idea” relevant to logic or to truth understood as a relationship\nbetween our ideas and reality. Instead, the relevant notion of idea is\nthat of a sign or symbol representing something other than itself, or\nan idea understood as possessing meaning. Bradley understood meaning\nin terms of “a part of the content … [of an idea] cut off,\nfixed by the mind, and considered apart from the existence of the\nsign” (Bradley 1883, 8). Moore agreed with Bradley that it is not\nthe mental occurrence that is important to logic.  However, with\nregard to Bradley’s second notion of “idea”, Moore accused Bradley of\nconflating the symbol with the symbolized, and rejected Bradley’s view\nthat what is symbolized is itself a part of the idea and dependent\nupon it. Moore introduces the term “concept” for the meaning of a\nsymbol; for Moore, what it is for different ideas to have a common\ncontent is for them to represent the same concept. However, the\nconcept itself is independent of the ideas. When we make a judgment,\ntypically, it is not our ideas, or parts of our ideas, which our\njudgment is about. According to Moore, if I make an assertion, what I\nassert is nothing about my ideas or my mental states, but a certain\n“connexion of concepts”.  \n Moore went on to introduce the term “proposition” for complexes of\nconcepts such as that which would be involved in a belief or judgment.\nWhile propositions represent the content of judgments, according to\nMoore, they and their constituents are entirely independent from the\njudging mind. Some propositions are true, some are not. For Moore,\nhowever, truth is not a correspondence relationship between\npropositions and reality, as there is no difference between a\nproposition—understood as a mind-independent complex—and that which\nwould make it true (Moore 1899, 5; Moore 1901). The facts of the\nworld then consist of true propositions, themselves understood as\ncomplexes of concepts. According to Moore, something “becomes\nintelligible first when it is analyzed into its constituent concepts”\n(Moore 1899, 8). “The Nature of Judgment” had a profound influence\non Russell, who later heralded it as the first account of the “new\nphilosophy” to which he and Moore subscribed (MPD, 42). \n \nFor his own part, Russell often described his dissatisfaction with the\ndominant Idealist (and largely Monist) tradition as primarily having\nto do with the nature and existence of relations. In particular,\nRussell took issue with the claim found in Bradley and others, that\nthe notion of a fundamental relation between two distinct entities is\nincoherent. Russell diagnosed this belief as stemming from a\nwidespread logical doctrine to the effect that every proposition is\nlogically of subject-predicate form. Russell was an ardent opponent of\na position known as the “doctrine of internal relations”, which\nRussell stated as the view that “every relation is grounded in the\nnatures of the related terms” (MTT, 139).  Perhaps most\ncharitably interpreted (for other interpretations considered by\nRussell, see BReal, 87), this amounts to the claim that\na’s bearing relation R to b is always\nreducible to properties held by a and b\nindividually, or to a property held by the complex formed of\na and b. \n \nIn the period leading up to his own abandonment of idealism, Russell\nwas already pursuing a research program involving the foundations of\narithmetic (see, e.g., AMR). This work, along with his\nearlier work on the foundations of geometry (see EFG), had\nconvinced him of the importance of relations for mathematics. However,\nhe found that one category of relations, viz., asymmetrical transitive\nrelations, resisted any such reduction to the properties of the relata\nor the whole formed of them. These relations are especially important\nin mathematics, as they are the sort that generates series. Consider\nthe relation of being taller than, and consider the fact that\nShaquille O’Neal is taller than Michael Jordan. It might be thought\nthat this relation between O’Neal and Jordan can be reduced to\nproperties of each: O’Neal has the property of being 7′2″ tall, and\nJordan has the property of being 6′6″ tall, and the taller\nthan relation in this case is reducible to their possession of\nthese properties. The problem, according to Russell, is that for this\nreduction to hold, there must be a certain relation between the\nproperties themselves. This relation would account for the ordering of\nthe various height properties, putting the property of being-6′8″-tall\nin between that of being-7′2″-tall and that of being-6′6″-tall. This\nrelation among the properties would itself be an asymmetrical and\ntransitive relation, and so the analysis has not rid us of the need\nfor taking relations as ultimate. Another hypothesis would be that\nthere is such an entity as the whole composed of O’Neal and Jordan,\nand that the relation between the two men is reducible to some\nproperty of this whole.  Russell’s complaint was that since the whole\ncomposed of O’Neal and Jordan is the same as the whole composed of\nJordan and O’Neal, this approach has no way to explain what the\ndifference would be between O’Neal’s being taller than Jordan and Jordan’s\nbeing taller than O’Neal, as both would seem to be reduced to the same\ncomposite entity bearing the same quality (see POM,\n221–26). \n \nRussell’s rejection of the doctrine of internal relations is very\nimportant for understanding the development of his atomistic doctrines\nin more than one respect. Certain advocates of the claim that a\nrelation must always be grounded in the “nature” of its relata hold\nthat in virtue of a relating to b, a must\nhave a complex nature that includes its relatedness to\nb. Since every entity presumably bears some relation to any\nother, the “nature” of any entity could arguably be described as\nhaving the same complexity as the universe as a whole (if indeed, it\neven makes sense on such a picture to divide the world into distinct\nentities at all, as many denied).  Moreover, according to some within\nthis tradition, when we consider a, obviously we do not\nconsider all its relations to every entity, and hence grasp a\nin a way that falsifies the whole of what a is. This led\nsome to the claim that “analysis is falsification”, and even to hold\nthat when we judge that a is the father of b, and\njudge that a is the son of c, the a in the\nfirst judgment is not strictly speaking the same a as\ninvolved in the second judgment; instead, in the first we deal only\nwith a-quâ-father-of-b in the first, and\na-quâ-son-of-c in the second\n(cf. BReal, 89; MTT, 140).  \nIn contradistinction to these views, Russell adopted what he called\n“the doctrine of external relations”, which he claimed “may be\nexpressed by saying that (1) relatedness does not imply any\ncorresponding complexity in the relata; (2) any given entity\nis a constituent of many different complexes” (BReal,\n87). This position on relations allowed Russell to adopt a pluralist\nphilosophy in which the world is conceived as composed of many\ndistinct, independent entities, each of which can be considered in\nisolation from its relations to other things, or its relation to the\nmind. In 1911 Russell claimed that this doctrine was the “fundamental\ndoctrine” of his realistic position (BReal, 87;\ncf. RA, 92; POM, 226), and it represents perhaps the\nmost important turning point in the development of his logical\natomism. \nRussell’s first published account of his newfound realism came in the\n1903 classic The Principles of Mathematics (POM).\nPart I of POM is dedicated largely to a philosophical inquiry\ninto the nature of propositions. Russell took over from Moore the\nconception of propositions as mind-independent complexes; a true\nproposition was then simply identified by Russell with a fact\n(cf. MTCA, 75–76). However, Moore’s characterization of a\nproposition as a complex of concepts was largely in keeping\nwith traditional Aristotelian logic in which all judgments were\nthought to involve a subject concept, copula and predicate\nconcept.  Russell, owing in part to his own views on\nrelations, and in part from his adopting certain doctrines stemming\nfrom Peano’s symbolic logic, sought to refine and improve upon this\ncharacterization.  \n \nIn the terminology introduced in POM, constituents of a\nproposition occur either “as term” or “as\nconcept”.  An entity occurs “as term” when it can be\nreplaced by any other entity and the result would still be a\nproposition, and when it is one of the subjects of the proposition,\ni.e., something the proposition is “about”. An entity\noccurs as concept when it occurs predicatively, i.e., only as\npart of the assertion made about the things occurring as term. In the\nproposition Socrates is human, the person Socrates (the man\nhimself) occurs as term, but humanity occurs as concept. In the\nproposition Callisto orbits Jupiter, Callisto (the moon\nitself) and Jupiter (the planet) occur as term, and the relation of\norbiting occurs as concept. Russell used the word\n“concept” for all those entities capable of occurring as\nconcept—chiefly relations and other universals—and the\nword “thing” for those entities such as Socrates, Callisto\nand Jupiter, that can only occur as term. While Russell thought that\nonly certain entities were capable of occurring as concept, at the\ntime, he believed that every entity was capable of occurring as term\nin a proposition. In the proposition Wisdom is a virtue, the\nconcept wisdom occurs as term. His argument that this held generally\nwas that if there were some entity, E, that could not occur\nas term, there would have to be a fact, i.e., a true proposition, to\nthis effect.  However, in the proposition E cannot occur as term\nin a proposition, E occurs as term (POM,\n44–45). \n \nRussell’s 1903 account of propositions as complexes of entities was in\nmany ways in keeping with his views as the nature of complexes and\nfacts during the core logical atomist period of 1911–1925. In\nparticular, at both stages he would regard the simple truth that an\nindividual a stands in the simple relation R to an\nindividual b as a complex consisting of the individuals\na and b and the relation R. However, there\nare a number of positions Russell held in 1903 that were abandoned in\nthis later period; some of the more important were these: (1) in 1903,\nRussell was committed to a special kind of propositional constituent\ncalled a “denoting concept”, involved in descriptive and quantified\npropositions; (2) in 1903, Russell believed that there was such a\ncomplex, i.e., a proposition, consisting of a, b and\nR even when it is not true\nthat a bears relation R to b, and\n(3) in 1903, Russell believed in the reality of classes, understood as\naggregate objects, which could be constituents of propositions. In\neach case, it is worth, at least briefly, discussing Russell’s change\nof heart. \n In POM, Russell expressed the view that grammar is a useful\nguide in understanding the make-up of a proposition, and even that in\nmany cases, the make-up of a proposition corresponding to a sentence\ncan be understood by determining, for each word of the sentence, what\nentity in the proposition is meant by the word (POM,\n46). Perhaps in part because such phrases as “all dogs”, “some\nnumbers” and “the queen” appear as a grammatical unit, Russell came to\nthe conclusion that they made a unified contribution to the\ncorresponding proposition.  Because Russell believed it impossible for\na finite mind to grasp a proposition of infinite complexity, however,\nRussell rejected a view according to which the (false) proposition\ndesignated by \n \nactually contains all numbers (POM, 145). Similarly,\nalthough Russell admitted that such a proposition as (1) is equivalent\nto a formal implication, i.e., a quantified conditional of the\nform: \n \nRussell held that they are nevertheless distinct propositions\n(POM,  74). This was perhaps in part due to the difference\nin grammatical structure, and perhaps also because the former appears\nonly to be about numbers, whereas the latter is about all things,\nwhether numbers or not. Instead, Russell thought that the proposition\ncorresponding to (1) contains as a constituent the denoting concept\nall numbers. As Russell explained them, when denoting concepts \noccur in a proposition, the proposition is not about them but about \nother entities to which the denoting concepts bear a special\nrelation. So when the denoting concept all numbers occurs in\na proposition, the proposition is not about the denoting concept, but\ninstead about 1 and 2 and 3, etc. \n \nIn 1905, Russell abandoned this theory in favor of his celebrated\ntheory of definite and indefinite descriptions outlined in the paper\n“On Denoting”. What precisely lead Russell to become dissatisfied with\nhis earlier theory, and the precise nature of the argument he gave\nagainst denoting concepts (and similar entities such as Frege’s\nsenses), are a matter of great controversy, and have given rise to\na large body of secondary literature.  For present purposes, it can\nmerely be noted that Russell professed an inability to understand the\nlogical form of propositions about denoting concepts\nthemselves, as in the claim that “The present King of France\nis a denoting concept” (cf. OD, 48–50). According to the\nnew theory adopted, the proposition expressed by (1) was now\nidentified with that expressed by a quantified conditional such as\n(2). Similarly, the proposition expressed by \n \nwas identified with the existentially quantified conjunction\nrepresented by \n \nPerhaps most notoriously, Russell argued that a proposition involving\na definite description, e.g.,\n \n \nwas to be understood as having the structure of a certain kind of\nexistential statement, in this case: \n \nRussell cited in favor of these theories that they provided an elegant\nsolution to certain philosophical puzzles. One involves how it is that\na proposition can be meaningful even if it involves a description or\nother denoting phrase that does not denote anything. Given the above\naccount of the structure of the proposition expressed by “the King of\nFrance is bald”, while France and the relation of being King\nof are constituents, there is no constituent directly\ncorresponding to the whole phrase “the King of France”. The proposition in\nquestion is false, since there is no value of x which would\nmake it true. One is not committed to a nonexistent entity such as the\nKing of France simply in order to understand the make-up of the\nproposition.  Secondly, this theory provides an answer to how it is\nthat certain identity statements can be both true and informative. On\nthe above theory, the proposition corresponding to: \n \nwould be understood as having the following structure: \n \nIf instead, the proposition corresponding to (7) was simply a complex\nconsisting of the relation of identity, Scott, and the author of\nWaverly himself, since the author of Waverly simply is Scott,\nthe proposition would be the same as the uninformative proposition\nScott = Scott. By showing that the actual structure of the\nproposition is quite a bit different from what it appears from the\ngrammar of the sentence “The author of Waverly = Scott”, Russell\nbelieved he had shown how it might be more informative than a trivial\ninstance of the law of identity (OD, 51–54). \n \nThe theory of “On Denoting” did away with Russell’s temptation to\nregard grammar as a very reliable guide towards understanding the\nstructure or make-up of a proposition. Especially important in this\nregard is the notion of an “incomplete symbol”, by which Russell\nunderstood an expression that can be meaningful in the context of its\nuse within a sentence, but does not by itself correspond to a\nconstituent or unified part of the corresponding\nproposition. According to the theory of “On Denoting”, phrases such as\n“the King of France”, or “the author of Waverly” were to be understood\nas “incomplete symbols” in this sense. The general notion of an\n“incomplete symbol” was applied by Russell in ways beyond the theory\nof descriptions, and perhaps most importantly, to his understanding of\nclasses. \n \nIn POM, Russell had postulated two types of composite\nentities: unities and aggregates (POM,\n140f). By a “unity” he meant a complex entity in which the constituent\nparts are arranged with a definite structure. A proposition was\nunderstood to be a unity in this sense.  By an “aggregate”, he meant\nan entity such as a class whose identity conditions are governed\nentirely by what members or “parts” it has, and not by any\nrelationships between the parts. By the time of the publication of the\nfirst edition of Principia Mathematica in 1910, Russell’s\nviews about both types of composite entities had changed drastically.\n \nRussell fundamentally conceived of a class as the extension of a\nconcept, or as the extension of a propositional function; indeed, in\nPOM he claims that “a class may be defined as all\nthe terms satisfying some propositional function” (POM,\n20). However, Russell was aware already at the time of POM\nthat the supposition there is always a class, understood as an\nindividual entity, as the extension of every propositional function,\nleads to certain logical paradoxes. Perhaps the most famous, now\ncalled “Russell’s paradox”, derived from consideration of the class,\nw, of all classes not members of themselves. The class\nw would be a member of itself if it satisfied its defining\ncondition, i.e., if it were not a member of itself. Similarly,\nw would not be a member of itself if it did not satisfy its\ndefining condition, i.e., if it were a member of itself.  Hence, both\nthe assumption that it is a member of itself, and the assumption that\nit is not, are impossible. Another related paradox Russell often\ndiscussed in this regard has since come to be called “Cantor’s\nparadox”. Cantor had proven that if a class had n members,\nthat the number of sub-classes that can be taken from that class is\n2n, and also that 2n >\nn, even when n is infinite. It follows from this\nthat the number of subclasses of the class of all individuals, (i.e.,\nthe number of different classes of individuals) is greater than the\nnumber of individuals.  Russell took this as strong evidence that a\nclass of individuals could not itself be considered an\nindividual. Likewise, the number of subclasses of the class of all\nclasses is greater than the number of members in the class of all\nclasses. This Russell took to be evidence that there is some ambiguity\nin the notion of a “class” so that the subclasses of the class of “all\nclasses” would not themselves be among its members, as it would\nseem. \n \nRussell spent the years between 1902 and 1910 searching for a\nphilosophically motivated solution to such paradoxes. He tried\nsolutions of various sorts.  However, in late 1905, after the\ndiscovery of the theory of descriptions, he became convinced that an\nexpression for a class is an “incomplete symbol”, i.e., that while\nsuch an expression can occur as part of a meaningful sentence, it\nshould not be regarded as representing a single entity in the\ncorresponding proposition. Russell dubbed this approach the “no\nclasses” theory of classes (see e.g., TNOT, 145), because,\nwhile it allows discourse about classes to be meaningful, it does not\nposit classes as among the fundamental ontological furniture of the\nworld.  The precise nature of Russell’s “no classes” theory underwent\nsignificant changes between 1905 and 1910. However, in the version\nadopted in the first edition of Principia Mathematica,\nRussell believed that a statement apparently about a class could\nalways be reconstructed, using higher-order quantification, in terms\nof a statement involving its defining propositional function. Russell\nbelieved that whenever a class term of the form\n“{z|ψz}” appeared in some sentence, the sentence\nas a whole could be regarded as defined as follows (cf. PM,\n188): \n \nThe above view can be paraphrased, somewhat crudely, as the claim that\nany truth seemingly about a class can be reduced to a claim about some\nor all of its members. For example, it follows from this contextual\ndefinition of class terms that the statement to the effect that one\nclass A is a subset of another class B is equivalent\nto the claim that whatever satisfies the defining propositional\nfunction of A also satisfies the defining propositional\nfunction of B. Russell also sometimes described this as the\nview that classes are “logical constructions”, not part of the “real\nworld”, but only the world of logic. Another way Russell expressed\nhimself is by saying that a class is a “logical fiction”.  While it\nmay seem that a class term is representative of an entity, according\nto Russell, class terms are meaningful in a different way.  Classes\nare not among the basic stuff of the world; yet it is possible to make\nuse of class terms in significant speech, as if there were\nsuch things as classes. A class is thus portrayed by Russell as a mere\nfaçon de parler, or convenient way of speaking about\nall or some of the entities satisfying some propositional\nfunction. \n \nDuring the period in which Russell was working on Principia\nMathematica, most likely in 1907, Russell also radically revised\nhis former realism about propositions understood as mind independent\ncomplexes. The motivations for the change are a matter of some\ncontroversy, but there are at least two possible sources. The first is\nthat in addition to the logical paradoxes concerning the existence of\nclasses, Russell was aware of certain paradoxes stemming from the\nassumption that propositions could be understood as individual\nentities. One such paradox was discussed already in Appendix B of\nPOM (527–28). By Cantor’s theorem, there must be more classes\nof propositions than propositions.  However, for every class of\npropositions, m, it is possible to generate a distinct\nproposition, such as the proposition that every proposition in m\nis true, in violation of Cantor’s theorem. Unlike the other\nparadoxes mentioned above, a version of this paradox can be\nreformulated even if talk of classes is replaced by talk of their\ndefining propositional functions.  Russell was also aware of certain\ncontingent paradoxes involving propositions, such as the Liar paradox\nformulated involving a person S, whose only assertion at time\nt is the proposition All propositions asserted by S at\ntime t are false. Given the success of the rejection of classes\nas ultimate entities in resolving the paradoxes of classes, Russell\nwas motivated to see if a similar solution to these paradoxes could be\nhad by rejecting propositions as singular entities. \n \nAnother set of considerations pushing Russell towards the rejection of\nhis former view of propositions is more straightforwardly\nmetaphysical.  According to his earlier view, and that of Moore, a\nproposition was understood as a mind independent complex. The\nconstituents of the complex are the actual entities involved, and\nhence, as we have seen, when a proposition is true, it is the same\nentity as a fact or state of affairs. However, because some\npropositions are false, this view of propositions posits objective\nfalsehoods. The false proposition that Venus orbits Neptune\nis thought to be a complex containing Venus and Neptune the planets,\nas well as the relation of orbiting, with the relation occurring as a\nrelation, i.e., as relating Venus to Neptune. However, it\nseems natural to suppose that the relation of orbiting could only\nunite Venus and Neptune into a complex, if in fact, Venus orbits\nNeptune. Hence, the presence of such objective falsehoods is itself\nout of sorts with common sense. Worse, as Russell explained, positing\nthe existence of objective falsehoods in addition to objective truths\nmakes the difference between “truth” and\n“falsehood” inexplicable, as both become irreducible\nproperties of propositions, and we are left without an explanation for\nthe privileged metaphysical status of truth over falsehood (see, e.g.,\nNTF, 152). \n \nWhatever his primary motivation, Russell abandoned any commitment to\nobjective falsehoods, and restructured his ontology of facts, and\nadopted a new correspondence theory of truth. In the terminology of\nthe new theory, the word “proposition” was used not for an objective\nmetaphysical complex, but simply for an interpreted declarative\nsentence, an item of language.  Propositions are thought to be true or\nfalse depending on their correspondence, or lack thereof, with\nfacts.  \n \nIn the Introduction to Principia Mathematica, as part of his\nexplanation of ramified type-theory, Russell described various notions\nof truth applicable to different types of propositions of different\ncomplexity. The simplest propositions in the language of Principia\nMathematica are what Russell there called “elementary\npropositions”, which take forms such as “a has quality\nq”, “a has relation [in intension] R to\nb”, or “a and b and c stand in\nrelation S” (PM, 43–44). Such propositions\nconsist of a simple predicate, representing either a quality or a\nrelation, and a number of proper names. According to Russell, such a\nproposition is true when there is a corresponding fact or complex,\ncomposed of the entities named by the predicate and proper names\nrelated to each other in the appropriate way. E.g., the proposition\n“a has relation R to b” is true if there\nexists a corresponding complex in which the entity a is\nrelated by the relation R to the entity b. If there\nis no corresponding complex, then the proposition is false. \n \nRussell dubbed the notion of truth applicable to elementary\npropositions “first truth”. This notion of truth serves as\nthe ground for a hierarchy of different notions of truth applicable to\ndifferent types of propositions depending on their complexity. A\nproposition such as “(x)(x has\nquality q)” which involves a first-order quantifier,\nhas (or lacks) “second truth” depending on whether its\ninstances have “first truth”. In this case,\n“(x)(x has quality q)” would be\ntrue if every proposition got by replacing the\n“x” in “x has\nquality q” with the proper name of an individual has\n“first truth” (PM, 42). A proposition involving\nthe simplest kind of second-order quantifier, i.e., a quantifier using\na variable for “predicative” propositional functions of\nthe lowest type, would have or lack “third truth”\ndepending on whether its allowable substitution instances have second\n(or lower) truth.  Because any statement apparently about a class of\nindividuals involves this sort of higher-order quantification, the\ntruth or falsity of such a proposition will ultimately depend on the\ntruth or falsity of various elementary propositions about its\nmembers.  \n \nAlthough Russell did not use the phrase “logical atomism” in the\nIntroduction to Principia Mathematica, in many ways it\nrepresents the first work of Russell’s atomist period. Russell there\nexplicitly endorsed the view that the “universe consists of objects\nhaving various qualities and standing in various relations”\n(PM, 43).  Propositions that assert that an object has a\nquality, or that multiple objects stand in a certain relation, were\ngiven a privileged place in the theory, and explanation was given as\nto how more complicated truths, including truths about classes, depend\non the truth of such simple propositions. Russell’s work over the next\ntwo decades consisted largely in refining and expanding upon this\npicture of the world. \n Although Russell changed his mind on a great number of philosophical\nissues throughout his career, one of the most stable elements in his\nviews is the endorsement of a certain methodology for approaching\nphilosophy. Indeed, it could be argued to be the most continuous and\nunifying feature of Russell’s philosophical work (e.g., see Hager\n1994).  Russell employed the methodology self-consciously, and gave\nonly slightly differing descriptions of this methodology in works\nthroughout his career (see, esp., EFG,\n14–15; POM, 1–2, 129–30; RMDP,\n272–74; PM, 59; IPL,\n284–85; TK, 33, 158–59; OKEW,\n144–45; PLA, 178–82, 270–71; IMP,\n1–2; LA, 324–36, 341;\nRTC, 687; HWP, 788–89; HK, 257–59;\nMPD, 98–99, 162–163). Understanding this methodology is\nparticularly important for understanding his logical atomism, as well\nas what he meant by “analysis”. \n The methodology consists of a two phase process. The first phase is\ndubbed the “analytic” phase (although it should be noted that\nsometimes Russell used the word “analysis” for the whole\nprocedure). One begins with a certain theory, doctrine or collection\nof beliefs which is taken to be more or less correct, but is taken to\nbe in certain regards vague, imprecise, disunified, overly complex or\nin some other way confused or puzzling. The aim in the first phase is\nto work backwards from these beliefs, taken as a kind of “data”, to a\ncertain minimal stock of undefined concepts and general principles\nwhich might be thought to underlie the original body of knowledge. The\nsecond phase, which Russell described as the “constructive” or\n“synthetic” phase, consists in rebuilding or reconstructing the\noriginal body of knowledge in terms of the results of the first phase.\nMore specifically, in the synthetic phase, one defines those elements\nof the original conceptual framework and vocabulary of the discipline\nin terms of the “minimum vocabulary” identified in the first phrase,\nand derives or deduces the main tenets of the original theory from the\nbasic principles or general truths one arrives at after analysis.  \n \nAs a result of such a process, the system of beliefs with which one\nbegan takes on a new form in which connections between various\nconcepts it uses are made clear, the logical interrelations between\nvarious theses of the theory are clarified, and vague or unclear\naspects of the original terminology are eliminated.  Moreover, the\nprocedure also provides opportunities for the application of Occam’s\nrazor, as it calls for the elimination of unnecessary or redundant\naspects of a theory. Concepts or assumptions giving rise to paradoxes\nor conundrums or other problems within a theory are often found to be\nwholly unnecessary or capable of being supplanted by something less\nproblematic.  Another advantage is that the procedure arranges its\nresults as a deductive system, and hence invites and facilitates the\ndiscovery of new results.\n \n \nExamples of this general procedure can be found throughout Russell’s\nwritings, and Russell also credits others with having achieved similar\nsuccesses.  Russell’s work in mathematical logic provides perhaps the\nmost obvious example of his utilization of such a procedure. It is\nalso an excellent example of Russell’s contention that analysis\nproceeds in stages. Russell saw his own work as the next step in a\nseries of successes beginning with the work of Cantor, Dedekind and\nWeierstrass. Prior to the work of these figures, mathematics employed\na number of concepts, number, magnitude, series,\nlimit, infinity, function, continuity, etc.,\nwithout a full understanding of the precise definition of each\nconcept, nor how they related to one another. By introducing precise\ndefinitions of such notions, these thinkers exposed ambiguities (e.g.,\nsuch as with the word “infinite”), revealed interrelations between\ncertain of them, and eliminated dubious notions that had previously\ncaused confusion and paradoxes (such as those involved with the notion\nof an “infinitesimal”). Russell saw the next step forward in the\nanalysis of mathematics in the work of Peano and his associates, who\nnot only attempted to explain how many mathematical notions could be\n“arithmetized”, i.e., defined and proven in terms of arithmetic, but\nhad also identified, in the case of arithmetic, three basic concepts\n(zero, successor, and natural number) and\nfive basic principles (the so-called “Peano axioms”), from which the\nrest of arithmetic was thought to be derivable. \n \nRussell described the next advance as taking place in the work of\nFrege. According to the conception of number found in Frege’s\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik, a number can be regarded as an\nequivalence class consisting of those classes whose members can be put\nin 1-1 correspondence with any other member of the class. According to\nRussell, this conception allowed the primitives of Peano’s analysis to\nbe defined fully in terms of the notion of a class, along with other\nlogical notions such as identity, quantification, negation and the\nconditional. Similarly, Frege’s work showed how the basic principles\nof Peano’s analysis could be derived from logical axioms\nalone. However, Frege’s analysis was not in all ways successful, as\nthe notion of a class or the extension of a concept which Frege\nincluded as a logically primitive notion lead to certain\ncontradictions. In this regard, Russell saw his own analysis of\nmathematics (largely developed independently from Frege) as an\nimprovement, with its more austere analysis that eliminates even the\nnotion of a class as a primitive idea (see the discussion of classes\nin Section 2.4 above), and thereby eliminates the contradictions (see,\ne.g., RMDP, 276–81; LA, 325–27). \n \nIt was clearly a part of Russell’s view that in conducting an\nanalysis of a domain such as mathematics, and reducing its primitive\nconceptual apparatus and unproven premises to a minimum, one is not\nmerely reducing the vocabulary of a certain theory, but also showing a\nway of reducing the metaphysical commitments of the theory. In first\nshowing that numbers such as 1, 2, etc., could be defined in terms of\nclasses of like cardinality, and then showing how apparent discourse\nabout “classes” could be replaced by higher-order\nquantification, Russell made it possible to see how it is that there\ncould be truths of arithmetic without presupposing that the numbers\nconstitute a special category of abstract entity. Numbers are placed\nin the category of “logical fictions” or “logical\nconstructions” along with all other classes. \n \nRussell’s work from the period after the publication of Principia\nMathematica of 1910 shows applications of this general\nphilosophical approach to non-mathematical domains. In particular, his\nwork over the next two decades shows concern with the attempt to provide\nanalyses of the notions of knowledge, space, time, experience, matter\nand causation. When Russell applied his analytic methodology to\nsciences such as physics, again the goal was to arrive at a\n“minimum vocabulary” required for the science in question,\nas well as a set of basic premises and general truths from which the\nrest of the science can be derived. We cannot delve into all the\ndetails of Russell’s evolving analyses here. However, according to the\nviews developed by Russell in the mid-1910s, many of the fundamental\nnotions in physics were thought to be analyzable in terms of\nparticular sensations: i.e., bits of color, auditory notes, or other\nsimple parts of sensation, and their qualities and relations. Russell\ncalled such sensations, when actually experienced,\n“sense”. In particular, Russell believed that the notion\nof a “physical thing” could be replaced, or analyzed in\nterms of, the notion of a series of classes of sensible particulars\neach bearing to one another certain relations of continuity,\nresemblance, and perhaps certain other relations relevant to the\nformulation of the laws of physics (OKEW, 86ff;\nRSDP, 114–15; UCM, 105). Other physical\nnotions such as that of a point of space, or an instance of time,\ncould be conceived in terms of classes of sensible particulars and\ntheir spatial and temporal relations (see TK,\n77; OKEW, 91–99). Later, after abandoning the view that\nperception is fundamentally relational, and accepting a form of\nWilliam James’s neutral monism, Russell similarly came to believe that\nthe notion of a conscious mind could be analyzed in terms of various\npercepts, experiences and sensations related to each other by\npsychological laws (AMi chaps. 1, 5; OOP chap.  26;\ncf. PLA, 277ff). Hence, Russell came to the view that words\nas “point”, “matter”,“instant”,\n“mind”, and the like could be discarded from the minimum\nvocabulary needed for physics or psychology. Instead, such words could\nbe systematically translated into a language only containing words\nrepresenting certain qualities and relations between sensible\nparticulars. \n \nThroughout these analyses, Russell put into practice a slogan he\nstated as follows: “Wherever possible, logical constructions are\nto be substituted for inferred entities” (RSDP, 115;\ncf. LA, 326). Rival philosophies that postulate an\nego or mind as an entity distinct from its mental\nstates involve inferring the existence of an entity that cannot\ndirectly be found in experience. Something similar can be said about\nphilosophies that take matter to be an entity distinct from sensible\nappearances, lying behind them and inferred from them. Combining\nRussell’s suggestions that talk of “minds” or “physical objects” is to\nbe analyzed in terms of classes of sensible particulars with his\ngeneral view that classes are “logical fictions”, results in the view\nthat minds and physical objects too are “logical fictions”, or not\nparts of the basic building blocks of reality. Instead, all truths\nabout such purported entities turn out instead to be analyzable as\ntruths about sensible particulars and their relations to one\nanother. This is in keeping with the general metaphysical outlook of\nlogical atomism. We also have here a fairly severe application of\nOccam’s razor. The slogan was applied within his analyses in\nmathematics as well. Noting that sometimes a series of rational\nnumbers converges towards a limit which is not itself specifiable as a\nrational, some philosophers of mathematics thought that one should\npostulate an irrational number as a limit. Russell claimed\nthat rather than postulating entities in such a case, an\nirrational number should simply be defined as a class of\nrational numbers without a rational upper bound. Russell preferred to\nreconstruct talk of irrationals this way rather than infer or\npostulate the existence of a new species of mathematical\nentity not already known to exist, complaining that the method of\n“postulating” what we want has “the advantages of theft over honest\ntoil” (IMP, 71). \n \nIn conducting an analysis of mathematics, or indeed, of any other\ndomain of thought, Russell was clear that although the results of\nanalysis can be regarded as logical premises from which the\noriginal body of knowledge can in principle be derived,\nepistemologically speaking, the pre-analyzed beliefs are more\nfundamental. For example, in mathematics, a belief such as “2 + 2 = 4”\nis epistemologically more certain, and psychologically easier to\nunderstand and accept, than many of the logical premises from which it\nis derived. Indeed, Russell believed that the results obtained through\nthe process of analysis obtain their epistemic warrant inductively\nfrom the evident truth of their logical consequences (see, e.g.,\nTK, 158–59). As Russell put it, “[t]he reason for\naccepting an axiom, as for accepting any other proposition, is always\nlargely inductive, namely that many propositions which are nearly\nindubitable can be deduced from it, and that no equally plausible way\nis known by which these propositions could be true if the axiom were\nfalse, and nothing which is plausibly false can be deduced from it”\n(PM, 59; cf. RMDP, 282). It is perhaps for these\nreasons that Russell believed that the process of philosophical\nanalysis should always begin with beliefs the truth of which are not\nin question, i.e., which are “nearly indubitable”.  \n \nWhen Russell spoke about the general philosophical methodology\ndescribed here, he usually had in mind applying the process of\nanalysis to an entire body of knowledge or set of data. In fact,\nRussell advocated usually to begin with the uncontroversial doctrine\nof a certain science, such as mathematics or physics, largely because\nhe held that these theories are the most likely to be true, or at\nleast nearly true, and hence make the most appropriate place to begin\nthe process of analysis.  \n \nRussell did on occasion also speak of analyzing a particular\nproposition of ordinary life. One example he gave is “There are a\nnumber of people in this room at this moment” (PLA, 179). In\nthis case, the truth or falsity of this statement may seem obvious,\nbut exactly what its truth would involve is rather obscure. The\nprocess of analysis in this case would consist in attempting to make\nthe proposition clear by defining what it is for something to be a\nroom, for something to be a person, for a person to be in a room, what\na moment is, etc. In this case, it might seem that the ordinary\nlanguage statement is sufficiently vague that there is likely no\none precise or unambiguous proposition that represents the\n“correct analysis” of the proposition. In a sense this is right;\nhowever, this does not mean that analysis would be worthless. Russell\nwas explicit that the goal of analysis is not to unpack what is\npsychologically intended by an ordinary statement such as the previous\nexample, nor what a person would be thinking when he or she utters\nit. The point rather is simply to begin with a certain obvious, but\nrough and vague statement, and find a replacement for it in a more\nprecise, unified, and minimal idiom (see, e.g., PLA, 180,\n189).  \n On Russell’s view, vagueness is a feature of language, not of the\nworld. In vague language, there is no one-one relation between\npropositions and facts, so that a vague statement could be considered\nverified by any one of a range of different facts (Vag,\n217). However, in a properly analyzed proposition, there is a clear\nisomorphism between the structure of the proposition and the structure\nof the fact that would make it true (PLA, 197); hence a\nprecise and analyzed proposition is capable of being true in one and\nonly one way (Vag, 219). In analyzing a proposition such as\n“there are a number of people in this room at this moment”, one might\nobtain a precise statement which would require for its truth that\nthere is a certain class of sensible particulars related to each other\nin a very definite way constituting the presence of a room, and\ncertain other classes of sensible particulars related to each other in\nways constituting people, and that the sensible particulars in the\nlatter classes bear certain definite relations to those in the first\nclass of particulars.  Obviously, nothing like this is clearly in the\nmind of a person who would ordinarily use the original English\nexpression. It is clear to see in this case that a very specific state\nof things is required for the truth of the analyzed proposition, and\nhence the truth of it will be far more doubtful than the truth of the\nvague assertion with which one began the process (PLA,\n179–80). As Russell put the point, “the point of philosophy is to\nstart with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to\nend with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it”\n(PLA, 193).  \n As we have seen, the primary metaphysical thesis of Russell’s atomism\nis the view that the world consists of many independent entities that\nexhibit qualities and stand in relations to one another.  On this\npicture, the simplest sort of fact or complex consists either of a\nsingle individual or particular bearing a quality, or a number of\nindividuals bearing a relation to one another. Relations can be\ndivided into various categories depending on how many relata they\ninvolve: a binary or dyadic relation involves two\nrelata (e.g., a is to the left of b); a\ntriadic relation (e.g., a is between b and\nc) involves three relata and so on. Russell at times used the\nword “relation” in a broad sense so as to include qualities, which\ncould be considered as “monadic” relations, i.e., relations that only\ninvolve one relatum.  The quality of being white, involved,\ne.g., in the fact that a is white, could then, in this\nbroader sense, also be considered a relation. \n \nAt the time of Principia Mathematica, complexes in Russell’s\nontology were all described as taking the form of n\nindividuals entering into an n-adic relation. There he\nwrites: \n As we have seen, at the time of writing Principia\nMathematica, Russell believed that an elementary proposition\nconsisting of a single predicate representing an n-place\nrelation along with n names of individuals is true if it\ncorresponds to a complex. An elementary proposition is false if there\nis no corresponding complex. Russell there gave no indication that he\nbelieved in any other sorts of complexes or truth-makers for any other\nsorts of propositions. Indeed, he held that a quantified proposition\nis made true not by a single complex, but by many, writing, “[i]f\nφx is an elementary judgment it is true when it\npoints to a corresponding complex. But\n(x).φx does not point to a single corresponding\ncomplex: the corresponding complexes are as numerous as the possible\nvalues of x” (PM, 46). \n \nSoon after Principia Mathematica, Russell became convinced\nthat this picture was too simplistic. In the “Philosophy of Logical\nAtomism” lectures he described a more complicated framework. In the\nnew terminology, the phrase “atomic fact” was introduced for the\nsimplest kind of fact, i.e., one in which n particulars enter\ninto an n-adic relation.  He used the phrase “atomic\nproposition” for a proposition consisting only of a predicate for an\nn-place relation, along with n proper names for\nparticulars. Hence, such propositions could take such forms as\n“F(a)”,\n“R(a, b)”,\n“S(a, b, c)”\n(cf. PM2, xv).  An atomic proposition is true when it\ncorresponds to a positive atomic fact. However, Russell no longer\nconceived of falsity as simply lacking a corresponding\nfact. Russell now believed that some facts are negative, i.e., that if\n“R(a, b)” is false, there is\nsuch a fact as\na’s not bearing relation R to b.\nSince the proposition “R(a, b)” is\naffirmative, and the corresponding fact is negative,\n“R(a, b)” is false, and, equivalently, its\nnegation “not-R(a, b)” is true. Russell’s\nrationale for endorsing negative facts was somewhat complicated (see,\ne.g., PLA, 211–15); however, one might object that his\nearlier view, according to which “R(a, b)”\nis false because it lacks a corresponding complex, is only plausible\nif you suppose that it must be a fact that there is not such\na complex, and such a fact would itself seem to be a negative\nfact. \n \nBy 1918, Russell had also abandoned the view, held at least as late as\n1911 (see RA, 94) that qualities and relations can occur in a\ncomplex as themselves the relata to another relation, as in\n“priority implies diversity”. Partly influenced by Wittgenstein,\nRussell now held the view that whenever a proposition apparently\ninvolves a relation or quality occurring as logical subject, it is\ncapable of being analyzed into a form in which the relation or quality\noccurs predicatively. For example, “priority implies diversity” might\nbe analyzed as “(x)(y)(x is prior to\ny ⊃ x is not y)” (PLA, 205–06;\nfor further discussion see Klement 2004). \n \nRussell used the phrase “molecular proposition” for those propositions\nthat are compounded using truth-function operators.  Examples would\ninclude, “F(a) &\nR(a, b)” and\n“R(a, b)\n∨ R(b, a)”. According to Russell,\nit is unnecessary to suppose that there exists any special sort of\nfact corresponding to molecular propositions; the truth-value of a\nmolecular proposition could be entirely derivative on the truth-values\nof its constituents (PLA, 209). Hence, if\n“F(a)\n& R(a,b)” is true, ultimately it\nis made true by two atomic facts, the fact that\na has property F and the fact that a bears\nR to b, and not by a single conjunctive fact. \n \nHowever, by 1918, Russell’s attitude with regard to quantified\npropositions had changed. He no longer believed that the truth of a\ngeneral proposition could be reduced simply to the facts or complexes\nmaking its instances true.  Russell argued that the truth of the\ngeneral proposition “(x).R(x,  b)”\ncould not consist entirely of the various atomic facts that a\nbears R to b, b bears R to\nb, c bears R to b, …. It\nalso requires the truth that there are no other individuals besides\na, b, c, etc., i.e., no other atomic facts\nof the relevant form. Hence, Russell concluded that there is a special\ncategory of facts he calls general facts that account for the\ntruth of quantified propositions, although he admitted a certain\namount of uncertainty as to their precise nature (PLA,\n234–37). Likewise, Russell also posited existence facts,\nthose facts corresponding to the truth of existentially quantified\npropositions, such as\n“(∃x)R(x, b)”. In the case of\ngeneral and existence facts, Russell did not think it coherent to make\ndistinctions between positive and negative facts. Indeed, a negative\ngeneral fact could simply be described as an existence fact, and a\nnegative existence fact could be described as a general fact. For\nexample, the falsity of the general proposition “all birds fly”\namounts to the fact that there exist birds that do not fly, and the\nfalsity of the existential proposition “there are unicorns” amounts to\nthe general fact that everything is not a unicorn. Obviously, however,\nthe truth or falsity of a general or existence proposition is not\nwholly independent of its instances. \n \nIn addition to the sorts of facts discussed above, Russell raised the\nquestion as to whether a special sort of fact is required\ncorresponding to propositions that report a belief, desire or other\n“propositional attitude”.  Russell’s views on this matter changed over\ndifferent periods, as his own views regarding the nature of judgment,\nbelief and representation matured.  Moreover, in some works he left it\nas an open question as to whether one need presuppose a distinct kind\nof logical form in these cases (e.g., PLA, 224–28;\nIMT, 256–57). At times, however, Russell believed that the\nfact that S believes that a bears R to\nb amounts to the holding of a multiple relation in which\nS, a, R and b are all\nrelata (e.g. NTF, 155–56; TK, 144ff).  At other\npoints, he considered more complicated analyses in which beliefs\namount to the possession of certain psychological states bearing\ncausal or other relationships to the objects they are about, or the\ntendencies of believers to behave in certain ways (see, e.g.,\nIMT, 182–83; HK, 144–48).  Depending on how such\nphenomena are analyzed, it is certainly not clear that they require\nany new species of fact.  \n \nRussell’s use of the phrase “atomic fact”, and indeed the very title\nof “logical atomism” suggest that the constituents of atomic facts,\nthe “logical atoms”, Russell spoke of, must be regarded as utterly\nsimple and devoid of complexity. In that case, the particulars,\nqualities and relations making up atomic facts constitute the\nfundamental level of reality to which all other aspects of reality are\nultimately reducible. This attitude is confirmed especially in\nRussell’s early logical atomist writings. For example, in “Analytic\nRealism”, Russell wrote:\n \n I believe there are simple beings in the universe, and that these\nbeings have relations in virtue of which complex beings are\ncomposed. Any time a bears the relation R to\nb there is a complex “a in relation R to\nb” …  \n You will note that this philosophy is the philosophy of logical\natomism. Every simple entity is an atom. (RA,  94) \n \nElsewhere he spoke of “logical atomism” as involving the\nview that “you can get down in theory, if not in practice, to\nultimate simples, out of which the world is built, and that those\nsimples have a kind of reality not belonging to anything else”\n(PLA, 270). However, it has been questioned whether Russell\nhad sufficient argumentation for thinking that there are such simple\nbeings. \n \nIn the abstract, there are two sorts of arguments Russell could have\ngiven for the existence of simples, a priori arguments, or\nempirical arguments (cf. Pears 1985, 4ff). An a priori\nargument might proceed from the very understanding of complexity: what\nis complex presupposes parts. In 1924, Russell wrote, “I confess it\nseems obvious to me (as it did Leibniz) that what is complex must be\ncomposed of simples, though the number of constituents may be\ninfinite” (LA, 337). However, if construed as an argument,\nthis does not seem very convincing. It seems at least logically\npossible that while a complex may have parts, its parts might\nthemselves be complex, and their parts might also be complex, and\nso on, ad infinitum.  Indeed, Russell himself later came to\nadmit that one could not know simply on the basis of something being\ncomplex that it must be composed of simples (MPD, 123). \n \nAnother sort of a priori argument might stem from conceptions\nregarding the nature of analysis. As analysis proceeds, one\nreaches more primitive notions, and it might be thought that the\nprocess must terminate at a stage in which the remaining vocabulary is\nindefinable because the entities involved are absolutely simple, and\nhence, cannot be construed as logical constructions built out of\nanything more primitive. Russell did at some points describe his\nlogical atoms as reached at “the limit of analysis” (LA, 337)\nor “the final residue in analysis” (MPD, 164). However, even\nduring the height of his logical atomist period, Russell admitted that\nit is possible that “analysis could go on forever”, and that complex\nthings might be capable of analysis “ad infinitum”\n(PLA, 202). \n \nLastly, one might argue for simples as the basis of an empirical\nargument; i.e., one might claim to have completed the process of\nanalysis and to have reduced all sorts of truths down to certain\nentities that can be known in some way or another to be\nsimple. Russell is sometimes interpreted as having reasoned in this\nway. According to Russell’s well known “principle of acquaintance” in\nepistemology, in order to understand a proposition, one must be\nacquainted with the meaning of every simple symbol making it up (see,\ne.g., KAKD, 159).  Russell at times suggested that we are\nonly directly acquainted with sense data, and their properties and\nrelations, and perhaps with our own selves (KAKD, 154ff). It\nmight be thought that these entities are simple, and must constitute\nthe terminus of analysis. However, Russell was explicit that\nsense data can themselves be complex, and that he knew of no reason to\nsuppose that we cannot be acquainted with a complex without being\naware that it is complex and without being acquainted with its\nconstituents (KAKD, 153; cf. TK, 120). Moreover, Russell continued to use the label “logical atomism” to describe his philosophy long after his epistemology had ceased to center around the acquaintance relation. (For further argumentation on these points, see Elkind 2018.) Indeed,\nRussell eventually came to the conclusion that nothing can ever be\nknown to be simple (MPD, 123). \n \nWhile there is significant evidence that Russell did believe in the\nexistence of simple entities in the early phases of his logical\natomist period, it is possible that, uncharacteristically, he held\nthis belief without argumentation.  In admitting that it is possible\nthat analysis could go on ad infinitum, Russell claimed that\n“I do not think it is true, but it is a thing that one might argue,\ncertainly” (PLA, 202). In his 1924 piece “Logical Atomism”,\nRussell admitted that “by greater logical skill, the need for assuming\nthem [i.e. simples] could be avoided”.  This attitude may explain in\npart why it is that at the outset of his 1918 lectures on logical atomism,\nhe claimed that “[t]he things I am going to say in these lectures are\nmainly my own personal opinions and I do not claim that they are more\nthan that” (PLA, 178). It may have been that Russell was\ninterested not so much in establishing definitively that there are any\nabsolutely simple entities, but rather in combating the widespread\narguments of others that the notion of a simple, independent entity is\nincoherent, and only the whole of the universe is fundamentally\nreal. According to Russell, such attitudes are customarily traced to a\nwrong view about relations; in arguing for the doctrine of “external\nrelations”, Russell was attempting simply to render a world of simple\nentities coherent again. Others had argued that possessing an inner complexity in the form of “nature” was needed to explain the essential properties of things or the necessary connections between them; as we shall see in Section 4.3 below, Russell believed that such apparent essential properties or necessary relations could typically be explained away. \n As his career progressed, Russell became more and more prone to\nemphasize that what is important for his philosophical outlook\nis not absolute simplicity, but only relative simplicity. As\nearly as 1922, in response to criticism about his notion of\nsimplicity, Russell wrote: \n According to Russell, analysis proceeds in stages.  When analysis\nshows the terminology and presuppositions of one stage of analysis to\nbe definable, or logically constructible, in terms of simpler and more\nbasic notions, this is a philosophical advance, even if these notions\nare themselves further analyzable. As Russell says, the only drawback\nto a language which is not yet fully analyzed is that in it,\none cannot speak of anything more fundamental than those objects,\nproperties or relations that are named at that level (e.g.,\nLA, 337). \n \nIn a later work, Russell summarized his position as follows:  \n This conception can be applied without assuming that there is anything\nabsolutely simple. We can define as “relatively simple” whatever we do\nnot know to be complex. Results obtained using the concept of\n“relative simplicity” will still be true if complexity is afterward\nfound, provided we have abstained from asserting absolute simplicity\n(HK, 259) \n  Russell concluded that even if there are no ultimate simples, no\nfundamental layer of reality that analysis can in principle reach,\nthis does not invalidate analysis as a philosophical\nprocedure. Moreover, at a given stage of analysis, a certain class of\nsentences may still be labeled as “atomic”, even if the facts\ncorresponding to them cannot be regarded as built of fundamental\nontological atoms (MPD, 165). Russell concluded that “the\nwhole question whether there are simples to be reached by analysis is\nunnecessary” (MPD, 123).  From this vantage point, it might\nbe argued that Russell’s “logical atomism” can be understood as first\nand foremost a commitment to analysis as a method coupled with a\nrejection of idealistic monism, rather than a pretense to have\ndiscovered the genuine metaphysical “atoms” making up the world of\nfacts, or even the belief that such a discovery is possible\n(cf. Linsky 2003; Maclean 2018). Indeed, Russell continued to use the phrase\n“logical atomism” to describe his philosophy in later years of his\ncareer, during the period in which he stressed relative, not absolute\nsimplicity (RTC, 717; MPD, 9). \n \nAnother important issue often discussed in connection with logical\natomism worth discussing in greater detail is the supposition that\natomic propositions are logically independent of each other, or that\nthe truth or falsity of any one atomic proposition does not logically\nimply or necessitate the truth or falsity of any other atomic\nproposition. This supposition is often taken to be a central aspect of\nthe very notion of “logical atomism”, perhaps largely because it is\nfound explicitly in Wittgenstein’s Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus, almost certainly the most important account\nof a logical atomist philosophy found outside of Russell’s\nwork. Wittgenstein claimed:\n \n \n5.134   From an elementary proposition no other can be\ninferred.  (Wittgenstein 1922, 109) \n The lack of any logical relations between atomic propositions goes\nhand in hand with a similar view about atomic facts; each\natomic fact is metaphysically independent of every other, and any one\ncould obtain or fail to obtain regardless of the obtaining (or not) of\nany other. This position also pairs well with a broader view on the nature of necessity: that all necessity reduces to features of logical form. There is nothing in the form of one atomic statement that would allow us to infer (or reject) another. Hence, if all necessary connections are a result of logical form, atomic facts must be independent. If what appears to be a simple subject-predicate statement is necessary, it must in fact have a more complicated form when analyzed, so that the necessity of the statement is explained by its form. Similar remarks might be suggested what appear to be simple necessary relational statements. Wittgenstein, at least, explicitly endorsed the position that all necessity is logical necessity (6.37). Some commentators also take the thesis that all necessity is logical necessity (Landini 2010, chap. 4; 2018), or the thesis that de re modality is to be rejected in favor of de dicto necessity (Cocchiarella 2007, chap. 3), to be key to Russell’s logical atomism as well. \nRussell’s precise positions on these matters is not as clear as one\nmight hope and nowhere does he treat them at any\nlength. The few pertinent remarks he does make are either somewhat\nambivalent or seem to work against interpreting him as holding strong\nversions of these theses.  For example, in 1914, in arguing that\natomic facts are typically known by direct empirical means rather than\nby inference, he wrote that “[p]erhaps one atomic fact may\nsometimes be capable of being inferred from another, though I do not\nbelieve this to be the case; but in any case it cannot be inferred\nfrom premises no one of which is an atomic fact” (OKEW,\n48). Here, Russell expressed doubt about the existence of any\nrelations of logical dependence between atomic propositions, but the\nfact that he left it as an open possibility makes it seem that he would\nnot consider it a defining feature of an atomic proposition that it\nmust be independent from all others, or a central tenet of logical\natomism generally that atomic facts are independent from one\nanother. In 1936 he even went so far as to mock Wittgenstein’s claims\nthat atomic facts are independent of one another, and that all\ndeductions must be formal, by claiming that “no one in fact holds\nthese views, and a philosophy which professes them cannot be wholly\nsincere” (LE, 319). \n \nNevertheless, there a number of aspects of Russell’s philosophical\npositions that lead to the conclusion that they cohere best with\nsome doctrine about the independence of atomic facts or\npropositions. Russell did often speak about the constituents\nof atomic facts as independently existing entities. He writes for\nexample that “each particular has its being independently of any other\nand does not depend upon anything else for the logical possibility of\nits existence” (PLA, 203). It is not altogether clear what\nRussell meant by speaking of particulars or entities as being\nlogically independent. In contemporary parlance, typically, “logical\nindependence” is used solely to speak of a relation between sentences,\npropositions, or perhaps facts or states of affairs. One possible\ninterpretation would be to take Russell as holding that any atomic\nfact involving a certain group of particulars is logically independent\nof an atomic fact involving a distinct group of particulars, even if\nthe two facts involve the same quality or relation (see, e.g., Bell\nand Demopoulos 1996, 118–19).  This weakened version of the\nindependence thesis even has certain attractions over the stronger\nprinciple endorsed by Wittgenstein. Most of the usual counterexamples\ngiven against the thesis that atomic facts or propositions are always\nindependent involve simple properties that are thought to be\nexclusive. Consider, for example, what has come to be called the\n“color exclusion problem”. The propositions “a is red” and\n“a is blue” do not seem to be independent from one another:\nfrom the truth of one the falsity of the other can seemingly be\ninferred. However, the weakened version of the independence principle,\non which only atomic facts involving different particulars\nare independent, does not entail that it is possible that “a\nis red” and “a is blue” may both be true. \n \nIt is likely that Russell’s contention that particulars are\nindependent from one another was connected in his mind with his views\non relations. In holding the view that relations among simple\nparticulars are external, Russell saw himself as denying the view that\nwhen a bears R to b, there is some part of\na’s “nature” as an entity that involves its relatedness to\nb. It might be thought that Russell’s doctrine of external\nrelations committed him at least to certain principles regarding the\nmodal status of atomic facts (if not the independence principle).\nAccording to certain ways of defining the phrase, what it\nmeans for a relation to be internal is that it is a\nrelation that its relata could not fail to have; an\nexternal relation is one its relata could possibly not\nhave. Russell then might be seen as committed to the view that atomic\nfacts (all of which involve particulars standing in relations, in the\nbroad sense above) are always contingent. While this does not directly\nbear on the question of their independence, it would nevertheless\ncommit Russell to certain tenets regarding the modal features of\natomic facts. \n \nHowever, Russell himself warned against interpreting his position on\nrelations this way, writing, “the doctrine that relations are\n‘external’ … is not correctly expressed by saying\nthat two terms which have a certain relation might not have had that\nrelation. Such a statement introduces the notion of possibility and\nthus raises irrelevant difficulties” (BReal,  87).\nComplicating matters here are Russell’s own rather idiosyncratic and\nskeptical views about modal notions. Russell was dissatisfied with the\nprevailing conceptions of necessity and possibility among philosophers\nof his day, and argued instead against necessity (or possibility) as a\nfundamental or irreducible concept (see NP passim). \n \nDespite Russell’s misgivings about modal notions, it is clear enough\nfrom Russell’s conception of logic that logical relations\nbetween propositions would always obtain in virtue of their form\n(IMP, 197–98; PLA, 237–39). Again, atomic propositions are\nof the simplest possible forms, and there is certainly nothing in\ntheir forms that would suggest any logical connection to, or\nincompatibility with, other atomic propositions. \n \nPerhaps the most illuminating remarks to be found in Russell’s work\nthat would lead one to expect complete logical independence among\natomic propositions involve the claims he made about how it is that\none recognizes a certain class of purported entities as “logical\nconstructions”, and the recommendations he gives about analyzing\npropositions involving them.  Russell writes: \n Russell did not define here what he means by “neat logical\nproperties”, but it is possible to understand what he had in mind by\nway of the examples he gave. He cited as “neat properties” of material\nobjects that it is impossible for two material objects to occupy the\nsame place at the same time, and that it is impossible for one\nmaterial object to occupy distinct places in space at the same time\n(LA, 329; cf. AMi, 264–65; AMa,\n385). Consider then the propositions “O1 is\nlocated at p1 at t1”, and\n“O1 is located at p2 at\nt1” where “O1” is the name of\na physical object, “p1” and\n“p2” represent distinct locations in space, and\n“t1” the name of a certain instant in time.  Prior\nto analysis, such propositions appear to be logically incompatible\natomic propositions. However, Russell explains that the logical\nnecessities involved in cases such as these are due to the nature of\nmaterial objects, points and instants as logical constructions. At a\ncertain point in time, a physical object might be regarded as a class\nof sensible particulars bearing certain resemblance relations to one\nanother occupying a continuous region of space. It is\ntherefore impossible by definition for the same physical\nobject to occupy wholly distinct locations at the same time. When\nanalyzed, such propositions as “O1 is located at\np1 at t1” are revealed as\nhaving a much more complicated logical form, and hence may have\nlogical consequences not evident before analysis. We do not have here\nany reason to think that truly atomic propositions, those containing\nnames of genuine particulars and their relations, are not always\nindependent. \n \nRussell strongly intimated that it is a part of the very nature of\nlogical analysis that if our pre-analyzed understanding of a certain\nphenomenon involves the postulation of entities with certain\nstructural or modal properties, one should seek to replace talk of\nsuch entities with logical constructions specifically constituted so\nas to have these features by definition (PLA, 272–79;\nLA, 326–29). A logical construction would typically be\nunderstood as a sort of class; since discourse about classes was\nregarded by Russell as a convenience, which would be eliminated in a\nfully analyzed language in favor of speaking of their defining\nproperties and relations, by such a process Russell believed it is\npossible to replace commitment to entities having “neat logical\nproperties” with commitment to those that do not possess such\nfeatures. Russell’s work on mathematics provides us with what he would have taken as many examples of this phenomenon. If we take \"3 > 2” and \"3 < 2” at face-value as expressing simple dyadic relations between simple entities named “2” and “3”, then these appear to be two atomic propositions, one necessary, one impossible, which are not independent of each other. But after analysis, “2” and “3” are revealed not to be names at all, and the necessity, impossibility, and mutual incompatibility of these statements is rendered purely logical.\nAssuming that there is a final terminus of analysis in\nabsolutely simple entities and fully atomic facts, one might suppose\nthat here  the logical necessities and relationships between them\nwould have completely disappeared. Russell later summarized the\nattitude of his logical atomist period by writing that “it seemed to result that none of the raw material of the world has smooth logical\nproperties, but that whatever appears to have such properties is\nconstructed artificially in order to have them” (IPOM,\nxi). While this is not exactly an endorsement of the claim that atomic\nfacts are logically independent of one another, it is perhaps the\nclosest sentiment one can find in his philosophy. It is again perhaps better understood as an endorsement of a methodological maxim. If a certain stage of analysis seems to portray entities as having “neat” logical properties, i.e., necessary features or relations not explained by logical form, this is a sign that more analysis is needed. Perhaps by analyzing the statements further, “busting open” the apparent terms for these things to reveal more complicated logical forms, what appear to be necessary connections between atomic facts will be shown actually to be logically necessary relationships between non-atomic facts owed to their logical forms (cf. Elkind forthcoming). \n Russell’s logical atomism had significant influence on the\ndevelopment of philosophy, especially in the first half of the 20th\ncentury.  Nowhere is Russell’s influence more clearly seen than in the\nwork of his pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein’s Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus appeared in 1921; in it, Wittgenstein\npresented in some detail a logical atomist metaphysics.  (It should be\nnoted, however, that there is significant controversy over whether, in\nthe end, Wittgenstein himself meant to endorse this metaphysics.)  In\nthe Tractatus, the world is described as consisting of\nfacts. The simplest facts, which Wittgenstein called\n“Sachverhalte”, translated either as “states of affairs” or\n“atomic facts”, are thought of as conglomerations of objects combined\nwith a definite structure. The objects making up these atomic basics\nwere described as absolutely simple. Elementary propositions are\npropositions whose truth depends entirely on the presence of an atomic\nfact, and other propositions have a determinate and unique analysis in\nwhich they can be construed as built up from elementary propositions in\ntruth-functional ways.  \n \nPartly owing to Wittgenstein’s influence, partly directly, Russell’s\nlogical atomism had significant influence on the works of the logical\npositivist tradition, as exemplified in the works of Carnap, Waismann,\nHempel and Ayer.  This tradition usually disavowed metaphysical\nprinciples, but methodologically their philosophies owed much to\nRussell’s approach. Carnap, for example, described philosophy as\ntaking the form of providing “the logical analysis of the language of\nscience” (Carnap 1934, 61). This originally took the form of\nattempting to show that all meaningful scientific discourse could be\nanalyzed in terms of logical combinations beginning with “protocol\nsentences”, or sentences directly confirmable or disconfirmable by\nexperience.  This notion of a “protocol sentence” in this tradition\nwas originally modeled after Russellian and Wittgensteinian atomic\npropositions. The notion of a “logical construction” was also\nimportant for how such thinkers conceived of the nature of ordinary\nobjects (see, e.g., Ayer 1952, chap. 3). The view that scientific\nlanguage could readily and easily be analyzed directly in terms of\nobservables gradually gave way to more holistic views, such as Quine’s\n(see, e.g. Quine 1951), in which it is claimed that it is only a body\nof scientific theories that can be compared to experience, and not\nisolated sentences.  However, even in later works growing out of this\ntradition, the influence of Russell can be felt. \n \nBesides positive influence, many trends in 20th century philosophy can\nbe best understood largely as a reaction to Russell’s atomistic\nphilosophy. Ironically, nowhere is this more true than in the later\nwritings of Wittgenstein, especially his Philosophical\nInvestigations (1953). Among other things, Wittgenstein there\ncalled into question whether a single, unequivocal notion of\nsimplicity or a final state of analysis can be found (e.g.,\nsecs. 46–49, 91), and questioned the utility of an ideal language\n(sec. 81). Wittgenstein also called into question whether, in those\ncases in which analysis is possible, the results really give us what\nwas meant at the start: “does someone who says that the broom is in\nthe corner really mean: the broomstick is there, and so is the brush,\nand the broomstick is fixed in the brush?” (sec. 60). Much of the work\nof the so-called “ordinary language” school of philosophy centered in\nOxford in the 1940s and 1950s can also been seen largely as a critical\nresponse to views of Russell (see, e.g., Austin 1962, Warnock 1951,\nUrmson 1956).  \n \nNevertheless, despite the criticisms, many so-called “analytic”\nphilosophers still believe that the notion of analysis has some role\nto play in philosophical methodology, though there seems to be no\nconsensus regarding precisely what analysis consists in, and to what\nextent it leads reliably to metaphysically significant\nresults. Debates regarding the nature of simple entities, their\ninterrelations or dependencies between one another, and whether there\nare any such entities, are still alive and well.  Russell’s rejection\nof idealistic monism, and his arguments in favor of a pluralistic\nuniverse, have gained almost universal acceptance, with a few\nexceptions. Abstracting away from Russell’s particular examples of\nproposed analyses in terms of sensible particulars, the general\nframework of Russell’s atomistic picture of the world, which consists\nof a plurality of entities that have qualities and enter into\nrelations, remains one to which many contemporary philosophers are\nattracted.","contact.mail":"klement@philos.umass.edu","contact.domain":"philos.umass.edu"}]
