For deontic logic, the aim is to\ndevelop accounts of the logical contribution made by the key concepts\nlisted\n above.[3]\n \n\nAs a branch of logic, deontic logic is of theoretical\ninterest for some of the same reasons that\n modal logic\n (the logic of necessity and possibility), is of theoretical interest.\nAlso, although we need to be cautious about making too easy a link\nbetween deontic logic and practicality, many of the notions listed\nabove are typically employed in attempting to regulate and\ncoordinate our\n lives.[4]\n For these reasons, deontic logics often directly involve topics of\nconsiderable practical significance such as morality, law, social and\nbusiness organizations (their norms, as well as their normative\nconstitution), and security systems. To that extent, studying the\nlogic of notions with such practical significance adds\npractical significance to deontic logic itself. However, in this entry\nwe will focus on deontic logic itself, rather than its applications\nand practical relevance.\n\n\nIn Section 1 of this entry, we note certain simple formal\nrelationships between the first six concepts in our initial list\nabove, following the many-centuries old tradition of comparing (and\ncontrasting) basic deontic notions (e.g., obligation, permission) with\nmodal notions (e.g., necessity and possibility). In Section 2, we turn\nto a benchmark system of symbolic deontic logic, one that quickly\nbecame a reference point. In Section 3, we examine a closely related\napproach that reframes deontic notions by “reducing” them\nto pure modal notions coupled with a so-called “deontic\nconstant”. In a sense, the approaches discussed in Sections 2\nand 3 might be said to stand in the shadow of modal logic. In Section\n4, we turn to developments in deontic logic that emerged in the\nattempt to grapple with conditionalized deontic claims, and here\ndeontic logic comes more fully into its own. In Sections 5 and 6 we\nturn to a variety of perceived inadequacies of the benchmark systems\nintroduced in Sections 1–4. Section 5 focuses primarily on arguing for\nand specifying expansions of the limited expressive resources in the\nbenchmark\n systems.[5]\n Finally, Section 6, rather than expanding on the benchmark\napproaches, instead raises fundamental shortcomings in their modelling\nof the ideas they purport to represent, thereby seeking to dismantle\nsome of the principles of the systems and/or construct new systems in\ntheir place.\n\nDeontic logic has been regularly influenced by reflection on the logic\nof modal notions, such as necessity (in varying senses of the\nterm). In particular, analogies between alethic (truth-implicating)\nmodal notions and deontic notions were noticed before the fourteenth\ncentury in Europe, where we might say that the rudiments of formal\n(though not symbolic) deontic logic experienced its initial European\nstirrings. In Islamic thought, such analogies go back at least as far\nas the tenth century. \nAlthough interest in what can be arguably called formal aspects of\ndeontic logic continued off and on, the trend toward studying logic\nusing the symbolic and exact techniques of mathematics began\nprimarily in the nineteenth century, and became dominant in the\ntwentieth century. Work in twentieth century symbolic modal logic\nprovided the explicit impetus for von Wright (1951a, 1951b), the\ncentral early figure in the emergence of deontic logic as a\nfull-fledged branch of symbolic logic in the twentieth\ncentury. However, we note that prior to von Wright 1951a, there was\none significant earlier episode in symbolic deontic logic, namely\nMally 1926. See supplement A:\n Mally and Symbolic Deontic Logic.[6] \nIn the remainder of this section, we first spell out a few\nfolk-logical features of alethic modal notions, and then give an\nimpressionistic sense of how natural it was for early developments of\ndeontic logic to explore deontic analogs to those features. \nAlethic modal logic is the logic of necessary truth and related\nnotions. Consider six basic alethic modal notions, expressed as\nsentential operators—constructions that, when applied to a\nsentence, yield a sentence (as does “it is not the case\nthat”): \nAlthough all of the above operators are generally deemed definable in\nterms of any one of the first four, the necessity operator, usually\nsymbolized as a box, \\(\\Box\\), is typically taken as primitive and the\nrest defined accordingly. Where “\\(\\neg\\)”,\n“&” , and “\\(\\vee\\)“ denote classical\nnegation, conjunction, and disjunction, the definitions are as\nfollows: \nIt was also routinely assumed that the following threefold partition\nof propositions holds: \nFig. 1 \nThe three rectangular cells are intended to be jointly exhaustive and\nmutually exclusive: every proposition is either necessary, contingent\n(possibly true but also possibly false), or impossible, but no\nproposition is more than one of these. The possible propositions are\nthose that are either necessary or contingent, the non-necessary\npropositions are those that are either impossible or contingent, and\nthe non-contingent ones are those either necessary or impossible. \nThirdly, dating back at least to the twelfth and thirteenth century\n(Knuuttila 2008), the following modal square of opposition is often\n noted:[8] \nFig. 2\n [An extended description of figure 2.] \nFurthermore it is generally assumed that the following hold: \nIf \\(\\Box p\\) then \\(p\\) (if it is necessary that \\(p\\), then \\(p\\) is\ntrue). \nIf \\(p\\), then \\(\\Diamond p\\) (if \\(p\\) is true, then it is\npossible). \nThese indicate that the idea of necessity here is alethic or\ntruth-implicating. Many of the ideas above were noted in medieval\ntimes. (See, e.g., the entry on\n medieval theories of modality.) \nWe now turn to some of the analogies involved in what is a\ncorresponding bit of deontic folk logic, following the exposition in\nMcNamara 1996a,b. This is a minor elaboration of elements that can be\nfound explicitly in von Wright 1951b and Prior 1955 [1962]. However,\nmuch of it has roots in medieval Islamic and late medieval European\nthought, where possible analogies between deontic modals and alethic\nmodals were being explored and formal deontic schemes were\n proposed.[9] \nExpressed as sentential operators, the six normative statuses of what\nwe will call “the Traditional Scheme” are: \nThe first three are the most often cited, the fourth is often not\nlabeled, and the fifth has regularly been mislabeled as “it is a\nmatter of indifference that”, and so likewise for the\nsixth. Typically, one of the first two is taken as primitive, and the\nothers defined in terms of it, but any of the first four can play the\nsame defining role. The most prevalent approach is to take \\(\\OB\\) as\nprimitive, and define the rest as\n follows:[11] \nThese definitions imply that something is permissible iff (if and only\nif) its negation is not obligatory, impermissible iff its negation is\nobligatory, omissible iff it is not obligatory, optional iff neither\nit nor its negation is obligatory, and non-optional iff it is either\nobligatory or impermissible. Call this “The Traditional\nDefinitional Scheme (TDS)”. It, or minor variants, are\nfound as far back as Ockham in European thought, and quite explicitly\nin Leibniz in the modern\n period.[12]\n If one began with \\(\\OB\\) alone and considered the formulas on the\nright above, one could easily be led to consider them as at least\ncandidate defining conditions for those on the left. Although not\nuncontestable, they are natural, and this scheme has been very widely\nemployed. Now if the reader looks back at our use of the necessity\noperator in defining the remaining five alethic modal operators, it\nwill be clear that these are perfectly analogous to the five deontic\ndefinitions above. From the formal standpoint, the one is merely a\nsyntactic variant of the other: just replace \\(\\OB\\) with \\(\\Box\\),\n\\(\\PE\\) with \\(\\Diamond\\), etc. \nIn addition to the TDS, it was traditionally assumed that the\nfollowing, call it “The Traditional Threefold Classification\n(TTC)” holds: \nFig. 3 \nAs in the modal case, the thought is that all propositions are divided\ninto three jointly exhaustive and mutually exclusive classes: every\nproposition is obligatory, impermissible or neither (that is,\noptional) and no proposition falls into more than one of these three\ncategories. Furthermore, the permissible propositions are those that\nare obligatory or optional, the omissible propositions are those that\nare impermissible or optional, and the non-optional propositions are\nthose that are either obligatory or impermissible. This classification\ntoo has roots centuries\n ago.[13]\n The reader can easily confirm that this natural scheme is also\nperfectly analogous to the threefold classification we gave above for\nnecessary, contingent and impossible propositions. \nFurthermore, as indicated earlier, “The Deontic Square”\n(DS) is also often cited in the historical literature: \nFig. 4\n [An extended description of figure 4.] \nThe relationships between the logical operators at the corners are to\nbe interpreted as in the modal square of opposition. The two squares\nare perfectly analogous. If we weave in nodes for optionality and\nnon-optionality, we get a deontic\n hexagon:[14] \nFig. 5\n [An extended description of figure 5.] \nGiven these analogies, it is unsurprising that our primitive operator,\nread here as “it is obligatory that”, is often referred to\nas “deontic necessity”. However, there are also\nobvious disanalogies with alethic necessity. Before, we cited two\nprinciples for alethic necessity whose deontic analogs are clearly\nfalse: \nObligations can be violated, and impermissible things do\n happen.[15]\n However, as researchers turned to generalizations of alethic modal\nlogic, they began to consider wider classes of modal logics, including\nones where the necessity operator was not truth-implicating.\nThis too encouraged seeing deontic logic as falling within modal logic\nso-generalized. In fact, recognizing possibilities like this helped to\nfuel the generalizations of what began with a focus on alethic modal\nlogic to normal modal logics (Lemmon & Scott 1977). \nWe will revisit the Traditional Scheme in a more precise and unifying\nway in the next section. There is a sense in which it is an earlier\ninformal and widely endorsed fragment of the most well-known deontic\nlogic, a logic that makes the connection to alethic modal logic even\ntighter. We now turn to that logic. \nStandard Deontic Logic (SDL) is the most cited and studied\nsystem of deontic logic, and one of the first deontic logics\naxiomatically specified. SDL includes classical propositional logic,\nand is essentially a distinguished member of the most studied class of\npropositional modal logics, “normal modal logics”. SDL is\na “monadic” deontic logic, since its primitive deontic\noperator is a one-place operator (like \\(\\neg\\), and unlike &): it\napplies to a single sentence to yield a compound\n sentence.[16]\n This operator, \\(\\OB\\), is taken as primitive within SDL; as\nexplained in\n Section 1.2,\n other operators such as \\(\\PE\\) and \\(\\IM\\) can be defined from it\nfollowing the Traditional Definitional Scheme. \nAssume again that we have a language of classical propositional logic\n(PC) with an infinite set of propositional variables, the truth\nfunctional operators \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\rightarrow\\) (and perhaps any of\n&, \\(\\vee\\) and \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) as well), and the operator,\n\\(\\OB\\). SDL is then often axiomatized as\n follows:[17] \nTAUT combined with modus ponens (MP) gives us the full inferential\npower of PC. \\(\\OB\\)-K, which is the K-axiom common to all normal\nmodal logics, tells us that if a material conditional is obligatory,\nand its antecedent is too, then so is its\n consequent.[18]\n NC tells us that \\(p\\) is obligatory only if its negation\nisn’t. The rule \\(\\OB\\)-NEC tells us that if anything is a\ntheorem, then the claim that that thing is obligatory is also a\ntheorem. Note that this guarantees that something is always obligatory\n(even if only logical\n truths).[19] \nEach of the distinctively deontic principles, \\(\\OB\\)-K, NC, and\n\\(\\OB\\)-NEC are contestable, and we will consider criticisms of them\nin\n Section 6.\n However, to avoid immediate confusion for those new to deontic logic,\nit is perhaps worth noting that \\(\\OB\\)-NEC is generally deemed a\nconvenience that, among other things, assures that SDL is in fact one\nof the well-studied normal modal\n logics.[20]\n Few have spilled blood to defend its cogency substantively, and often\nthese practical compromises are wise, especially in early stages of\nresearch. \nSDL can be seen as a normalized version of von Wright’s original\nproposal in von Wright 1951a, though there are some significant\ndifferences in terms of the formal language, validities, and its\ninterpretation. A quick comparison of both systems can be found in the\nsupplement B on\n von Wright’s 1951a System and SDL. \nBelow we list some theorems and two important derived rules of\n SDL.[21] \nWe will be discussing virtually all of these subsequently. For now,\nlet’s indicate a few derivations. We show that \\(\\OB\\)-RM is a\nderived rule of SDL, and note three\n corollaries.[22] \nAn alternative formulation of SDL can be found in supplement C on\n Alternative Axiomatization of SDL. \nSDL can be strengthened by adding additional axioms; in particular, we\nmight consider adding axioms with nested deontic operators. For\nexample, suppose we added the following formula as an axiom to\nSDL: \nCall the resulting system “SDL+” for easy reference in\nthis section. This says (roughly) that it is required that obligations\nbe fulfilled. This is not a theorem of SDL (as we will see in\n Section 2.3),\n so SDL+ is a genuine strengthening of SDL. Furthermore, it makes a\nlogically contingent proposition (i.e., that \\(\\OB p\n\\rightarrow p)\\) obligatory as a matter of deontic logic. SDL\ndoes not have this feature. With this addition to SDL, it is easy to\nprove \\(\\OB \\OB p \\rightarrow \\OB p\\), a formula involving an iterated\noccurrence of our main\n operator.[23]\n This formula asserts that if it is obligatory that \\(p\\) be\nobligatory, then \\(p\\) is obligatory. (Cf. “the only\nthings that are required to be obligatory are those that actually\n are”).[24]\n It should be noted that these are often given an impersonal ought\nreading, so that \\(\\OB\\)-U would be read as “It ought to be the\ncase that if it ought to be the case that \\(p\\) then it\n is)”.[25] \nIn identifying the Traditional Definitional Scheme (TDS) in\n Section 1.2,\n we noted that it was widely recognized that we could have taken\nanother notion than obligation from our first four primary\nnormative statuses and defined the rest in terms of that one. So it is\nexpected that we should be able to generate the corresponding\nequivalences derivatively from the scheme we did settle on, where\n\\(\\OB\\) is taken as primitive. For example, it is obviously desirable\nto have \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\PE \\neg p\\) as part of the\nTraditional Scheme, as this expresses the equivalence between what\nwould have been definiens and definiendum had “\\(\\PE\\)”\nbeen taken as primitive. However, this equivalence is not thus far\nderivable. For \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\PE \\neg p\\) is\ndefinitionally equivalent to \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\neg \\OB\n\\neg \\neg p\\), that is, \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\OB \\neg \\neg p\\), but\nthe latter formula is not a tautology, so we cannot in turn derive\n\\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\PE \\neg p\\). So more is presupposed in\nthe Traditional Scheme than what has been noted above. A natural\nthought is a rule of inference needs to be added, one allowing for the\nreplacement of provably equivalent formulas in the context of\n“\\(\\OB\\)”, namely \\(\\OB\\)-RE in Corollary 2 above\nLet’s take this to be tacitly part of the Traditional\nScheme. \nSuppose now that we have the same language as that of SDL, along with\nthe rule RE governing \\(\\OB\\). We saw in\n Section 1.2\n that in addition to TDS, the Traditional Threefold Classification\n(TTC) and/or the Deontic Square (DS) of Opposition were often\nexplicitly endorsed in pre-symbolic investigations of deontic logic.\nSymbolically formulated, these are: \nGiven TDS and RE, it turns out that DS and TTC are each\ntautologically equivalent to the principle that obligations\ncannot conflict (and thus to one another): \nFor in primitive notation, DS becomes \nand although the first two conjuncts are tautologies, the remaining\nfour are each tautologically equivalent to NC above. Similarly, TTC\nbecomes \nand although the exhaustiveness clause is tautological, as are the\nlast two conjuncts of the exclusiveness clause, the first conjunct of\nthat clause is just NC\n again.[26] \nSo the Traditional Scheme rests squarely on the soundness of NC, along\nwith \\(\\OB\\)-RE and the TDS. In fact, the Traditional Scheme can be\nseen as a widely endorsed, informal counterpart of a deontic logic\ncomposed of just PC, \\(\\OB\\)-RE and NC. Since that logic is a (proper)\nfragment of SDL, it follows that the Traditional Scheme (symbolized)\nis entailed by\n SDL.[27] \nThe reader familiar with elementary textbook logic will have perhaps\nnoticed that the deontic square and the modal square both have even\nbetter-known analogs for the quantifiers as interpreted in classical\npredicate logic: \nFig. 6\n [An extended description of figure 6.] \nThough less widely noted in textbooks, there is also a threefold\npartition for classical quantifiers regarding any condition,\n\\(p\\): \nFig. 7\n [An extended description of figure 7.] \nThese quantificational analogies reflect possible inspiration behind\nwhat is most often called “possible worlds semantics” for\nsuch logics, to which we now\n turn.[28]\n Once the analogies are noticed, spelling out this sort of semantics\nseems all but\n inevitable.[29] \nWe choose a standard “Kripke-style” possible world\nsemantics for SDL (Kripke 1959,\n 1963).[30]\n We assume that we have a set of possible worlds, \\(W\\), and a\nrelation, \\(A\\), relating worlds to worlds, with the intention that\n\\(Aij\\) iff \\(j\\) is a world where everything that holds at \\(j\\) is\nacceptable from the standpoint of \\(i\\), so that everything obligatory\nat \\(i\\) holds in \\(j\\). For brevity, we will call all worlds so\nrelated to \\(i\\), “\\(i\\)-acceptable” worlds and denote\nthem by\n \\(A^i\\).[31]\n We then add that the acceptability relation is “serial”:\nfor every world, \\(i\\), there is at least one \\(i\\)-acceptable world.\nFinally, propositions are either true or false at a world, never both,\nand when a proposition, \\(p\\), is true at a world, we will often\nindicate this by referring to that world as a\n“\\(p\\)-world”. The truth-functional operators have their\nusual behavior at each world. \nThe fundamental idea here is that the normative status of a\nproposition from the standpoint of a world \\(i\\) can be assessed by\nlooking at how that proposition fairs at the \\(i\\)-acceptable worlds.\nFor any given world, \\(i\\), we can easily picture the \\(i\\)-accessible\nworlds as all corralled together in logical space, where seriality is\nreflected by a small dot representing the presence of at least one\n\\(i\\)-acceptable world. The intended truth-conditions, relative to\n\\(i\\), for our five deontic operators can now be pictured as\nfollows: \nFig. 8\n [An extended description of figure 8.] \nThus, \\(p\\) is obligatory iff it holds in all the\n\\(i\\)-acceptable worlds, permissible iff it holds in some\nsuch world, impermissible iff it holds in no such world,\nomissible iff its negation holds in some such world,\noptional iff \\(p\\) holds in some such world, and so does\n\\(\\neg p\\), and non-optional when \\(p\\) either holds at\nall such worlds or at none. If a formula is true at every world\nin any such model of serially-related worlds, then the formula is\n valid.[32] \nTo illustrate the workings of this framework, consider NC, \\(\\OB p\n\\rightarrow \\neg \\OB \\neg p\\). This is valid in this framework because\nof seriality. For suppose that \\(\\OB p\\) holds at any world \\(i\\) in\nany model. Then each \\(i\\)-accessible world is one where \\(p\\) holds,\nand by the seriality of accessibility, there must be at least one such\nworld. Call it \\(j\\). Now we can see that \\(\\neg \\OB \\neg p\\) must\nhold at \\(i\\) as well, for otherwise, \\(\\OB \\neg p\\) would hold at\n\\(i\\), in which case, \\(\\neg p\\) would have to hold at all the\n\\(i\\)-accessible worlds, including \\(j\\). But then p as well as \\(\\neg\np\\) would hold at \\(j\\) itself, which is impossible (by the semantics\nfor “\\(\\neg\\)”). The other axioms and rules of SDL can be\nsimilarly shown to be valid, as can all the principles listed above as\nderivable in SDL. \nIn contrast, \\(\\OB\\)-U, the axiom \\(\\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p)\\) that\nwe added to SDL to get SDL+, is not valid in the class of serial\nmodels. In order to validate \\(\\OB\\)-U, we need the further\nrequirement of “secondary seriality”: that any\n\\(i\\)-acceptable world, \\(j\\), must be in turn acceptable to\nitself. We can illustrate such an \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) as follows: \nFig. 9 \nHere we imagine that the arrow connectors indicate relative\nacceptability, thus here, \\(j\\) (and only \\(j)\\) is acceptable to\n\\(i\\), and \\(j\\) (and only \\(j)\\) is acceptable to \\(j\\). If all\nworlds that are acceptable to any given world have this property of\nself-acceptability, then our axiom is valid. For assume that this\nproperty holds throughout our models, and for reductio, suppose that\nfor some arbitrary world \\(i, \\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p)\\) is false at\n\\(i\\). Then not all \\(i\\)-acceptable worlds are worlds where \\(\\OB p\n\\rightarrow p\\) is true. So, there must be an \\(i\\)-acceptable world,\nsay \\(j\\), where \\(\\OB p\\) is true, but \\(p\\) is false. Since \\(\\OB\np\\) is true at \\(j\\), then \\(p\\) must be true at all \\(j\\)-acceptable\nworlds. But by stipulation, \\(j\\) is acceptable to itself, so \\(p\\)\nmust be true at \\(j\\), but this contradicts our assumption that \\(p\\)\nwas false at \\(j\\). Thus \\(\\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p)\\) must be true at\nall worlds, after all. Two counter-models showing that \\(\\OB\\)-U is\nnot derivable in SDL, and that SDL \\(+ \\OB \\OB p \\rightarrow \\OB p\\)\ndoes not imply \\(\\OB\\)-U can be found in supplement D:\n Two Counter-Models Regarding Additions to SDL. \nWe should also note that one alternative semantic picture for SDL is\nwhere we have a set of world-relative ordering relations, one for each\nworld \\(i\\) in W, where \\(j \\ge_i k\\) iff \\(j\\) is as good as \\(k\\)\n(and perhaps better) relative to \\(i\\). We might then assume that from\nthe standpoint of any world \\(i\\), a) each world is as good as itself,\nb) if one is as good as a second, and the second is as good as a\nthird, then the first is as good as the third, c) and for any two\nworlds, either the first is as good as the second or vice versa (i.e.,\nrespectively, each such \\(\\ge_i\\) is reflexive, transitive, and\nconnected in W). As a matter of fact, this approach also determines\nSDL. (See Goble 2003 for one of the few proofs of this claim.) If we\nthen add “The Limit Assumption”, that for each world\n\\(i\\), there is always at least one world as good as all worlds (i.e.,\none \\(i\\)-best world) we can easily generate our earlier semantics for\nSDL derivatively. We need only add the natural analogue here to our\nprior truth-conditions for \\(\\OB\\): \\(\\OB p\\) is true at a world \\(i\\)\niff \\(p\\) is true at all the \\(i\\)-best worlds: \nFig. 10\n [An extended description of figure 10.] \nEssentially, the ordering relation coupled with the limit assumption\njust gives us a way to generate the set of \\(i\\)-acceptable\nworlds instead of taking them as primitive in the semantics: \\(j\\) is\n\\(i\\)-acceptable iff \\(j\\) is \\(i\\)-best. Once generated, we look only\nat what is going on in the \\(i\\)-acceptable (as \\(i\\)-best) worlds to\ninterpret the truth-conditions for the deontic operators, just as with\nour simpler Kripke-Style semantics. The analogue to the seriality of\nour earlier \\(i\\)-acceptability relation is also assured by the Limit\nAssumption, since it entails that for each world \\(i\\), there is\nalways some \\(i\\)-best (so \\(i\\)-acceptable) world. Although this\nordering semantics approach appears to be a bit of overkill here, as\nwe shall see in\n Section 4\n and\n Section 5,\n it became quite important later on in the endeavor to develop\nexpressively richer deontic logics. For now, we turn to the\nsecond-most well-known approach to monadic deontic logic, one in which\nSDL emerges derivatively. \nThe Andersonian-Kangerian reduction is dually-named in\nacknowledgment of Kanger’s and Anderson’s independent\nformulation of it around the same\n time.[33]\n As Hilpinen 2001a points out, the approach is adumbrated much earlier\nin Leibniz. We follow Kanger’s development here, noting\nAnderson’s toward the end. \nAssume that we have a language of classical modal propositional logic,\nwith a distinguished (deontic) propositional constant: \n“\\(d\\)” for “all (relevant) normative demands are\nmet”. \nNow consider the following axiom system, “Kd”: \nKd is just the normal modal logic K with \\(\\Diamond d\\)\n added.[34]\n \\(\\Diamond d\\) is interpreted as telling us that it is possible that\nall normative demands are met. In import when added to system K, it is\nsimilar to (though stronger than) the “No Conflicts” axiom\nof SDL. All of the Traditional Scheme’s deontic\noperators are easily defined derivatively once we provide “the\nreductive clause” for \\(\\OB\\): \nSo in Kd, \\(p\\) is obligatory if \\(p\\) is necessitated\nby all normative demands being met, permissible if \\(p\\) is\ncompatible with all normative demands being met,\nimpermissible if \\(p\\) is incompatible with all normative\ndemands, etc. Since none of the operators of the Traditional Scheme\nare taken as primitive, and the basic logic is a modal logic with\nnecessity and possibility as the primitive modal operators, this is\nreferred to as “a reduction” (of deontic logic to modal\nlogic) \nProofs of SDL-ish formulas are then just K-proofs of the corresponding\nmodal formulae involving\n “\\(d\\)”.[35]\n It is well-known that all theorems of SDL are derivable in Kd\nand conversely, that if some formula in the language of SDL is not a\ntheorem of SDL, then its translation following the Kangerian reduction\nis also not a theorem of\n Kd.[36]\n In addition to containing all theorems of SDL, we note a few theorems\nthat are specific to Kd because of the non-overlapping\nsyntactic ingredients, \\(d, \\Box\\), and \\(\\Diamond\\): \nThese are easily\n derived.[38] \nAlthough our underlying modal system is just K, adding further\nnon-deontic axiom schema (i.e., those that cannot be abbreviated via\nSDL formulas, nor involving \\(d\\) specifically) can nonetheless have a\ndeontic impact. To illustrate, suppose we added a fourth axiom, one to\nthe effect that necessity is truth-implicating, standardly called\naxiom “T”: \nCall the system that results from adding this formula to our current\nsystem “KTd”. The addition of T makes derivable our\npreviously mentioned axiom \\(\\OB\\)-U of SDL+, which we have shown is\nnot derivable in SDL\n itself:[39] \nSo, reflecting on the fact that SDL+ is derivable in KTd, we\nsee that the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction must either rely on a\nnon-truth-implicating conception of necessity in order for its pure\ndeontic fragment to match SDL, or SDL itself is not susceptible to the\nAndersonian-Kangerian reduction. Put another way, the most plausible\nversion of the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction can’t help but\nview “Standard Deontic Logic” as too weak. \nAnderson’s approach is practically equivalent to Kanger’s.\nFirst, consider the fact that we can easily define another constant in\nKd, as follows: \nwhere this new constant would now be derivatively read as follows: \n“some (relevant) normative demand has been violated”. \nClearly our current axiom, \\(\\Diamond d\\), could be replaced with\n\\(\\neg \\Box s\\), asserting that it is not necessary that some\nnormative demand is violated. We could then define \\(\\OB\\) as: \nEssentially, Anderson took this equivalent course with\n“\\(s\\)” being his primitive (initially standing for\nsomething like “the sanction has been invoked” or\n“there is a liability to sanction”), and \\(\\neg \\Box s\\),\nas the axiom added to some modal system (e.g., at least as strong as\nmodal system KT). \nWe should also note that Anderson was famous as a founding figure in\n relevance logic,\n and along with using strict implication, \\(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q)\\),\nhe also explored the use of a relevant (and thus neither material nor\nstrict) form of implication, \\(\\Rightarrow\\), to express the reduction\nas: \\(\\OB p \\eqdf \\neg p \\Rightarrow\n s\\).[40]\n (A bit more on this can be found within the entry on\n Mally’s deontic logic.\n See further references there.) This alternative reflects the fact\nthat there is an issue in both Kanger’s and Anderson’s\nstrict necessitation (or entailment) approaches of just what notion of\n“necessity” is involved in claiming that meetings all\nnormative demands (or avoiding the sanction) in some sense\nnecessitates \\(p\\). \nAs a substantive matter, how should we think of these\n“reductions”? For example, should we view them as giving\nus an analysis of what it is for something to be obligatory?\nTaking Kanger's approach first, it would seem that \\(d\\) must be read\nas a distinctive deontic ingredient, if we are to get the derivative\ndeontic reading for the “reduced” deontic operators. Also,\nas our reading suggests, it is not clear that \\(d\\) does not, at least\nby intention, express a complex quantificational notion involving the\nvery concept of obligation (demand) as a proper part, namely that all\nobligations have been fulfilled, so that the “reduction”,\npresented as an analysis, would appear to be circular. If we\nread \\(d\\) instead as “ideal circumstances obtain”, the\nclaim of a substantive reduction or analysis appears more promising,\nuntil we ask: Are the circumstances ideal only with respect to meeting\nnormative demands or obligations, or are they ideal in other\n(for example supererogatory) ways that go beyond merely satisfying\nnormative demands? Anderson’s “liability to\nsanction” approach may appear more promising, since the idea\nthat something is obligatory if (and only if) and because\nnon-compliance necessitates (in some sense) liability to (or perhaps\ndesert of) punishment does not appear to be circular (unless the\nnotion of “liability” itself ultimately involves the idea\nof permissibility of punishment), but is it plausible? Alternatively,\nperhaps a norm that is merely an ideal cannot be\nviolated, in which case perhaps norms that have been\nviolated can be distinguished (as a subset) from norms that\nhave not been complied with, and then the notion of an\nobligation as something that must obtain unless some norm is violated\nwill not be obviously circular. There is a substantive philosophical\nquestion lingering here that the language of a “reduction”\nbrings naturally to the surface, but is sloughed over. The formal\nutility of the reduction does not hinge on this, but its philosophical\nsignificance does. \nThe semantic elements here are in large part analogous to those for\nSDL. We have a binary relation again, but this time instead of a\nrelation interpreted as relating worlds acceptable to a given\nworld, here we will have a relation, \\(R\\), relating worlds\n“accessible” to a given world (e.g., possible relative to\nthe given world). The only novelties are two: (1) we add a simple\nsemantic element to match our syntactic constant “\\(d\\)”,\nand (2) we add a slightly more complex analog to seriality, one that\nlinks the accessibility relation to the semantic element added in\norder to model \\(d\\). \nOnce again, assume that we have a set of possible worlds, \\(W\\), and\nwe assume that we have a relation, \\(R\\), relating worlds to worlds,\nwith the intention that \\(Rij\\) iff \\(j\\) is accessible to \\(i\\)\n(e.g., \\(j\\) is a world where everything true in \\(j\\) is possible\nrelative to\n \\(i\\).[41]\n For brevity, we will call all worlds possible relative to \\(i\\),\n“\\(i\\)-accessible worlds” and denote them by\n\\(R^i\\). For the moment, no restrictions are placed on the relation\n\\(R\\). We can illustrate the truth-conditions for necessity, and\npossibility with obvious abbreviations, as follows: \nFig. 11\n [An extended description of figure 11.] \nHere we imagine that for any given world, \\(i\\), we have corralled all\nthe \\(i\\)-accessible worlds together. We then simply look at the\nquantificational status of \\(p\\) (and/or \\(\\neg p)\\) in these\n\\(i\\)-accessible worlds to determine \\(p\\)’s modal status back\nat \\(i\\). For example\\(,\\) at a given world \\(i, p\\) is\nnecessary if \\(p\\) holds throughout \\(R^i\\) and\npossible if \\(p\\) holds somewhere in \\(R^i\\). \nThe only deontic element in the syntax of Kd is our\ndistinguished constant, \\(d\\), intended to express the fact that all\nnormative demands are met\\(.\\) To model that feature, we simply assume\nthat the worlds are divided into those where all normative demands are\nmet and those that are not. We denote the former subset of worlds by\n“DEM” in a model. Then \\(d\\) is true at a world \\(j\\) iff\n\\(j\\) belongs to DEM. Here is a picture where \\(d\\) is true at an\narbitrary world, \\(j\\): \nFig. 12\n [An extended description of figure 12.] \nSince \\(j\\) is contained in DEM, that means all normative demands are\nmet at\n \\(j\\).[42] \nCorresponding to simple seriality for SDL (that there is always an\n\\(i\\)-acceptable world), we assume what I will call “strong\nseriality” for Kd: for every world \\(i\\), there is an\n\\(i\\)-accessible world that is among those where all normative demands\nare met. In other words, for every world \\(i\\), the intersection of\nthe \\(i\\)-accessible worlds with DEM is non-empty. Given the truth\nconditions for \\(d\\), strong seriality validates \\(\\Diamond d\\),\nensuring that for any world \\(i\\), there is always some\n\\(i\\)-accessible world where \\(d\\) is true: \nFig. 13\n [An extended description of figure 13.] \nGiven these semantic elements, if you apply them carefully to the\ndefinitions of the deontic operators of Kd, you will see that\nin each case, the normative status of \\(p\\) at \\(i\\) depends on\n\\(p\\)’s relationship to this intersection of the i-accessible\nworlds and the worlds where all normative demands are met: \nFig. 14\n [An extended description of figure 14.] \nIf that intersection is permeated by \\(p\\)-worlds, \\(p\\) is\nobligatory; if it contains some \\(p\\)-world, \\(p\\) is permissible,\n etc.[43] \nIf we wish to validate T, \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow p\\) (and derivatively,\n\\(\\OB\\)-U, \\((\\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p))\\), we need only stipulate\nthat the accessibility relation, R, is reflexive: that each world\n\\(i\\) is \\(i\\)-accessible (possible relative to itself): \nFig. 15 \nFor then \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow p\\) must be true at any world \\(i\\), for\nif \\(\\Box p\\) is true at \\(i\\), then \\(p\\) is true at each\n\\(i\\)-accessible world, which includes \\(i\\), since \\(i\\) is\nself-accessible. This will indirectly yield the result that \\(\\OB (\\OB\np \\rightarrow p)\\) is true in all such models as well. \nHaving introduced deontic logic’s classical points of departure,\nwe now turn to a number of problems, paradoxes, and related logics\nthat are studied in the field today. Here, our aim is mainly to map\nout the various topics that are central stage in deontic logic; for\nreasons of space, we cannot present theories or logics in much\ndetail. \nConsider the following four premises (Chisholm 1963a) and their most\nstraightforward symbolization in SDL: \n(1)–(4) certainly appear to describe a possible situation. They\nappear to constitute both a mutually consistent and\nlogically independent set of sentences. Note that (1) is a\nprimary obligation, saying what Jones ought to do\nunconditionally. (2) is a compatible-with-duty obligation,\ntelling us what else Jones ought to do on the condition that Jones\nfulfills his primary obligation. In contrast, (3) is a\ncontrary-to-duty obligation or “imperative” (a\n“CTD”) expressing what Jones ought to do\nconditional on his violating his primary obligation. (4) is a factual\nclaim, which conjoined with (1), implies that Jones violates\nhis primary obligation. Thus this puzzle also places not only deontic\nconditional constructions, but the violability of\nobligations, at center stage. It raises the challenging question: what\nconstitutes proper reasoning about what to do in the face of\nviolations of obligations? \nOne obvious answer would be: just apply SDL to\n(1′)–(4′) above. The following table displays the\ndifficulties in trying in to interpret the reasoning in SDL: \nFrom (1′), (2′), \\(\\OB t.\\)\n\nFrom (3′), (4′), \\(\\OB \\neg t.\\)\n\nBy NC, consistency is lost. \n(1′) implies (3″ ). \nIndependence is lost. \n(4′) implies (2″). \nIndependence is lost. \nThe first path, as Chisholm notes, leads to contradiction via\n\\(\\OB\\)-K, MP and NC. The second and third paths take a different\nroute, interpreting the conditionals in (2) and (3) uniformly.\nHowever, for the second path, the symbolization of (3) follows from\nthat of (1), and for the third path, the symbolization of (2) follows\nfrom that of (4). Each SDL symbolization of the original violates one\nof our desiderata: either mutual consistency or joint\nindependence. \nIf von Wright launched deontic logic as an academic area of research,\nChisholm’s paradox, and similar cases, were the booster rocket\nthat provided the escape velocity deontic logic needed from\n subsumption\n under normal modal logics, thus solidifying deontic logic’s\nstatus as a distinct branch of\n logic.[44]\n It is now virtually universally acknowledged that Chisholm was right:\nthe sort of conditional deontic claim expressed in (3) can’t be\nfaithfully represented in SDL, nor more generally by a composite of\nsome sort of unary deontic operator and material conditional.\nThe views diverge however where it comes to exactly what should be\nadded to SDL in order to represent conditional obligations. This\ndivergence in turn relates to a distinction between two types of\ndetachment in deontic\n reasoning.[45] \nLet “\\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\)” be shorthand for a conditional\nobligation or ought statement like that in the natural language\nsentence, (3), above. So we will read \\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) as “if\n\\(p\\), then it ought to be (or it is obligatory) that \\(q\\)”.\nSuppose we also assume that monadic obligations are disguised dyadic\nobligations, per the following analysis: \nThis analysis has been widely\n employed.[46] \nWith this in mind, we distinguish between two relevant types\nof“detachment principles” (Greenspan 1975) that we might\nascribe to these iffy-‘ought’s: \nFactual detachment tells us that from \\(p\\), and a deontic\nconditional to the effect that if \\(p\\) then it ought to be that\n\\(q\\), we can conclude that it ought to be that \\(q\\). Deontic\nDetachment in contrast tells us that from it ought to be that\n\\(p\\) and if \\(p\\), then it ought to be that \\(q\\), we can conclude\nthat it ought to be that \\(q\\). If we interpret a deontic conditional\nas a material conditional with an obligatory consequent (as in\n(3′) above), FD, but not DD is supported. Conversely, if we\ninterpret deontic conditionals as obligatory material conditionals (as\nin (2′) above), DD, but not FD is supported. Although we have\nshown earlier that neither of these interpretations is acceptable, the\ncontrast reveals a general problem. Unrestricted endorsement of both\ntypes of detachment is not tenable, since it leads implausibly to the\nconclusion that Jones is both obligated to tell (the neighbor he is\ncoming) and obligated to not tell. Thus researchers tended to part\ncompany over which principle of the two to endorse (Loewer and Belzer\n1983). \nThe Factual Detachment camp typically endorses the view that the\nconditional in (3) in the Chisholm Quartet needs to be interpreted as\na non-material conditional, but otherwise things are as they seem in\n(3): we have a conditional obligation that is a simple composite of a\nnon-material conditional and a pure unary deontic operator in the\nconsequent: \n\\(\\OB (q\\mid p) \\eqdf p \\Rightarrow \\OB q\\), for some independent\n conditional.[48] \nTypically, the conditional \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is of the sort made famous\nby Stalnaker and Lewis (Stalnaker 1968, Lewis\n 1973).[49]\n It is then generally maintained that deontic detachment is flawed,\nsince the conditional obligations like those in (2) tell us only what\nto do in ideal circumstances, but they do not necessarily provide\n “cues”[50]\n for action in the actual world, where things are often\ntypically quite sub-ideal, as (4) combined with (1) indicate. Thus\nfrom the fact that Jones ought to go and he ought to tell if he goes,\nit doesn’t follow that what he ought to actually do is\ntell—that would be so only if it was also a fact that he goes to\ntheir aid. At best, we can only say that he ought ideally to\ngo. \nThis suggestion seems a bit more difficult when we change the\nconditional to something like “If Doe does kill his mother, then\nit is obligatory that Doe kills her gently” (Forrester 1984).\nThe idea that my obligation to not kill my mother gently (say for an\ninheritance) merely expresses an “ideal” obligation, but\nnot an actual obligation, given that I will kill her, seems hard to\nswallow. So this case makes matters a bit harder for those favoring a\nfactual detachment approach for generating actual obligations.\nSimilarly, it would seem that if it is impermissible for me to kill my\nmother, then it is impermissible for me to do so gently, or to do so\nwhile\n dancing.[51]\n So carte blanche factual detachment seems to allow the mere\nfact that I will take an action in the future (killing my mother) that\nis horribly wrong and completely avoidable now to render obligatory\nanother horrible (but slightly less horrible) action in the future\n(killing my mother gently). The latter action must be completely\navoidable if the former is, and the latter action is one that I would\nseem to be equally obligated to not perform intuitively. \nThe deontic detachment camp represented conditional obligations via\ndyadic non-composite obligation operators modeled syntactically on\nconditional probability, following Danielsson 1968; B. Hansson 1969;\nvon Wright 1956, 1964; Lewis 1973, 1974; and Feldman\n 1986.[52]\n On this view, deontic conditionals are viewed as idioms: the meaning\nof the compound is not a straightforward function of the meaning of\nthe parts. The underlying intuition regarding the Chisholm example is\nthat even if it might be true that we will violate some obligation,\nthat doesn’t get us off the hook from obligations that derive\nfrom the original one that we will violate. If I must go help and I\nmust inform my neighbors that I’m coming, if I do go help, then\nI must inform them, and the fact that I will in fact violate the\nprimary obligation does not block the derivative obligation any more\nthan it blocks the primary obligation. \nOne early semantic picture for the latter camp was that a sentence of\nthe form \\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) is true at a world \\(i\\) iff the \\(i\\)-best\n\\(p\\)-worlds are all \\(q\\)-worlds. \\(\\OB q\\) is then true iff \\(\\OB\n(q\\mid \\top),\\) and so iff all the unqualifiedly \\(i\\)-best worlds are\n\\(q\\)-worlds (B. Hansson 1969). Note that this weds preference-based\nsemantic orderings with dyadic conditional\n obligations.[53]\n This reflects a widespread trend. Factual detachment does not work in\nthis case, since even if our world is an I-don’t-go-help-world,\nand the best among the I-don’t-go-help-worlds are\nI-don’t-call-worlds, it does not follow that the\nunqualifiedly best worlds are I-don’t-call-worlds. In\nthis example, these authors would maintain that the unqualifiedly best\nworlds are both I-go worlds and I-call worlds, and the fact that I\nwon’t do what I’m supposed to do won’t change\nthat. \nBut one is compelled to ask those in the Deontic Detachment camp: what\nthen is the point of such apparent conditionals if we can’t ever\ndetach them from their apparent antecedents, and how are these\nconditionals related to regular ones? This seems to be the central\nchallenge for this camp. Thus they often endorse a restricted form of\nfactual detachment, of which the following is a representative\ninstance: \nHere \\(\\Box p\\) might mean various things, for example that \\(p\\) is\nphysically unalterable or necessary as of this moment in\n history.[54]\n Only if \\(p\\) is settled true in some sense, can we conclude from\n\\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) that \\(\\OB q\\). This certainly helps, but it still\nleaves us with a bit of a puzzle about why this apparent composite of\na conditional and a deontic operator is actually some sort of\nprimitive\n idiom.[55] \nWhile conditional obligations and the puzzles they generate call for\nextensions of SDL, other problems and distinctions in normative\ndiscourse motivate further, mostly orthogonal enrichments. In this\nsection we point to a few of these. \nEven among monadic deontic notions, and even if we stay within the\nrealm of all-things-considered, unconflicted obligations (cf.\n Section 6.3),\n SDL displays various expressive weaknesses compared to our everyday\nand more theorized ethical argumentation. \nLet us start with the distinction between indifference and\n optionality.[56]\n In general, optionality of a given state of affairs or\naction need not imply that it is morally indifferent. For instance, it\nmay be optional that you attend a faculty meeting, but not a matter of\nindifference that you do so. However, when deontic logicians and\nethicists gave an operator label for the condition \\((\\neg \\OB p \\amp\n\\neg \\OB \\neg p)\\), it was almost invariably “It is indifferent\nthat \\(p\\)”, “\\(\\IN p\\)”. It would seem to follow\nfrom the theorem \nthat \nthat is, everything that is neither obligatory nor prohibited is a\nmatter of indifference. But many actions are neither obligatory nor\nprohibited, yet they are hardly matters of indifference. A\nparticularly intriguing class of such actions are those that are\ndeemed supererogatory (e.g., volunteering for a costly or risky good\nendeavor where others are equally qualified and no one person is\nobligated). SDL can represent optionality, but not indifference,\ndespite the fact that the latter concept has been a purported target\nfor representation since nearly its beginning. \nThe distinction between optionality and indifference is moreover\nstrongly linked to that between “must” (and its dual\n“can”) and \n “ought”.[57]\n Consider the following utterance: \nThis seems to be a perfectly sensible piece of advice. (1) appears to\nimply that it is optional that you attend—that you can\nattend and that you can fail to attend. The latter two uses\nof “can” express permissibility. Yet “ought”\nis routinely the reading given for deontic necessity in deontic logic\n(and in ethical theory), and then “permissibility” is\nroutinely presented as its dual. However, if we symbolize (1) above\naccordingly, we get, \nwhich is just \\(\\neg \\OB p \\amp \\OB p\\) in disguise (given \\(\\OB\\)-RE\nand the Traditional Definitional Scheme). So (1′), given NC,\nyields a contradiction. Another way to put this is that the\n“can” of permissibility seems to be the dual of\n“must” not the dual of “ought”. This yields a\ndilemma: either deontic necessity represents “ought”, in\nwhich case, its dual does not represent permissibility (and neither\ndoes any other construction in SDL), or permissibility is represented,\nbut “ought” is inexpressible, despite the ubiquitous\nassumption otherwise. That “ought” is the dual of\npermissibility is really a largely overlooked dubious yet pervasive\nbipartisan presupposition in both ethical theory and deontic\n logic.[58] \nA widely neglected normative notion is exemplified by the following\n complaint:[59] \nThe expression in the second clause of (LYCD), i.e., “the least\nyou could do”, has been largely ignored in the literature on\ndeontic logic and ethical theory both. (LYCD) appears to express the\nidea that there is some minimal but acceptable alternative. This\nnotion of what is minimally acceptable among the permissible options\nis not expressible in SDL. \nTo go beyond the call of duty or to supererogate is to permissibly do\nmore than you would do if you did the least you could \n do.[60]\n It has a\nmirror image, permissible suboptimality, or that which you\ncan but ought not do. These are plainly not representable in SDL,\ngiven the preceding remarks. \nMcNamara 1996c and Mares & McNamara 1997 provides a semantic and\nlogical framework for distinguishing “must” from\n“ought”, indifference from optionality, as well as\ndistinctly representing “the least you can do” idiom and\nanalyzing one central sense of “supererogation” via that\notherwise unstudied idiom. As a measure of the increased expressive\npower, the three-fold partition of normative positions for SDL is\nextended to a twelve-fold partition; with an extension to accommodate\npraiseworthiness and blameworthiness (McNamara 2011a,b), an\neighty-four fold partition results. See McNamara forthcoming for a\nthorough introduction to this area of research. \nWe routinely talk about both what ought to be and what people\nought to do. These hardly look like the same things (for\nexample, the latter notion calls for an agent, the former does not).\nThis issue, and the general issue of representing agency in deontic\nlogic has been much discussed, and continues to be an area of active\nconcern. In the present section we provide an overview of the\nliterature on deontic logics that allow for the expression of agency;\nin\n Section 6.2\n we consider a more fundamental revision of SDL in order to\naccommodate deontic claims about actions. \nLet us start by introducing some basics from the logical study of\n agency.[61]\n Here, the idea is that we treat expressions of the type “x\nbrings it about that” or “x sees to it that” as\nagent-indexed modal operators. Focusing, as we will do here, on the\ncase of a single agent called Jane Doe, let us introduce the following\nnotation: \nThen the following claims expressing Jane Doe’s agency with\nrespect to a proposition p are to be distinguished: \nPlainly, if neither of the first two hold, then the conjunction of the\nlast two holds. In such a case we might say that Jane Doe is\npassive with respect to \\(p\\), or more adequately, passive\nwith respect to herself bringing about p or its\n negation.[63]\n Let’s introduce \\(\\PV\\) as an abbreviation for\n this:[64] \nSee also supplement E:\n Non-Performance versus Refraining/Forbearing. \nHaving thus enriched our propositional language, we can now consider\nsome logical principles for the new operator. Virtually all accounts\ntake it to satisfy the rule for replacement of equivalents: \nIf \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) is a theorem, so is \\(\\BA p \\leftrightarrow\n\\BA q\\) (\\(\\BA\\)-RE), \nas well as the truth scheme, \nTaken together, these principles entail that, relative to a fixed\nproposition \\(p\\) and an agent, a threefold partition emerges: \nFig. 16 \nReturning to deontic matters, we can now ask: how do we represent\nagential obligation? With an agency operator in hand, we might invoke\nthe famous Meinong-Chisholm Reduction: the idea that what\nJane ought to do is what it ought to be that she\n does.[66]\n If we regiment this a bit using our operator for agency, we get the\nfollowing versions of the “reduction”: \nMeinong-Chisholm Reduction: Jane Doe is obligated to bring it\nabout that \\(p\\) iff it is obligatory that Jane Doe brings it about\nthat \\(p\\). \nThis is sometimes taken to be a reduction of personal, agentive\nobligation to impersonal obligation on the one hand, and (mere) agency\non the other. In terms of modal operators, it is a reduction of\n“ought to do” to “ought to be” and\n“brings it about\n that”.[67]\n Although not uncontested (cf. Section 5.2.4 below), by relying on\nthis analysis we can make many fine distinctions. Suppose, for\ninstance, that “Jane Doe lights the candle” is equivalent\nto “Jane Doe sees to it that the candle is lit”, and let\n“the candle is lit” be represented by p. Then we can\ndistinguish the following claims, while keeping track of their formal\ninterrelations: \nHere, (2′) would, e.g., express that Jane Doe is positively\nobligated to not bring it about that \\(p\\); note that this need not\npreclude that some other agent can still bring it about that \\(p\\), or\nthat \\(p\\) is in itself obligatory. Note also that (2′) is\ndistinct from (5′), which merely expresses that it is not\nrequired of Jane Doe that she lights the candle. That is, Jane’s\nlighting the candle would be a violation of (2), but not of (5). (3)\nis, on most accounts of agency and obligation, strictly stronger than\n(2): (3) implies not only that Jane should not light the candle, but\nthat she should bring it about that no one else lights the candle\neither (e.g., by keeping it in some locked box). \nLogics that combine operators for (impersonal) obligation and agency\nhave been very widely\n employed.[68]\n Krogh and Herrestad 1996 reinterpret the Meinong-Chisholm analysis so\nthat the deontic operator is personal, yet not agential. This\nis arguably a more plausible way to preserve a componential analysis\nof agential obligation. McNamara 2004a also makes the case that a\nperson’s being obligated to be such that a certain condition\nholds (e.g., being obligated to be at home at noon, as promised) is\nthe more basic idiom, and being obligated to bring about something is\njust being obligated to be such that you do bring it about. \nOne way in which agency operators have been fruitfully employed is in\nthe study of what are called normative\n positions.[69]\n A set of normative positions is intended to describe the set of\nmutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive positions that a person or\nset of persons may be in regarding a proposition and with respect to a\nlogic governing a set of selected primitive normative statuses and/or\nagency operators. Recall the partition regarding how Jane Doe may be\npositioned agentially with respect to \\(p\\): she may either bring\nabout \\(p\\), bring about its negation, or be passive with respect to\n\\(p\\). Now also recall our partition with respect obligation from\n Section 1: \nFig. 17  \nWe might consider “merging” these two partitions, as it\nwere, and try to get a representation of the possible ways Jane Doe\nmay be positioned normatively with respect to her agency regarding\n\\(p\\). Given certain choices of logic for \\(\\BA\\) and for \\(\\OB\\), we\nobtain a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive “normative\npositions”: \nThe Meinong-Chisholm analysis that lies at the core of the theory of\nnormative positions is, however, not uncontested. Following an earlier\ncriticism by Geach (1982), in the third chapter of the influential monograph,\nHorty (2001), Horty has attacked one specific form of the\nMeinong-Chisholm reduction from a semantic viewpoint. Recall that in\nthe standard semantics for SDL, for any formula p, \\(\\OB\\)p is true\nwhenever p holds at all the deontically best alternatives. Horty shows\nthat, when combined with the STIT semantics for agency championed in\nBelnap et al. 2001, this gives rise to counterintuitive\n cases.[70]\n Suppose, e.g., that an agent can choose between two things: to gamble\nor not to gamble. Simplifying somewhat, say all possible states of\naffairs are ones where either the agent gambles, or he doesn’t.\nIf the agent gambles, there is a possibility that he wins $5, but\nthere is also a possibility that he loses the $5 he currently has. If\nhe doesn’t gamble, then he keeps his money but cannot make any\nprofit. Now, granting that worlds where one has more money are better\nthan worlds where one has less, the best worlds are those where the\nagent wins $5. Consequently, the best worlds are worlds in which the\nagent does gamble. Hence, where g denotes that the agent gambles, \nis true in this case. Yet intuitively, it is not true that the agent\nought to gamble. Absent further information, gambling and not gambling\nboth have their pros and cons in this case, and hence one would not\nmake any recommendation for\n either.[71]\n More generally, Horty takes this example to show that from “it\nought to be that the agent brings about \\(p\\)”, it does not\nfollow that “the agent ought to bring about\n \\(p\\)”.[72] \nHorty’s argument has been criticized from various angles: one\nmay, e.g., question whether the same applies to non-standard semantics\nfor \\(\\OB\\) (Broersen & van der Torre 2003; McNamara 2004b), or\none may argue that very similar issues also arise in context where no\nagency is involved (Danielsson 2002). Finally, it should be noted that\nat the syntactic level, relatively little changes to the basic\nproperties of the (now agent-relative) operator \\(\\OB\\): it will still\nbe a KD-type normal modal operator. However, its interaction with\nother such modal operators, and the relation between obligations of\ndifferent agents and groups can now be studied in much more\nfine-grained\n terms.[73]\n Moreover, Horty’s incorporation of game-theoretic ideas into\nthe semantics of deontic logic opens up a whole range of new\npossibilities for logical investigations, a suggestion from Bartha\n2002 that was taken up in Tamminga 2013. \nAnother issue that has been disputed in this context is whether or not\ndeontic operators necessarily call for agential complements or \n not.[74]\n Consider the \nStrict Deontic Complement Thesis (SDCT): Each fundamental\ndeontic status must be followed immediately by an operator ascribing\nagency to an agent (here, by “\\(\\BA\\)”) to be\nwell-formed. \nA strict omission (refraining) is now a formula of the form\n\\(\\RF p\\) (i.e., \\(\\BA \\neg \\BA p)\\). “\\(\\neg \\BA p\\)” is\njust a non-action. Strict deontic omissions are\ndeontic operators immediately followed by strict omissions. Note that\nif we substitute “\\(\\BA p\\)” for “\\(p\\)” in\nthe equivalences associated with the Traditional Definitional Scheme,\nwe obtain formulas that violate SDCT. For instance, the first schema\nwould yield \nEssentially, non-action statements would have to be replaced by strict\nomissions. \nBelnap et al. 2001 provisionally defends SDCT. McNamara 2004a raises\ndoubts about this thesis. He notes that we are sometimes obligated to\nbe a certain way (e.g., to be in our office), and furthermore, it is\nplausible to think that agential obligations reduce to these stative\nobligations— obligations to be the agents of states of affairs,\nso that obligations to be a certain way are analytically prior to\nagential obligations. A related issue is whether there can be cases\nwhere a certain person \\(i\\) faces a given obligation, but these\nobligations can (in principle or even in practice) be fulfilled by\nsome other person \\(j\\)—and hence, they are not, strictly\nspeaking, agential obligations for \\(i\\) (Krogh & Herrestad 1996;\nMcNamara 2004a). \nAside from the preceding operators in this section, there are a number\nof other types of modal operators one could sensibly add to a given\ndeontic logic. Far from being exhaustive, let us just give a few\nexamples and mention well-known issues that arise from such\nenrichments. \nIn some normative systems (e.g., legal systems), explicit permissions,\nprohibitions and obligations are given. So it would seem to be\npossible for there to be normative systems with gaps: systems where\nsomething is neither explicitly obligatory, impermissible, nor\npermissible because, say, it is neither explicitly commanded,\nprohibited or permitted by the relevant authority. For instance, it\nmay well have been undecided, legally speaking, whether storing\nsomeone’s search data on a website was permissible or not prior\nto any new law being cast to regulate this practice. Yet \\(\\OB p\n\\vee(\\PE p \\amp \\PE \\neg p) \\vee \\IM p\\) is a thesis\n(“exhaustion”) of SDL (given the Traditional Definitional\nScheme), which makes any such gaps impossible. There is no place for\nthis fourth category in SDL, as it does not allow for such\nnormative gaps (von Wright\n 1968).[75]\n SDL is not designed to represent a notion of explicitly stated\nobligations, permissions, etc. \nOne way to accommodate gaps, without revising the Traditional\nDefinitional Scheme or the underlying logic of the classical\nconnectives, is by enriching SDL with a modal operator \\(\\NS\\) that\nrefers explicitly to the normative system at hand: \\(\\NS\\OB p\\) then\nmeans something like “according to the normative system, \\(p\\)\nis obligatory”. Normative gaps can be expressed by such\nsentences as \nNote that this is perfectly consistent with the claim \nwhich just says that according to the normative system, the\nproposition \\(p\\) is either obligatory, optional, or\n impermissible.[76] \nOther types of modalities that display interesting interaction with\ndeontic notions are temporal modalities. For instance, it is plausible\nto think that one is obligated to do something only if that\nthing is in the future. This suggests that the deontic necessity\noperator quantifies over states that form a subset of the set of all\nfuture states; and hence a principle of the type \nshould hold. Similar observations can be made in terms of the\nAndersonian-Kangerian reduction of SDL. If we read the deontic\nconstant \\(d\\) atemporally as “all obligations past, present,\nand future are met”, then the only relevant worlds are those so\nideal that in them there has never been a single violation of a\nmandatory norm. But as a parent, I may be obligated to lock the front\ndoor at night even though this would not be a norm unless there had\nbeen past violations of other norms (e.g., against theft and murder).\nPeople also acquire obligations over time, create them for themselves\nand for others, discharge them,\n etc.[77] \nFinally, one may also combine deontic and epistemic or doxastic\nlogics. Such combinations may serve two distinct aims: to capture\ndistinctively epistemic obligations such as “Jane ought to know\nthat there is no cure to this illness (as she is a doctor)”, or\nto study subjective, knowledge-dependent obligations as in\n“Given what you know about their production, you ought not to\nbuy these clothes”. For a famous puzzle concerning the first\ntype of extension, see supplement F on\n the Paradox of Epistemic Obligation. \nFor the second type of extension, a recent puzzle that has received\nmuch attention is the so-called Miners Paradox (Kolodny &\nMacFarlane 2010; Parfit ms. [see\n Other Internet Resources]).\n A proposal for dealing with the latter in the context of deontic STIT\nlogic can be found in Horty 2019; earlier proposals for dealing with\nknowledge-based obligations are Pacuit, Parikh and Cogan 2006 and\nBroersen 2008. Clearly, however fundamental the monadic operators\nrepresented in SDL, they are but a fragment of those employed in\nnormative discourse. \nWhen one meets a problem in formalizing certain aspects of reasoning\nvia a given formal system (e.g., SDL), one may diagnose the situation\nin two different ways: as caused by a lack of expressive power in the\nformalism, one that can be remedied by augmentation, or as a\nfundamental problem with the initial formalism itself calling for\nmodification or replacement of the initial formalism. In the present\nsection, we survey some attempts to revise the foundations of deontic\nlogic, in view of specific puzzles related to SDL and its\nextensions. \nA view still held by some researchers within deontic logic and\nmeta-ethics, and particularly popular in the first few decades\nfollowing the emergence of positivism, was that evaluative sentences\nare not the sort of sentences that can be either true or false. If\nthat view is correct, we seem to be facing a dilemma. On the one hand,\nit seems there can be no logic of normative sentences, since logic is\nthe study of what follows from what, and one thing can follow from\nanother only if the things in question are of the sort that can be\neither true or false. So there can be no deontic logic. On the other\nhand, some normative sentences do seem to follow from others, and\nthere appear to be logical relations between distinct (possibly\nlogically complex) deontic statements, so there can be deontic logic\nafter all. What to do? This is Jörgensen’s dilemma. \nA widespread distinction that was put forward in an attempt to\novercome the dilemma is that between a norm and a\nnormative\n proposition.[78]\n Consider a normative sentence such as “You may park here for\none hour”. This sentence may be used by an authority to provide\npermission on the spot or it may be used by a passerby to report on an\nalready existing norm (e.g., a standing municipal regulation). The\nactivity of using a normative sentence as in the first case is\nsometimes referred to as “norming”—it creates a norm\nby granting permission by the very use of the sentence. The second use\nis often said to be descriptive, since the sentence is then not used\nto grant permission, but to report that permission to do so is a\nstanding state. It is often maintained that the two uses are mutually\nexclusive, and only the latter use allows for truth or falsity. Some\nhave however challenged the exclusiveness of the division, by blending\nsemantics and speech-act theory (especially regarding performatives).\nThey thereby suggest that one who is in authority to grant a\npermission can not only grant it by performing the speech act of\nuttering the relevant sentence (as in the first example), but also\nthereby makes what it said true— that the person is\npermitted to park (as in the second example with the\n passerby)).[79] \nIf one agrees that norm-propositions are distinct from norms, one may\ninsist that the realm of deontic logic is limited to\nnorm-propositions, perhaps interpreted with a standard semantics in\nterms of truth at possible worlds. Where some normative system, \\(n\\),\nis the basis in some state, \\(w\\), for a set of normative\npropositions, one could just say that \\(\\OB p\\) is true at a state,\n\\(w\\), in virtue of the fact that according to the norms in \\(n\\) that\napply in \\(w\\), \\(p\\) is required. However, this still leaves a\nJörgensenian gap: it remains unclear what it means that a set of\nnorms requires a certain state of affairs (given the way the world\ncurrently is). Isn’t there still a need for a framework to model\nsystems of norms, their possible structural features, and how they\ngenerate normative propositions? If a normative system \\(n\\) requires\n\\(p\\) and \\(n\\) also requires \\(q\\), how does it do so, and\ndoes it then also require \\((p \\amp q)\\), and if so, in virtue of\nwhat features of\n \\(n\\)?[80] \nAn alternative route is to give up on truth-functional (possible\nworld) semantics. One may, e.g., assume a primitive notion of\n“norms” (sometimes also called “imperatives”),\nwhich generate “obligations” in a purely syntactic\nfashion. Originating in the work on conflict-tolerant deontic logics\n(van Fraassen 1973, cf. Hansen 2008 and Hansen 2013), this route\nbecame most influential under the banner of Input/Output logic\n(Makinson & van der Torre 2000, 2001; Parent & van der Torre\n2013). The “semantics” of I/O-logics is purely\noperational: it specifies a set of obligations (propositional\nformulas) that result from the application of factual detachment to\n(a) a set of factual statements (closed under PC) and (b) a set of\nconditional norms, i.e., pairs of propositional formulas, closed under\na given set of logical rules, R. Variations regarding R give rise to\nvarious “input/output relations” (hence, I/O-logics). See\nParent and van der Torre 2018 for a short primer. \nThe I/O-logic framework has proven useful in a number of respects: it\nputs factual detachment where, for many, it belongs: at the very core\nof deontic reasoning. It allows for many fine-grained distinctions and\nnuanced accounts of the interplay between detachment and logical\nreasoning about facts and norms that seem hard to characterize in\nterms of classical possible worlds-semantics. Finally, it can\naccommodate various notions of permission and their relation to\nobligation (Makinson & van der Torre 2003). On the downside, how\nto integrate a procedural semantics from I/O-logic with semantics for\nepistemic logics, logics of agency, and the like is far from obvious.\nMore generally, since in I/O-logic the notion of obligation\nis—by definition—one of an “output”, it is\nunclear how, e.g., truth-functional connectives or other modal\noperators can be applied to statements concerning obligation (e.g., it\nis believed that murder is wrong and sometimes done), or what a nested\nstatement like “it is permissible that it is obligatory that\np” would mean in this\n framework.[81] \nWe often apply terms such as “must”, “ought”,\nand “can” to actions rather than to states of affairs. For\ninstance, we would say that “Jimmy must tie his\nshoelaces”, rather than “it is obligatory (for Jimmy) that\nJimmy’s shoelaces are tied”. Likewise, we make claims such\nas “Jack must get the groceries” and “you can turn\nleft here”. In each of these three examples, it seems we signal\nthe deontic status of a certain action— an agent-initiated\nway of changing the current world, or bringing it into a\ndifferent state. However, the by now common reading of\nSDL—deviating from von Wright’s original interpretation\n(recall\n supplement B, von Wright’s 1951a System and SDL),\n has it that we can always apply the deontic modals to propositions\ninstead. \nVarious semantics have been developed in which deontic terms are\napplied directly to actions, conceived as transitions between states\nin a Kripke-model. For instance, following the reduction of SDL to\nalethic modal logic (cf.\n Section 3),\n Meyer 1988 adds an Andersonian “violation” constant V to\n propositional dynamic logic\n (PDL). In this framework, [\\(\\alpha\\)]V expresses that executing the\naction \\(\\alpha\\) necessarily leads to a violation, hence,\n“\\(\\alpha\\) is forbidden”. Where \\(-\\alpha\\) denotes the\nnegation of action \\(\\alpha\\), [\\(-\\alpha\\)]V then represents that\n\\(\\alpha\\) is\n obligatory.[82]\n Note that intuitively, this formula can be read as: “whenever\n\\(\\alpha\\) is not carried out, a violation occurs”.\nAlternatively, one may define a notion of strong\npermissibility of an action \\(\\alpha\\), by introducing a Kangerian\nconstant “OK” and expressing that \\(\\alpha\\) is strongly\npermissible by [\\(\\alpha\\)]OK. This means, intuitively, that whenever\none executes the action \\(\\alpha\\), then one is guaranteed to end up\nin a world that is deontically acceptable (no violation\n occurs).[83] \nMeyer’s analysis reduces the deontic status of a given action\n(at a given state w) to the occurrence of violations in its terminal\nstates (reachable from w through that action), giving rise to\nso-called “goal norms”. In contrast, one may also consider\n“process norms” that concern all the intermediate states\nthat are “passed by” when carrying out a given action at a\nstate. Deontic logics of the latter type have been proposed in van der\nMeyden 1996; see Broersen 2004, Kulicki and Trypuz 2017, Canavotto and\nGiordani 2019 for discussions of this distinction. \nA different approach to actions in deontic logic originates in\nSegerberg 1982, and further developed inter alia in Kulicki\nand Trypuz 2017. Here, a Boolean algebra of actions is\nproposed—analogous to the Boolean algebra of PC—and one\ndefines functions that specify which (basic and complex) actions are\npermissible, forbidden, or required. An expression like “\\(P\n\\alpha\\)” then just means that \\(\\alpha\\) is a member of the set\nof permitted actions, and such expressions are used to build more\ncomplex ones using classical propositional connectives. Whereas in\ndynamic deontic logic, the deontic behavior of complex actions is\ngoverned by the underlying logic of actions (i.e., PDL), in deontic\nlogics over Boolean action algebras, specific frame conditions are\nimposed to ensure that, e.g., “action \\(\\alpha\\) is\nforbidden” entails that “doing \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\n(say, simultaneously) is\n forbidden”.[84] \nRather than questioning its semantic foundations on their own terms,\none may also argue against SDL in view of the logical principles it\nvalidates. Here we outline a number of distinct arguments and examples\nthat have been raised against specific principles of SDL, after which\nwe show how some of these can be overcome by moving to weaker\nsystems. \nLet us start with \\(\\OB\\)-NEC. This rule requires that any\ntautological statement is obligatory. Now consider the following\nstatement: \nIt seems that what (1) expresses, an absence of obligations, is\npossible. For example, consider a time when no rational agents existed\nin the universe. Why should we think that any obligations—even\nthose pertaining to tautological states of affairs—existed\n then?[85] \nIf we are reading \\(\\OB\\) as simply “it ought to be the case\nthat”, it is not clear that there is anything counterintuitive\nabout \\(\\OB \\top\\) (now read as, essentially, “it ought to be\nthat contradictions are false”), but there is also no longer any\nobvious connection to what is obligatory or permissible for that\nreading, or to what people ought to do. A different way of avoiding\nthe counterintuitive consequences of \\(\\OB\\)-NEC is by distinguishing\nbetween “vacuous” obligations such as \\(\\OB (p \\vee \\neg\np)\\) and those that require the satisfaction of some logically\ncontingent statement such as \\(\\OB (p \\amp \\neg q)\\). This can, e.g.,\nbe done by enriching one’s language with a modal operator\n\\(\\Box\\) for “settled true” (cf. Belnap 2001 et al., Horty\n2001). \nNext on the list of problematic principles is \\(\\OB\\)-RM, also known\nas the principle of Inheritance. This principle states that whenever\nsomething is obligatory, then everything that is a logical consequence\nis also obligatory (“inherits” that status). There are\nvarious well-known examples highlighting problems with \\(\\OB\\)-RM. The\nearliest and most well-known challenge to RM is Ross’s\nParadox (Ross 1941). From \nformalized as \\(\\OB m\\), we can derive: \nFormalized as \\(\\OB(m \\vee b)\\). It seems rather odd to say that an\nobligation to mail the letter entails an obligation to mail the letter\nor burn it (where burning the letter is presumably forbidden), one\nthat can be fulfilled by burning the letter, which invites from the\noffender: “Well at least I did one thing right by burning\nit”. \nWhile weakening from \\(m\\) to \\(m \\vee b\\) gives problems, similar\nissues arise when we weaken a conjunction to one of its conjuncts.\nThis is illustrated by the famous Good Samaritan Paradox\n(Prior\n 1958):[86] \nSupposing that Jones helps Smith who has been robbed if and only if\nJones helps Smith and Smith has been robbed, it would appear that a\ncorrect way to symbolize (1) and (2) in SDLs is: \nBy \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB(h \\amp r)\\) entails \\(\\OB r\\). However, it hardly\nseems that if helping the robbed man is obligatory it follows that his\nbeing robbed is likewise\n obligatory.[87]\n A much-discussed, epistemic variant of the Good Samaritan is\ndiscussed in supplement F,\n the Paradox of Epistemic Obligation. \nThere have been various responses to these RM-related paradoxes. Some\ndefend RM and blame the Ross paradox on an elementary confusion\n(Føllesdal & Hilpinen 1971) or cite pragmatic features to\nexplain away the puzzle (Castañeda 1981): no one would, e.g.,\nmerely utter the statement that John ought to mail or burn the letter,\nknowing that in fact John ought to just mail the letter. Similarly, it\nhas been argued that the Good Samaritan paradox is really a\nconditional obligation paradox, and so RM is not the real source of\nthe paradox (Castañeda 1981; Tomberlin 1981). However, since\nthese paradoxes all at least appear to depend on \\(\\OB\\)-RM,\na natural solution to the problems is to undercut the paradoxes by\nrejecting \\(\\OB\\)-RM itself. Two accessible and closely related\nexamples of approaches to deontic logic that reject \\(\\OB\\)-RM from a\nprincipled philosophical perspective are Jackson 1985 and Goble\n 1990a.[88]\n A third, somewhat different principled strategy is proposed in\nCariani 2013 and studied in formal detail in Van De Putte 2019.\nFinally, in S. O. Hansson 1990, and more elaborately in Hansson 2001,\nS.O. Hansson develops systems of deontic logic where he analyzes\nprohibitive and prescriptive deontic notions in terms of abstract\nproperties of various preference orderings (e.g., a normative status\nis prohibitive whenever anything worse than something that has that\nstatus also has it). He also sees \\(\\OB\\)-RM as the main culprit in\nthe paradoxes of standard deontic logic, and thus he methodically\nexplores non-standard frameworks where \\(\\OB\\)-RM is not\n sound.[89] \nOne very general semantic framework for logics that can invalidate\nnecessitation, inheritance, or other principles of normal modal logics\nis the neighborhood semantic\n framework.[90]\n , A neighborhood semantics works with a set of possible worlds (just\nlike Kripke-semantics) but replaces the accessibility relation with a\nneighborhood function \\(\\rN\\) that maps every world \\(w\\) onto a set\nof sets \\(X, Y,\\ldots\\) of possible worlds \\(\\rN(w)\\), often thought\nof as a set of propositions. On such a semantics, \\(\\OB p\\) is true at\na world \\(w\\) iff the set of all \\(p\\)-worlds is in the neighborhood\nof \\(w\\), i.e. \nOn the weakest logic characterized by such neighborhood models (the\nminimal “classical modal logic”, E), only \\(\\OB\\)-RE is\nvalid. Additional validities and rules can be obtained by imposing\nspecific conditions on the neighborhood functions. Furthermore,\nneighborhood semantics can be naturally generalized to deal with\nconditional obligations (Chellas 1974, 1980), and combined with\nsemantic accounts of related concepts such as agency and ability\n(McNamara 2019). It can also accommodate conflict-tolerant logics, as\nwe will see next. \nA conflict of obligations is a situation where there are two\nor more obligations and it is not possible for all of them to be\nfulfilled. A specific, paradigmatic case is the one where we have two\nobligations that are logically incompatible, such as: \nHere it would seem that I have a conflict of obligations, in fact a\nquite direct and explicit one, since what I promised one person would\nhappen, I promised another would not happen. People do (e.g., under\npressure or distraction) make conflicting promises (cf. conflicting\nappointments), and it appears that they incur conflicting obligations\nas a\n result.[92]\n But consider the natural representation of these in SDLs: \nThese premises are inconsistent in SDL. First, they are simply\nexcluded by NC \\((\\OB p \\rightarrow \\neg \\OB \\neg\n p)\\).[93]\n But merely giving up NC is not sufficient. In fact, any normal modal\nlogic (hence, any logic that contains K and Necessitation, or\nequivalently, \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB\\)-C, and RE based on PC) will generate\ndeontic explosion: \nIn effect this means that once one has conflicting obligations,\neverything is obligatory. Apart from this trivializing aspect, the\nvalidity of \\(\\OB\\)-RM and \\(\\OB\\)-C also means that having two\nincompatible obligations implausibly reduces to having a single\nself-contradictory obligation, cf.\n supplement G, Collapse of conflicts into impossible obligations. \nAs for \\(\\OB\\)-N and \\(\\OB\\)-RM, this problem can be tackled in\nvarious ways. Let us start with those who develop conflict-tolerant\ndeontic logics, by giving up one or more of the aforementioned\nprinciples. This gives rise to three distinct classes of such\nlogics: \nHowever, giving up on any of these three principles may be too\ndrastic. Suppose, e.g., that, apart from the obligations (1) and (2)\nmentioned above, I also face the obligation to visit Tom (\\(t\\)), and\nin case I visit Tom, to hand him over a letter from Jane (\\(l\\)). So\nwe have as premises \\(\\OB j\\), \\(\\OB \\neg j\\), \\(\\OB t\\), \\(\\OB (t\n\\rightarrow l)\\). Suppose moreover that \\(t\\) and \\(l\\) are perfectly\ncompatible with either of \\(j\\) or \\(\\neg j\\). Then any of the three\nabove-mentioned strategies would still invalidate the inference to\n\\(\\OB l\\): we can no longer infer that I ought to hand over the\nletter. \nMore recently, it has been argued that by using a non-monotonic\nframework such as adaptive logics, one can accommodate deontic\nconflicts and yet retain most of the inferential power of SDL. The\nrough idea behind this account is that one only rejects certain\nprinciples of SDL when they concern obligations that are in fact\nconflicted (in view of the premises). See Goble 2013 and Van de Putte,\nBeirlaen, and Meheus forthcoming for an overview of such adaptive\ndeontic logics. \nAnother shortcoming of most existing conflict-tolerant deontic logics\nis that they only focus on the above-mentioned paradigmatic case of\nbinary conflicts between logically contradictory obligations. In\ncontrast, conflicts often arise between obligations that are just\nincompatible in view of the circumstances one finds oneself in, and\nhence have a contingent\n basis.[94]\n In principle, SDL would be perfectly fine with such\n“contingent” conflicts, and we could express them in an\nenriched language by formulas of the type \nHowever, (DC) in combination with (\\(\\OB\\)-C) yields triviality as\nsoon as we endorse a minimalistic version of Kant’s law that\nought implies can: \nSimilar problems arise if we try to formalize contingent deontic\nconflicts following the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction, as shown in\n supplement H, A puzzle surrounding Kant’s law. \nLet us note that a long-ignored and challenging further puzzle for\nconflicting obligations, sometimes called “van Fraassen’s\nPuzzle” and inspired by van Fraassen 1973 has deservedly\nreceived increased attention: Horty 1994, 2003; van der Torre and Tan\n2000; McNamara 2004a; Hansen 2004; and Goble 2005. For a brief general\noverview, see Section 8.4 of Hilpinen and McNamara 2013. \nAn altogether different approach towards conflicting obligations\nconsists in distinguishing between prima facie (or pro\ntanto) obligations, and all-things considered (pro toto)\nobligations, and insisting that SDL and its siblings are logics of the\nlatter notion. This distinction has been famous at least since (Ross\n1939). It can be illustrated by Plato’s Dilemma (Lemmon\n 1962a):[95] \nHere we seem to have an indirect non-explicit conflict of obligations,\nif we assume that satisfying both obligations is practically\nimpossible. Yet, unlike in our prior example, where the two promises\nmight naturally have been on a par, we would all agree that the\nobligation to help my child overrides my obligation to meet\nyou for lunch. In other words, the first obligation is\ndefeated by the second obligation, which takes\nprecedence. Ordinarily, we would also assume that no other\nobligation overrides my obligation to rush my child to the hospital,\nso that this obligation is an all things considered non-overridden\nobligation, but not so for the obligation to meet you for lunch.\nFurthermore, we are also prone to say that the situation is one where\nthe general obligation we have to keep our appointments (or to keep\nour promises, still more generally) has an\nexception—the circumstances are extenuating. \nIf we define an “obligations dilemma” as a conflict of\nobligations where neither of the conflicting obligations is overridden\n(cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 1988), then the case above involves a conflict\nof obligations but not an obligations dilemma. Once we acknowledge\nconflicts of obligation, there is the further issue of representing\nthe logic of reasoning about conflicting obligations where some do or\ndon’t override others, some are or are not defeated, some are,\nsome are not all things considered non-overridden obligations, where\nobligation dilemmas do or don’t exist, where some obligations\nhold generally, but not unexceptionally, some are absolute, etc. So a\ncentral issue here is that of conflicting obligations of different\nweight and the defeasibility of obligations. Clearly,\nthere is no mechanism in SDL for this, since SDL does not allow for\nconflicts to begin with, yet this is an issue that goes well beyond\nthat of merely having a logic that allows for conflicts. There have\nbeen a variety of approaches to this dilemma, and to defeasibility\namong conflicting\n obligations.[96] \nRecently, the puzzles related to \\(\\OB\\)-NEC, Inheritance, and Deontic\nExplosion have been taken to reflect a more general (alleged) feature\nof deontic modals, i.e., their hyperintensionality. In the\nsyntactic sense, a modal operator is hyperintensional if it is not\nclosed under the replacement of classical, truth-functionally\nequivalent formulas. On this view, \\(\\OB p\\) is, e.g., not equivalent\nto \\(\\OB\\) \\(((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q))\\), even if the truth of\n\\(p\\) always coincides with the truth of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg\nq)\\). Semantically, this means that such an operator cannot be\ninterpreted as an intensional modal operator, using (classical)\npossible-worlds semantics. \nA promising recent semantic framework for hyperintensional logics is\nthat of truthmaker semantics (Fine 2017). On such a semantics,\npropositions are interpreted by “truthmakers”, resp.\n“falsemakers” rather than sets of worlds, where these\nentities are related to one another in terms of a merelogical\n(parthood) relation. For instance, a truthmaker for “it\nrains” would be simply a state of it’s raining, nothing\nless and nothing more. A truthmaker for “(it rains and the sun\nshines) or (it rains and the sun does not shine)” can be either\nof two things: a fusion of a state of it’s raining with a state\nof the sun’s shining, or a fusion of a state of it’s\nraining with a state of the sun’s not shining (and hence, the\nlatter, a falsemaker of “the sun shines”). Formally, the\nset of truthmakers of \\(p\\) may, e.g., be \\(\\{X, X'\\}\\), while the set\nof truthmakers of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q)\\) may be \\(\\{X*Y,\\)\n\\(X*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z\\}\\), with the “*” symbol\ndenoting a fusion\n operation.[97]\n Fine applied this framework to the logic of imperatives and to\ndeontic logic proper in a series of papers (Fine 2018a,b) where\n“actions” play the role usually played by truthmakers in\nthe semantics of indicative sentences, and analogous to the\ntruthmaking and falsemaking relations between truthmakers and\npropositions, such actions can be either in compliance with or\ncontravening a given command. For instance, the imperative “Sing\nor dance!” is interpreted in terms of (a) the actions that are\nin (exact) compliance with it, and (b) the actions that are in (exact)\ncontravention of it. For the case of conditional obligations,\nadditional complications arise, as one may also avoid a\nconditional by making its antecedent\n false.[98]\n Similar ideas, though worked out in different ways, can be found in\nAnglberger and Korbmacher 2020, which also relate truthmaker semantics\nto Goble’s logic BDL from Goble 2013. For a full-fledged\ndiscussion of the hyperintensionality of normativity and formal\napproaches to it, see Faroldi 2019. \nPlainly, there are a number of outstanding problems for deontic logic.\nSome see this as a serious defect; others see it merely as a serious\nchallenge, even an attractive one. There is some antecedent reason to\nexpect that the challenges will be great in this area. Normativity is\nchallenging generally, not just in deontic logic. Normative notions\nappear to have strong pragmatic features. Normative notions must\ncombine with notions for agency and with temporal notions to be of\nmaximal interest—which introduces considerable logical\ncomplexity. There is also reason to think that there are hidden\ncomplexities in the interaction of normative notions and conditionals.\nFinally, there appears to be a wide array of normative notions with\ninteresting interactions, some easily conflated with others (by\nethicists as much as deontic logicians). Clearly, there is a lot of\nwork to be done.","contact.mail":"paulmunh@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2006-02-07","date.changed":"2021-03-11","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-deontic/","author1":"Paul McNamara","author1.info":"http://www.unh.edu/philosophy/Faculty_Pages_info/mcnamara_page.htm","author2.info":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederik_Van_De_Putte","entry":"logic-deontic","body.text":"\n\n\nDeontic\n logic[1]\n is a branch of logic that has been the most concerned with the\ncontribution that the following sorts of notions make to what follows\nfrom what (or what supports what, more\n generally):[2]\n \npermissible (permitted)\nimpermissible (forbidden, prohibited)\nobligatory (duty, required)\nomissible (non-obligatory)\noptional\nnon-optional\nmust\nought\nsupererogatory (beyond the call)\nindifferent / significant\nthe least one can do\nbetter than / best / good / bad\nclaim / liberty / power / immunity\nresponsibility\nblame / praise\nagency / action\n\nConsider\n\n\n\n\nYou are obligated to return your friend’s car by noon, and the\nleast you can do is return it on time with the same level of battery\ncharge it had when you borrowed it, but it is beyond the call to buy\nyour friend a dinner on top of that.\n\n\n\nVarious things seem to follow: It is impermissible to not return your\nfriends car by noon; it is obligatory to return your friends car, it\nis optional to return it with a full charge, and doing the least you\ncan do precludes buying dinner. For deontic logic, the aim is to\ndevelop accounts of the logical contribution made by the key concepts\nlisted\n above.[3]\n \n\nAs a branch of logic, deontic logic is of theoretical\ninterest for some of the same reasons that\n modal logic\n (the logic of necessity and possibility), is of theoretical interest.\nAlso, although we need to be cautious about making too easy a link\nbetween deontic logic and practicality, many of the notions listed\nabove are typically employed in attempting to regulate and\ncoordinate our\n lives.[4]\n For these reasons, deontic logics often directly involve topics of\nconsiderable practical significance such as morality, law, social and\nbusiness organizations (their norms, as well as their normative\nconstitution), and security systems. To that extent, studying the\nlogic of notions with such practical significance adds\npractical significance to deontic logic itself. However, in this entry\nwe will focus on deontic logic itself, rather than its applications\nand practical relevance.\n\n\nIn Section 1 of this entry, we note certain simple formal\nrelationships between the first six concepts in our initial list\nabove, following the many-centuries old tradition of comparing (and\ncontrasting) basic deontic notions (e.g., obligation, permission) with\nmodal notions (e.g., necessity and possibility). In Section 2, we turn\nto a benchmark system of symbolic deontic logic, one that quickly\nbecame a reference point. In Section 3, we examine a closely related\napproach that reframes deontic notions by “reducing” them\nto pure modal notions coupled with a so-called “deontic\nconstant”. In a sense, the approaches discussed in Sections 2\nand 3 might be said to stand in the shadow of modal logic. In Section\n4, we turn to developments in deontic logic that emerged in the\nattempt to grapple with conditionalized deontic claims, and here\ndeontic logic comes more fully into its own. In Sections 5 and 6 we\nturn to a variety of perceived inadequacies of the benchmark systems\nintroduced in Sections 1–4. Section 5 focuses primarily on arguing for\nand specifying expansions of the limited expressive resources in the\nbenchmark\n systems.[5]\n Finally, Section 6, rather than expanding on the benchmark\napproaches, instead raises fundamental shortcomings in their modelling\nof the ideas they purport to represent, thereby seeking to dismantle\nsome of the principles of the systems and/or construct new systems in\ntheir place.\n\nDeontic logic has been regularly influenced by reflection on the logic\nof modal notions, such as necessity (in varying senses of the\nterm). In particular, analogies between alethic (truth-implicating)\nmodal notions and deontic notions were noticed before the fourteenth\ncentury in Europe, where we might say that the rudiments of formal\n(though not symbolic) deontic logic experienced its initial European\nstirrings. In Islamic thought, such analogies go back at least as far\nas the tenth century. \nAlthough interest in what can be arguably called formal aspects of\ndeontic logic continued off and on, the trend toward studying logic\nusing the symbolic and exact techniques of mathematics began\nprimarily in the nineteenth century, and became dominant in the\ntwentieth century. Work in twentieth century symbolic modal logic\nprovided the explicit impetus for von Wright (1951a, 1951b), the\ncentral early figure in the emergence of deontic logic as a\nfull-fledged branch of symbolic logic in the twentieth\ncentury. However, we note that prior to von Wright 1951a, there was\none significant earlier episode in symbolic deontic logic, namely\nMally 1926. See supplement A:\n Mally and Symbolic Deontic Logic.[6] \nIn the remainder of this section, we first spell out a few\nfolk-logical features of alethic modal notions, and then give an\nimpressionistic sense of how natural it was for early developments of\ndeontic logic to explore deontic analogs to those features. \nAlethic modal logic is the logic of necessary truth and related\nnotions. Consider six basic alethic modal notions, expressed as\nsentential operators—constructions that, when applied to a\nsentence, yield a sentence (as does “it is not the case\nthat”): \nAlthough all of the above operators are generally deemed definable in\nterms of any one of the first four, the necessity operator, usually\nsymbolized as a box, \\(\\Box\\), is typically taken as primitive and the\nrest defined accordingly. Where “\\(\\neg\\)”,\n“&” , and “\\(\\vee\\)“ denote classical\nnegation, conjunction, and disjunction, the definitions are as\nfollows: \nIt was also routinely assumed that the following threefold partition\nof propositions holds: \nFig. 1 \nThe three rectangular cells are intended to be jointly exhaustive and\nmutually exclusive: every proposition is either necessary, contingent\n(possibly true but also possibly false), or impossible, but no\nproposition is more than one of these. The possible propositions are\nthose that are either necessary or contingent, the non-necessary\npropositions are those that are either impossible or contingent, and\nthe non-contingent ones are those either necessary or impossible. \nThirdly, dating back at least to the twelfth and thirteenth century\n(Knuuttila 2008), the following modal square of opposition is often\n noted:[8] \nFig. 2\n [An extended description of figure 2.] \nFurthermore it is generally assumed that the following hold: \nIf \\(\\Box p\\) then \\(p\\) (if it is necessary that \\(p\\), then \\(p\\) is\ntrue). \nIf \\(p\\), then \\(\\Diamond p\\) (if \\(p\\) is true, then it is\npossible). \nThese indicate that the idea of necessity here is alethic or\ntruth-implicating. Many of the ideas above were noted in medieval\ntimes. (See, e.g., the entry on\n medieval theories of modality.) \nWe now turn to some of the analogies involved in what is a\ncorresponding bit of deontic folk logic, following the exposition in\nMcNamara 1996a,b. This is a minor elaboration of elements that can be\nfound explicitly in von Wright 1951b and Prior 1955 [1962]. However,\nmuch of it has roots in medieval Islamic and late medieval European\nthought, where possible analogies between deontic modals and alethic\nmodals were being explored and formal deontic schemes were\n proposed.[9] \nExpressed as sentential operators, the six normative statuses of what\nwe will call “the Traditional Scheme” are: \nThe first three are the most often cited, the fourth is often not\nlabeled, and the fifth has regularly been mislabeled as “it is a\nmatter of indifference that”, and so likewise for the\nsixth. Typically, one of the first two is taken as primitive, and the\nothers defined in terms of it, but any of the first four can play the\nsame defining role. The most prevalent approach is to take \\(\\OB\\) as\nprimitive, and define the rest as\n follows:[11] \nThese definitions imply that something is permissible iff (if and only\nif) its negation is not obligatory, impermissible iff its negation is\nobligatory, omissible iff it is not obligatory, optional iff neither\nit nor its negation is obligatory, and non-optional iff it is either\nobligatory or impermissible. Call this “The Traditional\nDefinitional Scheme (TDS)”. It, or minor variants, are\nfound as far back as Ockham in European thought, and quite explicitly\nin Leibniz in the modern\n period.[12]\n If one began with \\(\\OB\\) alone and considered the formulas on the\nright above, one could easily be led to consider them as at least\ncandidate defining conditions for those on the left. Although not\nuncontestable, they are natural, and this scheme has been very widely\nemployed. Now if the reader looks back at our use of the necessity\noperator in defining the remaining five alethic modal operators, it\nwill be clear that these are perfectly analogous to the five deontic\ndefinitions above. From the formal standpoint, the one is merely a\nsyntactic variant of the other: just replace \\(\\OB\\) with \\(\\Box\\),\n\\(\\PE\\) with \\(\\Diamond\\), etc. \nIn addition to the TDS, it was traditionally assumed that the\nfollowing, call it “The Traditional Threefold Classification\n(TTC)” holds: \nFig. 3 \nAs in the modal case, the thought is that all propositions are divided\ninto three jointly exhaustive and mutually exclusive classes: every\nproposition is obligatory, impermissible or neither (that is,\noptional) and no proposition falls into more than one of these three\ncategories. Furthermore, the permissible propositions are those that\nare obligatory or optional, the omissible propositions are those that\nare impermissible or optional, and the non-optional propositions are\nthose that are either obligatory or impermissible. This classification\ntoo has roots centuries\n ago.[13]\n The reader can easily confirm that this natural scheme is also\nperfectly analogous to the threefold classification we gave above for\nnecessary, contingent and impossible propositions. \nFurthermore, as indicated earlier, “The Deontic Square”\n(DS) is also often cited in the historical literature: \nFig. 4\n [An extended description of figure 4.] \nThe relationships between the logical operators at the corners are to\nbe interpreted as in the modal square of opposition. The two squares\nare perfectly analogous. If we weave in nodes for optionality and\nnon-optionality, we get a deontic\n hexagon:[14] \nFig. 5\n [An extended description of figure 5.] \nGiven these analogies, it is unsurprising that our primitive operator,\nread here as “it is obligatory that”, is often referred to\nas “deontic necessity”. However, there are also\nobvious disanalogies with alethic necessity. Before, we cited two\nprinciples for alethic necessity whose deontic analogs are clearly\nfalse: \nObligations can be violated, and impermissible things do\n happen.[15]\n However, as researchers turned to generalizations of alethic modal\nlogic, they began to consider wider classes of modal logics, including\nones where the necessity operator was not truth-implicating.\nThis too encouraged seeing deontic logic as falling within modal logic\nso-generalized. In fact, recognizing possibilities like this helped to\nfuel the generalizations of what began with a focus on alethic modal\nlogic to normal modal logics (Lemmon & Scott 1977). \nWe will revisit the Traditional Scheme in a more precise and unifying\nway in the next section. There is a sense in which it is an earlier\ninformal and widely endorsed fragment of the most well-known deontic\nlogic, a logic that makes the connection to alethic modal logic even\ntighter. We now turn to that logic. \nStandard Deontic Logic (SDL) is the most cited and studied\nsystem of deontic logic, and one of the first deontic logics\naxiomatically specified. SDL includes classical propositional logic,\nand is essentially a distinguished member of the most studied class of\npropositional modal logics, “normal modal logics”. SDL is\na “monadic” deontic logic, since its primitive deontic\noperator is a one-place operator (like \\(\\neg\\), and unlike &): it\napplies to a single sentence to yield a compound\n sentence.[16]\n This operator, \\(\\OB\\), is taken as primitive within SDL; as\nexplained in\n Section 1.2,\n other operators such as \\(\\PE\\) and \\(\\IM\\) can be defined from it\nfollowing the Traditional Definitional Scheme. \nAssume again that we have a language of classical propositional logic\n(PC) with an infinite set of propositional variables, the truth\nfunctional operators \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\rightarrow\\) (and perhaps any of\n&, \\(\\vee\\) and \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) as well), and the operator,\n\\(\\OB\\). SDL is then often axiomatized as\n follows:[17] \nTAUT combined with modus ponens (MP) gives us the full inferential\npower of PC. \\(\\OB\\)-K, which is the K-axiom common to all normal\nmodal logics, tells us that if a material conditional is obligatory,\nand its antecedent is too, then so is its\n consequent.[18]\n NC tells us that \\(p\\) is obligatory only if its negation\nisn’t. The rule \\(\\OB\\)-NEC tells us that if anything is a\ntheorem, then the claim that that thing is obligatory is also a\ntheorem. Note that this guarantees that something is always obligatory\n(even if only logical\n truths).[19] \nEach of the distinctively deontic principles, \\(\\OB\\)-K, NC, and\n\\(\\OB\\)-NEC are contestable, and we will consider criticisms of them\nin\n Section 6.\n However, to avoid immediate confusion for those new to deontic logic,\nit is perhaps worth noting that \\(\\OB\\)-NEC is generally deemed a\nconvenience that, among other things, assures that SDL is in fact one\nof the well-studied normal modal\n logics.[20]\n Few have spilled blood to defend its cogency substantively, and often\nthese practical compromises are wise, especially in early stages of\nresearch. \nSDL can be seen as a normalized version of von Wright’s original\nproposal in von Wright 1951a, though there are some significant\ndifferences in terms of the formal language, validities, and its\ninterpretation. A quick comparison of both systems can be found in the\nsupplement B on\n von Wright’s 1951a System and SDL. \nBelow we list some theorems and two important derived rules of\n SDL.[21] \nWe will be discussing virtually all of these subsequently. For now,\nlet’s indicate a few derivations. We show that \\(\\OB\\)-RM is a\nderived rule of SDL, and note three\n corollaries.[22] \nAn alternative formulation of SDL can be found in supplement C on\n Alternative Axiomatization of SDL. \nSDL can be strengthened by adding additional axioms; in particular, we\nmight consider adding axioms with nested deontic operators. For\nexample, suppose we added the following formula as an axiom to\nSDL: \nCall the resulting system “SDL+” for easy reference in\nthis section. This says (roughly) that it is required that obligations\nbe fulfilled. This is not a theorem of SDL (as we will see in\n Section 2.3),\n so SDL+ is a genuine strengthening of SDL. Furthermore, it makes a\nlogically contingent proposition (i.e., that \\(\\OB p\n\\rightarrow p)\\) obligatory as a matter of deontic logic. SDL\ndoes not have this feature. With this addition to SDL, it is easy to\nprove \\(\\OB \\OB p \\rightarrow \\OB p\\), a formula involving an iterated\noccurrence of our main\n operator.[23]\n This formula asserts that if it is obligatory that \\(p\\) be\nobligatory, then \\(p\\) is obligatory. (Cf. “the only\nthings that are required to be obligatory are those that actually\n are”).[24]\n It should be noted that these are often given an impersonal ought\nreading, so that \\(\\OB\\)-U would be read as “It ought to be the\ncase that if it ought to be the case that \\(p\\) then it\n is)”.[25] \nIn identifying the Traditional Definitional Scheme (TDS) in\n Section 1.2,\n we noted that it was widely recognized that we could have taken\nanother notion than obligation from our first four primary\nnormative statuses and defined the rest in terms of that one. So it is\nexpected that we should be able to generate the corresponding\nequivalences derivatively from the scheme we did settle on, where\n\\(\\OB\\) is taken as primitive. For example, it is obviously desirable\nto have \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\PE \\neg p\\) as part of the\nTraditional Scheme, as this expresses the equivalence between what\nwould have been definiens and definiendum had “\\(\\PE\\)”\nbeen taken as primitive. However, this equivalence is not thus far\nderivable. For \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\PE \\neg p\\) is\ndefinitionally equivalent to \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\neg \\OB\n\\neg \\neg p\\), that is, \\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\OB \\neg \\neg p\\), but\nthe latter formula is not a tautology, so we cannot in turn derive\n\\(\\OB p \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\PE \\neg p\\). So more is presupposed in\nthe Traditional Scheme than what has been noted above. A natural\nthought is a rule of inference needs to be added, one allowing for the\nreplacement of provably equivalent formulas in the context of\n“\\(\\OB\\)”, namely \\(\\OB\\)-RE in Corollary 2 above\nLet’s take this to be tacitly part of the Traditional\nScheme. \nSuppose now that we have the same language as that of SDL, along with\nthe rule RE governing \\(\\OB\\). We saw in\n Section 1.2\n that in addition to TDS, the Traditional Threefold Classification\n(TTC) and/or the Deontic Square (DS) of Opposition were often\nexplicitly endorsed in pre-symbolic investigations of deontic logic.\nSymbolically formulated, these are: \nGiven TDS and RE, it turns out that DS and TTC are each\ntautologically equivalent to the principle that obligations\ncannot conflict (and thus to one another): \nFor in primitive notation, DS becomes \nand although the first two conjuncts are tautologies, the remaining\nfour are each tautologically equivalent to NC above. Similarly, TTC\nbecomes \nand although the exhaustiveness clause is tautological, as are the\nlast two conjuncts of the exclusiveness clause, the first conjunct of\nthat clause is just NC\n again.[26] \nSo the Traditional Scheme rests squarely on the soundness of NC, along\nwith \\(\\OB\\)-RE and the TDS. In fact, the Traditional Scheme can be\nseen as a widely endorsed, informal counterpart of a deontic logic\ncomposed of just PC, \\(\\OB\\)-RE and NC. Since that logic is a (proper)\nfragment of SDL, it follows that the Traditional Scheme (symbolized)\nis entailed by\n SDL.[27] \nThe reader familiar with elementary textbook logic will have perhaps\nnoticed that the deontic square and the modal square both have even\nbetter-known analogs for the quantifiers as interpreted in classical\npredicate logic: \nFig. 6\n [An extended description of figure 6.] \nThough less widely noted in textbooks, there is also a threefold\npartition for classical quantifiers regarding any condition,\n\\(p\\): \nFig. 7\n [An extended description of figure 7.] \nThese quantificational analogies reflect possible inspiration behind\nwhat is most often called “possible worlds semantics” for\nsuch logics, to which we now\n turn.[28]\n Once the analogies are noticed, spelling out this sort of semantics\nseems all but\n inevitable.[29] \nWe choose a standard “Kripke-style” possible world\nsemantics for SDL (Kripke 1959,\n 1963).[30]\n We assume that we have a set of possible worlds, \\(W\\), and a\nrelation, \\(A\\), relating worlds to worlds, with the intention that\n\\(Aij\\) iff \\(j\\) is a world where everything that holds at \\(j\\) is\nacceptable from the standpoint of \\(i\\), so that everything obligatory\nat \\(i\\) holds in \\(j\\). For brevity, we will call all worlds so\nrelated to \\(i\\), “\\(i\\)-acceptable” worlds and denote\nthem by\n \\(A^i\\).[31]\n We then add that the acceptability relation is “serial”:\nfor every world, \\(i\\), there is at least one \\(i\\)-acceptable world.\nFinally, propositions are either true or false at a world, never both,\nand when a proposition, \\(p\\), is true at a world, we will often\nindicate this by referring to that world as a\n“\\(p\\)-world”. The truth-functional operators have their\nusual behavior at each world. \nThe fundamental idea here is that the normative status of a\nproposition from the standpoint of a world \\(i\\) can be assessed by\nlooking at how that proposition fairs at the \\(i\\)-acceptable worlds.\nFor any given world, \\(i\\), we can easily picture the \\(i\\)-accessible\nworlds as all corralled together in logical space, where seriality is\nreflected by a small dot representing the presence of at least one\n\\(i\\)-acceptable world. The intended truth-conditions, relative to\n\\(i\\), for our five deontic operators can now be pictured as\nfollows: \nFig. 8\n [An extended description of figure 8.] \nThus, \\(p\\) is obligatory iff it holds in all the\n\\(i\\)-acceptable worlds, permissible iff it holds in some\nsuch world, impermissible iff it holds in no such world,\nomissible iff its negation holds in some such world,\noptional iff \\(p\\) holds in some such world, and so does\n\\(\\neg p\\), and non-optional when \\(p\\) either holds at\nall such worlds or at none. If a formula is true at every world\nin any such model of serially-related worlds, then the formula is\n valid.[32] \nTo illustrate the workings of this framework, consider NC, \\(\\OB p\n\\rightarrow \\neg \\OB \\neg p\\). This is valid in this framework because\nof seriality. For suppose that \\(\\OB p\\) holds at any world \\(i\\) in\nany model. Then each \\(i\\)-accessible world is one where \\(p\\) holds,\nand by the seriality of accessibility, there must be at least one such\nworld. Call it \\(j\\). Now we can see that \\(\\neg \\OB \\neg p\\) must\nhold at \\(i\\) as well, for otherwise, \\(\\OB \\neg p\\) would hold at\n\\(i\\), in which case, \\(\\neg p\\) would have to hold at all the\n\\(i\\)-accessible worlds, including \\(j\\). But then p as well as \\(\\neg\np\\) would hold at \\(j\\) itself, which is impossible (by the semantics\nfor “\\(\\neg\\)”). The other axioms and rules of SDL can be\nsimilarly shown to be valid, as can all the principles listed above as\nderivable in SDL. \nIn contrast, \\(\\OB\\)-U, the axiom \\(\\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p)\\) that\nwe added to SDL to get SDL+, is not valid in the class of serial\nmodels. In order to validate \\(\\OB\\)-U, we need the further\nrequirement of “secondary seriality”: that any\n\\(i\\)-acceptable world, \\(j\\), must be in turn acceptable to\nitself. We can illustrate such an \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) as follows: \nFig. 9 \nHere we imagine that the arrow connectors indicate relative\nacceptability, thus here, \\(j\\) (and only \\(j)\\) is acceptable to\n\\(i\\), and \\(j\\) (and only \\(j)\\) is acceptable to \\(j\\). If all\nworlds that are acceptable to any given world have this property of\nself-acceptability, then our axiom is valid. For assume that this\nproperty holds throughout our models, and for reductio, suppose that\nfor some arbitrary world \\(i, \\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p)\\) is false at\n\\(i\\). Then not all \\(i\\)-acceptable worlds are worlds where \\(\\OB p\n\\rightarrow p\\) is true. So, there must be an \\(i\\)-acceptable world,\nsay \\(j\\), where \\(\\OB p\\) is true, but \\(p\\) is false. Since \\(\\OB\np\\) is true at \\(j\\), then \\(p\\) must be true at all \\(j\\)-acceptable\nworlds. But by stipulation, \\(j\\) is acceptable to itself, so \\(p\\)\nmust be true at \\(j\\), but this contradicts our assumption that \\(p\\)\nwas false at \\(j\\). Thus \\(\\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p)\\) must be true at\nall worlds, after all. Two counter-models showing that \\(\\OB\\)-U is\nnot derivable in SDL, and that SDL \\(+ \\OB \\OB p \\rightarrow \\OB p\\)\ndoes not imply \\(\\OB\\)-U can be found in supplement D:\n Two Counter-Models Regarding Additions to SDL. \nWe should also note that one alternative semantic picture for SDL is\nwhere we have a set of world-relative ordering relations, one for each\nworld \\(i\\) in W, where \\(j \\ge_i k\\) iff \\(j\\) is as good as \\(k\\)\n(and perhaps better) relative to \\(i\\). We might then assume that from\nthe standpoint of any world \\(i\\), a) each world is as good as itself,\nb) if one is as good as a second, and the second is as good as a\nthird, then the first is as good as the third, c) and for any two\nworlds, either the first is as good as the second or vice versa (i.e.,\nrespectively, each such \\(\\ge_i\\) is reflexive, transitive, and\nconnected in W). As a matter of fact, this approach also determines\nSDL. (See Goble 2003 for one of the few proofs of this claim.) If we\nthen add “The Limit Assumption”, that for each world\n\\(i\\), there is always at least one world as good as all worlds (i.e.,\none \\(i\\)-best world) we can easily generate our earlier semantics for\nSDL derivatively. We need only add the natural analogue here to our\nprior truth-conditions for \\(\\OB\\): \\(\\OB p\\) is true at a world \\(i\\)\niff \\(p\\) is true at all the \\(i\\)-best worlds: \nFig. 10\n [An extended description of figure 10.] \nEssentially, the ordering relation coupled with the limit assumption\njust gives us a way to generate the set of \\(i\\)-acceptable\nworlds instead of taking them as primitive in the semantics: \\(j\\) is\n\\(i\\)-acceptable iff \\(j\\) is \\(i\\)-best. Once generated, we look only\nat what is going on in the \\(i\\)-acceptable (as \\(i\\)-best) worlds to\ninterpret the truth-conditions for the deontic operators, just as with\nour simpler Kripke-Style semantics. The analogue to the seriality of\nour earlier \\(i\\)-acceptability relation is also assured by the Limit\nAssumption, since it entails that for each world \\(i\\), there is\nalways some \\(i\\)-best (so \\(i\\)-acceptable) world. Although this\nordering semantics approach appears to be a bit of overkill here, as\nwe shall see in\n Section 4\n and\n Section 5,\n it became quite important later on in the endeavor to develop\nexpressively richer deontic logics. For now, we turn to the\nsecond-most well-known approach to monadic deontic logic, one in which\nSDL emerges derivatively. \nThe Andersonian-Kangerian reduction is dually-named in\nacknowledgment of Kanger’s and Anderson’s independent\nformulation of it around the same\n time.[33]\n As Hilpinen 2001a points out, the approach is adumbrated much earlier\nin Leibniz. We follow Kanger’s development here, noting\nAnderson’s toward the end. \nAssume that we have a language of classical modal propositional logic,\nwith a distinguished (deontic) propositional constant: \n“\\(d\\)” for “all (relevant) normative demands are\nmet”. \nNow consider the following axiom system, “Kd”: \nKd is just the normal modal logic K with \\(\\Diamond d\\)\n added.[34]\n \\(\\Diamond d\\) is interpreted as telling us that it is possible that\nall normative demands are met. In import when added to system K, it is\nsimilar to (though stronger than) the “No Conflicts” axiom\nof SDL. All of the Traditional Scheme’s deontic\noperators are easily defined derivatively once we provide “the\nreductive clause” for \\(\\OB\\): \nSo in Kd, \\(p\\) is obligatory if \\(p\\) is necessitated\nby all normative demands being met, permissible if \\(p\\) is\ncompatible with all normative demands being met,\nimpermissible if \\(p\\) is incompatible with all normative\ndemands, etc. Since none of the operators of the Traditional Scheme\nare taken as primitive, and the basic logic is a modal logic with\nnecessity and possibility as the primitive modal operators, this is\nreferred to as “a reduction” (of deontic logic to modal\nlogic) \nProofs of SDL-ish formulas are then just K-proofs of the corresponding\nmodal formulae involving\n “\\(d\\)”.[35]\n It is well-known that all theorems of SDL are derivable in Kd\nand conversely, that if some formula in the language of SDL is not a\ntheorem of SDL, then its translation following the Kangerian reduction\nis also not a theorem of\n Kd.[36]\n In addition to containing all theorems of SDL, we note a few theorems\nthat are specific to Kd because of the non-overlapping\nsyntactic ingredients, \\(d, \\Box\\), and \\(\\Diamond\\): \nThese are easily\n derived.[38] \nAlthough our underlying modal system is just K, adding further\nnon-deontic axiom schema (i.e., those that cannot be abbreviated via\nSDL formulas, nor involving \\(d\\) specifically) can nonetheless have a\ndeontic impact. To illustrate, suppose we added a fourth axiom, one to\nthe effect that necessity is truth-implicating, standardly called\naxiom “T”: \nCall the system that results from adding this formula to our current\nsystem “KTd”. The addition of T makes derivable our\npreviously mentioned axiom \\(\\OB\\)-U of SDL+, which we have shown is\nnot derivable in SDL\n itself:[39] \nSo, reflecting on the fact that SDL+ is derivable in KTd, we\nsee that the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction must either rely on a\nnon-truth-implicating conception of necessity in order for its pure\ndeontic fragment to match SDL, or SDL itself is not susceptible to the\nAndersonian-Kangerian reduction. Put another way, the most plausible\nversion of the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction can’t help but\nview “Standard Deontic Logic” as too weak. \nAnderson’s approach is practically equivalent to Kanger’s.\nFirst, consider the fact that we can easily define another constant in\nKd, as follows: \nwhere this new constant would now be derivatively read as follows: \n“some (relevant) normative demand has been violated”. \nClearly our current axiom, \\(\\Diamond d\\), could be replaced with\n\\(\\neg \\Box s\\), asserting that it is not necessary that some\nnormative demand is violated. We could then define \\(\\OB\\) as: \nEssentially, Anderson took this equivalent course with\n“\\(s\\)” being his primitive (initially standing for\nsomething like “the sanction has been invoked” or\n“there is a liability to sanction”), and \\(\\neg \\Box s\\),\nas the axiom added to some modal system (e.g., at least as strong as\nmodal system KT). \nWe should also note that Anderson was famous as a founding figure in\n relevance logic,\n and along with using strict implication, \\(\\Box(p \\rightarrow q)\\),\nhe also explored the use of a relevant (and thus neither material nor\nstrict) form of implication, \\(\\Rightarrow\\), to express the reduction\nas: \\(\\OB p \\eqdf \\neg p \\Rightarrow\n s\\).[40]\n (A bit more on this can be found within the entry on\n Mally’s deontic logic.\n See further references there.) This alternative reflects the fact\nthat there is an issue in both Kanger’s and Anderson’s\nstrict necessitation (or entailment) approaches of just what notion of\n“necessity” is involved in claiming that meetings all\nnormative demands (or avoiding the sanction) in some sense\nnecessitates \\(p\\). \nAs a substantive matter, how should we think of these\n“reductions”? For example, should we view them as giving\nus an analysis of what it is for something to be obligatory?\nTaking Kanger's approach first, it would seem that \\(d\\) must be read\nas a distinctive deontic ingredient, if we are to get the derivative\ndeontic reading for the “reduced” deontic operators. Also,\nas our reading suggests, it is not clear that \\(d\\) does not, at least\nby intention, express a complex quantificational notion involving the\nvery concept of obligation (demand) as a proper part, namely that all\nobligations have been fulfilled, so that the “reduction”,\npresented as an analysis, would appear to be circular. If we\nread \\(d\\) instead as “ideal circumstances obtain”, the\nclaim of a substantive reduction or analysis appears more promising,\nuntil we ask: Are the circumstances ideal only with respect to meeting\nnormative demands or obligations, or are they ideal in other\n(for example supererogatory) ways that go beyond merely satisfying\nnormative demands? Anderson’s “liability to\nsanction” approach may appear more promising, since the idea\nthat something is obligatory if (and only if) and because\nnon-compliance necessitates (in some sense) liability to (or perhaps\ndesert of) punishment does not appear to be circular (unless the\nnotion of “liability” itself ultimately involves the idea\nof permissibility of punishment), but is it plausible? Alternatively,\nperhaps a norm that is merely an ideal cannot be\nviolated, in which case perhaps norms that have been\nviolated can be distinguished (as a subset) from norms that\nhave not been complied with, and then the notion of an\nobligation as something that must obtain unless some norm is violated\nwill not be obviously circular. There is a substantive philosophical\nquestion lingering here that the language of a “reduction”\nbrings naturally to the surface, but is sloughed over. The formal\nutility of the reduction does not hinge on this, but its philosophical\nsignificance does. \nThe semantic elements here are in large part analogous to those for\nSDL. We have a binary relation again, but this time instead of a\nrelation interpreted as relating worlds acceptable to a given\nworld, here we will have a relation, \\(R\\), relating worlds\n“accessible” to a given world (e.g., possible relative to\nthe given world). The only novelties are two: (1) we add a simple\nsemantic element to match our syntactic constant “\\(d\\)”,\nand (2) we add a slightly more complex analog to seriality, one that\nlinks the accessibility relation to the semantic element added in\norder to model \\(d\\). \nOnce again, assume that we have a set of possible worlds, \\(W\\), and\nwe assume that we have a relation, \\(R\\), relating worlds to worlds,\nwith the intention that \\(Rij\\) iff \\(j\\) is accessible to \\(i\\)\n(e.g., \\(j\\) is a world where everything true in \\(j\\) is possible\nrelative to\n \\(i\\).[41]\n For brevity, we will call all worlds possible relative to \\(i\\),\n“\\(i\\)-accessible worlds” and denote them by\n\\(R^i\\). For the moment, no restrictions are placed on the relation\n\\(R\\). We can illustrate the truth-conditions for necessity, and\npossibility with obvious abbreviations, as follows: \nFig. 11\n [An extended description of figure 11.] \nHere we imagine that for any given world, \\(i\\), we have corralled all\nthe \\(i\\)-accessible worlds together. We then simply look at the\nquantificational status of \\(p\\) (and/or \\(\\neg p)\\) in these\n\\(i\\)-accessible worlds to determine \\(p\\)’s modal status back\nat \\(i\\). For example\\(,\\) at a given world \\(i, p\\) is\nnecessary if \\(p\\) holds throughout \\(R^i\\) and\npossible if \\(p\\) holds somewhere in \\(R^i\\). \nThe only deontic element in the syntax of Kd is our\ndistinguished constant, \\(d\\), intended to express the fact that all\nnormative demands are met\\(.\\) To model that feature, we simply assume\nthat the worlds are divided into those where all normative demands are\nmet and those that are not. We denote the former subset of worlds by\n“DEM” in a model. Then \\(d\\) is true at a world \\(j\\) iff\n\\(j\\) belongs to DEM. Here is a picture where \\(d\\) is true at an\narbitrary world, \\(j\\): \nFig. 12\n [An extended description of figure 12.] \nSince \\(j\\) is contained in DEM, that means all normative demands are\nmet at\n \\(j\\).[42] \nCorresponding to simple seriality for SDL (that there is always an\n\\(i\\)-acceptable world), we assume what I will call “strong\nseriality” for Kd: for every world \\(i\\), there is an\n\\(i\\)-accessible world that is among those where all normative demands\nare met. In other words, for every world \\(i\\), the intersection of\nthe \\(i\\)-accessible worlds with DEM is non-empty. Given the truth\nconditions for \\(d\\), strong seriality validates \\(\\Diamond d\\),\nensuring that for any world \\(i\\), there is always some\n\\(i\\)-accessible world where \\(d\\) is true: \nFig. 13\n [An extended description of figure 13.] \nGiven these semantic elements, if you apply them carefully to the\ndefinitions of the deontic operators of Kd, you will see that\nin each case, the normative status of \\(p\\) at \\(i\\) depends on\n\\(p\\)’s relationship to this intersection of the i-accessible\nworlds and the worlds where all normative demands are met: \nFig. 14\n [An extended description of figure 14.] \nIf that intersection is permeated by \\(p\\)-worlds, \\(p\\) is\nobligatory; if it contains some \\(p\\)-world, \\(p\\) is permissible,\n etc.[43] \nIf we wish to validate T, \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow p\\) (and derivatively,\n\\(\\OB\\)-U, \\((\\OB (\\OB p \\rightarrow p))\\), we need only stipulate\nthat the accessibility relation, R, is reflexive: that each world\n\\(i\\) is \\(i\\)-accessible (possible relative to itself): \nFig. 15 \nFor then \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow p\\) must be true at any world \\(i\\), for\nif \\(\\Box p\\) is true at \\(i\\), then \\(p\\) is true at each\n\\(i\\)-accessible world, which includes \\(i\\), since \\(i\\) is\nself-accessible. This will indirectly yield the result that \\(\\OB (\\OB\np \\rightarrow p)\\) is true in all such models as well. \nHaving introduced deontic logic’s classical points of departure,\nwe now turn to a number of problems, paradoxes, and related logics\nthat are studied in the field today. Here, our aim is mainly to map\nout the various topics that are central stage in deontic logic; for\nreasons of space, we cannot present theories or logics in much\ndetail. \nConsider the following four premises (Chisholm 1963a) and their most\nstraightforward symbolization in SDL: \n(1)–(4) certainly appear to describe a possible situation. They\nappear to constitute both a mutually consistent and\nlogically independent set of sentences. Note that (1) is a\nprimary obligation, saying what Jones ought to do\nunconditionally. (2) is a compatible-with-duty obligation,\ntelling us what else Jones ought to do on the condition that Jones\nfulfills his primary obligation. In contrast, (3) is a\ncontrary-to-duty obligation or “imperative” (a\n“CTD”) expressing what Jones ought to do\nconditional on his violating his primary obligation. (4) is a factual\nclaim, which conjoined with (1), implies that Jones violates\nhis primary obligation. Thus this puzzle also places not only deontic\nconditional constructions, but the violability of\nobligations, at center stage. It raises the challenging question: what\nconstitutes proper reasoning about what to do in the face of\nviolations of obligations? \nOne obvious answer would be: just apply SDL to\n(1′)–(4′) above. The following table displays the\ndifficulties in trying in to interpret the reasoning in SDL: \nFrom (1′), (2′), \\(\\OB t.\\)\n\nFrom (3′), (4′), \\(\\OB \\neg t.\\)\n\nBy NC, consistency is lost. \n(1′) implies (3″ ). \nIndependence is lost. \n(4′) implies (2″). \nIndependence is lost. \nThe first path, as Chisholm notes, leads to contradiction via\n\\(\\OB\\)-K, MP and NC. The second and third paths take a different\nroute, interpreting the conditionals in (2) and (3) uniformly.\nHowever, for the second path, the symbolization of (3) follows from\nthat of (1), and for the third path, the symbolization of (2) follows\nfrom that of (4). Each SDL symbolization of the original violates one\nof our desiderata: either mutual consistency or joint\nindependence. \nIf von Wright launched deontic logic as an academic area of research,\nChisholm’s paradox, and similar cases, were the booster rocket\nthat provided the escape velocity deontic logic needed from\n subsumption\n under normal modal logics, thus solidifying deontic logic’s\nstatus as a distinct branch of\n logic.[44]\n It is now virtually universally acknowledged that Chisholm was right:\nthe sort of conditional deontic claim expressed in (3) can’t be\nfaithfully represented in SDL, nor more generally by a composite of\nsome sort of unary deontic operator and material conditional.\nThe views diverge however where it comes to exactly what should be\nadded to SDL in order to represent conditional obligations. This\ndivergence in turn relates to a distinction between two types of\ndetachment in deontic\n reasoning.[45] \nLet “\\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\)” be shorthand for a conditional\nobligation or ought statement like that in the natural language\nsentence, (3), above. So we will read \\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) as “if\n\\(p\\), then it ought to be (or it is obligatory) that \\(q\\)”.\nSuppose we also assume that monadic obligations are disguised dyadic\nobligations, per the following analysis: \nThis analysis has been widely\n employed.[46] \nWith this in mind, we distinguish between two relevant types\nof“detachment principles” (Greenspan 1975) that we might\nascribe to these iffy-‘ought’s: \nFactual detachment tells us that from \\(p\\), and a deontic\nconditional to the effect that if \\(p\\) then it ought to be that\n\\(q\\), we can conclude that it ought to be that \\(q\\). Deontic\nDetachment in contrast tells us that from it ought to be that\n\\(p\\) and if \\(p\\), then it ought to be that \\(q\\), we can conclude\nthat it ought to be that \\(q\\). If we interpret a deontic conditional\nas a material conditional with an obligatory consequent (as in\n(3′) above), FD, but not DD is supported. Conversely, if we\ninterpret deontic conditionals as obligatory material conditionals (as\nin (2′) above), DD, but not FD is supported. Although we have\nshown earlier that neither of these interpretations is acceptable, the\ncontrast reveals a general problem. Unrestricted endorsement of both\ntypes of detachment is not tenable, since it leads implausibly to the\nconclusion that Jones is both obligated to tell (the neighbor he is\ncoming) and obligated to not tell. Thus researchers tended to part\ncompany over which principle of the two to endorse (Loewer and Belzer\n1983). \nThe Factual Detachment camp typically endorses the view that the\nconditional in (3) in the Chisholm Quartet needs to be interpreted as\na non-material conditional, but otherwise things are as they seem in\n(3): we have a conditional obligation that is a simple composite of a\nnon-material conditional and a pure unary deontic operator in the\nconsequent: \n\\(\\OB (q\\mid p) \\eqdf p \\Rightarrow \\OB q\\), for some independent\n conditional.[48] \nTypically, the conditional \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is of the sort made famous\nby Stalnaker and Lewis (Stalnaker 1968, Lewis\n 1973).[49]\n It is then generally maintained that deontic detachment is flawed,\nsince the conditional obligations like those in (2) tell us only what\nto do in ideal circumstances, but they do not necessarily provide\n “cues”[50]\n for action in the actual world, where things are often\ntypically quite sub-ideal, as (4) combined with (1) indicate. Thus\nfrom the fact that Jones ought to go and he ought to tell if he goes,\nit doesn’t follow that what he ought to actually do is\ntell—that would be so only if it was also a fact that he goes to\ntheir aid. At best, we can only say that he ought ideally to\ngo. \nThis suggestion seems a bit more difficult when we change the\nconditional to something like “If Doe does kill his mother, then\nit is obligatory that Doe kills her gently” (Forrester 1984).\nThe idea that my obligation to not kill my mother gently (say for an\ninheritance) merely expresses an “ideal” obligation, but\nnot an actual obligation, given that I will kill her, seems hard to\nswallow. So this case makes matters a bit harder for those favoring a\nfactual detachment approach for generating actual obligations.\nSimilarly, it would seem that if it is impermissible for me to kill my\nmother, then it is impermissible for me to do so gently, or to do so\nwhile\n dancing.[51]\n So carte blanche factual detachment seems to allow the mere\nfact that I will take an action in the future (killing my mother) that\nis horribly wrong and completely avoidable now to render obligatory\nanother horrible (but slightly less horrible) action in the future\n(killing my mother gently). The latter action must be completely\navoidable if the former is, and the latter action is one that I would\nseem to be equally obligated to not perform intuitively. \nThe deontic detachment camp represented conditional obligations via\ndyadic non-composite obligation operators modeled syntactically on\nconditional probability, following Danielsson 1968; B. Hansson 1969;\nvon Wright 1956, 1964; Lewis 1973, 1974; and Feldman\n 1986.[52]\n On this view, deontic conditionals are viewed as idioms: the meaning\nof the compound is not a straightforward function of the meaning of\nthe parts. The underlying intuition regarding the Chisholm example is\nthat even if it might be true that we will violate some obligation,\nthat doesn’t get us off the hook from obligations that derive\nfrom the original one that we will violate. If I must go help and I\nmust inform my neighbors that I’m coming, if I do go help, then\nI must inform them, and the fact that I will in fact violate the\nprimary obligation does not block the derivative obligation any more\nthan it blocks the primary obligation. \nOne early semantic picture for the latter camp was that a sentence of\nthe form \\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) is true at a world \\(i\\) iff the \\(i\\)-best\n\\(p\\)-worlds are all \\(q\\)-worlds. \\(\\OB q\\) is then true iff \\(\\OB\n(q\\mid \\top),\\) and so iff all the unqualifiedly \\(i\\)-best worlds are\n\\(q\\)-worlds (B. Hansson 1969). Note that this weds preference-based\nsemantic orderings with dyadic conditional\n obligations.[53]\n This reflects a widespread trend. Factual detachment does not work in\nthis case, since even if our world is an I-don’t-go-help-world,\nand the best among the I-don’t-go-help-worlds are\nI-don’t-call-worlds, it does not follow that the\nunqualifiedly best worlds are I-don’t-call-worlds. In\nthis example, these authors would maintain that the unqualifiedly best\nworlds are both I-go worlds and I-call worlds, and the fact that I\nwon’t do what I’m supposed to do won’t change\nthat. \nBut one is compelled to ask those in the Deontic Detachment camp: what\nthen is the point of such apparent conditionals if we can’t ever\ndetach them from their apparent antecedents, and how are these\nconditionals related to regular ones? This seems to be the central\nchallenge for this camp. Thus they often endorse a restricted form of\nfactual detachment, of which the following is a representative\ninstance: \nHere \\(\\Box p\\) might mean various things, for example that \\(p\\) is\nphysically unalterable or necessary as of this moment in\n history.[54]\n Only if \\(p\\) is settled true in some sense, can we conclude from\n\\(\\OB (q\\mid p)\\) that \\(\\OB q\\). This certainly helps, but it still\nleaves us with a bit of a puzzle about why this apparent composite of\na conditional and a deontic operator is actually some sort of\nprimitive\n idiom.[55] \nWhile conditional obligations and the puzzles they generate call for\nextensions of SDL, other problems and distinctions in normative\ndiscourse motivate further, mostly orthogonal enrichments. In this\nsection we point to a few of these. \nEven among monadic deontic notions, and even if we stay within the\nrealm of all-things-considered, unconflicted obligations (cf.\n Section 6.3),\n SDL displays various expressive weaknesses compared to our everyday\nand more theorized ethical argumentation. \nLet us start with the distinction between indifference and\n optionality.[56]\n In general, optionality of a given state of affairs or\naction need not imply that it is morally indifferent. For instance, it\nmay be optional that you attend a faculty meeting, but not a matter of\nindifference that you do so. However, when deontic logicians and\nethicists gave an operator label for the condition \\((\\neg \\OB p \\amp\n\\neg \\OB \\neg p)\\), it was almost invariably “It is indifferent\nthat \\(p\\)”, “\\(\\IN p\\)”. It would seem to follow\nfrom the theorem \nthat \nthat is, everything that is neither obligatory nor prohibited is a\nmatter of indifference. But many actions are neither obligatory nor\nprohibited, yet they are hardly matters of indifference. A\nparticularly intriguing class of such actions are those that are\ndeemed supererogatory (e.g., volunteering for a costly or risky good\nendeavor where others are equally qualified and no one person is\nobligated). SDL can represent optionality, but not indifference,\ndespite the fact that the latter concept has been a purported target\nfor representation since nearly its beginning. \nThe distinction between optionality and indifference is moreover\nstrongly linked to that between “must” (and its dual\n“can”) and \n “ought”.[57]\n Consider the following utterance: \nThis seems to be a perfectly sensible piece of advice. (1) appears to\nimply that it is optional that you attend—that you can\nattend and that you can fail to attend. The latter two uses\nof “can” express permissibility. Yet “ought”\nis routinely the reading given for deontic necessity in deontic logic\n(and in ethical theory), and then “permissibility” is\nroutinely presented as its dual. However, if we symbolize (1) above\naccordingly, we get, \nwhich is just \\(\\neg \\OB p \\amp \\OB p\\) in disguise (given \\(\\OB\\)-RE\nand the Traditional Definitional Scheme). So (1′), given NC,\nyields a contradiction. Another way to put this is that the\n“can” of permissibility seems to be the dual of\n“must” not the dual of “ought”. This yields a\ndilemma: either deontic necessity represents “ought”, in\nwhich case, its dual does not represent permissibility (and neither\ndoes any other construction in SDL), or permissibility is represented,\nbut “ought” is inexpressible, despite the ubiquitous\nassumption otherwise. That “ought” is the dual of\npermissibility is really a largely overlooked dubious yet pervasive\nbipartisan presupposition in both ethical theory and deontic\n logic.[58] \nA widely neglected normative notion is exemplified by the following\n complaint:[59] \nThe expression in the second clause of (LYCD), i.e., “the least\nyou could do”, has been largely ignored in the literature on\ndeontic logic and ethical theory both. (LYCD) appears to express the\nidea that there is some minimal but acceptable alternative. This\nnotion of what is minimally acceptable among the permissible options\nis not expressible in SDL. \nTo go beyond the call of duty or to supererogate is to permissibly do\nmore than you would do if you did the least you could \n do.[60]\n It has a\nmirror image, permissible suboptimality, or that which you\ncan but ought not do. These are plainly not representable in SDL,\ngiven the preceding remarks. \nMcNamara 1996c and Mares & McNamara 1997 provides a semantic and\nlogical framework for distinguishing “must” from\n“ought”, indifference from optionality, as well as\ndistinctly representing “the least you can do” idiom and\nanalyzing one central sense of “supererogation” via that\notherwise unstudied idiom. As a measure of the increased expressive\npower, the three-fold partition of normative positions for SDL is\nextended to a twelve-fold partition; with an extension to accommodate\npraiseworthiness and blameworthiness (McNamara 2011a,b), an\neighty-four fold partition results. See McNamara forthcoming for a\nthorough introduction to this area of research. \nWe routinely talk about both what ought to be and what people\nought to do. These hardly look like the same things (for\nexample, the latter notion calls for an agent, the former does not).\nThis issue, and the general issue of representing agency in deontic\nlogic has been much discussed, and continues to be an area of active\nconcern. In the present section we provide an overview of the\nliterature on deontic logics that allow for the expression of agency;\nin\n Section 6.2\n we consider a more fundamental revision of SDL in order to\naccommodate deontic claims about actions. \nLet us start by introducing some basics from the logical study of\n agency.[61]\n Here, the idea is that we treat expressions of the type “x\nbrings it about that” or “x sees to it that” as\nagent-indexed modal operators. Focusing, as we will do here, on the\ncase of a single agent called Jane Doe, let us introduce the following\nnotation: \nThen the following claims expressing Jane Doe’s agency with\nrespect to a proposition p are to be distinguished: \nPlainly, if neither of the first two hold, then the conjunction of the\nlast two holds. In such a case we might say that Jane Doe is\npassive with respect to \\(p\\), or more adequately, passive\nwith respect to herself bringing about p or its\n negation.[63]\n Let’s introduce \\(\\PV\\) as an abbreviation for\n this:[64] \nSee also supplement E:\n Non-Performance versus Refraining/Forbearing. \nHaving thus enriched our propositional language, we can now consider\nsome logical principles for the new operator. Virtually all accounts\ntake it to satisfy the rule for replacement of equivalents: \nIf \\(p \\leftrightarrow q\\) is a theorem, so is \\(\\BA p \\leftrightarrow\n\\BA q\\) (\\(\\BA\\)-RE), \nas well as the truth scheme, \nTaken together, these principles entail that, relative to a fixed\nproposition \\(p\\) and an agent, a threefold partition emerges: \nFig. 16 \nReturning to deontic matters, we can now ask: how do we represent\nagential obligation? With an agency operator in hand, we might invoke\nthe famous Meinong-Chisholm Reduction: the idea that what\nJane ought to do is what it ought to be that she\n does.[66]\n If we regiment this a bit using our operator for agency, we get the\nfollowing versions of the “reduction”: \nMeinong-Chisholm Reduction: Jane Doe is obligated to bring it\nabout that \\(p\\) iff it is obligatory that Jane Doe brings it about\nthat \\(p\\). \nThis is sometimes taken to be a reduction of personal, agentive\nobligation to impersonal obligation on the one hand, and (mere) agency\non the other. In terms of modal operators, it is a reduction of\n“ought to do” to “ought to be” and\n“brings it about\n that”.[67]\n Although not uncontested (cf. Section 5.2.4 below), by relying on\nthis analysis we can make many fine distinctions. Suppose, for\ninstance, that “Jane Doe lights the candle” is equivalent\nto “Jane Doe sees to it that the candle is lit”, and let\n“the candle is lit” be represented by p. Then we can\ndistinguish the following claims, while keeping track of their formal\ninterrelations: \nHere, (2′) would, e.g., express that Jane Doe is positively\nobligated to not bring it about that \\(p\\); note that this need not\npreclude that some other agent can still bring it about that \\(p\\), or\nthat \\(p\\) is in itself obligatory. Note also that (2′) is\ndistinct from (5′), which merely expresses that it is not\nrequired of Jane Doe that she lights the candle. That is, Jane’s\nlighting the candle would be a violation of (2), but not of (5). (3)\nis, on most accounts of agency and obligation, strictly stronger than\n(2): (3) implies not only that Jane should not light the candle, but\nthat she should bring it about that no one else lights the candle\neither (e.g., by keeping it in some locked box). \nLogics that combine operators for (impersonal) obligation and agency\nhave been very widely\n employed.[68]\n Krogh and Herrestad 1996 reinterpret the Meinong-Chisholm analysis so\nthat the deontic operator is personal, yet not agential. This\nis arguably a more plausible way to preserve a componential analysis\nof agential obligation. McNamara 2004a also makes the case that a\nperson’s being obligated to be such that a certain condition\nholds (e.g., being obligated to be at home at noon, as promised) is\nthe more basic idiom, and being obligated to bring about something is\njust being obligated to be such that you do bring it about. \nOne way in which agency operators have been fruitfully employed is in\nthe study of what are called normative\n positions.[69]\n A set of normative positions is intended to describe the set of\nmutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive positions that a person or\nset of persons may be in regarding a proposition and with respect to a\nlogic governing a set of selected primitive normative statuses and/or\nagency operators. Recall the partition regarding how Jane Doe may be\npositioned agentially with respect to \\(p\\): she may either bring\nabout \\(p\\), bring about its negation, or be passive with respect to\n\\(p\\). Now also recall our partition with respect obligation from\n Section 1: \nFig. 17  \nWe might consider “merging” these two partitions, as it\nwere, and try to get a representation of the possible ways Jane Doe\nmay be positioned normatively with respect to her agency regarding\n\\(p\\). Given certain choices of logic for \\(\\BA\\) and for \\(\\OB\\), we\nobtain a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive “normative\npositions”: \nThe Meinong-Chisholm analysis that lies at the core of the theory of\nnormative positions is, however, not uncontested. Following an earlier\ncriticism by Geach (1982), in the third chapter of the influential monograph,\nHorty (2001), Horty has attacked one specific form of the\nMeinong-Chisholm reduction from a semantic viewpoint. Recall that in\nthe standard semantics for SDL, for any formula p, \\(\\OB\\)p is true\nwhenever p holds at all the deontically best alternatives. Horty shows\nthat, when combined with the STIT semantics for agency championed in\nBelnap et al. 2001, this gives rise to counterintuitive\n cases.[70]\n Suppose, e.g., that an agent can choose between two things: to gamble\nor not to gamble. Simplifying somewhat, say all possible states of\naffairs are ones where either the agent gambles, or he doesn’t.\nIf the agent gambles, there is a possibility that he wins $5, but\nthere is also a possibility that he loses the $5 he currently has. If\nhe doesn’t gamble, then he keeps his money but cannot make any\nprofit. Now, granting that worlds where one has more money are better\nthan worlds where one has less, the best worlds are those where the\nagent wins $5. Consequently, the best worlds are worlds in which the\nagent does gamble. Hence, where g denotes that the agent gambles, \nis true in this case. Yet intuitively, it is not true that the agent\nought to gamble. Absent further information, gambling and not gambling\nboth have their pros and cons in this case, and hence one would not\nmake any recommendation for\n either.[71]\n More generally, Horty takes this example to show that from “it\nought to be that the agent brings about \\(p\\)”, it does not\nfollow that “the agent ought to bring about\n \\(p\\)”.[72] \nHorty’s argument has been criticized from various angles: one\nmay, e.g., question whether the same applies to non-standard semantics\nfor \\(\\OB\\) (Broersen & van der Torre 2003; McNamara 2004b), or\none may argue that very similar issues also arise in context where no\nagency is involved (Danielsson 2002). Finally, it should be noted that\nat the syntactic level, relatively little changes to the basic\nproperties of the (now agent-relative) operator \\(\\OB\\): it will still\nbe a KD-type normal modal operator. However, its interaction with\nother such modal operators, and the relation between obligations of\ndifferent agents and groups can now be studied in much more\nfine-grained\n terms.[73]\n Moreover, Horty’s incorporation of game-theoretic ideas into\nthe semantics of deontic logic opens up a whole range of new\npossibilities for logical investigations, a suggestion from Bartha\n2002 that was taken up in Tamminga 2013. \nAnother issue that has been disputed in this context is whether or not\ndeontic operators necessarily call for agential complements or \n not.[74]\n Consider the \nStrict Deontic Complement Thesis (SDCT): Each fundamental\ndeontic status must be followed immediately by an operator ascribing\nagency to an agent (here, by “\\(\\BA\\)”) to be\nwell-formed. \nA strict omission (refraining) is now a formula of the form\n\\(\\RF p\\) (i.e., \\(\\BA \\neg \\BA p)\\). “\\(\\neg \\BA p\\)” is\njust a non-action. Strict deontic omissions are\ndeontic operators immediately followed by strict omissions. Note that\nif we substitute “\\(\\BA p\\)” for “\\(p\\)” in\nthe equivalences associated with the Traditional Definitional Scheme,\nwe obtain formulas that violate SDCT. For instance, the first schema\nwould yield \nEssentially, non-action statements would have to be replaced by strict\nomissions. \nBelnap et al. 2001 provisionally defends SDCT. McNamara 2004a raises\ndoubts about this thesis. He notes that we are sometimes obligated to\nbe a certain way (e.g., to be in our office), and furthermore, it is\nplausible to think that agential obligations reduce to these stative\nobligations— obligations to be the agents of states of affairs,\nso that obligations to be a certain way are analytically prior to\nagential obligations. A related issue is whether there can be cases\nwhere a certain person \\(i\\) faces a given obligation, but these\nobligations can (in principle or even in practice) be fulfilled by\nsome other person \\(j\\)—and hence, they are not, strictly\nspeaking, agential obligations for \\(i\\) (Krogh & Herrestad 1996;\nMcNamara 2004a). \nAside from the preceding operators in this section, there are a number\nof other types of modal operators one could sensibly add to a given\ndeontic logic. Far from being exhaustive, let us just give a few\nexamples and mention well-known issues that arise from such\nenrichments. \nIn some normative systems (e.g., legal systems), explicit permissions,\nprohibitions and obligations are given. So it would seem to be\npossible for there to be normative systems with gaps: systems where\nsomething is neither explicitly obligatory, impermissible, nor\npermissible because, say, it is neither explicitly commanded,\nprohibited or permitted by the relevant authority. For instance, it\nmay well have been undecided, legally speaking, whether storing\nsomeone’s search data on a website was permissible or not prior\nto any new law being cast to regulate this practice. Yet \\(\\OB p\n\\vee(\\PE p \\amp \\PE \\neg p) \\vee \\IM p\\) is a thesis\n(“exhaustion”) of SDL (given the Traditional Definitional\nScheme), which makes any such gaps impossible. There is no place for\nthis fourth category in SDL, as it does not allow for such\nnormative gaps (von Wright\n 1968).[75]\n SDL is not designed to represent a notion of explicitly stated\nobligations, permissions, etc. \nOne way to accommodate gaps, without revising the Traditional\nDefinitional Scheme or the underlying logic of the classical\nconnectives, is by enriching SDL with a modal operator \\(\\NS\\) that\nrefers explicitly to the normative system at hand: \\(\\NS\\OB p\\) then\nmeans something like “according to the normative system, \\(p\\)\nis obligatory”. Normative gaps can be expressed by such\nsentences as \nNote that this is perfectly consistent with the claim \nwhich just says that according to the normative system, the\nproposition \\(p\\) is either obligatory, optional, or\n impermissible.[76] \nOther types of modalities that display interesting interaction with\ndeontic notions are temporal modalities. For instance, it is plausible\nto think that one is obligated to do something only if that\nthing is in the future. This suggests that the deontic necessity\noperator quantifies over states that form a subset of the set of all\nfuture states; and hence a principle of the type \nshould hold. Similar observations can be made in terms of the\nAndersonian-Kangerian reduction of SDL. If we read the deontic\nconstant \\(d\\) atemporally as “all obligations past, present,\nand future are met”, then the only relevant worlds are those so\nideal that in them there has never been a single violation of a\nmandatory norm. But as a parent, I may be obligated to lock the front\ndoor at night even though this would not be a norm unless there had\nbeen past violations of other norms (e.g., against theft and murder).\nPeople also acquire obligations over time, create them for themselves\nand for others, discharge them,\n etc.[77] \nFinally, one may also combine deontic and epistemic or doxastic\nlogics. Such combinations may serve two distinct aims: to capture\ndistinctively epistemic obligations such as “Jane ought to know\nthat there is no cure to this illness (as she is a doctor)”, or\nto study subjective, knowledge-dependent obligations as in\n“Given what you know about their production, you ought not to\nbuy these clothes”. For a famous puzzle concerning the first\ntype of extension, see supplement F on\n the Paradox of Epistemic Obligation. \nFor the second type of extension, a recent puzzle that has received\nmuch attention is the so-called Miners Paradox (Kolodny &\nMacFarlane 2010; Parfit ms. [see\n Other Internet Resources]).\n A proposal for dealing with the latter in the context of deontic STIT\nlogic can be found in Horty 2019; earlier proposals for dealing with\nknowledge-based obligations are Pacuit, Parikh and Cogan 2006 and\nBroersen 2008. Clearly, however fundamental the monadic operators\nrepresented in SDL, they are but a fragment of those employed in\nnormative discourse. \nWhen one meets a problem in formalizing certain aspects of reasoning\nvia a given formal system (e.g., SDL), one may diagnose the situation\nin two different ways: as caused by a lack of expressive power in the\nformalism, one that can be remedied by augmentation, or as a\nfundamental problem with the initial formalism itself calling for\nmodification or replacement of the initial formalism. In the present\nsection, we survey some attempts to revise the foundations of deontic\nlogic, in view of specific puzzles related to SDL and its\nextensions. \nA view still held by some researchers within deontic logic and\nmeta-ethics, and particularly popular in the first few decades\nfollowing the emergence of positivism, was that evaluative sentences\nare not the sort of sentences that can be either true or false. If\nthat view is correct, we seem to be facing a dilemma. On the one hand,\nit seems there can be no logic of normative sentences, since logic is\nthe study of what follows from what, and one thing can follow from\nanother only if the things in question are of the sort that can be\neither true or false. So there can be no deontic logic. On the other\nhand, some normative sentences do seem to follow from others, and\nthere appear to be logical relations between distinct (possibly\nlogically complex) deontic statements, so there can be deontic logic\nafter all. What to do? This is Jörgensen’s dilemma. \nA widespread distinction that was put forward in an attempt to\novercome the dilemma is that between a norm and a\nnormative\n proposition.[78]\n Consider a normative sentence such as “You may park here for\none hour”. This sentence may be used by an authority to provide\npermission on the spot or it may be used by a passerby to report on an\nalready existing norm (e.g., a standing municipal regulation). The\nactivity of using a normative sentence as in the first case is\nsometimes referred to as “norming”—it creates a norm\nby granting permission by the very use of the sentence. The second use\nis often said to be descriptive, since the sentence is then not used\nto grant permission, but to report that permission to do so is a\nstanding state. It is often maintained that the two uses are mutually\nexclusive, and only the latter use allows for truth or falsity. Some\nhave however challenged the exclusiveness of the division, by blending\nsemantics and speech-act theory (especially regarding performatives).\nThey thereby suggest that one who is in authority to grant a\npermission can not only grant it by performing the speech act of\nuttering the relevant sentence (as in the first example), but also\nthereby makes what it said true— that the person is\npermitted to park (as in the second example with the\n passerby)).[79] \nIf one agrees that norm-propositions are distinct from norms, one may\ninsist that the realm of deontic logic is limited to\nnorm-propositions, perhaps interpreted with a standard semantics in\nterms of truth at possible worlds. Where some normative system, \\(n\\),\nis the basis in some state, \\(w\\), for a set of normative\npropositions, one could just say that \\(\\OB p\\) is true at a state,\n\\(w\\), in virtue of the fact that according to the norms in \\(n\\) that\napply in \\(w\\), \\(p\\) is required. However, this still leaves a\nJörgensenian gap: it remains unclear what it means that a set of\nnorms requires a certain state of affairs (given the way the world\ncurrently is). Isn’t there still a need for a framework to model\nsystems of norms, their possible structural features, and how they\ngenerate normative propositions? If a normative system \\(n\\) requires\n\\(p\\) and \\(n\\) also requires \\(q\\), how does it do so, and\ndoes it then also require \\((p \\amp q)\\), and if so, in virtue of\nwhat features of\n \\(n\\)?[80] \nAn alternative route is to give up on truth-functional (possible\nworld) semantics. One may, e.g., assume a primitive notion of\n“norms” (sometimes also called “imperatives”),\nwhich generate “obligations” in a purely syntactic\nfashion. Originating in the work on conflict-tolerant deontic logics\n(van Fraassen 1973, cf. Hansen 2008 and Hansen 2013), this route\nbecame most influential under the banner of Input/Output logic\n(Makinson & van der Torre 2000, 2001; Parent & van der Torre\n2013). The “semantics” of I/O-logics is purely\noperational: it specifies a set of obligations (propositional\nformulas) that result from the application of factual detachment to\n(a) a set of factual statements (closed under PC) and (b) a set of\nconditional norms, i.e., pairs of propositional formulas, closed under\na given set of logical rules, R. Variations regarding R give rise to\nvarious “input/output relations” (hence, I/O-logics). See\nParent and van der Torre 2018 for a short primer. \nThe I/O-logic framework has proven useful in a number of respects: it\nputs factual detachment where, for many, it belongs: at the very core\nof deontic reasoning. It allows for many fine-grained distinctions and\nnuanced accounts of the interplay between detachment and logical\nreasoning about facts and norms that seem hard to characterize in\nterms of classical possible worlds-semantics. Finally, it can\naccommodate various notions of permission and their relation to\nobligation (Makinson & van der Torre 2003). On the downside, how\nto integrate a procedural semantics from I/O-logic with semantics for\nepistemic logics, logics of agency, and the like is far from obvious.\nMore generally, since in I/O-logic the notion of obligation\nis—by definition—one of an “output”, it is\nunclear how, e.g., truth-functional connectives or other modal\noperators can be applied to statements concerning obligation (e.g., it\nis believed that murder is wrong and sometimes done), or what a nested\nstatement like “it is permissible that it is obligatory that\np” would mean in this\n framework.[81] \nWe often apply terms such as “must”, “ought”,\nand “can” to actions rather than to states of affairs. For\ninstance, we would say that “Jimmy must tie his\nshoelaces”, rather than “it is obligatory (for Jimmy) that\nJimmy’s shoelaces are tied”. Likewise, we make claims such\nas “Jack must get the groceries” and “you can turn\nleft here”. In each of these three examples, it seems we signal\nthe deontic status of a certain action— an agent-initiated\nway of changing the current world, or bringing it into a\ndifferent state. However, the by now common reading of\nSDL—deviating from von Wright’s original interpretation\n(recall\n supplement B, von Wright’s 1951a System and SDL),\n has it that we can always apply the deontic modals to propositions\ninstead. \nVarious semantics have been developed in which deontic terms are\napplied directly to actions, conceived as transitions between states\nin a Kripke-model. For instance, following the reduction of SDL to\nalethic modal logic (cf.\n Section 3),\n Meyer 1988 adds an Andersonian “violation” constant V to\n propositional dynamic logic\n (PDL). In this framework, [\\(\\alpha\\)]V expresses that executing the\naction \\(\\alpha\\) necessarily leads to a violation, hence,\n“\\(\\alpha\\) is forbidden”. Where \\(-\\alpha\\) denotes the\nnegation of action \\(\\alpha\\), [\\(-\\alpha\\)]V then represents that\n\\(\\alpha\\) is\n obligatory.[82]\n Note that intuitively, this formula can be read as: “whenever\n\\(\\alpha\\) is not carried out, a violation occurs”.\nAlternatively, one may define a notion of strong\npermissibility of an action \\(\\alpha\\), by introducing a Kangerian\nconstant “OK” and expressing that \\(\\alpha\\) is strongly\npermissible by [\\(\\alpha\\)]OK. This means, intuitively, that whenever\none executes the action \\(\\alpha\\), then one is guaranteed to end up\nin a world that is deontically acceptable (no violation\n occurs).[83] \nMeyer’s analysis reduces the deontic status of a given action\n(at a given state w) to the occurrence of violations in its terminal\nstates (reachable from w through that action), giving rise to\nso-called “goal norms”. In contrast, one may also consider\n“process norms” that concern all the intermediate states\nthat are “passed by” when carrying out a given action at a\nstate. Deontic logics of the latter type have been proposed in van der\nMeyden 1996; see Broersen 2004, Kulicki and Trypuz 2017, Canavotto and\nGiordani 2019 for discussions of this distinction. \nA different approach to actions in deontic logic originates in\nSegerberg 1982, and further developed inter alia in Kulicki\nand Trypuz 2017. Here, a Boolean algebra of actions is\nproposed—analogous to the Boolean algebra of PC—and one\ndefines functions that specify which (basic and complex) actions are\npermissible, forbidden, or required. An expression like “\\(P\n\\alpha\\)” then just means that \\(\\alpha\\) is a member of the set\nof permitted actions, and such expressions are used to build more\ncomplex ones using classical propositional connectives. Whereas in\ndynamic deontic logic, the deontic behavior of complex actions is\ngoverned by the underlying logic of actions (i.e., PDL), in deontic\nlogics over Boolean action algebras, specific frame conditions are\nimposed to ensure that, e.g., “action \\(\\alpha\\) is\nforbidden” entails that “doing \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\n(say, simultaneously) is\n forbidden”.[84] \nRather than questioning its semantic foundations on their own terms,\none may also argue against SDL in view of the logical principles it\nvalidates. Here we outline a number of distinct arguments and examples\nthat have been raised against specific principles of SDL, after which\nwe show how some of these can be overcome by moving to weaker\nsystems. \nLet us start with \\(\\OB\\)-NEC. This rule requires that any\ntautological statement is obligatory. Now consider the following\nstatement: \nIt seems that what (1) expresses, an absence of obligations, is\npossible. For example, consider a time when no rational agents existed\nin the universe. Why should we think that any obligations—even\nthose pertaining to tautological states of affairs—existed\n then?[85] \nIf we are reading \\(\\OB\\) as simply “it ought to be the case\nthat”, it is not clear that there is anything counterintuitive\nabout \\(\\OB \\top\\) (now read as, essentially, “it ought to be\nthat contradictions are false”), but there is also no longer any\nobvious connection to what is obligatory or permissible for that\nreading, or to what people ought to do. A different way of avoiding\nthe counterintuitive consequences of \\(\\OB\\)-NEC is by distinguishing\nbetween “vacuous” obligations such as \\(\\OB (p \\vee \\neg\np)\\) and those that require the satisfaction of some logically\ncontingent statement such as \\(\\OB (p \\amp \\neg q)\\). This can, e.g.,\nbe done by enriching one’s language with a modal operator\n\\(\\Box\\) for “settled true” (cf. Belnap 2001 et al., Horty\n2001). \nNext on the list of problematic principles is \\(\\OB\\)-RM, also known\nas the principle of Inheritance. This principle states that whenever\nsomething is obligatory, then everything that is a logical consequence\nis also obligatory (“inherits” that status). There are\nvarious well-known examples highlighting problems with \\(\\OB\\)-RM. The\nearliest and most well-known challenge to RM is Ross’s\nParadox (Ross 1941). From \nformalized as \\(\\OB m\\), we can derive: \nFormalized as \\(\\OB(m \\vee b)\\). It seems rather odd to say that an\nobligation to mail the letter entails an obligation to mail the letter\nor burn it (where burning the letter is presumably forbidden), one\nthat can be fulfilled by burning the letter, which invites from the\noffender: “Well at least I did one thing right by burning\nit”. \nWhile weakening from \\(m\\) to \\(m \\vee b\\) gives problems, similar\nissues arise when we weaken a conjunction to one of its conjuncts.\nThis is illustrated by the famous Good Samaritan Paradox\n(Prior\n 1958):[86] \nSupposing that Jones helps Smith who has been robbed if and only if\nJones helps Smith and Smith has been robbed, it would appear that a\ncorrect way to symbolize (1) and (2) in SDLs is: \nBy \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB(h \\amp r)\\) entails \\(\\OB r\\). However, it hardly\nseems that if helping the robbed man is obligatory it follows that his\nbeing robbed is likewise\n obligatory.[87]\n A much-discussed, epistemic variant of the Good Samaritan is\ndiscussed in supplement F,\n the Paradox of Epistemic Obligation. \nThere have been various responses to these RM-related paradoxes. Some\ndefend RM and blame the Ross paradox on an elementary confusion\n(Føllesdal & Hilpinen 1971) or cite pragmatic features to\nexplain away the puzzle (Castañeda 1981): no one would, e.g.,\nmerely utter the statement that John ought to mail or burn the letter,\nknowing that in fact John ought to just mail the letter. Similarly, it\nhas been argued that the Good Samaritan paradox is really a\nconditional obligation paradox, and so RM is not the real source of\nthe paradox (Castañeda 1981; Tomberlin 1981). However, since\nthese paradoxes all at least appear to depend on \\(\\OB\\)-RM,\na natural solution to the problems is to undercut the paradoxes by\nrejecting \\(\\OB\\)-RM itself. Two accessible and closely related\nexamples of approaches to deontic logic that reject \\(\\OB\\)-RM from a\nprincipled philosophical perspective are Jackson 1985 and Goble\n 1990a.[88]\n A third, somewhat different principled strategy is proposed in\nCariani 2013 and studied in formal detail in Van De Putte 2019.\nFinally, in S. O. Hansson 1990, and more elaborately in Hansson 2001,\nS.O. Hansson develops systems of deontic logic where he analyzes\nprohibitive and prescriptive deontic notions in terms of abstract\nproperties of various preference orderings (e.g., a normative status\nis prohibitive whenever anything worse than something that has that\nstatus also has it). He also sees \\(\\OB\\)-RM as the main culprit in\nthe paradoxes of standard deontic logic, and thus he methodically\nexplores non-standard frameworks where \\(\\OB\\)-RM is not\n sound.[89] \nOne very general semantic framework for logics that can invalidate\nnecessitation, inheritance, or other principles of normal modal logics\nis the neighborhood semantic\n framework.[90]\n , A neighborhood semantics works with a set of possible worlds (just\nlike Kripke-semantics) but replaces the accessibility relation with a\nneighborhood function \\(\\rN\\) that maps every world \\(w\\) onto a set\nof sets \\(X, Y,\\ldots\\) of possible worlds \\(\\rN(w)\\), often thought\nof as a set of propositions. On such a semantics, \\(\\OB p\\) is true at\na world \\(w\\) iff the set of all \\(p\\)-worlds is in the neighborhood\nof \\(w\\), i.e. \nOn the weakest logic characterized by such neighborhood models (the\nminimal “classical modal logic”, E), only \\(\\OB\\)-RE is\nvalid. Additional validities and rules can be obtained by imposing\nspecific conditions on the neighborhood functions. Furthermore,\nneighborhood semantics can be naturally generalized to deal with\nconditional obligations (Chellas 1974, 1980), and combined with\nsemantic accounts of related concepts such as agency and ability\n(McNamara 2019). It can also accommodate conflict-tolerant logics, as\nwe will see next. \nA conflict of obligations is a situation where there are two\nor more obligations and it is not possible for all of them to be\nfulfilled. A specific, paradigmatic case is the one where we have two\nobligations that are logically incompatible, such as: \nHere it would seem that I have a conflict of obligations, in fact a\nquite direct and explicit one, since what I promised one person would\nhappen, I promised another would not happen. People do (e.g., under\npressure or distraction) make conflicting promises (cf. conflicting\nappointments), and it appears that they incur conflicting obligations\nas a\n result.[92]\n But consider the natural representation of these in SDLs: \nThese premises are inconsistent in SDL. First, they are simply\nexcluded by NC \\((\\OB p \\rightarrow \\neg \\OB \\neg\n p)\\).[93]\n But merely giving up NC is not sufficient. In fact, any normal modal\nlogic (hence, any logic that contains K and Necessitation, or\nequivalently, \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB\\)-C, and RE based on PC) will generate\ndeontic explosion: \nIn effect this means that once one has conflicting obligations,\neverything is obligatory. Apart from this trivializing aspect, the\nvalidity of \\(\\OB\\)-RM and \\(\\OB\\)-C also means that having two\nincompatible obligations implausibly reduces to having a single\nself-contradictory obligation, cf.\n supplement G, Collapse of conflicts into impossible obligations. \nAs for \\(\\OB\\)-N and \\(\\OB\\)-RM, this problem can be tackled in\nvarious ways. Let us start with those who develop conflict-tolerant\ndeontic logics, by giving up one or more of the aforementioned\nprinciples. This gives rise to three distinct classes of such\nlogics: \nHowever, giving up on any of these three principles may be too\ndrastic. Suppose, e.g., that, apart from the obligations (1) and (2)\nmentioned above, I also face the obligation to visit Tom (\\(t\\)), and\nin case I visit Tom, to hand him over a letter from Jane (\\(l\\)). So\nwe have as premises \\(\\OB j\\), \\(\\OB \\neg j\\), \\(\\OB t\\), \\(\\OB (t\n\\rightarrow l)\\). Suppose moreover that \\(t\\) and \\(l\\) are perfectly\ncompatible with either of \\(j\\) or \\(\\neg j\\). Then any of the three\nabove-mentioned strategies would still invalidate the inference to\n\\(\\OB l\\): we can no longer infer that I ought to hand over the\nletter. \nMore recently, it has been argued that by using a non-monotonic\nframework such as adaptive logics, one can accommodate deontic\nconflicts and yet retain most of the inferential power of SDL. The\nrough idea behind this account is that one only rejects certain\nprinciples of SDL when they concern obligations that are in fact\nconflicted (in view of the premises). See Goble 2013 and Van de Putte,\nBeirlaen, and Meheus forthcoming for an overview of such adaptive\ndeontic logics. \nAnother shortcoming of most existing conflict-tolerant deontic logics\nis that they only focus on the above-mentioned paradigmatic case of\nbinary conflicts between logically contradictory obligations. In\ncontrast, conflicts often arise between obligations that are just\nincompatible in view of the circumstances one finds oneself in, and\nhence have a contingent\n basis.[94]\n In principle, SDL would be perfectly fine with such\n“contingent” conflicts, and we could express them in an\nenriched language by formulas of the type \nHowever, (DC) in combination with (\\(\\OB\\)-C) yields triviality as\nsoon as we endorse a minimalistic version of Kant’s law that\nought implies can: \nSimilar problems arise if we try to formalize contingent deontic\nconflicts following the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction, as shown in\n supplement H, A puzzle surrounding Kant’s law. \nLet us note that a long-ignored and challenging further puzzle for\nconflicting obligations, sometimes called “van Fraassen’s\nPuzzle” and inspired by van Fraassen 1973 has deservedly\nreceived increased attention: Horty 1994, 2003; van der Torre and Tan\n2000; McNamara 2004a; Hansen 2004; and Goble 2005. For a brief general\noverview, see Section 8.4 of Hilpinen and McNamara 2013. \nAn altogether different approach towards conflicting obligations\nconsists in distinguishing between prima facie (or pro\ntanto) obligations, and all-things considered (pro toto)\nobligations, and insisting that SDL and its siblings are logics of the\nlatter notion. This distinction has been famous at least since (Ross\n1939). It can be illustrated by Plato’s Dilemma (Lemmon\n 1962a):[95] \nHere we seem to have an indirect non-explicit conflict of obligations,\nif we assume that satisfying both obligations is practically\nimpossible. Yet, unlike in our prior example, where the two promises\nmight naturally have been on a par, we would all agree that the\nobligation to help my child overrides my obligation to meet\nyou for lunch. In other words, the first obligation is\ndefeated by the second obligation, which takes\nprecedence. Ordinarily, we would also assume that no other\nobligation overrides my obligation to rush my child to the hospital,\nso that this obligation is an all things considered non-overridden\nobligation, but not so for the obligation to meet you for lunch.\nFurthermore, we are also prone to say that the situation is one where\nthe general obligation we have to keep our appointments (or to keep\nour promises, still more generally) has an\nexception—the circumstances are extenuating. \nIf we define an “obligations dilemma” as a conflict of\nobligations where neither of the conflicting obligations is overridden\n(cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 1988), then the case above involves a conflict\nof obligations but not an obligations dilemma. Once we acknowledge\nconflicts of obligation, there is the further issue of representing\nthe logic of reasoning about conflicting obligations where some do or\ndon’t override others, some are or are not defeated, some are,\nsome are not all things considered non-overridden obligations, where\nobligation dilemmas do or don’t exist, where some obligations\nhold generally, but not unexceptionally, some are absolute, etc. So a\ncentral issue here is that of conflicting obligations of different\nweight and the defeasibility of obligations. Clearly,\nthere is no mechanism in SDL for this, since SDL does not allow for\nconflicts to begin with, yet this is an issue that goes well beyond\nthat of merely having a logic that allows for conflicts. There have\nbeen a variety of approaches to this dilemma, and to defeasibility\namong conflicting\n obligations.[96] \nRecently, the puzzles related to \\(\\OB\\)-NEC, Inheritance, and Deontic\nExplosion have been taken to reflect a more general (alleged) feature\nof deontic modals, i.e., their hyperintensionality. In the\nsyntactic sense, a modal operator is hyperintensional if it is not\nclosed under the replacement of classical, truth-functionally\nequivalent formulas. On this view, \\(\\OB p\\) is, e.g., not equivalent\nto \\(\\OB\\) \\(((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q))\\), even if the truth of\n\\(p\\) always coincides with the truth of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg\nq)\\). Semantically, this means that such an operator cannot be\ninterpreted as an intensional modal operator, using (classical)\npossible-worlds semantics. \nA promising recent semantic framework for hyperintensional logics is\nthat of truthmaker semantics (Fine 2017). On such a semantics,\npropositions are interpreted by “truthmakers”, resp.\n“falsemakers” rather than sets of worlds, where these\nentities are related to one another in terms of a merelogical\n(parthood) relation. For instance, a truthmaker for “it\nrains” would be simply a state of it’s raining, nothing\nless and nothing more. A truthmaker for “(it rains and the sun\nshines) or (it rains and the sun does not shine)” can be either\nof two things: a fusion of a state of it’s raining with a state\nof the sun’s shining, or a fusion of a state of it’s\nraining with a state of the sun’s not shining (and hence, the\nlatter, a falsemaker of “the sun shines”). Formally, the\nset of truthmakers of \\(p\\) may, e.g., be \\(\\{X, X'\\}\\), while the set\nof truthmakers of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q)\\) may be \\(\\{X*Y,\\)\n\\(X*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z\\}\\), with the “*” symbol\ndenoting a fusion\n operation.[97]\n Fine applied this framework to the logic of imperatives and to\ndeontic logic proper in a series of papers (Fine 2018a,b) where\n“actions” play the role usually played by truthmakers in\nthe semantics of indicative sentences, and analogous to the\ntruthmaking and falsemaking relations between truthmakers and\npropositions, such actions can be either in compliance with or\ncontravening a given command. For instance, the imperative “Sing\nor dance!” is interpreted in terms of (a) the actions that are\nin (exact) compliance with it, and (b) the actions that are in (exact)\ncontravention of it. For the case of conditional obligations,\nadditional complications arise, as one may also avoid a\nconditional by making its antecedent\n false.[98]\n Similar ideas, though worked out in different ways, can be found in\nAnglberger and Korbmacher 2020, which also relate truthmaker semantics\nto Goble’s logic BDL from Goble 2013. For a full-fledged\ndiscussion of the hyperintensionality of normativity and formal\napproaches to it, see Faroldi 2019. \nPlainly, there are a number of outstanding problems for deontic logic.\nSome see this as a serious defect; others see it merely as a serious\nchallenge, even an attractive one. There is some antecedent reason to\nexpect that the challenges will be great in this area. Normativity is\nchallenging generally, not just in deontic logic. Normative notions\nappear to have strong pragmatic features. Normative notions must\ncombine with notions for agency and with temporal notions to be of\nmaximal interest—which introduces considerable logical\ncomplexity. There is also reason to think that there are hidden\ncomplexities in the interaction of normative notions and conditionals.\nFinally, there appears to be a wide array of normative notions with\ninteresting interactions, some easily conflated with others (by\nethicists as much as deontic logicians). Clearly, there is a lot of\nwork to be done.","contact.mail":"frederik.vandeputte@ugent.be","contact.domain":"ugent.be"}]
