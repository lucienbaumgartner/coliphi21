Di Liscia","entry":"kepler","body.text":"\n\n\n\nJohannes Kepler (1571–1630) is one of the most significant\nrepresentatives of the so-called Scientific Revolution of the\n16th and 17th centuries. Although he received\nonly the basic training of a “magister” and was\nprofessionally oriented towards theology at the beginning of his\ncareer, he rapidly became known for his mathematical skills and\ntheoretical creativity. As a convinced Copernican, Kepler was able to\ndefend the new system on different fronts: against the old astronomers\nwho still sustained the system of Ptolemy, against the Aristotelian\nnatural philosophers, against the followers of the new “mixed\nsystem” of Tycho Brahe—whom Kepler succeeded as Imperial\nMathematician in Prague—and even against the standard Copernican\nposition according to which the new system was to be considered merely\nas a computational device and not necessarily a physical\nreality. Kepler's complete corpus can be hardly summarized as a\n“system” of ideas like scholastic philosophy or the new\nCartesian systems which arose in the second half of the 17th\ncentury. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify two main tendencies,\none linked to Platonism and giving priority to the role of geometry in\nthe structure of the world, the other connected with the Aristotelian\ntradition and accentuating the role of experience and causality in\nepistemology. While he attained immortal fame in astronomy because of\nhis three planetary laws, Kepler also made fundamental contributions\nin the fields of optics and mathematics. To the little-known facts\nregarding Kepler’s indefatigable scientific activity belong his\nefforts to develop different technical devices, for instance, a water\npump, which he tried to patent and apply in different practical\ncontexts (for the documents, see KGW 21.2.2., pp. 509–57 and\n667–691). To his contemporaries he was also a famous\nmathematician and astrologer; for his own part, he wanted to be\nconsidered a philosopher who investigated the innermost structure of\nthe cosmos scientifically.\n\n\n\nJohannes Kepler was born on December 27, 1571 in Weil der Stadt, a\nlittle town near Stuttgart in Württemberg in southwestern Germany.\nUnlike his father Heinrich, who was a soldier and mercenary, his mother\nKatharina was able to foster Kepler's intellectual interests. He\nwas educated in Swabia; firstly, at the schools Leonberg (1576),\nAdelberg (1584) and Maulbronn (1586); later, thanks to support for a\nplace in the famous Tübinger Stift, at the\nUniversity of Tübingen. Here, Kepler became Magister\nArtium (1591) before he began his studies in the Theological\nFaculty. At Tübingen, where he received a solid education in\nlanguages and in science, he met Michael Maestlin, who introduced him\nto the new world system of Copernicus (see Mysterium\nCosmographicum, trans. Duncan, p. 63, and KGW 20.1, VI, pp.\n144–180). \n\nBefore concluding his theology studies at Tübingen, in\nMarch/April 1594 Kepler accepted an offer to teach mathematics as the\nsuccessor to Georg Stadius at the Protestant school in Graz (in\nStyria, Austria). During this period (1594–1600), he composed\nmany official calendars and prognostications and published his first\nsignificant work, the\nMysterium Cosmographicum (= MC), which catapulted him to fame\novernight. On April 27, 1597 Kepler married his first wife, Barbara\nMüller von Mühleck. As a consequence of the anti-Protestant\natmosphere in Graz and thanks also to the positive impact of his MC on\nthe scientific community, he abandoned Graz and moved to Prague in\n1600, to work under the supervision of the great Danish astronomer\nTycho Brahe (1546–1601). His first contact with Tycho was,\nhowever, extremely traumatic, particularly because of the Ursus affair\n(see below Section 4.1). After Tycho's unexpected death on October\n1601 Kepler succeeded him as Imperial Mathematician. During his time\nin Prague, Kepler was particularly productive. He completed his most\nimportant optical works, Astronomiae pars optica\n(=APO) and Dioptrice (=D), published several treatises on\nastrology (De fundamentis astrologiae\ncertioribus, Antwort auf Roeslini Diskurs; Tertius\ninterveniens), discussed Galileo's telescopic discoveries\n(Dissertatio cum nuncio sidereo), and composed his most\nsignificant astronomical work, the\nAstronomia nova (=AN), which contains his first two laws of\nplanetary motion. \n\nOn August 3, 1611 Kepler's wife, Barbara Müller, died.\nIn 1612 he moved to Linz, in Upper Austria, and became a professor at\nthe Landschaftsschule. There, he served as Mathematician of the Upper\nAustrian Estates from 1612 to 1628. In 1613, he married Susanne\nReuttinger, with whom he had six children. In 1615, he completed the\nmathematical works Stereometria doliorum and Messekunst\nArchimedis. At the end of 1617 Kepler successfully defended his\nmother, who had been accused of witchcraft. In 1619 he published his\nprincipal philosophical work, the Harmonice mundi (=HM), and\nwrote, partially at the same time, the Epitome astronomiae\ncopernicanae (=EAC). In 1624 Kepler continued his investigations\non mathematics, publishing his work on logarithms (Chilias\nlogarithmorum…). \n\nIn pursuit of an accurate printer for the Tabulae\nRudolphinae, he moved to Ulm near the end of 1626 and remained\nthere until the end of 1627. In July 1628 he went to Sagan to enter the\nservice of Albrecht von Wallenstein (1583–1634). He died on November\n15, 1630 at Regensburg, where he was to present his financial claims\nbefore the imperial authorities (for Kepler's life,\nCaspar's biography (1993) is still the best work. KGW 19\ncontains biographically relevant documents). \n\nThere is probably no such thing as “Kepler's\nphilosophy” in any pure form. Nevertheless, many attempts to deal\nwith the “philosophy of Kepler” have been made, all of\nwhich are very valuable in their own way. Some studies have\nconcentrated on a particular text (see, for instance, Jardine 1988, for\nthe Defense of Tycho against Ursus), or have followed some\nparticular ideas of Kepler over a longer period of his life and\nscientific career (see, for instance, Martens 2000, on Kepler's\ntheory of the archetypes). Others have tried to determine from a\nphilosophical point of view his place in the development of the\nastronomical revolution from the 15th to the 17th\ncenturies (Koyré 1957 and 1961) or in the more general context\nof the scientific movement of the 17th century (Hall, 1963\nand especially Burtt, 1924). Still others have discussed a long list of\nphilosophical principles operating in Kepler's scientific world,\nand have claimed to have found, by means of such an analysis,\ncompelling evidence for the interaction between science, philosophy,\nand religion (Kozhamthadam, 1994). If, in the particular case of\nKepler, philosophy is immediately related to astronomy, mathematics\nand, finally, “cosmology” (a notion which arises much\nlater), the core of these speculations is to be sought in the spectrum\nof problems with which he dealt in his Mysterium\nCosmographicum and Harmonice Mundi (on this topic, Field\n1988 is one of the most representative works on Kepler). In addition,\nbecause of the particular circumstances of his life and his fascinating\npersonality and genius, the literature on Kepler is extremely\nwide-ranging, covering a spectrum from literary pieces like Max\nBrod's Tycho Brahes Weg zu Gott (1915)—though\nstill not free from mistakes concerning Kepler—to general\nintroductions in the genre of historical novels, and even fictional\nstories and charlatanry on astrology or, running for some years now,\nportraying him as the assassin of Tycho Brahe. However, according to \nrecent reports, it is still a matter of controversy whether Tycho \nwas assassinated at all (see the \n report at phys.org).  Kepler mastered, like the best scientists, the most complicated\ntechnical issues, especially in astronomy, but he always emphasized\nhis philosophical, even theological, approach to the questions he\ndealt with: God manifests himself not only in the words of the\nScriptures but also in the wonderful arrangement of the universe and\nin its conformity with the human intellect. Thus, astronomy represents\nfor Kepler, if done philosophically, the best path to God (see\nHübner 1975; Methuen 1998 and 2009; Jardine 2009). As Kepler at\nthe core of his greatest astronomical work confesses (AN, Part II,\nchap. 7, KGW 6, p.  108, Engl. trans., p. 183), at the beginning of\nhis career he “was able to taste the sweetness of philosophy\n… with no special interest whatsoever in astronomy.” And,\neven in his later work, after having calculated many ephemerides and\ndifferent astronomical data, Kepler writes in a letter of February\n17, 1619 to V. Bianchi: “I also ask you, my friends, that you do\nnot condemn me to the treadmill of mathematical calculations; allow me\ntime for philosophical speculation, my only delight!” (KGW 17,\nlet. N° 827, p.  327, lin. 249– 51). \n\nEspecially where Kepler deals with the geometrical structure of the\ncosmos, he always returns to his Platonic and Neoplatonic framework of\nthought. Thus, the polyhedral hypothesis (see Section 3 below) he\npostulated for the first time in his MC represents a kind of\n“formal cause” constituting the foundational structure of\nthe universe. In addition, an “efficient cause,” which\nrealizes this structure in the corporeal world, is also needed. This\nis, of course, God the Creator, who accomplished His work according to\nthe model of the five regular polyhedra. Kepler reinterprets the\ntraditional statements about the Creation as an image of the Creator\ngiving to the ancient ideas a more systematic and a quantitative\ncharacter. Even the doctrine of the Trinity could be geometrically\nrepresented, taking the center for the Father, the spherical surface\nfor the Son, and the intermediate space, which is mathematically\nexpressed in the regularity of the relationship between the point and\nthe surface, for the Holy Spirit. In Kepler's model, we have to be\nable to reduce all appearances to straightness and curvature as\nproviding the foundation for the geometrical structure of the\nworld's creation. The very first category, through which God\nproduced a fundamental similitude of the created World to Himself, is\nthat of quantity (see MC, chapter 2, KGW pp. 23–26). Furthermore,\nquantity was also introduced into the human soul for the specific\npurpose that this fundamental symmetry could be apprehended and known\nscientifically. \n\nThis kind of speculation also belongs to the basic principles of\nKepler's philosophical optics. In Chapter 1 of APO (“On\nthe Nature of Light”), Kepler gives a new account of this\n“Trinitarian Cosmogony.” As he admits in a letter to\nThomas Harriot (1560–1621), his approach here is more theological than\noptical (KGW 15, let. 394, p. 348, lin. 18). Similar to his\nspeculations in MC, Kepler explains again the symmetry between God and\nthe Creation, but now he goes slightly beyond the limits of a\ntheologico-geometrical reflection. Firstly, he seems to assume that the\nbodies of the world were provided in the Creation with some powers\nwhich enable them to exceed their geometrical limits and to act on\nother bodies (magnetic power is a good example of this). Secondly, the\nprinciple of symmetry introduced into matter constitutes “the\nmost excellent thing in the whole corporeal world, the matrix of the\nanimate faculties, and the chain linking the corporeal and spiritual\nworld” (APO, Engl. trans., p. 19). Thirdly, as expressed by\nKepler in a wonderful, long Latin sentence, with multiple\nsubordinations, this principle “has passed over into the same\nlaws (in leges easdem) by which the world was to be\nfurnished” (ibid., p. 20; the original passage is in KGW 2, p.\n19: the marginal note in the edition is “lucis\nencomium”). Finally, these reflections are concluded with a\nremark, in which—as with Copernicus, Marsilio Ficino, and\nothers—the central position of the Sun is legitimated because\nof its function in spreading light and, indirectly, life. Similar\nspeculations are still present in EAC (KGW 7, pp. 47–48 and 267). It is\nalso worth noting that these speculations are of vital importance to\nthe special way in which Kepler conceived of astrology (see, for\ninstance, De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus with Engl.\ntrans. and commentary in Field 1984). \n\nPhilosophical, geometrical and even theological speculations related\nto the five regular polyhedra, the cube or hexahedron, the\ntetrahedron, the octahedron, the icosahedron and the dodecahedron,\nwere known at least from the time of the ancient Pythagoreans. Since\nPlato's Timaeus, these five geometrical solids played a\nleading role, and for the later tradition they became known as the\n“five Platonic solids”. Plato establishes at the physical and chemical level a\ncorrespondence between them and the five elements—earth, water,\nair, fire and ether—and tries to provide this correspondence\nwith geometrical grounds. A further source of historically decisive\nimportance is the fact that the five regular polyhedra are treated in\nEuclid's Elements of Geometry, a work that for Kepler,\nespecially in the Platonic approach of Proclus, has a central\nposition. At the very beginning of HM Kepler complains about the fact\nthat the modern philosophical and mathematical school of Peter Ramus\n(1515–1572) had not been able to understand the architectonic\nstructure of the Elements, which are crowned with the\ntreatment of the five regular polyhedra. In addition, a revival of\nPlatonic philosophy was taking place in Kepler's time and inspired not\nonly philosophers and mathematicians but also architects, artists and\nillustrators (see Field 1997). \nAmidst this general interest in the regular polyhedra during the\nRenaissance, Kepler was specifically concerned with their application\nin the resolution of a cosmological problem, namely the reality of the\nCopernican system (see Section 5 below). To achieve this goal, he\nintroduced his polyhedral hypothesis already in MC, where he looked\nfor an “a priori” foundation of the Copernican system (see\nAiton 1977, Di Liscia 2009). The background for such an approach seems\nto be that the “a posteriori” way, which according to\nKepler was taken over by Copernicus himself, cannot lead to a\nnecessary affirmation of the reality of the new world system, but only\nto a probable, and hence to an “instrumental”,\nrepresentation of it as a computational device. This is the\n“Osiander” or “Wittenberg Interpretation” of\nCopernicus which Kepler directly attacked not only in his MC but also\nlater in his AN (see Westman 1972 and 1975). In MC, he claimed to have\nfound an answer to the following three main questions: 1) the number\nof the planets; 2) the size of the orbits, i.e., the distances; 3) the\nvelocities of the planets in their orbits. By referring to the\npolyhedral hypothesis (see Figure 1), Kepler found a definitive and\nsimple answer to the first question. By intercalating the polyhedra\nbetween the spheres which carry the planets, one must inevitably\nfinish with the sphere of Saturn surrounding the cube—there are\nno more polyhedra to be intercalated and, as remains the standard case\nfor Renaissance and modern astronomy, there are no more planets to be\ncarried by the spheres. It is absolutely decisive for the consistency\nof the argument that the necessity of the hypothesis is guaranteed by\nthe fact that it already exists as a mathematical demonstration (by\nEuclid, Elements XIII, prop. 18, schol.), according to which\nthere are only five regular (“Platonic” for the tradition)\npolyhedra. For the second and third questions the answer is, of\ncourse, not as evident as for the first one. However, Kepler was able\nto show that distances which are derived from the geometrical model of\nthe five regular bodies fit much better with the Copernican system\nthan with that of Ptolemy. The answer to the third question needs, in\naddition, the introduction of a notion of power that emanates from the\nSun and extends to the outer limit of the universe (see Stephenson\n1987, pp.  9–20). \n\nIn HM, Kepler continues his investigations of the polyhedra at a\ncosmological as well as a mathematical level. In the second book,\ndealing with “congruence” (which here does not mean, as it\ndoes today, “the same size and shape”, but the property of\nfigures filling the surface together with other regular polygons\n– on the plane—or, to build closed geometric solids\n– hence, in space), Kepler made new mathematical discoveries\nworking with tessellations. He discovered two new solids, the so-called\n“small and great stellated dodecahedrons”. \n\nThe treatment of the regular polyhedra constitutes one of the two\nprincipal pillars of HM, Book 5 (chapters 1–2), where the third law is\nformulated (see Caspar in KGW 6, Nachbericht, p. 497, and Engl. trans.\np. xxxiii). Following his approach from MC and complementing it with\noccasional references to his EAC, Kepler makes use again of the\nPlatonic solids to determine the number of the planets and their\ndistances from the Sun. Meanwhile, he has learned that the application\nof his old polyhedral hypothesis has limits. As he tells us in a\nfootnote in the second edition of his MC from 1621, he was earlier\nconvinced of the possibility of explaining the eccentricities of the\nplanetary orbits by values derived “a priori” from this\nhypothesis (MC, Engl. trans., p. 189). Now, with access to the\nobservational data of Tycho, Kepler had to exclude this explanation and\nlook for another. And this is one of the most significant achievements\nof his basic harmonies (which in turn are derived from the regular\npolygons), constituting the second great pillar of Book 5. \n\nAlmost all of Kepler's scientific investigations reflect a\nphilosophical background, and many of his philosophical questions find\ntheir final answer, even if they are of scientific interest, in the\nrealm of theology. From a very modern point of view, one could\nhighlight Kepler's epistemological thought in terms of four\ndifferent items: realism; causality; his philosophy of mathematics; and\nhis—own particular—empiricism. \n\nRealism is a constant and integral part of Kepler's thought,\nand one which appears in sophisticated form from the outset. The reason\nfor this is that his realism always runs parallel to his defense of the\nCopernican worldview, which appeared from his first public\npronouncements and publications. \n\nMany of Kepler's thoughts about epistemology can be found in\nhis Defense of Tycho against Ursus or Contra Ursum\n(=CU), a work which emerged from a polemical framework, the plagiarism\nconflict between Nicolaus Raimarus Ursus (1551–1600) and Tycho Brahe:\ncausality and physicalization of astronomical theories, the concept and\nstatus of astronomical hypotheses, the polemic\n“realism-instrumentalism”, his criticism of skepticism in\ngeneral, the epistemological role of history, etc. It is one of the\nmost significant works ever written on this subject and is sometimes\ncompared with Bacon's Novum organum and\nDescartes' Discourse on Method (Jardine 1988, p. 5; for\nan excellent new edition and complete study of this work see Jardine /\nSegonds 2008). \n\nThe focus of the epistemological issues could be ranked mutatis\nmutandi with modern discussion surrounding the scientific status\nof astronomical theories (however, as Jardine has pointed out, it would\nbe sounder to read Kepler's CU more as a work against skepticism\nthan in the context of the modern realism/instrumentalism polemic). For\nPierre Duhem (1861–1916), for instance, the position of Andreas\nOsiander, which was adopted by Ursus and which was, according to Duhem,\nnaively criticized by Kepler in his MC, represents the modern approach\nknown as “instrumentalism”. According to this\nepistemological position, held by Duhem himself, scientific theories\nare not to be closely linked to the concepts of truth and falsehood.\nHypotheses and scientific laws are nothing more than\n“instruments” for describing and predicting phenomena\n(seldom for explaining them). The aim of physical theories is not to\noffer a causal explanation or to study the causes of phenomena, but\nsimply to represent them. In the best-case scenario, theories are able\nto order and classify what is decisive for their predictive capacity\n(Duhem 1908, 1914). \n\nContrary to Tycho and Kepler, Ursus held a fictionalist position in\nastronomy. Yet in the very beginning of his work De\nhypothesibus, Ursus makes a clear declaration about the nature of\nastronomical theories, which is very similar to the approach suggested\nby Osiander in his forward to Copernicus' De\nrevolutionibus: a hypothesis is a “fictitious\nsupposition”, introduced just for the sake of “saving the\nmotions of the heavenly bodies” and to “calculate\nthem” (trans. Jardine 1988, p. 41) \n\nFollowing his approach in MC and anticipating the opening pages of\nhis later AN (see particularly AN, II.21: “Why, and to what\nextent, may a false hypothesis yield the truth?” Engl. trans.,\npp. 294–301), Kepler addresses the question of Copernicanism and its\nreception by thinkers such as Osiander, who emphasized that the truth\nof astronomical hypotheses cannot necessarily be deduced from the\ncorrect prediction of astronomical facts. According to this interpretation,\nCopernican hypotheses are not necessarily true even if they are able to\nsave the phenomena, otherwise one would commit a fallacia\naffirmationis consequentis. However, according to Kepler,\n“this happens only by chance and not always, but only when the\nerror in the one proposition meets another proposition, whether true or\nfalse, appropriate for eliciting the truth” (trans. Jardine, p.\n140). To be noted is that, as Jardine (2005, p. 137) has pointed out,\nthe modern scientific realist departs from a real independent world,\nwhile Kepler's notion of truth presupposes that neither nature\nnor the human mind are independent of God's mind (Jardine 2005,\np. 137). \n\nThe reality of astronomical hypotheses—and hence the\nsuperiority of the Copernican world system—implied a\nphysicalization of astronomical theories and, in turn, an accentuation\nof causality. Despite Kepler's criticism of Aristotle, this\naspect can actually be considered the realization in the field of\nastronomy of the old Aristotelian ideal of knowledge:\n“knowledge” means to grasp the causes of the\nphenomena. \n\nThus, on the one hand, “causality” is a notion implying\nthe most general idea of “actual scientific knowledge”\nwhich guides and stimulates each investigation. In this sense, Kepler\nalready embarked in his MC on a causal investigation by asking for the\ncause of the number, the sizes and the “motions”\n(= the speeds) of the heavenly spheres (see Section 3 above). \n\nOn the other hand, “causality” implies in Kepler,\naccording to the Aristotelian conception of physical science, the\nconcrete “physical cause”, the efficient cause which\nproduces a motion or is responsible for keeping the body in motion.\nOriginal to Kepler, however, and typical of his approach is the\nresoluteness with which he was convinced that the problem of\nequipollence of the astronomical hypotheses can be resolved and the\nconsequent introduction of the concept of causality into astronomy\n– traditionally a mathematical science. This approach is already\npresent in his MC, where he, for instance, relates for the first time\nthe distances of the planets to a power which emerges from\nthe Sun and decreases in proportion to the distance of each\nplanet, up to the sphere of the fixed stars (see Stephenson 1987, pp.\n9–10). \n\nOne of Kepler's decisive innovations in his MC is that he\nreplaced the “mean Sun” of Copernicus with the real Sun,\nwhich was no longer merely a geometrical point but a body capable of\nphysically influencing the surrounding planets. In addition, in notes\nto the 1621 edition of MC Kepler strongly criticizes the notion of\n“soul” (anima) as a dynamical factor in planetary\nmotion and proposes to substitute “force” (vis)\nfor it (see KGW 8, p. 113, Engl. trans. p. 203, note 3). \n\nOne of the most important philosophical aspects of Kepler's\nAstronomia Nova from 1609 (=AN) is its methodological\napproach and its causal foundation (see Mittelstrass 1972). Kepler was\nsufficiently conscious of the change of perspective he was introducing\ninto astronomy. Hence, he decided to announce this in the full title\nof the work: Astronomia Nova, Aitiologetos, seu physica coelestis,\ntradita commentariis de motibus stellae Martis. Ex observationibus G.\nV. Tychonis Brahe: New Astronomy Based upon Causes or\nCelestial Physics Treated by Means of Commentaries on the Motions of\nthe Star Mars from the observations of Tycho Brahe …\n(trans.  Donahue). In the introduction to AN Kepler insists on his\nradical change of view: his work is about physics, not pure\nkinematical or geometrical astronomy. “Physics”, as in the\ntraditional, Aristotelian understanding of the discipline, deals with\nthe causes of phenomena, and for Kepler that constitutes his ultimate\napproach to deciding between rival hypotheses (AN, Engl. trans.,\np. 48; see Krafft 1991). On the other hand, since his celestial\nphysics uses not only geometrical axioms but also other,\nnon-mathematical axioms, the knowledge obtained often has a kernel of\nguesswork. \n\nIn the third part of AN, chapters 22–40, Kepler deals with the path\nof the Earth and intends to offer a physical account of the Copernican\ntheory. By so doing he includes the idea that a certain notion of power\nshould be made responsible for the regulation of the differences in\nvelocities of the planets, which in turn have to be established in\nrelation to the planets' distances. Now, the Copernican\nplanetary theory departs from the general principle that the Earth\nmoves regularly on an eccentric circle. For Kepler, on the contrary,\nthe planets are moved irregularly, and the slower they are moved, the\ngreater their distance is from the center of power, the Sun. Addressing\nthe physical aspects of his new astronomy, he deals in chapters 32–40,\nperhaps the most idiosyncratic of the work, with his notion of motive\npower. Here, he combines different approaches and sources, sometimes\nproducing—for the purpose of simplifying the whole geometrical\nconstruction of geometrical astronomy by introducing a power causing\nmotions—a new confusion at the dynamical level. To begin with,\nit is not always absolutely clear what kind of power Kepler has in\nmind. He inclines, above all, to the idea of a magnetic power residing\nin the Sun, but he also mentions light and, at least indirectly,\ngravity (which he does not bring into operation in the central chapters\nof the AN but which is to a certain extent implied in his explanations\nusing the model of the balance and which he surely accepts as true for\nthe Sun-Moon system, as he explains in the general introduction).\nSecondly, it is not always clear what this power is and how it acts,\nespecially when he is speaking merely analogically, “as\nif” (particularly in the case of light). Essentially, Kepler\nbreaks down the motions of the planets into two components. On the one\nhand, the planets move around the Sun—at this state of the\ndiscussion—circularly. On the other hand, they exhibit a\nlibration on the Sun-planet vector. The rotation of the Sun is\nresponsible for the motion of the planets. Irradiating from the\nrotating Sun is a power which spreads at the ecliptic plain. This power\ndiminishes with distance to the source of the power, that is, to the\nSun. A decisive work for Kepler's development in his physical\nastronomy is William Gilbert's (1544–1603) De magnete\n(London, 1600), a work which also intends to offer a new physics for\nthe new Copernican cosmology and which surely influenced\nKepler's thoughts about this power. One of the main problems was,\nof course, how to apply the general principles of magnetism to\nplanetary motion, first to explain the difference in velocity on a\ncircular path, and later to give an account of the motion on an\nellipse. Kepler conceives of a model with parallel magnetic fibers\nwhich links the Sun with the planets in such a way that the rotation of\nthe Sun causes the motion of the planets around it. The fibers are born\nin the planets parallel and perpendicular to the lines of apsides by a\nkind of “animal power”. The planets themselves are\npolarized, that is, with one pole they are attracted to the Sun, with\nthe other pole they are pushed away from it. This explains very well\nthe direction of planetary motion: the planets all move in one\ndirection because the Sun rotates in that direction.\nNevertheless, a further problem still seems to remain unresolved:\naccording to Kepler's explication, the planets should move\naround the Sun as fast as the Sun itself rotates, which is not the\ncase. This phenomenon can be explained by referring to a property of\nmatter, which for Kepler has an axiomatic character: the inclinatio\nad quietem, that is, the tendency to rest (see especially AN,\nchap. 39; KGW 3, p. 256). As a consequence, the planets are moved\naround the Sun slower than they would be if the power of the Sun were\nat work alone. \n\nKepler's causal approach is above all present in his\nEpitome, a voluminous work which exercised a considerable\ninfluence on the later development of astronomy. In the second part of\nBook 4, he deals with the motion of the world's parts. Not the\ntwo first laws but rather the third law, which he had recently\nannounced in his HM, is Kepler's starting point; for this law,\nrather than a calculational device for the path of one planet,\nrepresents a general cosmological statement, and thus it is more\nconvenient for his approach here. At the same time, it should be\npointed out that the third law is not necessarily the best point of\ndeparture for a dynamical, causal approach to motion, as Kepler intends\nhere; for, in comparison with the previous causal approaches, the\nquestion of the location of the cause of power responsible for the\nproduction of motion remains relevant. The spheres, which in the\ntraditional view transported the planets, had been abolished since the\ntime of Tycho. Furthermore, Kepler is clearly against the\n“moving intelligences” of the Aristotelian tradition. The\nfact that the orbits are elliptical and not circular, shows that the\nmotions are not caused by a spiritual power but rather by a natural\none, which is internal to the composition of matter. The planets\nthemselves are provided with “inertia”, a\nproperty, as Kepler understood it, that inhibits motion and represents\nan impediment to it. The motive power (vix motrix) comes\nindeed from the Sun, which sends its rays of light and power in all\ndirections. These rays are captured by the planets. Kepler, however,\ntries to explain this behavior of the planets less through astrology\nand much more through magnetism (a physical phenomenon which was by no\nmeans clearly understood in his time). Firstly, the Sun rotates and, by\nso doing, sets in motion the planets around it. Secondly, since the\nplanets are poles of magnets and the Sun itself acts with magnetic\npower, the planets are, at different parts of their orbits, either\nattracted or repelled; in this way the elliptical path is causally\nproduced. Kepler partially gives up the mechanical approach by\npostulating a soul in the Sun which is responsible for its regular\nmotion of rotation, a motion on which, finally, the entire system\ndepends. In fact, the planets are also supposed by Kepler to rotate and\nare therefore provided with “a sort of soul” or some such\nprinciple which produces the rotation. \n\nIn addition to astronomy and cosmology Kepler expanded his causal\napproach to include the fields of optics (see Section 6 below) and\nharmonics (Section 7 below). \n\nBeyond his own original talent, it is clear that Kepler was trained in\nmathematics from his earliest studies at Tübingen. At least\nofficially, his positions at Graz, Prague, Linz, Ulm and Sagan can be\ncharacterized as the typical professional occupations of a\nmathematician in the broadest sense, i.e., including astrology and\nastronomy, theoretical mechanics and pneumatics, metrology, and every\ntopic that could in some way be related to mathematics. Besides the\nfield of astronomy and optics, where mathematics is ordinarily applied\nin different ways, Kepler produced original contributions to the\ntheory of logarithms and above all within his favorite field, geometry\n(especially with his stereometrical investigations). Thus, on account\nof his natural predilection and talent and the importance of\nmathematics, particularly of geometry, for his thought, it is not\nsurprising to find many different passages in his works where he\narticulated his philosophy of mathematics. However, Kepler's principal\nexposition on this topic is to be found in his HM, a work in which the\nfirst two books are purely mathematical in content. As he himself\ndeclares, in HM he played the role “not of a geometer in\nphilosophy but of a philosopher in this part of geometry” (KGW\n6, p. 20, Engl. trans., p.  14). \n\nWhile in philosophical questions related to mathematics, Proclus and\nPlato were Kepler's most important inspirational sources, he did not\nalways see Plato and Aristotle as completely opposed, for the\nlatter—in Kepler's interpretation—also accepted “a\ncertain existence of the mathematical entities” (KGW 14,\nlet. N° 226, p. 265; see Peters, p. 130). To a great extent Kepler\nunderstood his mathematical investigations of HM as a continuation of\nEuclid's Elements, especially of the analysis of\nirrationalities in Book 10. The central notion that he works out here\nis that of “constructability”.  According to Kepler, each\nbranch of knowledge must, in principle, be reducible to geometry if it\nis to be accepted as knowledge in the strong sense (although, in the\ncase of the physics, this condition is, as the AN emphasizes, only a\nnecessary and not a sufficient condition).  Thus, the new principles\nhe was elaborating over the years in astrology were geometrical\nones. A similar case occurs with the basic notions of harmony, which,\nafter Kepler, could be reduced to geometry. Of course, not every\ngeometrical statement is equally relevant and equally fundamental. For\nKepler, the geometrical entities, principles and propositions which\nare especially fundamental are those that can be constructed in the\nclassical sense, i.e., using only ruler (without measurement units)\nand compass. On this are based further notions according to different\ndegrees of “knowability” (scibilitas), which\nbegins with the circle and its diameter. Once again, Kepler understood\nthis within the framework of his cosmological and theological\nphilosophy: geometry, and especially geometrically constructible\nentities, have a higher meaning than other kinds of knowledge because\nGod has used them to delineate and to create this perfect harmonic\nworld. From this point of view, it is clear that Kepler defends a\nPlatonist conception of mathematics, that he cannot assume the\nAristotelian theory of abstraction and that he is not able to accept\nalgebra, at least in the way he understood it.  So, for instance,\nthere are figures that cannot be constructed\n“geometrically”, although they are often assumed as safe\ngeometrical knowledge. The best example of this is perhaps the\nheptagon. This figure cannot be described outside of the circle, and\nin the circle its sides have, of course, a determinate magnitude, but\nthis is not knowable. Kepler himself says that this is important\nbecause here he finds the explanation for why God did not use such\nfigures to structure the world. Consequently, he devotes many pages to\ndiscussing the issue (KGW 6, Prop. 45, pp. 47–56, see also KGW\n9, p. 147).  Certainly for a geometer like Kepler, approximations\nconstitute – as mathematical theory—a painful and\nprecarious way to progress. The philosophical background for his\nrejection of algebra seems to be, at least partially, Aristotelian in\nsome of its basic suppositions: geometrical quantities are continuous\nquantities which therefore cannot be treated with numbers that are, in\nthe inverse, discrete quantities. But the difference from the\nAristotelian ideal of science remains an important one: for Aristotle,\na crossover between arithmetic and geometry is allowed only in the\ncase of the “middle sciences”, while for Kepler all\nknowledge must be reduced to its geometrical foundations. \n\nA general presentation of Kepler's philosophical attitude and\nprinciples is not complete without reference to his link to the world\nof experience. For, despite his mainly theoretical approach in the\nnatural sciences, Kepler often emphasized the significance of\nexperience and, in general, of empirical data. In his correspondence\nthere are many remarks about the significance of observation and\nexperience, as for instance in a letter to Herwart von Hohenburg from\n1598 (KGW 13, let. N° 91, lines 150–152) or from 1603 to Fabricius\n(KGW 14, let. N° 262, p. 191, lines 129–130), to mention only two\nof his most important correspondents. Looking for empirical support for\nthe Copernican system, Kepler compares different astronomical tables in\nhis MC, and in AN he makes extensive use of Tycho's\nobservational treasure trove. In MC (chapter 18) he quotes a long\npassage from Rheticus for the sake of rhetorical support when, as was\nthe case here, the data of the tables he used did not fit perfectly\nwith the calculated values from the polyhedral hypothesis. In this\npassage, the reader learns that the great Copernicus, whose world\nsystem Kepler defends in MC, said one day to Rheticus that it made no\nsense to insist on absolute agreement with the data, because these\nthemselves were surely not perfect. After all, it is questionable\nwhether Kepler, using for instance the Prutenic Tables (1551)\nof Erasmus Reinhold (1511–1553), had access to complete and correct\nempirical information to confirm the Copernican hypothesis in grand\nstyle, as he claimed (for an analysis of Reihold's tables and\ntheir influence see Gingerich 1993, pp. 205–255). \n\nThe situation changed completely when Kepler came into contact at\nPrague with Tycho's observations (which, as Kepler often\nreports, were seldom at his disposal). However, a change of attitude is\nevident in AN, where he used Tycho's observations without\nrestriction (which is something he makes clear in the work's\ntitle). In part 2 (chap. 7–21), he presents the “vicarious\nhypothesis”, which in the end he refutes. This hypothesis\nrepresents the best result which can be reached within the limits of\ntraditional astronomy. This works with circular orbits and with the\nsupposition that the motion of a planet appears regular from a point on\nthe lines of apsides. Against the traditional method, here, Kepler does\nnot cut the eccentricity into equal parts but leaves the partition\nopen. To check his hypothesis, he needs observations of Mars in\nopposition, where Mars, the Earth, and the Sun are at midnight on the\nsame line. From Tycho, he “inherited” ten such\nobservations between the years 1580 and 1600, and to them he added\nanother two for 1602 and 1604. In chapters 17–21, Kepler carries out an\nobservational and computational check of his vicarious hypothesis. On\nthe one hand, he points out that this hypothesis is good enough, since\nthe variations of the calculated positions from the observed positions\nfall within the limits of acceptability (2 minutes of arc). In fact,\nKepler presents this hypothesis as the best hypothesis which can be\nproposed within the framework of a “traditional\nastronomy”, as opposed to his new astronomy, which he will offer\nin the following parts of the work. On the other hand, this hypothesis\ncan be falsified if one takes the observations of the latitudes into\nconsideration. Further calculations with these observations produce a\ndifference of eight minutes, something that cannot be assumed because\nthe observations of Tycho are reliable enough. Kepler's famous\nsentence runs: “these eight minutes alone will have led the way\nto the reformation of all of astronomy” (AN, KGW 3, p. 286; Engl.\ntrans., p. 286). There seems to be agreement that Kepler's AN\ncontains the first explicit consideration of the problem of\nobservational error (for this question see Hon 1987 and Field\n2005). \n\nKepler also gave an important place to experience in the field of\noptics. As a matter of fact, he began his research on optics because of\na disagreement between theory and observation, and he made use of\nscientific instruments he had designed himself (see, for instance, KGW\n21.1, p. 244). Recent research on the problem of the camera\nobscura and the “images in the air” shows, however,\nthe limits of a traditional approach to Kepler's optics\nfollowing the main current of the history of physics. Rather, his\nnotion of experimentum needs to be contextualized within the\nsocial practices and epistemological commitments of his time (see\nDupré 2008). \n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that a similar significance is\nassigned to experience and empirical data in Kepler's\nharmonic-musical and astrological theories, two fields which are\nsubordinated to his greater cosmological project of HM. For astrology,\nhe uses meteorological data, which he recorded for many years, as\nconfirmation material. This material shows that the Earth, as a whole\nliving being, reacts to the aspects which occur regularly in the\nheavens. In his musical theory Kepler was a modern thinker, especially\nbecause of the role he gave to experience. As has been noted (Walker,\n1978, p. 48), Kepler made acoustic experiments with a monochord long\nbefore he wrote his HM. In a letter to Herwart von Hohenburg (KGW 15,\nep. 424, p. 450), he describes how he checked the sound of a string at\ndifferent lengths, establishing in which cases the ear judges the sound\nto be pleasurable. Kepler does not accept that this limitation is\nfounded on arithmetical speculations, even if this was already assumed\nby Plato, whom he often follows, and by the Pythagoreans. On the basis\nof his experiments, Kepler found that there are other divisions of the\nstring that the ear perceives as consonant, i.e., thirds and\nsixths. \n\nIf cosmology is the main framework of Kepler's interest,\nthere is no doubt that, as Field has pointed out, he “felt the\nneed to seek observational support for his model of the Universe”\n(Field 1988, p. 28; see also Field 1982). \n\nToday Kepler is remembered in the history of sciences above all for\nhis three planetary laws, which he produced in very specific contexts\nand at different times. While it is questionable whether he would have\nunderstood these scientific statements as “laws”—and\nit is even arguable that he used this term with a different meaning\nthan we do today—it seems to be clear that all three laws (as a\nlinguistic convention, we may continue to use the term) suppose some\nfundamentals of Kepler's philosophy: (a) realism, (b) causality, (c)\nthe geometric structure of the cosmos. Besides this, it should be\nremarked that the common denominator of all three laws is Kepler's\ndefense of the Copernican worldview, a cosmological system which he\nwas not able to defend without reforming it radically. It is\nnoteworthy that already at the very beginning of his career Kepler\nvehemently defended the reality of the Copernican worldview in a way\nthat he characterized, taking over the terminology from the standard\nAristotelian epistemology, as “a priori” (see above\nSection 3 above and Di Liscia 2009). \n\nThe first two laws were published initially in AN (1609), although it\nis known that Kepler had arrived at these results much earlier. His\nfirst law establishes that the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with\nthe Sun in one of the foci (see Figure 2). According to the second\nlaw, the radius vector from the Sun to a planet P sweeps out equal\nareas, for instance SP1P2\nand SP3P4,in equal times. The\nplanet P is therefore faster at perihelion, where it is\ncloser to the Sun, and slower at aphelion, where it is farther from\nthe Sun.  In accordance with his dynamical approach, Kepler first\nfound the second law and, then, as a further result because of the\neffect produced by the supposed force, the elliptical path of the\nplanets (for the two first planetary laws see especially Aiton 1973, 1975a,\nDavis 1992a-e, and 1998a; Donahue 1994; Wilson 1968 and 1972). \n\nPerhaps the most significant impact of Kepler's two laws can\nbe found by considering their cosmological consequences. The first law\nabolishes the old axiom of the circular orbits of the planets, an axiom\nwhich was still valid not only for pre-Copernican astronomy and\ncosmology but also for Copernicus himself, and for Tycho and Galileo.\nThe second law breaks with another axiom of traditional astronomy,\naccording to which the motion of the planets is uniform in swiftness.\nThe Ptolemaic tradition in astronomy was, of course, aware of this\ndifficulty and applied a particularly effective device for saving the\n“appearance” of acceleration: the equant. Copernicus, for\nhis own part, insisted on the necessity of the axiom of uniform\ncircular motion. Ptolemy's equant was understood by Copernicus\nas a technical device based on the violation of this axiom. Kepler, on\nthe contrary, affirms the reality of changes in the velocities of the\nplanetary motions and provides a physical account for them. After\nstruggling strenuously with established ideas which were located not\nonly in the tradition before him but also in his own thinking, Kepler\nabandoned the circular path of planetary motion and in this way\ninitiated a more empirical approach to cosmology (though see\nBrackenridge 1982). \n\nKepler published the third law, the so-called “harmonic\nlaw”, for the first time in his Harmonice mundi (1619),\ni.e., ten years later. In his Epitome, he provided a more\nsystematic approach to all three laws, their grounds and implications\n(see Davis 2003; Stephenson 1987). In Book 5, chapter 3, as point 8 of\n13 (KGW 6, p. 302; Engl. trans., pp. 411–12), Kepler expresses, almost\naccidentally, his fundamental relationship connecting elapsed times\nwith distances, which in modern notation could be expressed\nas: with T1 and T2 representing\nthe periodic times of two planets and a1\nand a2 the length of their semi-major axes. A\nfurther formulation of this relationship, which is often found in the\nliterature, is: a3/T2\n= K, which expresses with K that the relationship\nbetween the third power of the distances and the square of the times\nis a constant (however, see Davis 2005, pp. 171–172; for the third\nplanetary law see especially Stephenson 1987). As a consequence of the\nthird law, the time a planet takes to travel around the Sun will\nsignificantly increase the farther away it is or the longer the radius\nof its orbit. Thus, for instance, Saturn's sidereal period is\nalmost 30 years, while Mercury needs fewer than 88 days to go around\nthe Sun. For the history of cosmology, it is important to make clear\nthat the third law fulfils Kepler's search for a systematic\nrepresentation and defense of the Copernican worldview, in which\nplanets are not absolutely independent of each other but integrated in\na harmonic world system. \n\nKepler contributed to the special field of optics with two seminal\nworks, the Ad Vitellionem paralipomena (=APO) and the\nDioptrice (=DI), the latter motivated in large part by the\npublication in 1610 of Galileo's Sidereal Messenger\n(Sidereus Nuncius). In his Conversation with the Sidereal\nMessenger (Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo … a\nGalillaeo Galilaeo, KGW 4, pp. 281–311), he supported the factual\ninformation given by Galileo, indicating at the same time the necessity\nof giving an account of the causes of the observed phenomena. The\nbackground for his investigation into optics was undoubtedly the\ndifferent particular questions of astronomical optics (see Straker\n1971). In this context he concentrated his efforts on an explanation of\nthe phenomena of eclipses, of the apparent size of the Moon and of\natmospheric refraction. Kepler investigated the theory of the\ncamera obscura very early and recorded its general principles\n(see commentary by M. Hammer in KGW 2, pp. 400–1 and Straker 1981). In\naddition, he worked intensively on the theory of the telescope and\ninvented the refracting astronomical or ‘Keplerian’\ntelescope, which involved a considerable improvement over the Galilean\ntelescope (see especially DI, Problem 86, KGW 4, pp. 387–88). Besides\nthese impressive contributions, Kepler expanded his research program to\nembrace mathematics as well as anatomy, discussing for instance conic\nsections and explaining the process of vision (see Crombie 1991 and\nespecially Lindberg 1976b). \n\nIn Chapter 1 of APO (“On the Nature of Light”), Kepler\nexpounds 38 propositions concerning different properties of light:\nlight flows in all directions from every point of a body's\nsurface; it has no matter, weight, or resistance. Following—but\nalso inverting—the Aristotelian argument for the temporality of\nmotion, he affirms that the motion of light takes place not in time but\nin an instant (in momento). Light is propagated by straight\nlines (rays), which are not light itself but its motion. It is\nimportant to note that although light travels from one body to another,\nit is not a body but a two-dimensional entity which tends to expand to\na curved surface. The two-dimensionality of light is probably the main\nreason why it is incorporeal. Motion in general plays a significant\nrole in Kepler's philosophy of light. For Straker, the supposed\nlink between optics and physics (especially in Prop. 20, where the\nmechanical analyses are introduced) “reveals the full extent of\nhis commitment to a mechanical physics of light” (Straker 1971,\np. 509). \n\nTwo questions are intensively discussed by modern specialists.\nFirstly, to what extent is the attribution of a mechanistic approach to\nKepler justified? Secondly, how should one determine his place in the\nhistory of sciences, especially in the field of optics: do the main\nlines of thought in Kepler's optics indicate a\ncontinuity or rather a rupture with tradition? There\nare well–grounded arguments for different positions on both\nquestions. For Crombie (1967, 1991) and Straker, Kepler develops a\nmechanical approach, which can be particularly appreciated in his\nexplanation of vision using the model of the camera\nobscura. Besides this, Straker stresses that Kepler's basic\nmechanicism is also powerfully assisted by his conception of light as\na non-active, passive entity. In addition, the concept of motion and\nthe explanations using the model of the balance are indicative of a\ncommitment to mechanicism (Straker 1970, pp.  502–3). On the\ncontrary, Lindberg (1976a), who supports the “continuity\nside” of the dispute, has quite convincingly showed that, for\nKepler, light has a constructive and active function in the universe,\nnot only in optics but also in astrology, astronomy, and natural\nphilosophy (for Kepler's criticism of the medieval tradition see also\nChen-Morris / Unguru, 2001). \n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, Kepler considered the HM to be\nhis main work and the one he most cherished. Containing his third\nplanetary law, this work represents definitively a seminal contribution\nto the history of astronomy. But he did not reduce his long prepared\nproject to an astronomical investigation—his first thoughts on\nthe notion of “harmony” arose already in 1599, although he\ndid not publish his work until 1619—but instead extensively\ndiscussed its mathematical foundations and its philosophical\nimplications, including astrology, natural philosophy and psychology.\nThus, Kepler's third planetary law appears in a context which\ngoes far beyond astronomy and to a great extent takes up again the\nperspective of his youthful MC. \n\nAccording to Kepler, it is necessary to distinguish\n“sensible” from “pure” harmony. The first is\nto be found among natural, sensible entities, like sounds in music or\nrays of light; both could be in proportion to one another and hence in\nharmony. He resolves this matter by combining three of the Aristotelian\ncategories: quantity, relation and, finally, quality. Through the\nfunction of the category of relation Kepler passes over to the active\nfunction of the mind (or soul). It turns out that two things can be\ncharacterized as harmonic if they can be compared according to the\ncategory of quantity. But the fact that at least two things are needed\nshows that the property of “being harmonic” is not a\nproperty of an isolated thing. Furthermore, the relationship between\nthe things cannot be found in the things themselves either; rather, it\nis produced by the mind: “in general every relation is nothing\nwithout mind apart from the things which it relates, because they do\nnot have the relation which they are said to have unless the presence\nof some mind is assumed, to relate one to another” (KGW 6, p.\n212; Engl. trans., p. 291). This process takes place through the\ncomparison of different sensible things with an archetype\n(archetypus) present in the mind. \n\nThe next central question directly concerns gnoseology, for Kepler\ngives a psychological account of the path followed by sensible things\ninto the mind. He resumes the scholastic species theory: immaterial\nspecies radiate from the sensible things and affect the sense organs\nby acting firstly on the “forecourts” and then on the\ninternal functions. They arrive at the imagination and from there go\nover to the sensus communis, so that, according to the\ntraditional teaching, the sensible information received is now able to\nbe processed and used in statements. From here onwards, the sensible\nthings are “preserved in the memory, brought forth by\nrecollection, [and] distinguished by the higher faculty of the\nsoul” (Caspar 1993, p. 269, cf. KGW 6, p. 214, lines 18–23;\nEngl.  trans., p. 293). While harmony arises as an activity of the\nsoul/mind consisting in relating quantitatively, Kepler adds, taking\nover the Aristotelian doctrine of categories, that harmony is a\n“qualitative relation” as well, involving the\n“quality of shape, being formed from the regular figures”,\nwhich provides the grounds for comparison (KGW 6, p. 216, lines 37–41;\nEngl. trans., p. 296). If this is how “things”, i.e.,\nsensible entities, find their way into the soul in order to be\ncompared, it by no means represents—as Kepler admitted—a\nsufficient explanation of how non-sensible things, i.e., mathematical\nentities, find their way into the mind. How do they come into the\nsoul?  Kepler accepted Aristotle's criticism of Pythagorean\nphilosophy concerning numbers: both Kepler and Aristotle are convinced\nthat numbers constitute ontologically a lower class within\nmathematical entities (for Kepler, they are derived from geometrical\nentities).  Nevertheless, Aristotle's philosophy is insufficient\nto grasp the essence of mathematics. By aligning himself with Proclus,\nfrom whom he quotes a long passage of his Commentary on\nEuclides, Kepler defends Plato's theory\nof anamnêsis against Aristotle's doctrine of\nthe tabula rasa. His discussion lies at the origin of the\nclassical debate between empiricism and rationalism which was to\ndominate the philosophical scene for generations to come. A connection\nwith idealism is, of course, apparent (see, for instance, Caspar 1993,\nEngl. trans., p. 269), and it is a fact that Kepler was positively\nreceived within German Idealism of the 19th\ncentury. Historically, however, it seems to be more accurate to link\nhis position with the philosophical tradition of St.  Augustine. \n\nBesides psychology and gnoseology, the other main spectrum of\nquestions Kepler deals with in Book 4 is his theory of\n“aspects”, i.e., astrology (HM, IV, Cap. 4–7), a further\nfield of application of his psychology and further evidence of the role\nof geometry in his philosophy. The “aspects”, i.e., the\nangles between the planets, Moon and Sun, are all he wishes to save\nfrom the old astrology, which he harshly criticizes; for the aspects\nare or can be reduced to geometrical structures, the archetypes, which\ncan be recognized by the soul. According to Kepler, there is no\n“mechanical influence” of the heavens (stars and\nconstellations are not relevant in his astrology) which exerts a\ndetermining effect on the Earth and on human life. Rather, both the\nEarth and human beings, ultimately, like all other living entities, are\nprovided with a soul in which the geometrical archetypes are present.\nBy the formation of an aspect in the heavens, symmetry arises and\nstimulates the soul of the Earth or of human beings. “The\nEarth,” Kepler writes, responds to “what the aspects\nwhistle” (KGW 11.2, p. 48; for his astrology see especially Field\n1984 and Rabin 1997, Boner 2005 and 2006).","contact.mail":"D.DiLiscia@lrz.uni-muenchen.de","contact.domain":"lrz.uni-muenchen.de"}]
