Despite its name, Navya-Nyāya\nincorporates and develops classical Vaiśeṣika metaphysics\nas well as classical Nyāya epistemology. The Navya-Nyāya\nauthors also develop a precise technical language through the\nemployment of which many traditional philosophical problems could be\nclarified and resolved.  Navya-Nyāya techniques proved to be so\nversatile that they were employed, not just by philosophers, but also\nin poetics, linguistics, legal theory, and other domains of medieval\nIndian thought. The foundational text of this school was\nGaṅgeśa’s brilliant and innovative Jewel of Reflection\non the Truth (Tattvacintāmaṇi). The school\ncontinued to develop for about four centuries, reaching its heights\nwith the works of Raghunātha, Jagadīśa and\nGadādhara (Ganeri 2014). The sophisticated use this school made\nof its technical vocabulary made it increasingly inaccessible, and so,\nin the 17th and 18th centuries, several manuals or compendia were\nwritten to explain in simplified language the basic tenets of the\nschool. I will describe the philosophical principles of\nNavya-Nyāya based on a synopsis of the most successful of these,\nAnnambhaṭṭa’s\nThe Manual of Reason (Tarkasaṃgraha;\nhenceforth TS), together with its auto-commentary, the\nDīpikā (henceforth TSD), This text was\nnicknamed Bāla-gādādharī, a sort\nof ‘Beginners Guide to Gadādhara’. As well as\npresenting the Vaiśeṣika theory of categories (a mixture\nof physical theory, metaphysics and philosophy of psychology), and the\nepistemological, methodological, and logical techniques of the new\nNyāya system, The Manual of Reason interjects\nfascinating discussions on a wide variety of topics of philosophical\ninterest, making the text an enjoyable and informative introduction to\nlater Indian analytical philosophy (trans. G. Bhattacharya 1983; for\ndiscussion of the text, see also Athalye 1930, Atreya 1948, C.\nBhattacharya 1966, Foucher 1949, Shastri 1961).\n\n\n\nMost Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika texts are structured in\none of two ways. They either follow a traditional\nVaiśeṣika pattern, in which the categories and their\nvarious sub-groups are discussed in order, or else they follow a\npattern employed by the Buddhist logician Diṅnāga, and\ncopied by Gaṅgeśa, in which each of the sources of\nknowledge is treated in turn. The Manual of Reason, however,\nadopts a style of analysis due to Vātsyāyana (the first\ncommentator on the Nyāya-sūtra).\nVātsyāyana stated that: \n\nThe heart of this method lies in the use it makes of definitions,\nconceived of as differentiating marks of the thing defined. The\nManual of Reason (TSD 3d) refines the idea: it defines a\n‘definition’ of a class of things as any characteristic\nwhich is co-extensive with that class. A defining characteristic of the\nclass ‘cow’ is the property ‘having dewlap’.\nNote that this does not tell us what the essence of the class\nis—it merely supplies us with a syndrome or trait by means\nof which we can identify the thing in question. The Naiyāyikas,\nwe might say, have a ‘diagnostic’, rather than an\n‘essentialist’, conception of definition. The purpose of\nthe ‘examination’ now becomes clear: it is to see whether\nthe alleged defining trait really is co-extensive with the class to be\ndefined, or whether it is faulty, either by ‘over-covering’\n(cf. ativyāpti; applying to things outside the\ndefiniendum) or by ‘under-covering’ (cf.\navyāpti; not applying to everything within the\ndefiniendum), or both. A properly defining characteristic has to be, to\nuse modern terms, both a necessary and a sufficient property of the\nthing to be defined. We see the pattern of enumeration, definition, and\nexamination repeated again and again in Navya-Nyāya texts like\nThe Manual of Reason. \n\nThe Vaiśeṣika system of ‘categories’\n(padārtha) is an attempt to classify in a systematic\nway all the different types of existent. Navya-Nyāya lists seven\n‘categories’ of object: substance (dravya),\nquality (guṇa), motion or action (karma),\nuniversal (sāmānya), particularity or\ndifferentiator (viśeṣa), inherence\n(samavāya), and absence (abhāva). Of\nthese, the first six comprise the classical list of categories, found\neven in the Vaiśeṣika-sūtra, while the\nseventh (absence) is a distinctive addition by the later school. Most\nof these types are themselves subject to sub-division: thus, there are\nnine types of substance, twenty four types of quality, etc. \n\nOne main question concerning this list of categories is whether we\ncan discern any underlying structure or organising principle. This is\nrelated with another important question: just what is a category?\nThe Manual of Reason answers this second question by giving\nthe etymological analysis of the term\n‘padārtha’ (category):\n‘padārtha’ is the artha or meaning\nof a pada or word. The claim is that the\nVaiśeṣika categories are in some way the metaphysical\ncorrelates of linguistic structures. One way to make this claim more\nprecise would be to note the existence of striking similarities between\nthe Vaiśeṣika system and Sanskrit grammar (cf. esp.\nFaddegon 1918). Another way is to observe a distinctive pattern of\nargument employed, in which the hypothesis that a certain type of\nsubstance, quality, etc. exists is supported on the ground that it\nexplains some feature of our linguistic practice (for example, the\nargument that space exists as it explains our use of directional\nterms.) \n\nAn alternative approach would be to seek some purely\napriori rationale behind the list. Athalye (1930: 75) offers\none such: \n\nThis reconstruction of the Vaiśeṣika system is not\nquite satisfactory, for it relies on an unexplained and perhaps\nquestion-begging distinction between stationary and evanescent\nproperties, and leaves two of the categories completely unaccounted\nfor. Another reconstruction (also deficient) is offered by Potter\n(1977). When we look at The Manual of Reason’s own\ndefinitions of the individual categories, it seems to be following this\napproach. The Manual of Reason’s definitions are\nas follows: \n\nThere are certain problems with this series of definitions, read as\nan apriori reconstruction of the categories. In particular,\nthe definitions of ‘substance’ and ‘quality’\nseem to be jointly circular, unless we take as already given universals\nsuch as substance-hood, which make the definitions somewhat vacuous. I\nwill give another reconstruction, one which roughly follows the great\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika author Udayana (cf. Tachikawa\n1981). \n\nFirst divide things up into the existents and the non-existents, the\nlatter corresponding to the category ‘absence’. Now take\ninherence to be a primitive, fundamental relation. Given such a\nrelation, the following three-fold division is exhaustive: \n\nWe want group (a) to correspond to the category\n‘substance’. Unfortunately, the Vaiśeṣikas\nclaim that wholes are distinct from, and inhere in, their parts. The\nonly substances which do not inhere in anything are the atomic\nsubstances (which for the Vaiśeṣikas correspond with the\neternal substances). Group (c) corresponds to the category\n‘universal’, for universals are said to inhere in things\n(substances, qualities and motions) but do not have anything inhering\nin them. Group (b) comprises, the non-atomic substances, the qualities\nand the motions. Let us now divide this group into two: those which are\ninhered in only by universals, and those which are inhered in by other\nthings as well. The former corresponds to the categories\n‘quality’ and ‘motion’, for substances are\ninhered in, not only by universals, but also by qualities, motions, as\nwell as by other substances. Finally, we must find a way to sub-divide\nthe former group into qualities and motions. More traditional\nNaiyāyikas preserve the distinction by saying that motions, but\nnot qualities, cause the substances in which they inhere to come into\ncontact with (or break away from) each other. This, however, appeals to\nthe idea of ‘contact’, which cannot itself be defined in\nterms of our primitive relation inherence. Some radical\nNaiyāyikas (especially Bhāsaravajña) claim that\nmotions are just a kind of quality, as their properties are so similar.\nThe only remaining category is ‘differentium’\n(viśeṣa), whose members reside in and\nindividuate the eternal substances i.e. the atoms. The point, perhaps,\nis that all other things are individuated by the universals and wholes\nthat inhere in them, but two atoms of the same substance are in all\nrespects identical. But if objects are individuated by means of\nwhat inheres in them, then there must be something inhering in each\natom which distinguishes it from the others—a\n‘differentium’ (see §10.2). \n\nThis is a rough sketch, omitting many technicalities, of how the\nVaiśeṣika philosophers tried to build their system of\ncategories on logical principles (for an example of such\ntechnicalities, see TSD 3(c). The Manual of Reason points out\nthat a substance cannot be defined as the substratum of qualities,\nbecause of the Vaiśeṣika doctrine that substances do not\npossess any qualities at the moment when they are created.) \n\nVaiśeṣika distinguishes, among nine acknowledged\ntypes of substance, a sub-class of five—earth, water, fire, air\nand ākāśa—to which it gives the name\n“bhūta” (‘physical substance’).\nA bhūta is defined as a substance which possesses a\nspecific sensible quality—odour, taste, colour, touch and sound. \n\nIt was, perhaps, originally thought that the five physical\nsubstances and the five sensible qualities are directly correlated,\neach quality residing in one and only one substance, odour just in\nearth, taste just in water etc. (such a view is reported by\nVātsyāyana under NS 3.1.65-6). This may give some insight\ninto the origins of the ‘five physical substances’ theory,\nbut it was realised very early on that it is extremely implausible to\nmaintain that earth, for example, is invisible, or else that its colour\nis always due to intermixture with fire (Bhaduri 1947: 133). The set of\ncorrelations between physical substances and sensible qualities is more\ncomplex in the Vaiśeṣika-sūtras and\nlater texts, and is indicated in the following chart: \n\nThe orthodox Vaiśeṣika view is that each physical\nsubstance is characterised by the possession of a particular type of\nsensible quality and the absence of certain others. Thus, earth is the\nsubstance endowed with odour, water with taste but not odour, fire with\ncolour but not taste or odour, etc. A drawback of such definitions is\nthat we cannot infer, from the detection of a sensible quality, which\ntype of substance is present. Later Vaiśeṣika\ntherefore looks for a diagnostic set of definitions, one which seeks to\nfind, for each substance, a particular sensible quality whose presence\nis indicative of that substance. The Manual of Reason (TS\n10–14): \n\nThus, although earth, water, and fire are all tactile, only\nwater allegedly has cold touch. It seems that it could find no positive\ndistinguishing trait for air, and thus reverted to the older style of\ndefinition. \n\nIt is perhaps surprising to find a ‘five elements’\ntheory defended still in the seventeenth century. Some modern writers\nhave tried to represent these substances as metaphors for different\n‘states’ of matter—solid (earth), liquid (water), gas\n(air), and temperature (fire). This is, however, improbable, for it is\nnowhere said that a particular substance can turn from earth to water\nto air. Perhaps it is a mistake to see the theory as belonging to\nphysics at all; instead, bearing in mind the way the substances are\ndefined in terms of their sensible qualities, we might see it as an\nexercise in the logical analysis of the data presented by the various\nsense modalities to construct a (metaphysical) theory of the world.\nSuch a theory would, for example, explain the fact that there are\ncorrelations between what we see and what we touch by positing that\nthere must be types of things which can be both seen and touched.\nLikewise, the occurrence of tactile sensations with no correlated\nvisual sensations leads us to postulate the existence of substances\nwhich can be felt but not seen (air), and so on for the other\nsubstances. It is, after all, the existence of such correlations\nbetween different sense modalities which grounds an objective\nconception of the world (phenomena accessible only by one sense are\nmore likely to be thought of as subjective in origin). \n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 10–14) repeats the\nconventional Vaiśeṣika theory that the first four\nsubstances (earth, water, air, fire) are each of two types, atomic and\ncomposite. An atom (paramāṇu) is indestructible\n(anitya), indivisible (i.e. non-composite), and has a special\nkind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu).\nThe Vaiśeṣikas’ standard argument for atomism is\nas follows. It is an empirically established truth that whatever is\nperceived is composite. Thus even the smallest perceptible thing,\nnamely, a fleck of dust in a sun-beam, has parts, which are therefore\ninvisible. The Vaiśeṣikas call the smallest perceptible\nthing a “triad” (tryaṇuka) and claim that\nit has three parts, each of which is called a “dyad”\n(dyaṇuka). Does each of these parts itself have parts?\nYes—for it is another empirically established truth that the parts of\na visible thing themselves have parts (e.g. a piece of cloth, whose\nparts, the threads, are themselves composite). The\nVaiśeṣikas say that a dyad has two parts, each of which\nis an atom. \n\nThis argument establishes that there are objects too small to be\nseen, but it does not demonstate that some of them are non-composite.\nWhy cannot the process of sub-division be continued ad infinitum?\nThe Manual of Reason’s intriguing answer is that if such\nwere the case then Mount Meru and a mustard seed would have the same\nsize, as each would have the same (infinite) number of constituent\nparts! An implicit premise here (articulated by other\nVaiśeṣikas) is that the size of a whole is a function of\nthe size, number and spatial arrangement of its parts. \n\nThe argument seems to be question-begging, for the implicit premise\nis only true if atomism is already accepted. A non-atomist will say\nthat the size of an object is determined, not by its constituents, but\nby the spatial boundaries of the ‘stuff’ it is made of. \n\nThe Navya-Nyāya account of number has been likened in content\nand sophistication to that of Frege, and is indeed fascinating. The\nManual of Reason says only that numbers are qualities\n(guṇa-s), that they are the ground for numerical\njudgements, and that they range from 1 to a very high number called\nparārdha (1014. Note here again discomfort with the\nidea of infinity). The view that numbers are qualities is in fact\nassociated with old Vaiśeṣika, and turned out to be\nirreconcilable with the structure of the Vaiśeṣika\nontological system. We may speak of there being three horses in the\nfield, but also of there being 24 qualities in the\nVaiśeṣika system. Yet a quality cannot by definition\nreside in another quality—hence numbers cannot be qualities. This\nproblem led the Navya-Naiyāyikas to develop a new account of\nnumbers, based on a new type of relation called the\nparyāpti or ‘completing’ relation. \n\nHere is a summary of their theory. Consider the following pair of\nsentences: \n\nThe similarity between (1) and (2) suggests that we think of\nnumber-words as akin to other adjectives, i.e. as attributing some\nproperty to the object/s they qualify. The Nyāya say that, in\n(1), the property of being wooden resides in the legs of the table by\nthe relation of inherence. Can we analyse (2) the same way, as stating\nthat a universal property four-hood inheres in the legs? The new\nNyāya (esp. Raghunātha and Jagadīśa) answer\nin the negative. For note that (1) entails \n\nHowever, (2) does not entail, \n\nThe solution offered is to postulate a new relation,\n‘completion’, which relates the property fourhood to the\nfour legs jointly, but not to each leg individually.\nRaghunātha remarks that “the ‘completion’\nrelation, whose existence is indicated by constructions such as\n“This is one pot” and “These are two”, is a\nspecial kind of self-linking relation.” His commentator\nJagadīśa adds: \n\nThe proposal is that number properties are related jointly to objects\nby the many-one relation ‘completion’. I think we can\nsimplify this proposal a little without losing its essential\nstructure. Rather than saying, in a sentence like “Mars is a\nplanet”, that the property planethood resides in Mars by the\ninherence relation, we would now say that the predicate\n“…is a planet” is true of Mars, so to speak\nbuilding the inherence relation (or copula) into the predicate. In an\nentirely analogous way, we can build the completion relation into the\nnumber-predicate, which then becomes, if the number is n,\nan n-place relation. Thus the sentence “Venus and Mars\nare two” asserts of Venus and Mars that they stand in a certain\n2-place relation, the relation which is the number 2. The Nyāya\nidea, then, is that number-adjectives are n-place relational\npredicates, and that numbers are n-place relations holding jointly\nbetween n distinct objects. It in no way follows from the statement\nthat the relation 2 holds between Venus and Mars, that it holds just\nwith Venus, any more than it follows from the statement\nthat X is to the left of Y, that X is to\nthe left, full stop. On the Nyāya proposal, then, it looks as\nthough the troublesome inference is blocked because its conclusion is\nnot even well-formed, since the phrase “Venus is two”,\nlike the phrase “X is to the left”, is an\nincomplete or unsaturated expression. \n\nThe Nyāya, we have seen, distinguish two relations, the\ninherence and completion relations. Their motive is, as we might now\nsay, to account for the distinction between collective and distributive\nproperties. For the recognition that the inference from “These\nare two pots” to “Each pot is two” is invalid is just\nthe recognition that the predicate two does not distribute over plural\nsubjects. The Nyāya idea is to analyse collective predicates\nlike ‘…are two’, not as one-place predicates of\naggregates or sets, but as n-place relational predicates, true of n\nobjects jointly. But since such relational predicates still take\nobjects as subjects, this indeed shows that recognising the distinction\nbetween distributive and collective predicates does not force us to\nabandon the adjectival view. The Nyāya, indeed, have a term for\ncollective properties: they call them\nvyāsajya-vṛtti-dharma or ‘properties\nwhich occur jointly’. \n\nThe Manual of Reason’s remarks on the nature of space\nand time are sketchy in the extreme. We must supplement them with\ndetails from other Vaiśeṣika and Nyāya authors.\nEven then, the theories of space and time found in\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika texts have been studied very\nlittle, and we can only form a rough and inadequate picture at the\npresent time. The Manual of Reason’s observations\nconcerning the notion of space are as follows: \n\nSpace is conceived of as that substance in virtue of which statements\nattributing distance and direction, such as “A is to\nthe east of B” (or “A is near\nto B”, “A is nearer to B than\nto C”, etc.)  are objectively true or false.  Space is\nthus an explanatory postulate: it is argued that we must postulate the\nexistence of a new (spatial) substance to explain the fact that\nobjects stand in spatial relations with one another. The problem is to\nmake sense of this claim. Bhaduri (1947: 216–7) does so as\nfollows (I paraphrase his account): \n\nThis explanation has a problem. It assumes that between any two bodies\nthere is a chain of touching material objects. But, given this\nassumption, we do not need to postulate a new substance with which\neverything is in contact, in order to create a transitive relation\nfrom contact. For we can define “being to the left of”\nthus: x is to the left of y iff there are distinct\nobjects p, q, r,…t such\nthat x is in contact with p, p is in\ncontact with q, …, t is in contact\nwith y. \n\nPotter (1977: 92) refines the argument. We say that A is\nnearer to D than to F because there are more\nintervening objects between A and F than there are\nbetween A and D. Suppose however that\nbetween D and F there is no chain of material\nobjects. How is it that we can still say “A is nearer\nto D than to F”? Potter answers: “In\norder to provide the material to explain this comparative judgement we\nmust postulate an intervening series of entities, and these must be\nspatial”. Note that this explains, not the transitivity of\ndirectional relations like “to the left of”, but rather\nthe magnitude of distance relations like “near\nto”. “Near to” is not a transitive relation. It\naccepts the basic premise that the distance between two objects is\nmeasured in terms of the number of intervening entities, and\npostulates a series of “spatial entities” when there are\nno material ones present.\n \n\nThis explanation also has a problem, for space is supposed to be a\nsingle entity. Perhaps it should say that the two objects are in\ncontact with a ‘segment’ of space, and spatial segments\nhave magnitude. \n\nPerhaps the best way to construe the argument is as offering an\nexplanation of spatial separation without having to postulate\na series of mediating bodies. Thus, if A is nearer\nto D than F, and there is nothing either\nbetween A and D or between A\nand F, the best explanation is that D is in contact\nwith a nearer part of space than F.\n \n\nThe Manual of Reason says that space is\n‘ubiquitous’ (vibhu), which it defines as\n‘being in contact with every sample of earth, air, fire, water\n(and ‘mind’) (TS14). This raises the question: is space\ninfinite in dimension, or the same size as the cosmos? If space is\ndefined in terms of the relations between physical objects, then it\nwould seem to have the same size as the cosmos. There are however\nVaiśeṣika arguments that it is infinite. The\nVaiśeṣikas say that most bodies are either\n‘long’ (dīrgha) or ‘short’\n(hrasva) in dimension (TS25, Bhaduri 1947: 118), but that a\nbody’s having ‘long’ or ‘short’ dimension\nis unintelligible unless it has bounding, perimeter parts. Space,\nhowever, has no parts and hence no boundary. Some\nVaiśeṣikas conclude that space has no finite dimension\n(i.e. is infinite); others that it has a special dimension called\n‘paramadīrgha’ or ‘maximal\nlength’. \n\nThe Manual of Reason says of time that it is the ground for\nstatements about the past, present and future, that it is unique,\neternal and ubiquitous, and that it is the container of everything and\na instrumental cause of every effect (TS15+D). The conception of time\nmirrors that of space: it is that in virtue of which statements of the\nform “A is earlier than B” are objectively true of false.\nTime is said to differ from space, and thus not be identical with it,\nin the following respect: whereas what is spatially near or far varies\nfrom person to person, what is temporally near or far is the same for\nall persons (cf. Bhaduri 1947, Mohanty 1992). But why should we\nrestrict our attention only to presently existing persons? \n\nIn the Nyāya-sūtra, Gautama mentions an\nargument against the possibility of present time remarkably similar to\n(and perhaps even derived from) Nāgārjuna’s\narguments against motion. NS 2.1.39 (paraphrased): There is no such\nthing as the present time, because, when an object is falling to the\nground, each point on its descent belongs either to the\nalready-traversed sector or to the yet-to-be-traversed sector. There is\ntherefore, no point on the trajectory to which the present time can be\nattributed. The present time is an imaginary point of demarcation\nbetween the past and the future. Gautama replies (NS 2.1.40-42) to this\nby saying (i) that the concepts of ‘past’ and\n‘future’ are relative to that of the ‘present’,\nand not to each other, and (ii) that the denial of the present has an\nabsurd consequence, that nothing can be known perceptually, as\nperception functions in the present. The point of (i), perhaps, is that\neven if the present is just a boundary, it is not thereby\nimaginary. \n\nBeginning with Praśastapāda (6th century\nC.E.), the early Vaiśeṣika authors took a rational and\nscientific interest in the behaviour of projectiles and other moving\nbodies. Their theory bears comparison with Philoponus’\n“impetus” theory, which was responsible for a paradigm\nshift in Western scientific thought. The Manual’s\naccount substantially agrees with that already found in\nPraśastapāda, which is partially traceable to the\nVaiseṣika-sūtra itself. The content of the\nrelevant stanzas can be summarized as follows: \n\nMotion is the non-inherent cause of conjunction and disjunction. It\nis of five types, four volitional (throwing upwards, throwing\ndownwards, contraction, expansion) and the fifth comprising all\nnon-volitional motion (including falling, rotating, flowing, etc.) (TS\n5, 81). \n\nWeight (gurutva) is the non-inherent cause of the initial\nfalling motion of a body (TS 30). \n\nFluidity (dravatya) is the non-inherent cause of (initial?)\nflowing (TS 31). \n\n‘Impetus’ (vega) is a dispositional\nproperty (saṃskāra), as is\n‘elasticity’ (sthitisthāpaka) (TS\n80). ‘Impetus’ is the non-inherent cause of the\nsecond and subsequent falling motions of a body (TS 30). Elasticity is\nthat which restores something to its original state after it has been\ndistorted. \n\nHere is a brief summary of the theory. A moving body possesses, at\neach moment in time, a particular ‘motion’, which is to be\nthought of as a momentary, quality-like property of the body. Motions\nare defined to be the cause of conjunctions or disjunctions. A\nconjunction with a (stationary) body is brought about by displacement\nin space. We are thus to think of the motion of a body as being either\nidentical with, or else the cause of, its displacement in space between\ntwo moments in time. A motion cannot be caused by another motion (as\nthat would lead to perpetual motion). A body is set in motion by its\npossession of a quality like ‘weight’ or\n‘fluidity’. It persists in motion by having a dispositional\nproperty, ‘impetus’ or ‘elasticity’, which is\nthe continuous cause of subsequent motions. It is brought to rest by\ncoming into contact with other objects. \n\nThe role of ‘impetus’ in this account is particularly\ninteresting. It is illustrated with reference to two examples: (i) a\nfruit falling from a tree; (ii) a javelin thrown obliquely upwards.\n \n\nThe Vaiśeṣikas extend this model to explain certain\nother kinds of motion. (1) The initial cause of the flowing of water is\nalleged to result from a force called ‘fluidity’ (rather\nthan the weight of the water). The subsequent flowing is the result of\nthe water’s acquired impetus. (2) Interestingly, the impetus of a\nbody moving in a straight line was thought to be ontologically of the\nsame type as the elasticity of a bent stick—a fact which reveals that\nimpetus was thought of as a kind of internal force, not as inertia. (3)\nThe Vaiśeṣikas mention various other kinds of motion:\nthe movement of an iron needle towards a magnet, the upward motion of\nflames, the movement of air, and the initial motion of the atoms at the\nbeginning of creation. Given the above model, there must be some\n‘force’ which initially gives rise to each of these\nmotions, yet none of the ‘forces’ so far isolated\n(weight/gravity, fluidity, elasticity) will do. The\nVaiśeṣikas therefore speak of a new force,\n‘adṛṣṭa’ (the\n‘unseen’ force), alleged to account for such motions. \n\nThe eighth of the nine Vaiśeṣika types of substance\nis ‘self’ (ātman), defined as the\nsubstratum of mental states such as believing, knowing, etc. (The ninth\nis ‘mind’ (manas), a distinct element in the\nontology of the mental.) Selves are divided into two types—human\n(jīva) and divine (paramātman;\nīśvara). The Manual of Reason supplies\narguments (all traceable back to earlier authors) for the existence of\nboth types of self. \n\nA properly formulated Nyāya argument has three components:\nthesis, reason (hetu) and example\n(dṛṣṭānta). The thesis, again, has two\ncomponents: the ‘locus’ (pakṣa) or place of\nthe inference, and a property (sādhya) whose presence in\nthe locus is to be inferred. Thus every Nyāya argument exhibits\nthe same pattern: p has S, because it\nhas H; e.g., d.  (For example: “The mountain (\n= p) has fire (= S), because it has smoke (\n= H); e.g. the kitchen ( = d). See further\n§8). A sound argument must fulfil at least three criteria: (i)\nthe reason property must be uncontroversially present in the locus;\n(ii) the reason property and the inferred property must be\nappropriately related, roughly such that wherever the reason is\npresent, so is the inferred property; (iii) the example must be an\nuncontroversial place where both the reason property and the inferred\nproperty are present. \n\nWith this in mind, let us consider The Manual of\nReason’s argument for the existence of God: \n\nHere, the locus of the inference is a dyad, the smallest composite\nentity. The reason is “being an effect”\n(kāryatva), and the inferred property is “having\na maker” (kartṛ-janyatva). The Manual of\nReason carefully defines what it means by a ‘maker’: a\nthing which is non-inferentially aware of the inherent or material\ncause of the thing to be made, has a desire to make it, and acts\naccordingly. In this sense, the potter, but not the potter’s\nwheel or the clay or any other causally relevant feature, is the maker\nof the pot, for it is the potter who sees the clay (= material cause of\nthe pot), desires to make a pot, and acts accordingly by using the\nwheel and stick. \n\nComments: (1) Why does The Manual of Reason take dyads to\nbe the locus of the inference? This is, in fact, a clever move.\nObviously, we cannot take God to be the locus (e.g. God exists,\nbecause…), for then the first criterion on a sound inference\nwill not be met—the reason property, whatever it is, cannot be\nuncontroversially present in a locus whose very existence is\ncontroversial. We can’t take the locus to be “everything in\nthe world”, for many such things are not effects (e.g. atoms,\nspace) and so The Manual of Reason’s desired reason will\nagain not be unequivocally present in the locus. Hence, we must pick\nsome particular thing. We had better not choose a human artefact, for\nthe inference, even if sound, would then establish nothing about God.\nFrom the class of non-artefacts, the choice of dyads is a good one\nhere, for (a) they are the most basic things made out of the atoms, and\nhence out of which everything else is made, and (b) if The Manual\nof Reason can show that these have a maker, then it follows that\nthe maker is aware of everything (from the definition of a maker and\n(a) above). Thus, God’s omniscience will be a corollary of the\nproof of his existence. \n\n(2) The argument takes the picture of causation used in the\n“potter-pot” example and extends it to cover all natural\nphenomena. God’s function is to make things out of the given and\nuncreated ingredients (the atoms, cf. the clay), which are the\nproducts’ material cause. Matilal accordingly describes the\nNyāya as having a “potter model” of God, in contrast\nwith a “spider model”, in which God spins the world out of\nhis own essence, or a “magician” model, in which the world\nis an illusion conjured up by God. The argument, however, rests upon an\nanthropomorphic and agentive view of causation. The Buddhist\nDharmakīrti ridiculed the argument by likening the pot to an\nanti-hill (another thing made of clay): should we say that this\nadmittedly complex and intricate construction is the product of\nintelligent agents? And even if we do, why should not the world, like\nan ant-hill be a product of collective agency, rather than produced by\na single agent? \n\n(3) The argument might be thought of as an argument based on\ninduction, induction from the class of artefacts to the class of\nnatural products. What licenses the induction from things seen to have\na maker to things not so seen? Dharmakīrti (cf. Vattanky 1984:\n56-8) says that we are licensed to infer that an object has a maker\nonly if we have seen other objects of the same type being made. Thus,\nwe can infer that the Pyramids had a maker, not because we can see that\nmaker, but because the Pyramids belong to a type (buildings) other\ninstances of which we have seen made. The Naiyāyika makes a\nbolder inductive claim, that two object belong to the same\n‘type’, in this sense, if they are both effects. \n\nVaiśeṣika defines the human self as the substratum of such\npsychological qualities as believing, etc., as well as of happiness\nand other emotions, which God does not have. There is an implicit\nappeal, here too, to the “potter” model of causation: just\nas, in the sentence “The potter makes the pot”, the\nproperty “….making the pot” resides in the potter,\nso too in “I believe that p”, the property\n“….believes that p” resides in me. Given\nthat the self is defined as that substance, whichever it is, in which\na person’s psychological qualities reside, the question is\nwhether we can identify this substance as a physical one, for example,\nthe person’s body or their senses, or whether we must postulate\nsome new type of substance. Vaiśeṣika’s argument for\nthe existence of the self as a new substance is by elimination of two\nrival candidates. \n\n(1) The substratum of beliefs, etc. is the person’s body.\nThe Manual of Reason makes the case for this as follows: If I\nsay, “I am cold”, “I am running”, it is my\nbody to which the predicate applies. Therefore, when I say “I\nbelieve that p”, the subject likewise is my\nbody. The Manual’s reply is that if this were true,\nthen \n\nClearly, I can lose part of my body without ceasing to believe and\nknow things. But losing part of my body does not entail losing my body,\nas a whole. So this argument fails. A better argument is found in the\nNyāya-sūtra: the very phrase “my\nbody” shows that I am not identical with my body. But this\ndoesn’t work either, for I can also say “my soul”!\nThere is no clear argument against physicalism here. \n\n(2) The substratum of beliefs etc. is the person’s\nsense-faculties [recall that every physical substance was divided into\nthree: pertaining to body, sense-faculty, and (inanimate) object]. This\nrather strange claim might be taken to include the view of the\nBuddhists, that a person is reducible to a stream of momentary mental\nevents, including sense-data etc. The Manual of Reason’s\nargument against such a view (a repetition of an argument already found\nin the Nyāya-sutra) is a strong one: \n\nThe idea here is that the possibility of recognitive experience\npresupposes the existence of a unitary enduring self. There are really\ntwo arguments compressed here. One is this: I cannot remember\nan object unless I have seen it earlier—I cannot remember what you\nhave seen (cf. Locke’s account of personal identity in terms of a\ncontinuity of memory experiences). The other argument is more\nintricate. The Abhidharma Buddhist claims that a person is just an\naggregate of experiences, some visual, some tactile, etc. The problem\nraised for such an account by the Naiyāyika is that it is\npossible to make trans-modality judgements, in which the deliverances\nof one sense-faculty are compared with another. Suppose that\nV(o1) is a visual experience of an object\no1, and T(o2) is a\ntactile experience of an object o2. It is possible\nto judge “o1\n= o2”, but this judgement does not belong to\nthe sphere of any one sense-faculty.  Hence, it must be located in\nsome other substance. The self is here conceived of as that which\ncollates, organises and compares the deliverances of the individual\nsenses. See Ganeri 2012, chapters 11, 15, 16 for an expanded discussion. \n\nThis is a convenient place at which to introduce the last of the\nnine substances, the ‘mind’ (manas). It is defined\nby The Manual of Reason (TS18) as a sixth sense-faculty, one\nby which a person ‘perceives’ their inner mental objects\n(beliefs, pleasure sensations etc.) In other words, it is a faculty of\nintrospection. Naturally, we need an argument why this faculty cannot\nbe identified as belonging to the self, and the usual Nyāya\nclaim is that the self is the agent of cognising, while the mind is an\ninstrument for cognising, just as we must distinguish between the\naxe-man, who is the agent chopping the tree, and the axe, which is the\ninstrument for chopping. The Nyāya also claim that the mind has\nanother function, which is to ‘switch’ between the\ndifferent sense-faculties, it being assumed that, while we are being\nsubjected to sense-impressions from different faculties simultaneously,\nwe only attend to one at a time. \n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 79) says that eight of the\nVaiśeṣika qualities reside only in the self, and in no\nother substance. They are cognition, memory, pleasure or happiness\n(sukha), pain or unhappiness (duḥkha), desire\n(icchā), aversion (dveṣa), merit\n(dharma) and demerit (adharma) (TS 73-78). The first\ntwo we will discuss later (§§ 5.2-3). As regards happiness\nand unhappiness, Matilal (1986: 301), summarizes the\nVaiśeṣika view when he says that “the essential\ncharacteristic of pleasure or happiness consists in its being\nexperienced as favourable to us or being in accord with us, i.e. with\nour body or mind or our very existential situation\n(anukūla)”, which makes it distinct from knowing\nor perceiving or apprehending something, and that it is an\n“inner disposition on account of which the external world\nbecomes agreeable or desirable”. Desire is the state of craving\nfor something. Merit is that which is produces by meritorious action\n(karma). See further Ganeri 2012, chapters 13, 14. \n\nStudy of the nature, content and causes of cognition (buddhi,\njñāna, upalabdhi) lies at the very centre of the\nNyāya philosophical method. In epistemology, the question asked\nis: how do we distinguish between true and false cognitions, and under\nwhat conditions does a true cognition arise? In logical theory, the\nissue is: when does one cognition ‘follow’ from another, in\nsome suitably articulated sense. In philosophy of language, the\nassumption is that sentence structure mirrors cognitive structure, and\nhence that an inquiry into sentence meaning proceeds via an analysis of\nthe cognitions sentences ‘express’. The importance of this\ntopic is reflected by The Manual of Reason, for although\n‘cognition’ is technically just one of twenty-four types of\nquality in the Vaiśeṣika schema, its analysis accounts\nfor nearly half of the book (TS 34–74). \n\nThe term ‘cognition’ is used by the Naiyāyikas to\nrefer to any intentional (sa-viṣayaka;\nobject-directed) mental state, including states of perceiving,\ninferring, doubting, guessing, remembering, etc., but excluding\ndesiring, hoping, suffering, etc. (cf. Matilal 1968: 7–8).\nBecause we say that the subject has such states, they are thought to be\n‘qualities’ (in the technical Vaiśeṣika\nsense) of the soul. The Manual of Reason states that a\ncognition is the “ground for all linguistic practice” (TS\n34), reflecting the Nyāya conception of language as primarily an\ninstrument for transmitting true thoughts from speaker to hearer. \n\nFrom the point of view of epistemology, the most important division,\nwithin the class of cognitions, is between those which are true and the\nrest. However, the standard Nyāya classification of the species\nof cognition, repeated by The Manual of Reason, begins with\nanother division, between memory cognitions (smṛti)\nand the remainder (anubhava; nonrecollective cognition). The\nfull classification is as follows: \n\nNyāya epistemology is in effect a theory of the true\nnonrecollective cognitions, and their division into four types on the\nbasis of the different accredited epistemic means\n(pramāṇa-s) by which they are produced. (What\nabout accidentally true cognitions, e.g. the result of a lucky guess?\nThere are well-discussed problems with incorporating them into the\nabove schema). It is clear that, no matter how generally reliable are\nour epistemic methods, it will always be possible for misfires to issue\noccasionally in false cognitions (e.g. perceptual illusions, beliefs\nresulting from a reporting error, etc.). The Manual of\nReason’s example (TS 72) is of the false pseudo-perceptual\njudgement “This is a piece of silver” on seeing an\noyster-shell. I will discuss the epistemology of perception, inference\nand testimony in §§ 7, 8 and 9 respectively. Here, I will\nexamine in more detail three types of cognition which, though very\nimportant within the Nyāya framework, are subsidiary to its\nepistemology. They are: memory, ‘doubt’ and tarka.\n(Where do dreams fit in the schema? TS 70 states that they belong in\nthe category of ‘false’ cognitions. This, however, is odd,\nsince they are not the product of any of the four\npramāṇas misfiring. Neither are they memories\nor states of doubt. According to Praśastapāda, dreams are\nthe result of the free movement of the ‘mind’ when it is\nnot connected with the external sense-faculties, influenced by\nadṛṣṭa, ‘unseen’\nforces.) \n\nMemory is considered in the western tradition to be an important\nmeans by which an individual can justify her beliefs about the past. It\nis striking then to note that the Nyāya at the outset separate\nmemory states from knowledge-yielding beliefs and deny to them the\nstatus of knowledge-hood. The Manual of Reason has the\nfollowing to say about memory: \n\nA memory state is one which results solely from a ‘mental\ndisposition’ (bhāvanā) (TS 35). \n\nA ‘mental disposition’ is a quality of the soul which is\ncaused by a nonrecollective cognition and causes a memory cognition (TS\n80). \n\nMemories are either ‘true’ or ‘false’, as\nthe originating cognition is true or false (TS 74). \n\nThe general theory is that an initial cognition, e.g. a perceptual\nexperience of an object, generates a dispositional mental state, which\nhas the capacity, when certain other causal factors are present, to\ntrigger an active memory of that object. (The whole process might be\nlikened to that of someone who, having learned to swim, has a\ndispositional capacity to swim, which they exercise on certain\noccasions.) The resultant memory state has the same content as the\noriginating perceptual experience, and can be said derivatively to be\n‘true’ or ‘false’, depending on whether the\noriginal perception was veridical or not. Memory, on this account is\nrepresented as an entirely infallible faculty: there is no mention of\nthe possibility of what is called “false memory”, i.e.\nhaving memories without any originating experience, or of “faulty\nmemory”, in which the content of the memory does not exactly\nmatch that of the originating experience. \n\nGiven this account, in which memory is seen merely as reproducing a\npast knowing experience, there is perhaps a sense in which the memory\ndoes not itself count as knowledge, any more than an exact reproduction\nof a Picasso counts as a Picasso. The Naiyāyikas state that\nmemories lack ‘independence’. The idea, perhaps, is this.\nIn general we establish the veracity of an experience by examining the\nway in which it was caused (my perception of the table is veridical,\nbecause my eyesight is good, the lighting is adequate, etc.). In the\ncase of a memory, however, we must go via the originating experience.\nMemory is conceived of as a mere surrogate for the original experience,\nand its veracity is ‘dependent’ on that of the original. We\nmight think, however, that memory in fact does more than merely\nreproduce the original experience. It may represent the experienced\nevent as happening in the past, and thus have a different content. \n\nThe concept of doubt has an important theoretical role in Nyāya,\nfor a state of doubt is claimed to be a necessary precondition for any\nphilosophical enquiry. Doubt is one of the sixteen topics listed\nunder Nyāya-sūtra 1.1.1, which determine the\ncontent of the entire text. In particular, a doubt is the first step\nin a properly formulated inference: is there a fire on the\nmountain?—Yes, because there is smoke there. The Manual of\nReason gives a very precise definition of a doubt (TS 71): a\ncognition of two incompatible qualifiers in the same qualificand, for\nexample the cognition “Is this (dimly perceived or distant\nobject) a person or a tree-stump?” Schematically, then, a doubt\nis a cognition whose content is of the form “x\nis F or not-F?”. \n\nTwo points are worth noting. (i) Although doubts are classified as\nnon-true (apramā) cognitions, they are not false. A\nfalse cognition is one whose content is “x\nis F” when in fact x is not F. (ii)\nDoubts are distinguished from other cognitions by virtue of having a\nspecial type of content, rather than by being propositional attitudes\nof a special kind. The Nyāya do not here say that we can take one\nof a series of attitudes towards the same proposition, believing,\ndisbelieving, doubting, etc. Yet if the only thing which distinguishes\na doubt is its having a content of the form specified in TS 71, then\nwhat differentiates the doubt that x is F from the\nbelief that x is both F and not-F?\nVardhamāna replies by drawing a distinction between actually\nhaving a contradictory belief and merely believing that one has a\ncontradictory belief. The former is supposedly impossible, the\nsupposedly contradictory belief that x is both F and\nnot-F is really a belief that I have a belief whose\nqualificand is x and whose qualifiers are F and\nnot-F. Since there are no genuine contradictory beliefs,\nthere are no beliefs with the same content as doubts. \n\nThe term ‘tarka’ is often used loosely in the\nsense of hypothetical or reductio-ad-absurdum reasoning, but The\nManual of Reason gives it a much more precise and technical\nsense: \n\nThe terms in this definition require explanation. The technical\nsense of ‘ascription’ (āropa) is\n‘counterfactual or suppositional cognition’\n(āhāryāropa), defined as a cognition\nwhose qualifier is an property the opposite of which is known to reside\nin the qualificand. In other words, it is a counterfactual assumption.\n‘Pervader’ and ‘pervaded’ are notions taken\nfrom the Nyāya theory of inference. When we say that wherever\nthere is smoke, there is fire, this can be re-expressed as that fire\npervades smoke, i.e. that the property of being a\nsmoke-possessing-thing has a narrower extension than the property of\nbeing a fire-possessing-thing. So here, fire is the pervader and smoke\nis the pervaded. Thus, tarka consists in a cognition of\nsmoke’s absence given the counterfactual assumption that\nfire is absent. It is the cognition of a conditional “if p then\nq”, or “were p to be true\nthen q would be true”, assuming that\n‘p’ is false. \n\nOne main function of tarka is said to be the elimination of\ndoubt. Suppose one has the doubt\n“Is x F?”. One might then judge\n“if x is not F then x is\nnot G”, and if one also knows that x\nis G, it will follow that x is F. The\nNaiyāyikas recognise this function but deny nevertheless\nthat tarka is a source of knowledge\n(pramāṇa). Their reason, it seems, is that there\nis a distinction between citing positive empirical evidence for a\nthesis and merely eliminating the contrary possibility by a priori\nmethods. This is reflected, perhaps, in the fact that no example is\ncited in arguments based on tarka to buttress the\ninference. The Manual of Reason, it seems, goes even further\nand denies that the counterfactual conditional is a true cognition,\nwhich implies, since they are not false either, that counterfactual\nconditionals do not have a truth-value. \n\nUdayana claims that tarka is of five types, namely\n‘self-dependence’\n(ātmāśraya), ‘mutual\ndependence’ (anyonyāśraya),\n‘circle’ (cakraka), ‘infinite regress’\n(anavasthā), and ‘having an undesirable\nconsequence’ or reductio-ad-absurdum\n(aniṣṭāprasaṅga). These are\nbasically self-explanatory – the fifth,\n‘prasaṅga’ is the one used to great effect\nby Nāgārjuna and other Mādhyamika Buddhists. Other\nauthors give slightly different lists (see S. Bagchi 1953 for\ndetails). \n\nThe study of causation is an important part of Indian philosophical\nthought. One reason for this is the early interest in cosmological\nspeculation: “We should remember that philosophic activity in\nIndia arose out of the cosmogonic speculations of the Vedas and the\nUpaniṣads. The all-important business of philosophy was to\nattempt to discover some simple, unitary cause for the origin of this\ncomplex universe” (Matilal 1985: 287). Another reason is that\nIndian linguistics (especially the Pāṇinian system of\n‘kārakas’ or relations between verb and\nnoun, which greatly influenced Nyāya,\nMīmāṃsā and Buddhist thinkers) is based on\nan underlying causal model, in which the verb in a sentence designates\nan event, for the production of which each such object as is designated\nby a noun has a particular causal role. This same model informed and\ninfluenced Indian epistemology, and led to the development of the\ntheory of ‘pramāṇas’, the causal\nmeans or processes leading to an epistemically accredited\nawareness-event (pramā). In the Nyāya tradition,\nfour such pramāṇas are recognised: perception\n(pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna),\n‘analogical identification’ or ‘comparison’\n(upamāna) and testimony (śabda). The\naccounts given of each of these employ an extremely causalistic idiom,\ntypical questions being ‘what causes a perceptual\nexperience?’, ‘what are the distinguishing causal factors\nof true and false perceptual experiences?’, ‘under what\nconditions does knowledge of the premises of an argument cause\nknowledge of the conclusion?’, etc. \n\nThe choice of examples undoubtedly influences one’s causal\ntheory. The Naiyāyikas almost invariably illustrate their\ndiscussions with one of the following three examples: (i) The\npotter-pot example. The effect is the finished pot. Some of its\ncauses are the pot-halves (which the potter joins to form the pot), the\npotter, his wheel and stick, the contact between each of the\npot-halves, and between them and the stick, etc. (ii) The\nthread-cloth example. Here the effect is the piece of cloth. Among\nits causes are the threads from which it is woven, the weaver, the\nshuttle, the loom, various contacts, etc. (iii) The axe-tree\nexample. The effect, i.e. the felling of the tree, is caused by\nthe axe, its contact with the tree, the axeman, etc. Some of the\nquestions we would like to ask here are these. Can all instances of\ncausation be fitted into the general pattern illustrated by these\nexamples (e.g. is there always an ‘agent’)? Do the\nNaiyāyikas have an adequate account of causation even for these\nexamples (i.e. can they distinguish between those factors which are,\nand those factors which are not, causes of the effect)? Can both\nobjects and events be causes? Are causal relations singular or based on\nrepeatable regularities? Attempts to answer such questions as these led\nto increasingly sophisticated accounts of causation as the Nyāya\nschool evolved. \n\nThe Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas traditionally held that,\nwithin the total collection (sāmagrī) of causal\nfactors leading to an event, there are three distinguishable types of\ncause, namely ‘substrate’ or ‘inherence’ causes\n(samavayi-kāraṇa), ‘non-substrate’\nor ‘non-inherence’ causes\n(a-samavayi-kāraṇa), and\n‘instrumental’ causes\n(nimitta-kāraṇa). This classification is\nrepeated by The Manual of Reason (TS 43). A substrate cause is\na substance in which the effect inheres. The substrate cause of a pot\nwould be the pot-halves; of a cloth, the threads. This is because the\nNyāya say that a whole inheres in its parts, and, so, if the\neffect (e.g. the pot) is a whole, its substrate causes are the parts in\nwhich it inheres. If the effect is an object’s coming to have a\nnew property (e.g. the tree’s being felled), the substrate cause\nis the object (the tree). Note that, in spite of a certain similarity,\nthe notion of a substrate cause is not the same as Aristotle’s\n“material” cause, for (i) the parts of an object are not\nnecessarily identical with the material from which it is composed, and\n(ii) even an immaterial substance can be a substrate cause, for example\nthe soul, which is the substrate cause of epistemic events. \n\nAll other causal factors are either ‘non-substrate’\ncauses or ‘instrumental’ causes. A non-substrate cause is\none which inheres in the substrate cause. Thus, though not being the\nsubstrate, it is closely connected with it. The conjunction of threads\nis said to be a non-substrate cause of a piece of cloth. Another\nexample is often cited. The non-substrate cause of the colour of a\npiece of cloth is the colour of the threads (which colour inheres in\nthe threads, in which inheres the effect, the colour of the cloth). Any\nother causal factor is called an instrumental cause, for example, the\nweaver’s shuttle or the weaver herself. Why did the\nNaiyāyikas distinguish between non-substrate causes and the\nremainder? Perhaps it was an attempt to differentiate between those\ncauses which must continue to exist for the effect to exist, and those\nwhich need not. If the threads were to lose their colour, then the\ncloth would lose its, and if the threads were to become disjoint, the\ncloth would cease to exist altogether. If, however, the weaver dies,\nhaving already woven the cloth, or if the shuttle is subsequently\ndestroyed, it will not affect the continued existence of the\neffect. \n\nIt does not follow from these definitions that anything which\ninheres in the substrate is a non-substrate cause, or that anything\nwhich does not is an instrumental cause. In other words, we still need\nto define “being a cause”. First, however, two more types\nof causal factor are distinguished by the Nyāya. These are the\n‘special’ instrumental cause (karaṇa) and\nthe ‘operating condition’ (vyāpāra)\nWe often speak of the cause of an effect, and\nin doing so pick out one factor from the total collection of causal\nfactors as being particularly salient or important in bringing about\nthe effect. Intuitively, the idea is that, even if we have the\nsubstrate cause (the pot-halves), the non-substrate cause (the contact\nbetween the halves), and even some of the instrumental causes (the\npotter, etc.), we will not get the effect (the pot) unless the potter\nacts or ‘operates’ to bring it about. In a sense, then, it\nis the potter’s actually using his stick which is the\ncause of the pot. The Naiyāyikas try to capture this idea by\nsaying that one of the instrumental causes is the ‘special’\n(asādhāraṇa) cause of the effect, and\nthey call it the ‘karaṇa’. This notion is\nparticularly important to the Nyāya epistemology (see below).\nWhat constitutes the ‘special’ nature of this cause? The\nNavya-nyāya (cf. TS 54) answer is as follows. They introduce\nfirst the notion of an ‘operative condition’\n(vyāpāra), defined as that cause which\nimmediately precedes the effect. For example, the operative condition\nfor a pot is the conjunction of the pot-halves; for the felling of a\ntree, it is the final contact between axe and tree before the tree\nfalls. The ‘special’ cause is defined as that factor which\n‘brings about’ this operative condition. In other words, it\nis the factor whose operation directly brings about the effect. In the\nexamples, it would be the axe or the potter’s stick. These\nobjects are, for the Nyāya, the true instruments by means of\nwhich the effect is produced. \n\nThe Naiyāyikas build up in this way a model of causation, in\nwhich different causal factors have different types of causal role. The\nmodel reflects (or is reflected in) the Indian grammatical analysis of\ncausal statements, such as “The potter throws a pot with her\nstick”, “The lumberjack fells a tree with her axe”,\nin which one distinguishes, apart from the verb designating the event,\nan agent (kartṛ), object (karman), instrument\n(karaṇa), and so on. We do not yet know, however, how\nto distinguish between causes and non-causes. The Manual of\nReason (TS 41) provides the Navya-Nyāya answer. Given two\nentities, c and e, \n\nThe first clause is to prevent self-causation. The import of the\nsecond condition is that entities similar to c must always\nexist with entities similar to e. There must be an invariable\nor constant conjunction between c-type entities\nand e-type entities. This rules out objects which just happen\nto be there, such as, to give the Naiyāyikas’ example, a\ndonkey happening to wander past the pottery just as the potter goes to\nwork. This feature of the account, the insistence that a causal\nrelation instantiates a regularity, resembles a Humean account of\ncausation. The Naiyāyika, however, recognised the possibility of\n‘accidental’, non-causal regularities, such as day always\npreceding night, or (the example given by The Manual of\nReason), the colour of the thread always preceding the\ncloth. Although the occurrence of a cloth is invariably preceded, not\njust by threads, but by the presence of thread-colour as well, we\nwould not want to say that thread-colour is a cause of cloth.  The\nthird clause is their attempt to eliminate such accidental\nregularities. The same clause is supposed to stop the cause of a cause\n(e.g. the potter’s parents) from being a cause. Its meaning,\nhowever, is not quite clear. Literally, it states that a cause must be\n‘not established otherwise’. Kalidas Bhattacharya says\nthat “an invariable antecedent is irrelevant if knowledge of it\nis not required for any anticipative knowledge of the origination of\nthe effect” (see Potter 1977: 67). Matilal says that an\nantecedent is irrelevant if “it is possible to find a reasonable\nexplanation of its appearance” (1985: 290). The Manual of\nReason states that an antecedent is irrelevant if its antecedence\nis only established along with some other entity. We know that\nthread-colour precedes cloth only because we know that it occurs with\nthe thread (which we know to precede cloth); hence the thread-colour\nis irrelevant in this sense.  This highlights an asymmetry between the\ntwo regularities, the threadcolour-cloth regularity and the\nthread-cloth regularity. For while we can establish the latter\ndirectly by observing correlations between thread and cloth, we\nestablish the former by observing the correlation between threadcolour\nand thread. Thus the former supposedly depends on the latter but not\nvice versa. It is not clear, however, that the dependence does not run\nthe other way too. In any case, in using this criterion to block\ntransitivity, the Naiyāyikas seem to seeking a definition not of\ncausality per se (which most regard as a transitive relation), but\nrather an epistemic notion of ‘causal explanation’ or\n‘causal salience’. \n\nCognitions that are not memories are classified under two headings:\ntrue and false. If we can find factors invariably preceding\ntrue cognitions, then we will have the beginnings of a causal\ntheory of knowledge. We will be able to say that a cognition is a\nknowledge-episode iff it is (i) true and (ii) preceded by a causal\nfactor which invariably precedes true cognitions (i.e. its truth will\nnot be an accident). The Nyāya (TS 39) claim to find four, and\nonly four, invariable correlations: perception, inference, comparison,\nand testimony. To each they apply the model of causation outlined\nabove. In particular, they isolate, in each case, a\n‘special’ instrumental cause (karaṇa), to\nwhich they give the name ‘pramāṇa’.\nIn the case of perception, for example, it is the senses. Note that an\ninvariable correlation between two entities, in the sense defined\nabove, does not entail that whenever the first is present, so is the\nsecond—the potter is invariably connected with a pot, but only causes\na pot when he is actually ‘operating’. Similarly, a\npramāṇa, e.g. the eyes, only causes a true\ncognition when it is actually operating. In other words, the\npramāṇa is a necessary but not a sufficient\ncause for true cognitions. To get a sufficient cause, the Nyāya\n(TSD 69 iii) says: \n\nThis is, in effect, the operative condition for true\nperceptual cognitions. Thus, the occurrence of all the usual factors\n(substrate causes, non-substrate causes, general instrumental causes,\netc.) together with an epistemic excellence (guṇa) is\na necessary and sufficient causal condition for the occurrence of a\ntrue cognition (see also Philips and Tatacharya 2003). \n\nNoticing something coiled up in the corner of the room, I perceive\nit to be a piece of rope. Looking out of the window, I see that the sky\nis blue and see also, perhaps, the blueness of the sky. I see too that\nthe air is cold, and that there is nobody on the street. What do all\nthese experiences have in common, in virtue of which they are all acts\nof perception? The Manual of Reason (TS 46) gives the\nclassical Nyāya answer: \n\nAll seeings are the product of a sensory connection (of a type to be\nspecified) with the thing seen. This basic idea must be embellished in\ntwo ways before it is can serve as a proper a theory of perception: (i)\nsome account must be given of the fact that, in all the cases cited\nabove, the content of perception is semantically structured (e.g. that\nthe thing in the corner is a piece of rope), for otherwise perceptual\nexperiences would not be capable of being true, and hence fail to\nqualify as knowledge-episodes; (ii) an account must be given of the\ntype of ‘connection’ involved here. Only then can we\nevaluate the merits of the Nyāya theory. \n\nA structured perception, of an object a as having a certain property\nf (e.g. seeing the thing in the corner as being a piece of\nrope), is called by the Naiyāyikas ‘qualificative’\n(savikalpaka = saprakāraka), for it a perception of an\nobject, the ‘qualificand’ (viśeṣya) as\nhaving a certain feature or ‘qualifier’\n(prakāra; viseṣaṇa) (cf. TS 47). It\nis alleged by the Naiyāyikas that any piece of\nperceptual knowledge must be of this form, and further that\nmost cases in which we claim just to be seeing an object\n(e.g. “I see the car”) are really cases of seeing\nsomething as a car. In a ‘qualificative’ perception, it is\nthe qualificand which is in sensory connection with the perceiver. How\nthen does the qualifier enter the picture? The Nyāya claim\nthat: \n\nThe intuitive idea is that the qualifying feature is a concept,\nempirically acquired by the perceiver, and now used to categorise the\nobject perceived. To see that the passing animal is a horse, one must\nfirst possess the concept horse, by means of previous\nacquaintance with the type. (Use of the term ‘concept’ here\ndoes not imply that the features are in any sense subjective—for the\nNyāya they are objective entities or constructions out of\nobjective entities). The Nyāya thus use their theory of memory\n(initial experience causing dispositional trace causing memory event)\nas a theory of concept-possession. \n\nPrinciple 2 has a number of consequences: \n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 48) reports the standard\nNyāya view, which is due to Uddyotakara, that there are exactly\nsix types of sense-object relation which ground perceptual\nexperiences: \n\nGaṅgeśa criticises Principle 1 on three grounds: (a)\nit entails that every awareness is perceptual since every awareness is\nproduced by the instrumentality of the ‘inner’ sense\nfaculty or manas; (b) it fails to include divine perception,\nwhich involves no sensory connection; and (c) there is no one type of\nsensory connection, nor anything obviously in common to the ad hoc list\nof six types. Gaṅgeśa therefore offers a new\ndefinition: \n\nTwo objections to this definition are countered. Objection 1: Since\nevery qualificative cognition is produced by a prior awareness of the\nqualifier, the definition under-extends. Reply: No. The awareness of\nthe qualifier is merely an auxiliary causal factor, the\n‘special’ instrumental cause is a sense-object contact.\nObjection 2: Since recognition, which is a type of perception, does\nhave the prior awareness of the qualifier as its ‘special’\ninstrumental cause, the definition under-extends. Reply: No. The\n‘special’ causal factor is the memory of the qualifier\ntriggered by the dispositional trace produced by the prior awareness,\nnot the prior awareness itself. \n\nGaṅgeśa’s definition has the virtue of\ncapturing the sense in which perceptual experience is more\n‘immediate’ than other types of experience, and is also\napplicable both to human and to divine perception. Restricted to human\nperception, it turns into the previous definition\n(Gaṅgeśa says that the ‘inner’ sense should\nnot be regarded as perceptual after all). \n\nGaṅgeśa’s\nTattvacintāmaṇi is divided into four parts, one\nfor each of the four knowledge-sources or\npramāṇas recognised by the Nyāya school.\nThe post-Gaṅgeśa scholars focused more and more\nexclusively on the second part, concerning inference, and wrote\nincreasingly detailed commentaries on a comparatively small portion of\nthe book, namely the part where Gaṅgeśa examines the\nrelation between inferential sign and property-to-be-inferred, which is\ncalled the vyāpti, ‘pervasion’ or\n‘inference-warranting’ relation (Ingalls 1951, Goekoop\n1977, Wada 2007). Even today, in a traditional Indian education, study\nof these sub-commentaries on various subsections of the\nvyāpti section of Gaṅgeśa forms an\nessential part of the curriculum. \n\nThe general structure of a properly formulated Nyāya inference\nhas three components: thesis, reason (hetu) and example\n(dṛṣṭānta). The thesis, again, has two\ncomponents: the ‘locus’ (pakṣa) or place of\nthe inference, and a property (sādhya) whose presence in\nthe locus is to be inferred.  Thus every Nyāya argument exhibits\nthe same pattern: p has S, because it\nhas H; e.g. d. For example, “The mountain (\n= p) has fire (= S), because it has smoke (\n= H); e.g. the kitchen ( = d). A sound argument must\nfulfil at least three criteria: (i) the reason property must be\nuncontroversially present in the locus; (ii) the reason property and\nthe inferred property must be appropriately related, roughly such that\nwherever the reason is present, so is the inferred property; (iii) the\nexample must be an uncontroversial place where both the reason\nproperty and the inferred property are present.\n \n\nCertain topics concerning this account are addressed in The\nManual of Reason and other Navya-Nyāya texts. Among them\nare: the conditions under which inference can take place, and the\nconditions under which the result is a knowledge-episode (TS 49, 54);\nthe correct account of the inference-warranting relation, between the\ninferential sign and the property-to-be-inferred, called the\n‘pervasion’ or ‘vyāpti’\nrelation (TS 50); the distinction between inference and demonstration\n(svārtha- and parārtha- inference) (TS\n52, 53); the three-fold classification of inference types, those which\nare ‘universally positive’ (kevalānvayin),\nthose which are ‘universally negative’\n(kevala-vyatirekin), and those which are combined positive and\nnegative (anvaya-vyatirekin) (TS 55); the types of inferential\nfallacy (hetvābhāsa) (TS 57-64). \n\nI will discuss mainly the definition of the ‘pervasion’\nrelation. First, however, a brief note on how the causal model of\nknowledge is applied to inference. The ‘special’\ninstrumental cause (karaṇa) of an inferential cognition\nis said to be the inferrer’s knowledge of the relevant pervasion\nrelation. The ‘operative condition’\n(vyāpāra) is said to be an awareness that the locus\nof inference (p) possesses such an inferential sign\n(h) as is pervaded by the property inferred\n(s). This is, in effect, an awareness which combines the two\npremises of the argument together immediately prior to the conclusion\nbeing derived, and is called the\n‘parāmarśa’ or\n‘consideration’. The ‘guṇa’ or\n‘causal factor responsible for the truth’ of the\ninferential cognition is the condition that this\n‘consideration’ be true, i.e. that the locus does in fact\npossess such a sign as is pervaded by the inferred property. Another\nauxiliary causal factor is that the inferrer must either not yet\nalready know the conclusion or else must have a particular desire to\ninfer (i.e. given, knowledge of the premises, the inference would\nnormally take place mechanically, but if the conclusion is already\nknown e.g. perceptually, then the inferrer has to have a special wish\nto re-establish it inferentially). This condition is known as\n‘pakṣaṭā’, and should not to be\nconfused with ‘pakṣadharmatā’, which\nis the name of condition (i) above. \n\nVyāpti or pervasion, is that relation between the\ninferential sign (hetu) and the inferred property\n(sādhya), which legitimises the inference. It would\ntypically be expressed by a sentence such as “wherever there is\nsmoke there is fire”, or “whatever exists is\ntransitory”. Knowledge of this relation, according to the\nNyāya, is the instrumental cause in the inferential process—it\nis that relation knowledge of which, when combined with observation of\nthe inferential sign, will permit us to make a sound or\nknowledge-yielding inference. Gaṅgeśa therefore attaches\ngreat importance to the precise definition of this relation. He notes\nas many as twenty-one definitions all of which he rejects for some\nreason or other, and then he goes on to give seven further\nformulations, each of which he considers acceptable. Of the definitions\nhe rejects, the first five came to be known as the\n‘vyāpti-pañcaka’, and inspired a\nhuge literature both among the Sanskrit commentators and their modern\ninterpreters. These definitions are traceable to the earlier Buddhist\nand Nyāya literature. Two more rejected definitions, known as\nthe ‘Lion and Tiger’ definitions, are apparently due to\nGaṅgeśa’s Navya-Nyāya predecessors (Wada\n2007, ch. 5). The definition Gaṅgeśa finally accepts is\ncalled his\n‘siddhānta-lakṣaṇa’. \n\nThe five definitions which make up Gaṅgeśa’s\n‘vyāpti-pañcaka’ are all varieties of\nwhat we might dub the ‘no counter-example’ definition of\nthe pervasion relation. This states that the inferred\nproperty S pervades the reason property H just in\ncase there is no place/entity where H is located\nbut S is absent. Formally: \n\nwhere S′ is used to denote the complement\nof S. This definition is traceable both to the early\nNyāya notion of a ‘deviating’ pseudo-reason (i.e. one\nwhich occurs somewhere where the inferable property S is\nabsent), and to Diṅnāga’s\n‘triple-condition’ theory of the inferential sign, his\nthird condition being that H must not be located in any\n“disagreeing case” (cf.\n‘vipakṣa’), i.e. a place where S\nis absent. In either case, the intuition is that a relation expressed\nby “where there is smoke there is fire” obtains just in\ncase there is no place where fire is absent but smoke is present, i.e.\nno counter-example. The first definition which Gaṅgeśa\nconsiders is of just this form. It is that S\npervades H iff H has “non-occurrence in the\nloci of absence of S”\n(sādhyābhāvavad-avṛttitvam), i.e.\nV1. \n\nWhy is this plausible-seeming interpretation of the notion of\npervasion rejected in Navya-Nyāya? There are two reasons: \n\nThe Problem of Partially Locatable Properties. The first\nproblem with the ‘no counter-example’ definition depends\non the Navya-nyāya notion of partial location\n(avyāpya-vṛtti). A property is said to occur\nwholly or completely in an object if it occurs in every part of that\nobject. For example, the property of being golden occurs completely in\na piece of (pure) gold; the object is ‘saturated’\n(abhivyāpya) by the property, just as sesame oil\nsaturates a sesame seed. Some properties, however, occur in some parts\nof the object but not others—these are called “partially\nlocatable”. For example, the property of being molten occurs at\nthe centre of the Earth but not at the periphery. Note that the same\nproperty can be wholly located in some loci and partially located in\nothers—e.g. redness occurs wholly in a ruby but partially in a\nred snooker ball. The distinction concerns two modes of\nproperty-possession, not two types of property. An important point is\nthat, if a property is partially located in an object, then so is its\nnegation. The Naiyāyikas’ standard example of a partially\nlocatable property, viz. “…is in contact with a\nmonkey” (kapi-samyoga), illustrates the point. If the\nmonkey is sitting on a branch of a tree, then the following statements\nmay be true: \n\n(2) being true because there are parts of the tree with which the\nmonkey is not in contact. Nyāya avoids the threatened violation\nof the law of non-contradiction by relativising the notion of\noccurrence. (1) is thus analysed as “the occurrence, of the\nproperty being-in-contact-with-the-monkey in the tree, is delimited\nby (avacchinna) the branch”. Since a different delimitor\nappears in (2), there is no inconsistency between the two statements.\n \n\nThe main effect of admitting partially located properties into the\nsystem is that it is no longer the case that a property, P,\nand its complement, P′, are disjoint: they may now\nintersect. If the inferred property is partially located, then the\nclass of “agreeing cases” (sapakṣas -\nplaces where the inferred property is present) and the class of\n“disagreeing cases” (vipakṣas—places\nwhere the inferred property is absent) overlap rather than being\ndistinct classes. To put it another way, a property P should\nbe thought of as having both a “presence range”\n(P+) and an “absence range” (P−),\nand the two may overlap. Consider now the standard inference\n“The mountain has fire, because it has smoke”. Suppose we\nfind a place where smoke is present, and fire is both absent and also\npresent, e.g. the kitchen. Does this show the inference to be faulty?\nAccording to definition V1, it does, because the kitchen\nwill be a counter-example, a place where smoke is present and fire\nabsent. But this is wrong: since fire is also present there, it is not\na real counter-example to the rule “where there is smoke there\nis fire”. The upshot is that we must examine the “presence\nranges” of the reason property and inferred properties, not\ntheir “absence ranges”. A real counter-example to rule is\na case which is in the presence-range of the reason property but not\nin the presence range of the inferred property.\n \n\nGaṅgeśa’s second definition is designed to solve this\nproblem: H’s “non-occurrence in the loci of absence\nof S which are different from locus of S”. In\nother words, a locus of absence of S which is also not a\nlocus of S should not be a locus of H: \n\nThe effect of the new clause is precisely to rule out the problem of\npartially locatable properties, by specifying more restrictively what\nconstitutes a counter-example. \n\nThe Problem of Universally Positive Inference. There are,\nclaim the Nyāya, patterns of legitimate inference in which the\nproperty inferred has as its extension the entire domain. Such\ninference are called ‘kevalānvayin’ or\n‘universally positive’ (cf. TS 55). The stock Nyāya\nexample is the inference “This is nameable, because it is\nknowable”, nameability being regarded as a property of\neverything. Another example would be “This exists because it is\nproduced”. If such an inference is sound, then its reason\nproperty and inferred property must exemplify the pervasion\nrelation. According to the above definition, to say that nameability\npervades knowability is to say that any locus of the property\nabsence-of-nameability is not a locus of knowability. The problem is\nthat, since nameability is a universal property,\nabsence-of-nameability is an uninstantiated (aprasiddha)\nproperty, and the Nyāya claim that such properties are\nontologically suspect. To put it another way, the statement “any\nlocus of the property absence-of-nameability is not a locus of\nknowability” includes a non-referring expression,\n“locus-of-absence-of-nameability” or “unnameable\nthing”, and hence is not truth-evaluable. The problem does not\narise for all uninstantiated properties, for some, e.g. being a\nsky-lotus, or being a square circle, can be shown to be constructs\nmade out of simpler instantiated properties. Thus, the statement\n“The square circle is circular” can be taken not as\ncontaining a non-referring expression, but as meaning “The\ncircle is square and circular”. However, ‘unnameable\n(thing)’ is not decomposable into two distinct properties this\nway. \n\nNone of the interpretations of the ‘no counter-example’\ndefinition considered by Gaṅgeśa can solve the problem\nof universally positive inferences, and Gaṅgeśa\naccordingly rejects them all. His own definition uses a trick to get\nround the problem. \n\nThe Manual of Reason reproduces with slight simplification\nGaṅgeśa’s new definition. It says that S and\nH are related by the pervasion relation just in case there is\ncollocation of H with S and S is not a\nproperty the absence of which is collocated with H\n(hetusamānādhikaraṇātyantābhāvāpratiyogi-sādhyasāmānādhikaraṇyam\nvyāptiḥ; TS 50). Almost the same formulation is found\nin other Navya-Nyāya texts, such as the\nSiddhānta-muktāvali. This definition is supposed to\nbe applicable even if the inferred property S is\n‘universally positive’. The idea, roughly, is that if\nS pervades H then no property whose absence is\ncollocated with H can be identical to S. If we can\nfind an instance of a locus of smoke which is also a locus of the\nabsence of some property, coldness say, then coldness cannot be\nidentical with fieriness. That is: \n\n(There is an implicit quantification over P here). What this\nsays is that there is no place where H is collocated with the\nabsence of S, but it does so without actually using the\npotentially non-referring phrase “absence of S”, and it\nthereby avoids the problem of universally positive\nproperties. However, although this condition is necessary for\npervasion, it is not sufficient, for it is consistent with H\n(or S) being uninstantiated. So Gaṅgeśa insists\ntoo that H and S must be collocated: \n\nGaṅgeśa’s trick implicitly trades on the theorem\n“A → B ≡ ¬ (A &\n¬ B)”. Thus clause (i) is virtually equivalent to\nV1. This shows too that we do not yet have a definition\nwhich can deal with the partially locatable properties, for which we\nneed something more like V2. Hence\nGaṅgeśa’s final definition is: \n\nThis definition of pervasion is able to handle both universally\npositive properties and partially located properties appearing as\ninferred property. \n\nOne may wonder why it is that, since a pervasion relation is of the\nform “all Hs are S”, the Naiyāyikas\ndid not simply use the notion of universal quantification in their\ndefinitions. The answer, perhaps, is that they were in fact trying to\ndefine this notion, and to do so only in terms of certain other\nnotions which they took to be primitive, especially the notion of\nco-location and absence.  If this is correct, however, then we must\nshow how to reconstruct the definition without its implicit\nquantification over a property P (cf.  Goekoop 1967). \n\nJust as perception and inference are described, in the\npramāṇa system, as knowledge-yielding\nfaculties, so too is language. This leads the Nyāya to formulate\na description of the mechanism by which a competent language-user is\nable to decode noise-utterances and derive language-based knowledge.\nThe description The Manual of Reason gives of this\n‘language processing mechanism’ is as follows (TS 67, 68).\nThe input to the process is the hearer’s auditory perception of a\nspoken utterance qua uninterpreted noise, and this is identified as the\n‘special’ instrument cause (karaṇa). For\nexample, hearing the noise-string \n\nThe ‘operative condition’\n(vyāpāra) is the hearer’s (tacit)\nknowledge of the meaning (śakti-jñāna)\nof each of the words in the utterance. This is what marks off a person\nwho understands the language in question from one who does not (but who\nmay, nevertheless hear the words spoken, without having the capacity to\ninterpret them). For example, knowledge that \n\nThe output of the process, i.e. the effect of the combined causal\nfactors, is the hearer’s forming a belief, for example belief\nthat \n\nJust as, in the case of perception, a number of auxiliary causal\nfactors, such as there being adequate lighting, the perceiver’s\nsense-faculty being in good condition, the perceiver paying attention,\netc., so here too. Nyāya isolates four such factors for special\nattention, namely: spatio-temporal ‘contiguity’\n(sannidhi) of the uttered words; the speaker’s intention\n(tātparya); ‘syntactic expectancy’\n(ākāṅkṣā); and\n‘semantic fitness’ (yogyatā) (cf.\nTS 67). The first is self-explanatory: if the words in the utterance\nare uttered one at a time over a long period of time, or mixed in with\nthe words of a distinct utterance, it will be impossible form a proper\nauditory perception of the utterance. The second,\n‘speaker’s intention’ is appealed to when the\nsentence contains an ambiguous word—disambiguation proceeds via\nconsideration of the speaker’s intended meaning. The Manual\nof Reason defines ‘syntactic expectancy’ as ‘the\ninability of one word to produce, without another word, an awareness of\nthe relation between them’, and it cites, as an example of an\nutterance which fails to possess such expectancy, the sentence\n“horse man elephant”. Clearly the idea is at least that the\nutterance must be grammatically correct. More than that, there is a\nsuggestion that it is in virtue of the syntactical rules that the\nunarticulated semantic relations between the words are expressed. What\nmakes it the case that someone who understands the utterance “the\ncat is on the mat” grasps a united proposition, and not just a\nlist of items [the cat, the on-relation, the mat]? The idea here,\nperhaps, is that (knowledge of) the syntactical rules generates an\nawareness of the connecting relations between each of these items. \n\n‘Semantic fitness’ (yogyatā) is an\nintriguing concept. The Manual of Reason defines it as\n‘the absence of incompatibility among what is signified by the\nwords’, and illustrates its definition by contrasting the\nsentence “He sprinkles the field with water” with “He\nsprinkles the field with fire”. The idea is that the activity of\nsprinkling is ‘compatible with’ (i.e. can only be done\nwith) a liquid like water, and not with a substance like fire. It would\nbe like saying “Cathood is on the mat” or perhaps\nChomsky’s “Colourless green ideas sleep furiously”.\nSuch sentences, though grammatically correct, do not make sense. This\ncausal factor, then, is that an utterance is intelligible only if the\nproposition expressed is ontologically possible, by the light of a\npreconceived ontological system, such as the Vaiśeṣika\nsystem of categories. Some Naiyāyikas, however, impose a more\ndemanding requirement, that to be ‘semantically fit’ the\nutterance must be true, i.e. that ‘fit’ =\n‘true’, not merely ‘possible’, and consequently\nthat an utterance is intelligible only if it is true! In effect, they\nidentify ‘semantic fitness’ with the\n‘guṇa’ or ‘causal factor leading to\ntruth’, in the language-processing mechanism. We will return to\nthis dispute a little later. \n\nThe Manual of Reason’s definition of a word is\ncelebrated and often quoted. It says (TS 66) that a word is that which\nhas semantic power (śaktaṃ padam). A sentence\n(vākya) is defined as a collection of words. So The\nManual of Reason’s definition fits with the modern one,\naccording to which a word is a semantically significant sentential\nconstituent. Semantic power is that knowledge of which enables the\ncompetent hearer to interpret the word, and this, for the\nNaiyāyikas, consists in the word’s standing for an object.\nThus, someone who understands the word “cat’ knows\nsomething of the form <“cat” means cat>, where\n“means” is a relation between words and objects of some\ntype. The Manual of Reason raises three questions about this\nrelation: (i) Is it a new and irreducible type or relation, not\nreducible, that is, to any of the relations already admitted (TSD 66a)?\n(ii) What is the relatum, i.e. with what type of entity are words\nsemantically related (TSD 66b, k)? (iii) How do we learn the meaning of\na word (TSD 66c, d). \n\n(i) The Mīmāṃsakas and Grammarians were\n‘essentialists’ about meaning, arguing that the Sanskrit\nlanguage is a natural entity, independent of human convention or usage,\nwhose words possess intrinsic semantic powers to signify objects, just\nas fire has the intrinsic capacity to burn. The Naiyāyikas\ntraditionally opposed this view, arguing instead that language is a\nproduct of convention, and that it is possible to account for a\nword’s semantic power in terms of stipulations governing its use.\nThe claim is that we can define (and hence analyse) the\nmeaning-relation thus: \n\nNow a stipulation or decree is claimed to consist in the\ndecree-maker’s having a certain mental state, viz. a\n‘desire’ or ‘will’ (icchā) of\nthe form specified. Thus, the meaning relation is analysed in terms of\nmental states and their contents, and not as a new type of relation.\nWho is the decree-maker? The Manual of Reason states that it\nis God, but most later Naiyāyikas drew a distinction between\nwords which have belonged ‘endlessly’ in the language\n(introduced by God) and words introduced by an explicit human\nstipulation (e.g. the technical terms in Pāṇini’s\ngrammar). \n\n(ii) What is the meaning-relatum of a word like “cow”, a\ngeneric nominal expression? Here again The Manual of Reason\ncontrasts the Nyāya view with that of the\nMīmāṃsakas. One sub-school of\nMīmāṃsakas (the Bhātta) claim that the\nmeaning of “cow” is the universal cowhood, since sentences\nlike “(The) cow is an animal”, or injunctive laws like\n“Never kick a cow”, say something about the entire class of\ncows, not about any one individual. Thus: \n\nIn reply to the obvious objection, that in many other sentences,\nsuch as “The cow is in the garden”, a particular cow is\nreferred to, these Mīmāṃsakas appeal to the idea\nthat a sentence can carry an ‘implication’\n(ākṣepa) other than its literal meaning. Thus\nthe sentence “The cow is in the garden” may mean literally\nthat cowhood is collocated with occurrence-in-the-garden (i.e. that\nthere exists a cow in the garden), but carries the implication that a\ncertain particular cow is in the garden. The principle here is that a\nprior awareness of the qualifier\n(viśeṣaṇa) leads to an implicated\nawareness of the thing qualified (viśeṣya) (TSD\n66b). The Nyāya reply to this argument proceeds by way of\nrejecting the principle cited, for, they say, awareness of a qualifier\nor universal is possible only via an awareness of the thing qualified.\n \n\nThe Manual of Reason states the modern Nyāya view:\nthe meaning of an utterance of the word “cow” is a\nparticular individual as qualified by cowhood\n(jāti-viśiṣṭa-vyakti): \n\nThe idea is this. Anyone who understands an utterance of the\nsentence “(The) cow is in the garden” does so by (a)\nidentifying a certain object as the referent of the word\n“cow”, and (b) grasps that that individual is qualified by\nthe property occurrence-in-the-garden. However, one can only identify\nan object by distinguishing it from others, and this involves the use\nof a distinguishing feature. So the individual is grasped in awareness\nas distinguished/qualified by the feature cowhood. Since the meaning of\na word is, by definition, its contribution to the final belief\ngenerated by hearing the utterance containing the word, the meaning of\n“cow” is an individual as qualified by cowhood. Note that,\non such a theory, token utterances of “cow” vary with\nrespect to the individual to which they refer, but every token\nutterance nevertheless shares a common semantic property, viz. “\n…—qualified-by-cowhood”. The Naiyāyikas in this\nway draw a distinction between type- and token- meaning (or, as some\nsay, between meaning and reference). \n\nThe other Mīmāṃaka sub-school\n(Prābhākara) claim that, in order to explain the fact\nthat, on hearing a sentence, we grasp a unified proposition and not\njust a list of entities, the meaning-relatum of a word like\n“cow” is ‘an object connected with another’\n(itarānvita). The meaning-relatum is a cow along with a\n‘hook’ to link it with other meaning-relata. More\nprecisely, the meaning of the word would be something like \n\nSo the sentence “The cow is in the garden” does not just\nmean the list <cow, being in the garden>, as it would if each\nword simply designated an object, but rather the connected proposition\n<cow-which-is in-the-garden>. The idea, in effect, is that all\nmeaning-relata, are, in Frege’s terminology,\n‘unsaturated’. To this ingenious suggestion, The Manual\nof Reason replies (TSD 66k) that it is superfluous, for\n“since it is possible for the relation [between meaning-relata]\nto be apprehended as what is signified by the sentence [as a whole], it\nis not necessary to postulate a semantic power with reference to the\nrelation”. In other words, The Manual of Reason claims\nthat general (presumably syntactic) features of the sentence are enough\nto connect the meaning-relata, without needing to claim that those\nmeaning-relata themselves do the connecting. \n\n(iii) The Naiyāyikas offer the following account (TSD 66c) of\nlanguage acquisition. The child makes a series of observations\nconcerning the linguistic behaviour of adults. She hears adult A utter\na certain noise “Bring the cow” say, and sees adult B\nperform a certain action, bringing of the cow. Again, she hears A utter\nthe noise “Bring the horse”, and sees B bring the horse,\nand hears “Feed the cow” and sees the cow being fed. Then,\nby a twin inductive process, of (a) “agreement in presence”\n(anvaya) and “agreement in absence”\n(vyatireka)—i.e. noticing the correlation between A making\nor not making an utterance and B performing or not performing an\naction, and (b) ‘collection’ (āvāpa)\nand ‘rejection (udvāpa)—i.e. noticing the\nregularities between utterances of “cow” and events\nconcerning the cow, utterances of “bring” and bringing\nevents, etc., the child understands that the word “cow” is\nlinked with objects belonging the class of cows, etc. \n\nThis is an empiricist account of language learning reminiscent of\nthe account attributed by Wittgenstein to Augustine, and severely\ncriticised by him. Apart from the superhuman inferential powers\nattributed to the child, the problem highlighted by Wittgenstein is\nthat no amount of observation can show, for example, that the relevant\ncorrelation is between “cow” and cow-individuals, and not\nbetween “cow” and B’s cow-directed-actions, the\nuniversal cowhood, heifers rather than cows, etc. (cf. TSD 66d). \n\nThe Manual of Reason says that statements are either Vedic\nor secular. It adds that (hearing a) Vedic statement is a\npramāṇa, a means of knowing that which is\nstated, because Vedic statements are originally uttered by God. (The\nMīmāṃsakas dispute this. Not believing in God,\nthey say instead that a Vedic statement is a means of knowing precisely\nbecause it has no personal origin, and error in testimony is always a\nresult of human error in the source!) Hearing a secular statement is a\nmeans of knowing only if the speaker is an ‘authoritative\nperson’ (āpta). An authoritative person is\ndefined as one who speaks the truth\n(yathārthavaktā). There is an ambiguity here: is\nan authoritative person one who is speaking the truth with respect to\nthe particular utterance in question, or one who is generally truthful?\nAnother question here is: must the testifiee know that the testifier is\nan authority in this sense or not? \n\nTo confuse matters further, The Manual of Reason says that\nthe ‘guṇa’, causal factor responsible for\nthe truth of the testifiee’s belief, is\n‘yathārtha-yogyatā-jñāna’,\nwhich can mean either (i) veridical cognition of semantic fitness, or\n(ii) cognition of veridical semantic fitness. In either case, the\n‘guṇa’ has nothing to do with the\nspeaker’s credentials, it seems. Option (ii), however, must be\nwrong, for it cannot be a condition upon testimony that the\nhearer already knows that what was said is true. Option (i), however,\nwould not guarantee that the final hearer’s belief is true,\nunless by ‘fitness’ The Manual of Reason now\nintends a rather stronger notion, according to which the meaning-relata\n‘fit’ together iff they are in fact connected, i.e. if the\nutterance expresses a truth. This is, indeed, how some other\nNaiyāyikas understand the notion of yogyatā, but\ndoes not accord with The Manual of Reason’s own\ndefinition. \n\nI propose the following resolution. The language processing\nmechanism was described above as one which issues in the testifiee\nbelieving that which the testifier says. The truth of the\ntestifiee’s belief will therefore depend upon whether or not the\ntestifier is speaking truly, and so this should be called the\n‘guṇa’ here. However, we do not always\nbelieve what we hear, especially if we have reasons to suppose that the\nspeaker is not likely to be speaking the truth. It is possible, then,\nthat the output of the language processing mechanism is not simply\nbelief in what was said, but rather belief simply\nthat it has been said. There are, roughly, two sorts of case\nwhen this can happen: (1) if the testifiee judges that the testifier is\ndeceitful or unreliable or simply uninformed about the topic, and (2)\nif the testifiee knows on independent grounds that what the testifier\nis saying is false (which is consistent with the testifier believing it\nand testifying sincerely), perhaps on a priori grounds\nconcerning the plausibility of the assertion. With a little\ninterpretative licence, we might think that these two conditions\ncorrespond to the two conditions imposed by The Manual of\nReason on testimony: that the testifier must be an\n‘authority’ (āpta), and that the sentence\nmust be ‘semantically fit’ (yogya). \n\nThe Manual of Reason reports the standard\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika definition of a universal\n(sāmānya, jāti): \n\nUniversals are thus conceived of as unstructured, objective\nproperties which necessarily reside in individuals. The postulation of\nsuch entities in the Vaiśeṣika schema has explanatory\nforce, accounting for the distinction between ‘natural’ and\n‘conventional’ classifications. Intuitively, this is the\ndistinction between groupings such as the class of cows or horses,\nwhich reflect natural divisions (“cut nature at the\njoints”), and those such as the class of Cabinet Ministers or the\nclass of endangered species, which reflect anthropocentric concerns.\nThe Naiyāyikas mark this distinction by calling natural\nproperties “universals” (jāti) and\nanthropocentric properties “imposed” or\n“nominal” properties (upādhi).\nCorrelatively, a semantic distinction is drawn between “natural\nkind terms” (naimittikī), i.e. terms the basis\nfor whose application is a universal, and “imposed kind\nterms”, terms whose basis for application is an anthropocentric\nproperty. Udayana tried to make this distinction more precise by giving\na list of criteria for a property to count as natural. Examination of\nhis list (which are called the\n“jāti-bādhakas”—impediments\ndistinguishing natural properties) will reveal something further about\nthe nature of the natural properties according to Nyāya. \n\nThe six impediments are (1) ‘non-plurality’—a genuine\nuniversal must be plurally instantiated; (2) ‘equipollence’\n(tulyatva)—two co-extensive properties cannot both be\ngenuine universals; (3) ‘cross-connection’\n(saṃkara)—two genuine universals must not partially\noverlap; (4) ‘regress’—a property like universality\ncannot itself be a universal, on pain of infinite regress\n(universality-hood, etc. etc.); (5) a property like differentia-hood\ncannot be a genuine universal, for by definition the basic differentia\nshare no common universal property; (6) a property like inherence-hood\ncannot be a universal, since it does not inhere in its loci. Of these\nsix, the last three are there basically to maintain the internal\nconsistency of the Vaiśeṣika system, and the first is a\nstraightforward consequence of the definition of a universal. It debars\na singly-instanced properties such as space-hood from the status of\ngenuine natural kind, perhaps motivated by the thought that the very\nnature of a universal consists in its grounding judgements of the form\n“x is of the same kind as y”, which\npresuppose that there are at least two entities. \n\nThe second and third criteria are the most important, and can be\nstated more formally as follows. If P and Q are\ndistinct properties, then (equipollence, tulyatva): \n\nwhere ‘[P]’ denotes the extension\nof P. The contraposed form is: \n\nNote that this does not entail that universal properties are\nextensionally individuated or equivalent to classes, as some have\nmaintained. It shows only that corresponding to each class, there is at\nmost one universal. Although, within the domain of universals, a\nuniversal is uniquely determined by its extension, the distinction\nbetween a universal and a co-extensive imposed property (e.g. pothood\nand conch-shell-like-neck-hood) is an intensional distinction. \n\nAs for the third impediment (sāṃkarya),\nif P and Q are distinct properties, then \n\nThe contraposed form is: \n\n(The inclusion is strict because of the ‘equipollence’\nconstraint.) In other words, genuine universals are arranged in a\nhierarchy: given two universals, either they are related as genus and\nspecies, all instances of one being instances of the other, or else\nthey are completely disjoint, having no instance in common (e.g.\ncowhood-animalhood, cowhood-treehood). The Nyāya say that, if\none universal is thus subsumed by another, the former is\n‘lower’ (apara) and the latter is\n‘higher’ (para) (cf. TS 6). The\n‘highest’ universal of all is ‘existentness’\n(sattā), into whose extension falls every substance,\nquality and motion. The demand that universals be organised\nhierarchically shows that the Nyāya took as their paradigm the\nbiological species, which tend to exhibit this structure. Bearing in\nmind that the term for “universal”, i.e.\n“jāti” is also the word for caste, Matilal\n(1971: 76) speculates that \n\nSome Naiyāyikas, especially Bhāsarvajña and\nRaghunātha, reject the ‘cross-connection’\nimpediment, pointing out the problems encountered trying to apply\nit to non-biological natural kinds (e.g. redness and greenness overlap,\nas do pothood and goldhood). Raghunātha suggests that consistent\napplication of this principle would eliminate virtually all universals\nfrom the ontology. Udayana’s criterion of a property to be\n‘natural’ is thus not a necessary one, and neither is it\nsufficient: none of his impediments shows why the pair\n‘blue-green’ is more natural than Goodman’s pair\n‘grue-bleen’ (where x is grue iff x is green and examined\nbefore time t, and is blue otherwise, and vice versa for bleen.) \n\nThe idea that universals are, in some sense, ‘located’\nin particulars generated two distinctive objections to the theory.\nDiṅnāga trades on the spatial metaphor to argue that the\nNyāya conception of universals is incoherent. For, if a\nuniversal is ‘unitary’, it can be located in at most one\nplace, and thus not ‘plurally instanced’. If, conversely,\nif is located simultaneously at many places, that can only be because\nit has parts, each located at a different place, and hence is not\n‘unitary’. This argument plays on the ambiguity of the\nnotion of ‘being located’, and pretends that a universal\nlike cowhood is located in individual cows in just the same sense that\na cow is located in a field. Nevertheless, it forces the Nyāya\nto be more careful in its account of the universal-particular relation.\nAs The Manual of Reason notes (TS 84), a universal is said to\nreside in its instances by the relation of ‘inherence’\n(samavāya), defined as an “inseparability”\n(ayutasiddhi) relation. Of two entities, x and\ny, \n\nThe idea is that a cow cannot exist unless the universal cowhood\nexists, and that it is in this sense that cowhood is located in the\ncow. (The same relation is claimed to occur between non-repeatable\n‘qualities’ (guṇa) and substances, a whole\nand its parts, and the basic differentia and the atoms.) Spatial\nlocation, on the other hand, involves a quite different relation,\nnamely contact (saṃyoga). In this way, the term\n‘location’ is disambiguated. \n\nThe other problem is the classic one: what happens to a universal if\nall its instances are destroyed? Can universals exist without being\ninstantiated? The definition of the inherence relation permits this,\nfor the requirement is that cows cannot exist without cowhood, not vice\nversa. We might say that the cow’s existence supervenes on that\nof the universal cowhood. However, it is not so clear that we can say\nin the same way that the parts (of a car, say) cannot exist unless the\nwhole (car) exists. \n\nThe Vaiśeṣika traditionally and uniquely accept into their\nontology a category of item called ‘basic differentia’\n(viśeṣa), from which, some claim, they derive\ntheir name. The Manual of Reason defines these items as\nfollows (TS 83): “those entities which reside in the eternal\nsubstances [i.e. the atoms] and function as their differentiators are\ncalled viśeṣa”. The idea is that, just as a\ncow and a horse are distinct entities, as they have distinct\nproperties, so too even two atoms of the same substance, e.g. earth,\nmust differ with respect to at least one property. Each atom,\ntherefore, possesses a ‘differentium’ unique to itself,\nwhich serves to distinguish it from any other atom of the same\ntype. The assumption, then, is that any two non-identical items are\ndistinguished by virtue of possessing distinct properties. This is the\ncontraposed version of Leibniz’ Law that Indiscernibles are\nIdentical, that (∀P)(Px\n≡ Py) → (x = y), where\n“P” ranges over properties. The principle faces\ntriviality unless certain constraints are placed on the range of\nproperties quantified over. For example, if the property\n“… = y” is permitted, the principle states\nvacuously that identicals are identical. The Vaiśeṣikas\nimplicitly restrict the principle to intrinsic, non-relational\nproperties of the objects concerned, ruling out, for example,\n‘being at a certain spatial or temporal location’ as being\na property capable of discriminating two otherwise identical\nobjects. Thus, the claim seems to be that no two objects, including\natoms, can be intrinsically identical. This is how Leibniz himself\nappears to have understood his Law, saying that “It is always\nnecessary that beside the difference of time and place there be\ninternal principles of distinction….thus although time and\nplace serve in distinguishing things, we do not easily distinguish\nthem by themselves,” and that “There is no such thing as\ntwo individuals indiscernible from each other. Two drops of water, or\nmilk, viewed with a microscope, will appear distinguishable from each\nother”. \n\nThe principle is, admittedly, as strong one. Wittgenstein\n(Tractatus 5.5302) points out that it entails the logical\nimpossibility of a universe containing two identical spheres; Wiggins\nnotes that it implies the logical impossibility of even a single sphere\n(or any other symmetrical object), since it entails the identity of the\ntwo hemispheres (and so on until one reaches a geometrical point). More\nto the point, as the Vaiśeṣikas implicitly realised, it\nimplies the logical impossibility of more than one atom of a given\nsubstance (having a certain velocity, spin, etc.). Rather than reject\nthe principle, however, they instead introduced new intrinsic\nproperties, the basic differentia, thereby avoiding the unpalatable\nconsequence. \n\nThe later Naiyāyikas develop a remarkable theory of\nnonexistence. According to them, the absence of an object or\nfeature at a particular spatial or temporal location is a state of\naffairs just as objective as the presence of the object or\nfeature there. To Kanāḍa’s original list of six\ncategories (padārtha) or types of existent, they\ntherefore add a seventh, ‘absence’\n(abhāva). This ontological doctrine is underpinned by\n(i) phenomenological and (ii) semantic considerations. \n\n(i) The phenomenological point was that a negative awareness, say\nthat a certain person is not in the room, is a kind of awareness\nphenomenally distinct from any awareness about what is in the room.\nCognition of what is not has an autonomous phenomenology (this idea is\nnotably articulated by Sartre). The principle appealed to is thus: \n\nThe idea emerges in the Nyāya epistemology with their claim\nthat absence is perceived, and that this perception is a sui\ngeneris type of perceptual experience, not reducible to a\ncombination of ordinary perception and inference (cf. the sixth type of\nsensory connection in Uddyotakara’s list). \n\n(ii) The semantic point is that the Nyāya espouse a version\nof the correspondence theory of truth, according to which true\nsentences correspond to facts. It is alleged that true negative\nsentences (e.g. “The pot is not on the ground”) correspond\nto ‘negative facts’. Facts, however, are all, for the\nNyāya, of the same basic relational form, ‘bRa’\n(they are said to have a qualificand-relation-qualifier structure; i.e.\nthey are complexes of existing entities). This restriction on what\nconstitutes a fact is expressible via the following semantical\nprinciple: \n\nThe principle entails that one cannot use the truth-functional\nconnectives to construct facts, except where they are equivalent to\nterm-logical connectives. (For example, the sentence “Rama and\nSita are righteous” is equivalent to “Rama is righteous and\nSita is righteous”, but the term-connective in “Rama and\nSita are married” is not similarly eliminable in favour of the\ntruth-functional conjunction “Rama is married and Sita is\nmarried”.) The point is that a sentence like “The pot is\nnot on the ground” cannot correspond to a fact of the form\n‘¬bRa’ (as there are no such facts according to\nP2), but must rather correspond to a fact of the form\n‘bRā’. Hence the introduction into one’s\nontology of negative entities. \n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 85–88) reports the usual\nNyāya view that there are four types of absence: prior\nnonexistence (prāgabhāva); posterior nonexistence\nor ‘destruction’ (dhvaṃsa);\n‘constant’ or ‘absolute’ absence\n(atyantābhāva); and difference\n(anyonyābhāva). Of these, the first two refer to\npossible temporal states of a transient object. Suppose we represent\nthe temporal duration of a person A by the following line\n(assuming that he lived between 1650 and 1750): \n\nAt any time t1 prior to 1650, A does not\nyet exist, and at any time t3 later than\n1750, A no longer exists. In accordance with the above\nprinciples, Nyāya reformulates these negative existential claims\nas positive existential statements about negative entities, namely,\nthe ‘prior absence of A’,\n‘<A’ say, and the ‘posterior absence\nof A’, ‘A>’ say. Thus, the\nfirst reads: \n\nor, since, in the Nyāya idiom, objects are said to be located\nin time as well as in space, \n\nSimilarly, \n\nWhat happens at times such as t2? These are times at\nwhich A exists or is present (is located). Note, furthermore, that, at\nt2, there is a posterior absence of <A\n(for the prior absence of A is destroyed when A\ncomes into existence), which we designate by\n‘(<A)>’. There is also a prior absence\nof A> (for the posterior absence of A does not\nyet exist), i.e.  ‘<(A>)’. The Manual\nof Reason (TSD 89E) records the older Naiyāyikas’\nclaim that these double absences must be identical with the original\nentity, on pain of an infinite regress. Thus: \n\nLater Naiyāyikas apparently disputed this natural identity\n(which corresponds to the Law of Double Negation in classical logic),\non the ground that double negative constructions contain the concept of\nnegation, and hence are logically more complex. \n\nA third type of absence, called ‘constant’ or\n‘absolute’ absence (atyantābhāva) is\nillustrated by constructions of the form “The pot is not on the\nground”. The Manual of Reason states (TS 87)\nthat what distinguishes this type of absence is that it is located in\nthe three times—past, present and future. This seems odd, as it might\nbe that the pot is on the ground at some times but not others. Perhaps\nthe point is that the locus of the absence here is a spatial entity\nrather than a temporal one. For example, the construction “Heat\nis not in ice” illustrates this kind of absence. Perhaps,\nfurthermore, the force of this negation is that the pot is\nnever located on the ground—hence we cannot speak of the\nprior or posterior absence of the pot (for these concepts are defined\nin terms of times when the pot is present). (E.g. Udayana’s\ndefinition of a substance as that which does not have a constant\nabsence of qualities.) \n\nThe fourth type of absence, ‘difference’\n(anyonyābhāva), is illustrated by the sentence\n“The pot is not (the) cloth”. This is to be read as a\nnon-identity statement. \n\nThe Naiyāyikas thus say that every negative sentence is the\nnegation of a sentence of the form\n“aRb”, and they distinguish\nbetween cases where the relation R is the identity relation and cases\nwhere it is a relation other than identity. The object\na is called the locus of the absence, and the object\nb is called the ‘counterpositive’ or\n‘negatum’ (pratiyogin) of the absence, i.e. it is\nthe object whose presence in the locus is being denied. This\nhighlights the fact that absences are thought of as a kind of property\nor ‘locatable’, rather than as a kind of\n‘location’ (at least when the relation is not identity).\nFor example, the absence of A is located in many places at\nonce. It is not said that there is a distinct absence-of-A at\neach and every place where A is absent. We can now see how\nthe Nyāya parse negative sentences without using a sentential\nnegation. Take the sentence “The pot is not blue”. The\nfirst-order paraphrase of this would be: It is not the case that the\npot is blue (¬Fa). The Nyāya strategy is\nfirst to say that every property, such as blueness, has both an\nextension F (places where it is located) and a\ncounter-extension F′ (places where its absence is\nlocated), and then to paraphrase the sentence as: The pot has\nabsence-of-blue. Note that a partially locatable property is one for\nwhich the extension and counter-extension overlap—it is possible\nfor a feature to be collocated with its absence. \n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 89) makes some very interesting\nobservations about the logical properties of absence or negation. \n\nReference versus description. It is claimed that\nthere is a distinction between a qualified absence\n(viśiṣṭābhāva) and a mere absence\n(kevalābhāva). Consider the following pair of\nsentences: \n\nThe idea is that in (3) the ‘mere’ absence of\nAnnambhaṭṭa is located in the room, whereas in (4) a\nqualified absence (of Annambhaṭṭa as qualified by\nauthorhood) is located in the room. Do (3) and (4) really have distinct\nlogical forms? Perhaps we find here a realisation that nominal\nexpressions such as “The author of The Manual of\nReason” have two distinct logical functions, namely those of\nreferring to an individual and describing an\nindividual via his properties. (4) can thus be read either as\nasserting the same as (3), that Annambhaṭṭa is not in\nthe room, or as saying that the author of The Manual of\nReason, whoever it or she is, is not in the room, i.e. that the\nproperties ‘being the author of The Manual of\nReason” and “being in the room” are not\ncollocated. If that is the sense in which (4) involves a qualified\nabsence, then (3) and (4) do have different logical forms. \n\nUniversal Quantification. The Manual of\nReason draws another very important distinction, between a\nspecific absence (viśeṣābhāva) and a\ngeneric absence (sāmānyābhāva). These are\nillustrated by the following sentences: \n\n(N.B. they would be expressed by the same sentence in Sanskrit;\nhence the brackets). To say that there is a specific absence of pot in\nthe room is to say that some particular pot is not in the room, but to\nsay that generic absence of pot in the room is to say that any pot is\nnot in the room (i.e. no pot is in the room). The distinction is thus\nlinked to the formulation of universally quantified constructions.\nIndeed, in Nyāya logical theory, generic absences are used to\nformulate the pervasion (vyāpti) relation: “where\nthere is smoke there is fire” is contraposed to give “where\nthere is no fire there is no smoke”, and this is expressed by\nsaying that there is a generic absence of smoke in places where there\nis a generic absence of fire (cf. Ingalls 1951: 54–5). It is\nclear that (5) and (6) do have distinct logical forms. In the\nNyāya technical language, the distinction is made out by saying\nthat the property which delimits the counterpositiveness of the absence\n(i.e. the pratiyogitāvacchedaka) is this-pot-hood in\n(5), but pothood in (6). \n\nLogical Connectives and De Morgan’s\nLaws. The Manual of Reason touches on the meaning of\nconjunctive and disjunctive absence, i.e. absence of (both A\nand B) (ubhayābhāva) and absence of\n(either A or B)\n(anyatarābhāva). It observes that an awareness that\ntwo pots are absent is consistent with an awareness that one pot is\npresent (and the other absent). In fact, as Ingalls shows (1951:\n63–67) the Nyāya recognised the validity of two general\nequations: \n\nabsence of (both A and B) = (absence of A)\nor (absence of B), and \n\nabsence of (either A or B) = (absence of A)\nand (absence of B). \n\nThese are recognisably versions of De Morgan’s Laws, that\n¬(A & B) ≡ ¬A ∨\n¬B, and that ¬ (A∨B) ≡\n¬A & ¬B. As an example of the second of\nthese laws, consider Mathuranātha’s remark (1951: 66) that\na ‘heap’ of (specific) absences\n(abhāva-kūṭa) is equivalent to a generic\nabsence. A place which is the locus of generic absence of fire is a\nplace at which every particular fire is absent, and conversely, if\nevery specific fire is absent, then fire is generically absent. Thus\nthe ‘heap’ (conjunction) of specific absences of fire, is\nequivalent to the absence of any fire at all (the disjunction of\nspecific fires).","contact.mail":"jonardon.ganeri@icloud.com","contact.domain":"icloud.com"}]
