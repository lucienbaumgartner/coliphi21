Instrumental rationality, by virtually\nany reckoning, is an important, and presumably indispensable, part of\npractical rationality.  However, philosophers have been interested in\nit for further reasons.  To take one example, it has been suggested\nthat instrumental rationality, or some tendency toward it, is partly\nconstitutive of intention, desire, or action. To take another, more\nimportant, example, it has been argued that instrumental rationality\nis not only a part, but a special part, or even the whole, of\npractical rationality.  This thesis appears to threaten the\n“rational authority” of morality.  It seems possible that\nacting morally on some occasion might not be a suitable means to an\nagent’s ends.  If so, then according to this thesis, it would\nnot be irrational for her to refuse to act morally on such an\noccasion. \n\nWe should note two restrictions on the scope of this article.\nFirst, this article focuses on contemporary discussions of the\nsubject, apart from some brief discussions of Hume and Kant.  Notable\nomissions, for example, are Aristotle’s discussion of the practical\nsyllogism and his claim that deliberation is of means (Nicomachean\nEthics, Book III, Chapter 3). \n\nSecond, this article doesn’t focus on decision theory, which some may\n view as containing, or just being, a theory of instrumental \nrationality: what means to take to achieve certain ends (the \nsatisfaction of preferences, or the realization of valuable states of \naffairs) given credences, or beliefs, or information, about the \nprobabilities that various means will achieve those ends.\n\nIn this article, we begin (§1) by noting a\ndistinction that frames the discussion that follows: very roughly, a\ndistinction between the question of whether some attitude is such that\nan agent ought, or (more weakly) has reason, to have it, and the\nquestion of whether that attitude rationally coheres with her other\nattitudes. We first (§2) discuss the importance\nof means-end relations for what one ought, or has reason, to intend:\nspecifically, for how reasons for ends “transmit” to\nreasons for means. We then (§3) discuss\ninstrumental rationality understood as a norm of rational\ncoherence. Lastly, we consider (§4) the\n“Humean” thesis that instrumental rationality is the only\nkind of practical rationality.\n\nSomeone displays instrumentally rationality insofar as she adopts\nsuitable means to her ends.  But how should “rationality”\nbe understood?  Here it is important to distinguish between two things\nthat the casually phrased question, “What would it be rational\nfor an agent to do or intend?” could mean: As with any philosophical distinction, this contrast between\n“rational coherence” and “reason” might be\nquestioned.  But it is accepted by many of the authors who have\nwritten on the subject, and it will help to organize the discussion of\nthe subject matter. In principle, the answers to these questions might perfectly \ncoincide: that what agents have reason, or ought, to do just is what it \nwould be rationally coherent for them to do, and vice versa.  In several\n ways, however, the answers might be expected to diverge. \nFirst, even if what one ought to do is just to make one’s\nresponses globally coherent, what it takes to make one’s\nresponses locally coherent might differ from what it takes to\nmake them globally coherent.  According to the Subjective Desire-Based\nTheory, for example, what agents have reason, or ought, to do or\nintend is just what, given what they believe their circumstances to\nbe, would best satisfy their strongest, present intrinsic desires\ntaken as a whole.  Suppose that the agent’s strongest, present\nintrinsic desire is for health.  Nevertheless, out of habit, he\nintends to have a smoke, believing that lighting up is a necessary\nmeans.  According to the Subjective Desire-Based Theory, it is not the\ncase that he ought to intend to light up.  And it might be said that\nif he were globally coherent, the agent would not intend to light up.\nBut if he does form an intention to light up, he at least achieves a\nkind of local coherence. Second, what the agent has reason, or ought, to do or intend may\ndepend not on what she believes her circumstances to be, but\non something more “objective.” There are several\npossibilities.  What an agent has reason, or ought, to do, might be\nwhat the evidence (where this depends on something other than her\nattitudes) available to the agent suggests about her circumstances,\nwhat the evidence of the person making the reason- or ought-claim\nsuggests about the agent’s circumstances, what the evidence of the\nperson assessing the claim suggests about the agent’s circumstances,\nor all of the relevant facts about the agent’s circumstances.\nConsider the Objective Desire-Based Theory, which says that agents\nhave reason, or ought, to do or intend just what, given what their\ncircumstances actually are, would best satisfy their strongest,\npresent intrinsic desires taken as a whole.  Suppose the agent’s\nstrongest, present intrinsic desire is to drink a gin and tonic, and\nshe so intends.  However, she mistakenly believes that the stuff in\nthis bottle is gin, when it is in fact petrol.  So she believes that\nmixing the stuff with tonic is a means to drinking a gin and tonic.\nAccording to the Objective Desire-Based Theory, she does not have\nreason to intend to mix the stuff with tonic and drink it.  But if she\ndoes so intend, she might be said to have achieved a kind of rational\ncoherence, both local and global. Third, one might hold not a Desire-Based Theory, but a Value-Based\nTheory, according to which whatever ultimate ends an agent\nhas reason, or ought, to achieve depend not on what\nshe desires or wills, but instead on what is of\nindependent value.  Suppose the madman’s strongest, present intrinsic\ndesire is to set off a nuclear war, and he so intends.  Moreover, the\nmadman knows that intending to press this button is a necessary and\nsufficient means to setting off a nuclear war.  It might be said that,\nin intending to press this button, the madman would achieve a kind of\ncoherence, both local and global.  And according to the Desire-Based\nTheories, the madman ought so to intend.  According to a Value-Based\nTheory, however, it presumably is not the case that he ought so to\nintend. There are several reasons, therefore, to expect at least some \ndivergence between what one has reason, or ought, to do or intend, and \nwhat it would be rationally coherent for one to do or intend.  But that \nis perfectly compatible with partial convergence, even of a \nnon-accidental character.  As we will discuss below, some suggest that \namong the things that agents have reason, or ought, to do or intend is \nprecisely to make their responses rationally coherent.  Just as we ought\n not to torture, or ought to care for our children, we ought to be \nrationally coherent. We’ll begin by discussing how means-end relations matter for what\none ought, or has reason, to do or intend. (For an opinionated survey,\nsee Kolodny 2018.) But we should first consider how\n“means” is understood. While “means” are often\ntaken to be tools or resources, for our purposes, we will view means\nas actions, intentions, choices, decisions, etc. that might make use\nof such tools or resources.  It is natural to think of means to an\nend, so understood, as actions that help to cause the end to\noccur. But often philosophers count as means to an end whatever may\nhelp to bring it about. M may bring about E by causing\nit, as flicking this switch causes the illumination of this room,\nbut M may also bring about E by helping to constitute\nit, as playing this measure partially constitutes the playing of this\nsonata, or fulfilling preconditions for it, as registering for this\nconference fulfills preconditions for attending it, or preventing\nthings that might prevent it, as vaccination prevents disease that\nmight prevent successful completion of the school year. Means are also\noften probabilistic.  Something may also count as a means to an end\neven if it is not guaranteed to help to bring about the end, but only\nhas some chance of doing so.  Usage of “end” is also often\nambiguous.  Sometimes “end” is used to refer to\nan action, such as the action of illuminating this room.  But\nsometimes “end” is used to refer to a state of\naffairs that is either desired or valuable, such as the state of\naffairs of this room’s being illuminated. We’ll here use\n“end” to refer to an action. Reasons for action are often said to “transmit” from ends to means, \nin the sense that if there is reason for an end, then, because of this, \nthere is reason for the means. This idea is captured in Joseph Raz’s \nFacilitative Principle:\n \n [w]hen we have an undefeated reason to take an \naction, we have reason to perform any one (but only one) of the possible\n (for us) alternative plans that facilitate its performance. (Raz \n2005b) \n \n Insofar as what one ought to do depends on what one has reason \nto do, one might expect a similar transmission of “ought” from end to \nmeans.  If one ought to achieve an end, then one ought to take the \nmeans, or at least means of certain kinds. Principles of instrumental transmission of this kind are compatible \nwith different views about what ends we have reason to achieve.  For \nexample, it may be accepted by either a Desire-Based, or a Value-Based, \nTheory. What the correct principle, or principles, of instrumental\ntransmission are is controversial.  Most commonly, principles describe\ntransmission to necessary means.  However, some speak of sufficient\nmeans, and others speak of neither.  For example, Raz’s Facilitative\nPrinciple speaks of “facilitating plans.” Some\ntransmission principles say that “oughts” transmit from\nend to means, others say that the full force of the reason for the end\ntransmits to the means, others say that the strength of the reason for\nthe end that transmits to the means is proportional to other factors,\nand others, like Raz’s Facilitative Principle, say only that some\nreason for the end transmits to the means. To illustrate the problems facing an account of instrumental \ntransmission, it may be useful to work with some very simple principles,\n which lack many of the qualifications and nuances of Raz’s Facilitative\n Principle and other principles discussed in the literature: There are several problems that principles of instrumental\ntransmission need to avoid.  First, means to an end can\nbe costly, or otherwise objectionable.  Suppose that I ought\nto take a job in Alaska.  One (sufficient) means is to fly there;\nanother (sufficient) means is to take free passage on a merchant ship.\nBut flying costs more than I would earn there.  Presumably, I ought\nnot fly.  It may be said that I have some reason to fly, but that it\nis outweighed.  This is an argument against Ought Sufficiency.   However, with other kinds of costs, or objectionable features, it\nmay sound wrong to say even that one has reason for the means.\nSuppose I have reason to alleviate pangs of hunger.  One sufficient\nmeans to this is eating a sandwich; another sufficient means is\nkilling myself  (Broome 2005b). Some will resist the conclusion that I\nhave any reason at all to kill myself.  This is an argument against\nStrong Reasons Sufficiency and Weak Reasons Sufficiency.  Or suppose I\nhave reason to improve college policy.  But a necessary means to this\nis to kill the old don who resists any change (because unanimous\napproval is required).  Some will resist the conclusion that I have\nany reason at all to kill the don. This is an argument against Strong\nReasons Necessity and Weak Reasons Necessity.  However, it may not be\nan argument against Ought Necessity.  It may be said that the fact\nthat improving policy requires killing the don is itself a strong\nreason against improving policy, in light of which it is not true that\none ought to improve it.  In that case, Ought Necessity does not imply\nthat one ought to kill the don, which seems intuitive. In any event,\nthe force of the intuition on which the argument rests may be\nresisted.  Granted, it sounds odd to say that one has reason to kill\noneself.  But this may have a pragmatic explanation.  Why bother to\nidentify any reason to kill oneself when it is vastly outweighed by\nthe reasons against doing so?  (Raz 2005a; Schroeder 2005a, 2007). Second, problems arise from repeated applications of\ntransmission principles.  For one thing, means to means to an\nend may actually undermine the end.  Suppose, to take an example of\nRyan Millsap’s (2009a—see the Other Internet Resources), Kenny\nhas reason to bake both a loaf of bread and a cake for a display on\nMarie Antoinette.  A (necessary) means to that end is baking a loaf of\nbread.  Plausibly, he has reason to bake a loaf of bread.  A\n(sufficient) means to that means is baking a giant loaf,\nwhich uses all of the flour.  But that would prevent him from baking a\ncake, and so prevent him from achieving the end.  So, presumably, he\ndoes not have reason to bake a giant loaf, even though it is a means\nto something that he has reason to do.  For another thing, if we\naccept both Weak Reasons Necessity and Weak Reasons Sufficiency, then\nrepeated applications of these principles may imply that if there is\nreason for something, then there is reason for everything.  Suppose\nthere is reason to E, and let F be anything.\nIf E-ing or F-ing is a necessary means to E-ing,\nand if F-ing is a sufficient means to E-ing\nor F-ing, then, repeated application of those principles\nimplies that there is reason to F (Millsap 2009b—see the\nOther Internet Resources). Note that similar problems arise if we\naccept both Ought Necessity and Ought Sufficiency. Third, a means to an end might have a very low probability \nof helping to bring that end about.  Suppose, to take an example from \nJackson and Pargetter 1986, Professor Procrastinate has been asked to \nreview a book, which he both ought, and has reason, to do.  A \n(necessary) means to reviewing it is accepting the commission to review \nit.  However, even if he accepts the commission, he is very unlikely to \nreview it.  Professor Dispatch, in a parallel universe, is in the same \nsituation, except that he is very likely to review it if he accepts.  \nPerhaps Procrastinate, like Dispatch, has some reason to review it.  But\n Procrastinate may not have as much reason as Dispatch to accept; not \nall of the reason for the end may be transmitted to this (necessary) \nmeans.  And it may not be the case that Procrastinate ought to accept.  \nThis is an argument against Strong Reasons Necessity and Ought \nNecessity, since even if one takes a necessary means, there may still be\n a low probability of helping to bring that end about. However, it is \nnot an argument against the Sufficiency principles, assuming that \nsufficient means, if taken, are sure to help to bring the end about. Nevertheless—this is the fourth and final\nproblem—sufficient means may be superfluous to an end,\nwhere this means something like that, even if those means were\nomitted, the end would still be achieved.  Suppose that Drug 1 is a\nsufficient means to relieving the patient’s pain.  A doctor is sure to\ngive Drug 1.  Giving Drug 2, in addition, would at first neutralize\nthe effect of Drug 1, but then recombine with it to produce a third\ndrug, which will relieve the patient’s pain.  Giving Drug 2 would be\nsuperfluous to relieving the patient’s pain, although it would help to\nbring it about, by being part of the cause of the relief of the\npatient’s pain.  Does the doctor then also have any reason to give\nDrug 2?  At first, one might be tempted to say that the doctor does\nindeed have reason to give Drug 2, but that this reason is outweighed\nby the cost of giving Drug 2.  But observe that no matter how low we\nmake that cost, it still outweighs any reason to give it.  This\nsuggests that there is no reason at all to give it. Note that\nnecessary means cannot be superfluous, since if necessary means were\nleft out, the end would not be achieved. \nNow we consider instrumental rationality understood as a matter of\nrational coherence.  It is often said that someone is being locally\ninstrumentally incoherent insofar as he intends an end, believes,\nroughly, that something is a means to it, but refuses to intend that\nmeans.  More precisely, it seems that this is so only when the\nrelevant belief is about necessary means.  Suppose that I\nintend to go to Alaska, but believe that flying there is a sufficient,\nbut not necessary, means to going to Alaska.  Am I being\ninstrumentally incoherent in refusing to intend to fly there?  Not\nobviously: perhaps I believe that going by sea is cheaper, and I\nintend that. Some suggest that this focus, on intentions and beliefs about\nnecessary means, inspired by Kant’s initial discussion of\nhypothetical imperatives (see §4.4 below), is\noverly narrow  (see Smith 2004 and Wedgwood 2011).  Not simply\nintentions, but also desires, should be considered, and not simply\nbeliefs about necessary means, but also beliefs about non-necessary\nmeans should be considered. More precisely still, the relevant belief must be\nthat intending the means is itself necessary.  Suppose your\ndentist intends to remove your tooth, and believes that a necessary\nmeans to removing your tooth is causing you pain.  Is she being\ninstrumentally incoherent in refusing to intend to cause you pain?\nNot necessarily: she might believe that she will remove your tooth\neven if she does not intend to cause you pain.  But she will,\npresumably, believe that she will remove your tooth only if\nshe intends to use her instruments.  So, though she wouldn’t\nbe irrational in not intending to cause you pain, she would be\nirrational in not intending to use her instruments (Broome 2003;\nSearle 2001; Kamm 2000, 2007). Moreover, the relevant belief must be that intending the\nmeans now is necessary.  Suppose a beginning student intends\nto earn a doctoral degree and believes that, when the dissertation is\ncompleted, intending to submit the final paperwork is necessary for\nearning the degree.  It is not clear that she is being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend, now, to submit that paperwork.  She\nmay trust that, when the time comes, she will intend it (Setiya 2007).\nThis suggests, as Raz notes, that opportunities for instrumental\nincoherence may actually be very rare.  There seems to be considerable agreement, then, on what we might call the: But it is unclear exactly what requirement one violates.  \nAdditionally, it is unclear whether the requirement violated would be \n“normative” in the sense that one ought not to violate it.  In other \nwords, it is unclear whether, in being instrumentally incoherent, one \nviolates a requirement of reason, in the sense of “reason” \nidentified earlier.  In the remainder of this section, we’ll consider \nsome possible answers to these questions. First, (§3.1) we might say that there\nisn’t any requirement of reason to be instrumentally coherent as\nsuch, but whenever one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates\nsome independent requirement of reason.  Second,\n(§3.2) we might say that there is\na requirement of reason to be instrumentally coherent as such.  Third,\n(§3.3) we might deny that one\nnecessarily violates a requirement of reason in being instrumentally\nincoherent; perhaps the normativity of instrumental coherence is\nmerely apparent, or the requirement merely evaluative (it may be a\nstandard of proper functioning without giving anyone reason to comply\nwith it).  Fourth, (§3.4) one might\nthink, given the ways in which intention is thought to involve belief,\nthat in being instrumentally incoherent, one violates a requirement\nof theoretical rationality.  There are, of course, other answers that could be given.  (For \ninstance, we briefly discuss a constitutivist approach to instrumental \nincoherence, attributed to Kant, in §4.4)  But \nconsideration of these approaches will give a reasonably comprehensive \npicture of the recent attempts to explain the Violation Claim.  One answer is that when one is instrumentally incoherent one\nviolates some independent requirement of reason.  That\nis, either one has some specific attitude\n(or pattern of attitudes) that one ought not to have or\none lacks some specific attitude (or pattern of attitudes)\nthat one ought to have.  The source of the problem, according to this\nanswer, is not that when one is instrumentally incoherent,\none violates some requirement of reason to be instrumentally\ncoherent as such.  The source of the problem is instead that\nwhen one is instrumentally incoherent, then it is guaranteed that\none’s having (or lacking) one attitude (or pattern of attitudes)\nviolates some independent requirement of reason.  (See\nKolodny 2007b, 2008a; Kiesewetter 2018, esp. Ch. 10; Lord 2018,\nesp. Ch. 2.) Certainly, this can happen in some cases, at least accidentally.\nSuppose our madman intends to start World War III, believes that he\nwill start World War III only if he intends to launch a nuclear\nmissile, but refuses to intend to launch a nuclear missile.  The\nViolation Claim might be explained in this case by pointing out that,\nwhatever his other attitudes may be, he ought not to have the\nintention to start World War III, but does have that intention.  But\nwhy should we suppose that, in general, whenever one has an\ninstrumentally incoherent set, one either has an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought not to have, or lacks an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought to have? This would be so, in general, if the following were the case: It would also be so, in general, if the following were the case: Ought Pattern 2 speaks of “oughts” for patterns of\nintention, rather than for single intentions.  The reason for this is\nthat one’s having an intention to X can affect one’s reason for\nhaving an intention to Y.  This can happen in the following\nway.  First, one’s reason to intend to Y plausibly depends,\namong other things, on how likely one is to succeed in it.  Second,\nhow likely one is to succeed in it in turn depends on how the future\nis likely to be.  I am more likely to succeed in drying the laundry if\nthere is no rain.  Third, how the future is likely to be can depend on\nhow some person is likely to act.  I am more likely to succeed in\ndrying the laundry if the children are unlikely to be playing with the\nhose at the same time.  Fourth, the relevant person may be the agent\nhimself.  I am more likely to succeed in drying the laundry if I am\nunlikely to be at the same time watering the garden.  Finally, the\nfact that an agent intends to X can make it more likely that\nthe agent will X in the future.  The fact that I intend to\nwater the garden can make it more likely that I will be watering the\ngarden.  Thus, the fact that an agent intends to X can make it\nmore likely that the agent will not succeed in an intention\nto Y, and so that the agent has less reason to intend\nto Y.  Given that one’s intending to X can affect one’s\nreason to Y and vice versa, the questions, “What reason\ndo I have to intend to\nY?  What reason do I have to intend to X?” may be\ninsufficiently determinate.  Better questions may instead be\n“What reason do I have (to intend to X and to intend\nto Y)?  What reason do I have (to intend to X and not to\nintend to Y)?  What reason do I have (not to intend to X\nand to intend to Y)?  What reason do I have (not to intend\nto X and not to intend to Y)?” This phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon, that the presence of one\nintention can affect one’s reason to have another intention, should be\ndistinguished from the phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon, that the\npresence of one intention and the presence or absence of another can\nmake it the case that one violates or satisfies a rational requirement\nof instrumental coherence as such.  First, what matters for rational\nrequirements is what we believe about the relations between\nthe intentions, whereas what matters for reason would seem to be how\nthey are likely to affect one another, which may be\nindependent of what we believe.  Second, what matters for rational\nrequirements is intending to X as such, whereas what matters\nfor reason is what intending to X means for the future.  In\nsome cases, intending to X (e.g., intending to become King of\nFrance in 2023), may not affect the likely future.  In other\ncases, conditions other than intending to X (e.g., my\nself-trust that I will X even if I don’t intend it now, or my\nknowledge that I will be tortured or coerced into X-ing) may\naffect the likely future in the same way.  Finally, rational\nrequirements are usually taken to be wide-scope, as we will see below.\nThat is, one never needs to have or lack any particular attitude in\norder to satisfy them.  By contrast, one usually needs to have or lack\na particular attitude in order to conform to one’s reason to have a\ncertain pattern of intentions.  If one ought, for example, (to intend\nto X and not to intend to Y), then one can comply with\nthis requirement of reason only by intending to X and not\nintending to Y. One might argue for Ought Pattern 1 in the following way.  Suppose \nthat it is not the case that one ought not to believe that one will E \nonly if one intends to M.  Then by: one ought to believe it.  Suppose further that it is not the case\nthat one ought not to intend to E.  Then by: one ought to intend to E.  Suppose further that: Then one ought to E.  Then by: one ought to intend to M.  In other words, either one ought\nnot to believe that one will E only if one intends to M,\nor one ought not to intend to E, or one ought to intend\nto M. One problem is that the objections to Ought Necessity that we saw\nin §2 seem to apply to Variant as well.\nAnother is that Practical Strictness seems untenable (Way 2012a;\nCheng-Guajardo 2014). It might be the case neither that one\nought not to intend to E, nor that one ought to intend\nto E; intending to E might be merely permitted.  Suppose\nI ought to take a can of beans.  I can take the can of beans on the\nleft, or I can take the equally good can on the right.  It is neither\nthe case that I ought not to intend to take the can on the left, nor\nthat I ought to intend to take the can on the left. But perhaps in such cases one’s intending to take the can on\n the left provides a reason that tips the scales, thereby making it the \ncase that one ought to intend the means to that end. (See Schroeder \n2009, §4.1;  For criticism of the view that intentions provide reasons \nin this way, see Broome 2001 and Brunero 2007.)  If that’s true, then \nthese cases of “picking” wouldn’t pose a special problem for Ought \nPattern 1; in all such cases, one ought to intend to M.  One might argue for Ought Pattern 2 in the following way.  Again, \nsuppose that it is not the case that one ought not to have the belief.  \nThen, by Epistemic Strictness, one ought to have the belief.  For the \ntime being, suppose that one does not intend to M.  Then by: one ought to believe that one does not intend to M.  Then by: one ought to believe that one will not E.  Then by: one has no reason to intend to E.   In other words, so long as one \ndoes not intend to M, one has no reason to intend to E.  If we also \naccept: then, so long as one does not intend to M, one has no reason to \nintend to E and reason not to intend to E.  This makes it plausible that\n there is more reason (not to intend to M and not to intend to E) than \n(not to intend to M and to intend to E).  This does not mean \nthat one ought (not to intend to M and not to intend to E) all things \nconsidered.  For example, it might be the case that one ought (to intend\n to M and to intend to E).  But it does mean that whatever pattern of \nintention one ought to have, it is not to (not to intend to M and to \nintend to E).  There is a superior alternative. One question, of course, is whether we should accept these\nassumptions, in particular Required Self-Knowledge. Another problem is that even if this explains Ought Pattern 2, and\nso the Violation Claim, it does not explain the: Suppose that one ought to have the means-end belief and one ought (to\n intend to E and to intend to M).  However, one avoids incoherence by \ndropping the means-end belief, not intending to E, and not intending to \nM.  Intuitively, one has satisfied some requirement.  This is what the \nSatisfaction Claim reflects.  But one hasn’t adopted the particular \nattitudes (or patterns) that one ought to adopt.  How, then, are we to \nexplain the Satisfaction Claim? A quick answer might be this.  One might suggest, first, that one\nought to be instrumentally coherent, because it is a necessary means\nto, or at least a necessary condition of, having the particular\nattitudes (or pattern) that one independently ought to have, or not\nhaving the particular attitudes (or pattern) that one independently\nought not to have.  Suppose that one ought to intend to M, but\ndoes not.  Just as (P or Q) is a necessary condition\nof P, so too a necessary condition of intending to M is\n(either not to intend to E, or not to believe that one\nwill E only if one intends now to M, or to intend\nto M).  Now suppose that instead of intending to M, one\ndrops one’s intention to E.  While one hasn’t intended\nto M, which one ought to do, one has fulfilled a necessary\nmeans, or at least a necessary condition, of that.  Assume Ought\nNecessity of §2, perhaps slightly\nstrengthened: that one ought to take any necessary means to, or at\nleast fulfill any necessary condition of, what one ought.  In that\nsense, by dropping one’s intention to E, one has done something\nthat one ought, and so satisfied a requirement.  Analogously, if one\nought to post the letter, then, by similar reasoning, one ought\n(either to post the letter or to burn it).  So, if one burns the\nletter, one has done something that one ought, and so satisfied a\nrequirement. Note that this response assumes that either Ought Pattern 1 or\nOught Pattern 2 is correct.  Otherwise, we have no guarantee that, in\nany given case, a necessary condition of having the particular\nattitudes that one ought to have, or not having the particular\nattitudes that one ought not to have, is (either not to intend\nto E, or not to believe that one will E only if one\nintends now to M, or to intend to M).  So it inherits\nall of the challenges in defending Ought Pattern 1 or Ought Pattern\n2. Another problem with this response is that it is not obvious that\nOught Necessity is true, as the Professor Procrastinate example\nof §2 suggested. A third problem is that necessary conditions of intending\nto M are easy to come by.  Another necessary condition is\n(either intending to M or being instrumentally\nincoherent)!  Therefore, in exactly the same way, one satisfies a\nrequirement by remaining incoherent.  But the intuitive Satisfaction\nClaim is precisely that in escaping incoherence one satisfies a\nrequirement of a kind which one would not satisfy by remaining\ninstrumentally incoherent. The Violation and Satisfaction Claims would be explained by a\nrequirement of reason to avoid or escape instrumental\nincoherence as such.  Just as we ought not to torture, or\nought to care for our children, we ought to be instrumentally coherent\nas such. One might instead suggest a weaker view: we have a reason to be \ninstrumentally coherent as such.  But this weaker version faces a \ndifficulty in explaining the “strictness” of the Violation Claim.  One \ncould have a reason to X without being under any requirement to\n X, as when that reason to X is outweighed.  But, according to the \nViolation Claim, whenever one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates\n some requirement.  This “strictness” would thus remain unexplained by \nthe weaker view (Broome 1999).  Of course, the weaker view—that we have a\n reason to be instrumentally coherent as such—could be true even though \nit fails to explain the Violation and Satisfaction Claims. So, let’s work with the stronger view, according to which we ought to\n be instrumentally coherent as such.  One worry about this answer is \n“bootstrapping.”  Suppose that this requirement to be instrumentally \ncoherent as such is stated in “narrow-scope” form: if one intends to E \nand believes that one will E only if one intends to M, then one is \nrequired to intend to M.  Now suppose that one intends to stay in power \nand believes that one will do so only if one intends to kill one’s \nrival.  If one ought to be instrumentally coherent as such, it would \nfollow that one ought to intend to kill one’s rival.  But that seems \nimplausible.  So, one may conclude, we cannot understand “one is \nrationally required” as implying “one ought.”  A natural reply, however, is that there is another way to be\n instrumentally coherent: namely, to abandon the intention to stay in \npower.  Thus, a requirement of instrumental coherence as such should \ntake “wide-scope.” It should say: one is required to either revise one’s\n intention to E, or revise one’s belief that one will E only if one \nintends to M, or intend to M. (See especially Broome 1999 and Wallace \n2006.  For earlier defenses of the wide-scope view, see Hill 1973 and \nDarwall 1983.)  So even if “one is rationally required” is taken to \nimply “one ought,” all that follows is that one ought to either revise \nthe intention to stay in power, or revise the belief that one will do so\n only if one intends to kill one’s rival, or intend to kill one’s rival.\n  It does not follow that one ought to intend to kill one’s rival. However, there are some problems facing this approach, which we \noutline in the supplemental document \n Problems for Wide-Scoping. \nSome of those problems concern the allegedly implausible \nconsequences that emerge when we apply some of the transmission \nprinciples we discuss in §2 above—specifically, Ought \nNecessity, Weak Reasons Necessity, and Weak Reasons Sufficiency—to the \nrelevant wide-scope ought in certain cases. Other problems concern \nwhether the wide-scope formulation is adequate as a formulation of the \nrational requirement. \nThere are other challenges facing the view that the Violation and\nSatisfaction Claims are explained by a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such.  The proponent of this view,\npresumably, should be able to say what the reason is to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such (see Kolodny 2005, §2).  Keep in mind that it won’t be enough to state a reason to be disposed\n to be instrumentally coherent.  It doesn’t follow from one’s having a \nreason to have a disposition that one has a reason to manifest that \ndisposition on every particular occasion.  And so pointing to a reason \nto be disposed to be coherent wouldn’t yield a reason to be \ninstrumentally coherent as such.  (As we’ll see in\n §4.4,\n a similar problem confronts the Kantian constitutivist view that \ncontinued instrumental incoherence threatens our status as agents.  \nSince our agency isn’t at risk with every instance of instrumental \nincoherence, this account won’t yield a reason to be instrumentally \ncoherent on every particular occasion; it would only provide a reason to\n do so when one’s incoherence is extreme enough to threaten one’s status\n as an agent.)  Furthermore, it is not clear what reasons there are to \nbe disposed to be instrumentally coherent.  It might be thought that \nbeing disposed to be instrumentally coherent will make one more likely \nto conform to reason over the long run.  But given that instrumental \ncoherence may just as soon be gained by revising one’s attitudes against\n reason as in conformity to reason, one might doubt that this is so  \n(Kolodny 2008b). There’s a reason to be skeptical that such a reason could be \nprovided.  A reason to be instrumentally coherent as such would have to \napply at once to beliefs and intentions.  But one might think that this \ncannot be the case: that reasons for belief and reasons for intention \nare fundamentally different in kind.  Reasons for belief are \nconsiderations that show that the belief is likely to be true, whereas \nreasons for action are considerations that show that the action would \nrealize one’s desires, or promote or respect something of value. Some philosophers have attempted to meet this challenge.  Jonathan\nWay (2012a) has developed an account which points to the costs\nnecessarily involved in intending to E without also intending\nto M, specifically the psychological resources that would be\nwasted (one’s monitoring one’s progress towards E-ing, being\ndisposed to take means towards E-ing, etc.).  And Michael\nBratman (2009c) has recently suggested that we have a reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such because doing so is a necessary,\nconstitutive component of self-governance, and we have an intrinsic\nreason to govern ourselves.  In his view, just as we have a reason not\nto torture, and a reason to care for our children, we have a reason to\ngovern ourselves.  And one’s being instrumentally incoherent on any\nparticular occasion would be a way of failing to govern oneself.  A third approach to instrumental incoherence holds that one need\nnot violate any requirement of reason in being instrumentally\nincoherent.  One version of this view\n(§3.3.1) holds that instrumental coherence\nis to be explained in terms of appropriate responses to\none’s beliefs about independent requirements of reason, where\nthese beliefs could be false.  Another version of this view\n(§3.3.2) holds that instrumental incoherence\nis nothing more than an indicator that one is not functioning well as\nan agent, where this evaluation doesn’t entail any particular\nconclusions about what one ought, or has reason, to do. \nOn this first approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction\nClaims, what one does “wrong” in being instrumentally\ncoherent is violate one’s own judgments about one’s reasons (or fail\nto be attentive enough to form such judgments in the first place), and\nwhat one does “right” in becoming instrumentally coherent\nis respond appropriately to one’s judgments about one’s reasons. Suppose one is instrumentally incoherent.  Plausibly, one is in a \nposition to know this, that one is instrumentally incoherent.  \nPlausibly, one is also in a position to know Ought Pattern 2: the \ngeneral fact that, when one is instrumentally incoherent, there is some \nspecific change that one ought to make.  So, one is in a position to \nknow that there is some specific change that one ought to make.  So, \nplausibly, one ought to give some thought to what this specific change \nis.  In other words, Suppose one arrives at some such belief.  And suppose one revises\none’s attitudes in accordance with that belief.  If one becomes\ninstrumentally coherent in this way, then, even if one\nrevises one’s attitudes in the wrong way (i.e., against reason), one\nstill satisfies: This would explain the Satisfaction Claim. It might be thought that it’s not much of an improvement to explain\nthe requirement to be instrumentally coherent in terms of\nSelf-Monitoring and Krasia, since we are still appealing to a\nrequirement of coherence: namely, Krasia. The only difference is that\nit requires us not to be instrumentally coherent, but instead\nto be kratically coherent: i.e., to follow one’s judgment\nabout one’s reasons.  Indeed, if we thought that it were a\nrequirement of reason to comply with Krasia, then similar\nchallenges to those we discussed\nin §3.2. would reappear, and so it\nwould not be much of an improvement.   But, the view considered here naturally suggests a new strategy: \npresenting a Transparency Account according to which the normativity of \ninstrumental coherence is merely apparent (Kolodny 2005, §5).\nAccording to the Transparency Account of rational requirements in \ngeneral, when we point out to people that rationality requires something\n of them, we aren’t presenting them with some requirement of reason; \nrather, we’re pointing out to them what they already think reason \nrequires of them.  And, so, when we point out to someone that \nrationality requires they be instrumentally coherent with respect to \nsome end, we’re pointing out to them that (on the assumption that \nSelf-Monitoring is satisfied) they already think that reason requires \nsome specific change in their attitudes.  Of course, the instrumentally \nincoherent agent could be mistaken in these thoughts; perhaps he thinks \nreason requires him to intend the means when reason actually requires \nthat he abandon the end instead.  It is this possibility for false \nbelief that restricts us to saying that the normativity of rational \nrequirements is merely apparent.   However, one might challenge whether the Satisfaction Claim is \nadequately explained by an appeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia.  \nSuppose an instrumentally incoherent agent knows that she ought to give \nup her intention to kill her boss, but instead she comes to intend to \npoison the office coffee, which she believes to be a necessary means to \nkilling her boss.  She clearly violates a requirement of reason and she \nclearly violates Krasia, but it still seems that she satisfies some \nrequirement in coming to intend the means to her immoral end.  The \nappeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia can’t explain our thinking that she\n satisfies some requirement in proceeding this way. \nPerhaps a violation of a requirement of instrumental coherence is\nmerely an indicator that an agent is not functioning well in the\nexercise of her rational capacities, where this evaluation doesn’t\nentail that she ought, or has reason, to be instrumentally coherent on\nany particular occasion (see Raz 2005a,b).  In holding this view,\none could also say that there is value in being a properly functioning\nagent, and that this value is explained by the ways in which\nfunctioning properly as a agent tends to bring one into conformity\nwith what reason requires.  But, it doesn’t follow from this that\nthere is value in functioning properly, or that one has any reason to\nfunction properly, in every particular occasion.  (Similar things\ncould be said about the value of having well-functioning perceptual\ncapacities.)  For instance, when one has the unalterable intention to\nkill one’s boss (for more on unalterable ends, see \n Section 1 of\nthe supplementary document \n  Problems for Wide Scoping), \nthere is nothing valuable in one’s\nfunctioning properly, so far as instrumental rationality goes, on that\nparticular occasion, and one would have no reason to do so (see Raz\n2005a, especially pp. 10–13, and Bratman 1987).  But one might worry about how well this account explains the \nViolation and Satisfaction Claims.  On this view, the requirements \nviolated, or satisfied, are simply standards of proper rational \nfunctioning.  These standards can be used to evaluate how well particular \nagents are functioning, in the same way that standards of what makes for\n a well-functioning perceptual apparatus can be used to evaluate how \nwell particular perceivers are functioning.  But, rational requirements \nalso seem to call for some response.  For instance, when we \nadvise others who are in violation of rational requirements, such as \nthose who are instrumentally incoherent, we say that some change in \nattitude is called for.  And, when we ourselves are \ninstrumentally incoherent, we feel some “normative pressure” to \nchange our attitudes in some way (see Kolodny 2005, §4). It’s unclear \nhow these features of rational requirements could be explained by a view\n that takes them to be merely evaluative.   \nA fourth approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction Claims \nargues that the requirement violated, or satisfied, is, or is explained \nby, requirements on belief exclusively.  There are two \ncomponents to this “cognitivist” approach: first, there is some thesis \nabout how intention involves belief, and, second, there is some account \nof how the requirements governing those involved beliefs constitute, or \nexplain, the requirement to be instrumentally coherent.  Here are some candidates for the first component: (Cognitivist accounts developed with Strong, or a variant of it, are \nfound in Harman 1976, 1986; Velleman 1989, 2007; Setiya 2007; Broome\n 2009; and Archer 2018.  Earlier defenses of Strong can be found in Hampshire and Hart \n1958 and Grice 1971.  Wallace 2006 develops a cognitivist account with \nMedium, and Binkley 1965 does so with Weak.) \nLet’s begin with Strong.  Suppose I am instrumentally\nincoherent—that is, I intend to E, believe I\nwill E only if I intend to M, but don’t intend\nto M.  According to Strong, I believe When we pair this with my instrumental belief and apply the theoretical rational requirement we get the result that I am required to believe or drop either (1) or (2).  If I drop (1), I would cease to intend to\n E (according to Strong) and thereby cease to be instrumentally \nincoherent, and if I drop my instrumental belief (2), I would also cease\n to be instrumentally incoherent. But is coming to believe (3) enough to cease to be instrumentally \nincoherent?  What if my belief is false?  There are two options for the \ncognitivist at this point.  The first would be to defend   But we might doubt that we are infallible in our beliefs about our \nown intentions (Bratman 2009b, §4,5).  After all, it seems that we can \nbe mistaken in our beliefs about other attitudes we have (see \nSchwitzgebel 2010, §4). A second option for the cognitivist would be to say that having\n false beliefs about one’s own intentions is possible, but\n theoretically irrational.  (On this option, the cognitivist\n approach to instrumental coherence appeals to two\n theoretical requirements: Closure plus some other requirement not to\n have false beliefs about one’s own intentions.)  However, there is\n usually nothing necessarily incoherent about one’s having\n a false belief.  So, the challenge for cognitivists is to\n explain why, in this particular case, there is.  (This strategy is\n pursued by Setiya 2007, 670–671. For criticism, see Bratman\n 2009a, §4 and Brunero 2009, §2.) Additionally, one might worry that Strong is too strong.  Suppose you\n intend to go shopping on Thursday but don’t believe you intend this and\n instead believe that you intend to go shopping on Friday.  Maybe you’ve\n temporarily forgotten that you’ve recently changed your mind, deciding \nto go on Thursday instead of Friday  (Bratman 2009a, §5).  In this case,\n you might not believe you will go shopping on Thursday.  In light of \nthis example, John Broome (2009, §7) suggests the following  But this wouldn’t help the cognitivist if she aims to account for the\n application of instrumental coherence to all intentions, including \nthose we don’t believe we have (Bratman 2009b, §2).  Additionally, both \nStrong and Variant of Strong seem vulnerable to counterexamples.  \nSuppose I intend, and believe I intend, to carry out a difficult task.  \nKnowing the difficulty involved, I could intend to carry out the task \nbut remain agnostic about whether I will do so.  Here’s another \ncounterexample: suppose I intend to stop by a bookstore on the way home,\n but know that once I’m riding on my bicycle, I tend to go on \n“autopilot.”  Aware of my absentminded tendencies, I might intend to \nstop by the bookstore without believing I will (Bratman 1987, 38–39; \nalso discussed in Holton 2008, §2). Since such intentions make applicable\n a requirement of instrumental coherence, but don’t involve a belief in \nsuccess, the cognitivist cannot explain why requirements of instrumental\n coherence apply to these intentions.  \nNext, let us consider Medium.  Suppose again that I am instrumentally \nincoherent—that is, I intend to E, believe I will E only if I intend to \nM, but don’t intend to M.  By I believe Let us now suppose that the instrumental belief takes this form: If I satisfy Closure, then I believe: However, since I intend to E, then, by Medium, I believe: Thus, in believing (3) and (4), I violate: Thus, if one satisfies Closure, then one violates Belief Consistency (Wallace 2006). One might object to Self-Knowledge, arguing that we aren’t always\naware of what we fail to intend.  One might falsely believe one\nintends the means (Bratman 2009a) or one might simply fail to notice\nthat one hasn’t intended the means (Brunero 2005a).  One response\navailable to the cognitivist would be to say that such lapses in\nself-awareness are possible, but are\ntheoretically irrational.  And so instrumental coherence\nwould be explained by Closure, Belief Consistency, and the requirement\nto be aware of one’s absent intention in this context.  While it\nwouldn’t be plausible to claim that rationality requires, in general,\nawareness of what one does not intend, it might be plausible to say\nthat awareness of what one does not intend is rationally required in\nthis specific context (Wallace 2006, 118).  One might also object that if one is going to be a cognitivist about \npractical requirements in general, one must account for both \ninstrumental coherence and But Medium, on its own, does not seem sufficient to account for \nIntention Consistency.  Such a conflict of intentions would involve the \nfollowing beliefs: But unlike those beliefs involved according to Strong, namely, (5) and (6) are perfectly consistent with one another.  I could \nconsistently believe it’s possible that I not go to the game tonight, and \npossible that I go to the game tonight.  So, we are still in need of an \nexplanation of why I’m rationally required to not both intend not to go \nand intend to go (Bratman 2009b, §3). One might also raise doubts about Medium. Suppose I know I haven’t\nyet investigated whether the stores are closed for the holiday on\nThursday, and so I haven’t yet formed any beliefs about whether I can\ngo shopping then.  Couldn’t I still intend to go shopping on Thursday?\nThat might be irrational or careless planning on my part, but it seems\npossible.  (The example might prove even more convincing if we add the\nfeature of Bratman’s example above: suppose, forgetting about my\nchange of mind, I believe I intend to go shopping on Friday, not on\nThursday.)  Perhaps doubts could even be raised, not just about\nwhether intending to E involves believing E is possible,\nbut also about whether intending to E involves not\nbelieving E is impossible.  Richard Holton (2008), drawing\non Anscombe’s example from Intention (§52) of a man who\nis certain he’ll break down under torture but is determined not to\nbreak down, has argued that one could intend some end while believing\nthat end isn’t a “live possibility.” Such combinations,\nHolton argues, may be irrational, but aren’t impossible.  Next, let us consider Weak.  Suppose again that I am instrumentally \nincoherent—that is, I intend to E, believe I will E only if I intend to \nM, but don’t intend to M.  By Self-Knowledge, I believe: When this belief is paired with the contrapositive of my\ninstrumental belief Closure requires that I believe or cease to believe (1) or (2).  But since I intend to E, it\nfollows, by Weak, that I do not believe (3).  Were I to comply with\nClosure by forming the belief (3), I would, according to Weak, thereby\ncease to intend to E.  In ceasing to believe (2), I would cease\nto be instrumentally incoherent.  And in ceasing to believe (1)\n(which, if Self-Knowledge is true, would mean that it is no longer the\ncase that I do not intend to M) I would also cease to be\ninstrumentally incoherent. Some of the objections mentioned above would also apply to this \naccount.  There is the objection to Self-Knowledge.  And Anscombe’s \nexample, exploited by Holton, also presents a challenge to Weak, since \nthe torture victim intends not to break down but believes that he will. Additionally, one might raise questions concerning the rationality\nof responding to the violation of Closure in this context.\nUsually, if one discovers that one\nbelieves P, P→Q, but does not\nbelieve Q, the rational way to proceed depends upon one’s\nassessment of the relevant reasons for belief (where these are\nevidential, not pragmatic, reasons).  Let us assume, for simplicity,\nthat P→Q is a fixed background belief.  If one\nthinks there are really strong reasons for believing P and not\nstrong reasons for not believing Q, then it would be irrational\nfor one to refuse to believe Q and instead to drop one’s belief\nthat P.  Now, according to this cognitivist account, when I’m\ninstrumentally incoherent, I believe (1) and (2) but not (3).  How\nshould I proceed?  If I currently do not intend to M, and if,\nas Self-Knowledge holds, I’m infallibly aware of what I do not intend,\nthen it seems that the evidence I have for my belief that I do not\nintend to M is really quite strong.  Let’s assume (2) is a\nfixed background belief.  In revising in light of my assessment of the\nevidence, it seems that the revision could only proceed in one\ndirection: by modus ponens, coming to believe I will\nnot E.  It would be irrational for me instead to proceed\nby modus tollens, ceasing to believe that I do not intend\nto M.  So, if we respond to violations of Closure in the usual\nway, we are left with the counterintuitive result that there is only\none way to escape a state of instrumental incoherence: by abandoning\nthe end. Finally, one might also cast doubt on the general cognitivist \nstrategy being employed here, whether it appeals to Weak, Medium, or \nStrong.  Many of the same questions that we’ve raised about instrumental\n incoherence could be raised about rational requirements on belief, \nincluding Belief Consistency and Closure.  There are analogues of the \nViolation and Satisfaction Claims for these rational requirements that \nwould need to be defended and explained.   For example, Joseph Raz \nquestions whether the analogue of the Violation Claim for Belief \nConsistency is even true (see Raz 2005b, §3; Raz 2005a, §5).  If one has\n a set of beliefs that is inconsistent, then at least one of the beliefs\n in that set is false.  But, Raz argues, it does not follow that there \nis any revision in one’s beliefs that one ought to make.  (Reflection on\n logical paradoxes, like the sorities paradox, shows that having an \ninconsistent set of beliefs doesn’t imply that there is any belief in \nthe set that one ought to give up.)  Although Raz objects to the \ncognitivist’s appeal to Belief Consistency in particular, similar \nquestions might be raised about the cognitivist’s appeal to Closure. \nMuch discussion of instrumental rationality has taken place in the\ncontext of a debate about whether instrumental rationality is the only\nkind of practical rationality or, alternatively, there are other\nrequirements of practical rationality as well, such as requirements of\nprudence and morality.  Typically, the former view is called a\n“Humean” one and the latter a “Kantian” one.\nIn this section, we’ll consider some possible understandings of the\nthesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical\nrationality (§4.1), and whether some\nversion of this thesis is given any support by an instrumental\nanalogue of Lewis Carroll’s famous paradox concerning modus\nponens (§4.2).  We’ll also consider\nthe views of Hume (§4.3) and Kant\n(§4.4) on instrumental rationality.\n \nIt is sometimes claimed that instrumental rationality is the only kind of \npractical rationality.  But what exactly is being claimed? Is the claim about rational incoherence?  Then it would seem to be \nthe claim that the only kind of practical, rational incoherence is \ninstrumental incoherence.  But this claim would have to contend with the\n idea that there are other kinds of practical, rational incoherence.  \nFor example, it seems incoherent to refuse to intend what one believes \none ought to intend.  It also seems incoherent to intend to X and to \nintend to Y when one believes that if one Xs, one will not Y. Alternatively, the claim might be about reason: that all\n(practical) reason is, in some sense, instrumental.  On one\ninterpretation, the claim would say that the only true claim about\nreason is some principle of instrumental transmission.  But this\nwould seem to imply that there are no practical reasons at all.\nUnless there is some other true claim about reasons for\n“ends” understood as actions, there is nothing to be\ntransmitted.  (For arguments that there would need to be another kind\nof rationality, see Korsgaard 1997; Lavin 2004; Hubin 1999; Nozick\n1993; Hampton 1998.) A different interpretation is that all reasons are instrumental.\n  In other words, the reason for any action (or intention) can be \nexpressed as: the action will help to bring about some “end,” where \n“end” is understood not as an action, but instead as some valuable or \ndesired state of affairs.  The Desire-Based Theory is committed to this \nclaim.  But not all Value-Based Theories are.  The reason for an action,\n for example, might be that it honors or respects something of value, \neven though it does not help to bring it about. A final interpretation is that all deliberation is of\nmeans.  In other words, there is no place for significant\nevaluative or normative reflection on the ultimate ends that one has\nreason to bring about.  The Desire-Based Theory seems committed to\nthis claim, at least to some extent.  According to the Desire-Based\nTheory, reflection on the ultimate ends that one has reason to bring\nabout is just reflection on the non-normative matter of what one in\nfact desires, plus grasp of the Desire-Based Theory itself.  On the\nother hand, Value-Based theories seem committed to rejecting this\nclaim, even those Value-Based Theories that accept that all reasons\nare instrumental in the sense discussed in the previous paragraph.\nFor whether a certain state of affairs is valuable, and so an end that\none has reason to bring about, is itself the object of significant\nevaluative thought.  (Note that it is a mistake to express the present\nidea, that all deliberation is of means, as the idea that one cannot\nbe criticized for ends.  According to the Desire-Based\nTheory, one can be criticized for what one intends\nor acts to bring about, insofar as it is not the realization\nof one’s strongest, present intrinsic desires.  And even according to\nValue-Based theories, one cannot be criticized for what one\nhas reason to bring about.) Notice that the Desire-Based Theory is committed to the claim that \npractical reason is exclusively instrumental, on these two last \ninterpretations.  This may explain why the Desire-Based Theory is often \nsimply identified with “instrumental rationality,” and why the claim \nthat “the only kind of practical rationality is instrumental \nrationality” is sometimes just meant as an assertion of the Desire-Based\n Theory. Lewis Carroll (1895) introduced a famous paradox concerning modus ponens.\n  Some philosophers have argued that an instrumental analogue of this \nparadox shows there to be something special about instrumental \nrationality, and perhaps even provides support for some version of the \nthesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical \nrationality. Carroll imagined a conversation between Achilles and a Tortoise\nregarding the following valid argument:  Therefore, The Tortoise adopts a skeptical position, asking how he can be \nlogically forced into accepting (Z) when he accepts (A) and (B).  Achilles \nattempts to supply him with the missing premise: But the Tortoise grants (C), and resumes his skepticism, asking how\nhe can be logically forced to accept (Z) when he accepts (A), (B), and\n(C).  It soon dawns on Achilles that the mere addition of further\npremises (like “If (A), (B), and (C) are true, (Z) must be\ntrue”, and so on) won’t help resolve the Tortoise’s skepticism.\nOne could keep on adding such premises ad infinitum and yet\nnot get the Tortoise to accept (Z). Much has been written about what lessons to draw from Carroll’s\nparadox, but this much seems clear: the Tortoise refuses to accept (Z)\nbecause he refuses to apply modus ponens to the premises he\naccepts.  So, if modus ponens itself is merely\naccepted by him as yet another premise, that won’t suffice to get him\nto accept (Z). Now, imagine we confront someone who holds some end E,\nbelieves some means M is necessary for E-ing, yet\ndoesn’t intend to M, and, like the Tortoise, doesn’t intend\nto M because he refuses to apply instrumental\nrationality to the ends he has, including E.  If we suggest\nthat he remedy this defect by adopting yet another end (namely, the\nend of doing what instrumental rationality requires), this wouldn’t\nhelp matters.  Since his problem is that he doesn’t apply instrumental\nrationality to the ends he has, he wouldn’t apply instrumental\nrationality to this new end as well, and so still wouldn’t intend\nto M (or drop the intention to E).  So, the mere\naddition of instrumental rationality as another end would be\nfutile. What should we conclude from this instrumental analogue of\nCarroll’s paradox?  Railton (1997) argues that it shows that a certain\nform of skepticism about rationality—specifically, one’s asking\n“Why should I comply with the norms of practical\nrationality?”—can be answered.  First, the asking of this\nskeptical question reveals a commitment to at least instrumental\nrationality, since one is here questioning whether being practically\nrational would advance one’s ends.  And, second, the\ninstrumental analogue of Carroll’s paradox shows that we can’t think\nof this commitment to instrumental rationality as merely another end\nthe agent accepts and could dismiss at will.  If the skeptic thinks it\nis, Railton suggests that “we can answer ‘No, on pain of\nregress, it cannot be just another end of yours’”\n(p. 317). However, it’s not clear why the skeptic would have to think of\ninstrumental rationality as just another end she has.  Couldn’t she\nthink of it instead as (or also as) a disposition that she manifests,\nor a capacity that she exercises, with respect to the ends that she\naccepts?  (If so, she would avoid the particular problem that\nconfronts the character in the instrumental analogue of Carroll’s\nparadox, who merely accepts instrumental rationality as another end\nwithout applying it to her ends.)  And then couldn’t she\nrequest some philosophical explanation of why she should exercise that\ncapacity?  That she already has the capacity is of course no barrier\nto posing such a question (Wedgwood 2005).  Indeed, as we’ve seen\nin §3.3, some philosophers\nhave denied that we always ought, or have reason, to be\ninstrumentally coherent; they’ve argued that rational requirements are\nonly apparently normative, or are merely evaluative. Dreier (2001) concludes that the instrumental analogue of Carroll’s\nparadox shows that instrumental rationality has a special status.  In\nCarroll’s original paradox, the Tortoise would be such that we\ncouldn’t give him reasons to believe in some proposition.  In the\nnormal case, I can provide you with a reason to believe Q by\ngetting you to believe P and to believe P→Q.  But\nthis simply won’t work for the Tortoise, who refuses to\napply modus ponens.  Likewise, Dreier observes, we would be\nincapable of giving reasons to someone who refused to draw\n“practical inferences” between ends and means.  The\nacceptance of instrumental rationality is thus, he argues, a necessary\ncondition for being receptive to reasons at all.  And this supports\nhis conclusion that “the only ultimate sort of reasons are\ninstrumental reasons” (p.  43).  This seems to be an endorsement\nof the Desire-Based Theory.  Does the conclusion follow?  Even if a disposition to be\ninstrumentally rational is indispensable in the way Dreier suggests\nto having a practical reason, nothing follows\nabout what one has practical reason to do.  Additionally,\nit’s worth noting that it’s doubtful that Carroll’s original paradox\nwould license a restriction on the scope of theoretical\nreasons analogous to the Humean restriction on the scope of practical\nreasons that Dreier thinks the instrumental analogue of Carroll’s\nparadox supports.  That is, it is not obvious that I have reason to\nbelieve Q only if I am disposed come to believe it by\napplying modus ponens.  Perhaps my merely believing, with\nreason, both P and P→Q provides me with a reason\nfor believing Q.  Or perhaps the mere fact the available\nevidence supports Q is enough (Jollimore 2005). Korsgaard (2009) argues that we can draw a conclusion about\nthe metaethical status of instrumental rationality by\nconsidering an instrumental analogue of Carroll’s paradox.\nSpecifically, she appeals to it to argue against metaethical realism\nabout instrumental rationality (and about other normative principles\nas well).  Let’s suppose that there is a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent.  A realist would claim that there is some\nnormative fact, according to which we ought to be instrumentally\ncoherent.  But a skeptic might ask, “Why ought I apply that\nfact—that I ought to be instrumentally coherent—to my\nactions?” The realist might answer, “Because—and\nhere’s another normative fact—it just is the case that you ought\nto apply the fact that you ought to be instrumentally coherent to your\nactions.” But one might resume one’s skepticism and ask why one\nmust apply that normative fact to one’s actions.  One could\nkeep adding normative facts ad infinitum without providing an\nanswer to the question, in the same way that Achilles could keep\nadding premises without meeting the Tortoise’s challenge.   A full discussion of the metaethical issues raised by this argument \nwould take us too far afield  (see Parfit 2006). But one strategy of \nreply is to argue that the realist has already answered the question.  \nWhat it is for such normative facts to be normative just is \nthat they require that you act in some way.  If you’re asking of \nnormative facts in general why you should act in accordance with them, \nthen you don’t fully understand what normative facts are. The thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of\npractical rationality is often taken to be a “Humean”\nthesis, though, as we’ve seen (§4.1),\nthere are several ways in which this thesis could be understood.  One\ncould take the thesis just to be an assertion of the Desire-Based\nTheory.  One could also take the thesis to specify that instrumental\ncoherence is the only requirement of practical rationality.  However,\nit is doubtful that Hume held either of these views.   There are some passages which might seem to suggest these views.\nIn Book II of the Treatise (1739–40), Hume denies that\na person’s ends, however immoral or imprudent, can be unreasonable\n(“contrary to reason,” to use his exact phrase) if they’re\nnot based on a false belief: Here he seems to claim that one’s choosing means insufficient for \none’s end can be deemed unreasonable, even though the end itself is not \nsubject to such rational assessment.  However, this wouldn’t support the Desire-Based Theory, since the\nDesire-Based Theory allows that ends can be unreasonable when they\ndon’t promote the satisfaction of one’s strongest, present intrinsic\ndesires.  For instance, choosing one’s total ruin, when doing so runs\ncounter to one’s strongest, present intrinsic desires, even when doing\nso isn’t based on a false belief, can be criticized as unreasonable on\nthe Desire-Based Theory. Soon after this passage, Hume is careful to note that it wouldn’t\nbe one’s intending of means insufficient for one’s ends\nthat’s unreasonable, but the false belief on which this\nintention is based.  For example, when I falsely believe that staying\non 95N will get me to Memphis, which is where I intend to go, and so I\nintend to stay on 95N, it’s my belief that 95N will get me to Memphis\nthat’s unreasonable, not the intention, based on this belief, to stay\non 95N. Why did Hume think this?  Hume holds that “reason is the\ndiscovery of truth and falsehood” (p. 458).  Since beliefs aim\nto correctly represent the world—and the beliefs that succeed in\nrepresenting the world are true, while the beliefs that fail to do so\nare false—they can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable.\nBut passions, as well as intentions and actions, are “original\nexistences.” They don’t purport to represent or\n“copy” some other “existence” (p. 415).\nSpecifically, they don’t aim to correctly represent the world, and so\nthey can’t be true or false.  Hence, they can’t be assessed as\nreasonable or unreasonable.  In light of such considerations, many philosophers have argued that\nHume doesn’t endorse an instrumentalist conception of practical\nreason, but instead, more radically, is a skeptic about all of\npractical reason.  (See, for instance, Hampton 1995; Millgram 1995;\nKorsgaard 1997.  For objections to this skeptical interpretation of\nHume, see Setiya 2004.)  On this interpretation, Hume acknowledges the\nexistence of requirements of theoretical reason, since\nbeliefs can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable, but is\nskeptical about the existence of requirements of practical\nreason, including instrumental reason, since desires, intentions, and\nactions can’t be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable.  (Even a\npreference for “one’s own acknowledg’d lesser good”\nwouldn’t be unreasonable, on his view.)  Since, on this\ninterpretation, Hume was skeptical about practical reason in\ngeneral, we can’t appeal to his view to establish a special place\nfor instrumental rationality among the requirements of practical\nrationality.  Various challenges could be raised against Hume’s rather narrow \nconception of reason.  But our primary interest here is in whether Hume \ncan provide us with a plausible account of instrumental rationality.\n On Hume’s view, our intentions are subject to rational criticism when, \nand only when, they are based on false beliefs (and, again, it’s the \nbelief that’s to blame, strictly speaking).  As an account of \ninstrumental rationality, Hume’s view would face two serious objections. First, it seems that one can be instrumentally irrational without\nhaving any intentions based on false beliefs (or lacking any\nintentions because of false beliefs).  John Broome provides an\nexample: suppose I know the hotel is on fire and that the only escape\ninvolves my intending to go through the open window, and, though I\nintend to live, I sit on the windowsill singing happily until the\nflames consume me.  This is a clear case of instrumental\nirrationality, despite my not having any false beliefs (Broome 1997).\nIndeed, one could fail to intend the means believed necessary for\none’s ends because of rage, depression, distraction, grief, or other\ncauses which don’t necessarily involve any false beliefs (Korsgaard\n1986).  Hume would have to conclude either that such cases are\nimpossible, or that they involve no instrumental irrationality. Second, it seems that one can have intentions based on false\nbeliefs without being instrumentally irrational, or irrational in any\nother way.  Instrumental rationality, as it’s usually understood, is a\nrequirement of coherence governing one’s intentions and\nbeliefs—a requirement that is in place regardless of\nthe truth of those beliefs.  The person who intends to get to\nMemphis, believes that he must intend to stay on 95N to get there, and\ndoes intend to stay on 95N, displays coherence in his attitudes,\ndespite having a false belief.  So, an accusation of instrumental\nirrationality here would be misplaced. (Additionally, it would also be\ninappropriate to accuse him of any theoretical irrationality,\nif we suppose that this belief isn’t inconsistent with any other\nbeliefs he holds, and he also believes there’s conclusive evidence for\nit, and so forth.)  Hume would have to conclude either that such cases\nare impossible, or that they involve instrumental irrationality.  \nAn alternative to the narrow instrumentalism associated with Hume is \nfound in the work of Immanuel Kant, who thought that rationality \nrequired us not only to be instrumentally rational, but also to obey the\n moral law.  In his Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (1785),  \nKant distinguishes two kinds of imperatives: For example, “If you intend to go to law school, take the\nLSAT” would be a hypothetical imperative since it commands an\naction (taking the LSAT) as a means to some end (going to law school).\nIf you didn’t have any ends that would be served by taking the LSAT,\nthe command for you to do so would be withdrawn.  Categorical\nimperatives, such as “If someone is drowning nearby, offer\nassistance,” differ in two ways.  First, the command to offer\nassistance applies to you regardless of whether offering assistance\nserves any of your (desired or intended) ends.  Second, you have a\nreason to offer assistance regardless of whether doing so serves any\nof your (desired or intended) ends.  (Philippa Foot has argued that\nthis second feature doesn’t follow from the first: a rule of\netiquette, or a club rule, may apply to you regardless of whether\ncompliance with it serves any of your ends, but you may nonetheless\nhave no reason to comply with it. See Foot 1972.)  By “one wants” in the passage above, Kant means\n“one wills”: something closer to “one intends”\nthan “one desires.” (After all, it wouldn’t be plausible\nto suggest that one is instrumentally irrational in not intending the\nnecessary means to what one merely wants.  I want to own a\nBMW, but I don’t intend to work the kind of job that would allow me to\nbuy one.  But there’s nothing incoherent about my continuing to desire\nto own one.)  According to Kant: But if Kant’s view is to provide a plausible account of\ninstrumental coherence, it should instead refer to the\nmeans believed to be indispensably necessary, since there is\nnothing incoherent about not willing necessary means of which you are\nunaware, and something incoherent about not willing the means you\nbelieve are necessary, even when they actually aren’t (Korsgaard\n1997, 236).  Kant’s parenthetical remark in the passage above is important.  For\nKant, when one fails to will the necessary means to one’s ends, then\nreason has failed to have decisive influence.  In other words, one is\nirrationally incoherent.  Less guardedly, Kant says “the\nproposition (if I fully will the effect, then I will the action\nrequired of it) is analytic” (4:417).  But it is puzzling how\nthis proposition could be analytic.  If it were analytic, then it\nwould be conceptually impossible to be instrumentally\nincoherent since whenever one doesn’t will the means, then one doesn’t\nwill the end.  (For a defense of this conceptual impossibility, see\nFinlay 2009.)  And if it’s conceptually impossible to be\ninstrumentally incoherent, we’d be unable to make sense of why Kant\nformulates his account of instrumental incoherence in terms\nof imperatives, which, on Kant’s view, are commands addressed\nto a will that is capable of both following and not following the\ncommands (Kant 4:414; Hill 1973, 430; Korsgaard 1997, 236).  So,\nperhaps we should read Kant’s claim as that if one wills the\nend, rationality requires that one will the means.  (For an\nalternative reading, see Lee 2018.) Even so, there is a debate over the interpretation of Kant’s claim,\nparticularly about the logical scope of “requires.”\nAccording to the wide-scope interpretation of Kant’s claim, what\nreason requires is that one either will the means or\nnot will the end.  In contrast, according the narrow-scope\ninterpretation of Kant’s claim, if one wills the end, then what reason\nrequires is that one will the means.  The wide-scope\ninterpretation posits a disjunctive requirement (that one either not\nwill the end or will the means) that, like Kant’s categorical\nimperative, applies to every rational agent, regardless of\nthe particular ends she wills.  But it’s hard to square the existence\nof such a universally applicable requirement with some other claims\nKant makes about how hypothetical imperatives are to be distinguished\nfrom categorical ones, and how hypothetical imperatives could be\nderived from an analysis of the concept of willing an end. (See Schroeder\n2005b.  For a defense of the wide-scope interpretation against Schroeder’s objections, see Rippon 2014. For a related discussion of these issues, see Schwartz\n2008.)   But the narrow-scope interpretation appears to leave Kant’s view \nvulnerable to “detachment” objections.  Suppose you will some immoral \nend but, irrationally, don’t will the immoral means you believe \nnecessary to carry out this immoral end.  On the narrow-scope \ninterpretation, reason would require that you will the immoral means.  \nBut that seems implausible.  At the very least, it would lead to \nsomething Kant wouldn’t accept: reason issuing contradictory commands.  \nYour willing the immoral means would be required by a hypothetical \nimperative but forbidden by the categorical imperative (Hill 1973, 436). Kant could avoid the detachment problem if he holds, as some\ninterpreters claim, that it is impossible to will (Wille)\nimmoral ends (Schroeder 2005b, §3).  If this interpretation is\nright, then reason would never require one to will immoral means.  But\nit would also leave Kant without an account of instrumental\nincoherence, at least as we have been understanding it.  After all,\nagents can display instrumental incoherence in the pursuit\nof both moral and immoral ends.  To use Kant’s own examples,\nthe doctor who doesn’t intend the means believed necessary to making\nhis patient healthy is instrumentally incoherent in the same way as is\nthe poisoner who doesn’t intend the means believed necessary to kill\nhis victim (4:415).  So, this interpretation would have Kant avoiding\nthe detachment objection, but at the cost of no longer presenting an\naccount of instrumental incoherence that holds regardless of whether\nthe end is reasonable or good.   Let’s now turn to Kant’s explanation of the normative authority of \nhypothetical imperatives.  While Kant presents a complicated and \nintricate argument to explain the normative authority of the categorical\n imperative, he claims that hypothetical imperatives require “no special\n discussion,” and spends comparatively little time discussing them \n(4:417).  Kant’s approach here—which might seem to play into the hands of\n instrumentalists (see §4.1 above) who, while \nskeptical of the rational authority of the categorical imperative, \nfollow Kant in thinking that the authority of hypothetical imperatives \nis obvious and unproblematic—has been challenged.  Although the “ought” \nof a hypothetical imperative is contingent on an agent’s ends, that \n“ought” still needs to be explained.  Additionally, it’s not clear that a\n hypothetical “ought” is any more compatible with a naturalistic \nworldview than a categorical one.  Specifically, some of the same \nmetaethical challenges that have been raised about the status of the \ncategorical “ought” could be raised about normative claims in general, \nincluding the hypothetical “ought”  (Hampton 1998, Ch. 4; Shafer-Landau\n 2006, §6). So, what is Kant’s explanation of the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives?  According to Korsgaard (1997), Kant’s views\nchanged over the course of his philosophical development.  Kant’s\nearly “dogmatic rationalist” view (evident in\nthe Groundwork) held that we should comply with these\nhypothetical imperatives simply because they express what a perfectly\nrational agent would do.  But the mature Kantian view—which\nKorsgaard endorses—explains the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives in terms of the commitments that are\nconstitutive of willing.  According to this view, what’s involved\nin willing some end (as opposed to merely desiring it) is\nbeing committed to taking the means to that end.  It’s not\nthat complying with this commitment is constitutive of\nintention (this would render instrumental irrationality conceptually\nimpossible) but that having this commitment is constitutive\nof intention.  So, when one is instrumentally irrational, one fails to\nlive up to one’s own commitments.  Korsgaard writes: But is Korsgaard right that willing an end necessarily\ninvolves prescribing that end to yourself?  Korsgaard argues\nthat to will some end, you must at least take that end to be good in\nsome sense, and you must also think that there is a reason for\npursuing that end (246, 250–1).  But it seems possible for one\nto have some akratic end while failing to see anything even pro\ntanto good about it, or any reason to pursue it (Wallace 2006,\n§1).  And it’s clear that one could display instrumental\nrationality or irrationality relative to these akratic ends.  So,\nKorsgaard’s view seems unable to explain the authority of instrumental\nrationality with respect to such ends—ends that an\nagent has but doesn’t prescribe to herself. Korsgaard offers a second Kantian explanation of the authority of \ninstrumental rationality.  She argues that incessant instrumental \nirrationality threatens one’s status as an agent: But this argument doesn’t provide a reason to conform to the\ninstrumental principle in every case in which the instrumental\nprinciple is applicable.  Rather, it provides a reason to do so only\nwhen accompanied by enough other instances of non-conformity to\nthreaten one’s status as an agent (Kolodny 2005, 544; Shaver 2006,\n342). So, like the previous Kantian argument, and like the Hume’s\nskepticism discussed in §4.3, this argument\nalso fails to explain why instrumental rationality applies in every\ncase in which it does.","contact.mail":"kolodny@berkeley.edu","contact.domain":"berkeley.edu"},{"date.published":"2013-02-13","date.changed":"2018-11-02","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/","author1":"Niko Kolodny","author2":"John Brunero","author1.info":"http://sophos.berkeley.edu/kolodny","entry":"rationality-instrumental","body.text":"\n\n\n\nSomeone displays instrumental rationality insofar as she adopts\nsuitable means to her ends.  Instrumental rationality, by virtually\nany reckoning, is an important, and presumably indispensable, part of\npractical rationality.  However, philosophers have been interested in\nit for further reasons.  To take one example, it has been suggested\nthat instrumental rationality, or some tendency toward it, is partly\nconstitutive of intention, desire, or action. To take another, more\nimportant, example, it has been argued that instrumental rationality\nis not only a part, but a special part, or even the whole, of\npractical rationality.  This thesis appears to threaten the\n“rational authority” of morality.  It seems possible that\nacting morally on some occasion might not be a suitable means to an\nagent’s ends.  If so, then according to this thesis, it would\nnot be irrational for her to refuse to act morally on such an\noccasion. \n\nWe should note two restrictions on the scope of this article.\nFirst, this article focuses on contemporary discussions of the\nsubject, apart from some brief discussions of Hume and Kant.  Notable\nomissions, for example, are Aristotle’s discussion of the practical\nsyllogism and his claim that deliberation is of means (Nicomachean\nEthics, Book III, Chapter 3). \n\nSecond, this article doesn’t focus on decision theory, which some may\n view as containing, or just being, a theory of instrumental \nrationality: what means to take to achieve certain ends (the \nsatisfaction of preferences, or the realization of valuable states of \naffairs) given credences, or beliefs, or information, about the \nprobabilities that various means will achieve those ends.\n\nIn this article, we begin (§1) by noting a\ndistinction that frames the discussion that follows: very roughly, a\ndistinction between the question of whether some attitude is such that\nan agent ought, or (more weakly) has reason, to have it, and the\nquestion of whether that attitude rationally coheres with her other\nattitudes. We first (§2) discuss the importance\nof means-end relations for what one ought, or has reason, to intend:\nspecifically, for how reasons for ends “transmit” to\nreasons for means. We then (§3) discuss\ninstrumental rationality understood as a norm of rational\ncoherence. Lastly, we consider (§4) the\n“Humean” thesis that instrumental rationality is the only\nkind of practical rationality.\n\nSomeone displays instrumentally rationality insofar as she adopts\nsuitable means to her ends.  But how should “rationality”\nbe understood?  Here it is important to distinguish between two things\nthat the casually phrased question, “What would it be rational\nfor an agent to do or intend?” could mean: As with any philosophical distinction, this contrast between\n“rational coherence” and “reason” might be\nquestioned.  But it is accepted by many of the authors who have\nwritten on the subject, and it will help to organize the discussion of\nthe subject matter. In principle, the answers to these questions might perfectly \ncoincide: that what agents have reason, or ought, to do just is what it \nwould be rationally coherent for them to do, and vice versa.  In several\n ways, however, the answers might be expected to diverge. \nFirst, even if what one ought to do is just to make one’s\nresponses globally coherent, what it takes to make one’s\nresponses locally coherent might differ from what it takes to\nmake them globally coherent.  According to the Subjective Desire-Based\nTheory, for example, what agents have reason, or ought, to do or\nintend is just what, given what they believe their circumstances to\nbe, would best satisfy their strongest, present intrinsic desires\ntaken as a whole.  Suppose that the agent’s strongest, present\nintrinsic desire is for health.  Nevertheless, out of habit, he\nintends to have a smoke, believing that lighting up is a necessary\nmeans.  According to the Subjective Desire-Based Theory, it is not the\ncase that he ought to intend to light up.  And it might be said that\nif he were globally coherent, the agent would not intend to light up.\nBut if he does form an intention to light up, he at least achieves a\nkind of local coherence. Second, what the agent has reason, or ought, to do or intend may\ndepend not on what she believes her circumstances to be, but\non something more “objective.” There are several\npossibilities.  What an agent has reason, or ought, to do, might be\nwhat the evidence (where this depends on something other than her\nattitudes) available to the agent suggests about her circumstances,\nwhat the evidence of the person making the reason- or ought-claim\nsuggests about the agent’s circumstances, what the evidence of the\nperson assessing the claim suggests about the agent’s circumstances,\nor all of the relevant facts about the agent’s circumstances.\nConsider the Objective Desire-Based Theory, which says that agents\nhave reason, or ought, to do or intend just what, given what their\ncircumstances actually are, would best satisfy their strongest,\npresent intrinsic desires taken as a whole.  Suppose the agent’s\nstrongest, present intrinsic desire is to drink a gin and tonic, and\nshe so intends.  However, she mistakenly believes that the stuff in\nthis bottle is gin, when it is in fact petrol.  So she believes that\nmixing the stuff with tonic is a means to drinking a gin and tonic.\nAccording to the Objective Desire-Based Theory, she does not have\nreason to intend to mix the stuff with tonic and drink it.  But if she\ndoes so intend, she might be said to have achieved a kind of rational\ncoherence, both local and global. Third, one might hold not a Desire-Based Theory, but a Value-Based\nTheory, according to which whatever ultimate ends an agent\nhas reason, or ought, to achieve depend not on what\nshe desires or wills, but instead on what is of\nindependent value.  Suppose the madman’s strongest, present intrinsic\ndesire is to set off a nuclear war, and he so intends.  Moreover, the\nmadman knows that intending to press this button is a necessary and\nsufficient means to setting off a nuclear war.  It might be said that,\nin intending to press this button, the madman would achieve a kind of\ncoherence, both local and global.  And according to the Desire-Based\nTheories, the madman ought so to intend.  According to a Value-Based\nTheory, however, it presumably is not the case that he ought so to\nintend. There are several reasons, therefore, to expect at least some \ndivergence between what one has reason, or ought, to do or intend, and \nwhat it would be rationally coherent for one to do or intend.  But that \nis perfectly compatible with partial convergence, even of a \nnon-accidental character.  As we will discuss below, some suggest that \namong the things that agents have reason, or ought, to do or intend is \nprecisely to make their responses rationally coherent.  Just as we ought\n not to torture, or ought to care for our children, we ought to be \nrationally coherent. We’ll begin by discussing how means-end relations matter for what\none ought, or has reason, to do or intend. (For an opinionated survey,\nsee Kolodny 2018.) But we should first consider how\n“means” is understood. While “means” are often\ntaken to be tools or resources, for our purposes, we will view means\nas actions, intentions, choices, decisions, etc. that might make use\nof such tools or resources.  It is natural to think of means to an\nend, so understood, as actions that help to cause the end to\noccur. But often philosophers count as means to an end whatever may\nhelp to bring it about. M may bring about E by causing\nit, as flicking this switch causes the illumination of this room,\nbut M may also bring about E by helping to constitute\nit, as playing this measure partially constitutes the playing of this\nsonata, or fulfilling preconditions for it, as registering for this\nconference fulfills preconditions for attending it, or preventing\nthings that might prevent it, as vaccination prevents disease that\nmight prevent successful completion of the school year. Means are also\noften probabilistic.  Something may also count as a means to an end\neven if it is not guaranteed to help to bring about the end, but only\nhas some chance of doing so.  Usage of “end” is also often\nambiguous.  Sometimes “end” is used to refer to\nan action, such as the action of illuminating this room.  But\nsometimes “end” is used to refer to a state of\naffairs that is either desired or valuable, such as the state of\naffairs of this room’s being illuminated. We’ll here use\n“end” to refer to an action. Reasons for action are often said to “transmit” from ends to means, \nin the sense that if there is reason for an end, then, because of this, \nthere is reason for the means. This idea is captured in Joseph Raz’s \nFacilitative Principle:\n \n [w]hen we have an undefeated reason to take an \naction, we have reason to perform any one (but only one) of the possible\n (for us) alternative plans that facilitate its performance. (Raz \n2005b) \n \n Insofar as what one ought to do depends on what one has reason \nto do, one might expect a similar transmission of “ought” from end to \nmeans.  If one ought to achieve an end, then one ought to take the \nmeans, or at least means of certain kinds. Principles of instrumental transmission of this kind are compatible \nwith different views about what ends we have reason to achieve.  For \nexample, it may be accepted by either a Desire-Based, or a Value-Based, \nTheory. What the correct principle, or principles, of instrumental\ntransmission are is controversial.  Most commonly, principles describe\ntransmission to necessary means.  However, some speak of sufficient\nmeans, and others speak of neither.  For example, Raz’s Facilitative\nPrinciple speaks of “facilitating plans.” Some\ntransmission principles say that “oughts” transmit from\nend to means, others say that the full force of the reason for the end\ntransmits to the means, others say that the strength of the reason for\nthe end that transmits to the means is proportional to other factors,\nand others, like Raz’s Facilitative Principle, say only that some\nreason for the end transmits to the means. To illustrate the problems facing an account of instrumental \ntransmission, it may be useful to work with some very simple principles,\n which lack many of the qualifications and nuances of Raz’s Facilitative\n Principle and other principles discussed in the literature: There are several problems that principles of instrumental\ntransmission need to avoid.  First, means to an end can\nbe costly, or otherwise objectionable.  Suppose that I ought\nto take a job in Alaska.  One (sufficient) means is to fly there;\nanother (sufficient) means is to take free passage on a merchant ship.\nBut flying costs more than I would earn there.  Presumably, I ought\nnot fly.  It may be said that I have some reason to fly, but that it\nis outweighed.  This is an argument against Ought Sufficiency.   However, with other kinds of costs, or objectionable features, it\nmay sound wrong to say even that one has reason for the means.\nSuppose I have reason to alleviate pangs of hunger.  One sufficient\nmeans to this is eating a sandwich; another sufficient means is\nkilling myself  (Broome 2005b). Some will resist the conclusion that I\nhave any reason at all to kill myself.  This is an argument against\nStrong Reasons Sufficiency and Weak Reasons Sufficiency.  Or suppose I\nhave reason to improve college policy.  But a necessary means to this\nis to kill the old don who resists any change (because unanimous\napproval is required).  Some will resist the conclusion that I have\nany reason at all to kill the don. This is an argument against Strong\nReasons Necessity and Weak Reasons Necessity.  However, it may not be\nan argument against Ought Necessity.  It may be said that the fact\nthat improving policy requires killing the don is itself a strong\nreason against improving policy, in light of which it is not true that\none ought to improve it.  In that case, Ought Necessity does not imply\nthat one ought to kill the don, which seems intuitive. In any event,\nthe force of the intuition on which the argument rests may be\nresisted.  Granted, it sounds odd to say that one has reason to kill\noneself.  But this may have a pragmatic explanation.  Why bother to\nidentify any reason to kill oneself when it is vastly outweighed by\nthe reasons against doing so?  (Raz 2005a; Schroeder 2005a, 2007). Second, problems arise from repeated applications of\ntransmission principles.  For one thing, means to means to an\nend may actually undermine the end.  Suppose, to take an example of\nRyan Millsap’s (2009a—see the Other Internet Resources), Kenny\nhas reason to bake both a loaf of bread and a cake for a display on\nMarie Antoinette.  A (necessary) means to that end is baking a loaf of\nbread.  Plausibly, he has reason to bake a loaf of bread.  A\n(sufficient) means to that means is baking a giant loaf,\nwhich uses all of the flour.  But that would prevent him from baking a\ncake, and so prevent him from achieving the end.  So, presumably, he\ndoes not have reason to bake a giant loaf, even though it is a means\nto something that he has reason to do.  For another thing, if we\naccept both Weak Reasons Necessity and Weak Reasons Sufficiency, then\nrepeated applications of these principles may imply that if there is\nreason for something, then there is reason for everything.  Suppose\nthere is reason to E, and let F be anything.\nIf E-ing or F-ing is a necessary means to E-ing,\nand if F-ing is a sufficient means to E-ing\nor F-ing, then, repeated application of those principles\nimplies that there is reason to F (Millsap 2009b—see the\nOther Internet Resources). Note that similar problems arise if we\naccept both Ought Necessity and Ought Sufficiency. Third, a means to an end might have a very low probability \nof helping to bring that end about.  Suppose, to take an example from \nJackson and Pargetter 1986, Professor Procrastinate has been asked to \nreview a book, which he both ought, and has reason, to do.  A \n(necessary) means to reviewing it is accepting the commission to review \nit.  However, even if he accepts the commission, he is very unlikely to \nreview it.  Professor Dispatch, in a parallel universe, is in the same \nsituation, except that he is very likely to review it if he accepts.  \nPerhaps Procrastinate, like Dispatch, has some reason to review it.  But\n Procrastinate may not have as much reason as Dispatch to accept; not \nall of the reason for the end may be transmitted to this (necessary) \nmeans.  And it may not be the case that Procrastinate ought to accept.  \nThis is an argument against Strong Reasons Necessity and Ought \nNecessity, since even if one takes a necessary means, there may still be\n a low probability of helping to bring that end about. However, it is \nnot an argument against the Sufficiency principles, assuming that \nsufficient means, if taken, are sure to help to bring the end about. Nevertheless—this is the fourth and final\nproblem—sufficient means may be superfluous to an end,\nwhere this means something like that, even if those means were\nomitted, the end would still be achieved.  Suppose that Drug 1 is a\nsufficient means to relieving the patient’s pain.  A doctor is sure to\ngive Drug 1.  Giving Drug 2, in addition, would at first neutralize\nthe effect of Drug 1, but then recombine with it to produce a third\ndrug, which will relieve the patient’s pain.  Giving Drug 2 would be\nsuperfluous to relieving the patient’s pain, although it would help to\nbring it about, by being part of the cause of the relief of the\npatient’s pain.  Does the doctor then also have any reason to give\nDrug 2?  At first, one might be tempted to say that the doctor does\nindeed have reason to give Drug 2, but that this reason is outweighed\nby the cost of giving Drug 2.  But observe that no matter how low we\nmake that cost, it still outweighs any reason to give it.  This\nsuggests that there is no reason at all to give it. Note that\nnecessary means cannot be superfluous, since if necessary means were\nleft out, the end would not be achieved. \nNow we consider instrumental rationality understood as a matter of\nrational coherence.  It is often said that someone is being locally\ninstrumentally incoherent insofar as he intends an end, believes,\nroughly, that something is a means to it, but refuses to intend that\nmeans.  More precisely, it seems that this is so only when the\nrelevant belief is about necessary means.  Suppose that I\nintend to go to Alaska, but believe that flying there is a sufficient,\nbut not necessary, means to going to Alaska.  Am I being\ninstrumentally incoherent in refusing to intend to fly there?  Not\nobviously: perhaps I believe that going by sea is cheaper, and I\nintend that. Some suggest that this focus, on intentions and beliefs about\nnecessary means, inspired by Kant’s initial discussion of\nhypothetical imperatives (see §4.4 below), is\noverly narrow  (see Smith 2004 and Wedgwood 2011).  Not simply\nintentions, but also desires, should be considered, and not simply\nbeliefs about necessary means, but also beliefs about non-necessary\nmeans should be considered. More precisely still, the relevant belief must be\nthat intending the means is itself necessary.  Suppose your\ndentist intends to remove your tooth, and believes that a necessary\nmeans to removing your tooth is causing you pain.  Is she being\ninstrumentally incoherent in refusing to intend to cause you pain?\nNot necessarily: she might believe that she will remove your tooth\neven if she does not intend to cause you pain.  But she will,\npresumably, believe that she will remove your tooth only if\nshe intends to use her instruments.  So, though she wouldn’t\nbe irrational in not intending to cause you pain, she would be\nirrational in not intending to use her instruments (Broome 2003;\nSearle 2001; Kamm 2000, 2007). Moreover, the relevant belief must be that intending the\nmeans now is necessary.  Suppose a beginning student intends\nto earn a doctoral degree and believes that, when the dissertation is\ncompleted, intending to submit the final paperwork is necessary for\nearning the degree.  It is not clear that she is being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend, now, to submit that paperwork.  She\nmay trust that, when the time comes, she will intend it (Setiya 2007).\nThis suggests, as Raz notes, that opportunities for instrumental\nincoherence may actually be very rare.  There seems to be considerable agreement, then, on what we might call the: But it is unclear exactly what requirement one violates.  \nAdditionally, it is unclear whether the requirement violated would be \n“normative” in the sense that one ought not to violate it.  In other \nwords, it is unclear whether, in being instrumentally incoherent, one \nviolates a requirement of reason, in the sense of “reason” \nidentified earlier.  In the remainder of this section, we’ll consider \nsome possible answers to these questions. First, (§3.1) we might say that there\nisn’t any requirement of reason to be instrumentally coherent as\nsuch, but whenever one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates\nsome independent requirement of reason.  Second,\n(§3.2) we might say that there is\na requirement of reason to be instrumentally coherent as such.  Third,\n(§3.3) we might deny that one\nnecessarily violates a requirement of reason in being instrumentally\nincoherent; perhaps the normativity of instrumental coherence is\nmerely apparent, or the requirement merely evaluative (it may be a\nstandard of proper functioning without giving anyone reason to comply\nwith it).  Fourth, (§3.4) one might\nthink, given the ways in which intention is thought to involve belief,\nthat in being instrumentally incoherent, one violates a requirement\nof theoretical rationality.  There are, of course, other answers that could be given.  (For \ninstance, we briefly discuss a constitutivist approach to instrumental \nincoherence, attributed to Kant, in §4.4)  But \nconsideration of these approaches will give a reasonably comprehensive \npicture of the recent attempts to explain the Violation Claim.  One answer is that when one is instrumentally incoherent one\nviolates some independent requirement of reason.  That\nis, either one has some specific attitude\n(or pattern of attitudes) that one ought not to have or\none lacks some specific attitude (or pattern of attitudes)\nthat one ought to have.  The source of the problem, according to this\nanswer, is not that when one is instrumentally incoherent,\none violates some requirement of reason to be instrumentally\ncoherent as such.  The source of the problem is instead that\nwhen one is instrumentally incoherent, then it is guaranteed that\none’s having (or lacking) one attitude (or pattern of attitudes)\nviolates some independent requirement of reason.  (See\nKolodny 2007b, 2008a; Kiesewetter 2018, esp. Ch. 10; Lord 2018,\nesp. Ch. 2.) Certainly, this can happen in some cases, at least accidentally.\nSuppose our madman intends to start World War III, believes that he\nwill start World War III only if he intends to launch a nuclear\nmissile, but refuses to intend to launch a nuclear missile.  The\nViolation Claim might be explained in this case by pointing out that,\nwhatever his other attitudes may be, he ought not to have the\nintention to start World War III, but does have that intention.  But\nwhy should we suppose that, in general, whenever one has an\ninstrumentally incoherent set, one either has an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought not to have, or lacks an attitude (or\npattern) that one ought to have? This would be so, in general, if the following were the case: It would also be so, in general, if the following were the case: Ought Pattern 2 speaks of “oughts” for patterns of\nintention, rather than for single intentions.  The reason for this is\nthat one’s having an intention to X can affect one’s reason for\nhaving an intention to Y.  This can happen in the following\nway.  First, one’s reason to intend to Y plausibly depends,\namong other things, on how likely one is to succeed in it.  Second,\nhow likely one is to succeed in it in turn depends on how the future\nis likely to be.  I am more likely to succeed in drying the laundry if\nthere is no rain.  Third, how the future is likely to be can depend on\nhow some person is likely to act.  I am more likely to succeed in\ndrying the laundry if the children are unlikely to be playing with the\nhose at the same time.  Fourth, the relevant person may be the agent\nhimself.  I am more likely to succeed in drying the laundry if I am\nunlikely to be at the same time watering the garden.  Finally, the\nfact that an agent intends to X can make it more likely that\nthe agent will X in the future.  The fact that I intend to\nwater the garden can make it more likely that I will be watering the\ngarden.  Thus, the fact that an agent intends to X can make it\nmore likely that the agent will not succeed in an intention\nto Y, and so that the agent has less reason to intend\nto Y.  Given that one’s intending to X can affect one’s\nreason to Y and vice versa, the questions, “What reason\ndo I have to intend to\nY?  What reason do I have to intend to X?” may be\ninsufficiently determinate.  Better questions may instead be\n“What reason do I have (to intend to X and to intend\nto Y)?  What reason do I have (to intend to X and not to\nintend to Y)?  What reason do I have (not to intend to X\nand to intend to Y)?  What reason do I have (not to intend\nto X and not to intend to Y)?” This phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon, that the presence of one\nintention can affect one’s reason to have another intention, should be\ndistinguished from the phenomenon, or apparent phenomenon, that the\npresence of one intention and the presence or absence of another can\nmake it the case that one violates or satisfies a rational requirement\nof instrumental coherence as such.  First, what matters for rational\nrequirements is what we believe about the relations between\nthe intentions, whereas what matters for reason would seem to be how\nthey are likely to affect one another, which may be\nindependent of what we believe.  Second, what matters for rational\nrequirements is intending to X as such, whereas what matters\nfor reason is what intending to X means for the future.  In\nsome cases, intending to X (e.g., intending to become King of\nFrance in 2023), may not affect the likely future.  In other\ncases, conditions other than intending to X (e.g., my\nself-trust that I will X even if I don’t intend it now, or my\nknowledge that I will be tortured or coerced into X-ing) may\naffect the likely future in the same way.  Finally, rational\nrequirements are usually taken to be wide-scope, as we will see below.\nThat is, one never needs to have or lack any particular attitude in\norder to satisfy them.  By contrast, one usually needs to have or lack\na particular attitude in order to conform to one’s reason to have a\ncertain pattern of intentions.  If one ought, for example, (to intend\nto X and not to intend to Y), then one can comply with\nthis requirement of reason only by intending to X and not\nintending to Y. One might argue for Ought Pattern 1 in the following way.  Suppose \nthat it is not the case that one ought not to believe that one will E \nonly if one intends to M.  Then by: one ought to believe it.  Suppose further that it is not the case\nthat one ought not to intend to E.  Then by: one ought to intend to E.  Suppose further that: Then one ought to E.  Then by: one ought to intend to M.  In other words, either one ought\nnot to believe that one will E only if one intends to M,\nor one ought not to intend to E, or one ought to intend\nto M. One problem is that the objections to Ought Necessity that we saw\nin §2 seem to apply to Variant as well.\nAnother is that Practical Strictness seems untenable (Way 2012a;\nCheng-Guajardo 2014). It might be the case neither that one\nought not to intend to E, nor that one ought to intend\nto E; intending to E might be merely permitted.  Suppose\nI ought to take a can of beans.  I can take the can of beans on the\nleft, or I can take the equally good can on the right.  It is neither\nthe case that I ought not to intend to take the can on the left, nor\nthat I ought to intend to take the can on the left. But perhaps in such cases one’s intending to take the can on\n the left provides a reason that tips the scales, thereby making it the \ncase that one ought to intend the means to that end. (See Schroeder \n2009, §4.1;  For criticism of the view that intentions provide reasons \nin this way, see Broome 2001 and Brunero 2007.)  If that’s true, then \nthese cases of “picking” wouldn’t pose a special problem for Ought \nPattern 1; in all such cases, one ought to intend to M.  One might argue for Ought Pattern 2 in the following way.  Again, \nsuppose that it is not the case that one ought not to have the belief.  \nThen, by Epistemic Strictness, one ought to have the belief.  For the \ntime being, suppose that one does not intend to M.  Then by: one ought to believe that one does not intend to M.  Then by: one ought to believe that one will not E.  Then by: one has no reason to intend to E.   In other words, so long as one \ndoes not intend to M, one has no reason to intend to E.  If we also \naccept: then, so long as one does not intend to M, one has no reason to \nintend to E and reason not to intend to E.  This makes it plausible that\n there is more reason (not to intend to M and not to intend to E) than \n(not to intend to M and to intend to E).  This does not mean \nthat one ought (not to intend to M and not to intend to E) all things \nconsidered.  For example, it might be the case that one ought (to intend\n to M and to intend to E).  But it does mean that whatever pattern of \nintention one ought to have, it is not to (not to intend to M and to \nintend to E).  There is a superior alternative. One question, of course, is whether we should accept these\nassumptions, in particular Required Self-Knowledge. Another problem is that even if this explains Ought Pattern 2, and\nso the Violation Claim, it does not explain the: Suppose that one ought to have the means-end belief and one ought (to\n intend to E and to intend to M).  However, one avoids incoherence by \ndropping the means-end belief, not intending to E, and not intending to \nM.  Intuitively, one has satisfied some requirement.  This is what the \nSatisfaction Claim reflects.  But one hasn’t adopted the particular \nattitudes (or patterns) that one ought to adopt.  How, then, are we to \nexplain the Satisfaction Claim? A quick answer might be this.  One might suggest, first, that one\nought to be instrumentally coherent, because it is a necessary means\nto, or at least a necessary condition of, having the particular\nattitudes (or pattern) that one independently ought to have, or not\nhaving the particular attitudes (or pattern) that one independently\nought not to have.  Suppose that one ought to intend to M, but\ndoes not.  Just as (P or Q) is a necessary condition\nof P, so too a necessary condition of intending to M is\n(either not to intend to E, or not to believe that one\nwill E only if one intends now to M, or to intend\nto M).  Now suppose that instead of intending to M, one\ndrops one’s intention to E.  While one hasn’t intended\nto M, which one ought to do, one has fulfilled a necessary\nmeans, or at least a necessary condition, of that.  Assume Ought\nNecessity of §2, perhaps slightly\nstrengthened: that one ought to take any necessary means to, or at\nleast fulfill any necessary condition of, what one ought.  In that\nsense, by dropping one’s intention to E, one has done something\nthat one ought, and so satisfied a requirement.  Analogously, if one\nought to post the letter, then, by similar reasoning, one ought\n(either to post the letter or to burn it).  So, if one burns the\nletter, one has done something that one ought, and so satisfied a\nrequirement. Note that this response assumes that either Ought Pattern 1 or\nOught Pattern 2 is correct.  Otherwise, we have no guarantee that, in\nany given case, a necessary condition of having the particular\nattitudes that one ought to have, or not having the particular\nattitudes that one ought not to have, is (either not to intend\nto E, or not to believe that one will E only if one\nintends now to M, or to intend to M).  So it inherits\nall of the challenges in defending Ought Pattern 1 or Ought Pattern\n2. Another problem with this response is that it is not obvious that\nOught Necessity is true, as the Professor Procrastinate example\nof §2 suggested. A third problem is that necessary conditions of intending\nto M are easy to come by.  Another necessary condition is\n(either intending to M or being instrumentally\nincoherent)!  Therefore, in exactly the same way, one satisfies a\nrequirement by remaining incoherent.  But the intuitive Satisfaction\nClaim is precisely that in escaping incoherence one satisfies a\nrequirement of a kind which one would not satisfy by remaining\ninstrumentally incoherent. The Violation and Satisfaction Claims would be explained by a\nrequirement of reason to avoid or escape instrumental\nincoherence as such.  Just as we ought not to torture, or\nought to care for our children, we ought to be instrumentally coherent\nas such. One might instead suggest a weaker view: we have a reason to be \ninstrumentally coherent as such.  But this weaker version faces a \ndifficulty in explaining the “strictness” of the Violation Claim.  One \ncould have a reason to X without being under any requirement to\n X, as when that reason to X is outweighed.  But, according to the \nViolation Claim, whenever one is instrumentally incoherent, one violates\n some requirement.  This “strictness” would thus remain unexplained by \nthe weaker view (Broome 1999).  Of course, the weaker view—that we have a\n reason to be instrumentally coherent as such—could be true even though \nit fails to explain the Violation and Satisfaction Claims. So, let’s work with the stronger view, according to which we ought to\n be instrumentally coherent as such.  One worry about this answer is \n“bootstrapping.”  Suppose that this requirement to be instrumentally \ncoherent as such is stated in “narrow-scope” form: if one intends to E \nand believes that one will E only if one intends to M, then one is \nrequired to intend to M.  Now suppose that one intends to stay in power \nand believes that one will do so only if one intends to kill one’s \nrival.  If one ought to be instrumentally coherent as such, it would \nfollow that one ought to intend to kill one’s rival.  But that seems \nimplausible.  So, one may conclude, we cannot understand “one is \nrationally required” as implying “one ought.”  A natural reply, however, is that there is another way to be\n instrumentally coherent: namely, to abandon the intention to stay in \npower.  Thus, a requirement of instrumental coherence as such should \ntake “wide-scope.” It should say: one is required to either revise one’s\n intention to E, or revise one’s belief that one will E only if one \nintends to M, or intend to M. (See especially Broome 1999 and Wallace \n2006.  For earlier defenses of the wide-scope view, see Hill 1973 and \nDarwall 1983.)  So even if “one is rationally required” is taken to \nimply “one ought,” all that follows is that one ought to either revise \nthe intention to stay in power, or revise the belief that one will do so\n only if one intends to kill one’s rival, or intend to kill one’s rival.\n  It does not follow that one ought to intend to kill one’s rival. However, there are some problems facing this approach, which we \noutline in the supplemental document \n Problems for Wide-Scoping. \nSome of those problems concern the allegedly implausible \nconsequences that emerge when we apply some of the transmission \nprinciples we discuss in §2 above—specifically, Ought \nNecessity, Weak Reasons Necessity, and Weak Reasons Sufficiency—to the \nrelevant wide-scope ought in certain cases. Other problems concern \nwhether the wide-scope formulation is adequate as a formulation of the \nrational requirement. \nThere are other challenges facing the view that the Violation and\nSatisfaction Claims are explained by a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such.  The proponent of this view,\npresumably, should be able to say what the reason is to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such (see Kolodny 2005, §2).  Keep in mind that it won’t be enough to state a reason to be disposed\n to be instrumentally coherent.  It doesn’t follow from one’s having a \nreason to have a disposition that one has a reason to manifest that \ndisposition on every particular occasion.  And so pointing to a reason \nto be disposed to be coherent wouldn’t yield a reason to be \ninstrumentally coherent as such.  (As we’ll see in\n §4.4,\n a similar problem confronts the Kantian constitutivist view that \ncontinued instrumental incoherence threatens our status as agents.  \nSince our agency isn’t at risk with every instance of instrumental \nincoherence, this account won’t yield a reason to be instrumentally \ncoherent on every particular occasion; it would only provide a reason to\n do so when one’s incoherence is extreme enough to threaten one’s status\n as an agent.)  Furthermore, it is not clear what reasons there are to \nbe disposed to be instrumentally coherent.  It might be thought that \nbeing disposed to be instrumentally coherent will make one more likely \nto conform to reason over the long run.  But given that instrumental \ncoherence may just as soon be gained by revising one’s attitudes against\n reason as in conformity to reason, one might doubt that this is so  \n(Kolodny 2008b). There’s a reason to be skeptical that such a reason could be \nprovided.  A reason to be instrumentally coherent as such would have to \napply at once to beliefs and intentions.  But one might think that this \ncannot be the case: that reasons for belief and reasons for intention \nare fundamentally different in kind.  Reasons for belief are \nconsiderations that show that the belief is likely to be true, whereas \nreasons for action are considerations that show that the action would \nrealize one’s desires, or promote or respect something of value. Some philosophers have attempted to meet this challenge.  Jonathan\nWay (2012a) has developed an account which points to the costs\nnecessarily involved in intending to E without also intending\nto M, specifically the psychological resources that would be\nwasted (one’s monitoring one’s progress towards E-ing, being\ndisposed to take means towards E-ing, etc.).  And Michael\nBratman (2009c) has recently suggested that we have a reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such because doing so is a necessary,\nconstitutive component of self-governance, and we have an intrinsic\nreason to govern ourselves.  In his view, just as we have a reason not\nto torture, and a reason to care for our children, we have a reason to\ngovern ourselves.  And one’s being instrumentally incoherent on any\nparticular occasion would be a way of failing to govern oneself.  A third approach to instrumental incoherence holds that one need\nnot violate any requirement of reason in being instrumentally\nincoherent.  One version of this view\n(§3.3.1) holds that instrumental coherence\nis to be explained in terms of appropriate responses to\none’s beliefs about independent requirements of reason, where\nthese beliefs could be false.  Another version of this view\n(§3.3.2) holds that instrumental incoherence\nis nothing more than an indicator that one is not functioning well as\nan agent, where this evaluation doesn’t entail any particular\nconclusions about what one ought, or has reason, to do. \nOn this first approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction\nClaims, what one does “wrong” in being instrumentally\ncoherent is violate one’s own judgments about one’s reasons (or fail\nto be attentive enough to form such judgments in the first place), and\nwhat one does “right” in becoming instrumentally coherent\nis respond appropriately to one’s judgments about one’s reasons. Suppose one is instrumentally incoherent.  Plausibly, one is in a \nposition to know this, that one is instrumentally incoherent.  \nPlausibly, one is also in a position to know Ought Pattern 2: the \ngeneral fact that, when one is instrumentally incoherent, there is some \nspecific change that one ought to make.  So, one is in a position to \nknow that there is some specific change that one ought to make.  So, \nplausibly, one ought to give some thought to what this specific change \nis.  In other words, Suppose one arrives at some such belief.  And suppose one revises\none’s attitudes in accordance with that belief.  If one becomes\ninstrumentally coherent in this way, then, even if one\nrevises one’s attitudes in the wrong way (i.e., against reason), one\nstill satisfies: This would explain the Satisfaction Claim. It might be thought that it’s not much of an improvement to explain\nthe requirement to be instrumentally coherent in terms of\nSelf-Monitoring and Krasia, since we are still appealing to a\nrequirement of coherence: namely, Krasia. The only difference is that\nit requires us not to be instrumentally coherent, but instead\nto be kratically coherent: i.e., to follow one’s judgment\nabout one’s reasons.  Indeed, if we thought that it were a\nrequirement of reason to comply with Krasia, then similar\nchallenges to those we discussed\nin §3.2. would reappear, and so it\nwould not be much of an improvement.   But, the view considered here naturally suggests a new strategy: \npresenting a Transparency Account according to which the normativity of \ninstrumental coherence is merely apparent (Kolodny 2005, §5).\nAccording to the Transparency Account of rational requirements in \ngeneral, when we point out to people that rationality requires something\n of them, we aren’t presenting them with some requirement of reason; \nrather, we’re pointing out to them what they already think reason \nrequires of them.  And, so, when we point out to someone that \nrationality requires they be instrumentally coherent with respect to \nsome end, we’re pointing out to them that (on the assumption that \nSelf-Monitoring is satisfied) they already think that reason requires \nsome specific change in their attitudes.  Of course, the instrumentally \nincoherent agent could be mistaken in these thoughts; perhaps he thinks \nreason requires him to intend the means when reason actually requires \nthat he abandon the end instead.  It is this possibility for false \nbelief that restricts us to saying that the normativity of rational \nrequirements is merely apparent.   However, one might challenge whether the Satisfaction Claim is \nadequately explained by an appeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia.  \nSuppose an instrumentally incoherent agent knows that she ought to give \nup her intention to kill her boss, but instead she comes to intend to \npoison the office coffee, which she believes to be a necessary means to \nkilling her boss.  She clearly violates a requirement of reason and she \nclearly violates Krasia, but it still seems that she satisfies some \nrequirement in coming to intend the means to her immoral end.  The \nappeal to Self-Monitoring and Krasia can’t explain our thinking that she\n satisfies some requirement in proceeding this way. \nPerhaps a violation of a requirement of instrumental coherence is\nmerely an indicator that an agent is not functioning well in the\nexercise of her rational capacities, where this evaluation doesn’t\nentail that she ought, or has reason, to be instrumentally coherent on\nany particular occasion (see Raz 2005a,b).  In holding this view,\none could also say that there is value in being a properly functioning\nagent, and that this value is explained by the ways in which\nfunctioning properly as a agent tends to bring one into conformity\nwith what reason requires.  But, it doesn’t follow from this that\nthere is value in functioning properly, or that one has any reason to\nfunction properly, in every particular occasion.  (Similar things\ncould be said about the value of having well-functioning perceptual\ncapacities.)  For instance, when one has the unalterable intention to\nkill one’s boss (for more on unalterable ends, see \n Section 1 of\nthe supplementary document \n  Problems for Wide Scoping), \nthere is nothing valuable in one’s\nfunctioning properly, so far as instrumental rationality goes, on that\nparticular occasion, and one would have no reason to do so (see Raz\n2005a, especially pp. 10–13, and Bratman 1987).  But one might worry about how well this account explains the \nViolation and Satisfaction Claims.  On this view, the requirements \nviolated, or satisfied, are simply standards of proper rational \nfunctioning.  These standards can be used to evaluate how well particular \nagents are functioning, in the same way that standards of what makes for\n a well-functioning perceptual apparatus can be used to evaluate how \nwell particular perceivers are functioning.  But, rational requirements \nalso seem to call for some response.  For instance, when we \nadvise others who are in violation of rational requirements, such as \nthose who are instrumentally incoherent, we say that some change in \nattitude is called for.  And, when we ourselves are \ninstrumentally incoherent, we feel some “normative pressure” to \nchange our attitudes in some way (see Kolodny 2005, §4). It’s unclear \nhow these features of rational requirements could be explained by a view\n that takes them to be merely evaluative.   \nA fourth approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction Claims \nargues that the requirement violated, or satisfied, is, or is explained \nby, requirements on belief exclusively.  There are two \ncomponents to this “cognitivist” approach: first, there is some thesis \nabout how intention involves belief, and, second, there is some account \nof how the requirements governing those involved beliefs constitute, or \nexplain, the requirement to be instrumentally coherent.  Here are some candidates for the first component: (Cognitivist accounts developed with Strong, or a variant of it, are \nfound in Harman 1976, 1986; Velleman 1989, 2007; Setiya 2007; Broome\n 2009; and Archer 2018.  Earlier defenses of Strong can be found in Hampshire and Hart \n1958 and Grice 1971.  Wallace 2006 develops a cognitivist account with \nMedium, and Binkley 1965 does so with Weak.) \nLet’s begin with Strong.  Suppose I am instrumentally\nincoherent—that is, I intend to E, believe I\nwill E only if I intend to M, but don’t intend\nto M.  According to Strong, I believe When we pair this with my instrumental belief and apply the theoretical rational requirement we get the result that I am required to believe or drop either (1) or (2).  If I drop (1), I would cease to intend to\n E (according to Strong) and thereby cease to be instrumentally \nincoherent, and if I drop my instrumental belief (2), I would also cease\n to be instrumentally incoherent. But is coming to believe (3) enough to cease to be instrumentally \nincoherent?  What if my belief is false?  There are two options for the \ncognitivist at this point.  The first would be to defend   But we might doubt that we are infallible in our beliefs about our \nown intentions (Bratman 2009b, §4,5).  After all, it seems that we can \nbe mistaken in our beliefs about other attitudes we have (see \nSchwitzgebel 2010, §4). A second option for the cognitivist would be to say that having\n false beliefs about one’s own intentions is possible, but\n theoretically irrational.  (On this option, the cognitivist\n approach to instrumental coherence appeals to two\n theoretical requirements: Closure plus some other requirement not to\n have false beliefs about one’s own intentions.)  However, there is\n usually nothing necessarily incoherent about one’s having\n a false belief.  So, the challenge for cognitivists is to\n explain why, in this particular case, there is.  (This strategy is\n pursued by Setiya 2007, 670–671. For criticism, see Bratman\n 2009a, §4 and Brunero 2009, §2.) Additionally, one might worry that Strong is too strong.  Suppose you\n intend to go shopping on Thursday but don’t believe you intend this and\n instead believe that you intend to go shopping on Friday.  Maybe you’ve\n temporarily forgotten that you’ve recently changed your mind, deciding \nto go on Thursday instead of Friday  (Bratman 2009a, §5).  In this case,\n you might not believe you will go shopping on Thursday.  In light of \nthis example, John Broome (2009, §7) suggests the following  But this wouldn’t help the cognitivist if she aims to account for the\n application of instrumental coherence to all intentions, including \nthose we don’t believe we have (Bratman 2009b, §2).  Additionally, both \nStrong and Variant of Strong seem vulnerable to counterexamples.  \nSuppose I intend, and believe I intend, to carry out a difficult task.  \nKnowing the difficulty involved, I could intend to carry out the task \nbut remain agnostic about whether I will do so.  Here’s another \ncounterexample: suppose I intend to stop by a bookstore on the way home,\n but know that once I’m riding on my bicycle, I tend to go on \n“autopilot.”  Aware of my absentminded tendencies, I might intend to \nstop by the bookstore without believing I will (Bratman 1987, 38–39; \nalso discussed in Holton 2008, §2). Since such intentions make applicable\n a requirement of instrumental coherence, but don’t involve a belief in \nsuccess, the cognitivist cannot explain why requirements of instrumental\n coherence apply to these intentions.  \nNext, let us consider Medium.  Suppose again that I am instrumentally \nincoherent—that is, I intend to E, believe I will E only if I intend to \nM, but don’t intend to M.  By I believe Let us now suppose that the instrumental belief takes this form: If I satisfy Closure, then I believe: However, since I intend to E, then, by Medium, I believe: Thus, in believing (3) and (4), I violate: Thus, if one satisfies Closure, then one violates Belief Consistency (Wallace 2006). One might object to Self-Knowledge, arguing that we aren’t always\naware of what we fail to intend.  One might falsely believe one\nintends the means (Bratman 2009a) or one might simply fail to notice\nthat one hasn’t intended the means (Brunero 2005a).  One response\navailable to the cognitivist would be to say that such lapses in\nself-awareness are possible, but are\ntheoretically irrational.  And so instrumental coherence\nwould be explained by Closure, Belief Consistency, and the requirement\nto be aware of one’s absent intention in this context.  While it\nwouldn’t be plausible to claim that rationality requires, in general,\nawareness of what one does not intend, it might be plausible to say\nthat awareness of what one does not intend is rationally required in\nthis specific context (Wallace 2006, 118).  One might also object that if one is going to be a cognitivist about \npractical requirements in general, one must account for both \ninstrumental coherence and But Medium, on its own, does not seem sufficient to account for \nIntention Consistency.  Such a conflict of intentions would involve the \nfollowing beliefs: But unlike those beliefs involved according to Strong, namely, (5) and (6) are perfectly consistent with one another.  I could \nconsistently believe it’s possible that I not go to the game tonight, and \npossible that I go to the game tonight.  So, we are still in need of an \nexplanation of why I’m rationally required to not both intend not to go \nand intend to go (Bratman 2009b, §3). One might also raise doubts about Medium. Suppose I know I haven’t\nyet investigated whether the stores are closed for the holiday on\nThursday, and so I haven’t yet formed any beliefs about whether I can\ngo shopping then.  Couldn’t I still intend to go shopping on Thursday?\nThat might be irrational or careless planning on my part, but it seems\npossible.  (The example might prove even more convincing if we add the\nfeature of Bratman’s example above: suppose, forgetting about my\nchange of mind, I believe I intend to go shopping on Friday, not on\nThursday.)  Perhaps doubts could even be raised, not just about\nwhether intending to E involves believing E is possible,\nbut also about whether intending to E involves not\nbelieving E is impossible.  Richard Holton (2008), drawing\non Anscombe’s example from Intention (§52) of a man who\nis certain he’ll break down under torture but is determined not to\nbreak down, has argued that one could intend some end while believing\nthat end isn’t a “live possibility.” Such combinations,\nHolton argues, may be irrational, but aren’t impossible.  Next, let us consider Weak.  Suppose again that I am instrumentally \nincoherent—that is, I intend to E, believe I will E only if I intend to \nM, but don’t intend to M.  By Self-Knowledge, I believe: When this belief is paired with the contrapositive of my\ninstrumental belief Closure requires that I believe or cease to believe (1) or (2).  But since I intend to E, it\nfollows, by Weak, that I do not believe (3).  Were I to comply with\nClosure by forming the belief (3), I would, according to Weak, thereby\ncease to intend to E.  In ceasing to believe (2), I would cease\nto be instrumentally incoherent.  And in ceasing to believe (1)\n(which, if Self-Knowledge is true, would mean that it is no longer the\ncase that I do not intend to M) I would also cease to be\ninstrumentally incoherent. Some of the objections mentioned above would also apply to this \naccount.  There is the objection to Self-Knowledge.  And Anscombe’s \nexample, exploited by Holton, also presents a challenge to Weak, since \nthe torture victim intends not to break down but believes that he will. Additionally, one might raise questions concerning the rationality\nof responding to the violation of Closure in this context.\nUsually, if one discovers that one\nbelieves P, P→Q, but does not\nbelieve Q, the rational way to proceed depends upon one’s\nassessment of the relevant reasons for belief (where these are\nevidential, not pragmatic, reasons).  Let us assume, for simplicity,\nthat P→Q is a fixed background belief.  If one\nthinks there are really strong reasons for believing P and not\nstrong reasons for not believing Q, then it would be irrational\nfor one to refuse to believe Q and instead to drop one’s belief\nthat P.  Now, according to this cognitivist account, when I’m\ninstrumentally incoherent, I believe (1) and (2) but not (3).  How\nshould I proceed?  If I currently do not intend to M, and if,\nas Self-Knowledge holds, I’m infallibly aware of what I do not intend,\nthen it seems that the evidence I have for my belief that I do not\nintend to M is really quite strong.  Let’s assume (2) is a\nfixed background belief.  In revising in light of my assessment of the\nevidence, it seems that the revision could only proceed in one\ndirection: by modus ponens, coming to believe I will\nnot E.  It would be irrational for me instead to proceed\nby modus tollens, ceasing to believe that I do not intend\nto M.  So, if we respond to violations of Closure in the usual\nway, we are left with the counterintuitive result that there is only\none way to escape a state of instrumental incoherence: by abandoning\nthe end. Finally, one might also cast doubt on the general cognitivist \nstrategy being employed here, whether it appeals to Weak, Medium, or \nStrong.  Many of the same questions that we’ve raised about instrumental\n incoherence could be raised about rational requirements on belief, \nincluding Belief Consistency and Closure.  There are analogues of the \nViolation and Satisfaction Claims for these rational requirements that \nwould need to be defended and explained.   For example, Joseph Raz \nquestions whether the analogue of the Violation Claim for Belief \nConsistency is even true (see Raz 2005b, §3; Raz 2005a, §5).  If one has\n a set of beliefs that is inconsistent, then at least one of the beliefs\n in that set is false.  But, Raz argues, it does not follow that there \nis any revision in one’s beliefs that one ought to make.  (Reflection on\n logical paradoxes, like the sorities paradox, shows that having an \ninconsistent set of beliefs doesn’t imply that there is any belief in \nthe set that one ought to give up.)  Although Raz objects to the \ncognitivist’s appeal to Belief Consistency in particular, similar \nquestions might be raised about the cognitivist’s appeal to Closure. \nMuch discussion of instrumental rationality has taken place in the\ncontext of a debate about whether instrumental rationality is the only\nkind of practical rationality or, alternatively, there are other\nrequirements of practical rationality as well, such as requirements of\nprudence and morality.  Typically, the former view is called a\n“Humean” one and the latter a “Kantian” one.\nIn this section, we’ll consider some possible understandings of the\nthesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical\nrationality (§4.1), and whether some\nversion of this thesis is given any support by an instrumental\nanalogue of Lewis Carroll’s famous paradox concerning modus\nponens (§4.2).  We’ll also consider\nthe views of Hume (§4.3) and Kant\n(§4.4) on instrumental rationality.\n \nIt is sometimes claimed that instrumental rationality is the only kind of \npractical rationality.  But what exactly is being claimed? Is the claim about rational incoherence?  Then it would seem to be \nthe claim that the only kind of practical, rational incoherence is \ninstrumental incoherence.  But this claim would have to contend with the\n idea that there are other kinds of practical, rational incoherence.  \nFor example, it seems incoherent to refuse to intend what one believes \none ought to intend.  It also seems incoherent to intend to X and to \nintend to Y when one believes that if one Xs, one will not Y. Alternatively, the claim might be about reason: that all\n(practical) reason is, in some sense, instrumental.  On one\ninterpretation, the claim would say that the only true claim about\nreason is some principle of instrumental transmission.  But this\nwould seem to imply that there are no practical reasons at all.\nUnless there is some other true claim about reasons for\n“ends” understood as actions, there is nothing to be\ntransmitted.  (For arguments that there would need to be another kind\nof rationality, see Korsgaard 1997; Lavin 2004; Hubin 1999; Nozick\n1993; Hampton 1998.) A different interpretation is that all reasons are instrumental.\n  In other words, the reason for any action (or intention) can be \nexpressed as: the action will help to bring about some “end,” where \n“end” is understood not as an action, but instead as some valuable or \ndesired state of affairs.  The Desire-Based Theory is committed to this \nclaim.  But not all Value-Based Theories are.  The reason for an action,\n for example, might be that it honors or respects something of value, \neven though it does not help to bring it about. A final interpretation is that all deliberation is of\nmeans.  In other words, there is no place for significant\nevaluative or normative reflection on the ultimate ends that one has\nreason to bring about.  The Desire-Based Theory seems committed to\nthis claim, at least to some extent.  According to the Desire-Based\nTheory, reflection on the ultimate ends that one has reason to bring\nabout is just reflection on the non-normative matter of what one in\nfact desires, plus grasp of the Desire-Based Theory itself.  On the\nother hand, Value-Based theories seem committed to rejecting this\nclaim, even those Value-Based Theories that accept that all reasons\nare instrumental in the sense discussed in the previous paragraph.\nFor whether a certain state of affairs is valuable, and so an end that\none has reason to bring about, is itself the object of significant\nevaluative thought.  (Note that it is a mistake to express the present\nidea, that all deliberation is of means, as the idea that one cannot\nbe criticized for ends.  According to the Desire-Based\nTheory, one can be criticized for what one intends\nor acts to bring about, insofar as it is not the realization\nof one’s strongest, present intrinsic desires.  And even according to\nValue-Based theories, one cannot be criticized for what one\nhas reason to bring about.) Notice that the Desire-Based Theory is committed to the claim that \npractical reason is exclusively instrumental, on these two last \ninterpretations.  This may explain why the Desire-Based Theory is often \nsimply identified with “instrumental rationality,” and why the claim \nthat “the only kind of practical rationality is instrumental \nrationality” is sometimes just meant as an assertion of the Desire-Based\n Theory. Lewis Carroll (1895) introduced a famous paradox concerning modus ponens.\n  Some philosophers have argued that an instrumental analogue of this \nparadox shows there to be something special about instrumental \nrationality, and perhaps even provides support for some version of the \nthesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of practical \nrationality. Carroll imagined a conversation between Achilles and a Tortoise\nregarding the following valid argument:  Therefore, The Tortoise adopts a skeptical position, asking how he can be \nlogically forced into accepting (Z) when he accepts (A) and (B).  Achilles \nattempts to supply him with the missing premise: But the Tortoise grants (C), and resumes his skepticism, asking how\nhe can be logically forced to accept (Z) when he accepts (A), (B), and\n(C).  It soon dawns on Achilles that the mere addition of further\npremises (like “If (A), (B), and (C) are true, (Z) must be\ntrue”, and so on) won’t help resolve the Tortoise’s skepticism.\nOne could keep on adding such premises ad infinitum and yet\nnot get the Tortoise to accept (Z). Much has been written about what lessons to draw from Carroll’s\nparadox, but this much seems clear: the Tortoise refuses to accept (Z)\nbecause he refuses to apply modus ponens to the premises he\naccepts.  So, if modus ponens itself is merely\naccepted by him as yet another premise, that won’t suffice to get him\nto accept (Z). Now, imagine we confront someone who holds some end E,\nbelieves some means M is necessary for E-ing, yet\ndoesn’t intend to M, and, like the Tortoise, doesn’t intend\nto M because he refuses to apply instrumental\nrationality to the ends he has, including E.  If we suggest\nthat he remedy this defect by adopting yet another end (namely, the\nend of doing what instrumental rationality requires), this wouldn’t\nhelp matters.  Since his problem is that he doesn’t apply instrumental\nrationality to the ends he has, he wouldn’t apply instrumental\nrationality to this new end as well, and so still wouldn’t intend\nto M (or drop the intention to E).  So, the mere\naddition of instrumental rationality as another end would be\nfutile. What should we conclude from this instrumental analogue of\nCarroll’s paradox?  Railton (1997) argues that it shows that a certain\nform of skepticism about rationality—specifically, one’s asking\n“Why should I comply with the norms of practical\nrationality?”—can be answered.  First, the asking of this\nskeptical question reveals a commitment to at least instrumental\nrationality, since one is here questioning whether being practically\nrational would advance one’s ends.  And, second, the\ninstrumental analogue of Carroll’s paradox shows that we can’t think\nof this commitment to instrumental rationality as merely another end\nthe agent accepts and could dismiss at will.  If the skeptic thinks it\nis, Railton suggests that “we can answer ‘No, on pain of\nregress, it cannot be just another end of yours’”\n(p. 317). However, it’s not clear why the skeptic would have to think of\ninstrumental rationality as just another end she has.  Couldn’t she\nthink of it instead as (or also as) a disposition that she manifests,\nor a capacity that she exercises, with respect to the ends that she\naccepts?  (If so, she would avoid the particular problem that\nconfronts the character in the instrumental analogue of Carroll’s\nparadox, who merely accepts instrumental rationality as another end\nwithout applying it to her ends.)  And then couldn’t she\nrequest some philosophical explanation of why she should exercise that\ncapacity?  That she already has the capacity is of course no barrier\nto posing such a question (Wedgwood 2005).  Indeed, as we’ve seen\nin §3.3, some philosophers\nhave denied that we always ought, or have reason, to be\ninstrumentally coherent; they’ve argued that rational requirements are\nonly apparently normative, or are merely evaluative. Dreier (2001) concludes that the instrumental analogue of Carroll’s\nparadox shows that instrumental rationality has a special status.  In\nCarroll’s original paradox, the Tortoise would be such that we\ncouldn’t give him reasons to believe in some proposition.  In the\nnormal case, I can provide you with a reason to believe Q by\ngetting you to believe P and to believe P→Q.  But\nthis simply won’t work for the Tortoise, who refuses to\napply modus ponens.  Likewise, Dreier observes, we would be\nincapable of giving reasons to someone who refused to draw\n“practical inferences” between ends and means.  The\nacceptance of instrumental rationality is thus, he argues, a necessary\ncondition for being receptive to reasons at all.  And this supports\nhis conclusion that “the only ultimate sort of reasons are\ninstrumental reasons” (p.  43).  This seems to be an endorsement\nof the Desire-Based Theory.  Does the conclusion follow?  Even if a disposition to be\ninstrumentally rational is indispensable in the way Dreier suggests\nto having a practical reason, nothing follows\nabout what one has practical reason to do.  Additionally,\nit’s worth noting that it’s doubtful that Carroll’s original paradox\nwould license a restriction on the scope of theoretical\nreasons analogous to the Humean restriction on the scope of practical\nreasons that Dreier thinks the instrumental analogue of Carroll’s\nparadox supports.  That is, it is not obvious that I have reason to\nbelieve Q only if I am disposed come to believe it by\napplying modus ponens.  Perhaps my merely believing, with\nreason, both P and P→Q provides me with a reason\nfor believing Q.  Or perhaps the mere fact the available\nevidence supports Q is enough (Jollimore 2005). Korsgaard (2009) argues that we can draw a conclusion about\nthe metaethical status of instrumental rationality by\nconsidering an instrumental analogue of Carroll’s paradox.\nSpecifically, she appeals to it to argue against metaethical realism\nabout instrumental rationality (and about other normative principles\nas well).  Let’s suppose that there is a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent.  A realist would claim that there is some\nnormative fact, according to which we ought to be instrumentally\ncoherent.  But a skeptic might ask, “Why ought I apply that\nfact—that I ought to be instrumentally coherent—to my\nactions?” The realist might answer, “Because—and\nhere’s another normative fact—it just is the case that you ought\nto apply the fact that you ought to be instrumentally coherent to your\nactions.” But one might resume one’s skepticism and ask why one\nmust apply that normative fact to one’s actions.  One could\nkeep adding normative facts ad infinitum without providing an\nanswer to the question, in the same way that Achilles could keep\nadding premises without meeting the Tortoise’s challenge.   A full discussion of the metaethical issues raised by this argument \nwould take us too far afield  (see Parfit 2006). But one strategy of \nreply is to argue that the realist has already answered the question.  \nWhat it is for such normative facts to be normative just is \nthat they require that you act in some way.  If you’re asking of \nnormative facts in general why you should act in accordance with them, \nthen you don’t fully understand what normative facts are. The thesis that instrumental rationality is the only kind of\npractical rationality is often taken to be a “Humean”\nthesis, though, as we’ve seen (§4.1),\nthere are several ways in which this thesis could be understood.  One\ncould take the thesis just to be an assertion of the Desire-Based\nTheory.  One could also take the thesis to specify that instrumental\ncoherence is the only requirement of practical rationality.  However,\nit is doubtful that Hume held either of these views.   There are some passages which might seem to suggest these views.\nIn Book II of the Treatise (1739–40), Hume denies that\na person’s ends, however immoral or imprudent, can be unreasonable\n(“contrary to reason,” to use his exact phrase) if they’re\nnot based on a false belief: Here he seems to claim that one’s choosing means insufficient for \none’s end can be deemed unreasonable, even though the end itself is not \nsubject to such rational assessment.  However, this wouldn’t support the Desire-Based Theory, since the\nDesire-Based Theory allows that ends can be unreasonable when they\ndon’t promote the satisfaction of one’s strongest, present intrinsic\ndesires.  For instance, choosing one’s total ruin, when doing so runs\ncounter to one’s strongest, present intrinsic desires, even when doing\nso isn’t based on a false belief, can be criticized as unreasonable on\nthe Desire-Based Theory. Soon after this passage, Hume is careful to note that it wouldn’t\nbe one’s intending of means insufficient for one’s ends\nthat’s unreasonable, but the false belief on which this\nintention is based.  For example, when I falsely believe that staying\non 95N will get me to Memphis, which is where I intend to go, and so I\nintend to stay on 95N, it’s my belief that 95N will get me to Memphis\nthat’s unreasonable, not the intention, based on this belief, to stay\non 95N. Why did Hume think this?  Hume holds that “reason is the\ndiscovery of truth and falsehood” (p. 458).  Since beliefs aim\nto correctly represent the world—and the beliefs that succeed in\nrepresenting the world are true, while the beliefs that fail to do so\nare false—they can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable.\nBut passions, as well as intentions and actions, are “original\nexistences.” They don’t purport to represent or\n“copy” some other “existence” (p. 415).\nSpecifically, they don’t aim to correctly represent the world, and so\nthey can’t be true or false.  Hence, they can’t be assessed as\nreasonable or unreasonable.  In light of such considerations, many philosophers have argued that\nHume doesn’t endorse an instrumentalist conception of practical\nreason, but instead, more radically, is a skeptic about all of\npractical reason.  (See, for instance, Hampton 1995; Millgram 1995;\nKorsgaard 1997.  For objections to this skeptical interpretation of\nHume, see Setiya 2004.)  On this interpretation, Hume acknowledges the\nexistence of requirements of theoretical reason, since\nbeliefs can be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable, but is\nskeptical about the existence of requirements of practical\nreason, including instrumental reason, since desires, intentions, and\nactions can’t be assessed as reasonable or unreasonable.  (Even a\npreference for “one’s own acknowledg’d lesser good”\nwouldn’t be unreasonable, on his view.)  Since, on this\ninterpretation, Hume was skeptical about practical reason in\ngeneral, we can’t appeal to his view to establish a special place\nfor instrumental rationality among the requirements of practical\nrationality.  Various challenges could be raised against Hume’s rather narrow \nconception of reason.  But our primary interest here is in whether Hume \ncan provide us with a plausible account of instrumental rationality.\n On Hume’s view, our intentions are subject to rational criticism when, \nand only when, they are based on false beliefs (and, again, it’s the \nbelief that’s to blame, strictly speaking).  As an account of \ninstrumental rationality, Hume’s view would face two serious objections. First, it seems that one can be instrumentally irrational without\nhaving any intentions based on false beliefs (or lacking any\nintentions because of false beliefs).  John Broome provides an\nexample: suppose I know the hotel is on fire and that the only escape\ninvolves my intending to go through the open window, and, though I\nintend to live, I sit on the windowsill singing happily until the\nflames consume me.  This is a clear case of instrumental\nirrationality, despite my not having any false beliefs (Broome 1997).\nIndeed, one could fail to intend the means believed necessary for\none’s ends because of rage, depression, distraction, grief, or other\ncauses which don’t necessarily involve any false beliefs (Korsgaard\n1986).  Hume would have to conclude either that such cases are\nimpossible, or that they involve no instrumental irrationality. Second, it seems that one can have intentions based on false\nbeliefs without being instrumentally irrational, or irrational in any\nother way.  Instrumental rationality, as it’s usually understood, is a\nrequirement of coherence governing one’s intentions and\nbeliefs—a requirement that is in place regardless of\nthe truth of those beliefs.  The person who intends to get to\nMemphis, believes that he must intend to stay on 95N to get there, and\ndoes intend to stay on 95N, displays coherence in his attitudes,\ndespite having a false belief.  So, an accusation of instrumental\nirrationality here would be misplaced. (Additionally, it would also be\ninappropriate to accuse him of any theoretical irrationality,\nif we suppose that this belief isn’t inconsistent with any other\nbeliefs he holds, and he also believes there’s conclusive evidence for\nit, and so forth.)  Hume would have to conclude either that such cases\nare impossible, or that they involve instrumental irrationality.  \nAn alternative to the narrow instrumentalism associated with Hume is \nfound in the work of Immanuel Kant, who thought that rationality \nrequired us not only to be instrumentally rational, but also to obey the\n moral law.  In his Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (1785),  \nKant distinguishes two kinds of imperatives: For example, “If you intend to go to law school, take the\nLSAT” would be a hypothetical imperative since it commands an\naction (taking the LSAT) as a means to some end (going to law school).\nIf you didn’t have any ends that would be served by taking the LSAT,\nthe command for you to do so would be withdrawn.  Categorical\nimperatives, such as “If someone is drowning nearby, offer\nassistance,” differ in two ways.  First, the command to offer\nassistance applies to you regardless of whether offering assistance\nserves any of your (desired or intended) ends.  Second, you have a\nreason to offer assistance regardless of whether doing so serves any\nof your (desired or intended) ends.  (Philippa Foot has argued that\nthis second feature doesn’t follow from the first: a rule of\netiquette, or a club rule, may apply to you regardless of whether\ncompliance with it serves any of your ends, but you may nonetheless\nhave no reason to comply with it. See Foot 1972.)  By “one wants” in the passage above, Kant means\n“one wills”: something closer to “one intends”\nthan “one desires.” (After all, it wouldn’t be plausible\nto suggest that one is instrumentally irrational in not intending the\nnecessary means to what one merely wants.  I want to own a\nBMW, but I don’t intend to work the kind of job that would allow me to\nbuy one.  But there’s nothing incoherent about my continuing to desire\nto own one.)  According to Kant: But if Kant’s view is to provide a plausible account of\ninstrumental coherence, it should instead refer to the\nmeans believed to be indispensably necessary, since there is\nnothing incoherent about not willing necessary means of which you are\nunaware, and something incoherent about not willing the means you\nbelieve are necessary, even when they actually aren’t (Korsgaard\n1997, 236).  Kant’s parenthetical remark in the passage above is important.  For\nKant, when one fails to will the necessary means to one’s ends, then\nreason has failed to have decisive influence.  In other words, one is\nirrationally incoherent.  Less guardedly, Kant says “the\nproposition (if I fully will the effect, then I will the action\nrequired of it) is analytic” (4:417).  But it is puzzling how\nthis proposition could be analytic.  If it were analytic, then it\nwould be conceptually impossible to be instrumentally\nincoherent since whenever one doesn’t will the means, then one doesn’t\nwill the end.  (For a defense of this conceptual impossibility, see\nFinlay 2009.)  And if it’s conceptually impossible to be\ninstrumentally incoherent, we’d be unable to make sense of why Kant\nformulates his account of instrumental incoherence in terms\nof imperatives, which, on Kant’s view, are commands addressed\nto a will that is capable of both following and not following the\ncommands (Kant 4:414; Hill 1973, 430; Korsgaard 1997, 236).  So,\nperhaps we should read Kant’s claim as that if one wills the\nend, rationality requires that one will the means.  (For an\nalternative reading, see Lee 2018.) Even so, there is a debate over the interpretation of Kant’s claim,\nparticularly about the logical scope of “requires.”\nAccording to the wide-scope interpretation of Kant’s claim, what\nreason requires is that one either will the means or\nnot will the end.  In contrast, according the narrow-scope\ninterpretation of Kant’s claim, if one wills the end, then what reason\nrequires is that one will the means.  The wide-scope\ninterpretation posits a disjunctive requirement (that one either not\nwill the end or will the means) that, like Kant’s categorical\nimperative, applies to every rational agent, regardless of\nthe particular ends she wills.  But it’s hard to square the existence\nof such a universally applicable requirement with some other claims\nKant makes about how hypothetical imperatives are to be distinguished\nfrom categorical ones, and how hypothetical imperatives could be\nderived from an analysis of the concept of willing an end. (See Schroeder\n2005b.  For a defense of the wide-scope interpretation against Schroeder’s objections, see Rippon 2014. For a related discussion of these issues, see Schwartz\n2008.)   But the narrow-scope interpretation appears to leave Kant’s view \nvulnerable to “detachment” objections.  Suppose you will some immoral \nend but, irrationally, don’t will the immoral means you believe \nnecessary to carry out this immoral end.  On the narrow-scope \ninterpretation, reason would require that you will the immoral means.  \nBut that seems implausible.  At the very least, it would lead to \nsomething Kant wouldn’t accept: reason issuing contradictory commands.  \nYour willing the immoral means would be required by a hypothetical \nimperative but forbidden by the categorical imperative (Hill 1973, 436). Kant could avoid the detachment problem if he holds, as some\ninterpreters claim, that it is impossible to will (Wille)\nimmoral ends (Schroeder 2005b, §3).  If this interpretation is\nright, then reason would never require one to will immoral means.  But\nit would also leave Kant without an account of instrumental\nincoherence, at least as we have been understanding it.  After all,\nagents can display instrumental incoherence in the pursuit\nof both moral and immoral ends.  To use Kant’s own examples,\nthe doctor who doesn’t intend the means believed necessary to making\nhis patient healthy is instrumentally incoherent in the same way as is\nthe poisoner who doesn’t intend the means believed necessary to kill\nhis victim (4:415).  So, this interpretation would have Kant avoiding\nthe detachment objection, but at the cost of no longer presenting an\naccount of instrumental incoherence that holds regardless of whether\nthe end is reasonable or good.   Let’s now turn to Kant’s explanation of the normative authority of \nhypothetical imperatives.  While Kant presents a complicated and \nintricate argument to explain the normative authority of the categorical\n imperative, he claims that hypothetical imperatives require “no special\n discussion,” and spends comparatively little time discussing them \n(4:417).  Kant’s approach here—which might seem to play into the hands of\n instrumentalists (see §4.1 above) who, while \nskeptical of the rational authority of the categorical imperative, \nfollow Kant in thinking that the authority of hypothetical imperatives \nis obvious and unproblematic—has been challenged.  Although the “ought” \nof a hypothetical imperative is contingent on an agent’s ends, that \n“ought” still needs to be explained.  Additionally, it’s not clear that a\n hypothetical “ought” is any more compatible with a naturalistic \nworldview than a categorical one.  Specifically, some of the same \nmetaethical challenges that have been raised about the status of the \ncategorical “ought” could be raised about normative claims in general, \nincluding the hypothetical “ought”  (Hampton 1998, Ch. 4; Shafer-Landau\n 2006, §6). So, what is Kant’s explanation of the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives?  According to Korsgaard (1997), Kant’s views\nchanged over the course of his philosophical development.  Kant’s\nearly “dogmatic rationalist” view (evident in\nthe Groundwork) held that we should comply with these\nhypothetical imperatives simply because they express what a perfectly\nrational agent would do.  But the mature Kantian view—which\nKorsgaard endorses—explains the normative authority of\nhypothetical imperatives in terms of the commitments that are\nconstitutive of willing.  According to this view, what’s involved\nin willing some end (as opposed to merely desiring it) is\nbeing committed to taking the means to that end.  It’s not\nthat complying with this commitment is constitutive of\nintention (this would render instrumental irrationality conceptually\nimpossible) but that having this commitment is constitutive\nof intention.  So, when one is instrumentally irrational, one fails to\nlive up to one’s own commitments.  Korsgaard writes: But is Korsgaard right that willing an end necessarily\ninvolves prescribing that end to yourself?  Korsgaard argues\nthat to will some end, you must at least take that end to be good in\nsome sense, and you must also think that there is a reason for\npursuing that end (246, 250–1).  But it seems possible for one\nto have some akratic end while failing to see anything even pro\ntanto good about it, or any reason to pursue it (Wallace 2006,\n§1).  And it’s clear that one could display instrumental\nrationality or irrationality relative to these akratic ends.  So,\nKorsgaard’s view seems unable to explain the authority of instrumental\nrationality with respect to such ends—ends that an\nagent has but doesn’t prescribe to herself. Korsgaard offers a second Kantian explanation of the authority of \ninstrumental rationality.  She argues that incessant instrumental \nirrationality threatens one’s status as an agent: But this argument doesn’t provide a reason to conform to the\ninstrumental principle in every case in which the instrumental\nprinciple is applicable.  Rather, it provides a reason to do so only\nwhen accompanied by enough other instances of non-conformity to\nthreaten one’s status as an agent (Kolodny 2005, 544; Shaver 2006,\n342). So, like the previous Kantian argument, and like the Hume’s\nskepticism discussed in §4.3, this argument\nalso fails to explain why instrumental rationality applies in every\ncase in which it does.","contact.mail":"jbrunero2@unl.edu","contact.domain":"unl.edu"}]
