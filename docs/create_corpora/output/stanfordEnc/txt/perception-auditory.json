What do we hear? What are the objects of auditory\nawareness? What is the content of audition? Is hearing spatial? How\ndoes audition differ from vision and other sense modalities? How does\nthe perception of sounds differ from that of colors and ordinary\nobjects? This entry presents the main debates in this developing area\nand discusses promising avenues for future inquiry. It discusses the\nmotivation for exploring non-visual modalities, how audition bears on\ntheorizing about perception, and questions concerning the objects,\ncontents, phenomenology, varieties, and bounds of auditory\nperception.\n\nThe philosophy of sounds and auditory perception is one area of the\nphilosophy of perception that reaches beyond vision for insights about\nthe nature, objects, contents, and varieties of perception. This entry\ncharacterizes central issues in the philosophy of auditory perception,\nmany of which bear upon theorizing about perception more generally,\nand it mentions outstanding questions and promising future areas for\ninquiry in this developing literature. Before beginning the\nsubstantive discussion of audition itself, it is worthwhile to discuss\nthe motivation and rationale for this kind of work. \nPhilosophical thinking about perception has focused predominantly on\nvision. The philosophical puzzle of perception and its proposed\nsolutions have been shaped by a concern for visual experience and\nvisual illusions. Questions and proposals about the nature of\nperceptual content have been framed and evaluated in visual terms, and\ndetailed accounts of what we perceive frequently address just the\nvisual case. Vision informs our understanding of perception’s\nepistemological role and of its role in guiding action. It is not a\ngreat exaggeration to say that much of the philosophy of perception\ntranslates roughly as philosophy of visual perception. \nRecently, however, other perceptual modalities have attracted\nattention (see, e.g., Stokes et al. 2015, Matthen 2015). In addition\nto auditory perception and the experience of sound, touch and tactile\nawareness have generated philosophical interest concerning, for\ninstance, the tactile and proprioceptive experience of space, the\nobjects of touch, whether contact is required for touch, and whether\ndistinct modalities detect pressure, heat, and pain (see, e.g.,\nO’Shaughnessy 1989, Martin 1993, Scott 2001, Fulkerson 2013,\n2016). The unique phenomenology of olfaction and smells has been used\nto argue that vision is atypical in supporting the transparency of\nperceptual experience (Lycan 2000, 282; cf. Batty 2010) and that\nperceptual objectivity does not require spatiality (Smith 2002, ch 5).\nLycan (2000) even suggests that the philosophy of perception would\nhave taken a different course had it focused upon olfaction instead of\nvision (see also Batty 2011). Some authors have appealed to taste and\nflavor to challenge traditional ways of dividing and counting senses\n(Smith 2015; cf. Richardson 2013). \nThis kind of work is philosophically interesting in its own right. But\nit is also worthwhile because theorizing about perception commonly\naims to address general questions about perception, rather than\nconcerns specific to vision. Hope for a comprehensive and general\nunderstanding of perception rests upon extending and testing claims,\narguments, and theories beyond vision. One might view work on\nnon-visual modalities as filling out the particulars required for a\nthoroughly detailed account of perceiving that applies not just to\nvision but across the modalities. At least three approaches might be\nadopted, with potential for increasingly revisionist outcomes. \nFirst, one might take work on non-visual modalities as\ntranslating what we have learned from the visual case into\nterms that apply to other modalities. This approach is relatively\nconservative. It assumes that vision is representative or paradigmatic\nand that we have a good understanding of perception that is derived\nfrom the case of vision. One example of this kind of approach would be\nto develop an account of the representational content of auditory\nexperience. \nSecond, considering other modalities might extend our\nvision-based understanding of perception. Non-visual cases might draw\nattention to new kinds of phenomena that are missing from or not\nsalient in vision. If so, a vision-based account of perception is\nsatisfactory as far as it goes, but it leaves out critical pieces. For\nexample, speech perception, multimodal perception, and flavor\nperception might involve novel kinds of perceptual phenomena absent\nfrom the visual case. \nThird, considering other modalities might challenge\nvision-based claims about perception. If falsifying evidence is\ndiscovered in non-visual cases, then theorizing beyond vision may\nforce revision of general claims about perception that are supported\nby vision. For example, if olfactory experience is not diaphanous, but\nolfactory experience is perceptual, the transparency thesis for\nperceptual experience fails. \nFinally, we might attempt to determine whether any unified\naccount exists that applies generally to all of the perceptual\nmodalities. We can ask this question either at the level of quite\nspecific claims, such as those concerning the objects of perception or\nthe nature and structure of content. We can ask it about the\nrelationships among perceiving, believing, and acting. Or we can ask\nit about the general theory of necessary and sufficient conditions for\nperceiving. Some philosophers, impressed by findings concerning\nnon-visual modalities, express skepticism whether a unified theory\nexists (e.g., Martin 1992). \nWhatever the approach, extending our knowledge about perception beyond\nthe visual requires systematic attention to individual modalities as\nwell as careful accounting in order to determine how the results bear\non general questions about perception. Whatever the outcome, audition\nis a rich subject matter in its own right, and investigating this\nsubject matter is crucial to our overall understanding of\nperception. \nWhat do we hear? One way to address this question concerns the\nobjects of auditory perception. \nIn the first instance, typical human perceivers hear sounds. It\nis plausible that sounds are objects of auditory perception. \nWhat are sounds? Sounds traditionally have been counted with colors,\nsmells, and tastes as secondary, sensible, or\nsensory qualities (see, e.g., Locke 1689/1975, Pasnau\n1999, 2000, Leddington 2019). However, recently it has been proposed\nthat sounds are individuals to which sensible features are\nattributed. In particular, several philosophers have proposed that\nsounds are public, distally-located, event-like individuals (Casati\nand Dokic 1994, 2005, O’Callaghan 2007, Matthen 2010). \nFour questions about audition’s objects define the debate and\nconstrain theories of sound (see also the entry on\n sounds,\n for extensive discussion). \nAre sounds private or public? Maclachlan (1989) argues that the sounds\nwe hear are sensations (rather than, for instance, the pressure\nwaves that cause auditory experiences). Such sensations are internal\nand private, and we experience them directly, or without apparent\nmediation. On Maclachlan’s account, we hear the ordinary things\nand happenings that are the sources of sounds only\nindirectly, by means of inference from auditory data. \nMaclachlan’s story is noteworthy partly because he uses hearing\nand sounds to motivate a general claim about perception. He claims\nthat what seems perfectly intuitive and obvious in the case of sounds\nand hearing—that something other than material objects are the\ndirect objects of hearing; that the direct objects of audition are\ninternal; and that we indirectly hear things in the world by hearing\ntheir sounds—helps us to discover what is true of all\nperception. According to Maclachlan, for instance, seeing involves\ndirect awareness of sensations of patterns of light, while surfaces\nand ordinary objects figure only indirectly and thanks to inference\namong the intentional objects of sight. The case of sounds and\naudition is important because it reveals that perceiving involves\nawareness of sensations in the first instance, and of the external\nworld only indirectly. \nMaclachlan’s description of sounds and auditory experience has\nsome attractions. First, sounds are among the things we hear. And\nsounds are among the direct or immediate objects of audition in the\nrelatively innocuous sense that hearing a sound does not seem to\nrequire hearing as of something else. Hearing a collision, on the\nother hand, may seem to require awareness as of a sound. Furthermore,\nsounds are unlike the ordinary material objects (e.g., bottles and\nstaplers) we see. You cannot reach out and grab a sound, or determine\nits temperature. Instead, sounds may strike us as byproducts or\neffects of such ordinary things and their transactions. Sounds result\nfrom activities or interactions of material bodies and thus are\nexperienced as distinct or independent from them (cf. Nudds 2001).\nNevertheless, audition does afford some variety of awareness of the\nsources of sounds, or at least provides information about them. \nHowever, the claim that sounds are sensations is unattractive. Good\nreasons suggest that sounds are public rather than private, even if\nsounds are not identical with ordinary objects and events such as\nclothespins and collisions. Suppose I am near the stage in a hall\nlistening to some music, and that I have a headache. It is a confusion\nto think you could feel my headache, but I assume you hear the sounds\nI hear. Suppose I move to the back of the hall, and the headache then\ngets better. My experience of the sounds of the music differs once I\nam at the back of the room, and my experience of the headache differs.\nThe sound of the music itself need not differ (the musicians could\nmake the same sounds), but the headache itself changes. The sounds can\ncontinue once I leave the room, but if I stop experiencing the\nheadache, it is gone. Moreover, the notion of an unfelt headache is\npuzzling, but it makes good sense to say that a tree makes a sound\nwhen it falls in the woods without being heard. Finally, tinnitus, or\nringing of the ears, is an illusory or hallucinatory experience as of\na sound, but received wisdom maintains that there are no illusory\nheadaches. \nThis suggests that audition does not provide special reasons to\nbelieve that the objects of perception are private sensations. Sounds,\nconstrued as objects of auditory perception, plausibly inhabit the\npublic world. (See the section\n 3.1 Spatial Hearing\n for further discussion.) \nAre sounds proximal or distal? The customary science-based view holds\nthat sounds are pressure waves that travel through a medium (see also\nSorensen 2008). On this account, sounds are caused by objects and\nevents such as collisions, and sounds cause auditory experiences.\nHowever, sounds are not auditorily experienced to travel through the\nsurrounding medium as waves do. Thus, if sounds are waves, then the\nsounds we hear may be proximal, located at the ear of the hearer. \nAlternatively, some have argued that audition presents sounds as being\nlocated in some direction at a distance (Pasnau 1999,\nO’Callaghan 2007, ch. 3, 2010). On such an account, sounds\ncommonly appear auditorily to be in the neighborhood of their sources\nand thereby furnish useful information about the locations of those\nsources. The sound of the drumming across the street seems to come\nfrom across the street but does not seem audibly to travel. When\nsounds do appear to fill a room, sound seems located all around.\nSounds that seem to “bounce” around a room appear\nintermittently at different locations rather than as traveling\ncontinuously from place to place. Experiencing a missile-like sound\nspeeding towards your ears illustrates the contrast with ordinary\nhearing (O’Callaghan 2007, 35). Sounds, according to this\nconception, ordinarily appear to have distal locations and to remain\nstationary relative to their sources. \nIf sounds are not usually experienced to travel, then unless auditory\nexperience is illusory with respect to the apparent locations of\nsounds, sounds themselves do not travel. Sounds thus are not identical\nwith and do not supervene locally upon the waves, since waves travel\n(Pasnau 1999). Several philosophers have argued on these and related\ngrounds that sounds are located distally, near their sources (Pasnau\n1999, Casati and Dokic 2005, O’Callaghan 2007). On this view,\npressure waves bear information about sounds and are the proximal\ncauses of auditory experiences, but are not identical with sounds. \nOne might object by resisting the phenomenological claim that we\nexperience sounds as distally located, for instance by suggesting that\naudition is aspatial, or that audition is spatial but sound\nsources rather than sounds are auditorily localized (see\nsection\n 3.1 Spatial Hearing\n for further discussion). Or, one might accept some measure of\nillusion. Another possibility is that we experience only a small\nsubset of the locations sounds occupy during their lifetimes (for\ninstance, while at their sources), and simply fail to experience where\nthey are at other times. This avoids ascribing illusion. Finally,\nFowler (2013) argues indirectly on the basis of echoes against distal\ntheories of sound. \nAre sounds properties or individuals? Among both proximal and distal\ntheories, disagreement exists concerning the ontological category to\nwhich sounds belong. Philosophers traditionally have understood sounds\nas properties—either as sensible or secondary qualities, or as\nthe categorical or physical properties that ground powers to affect\nsubjects. Commonly, sounds are attributed to the medium that\nintervenes between sources and perceivers. More recently, however,\nsome distal theorists have argued that sounds are properties of what\nwe ordinarily understand as sound sources—bells and whistles\nhave or possess rather than make or\nproduce sounds. Pasnau (1999), for instance, claims that sounds\nare transient properties that are identical with or supervene upon\nvibrations of objects. Kulvicki (2008) argues against transience in an\nattempt to subsume sounds to the model of colors, and claims that\nsounds are persistent, stable dispositional properties of objects to\nvibrate in response to being “thwacked”. He distinguishes\n“having” a stable sound from “making” a sound\non some occasion (manifesting the stable disposition). This account\nimplies that sounds sometimes make sounds they do not have, and that\nthey have sounds when silent. One also might ask whether events such\nas collisions and strummings, rather than objects, bear sounds.\nLeddington (2019) recently has defended such an account. \nA revisionist challenge comes from those who argue that sounds are\nindividuals rather than properties. Several arguments support\nthis understanding. First, empirical work on auditory scene\nanalysis suggests that one primary task of audition is to carve up\nthe acoustic scene into distinct sounds, each of which may possess its\nown pitch, timbre, and loudness (Bregman 1990). Multiple distinct\nsounds with different audible attributes can be heard simultaneously.\nAn analog of Jackson’s (1977, see also Clark 2000) many\nproperties problem thus arises for audition since feature\nawareness alone cannot explain the bundling or grouping of audible\nattributes into distinct sounds. Such bundling or grouping of audible\nfeatures suggests that sounds are perceptible individuals to which\nthese features are attributed. \nFurthermore, the temporal characteristics of experienced sounds\nsuggest that sounds are not simple qualities. Sounds audibly seem to\npersist through time and to survive change. A particular sound, such\nas that of an emergency siren, might begin high-pitched and loud and\nend low-pitched and soft. This suggests that sounds are individuals\nthat bear different features at different times, rather than sensible\nqualities. \nSeveral responses to these arguments are available (see Cohen 2009 for\nthe most developed reply). One might argue that sounds are complex\nproperties, such as pitch-timbre-loudness complexes, instantiated at a\ntime. To account for feature binding, one might hold that such complex\nproperties are ascribed to ordinary objects such as bells and\nwhistles. Or, one might hold that they are particularized properties,\nsuch as tropes. To accommodate sounds that survive change through\ntime, a property account could hold that sounds are yet more complex\nproperties that have patterns of change built into their identity\nconditions. However, any such view differs a great deal from the\nfamiliar secondary or sensible quality view pioneered by Locke. Pitch,\ntimbre, and loudness are better candidates for simple sensible\nfeatures in audition (see section\n 3.2 Audible Qualities).\n  \nIf sounds are individuals, are they object-like or event-like\nindividuals? Intuitively, the material objects we see are capable of\nexisting wholly at any given moment, and all that is required to\nperceptually recognize such individuals is present at a moment. On the\nother hand, event-like individuals occupy time and need not exist\nwholly at any given moment. Their individuation and recognition\nfrequently appeal to patterns of features over time. Event-like\nindividuals intuitively comprise temporal parts, while object-like\nindividuals intuitively do not. The issue here is not the truth of\nendurantism or perdurantism as an account of the persistence of\nobjects or events. Instead, the issue concerns a difference in how we\nperceptually individuate, experience, and recognize individuals. \nNo contemporary philosopher has yet claimed that sounds are objects\nin the ordinary sense. Those who argue that sounds are\nindividuals commonly point out that sounds not only persist and\nsurvive change (as do ordinary material objects), but also\nrequire time to occur or unfold. It is difficult to imagine an\ninstantaneous sound, or one that lacks duration. Sounds are not\ncommonly treated as existing wholly at a given moment during their\nduration. Indeed, the identities of many common sounds are tied to\npatterns of change in qualities through time. The sound of an\nambulance siren differs from that of a police siren precisely because\nthe two differ in patterns of qualitative change through time. The\nsound of the spoken word ‘team’ differs from that of\n‘meat’ because each instantiates a common set of audible\nqualities in a different temporal pattern. These considerations\nsupport the view that sounds are event-like individuals (see Casati\nand Dokic 1994, 2005, Scruton 1997, O’Callaghan 2007, Matthen\n2010). \nThis may bear on debates about persistence in the following way.\nDifferences in the intuitive plausibility of endurantism and\nperdurantism may be grounded in facts about perception. In particular,\nvision may treat objects as persisting by enduring or being wholly\npresent at each time at which they exist, while audition may treat its\nobjects as persisting by perduring or having temporal parts. This may\nstem from differences in perceptual organization. For instance,\nexhibiting a visible property profile at a time may suffice for being\na visual object of a given sort, while being an audible object of a\ngiven sort may require exhibiting an audible property profile over\ntime. \nThough most philosophers construe sounds either as properties or as\nevent-like individuals (see section\n 2.1 Sounds),\n psychologists commonly have discussed auditory objects (see,\ne.g., Kubovy and Van Valkenburg 2001, Griffiths and Warren 2004, Heald\net al. 2017). The target of such discussion is not simply\naudition’s intentional objects or proper (specific\nto audition) objects. The intended analogy is with visual\nobjects. Talk of auditory objects gestures at the visual processes\ninvolved in perceptually discriminating, attentively tracking,\nrecognizing and categorizing ordinary material objects. What justifies\ntalk of object perception in audition? \nFirst of all, humans typically do not auditorily perceive\nthree-dimensional, bounded material objects as such, though it\nis plausible to think we visually perceive them. Hearing does not\nresolve the edges, boundaries, and filled volumes in space that I see,\nand I do not hear audible items to complete spatially behind occluders\nas do visible surfaces of objects. If perceiving a three-dimensional\nobject requires awareness of its edges, boundaries, and extension,\nperhaps in order to discriminate it from its surroundings, humans\ntypically do not auditorily perceive such objects. \nNevertheless, striking and illuminating parallels do exist between the\nperceptual processes and experiences that take place in vision and\naudition. Such parallels may warrant talk of object perception in a\nmore general sense that is common to both vision and audition\n(O’Callaghan 2008a). \nPerceiving objects requires parsing a perceptual scene into distinct\nunits that one can attend to and distinguish from each other\nand from a background. In vision, bounded, cohesive collections of\nsurfaces that are extended in space and that persist through time play\nthis role (see, e.g., Spelke 1990, Nakayama et al. 1995, Leslie et al.\n1998, Scholl 2001, Matthen 2005). In audition, as in vision, multiple\ndistinct perceptible individuals might exist simultaneously, and each\nmight persist and survive change (see the discussion of auditory scene\nanalysis in section\n 2.1 Sounds).\n A critical difference, however, is that while vision’s objects\nare extended in space, and are individuated and recognized primarily\nin virtue of spatial characteristics, audible individuals are extended\nin time, and are perceptually individuated and recognized primarily in\nvirtue of pitch and temporal characteristics (see, e.g., Bregman 1990,\nKubovy and Van Valkenburg 2001). For instance, audible individuals\nhave temporal edges and boundaries, and boundary elements can belong\nonly to a single audible individual. They also are susceptible to\nfigure-ground effects over time. One can, for instance, shift\nattention among continuous audible individuals that differ in pitch.\nFurthermore, they are susceptible to completion effects over time in\nmuch the same way that visible objects are perceptually completed in\nspace. Seeing a single visible region to continue behind a barrier is\nanalogous to hearing a sound stream to continue through masking noise,\nwhich may take place even when there is no corresponding signal\n(Bregman 1990, 28). Finally, multiple distinct, discrete audible\nindividuals, such as the temporally bounded notes in a tune, can form\naudible streams that comprise a single perceptible unit. Such\nstreams are subject to figure-ground shifts, and, like collections of\nsurfaces, they can be attentively tracked through changes to their\nfeatures and to one’s perspective. Though such complex audible\nindividuals include sounds, they comprise temporally unified\ncollections of sounds and silence that are analogous to spatially\ncomplex visible objects, such as tractors. \nSuch audible individuals are temporally extended and bounded, serve as\nthe locus for auditory attention, prompt completion effects, and are\nsubject to figure-ground distinctions in pitch space. For these\nreasons, the auditory processes involved in their perception parallel\nthose involved in the visual perception of ordinary three-dimensional\nobjects. The parallels suggest a shared sense in which vision and\naudition involve a more general form of object perception (see, e.g.,\nKubovy and Van Valkenburg 2001, Scholl 2001, Griffiths and Warren\n2004, O’Callaghan 2008a, Matthen 2010). \nWhat is the shared sense in which both visible and audible individuals\ndeserve to be called ‘objects’? Kubovy and Van Valkenburg\n(2001, 2003) define objecthood in terms of figure-ground segregation,\nwhich requires perceptual grouping. They propose the theory of\nindispensable attributes as an account of the necessary conditions\non perceptual grouping (see also Kubovy 1981). Indispensable\nattributes for a modality are those without which perceptual\nnumerosity is impossible. They claim that while space and time are\nindispensable attributes for vision (and color is not), pitch and time\nare indispensable attributes for auditory objects. Though they are\nmore skeptical about whether audition parallels vision, Griffiths and\nWarren (2004) sympathize with a figure-ground characterization but\nsuggest a working notion of an auditory object defined in terms of\n“an acoustic experience that produces a two-dimensional image\nwith frequency and time dimensions” (Griffiths and Warren 2004,\n891). \nO’Callaghan (2008a) proposes that both visible and audible\nobjects are mereologically complex individuals, though their mereology\ndiffers in noteworthy respects. While vision’s objects possess a\nspatial mereology and are individuated and tracked in terms of spatial\nfeatures, audition’s objects have a temporal mereology and are\nindividuated and tracked in terms of both pitch and temporal\ncharacteristics. Discussion of auditory objects thus draws attention\nto two roles that space plays in vision. First, there is the role of\nspace in determining the structure internal to visible objects, which\nfacilitates identifying and recognizing visible objects. Second, space\nserves as the external structure among visible objects, and is\ncritical in distinguishing objects from each other. In audition, time\nplays a role similar to space in vision in determining the structure\ninternal to auditory objects. Pitch, on the other hand, serves as an\nexternal structural framework, along with space, that helps to\ndistinguish among audible individuals. \nWhy is it useful to perceive such individuals in audition? One\npromising account is that they provide useful information about the\nhappenings that produce sounds. Carving the acoustic world into\nmereologically complex individuals informs us about what is going on\nin the extra-acoustic environment. It provides ecologically\nsignificant information about what the furniture is doing, rather than\njust how it is arranged. It is one thing to perceive a tree; it is\nanother to hear that it is falling behind you. \nDiscussion of auditory objects and accounts of their nature and\nperception is relatively new among philosophers (see, e.g.,\nO’Callaghan 2008a, and essays in Bullot and Egré 2010,\nincluding Matthen 2010, Nudds 2010). Such work has led to the\ndevelopment of general accounts of perceptual objects designed to\navoid visuocentrism (see, e.g., O’Callaghan 2016, Green 2019).\nThis area is ripe for philosophical contributions. \nSounds are among the objects of audition. Plausibly, so are complex,\ntemporally extended individuals composed of sounds. Do we hear\nanything else? Reflection suggests we hear things beyond sounds\nand sound complexes. In hearing sounds, one may seem to experience the\nbackfiring of the car or the banging of the drum. One might hold that\na primary part of audition’s function is to reveal sound\nsources, the things and happenings that make sounds. \nIf sounds were internal sensations or sense-data, then, as Maclachlan\n(1989) observes, we would hear sound sources only indirectly, in an\nepistemological sense, perhaps thanks to something akin to inference.\nAcquiring beliefs about the environment would require mediation by\npropositions connecting experienced internal sounds with environmental\ncauses. \nIf, however, sounds are properties attributed either to ordinary\nobjects, as Pasnau (1999) and Kulvicki (2008) hold, or to events, as\nLeddington (2019) holds, then hearing a tuba or the playing of a tuba\nmight only require hearing its sounds. Perceptually ascribing such\naudible attributes to their sources might ground epistemically\nunmediated awareness of tubas or their playings. \nHowever, the individuals to which audible attributes are perceptually\nattributed need not be identical with ordinary objects or events.\nInstead, audible attributes may belong in the first instance to\nsounds. Sounds plausibly are distinct from ordinary or extra-acoustic\nindividuals (O’Callaghan 2007, 2011). Suppose then that one\ncould not hear an ordinary object or event without there existing an\naudible sound, as well as that sounds can mislead about their sources\n(it might sound like drumming but be hammering). \nGiven this, forming beliefs about ordinary things and happenings\nconnected with sounds might seem to require inference, association, or\nsome otherwise cognitive process, and so awareness of a sound source\nmight appear to always involve more than perceptual awareness.\nAccording to such an account, awareness of environmental things and\nhappenings thanks to audition is epistemically mediated by awareness\nas of sounds and auditory objects, but does not itself constitute\nauditory perceptual awareness as of those things and happenings. You\nare inclined to think you hear the source because your representing or\nbeing aware of it co-occurs with, but is no more than a downstream\nconsequence triggered by, your auditory experience. \nSuch an account is not wholly satisfactory. First, the phenomenology\nof audition suggests something stronger than indirect, epistemically\nmediated awareness of things such as collisions or guitar strummings\nor lions roaring. Reflection suggests auditory awareness as of\ncollisions, strummings, and lions. Second, the capacity to refer\ndemonstratively to such things and events on auditory grounds also\nsuggests genuine perceptual awareness of them. Third, we commonly\nperceptually individuate sounds in terms of their apparent sources,\nand our taxonomy reflects this. “What did you hear?”\n“I heard paper ripping,” or, “The sound of a\ndripping faucet.” We distinguish two quite similar rattles once\nwe hear one as of a muffler clamp and the other as of a loose fender.\nFurthermore, characterizing certain audible features and explaining\nperceptual constancy effects involving such features requires appeal\nto sound sources. Handel says of timbre: “At this point, no\nknown acoustic invariants can be said to underlie timbre... The cues\nthat determine timbre quality are interdependent because all are\ndetermined by the method of sound production and the physical\nconstruction of the instrument” (Handel 1995, 441). Explaining\nloudness constancy—why moving to the back of the room does not\nchange how loudly the lecturer seems to speak—appeals to facts\nabout the sources of sounds (Zahorik and Wightman 2001). Auditory\nprocessing proceeds in accordance with natural constraints concerning\ncharacteristics of sound sources, and information concerning sources\nshapes how auditory experiences are organized. This is to say that\nprocesses responsible for auditory experience proceed as if acoustic\ninformation is information about sound sources. Finally,\naudition-guided action supports the claim that we hear such things and\nevents. Turning to look toward the source of a sound or ducking out of\nthe way of something we hear to be approaching—behaviors guided\nby auditory experience—would make little sense if we heard only\nsounds. In the first place, these reasons ground a case for thinking\nthat auditory perceptual experience does not strictly end with sounds\nand auditory objects. In particular, awareness as of a source, even if\ndependent upon awareness as of a sound, may be constitutive of\none’s auditory perceptual experience. \nThe main barrier to an alternative is that the relation between sounds\nand ordinary things or happenings is commonly understood as\ncausal (see, e.g., Nudds 2001). Awareness as of an effect does\nnot itself typically furnish epistemically unmediated awareness of its\ncause. Seeing smoke is not seeing fire. The right sort of dependence\nbetween characteristics of the experience and the cause is not\napparent, and awareness as of an effect does not by itself ground\nperceptual demonstratives that concern the cause. The metaphysical\nindirectness of the causal relation appears to block epistemic\ndirectness (see O’Callaghan 2011a for further discussion). \nIs there another explanatory route? Suppose that instead of a causal\nrelation, we understand the relationship between sounds and sources\nmereologically, or as one of part to whole (see\nO’Callaghan 2011a). Parthood frequently does ground perceptual\nawareness. For instance, seeing distinct parts of a surface\ninterrupted by an occluder leads to perceptual experience as of a\nsingle surface (imagine seeing a dog behind a picket fence). Seeing\nthe facing surfaces of a cube affords awareness as of a cube, and we\ncan attentively track that same cube as it rotates and reveals\ndifferent surfaces. Suppose, then, that a sound is an event-like\nindividual (recall, property accounts escape the worry). This event is\npart of a more encompassing event, such as a collision or the playing\nof a trumpet, that occurs in the environment and that includes the\nsound. So, the typical horse race includes the sounds, and you might\nauditorily perceive the racing in hearing some of its proper parts:\nthe sounds. More specifically, you may hear the galloping thanks to\nhearing the sounds it includes. You may fail to hear certain parts of\nthe racing event, such as the jockey’s glance back after\ncrossing the wire, but you also fail to see parts of the race, such as\nthe misstep of the horse in second place. If the sounds are akin to\nthe audible “profile” of the event, analogous to the\nvisible surfaces of objects and visible parts of events, you might\nthen enjoy auditory awareness as of the galloping of the horses in\nvirtue of your awareness as of the sounds of the hooves. The sound is\nnot identical with the galloping, and it is not just a property or a\ncausal byproduct of the galloping. It is a part of a particular event\nof galloping. The metaphysical relation of part to whole, in contrast\nto that between effect and cause, might ground the sort of\nepistemically unmediated awareness of interest (cf. Nakayama et al.\n1995, Bermúdez 2000, Noë 2004). Auditory perceptual\nawareness as of the whole may occur thanks to experiencing the\npart. \nOne objection is that this mereological account of the relation\nbetween sounds and sources cannot account for hearing ordinary\nobjects by hearing their sounds. You could not strictly hear a\ntuba by hearing its sound because a tuba is not an event of which a\nsound is a part. However, the sound is part of the event of playing\nthe tuba, and the tuba is a participant in that playing. So, though\nyou are not aware as of a tuba, you are aware as of an event that\ninvolves a tuba. That perhaps is enough to explain talk of hearing\ntubas and to assuage the worry (for further discussion, see Young\n2018). \nAnother more serious objection contends that the events we seem to\nhear are ones that do not constitutively involve sounds or that might\nhave taken place without sounds. For instance, we hear the collision,\nbut the collision is something that could have occurred in a vacuum\nand not made a sound. (Note that this differs from the claim discussed\nbelow according to which sounds are identical with source events and\nso inaudibly exist in vacuums.) If so, the collision and the sound\ndiffer and the collision does not strictly include a sound. The\ncollision therefore must have made the sound as a causal byproduct.\nThis suggests that, strictly speaking, you could not hear that very\ncollision event (since it causes the sound). The best response is to\nbite the bullet and accept that events that do occur or that could\noccur in vacuums cannot be heard since they include no sounds. This is\nnot so bad, since you could hear a different, more encompassing event\nthat includes a sound along with a collision. Alternatively, one might\nsay the very same event that occurs in a vacuum also could occur in\nair, but that it would have involved a sound had it occurred in air.\nIn that case, one can only hear such events when they occur in air and\ninclude a sound. The choice depends upon one’s metaphysics of\nevents. In either case, it seems reasonable that token events that do\nnot include sounds are inaudible. \nCasati et al. (2013) sidestep some of these concerns by rejecting the\ndistinction between sounds and events that are typically understood as\nsound sources. They propose to “Ockhamize” the\n“event sources” of sounds by identifying sounds with\nevents such as collisions and vibrations. The sound just is the\ncollision or the vibrating, whether or not it occurs in air. This\naccount implies that sounds could exist in vacuums. \nWhat hinges on the debate about hearing sources? The first upshot is\nepistemological and concerns the nature of the justification for\nempirical beliefs grounded in perceptual experience. The evidential\nstatus of beliefs about what one perceptually experiences differs from\nthat of beliefs about what is causally responsible for what one\nperceptually experiences. So, whether or not we hear sound sources\nimpacts the epistemology of audition. The second upshot concerns the\nrelation between audition and certain actions. If we hear only sounds\nand auditory objects, what appears to be effortless, auditorily guided\naction to avoid or orient toward sound sources requires another\nexplanation (because sounds are invisible and usually do no harm).\nFinally, it affects how we understand the adaptive significance of\naudition. Did audition evolve so as to furnish awareness of sounds\nalone, while leaving their environmental significance to\nextra-perceptual cognition, or did it evolve so as to furnish\nperceptual responsiveness to the sources of sounds? \nAnother way to address the question, “What do we hear?”\nconcerns the contents of auditory perception. Two topics are\nespecially noteworthy in the context of related debates about vision\nand its contents. The first concerns the whether audition has spatial\ncontent. The second concerns the perception of audible qualities.\nParallel questions can be raised without relying on the perceptual\ncontent framework, though important complications arise. \nOne topic where the contrast between vision and audition has been\nthought to be particularly philosophically significant concerns space.\nVision is a robustly spatial perceptual modality. Vision furnishes\nawareness of space and spatial features. Some claim vision has an\ninherently spatial structure, or, further, that vision’s spatial\nstructure is a necessary condition on being visually aware of things\nas independent from oneself. \nHearing also provides information about space—humans learn about\nspace on the basis of hearing. If audition represents space or spatial\nfeatures, there is a natural account of being so informed. We might\nform beliefs about spatial features of environments on the basis of\nauditory perceptual experiences simply by accepting or endorsing what\nis apparent in having those experiences. \nBut learning about spatial features on the basis of audition and\naudition’s bearing information about space both are consistent\nwith entirely aspatial auditory phenomenology. For instance, volume\nmight bear information about distance, and differences in volume at\nthe two ears might bear information about direction. In that case,\naudition bears information about space, and learning about space on\nthe basis of audition is possible, but it does not follow that\nauditory experience is spatial or that audition represents space. \nNotably, a tradition of skepticism about audition’s spatiality\nexists in philosophy. Certainly, our capacity to glean information\nabout space is less acute in audition than in vision. Vision reveals\nfine-grained spatial details that audition cannot convey, such as\npatterns and textures. But philosophers who are skeptical about\nspatial audition are not just concerned about a difference in spatial\nacuity between audition and vision. Malpas says of the\nexpression, ‘the location of sound’: \nO’Shaughnessy states, “…We absolutely never\nimmediately perceive sounds to be at any place. (Inference from\nauditory data being another thing)” (O’Shaughnessy 2002,\n446). The claim is that, in contrast to visible objects, audible\nsounds are not experienced as having locations. Rather, we determine\nthe places of sounds and sources from acoustic features, such as\nloudness and interaural differences, that bear information about\ndistance and direction. We do not auditorily experience spatial\nfeatures. \nThis debate, and the purported contrast between vision and audition,\nhas consequences for perceptual theorizing. One route to the\nconclusion that hearing sounds involves auditory awareness of\nsensations involves denying that audition satisfies spatial\nprerequisites on experiencing sounds as objective or public. For\ninstance, Maclachlan (1989) claims that audition’s\nphenomenology—in particular, its aspatial\nphenomenology—provides reasons to think sounds are sensations.\nComparing sounds with pains, which we readily recognize as sensations,\nhe says, “[A]lthough the sounds we hear are just as much effects\nproduced in us as are the pains produced by pins and mosquitoes,\nthere is no variety in the location of these effects [the\nsounds]. Because of the lack of contrast, we are not even aware that\nthe sounds we hear are bodily sensations” (Maclachlan 1989, 31,\nmy emphasis). Maclachlan means that, in contrast even to the case of\npains, which are felt at different bodily locations, sounds are not\nexperienced to be at differing locations, and so we are not even\ninclined to recognize that they are bodily sensations. Maclachlan then\nsuggests that we associate sounds with things and happenings\noutside the body rather than appreciate that they are effects in us.\nGiven the lack of spatial variation among experienced sounds,\nwe projectively associate sounds with distal sources. This explanation\nassumes that experienced sounds exhibit no audibly apparent spatial\nvariation: sounds seem located at the ears or lack apparent location\naltogether. Denying that auditory experiences present sounds at\nvarying locations beyond the ears invites difficulty in finding a\nplace for sounds in the world. If audition is wholly aspatial, this\nmay encourage a retreat to the view that sounds lack locations outside\nthe mind. \nThis kind of strategy has companions and precursors. Lycan’s\nsuggestion that olfactory experiences are apparent as modifications of\none’s own consciousness depends heavily on the aspatial\nphenomenology of olfactory experience (Lycan 2000, 278–82). Each\nrecalls the Kantian claim that objectivity requires space, or that\ngrasping something as independent from oneself requires the experience\nof space, a version of which is deployed by Strawson (1959, ch 2) in\nhis famous discussion of sounds. \nTwo lines of response are open. The first appeals to the thriving\nempirical research program in “spatial hearing”\n(see, e.g., Blauert 1997). Scientists aim to discover the cues and\nperceptual mechanisms that ground spatial audition, such as interaural\ntime and level differences, secondary and reverberant signals, and\nhead-related transfer functions. Audition clearly cannot match\nvision’s singular acuity—vision’s resolution limit\nis nearly two orders of magnitude better than audition’s\n(Blauert 1997, 38–9). Nevertheless, this research strongly\nsupports the claim that human subjects auditorily perceive such\nspatial characteristics as direction and distance. \nSecond, a number of philosophers have objected on\nphenomenological grounds. Audition, they argue, involves\nexperiencing or perceptually representing such spatial characteristics\nas direction and distance (Pasnau 1999, Casati and Dokic 2005, Matthen\n2005, O’Callaghan 2007, 2010). Introspection and performance\nsupport the claim that sounds or sound sources are in many ordinary\ncases perceptually experienced as located in the environment at a\ndistance in some direction. We hear the sound of the knocking over\nnear the door; we hear footsteps approaching from behind and to the\nleft; hearing sound to “fill” a room is itself a form of\nspatial hearing. Though hearing is more error prone than vision, we\nfrequently do not need to work out the locations of sounds or\nsources—we simply hear them. \nA subtler form of skepticism about spatial audition aims just to block\nthe requirements on objectivity. Strawson (1959) famously argues in\nChapter 2 of Individuals that because auditory experience is\nnot intrinsically spatial—spatial concepts have no\nintrinsic auditory significance—a purely auditory experience\nwould be non-spatial. Thus, it would not satisfy the requirements on\nnon-solipsistic consciousness. Others have endorsed versions of\nStrawson’s claim. “[T]he truth of a proposition to the\neffect that there is a sound at such-and-such a position must consist\nin this: if someone was to go to that position, he would have certain\nauditory experiences,” states Evans (1980, 274). \nThe claim that audition is not intrinsically spatial admits at least\ntwo readings. First, since Strawson suggests that audition might\ninherit spatial content from other sense modalities, such as vision or\ntouch, it could mean that audition depends for its spatial\ncontent upon that of other modalities. If, unlike vision and touch,\naudition’s spatial capacities are parasitic upon those of other\nmodalities, audition is spatial only thanks to its relations to other\nintrinsically spatial modalities. Second, it might be understood as a\nclaim about the objects of audition. Strawson indicates that\nsounds themselves are not intrinsically spatial. He says that although\nsounds have pitch, timbre, and loudness, they lack “intrinsic\nspatial characteristics” (1959, 65). Since these interpretations\nare not clearly distinguished by Strawson, it is helpful to consider\nhis master argument. \nStrawson claims that a purely auditory experience would be\nnon-spatial. By “purely auditory experience” Strawson\nmeans an exclusively auditory experience, or an auditory experience in\nabsence of experience associated with any other modality. However, if\nany modality in isolation ever could ground spatial experience,\naudition could. On one hand, given the mechanisms of spatial hearing,\nit is empirically implausible that a normal acoustic environment with\nrich spatial cues would fail to produce even a minimally spatial\npurely auditory experience. Even listening only to stereo headphones\ncould produce a directional auditory experience. On the other hand, it\ndoes seem possible that there could be a non-spatial but\nimpoverished exclusively auditory experience if no binaural or\nother spatial cues were present. But similarly impoverished,\nnon-spatial experiences seem possible for other modalities. Consider\nvisually experiencing a uniform gray ganzfeld, or floating\nweightlessly in a uniformly warm bath. Neither provides the materials\nfor spatial concepts, so neither differs from audition in this\nrespect. One might contend that we therefore lack a good reason to\nthink that, in contrast to a purely visual or tactile\nexperience, a purely auditory experience would be an entirely\nnon-spatial experience (see O’Callaghan 2010). \nNudds (2001) suggests another way to understand the claim, and\ninterprets Strawson as making an observation about the internal\nstructure of audition: \nAudition, unlike vision, lacks a spatial structure or field, claims\nNudds. A purely auditory experience thus would not comprise a spatial\nfield into which individuals independent from oneself might figure.\nFollowing an example from Martin (1992), Nudds argues that while\nvision involves awareness of unoccupied locations, audition does not\ninvolve awareness of regions of space as empty or unoccupied.\nMartin’s example is seeing the space in the center of a ring\nas empty. In audition, Nudds claims, one never experiences a\nspace as empty or unoccupied. \nIn response, one might simply deny a difference between vision and\naudition in this respect. If one can attend to a location near the\ncenter of the visible ring as empty, one can attend to the location\nbetween the sounding alarm clock and the slamming door as a place\nwhere there is no audible sound—as acoustically empty space. Of\ncourse, auditory space generally is less replete than visual space,\nbut this is contingent. Consider seeing just a few stars flickering on\nand off against a dark sky. Since such an experience may have spatial\nstructure, and since it is analogous to audition, one might on these\ngrounds defend the claim that audition has spatial structure (see also\nYoung 2017). \nWhat about the second way mentioned above to understand\nStrawson’s claim? Though audition’s status as\nintrinsically spatial may not differ from that of vision or touch,\nperhaps sounds are not intrinsically spatial. But without further\nargument, or a commitment to a theory of sounds, it is difficult to\nstate confidently the intrinsic features of sounds and thus whether\nthey include spatial features. If, for instance, wavelength is among a\nsound’s intrinsic features, sounds are intrinsically\nspatial. \nNonetheless, the claim might be that, as they are perceptually\nexperienced to be, sounds lack apparent intrinsic or non-relational\nspatial features. Roughly, independent from spatial relations to other\nsounds, experienced sounds seem to lack internal spatial\nstructure. That is why you cannot auditorily experience the empty\nspace at the center of a sound or hear its edges. Interpreted as\nsuch—that sounds are not experienced or perceptually represented\nto have inherent spatial features—the claim is plausible (though\nconsider diffuse or spread out sounds in contrast to focused or\npinpoint sounds). It certainly marks an important difference from\nvision, whose objects frequently not only seem to have rich internal\nspatial structure, but also are individuated in terms of inherent\nspatial features. \nThis difference, however, does not ground an argument that any purely\nauditory experience is non-spatial or that sounds fail to satisfy the\nrequirement on objectivity, since sounds’ being experienced to\nhave internal, intrinsic, or inherent spatial characteristics is\nnecessary neither for spatial auditory experience nor to experience\nsounds as objective. Since sounds phenomenologically seem to be\nlocated in space and to bear extrinsic spatial relations to each\nother, auditory experience satisfies the requirements for objectivity,\nwhich need only secure the materials for a conception of a place for\nsounds to exist when not experienced. \nSo, vision and audition differ with respect to space in two ways.\nFirst, vision’s spatial acuity surpasses that of\naudition. Second, vision’s objects are perceptually experienced\nto have rich internal spatial structure, and audition’s\nare not. However, given the spatial characteristics evident in\naudition, such as direction and distance, the spatial status of\naudition presents no barrier to understanding its objects as\nperceiver-independent. The spatial aspects of auditory phenomenology\nthus may fail to ground an argument to the conclusion that sounds are\nmodifications of one’s consciousness. If that is the case, then\naudition provides no special intuitive support for accounts on which\nprivate entities are the direct objects of perception. \nAccording to theories in which sounds are individuals, sounds are not\nsecondary or sensible qualities. But, humans hear audible qualities,\nsuch as pitch, loudness, and timbre, that are analogous to colors,\ntastes, and scents. Thus, familiar accounts of colors and other\nsensible attributes or secondary qualities might apply to the audible\nqualities. For instance, pitches might be either dispositions to cause\ncertain kinds of experiences in suitable subjects, the physical or\ncategorical bases of such dispositions, sensations or projected\nfeatures of auditory experiences, or simple primitive properties of\n(actual or edenic) sounds. \nTradition suggests that the form of a philosophical account of visible\nqualities, such as color, and their perception applies to other\nsensible qualities, such as pitch, flavor, and smell, and their\nperception. Thus, according to tradition, if dispositionalism,\nphysicalism, projectivism, or primitivism about sensible qualities is\ntrue for features associated with one modality, it is true for\nfeatures associated with others. Despite tradition, we should be wary\nto accept that a theory of sensible qualities translates plausibly\nacross the senses. \nDebates about sensible qualities and their perception begin with\nconcerns about whether sensible features can be identified with or\nreduced to any objective physical features. What follows has two aims.\nThe first is to give a sense of how such debates might go in the case\nof audible qualities. The focus is on pitch, since pitch is often\ncompared to color, and the case of color is well known (for discussion\nof similar questions concerning timbre, see Isaac 2017). The second is\nto point out the most salient differences and similarities between the\ncases of color and pitch that impact the plausibility of arguments\ntranslated from one case to the other. \nFirst, I consider two noteworthy arguments that are founded on aspects\nof color perception. Each aims to establish that the colors we\nperceive cannot be identified with objective physical features.\nNeither argument transposes neatly to the case of pitch. Thus, we\nshould not assume arguments that are effective in the case of color\nhave equal force when applied to other sensible qualities. Color\nperhaps is a uniquely difficult case. \nSecond, however, I discuss two respects in which pitch experience is\nsimilar to color experience. It is instructive that these aspects of\npitch experience do raise difficulties for an objective physical\naccount of pitch that are familiar from the case of color. \nWhat are pitch, timbre, and loudness? Pitch is a dimension along which\ntones can be ordered according to apparent “height”. The\npitch of fingernails scratching a blackboard generally is higher than\nthat of thumping a washtub. Loudness can be glossed as the volume,\nintensity, or quantity of sound. A jet plane makes louder sounds than\na model plane. Timbre is more difficult to describe. Timbre is a\nquality in which sounds that share pitch and loudness might differ.\nSo, a violin, a cello, and a piano all playing the same note differ in\ntimbre. Sometimes timbre is called “tone color”. \nPhysics and psychoacoustics show that properties including frequency,\namplitude, and wave shape determine the audible qualities sounds\n(auditorily) appear to have. To simplify, take the case of pitch,\nsince pitch often is compared to color. Not all sounds appear to have\npitch. Some sounds appear to have pitch thanks to a simple,\nsinusoidal pattern of vibration at some frequency in an object\nor in the air. Some sounds appear pitched thanks to a complex pattern\nof vibration that can be decomposed into sinusoidal constituents at\nmultiple frequencies, since any pattern of vibration can be analyzed\nas some combination of simple sinusoids. Sounds appear pitched,\nhowever, just when they have sinusoidal constituents, or\npartials, that all are integer multiples of a common\nfundamental frequency. Sounds with pitch thus correspond to\nregular or periodic patterns of vibration that differ in\nfundamental frequency and complexity. Simple sinusoids and complex\nwaveforms match in pitch (though they typically differ in timbre) when\nthey share fundamental frequency. This is true even when the complex\ntone lacks a sinusoidal constituent at the fundamental frequency,\nwhich is referred to as the phenomenon of the missing\nfundamental. \nA straightforward account identifies pitch with periodicity (perhaps\nwithin some range). Having pitch is being periodic (see\nO’Callaghan 2007, ch. 6). Periodicity can be expressed in terms\nof fundamental frequency, so individual pitches are fundamental\nfrequencies. This has advantages as an account of pitch. It captures\nthe linear ordering of pitches. It also explains the musical\nintervals, such as the octave, fifth, and fourth, for example, which\nare pitch relations that hold among periodic tones. Musical intervals\ncorrespond to whole-number ratios between fundamental frequencies.\nSounds that differ by an octave have fundamental frequencies that\nstand in 1:2 ratios. Fifths involve a 2:3 relationship, fourths are\n3:4, and so on. This also allows us to revise the linear pitch\nordering to accommodate the auditory sense in which tones that differ\nby an octave nonetheless are the same pitch. If the pitch ordering is\nrepresented as a helix, upon which successive octave-related tones\nfall at a common angular position, each full rotation represents\ndoubling frequency. \nIs the periodicity theory of pitch plausible as an account of the\naudible features we perceive when hearing sounds? If so, then\nobjective physicalism about at least some sensible qualities might\nsucceed. \nThe periodicity theory of pitch fares better on two counts than\ntheories that identify colors with objective physical properties. \nFirst, consider the phenomenological distinction between unique\nand binary hues. Some colors appear to incorporate other\ncolors, and some do not. Purple, for instance, appears both reddish\nand bluish; red just looks red. Some philosophers contend that the\nleading physical theories of color cannot explain the unique-binary\ndistinction without essentially invoking the color experiences of\nsubjects. How, for instance, do reflectance classes identified with\nunique hues differ from those associated with binary hues? \nConsider a related issue concerning pitch. Some tones with pitch sound\nsimple, while other pitched tones, such as sounds of musical\ninstruments, auditorily appear to be complex and to have\ndiscernible components. However, the difference between audibly simple\nand audibly complex pitched tones is captured by the simplicity\nor complexity of a sound’s partials. Simple tones are sinusoids,\nand complex tones have multiple overtones. So, one response is to hold\nthat the unique-binary color distinction and the simple-complex pitch\ndistinction are disanalogous. Unlike the case of color, one might\ncontend, no pitch that is essentially a mixture of other pitches\nsolely occupies a distinctive place in pitch space. \nSecond, consider metamerism. Some surfaces with very different\nreflectance characteristics match in color. Metameric pairs share no\nobvious objective physical property. Some philosophers argue that\nunless color experience fails to distinguish distinct colors, metamers\npreclude identifying colors with natural physical properties of\nsurfaces (see the entry on\n color). \nNow consider the case of pitch. Are there pitch metamers? Some sounds\nwith very different spectral frequency profiles match in pitch. A\nsimple sinusoidal tone at a given frequency matches the pitch of each\ncomplex tone with that fundamental frequency (even those that lack a\nconstituent at the fundamental). But, again, the case of pitch differs\nfrom the case of color. For each matching pitch, a single natural\nproperty does unify the class. The tones all share a fundamental\nfrequency. \nTwo kinds of argument familiar from the case of color are equally\npressing when applied to the case of pitch. \nFirst, arguments from intersubjective variation transpose.\nActual variations in frequency sensitivity exist among perceivers; for\ninstance, subjects differ in which frequency they identify as middle\nC. If there is no principled way to legislate whose experience is\nveridical, pitch might be subjective or perceiver-relative. One\nresponse is that, in contrast to the case of unique red, there is an\nobjective standard for middle C: fundamental frequency. But, whose\npitch experience has the normative significance to settle the\nfrequency of middle C? \nSome might wonder whether there is a pitch analog of the trouble posed\nby the kind of variation associated with spectrum inversion in\nthe case of color (see the entry on\n inverted qualia).\n Spectral shift in pitch, sometimes dramatic, commonly occurs after\ncochlear implant surgery. This is not spectral inversion for pitch;\nbut, a dramatic shift makes most of the same trouble as inversion. Not\nquite all the trouble, since cochlear implants preserve the pitch\nordering and its direction. But, there could be a cochlear implant\nthat switched the placement of electrodes sensitive to 100 hertz and\n1000 hertz, respectively; and there could be one that reversed the\nentire electrode ordering. This goes some distance to grounding the\nconceivability of a pitch inversion that reverses the height ordering\nof tones. \nSecond, consider an argument that frequencies cannot capture the\nrelational structure among the pitches. This is loosely\nanalogous to the argument that physicalism about color fails to\ncapture the relational structure of the hues—for instance, that\nred is more similar to orange than either is to green. In the case of\npitch, psychoacoustics experiments show that perceived pitch does not\nmap straightforwardly onto frequency. Though each unique pitch\ncorresponds to a unique frequency (or small frequency range), the\nrelations among apparent pitches do not match those among\nfrequencies. In particular, equivalent pitch intervals do not\ncorrespond to equal frequency intervals. For example, the effect upon\nperceived pitch of a 100 hertz change in frequency varies dramatically\nacross the frequency range. It is dramatic at low frequency and barely\ndetectable at high frequency. Similarly, doubling frequency does not\nmake for equivalent pitch intervals. A 1000 hertz tone must be tripled\nin frequency to produce the same increase in pitch as that produced by\nquadrupling the frequency of a 2000 hertz tone. Apparent pitch is a\ncomplex function of frequency; it is neither linear nor logarithmic\n(see, e.g., Hartmann 1997, ch 12, Gelfand 2004, ch 12, Zwicker and\nFastl 2006, ch 5). Pitch scales that capture the psychoacoustic data\nassign equal magnitudes, commonly measured in units called\nmels, to equal pitch intervals. The mel scale of pitch\nthus is an extensive or numerical pitch scale, in contrast to the\nintensive frequency scale for pitch. The former, but not the latter,\npreserves ratios among pitches. \nS. S. Stevens famously argued on the basis of results drawn from\npsychoacoustic experiments that pitch is not frequency (see, e.g.,\nStevens et al. 1937, Stevens and Volkmann 1940). In light of similar\nresults, contemporary psychoacoustics researchers commonly reject the\nidentification of pitch with frequency or periodicity. The received\nscientific view thus holds that pitch is a subjective or psychological\nquality that is no more than correlated with objective frequency (see,\ne.g., Gelfand 2004, Houtsma 1995). Pitch, on this understanding,\nbelongs only to experiences. The received view of pitch therefore\nimplies an error theory according to which pitch experience involves a\nwidespread projective illusion. \nWhat is the argument against the periodicity theory of pitch? Compare\nan argument against reflectance physicalism about color. Reflectance\nphysicalism identifies each hue with a class of reflectances.\nPeriodicity physicalism identifies each pitch with a fundamental\nfrequency. In both cases, each determinate sensible feature is\nidentified with a determinate physical property. In the color case, it\nis objected that reflectance classes do not bear the relations to each\nother that the colors bear. In the pitch case, the frequencies do not\nbear the relations to each other that the pitches bear. Thus, if the\nrelational features among a class of sensible qualities are essential\nto them, an account that does not accurately capture those relations\nfails. Frequencies, according to this line of argument, do not stand\nin the relations essential to pitch. \nThis, of course, is a quite general phenomenon among sensible\nqualities. Brightness and loudness vary logarithmically with simple\nphysical quantities. Even if we identified candidate molecules for\nsmells, nothing suggests physical similarities would mirror their\nolfactory similarities. \nIn the case of pitch and other sensible features that can be put in a\nlinear ordering, one might respond that the relational order is\nessential while the magnitudes are not. In that case, if pitch is\nfrequency, pitch experience has the right structure, but distorts\nmagnitudes of difference in pitch. This retains the periodicity theory\nand explains away the results in terms of pitch experiences. \nNonetheless, Pautz (2014, 3.5) has replied that this partial error\naccount cannot be reconciled with certain types of possible\nintersubjective difference. So, suppose instead we accept that the mel\nscale is well-founded and that it accurately captures essential\nrelationships among pitches. This does not by itself imply a\nprojective or subjective theory of pitch. Pitches might be\ndispositions to produce certain kinds of experiences, or they might be\nsimple or primitive properties. It also is open to seek a more\nadequate physical candidate for pitch. For instance, pitches might be\nfar more complex physical properties than frequencies. Such physical\nproperties may be of no interest in developing the simplest, most\ncomplete natural physical theory, but they may be anthropocentrically\ninteresting. \nIt is an important question whether a physical theory of sensible\nfeatures should just provide a physical candidate for each determinate\nsensible feature, or whether the physical relationships among those\nphysical candidates should capture the structural relations among\nsensible qualities (and, if so, which structural relations it should\ncapture). This is an example of how considering in detail the nature\nand the experience of sensible qualities other than color promises\ninsights into traditional debates concerning the sensible qualities.\nPautz (2014) offers an empirically-grounded argument concerning a\nvariety of sensible qualities, including audible qualities, that\nadvances such discussion. \nMusical listening is a topic that bears on questions about the\nrelationship between hearing sounds and hearing sources. While the\nphilosophy of music has its own vast literature (see the entry on\n the philosophy of music),\n musical experience has not been used as extensively to explore\ngeneral philosophical questions about auditory perception. This\nsection discusses links that are relevant to advancing philosophical\nwork on auditory perception. \nAn account of listening to pure or non-vocal music should capture the\naesthetic significance of musical listening. Appreciating music\nis appreciating sounds and sequences, arrangements, or structures of\nsounds. Thus, the temporal aspects of auditory experiences are\ncritical to appreciatively listening to music. \nOne might go further and hold that sounds are all that matters in\nmusic. In particular, some have argued that appreciatively listening\nto music demands listening in a way that abstracts from the\nenvironmental significance, and thus from the specific sources, of the\nsounds it includes (Scruton 1997, 2–3). Such acousmatic\nlistening involves experiencing sounds in a way that is\n“detached from the circumstances of their production,”\nrather than “as having a certain worldly cause” (Hamilton\n2007, 58; see also Hamilton 2009). Listening to music and being\nreceptive to its aesthetically relevant features requires not\nlistening to violins, horns, or brushes on snare drums. It requires\nhearing sounds and grasping them in a way removed from their common\nsources. Hearing a high fidelity recording thus furnishes an\naesthetically identical musical experience despite having a speaker\ncone rather than a violin as source. “The acousmatic experience\nof sound is precisely what is exploited by the art of music”\n(Scruton 1997, 3). \nThis suggests an intuitive difference between music and visual arts\nsuch as painting and sculpture. As Kivy (1991) explains, it is\ndifficult even with the most abstract paintings and sculptures to see\nthem in a way that takes them to be entirely formal or abstract. That\nis, it is difficult to avoid seeing pictures and sculptures as\nrepresentational. In contrast, it seems easier to listen attentively\nto the formal acoustical features of musical sounds, without being\ncompelled to think of what makes them. \nMusical listening thus may be thought to provide a prima facie\nargument against the claim that in hearing sounds one typically hears\nsound sources such as the strumming of guitars and bowing of violins.\nIf such “interested” audition were the rule, musical\nlistening would be far more challenging. \nAcousmatic experience, however, may be a matter of attention.\nNothing prevents focusing one’s attention on the sounds and\naudible qualities without attending to the instruments, acts, and\nevents that are their sources, even if each is auditorily available.\nThat musical listening requires effort and training supports the idea\nthat one can direct attention differently in auditory experience,\ndepending on one’s interests. Caring for an infant and safely\ncrossing the street require attending to sound sources, while\nlistening with aesthetic appreciation to a symphony may require\nabstracting from the circumstances of its production, such as the\nfinger movements of the oboist. This response holds that musical\nlistening is a matter of auditorily attending in a certain way. It is\nattending to features of sounds themselves, but does not imply failing\nto hear sound sources. \nThe acousmatic thesis is a limited view about which aspects of the\nthings one can auditory experience are aesthetically significant.\nThese include audible aspects of sounds themselves, but exclude, for\nexample, other contents of auditory experience. However, room exists\nfor debate over the aesthetically significant aspects of what you hear\n(see Hamilton 2007, 2009). For example, one might argue that live\nperformances have aesthetic advantages over recordings because one\nhears the performance of the sounds and songs, rather than\ntheir reproduction by loudspeakers (cf. Mag Uidhir 2007).\nCircumstances of sound production, such as that skillful gestures\ngenerate a certain passage, or that a particularly rare wood accounts\nfor a violin’s sounds, might be aesthetically relevant in a way\nthat outstrips the sounds, and some such features may be audible in\naddition to sounds. For instance, hearing the spatial characteristics\nof a performance may hold aesthetic significance beyond the tones and\nstructures admitted by traditional accounts of musical listening.\nComposers may even intend “spatial gestures” among aspects\nessential for the appreciation of a piece (see, e.g., Solomon 2007).\nTo imagine auditorily experiencing the spatial characteristics of\nmusic in a way entirely divorced from the environmental significance\nof the sounds is difficult. Appreciating the relationship between\nexperiences of sounds and of sources makes room for a view of the\naesthetic value of musical listening that is more liberal than\nacousmatic experience allows. \nSpeech perception presents uniquely difficult twists, and few\nphilosophers have confronted it directly (Appelbaum 1999, Trout 2001a,\nMatthen 2005, ch 9, and Remez and Trout 2009 are recent exceptions).\nSomething striking and qualitatively distinctive—perhaps\nuniquely human—seems to set the perception of speech apart from\nordinary hearing. The main philosophical issues about speech\nperception concern versions of the question, Is speech special? (See\nO’Callaghan 2015 for a comprehensive review and discussion.) \nHow does perceiving speech differ from perceiving ordinary\nnon-linguistic sounds? Listening to music and listening to speech each\ndiffer from listening to other environmental sounds in the following\nrespect. In each case, one’s interest in listening is to some\ndegree distanced from the specific environmental happenings involved\nin the production of sounds. \nBut this is true of listening to music and of listening to speech for\ndifferent reasons. In music, it is plausible that one’s interest\nis in the sounds themselves, rather than in the sources of their\nproduction. However, speech is a vehicle for conventional linguistic\nmeaning. In listening to speech, one’s main interest is in the\nmeanings, rather than in the sources of sound. Ultimately, the\ninformation conveyed is what matters. \nNevertheless, according to the most common philosophical\nunderstanding, perceiving spoken utterances is just a matter of\nhearing sounds. The sounds of speech are complex audible sound\nstructures. Listening to speech in a language you know typically\ninvolves grasping meanings, but grasping meanings requires\nfirst hearing the sounds of speech. According to this account,\ngrasping meanings itself is a matter of extra-perceptual\ncognition. \nThe commonplace view—that perceiving speech is a variety of\nordinary auditory perception that just involves hearing the sounds of\nspeech—has been challenged in a number of ways. The challenges\ndiffer in respect of how speech perception is held to differ from\nnon-linguistic audition. \nFirst, consider the objects of speech perception. What are the\nobjects of speech perception, and do they differ from those of\nordinary or non-linguistic auditory perception? According to the\ncommonplace understanding, hearing speech involves hearing sounds.\nThus, hearing spoken language shares perceptual objects with ordinary\naudition. Alternatively, one might hold that the objects of speech\nperception are not ordinary sounds at all. Perhaps they are\nlanguage-specific entities, such as phonemes or words.\nPerhaps, as some have argued, perceiving speech involves perceiving\narticulatory gestures or movements of the mouth and vocal\norgans (see the supplement on\n Speech Perception: Empirical and Theoretical Considerations).\n Note that if audition’s objects typically include distal\nevents, speech in this respect is not special, since its objects do\nnot belong to an entirely different kind from ordinary sounds.  \nSecond, consider the contents of speech perception. Does the\ncontent of speech perception differ from that of ordinary audition? If\nit does, how does the experience of perceiving speech differ from that\nof hearing ordinary sounds? Perceiving speech might involve hearing\nordinary sounds but auditorily ascribing distinctive features\nto them. These features might simply be, or comprise, finer grained\nqualitative and temporal acoustical details than non-linguistic sounds\naudibly possess. But perceiving speech also might involve perceiving\nsounds as belonging to language-specific types, such as\nphonemes, words, or other syntactic categories. \nFurthermore, speech perception’s contents might differ in a more\ndramatic way from those of non-linguistic audition. Listening with\nunderstanding to speech involves grasping meanings. The\ncommonplace view is conservative. It holds that grasping meanings is\nan act of the understanding rather than of audition. Thus, the\ndifference between the experience of listening to speech in a language\nyou know and the experience of listening to speech in a language you\ndo not know is entirely cognitive. \nBut one might think that there also is a perceptual difference.\nA liberal account of this perceptual difference holds that perceiving\nspeech in a language you know may involve hearing sounds as\nmeaningful or auditorily representing them as having semantic\nproperties (see, e.g., Siegel 2006, Bayne 2009, Azzouni 2013, Brogaard\n2018; cf. O’Callaghan 2011b, Reiland 2015). Alternatively, a\nmoderately liberal account holds that the perceptual experience of\nspeech in a language you know involves perceptually experiencing\nlanguage-specific but nevertheless non-semantic features. For\ninstance, O’Callaghan (2011b) argues that listening to speech in\na familiar language typical involves perceiving its phonological\nfeatures. \nThird, consider the processes responsible for speech\nperception. To what extent does perceiving speech implicate processes\nthat are continuous with those of ordinary or general audition, and to\nwhat extent does perceiving speech involve separate, distinctive, or\nmodular processes? While some defend general auditory accounts\nof speech perception (see, e.g, Holt and Lotto 2008), some argue that\nperceiving speech involves dedicated perceptual resources, or even an\nencapsulated perceptual system distinct from ordinary non-linguistic\naudition (see, e.g., Fodor 1983, Pinker 1994, Liberman 1996, Trout\n2001b). These arguments typically are grounded in several types of\nphenomena, including the multimodality of speech\nperception—visual cues about the movements of the mouth and\ntongue impact the experience of speech, as demonstrated by the McGurk\neffect (see the section\n 4.3 Crossmodal Influences);\n duplex perception—a particular stimulus sometimes\ncontributes simultaneously both to the experience of an ordinary sound\nand to that of a speech sound (Rand 1974); and the top-down\ninfluence of linguistic knowledge upon the experience of speech. A\nreasonable challenge is that each of these\ncharacteristics—multimodality, duplex perception, and top-down\ninfluence—also is displayed in general audition.  \nAuditory perception of speech is influenced by cues from vision and\ntouch (see Gick et al. 2008). The McGurk effect in speech perception\nleads to an illusory auditory experience caused by a visual stimulus\n(McGurk and Macdonald 1976). Do such multimodal effects occur in\nordinary audition? Visual and tactile cues commonly do shape auditory\nexperience. The ventriloquist illusion is an illusory auditory\nexperience of location that is produced by an apparent visible sound\nsource (see, e.g., Bertelson 1999). Audition even impacts experience\nin other modalities. The sound-induced flash effect involves a visual\nillusion as of seeing two consecutive flashes that is produced when a\nsingle flash is accompanied by two consecutive beeps (Shams et al.\n2000, 2002). Such crossmodal illusions demonstrate that auditory\nexperience is impacted by other modalities and that audition\ninfluences other modalities. In general, experiences associated with\none perceptual modality are influenced by stimulation to other sensory\nsystems. \nAn important question is whether the impact is merely causal, or\nwhether perception in one modality is somehow constitutively tied to\nother modalities. If, for instance, vision merely causally impacts\nyour auditory experience of a given sound, then processes associated\nwith audition might be proprietary and characterizable in terms that\ndo not appeal to other modalities. Relying on information from vision\nor touch could simply improve the existing capacity to perceive space,\ntime, or spoken language auditorily. On the other hand, coordination\nbetween audition and other senses could enable a new perceptual\ncapacity. In that case, audition might rely constitutively on another\nsense. \nA first step in resolving this question is recognizing that crossmodal\nillusions are not mere accidents. Instead, they are intelligible as\nthe results of adaptive perceptual strategies. In ordinary\ncircumstances, crossmodal processes serve to reduce or resolve\napparent conflicts in information drawn from several senses. In doing\nso, they tend to make perception more reliable overall. Thus,\ncrossmodal illusions differ from synaesthesia. Synaesthesia is\njust a kind of accident. It results from mere quirks of processing,\nand it always involves illusion (or else is accidentally veridical).\nCrossmodal recalibrations, in contrast, are best understood as\nattempts “to maintain a perceptual experience consonant with a\nunitary event” (Welch and Warren 1980, 638). \nIn the first place, the principled reconciliation of information drawn\nfrom different sensory sources suggests that audition is governed by\nextra-auditory perceptual constraints. Moreover, since conflict\nrequires a common subject matter, such constraints must concern common\nsources of stimulation to multiple senses. If so, audition and vision\nshare a perceptual concern for a common subject matter. And that\nconcern is reflected in the organization of auditory experience. But\nthis by itself does not establish constitutive dependence of audition\non another sense. \nHowever, the perceptual concern for a common subject matter could be\nreflected as such in certain forms of auditory experience. For\ninstance, the commonality may be experientially evident in jointly\nperceiving shared spatio-temporal features, or in the perceptual\nexperience of audio-visual intermodal feature binding. If so, some\nforms of auditory perceptual experience may share with vision a common\nmultimodal or amodal content or character (see O’Callaghan\n2008b, Clark 2011). More to the point, if coordination with another\nsense enables a new auditory capacity, then vision or touch could have\na constitutive rather than merely causal impact upon corresponding\nauditory experiences. \nWhat hangs on this? First, it bears on questions about\naudition’s content. If we cannot exhaustively characterize\nauditory experience in terms that are modality-specific or distinctive\nto audition, then we might hear as of things we can see or\nexperience with other senses. This is related to one puzzling question\nabout hearing sound sources: How could you hear as of something you\ncould see? Rather than just a claim about audition’s content\nthat requires further explanation, we now have a story about why\nthings like sound sources figure in the content of auditory\nexperience. Second, all of this may bear on how to delineate what\ncounts as auditory perception, as opposed to visual or even amodal\nperception. If hearing is systematically impacted by visual processes,\nand if it shares content and phenomenology with other sense\nexperiences, what are the boundaries of auditory perception?\nMultimodal perception may bear on the question of whether there are\nclear and significant distinctions among the sense modalities (cf.\nNudds 2003). Finally, multimodal perceptual experiences, illusions,\nand explanatory strategies may illuminate the phenomenological\nunity of experiences in different modalities, or the sense in\nwhich, for instance, an auditory experience and a visual experience of\nsome happening comprise a single encompassing experience (see the\nentry on\n the unity of consciousness).\n  \nWe can ask questions about the relationships among modalities in\ndifferent areas of explanatory concern. Worthwhile areas for attention\ninclude the objects, contents, and phenomenology of perception, as\nwell as perceptual processes and their architecture. Crossmodal and\nmultimodal considerations might shed doubt on whether vision-based\ntheorizing alone can deliver a complete understanding of perception\nand its contents. This approach constitutes an important\nmethodological advance in the philosophical study of perception (for\nfurther discussion, see O’Callaghan 2012, 2019, Matthen 2015,\nStokes et al. 2015). \nConsidering modalities other than vision enhances our understanding of\nperception. It is necessary to developing and vetting an adequate\ncomprehensive and general account of perception and its roles.\nAuditory perception is a rich territory for philosophical exploration\nin its own right, but it also provides a useful contrast case in which\nto evaluate claims about perception proposed in the context of vision.\nOne of the most promising directions for future work concerns the\nnature of the relationships among perceptual modalities, how these\nrelationships shape experience across modalities, and how they may\nprove essential to understanding perception itself. Philosophical work\non auditory perception thus is part of the advance beyond considering\nmodalities in isolation from each other.","contact.mail":"casey.ocallaghan@wustl.edu","contact.domain":"wustl.edu"}]
