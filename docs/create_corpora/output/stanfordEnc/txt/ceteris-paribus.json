Laws are usually believed to stand in tight relations to\nmany philosophical key concepts such as causation, explanation,\nconfirmation, determinism, and counterfactuals. Traditionally,\nphilosophers have focused on physical laws, which were taken to be at\nleast true, universal statements that support counterfactual claims.\nBut, although this claim about laws might be true with respect to\nphysics, laws in the special sciences (such as biology, psychology,\nand economics) appear to have—maybe not\nsurprisingly—different features than the laws of physics.\nSpecial science laws—for instance, the economic law “Under\nthe condition of perfect competition, an increase of demand of a\ncommodity leads to an increase of price, given that the quantity of\nthe supplied commodity remains constant” and, in biology,\nMendel’s Laws—are usually taken to “have\nexceptions”, to be “non-universal” or to be\n“ceteris paribus laws”. How and whether the laws\nof physics and the laws of the special sciences differ is one of the\ncrucial questions motivating the debate on ceteris paribus\nlaws. Another major, controversial question concerns the determination\nof the precise meaning of “ceteris paribus”.\nPhilosophers have attempted to explicate the meaning of ceteris\nparibus clauses in different ways. The question of meaning is\nconnected to the problem of empirical content, i.e., the question\nwhether ceteris paribus laws have non-trivial and empirically\ntestable content. Since many philosophers have argued that ceteris\nparibus laws lack empirically testable content, this problem\nconstitutes a major challenge to a theory of ceteris paribus\nlaws.\n\nIn philosophy of science and metaphysics, laws of nature take center\nstage: Many explications of philosophical key concepts in philosophy\nof science essentially rely on laws of nature. For instance, a\nmajority of theories of causation, explanation, confirmation,\ndeterminism, and counterfactuals presuppose laws of nature (see the\nSEP-entry on laws of nature). \nUntil the second half of the 20th century, certain characteristics of\nlaws of nature were taken for granted by philosophers of science: Laws\nof nature were taken to be true, logically contingent, universal\nstatements that support counterfactual claims. Laws were taken to play\na major role in explanation, induction, confirmation, causation, and\nin counterfactual reasoning. The paradigm cases for such laws were\ntaken from (fundamental) physics. Newton’s second law\n\\((F=ma)\\) or the Schrödinger-equation fit the\nbill of the traditional concept of a law of nature. Philosophers of\nscience were aware of the fact that there are hardly any universal\nlaws of this kind in biology, psychology, economics or other special\nsciences. This posed no problem as long as there was a consensus that\nthis might be conceived as a shortcoming of the special sciences.\nHowever, with the success especially of the biological sciences it\nbecame clear that there is genuine scientific knowledge that does not\nconform to the paradigm of physics. As a consequence, scientific\npractice in the special sciences was no longer taken to be deficient\nbut was analyzed as a legitimate practice different from physics. The\ngeneralizations of the special sciences including biology, psychology,\nand economics seem to differ in an important way from the\ngeneralizations of fundamental physics. In order to illustrate this\ndifference, here are some examples of generalizations that play an\nexplanatory role in various special sciences: \nSnell’s Law: “At the interface between dielectric\nmedia, there is (also) a refracted ray in the second medium\nlying in the plane of incidence, making an angle\n\\(\\theta_t\\), with the normal and obeying\nSnell’s law:  \nwhere \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) are the velocities of propagation in the two\nmedia, and \\(n_1 =(c/v_1), n_2 =(c/v_2)\\) are the indices of\nrefraction.” (Miles V. Klein’s Optics, cited from\nCartwright 1983, 46)  \nThe lack of vitamin C causes scurvy.  \nMendel’s Law of Segregation: “In a parent, the\nalleles for each character separate in the production of gametes, so\nthat only one is transmitted to each individual in the next\ngeneration.” (Rosenberg & McShea 2008, 36)  \nThe Area Law in Island-Biogeography: “the equilibrium\nnumber \\(S\\) of a species of a given taxonomic group on an island\n(as far as creatures are concerned) increases [polynomially] with the\nislands area [A]: \\(S = c\\times A^z\\). The (positive-valued)\nconstants \\(c\\) and \\(z\\) are specific to the taxonomic group\nand island group.” (Lange 2000, 235f.; Lange 2002, 416f.)  \nPeople’s actions are goal-oriented, in the sense that if person\n\\(x\\) wants \\(A\\) and believes \\(B\\) to be an optimal means\nfor achieving \\(A\\), then \\(x\\) will attempt to do \\(B\\)\n(Fodor 1987; Dray 1957, 132ff).  \nThe Law of Demand: Under the condition of perfect\ncompetition, an increase of demand of a commodity leads to an increase\nof price, given that the quantity of the supply of the commodity\nremains constant (Roberts 2004, 159; Kincaid 2004, 177).  \nThe lack of social integration results in a higher probability of\nattempted suicides.  \nThese generalizations may be explained in terms of lower level\nsciences, but this is not our focus here. What is important for our\npurposes is that all of these generalizations are non-universal. That\nis, there are (actual and merely possible) situations in which the\nabove generalizations do not hold, although all the\nconditions obtain that are explicitly stated in the antecedents of\nthese generalizations. For instance, there are situations in which the\nfollowing is the case: at the interface between dielectric media,\nthere is a refracted ray in the second medium lying in the plane of\nincidence, making an angle \\(\\theta_t\\), with the normal and this ray\ndoes not obey the equation \\(\\sin \\theta/\\sin \\theta_t = n_2 /n_1\\),\nthe lack of vitamin C does not cause scurvy, the alleles separate\ndifferently than Mendel’s law of Segregation describes, the\nequilibrium number of a species does not increase in accord with the\nArea Law, people fail to act in a goal-oriented fashion, and an\nincrease of demand of a commodity does not lead to an increase of\nprice (even if the condition of perfect competition were\nrealized). \nHowever, even though the generalizations are non-universal they do\nplay a role in explanations and predictions, they may be used for\npurposes of manipulation and they support counterfactuals. \nThe question arises how to deal with this situation. Are these\ngeneralizations to be classified as laws—laws that pertain only\nto special conditions, i.e., ceteris paribus laws—or\nare they something entirely different. Given the fact that laws play a\nmajor role in most accounts of explanation, causation etc., there seem\nto be basically three options: \nThe difference between options (b) and (c) may be to some extent\nmerely terminological. Woodward and Hitchcock, for example, replace\nlaws with ‘invariant generalizations’ (see section 6.2)\nbut admit that their account may be read as a\nreconceptualization of lawhood (see Woodward and Hitchcock\n2003, hereafter EG1, 3). \nThe motivation of those who take option (c) and stick to the concept\nof law is that the generalizations cited above have enough in common\nwith Newton’s first law or the Schrödinger-equation to\nclassify them as laws. For instance, they play the same kind of role\nin explanation, prediction, and they support counterfactuals. There\nare two beneficial consequences of this particular approach. First\n(against option (a)), it need not be denied that there are genuine\nexplanations etc. in the special sciences. Second (against option\n(b)), in analogy to the traditional view, the concept of a law (albeit\nof a non-universal or ceteris paribus law) can be used in\nexplications of notions such as explanation, and causation. \nThe main problem for those who choose option (c) is that they have to\nspell out what is meant by a non-universal law (statement) and how it\ncan perform similar explanatory and predictive tasks as a universal\nlaw. A convenient way to reconstruct the debate about option (c) is to\nunderstand non-universal laws as statements that are qualified by a\nceteris paribus (henceforth, “cp”) clause. Yet,\nhow to understand the meaning of the cp-clause is an open question\nthat is answered differently by various philosophers. \nBefore we discuss various accounts of cp-laws, several issues\nsurrounding the notion of “ceteris paribus”\nshould be distinguished in order to structure the debate: \nHowever, if there are cp-laws further questions arise: \nHaving distinguished these issues, it should be clear that\nthe debate about cp-clauses and cp-laws does not exist.\nInstead, theories of “cp” engage in different and often\nseparable enterprises. \nSection 2 gives, on the one hand, an account of the explicit use of\ncp-clauses (mainly) in the literature on economic issues from\nscholasticism to modern economics (section 2.1.). On the other hand,\nwe sketch two problems in philosophy of science and philosophy of mind\nthat explain why the issue of cp-laws became an intensely discussed\nissue since the 1980s (section 2.2,). \nSection 3 distinguishes different readings of the cp-clause and a\nfortiori different kinds of cp-laws. In section 3.1, exclusive\ncp-laws (factors not mentioned in the antecedent of the law are\nassumed to be absent) are distinguished from comparative\ncp-laws (factors not mentioned in the antecedent of the law are\nassumed to be constant). In line with the bulk of the\nrelevant literature, we focus on exclusive cp-laws. In section 3.2, a\ndistinction between definite and indefinite cp-laws is presented. \nSection 4 presents the main challenge to cp-laws. It appears that many\nlaws, e.g., of the special sciences, if taken as strict laws, turn out\nto be false; however, if they are hedged by a cp-clause they appear to\nlack a clear meaning and appear to be empirically untestable. All of\nthe major accounts of cp-laws discussed in sections 5 to 8 are\nreactions to this challenge. \nSection 5 deals with the most influential early accounts of cp-laws.\nThey take cp-laws to be incomplete laws that can be completed. Whereas\nFodor (1987) and others (see Section 5.1) focus on special science\ncp-laws that can be completed by adding factors to the antecedent of\nthe law that are dealt with in more fundamental sciences, Pietroski\nand Rey (1995) take cp-laws to contain (implicit) promises: that is,\nwhen asserting a cp-law, one promises to be able to cite factors that\ncomplete the law on a case by case basis if the consequent of the\ncp-law does not obtain (although the antecedent does). In section 5.2,\nwe present several objections against such completer accounts. \nSection 6 presents two versions of stability theories of laws in the\nspecial sciences, namely Lange’s (2000, 2002, 2005) stability\ntheory in section 6.1, and Woodward & Hitchcock’s (see EG1 and Hitchcock & Woodward 2003, hereafter EG2)\ninvariance theory in section 6.2. The common general idea of\ninvariance or stability theories of laws is that the laws differ from\nmerely accidental non-laws in virtue of their invariance or stability\nunder counterfactual suppositions. According to this view, ceteris\nparibus or non-universal laws differ from universal laws in\ndegree, not in kind: universal laws hold under all counterfactual\nsuppositions while ceteris paribus or non-universal laws\nmerely hold for a limited range of suppositions. \nSection 7 deals with dispositional accounts of cp-laws. The unifying\nidea is that the laws of nature are grounded in dispositional\nproperties. We distinguish two different dispositional accounts of\ncp-laws: On Hüttemann’s (2014) version, that is based on pioneering\nwork of Mill and Cartwright, law-statements are statements about\ndispositions, tendencies, or capacities rather than about overt\nbehavior, and thus cp-laws are turned into strict laws. Bird’s\n(2007) version of dispositionalism, by contrast, does not turn cp-laws\ninto strict laws. Instead, it identifies cp-laws with generalizations\nhedged by a cp-clause that are grounded in non-fundamental\ndispositional properties that admit of interferers. \nSection 8 deals with normality theories of laws. The guiding idea of\nnormality theories is that “cp, all \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s” means that normally \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s.\nThe various normality accounts differ in their explication of the\nnotion of normality. While Schurz (2001b, 2002) interprets normality\nas a high conditional, objective probability of the consequent of the\nlaw statement given the antecedent (see section 8.1), Spohn (2012)\nsuggests to explicate the normality conditions in terms of degrees of\nbelief and ranking functions over possible worlds (see section\n8.2). \nSection 9 sketches the relevance of cp-laws in other areas of\nphilosophy (such as epistemology and ethics). \nSection 10 is a survey to recent work on cp-laws in metaphysics,\nphilosophy of language and linguistics as well as in other\nsciences. \nSection 11 presents a brief conclusion and an outlook for future\nresearch. \nFinally, section 12 provides a concise overview of the relevant\nliterature.  \nThe Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” or\n“caeteris paribus”—literally meaning\n“other things being equal”— was used in a\nnon-technical sense by\n Cicero.[1]\n However, most of the early uses of the ceteris\nparibus-clause are found in economics. In economic contexts the\nuse of ceteris paribus clauses can be traced back to Petrus\n Olivi[2]\n in 1295. In the 16th century, Juan de\n Medina[3]\n and Luis de\n Molina[4]\n used “ceteris paribus” while discussing economic\nissues. \nIn 1662, William Petty was probably the first to use the term in an\nEnglish language\n publication.[5]\n In his Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, Petty qualifies\nhis labor theory of value by a “caeteris paribus”\nclause: \nJohn Stuart Mill used the explicit phrase “ceteris\nparibus” only\n occasionally[6]\n but it had an important impact because he characterized economy by\nits way of coping with disturbing factors: \nSince economy is thus concerned with one cause only, its laws describe\nwhat would happen provided there are no other causal factors. \nThe view of cp-laws promoted by Mill is the\nabsence-of-disturbing-factors view (see section 7). Another view is\nthe normal-tendency view of cp-laws (see section 8). The historical\nroots of the view are, for example, found in John Elliot\nCairnes’s description of the methodology of economics in his\nCharacter and Logical Method of Political Economy: \nCairnes (1888, 103) uses the expression “ceteris\nparibus” in order to refer to “what would or what\ntends to take place” if normal conditions obtained. \nThe use of ceteris paribus-clauses was advocated and\npopularized by Alfred Marshall in the late 19th century. It was\nMarshall’s genuine contribution to economics to advocate partial\nequilibrium analysis. Marshall claimed that an analysis of this kind\nholds merely ‘ceteris paribus’. In his\ninfluential Principles of Economics, Marshall defines the\ntask of economists in terms of the phrase ‘ceteris\nparibus’: \nIn the introduction to the same work, Marshall explains why economics\nis interested in the isolation of causes by assuming that other\nthings are equal: \nIn a similar vein, Lionel Robbins claims in his classic paper An\nEssay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science that\neconomic laws and antecedent facts deductively imply economic\npredictions, but only if other things remain\n unchanged.[8] \nThe use of “ceteris paribus” in economics and in\nphilosophy of economics is not of merely historiographical interest.\nIn current philosophy of economics and economics, the use of and the\ndebate on “ceteris paribus” is a vital issue: \nOutside the economics literature the use of the ceteris\nparibus-phrase became a central and also controversial issue in\nsome areas of philosophy of science and in philosophy of mind in the\n1980s. \nThe fact that test procedures for scientific theories or hypotheses\nare reliable only if disturbing factors are excluded or at least\ncontrolled for had already been noted by Carnap (1956, 69). Canfield\nand Lehrer (1961) have pointed out that in order to figure as premises\nof deductive-nomological explanations, the laws of physics have to be\nfurnished with cp-clauses. They provide the following example to\nsupport their claim: \nLetting ‘\\(Tx\\)’ mean ‘\\(x\\) is a\nthread’; ‘\\(Wx\\)’ mean the complex\nstatement ‘\\(x\\) is loaded with a weight exceeding that which\ncharacterizes its tensile strength’; and\n‘\\(Bx\\)’ mean ‘\\(x\\) breaks’ we\nwrite the inference schema: \nwhere the function \\(L(Tx \\amp Wx,\nBx)\\) indicates that there is a lawlike connection between\nthe conjunction ‘\\(Tx \\amp Wx\\)’\nand ‘\\(Bx\\)’ but leaves the nature of the\nconnection unspecified. (Canfield & Lehrer 1961, 205) \nThe envisaged prediction (‘\\(Bx\\)’) no longer\nholds if a magnet neutralizes the effect of the weight\n(‘\\(Mx\\)’). This can be accounted for if the\nabsence of the magnet is explicitly mentioned in the law. The problem\nis that the law must be complete with respect to all such factors that\nmight prevent the breaking of the thread. The completeness condition\nrequires that there are no further disturbing factors—i.e., it\nrequires an exclusive cp-clause (see section 3) Canfield and Lehrer\nalso present an argument for why these cp-clauses cannot be defined\naway, namely that any such attempt leads to an infinite regress of\nfurther cp-clauses. \nThe issue of disturbing factors was taken up in 1970 by Lakatos who\nraised it as a problem for the falsificationist methodology: \nPopper only briefly commented on this claim in a footnote (see Popper\n1974, 1186f.), while other authors discussed it explicitly as a\nproblem for falsificationism (see, for instance, Johansen 1980).  \nHempel argues in his 1988 paper “On Provisos” that every\ninferential construal of scientific theory testing is confronted with\nthe problem that a proviso always has to be added: \nIn fact, Hempel dismisses the phrase “ceteris\nparibus” as not particularly helpful. \nCarnap, Lakatos and Hempel all argue that in theory testing we usually\nimplicitly assume an additional premise that states that there are no\ndisturbing factors. Even though in the later literature Hempel’s\npaper has been taken to be evidence for the existence of\ncp-laws even in fundamental physics, the issue of whether a\ncp-clause has to be added as an extra premise in theory\ntesting has to be distinguished from the claim that the laws\nthemselves should be read as containing an implicit cp-clause (for a\ncriticism of this conflation cf. Earman and Roberts 1999, 442ff.;\nSchrenk 2007a, 25–36; Eliot 2011). \nTwo further developments lead to the explicit discussion of\ncp-laws. \nFirst, in her paper “The Truth doesn’t explain\nmuch” (reprinted in Cartwright 1983), Nancy Cartwright\ncriticizes the DN-model of explanation on the grounds that the alleged\nlaws on which the explanation relies (according to the DN-model) are\nnot true, but rather generalizations that hold under special,\ntypically ideal, conditions only. These cp-laws, she claims, will not\ndo the work required: \nCartwright (1983, 46f.) illustrates her claim using Snell’s law\n(for details, see our first example in section 1.1 above).\nSnell’s law is false if read as a universal generalization\nbecause, among other things, it is true only with respect to isotropic\nmedia. \nCartwright explicitly calls Snell’s law a cp-law. Many\nlaws we take to be strict universal laws are in fact cp-laws that hold\nin special circumstances only. According to Cartwright, the problem\narises that these laws cover only special or ideal conditions (most\nmedia are anisotropic), whereas in scientific practice they are used\nto explain phenomena in non-ideal situations as well. Cp-laws seem to\nplay an essential role in explanations but there is no account\navailable of how cp-laws can do this work. \nSecond, the issue of cp-laws became important in the\nphilosophy of mind as well. Davidson argued for his anomalous monism\non the basis of a stark contrast between homonomic and heteronomic\ngeneralizations. Homonomic generalizations are those that can be\nimproved in the same vocabulary, in which they are stated. This\nrequires, as Davidson puts it, a comprehensive closed system that is\nonly provided by physics. Outside of physics, we have only heteronomic\ngeneralizations, i.e., generalizations that can be made precise only\nby drawing on the vocabulary of another science. As a consequence,\nDavidson assumes that only physics has laws, whereas there cannot be\npsycho-physical or psychological laws. More generally,\nDavidson’s argument implies that there are no special science\nlaws (see Davidson 1963,\n 219).[9] \nThis claim provoked discussions about whether there are genuine\npsychological laws (cf. Fodor 1974, 1987, 1991, 1997; Kim 1985, LePore\nand Loewer 1987, 1989; Carrier 1998). Some authors, for example\nSchiffer (1991) and Earman, Roberts and Smith (2002), have even argued\nthat no special science (from biology upwards) has genuine laws of its\nown. By contrast, most authors have supported only the weaker claim\nthat there are no strict special science laws, but have\nargued that special science laws should be construed as laws that\ncontain implicit cp-clauses. \nFodor (1987) observes that we do use psychological generalizations (in\nlater papers, e.g., Fodor (1991) he uses ‘law’ instead of\n‘generalization’) for predicting and explaining human\nbehavior. These generalizations or laws, says Fodor, are\nnon-strict—they are hedged by a cp-clause. Nevertheless, these\nclaims, he insisted are neither false nor uninformative. \nSo, by the end of the 1980s cp-laws had become focal in two important\ndebates: one about the structure of scientific explanations in\ngeneral, the other about the status of the special sciences as\nautonomous scientific disciplines. \nIt has been argued that “ceteris paribus” is an\nambiguous notion. Two distinctions will help to disambiguate\nthe notion: the distinction between comparative and exclusive cp-laws\n(section 3.1), and the distinction between definite and indefinite\ncp-laws (section 3.2). \nSchurz (2002) suggests distinguishing between two conceptions of\ncp-law: comparative versus exclusive. Comparative\ncp-laws require that factors not mentioned in the antecedent or the\nconsequent of the law remain unchanged. By contrast, exclusive cp-laws\nassert the connection between antecedent and consequent only under the\ncondition that certain factors are excluded. \nThe comparative sense of cp-clauses derives from the literal meaning\nof “ceteris paribus” as “the others being\nequal”. A comparative cp-law asserts that the increase (or\ndecrease) of the value of a ‘variable’ \\(X\\) leads to\nan increase (or decrease) of the value of another variable, say\n\\(Y\\), provided that all other (possibly unknown)\n\\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) that describe the\nstates of the considered system (or at least those\n\\(X\\)-independent variables that are potentially interfering)\nremain at same values. Thereby, a variable \\((Z_i)\\) is\ncalled \\(X\\)-independent iff it is not causally\n(or nomologically) influenced by \\(X\\). So, to repeat, that a\nvariable \\(Z\\) is \\(X\\)-independent means (by the above\ndefinition) only that it is not caused by \\(X\\); though it may well\nbe a cause of \\(X\\) (see Schurz 2014 for a novel distinction\nbetween ceteris paribus and ceteris rectis\nlaws). \nThe reason why cp-laws of this type are called\n“comparative” in Schurz (2002) is that the requirement\nthat the other \\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) ‘are\nequal’, or remain at the same values, only makes sense if the\nlaw compares two states of a described (kind of)\nsystem. These two systems differ in the value of the antecedent\nvariable \\(X\\), but agree in their values of the\n\\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\). If the latter\ncondition holds for all possible values of the\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\), the comparative\ncp-law is called unrestricted; otherwise it is called restricted (see\nbelow). Another plausible name for this kind of cp-law would be\n‘equality cp-law’ (this was suggested by the referee),\nbecause it merely requires that the remainder factors are\n‘equal’ in the two compared states of the described\nsystem, rather than that some of them have to be excluded (as in\nexclusive cp-laws).  \nA terminological note: With a “variable” \\(X\\)\n(in the mathematical sense) we mean a functional property of\nindividuals \\(d\\in D\\) of a domain \\(D\\), i.e., a\nfunction \\(X: D\\rightarrow \\ran(X)\\) from \\(D\\) into\n\\(\\ran(X)\\). The set \\(\\ran(X)\\) (for “range of\n\\(X\\)”) is the set of possible values\n\\(x\\in\\ran(X)\\) of the variable \\(X\\); if \\(X\\) is\nquantitative, \\(\\ran(X) = \\Re\\), i.e., the set of real numbers.\n(If \\(ran(X) = \\Re\\) and the values of \\(X\\) are distributed\naccording to a given probability distribution, then \\(X\\) is what\nis called a ‘random variable’ in probability theory; cf.\nHays and Winkler 1975). In what follows,\n“\\(d_{(i)}\\)” denotes proper individual\nvariables (in the logical sense) and\n“\\(x_{(i)}\\)” denotes possible values of\nfunctional variables \\(X_{(i)}\\). An important\nsubcase of comparative cp-laws are probabilistic comparative\ncp-laws, in which the quantitative variables \\(X\\) express the\nprobabilities \\(P(F)\\) of some qualitative\nproperties expressed by predicates \\(F\\) (for instance, \\(F\\)\nmight be the increased probability of a car accident in example (2)\nbelow). \nHere are two examples of comparative cp-laws: \nWhile (1) states a quantitative relation between the\nincreases, only an ordinal relation between the increases is\npredicted in (2). \nComparative cp-laws are connected to the invariance approach of Woodward and Hitchcock (see §6.2 below). According to this\naccount, a cp-generalization expresses what would happen if an\nintervention on \\(X\\) would\n occur.[10]\n In causal graph theory, an intervention is defined as an operation\nwhich changes the value of \\(X\\) and decouples \\(X\\) from all\ncausal parents of \\(X\\) (cf. Pearl 2000, 23f, Woodward 2003, 98).\nThis notion of an intervention has the effect that a change of\n\\(X\\)’s value (as the result of an intervention) will not\nchange the value of any other \\(X\\)-independent\nvariable—which is exactly what is required by a comparative\ncp-law. \nIn the philosophical debate, cp-laws have often been understood in the\nother exclusive sense. An exclusive cp-law asserts that a\ncertain state or event-type \\(A\\) leads to another state or\nevent-type \\(B\\), provided disturbing factors or\ninfluences are absent. \nTerminological note: ‘\\(A\\)’ is called the\nantecedent and ‘\\(B\\)’ the consequent\n‘predicate’. In terms of quantitative variables\n\\(X\\), the predicate formula \\(A(d)\\) may express, for\nexample, that \\(d\\) has a certain \\(X\\)-value \\(x\\), or has\nchanged its \\(X\\)-value from \\(x_1\\) to\n\\(x_2\\). \nThus, an exclusive cp-clause does not merely require holding all other\n\\(X\\)-independent and potentially disturbing factors constant; it\nrather excludes the presence of disturbing factors.\nMore generally, it restricts the possible values of the remainder\nvariables \\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) to those\nvalue ranges where they cannot disturb the cp-law. Therefore, the\nexclusion-clause of exclusive cp-laws may always be equivalently\nreformulated as a clause which requires that certain truth conditions\nfor the exclusive cp-law hold, namely those conditions which exclude\ndisturbing factors. In this sense, Cartwright has remarked that\n“the literal translation is ‘other things being\nequal’, yet it would be more apt to read ‘ceteris\nparibus’ as ‘other things being\nright’” (1983, 45). Joseph (1980, 777) talked\nabout “ceteris absentibus” clauses, and Hempel\n(1988, 29) calls exclusive cp-clauses “Provisos”\n(“… provided disturbing factors are\nabsent”). \nHere are two examples of exclusive cp-laws—(3) comes from\nphysics and (4) from psychology: \nIn (3), the cp-clause requires that other (non-negligible) forces on\nthe planet except that of the sun are—not merely constant\nbut—absent. Likewise, the cp-clause of (4) requires\nthat any factors causing irrational behavior be absent. \nThe distinction between comparative and exclusive cp-laws is not\ndisjoint: some cp-laws are both comparative and exclusive, as for\nexample in the following example from theoretical economy: \nNot only must the compared economies agree in remainder factors such\nas the supply of the good (this is the comparative aspect); various\ninterferers, such as political regulations which prevent an increase\nof prices, must be excluded (that is the exclusive aspect). \nComparative cp-laws which are not restricted by an exclusive cp-clause\nare also called unrestricted comparative cp-laws. They assert\nan invariant connection between an \\(X\\)-increase and an\n\\(Y\\)-increase for all possible values of \\(X\\) and of\nthe \\(X\\)-independent remainder variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\). Unrestricted\nprobabilistic comparative cp-laws have been suggested as an\nexplication of generic causal relations (Cartwright 1989,\n145f; Eells 1991, 85f): they assert that a variable \\(X\\) is a\nprobabilistic cause of some other variable \\(Y\\) in all possible\ncircumstances, where these circumstances are expressed in terms of the\nvalues of \\(X\\) and the \\(X\\)-independent remainder\nvariables \\(Z_i (1\\le i\\le n)\\). \nUnfortunately, unrestricted invariance claims are rarely true. One\nexample mentioned by Cartwright (1989, §5.2) in which they do\nindeed hold is the force law of classical physics, \\(f :=\nS_{i \\in I}f_i = m \\cdot a\\), which equates the total force\n\\(f\\) with the sum of all component forces. In that case, an\nincrease of a component force \\(f_i\\) will produce an increase of\nacceleration for all possible values of \\(m\\) and the\nremainder forces \\(f_i (i\\in I)\\).  In Schurz (2002, §2, theorem\n1) it is proved that \\(X_i\\) is connected with \\(Y\\) by an\nunrestricted comparative cp-law, where \\(Y\\) is a function of\nindependent variables \\(X_1 ,\\ldots ,X_n\\), iff the \\(X_1 ,\\ldots\n,X_n\\) are\nnon-interacting causes of \\(Y\\) in a certain (technically\ndefined) sense. \nIn moderately complex systems, the composition of causes is usually\ninteractive. Therefore, these systems will only obey\nrestricted comparative cp-laws (Cartwright 1983, 64ff.;\nDupré 1984). Restricted comparative cp-laws are nothing but\ncomparative cp-laws in the scope of an exclusive cp-clause, which\nassert the comparative cp-relation only for a restricted class of\ncircumstances, expressed in terms of allowed values of the independent\nvariable \\(X\\) and the \\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_i\\). In this sense, examples (1) and (2) above\nare exclusive-comparative cp-laws because in (1), the cp-connection\nbetween temperature and volume holds only for approximately ideal\ngases, and in (2) the cp-connection holds only under psychologically\nnormal conditions. \nAlthough the definiens of a comparative cp-law relating\n\\(X\\) with \\(Y\\) refers to “all \\(X\\)-independent\nvariables”, comparative cp-laws are nevertheless empirically\ntestable by the method of randomized experiments (cf. Fisher 1951). In\nthis method, one randomly splits a sample into two subgroups, an\n“experimental group” and a “control group”,\nthen enforces an increase of the value of \\(X\\) on the experimental\nbut not on the control group, and finally compares the two samples\nconcerning the value of \\(Y\\). Since the split of the original\nsample was random, experimental and control group will agree in their\ndistribution of all \\(X\\)-independent remainder variables,\napart from random errors. Thus, one can apply this method without\nknowing which \\(X\\)-independent variables are causally relevant for\n\\(Y\\) and which are not. If there is a significant change of the\nvalue of \\(Y\\) in the experimental group compared with the control\ngroup, the cp-law “\\(X\\)-increase leads to an\n\\(Y\\)-change” is confirmed (strictly speaking only the\nrestriction of this law to the population from which the sample has\nbeen taken is strongly confirmed, while confirmation of the\nunrestricted cp-law requires tests for a variety of different\n“populations”, i.e., distributions of \\(X\\)-independent\nremainder variables). On the other hand, if there is no significant\nchange of \\(Y\\)’s value, the cp-law is strongly disconfirmed,\neven in its unrestricted form. This does not mean that the method of\nrandomized controlled experiment is free from error possibilities. In\nparticular, the experimentally induced change of \\(X\\)’s\nvalue may have smuggled in unrecognized \\(X\\)-dependent variables\n(i.e., unrecognized side-effects) which are partly responsible for the\nresulting change of \\(Y\\). For example, in a teaching experiment\ncomparing two teaching methods (e.g., the new method and the old\nmethod), the new teaching method may come out as more successful than\nthe old one—yet not because of intrinsic properties of the new\nmethod, but just because the fact that the teaching method was\nnew has increased the motivation of its teachers. \nAn important distinction concerning only exclusive cp-laws is that\nbetween definite and indefinite exclusive cp-laws. A\ndefinite exclusive cp-law specifies the disturbing factors\nwhich are excluded (or the validity conditions which are required) in\nthe antecedent of the law. In other words, a definite exclusive cp-law\n“exclusively cp, if \\(A(d)\\), then\n\\(B(d)\\)” has a strict completion of the form\n“For all \\(d\\): if \\(A(d)\\) and \\(C(d)\\),\nthen \\(B(d)\\)”, where the completing condition\n“\\(C(d)\\)” excludes the presence of the\nspecified disturbing factors in application \\(d\\). Earman, Roberts\nand Smith (2002, 283f.) call definite exclusive cp-laws lazy\ncp-laws. \nHowever, in most cases such a strict completion is impossible. This is\nespecially clear for our non-physical example (2), as well as for the\nfollowing example (6) from biology: \nThe number of possible factors which may disturb a bird’s flying\ncapability is potentially infinite. In other words, for every\ncondition \\(C\\) which excludes a finite list of such factors the\ncompleted law “All birds satisfying \\(C\\) can fly” will\nstill have to face further exceptions—hence, a strict completion\nof this law is impossible. Exclusive cp-laws of this sort are called\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws, or in the terminology of Earman, Roberts\nand Smith (2002), non-lazy cp-laws. \nIt is a widely agreed in philosophy that the real significance of\nexclusive cp-laws lies in situations where strict completion is\nimpossible (for example, cf. Rescher 1994, 14; Pietroski & Rey\n1995, 84, 102; Horgan & Tienson 1996, 119f.). In that case, the\nexclusive cp-law is indefinite, which means that its\nexclusive cp-clause consists in a universal second order condition\nwhich excludes all kinds of disturbing factors to the law, whatever\nthey are. Formally, also an indefinite exclusive cp-law may be written\nas a strictly completed law of the form “if disturbing factors\nare excluded, then \\(A\\)s will always be\n\\(C\\)s”—only that the meaning of “all disturbing\nfactors” is now unclear which leads to various sorts of\ndeficiencies that are discussed in the next section. \nExclusive cp-laws of the form “exclusively cp, \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s” admit exceptions, i.e., instantiations of \\(A\\)s\nwhich are not-\\(B\\)s (Pietroski and Rey speak of\n“abnormal” instances; 1995, 88). A philosophical\nreconstruction of exclusive cp-laws—which includes restricted\ncomparative cp-laws and, thus, the majority of all cp-laws—faces\na severe problem. This problem can be articulated in the form of a\ndilemma. This dilemma has been formulated by Lange (1993, 235), who\nattributes it to Hempel (1988). \nFirst horn: If exclusive cp-laws are reconstructed as some\nsort of strict law, then they will tend to be false. Typically, it\nwill not be the case that all \\(A\\)s satisfying a completer\ncondition \\(C\\) are \\(B\\)s, since the range of potentially\ndisturbing factors is typically indefinable. For instance, the\nrelationship between supply and price is not always as the law of\nsupply says (or, as it seems to say prima facie), because an\ninterfering factor might occur. In other words, special science laws\nthat instantiate perfect regularities are—mildly\nput—“scarce” (Cartwright 1983, 45). Yet, if one\nsupposes that the law is to be formalized as a universally quantified\nconditional sentence, then one counter-instance (due to a disturbing\nfactor) to the universally quantified sentence means that it is\nfalse. \nSecond horn: If we instead suppose that an indefinite\nexclusive ceteris paribus clause is attached to the law so\nthat it means “All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s, if nothing\ninterferes”, then the cp-law in question is in danger of\nlacking empirical content. It lacks empirical content because it seems\nto say nothing more than “All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s or\nnot-(All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s)”. If this is true, then\nexclusive cp-laws are analytically true sentences and, therefore,\ntrivially true. This, however, is an unwelcome consequence because\nlaws of the special sciences should be reconstructed as empirical\nstatements—not as sentences being true in virtue of meaning. \nBoth horns are quite unpleasant results for any philosopher looking\nfor a theory of non-strict laws. To deal with this dilemma is a\ncentral challenge for every theory of ceteris paribus laws\n(Lange 1993; Earman and Roberts 1999; Earman, Roberts and Smith 2002).\nIn the following section, several attempts to cope with this dilemma\nare presented and tenacious problems of them are discussed. \nThe general idea behind completer approaches is that the best way to\nexplicate exclusive cp-laws is to add the missing conditions for a\nstrict implication into the antecedent of the law statement. There are\ntwo quite different possibilities to do this. The first possibility is\nto add these conditions explicitly, by appropriate descriptions of the\nfirst order individual variables involved in the law. If this were the\ncorrect account, all correct cp-laws would turn out to be definite\nexclusive cp-laws (or lazy cp-laws in the terminology of Earman,\nRoberts and Smith 2002). The second possibility is to add these\nconditions by way of a second order quantification over first order\npredicate variables, which apply to the first order individual\nvariables of the law. In this account, cp-laws are turned into\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws. \nFodor’s starting point for his account of cp-laws is\nDavidson’s distinction between homonomic and heteronomic\ngeneralizations (see section 2.2): \nSo, Fodor’s idea is that the additional factors whose existence\nis required by the exclusive cp-clause cannot be completely specified\nwithin the conceptual resources of the special sciences, although this\ncould be done (at least in principle) within the vocabulary of some\nmore fundamental science such as neurophysiology or, ultimately,\nfundamental physics. Fodor calls the missing factors\n‘completers’. A physical microdescription of the\nantecedent condition \\(A\\) is called a realizer of \\(A\\) (the\nsame \\(A\\) may have several different realizers). \n(7) A factor \\(C\\) is a completer relative to a realizer \\(R\\)\nof \\(A\\) and a consequent predicate \\(B\\) iff: \n(Fodor 1991, 23) \nA first option (which Fodor conceives of as insufficient) would be to\ndefine the truth conditions of a cp-law as follows: \nSchiffer has objected to this account on the grounds that if \\(A\\)\nis a (mental) functional state, which can be realized by very\ndifferent states \\(R_i\\), it is highly unlikely\nthat there is a completer for every realization (cf. Schiffer 1991, 5)\nFodor accepts this objection and provides the following account: \nWhile condition (9)(i) repeats the simpler definition in (8),\ncondition (9)(ii) expresses the idea that if \\(A\\) is, for\ninstance, an intentional state and goes into the antecedent of many\nlaws, then even if \\(R_i\\) does not have\ncompleters in the cp-law in question, cp\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is\nstill true, if \\(R_i\\) does have completers in\nmany other cp-laws. \nMott (1992) provided the following counterexample to condition (ii) of\nthis account of truth-conditions: cp, if a person is thirsty, then she\nwill eat salt. This comes out as a true cp-law, because on the one\nhand, very likely many, maybe all, realizers of “being\nthirsty” lack completers (because nobody tends to eat salt when\nthirsty). On the other hand, ‘being thirsty’ might very\nwell go into the antecedent of many other cp-laws for which there are\nsuch completers. Mott’s counter-example can be avoided if one\nadds to (ii) the requirement that for sufficiently many realizers\n\\(R_j\\) of \\(A\\) there exist completers with\nrespect to \\(B\\) (see Silverberg 1996 and Earman and Roberts 1999,\nsection 9 for discussion). \nAlthough Fodor starts with the hope that the missing conditions of\nexclusive cp-laws could eventually be specified in the fundamental\nscience, his definition of exclusive cp-laws involves a second order\nquantification over variable (unspecified) completers of independent\nexception-explainers. Hence, his account of exclusive cp-laws belongs\nto the family of indefinite exclusive cp-laws. Because of this fact\nFodor’s and related accounts face severe problems, as will be\ndiscussed in section\n 5.2.[11] \nSchiffer, Fodor and Mott try to explicate cp-laws by ordinary\ntruth-conditions. In contrast, Pietroski and Rey provide stronger\nconditions for what they call “non-vacuous truth”, in\nterms of epistemic conditions such as explanation and\nindependent confirmability. Pietroski and Rey compare cp-clauses to\ncheques: \nCompletion is conceived here as explanatory completion and it is\nrequired only post factum. If there is a counter-instance of\nthe law in question, we are committed to explain why the law was not\ninstantiated: \nFor the cp-law to be acceptable in spite of the counter-instance we\nneed independent evidence for the existence of the disturbing factor.\nIt would not be acceptable if the only evidence for the existence of\nthe disturbing factor were the counter-instance we started with. \nPietroski and Rey (1995, 92) take a cp-law to be non-vacuously true\nand hence epistemically acceptable iff (in simplified words) the\nfollowing conditions are met: \n(10) cp\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is non-vacuously true iff \nPietroski & Rey’s (1995) account involves a second order\nquantification over unspecified exception-explainers. Thus, as in the\ncase of semantic completer accounts, their account explicates\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws and faces severe problems to be explained\nin the next section. \nSeveral authors have independently shown that completer approaches are\nunsatisfactory. Earman and Roberts (1999, 454f) provide arguments\nwhich show that an exclusive cp-law in the sense of Pietroski and Rey\ncannot escape the problem of vacuity. Their example is the\nalleged cp-law “cp, all spherical bodies conduct\nelectricity”. Every failure of this law can be explained in\nterms of a factor, for which we have independent evidence,\nviz. the molecular structure of the body in question. Schurz\n(2001a) proves that Pietroski & Rey’s exclusive cp-laws are\nnot vacuous but almost vacuous. More precisely, the content\nof “exclusively cp, \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” in the sense\nof Pietroski & Rey’s definition (10) is equivalent to the\nclaim that for every event of the form “\\(d\\) is an \\(A\\)\nand \\(d\\) is (or is not) a \\(B\\)” there exists a true\nstrict completer \\(C(d)\\) such that either “All\n\\((A\\wedge C)\\)s are \\(B\\)s” or “All\n\\((A\\wedge C)\\)s are \\(\\neg B\\)s” is a strictly true\nlaw. This means that conditional on \\(A\\), every \\(B\\)-event or\nnot\\(-B\\)-event is assumed a deterministic and independently\nidentifiable cause, whatever this cause may be. This presupposition of\ndeterminism is both too strong and too weak: It is too weak because it\ndoes not establish a relevant nomological connection between \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\). It is too strong because in all areas involving random\nprocesses, determinism does not hold. Woodward (2002, §2) has\ndemonstrated that a similar criticism affects Fodor’s\naccount. \nThere is an even more serious accidentality-problem that is\nconnected to the almost-vacuity of indefinite exclusive cp-laws. An\nexclusive cp-law may be true although its antecedent is not at all\nnomologically or causally relevant for its consequent. All sorts of\nevents are connected by indefinite exclusive cp-laws, provided only\nthat they have deterministic causes, which for Pietroski and Rey\n(1995) have additionally to be independently testable, and for Fodor\n(1991) have to be nomologically relevant (cf. Woodward 2002, 309, (ii,\niii)). For example, Woodward (2002, 310) demonstrates that according\nto the explications of Pietroski and Rey (1995), Fodor (1991) and\nHausman (1992), the exclusive cp-law “all charged particles\naccelerate at a rate of \\(n\\) meters/sec\\(^2\\)” is a\ntrue exclusive cp-law for arbitrary values of \\(n\\). Schurz (2002,\n364) demonstrates that according to these accounts “if a person\nlooks to the right, she will see a kangaroo” is a true exclusive\ncp-law. Also, Earman & Robert’s example can be read as\ndemonstrating the accidentality of “cp, all spherical\nbodies conduct electricity”, although the example was originally\nused to show that this statement is vacuously true. \nThe common guiding idea of invariance or stability theories is that\nthe laws differ from non-laws in virtue of their invariance or\nstability under counterfactual suppositions. \n“Stability” and “invariance” are often taken\nto be synonyms. For the sake of clarity, we will use\n“stability” to refer to Lange’s stability theory of\nlaws (section 6.1) and we will use “invariance” to refer\nto Woodward & Hitchcock’s invariance theory of laws (section\n6.2). \nIn stability/invariance accounts, laws qualified by a cp-clause are\nconsidered to be non-strict in the sense that they hold true only\nunder a limited range of counterfactual suppositions. Different\nversions of invariance or stability theories differ in how they\ndetermine this limited range of counterfactual suppositions.\nIn this sense, invariance or stability theories can be understood as\nan alternative to exclusive interpretations of non-strict laws and as\nan attempt to deal with the dilemma of triviality and falsity. \nAccording to Lange (2000, 2002, 2005), the universal fundamental laws\nin physics and the cp-laws in the inexact special sciences differ only\nin degree (for a related account that does not focus on stability\nalone see Mitchell (2000)). The lawhood of universal laws and cp-laws\nis due to the same property of these statements: their stability.\nLange’s (2000, 8f.) approach consists in two steps. First, the\nrole of laws in scientific reasoning is determined: they figure in\nexplanations and predictions, they support counterfactuals, and they\nare inductively confirmed. And second, it is claimed that the laws can\nplay this role because of their characteristic stability. So, in order\nto understand Lange’s account of cp-laws, we must first clarify the\ncrucial notion of stability. \nLange’s basic idea is that laws are lawlike because they are\ntrue in a wide range of possible conditions. Most importantly, the\nlaws do not only hold true in any (non-nomic) actual\nconditions but also remain true under all (non-nomic)\ncounterfactual suppositions. Along these lines, Lange (2000,\n48f.; cf. 2009a, 20) proposes a preliminary definition of laws in\nterms of nomic preservation: \nThis definition, however, raises an obvious question: what does it\nmean to be physically possible? Roughly, a proposition \\(p\\) is a\nphysical possibility iff there is some possible world \\(w\\) where\nthe same laws of nature hold as in the actual world and \\(p\\)\nobtains at \\(w\\). But if this is true, Lange’s definition of\nlawhood seems to be circular, since being consistent with the\nlaws (of the actual world) is ultimately part of the\ndefiniens of being a law (of the actual world). Lange (2005,\n2009a, 25–28) recognizes the problem of circularity and offers\nan alternative account of laws in terms of the notion of stability. It\nsays, roughly put:  \nThis notion of stability in turn leads to a theory of laws: \nAccording to Lange (cf. 2005, chapter 4; 2009a, chapter 2), there\nexist several different stable sets: for example, the set of logical\ntruths, the set of all physical laws, and the set of all truths (which\nis trivially stable). The requirement of \\(G\\) to be non-maximal,\ni.e., to be strictly smaller than the set of all truths, is necessary\nto avoid the identification of the set of laws with the set of all\ntruths. \nLange argues that definition (13) is not affected by the circularity\nproblem, since stability does not presuppose the notion of a law, and\nthat it provides a sharp distinction between laws and merely\naccidentally true non-laws. Consider some accidentally true universal\nstatement as for example: \nAccording to Lange, this generalization is an accidental truth because\nit is not a member of a (non-maximal) stable set. For assume \\(A\\)\nis a member of some non-maximal set \\(\\Delta\\) (which may contain all\nphysical laws). By non-maximality, there exists some further\naccidental truth \\(B\\), for example, \nwhich is not in \\(\\Delta\\). If \\(\\Delta\\) is stable, every member of \\(\\Delta\\)\nmust remain true under the counterfactual supposition that\n\\(\\neg\\)A\\(\\vee \\neg B\\), since this supposition is compatible with\nevery member of \\(\\Delta\\). However, Lange (2005, 421) argues that there\nare at least some conversational contexts in which \\(A\\) does not\nhave priority over \\(B\\). Hence,\n\\(\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\rightarrow A\\) is not the\ncase, and therefore \\(\\Delta\\) is not stable under the counterfactual\nsupposition \\(\\neg A\\vee \\neg B\\). By contrast, according to\nLange, a law of nature has priority over any accidental truth in every\ncontext, and thus the laws of nature form a stable set.  \nEven assuming that Lange’s argumentation is valid (see, however,\nDemarest (2012) and Hall (2011) for criticism based on the\ncontext-sensitivity of counterfactuals), there is the worry that the\ncircularity problem has not entirely been dissolved: It reappears at\nthe level of the truth conditions for counterfactuals, since usually\nthey are formulated in terms of the laws (see, e.g., Goodman 1947;\nLewis 1973; Maudlin 2007: 21). Lange (2009a: chapter 4) answers this\nobjection by arguing that subjunctive facts are ontologically\nprimitive and the truth conditions for counterfactuals do not refer to\nlaws. He concludes that, therefore, his explications (12) and (13) are\nnot circular.  \nWe can now turn to the question how cp-laws differ from universal\nlaws. According to Lange, cp-laws are stable (sets of) propositions\nwhose application is pragmatically restricted to the purposes\nof a scientific discipline. He elaborates this idea with respect to\nthe laws in the special sciences, or inexact sciences as he calls\nthem: “A set is stable for the purpose of an inexact\nscience if and only if it is invariant under every counterfactual\nsupposition of interest to the science and consistent with the\nset” (Lange 2002, 416). Lange tries to avoid the horns of the\nFalsity-or-Triviality-Dilemma by treating ‘ceteris\nparibus’ as a name for a set \\(I\\) of interfering\nfactors. Notice that \\(I\\) does not list all the possible\ninterferences which prevent the occurrence of \\(B\\) in ‘cp,\nall \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s’, but only those factors that are\nrelevant (for a discipline). One can understand Lange in a\nway that he provides two\n strategies[12]\n to determine the members of \\(I\\): (A) the strategy of\nnon-negligibility and (B) the strategy of intended interest of a\nscience. Both strategies try to explicate a methodology that is\nimplicitly used by scientists in a particular discipline (cf. Lange\n2000, 170–174). \n(A) The strategy of non-negligibility: Instead of providing a\ncomplete list of all interfering factors, scientists merely refer to\nthose interfering factors “that arise sufficiently often, and\ncan cause sufficiently great deviations from \\(G\\)-hood, that a\npolicy of inferring \\(F\\)s to be \\(G\\) […] would not be\ngood enough for the relevant purposes” (Lange 2002, 411; Lange\n2000, 170f). For instance, consider the economic law “cp, if the\nsupply of a commodity increases then the price decreases”.\nAccording to Lange, it may happen that the increase in supply is so\nsmall that no decrease in price results. But it might as well happen\nthat the price does not decrease although the supply increases\nsignificantly, because a gigantic comet hitting the planet Earth and\ndestroying all life on its surface disturbs the instantiation of this\nlaw. The comet causes sufficiently great deviation from a decrease in\nthe price of a good. Nevertheless, comets are negligible for the\npurposes of economists because their occurrence does not arise\nsufficiently often to count as interfering factor that is to be\nexplicitly listed in the cp-conditions. \n(B) The strategy of intended interest of a science: A law may\nstill count as stable if it fails to hold under those counterfactual\nsuppositions that do not fall into the range of the laws intended\npurpose and application. This point is best illustrated by an example\nfrom island biogeography—the area law—provided by\nLange: \nThere are counterfactual suppositions for which the area law is not\ntrue. For example, imagine an island where the animals of the species\n“chicken” exclusively live on chicken farms. Suppose\nfurther that on these farms chicken are bred and held under extremely\ncrowded conditions. So, the counterfactual supposition stemming from\nthis example is “chicken on the island in question are bred\nunder extremely crowded, artificial conditions set up by\nfarmers”. Obviously, the area law will drastically fail to hold\nfor this case. Moreover, cases of this kind are not far-fetched\nphilosophical thought experiments: they do not occur\nrarely in times of cultivated breeding of animals (as\nrequired by the strategy of non-negligibility). Nevertheless,\nscientists exclude this kind of exceptions because it conflicts with\nthe intended purpose and application of their discipline (in this\ncase: island biogeography) (cf. Lange 2002, 417; Lange 2000, 232f. for\nfurther\n examples[14]). \nIt is illuminating to contrast Lange’s strategies of determining\na set of disturbing influences \\(I\\) (in the light of intended\napplications of a law) with the use of cp-clauses that does indeed\nrender a statement trivial. Lange illustrates this point by an example\nof a mere “excuse clause”: \nAccording to Lange, excuse clauses of this kind differ from cp-clauses\nas used in the sciences, because the latter refer to strategies of\ndetermining disturbing factors. Although the relevant set of\ndisturbing factors is not listed explicitly, it is implicit in the\nscientific practice (and the education and studies) in a particular\nfield of inquiry. \nBased on his stability theory of laws, Lange also proposes an argument\nfor the autonomy and irreducibility of special science laws. Recall\nthat arguing for the autonomy and irreducibility of the special\nsciences with respect to physics was one of the crucial motivations to\nstart the debate on cp-laws (see section 2.2). Suppose that the laws\nof a certain special science \\(D\\) are stable with respect to the\npurposes of \\(D\\). This pragmatic restriction is unique to\n\\(D\\). In other words, \\(D\\)’s laws are stable for\ncounterfactual suppositions that violate other disciplines’\nlaws, for example the laws of fundamental physics. For instance, Lange\n(2002, 420) claims that ‘the area law would still have held had\nthere been birds equipped with organs weakening gravity’s pull\nsomewhat’. Having organs that weaken gravity’s pull is\nunderstood as a violation of the law of gravitation. Thus,\n\\(D\\)’s laws are stable under some counterfactual supposition\nfor which fundamental physics is unstable. This unique range of\nstability makes \\(D\\) epistemically autonomous as a scientific\ndiscipline because \\(D\\)’s laws can figure, for instance, in\nexplanations answering some why-questions that no other discipline can\nanswer as adequately as \\(D\\) itself (cf. Lange 2000, chapter 8;\nLange 2002, 420f.; also Reutlinger & Koch 2008). \nSimilar to Lange’s stability theory, the invariance approach\n(most prominently advocated in EG1, EG2;\nWoodward 2000, 2002, 2003) also identifies the stability or invariance\nof a generalization as its key feature for performing the role of a\nlaw and figuring in explanations and predictions. As in Lange’s\ntheory, to be invariant means for Woodward and Hitchcock to be true\nunder several (not necessarily all) counterfactual suppositions.\nDespite this basic agreement there are important respects in which the\ninvariance theory differs from Lange’s stability theory. In what\nfollows we focus on the distinguishing features of the invariance\napproach: \nCounterfactual Suppositions Viewed\nDifferently—Interventions: Invariance theories characterize\nthe counterfactually supposed antecedent conditions under which a\ngeneralization remains stable differently than Lange’s stability\ntheory. Lange simply assumes these conditions, e.g., the temperature\nof the gas is 32ºC, to be the result of counterfactual\nsuppositions. We suppose that \\(p\\) is true and see whether the law\n\\(l\\) remains true supposing \\(p\\). So, stability theory is\nindifferent concerning how the supposed state of affairs comes about.\nInvariance theory is more restrictive in characterizing the\ncounterfactual situations: A counterfactual situation refers to a\nchange in the value of a variable. For an invariance\ntheorist, it is important to explain how the change of a\nvariable is brought about: the change of the value of a variable must\nbe the causal outcome of an intervention. An intervention\nconsists in a local change that sets a variable \\(X\\) to a\ncertain value and at the same time decouples \\(X\\) from all\n\\(X\\)-independent variables, as explained in section 3. So, an\nintervention on \\(X\\) is a direct, exogenous causal influence on\nsome variable \\(X\\) which (1) does only act on \\(X\\) itself\nwhile (2) other variables \\((Z)\\) are only changed in virtue of\nbeing directly or indirectly caused by the change in \\(X\\). Notice\nthat interventions need not be carried out by human beings. Instead\nthey are conceived as hypothetical (not necessarily human) causes.\n(cf. Woodward 2003, 98; and Woodward 2003, 103f., 123–127 for\narguments against an anthropomorphic interpretation of interventions.)\n \nDifferent kinds of Variables: Invariance theories distinguish\ntwo kinds of variables: (1) Explicit variables, that figure explicitly\nin a generalization and (2) background variables, that describe\nbackground conditions which are not mentioned in the generalization in\nquestion. Consequently, interventions can be carried out with respect\nto both kinds of\n variables.[15] \nSimilar to Lange’s theory, Woodward and Hitchcock use the\nintended purposes of inquiry of a certain discipline to distinguish\nbetween interventions into explicit variables and background variables\n(cf., e.g., Woodward 2003, 262f). According to their invariance\ntheory, only the former are of importance to laws in a specific\nscientific discipline. Woodward uses an example from economics to\nillustrate the point: \nObviously, the reason to ignore rare but possible changes in the\nbackground variables is very similar to Lange’s strategy of\nnon-negligibility. Woodward contrasts these negligible changes of\nbackground variables with important changes of explicit variables: \nConditions of Invariance: Invariance theories differ\ndrastically from Lange’s approach in defining their key notion,\ni.e., stability or invariance. According to Woodward and Hitchcock\n(EG1, 17) and Woodward (2003, 250): \nThe most intuitive case of a testing intervention might be the\nfollowing one: \\(X=x_1\\) describes an actual state\nof affairs while \\(X=x_2\\) describes a possible\ncounterfactual state of affairs. For instance, suppose that\nBoyle’s gas law —\\(p \\cdot V = N \\cdot k cdot T\\)—is true for the actual\ntemperature of a gas \\(g\\) of 30°C. According to the testing\nintervention condition, Boyle’s gas law is stable if it also\nholds for (counterfactual) temperature of, say, 40°C. One might\ncall this kind of invariance “minimal” invariance.\nContrary to Lange’s theory, minimal invariance is necessary and\nsufficient for the statement to count as invariant. Notice, however,\nthat invariance under variations of background variables is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for being minimally invariant (cf. Woodward\n2003, 248; EG1, 7f.). \nAccording to Woodward & Hitchcock, laws or generalizations in the\nspecial sciences do not hold under all interventions. They merely hold\nfor a certain range of possible values (of those variable figuring in\nthe law statement). By being non-strict the generalizations in the\nspecial sciences do not satisfy a condition that is traditionally\nassociated with laws of nature, namely the condition of universality.\nNonetheless, being invariant for a limited range of values is enough\nfor a proposition to play a lawlike role in the sciences, as is argued in EG2. Woodward and Hitchcock (EG2,\n184–189) develop further criteria and examples of determining\nthe degree of invariance of a generalization \\(G\\) (e.g., comparing\ntwo generalizations \\(G\\) and \\(G*, G\\) might be more\nexact than \\(G^*\\) with respect to the same range of intended\napplication; or \\(G\\) might be more or less sensitive to variations\nin the background conditions than \\(G^*\\) etc.). \nLet us compare Lange’s stability theory and Woodward &\nHitchcock’s invariance theory with respect to the range of\ncounterfactual suppositions or, alternatively, interventions to which\nthe law is applicable. One can say that Lange’s stability theory\nand Woodward & Hitchcock’s invariance theory start from\nopposed extremes of the spectrum of stability: (1) Lange starts at the\nmaximum of stability, i.e., he starts with the claim that a\nlaw-proposition \\(l\\) remains true for all counterfactual\nsuppositions that are consistent with \\(l\\), where by definition a\ncounterfactual supposition is admissible if it is consistent with the\nlaws of nature. In a second step, Lange reduces the set of all\ncounterfactual suppositions consistent with \\(l\\) because of\ncertain pragmatic goals of the discipline which uses the proposition\n\\(l\\). (2) Woodward and Hitchcock start with minimal stability,\ni.e., the satisfaction of the testing intervention condition for some\nproposition \\(l\\). In a second step, Woodward and Hitchcock add to\nminimal stability that \\(l\\)’s degree of invariance increases\nwith the number of possible interventions for which \\(l\\) holds\n(among other criteria). \nAnalogously, Lange argues for a principled distinction between laws\nand accidents within the framework of his stability theory (section\n6.1). However, Lange’s strategy to distinguish laws from\naccidents seems to be partly motivated by the intuition that\nminimal invariance in Woodward & Hitchcock’s sense\nis too weak to account for real life stability displayed by\nscientific generalizations. Correspondingly, Lange (2009b:\n297–302) argues that Woodward & Hitchcock’s account\nfails to distinguish laws from mere accidents and therefore also fails\nto account for the laws’ characteristic explanatory power.  \nJohn Stuart Mill objected to the claim that laws might have\nexceptions. The problem of exceptions disappears if laws are taken to\nrefer to tendencies. \nThis idea was taken up by Cartwright and others. Cartwright’s\ndiscussion of cp-laws focused on the question why cp-laws are of\ninterest in non-ideal situations. If what cp-laws say is confined to\nspecial, namely ideal, circumstances it seems prima facie\nthat these laws are irrelevant for all other, non-ideal, situations.\nThat, however, is not the case in scientific practice. Cp-laws are\nused to explain phenomena outside the ideal circumstances. Cartwright\nargues that this practice requires the postulation of capacities or\ntendencies: \nSubsequently, her suggestion has been taken up by several authors that\nattempt to provide a semantics for cp-laws or even of laws in general\nin terms of dispositions (cf. Hüttemann 1998, 2007; Lipton 1999;\nDrewery 2001; and Bird 2005, 2007, chapter 3). \nThe prima facie advantage of a dispositional account of laws\nvis-á-vis the cp-law-problem is the following: The\ndispositional account provides a semantics for cp-laws.\nAccording to one version of the dispositionalist account of cp-laws\n(see Hüttemann 2014), a law statement is true provided the type\nof system in question has the disposition that the law statement\nattributes to the system. Reconstructing law-statements as statements\nabout dispositions, tendencies, or capacities rather than about overt\nbehavior turns cp-laws into strict laws. The claim is—as in\nMill—that certain kinds of systems have certain kinds of\ntendencies or dispositions. In stating the law, it is no longer\nnecessary to appeal to cp-clauses. One advantage is that the so-called\nproblem of instantiation, “the problem that many cp-laws appear\nnot to have any instances” (Lipton 1999, 164) can be solved. The\nlaw is no longer considered to be a description of the systems’\noccurrent behavior that is only manifest under very special\nconditions—if at all. The law concerns the underlying stable\ntendencies or dispositions. Furthermore, this dispositionalist account\nis able to provide a rationale for why scientists are interested in\ncp-laws. Cp-laws describe how systems behave in the absence of\ndisturbing factors, i.e., if the disposition, tendency etc. can\nmanifest itself completely. This knowledge can be used to account for\nmore complex situations, in which various systems and their\ndispositions are intertwined—provided laws of superposition are\navailable. \nThere is a different version of dispositionalism about cp-laws\naccording to which they are not turned into strict laws (see Bird\n2007: section 3.3). In a nutshell, Bird’s general idea is that the\n“laws are those regularities whose truth is guaranteed by the\nessentially dispositional nature of one or more of the constituent\nproperties” (Bird 2007: 46–47). According to Bird, fundamental\nessentially dispositional properties or potencies give rise to strict\nlaws, since there are no (or only very few) finks or\nantidotes that would prevent the manifestation of the potency\nfrom occurring if the stimulus had occurred (see Bird 2007 chapters\n3.3.2 and 3.3.3, and the SEP-entry on dispositions for details on\ninterferes such finks and antidotes). However, the\nmanifestation process of non-fundamental dispositional properties can\nbe interfered with and so the manifestation only occurs ceteris\nparibus, i.e., in conditions where the trigger occurs and\nfinks and antidotes are absent (see Bird 2007:\nchapter 3.3.1). Therefore, these non-fundamental properties give rise\nto ceteris paribus laws only.  \nWe want to focus on two kinds of concerns that have been raised with\nrespect to dispositionalist accounts: \nDispositions, powers, potencies or tendencies may be present without\nbeing manifest (cf. Earman and Roberts 1999, 451f.): \nAs a rejoinder, dispositionalists can point to laws of composition. As\na consequence, it is not the disposition on its own that can explain\nthe actual pattern in such cases but rather the dispositions plus the\nlaw of composition. For example, Newton’s second law with (i)\nthe gravitational force and (ii) the Coulomb-force describe two\ndispositions that explain the actual behavior of a particle relying on\nthe law for the superposition of forces. The law for the superposition\nof forces describes how the two forces contribute to the actual\nbehavior. (Note that the dispositions the laws of nature attribute to\nsystems need not in general be taken to be macroscopic dispositions\nlike fragility or solubility.) To the extent that such laws are\navailable (as for example for physical forces) the contribution of the\nvarious tendencies or dispositions can be determined even if they fail\nto be (completely) manifest. It can, however, be disputed whether such\nlaws of superposition/composition are available in general, especially\nif one holds like Bird (2007) that every law needs to be grounded in\npotencies. But even if composition laws are taken to be underpinned by\ndispositions, a further law seems to be needed that tells us what\nhappens if the disposition for the law of composition fails to be\nmanifest. We need a meta-law that tells what the law of composition\ncontributes to the actual behavior. So, the assumption that laws of\ncomposition are grounded in dispositions attributed to physical\nsystems threatens to lead to an infinite regress. \nA second problem concerns the question whether a dispositional account\ncan indeed avoid the dilemma for exclusive cp-laws (see section 4).\nEven though it is true, at least on one version, that the laws no\nlonger appeal explicitly to cp-clauses, the\ntriviality-or-falsity-dilemma turns up at a different place (see\nLipton 1999, section 5: Hume’s revenge). The dispositionalist\nstill has to specify the stimulus or triggering conditions for the\ndisposition in order to give the disposition’s ascription a\ndeterminate content. The conditions under which the disposition will\nmanifest itself are exactly those that are required to explicate the\ncp-clause (see Lipton 1999, section 5; for an extensive discussion of\nthis problem cf. also Schrenk 2007b). So, explicating the triggering\nconditions of a disposition requires that something informative is\nsaid about the cp-clauses, and more generally, leads us back to the\nproblems discussed in the previous sections (see Hüttemann 2014\nfor a recent defense of the dispositionalist approach to cp-laws; Ward\n2009 provides a critical discussion).  \nThe reconstructions of exclusive cp-laws in terms of strict\ncompletions do not imply anything about the probability with\nwhich undisturbed antecedent-events will produce the consequent (cf.\nPietroski and Rey 1995, p. 84; Schiffer 1991, p. 8). According to\nproponents of normality theories this seems to be counterintuitive,\nbecause cp-laws should be asserted only if the situation without\n(non-negligible) disturbing factors is a normal or at least a\nrather probable situation. Examples of correct exclusive cp-laws which\nviolate this normality condition are, for example: “exclusively\ncp, no tire blows out”, “exclusively cp, there are no\nclouds in the sky”, etc. Several authors have therefore\ndeveloped so-called normality accounts of cp-laws, including\nSilverberg (1996), Earman and Roberts (1999, 463), Spohn (2002), Spohn\n(2012, chapter 13), and Schurz (2001b, 2002), who argues that the\nnormality interpretation is the preferred interpretation of exclusive\ncp-laws in the life sciences, from biology upwards to the\nsocial sciences. \nNormality theories can be understood as an alternative to the\n(definite and/or indefinite) exclusive interpretation of non-strict\nlaws. The general idea of normality theories is that “cp, all\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” means that normally \\(A\\)s\nare \\(B\\)s. They can also be combined with a comparative\ninterpretation into normic-comparative law-statements such as\n“normally an increase of \\(X\\) leads to an increase of\n\\(Y\\) when other \\(X\\)-independent variables are held\nconstant”. However, the normality accounts differ in their\nexplication of the notion of “normally”. One possibility\n(suggested by Schurz 2001b, 2002, see section 8.1) is to explicate the\nnormality condition in terms of a high probability of the consequent\npredicate, given the antecedent predicate, where the underlying\nconditional probabilities are objective statistical probabilities\nbased on the dispositions of evolutionary systems. Another possibility\n(suggested by Spohn 2012, see section 8.2) is to explicate the\nnormality conditions in terms of degrees of belief and ranking\nfunctions over possible worlds. \nLargely independently of Schurz’s and Spohn’s specific\napproaches but in agreement with the general idea of the normality\napproach, Hüttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko (2014),\nReutlinger (2014), Roberts (2014) and Strevens (2014) have recently\nexplored a statistical approach to cp-laws, according to which cp-law\nstatements are statistical claims. \nSchurz (2001b; 2002, §5) analyses cp-laws in non-physical\nsciences as normic laws of the form “\\(A\\)s are\nnormally \\(B\\)s”. Here are some examples (4* and 6* are the\nnormic reconstructions of 4 and 6 above): \nAccording to the statistical consequence thesis, normic laws\nimply numerically unspecified statistical generalizations of the form\n“Most \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s”, by which they can be\nempirically tested. The statistical consequence thesis has been\nchallenged by cognitive scientists (e.g., McCarthy 1986) and by\nphilosophers of biology (e.g., Millikan 1984). Schurz (2001b) defends\nthe statistical consequence thesis by the following argument which is\nbased on the generalized theory of evolution that does not only apply\nto biological evolution but also to cultural evolution (cf. Mesoudi\net al. 2006 for an excellent overview on generalized\nevolution theory; see Strößner 2015 for a recent\ndiscussion). \nThe common domain of the life sciences (which, according to Schurz,\ninclude biology, psychology as well as the social sciences and the\nhumanities) are evolutionary systems or their products. Evolutionary\nsystems are systems whose self-regulatory properties have been\ngradually selected according to their contribution to reproductive\nsuccess. The temporal persistence of self-regulatory systems is\ngoverned by a certain range of prototypical norm states, in\nwhich these systems constantly have to be in order to stay alive. They\nmanage this with the help of regulatory mechanisms which\ncompensate for disturbing influences of the environment.\nAlthough the self-regulatory capacities of evolutionary systems are\nthe product of a long adaptation history, they are not perfect.\nDysfunctions may occur, whence their normic behavior may have various\nexceptions. Yet, it must be the case that these systems are\nin their prototypical norm states in the high statistical\nmajority of cases and times, since otherwise, they would not have\nsurvived in evolution. \nIn this way, the evolution-theoretic foundation of normic laws does\nnot only explain why normic laws are the typical form of the laws of\nlife sciences. It also explains why normic laws are not strict but\nnevertheless are associated with high conditional statistical\nprobabilities, at least for most cases and times in evolution. \nAccording to Schurz (2002), the difference between idealization\nconditions in physics and normality conditions in evolutionary\nsciences can be explained as follows: In physics, one traditionally\nthinks of complexity as a source of\ndisorder—regularities are obtained by abstracting\naway from complexities. In evolutionary systems, by contrast,\ncomplexity is usually a source of\norder—complexity which has been selected by\nevolution to stabilize normic behavior. As Wachbroit (1994, 587f.)\nputs it, ideal planets are theoretical abstractions: mass points under\nthe influence of a centripetal force and ‘nothing else’.\nThey do not literally exist. In contrast, normal birds really\ndo exist because they are what has been selected through\nevolution. When speaking of a normal bird, we do not abstract from its\nadmirable complexity, but we rely on it as the cause of its\nnormal behavior. This does not mean that abstract laws of physics\n(e.g., the laws of aerodynamics) play no role in the explanation of\nfunctional behaviors of evolutionary systems (e.g., that birds can\nfly). However, even when we explain a bird’s flying ability in\nterms of the laws of aerodynamics, we still have to assume a\n‘normal’ bird which possesses the typical capabilities of\nbirds that have been selected through evolution. The idealization\nprocedures needed for planets would not make good sense for birds:\nthere are no disturbing parameters which, when going to zero, turn a\nreal bird into an ideal bird which can necessarily fly and which is\napproximated by the real bird. \nAnother way to understand “ceteris paribus” as\nreferring to normal conditions is introduced by Wolfgang Spohn (1997,\nsection 5; 2002, section 4; 2012, chapter 13.2; 2014). Spohn takes the\nconnection between ceteris paribus qualifications and\nnormality to be straightforward: “ceteris\nparibus” means other things being normal. Let us\ncall this the Normal Condition Approach. The basic idea of\nthe Normal Conditions Approach is that a cp-law \\(L\\) holds when\nnormal conditions obtain. Spohn characterizes normal conditions as\n“exactly those conditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain\n[…] in the small space-time region inhabited by us”\n(Spohn 1997, 278). Translated in probabilistic terms, the expression\n“conditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain” means\nthat the occurrence of some conditions is highly\nprobable. \nFor Spohn, a condition is “normal” if it is (i) expected\nor (ii) at least not ruled out to obtain by a rational, epistemic\nagent (for formal definitions of normal and exceptional conditions cf.\nSpohn 2002, section 4, and Spohn 2012, chapter 13.4). He illustrates\nhis Normal Conditions Approach with Hooke’s Law: \nSpohn concludes that Hooke’s law holds under normal conditions\nand draws an analogy to other law statements in the special\nsciences: \nSpohn’s Normal Conditions approach differs from Schurz’s\nNormic Laws approach in at least two respects. \nAccording to Spohn (and contrary to Schurz’s theory which refers\nto objective probabilities), the fact that normal conditions obtain is\nconceived epistemically and, more specifically, doxastically. An\nepistemic agent forms beliefs about the normality of conditions, i.e.,\nsomeone strongly believes that some condition obtains (cf. Spohn 2002,\n385). \nSpohn describes “the epistemic functioning” of beliefs\n(doxastic states) about normality by modeling degrees of belief in\nterms of ranking functions (originally developed in Spohn 1988 under\nthe label “ordinal conditional functions”; cf. also Spohn\n2012 and the SEP-entry ‘Formal Representations of Belief’,\nsection 3.3) \nNormality in Spohn’s theory is explicated in terms of background\nconditions, not in terms of probabilistic relations between the\nantecedent predicate and the consequent predicate. If someone believes\nthat the law \\(f(X)=Y\\) holds, then she believes that\nthis functional relation holds under normal conditions \\(N\\), which\nmeans in terms of Spohn’s ranking functions that the law\n\\(f(X)=Y\\) is believed with rank zero, i.e., it is\ntrue in all normal worlds of a ranked world model. Such a ranked world\nmodel consists of a set of possible worlds together with a ranking\nfunction which attaches to each world a natural number \\(0, 1, \\ldots ,n\\) specifying its rank. Worlds with rank 0 are the most normal\nworlds, worlds with rank 1 contain exceptions from normal conditions\n(1st degree exceptions), worlds with rank 2 exceptions from those\nexceptions (2nd degree exceptions), etc. \nSpohn (2014) is the most recent and in-depth elaboration of his normal\nconditions based “epistemic account” of ceteris\nparibus laws and conditions.  \nSince the normal conditions “\\(N\\)” express the\nproposition that the given situation or world is normal, it would seem\nthat the ranking-of-worlds account entails the possibility of a strict\ncompletion by adding the normality condition \\(N\\) to the\nantecedent: “if \\(N\\), then \\(Y = f(X)\\)”. Indeed, it follows from the truth condition\nfor the assertion “normally (or cp) \\(L\\)” in a ranked\nworld model (where \\(L\\) is e.g., \\(Y = f(X))\\)\nthat there exists a proposition \\(N\\)—namely the set of all\nworlds with rank 0—such that “normally \\(L\\)” is\ntrue in the given ranked model iff the material implication\n\\(N\\rightarrow L\\) is true in all worlds of this model. This does\nneither imply, however, that (a) the completing proposition \\(N\\)\ncan be linguistically expressed, nor (b) that it can be expressed in a\nnon-trivial way, in the sense that \\(N\\) does not already imply\n\\(L\\) on logical reasons alone. Since one can only speak of a\nstrict completion of “normally \\(L\\)” if (a) and (b)\nhold, it follows that the ranking-of-worlds account does in fact not\nentail the possibility of a strict completion. This result is\nadequate, because as we have argued above, in most cases (especially\nin all non-deterministic situations) a strict completion is\nimpossible. Thus, it has to be kept in mind that speaking of\n“normality conditions” does not imply that these\n“normality conditions” can be expressed by any\n(non-trivial) proposition. For example, there is not any non-trivial\nproposition \\(N\\) which could turn the conditional “normally\na Cs\\(^{137}\\) atom decays after 60 years” into a strict\nimplication of the form “if \\(N\\), then a Cs\\(^{137}\\)\natom decays after 60 years”. Also note that the ranked-worlds\naccounts and the conditional probability accounts are equivalent as a\nsemantics for logical axiomatizations of conditional reasoning (see\nsection 8.3). \nReasoning from exclusive or normic cp-laws has an important logical\nfeature: the inferences are in contrast to deductively valid arguments\nnot monotonic. An inference is monotonic iff adding arbitrary\nnew premises to a valid argument preserves its validity. But the\ninference from an exclusive cp-law of the form “exclusively cp,\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” and a singular statement\n\\(A(d)\\) (for “\\(d\\) is an \\(A\\)”) to a\nconclusion \\(B(d)\\) is no longer correct if \\(d\\) is\nknown to instantiate a disturbing factor \\(D\\) which blocks the\nnomic connection between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For instance, the\nexclusive cp-law may state that if something is a bird (\\(A\\)), then it\nnormally can fly (\\(B\\)), and \\(D\\) may assert that the given\nbird-instance has broken wings. \nAssume the exclusive cp-law is formulated with the help of a\nnon-strict conditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\). Drawing correct\ninferences from non-strict conditionals requires non-classical rules\nof valid inferences: The non-monotonicity of Default Modus\nPonens means formally that although the inference from\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and \\(A(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is\ncorrect (i.e., \\(A\\rightarrow B, A(d) \\dproves B(d)\\) holds, where ‘\\(\\dproves\\)’ stands for\n‘non-monotonically correct inference’), the inference from\nthe extended premise set \\(A\\rightarrow B,\nH\\rightarrow \\neg B, A(d)\\), and\n\\(H(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is incorrect (i.e.,\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\), A\\((d), H(d) \\dproves B(d))\\). These non-monotonic effects are reflected in\nnon-classical rules for inferences from conditionals to conditionals.\nFor example, take the inference from “If \\(A\\), then\n\\(B\\)” to “If \\(A\\wedge D\\), then\n\\(B\\)” (monotonicity \\(M)\\) or from “If \\(A\\),\nthen \\(B\\)” and “If \\(B\\), then \\(D\\)” to\n“If \\(A\\), then \\(D\\)” (Cut \\(C)\\). Both\ninferences are valid for strict (logical or material) conditionals,\nbut they are not generally correct for non-strict conditionals. Only\nthe more cautious inferences from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\wedge D\\rightarrow B\\)\n(cautious monotonicity CM) or from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\wedge B\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\rightarrow D\\)\n(Cautious Cut CC) are correct for non-strict conditionals. \nTwo prominent semantic criteria for the truth of a non-strict\nconditional and the correctness of inference from non-strict\nconditionals have been suggested in the literature. \nRemarkably, both semantics lead to the same conditional logics. Both\nsemantics possess the system \\(P\\) (“preferential\nentailment”) as a correct and complete axiomatization of\ninferences among pure conditionals, and the system \\(R\\)\n(“rational entailment”) for inferences among\ntruth-function combinations of conditionals (for more details cf.\nKraus et al. 1990, Hawthorne 1996, Adams 1975, Schurz 1998,\n2004, 2005, Leitgeb 2004, and the SEP-entry on non-monotonic\nlogic). \nThe use of “cp” is not restricted to philosophy of\nscience. It is used in other areas of theoretical and practical\nphilosophy as well. \nFor instance, prima facie reasons are reasons under the\nconstraint of exclusive cp-conditions. They play an important role in\nethics and epistemology. \nIn ethics, a prima facie norm is an obligation (e.g.,\n“prima facie, you should not hurt anybody”) which\nholds as long as exceptional circumstances (e.g., defending your own\nlife) are absent (cf. Ross 1930 and the SEP-entry on moral reasoning).\nDancy (2004, 17, 35f) uses the expression “pro\ntanto” instead of “prima facie”, which\nis standardly used in the current debate. Pietroski (1993) has\npromoted the ceteris paribus understanding of moral\nobligations as a solution to paradoxes of moral obligations.\nEspecially for the solution of moral dilemmas, the cp-reading of moral\nobligations has proven to be helpful, because although two conflicting\ncp-obligations may block each other, they do not produce a strict\nconsistency in the sense of deductive logic (see Horty 1994). \nIn epistemology, a prima facie reason for a belief is a\nreason which justifies this belief in the absence of defeaters, i.e.,\nof exceptional information to the contrary. Prima facie\nreasons have been suggested in epistemology as a means of providing\nweak and defeasible a priori justifications for\nepistemologically fundamental beliefs such as the belief in the\nexistence of an external reality, for which a strict and non-circular\na priori-justification seems to be impossible. Nevertheless,\nthe inference from visual appearances to reality counts as defeasibly\njustified as long as there do not exist serious defeaters, i.e.,\nreasons for serious doubt (cf. Williams 1996, 2001, and the SEP-entry\non a priori-justification and knowledge). An example is the\ndefeasible inference from visual appearances to beliefs concerning\nexternal reality. My awareness of my visual appearance of a tree in\nfront of me is a prima facie reason for my belief that there\nreally is a tree in front of me, provided that information about\nexceptional circumstances is absent, for example the information that\nI am under the influence of drugs which cause hallucinations (cf.\nPollock 1986, Moser 2002). One may object that a similar kind of\npossible exception to the inference from visual appearances to reality\nis constituted by the possibility of a Cartesian demon who infuses\nhumans with illusionary perceptions, which is one of the major\nskeptical counterarguments to the inference from appearances to\nreality. In response to this objection, several epistemologists have\nargued that these kinds of exceptions are not serious exceptions, and\ntherefore, the inference from appearances to reality is defeasibly\nvalid. \nFinally, applications of cp-clauses can also be found in the form of\npresumptions in philosophy of language. Here it is assumed that\nunderstanding linguistic expressions requires defeasible assumptions\nor “presumptions”, for example presumptions concerning the\nrationality of the speaker (cf. Quine 1960; Davidson 1973, Scholz\n2016, 148–159). \nIn the current literature, a number of novel trends and innovative\napproaches to cp-laws have emerged that cannot easily be subsumed\nunder the already existing accounts. For this reason they deserve\nspecial mention. We believe there are at least four clearly\ndiscernable novel tendencies in the current work on cp-laws: \nA reconnection to metaphysics: One of the most salient trends\nin the current literature is that the discussion of cp-laws\n(re)connects philosophy of science to analytic metaphysics in at least\nthree respects: (i) current accounts of cp-laws make use of David\nLewis’s (1973) best system account of laws; moreover, (ii) the\ninterpretation of objective probabilities and (iii) the metaphysics of\ndispositions are brought into play for making progress in\nunderstanding cp-law statements.  \nThe most vivid sign of this reconnection consists in the fact that\nseveral authors have recently defended a friendly amendment of David\nLewis’s best system account of laws of nature. While\nLewis’s (1973, 73) original version primarily focuses on\nfundamental laws, the amended versions are intended to capture also\nnon-fundamental laws of the special sciences. Schrenk (2007a, 2014),\nCallender and Cohen (2009, 2010), and Frisch (2014a) defend a\nso-called “better best system” account of special science\nlaws. Unterhuber (2014) develops a version of the “better best\nsystem” account utilizing generics. Jaag and Loew (forthcoming)\nargue for a pragmatic version of the best systems account that\ncaptures also central insights of the “better best system”\ntheory. On their view, the universality of laws is not an end in\nitself. If a generalization’s invariance is, e.g., limited to\nour cosmic epoch only, this limited invariance arguably would be\nenough to make it useful for us and thus a law according to this\naccount. Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and Reutlinger (2014) provide\na critical discussion of “better best system” accounts.\nBraddon-Mitchell (2001) and Wheeler (2018) present versions of a best\nsystems account deploying the idea of algorithmic compression from\ndata science. Albert (2000, 2015) and Loewer (2009) advocate a\n“statistical mechanical” version of the best systems\napproach to special science laws which is, unlike the “better\nbest system” account, committed to a particular\nBoltzmann-inspired interpretation of statistical mechanics (including\nassumptions about the early history of the universe). Weslake (2014)\nand Frisch (2014b) provide critical responses, while Fenton-Glynn\n(2016) constructively uses examples by Albert and Loewer for an\nanalysis of cp-laws. Finally, Albert and Loewer’s account also\nconnects the debate on cp-laws with the on-going discussion on whether\ncausation has a place in fundamental physics or whether causation is\nan ‘emergent’ phenomenon captured by the cp-law statements\nof the special sciences (Price and Corry 2007 and Frisch 2014b are\nrepresentative of the opposing views in the debate on causation in\nphysics). \nAlso other metaphysical issues besides Lewis’s account of\nlawhood influence the recent literature on cp-laws. The metaphysics of\nprobabilities and disposition stand out in this respect. Taking up\nresults from Earman and Roberts (1999) and Schurz (2002), several\nauthors including Hüttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko\n(2014), Roberts (2014), Reutlinger (2014), and Strevens (2014) discuss\nthe prospects of a statistical approach to cp-laws (or a\n“softness” approach, to use Strevens’s term),\naccording to which cp-laws are statistical claims. (Notice that the\nnormality account presented in section 8 above is but a special case\nof the broader statistical approach to cp-laws). \nA third metaphysical trend concerns the metaphysics of dispositions:\nAs we have explained in section 7 above, Hüttemann (2014) and\nPemberton and Cartwright (2014) argue in favor of a dispositionalist\naccount of cp-laws and provide responses to standard objections to the\ndispositionalist view (for instance, to objections voiced by Earman\nand Roberts 1999). \nDrawing on linguistics and philosophy of language: Several\nrecent approaches to cp-laws explicitly draw on research in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language. Taking into account linguistic\nwork on generics, Nickel (2010, 2014) argues that our understanding of\ncp-law statements is improved if one takes them to be generics and\nuses the formal semantics for generics to shed light on the meaning of\ncp-law statements (for approaches to cp-laws deploying generics, see\nalso Unterhuber and Schurz 2013; Unterhuber 2014; and Claveau und\nGirard 2019). Roberts (2014) makes contact with philosophy of language\nin analyzing cp-laws as vague and indexical statements about\nfrequencies. Ward (2007), Karbasizadeh (2008) and Nickel (2014)\nexplore the link between cp-laws and different accounts of natural\nkind terms. \nSensitivity to the sciences: Several philosophers have made\nan effort to draw attention to the fact that an adequate discussion of\nlaws has to be sensitive to the differences between distinct\nscientific disciplines. Their motivation is to provide a theory of\nlaws that fits generalizations (and models) in the life sciences, the\nsocial sciences and, more generally, the sciences of complex systems\n(for instance, see Mitchell 1997, 2002a,b; 2008, 2009; Sober 1997;\nSteel 2007; and Reiss 2008). In particular, Mitchell (2000), Strevens\n(2003, 2008), Craver (2007), Hüttemann (2007), Wimsatt (2007),\nTobin (2005), Woodward (2010) and Reutlinger (2011, 2013) distinguish\nvarious dimensions of characterizing how generalizations in these\nscientific disciplines may be non-universal or allow for exceptions.\nThese dimensions include stability, robustness, specificity, and\nhistorical contingency (see Reutlinger and Unterhuber 2014b for an\noverview). In a similar vein, Schurz (2014) introduces a novel\ndistinction between ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Fenton-Glynn (2016) holds that some higher-level\nlaws about the macro-behavior of complex systems (his central example\nis the second law of thermodynamics) are “minutis\nrectis” laws and should be distinguished from cp-laws,\nbecause their non-universal character stems from a probability\ndistribution over initial micro-conditions (see Strevens 2003 for\nfurther examples). Finally, motivated by examples from population\necology, earth science, and statistical mechanics, Strevens (2008) and\nWeisberg (2013) argue for a new interpretation of laws and models\ninvolving idealized assumptions, the minimalist account of\nidealizations. Strevens (2012, 2014) proposes treating cp-laws and\nidealized laws separately. What seems to emerge from this literature\nis that the ceteris paribus character of generalizations is\nmulti-faceted. There is a number of ways in which a generalization can\nbe non-universal: due to idealizations, by expressing statistical\nregularities and probability distributions over initial conditions, by\ndrawing on the notion of normality, by being sensitive to changes in\ninitial and background conditions, and so on (see Reutlinger and\nUnterhuber 2014b for a more detailed analysis). \nUsing scientific concepts and methods: recent philosophical\nattempts of capturing cp-laws increasingly involve importing key\nconcepts from the sciences and using these concepts for developing a\ngeneral theory of cp-laws. Inspired by classical mechanics, Maudlin\n(2007) and Hüttemann (2014) analyze cp-conditions in terms of\ndefault or inertial behavior. Both authors capture a violation of\ncp-conditions as a deviation from inertial behavior, where deviating\nfrom inertial behavior is itself a process governed by laws of\ndeviation (Maudlin) or laws of interaction and composition\n(Hüttemann). Other philosophers are influenced by the life\nsciences such as Nickel (2014), Pemberton and Cartwright (2014), and\nStrevens (2012, 2014) who rely on the concept of a mechanism in order\nto explicate the content of cp-conditions more generally. Kowalenko\n(2014) argues that cp-laws are best understood by drawing on methods\nfrom statistics, such as multivariate regression analysis (for a\ndiscussion of similar statistical approaches see Hüttemann and\nReutlinger 2013, Reutlinger 2014, Roberts 2014, and Strevens 2014).\nSchurz (2014) uses causal Bayesian networks as a formal framework for\na causal reconstruction of ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Finally, Jhun (2018) argues that focusing on the\nequilibrium methodology used in thermodynamics as well as in economic\nreasoning facilitates a new understanding of the explanatory role of\ncp-laws in terms of efficient performance.  \nWhere are the debates about cp-laws leading? What are the important\nchallenges to be met in future research? There are at least four main\nareas of productive future research: \nThese areas of research are, of course, not a complete list of future\nresearch topics. Nevertheless, it seems to us that these questions are\ninteresting enough to stimulate productive further research on\nceteris paribus laws. \nThe critical article by Earman and Roberts (1999) provides an\nexcellent introduction to the contemporary debate, because it\nreconstructs the most important theories of cp-laws and also points\nout the problems of these approaches. The volumes by Earman et\nal. (2002) and Reutlinger and Unterhuber (2014) contain a\nrepresentative collection of contemporary essays on the problem of\ncp-laws. \nPersky (1990), Blaug (1996) and Kaufer (1997) are accessible surveys\nof the history of cp-clauses and cp-laws. Notice that these articles\nfocus on economics and the social sciences. For a systematic\ndiscussion of laws in the social sciences, the debate between Kincaid\n(2004) and Roberts (2004) on whether there are laws in the social\nsciences is very instructive. \nThe important distinctions between (a) comparative and exclusive and\n(b) indefinite and definite cp-laws are established and argued for in\nSchurz (2002). \nThe dilemma of triviality or falsity is discussed in Lange (1993),\nwhich is also a helpful survey of the debate until 1993. \nConcerning completer accounts, Fodor (1991), Hausman (1992: chapter 8)\nand Pietroski and Rey (1995) are central papers. These accounts are\ncriticized by Earman and Roberts (1999), Schurz (2001a) and Woodward\n(2002). A more recent defense of completer accounts is Strevens\n(2012). \nConcerning stability accounts, Marc Lange develops his version in\nbook-length (see his 2000 and 2009a, although the focus of the latter\nis not on cp-laws). Lange (2002) is a very accessible paper on his\nview of cp-laws. Invariance accounts are best introduced in two joint\npapers by James Woodward and Christopher Hitchcock (see their EG1, EG2) and in Woodward’s book Making Things Happen (2003:\nchapter 6). Hall (2007) provides an insightful discussion of Woodward\n& Hitchcock’s invariance account.  \nFor dispositionalist approaches to cp-laws, Cartwright (1989) is a\nmodern classic (cf. her recent 2002, and Elgin and Sober 2002 for a\ncritique). Smith (2002), Mumford (2004), Bird (2005, 2007) and\nHüttemann (2007, 2014) develop different more recent\ndispositional accounts of cp-laws. \nConcerning normality approaches, Schurz (2001b, 2002) argues for a\nnormic laws approach. Spohn (2002) and Spohn (2012, chapter 13) are\ngood introductions to the normal conditions approach. See also Glymour\n(2002) for a formal approach to cp-laws. \nHumean better best system accounts of cp-laws are presented in Cohen\nand Callender (2009, 2010), Schrenk (2007a, 2014), and Unterhuber\n(2014). Wheeler (2018: chapter 3.2) gives an accessible brief\nexposition of various versions; and Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and\nReutlinger (2014) provide a critical discussion.  \nThere are also various approaches in the current debate that cannot\neasily be classified: Mitchell (1997, 2002a, b; 2008, 2009), Sober\n1997, Steel (2007, chapter 6) and Reiss (2008) attempt to explicate a\ntheory of laws that fits scientific practice in biology, the social\nsciences and generalization describing complex systems. Further,\nMitchell (2000), Craver (2007), Tobin (2005) and Reutlinger (2011)\ndistinguish various dimensions of the non-universality of (cp-)laws in\norder to argue for an explication of laws in the special sciences.\nKarbasizadeh (2008) links the debates on cp-laws and natural kinds.\nLadyman and Ross (2007, chapters 4 and 5), Kincaid (2008), Ross\n(2008), and Ladyman (2008) argue for ontic structural realism as a\nmetaphysics of generalizations in the social sciences (and for the\nspecial sciences in general). Finally, Maudlin (2007, chapter 5)\nadvocates an explication of laws in the special sciences that is based\non the notion of quasi-Newtonian laws.","contact.mail":"gerhard.schurz@phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de","contact.domain":"phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de"},{"date.published":"2011-03-14","date.changed":"2019-12-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ceteris-paribus/","author1":"Alexander Reutlinger","author2":"Gerhard Schurz","author1.info":"http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/reutlinger/index.html","entry":"ceteris-paribus","body.text":"\n\n\nLaws of nature take center stage in philosophy of science and\nmetaphysics. Laws are usually believed to stand in tight relations to\nmany philosophical key concepts such as causation, explanation,\nconfirmation, determinism, and counterfactuals. Traditionally,\nphilosophers have focused on physical laws, which were taken to be at\nleast true, universal statements that support counterfactual claims.\nBut, although this claim about laws might be true with respect to\nphysics, laws in the special sciences (such as biology, psychology,\nand economics) appear to have—maybe not\nsurprisingly—different features than the laws of physics.\nSpecial science laws—for instance, the economic law “Under\nthe condition of perfect competition, an increase of demand of a\ncommodity leads to an increase of price, given that the quantity of\nthe supplied commodity remains constant” and, in biology,\nMendel’s Laws—are usually taken to “have\nexceptions”, to be “non-universal” or to be\n“ceteris paribus laws”. How and whether the laws\nof physics and the laws of the special sciences differ is one of the\ncrucial questions motivating the debate on ceteris paribus\nlaws. Another major, controversial question concerns the determination\nof the precise meaning of “ceteris paribus”.\nPhilosophers have attempted to explicate the meaning of ceteris\nparibus clauses in different ways. The question of meaning is\nconnected to the problem of empirical content, i.e., the question\nwhether ceteris paribus laws have non-trivial and empirically\ntestable content. Since many philosophers have argued that ceteris\nparibus laws lack empirically testable content, this problem\nconstitutes a major challenge to a theory of ceteris paribus\nlaws.\n\nIn philosophy of science and metaphysics, laws of nature take center\nstage: Many explications of philosophical key concepts in philosophy\nof science essentially rely on laws of nature. For instance, a\nmajority of theories of causation, explanation, confirmation,\ndeterminism, and counterfactuals presuppose laws of nature (see the\nSEP-entry on laws of nature). \nUntil the second half of the 20th century, certain characteristics of\nlaws of nature were taken for granted by philosophers of science: Laws\nof nature were taken to be true, logically contingent, universal\nstatements that support counterfactual claims. Laws were taken to play\na major role in explanation, induction, confirmation, causation, and\nin counterfactual reasoning. The paradigm cases for such laws were\ntaken from (fundamental) physics. Newton’s second law\n\\((F=ma)\\) or the Schrödinger-equation fit the\nbill of the traditional concept of a law of nature. Philosophers of\nscience were aware of the fact that there are hardly any universal\nlaws of this kind in biology, psychology, economics or other special\nsciences. This posed no problem as long as there was a consensus that\nthis might be conceived as a shortcoming of the special sciences.\nHowever, with the success especially of the biological sciences it\nbecame clear that there is genuine scientific knowledge that does not\nconform to the paradigm of physics. As a consequence, scientific\npractice in the special sciences was no longer taken to be deficient\nbut was analyzed as a legitimate practice different from physics. The\ngeneralizations of the special sciences including biology, psychology,\nand economics seem to differ in an important way from the\ngeneralizations of fundamental physics. In order to illustrate this\ndifference, here are some examples of generalizations that play an\nexplanatory role in various special sciences: \nSnell’s Law: “At the interface between dielectric\nmedia, there is (also) a refracted ray in the second medium\nlying in the plane of incidence, making an angle\n\\(\\theta_t\\), with the normal and obeying\nSnell’s law:  \nwhere \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) are the velocities of propagation in the two\nmedia, and \\(n_1 =(c/v_1), n_2 =(c/v_2)\\) are the indices of\nrefraction.” (Miles V. Klein’s Optics, cited from\nCartwright 1983, 46)  \nThe lack of vitamin C causes scurvy.  \nMendel’s Law of Segregation: “In a parent, the\nalleles for each character separate in the production of gametes, so\nthat only one is transmitted to each individual in the next\ngeneration.” (Rosenberg & McShea 2008, 36)  \nThe Area Law in Island-Biogeography: “the equilibrium\nnumber \\(S\\) of a species of a given taxonomic group on an island\n(as far as creatures are concerned) increases [polynomially] with the\nislands area [A]: \\(S = c\\times A^z\\). The (positive-valued)\nconstants \\(c\\) and \\(z\\) are specific to the taxonomic group\nand island group.” (Lange 2000, 235f.; Lange 2002, 416f.)  \nPeople’s actions are goal-oriented, in the sense that if person\n\\(x\\) wants \\(A\\) and believes \\(B\\) to be an optimal means\nfor achieving \\(A\\), then \\(x\\) will attempt to do \\(B\\)\n(Fodor 1987; Dray 1957, 132ff).  \nThe Law of Demand: Under the condition of perfect\ncompetition, an increase of demand of a commodity leads to an increase\nof price, given that the quantity of the supply of the commodity\nremains constant (Roberts 2004, 159; Kincaid 2004, 177).  \nThe lack of social integration results in a higher probability of\nattempted suicides.  \nThese generalizations may be explained in terms of lower level\nsciences, but this is not our focus here. What is important for our\npurposes is that all of these generalizations are non-universal. That\nis, there are (actual and merely possible) situations in which the\nabove generalizations do not hold, although all the\nconditions obtain that are explicitly stated in the antecedents of\nthese generalizations. For instance, there are situations in which the\nfollowing is the case: at the interface between dielectric media,\nthere is a refracted ray in the second medium lying in the plane of\nincidence, making an angle \\(\\theta_t\\), with the normal and this ray\ndoes not obey the equation \\(\\sin \\theta/\\sin \\theta_t = n_2 /n_1\\),\nthe lack of vitamin C does not cause scurvy, the alleles separate\ndifferently than Mendel’s law of Segregation describes, the\nequilibrium number of a species does not increase in accord with the\nArea Law, people fail to act in a goal-oriented fashion, and an\nincrease of demand of a commodity does not lead to an increase of\nprice (even if the condition of perfect competition were\nrealized). \nHowever, even though the generalizations are non-universal they do\nplay a role in explanations and predictions, they may be used for\npurposes of manipulation and they support counterfactuals. \nThe question arises how to deal with this situation. Are these\ngeneralizations to be classified as laws—laws that pertain only\nto special conditions, i.e., ceteris paribus laws—or\nare they something entirely different. Given the fact that laws play a\nmajor role in most accounts of explanation, causation etc., there seem\nto be basically three options: \nThe difference between options (b) and (c) may be to some extent\nmerely terminological. Woodward and Hitchcock, for example, replace\nlaws with ‘invariant generalizations’ (see section 6.2)\nbut admit that their account may be read as a\nreconceptualization of lawhood (see Woodward and Hitchcock\n2003, hereafter EG1, 3). \nThe motivation of those who take option (c) and stick to the concept\nof law is that the generalizations cited above have enough in common\nwith Newton’s first law or the Schrödinger-equation to\nclassify them as laws. For instance, they play the same kind of role\nin explanation, prediction, and they support counterfactuals. There\nare two beneficial consequences of this particular approach. First\n(against option (a)), it need not be denied that there are genuine\nexplanations etc. in the special sciences. Second (against option\n(b)), in analogy to the traditional view, the concept of a law (albeit\nof a non-universal or ceteris paribus law) can be used in\nexplications of notions such as explanation, and causation. \nThe main problem for those who choose option (c) is that they have to\nspell out what is meant by a non-universal law (statement) and how it\ncan perform similar explanatory and predictive tasks as a universal\nlaw. A convenient way to reconstruct the debate about option (c) is to\nunderstand non-universal laws as statements that are qualified by a\nceteris paribus (henceforth, “cp”) clause. Yet,\nhow to understand the meaning of the cp-clause is an open question\nthat is answered differently by various philosophers. \nBefore we discuss various accounts of cp-laws, several issues\nsurrounding the notion of “ceteris paribus”\nshould be distinguished in order to structure the debate: \nHowever, if there are cp-laws further questions arise: \nHaving distinguished these issues, it should be clear that\nthe debate about cp-clauses and cp-laws does not exist.\nInstead, theories of “cp” engage in different and often\nseparable enterprises. \nSection 2 gives, on the one hand, an account of the explicit use of\ncp-clauses (mainly) in the literature on economic issues from\nscholasticism to modern economics (section 2.1.). On the other hand,\nwe sketch two problems in philosophy of science and philosophy of mind\nthat explain why the issue of cp-laws became an intensely discussed\nissue since the 1980s (section 2.2,). \nSection 3 distinguishes different readings of the cp-clause and a\nfortiori different kinds of cp-laws. In section 3.1, exclusive\ncp-laws (factors not mentioned in the antecedent of the law are\nassumed to be absent) are distinguished from comparative\ncp-laws (factors not mentioned in the antecedent of the law are\nassumed to be constant). In line with the bulk of the\nrelevant literature, we focus on exclusive cp-laws. In section 3.2, a\ndistinction between definite and indefinite cp-laws is presented. \nSection 4 presents the main challenge to cp-laws. It appears that many\nlaws, e.g., of the special sciences, if taken as strict laws, turn out\nto be false; however, if they are hedged by a cp-clause they appear to\nlack a clear meaning and appear to be empirically untestable. All of\nthe major accounts of cp-laws discussed in sections 5 to 8 are\nreactions to this challenge. \nSection 5 deals with the most influential early accounts of cp-laws.\nThey take cp-laws to be incomplete laws that can be completed. Whereas\nFodor (1987) and others (see Section 5.1) focus on special science\ncp-laws that can be completed by adding factors to the antecedent of\nthe law that are dealt with in more fundamental sciences, Pietroski\nand Rey (1995) take cp-laws to contain (implicit) promises: that is,\nwhen asserting a cp-law, one promises to be able to cite factors that\ncomplete the law on a case by case basis if the consequent of the\ncp-law does not obtain (although the antecedent does). In section 5.2,\nwe present several objections against such completer accounts. \nSection 6 presents two versions of stability theories of laws in the\nspecial sciences, namely Lange’s (2000, 2002, 2005) stability\ntheory in section 6.1, and Woodward & Hitchcock’s (see EG1 and Hitchcock & Woodward 2003, hereafter EG2)\ninvariance theory in section 6.2. The common general idea of\ninvariance or stability theories of laws is that the laws differ from\nmerely accidental non-laws in virtue of their invariance or stability\nunder counterfactual suppositions. According to this view, ceteris\nparibus or non-universal laws differ from universal laws in\ndegree, not in kind: universal laws hold under all counterfactual\nsuppositions while ceteris paribus or non-universal laws\nmerely hold for a limited range of suppositions. \nSection 7 deals with dispositional accounts of cp-laws. The unifying\nidea is that the laws of nature are grounded in dispositional\nproperties. We distinguish two different dispositional accounts of\ncp-laws: On Hüttemann’s (2014) version, that is based on pioneering\nwork of Mill and Cartwright, law-statements are statements about\ndispositions, tendencies, or capacities rather than about overt\nbehavior, and thus cp-laws are turned into strict laws. Bird’s\n(2007) version of dispositionalism, by contrast, does not turn cp-laws\ninto strict laws. Instead, it identifies cp-laws with generalizations\nhedged by a cp-clause that are grounded in non-fundamental\ndispositional properties that admit of interferers. \nSection 8 deals with normality theories of laws. The guiding idea of\nnormality theories is that “cp, all \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s” means that normally \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s.\nThe various normality accounts differ in their explication of the\nnotion of normality. While Schurz (2001b, 2002) interprets normality\nas a high conditional, objective probability of the consequent of the\nlaw statement given the antecedent (see section 8.1), Spohn (2012)\nsuggests to explicate the normality conditions in terms of degrees of\nbelief and ranking functions over possible worlds (see section\n8.2). \nSection 9 sketches the relevance of cp-laws in other areas of\nphilosophy (such as epistemology and ethics). \nSection 10 is a survey to recent work on cp-laws in metaphysics,\nphilosophy of language and linguistics as well as in other\nsciences. \nSection 11 presents a brief conclusion and an outlook for future\nresearch. \nFinally, section 12 provides a concise overview of the relevant\nliterature.  \nThe Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” or\n“caeteris paribus”—literally meaning\n“other things being equal”— was used in a\nnon-technical sense by\n Cicero.[1]\n However, most of the early uses of the ceteris\nparibus-clause are found in economics. In economic contexts the\nuse of ceteris paribus clauses can be traced back to Petrus\n Olivi[2]\n in 1295. In the 16th century, Juan de\n Medina[3]\n and Luis de\n Molina[4]\n used “ceteris paribus” while discussing economic\nissues. \nIn 1662, William Petty was probably the first to use the term in an\nEnglish language\n publication.[5]\n In his Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, Petty qualifies\nhis labor theory of value by a “caeteris paribus”\nclause: \nJohn Stuart Mill used the explicit phrase “ceteris\nparibus” only\n occasionally[6]\n but it had an important impact because he characterized economy by\nits way of coping with disturbing factors: \nSince economy is thus concerned with one cause only, its laws describe\nwhat would happen provided there are no other causal factors. \nThe view of cp-laws promoted by Mill is the\nabsence-of-disturbing-factors view (see section 7). Another view is\nthe normal-tendency view of cp-laws (see section 8). The historical\nroots of the view are, for example, found in John Elliot\nCairnes’s description of the methodology of economics in his\nCharacter and Logical Method of Political Economy: \nCairnes (1888, 103) uses the expression “ceteris\nparibus” in order to refer to “what would or what\ntends to take place” if normal conditions obtained. \nThe use of ceteris paribus-clauses was advocated and\npopularized by Alfred Marshall in the late 19th century. It was\nMarshall’s genuine contribution to economics to advocate partial\nequilibrium analysis. Marshall claimed that an analysis of this kind\nholds merely ‘ceteris paribus’. In his\ninfluential Principles of Economics, Marshall defines the\ntask of economists in terms of the phrase ‘ceteris\nparibus’: \nIn the introduction to the same work, Marshall explains why economics\nis interested in the isolation of causes by assuming that other\nthings are equal: \nIn a similar vein, Lionel Robbins claims in his classic paper An\nEssay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science that\neconomic laws and antecedent facts deductively imply economic\npredictions, but only if other things remain\n unchanged.[8] \nThe use of “ceteris paribus” in economics and in\nphilosophy of economics is not of merely historiographical interest.\nIn current philosophy of economics and economics, the use of and the\ndebate on “ceteris paribus” is a vital issue: \nOutside the economics literature the use of the ceteris\nparibus-phrase became a central and also controversial issue in\nsome areas of philosophy of science and in philosophy of mind in the\n1980s. \nThe fact that test procedures for scientific theories or hypotheses\nare reliable only if disturbing factors are excluded or at least\ncontrolled for had already been noted by Carnap (1956, 69). Canfield\nand Lehrer (1961) have pointed out that in order to figure as premises\nof deductive-nomological explanations, the laws of physics have to be\nfurnished with cp-clauses. They provide the following example to\nsupport their claim: \nLetting ‘\\(Tx\\)’ mean ‘\\(x\\) is a\nthread’; ‘\\(Wx\\)’ mean the complex\nstatement ‘\\(x\\) is loaded with a weight exceeding that which\ncharacterizes its tensile strength’; and\n‘\\(Bx\\)’ mean ‘\\(x\\) breaks’ we\nwrite the inference schema: \nwhere the function \\(L(Tx \\amp Wx,\nBx)\\) indicates that there is a lawlike connection between\nthe conjunction ‘\\(Tx \\amp Wx\\)’\nand ‘\\(Bx\\)’ but leaves the nature of the\nconnection unspecified. (Canfield & Lehrer 1961, 205) \nThe envisaged prediction (‘\\(Bx\\)’) no longer\nholds if a magnet neutralizes the effect of the weight\n(‘\\(Mx\\)’). This can be accounted for if the\nabsence of the magnet is explicitly mentioned in the law. The problem\nis that the law must be complete with respect to all such factors that\nmight prevent the breaking of the thread. The completeness condition\nrequires that there are no further disturbing factors—i.e., it\nrequires an exclusive cp-clause (see section 3) Canfield and Lehrer\nalso present an argument for why these cp-clauses cannot be defined\naway, namely that any such attempt leads to an infinite regress of\nfurther cp-clauses. \nThe issue of disturbing factors was taken up in 1970 by Lakatos who\nraised it as a problem for the falsificationist methodology: \nPopper only briefly commented on this claim in a footnote (see Popper\n1974, 1186f.), while other authors discussed it explicitly as a\nproblem for falsificationism (see, for instance, Johansen 1980).  \nHempel argues in his 1988 paper “On Provisos” that every\ninferential construal of scientific theory testing is confronted with\nthe problem that a proviso always has to be added: \nIn fact, Hempel dismisses the phrase “ceteris\nparibus” as not particularly helpful. \nCarnap, Lakatos and Hempel all argue that in theory testing we usually\nimplicitly assume an additional premise that states that there are no\ndisturbing factors. Even though in the later literature Hempel’s\npaper has been taken to be evidence for the existence of\ncp-laws even in fundamental physics, the issue of whether a\ncp-clause has to be added as an extra premise in theory\ntesting has to be distinguished from the claim that the laws\nthemselves should be read as containing an implicit cp-clause (for a\ncriticism of this conflation cf. Earman and Roberts 1999, 442ff.;\nSchrenk 2007a, 25–36; Eliot 2011). \nTwo further developments lead to the explicit discussion of\ncp-laws. \nFirst, in her paper “The Truth doesn’t explain\nmuch” (reprinted in Cartwright 1983), Nancy Cartwright\ncriticizes the DN-model of explanation on the grounds that the alleged\nlaws on which the explanation relies (according to the DN-model) are\nnot true, but rather generalizations that hold under special,\ntypically ideal, conditions only. These cp-laws, she claims, will not\ndo the work required: \nCartwright (1983, 46f.) illustrates her claim using Snell’s law\n(for details, see our first example in section 1.1 above).\nSnell’s law is false if read as a universal generalization\nbecause, among other things, it is true only with respect to isotropic\nmedia. \nCartwright explicitly calls Snell’s law a cp-law. Many\nlaws we take to be strict universal laws are in fact cp-laws that hold\nin special circumstances only. According to Cartwright, the problem\narises that these laws cover only special or ideal conditions (most\nmedia are anisotropic), whereas in scientific practice they are used\nto explain phenomena in non-ideal situations as well. Cp-laws seem to\nplay an essential role in explanations but there is no account\navailable of how cp-laws can do this work. \nSecond, the issue of cp-laws became important in the\nphilosophy of mind as well. Davidson argued for his anomalous monism\non the basis of a stark contrast between homonomic and heteronomic\ngeneralizations. Homonomic generalizations are those that can be\nimproved in the same vocabulary, in which they are stated. This\nrequires, as Davidson puts it, a comprehensive closed system that is\nonly provided by physics. Outside of physics, we have only heteronomic\ngeneralizations, i.e., generalizations that can be made precise only\nby drawing on the vocabulary of another science. As a consequence,\nDavidson assumes that only physics has laws, whereas there cannot be\npsycho-physical or psychological laws. More generally,\nDavidson’s argument implies that there are no special science\nlaws (see Davidson 1963,\n 219).[9] \nThis claim provoked discussions about whether there are genuine\npsychological laws (cf. Fodor 1974, 1987, 1991, 1997; Kim 1985, LePore\nand Loewer 1987, 1989; Carrier 1998). Some authors, for example\nSchiffer (1991) and Earman, Roberts and Smith (2002), have even argued\nthat no special science (from biology upwards) has genuine laws of its\nown. By contrast, most authors have supported only the weaker claim\nthat there are no strict special science laws, but have\nargued that special science laws should be construed as laws that\ncontain implicit cp-clauses. \nFodor (1987) observes that we do use psychological generalizations (in\nlater papers, e.g., Fodor (1991) he uses ‘law’ instead of\n‘generalization’) for predicting and explaining human\nbehavior. These generalizations or laws, says Fodor, are\nnon-strict—they are hedged by a cp-clause. Nevertheless, these\nclaims, he insisted are neither false nor uninformative. \nSo, by the end of the 1980s cp-laws had become focal in two important\ndebates: one about the structure of scientific explanations in\ngeneral, the other about the status of the special sciences as\nautonomous scientific disciplines. \nIt has been argued that “ceteris paribus” is an\nambiguous notion. Two distinctions will help to disambiguate\nthe notion: the distinction between comparative and exclusive cp-laws\n(section 3.1), and the distinction between definite and indefinite\ncp-laws (section 3.2). \nSchurz (2002) suggests distinguishing between two conceptions of\ncp-law: comparative versus exclusive. Comparative\ncp-laws require that factors not mentioned in the antecedent or the\nconsequent of the law remain unchanged. By contrast, exclusive cp-laws\nassert the connection between antecedent and consequent only under the\ncondition that certain factors are excluded. \nThe comparative sense of cp-clauses derives from the literal meaning\nof “ceteris paribus” as “the others being\nequal”. A comparative cp-law asserts that the increase (or\ndecrease) of the value of a ‘variable’ \\(X\\) leads to\nan increase (or decrease) of the value of another variable, say\n\\(Y\\), provided that all other (possibly unknown)\n\\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) that describe the\nstates of the considered system (or at least those\n\\(X\\)-independent variables that are potentially interfering)\nremain at same values. Thereby, a variable \\((Z_i)\\) is\ncalled \\(X\\)-independent iff it is not causally\n(or nomologically) influenced by \\(X\\). So, to repeat, that a\nvariable \\(Z\\) is \\(X\\)-independent means (by the above\ndefinition) only that it is not caused by \\(X\\); though it may well\nbe a cause of \\(X\\) (see Schurz 2014 for a novel distinction\nbetween ceteris paribus and ceteris rectis\nlaws). \nThe reason why cp-laws of this type are called\n“comparative” in Schurz (2002) is that the requirement\nthat the other \\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) ‘are\nequal’, or remain at the same values, only makes sense if the\nlaw compares two states of a described (kind of)\nsystem. These two systems differ in the value of the antecedent\nvariable \\(X\\), but agree in their values of the\n\\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\). If the latter\ncondition holds for all possible values of the\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\), the comparative\ncp-law is called unrestricted; otherwise it is called restricted (see\nbelow). Another plausible name for this kind of cp-law would be\n‘equality cp-law’ (this was suggested by the referee),\nbecause it merely requires that the remainder factors are\n‘equal’ in the two compared states of the described\nsystem, rather than that some of them have to be excluded (as in\nexclusive cp-laws).  \nA terminological note: With a “variable” \\(X\\)\n(in the mathematical sense) we mean a functional property of\nindividuals \\(d\\in D\\) of a domain \\(D\\), i.e., a\nfunction \\(X: D\\rightarrow \\ran(X)\\) from \\(D\\) into\n\\(\\ran(X)\\). The set \\(\\ran(X)\\) (for “range of\n\\(X\\)”) is the set of possible values\n\\(x\\in\\ran(X)\\) of the variable \\(X\\); if \\(X\\) is\nquantitative, \\(\\ran(X) = \\Re\\), i.e., the set of real numbers.\n(If \\(ran(X) = \\Re\\) and the values of \\(X\\) are distributed\naccording to a given probability distribution, then \\(X\\) is what\nis called a ‘random variable’ in probability theory; cf.\nHays and Winkler 1975). In what follows,\n“\\(d_{(i)}\\)” denotes proper individual\nvariables (in the logical sense) and\n“\\(x_{(i)}\\)” denotes possible values of\nfunctional variables \\(X_{(i)}\\). An important\nsubcase of comparative cp-laws are probabilistic comparative\ncp-laws, in which the quantitative variables \\(X\\) express the\nprobabilities \\(P(F)\\) of some qualitative\nproperties expressed by predicates \\(F\\) (for instance, \\(F\\)\nmight be the increased probability of a car accident in example (2)\nbelow). \nHere are two examples of comparative cp-laws: \nWhile (1) states a quantitative relation between the\nincreases, only an ordinal relation between the increases is\npredicted in (2). \nComparative cp-laws are connected to the invariance approach of Woodward and Hitchcock (see §6.2 below). According to this\naccount, a cp-generalization expresses what would happen if an\nintervention on \\(X\\) would\n occur.[10]\n In causal graph theory, an intervention is defined as an operation\nwhich changes the value of \\(X\\) and decouples \\(X\\) from all\ncausal parents of \\(X\\) (cf. Pearl 2000, 23f, Woodward 2003, 98).\nThis notion of an intervention has the effect that a change of\n\\(X\\)’s value (as the result of an intervention) will not\nchange the value of any other \\(X\\)-independent\nvariable—which is exactly what is required by a comparative\ncp-law. \nIn the philosophical debate, cp-laws have often been understood in the\nother exclusive sense. An exclusive cp-law asserts that a\ncertain state or event-type \\(A\\) leads to another state or\nevent-type \\(B\\), provided disturbing factors or\ninfluences are absent. \nTerminological note: ‘\\(A\\)’ is called the\nantecedent and ‘\\(B\\)’ the consequent\n‘predicate’. In terms of quantitative variables\n\\(X\\), the predicate formula \\(A(d)\\) may express, for\nexample, that \\(d\\) has a certain \\(X\\)-value \\(x\\), or has\nchanged its \\(X\\)-value from \\(x_1\\) to\n\\(x_2\\). \nThus, an exclusive cp-clause does not merely require holding all other\n\\(X\\)-independent and potentially disturbing factors constant; it\nrather excludes the presence of disturbing factors.\nMore generally, it restricts the possible values of the remainder\nvariables \\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) to those\nvalue ranges where they cannot disturb the cp-law. Therefore, the\nexclusion-clause of exclusive cp-laws may always be equivalently\nreformulated as a clause which requires that certain truth conditions\nfor the exclusive cp-law hold, namely those conditions which exclude\ndisturbing factors. In this sense, Cartwright has remarked that\n“the literal translation is ‘other things being\nequal’, yet it would be more apt to read ‘ceteris\nparibus’ as ‘other things being\nright’” (1983, 45). Joseph (1980, 777) talked\nabout “ceteris absentibus” clauses, and Hempel\n(1988, 29) calls exclusive cp-clauses “Provisos”\n(“… provided disturbing factors are\nabsent”). \nHere are two examples of exclusive cp-laws—(3) comes from\nphysics and (4) from psychology: \nIn (3), the cp-clause requires that other (non-negligible) forces on\nthe planet except that of the sun are—not merely constant\nbut—absent. Likewise, the cp-clause of (4) requires\nthat any factors causing irrational behavior be absent. \nThe distinction between comparative and exclusive cp-laws is not\ndisjoint: some cp-laws are both comparative and exclusive, as for\nexample in the following example from theoretical economy: \nNot only must the compared economies agree in remainder factors such\nas the supply of the good (this is the comparative aspect); various\ninterferers, such as political regulations which prevent an increase\nof prices, must be excluded (that is the exclusive aspect). \nComparative cp-laws which are not restricted by an exclusive cp-clause\nare also called unrestricted comparative cp-laws. They assert\nan invariant connection between an \\(X\\)-increase and an\n\\(Y\\)-increase for all possible values of \\(X\\) and of\nthe \\(X\\)-independent remainder variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\). Unrestricted\nprobabilistic comparative cp-laws have been suggested as an\nexplication of generic causal relations (Cartwright 1989,\n145f; Eells 1991, 85f): they assert that a variable \\(X\\) is a\nprobabilistic cause of some other variable \\(Y\\) in all possible\ncircumstances, where these circumstances are expressed in terms of the\nvalues of \\(X\\) and the \\(X\\)-independent remainder\nvariables \\(Z_i (1\\le i\\le n)\\). \nUnfortunately, unrestricted invariance claims are rarely true. One\nexample mentioned by Cartwright (1989, §5.2) in which they do\nindeed hold is the force law of classical physics, \\(f :=\nS_{i \\in I}f_i = m \\cdot a\\), which equates the total force\n\\(f\\) with the sum of all component forces. In that case, an\nincrease of a component force \\(f_i\\) will produce an increase of\nacceleration for all possible values of \\(m\\) and the\nremainder forces \\(f_i (i\\in I)\\).  In Schurz (2002, §2, theorem\n1) it is proved that \\(X_i\\) is connected with \\(Y\\) by an\nunrestricted comparative cp-law, where \\(Y\\) is a function of\nindependent variables \\(X_1 ,\\ldots ,X_n\\), iff the \\(X_1 ,\\ldots\n,X_n\\) are\nnon-interacting causes of \\(Y\\) in a certain (technically\ndefined) sense. \nIn moderately complex systems, the composition of causes is usually\ninteractive. Therefore, these systems will only obey\nrestricted comparative cp-laws (Cartwright 1983, 64ff.;\nDupré 1984). Restricted comparative cp-laws are nothing but\ncomparative cp-laws in the scope of an exclusive cp-clause, which\nassert the comparative cp-relation only for a restricted class of\ncircumstances, expressed in terms of allowed values of the independent\nvariable \\(X\\) and the \\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_i\\). In this sense, examples (1) and (2) above\nare exclusive-comparative cp-laws because in (1), the cp-connection\nbetween temperature and volume holds only for approximately ideal\ngases, and in (2) the cp-connection holds only under psychologically\nnormal conditions. \nAlthough the definiens of a comparative cp-law relating\n\\(X\\) with \\(Y\\) refers to “all \\(X\\)-independent\nvariables”, comparative cp-laws are nevertheless empirically\ntestable by the method of randomized experiments (cf. Fisher 1951). In\nthis method, one randomly splits a sample into two subgroups, an\n“experimental group” and a “control group”,\nthen enforces an increase of the value of \\(X\\) on the experimental\nbut not on the control group, and finally compares the two samples\nconcerning the value of \\(Y\\). Since the split of the original\nsample was random, experimental and control group will agree in their\ndistribution of all \\(X\\)-independent remainder variables,\napart from random errors. Thus, one can apply this method without\nknowing which \\(X\\)-independent variables are causally relevant for\n\\(Y\\) and which are not. If there is a significant change of the\nvalue of \\(Y\\) in the experimental group compared with the control\ngroup, the cp-law “\\(X\\)-increase leads to an\n\\(Y\\)-change” is confirmed (strictly speaking only the\nrestriction of this law to the population from which the sample has\nbeen taken is strongly confirmed, while confirmation of the\nunrestricted cp-law requires tests for a variety of different\n“populations”, i.e., distributions of \\(X\\)-independent\nremainder variables). On the other hand, if there is no significant\nchange of \\(Y\\)’s value, the cp-law is strongly disconfirmed,\neven in its unrestricted form. This does not mean that the method of\nrandomized controlled experiment is free from error possibilities. In\nparticular, the experimentally induced change of \\(X\\)’s\nvalue may have smuggled in unrecognized \\(X\\)-dependent variables\n(i.e., unrecognized side-effects) which are partly responsible for the\nresulting change of \\(Y\\). For example, in a teaching experiment\ncomparing two teaching methods (e.g., the new method and the old\nmethod), the new teaching method may come out as more successful than\nthe old one—yet not because of intrinsic properties of the new\nmethod, but just because the fact that the teaching method was\nnew has increased the motivation of its teachers. \nAn important distinction concerning only exclusive cp-laws is that\nbetween definite and indefinite exclusive cp-laws. A\ndefinite exclusive cp-law specifies the disturbing factors\nwhich are excluded (or the validity conditions which are required) in\nthe antecedent of the law. In other words, a definite exclusive cp-law\n“exclusively cp, if \\(A(d)\\), then\n\\(B(d)\\)” has a strict completion of the form\n“For all \\(d\\): if \\(A(d)\\) and \\(C(d)\\),\nthen \\(B(d)\\)”, where the completing condition\n“\\(C(d)\\)” excludes the presence of the\nspecified disturbing factors in application \\(d\\). Earman, Roberts\nand Smith (2002, 283f.) call definite exclusive cp-laws lazy\ncp-laws. \nHowever, in most cases such a strict completion is impossible. This is\nespecially clear for our non-physical example (2), as well as for the\nfollowing example (6) from biology: \nThe number of possible factors which may disturb a bird’s flying\ncapability is potentially infinite. In other words, for every\ncondition \\(C\\) which excludes a finite list of such factors the\ncompleted law “All birds satisfying \\(C\\) can fly” will\nstill have to face further exceptions—hence, a strict completion\nof this law is impossible. Exclusive cp-laws of this sort are called\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws, or in the terminology of Earman, Roberts\nand Smith (2002), non-lazy cp-laws. \nIt is a widely agreed in philosophy that the real significance of\nexclusive cp-laws lies in situations where strict completion is\nimpossible (for example, cf. Rescher 1994, 14; Pietroski & Rey\n1995, 84, 102; Horgan & Tienson 1996, 119f.). In that case, the\nexclusive cp-law is indefinite, which means that its\nexclusive cp-clause consists in a universal second order condition\nwhich excludes all kinds of disturbing factors to the law, whatever\nthey are. Formally, also an indefinite exclusive cp-law may be written\nas a strictly completed law of the form “if disturbing factors\nare excluded, then \\(A\\)s will always be\n\\(C\\)s”—only that the meaning of “all disturbing\nfactors” is now unclear which leads to various sorts of\ndeficiencies that are discussed in the next section. \nExclusive cp-laws of the form “exclusively cp, \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s” admit exceptions, i.e., instantiations of \\(A\\)s\nwhich are not-\\(B\\)s (Pietroski and Rey speak of\n“abnormal” instances; 1995, 88). A philosophical\nreconstruction of exclusive cp-laws—which includes restricted\ncomparative cp-laws and, thus, the majority of all cp-laws—faces\na severe problem. This problem can be articulated in the form of a\ndilemma. This dilemma has been formulated by Lange (1993, 235), who\nattributes it to Hempel (1988). \nFirst horn: If exclusive cp-laws are reconstructed as some\nsort of strict law, then they will tend to be false. Typically, it\nwill not be the case that all \\(A\\)s satisfying a completer\ncondition \\(C\\) are \\(B\\)s, since the range of potentially\ndisturbing factors is typically indefinable. For instance, the\nrelationship between supply and price is not always as the law of\nsupply says (or, as it seems to say prima facie), because an\ninterfering factor might occur. In other words, special science laws\nthat instantiate perfect regularities are—mildly\nput—“scarce” (Cartwright 1983, 45). Yet, if one\nsupposes that the law is to be formalized as a universally quantified\nconditional sentence, then one counter-instance (due to a disturbing\nfactor) to the universally quantified sentence means that it is\nfalse. \nSecond horn: If we instead suppose that an indefinite\nexclusive ceteris paribus clause is attached to the law so\nthat it means “All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s, if nothing\ninterferes”, then the cp-law in question is in danger of\nlacking empirical content. It lacks empirical content because it seems\nto say nothing more than “All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s or\nnot-(All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s)”. If this is true, then\nexclusive cp-laws are analytically true sentences and, therefore,\ntrivially true. This, however, is an unwelcome consequence because\nlaws of the special sciences should be reconstructed as empirical\nstatements—not as sentences being true in virtue of meaning. \nBoth horns are quite unpleasant results for any philosopher looking\nfor a theory of non-strict laws. To deal with this dilemma is a\ncentral challenge for every theory of ceteris paribus laws\n(Lange 1993; Earman and Roberts 1999; Earman, Roberts and Smith 2002).\nIn the following section, several attempts to cope with this dilemma\nare presented and tenacious problems of them are discussed. \nThe general idea behind completer approaches is that the best way to\nexplicate exclusive cp-laws is to add the missing conditions for a\nstrict implication into the antecedent of the law statement. There are\ntwo quite different possibilities to do this. The first possibility is\nto add these conditions explicitly, by appropriate descriptions of the\nfirst order individual variables involved in the law. If this were the\ncorrect account, all correct cp-laws would turn out to be definite\nexclusive cp-laws (or lazy cp-laws in the terminology of Earman,\nRoberts and Smith 2002). The second possibility is to add these\nconditions by way of a second order quantification over first order\npredicate variables, which apply to the first order individual\nvariables of the law. In this account, cp-laws are turned into\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws. \nFodor’s starting point for his account of cp-laws is\nDavidson’s distinction between homonomic and heteronomic\ngeneralizations (see section 2.2): \nSo, Fodor’s idea is that the additional factors whose existence\nis required by the exclusive cp-clause cannot be completely specified\nwithin the conceptual resources of the special sciences, although this\ncould be done (at least in principle) within the vocabulary of some\nmore fundamental science such as neurophysiology or, ultimately,\nfundamental physics. Fodor calls the missing factors\n‘completers’. A physical microdescription of the\nantecedent condition \\(A\\) is called a realizer of \\(A\\) (the\nsame \\(A\\) may have several different realizers). \n(7) A factor \\(C\\) is a completer relative to a realizer \\(R\\)\nof \\(A\\) and a consequent predicate \\(B\\) iff: \n(Fodor 1991, 23) \nA first option (which Fodor conceives of as insufficient) would be to\ndefine the truth conditions of a cp-law as follows: \nSchiffer has objected to this account on the grounds that if \\(A\\)\nis a (mental) functional state, which can be realized by very\ndifferent states \\(R_i\\), it is highly unlikely\nthat there is a completer for every realization (cf. Schiffer 1991, 5)\nFodor accepts this objection and provides the following account: \nWhile condition (9)(i) repeats the simpler definition in (8),\ncondition (9)(ii) expresses the idea that if \\(A\\) is, for\ninstance, an intentional state and goes into the antecedent of many\nlaws, then even if \\(R_i\\) does not have\ncompleters in the cp-law in question, cp\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is\nstill true, if \\(R_i\\) does have completers in\nmany other cp-laws. \nMott (1992) provided the following counterexample to condition (ii) of\nthis account of truth-conditions: cp, if a person is thirsty, then she\nwill eat salt. This comes out as a true cp-law, because on the one\nhand, very likely many, maybe all, realizers of “being\nthirsty” lack completers (because nobody tends to eat salt when\nthirsty). On the other hand, ‘being thirsty’ might very\nwell go into the antecedent of many other cp-laws for which there are\nsuch completers. Mott’s counter-example can be avoided if one\nadds to (ii) the requirement that for sufficiently many realizers\n\\(R_j\\) of \\(A\\) there exist completers with\nrespect to \\(B\\) (see Silverberg 1996 and Earman and Roberts 1999,\nsection 9 for discussion). \nAlthough Fodor starts with the hope that the missing conditions of\nexclusive cp-laws could eventually be specified in the fundamental\nscience, his definition of exclusive cp-laws involves a second order\nquantification over variable (unspecified) completers of independent\nexception-explainers. Hence, his account of exclusive cp-laws belongs\nto the family of indefinite exclusive cp-laws. Because of this fact\nFodor’s and related accounts face severe problems, as will be\ndiscussed in section\n 5.2.[11] \nSchiffer, Fodor and Mott try to explicate cp-laws by ordinary\ntruth-conditions. In contrast, Pietroski and Rey provide stronger\nconditions for what they call “non-vacuous truth”, in\nterms of epistemic conditions such as explanation and\nindependent confirmability. Pietroski and Rey compare cp-clauses to\ncheques: \nCompletion is conceived here as explanatory completion and it is\nrequired only post factum. If there is a counter-instance of\nthe law in question, we are committed to explain why the law was not\ninstantiated: \nFor the cp-law to be acceptable in spite of the counter-instance we\nneed independent evidence for the existence of the disturbing factor.\nIt would not be acceptable if the only evidence for the existence of\nthe disturbing factor were the counter-instance we started with. \nPietroski and Rey (1995, 92) take a cp-law to be non-vacuously true\nand hence epistemically acceptable iff (in simplified words) the\nfollowing conditions are met: \n(10) cp\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is non-vacuously true iff \nPietroski & Rey’s (1995) account involves a second order\nquantification over unspecified exception-explainers. Thus, as in the\ncase of semantic completer accounts, their account explicates\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws and faces severe problems to be explained\nin the next section. \nSeveral authors have independently shown that completer approaches are\nunsatisfactory. Earman and Roberts (1999, 454f) provide arguments\nwhich show that an exclusive cp-law in the sense of Pietroski and Rey\ncannot escape the problem of vacuity. Their example is the\nalleged cp-law “cp, all spherical bodies conduct\nelectricity”. Every failure of this law can be explained in\nterms of a factor, for which we have independent evidence,\nviz. the molecular structure of the body in question. Schurz\n(2001a) proves that Pietroski & Rey’s exclusive cp-laws are\nnot vacuous but almost vacuous. More precisely, the content\nof “exclusively cp, \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” in the sense\nof Pietroski & Rey’s definition (10) is equivalent to the\nclaim that for every event of the form “\\(d\\) is an \\(A\\)\nand \\(d\\) is (or is not) a \\(B\\)” there exists a true\nstrict completer \\(C(d)\\) such that either “All\n\\((A\\wedge C)\\)s are \\(B\\)s” or “All\n\\((A\\wedge C)\\)s are \\(\\neg B\\)s” is a strictly true\nlaw. This means that conditional on \\(A\\), every \\(B\\)-event or\nnot\\(-B\\)-event is assumed a deterministic and independently\nidentifiable cause, whatever this cause may be. This presupposition of\ndeterminism is both too strong and too weak: It is too weak because it\ndoes not establish a relevant nomological connection between \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\). It is too strong because in all areas involving random\nprocesses, determinism does not hold. Woodward (2002, §2) has\ndemonstrated that a similar criticism affects Fodor’s\naccount. \nThere is an even more serious accidentality-problem that is\nconnected to the almost-vacuity of indefinite exclusive cp-laws. An\nexclusive cp-law may be true although its antecedent is not at all\nnomologically or causally relevant for its consequent. All sorts of\nevents are connected by indefinite exclusive cp-laws, provided only\nthat they have deterministic causes, which for Pietroski and Rey\n(1995) have additionally to be independently testable, and for Fodor\n(1991) have to be nomologically relevant (cf. Woodward 2002, 309, (ii,\niii)). For example, Woodward (2002, 310) demonstrates that according\nto the explications of Pietroski and Rey (1995), Fodor (1991) and\nHausman (1992), the exclusive cp-law “all charged particles\naccelerate at a rate of \\(n\\) meters/sec\\(^2\\)” is a\ntrue exclusive cp-law for arbitrary values of \\(n\\). Schurz (2002,\n364) demonstrates that according to these accounts “if a person\nlooks to the right, she will see a kangaroo” is a true exclusive\ncp-law. Also, Earman & Robert’s example can be read as\ndemonstrating the accidentality of “cp, all spherical\nbodies conduct electricity”, although the example was originally\nused to show that this statement is vacuously true. \nThe common guiding idea of invariance or stability theories is that\nthe laws differ from non-laws in virtue of their invariance or\nstability under counterfactual suppositions. \n“Stability” and “invariance” are often taken\nto be synonyms. For the sake of clarity, we will use\n“stability” to refer to Lange’s stability theory of\nlaws (section 6.1) and we will use “invariance” to refer\nto Woodward & Hitchcock’s invariance theory of laws (section\n6.2). \nIn stability/invariance accounts, laws qualified by a cp-clause are\nconsidered to be non-strict in the sense that they hold true only\nunder a limited range of counterfactual suppositions. Different\nversions of invariance or stability theories differ in how they\ndetermine this limited range of counterfactual suppositions.\nIn this sense, invariance or stability theories can be understood as\nan alternative to exclusive interpretations of non-strict laws and as\nan attempt to deal with the dilemma of triviality and falsity. \nAccording to Lange (2000, 2002, 2005), the universal fundamental laws\nin physics and the cp-laws in the inexact special sciences differ only\nin degree (for a related account that does not focus on stability\nalone see Mitchell (2000)). The lawhood of universal laws and cp-laws\nis due to the same property of these statements: their stability.\nLange’s (2000, 8f.) approach consists in two steps. First, the\nrole of laws in scientific reasoning is determined: they figure in\nexplanations and predictions, they support counterfactuals, and they\nare inductively confirmed. And second, it is claimed that the laws can\nplay this role because of their characteristic stability. So, in order\nto understand Lange’s account of cp-laws, we must first clarify the\ncrucial notion of stability. \nLange’s basic idea is that laws are lawlike because they are\ntrue in a wide range of possible conditions. Most importantly, the\nlaws do not only hold true in any (non-nomic) actual\nconditions but also remain true under all (non-nomic)\ncounterfactual suppositions. Along these lines, Lange (2000,\n48f.; cf. 2009a, 20) proposes a preliminary definition of laws in\nterms of nomic preservation: \nThis definition, however, raises an obvious question: what does it\nmean to be physically possible? Roughly, a proposition \\(p\\) is a\nphysical possibility iff there is some possible world \\(w\\) where\nthe same laws of nature hold as in the actual world and \\(p\\)\nobtains at \\(w\\). But if this is true, Lange’s definition of\nlawhood seems to be circular, since being consistent with the\nlaws (of the actual world) is ultimately part of the\ndefiniens of being a law (of the actual world). Lange (2005,\n2009a, 25–28) recognizes the problem of circularity and offers\nan alternative account of laws in terms of the notion of stability. It\nsays, roughly put:  \nThis notion of stability in turn leads to a theory of laws: \nAccording to Lange (cf. 2005, chapter 4; 2009a, chapter 2), there\nexist several different stable sets: for example, the set of logical\ntruths, the set of all physical laws, and the set of all truths (which\nis trivially stable). The requirement of \\(G\\) to be non-maximal,\ni.e., to be strictly smaller than the set of all truths, is necessary\nto avoid the identification of the set of laws with the set of all\ntruths. \nLange argues that definition (13) is not affected by the circularity\nproblem, since stability does not presuppose the notion of a law, and\nthat it provides a sharp distinction between laws and merely\naccidentally true non-laws. Consider some accidentally true universal\nstatement as for example: \nAccording to Lange, this generalization is an accidental truth because\nit is not a member of a (non-maximal) stable set. For assume \\(A\\)\nis a member of some non-maximal set \\(\\Delta\\) (which may contain all\nphysical laws). By non-maximality, there exists some further\naccidental truth \\(B\\), for example, \nwhich is not in \\(\\Delta\\). If \\(\\Delta\\) is stable, every member of \\(\\Delta\\)\nmust remain true under the counterfactual supposition that\n\\(\\neg\\)A\\(\\vee \\neg B\\), since this supposition is compatible with\nevery member of \\(\\Delta\\). However, Lange (2005, 421) argues that there\nare at least some conversational contexts in which \\(A\\) does not\nhave priority over \\(B\\). Hence,\n\\(\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\rightarrow A\\) is not the\ncase, and therefore \\(\\Delta\\) is not stable under the counterfactual\nsupposition \\(\\neg A\\vee \\neg B\\). By contrast, according to\nLange, a law of nature has priority over any accidental truth in every\ncontext, and thus the laws of nature form a stable set.  \nEven assuming that Lange’s argumentation is valid (see, however,\nDemarest (2012) and Hall (2011) for criticism based on the\ncontext-sensitivity of counterfactuals), there is the worry that the\ncircularity problem has not entirely been dissolved: It reappears at\nthe level of the truth conditions for counterfactuals, since usually\nthey are formulated in terms of the laws (see, e.g., Goodman 1947;\nLewis 1973; Maudlin 2007: 21). Lange (2009a: chapter 4) answers this\nobjection by arguing that subjunctive facts are ontologically\nprimitive and the truth conditions for counterfactuals do not refer to\nlaws. He concludes that, therefore, his explications (12) and (13) are\nnot circular.  \nWe can now turn to the question how cp-laws differ from universal\nlaws. According to Lange, cp-laws are stable (sets of) propositions\nwhose application is pragmatically restricted to the purposes\nof a scientific discipline. He elaborates this idea with respect to\nthe laws in the special sciences, or inexact sciences as he calls\nthem: “A set is stable for the purpose of an inexact\nscience if and only if it is invariant under every counterfactual\nsupposition of interest to the science and consistent with the\nset” (Lange 2002, 416). Lange tries to avoid the horns of the\nFalsity-or-Triviality-Dilemma by treating ‘ceteris\nparibus’ as a name for a set \\(I\\) of interfering\nfactors. Notice that \\(I\\) does not list all the possible\ninterferences which prevent the occurrence of \\(B\\) in ‘cp,\nall \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s’, but only those factors that are\nrelevant (for a discipline). One can understand Lange in a\nway that he provides two\n strategies[12]\n to determine the members of \\(I\\): (A) the strategy of\nnon-negligibility and (B) the strategy of intended interest of a\nscience. Both strategies try to explicate a methodology that is\nimplicitly used by scientists in a particular discipline (cf. Lange\n2000, 170–174). \n(A) The strategy of non-negligibility: Instead of providing a\ncomplete list of all interfering factors, scientists merely refer to\nthose interfering factors “that arise sufficiently often, and\ncan cause sufficiently great deviations from \\(G\\)-hood, that a\npolicy of inferring \\(F\\)s to be \\(G\\) […] would not be\ngood enough for the relevant purposes” (Lange 2002, 411; Lange\n2000, 170f). For instance, consider the economic law “cp, if the\nsupply of a commodity increases then the price decreases”.\nAccording to Lange, it may happen that the increase in supply is so\nsmall that no decrease in price results. But it might as well happen\nthat the price does not decrease although the supply increases\nsignificantly, because a gigantic comet hitting the planet Earth and\ndestroying all life on its surface disturbs the instantiation of this\nlaw. The comet causes sufficiently great deviation from a decrease in\nthe price of a good. Nevertheless, comets are negligible for the\npurposes of economists because their occurrence does not arise\nsufficiently often to count as interfering factor that is to be\nexplicitly listed in the cp-conditions. \n(B) The strategy of intended interest of a science: A law may\nstill count as stable if it fails to hold under those counterfactual\nsuppositions that do not fall into the range of the laws intended\npurpose and application. This point is best illustrated by an example\nfrom island biogeography—the area law—provided by\nLange: \nThere are counterfactual suppositions for which the area law is not\ntrue. For example, imagine an island where the animals of the species\n“chicken” exclusively live on chicken farms. Suppose\nfurther that on these farms chicken are bred and held under extremely\ncrowded conditions. So, the counterfactual supposition stemming from\nthis example is “chicken on the island in question are bred\nunder extremely crowded, artificial conditions set up by\nfarmers”. Obviously, the area law will drastically fail to hold\nfor this case. Moreover, cases of this kind are not far-fetched\nphilosophical thought experiments: they do not occur\nrarely in times of cultivated breeding of animals (as\nrequired by the strategy of non-negligibility). Nevertheless,\nscientists exclude this kind of exceptions because it conflicts with\nthe intended purpose and application of their discipline (in this\ncase: island biogeography) (cf. Lange 2002, 417; Lange 2000, 232f. for\nfurther\n examples[14]). \nIt is illuminating to contrast Lange’s strategies of determining\na set of disturbing influences \\(I\\) (in the light of intended\napplications of a law) with the use of cp-clauses that does indeed\nrender a statement trivial. Lange illustrates this point by an example\nof a mere “excuse clause”: \nAccording to Lange, excuse clauses of this kind differ from cp-clauses\nas used in the sciences, because the latter refer to strategies of\ndetermining disturbing factors. Although the relevant set of\ndisturbing factors is not listed explicitly, it is implicit in the\nscientific practice (and the education and studies) in a particular\nfield of inquiry. \nBased on his stability theory of laws, Lange also proposes an argument\nfor the autonomy and irreducibility of special science laws. Recall\nthat arguing for the autonomy and irreducibility of the special\nsciences with respect to physics was one of the crucial motivations to\nstart the debate on cp-laws (see section 2.2). Suppose that the laws\nof a certain special science \\(D\\) are stable with respect to the\npurposes of \\(D\\). This pragmatic restriction is unique to\n\\(D\\). In other words, \\(D\\)’s laws are stable for\ncounterfactual suppositions that violate other disciplines’\nlaws, for example the laws of fundamental physics. For instance, Lange\n(2002, 420) claims that ‘the area law would still have held had\nthere been birds equipped with organs weakening gravity’s pull\nsomewhat’. Having organs that weaken gravity’s pull is\nunderstood as a violation of the law of gravitation. Thus,\n\\(D\\)’s laws are stable under some counterfactual supposition\nfor which fundamental physics is unstable. This unique range of\nstability makes \\(D\\) epistemically autonomous as a scientific\ndiscipline because \\(D\\)’s laws can figure, for instance, in\nexplanations answering some why-questions that no other discipline can\nanswer as adequately as \\(D\\) itself (cf. Lange 2000, chapter 8;\nLange 2002, 420f.; also Reutlinger & Koch 2008). \nSimilar to Lange’s stability theory, the invariance approach\n(most prominently advocated in EG1, EG2;\nWoodward 2000, 2002, 2003) also identifies the stability or invariance\nof a generalization as its key feature for performing the role of a\nlaw and figuring in explanations and predictions. As in Lange’s\ntheory, to be invariant means for Woodward and Hitchcock to be true\nunder several (not necessarily all) counterfactual suppositions.\nDespite this basic agreement there are important respects in which the\ninvariance theory differs from Lange’s stability theory. In what\nfollows we focus on the distinguishing features of the invariance\napproach: \nCounterfactual Suppositions Viewed\nDifferently—Interventions: Invariance theories characterize\nthe counterfactually supposed antecedent conditions under which a\ngeneralization remains stable differently than Lange’s stability\ntheory. Lange simply assumes these conditions, e.g., the temperature\nof the gas is 32ºC, to be the result of counterfactual\nsuppositions. We suppose that \\(p\\) is true and see whether the law\n\\(l\\) remains true supposing \\(p\\). So, stability theory is\nindifferent concerning how the supposed state of affairs comes about.\nInvariance theory is more restrictive in characterizing the\ncounterfactual situations: A counterfactual situation refers to a\nchange in the value of a variable. For an invariance\ntheorist, it is important to explain how the change of a\nvariable is brought about: the change of the value of a variable must\nbe the causal outcome of an intervention. An intervention\nconsists in a local change that sets a variable \\(X\\) to a\ncertain value and at the same time decouples \\(X\\) from all\n\\(X\\)-independent variables, as explained in section 3. So, an\nintervention on \\(X\\) is a direct, exogenous causal influence on\nsome variable \\(X\\) which (1) does only act on \\(X\\) itself\nwhile (2) other variables \\((Z)\\) are only changed in virtue of\nbeing directly or indirectly caused by the change in \\(X\\). Notice\nthat interventions need not be carried out by human beings. Instead\nthey are conceived as hypothetical (not necessarily human) causes.\n(cf. Woodward 2003, 98; and Woodward 2003, 103f., 123–127 for\narguments against an anthropomorphic interpretation of interventions.)\n \nDifferent kinds of Variables: Invariance theories distinguish\ntwo kinds of variables: (1) Explicit variables, that figure explicitly\nin a generalization and (2) background variables, that describe\nbackground conditions which are not mentioned in the generalization in\nquestion. Consequently, interventions can be carried out with respect\nto both kinds of\n variables.[15] \nSimilar to Lange’s theory, Woodward and Hitchcock use the\nintended purposes of inquiry of a certain discipline to distinguish\nbetween interventions into explicit variables and background variables\n(cf., e.g., Woodward 2003, 262f). According to their invariance\ntheory, only the former are of importance to laws in a specific\nscientific discipline. Woodward uses an example from economics to\nillustrate the point: \nObviously, the reason to ignore rare but possible changes in the\nbackground variables is very similar to Lange’s strategy of\nnon-negligibility. Woodward contrasts these negligible changes of\nbackground variables with important changes of explicit variables: \nConditions of Invariance: Invariance theories differ\ndrastically from Lange’s approach in defining their key notion,\ni.e., stability or invariance. According to Woodward and Hitchcock\n(EG1, 17) and Woodward (2003, 250): \nThe most intuitive case of a testing intervention might be the\nfollowing one: \\(X=x_1\\) describes an actual state\nof affairs while \\(X=x_2\\) describes a possible\ncounterfactual state of affairs. For instance, suppose that\nBoyle’s gas law —\\(p \\cdot V = N \\cdot k cdot T\\)—is true for the actual\ntemperature of a gas \\(g\\) of 30°C. According to the testing\nintervention condition, Boyle’s gas law is stable if it also\nholds for (counterfactual) temperature of, say, 40°C. One might\ncall this kind of invariance “minimal” invariance.\nContrary to Lange’s theory, minimal invariance is necessary and\nsufficient for the statement to count as invariant. Notice, however,\nthat invariance under variations of background variables is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for being minimally invariant (cf. Woodward\n2003, 248; EG1, 7f.). \nAccording to Woodward & Hitchcock, laws or generalizations in the\nspecial sciences do not hold under all interventions. They merely hold\nfor a certain range of possible values (of those variable figuring in\nthe law statement). By being non-strict the generalizations in the\nspecial sciences do not satisfy a condition that is traditionally\nassociated with laws of nature, namely the condition of universality.\nNonetheless, being invariant for a limited range of values is enough\nfor a proposition to play a lawlike role in the sciences, as is argued in EG2. Woodward and Hitchcock (EG2,\n184–189) develop further criteria and examples of determining\nthe degree of invariance of a generalization \\(G\\) (e.g., comparing\ntwo generalizations \\(G\\) and \\(G*, G\\) might be more\nexact than \\(G^*\\) with respect to the same range of intended\napplication; or \\(G\\) might be more or less sensitive to variations\nin the background conditions than \\(G^*\\) etc.). \nLet us compare Lange’s stability theory and Woodward &\nHitchcock’s invariance theory with respect to the range of\ncounterfactual suppositions or, alternatively, interventions to which\nthe law is applicable. One can say that Lange’s stability theory\nand Woodward & Hitchcock’s invariance theory start from\nopposed extremes of the spectrum of stability: (1) Lange starts at the\nmaximum of stability, i.e., he starts with the claim that a\nlaw-proposition \\(l\\) remains true for all counterfactual\nsuppositions that are consistent with \\(l\\), where by definition a\ncounterfactual supposition is admissible if it is consistent with the\nlaws of nature. In a second step, Lange reduces the set of all\ncounterfactual suppositions consistent with \\(l\\) because of\ncertain pragmatic goals of the discipline which uses the proposition\n\\(l\\). (2) Woodward and Hitchcock start with minimal stability,\ni.e., the satisfaction of the testing intervention condition for some\nproposition \\(l\\). In a second step, Woodward and Hitchcock add to\nminimal stability that \\(l\\)’s degree of invariance increases\nwith the number of possible interventions for which \\(l\\) holds\n(among other criteria). \nAnalogously, Lange argues for a principled distinction between laws\nand accidents within the framework of his stability theory (section\n6.1). However, Lange’s strategy to distinguish laws from\naccidents seems to be partly motivated by the intuition that\nminimal invariance in Woodward & Hitchcock’s sense\nis too weak to account for real life stability displayed by\nscientific generalizations. Correspondingly, Lange (2009b:\n297–302) argues that Woodward & Hitchcock’s account\nfails to distinguish laws from mere accidents and therefore also fails\nto account for the laws’ characteristic explanatory power.  \nJohn Stuart Mill objected to the claim that laws might have\nexceptions. The problem of exceptions disappears if laws are taken to\nrefer to tendencies. \nThis idea was taken up by Cartwright and others. Cartwright’s\ndiscussion of cp-laws focused on the question why cp-laws are of\ninterest in non-ideal situations. If what cp-laws say is confined to\nspecial, namely ideal, circumstances it seems prima facie\nthat these laws are irrelevant for all other, non-ideal, situations.\nThat, however, is not the case in scientific practice. Cp-laws are\nused to explain phenomena outside the ideal circumstances. Cartwright\nargues that this practice requires the postulation of capacities or\ntendencies: \nSubsequently, her suggestion has been taken up by several authors that\nattempt to provide a semantics for cp-laws or even of laws in general\nin terms of dispositions (cf. Hüttemann 1998, 2007; Lipton 1999;\nDrewery 2001; and Bird 2005, 2007, chapter 3). \nThe prima facie advantage of a dispositional account of laws\nvis-á-vis the cp-law-problem is the following: The\ndispositional account provides a semantics for cp-laws.\nAccording to one version of the dispositionalist account of cp-laws\n(see Hüttemann 2014), a law statement is true provided the type\nof system in question has the disposition that the law statement\nattributes to the system. Reconstructing law-statements as statements\nabout dispositions, tendencies, or capacities rather than about overt\nbehavior turns cp-laws into strict laws. The claim is—as in\nMill—that certain kinds of systems have certain kinds of\ntendencies or dispositions. In stating the law, it is no longer\nnecessary to appeal to cp-clauses. One advantage is that the so-called\nproblem of instantiation, “the problem that many cp-laws appear\nnot to have any instances” (Lipton 1999, 164) can be solved. The\nlaw is no longer considered to be a description of the systems’\noccurrent behavior that is only manifest under very special\nconditions—if at all. The law concerns the underlying stable\ntendencies or dispositions. Furthermore, this dispositionalist account\nis able to provide a rationale for why scientists are interested in\ncp-laws. Cp-laws describe how systems behave in the absence of\ndisturbing factors, i.e., if the disposition, tendency etc. can\nmanifest itself completely. This knowledge can be used to account for\nmore complex situations, in which various systems and their\ndispositions are intertwined—provided laws of superposition are\navailable. \nThere is a different version of dispositionalism about cp-laws\naccording to which they are not turned into strict laws (see Bird\n2007: section 3.3). In a nutshell, Bird’s general idea is that the\n“laws are those regularities whose truth is guaranteed by the\nessentially dispositional nature of one or more of the constituent\nproperties” (Bird 2007: 46–47). According to Bird, fundamental\nessentially dispositional properties or potencies give rise to strict\nlaws, since there are no (or only very few) finks or\nantidotes that would prevent the manifestation of the potency\nfrom occurring if the stimulus had occurred (see Bird 2007 chapters\n3.3.2 and 3.3.3, and the SEP-entry on dispositions for details on\ninterferes such finks and antidotes). However, the\nmanifestation process of non-fundamental dispositional properties can\nbe interfered with and so the manifestation only occurs ceteris\nparibus, i.e., in conditions where the trigger occurs and\nfinks and antidotes are absent (see Bird 2007:\nchapter 3.3.1). Therefore, these non-fundamental properties give rise\nto ceteris paribus laws only.  \nWe want to focus on two kinds of concerns that have been raised with\nrespect to dispositionalist accounts: \nDispositions, powers, potencies or tendencies may be present without\nbeing manifest (cf. Earman and Roberts 1999, 451f.): \nAs a rejoinder, dispositionalists can point to laws of composition. As\na consequence, it is not the disposition on its own that can explain\nthe actual pattern in such cases but rather the dispositions plus the\nlaw of composition. For example, Newton’s second law with (i)\nthe gravitational force and (ii) the Coulomb-force describe two\ndispositions that explain the actual behavior of a particle relying on\nthe law for the superposition of forces. The law for the superposition\nof forces describes how the two forces contribute to the actual\nbehavior. (Note that the dispositions the laws of nature attribute to\nsystems need not in general be taken to be macroscopic dispositions\nlike fragility or solubility.) To the extent that such laws are\navailable (as for example for physical forces) the contribution of the\nvarious tendencies or dispositions can be determined even if they fail\nto be (completely) manifest. It can, however, be disputed whether such\nlaws of superposition/composition are available in general, especially\nif one holds like Bird (2007) that every law needs to be grounded in\npotencies. But even if composition laws are taken to be underpinned by\ndispositions, a further law seems to be needed that tells us what\nhappens if the disposition for the law of composition fails to be\nmanifest. We need a meta-law that tells what the law of composition\ncontributes to the actual behavior. So, the assumption that laws of\ncomposition are grounded in dispositions attributed to physical\nsystems threatens to lead to an infinite regress. \nA second problem concerns the question whether a dispositional account\ncan indeed avoid the dilemma for exclusive cp-laws (see section 4).\nEven though it is true, at least on one version, that the laws no\nlonger appeal explicitly to cp-clauses, the\ntriviality-or-falsity-dilemma turns up at a different place (see\nLipton 1999, section 5: Hume’s revenge). The dispositionalist\nstill has to specify the stimulus or triggering conditions for the\ndisposition in order to give the disposition’s ascription a\ndeterminate content. The conditions under which the disposition will\nmanifest itself are exactly those that are required to explicate the\ncp-clause (see Lipton 1999, section 5; for an extensive discussion of\nthis problem cf. also Schrenk 2007b). So, explicating the triggering\nconditions of a disposition requires that something informative is\nsaid about the cp-clauses, and more generally, leads us back to the\nproblems discussed in the previous sections (see Hüttemann 2014\nfor a recent defense of the dispositionalist approach to cp-laws; Ward\n2009 provides a critical discussion).  \nThe reconstructions of exclusive cp-laws in terms of strict\ncompletions do not imply anything about the probability with\nwhich undisturbed antecedent-events will produce the consequent (cf.\nPietroski and Rey 1995, p. 84; Schiffer 1991, p. 8). According to\nproponents of normality theories this seems to be counterintuitive,\nbecause cp-laws should be asserted only if the situation without\n(non-negligible) disturbing factors is a normal or at least a\nrather probable situation. Examples of correct exclusive cp-laws which\nviolate this normality condition are, for example: “exclusively\ncp, no tire blows out”, “exclusively cp, there are no\nclouds in the sky”, etc. Several authors have therefore\ndeveloped so-called normality accounts of cp-laws, including\nSilverberg (1996), Earman and Roberts (1999, 463), Spohn (2002), Spohn\n(2012, chapter 13), and Schurz (2001b, 2002), who argues that the\nnormality interpretation is the preferred interpretation of exclusive\ncp-laws in the life sciences, from biology upwards to the\nsocial sciences. \nNormality theories can be understood as an alternative to the\n(definite and/or indefinite) exclusive interpretation of non-strict\nlaws. The general idea of normality theories is that “cp, all\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” means that normally \\(A\\)s\nare \\(B\\)s. They can also be combined with a comparative\ninterpretation into normic-comparative law-statements such as\n“normally an increase of \\(X\\) leads to an increase of\n\\(Y\\) when other \\(X\\)-independent variables are held\nconstant”. However, the normality accounts differ in their\nexplication of the notion of “normally”. One possibility\n(suggested by Schurz 2001b, 2002, see section 8.1) is to explicate the\nnormality condition in terms of a high probability of the consequent\npredicate, given the antecedent predicate, where the underlying\nconditional probabilities are objective statistical probabilities\nbased on the dispositions of evolutionary systems. Another possibility\n(suggested by Spohn 2012, see section 8.2) is to explicate the\nnormality conditions in terms of degrees of belief and ranking\nfunctions over possible worlds. \nLargely independently of Schurz’s and Spohn’s specific\napproaches but in agreement with the general idea of the normality\napproach, Hüttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko (2014),\nReutlinger (2014), Roberts (2014) and Strevens (2014) have recently\nexplored a statistical approach to cp-laws, according to which cp-law\nstatements are statistical claims. \nSchurz (2001b; 2002, §5) analyses cp-laws in non-physical\nsciences as normic laws of the form “\\(A\\)s are\nnormally \\(B\\)s”. Here are some examples (4* and 6* are the\nnormic reconstructions of 4 and 6 above): \nAccording to the statistical consequence thesis, normic laws\nimply numerically unspecified statistical generalizations of the form\n“Most \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s”, by which they can be\nempirically tested. The statistical consequence thesis has been\nchallenged by cognitive scientists (e.g., McCarthy 1986) and by\nphilosophers of biology (e.g., Millikan 1984). Schurz (2001b) defends\nthe statistical consequence thesis by the following argument which is\nbased on the generalized theory of evolution that does not only apply\nto biological evolution but also to cultural evolution (cf. Mesoudi\net al. 2006 for an excellent overview on generalized\nevolution theory; see Strößner 2015 for a recent\ndiscussion). \nThe common domain of the life sciences (which, according to Schurz,\ninclude biology, psychology as well as the social sciences and the\nhumanities) are evolutionary systems or their products. Evolutionary\nsystems are systems whose self-regulatory properties have been\ngradually selected according to their contribution to reproductive\nsuccess. The temporal persistence of self-regulatory systems is\ngoverned by a certain range of prototypical norm states, in\nwhich these systems constantly have to be in order to stay alive. They\nmanage this with the help of regulatory mechanisms which\ncompensate for disturbing influences of the environment.\nAlthough the self-regulatory capacities of evolutionary systems are\nthe product of a long adaptation history, they are not perfect.\nDysfunctions may occur, whence their normic behavior may have various\nexceptions. Yet, it must be the case that these systems are\nin their prototypical norm states in the high statistical\nmajority of cases and times, since otherwise, they would not have\nsurvived in evolution. \nIn this way, the evolution-theoretic foundation of normic laws does\nnot only explain why normic laws are the typical form of the laws of\nlife sciences. It also explains why normic laws are not strict but\nnevertheless are associated with high conditional statistical\nprobabilities, at least for most cases and times in evolution. \nAccording to Schurz (2002), the difference between idealization\nconditions in physics and normality conditions in evolutionary\nsciences can be explained as follows: In physics, one traditionally\nthinks of complexity as a source of\ndisorder—regularities are obtained by abstracting\naway from complexities. In evolutionary systems, by contrast,\ncomplexity is usually a source of\norder—complexity which has been selected by\nevolution to stabilize normic behavior. As Wachbroit (1994, 587f.)\nputs it, ideal planets are theoretical abstractions: mass points under\nthe influence of a centripetal force and ‘nothing else’.\nThey do not literally exist. In contrast, normal birds really\ndo exist because they are what has been selected through\nevolution. When speaking of a normal bird, we do not abstract from its\nadmirable complexity, but we rely on it as the cause of its\nnormal behavior. This does not mean that abstract laws of physics\n(e.g., the laws of aerodynamics) play no role in the explanation of\nfunctional behaviors of evolutionary systems (e.g., that birds can\nfly). However, even when we explain a bird’s flying ability in\nterms of the laws of aerodynamics, we still have to assume a\n‘normal’ bird which possesses the typical capabilities of\nbirds that have been selected through evolution. The idealization\nprocedures needed for planets would not make good sense for birds:\nthere are no disturbing parameters which, when going to zero, turn a\nreal bird into an ideal bird which can necessarily fly and which is\napproximated by the real bird. \nAnother way to understand “ceteris paribus” as\nreferring to normal conditions is introduced by Wolfgang Spohn (1997,\nsection 5; 2002, section 4; 2012, chapter 13.2; 2014). Spohn takes the\nconnection between ceteris paribus qualifications and\nnormality to be straightforward: “ceteris\nparibus” means other things being normal. Let us\ncall this the Normal Condition Approach. The basic idea of\nthe Normal Conditions Approach is that a cp-law \\(L\\) holds when\nnormal conditions obtain. Spohn characterizes normal conditions as\n“exactly those conditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain\n[…] in the small space-time region inhabited by us”\n(Spohn 1997, 278). Translated in probabilistic terms, the expression\n“conditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain” means\nthat the occurrence of some conditions is highly\nprobable. \nFor Spohn, a condition is “normal” if it is (i) expected\nor (ii) at least not ruled out to obtain by a rational, epistemic\nagent (for formal definitions of normal and exceptional conditions cf.\nSpohn 2002, section 4, and Spohn 2012, chapter 13.4). He illustrates\nhis Normal Conditions Approach with Hooke’s Law: \nSpohn concludes that Hooke’s law holds under normal conditions\nand draws an analogy to other law statements in the special\nsciences: \nSpohn’s Normal Conditions approach differs from Schurz’s\nNormic Laws approach in at least two respects. \nAccording to Spohn (and contrary to Schurz’s theory which refers\nto objective probabilities), the fact that normal conditions obtain is\nconceived epistemically and, more specifically, doxastically. An\nepistemic agent forms beliefs about the normality of conditions, i.e.,\nsomeone strongly believes that some condition obtains (cf. Spohn 2002,\n385). \nSpohn describes “the epistemic functioning” of beliefs\n(doxastic states) about normality by modeling degrees of belief in\nterms of ranking functions (originally developed in Spohn 1988 under\nthe label “ordinal conditional functions”; cf. also Spohn\n2012 and the SEP-entry ‘Formal Representations of Belief’,\nsection 3.3) \nNormality in Spohn’s theory is explicated in terms of background\nconditions, not in terms of probabilistic relations between the\nantecedent predicate and the consequent predicate. If someone believes\nthat the law \\(f(X)=Y\\) holds, then she believes that\nthis functional relation holds under normal conditions \\(N\\), which\nmeans in terms of Spohn’s ranking functions that the law\n\\(f(X)=Y\\) is believed with rank zero, i.e., it is\ntrue in all normal worlds of a ranked world model. Such a ranked world\nmodel consists of a set of possible worlds together with a ranking\nfunction which attaches to each world a natural number \\(0, 1, \\ldots ,n\\) specifying its rank. Worlds with rank 0 are the most normal\nworlds, worlds with rank 1 contain exceptions from normal conditions\n(1st degree exceptions), worlds with rank 2 exceptions from those\nexceptions (2nd degree exceptions), etc. \nSpohn (2014) is the most recent and in-depth elaboration of his normal\nconditions based “epistemic account” of ceteris\nparibus laws and conditions.  \nSince the normal conditions “\\(N\\)” express the\nproposition that the given situation or world is normal, it would seem\nthat the ranking-of-worlds account entails the possibility of a strict\ncompletion by adding the normality condition \\(N\\) to the\nantecedent: “if \\(N\\), then \\(Y = f(X)\\)”. Indeed, it follows from the truth condition\nfor the assertion “normally (or cp) \\(L\\)” in a ranked\nworld model (where \\(L\\) is e.g., \\(Y = f(X))\\)\nthat there exists a proposition \\(N\\)—namely the set of all\nworlds with rank 0—such that “normally \\(L\\)” is\ntrue in the given ranked model iff the material implication\n\\(N\\rightarrow L\\) is true in all worlds of this model. This does\nneither imply, however, that (a) the completing proposition \\(N\\)\ncan be linguistically expressed, nor (b) that it can be expressed in a\nnon-trivial way, in the sense that \\(N\\) does not already imply\n\\(L\\) on logical reasons alone. Since one can only speak of a\nstrict completion of “normally \\(L\\)” if (a) and (b)\nhold, it follows that the ranking-of-worlds account does in fact not\nentail the possibility of a strict completion. This result is\nadequate, because as we have argued above, in most cases (especially\nin all non-deterministic situations) a strict completion is\nimpossible. Thus, it has to be kept in mind that speaking of\n“normality conditions” does not imply that these\n“normality conditions” can be expressed by any\n(non-trivial) proposition. For example, there is not any non-trivial\nproposition \\(N\\) which could turn the conditional “normally\na Cs\\(^{137}\\) atom decays after 60 years” into a strict\nimplication of the form “if \\(N\\), then a Cs\\(^{137}\\)\natom decays after 60 years”. Also note that the ranked-worlds\naccounts and the conditional probability accounts are equivalent as a\nsemantics for logical axiomatizations of conditional reasoning (see\nsection 8.3). \nReasoning from exclusive or normic cp-laws has an important logical\nfeature: the inferences are in contrast to deductively valid arguments\nnot monotonic. An inference is monotonic iff adding arbitrary\nnew premises to a valid argument preserves its validity. But the\ninference from an exclusive cp-law of the form “exclusively cp,\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” and a singular statement\n\\(A(d)\\) (for “\\(d\\) is an \\(A\\)”) to a\nconclusion \\(B(d)\\) is no longer correct if \\(d\\) is\nknown to instantiate a disturbing factor \\(D\\) which blocks the\nnomic connection between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For instance, the\nexclusive cp-law may state that if something is a bird (\\(A\\)), then it\nnormally can fly (\\(B\\)), and \\(D\\) may assert that the given\nbird-instance has broken wings. \nAssume the exclusive cp-law is formulated with the help of a\nnon-strict conditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\). Drawing correct\ninferences from non-strict conditionals requires non-classical rules\nof valid inferences: The non-monotonicity of Default Modus\nPonens means formally that although the inference from\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and \\(A(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is\ncorrect (i.e., \\(A\\rightarrow B, A(d) \\dproves B(d)\\) holds, where ‘\\(\\dproves\\)’ stands for\n‘non-monotonically correct inference’), the inference from\nthe extended premise set \\(A\\rightarrow B,\nH\\rightarrow \\neg B, A(d)\\), and\n\\(H(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is incorrect (i.e.,\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\), A\\((d), H(d) \\dproves B(d))\\). These non-monotonic effects are reflected in\nnon-classical rules for inferences from conditionals to conditionals.\nFor example, take the inference from “If \\(A\\), then\n\\(B\\)” to “If \\(A\\wedge D\\), then\n\\(B\\)” (monotonicity \\(M)\\) or from “If \\(A\\),\nthen \\(B\\)” and “If \\(B\\), then \\(D\\)” to\n“If \\(A\\), then \\(D\\)” (Cut \\(C)\\). Both\ninferences are valid for strict (logical or material) conditionals,\nbut they are not generally correct for non-strict conditionals. Only\nthe more cautious inferences from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\wedge D\\rightarrow B\\)\n(cautious monotonicity CM) or from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\wedge B\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\rightarrow D\\)\n(Cautious Cut CC) are correct for non-strict conditionals. \nTwo prominent semantic criteria for the truth of a non-strict\nconditional and the correctness of inference from non-strict\nconditionals have been suggested in the literature. \nRemarkably, both semantics lead to the same conditional logics. Both\nsemantics possess the system \\(P\\) (“preferential\nentailment”) as a correct and complete axiomatization of\ninferences among pure conditionals, and the system \\(R\\)\n(“rational entailment”) for inferences among\ntruth-function combinations of conditionals (for more details cf.\nKraus et al. 1990, Hawthorne 1996, Adams 1975, Schurz 1998,\n2004, 2005, Leitgeb 2004, and the SEP-entry on non-monotonic\nlogic). \nThe use of “cp” is not restricted to philosophy of\nscience. It is used in other areas of theoretical and practical\nphilosophy as well. \nFor instance, prima facie reasons are reasons under the\nconstraint of exclusive cp-conditions. They play an important role in\nethics and epistemology. \nIn ethics, a prima facie norm is an obligation (e.g.,\n“prima facie, you should not hurt anybody”) which\nholds as long as exceptional circumstances (e.g., defending your own\nlife) are absent (cf. Ross 1930 and the SEP-entry on moral reasoning).\nDancy (2004, 17, 35f) uses the expression “pro\ntanto” instead of “prima facie”, which\nis standardly used in the current debate. Pietroski (1993) has\npromoted the ceteris paribus understanding of moral\nobligations as a solution to paradoxes of moral obligations.\nEspecially for the solution of moral dilemmas, the cp-reading of moral\nobligations has proven to be helpful, because although two conflicting\ncp-obligations may block each other, they do not produce a strict\nconsistency in the sense of deductive logic (see Horty 1994). \nIn epistemology, a prima facie reason for a belief is a\nreason which justifies this belief in the absence of defeaters, i.e.,\nof exceptional information to the contrary. Prima facie\nreasons have been suggested in epistemology as a means of providing\nweak and defeasible a priori justifications for\nepistemologically fundamental beliefs such as the belief in the\nexistence of an external reality, for which a strict and non-circular\na priori-justification seems to be impossible. Nevertheless,\nthe inference from visual appearances to reality counts as defeasibly\njustified as long as there do not exist serious defeaters, i.e.,\nreasons for serious doubt (cf. Williams 1996, 2001, and the SEP-entry\non a priori-justification and knowledge). An example is the\ndefeasible inference from visual appearances to beliefs concerning\nexternal reality. My awareness of my visual appearance of a tree in\nfront of me is a prima facie reason for my belief that there\nreally is a tree in front of me, provided that information about\nexceptional circumstances is absent, for example the information that\nI am under the influence of drugs which cause hallucinations (cf.\nPollock 1986, Moser 2002). One may object that a similar kind of\npossible exception to the inference from visual appearances to reality\nis constituted by the possibility of a Cartesian demon who infuses\nhumans with illusionary perceptions, which is one of the major\nskeptical counterarguments to the inference from appearances to\nreality. In response to this objection, several epistemologists have\nargued that these kinds of exceptions are not serious exceptions, and\ntherefore, the inference from appearances to reality is defeasibly\nvalid. \nFinally, applications of cp-clauses can also be found in the form of\npresumptions in philosophy of language. Here it is assumed that\nunderstanding linguistic expressions requires defeasible assumptions\nor “presumptions”, for example presumptions concerning the\nrationality of the speaker (cf. Quine 1960; Davidson 1973, Scholz\n2016, 148–159). \nIn the current literature, a number of novel trends and innovative\napproaches to cp-laws have emerged that cannot easily be subsumed\nunder the already existing accounts. For this reason they deserve\nspecial mention. We believe there are at least four clearly\ndiscernable novel tendencies in the current work on cp-laws: \nA reconnection to metaphysics: One of the most salient trends\nin the current literature is that the discussion of cp-laws\n(re)connects philosophy of science to analytic metaphysics in at least\nthree respects: (i) current accounts of cp-laws make use of David\nLewis’s (1973) best system account of laws; moreover, (ii) the\ninterpretation of objective probabilities and (iii) the metaphysics of\ndispositions are brought into play for making progress in\nunderstanding cp-law statements.  \nThe most vivid sign of this reconnection consists in the fact that\nseveral authors have recently defended a friendly amendment of David\nLewis’s best system account of laws of nature. While\nLewis’s (1973, 73) original version primarily focuses on\nfundamental laws, the amended versions are intended to capture also\nnon-fundamental laws of the special sciences. Schrenk (2007a, 2014),\nCallender and Cohen (2009, 2010), and Frisch (2014a) defend a\nso-called “better best system” account of special science\nlaws. Unterhuber (2014) develops a version of the “better best\nsystem” account utilizing generics. Jaag and Loew (forthcoming)\nargue for a pragmatic version of the best systems account that\ncaptures also central insights of the “better best system”\ntheory. On their view, the universality of laws is not an end in\nitself. If a generalization’s invariance is, e.g., limited to\nour cosmic epoch only, this limited invariance arguably would be\nenough to make it useful for us and thus a law according to this\naccount. Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and Reutlinger (2014) provide\na critical discussion of “better best system” accounts.\nBraddon-Mitchell (2001) and Wheeler (2018) present versions of a best\nsystems account deploying the idea of algorithmic compression from\ndata science. Albert (2000, 2015) and Loewer (2009) advocate a\n“statistical mechanical” version of the best systems\napproach to special science laws which is, unlike the “better\nbest system” account, committed to a particular\nBoltzmann-inspired interpretation of statistical mechanics (including\nassumptions about the early history of the universe). Weslake (2014)\nand Frisch (2014b) provide critical responses, while Fenton-Glynn\n(2016) constructively uses examples by Albert and Loewer for an\nanalysis of cp-laws. Finally, Albert and Loewer’s account also\nconnects the debate on cp-laws with the on-going discussion on whether\ncausation has a place in fundamental physics or whether causation is\nan ‘emergent’ phenomenon captured by the cp-law statements\nof the special sciences (Price and Corry 2007 and Frisch 2014b are\nrepresentative of the opposing views in the debate on causation in\nphysics). \nAlso other metaphysical issues besides Lewis’s account of\nlawhood influence the recent literature on cp-laws. The metaphysics of\nprobabilities and disposition stand out in this respect. Taking up\nresults from Earman and Roberts (1999) and Schurz (2002), several\nauthors including Hüttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko\n(2014), Roberts (2014), Reutlinger (2014), and Strevens (2014) discuss\nthe prospects of a statistical approach to cp-laws (or a\n“softness” approach, to use Strevens’s term),\naccording to which cp-laws are statistical claims. (Notice that the\nnormality account presented in section 8 above is but a special case\nof the broader statistical approach to cp-laws). \nA third metaphysical trend concerns the metaphysics of dispositions:\nAs we have explained in section 7 above, Hüttemann (2014) and\nPemberton and Cartwright (2014) argue in favor of a dispositionalist\naccount of cp-laws and provide responses to standard objections to the\ndispositionalist view (for instance, to objections voiced by Earman\nand Roberts 1999). \nDrawing on linguistics and philosophy of language: Several\nrecent approaches to cp-laws explicitly draw on research in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language. Taking into account linguistic\nwork on generics, Nickel (2010, 2014) argues that our understanding of\ncp-law statements is improved if one takes them to be generics and\nuses the formal semantics for generics to shed light on the meaning of\ncp-law statements (for approaches to cp-laws deploying generics, see\nalso Unterhuber and Schurz 2013; Unterhuber 2014; and Claveau und\nGirard 2019). Roberts (2014) makes contact with philosophy of language\nin analyzing cp-laws as vague and indexical statements about\nfrequencies. Ward (2007), Karbasizadeh (2008) and Nickel (2014)\nexplore the link between cp-laws and different accounts of natural\nkind terms. \nSensitivity to the sciences: Several philosophers have made\nan effort to draw attention to the fact that an adequate discussion of\nlaws has to be sensitive to the differences between distinct\nscientific disciplines. Their motivation is to provide a theory of\nlaws that fits generalizations (and models) in the life sciences, the\nsocial sciences and, more generally, the sciences of complex systems\n(for instance, see Mitchell 1997, 2002a,b; 2008, 2009; Sober 1997;\nSteel 2007; and Reiss 2008). In particular, Mitchell (2000), Strevens\n(2003, 2008), Craver (2007), Hüttemann (2007), Wimsatt (2007),\nTobin (2005), Woodward (2010) and Reutlinger (2011, 2013) distinguish\nvarious dimensions of characterizing how generalizations in these\nscientific disciplines may be non-universal or allow for exceptions.\nThese dimensions include stability, robustness, specificity, and\nhistorical contingency (see Reutlinger and Unterhuber 2014b for an\noverview). In a similar vein, Schurz (2014) introduces a novel\ndistinction between ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Fenton-Glynn (2016) holds that some higher-level\nlaws about the macro-behavior of complex systems (his central example\nis the second law of thermodynamics) are “minutis\nrectis” laws and should be distinguished from cp-laws,\nbecause their non-universal character stems from a probability\ndistribution over initial micro-conditions (see Strevens 2003 for\nfurther examples). Finally, motivated by examples from population\necology, earth science, and statistical mechanics, Strevens (2008) and\nWeisberg (2013) argue for a new interpretation of laws and models\ninvolving idealized assumptions, the minimalist account of\nidealizations. Strevens (2012, 2014) proposes treating cp-laws and\nidealized laws separately. What seems to emerge from this literature\nis that the ceteris paribus character of generalizations is\nmulti-faceted. There is a number of ways in which a generalization can\nbe non-universal: due to idealizations, by expressing statistical\nregularities and probability distributions over initial conditions, by\ndrawing on the notion of normality, by being sensitive to changes in\ninitial and background conditions, and so on (see Reutlinger and\nUnterhuber 2014b for a more detailed analysis). \nUsing scientific concepts and methods: recent philosophical\nattempts of capturing cp-laws increasingly involve importing key\nconcepts from the sciences and using these concepts for developing a\ngeneral theory of cp-laws. Inspired by classical mechanics, Maudlin\n(2007) and Hüttemann (2014) analyze cp-conditions in terms of\ndefault or inertial behavior. Both authors capture a violation of\ncp-conditions as a deviation from inertial behavior, where deviating\nfrom inertial behavior is itself a process governed by laws of\ndeviation (Maudlin) or laws of interaction and composition\n(Hüttemann). Other philosophers are influenced by the life\nsciences such as Nickel (2014), Pemberton and Cartwright (2014), and\nStrevens (2012, 2014) who rely on the concept of a mechanism in order\nto explicate the content of cp-conditions more generally. Kowalenko\n(2014) argues that cp-laws are best understood by drawing on methods\nfrom statistics, such as multivariate regression analysis (for a\ndiscussion of similar statistical approaches see Hüttemann and\nReutlinger 2013, Reutlinger 2014, Roberts 2014, and Strevens 2014).\nSchurz (2014) uses causal Bayesian networks as a formal framework for\na causal reconstruction of ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Finally, Jhun (2018) argues that focusing on the\nequilibrium methodology used in thermodynamics as well as in economic\nreasoning facilitates a new understanding of the explanatory role of\ncp-laws in terms of efficient performance.  \nWhere are the debates about cp-laws leading? What are the important\nchallenges to be met in future research? There are at least four main\nareas of productive future research: \nThese areas of research are, of course, not a complete list of future\nresearch topics. Nevertheless, it seems to us that these questions are\ninteresting enough to stimulate productive further research on\nceteris paribus laws. \nThe critical article by Earman and Roberts (1999) provides an\nexcellent introduction to the contemporary debate, because it\nreconstructs the most important theories of cp-laws and also points\nout the problems of these approaches. The volumes by Earman et\nal. (2002) and Reutlinger and Unterhuber (2014) contain a\nrepresentative collection of contemporary essays on the problem of\ncp-laws. \nPersky (1990), Blaug (1996) and Kaufer (1997) are accessible surveys\nof the history of cp-clauses and cp-laws. Notice that these articles\nfocus on economics and the social sciences. For a systematic\ndiscussion of laws in the social sciences, the debate between Kincaid\n(2004) and Roberts (2004) on whether there are laws in the social\nsciences is very instructive. \nThe important distinctions between (a) comparative and exclusive and\n(b) indefinite and definite cp-laws are established and argued for in\nSchurz (2002). \nThe dilemma of triviality or falsity is discussed in Lange (1993),\nwhich is also a helpful survey of the debate until 1993. \nConcerning completer accounts, Fodor (1991), Hausman (1992: chapter 8)\nand Pietroski and Rey (1995) are central papers. These accounts are\ncriticized by Earman and Roberts (1999), Schurz (2001a) and Woodward\n(2002). A more recent defense of completer accounts is Strevens\n(2012). \nConcerning stability accounts, Marc Lange develops his version in\nbook-length (see his 2000 and 2009a, although the focus of the latter\nis not on cp-laws). Lange (2002) is a very accessible paper on his\nview of cp-laws. Invariance accounts are best introduced in two joint\npapers by James Woodward and Christopher Hitchcock (see their EG1, EG2) and in Woodward’s book Making Things Happen (2003:\nchapter 6). Hall (2007) provides an insightful discussion of Woodward\n& Hitchcock’s invariance account.  \nFor dispositionalist approaches to cp-laws, Cartwright (1989) is a\nmodern classic (cf. her recent 2002, and Elgin and Sober 2002 for a\ncritique). Smith (2002), Mumford (2004), Bird (2005, 2007) and\nHüttemann (2007, 2014) develop different more recent\ndispositional accounts of cp-laws. \nConcerning normality approaches, Schurz (2001b, 2002) argues for a\nnormic laws approach. Spohn (2002) and Spohn (2012, chapter 13) are\ngood introductions to the normal conditions approach. See also Glymour\n(2002) for a formal approach to cp-laws. \nHumean better best system accounts of cp-laws are presented in Cohen\nand Callender (2009, 2010), Schrenk (2007a, 2014), and Unterhuber\n(2014). Wheeler (2018: chapter 3.2) gives an accessible brief\nexposition of various versions; and Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and\nReutlinger (2014) provide a critical discussion.  \nThere are also various approaches in the current debate that cannot\neasily be classified: Mitchell (1997, 2002a, b; 2008, 2009), Sober\n1997, Steel (2007, chapter 6) and Reiss (2008) attempt to explicate a\ntheory of laws that fits scientific practice in biology, the social\nsciences and generalization describing complex systems. Further,\nMitchell (2000), Craver (2007), Tobin (2005) and Reutlinger (2011)\ndistinguish various dimensions of the non-universality of (cp-)laws in\norder to argue for an explication of laws in the special sciences.\nKarbasizadeh (2008) links the debates on cp-laws and natural kinds.\nLadyman and Ross (2007, chapters 4 and 5), Kincaid (2008), Ross\n(2008), and Ladyman (2008) argue for ontic structural realism as a\nmetaphysics of generalizations in the social sciences (and for the\nspecial sciences in general). Finally, Maudlin (2007, chapter 5)\nadvocates an explication of laws in the special sciences that is based\non the notion of quasi-Newtonian laws.","contact.mail":"ahuettem@uni-koeln.de","contact.domain":"uni-koeln.de"},{"date.published":"2011-03-14","date.changed":"2019-12-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ceteris-paribus/","author1":"Alexander Reutlinger","author2":"Gerhard Schurz","author1.info":"http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/reutlinger/index.html","entry":"ceteris-paribus","body.text":"\n\n\nLaws of nature take center stage in philosophy of science and\nmetaphysics. Laws are usually believed to stand in tight relations to\nmany philosophical key concepts such as causation, explanation,\nconfirmation, determinism, and counterfactuals. Traditionally,\nphilosophers have focused on physical laws, which were taken to be at\nleast true, universal statements that support counterfactual claims.\nBut, although this claim about laws might be true with respect to\nphysics, laws in the special sciences (such as biology, psychology,\nand economics) appear to have—maybe not\nsurprisingly—different features than the laws of physics.\nSpecial science laws—for instance, the economic law “Under\nthe condition of perfect competition, an increase of demand of a\ncommodity leads to an increase of price, given that the quantity of\nthe supplied commodity remains constant” and, in biology,\nMendel’s Laws—are usually taken to “have\nexceptions”, to be “non-universal” or to be\n“ceteris paribus laws”. How and whether the laws\nof physics and the laws of the special sciences differ is one of the\ncrucial questions motivating the debate on ceteris paribus\nlaws. Another major, controversial question concerns the determination\nof the precise meaning of “ceteris paribus”.\nPhilosophers have attempted to explicate the meaning of ceteris\nparibus clauses in different ways. The question of meaning is\nconnected to the problem of empirical content, i.e., the question\nwhether ceteris paribus laws have non-trivial and empirically\ntestable content. Since many philosophers have argued that ceteris\nparibus laws lack empirically testable content, this problem\nconstitutes a major challenge to a theory of ceteris paribus\nlaws.\n\nIn philosophy of science and metaphysics, laws of nature take center\nstage: Many explications of philosophical key concepts in philosophy\nof science essentially rely on laws of nature. For instance, a\nmajority of theories of causation, explanation, confirmation,\ndeterminism, and counterfactuals presuppose laws of nature (see the\nSEP-entry on laws of nature). \nUntil the second half of the 20th century, certain characteristics of\nlaws of nature were taken for granted by philosophers of science: Laws\nof nature were taken to be true, logically contingent, universal\nstatements that support counterfactual claims. Laws were taken to play\na major role in explanation, induction, confirmation, causation, and\nin counterfactual reasoning. The paradigm cases for such laws were\ntaken from (fundamental) physics. Newton’s second law\n\\((F=ma)\\) or the Schrödinger-equation fit the\nbill of the traditional concept of a law of nature. Philosophers of\nscience were aware of the fact that there are hardly any universal\nlaws of this kind in biology, psychology, economics or other special\nsciences. This posed no problem as long as there was a consensus that\nthis might be conceived as a shortcoming of the special sciences.\nHowever, with the success especially of the biological sciences it\nbecame clear that there is genuine scientific knowledge that does not\nconform to the paradigm of physics. As a consequence, scientific\npractice in the special sciences was no longer taken to be deficient\nbut was analyzed as a legitimate practice different from physics. The\ngeneralizations of the special sciences including biology, psychology,\nand economics seem to differ in an important way from the\ngeneralizations of fundamental physics. In order to illustrate this\ndifference, here are some examples of generalizations that play an\nexplanatory role in various special sciences: \nSnell’s Law: “At the interface between dielectric\nmedia, there is (also) a refracted ray in the second medium\nlying in the plane of incidence, making an angle\n\\(\\theta_t\\), with the normal and obeying\nSnell’s law:  \nwhere \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) are the velocities of propagation in the two\nmedia, and \\(n_1 =(c/v_1), n_2 =(c/v_2)\\) are the indices of\nrefraction.” (Miles V. Klein’s Optics, cited from\nCartwright 1983, 46)  \nThe lack of vitamin C causes scurvy.  \nMendel’s Law of Segregation: “In a parent, the\nalleles for each character separate in the production of gametes, so\nthat only one is transmitted to each individual in the next\ngeneration.” (Rosenberg & McShea 2008, 36)  \nThe Area Law in Island-Biogeography: “the equilibrium\nnumber \\(S\\) of a species of a given taxonomic group on an island\n(as far as creatures are concerned) increases [polynomially] with the\nislands area [A]: \\(S = c\\times A^z\\). The (positive-valued)\nconstants \\(c\\) and \\(z\\) are specific to the taxonomic group\nand island group.” (Lange 2000, 235f.; Lange 2002, 416f.)  \nPeople’s actions are goal-oriented, in the sense that if person\n\\(x\\) wants \\(A\\) and believes \\(B\\) to be an optimal means\nfor achieving \\(A\\), then \\(x\\) will attempt to do \\(B\\)\n(Fodor 1987; Dray 1957, 132ff).  \nThe Law of Demand: Under the condition of perfect\ncompetition, an increase of demand of a commodity leads to an increase\nof price, given that the quantity of the supply of the commodity\nremains constant (Roberts 2004, 159; Kincaid 2004, 177).  \nThe lack of social integration results in a higher probability of\nattempted suicides.  \nThese generalizations may be explained in terms of lower level\nsciences, but this is not our focus here. What is important for our\npurposes is that all of these generalizations are non-universal. That\nis, there are (actual and merely possible) situations in which the\nabove generalizations do not hold, although all the\nconditions obtain that are explicitly stated in the antecedents of\nthese generalizations. For instance, there are situations in which the\nfollowing is the case: at the interface between dielectric media,\nthere is a refracted ray in the second medium lying in the plane of\nincidence, making an angle \\(\\theta_t\\), with the normal and this ray\ndoes not obey the equation \\(\\sin \\theta/\\sin \\theta_t = n_2 /n_1\\),\nthe lack of vitamin C does not cause scurvy, the alleles separate\ndifferently than Mendel’s law of Segregation describes, the\nequilibrium number of a species does not increase in accord with the\nArea Law, people fail to act in a goal-oriented fashion, and an\nincrease of demand of a commodity does not lead to an increase of\nprice (even if the condition of perfect competition were\nrealized). \nHowever, even though the generalizations are non-universal they do\nplay a role in explanations and predictions, they may be used for\npurposes of manipulation and they support counterfactuals. \nThe question arises how to deal with this situation. Are these\ngeneralizations to be classified as laws—laws that pertain only\nto special conditions, i.e., ceteris paribus laws—or\nare they something entirely different. Given the fact that laws play a\nmajor role in most accounts of explanation, causation etc., there seem\nto be basically three options: \nThe difference between options (b) and (c) may be to some extent\nmerely terminological. Woodward and Hitchcock, for example, replace\nlaws with ‘invariant generalizations’ (see section 6.2)\nbut admit that their account may be read as a\nreconceptualization of lawhood (see Woodward and Hitchcock\n2003, hereafter EG1, 3). \nThe motivation of those who take option (c) and stick to the concept\nof law is that the generalizations cited above have enough in common\nwith Newton’s first law or the Schrödinger-equation to\nclassify them as laws. For instance, they play the same kind of role\nin explanation, prediction, and they support counterfactuals. There\nare two beneficial consequences of this particular approach. First\n(against option (a)), it need not be denied that there are genuine\nexplanations etc. in the special sciences. Second (against option\n(b)), in analogy to the traditional view, the concept of a law (albeit\nof a non-universal or ceteris paribus law) can be used in\nexplications of notions such as explanation, and causation. \nThe main problem for those who choose option (c) is that they have to\nspell out what is meant by a non-universal law (statement) and how it\ncan perform similar explanatory and predictive tasks as a universal\nlaw. A convenient way to reconstruct the debate about option (c) is to\nunderstand non-universal laws as statements that are qualified by a\nceteris paribus (henceforth, “cp”) clause. Yet,\nhow to understand the meaning of the cp-clause is an open question\nthat is answered differently by various philosophers. \nBefore we discuss various accounts of cp-laws, several issues\nsurrounding the notion of “ceteris paribus”\nshould be distinguished in order to structure the debate: \nHowever, if there are cp-laws further questions arise: \nHaving distinguished these issues, it should be clear that\nthe debate about cp-clauses and cp-laws does not exist.\nInstead, theories of “cp” engage in different and often\nseparable enterprises. \nSection 2 gives, on the one hand, an account of the explicit use of\ncp-clauses (mainly) in the literature on economic issues from\nscholasticism to modern economics (section 2.1.). On the other hand,\nwe sketch two problems in philosophy of science and philosophy of mind\nthat explain why the issue of cp-laws became an intensely discussed\nissue since the 1980s (section 2.2,). \nSection 3 distinguishes different readings of the cp-clause and a\nfortiori different kinds of cp-laws. In section 3.1, exclusive\ncp-laws (factors not mentioned in the antecedent of the law are\nassumed to be absent) are distinguished from comparative\ncp-laws (factors not mentioned in the antecedent of the law are\nassumed to be constant). In line with the bulk of the\nrelevant literature, we focus on exclusive cp-laws. In section 3.2, a\ndistinction between definite and indefinite cp-laws is presented. \nSection 4 presents the main challenge to cp-laws. It appears that many\nlaws, e.g., of the special sciences, if taken as strict laws, turn out\nto be false; however, if they are hedged by a cp-clause they appear to\nlack a clear meaning and appear to be empirically untestable. All of\nthe major accounts of cp-laws discussed in sections 5 to 8 are\nreactions to this challenge. \nSection 5 deals with the most influential early accounts of cp-laws.\nThey take cp-laws to be incomplete laws that can be completed. Whereas\nFodor (1987) and others (see Section 5.1) focus on special science\ncp-laws that can be completed by adding factors to the antecedent of\nthe law that are dealt with in more fundamental sciences, Pietroski\nand Rey (1995) take cp-laws to contain (implicit) promises: that is,\nwhen asserting a cp-law, one promises to be able to cite factors that\ncomplete the law on a case by case basis if the consequent of the\ncp-law does not obtain (although the antecedent does). In section 5.2,\nwe present several objections against such completer accounts. \nSection 6 presents two versions of stability theories of laws in the\nspecial sciences, namely Lange’s (2000, 2002, 2005) stability\ntheory in section 6.1, and Woodward & Hitchcock’s (see EG1 and Hitchcock & Woodward 2003, hereafter EG2)\ninvariance theory in section 6.2. The common general idea of\ninvariance or stability theories of laws is that the laws differ from\nmerely accidental non-laws in virtue of their invariance or stability\nunder counterfactual suppositions. According to this view, ceteris\nparibus or non-universal laws differ from universal laws in\ndegree, not in kind: universal laws hold under all counterfactual\nsuppositions while ceteris paribus or non-universal laws\nmerely hold for a limited range of suppositions. \nSection 7 deals with dispositional accounts of cp-laws. The unifying\nidea is that the laws of nature are grounded in dispositional\nproperties. We distinguish two different dispositional accounts of\ncp-laws: On Hüttemann’s (2014) version, that is based on pioneering\nwork of Mill and Cartwright, law-statements are statements about\ndispositions, tendencies, or capacities rather than about overt\nbehavior, and thus cp-laws are turned into strict laws. Bird’s\n(2007) version of dispositionalism, by contrast, does not turn cp-laws\ninto strict laws. Instead, it identifies cp-laws with generalizations\nhedged by a cp-clause that are grounded in non-fundamental\ndispositional properties that admit of interferers. \nSection 8 deals with normality theories of laws. The guiding idea of\nnormality theories is that “cp, all \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s” means that normally \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s.\nThe various normality accounts differ in their explication of the\nnotion of normality. While Schurz (2001b, 2002) interprets normality\nas a high conditional, objective probability of the consequent of the\nlaw statement given the antecedent (see section 8.1), Spohn (2012)\nsuggests to explicate the normality conditions in terms of degrees of\nbelief and ranking functions over possible worlds (see section\n8.2). \nSection 9 sketches the relevance of cp-laws in other areas of\nphilosophy (such as epistemology and ethics). \nSection 10 is a survey to recent work on cp-laws in metaphysics,\nphilosophy of language and linguistics as well as in other\nsciences. \nSection 11 presents a brief conclusion and an outlook for future\nresearch. \nFinally, section 12 provides a concise overview of the relevant\nliterature.  \nThe Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” or\n“caeteris paribus”—literally meaning\n“other things being equal”— was used in a\nnon-technical sense by\n Cicero.[1]\n However, most of the early uses of the ceteris\nparibus-clause are found in economics. In economic contexts the\nuse of ceteris paribus clauses can be traced back to Petrus\n Olivi[2]\n in 1295. In the 16th century, Juan de\n Medina[3]\n and Luis de\n Molina[4]\n used “ceteris paribus” while discussing economic\nissues. \nIn 1662, William Petty was probably the first to use the term in an\nEnglish language\n publication.[5]\n In his Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, Petty qualifies\nhis labor theory of value by a “caeteris paribus”\nclause: \nJohn Stuart Mill used the explicit phrase “ceteris\nparibus” only\n occasionally[6]\n but it had an important impact because he characterized economy by\nits way of coping with disturbing factors: \nSince economy is thus concerned with one cause only, its laws describe\nwhat would happen provided there are no other causal factors. \nThe view of cp-laws promoted by Mill is the\nabsence-of-disturbing-factors view (see section 7). Another view is\nthe normal-tendency view of cp-laws (see section 8). The historical\nroots of the view are, for example, found in John Elliot\nCairnes’s description of the methodology of economics in his\nCharacter and Logical Method of Political Economy: \nCairnes (1888, 103) uses the expression “ceteris\nparibus” in order to refer to “what would or what\ntends to take place” if normal conditions obtained. \nThe use of ceteris paribus-clauses was advocated and\npopularized by Alfred Marshall in the late 19th century. It was\nMarshall’s genuine contribution to economics to advocate partial\nequilibrium analysis. Marshall claimed that an analysis of this kind\nholds merely ‘ceteris paribus’. In his\ninfluential Principles of Economics, Marshall defines the\ntask of economists in terms of the phrase ‘ceteris\nparibus’: \nIn the introduction to the same work, Marshall explains why economics\nis interested in the isolation of causes by assuming that other\nthings are equal: \nIn a similar vein, Lionel Robbins claims in his classic paper An\nEssay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science that\neconomic laws and antecedent facts deductively imply economic\npredictions, but only if other things remain\n unchanged.[8] \nThe use of “ceteris paribus” in economics and in\nphilosophy of economics is not of merely historiographical interest.\nIn current philosophy of economics and economics, the use of and the\ndebate on “ceteris paribus” is a vital issue: \nOutside the economics literature the use of the ceteris\nparibus-phrase became a central and also controversial issue in\nsome areas of philosophy of science and in philosophy of mind in the\n1980s. \nThe fact that test procedures for scientific theories or hypotheses\nare reliable only if disturbing factors are excluded or at least\ncontrolled for had already been noted by Carnap (1956, 69). Canfield\nand Lehrer (1961) have pointed out that in order to figure as premises\nof deductive-nomological explanations, the laws of physics have to be\nfurnished with cp-clauses. They provide the following example to\nsupport their claim: \nLetting ‘\\(Tx\\)’ mean ‘\\(x\\) is a\nthread’; ‘\\(Wx\\)’ mean the complex\nstatement ‘\\(x\\) is loaded with a weight exceeding that which\ncharacterizes its tensile strength’; and\n‘\\(Bx\\)’ mean ‘\\(x\\) breaks’ we\nwrite the inference schema: \nwhere the function \\(L(Tx \\amp Wx,\nBx)\\) indicates that there is a lawlike connection between\nthe conjunction ‘\\(Tx \\amp Wx\\)’\nand ‘\\(Bx\\)’ but leaves the nature of the\nconnection unspecified. (Canfield & Lehrer 1961, 205) \nThe envisaged prediction (‘\\(Bx\\)’) no longer\nholds if a magnet neutralizes the effect of the weight\n(‘\\(Mx\\)’). This can be accounted for if the\nabsence of the magnet is explicitly mentioned in the law. The problem\nis that the law must be complete with respect to all such factors that\nmight prevent the breaking of the thread. The completeness condition\nrequires that there are no further disturbing factors—i.e., it\nrequires an exclusive cp-clause (see section 3) Canfield and Lehrer\nalso present an argument for why these cp-clauses cannot be defined\naway, namely that any such attempt leads to an infinite regress of\nfurther cp-clauses. \nThe issue of disturbing factors was taken up in 1970 by Lakatos who\nraised it as a problem for the falsificationist methodology: \nPopper only briefly commented on this claim in a footnote (see Popper\n1974, 1186f.), while other authors discussed it explicitly as a\nproblem for falsificationism (see, for instance, Johansen 1980).  \nHempel argues in his 1988 paper “On Provisos” that every\ninferential construal of scientific theory testing is confronted with\nthe problem that a proviso always has to be added: \nIn fact, Hempel dismisses the phrase “ceteris\nparibus” as not particularly helpful. \nCarnap, Lakatos and Hempel all argue that in theory testing we usually\nimplicitly assume an additional premise that states that there are no\ndisturbing factors. Even though in the later literature Hempel’s\npaper has been taken to be evidence for the existence of\ncp-laws even in fundamental physics, the issue of whether a\ncp-clause has to be added as an extra premise in theory\ntesting has to be distinguished from the claim that the laws\nthemselves should be read as containing an implicit cp-clause (for a\ncriticism of this conflation cf. Earman and Roberts 1999, 442ff.;\nSchrenk 2007a, 25–36; Eliot 2011). \nTwo further developments lead to the explicit discussion of\ncp-laws. \nFirst, in her paper “The Truth doesn’t explain\nmuch” (reprinted in Cartwright 1983), Nancy Cartwright\ncriticizes the DN-model of explanation on the grounds that the alleged\nlaws on which the explanation relies (according to the DN-model) are\nnot true, but rather generalizations that hold under special,\ntypically ideal, conditions only. These cp-laws, she claims, will not\ndo the work required: \nCartwright (1983, 46f.) illustrates her claim using Snell’s law\n(for details, see our first example in section 1.1 above).\nSnell’s law is false if read as a universal generalization\nbecause, among other things, it is true only with respect to isotropic\nmedia. \nCartwright explicitly calls Snell’s law a cp-law. Many\nlaws we take to be strict universal laws are in fact cp-laws that hold\nin special circumstances only. According to Cartwright, the problem\narises that these laws cover only special or ideal conditions (most\nmedia are anisotropic), whereas in scientific practice they are used\nto explain phenomena in non-ideal situations as well. Cp-laws seem to\nplay an essential role in explanations but there is no account\navailable of how cp-laws can do this work. \nSecond, the issue of cp-laws became important in the\nphilosophy of mind as well. Davidson argued for his anomalous monism\non the basis of a stark contrast between homonomic and heteronomic\ngeneralizations. Homonomic generalizations are those that can be\nimproved in the same vocabulary, in which they are stated. This\nrequires, as Davidson puts it, a comprehensive closed system that is\nonly provided by physics. Outside of physics, we have only heteronomic\ngeneralizations, i.e., generalizations that can be made precise only\nby drawing on the vocabulary of another science. As a consequence,\nDavidson assumes that only physics has laws, whereas there cannot be\npsycho-physical or psychological laws. More generally,\nDavidson’s argument implies that there are no special science\nlaws (see Davidson 1963,\n 219).[9] \nThis claim provoked discussions about whether there are genuine\npsychological laws (cf. Fodor 1974, 1987, 1991, 1997; Kim 1985, LePore\nand Loewer 1987, 1989; Carrier 1998). Some authors, for example\nSchiffer (1991) and Earman, Roberts and Smith (2002), have even argued\nthat no special science (from biology upwards) has genuine laws of its\nown. By contrast, most authors have supported only the weaker claim\nthat there are no strict special science laws, but have\nargued that special science laws should be construed as laws that\ncontain implicit cp-clauses. \nFodor (1987) observes that we do use psychological generalizations (in\nlater papers, e.g., Fodor (1991) he uses ‘law’ instead of\n‘generalization’) for predicting and explaining human\nbehavior. These generalizations or laws, says Fodor, are\nnon-strict—they are hedged by a cp-clause. Nevertheless, these\nclaims, he insisted are neither false nor uninformative. \nSo, by the end of the 1980s cp-laws had become focal in two important\ndebates: one about the structure of scientific explanations in\ngeneral, the other about the status of the special sciences as\nautonomous scientific disciplines. \nIt has been argued that “ceteris paribus” is an\nambiguous notion. Two distinctions will help to disambiguate\nthe notion: the distinction between comparative and exclusive cp-laws\n(section 3.1), and the distinction between definite and indefinite\ncp-laws (section 3.2). \nSchurz (2002) suggests distinguishing between two conceptions of\ncp-law: comparative versus exclusive. Comparative\ncp-laws require that factors not mentioned in the antecedent or the\nconsequent of the law remain unchanged. By contrast, exclusive cp-laws\nassert the connection between antecedent and consequent only under the\ncondition that certain factors are excluded. \nThe comparative sense of cp-clauses derives from the literal meaning\nof “ceteris paribus” as “the others being\nequal”. A comparative cp-law asserts that the increase (or\ndecrease) of the value of a ‘variable’ \\(X\\) leads to\nan increase (or decrease) of the value of another variable, say\n\\(Y\\), provided that all other (possibly unknown)\n\\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) that describe the\nstates of the considered system (or at least those\n\\(X\\)-independent variables that are potentially interfering)\nremain at same values. Thereby, a variable \\((Z_i)\\) is\ncalled \\(X\\)-independent iff it is not causally\n(or nomologically) influenced by \\(X\\). So, to repeat, that a\nvariable \\(Z\\) is \\(X\\)-independent means (by the above\ndefinition) only that it is not caused by \\(X\\); though it may well\nbe a cause of \\(X\\) (see Schurz 2014 for a novel distinction\nbetween ceteris paribus and ceteris rectis\nlaws). \nThe reason why cp-laws of this type are called\n“comparative” in Schurz (2002) is that the requirement\nthat the other \\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) ‘are\nequal’, or remain at the same values, only makes sense if the\nlaw compares two states of a described (kind of)\nsystem. These two systems differ in the value of the antecedent\nvariable \\(X\\), but agree in their values of the\n\\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\). If the latter\ncondition holds for all possible values of the\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\), the comparative\ncp-law is called unrestricted; otherwise it is called restricted (see\nbelow). Another plausible name for this kind of cp-law would be\n‘equality cp-law’ (this was suggested by the referee),\nbecause it merely requires that the remainder factors are\n‘equal’ in the two compared states of the described\nsystem, rather than that some of them have to be excluded (as in\nexclusive cp-laws).  \nA terminological note: With a “variable” \\(X\\)\n(in the mathematical sense) we mean a functional property of\nindividuals \\(d\\in D\\) of a domain \\(D\\), i.e., a\nfunction \\(X: D\\rightarrow \\ran(X)\\) from \\(D\\) into\n\\(\\ran(X)\\). The set \\(\\ran(X)\\) (for “range of\n\\(X\\)”) is the set of possible values\n\\(x\\in\\ran(X)\\) of the variable \\(X\\); if \\(X\\) is\nquantitative, \\(\\ran(X) = \\Re\\), i.e., the set of real numbers.\n(If \\(ran(X) = \\Re\\) and the values of \\(X\\) are distributed\naccording to a given probability distribution, then \\(X\\) is what\nis called a ‘random variable’ in probability theory; cf.\nHays and Winkler 1975). In what follows,\n“\\(d_{(i)}\\)” denotes proper individual\nvariables (in the logical sense) and\n“\\(x_{(i)}\\)” denotes possible values of\nfunctional variables \\(X_{(i)}\\). An important\nsubcase of comparative cp-laws are probabilistic comparative\ncp-laws, in which the quantitative variables \\(X\\) express the\nprobabilities \\(P(F)\\) of some qualitative\nproperties expressed by predicates \\(F\\) (for instance, \\(F\\)\nmight be the increased probability of a car accident in example (2)\nbelow). \nHere are two examples of comparative cp-laws: \nWhile (1) states a quantitative relation between the\nincreases, only an ordinal relation between the increases is\npredicted in (2). \nComparative cp-laws are connected to the invariance approach of Woodward and Hitchcock (see §6.2 below). According to this\naccount, a cp-generalization expresses what would happen if an\nintervention on \\(X\\) would\n occur.[10]\n In causal graph theory, an intervention is defined as an operation\nwhich changes the value of \\(X\\) and decouples \\(X\\) from all\ncausal parents of \\(X\\) (cf. Pearl 2000, 23f, Woodward 2003, 98).\nThis notion of an intervention has the effect that a change of\n\\(X\\)’s value (as the result of an intervention) will not\nchange the value of any other \\(X\\)-independent\nvariable—which is exactly what is required by a comparative\ncp-law. \nIn the philosophical debate, cp-laws have often been understood in the\nother exclusive sense. An exclusive cp-law asserts that a\ncertain state or event-type \\(A\\) leads to another state or\nevent-type \\(B\\), provided disturbing factors or\ninfluences are absent. \nTerminological note: ‘\\(A\\)’ is called the\nantecedent and ‘\\(B\\)’ the consequent\n‘predicate’. In terms of quantitative variables\n\\(X\\), the predicate formula \\(A(d)\\) may express, for\nexample, that \\(d\\) has a certain \\(X\\)-value \\(x\\), or has\nchanged its \\(X\\)-value from \\(x_1\\) to\n\\(x_2\\). \nThus, an exclusive cp-clause does not merely require holding all other\n\\(X\\)-independent and potentially disturbing factors constant; it\nrather excludes the presence of disturbing factors.\nMore generally, it restricts the possible values of the remainder\nvariables \\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\) to those\nvalue ranges where they cannot disturb the cp-law. Therefore, the\nexclusion-clause of exclusive cp-laws may always be equivalently\nreformulated as a clause which requires that certain truth conditions\nfor the exclusive cp-law hold, namely those conditions which exclude\ndisturbing factors. In this sense, Cartwright has remarked that\n“the literal translation is ‘other things being\nequal’, yet it would be more apt to read ‘ceteris\nparibus’ as ‘other things being\nright’” (1983, 45). Joseph (1980, 777) talked\nabout “ceteris absentibus” clauses, and Hempel\n(1988, 29) calls exclusive cp-clauses “Provisos”\n(“… provided disturbing factors are\nabsent”). \nHere are two examples of exclusive cp-laws—(3) comes from\nphysics and (4) from psychology: \nIn (3), the cp-clause requires that other (non-negligible) forces on\nthe planet except that of the sun are—not merely constant\nbut—absent. Likewise, the cp-clause of (4) requires\nthat any factors causing irrational behavior be absent. \nThe distinction between comparative and exclusive cp-laws is not\ndisjoint: some cp-laws are both comparative and exclusive, as for\nexample in the following example from theoretical economy: \nNot only must the compared economies agree in remainder factors such\nas the supply of the good (this is the comparative aspect); various\ninterferers, such as political regulations which prevent an increase\nof prices, must be excluded (that is the exclusive aspect). \nComparative cp-laws which are not restricted by an exclusive cp-clause\nare also called unrestricted comparative cp-laws. They assert\nan invariant connection between an \\(X\\)-increase and an\n\\(Y\\)-increase for all possible values of \\(X\\) and of\nthe \\(X\\)-independent remainder variables\n\\(Z_1 ,\\ldots ,Z_n\\). Unrestricted\nprobabilistic comparative cp-laws have been suggested as an\nexplication of generic causal relations (Cartwright 1989,\n145f; Eells 1991, 85f): they assert that a variable \\(X\\) is a\nprobabilistic cause of some other variable \\(Y\\) in all possible\ncircumstances, where these circumstances are expressed in terms of the\nvalues of \\(X\\) and the \\(X\\)-independent remainder\nvariables \\(Z_i (1\\le i\\le n)\\). \nUnfortunately, unrestricted invariance claims are rarely true. One\nexample mentioned by Cartwright (1989, §5.2) in which they do\nindeed hold is the force law of classical physics, \\(f :=\nS_{i \\in I}f_i = m \\cdot a\\), which equates the total force\n\\(f\\) with the sum of all component forces. In that case, an\nincrease of a component force \\(f_i\\) will produce an increase of\nacceleration for all possible values of \\(m\\) and the\nremainder forces \\(f_i (i\\in I)\\).  In Schurz (2002, §2, theorem\n1) it is proved that \\(X_i\\) is connected with \\(Y\\) by an\nunrestricted comparative cp-law, where \\(Y\\) is a function of\nindependent variables \\(X_1 ,\\ldots ,X_n\\), iff the \\(X_1 ,\\ldots\n,X_n\\) are\nnon-interacting causes of \\(Y\\) in a certain (technically\ndefined) sense. \nIn moderately complex systems, the composition of causes is usually\ninteractive. Therefore, these systems will only obey\nrestricted comparative cp-laws (Cartwright 1983, 64ff.;\nDupré 1984). Restricted comparative cp-laws are nothing but\ncomparative cp-laws in the scope of an exclusive cp-clause, which\nassert the comparative cp-relation only for a restricted class of\ncircumstances, expressed in terms of allowed values of the independent\nvariable \\(X\\) and the \\(X\\)-independent variables\n\\(Z_i\\). In this sense, examples (1) and (2) above\nare exclusive-comparative cp-laws because in (1), the cp-connection\nbetween temperature and volume holds only for approximately ideal\ngases, and in (2) the cp-connection holds only under psychologically\nnormal conditions. \nAlthough the definiens of a comparative cp-law relating\n\\(X\\) with \\(Y\\) refers to “all \\(X\\)-independent\nvariables”, comparative cp-laws are nevertheless empirically\ntestable by the method of randomized experiments (cf. Fisher 1951). In\nthis method, one randomly splits a sample into two subgroups, an\n“experimental group” and a “control group”,\nthen enforces an increase of the value of \\(X\\) on the experimental\nbut not on the control group, and finally compares the two samples\nconcerning the value of \\(Y\\). Since the split of the original\nsample was random, experimental and control group will agree in their\ndistribution of all \\(X\\)-independent remainder variables,\napart from random errors. Thus, one can apply this method without\nknowing which \\(X\\)-independent variables are causally relevant for\n\\(Y\\) and which are not. If there is a significant change of the\nvalue of \\(Y\\) in the experimental group compared with the control\ngroup, the cp-law “\\(X\\)-increase leads to an\n\\(Y\\)-change” is confirmed (strictly speaking only the\nrestriction of this law to the population from which the sample has\nbeen taken is strongly confirmed, while confirmation of the\nunrestricted cp-law requires tests for a variety of different\n“populations”, i.e., distributions of \\(X\\)-independent\nremainder variables). On the other hand, if there is no significant\nchange of \\(Y\\)’s value, the cp-law is strongly disconfirmed,\neven in its unrestricted form. This does not mean that the method of\nrandomized controlled experiment is free from error possibilities. In\nparticular, the experimentally induced change of \\(X\\)’s\nvalue may have smuggled in unrecognized \\(X\\)-dependent variables\n(i.e., unrecognized side-effects) which are partly responsible for the\nresulting change of \\(Y\\). For example, in a teaching experiment\ncomparing two teaching methods (e.g., the new method and the old\nmethod), the new teaching method may come out as more successful than\nthe old one—yet not because of intrinsic properties of the new\nmethod, but just because the fact that the teaching method was\nnew has increased the motivation of its teachers. \nAn important distinction concerning only exclusive cp-laws is that\nbetween definite and indefinite exclusive cp-laws. A\ndefinite exclusive cp-law specifies the disturbing factors\nwhich are excluded (or the validity conditions which are required) in\nthe antecedent of the law. In other words, a definite exclusive cp-law\n“exclusively cp, if \\(A(d)\\), then\n\\(B(d)\\)” has a strict completion of the form\n“For all \\(d\\): if \\(A(d)\\) and \\(C(d)\\),\nthen \\(B(d)\\)”, where the completing condition\n“\\(C(d)\\)” excludes the presence of the\nspecified disturbing factors in application \\(d\\). Earman, Roberts\nand Smith (2002, 283f.) call definite exclusive cp-laws lazy\ncp-laws. \nHowever, in most cases such a strict completion is impossible. This is\nespecially clear for our non-physical example (2), as well as for the\nfollowing example (6) from biology: \nThe number of possible factors which may disturb a bird’s flying\ncapability is potentially infinite. In other words, for every\ncondition \\(C\\) which excludes a finite list of such factors the\ncompleted law “All birds satisfying \\(C\\) can fly” will\nstill have to face further exceptions—hence, a strict completion\nof this law is impossible. Exclusive cp-laws of this sort are called\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws, or in the terminology of Earman, Roberts\nand Smith (2002), non-lazy cp-laws. \nIt is a widely agreed in philosophy that the real significance of\nexclusive cp-laws lies in situations where strict completion is\nimpossible (for example, cf. Rescher 1994, 14; Pietroski & Rey\n1995, 84, 102; Horgan & Tienson 1996, 119f.). In that case, the\nexclusive cp-law is indefinite, which means that its\nexclusive cp-clause consists in a universal second order condition\nwhich excludes all kinds of disturbing factors to the law, whatever\nthey are. Formally, also an indefinite exclusive cp-law may be written\nas a strictly completed law of the form “if disturbing factors\nare excluded, then \\(A\\)s will always be\n\\(C\\)s”—only that the meaning of “all disturbing\nfactors” is now unclear which leads to various sorts of\ndeficiencies that are discussed in the next section. \nExclusive cp-laws of the form “exclusively cp, \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s” admit exceptions, i.e., instantiations of \\(A\\)s\nwhich are not-\\(B\\)s (Pietroski and Rey speak of\n“abnormal” instances; 1995, 88). A philosophical\nreconstruction of exclusive cp-laws—which includes restricted\ncomparative cp-laws and, thus, the majority of all cp-laws—faces\na severe problem. This problem can be articulated in the form of a\ndilemma. This dilemma has been formulated by Lange (1993, 235), who\nattributes it to Hempel (1988). \nFirst horn: If exclusive cp-laws are reconstructed as some\nsort of strict law, then they will tend to be false. Typically, it\nwill not be the case that all \\(A\\)s satisfying a completer\ncondition \\(C\\) are \\(B\\)s, since the range of potentially\ndisturbing factors is typically indefinable. For instance, the\nrelationship between supply and price is not always as the law of\nsupply says (or, as it seems to say prima facie), because an\ninterfering factor might occur. In other words, special science laws\nthat instantiate perfect regularities are—mildly\nput—“scarce” (Cartwright 1983, 45). Yet, if one\nsupposes that the law is to be formalized as a universally quantified\nconditional sentence, then one counter-instance (due to a disturbing\nfactor) to the universally quantified sentence means that it is\nfalse. \nSecond horn: If we instead suppose that an indefinite\nexclusive ceteris paribus clause is attached to the law so\nthat it means “All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s, if nothing\ninterferes”, then the cp-law in question is in danger of\nlacking empirical content. It lacks empirical content because it seems\nto say nothing more than “All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s or\nnot-(All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s)”. If this is true, then\nexclusive cp-laws are analytically true sentences and, therefore,\ntrivially true. This, however, is an unwelcome consequence because\nlaws of the special sciences should be reconstructed as empirical\nstatements—not as sentences being true in virtue of meaning. \nBoth horns are quite unpleasant results for any philosopher looking\nfor a theory of non-strict laws. To deal with this dilemma is a\ncentral challenge for every theory of ceteris paribus laws\n(Lange 1993; Earman and Roberts 1999; Earman, Roberts and Smith 2002).\nIn the following section, several attempts to cope with this dilemma\nare presented and tenacious problems of them are discussed. \nThe general idea behind completer approaches is that the best way to\nexplicate exclusive cp-laws is to add the missing conditions for a\nstrict implication into the antecedent of the law statement. There are\ntwo quite different possibilities to do this. The first possibility is\nto add these conditions explicitly, by appropriate descriptions of the\nfirst order individual variables involved in the law. If this were the\ncorrect account, all correct cp-laws would turn out to be definite\nexclusive cp-laws (or lazy cp-laws in the terminology of Earman,\nRoberts and Smith 2002). The second possibility is to add these\nconditions by way of a second order quantification over first order\npredicate variables, which apply to the first order individual\nvariables of the law. In this account, cp-laws are turned into\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws. \nFodor’s starting point for his account of cp-laws is\nDavidson’s distinction between homonomic and heteronomic\ngeneralizations (see section 2.2): \nSo, Fodor’s idea is that the additional factors whose existence\nis required by the exclusive cp-clause cannot be completely specified\nwithin the conceptual resources of the special sciences, although this\ncould be done (at least in principle) within the vocabulary of some\nmore fundamental science such as neurophysiology or, ultimately,\nfundamental physics. Fodor calls the missing factors\n‘completers’. A physical microdescription of the\nantecedent condition \\(A\\) is called a realizer of \\(A\\) (the\nsame \\(A\\) may have several different realizers). \n(7) A factor \\(C\\) is a completer relative to a realizer \\(R\\)\nof \\(A\\) and a consequent predicate \\(B\\) iff: \n(Fodor 1991, 23) \nA first option (which Fodor conceives of as insufficient) would be to\ndefine the truth conditions of a cp-law as follows: \nSchiffer has objected to this account on the grounds that if \\(A\\)\nis a (mental) functional state, which can be realized by very\ndifferent states \\(R_i\\), it is highly unlikely\nthat there is a completer for every realization (cf. Schiffer 1991, 5)\nFodor accepts this objection and provides the following account: \nWhile condition (9)(i) repeats the simpler definition in (8),\ncondition (9)(ii) expresses the idea that if \\(A\\) is, for\ninstance, an intentional state and goes into the antecedent of many\nlaws, then even if \\(R_i\\) does not have\ncompleters in the cp-law in question, cp\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is\nstill true, if \\(R_i\\) does have completers in\nmany other cp-laws. \nMott (1992) provided the following counterexample to condition (ii) of\nthis account of truth-conditions: cp, if a person is thirsty, then she\nwill eat salt. This comes out as a true cp-law, because on the one\nhand, very likely many, maybe all, realizers of “being\nthirsty” lack completers (because nobody tends to eat salt when\nthirsty). On the other hand, ‘being thirsty’ might very\nwell go into the antecedent of many other cp-laws for which there are\nsuch completers. Mott’s counter-example can be avoided if one\nadds to (ii) the requirement that for sufficiently many realizers\n\\(R_j\\) of \\(A\\) there exist completers with\nrespect to \\(B\\) (see Silverberg 1996 and Earman and Roberts 1999,\nsection 9 for discussion). \nAlthough Fodor starts with the hope that the missing conditions of\nexclusive cp-laws could eventually be specified in the fundamental\nscience, his definition of exclusive cp-laws involves a second order\nquantification over variable (unspecified) completers of independent\nexception-explainers. Hence, his account of exclusive cp-laws belongs\nto the family of indefinite exclusive cp-laws. Because of this fact\nFodor’s and related accounts face severe problems, as will be\ndiscussed in section\n 5.2.[11] \nSchiffer, Fodor and Mott try to explicate cp-laws by ordinary\ntruth-conditions. In contrast, Pietroski and Rey provide stronger\nconditions for what they call “non-vacuous truth”, in\nterms of epistemic conditions such as explanation and\nindependent confirmability. Pietroski and Rey compare cp-clauses to\ncheques: \nCompletion is conceived here as explanatory completion and it is\nrequired only post factum. If there is a counter-instance of\nthe law in question, we are committed to explain why the law was not\ninstantiated: \nFor the cp-law to be acceptable in spite of the counter-instance we\nneed independent evidence for the existence of the disturbing factor.\nIt would not be acceptable if the only evidence for the existence of\nthe disturbing factor were the counter-instance we started with. \nPietroski and Rey (1995, 92) take a cp-law to be non-vacuously true\nand hence epistemically acceptable iff (in simplified words) the\nfollowing conditions are met: \n(10) cp\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is non-vacuously true iff \nPietroski & Rey’s (1995) account involves a second order\nquantification over unspecified exception-explainers. Thus, as in the\ncase of semantic completer accounts, their account explicates\nindefinite exclusive cp-laws and faces severe problems to be explained\nin the next section. \nSeveral authors have independently shown that completer approaches are\nunsatisfactory. Earman and Roberts (1999, 454f) provide arguments\nwhich show that an exclusive cp-law in the sense of Pietroski and Rey\ncannot escape the problem of vacuity. Their example is the\nalleged cp-law “cp, all spherical bodies conduct\nelectricity”. Every failure of this law can be explained in\nterms of a factor, for which we have independent evidence,\nviz. the molecular structure of the body in question. Schurz\n(2001a) proves that Pietroski & Rey’s exclusive cp-laws are\nnot vacuous but almost vacuous. More precisely, the content\nof “exclusively cp, \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” in the sense\nof Pietroski & Rey’s definition (10) is equivalent to the\nclaim that for every event of the form “\\(d\\) is an \\(A\\)\nand \\(d\\) is (or is not) a \\(B\\)” there exists a true\nstrict completer \\(C(d)\\) such that either “All\n\\((A\\wedge C)\\)s are \\(B\\)s” or “All\n\\((A\\wedge C)\\)s are \\(\\neg B\\)s” is a strictly true\nlaw. This means that conditional on \\(A\\), every \\(B\\)-event or\nnot\\(-B\\)-event is assumed a deterministic and independently\nidentifiable cause, whatever this cause may be. This presupposition of\ndeterminism is both too strong and too weak: It is too weak because it\ndoes not establish a relevant nomological connection between \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\). It is too strong because in all areas involving random\nprocesses, determinism does not hold. Woodward (2002, §2) has\ndemonstrated that a similar criticism affects Fodor’s\naccount. \nThere is an even more serious accidentality-problem that is\nconnected to the almost-vacuity of indefinite exclusive cp-laws. An\nexclusive cp-law may be true although its antecedent is not at all\nnomologically or causally relevant for its consequent. All sorts of\nevents are connected by indefinite exclusive cp-laws, provided only\nthat they have deterministic causes, which for Pietroski and Rey\n(1995) have additionally to be independently testable, and for Fodor\n(1991) have to be nomologically relevant (cf. Woodward 2002, 309, (ii,\niii)). For example, Woodward (2002, 310) demonstrates that according\nto the explications of Pietroski and Rey (1995), Fodor (1991) and\nHausman (1992), the exclusive cp-law “all charged particles\naccelerate at a rate of \\(n\\) meters/sec\\(^2\\)” is a\ntrue exclusive cp-law for arbitrary values of \\(n\\). Schurz (2002,\n364) demonstrates that according to these accounts “if a person\nlooks to the right, she will see a kangaroo” is a true exclusive\ncp-law. Also, Earman & Robert’s example can be read as\ndemonstrating the accidentality of “cp, all spherical\nbodies conduct electricity”, although the example was originally\nused to show that this statement is vacuously true. \nThe common guiding idea of invariance or stability theories is that\nthe laws differ from non-laws in virtue of their invariance or\nstability under counterfactual suppositions. \n“Stability” and “invariance” are often taken\nto be synonyms. For the sake of clarity, we will use\n“stability” to refer to Lange’s stability theory of\nlaws (section 6.1) and we will use “invariance” to refer\nto Woodward & Hitchcock’s invariance theory of laws (section\n6.2). \nIn stability/invariance accounts, laws qualified by a cp-clause are\nconsidered to be non-strict in the sense that they hold true only\nunder a limited range of counterfactual suppositions. Different\nversions of invariance or stability theories differ in how they\ndetermine this limited range of counterfactual suppositions.\nIn this sense, invariance or stability theories can be understood as\nan alternative to exclusive interpretations of non-strict laws and as\nan attempt to deal with the dilemma of triviality and falsity. \nAccording to Lange (2000, 2002, 2005), the universal fundamental laws\nin physics and the cp-laws in the inexact special sciences differ only\nin degree (for a related account that does not focus on stability\nalone see Mitchell (2000)). The lawhood of universal laws and cp-laws\nis due to the same property of these statements: their stability.\nLange’s (2000, 8f.) approach consists in two steps. First, the\nrole of laws in scientific reasoning is determined: they figure in\nexplanations and predictions, they support counterfactuals, and they\nare inductively confirmed. And second, it is claimed that the laws can\nplay this role because of their characteristic stability. So, in order\nto understand Lange’s account of cp-laws, we must first clarify the\ncrucial notion of stability. \nLange’s basic idea is that laws are lawlike because they are\ntrue in a wide range of possible conditions. Most importantly, the\nlaws do not only hold true in any (non-nomic) actual\nconditions but also remain true under all (non-nomic)\ncounterfactual suppositions. Along these lines, Lange (2000,\n48f.; cf. 2009a, 20) proposes a preliminary definition of laws in\nterms of nomic preservation: \nThis definition, however, raises an obvious question: what does it\nmean to be physically possible? Roughly, a proposition \\(p\\) is a\nphysical possibility iff there is some possible world \\(w\\) where\nthe same laws of nature hold as in the actual world and \\(p\\)\nobtains at \\(w\\). But if this is true, Lange’s definition of\nlawhood seems to be circular, since being consistent with the\nlaws (of the actual world) is ultimately part of the\ndefiniens of being a law (of the actual world). Lange (2005,\n2009a, 25–28) recognizes the problem of circularity and offers\nan alternative account of laws in terms of the notion of stability. It\nsays, roughly put:  \nThis notion of stability in turn leads to a theory of laws: \nAccording to Lange (cf. 2005, chapter 4; 2009a, chapter 2), there\nexist several different stable sets: for example, the set of logical\ntruths, the set of all physical laws, and the set of all truths (which\nis trivially stable). The requirement of \\(G\\) to be non-maximal,\ni.e., to be strictly smaller than the set of all truths, is necessary\nto avoid the identification of the set of laws with the set of all\ntruths. \nLange argues that definition (13) is not affected by the circularity\nproblem, since stability does not presuppose the notion of a law, and\nthat it provides a sharp distinction between laws and merely\naccidentally true non-laws. Consider some accidentally true universal\nstatement as for example: \nAccording to Lange, this generalization is an accidental truth because\nit is not a member of a (non-maximal) stable set. For assume \\(A\\)\nis a member of some non-maximal set \\(\\Delta\\) (which may contain all\nphysical laws). By non-maximality, there exists some further\naccidental truth \\(B\\), for example, \nwhich is not in \\(\\Delta\\). If \\(\\Delta\\) is stable, every member of \\(\\Delta\\)\nmust remain true under the counterfactual supposition that\n\\(\\neg\\)A\\(\\vee \\neg B\\), since this supposition is compatible with\nevery member of \\(\\Delta\\). However, Lange (2005, 421) argues that there\nare at least some conversational contexts in which \\(A\\) does not\nhave priority over \\(B\\). Hence,\n\\(\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\rightarrow A\\) is not the\ncase, and therefore \\(\\Delta\\) is not stable under the counterfactual\nsupposition \\(\\neg A\\vee \\neg B\\). By contrast, according to\nLange, a law of nature has priority over any accidental truth in every\ncontext, and thus the laws of nature form a stable set.  \nEven assuming that Lange’s argumentation is valid (see, however,\nDemarest (2012) and Hall (2011) for criticism based on the\ncontext-sensitivity of counterfactuals), there is the worry that the\ncircularity problem has not entirely been dissolved: It reappears at\nthe level of the truth conditions for counterfactuals, since usually\nthey are formulated in terms of the laws (see, e.g., Goodman 1947;\nLewis 1973; Maudlin 2007: 21). Lange (2009a: chapter 4) answers this\nobjection by arguing that subjunctive facts are ontologically\nprimitive and the truth conditions for counterfactuals do not refer to\nlaws. He concludes that, therefore, his explications (12) and (13) are\nnot circular.  \nWe can now turn to the question how cp-laws differ from universal\nlaws. According to Lange, cp-laws are stable (sets of) propositions\nwhose application is pragmatically restricted to the purposes\nof a scientific discipline. He elaborates this idea with respect to\nthe laws in the special sciences, or inexact sciences as he calls\nthem: “A set is stable for the purpose of an inexact\nscience if and only if it is invariant under every counterfactual\nsupposition of interest to the science and consistent with the\nset” (Lange 2002, 416). Lange tries to avoid the horns of the\nFalsity-or-Triviality-Dilemma by treating ‘ceteris\nparibus’ as a name for a set \\(I\\) of interfering\nfactors. Notice that \\(I\\) does not list all the possible\ninterferences which prevent the occurrence of \\(B\\) in ‘cp,\nall \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s’, but only those factors that are\nrelevant (for a discipline). One can understand Lange in a\nway that he provides two\n strategies[12]\n to determine the members of \\(I\\): (A) the strategy of\nnon-negligibility and (B) the strategy of intended interest of a\nscience. Both strategies try to explicate a methodology that is\nimplicitly used by scientists in a particular discipline (cf. Lange\n2000, 170–174). \n(A) The strategy of non-negligibility: Instead of providing a\ncomplete list of all interfering factors, scientists merely refer to\nthose interfering factors “that arise sufficiently often, and\ncan cause sufficiently great deviations from \\(G\\)-hood, that a\npolicy of inferring \\(F\\)s to be \\(G\\) […] would not be\ngood enough for the relevant purposes” (Lange 2002, 411; Lange\n2000, 170f). For instance, consider the economic law “cp, if the\nsupply of a commodity increases then the price decreases”.\nAccording to Lange, it may happen that the increase in supply is so\nsmall that no decrease in price results. But it might as well happen\nthat the price does not decrease although the supply increases\nsignificantly, because a gigantic comet hitting the planet Earth and\ndestroying all life on its surface disturbs the instantiation of this\nlaw. The comet causes sufficiently great deviation from a decrease in\nthe price of a good. Nevertheless, comets are negligible for the\npurposes of economists because their occurrence does not arise\nsufficiently often to count as interfering factor that is to be\nexplicitly listed in the cp-conditions. \n(B) The strategy of intended interest of a science: A law may\nstill count as stable if it fails to hold under those counterfactual\nsuppositions that do not fall into the range of the laws intended\npurpose and application. This point is best illustrated by an example\nfrom island biogeography—the area law—provided by\nLange: \nThere are counterfactual suppositions for which the area law is not\ntrue. For example, imagine an island where the animals of the species\n“chicken” exclusively live on chicken farms. Suppose\nfurther that on these farms chicken are bred and held under extremely\ncrowded conditions. So, the counterfactual supposition stemming from\nthis example is “chicken on the island in question are bred\nunder extremely crowded, artificial conditions set up by\nfarmers”. Obviously, the area law will drastically fail to hold\nfor this case. Moreover, cases of this kind are not far-fetched\nphilosophical thought experiments: they do not occur\nrarely in times of cultivated breeding of animals (as\nrequired by the strategy of non-negligibility). Nevertheless,\nscientists exclude this kind of exceptions because it conflicts with\nthe intended purpose and application of their discipline (in this\ncase: island biogeography) (cf. Lange 2002, 417; Lange 2000, 232f. for\nfurther\n examples[14]). \nIt is illuminating to contrast Lange’s strategies of determining\na set of disturbing influences \\(I\\) (in the light of intended\napplications of a law) with the use of cp-clauses that does indeed\nrender a statement trivial. Lange illustrates this point by an example\nof a mere “excuse clause”: \nAccording to Lange, excuse clauses of this kind differ from cp-clauses\nas used in the sciences, because the latter refer to strategies of\ndetermining disturbing factors. Although the relevant set of\ndisturbing factors is not listed explicitly, it is implicit in the\nscientific practice (and the education and studies) in a particular\nfield of inquiry. \nBased on his stability theory of laws, Lange also proposes an argument\nfor the autonomy and irreducibility of special science laws. Recall\nthat arguing for the autonomy and irreducibility of the special\nsciences with respect to physics was one of the crucial motivations to\nstart the debate on cp-laws (see section 2.2). Suppose that the laws\nof a certain special science \\(D\\) are stable with respect to the\npurposes of \\(D\\). This pragmatic restriction is unique to\n\\(D\\). In other words, \\(D\\)’s laws are stable for\ncounterfactual suppositions that violate other disciplines’\nlaws, for example the laws of fundamental physics. For instance, Lange\n(2002, 420) claims that ‘the area law would still have held had\nthere been birds equipped with organs weakening gravity’s pull\nsomewhat’. Having organs that weaken gravity’s pull is\nunderstood as a violation of the law of gravitation. Thus,\n\\(D\\)’s laws are stable under some counterfactual supposition\nfor which fundamental physics is unstable. This unique range of\nstability makes \\(D\\) epistemically autonomous as a scientific\ndiscipline because \\(D\\)’s laws can figure, for instance, in\nexplanations answering some why-questions that no other discipline can\nanswer as adequately as \\(D\\) itself (cf. Lange 2000, chapter 8;\nLange 2002, 420f.; also Reutlinger & Koch 2008). \nSimilar to Lange’s stability theory, the invariance approach\n(most prominently advocated in EG1, EG2;\nWoodward 2000, 2002, 2003) also identifies the stability or invariance\nof a generalization as its key feature for performing the role of a\nlaw and figuring in explanations and predictions. As in Lange’s\ntheory, to be invariant means for Woodward and Hitchcock to be true\nunder several (not necessarily all) counterfactual suppositions.\nDespite this basic agreement there are important respects in which the\ninvariance theory differs from Lange’s stability theory. In what\nfollows we focus on the distinguishing features of the invariance\napproach: \nCounterfactual Suppositions Viewed\nDifferently—Interventions: Invariance theories characterize\nthe counterfactually supposed antecedent conditions under which a\ngeneralization remains stable differently than Lange’s stability\ntheory. Lange simply assumes these conditions, e.g., the temperature\nof the gas is 32ºC, to be the result of counterfactual\nsuppositions. We suppose that \\(p\\) is true and see whether the law\n\\(l\\) remains true supposing \\(p\\). So, stability theory is\nindifferent concerning how the supposed state of affairs comes about.\nInvariance theory is more restrictive in characterizing the\ncounterfactual situations: A counterfactual situation refers to a\nchange in the value of a variable. For an invariance\ntheorist, it is important to explain how the change of a\nvariable is brought about: the change of the value of a variable must\nbe the causal outcome of an intervention. An intervention\nconsists in a local change that sets a variable \\(X\\) to a\ncertain value and at the same time decouples \\(X\\) from all\n\\(X\\)-independent variables, as explained in section 3. So, an\nintervention on \\(X\\) is a direct, exogenous causal influence on\nsome variable \\(X\\) which (1) does only act on \\(X\\) itself\nwhile (2) other variables \\((Z)\\) are only changed in virtue of\nbeing directly or indirectly caused by the change in \\(X\\). Notice\nthat interventions need not be carried out by human beings. Instead\nthey are conceived as hypothetical (not necessarily human) causes.\n(cf. Woodward 2003, 98; and Woodward 2003, 103f., 123–127 for\narguments against an anthropomorphic interpretation of interventions.)\n \nDifferent kinds of Variables: Invariance theories distinguish\ntwo kinds of variables: (1) Explicit variables, that figure explicitly\nin a generalization and (2) background variables, that describe\nbackground conditions which are not mentioned in the generalization in\nquestion. Consequently, interventions can be carried out with respect\nto both kinds of\n variables.[15] \nSimilar to Lange’s theory, Woodward and Hitchcock use the\nintended purposes of inquiry of a certain discipline to distinguish\nbetween interventions into explicit variables and background variables\n(cf., e.g., Woodward 2003, 262f). According to their invariance\ntheory, only the former are of importance to laws in a specific\nscientific discipline. Woodward uses an example from economics to\nillustrate the point: \nObviously, the reason to ignore rare but possible changes in the\nbackground variables is very similar to Lange’s strategy of\nnon-negligibility. Woodward contrasts these negligible changes of\nbackground variables with important changes of explicit variables: \nConditions of Invariance: Invariance theories differ\ndrastically from Lange’s approach in defining their key notion,\ni.e., stability or invariance. According to Woodward and Hitchcock\n(EG1, 17) and Woodward (2003, 250): \nThe most intuitive case of a testing intervention might be the\nfollowing one: \\(X=x_1\\) describes an actual state\nof affairs while \\(X=x_2\\) describes a possible\ncounterfactual state of affairs. For instance, suppose that\nBoyle’s gas law —\\(p \\cdot V = N \\cdot k cdot T\\)—is true for the actual\ntemperature of a gas \\(g\\) of 30°C. According to the testing\nintervention condition, Boyle’s gas law is stable if it also\nholds for (counterfactual) temperature of, say, 40°C. One might\ncall this kind of invariance “minimal” invariance.\nContrary to Lange’s theory, minimal invariance is necessary and\nsufficient for the statement to count as invariant. Notice, however,\nthat invariance under variations of background variables is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for being minimally invariant (cf. Woodward\n2003, 248; EG1, 7f.). \nAccording to Woodward & Hitchcock, laws or generalizations in the\nspecial sciences do not hold under all interventions. They merely hold\nfor a certain range of possible values (of those variable figuring in\nthe law statement). By being non-strict the generalizations in the\nspecial sciences do not satisfy a condition that is traditionally\nassociated with laws of nature, namely the condition of universality.\nNonetheless, being invariant for a limited range of values is enough\nfor a proposition to play a lawlike role in the sciences, as is argued in EG2. Woodward and Hitchcock (EG2,\n184–189) develop further criteria and examples of determining\nthe degree of invariance of a generalization \\(G\\) (e.g., comparing\ntwo generalizations \\(G\\) and \\(G*, G\\) might be more\nexact than \\(G^*\\) with respect to the same range of intended\napplication; or \\(G\\) might be more or less sensitive to variations\nin the background conditions than \\(G^*\\) etc.). \nLet us compare Lange’s stability theory and Woodward &\nHitchcock’s invariance theory with respect to the range of\ncounterfactual suppositions or, alternatively, interventions to which\nthe law is applicable. One can say that Lange’s stability theory\nand Woodward & Hitchcock’s invariance theory start from\nopposed extremes of the spectrum of stability: (1) Lange starts at the\nmaximum of stability, i.e., he starts with the claim that a\nlaw-proposition \\(l\\) remains true for all counterfactual\nsuppositions that are consistent with \\(l\\), where by definition a\ncounterfactual supposition is admissible if it is consistent with the\nlaws of nature. In a second step, Lange reduces the set of all\ncounterfactual suppositions consistent with \\(l\\) because of\ncertain pragmatic goals of the discipline which uses the proposition\n\\(l\\). (2) Woodward and Hitchcock start with minimal stability,\ni.e., the satisfaction of the testing intervention condition for some\nproposition \\(l\\). In a second step, Woodward and Hitchcock add to\nminimal stability that \\(l\\)’s degree of invariance increases\nwith the number of possible interventions for which \\(l\\) holds\n(among other criteria). \nAnalogously, Lange argues for a principled distinction between laws\nand accidents within the framework of his stability theory (section\n6.1). However, Lange’s strategy to distinguish laws from\naccidents seems to be partly motivated by the intuition that\nminimal invariance in Woodward & Hitchcock’s sense\nis too weak to account for real life stability displayed by\nscientific generalizations. Correspondingly, Lange (2009b:\n297–302) argues that Woodward & Hitchcock’s account\nfails to distinguish laws from mere accidents and therefore also fails\nto account for the laws’ characteristic explanatory power.  \nJohn Stuart Mill objected to the claim that laws might have\nexceptions. The problem of exceptions disappears if laws are taken to\nrefer to tendencies. \nThis idea was taken up by Cartwright and others. Cartwright’s\ndiscussion of cp-laws focused on the question why cp-laws are of\ninterest in non-ideal situations. If what cp-laws say is confined to\nspecial, namely ideal, circumstances it seems prima facie\nthat these laws are irrelevant for all other, non-ideal, situations.\nThat, however, is not the case in scientific practice. Cp-laws are\nused to explain phenomena outside the ideal circumstances. Cartwright\nargues that this practice requires the postulation of capacities or\ntendencies: \nSubsequently, her suggestion has been taken up by several authors that\nattempt to provide a semantics for cp-laws or even of laws in general\nin terms of dispositions (cf. Hüttemann 1998, 2007; Lipton 1999;\nDrewery 2001; and Bird 2005, 2007, chapter 3). \nThe prima facie advantage of a dispositional account of laws\nvis-á-vis the cp-law-problem is the following: The\ndispositional account provides a semantics for cp-laws.\nAccording to one version of the dispositionalist account of cp-laws\n(see Hüttemann 2014), a law statement is true provided the type\nof system in question has the disposition that the law statement\nattributes to the system. Reconstructing law-statements as statements\nabout dispositions, tendencies, or capacities rather than about overt\nbehavior turns cp-laws into strict laws. The claim is—as in\nMill—that certain kinds of systems have certain kinds of\ntendencies or dispositions. In stating the law, it is no longer\nnecessary to appeal to cp-clauses. One advantage is that the so-called\nproblem of instantiation, “the problem that many cp-laws appear\nnot to have any instances” (Lipton 1999, 164) can be solved. The\nlaw is no longer considered to be a description of the systems’\noccurrent behavior that is only manifest under very special\nconditions—if at all. The law concerns the underlying stable\ntendencies or dispositions. Furthermore, this dispositionalist account\nis able to provide a rationale for why scientists are interested in\ncp-laws. Cp-laws describe how systems behave in the absence of\ndisturbing factors, i.e., if the disposition, tendency etc. can\nmanifest itself completely. This knowledge can be used to account for\nmore complex situations, in which various systems and their\ndispositions are intertwined—provided laws of superposition are\navailable. \nThere is a different version of dispositionalism about cp-laws\naccording to which they are not turned into strict laws (see Bird\n2007: section 3.3). In a nutshell, Bird’s general idea is that the\n“laws are those regularities whose truth is guaranteed by the\nessentially dispositional nature of one or more of the constituent\nproperties” (Bird 2007: 46–47). According to Bird, fundamental\nessentially dispositional properties or potencies give rise to strict\nlaws, since there are no (or only very few) finks or\nantidotes that would prevent the manifestation of the potency\nfrom occurring if the stimulus had occurred (see Bird 2007 chapters\n3.3.2 and 3.3.3, and the SEP-entry on dispositions for details on\ninterferes such finks and antidotes). However, the\nmanifestation process of non-fundamental dispositional properties can\nbe interfered with and so the manifestation only occurs ceteris\nparibus, i.e., in conditions where the trigger occurs and\nfinks and antidotes are absent (see Bird 2007:\nchapter 3.3.1). Therefore, these non-fundamental properties give rise\nto ceteris paribus laws only.  \nWe want to focus on two kinds of concerns that have been raised with\nrespect to dispositionalist accounts: \nDispositions, powers, potencies or tendencies may be present without\nbeing manifest (cf. Earman and Roberts 1999, 451f.): \nAs a rejoinder, dispositionalists can point to laws of composition. As\na consequence, it is not the disposition on its own that can explain\nthe actual pattern in such cases but rather the dispositions plus the\nlaw of composition. For example, Newton’s second law with (i)\nthe gravitational force and (ii) the Coulomb-force describe two\ndispositions that explain the actual behavior of a particle relying on\nthe law for the superposition of forces. The law for the superposition\nof forces describes how the two forces contribute to the actual\nbehavior. (Note that the dispositions the laws of nature attribute to\nsystems need not in general be taken to be macroscopic dispositions\nlike fragility or solubility.) To the extent that such laws are\navailable (as for example for physical forces) the contribution of the\nvarious tendencies or dispositions can be determined even if they fail\nto be (completely) manifest. It can, however, be disputed whether such\nlaws of superposition/composition are available in general, especially\nif one holds like Bird (2007) that every law needs to be grounded in\npotencies. But even if composition laws are taken to be underpinned by\ndispositions, a further law seems to be needed that tells us what\nhappens if the disposition for the law of composition fails to be\nmanifest. We need a meta-law that tells what the law of composition\ncontributes to the actual behavior. So, the assumption that laws of\ncomposition are grounded in dispositions attributed to physical\nsystems threatens to lead to an infinite regress. \nA second problem concerns the question whether a dispositional account\ncan indeed avoid the dilemma for exclusive cp-laws (see section 4).\nEven though it is true, at least on one version, that the laws no\nlonger appeal explicitly to cp-clauses, the\ntriviality-or-falsity-dilemma turns up at a different place (see\nLipton 1999, section 5: Hume’s revenge). The dispositionalist\nstill has to specify the stimulus or triggering conditions for the\ndisposition in order to give the disposition’s ascription a\ndeterminate content. The conditions under which the disposition will\nmanifest itself are exactly those that are required to explicate the\ncp-clause (see Lipton 1999, section 5; for an extensive discussion of\nthis problem cf. also Schrenk 2007b). So, explicating the triggering\nconditions of a disposition requires that something informative is\nsaid about the cp-clauses, and more generally, leads us back to the\nproblems discussed in the previous sections (see Hüttemann 2014\nfor a recent defense of the dispositionalist approach to cp-laws; Ward\n2009 provides a critical discussion).  \nThe reconstructions of exclusive cp-laws in terms of strict\ncompletions do not imply anything about the probability with\nwhich undisturbed antecedent-events will produce the consequent (cf.\nPietroski and Rey 1995, p. 84; Schiffer 1991, p. 8). According to\nproponents of normality theories this seems to be counterintuitive,\nbecause cp-laws should be asserted only if the situation without\n(non-negligible) disturbing factors is a normal or at least a\nrather probable situation. Examples of correct exclusive cp-laws which\nviolate this normality condition are, for example: “exclusively\ncp, no tire blows out”, “exclusively cp, there are no\nclouds in the sky”, etc. Several authors have therefore\ndeveloped so-called normality accounts of cp-laws, including\nSilverberg (1996), Earman and Roberts (1999, 463), Spohn (2002), Spohn\n(2012, chapter 13), and Schurz (2001b, 2002), who argues that the\nnormality interpretation is the preferred interpretation of exclusive\ncp-laws in the life sciences, from biology upwards to the\nsocial sciences. \nNormality theories can be understood as an alternative to the\n(definite and/or indefinite) exclusive interpretation of non-strict\nlaws. The general idea of normality theories is that “cp, all\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” means that normally \\(A\\)s\nare \\(B\\)s. They can also be combined with a comparative\ninterpretation into normic-comparative law-statements such as\n“normally an increase of \\(X\\) leads to an increase of\n\\(Y\\) when other \\(X\\)-independent variables are held\nconstant”. However, the normality accounts differ in their\nexplication of the notion of “normally”. One possibility\n(suggested by Schurz 2001b, 2002, see section 8.1) is to explicate the\nnormality condition in terms of a high probability of the consequent\npredicate, given the antecedent predicate, where the underlying\nconditional probabilities are objective statistical probabilities\nbased on the dispositions of evolutionary systems. Another possibility\n(suggested by Spohn 2012, see section 8.2) is to explicate the\nnormality conditions in terms of degrees of belief and ranking\nfunctions over possible worlds. \nLargely independently of Schurz’s and Spohn’s specific\napproaches but in agreement with the general idea of the normality\napproach, Hüttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko (2014),\nReutlinger (2014), Roberts (2014) and Strevens (2014) have recently\nexplored a statistical approach to cp-laws, according to which cp-law\nstatements are statistical claims. \nSchurz (2001b; 2002, §5) analyses cp-laws in non-physical\nsciences as normic laws of the form “\\(A\\)s are\nnormally \\(B\\)s”. Here are some examples (4* and 6* are the\nnormic reconstructions of 4 and 6 above): \nAccording to the statistical consequence thesis, normic laws\nimply numerically unspecified statistical generalizations of the form\n“Most \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s”, by which they can be\nempirically tested. The statistical consequence thesis has been\nchallenged by cognitive scientists (e.g., McCarthy 1986) and by\nphilosophers of biology (e.g., Millikan 1984). Schurz (2001b) defends\nthe statistical consequence thesis by the following argument which is\nbased on the generalized theory of evolution that does not only apply\nto biological evolution but also to cultural evolution (cf. Mesoudi\net al. 2006 for an excellent overview on generalized\nevolution theory; see Strößner 2015 for a recent\ndiscussion). \nThe common domain of the life sciences (which, according to Schurz,\ninclude biology, psychology as well as the social sciences and the\nhumanities) are evolutionary systems or their products. Evolutionary\nsystems are systems whose self-regulatory properties have been\ngradually selected according to their contribution to reproductive\nsuccess. The temporal persistence of self-regulatory systems is\ngoverned by a certain range of prototypical norm states, in\nwhich these systems constantly have to be in order to stay alive. They\nmanage this with the help of regulatory mechanisms which\ncompensate for disturbing influences of the environment.\nAlthough the self-regulatory capacities of evolutionary systems are\nthe product of a long adaptation history, they are not perfect.\nDysfunctions may occur, whence their normic behavior may have various\nexceptions. Yet, it must be the case that these systems are\nin their prototypical norm states in the high statistical\nmajority of cases and times, since otherwise, they would not have\nsurvived in evolution. \nIn this way, the evolution-theoretic foundation of normic laws does\nnot only explain why normic laws are the typical form of the laws of\nlife sciences. It also explains why normic laws are not strict but\nnevertheless are associated with high conditional statistical\nprobabilities, at least for most cases and times in evolution. \nAccording to Schurz (2002), the difference between idealization\nconditions in physics and normality conditions in evolutionary\nsciences can be explained as follows: In physics, one traditionally\nthinks of complexity as a source of\ndisorder—regularities are obtained by abstracting\naway from complexities. In evolutionary systems, by contrast,\ncomplexity is usually a source of\norder—complexity which has been selected by\nevolution to stabilize normic behavior. As Wachbroit (1994, 587f.)\nputs it, ideal planets are theoretical abstractions: mass points under\nthe influence of a centripetal force and ‘nothing else’.\nThey do not literally exist. In contrast, normal birds really\ndo exist because they are what has been selected through\nevolution. When speaking of a normal bird, we do not abstract from its\nadmirable complexity, but we rely on it as the cause of its\nnormal behavior. This does not mean that abstract laws of physics\n(e.g., the laws of aerodynamics) play no role in the explanation of\nfunctional behaviors of evolutionary systems (e.g., that birds can\nfly). However, even when we explain a bird’s flying ability in\nterms of the laws of aerodynamics, we still have to assume a\n‘normal’ bird which possesses the typical capabilities of\nbirds that have been selected through evolution. The idealization\nprocedures needed for planets would not make good sense for birds:\nthere are no disturbing parameters which, when going to zero, turn a\nreal bird into an ideal bird which can necessarily fly and which is\napproximated by the real bird. \nAnother way to understand “ceteris paribus” as\nreferring to normal conditions is introduced by Wolfgang Spohn (1997,\nsection 5; 2002, section 4; 2012, chapter 13.2; 2014). Spohn takes the\nconnection between ceteris paribus qualifications and\nnormality to be straightforward: “ceteris\nparibus” means other things being normal. Let us\ncall this the Normal Condition Approach. The basic idea of\nthe Normal Conditions Approach is that a cp-law \\(L\\) holds when\nnormal conditions obtain. Spohn characterizes normal conditions as\n“exactly those conditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain\n[…] in the small space-time region inhabited by us”\n(Spohn 1997, 278). Translated in probabilistic terms, the expression\n“conditions that normally, usually, mostly obtain” means\nthat the occurrence of some conditions is highly\nprobable. \nFor Spohn, a condition is “normal” if it is (i) expected\nor (ii) at least not ruled out to obtain by a rational, epistemic\nagent (for formal definitions of normal and exceptional conditions cf.\nSpohn 2002, section 4, and Spohn 2012, chapter 13.4). He illustrates\nhis Normal Conditions Approach with Hooke’s Law: \nSpohn concludes that Hooke’s law holds under normal conditions\nand draws an analogy to other law statements in the special\nsciences: \nSpohn’s Normal Conditions approach differs from Schurz’s\nNormic Laws approach in at least two respects. \nAccording to Spohn (and contrary to Schurz’s theory which refers\nto objective probabilities), the fact that normal conditions obtain is\nconceived epistemically and, more specifically, doxastically. An\nepistemic agent forms beliefs about the normality of conditions, i.e.,\nsomeone strongly believes that some condition obtains (cf. Spohn 2002,\n385). \nSpohn describes “the epistemic functioning” of beliefs\n(doxastic states) about normality by modeling degrees of belief in\nterms of ranking functions (originally developed in Spohn 1988 under\nthe label “ordinal conditional functions”; cf. also Spohn\n2012 and the SEP-entry ‘Formal Representations of Belief’,\nsection 3.3) \nNormality in Spohn’s theory is explicated in terms of background\nconditions, not in terms of probabilistic relations between the\nantecedent predicate and the consequent predicate. If someone believes\nthat the law \\(f(X)=Y\\) holds, then she believes that\nthis functional relation holds under normal conditions \\(N\\), which\nmeans in terms of Spohn’s ranking functions that the law\n\\(f(X)=Y\\) is believed with rank zero, i.e., it is\ntrue in all normal worlds of a ranked world model. Such a ranked world\nmodel consists of a set of possible worlds together with a ranking\nfunction which attaches to each world a natural number \\(0, 1, \\ldots ,n\\) specifying its rank. Worlds with rank 0 are the most normal\nworlds, worlds with rank 1 contain exceptions from normal conditions\n(1st degree exceptions), worlds with rank 2 exceptions from those\nexceptions (2nd degree exceptions), etc. \nSpohn (2014) is the most recent and in-depth elaboration of his normal\nconditions based “epistemic account” of ceteris\nparibus laws and conditions.  \nSince the normal conditions “\\(N\\)” express the\nproposition that the given situation or world is normal, it would seem\nthat the ranking-of-worlds account entails the possibility of a strict\ncompletion by adding the normality condition \\(N\\) to the\nantecedent: “if \\(N\\), then \\(Y = f(X)\\)”. Indeed, it follows from the truth condition\nfor the assertion “normally (or cp) \\(L\\)” in a ranked\nworld model (where \\(L\\) is e.g., \\(Y = f(X))\\)\nthat there exists a proposition \\(N\\)—namely the set of all\nworlds with rank 0—such that “normally \\(L\\)” is\ntrue in the given ranked model iff the material implication\n\\(N\\rightarrow L\\) is true in all worlds of this model. This does\nneither imply, however, that (a) the completing proposition \\(N\\)\ncan be linguistically expressed, nor (b) that it can be expressed in a\nnon-trivial way, in the sense that \\(N\\) does not already imply\n\\(L\\) on logical reasons alone. Since one can only speak of a\nstrict completion of “normally \\(L\\)” if (a) and (b)\nhold, it follows that the ranking-of-worlds account does in fact not\nentail the possibility of a strict completion. This result is\nadequate, because as we have argued above, in most cases (especially\nin all non-deterministic situations) a strict completion is\nimpossible. Thus, it has to be kept in mind that speaking of\n“normality conditions” does not imply that these\n“normality conditions” can be expressed by any\n(non-trivial) proposition. For example, there is not any non-trivial\nproposition \\(N\\) which could turn the conditional “normally\na Cs\\(^{137}\\) atom decays after 60 years” into a strict\nimplication of the form “if \\(N\\), then a Cs\\(^{137}\\)\natom decays after 60 years”. Also note that the ranked-worlds\naccounts and the conditional probability accounts are equivalent as a\nsemantics for logical axiomatizations of conditional reasoning (see\nsection 8.3). \nReasoning from exclusive or normic cp-laws has an important logical\nfeature: the inferences are in contrast to deductively valid arguments\nnot monotonic. An inference is monotonic iff adding arbitrary\nnew premises to a valid argument preserves its validity. But the\ninference from an exclusive cp-law of the form “exclusively cp,\n\\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s” and a singular statement\n\\(A(d)\\) (for “\\(d\\) is an \\(A\\)”) to a\nconclusion \\(B(d)\\) is no longer correct if \\(d\\) is\nknown to instantiate a disturbing factor \\(D\\) which blocks the\nnomic connection between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). For instance, the\nexclusive cp-law may state that if something is a bird (\\(A\\)), then it\nnormally can fly (\\(B\\)), and \\(D\\) may assert that the given\nbird-instance has broken wings. \nAssume the exclusive cp-law is formulated with the help of a\nnon-strict conditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\). Drawing correct\ninferences from non-strict conditionals requires non-classical rules\nof valid inferences: The non-monotonicity of Default Modus\nPonens means formally that although the inference from\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and \\(A(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is\ncorrect (i.e., \\(A\\rightarrow B, A(d) \\dproves B(d)\\) holds, where ‘\\(\\dproves\\)’ stands for\n‘non-monotonically correct inference’), the inference from\nthe extended premise set \\(A\\rightarrow B,\nH\\rightarrow \\neg B, A(d)\\), and\n\\(H(d)\\) to \\(B(d)\\) is incorrect (i.e.,\n\\(A\\rightarrow B\\), A\\((d), H(d) \\dproves B(d))\\). These non-monotonic effects are reflected in\nnon-classical rules for inferences from conditionals to conditionals.\nFor example, take the inference from “If \\(A\\), then\n\\(B\\)” to “If \\(A\\wedge D\\), then\n\\(B\\)” (monotonicity \\(M)\\) or from “If \\(A\\),\nthen \\(B\\)” and “If \\(B\\), then \\(D\\)” to\n“If \\(A\\), then \\(D\\)” (Cut \\(C)\\). Both\ninferences are valid for strict (logical or material) conditionals,\nbut they are not generally correct for non-strict conditionals. Only\nthe more cautious inferences from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\wedge D\\rightarrow B\\)\n(cautious monotonicity CM) or from \\(A\\rightarrow B\\) and\n\\(A\\wedge B\\rightarrow D\\) to \\(A\\rightarrow D\\)\n(Cautious Cut CC) are correct for non-strict conditionals. \nTwo prominent semantic criteria for the truth of a non-strict\nconditional and the correctness of inference from non-strict\nconditionals have been suggested in the literature. \nRemarkably, both semantics lead to the same conditional logics. Both\nsemantics possess the system \\(P\\) (“preferential\nentailment”) as a correct and complete axiomatization of\ninferences among pure conditionals, and the system \\(R\\)\n(“rational entailment”) for inferences among\ntruth-function combinations of conditionals (for more details cf.\nKraus et al. 1990, Hawthorne 1996, Adams 1975, Schurz 1998,\n2004, 2005, Leitgeb 2004, and the SEP-entry on non-monotonic\nlogic). \nThe use of “cp” is not restricted to philosophy of\nscience. It is used in other areas of theoretical and practical\nphilosophy as well. \nFor instance, prima facie reasons are reasons under the\nconstraint of exclusive cp-conditions. They play an important role in\nethics and epistemology. \nIn ethics, a prima facie norm is an obligation (e.g.,\n“prima facie, you should not hurt anybody”) which\nholds as long as exceptional circumstances (e.g., defending your own\nlife) are absent (cf. Ross 1930 and the SEP-entry on moral reasoning).\nDancy (2004, 17, 35f) uses the expression “pro\ntanto” instead of “prima facie”, which\nis standardly used in the current debate. Pietroski (1993) has\npromoted the ceteris paribus understanding of moral\nobligations as a solution to paradoxes of moral obligations.\nEspecially for the solution of moral dilemmas, the cp-reading of moral\nobligations has proven to be helpful, because although two conflicting\ncp-obligations may block each other, they do not produce a strict\nconsistency in the sense of deductive logic (see Horty 1994). \nIn epistemology, a prima facie reason for a belief is a\nreason which justifies this belief in the absence of defeaters, i.e.,\nof exceptional information to the contrary. Prima facie\nreasons have been suggested in epistemology as a means of providing\nweak and defeasible a priori justifications for\nepistemologically fundamental beliefs such as the belief in the\nexistence of an external reality, for which a strict and non-circular\na priori-justification seems to be impossible. Nevertheless,\nthe inference from visual appearances to reality counts as defeasibly\njustified as long as there do not exist serious defeaters, i.e.,\nreasons for serious doubt (cf. Williams 1996, 2001, and the SEP-entry\non a priori-justification and knowledge). An example is the\ndefeasible inference from visual appearances to beliefs concerning\nexternal reality. My awareness of my visual appearance of a tree in\nfront of me is a prima facie reason for my belief that there\nreally is a tree in front of me, provided that information about\nexceptional circumstances is absent, for example the information that\nI am under the influence of drugs which cause hallucinations (cf.\nPollock 1986, Moser 2002). One may object that a similar kind of\npossible exception to the inference from visual appearances to reality\nis constituted by the possibility of a Cartesian demon who infuses\nhumans with illusionary perceptions, which is one of the major\nskeptical counterarguments to the inference from appearances to\nreality. In response to this objection, several epistemologists have\nargued that these kinds of exceptions are not serious exceptions, and\ntherefore, the inference from appearances to reality is defeasibly\nvalid. \nFinally, applications of cp-clauses can also be found in the form of\npresumptions in philosophy of language. Here it is assumed that\nunderstanding linguistic expressions requires defeasible assumptions\nor “presumptions”, for example presumptions concerning the\nrationality of the speaker (cf. Quine 1960; Davidson 1973, Scholz\n2016, 148–159). \nIn the current literature, a number of novel trends and innovative\napproaches to cp-laws have emerged that cannot easily be subsumed\nunder the already existing accounts. For this reason they deserve\nspecial mention. We believe there are at least four clearly\ndiscernable novel tendencies in the current work on cp-laws: \nA reconnection to metaphysics: One of the most salient trends\nin the current literature is that the discussion of cp-laws\n(re)connects philosophy of science to analytic metaphysics in at least\nthree respects: (i) current accounts of cp-laws make use of David\nLewis’s (1973) best system account of laws; moreover, (ii) the\ninterpretation of objective probabilities and (iii) the metaphysics of\ndispositions are brought into play for making progress in\nunderstanding cp-law statements.  \nThe most vivid sign of this reconnection consists in the fact that\nseveral authors have recently defended a friendly amendment of David\nLewis’s best system account of laws of nature. While\nLewis’s (1973, 73) original version primarily focuses on\nfundamental laws, the amended versions are intended to capture also\nnon-fundamental laws of the special sciences. Schrenk (2007a, 2014),\nCallender and Cohen (2009, 2010), and Frisch (2014a) defend a\nso-called “better best system” account of special science\nlaws. Unterhuber (2014) develops a version of the “better best\nsystem” account utilizing generics. Jaag and Loew (forthcoming)\nargue for a pragmatic version of the best systems account that\ncaptures also central insights of the “better best system”\ntheory. On their view, the universality of laws is not an end in\nitself. If a generalization’s invariance is, e.g., limited to\nour cosmic epoch only, this limited invariance arguably would be\nenough to make it useful for us and thus a law according to this\naccount. Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and Reutlinger (2014) provide\na critical discussion of “better best system” accounts.\nBraddon-Mitchell (2001) and Wheeler (2018) present versions of a best\nsystems account deploying the idea of algorithmic compression from\ndata science. Albert (2000, 2015) and Loewer (2009) advocate a\n“statistical mechanical” version of the best systems\napproach to special science laws which is, unlike the “better\nbest system” account, committed to a particular\nBoltzmann-inspired interpretation of statistical mechanics (including\nassumptions about the early history of the universe). Weslake (2014)\nand Frisch (2014b) provide critical responses, while Fenton-Glynn\n(2016) constructively uses examples by Albert and Loewer for an\nanalysis of cp-laws. Finally, Albert and Loewer’s account also\nconnects the debate on cp-laws with the on-going discussion on whether\ncausation has a place in fundamental physics or whether causation is\nan ‘emergent’ phenomenon captured by the cp-law statements\nof the special sciences (Price and Corry 2007 and Frisch 2014b are\nrepresentative of the opposing views in the debate on causation in\nphysics). \nAlso other metaphysical issues besides Lewis’s account of\nlawhood influence the recent literature on cp-laws. The metaphysics of\nprobabilities and disposition stand out in this respect. Taking up\nresults from Earman and Roberts (1999) and Schurz (2002), several\nauthors including Hüttemann and Reutlinger (2013), Kowalenko\n(2014), Roberts (2014), Reutlinger (2014), and Strevens (2014) discuss\nthe prospects of a statistical approach to cp-laws (or a\n“softness” approach, to use Strevens’s term),\naccording to which cp-laws are statistical claims. (Notice that the\nnormality account presented in section 8 above is but a special case\nof the broader statistical approach to cp-laws). \nA third metaphysical trend concerns the metaphysics of dispositions:\nAs we have explained in section 7 above, Hüttemann (2014) and\nPemberton and Cartwright (2014) argue in favor of a dispositionalist\naccount of cp-laws and provide responses to standard objections to the\ndispositionalist view (for instance, to objections voiced by Earman\nand Roberts 1999). \nDrawing on linguistics and philosophy of language: Several\nrecent approaches to cp-laws explicitly draw on research in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language. Taking into account linguistic\nwork on generics, Nickel (2010, 2014) argues that our understanding of\ncp-law statements is improved if one takes them to be generics and\nuses the formal semantics for generics to shed light on the meaning of\ncp-law statements (for approaches to cp-laws deploying generics, see\nalso Unterhuber and Schurz 2013; Unterhuber 2014; and Claveau und\nGirard 2019). Roberts (2014) makes contact with philosophy of language\nin analyzing cp-laws as vague and indexical statements about\nfrequencies. Ward (2007), Karbasizadeh (2008) and Nickel (2014)\nexplore the link between cp-laws and different accounts of natural\nkind terms. \nSensitivity to the sciences: Several philosophers have made\nan effort to draw attention to the fact that an adequate discussion of\nlaws has to be sensitive to the differences between distinct\nscientific disciplines. Their motivation is to provide a theory of\nlaws that fits generalizations (and models) in the life sciences, the\nsocial sciences and, more generally, the sciences of complex systems\n(for instance, see Mitchell 1997, 2002a,b; 2008, 2009; Sober 1997;\nSteel 2007; and Reiss 2008). In particular, Mitchell (2000), Strevens\n(2003, 2008), Craver (2007), Hüttemann (2007), Wimsatt (2007),\nTobin (2005), Woodward (2010) and Reutlinger (2011, 2013) distinguish\nvarious dimensions of characterizing how generalizations in these\nscientific disciplines may be non-universal or allow for exceptions.\nThese dimensions include stability, robustness, specificity, and\nhistorical contingency (see Reutlinger and Unterhuber 2014b for an\noverview). In a similar vein, Schurz (2014) introduces a novel\ndistinction between ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Fenton-Glynn (2016) holds that some higher-level\nlaws about the macro-behavior of complex systems (his central example\nis the second law of thermodynamics) are “minutis\nrectis” laws and should be distinguished from cp-laws,\nbecause their non-universal character stems from a probability\ndistribution over initial micro-conditions (see Strevens 2003 for\nfurther examples). Finally, motivated by examples from population\necology, earth science, and statistical mechanics, Strevens (2008) and\nWeisberg (2013) argue for a new interpretation of laws and models\ninvolving idealized assumptions, the minimalist account of\nidealizations. Strevens (2012, 2014) proposes treating cp-laws and\nidealized laws separately. What seems to emerge from this literature\nis that the ceteris paribus character of generalizations is\nmulti-faceted. There is a number of ways in which a generalization can\nbe non-universal: due to idealizations, by expressing statistical\nregularities and probability distributions over initial conditions, by\ndrawing on the notion of normality, by being sensitive to changes in\ninitial and background conditions, and so on (see Reutlinger and\nUnterhuber 2014b for a more detailed analysis). \nUsing scientific concepts and methods: recent philosophical\nattempts of capturing cp-laws increasingly involve importing key\nconcepts from the sciences and using these concepts for developing a\ngeneral theory of cp-laws. Inspired by classical mechanics, Maudlin\n(2007) and Hüttemann (2014) analyze cp-conditions in terms of\ndefault or inertial behavior. Both authors capture a violation of\ncp-conditions as a deviation from inertial behavior, where deviating\nfrom inertial behavior is itself a process governed by laws of\ndeviation (Maudlin) or laws of interaction and composition\n(Hüttemann). Other philosophers are influenced by the life\nsciences such as Nickel (2014), Pemberton and Cartwright (2014), and\nStrevens (2012, 2014) who rely on the concept of a mechanism in order\nto explicate the content of cp-conditions more generally. Kowalenko\n(2014) argues that cp-laws are best understood by drawing on methods\nfrom statistics, such as multivariate regression analysis (for a\ndiscussion of similar statistical approaches see Hüttemann and\nReutlinger 2013, Reutlinger 2014, Roberts 2014, and Strevens 2014).\nSchurz (2014) uses causal Bayesian networks as a formal framework for\na causal reconstruction of ceteris paribus and ceteris\nrectis laws. Finally, Jhun (2018) argues that focusing on the\nequilibrium methodology used in thermodynamics as well as in economic\nreasoning facilitates a new understanding of the explanatory role of\ncp-laws in terms of efficient performance.  \nWhere are the debates about cp-laws leading? What are the important\nchallenges to be met in future research? There are at least four main\nareas of productive future research: \nThese areas of research are, of course, not a complete list of future\nresearch topics. Nevertheless, it seems to us that these questions are\ninteresting enough to stimulate productive further research on\nceteris paribus laws. \nThe critical article by Earman and Roberts (1999) provides an\nexcellent introduction to the contemporary debate, because it\nreconstructs the most important theories of cp-laws and also points\nout the problems of these approaches. The volumes by Earman et\nal. (2002) and Reutlinger and Unterhuber (2014) contain a\nrepresentative collection of contemporary essays on the problem of\ncp-laws. \nPersky (1990), Blaug (1996) and Kaufer (1997) are accessible surveys\nof the history of cp-clauses and cp-laws. Notice that these articles\nfocus on economics and the social sciences. For a systematic\ndiscussion of laws in the social sciences, the debate between Kincaid\n(2004) and Roberts (2004) on whether there are laws in the social\nsciences is very instructive. \nThe important distinctions between (a) comparative and exclusive and\n(b) indefinite and definite cp-laws are established and argued for in\nSchurz (2002). \nThe dilemma of triviality or falsity is discussed in Lange (1993),\nwhich is also a helpful survey of the debate until 1993. \nConcerning completer accounts, Fodor (1991), Hausman (1992: chapter 8)\nand Pietroski and Rey (1995) are central papers. These accounts are\ncriticized by Earman and Roberts (1999), Schurz (2001a) and Woodward\n(2002). A more recent defense of completer accounts is Strevens\n(2012). \nConcerning stability accounts, Marc Lange develops his version in\nbook-length (see his 2000 and 2009a, although the focus of the latter\nis not on cp-laws). Lange (2002) is a very accessible paper on his\nview of cp-laws. Invariance accounts are best introduced in two joint\npapers by James Woodward and Christopher Hitchcock (see their EG1, EG2) and in Woodward’s book Making Things Happen (2003:\nchapter 6). Hall (2007) provides an insightful discussion of Woodward\n& Hitchcock’s invariance account.  \nFor dispositionalist approaches to cp-laws, Cartwright (1989) is a\nmodern classic (cf. her recent 2002, and Elgin and Sober 2002 for a\ncritique). Smith (2002), Mumford (2004), Bird (2005, 2007) and\nHüttemann (2007, 2014) develop different more recent\ndispositional accounts of cp-laws. \nConcerning normality approaches, Schurz (2001b, 2002) argues for a\nnormic laws approach. Spohn (2002) and Spohn (2012, chapter 13) are\ngood introductions to the normal conditions approach. See also Glymour\n(2002) for a formal approach to cp-laws. \nHumean better best system accounts of cp-laws are presented in Cohen\nand Callender (2009, 2010), Schrenk (2007a, 2014), and Unterhuber\n(2014). Wheeler (2018: chapter 3.2) gives an accessible brief\nexposition of various versions; and Reutlinger (2009) and Backmann and\nReutlinger (2014) provide a critical discussion.  \nThere are also various approaches in the current debate that cannot\neasily be classified: Mitchell (1997, 2002a, b; 2008, 2009), Sober\n1997, Steel (2007, chapter 6) and Reiss (2008) attempt to explicate a\ntheory of laws that fits scientific practice in biology, the social\nsciences and generalization describing complex systems. Further,\nMitchell (2000), Craver (2007), Tobin (2005) and Reutlinger (2011)\ndistinguish various dimensions of the non-universality of (cp-)laws in\norder to argue for an explication of laws in the special sciences.\nKarbasizadeh (2008) links the debates on cp-laws and natural kinds.\nLadyman and Ross (2007, chapters 4 and 5), Kincaid (2008), Ross\n(2008), and Ladyman (2008) argue for ontic structural realism as a\nmetaphysics of generalizations in the social sciences (and for the\nspecial sciences in general). Finally, Maudlin (2007, chapter 5)\nadvocates an explication of laws in the special sciences that is based\non the notion of quasi-Newtonian laws.","contact.mail":"siegfried.jaag@hhu.de","contact.domain":"hhu.de"}]
