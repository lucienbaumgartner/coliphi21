Philosophers use a number of terms to refer to such value. The\nintrinsic value of something is said to be the value that that thing\nhas “in itself,” or “for its own sake,” or\n“as such,” or “in its own right.” Extrinsic\nvalue is value that is not intrinsic.\n\n\nMany philosophers take intrinsic value to be crucial to a variety of\nmoral judgments. For example, according to a fundamental form of\nconsequentialism, whether an action is morally right or wrong\nhas exclusively to do with whether its consequences are intrinsically\nbetter than those of any other action one can perform under the\ncircumstances. Many other theories also hold that what it is right or\nwrong to do has at least in part to do with the intrinsic value of the\nconsequences of the actions one can perform. Moreover, if, as is\ncommonly believed, what one is morally responsible for doing\nis some function of the rightness or wrongness of what one does, then\nintrinsic value would seem relevant to judgments about responsibility,\ntoo. Intrinsic value is also often taken to be pertinent to judgments\nabout moral justice (whether having to do with moral rights\nor moral desert), insofar as it is good that justice is done and bad\nthat justice is denied, in ways that appear intimately tied to\nintrinsic value. Finally, it is typically thought that judgments about\nmoral virtue and vice also turn on questions of intrinsic\nvalue, inasmuch as virtues are good, and vices bad, again in ways that\nappear closely connected to such value.\n\n\nAll four types of moral judgments have been the subject of discussion\nsince the dawn of western philosophy in ancient Greece. The Greeks\nthemselves were especially concerned with questions about virtue and\nvice, and the concept of intrinsic value may be found at work in their\nwritings and in the writings of moral philosophers ever since. Despite\nthis fact, and rather surprisingly, it is only within the last one\nhundred years or so that this concept has itself been the subject of\nsustained scrutiny, and even within this relatively brief period the\nscrutiny has waxed and waned.\n\nThe question “What is intrinsic value?” is more\nfundamental than the question “What has intrinsic value?,”\nbut historically these have been treated in reverse order. For a long\ntime, philosophers appear to have thought that the notion of intrinsic\nvalue is itself sufficiently clear to allow them to go straight to the\nquestion of what should be said to have intrinsic value. Not even a\npotted history of what has been said on this matter can be attempted\nhere, since the record is so rich. Rather, a few representative\nillustrations must suffice. \nIn his dialogue Protagoras, Plato [428–347 B.C.E.]\nmaintains (through the character of Socrates, modeled after the real\nSocrates [470–399 B.C.E.], who was Plato’s teacher) that,\nwhen people condemn pleasure, they do so, not because they take\npleasure to be bad as such, but because of the bad consequences they\nfind pleasure often to have. For example, at one point Socrates says\nthat the only reason why the pleasures of food and drink and sex seem\nto be evil is that they result in pain and deprive us of future\npleasures (Plato, Protagoras, 353e). He concludes that\npleasure is in fact good as such and pain bad, regardless of what\ntheir consequences may on occasion be. In the Timaeus, Plato\nseems quite pessimistic about these consequences, for he has Timaeus\ndeclare pleasure to be “the greatest incitement to evil”\nand pain to be something that “deters from good” (Plato,\nTimaeus, 69d). Plato does not think of pleasure as the\n“highest” good, however. In the Republic,\nSocrates states that there can be no “communion” between\n“extravagant” pleasure and virtue (Plato,\nRepublic, 402e) and in the Philebus, where Philebus\nargues that pleasure is the highest good, Socrates argues against\nthis, claiming that pleasure is better when accompanied by\nintelligence (Plato, Philebus, 60e). \nMany philosophers have followed Plato’s lead in declaring\npleasure intrinsically good and pain intrinsically bad. Aristotle\n[384–322 B.C.E.], for example, himself a student of\nPlato’s, says at one point that all are agreed that pain is bad\nand to be avoided, either because it is bad “without\nqualification” or because it is in some way an\n“impediment” to us; he adds that pleasure, being the\n“contrary” of that which is to be avoided, is therefore\nnecessarily a good (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1153b).\nOver the course of the more than two thousand years since this was\nwritten, this view has been frequently endorsed. Like Plato, Aristotle\ndoes not take pleasure and pain to be the only things that are\nintrinsically good and bad, although some have maintained that this is\nindeed the case. This more restrictive view, often called hedonism,\nhas had proponents since the time of Epicurus [341–271\n B.C.E.].[1]\n Perhaps the most thorough renditions of it are to be found in the\nworks of Jeremy Bentham [1748–1832] and Henry Sidgwick\n[1838–1900] (see Bentham 1789, Sidgwick 1907); perhaps its most\nfamous proponent is John Stuart Mill [1806–1873] (see Mill\n1863). \nMost philosophers who have written on the question of what has\nintrinsic value have not been hedonists; like Plato and Aristotle,\nthey have thought that something besides pleasure and pain has\nintrinsic value. One of the most comprehensive lists of intrinsic\ngoods that anyone has suggested is that given by William Frankena\n(Frankena 1973, pp. 87–88): life, consciousness, and activity;\nhealth and strength; pleasures and satisfactions of all or certain\nkinds; happiness, beatitude, contentment, etc.; truth; knowledge and\ntrue opinions of various kinds, understanding, wisdom; beauty,\nharmony, proportion in objects contemplated; aesthetic experience;\nmorally good dispositions or virtues; mutual affection, love,\nfriendship, cooperation; just distribution of goods and evils; harmony\nand proportion in one’s own life; power and experiences of\nachievement; self-expression; freedom; peace, security; adventure and\nnovelty; and good reputation, honor, esteem, etc. (Presumably a\ncorresponding list of intrinsic evils could be provided.) Almost any\nphilosopher who has ever addressed the question of what has intrinsic\nvalue will find his or her answer represented in some way by one or\nmore items on Frankena’s list. (Frankena himself notes that he\ndoes not explicitly include in his list the communion with and love\nand knowledge of God that certain philosophers believe to be the\nhighest good, since he takes them to fall under the headings of\n“knowledge” and “love.”) One conspicuous\nomission from the list, however, is the increasingly popular view that\ncertain environmental entities or qualities have intrinsic value\n(although Frankena may again assert that these are implicitly\nrepresented by one or more items already on the list). Some find\nintrinsic value, for example, in certain “natural”\nenvironments (wildernesses untouched by human hand); some find it in\ncertain animal species; and so on. \nSuppose that you were confronted with some proposed list of intrinsic\ngoods. It would be natural to ask how you might assess the accuracy of\nthe list. How can you tell whether something has intrinsic value or\nnot? On one level, this is an epistemological question about which\nthis article will not be concerned. (See the entry in this\nencyclopedia on moral epistemology.) On another level, however, this\nis a conceptual question, for we cannot be sure that something has\nintrinsic value unless we understand what it is for something to have\nintrinsic value. \nThe concept of intrinsic value has been characterized above in terms\nof the value that something has “in itself,” or “for\nits own sake,” or “as such,” or “in its own\nright.” The custom has been not to distinguish between the\nmeanings of these terms, but we will see that there is reason to think\nthat there may in fact be more than one concept at issue here. For the\nmoment, though, let us ignore this complication and focus on what it\nmeans to say that something is valuable for its own sake as\nopposed to being valuable for the sake of something else to\nwhich it is related in some way. Perhaps it is easiest to grasp this\ndistinction by way of illustration. \nSuppose that someone were to ask you whether it is good to help others\nin time of need. Unless you suspected some sort of trick, you would\nanswer, “Yes, of course.” If this person were to go on to\nask you why acting in this way is good, you might say that it is good\nto help others in time of need simply because it is good that their\nneeds be satisfied. If you were then asked why it is good that\npeople’s needs be satisfied, you might be puzzled. You might be\ninclined to say, “It just is.” Or you might accept the\nlegitimacy of the question and say that it is good that people’s\nneeds be satisfied because this brings them pleasure. But then, of\ncourse, your interlocutor could ask once again, “What’s\ngood about that?” Perhaps at this point you would answer,\n“It just is good that people be pleased,” and thus put an\nend to this line of questioning. Or perhaps you would again seek to\nexplain the fact that it is good that people be pleased in terms of\nsomething else that you take to be good. At some point, though, you\nwould have to put an end to the questions, not because you would have\ngrown tired of them (though that is a distinct possibility), but\nbecause you would be forced to recognize that, if one thing derives\nits goodness from some other thing, which derives its goodness from\nyet a third thing, and so on, there must come a point at which you\nreach something whose goodness is not derivative in this way,\nsomething that “just is” good in its own right, something\nwhose goodness is the source of, and thus explains, the goodness to be\nfound in all the other things that precede it on the list. It is at\nthis point that you will have arrived at intrinsic goodness (cf.\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1094a). That which is\nintrinsically good is nonderivatively good; it is good for its\nown sake. That which is not intrinsically good but\nextrinsically good is derivatively good; it is good, not (insofar as\nits extrinsic value is concerned) for its own sake, but for the sake\nof something else that is good and to which it is related in some way.\nIntrinsic value thus has a certain priority over extrinsic value. The\nlatter is derivative from or reflective of the former and is to be\nexplained in terms of the former. It is for this reason that\nphilosophers have tended to focus on intrinsic value in\nparticular. \nThe account just given of the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic value is rough, but it should do as a start. Certain\ncomplications must be immediately acknowledged, though. First, there\nis the possibility, mentioned above, that the terms traditionally used\nto refer to intrinsic value in fact refer to more than one concept;\nagain, this will be addressed later (in this section and the next).\nAnother complication is that it may not in fact be accurate to say\nthat whatever is intrinsically good is nonderivatively good; some\nintrinsic value may be derivative. This issue will be taken up (in\nSection 5) when the computation of intrinsic value is discussed; it\nmay be safely ignored for now. Still another complication is this. It\nis almost universally acknowledged among philosophers that all value\nis “supervenient” or “grounded in” on certain\nnonevaluative features of the thing that has value. Roughly, what this\nmeans is that, if something has value, it will have this value in\nvirtue of certain nonevaluative features that it has; its value can be\nattributed to these features.  For example, the value of helping\nothers in time of need might be attributed to the fact that such\nbehavior has the feature of being causally related to certain pleasant\nexperiences induced in those who receive the help. Suppose we accept\nthis and accept also that the experiences in question are\nintrinsically good. In saying this, we are (barring the complication\nto be discussed in Section 5) taking the value of the experiences to\nbe nonderivative. Nonetheless, we may well take this value, like all\nvalue, to be supervenient on, or grounded in, something. In this case,\nwe would probably simply attribute the value of the experiences to\ntheir having the feature of being pleasant. This brings out the subtle\nbut important point that the question whether some value is derivative\nis distinct from the question whether it is supervenient. Even\nnonderivative value (value that something has in its own right; value\nthat is, in some way, not attributable to the value of\nanything else) is usually understood to be supervenient on certain\nnonevaluative features of the thing that has value (and thus to be\nattributable, in a different way, to these features). \nTo repeat: whatever is intrinsically good is (barring the complication\nto be discussed in Section 5) nonderivatively good. It would be a\nmistake, however, to affirm the converse of this and say that whatever\nis nonderivatively good is intrinsically good. As “intrinsic\nvalue” is traditionally understood, it refers to a\nparticular way of being nonderivatively good; there are other\nways in which something might be nonderivatively good. For example,\nsuppose that your interlocutor were to ask you whether it is good to\neat and drink in moderation and to exercise regularly. Again, you\nwould say, “Yes, of course.” If asked why, you would say\nthat this is because such behavior promotes health. If asked what is\ngood about being healthy, you might cite something else whose goodness\nwould explain the value of health, or you might simply say,\n“Being healthy just is a good way to be.” If the latter\nwere your response, you would be indicating that you took health to be\nnonderivatively good in some way. In what way, though? Well, perhaps\nyou would be thinking of health as intrinsically good. But perhaps\nnot. Suppose that what you meant was that being healthy just is\n“good for” the person who is healthy (in the sense that it\nis in each person’s interest to be healthy), so that\nJohn’s being healthy is good for John, Jane’s being\nhealthy is good for Jane, and so on. You would thereby be attributing\na type of nonderivative interest-value to John’s being healthy,\nand yet it would be perfectly consistent for you to deny that\nJohn’s being healthy is intrinsically good. If John\nwere a villain, you might well deny this. Indeed, you might want to\ninsist that, in light of his villainy, his being healthy is\nintrinsically bad, even though you recognize that his being\nhealthy is good for him. If you did say this, you would be\nindicating that you subscribe to the common view that intrinsic value\nis nonderivative value of some peculiarly moral\n sort.[2] \nLet us now see whether this still rough account of intrinsic value can\nbe made more precise. One of the first writers to concern himself with\nthe question of what exactly is at issue when we ascribe intrinsic\nvalue to something was G. E. Moore [1873–1958]. In his book\nPrincipia Ethica, Moore asks whether the concept of intrinsic\nvalue (or, more particularly, the concept of intrinsic goodness, upon\nwhich he tended to focus) is analyzable. In raising this question, he\nhas a particular type of analysis in mind, one which consists in\n“breaking down” a concept into simpler component concepts.\n(One example of an analysis of this sort is the analysis of the\nconcept of being a vixen in terms of the concepts of being a fox and\nbeing female.) His own answer to the question is that the concept of\nintrinsic goodness is not amenable to such analysis (Moore\n1903, ch. 1). In place of analysis, Moore proposes a certain kind of\nthought-experiment in order both to come to understand the concept\nbetter and to reach a decision about what is intrinsically good. He\nadvises us to consider what things are such that, if they existed by\nthemselves “in absolute isolation,” we would judge their\nexistence to be good; in this way, we will be better able to see what\nreally accounts for the value that there is in our world. For example,\nif such a thought-experiment led you to conclude that all and only\npleasure would be good in isolation, and all and only pain bad, you\nwould be a\n hedonist.[3]\n Moore himself deems it incredible that anyone, thinking clearly,\nwould reach this conclusion. He says that it involves our saying that\na world in which only pleasure existed—a world without any\nknowledge, love, enjoyment of beauty, or moral qualities—is\nbetter than a world that contained all these things but in which there\nexisted slightly less pleasure (Moore 1912, p. 102). Such a view he\nfinds absurd. \nRegardless of the merits of this isolation test, it remains unclear\nexactly why Moore finds the concept of intrinsic goodness to be\nunanalyzable. At one point he attacks the view that it can be analyzed\nwholly in terms of “natural” concepts—the view, that\nis, that we can break down the concept of being intrinsically good\ninto the simpler concepts of being A, being B, being\nC…, where these component concepts are all purely\ndescriptive rather than evaluative. (One candidate that Moore\ndiscusses is this: for something to be intrinsically good is for it to\nbe something that we desire to desire.) He argues that any such\nanalysis is to be rejected, since it will always be intelligible to\nask whether (and, presumably, to deny that) it is good that something\nbe A, B, C,…, which would not be the\ncase if the analysis were accurate (Moore 1903, pp. 15–16). Even\nif this argument is successful (a complicated matter about which there\nis considerable disagreement), it of course does not establish the\nmore general claim that the concept of intrinsic goodness is not\nanalyzable at all, since it leaves open the possibility that this\nconcept is analyzable in terms of other concepts, some or all of which\nare not “natural” but evaluative. Moore apparently thinks\nthat his objection works just as well where one or more of the\ncomponent concepts A, B, C,…, is\nevaluative; but, again, many dispute the cogency of his argument.\nIndeed, several philosophers have proposed analyses of just this sort.\nFor example, Roderick Chisholm [1916–1999] has argued that\nMoore’s own isolation test in fact provides the basis for an\nanalysis of the concept of intrinsic value. He formulates a view\naccording to which (to put matters roughly) to say that a state of\naffairs is intrinsically good or bad is to say that it is possible\nthat its goodness or badness constitutes all the goodness or badness\nthat there is in the world (Chisholm 1978).  \nEva Bodanszky and Earl Conee have attacked Chisholm’s proposal,\nshowing that it is, in its details, unacceptable (Bodanszky and Conee\n1981). However, the general idea that an intrinsically valuable state\nis one that could somehow account for all the value in the world is\nsuggestive and promising; if it could be adequately formulated, it\nwould reveal an important feature of intrinsic value that would help\nus better understand the concept. We will return to this point in\nSection 5. Rather than pursue such a line of thought, Chisholm himself\nresponded (Chisholm 1981) in a different way to Bodanszky and Conee.\nHe shifted from what may be called an ontological version of\nMoore’s isolation test—the attempt to understand the\nintrinsic value of a state in terms of the value that there would be\nif it were the only valuable state in existence—to an\nintentional version of that test—the attempt to\nunderstand the intrinsic value of a state in terms of the kind of\nattitude it would be fitting to have if one were to\ncontemplate the valuable state as such, without reference to\ncircumstances or consequences. \nThis new analysis in fact reflects a general idea that has a rich\nhistory. Franz Brentano [1838–1917], C. D. Broad\n[1887–1971], W. D. Ross [1877–1971], and A. C. Ewing\n[1899–1973], among others, have claimed, in a more or less\nqualified way, that the concept of intrinsic goodness is analyzable in\nterms of the fittingness of some “pro” (i.e., positive)\nattitude (Brentano 1969, p. 18; Broad 1930, p. 283; Ross 1939, pp.\n275–76; Ewing 1948, p. 152). Such an analysis, which has come to\nbe called “the fitting attitude analysis” of value, is\nsupported by the mundane observation that, instead of saying that\nsomething is good, we often say that it is valuable, which\nitself just means that it is fitting to value the thing in question.\nIt would thus seem very natural to suppose that for something to be\nintrinsically good is simply for it to be such that it is fitting to\nvalue it for its own sake. (“Fitting” here is often\nunderstood to signify a particular kind of moral fittingness, in\nkeeping with the idea that intrinsic value is a particular kind of\nmoral value. The underlying point is that those who value for its own\nsake that which is intrinsically good thereby evince a kind of\nmoral sensitivity.) \nThough undoubtedly attractive, this analysis can be and has been\nchallenged. Brand Blanshard [1892–1987], for example, argues\nthat the analysis is to be rejected because, if we ask why\nsomething is such that it is fitting to value it for its own sake, the\nanswer is that this is the case precisely because the thing\nin question is intrinsically good; this answer indicates that the\nconcept of intrinsic goodness is more fundamental than that of the\nfittingness of some pro attitude, which is inconsistent with analyzing\nthe former in terms of the latter (Blanshard 1961, pp. 284–86).\nEwing and others have resisted Blanshard’s argument, maintaining\nthat what grounds and explains something’s being valuable is not\nits being good but rather its having whatever non-value property it is\nupon which its goodness supervenes; they claim that it is because of\nthis underlying property that the thing in question is\n“both” good and valuable (Ewing 1948, pp. 157 and 172. Cf.\nLemos 1994, p. 19). Thomas Scanlon calls such an account of the\nrelation between valuableness, goodness, and underlying properties a\nbuck-passing account, since it “passes the buck” of\nexplaining why something is such that it is fitting to value it from\nits goodness to some property that underlies its goodness (Scanlon\n1998, pp. 95 ff.). Whether such an account is acceptable has recently\nbeen the subject of intense debate. Many, like Scanlon, endorse\npassing the buck; some, like Blanshard, object to doing so. If such an\naccount is acceptable, then Ewing’s analysis survives\nBlanshard’s challenge; but otherwise not. (Note that one might\nendorse passing the buck and yet reject Ewing’s analysis for\nsome other reason. Hence a buck-passer may, but need not, accept the\nanalysis. Indeed, there is reason to think that Moore himself is a\nbuck-passer, even though he takes the concept of intrinsic goodness to\nbe unanalyzable; cf. Olson 2006). \nEven if Blanshard’s argument succeeds and intrinsic goodness is\nnot to be analyzed in terms of the fittingness of some pro\nattitude, it could still be that there is a strict\ncorrelation between something’s being intrinsically good\nand its being such that it is fitting to value it for its own sake;\nthat is, it could still be both that (a) it is necessarily true that\nwhatever is intrinsically good is such that it is fitting to value it\nfor its own sake, and that (b) it is necessarily true that whatever it\nis fitting to value for its own sake is intrinsically good. If this\nwere the case, it would reveal an important feature of intrinsic\nvalue, recognition of which would help us to improve our understanding\nof the concept. However, this thesis has also been challenged. \nKrister Bykvist has argued that what he calls solitary goods may\nconstitute a counterexample to part (a) of the thesis (Bykvist 2009,\npp. 4 ff.). Such (alleged) goods consist in states of affairs that\nentail that there is no one in a position to value them. Suppose, for\nexample, that happiness is intrinsically good, and good in such a way\nthat it is fitting to welcome it. Then, more particularly, the state\nof affairs of there being happy egrets is intrinsically good; so too,\npresumably, is the more complex state of affairs of there being happy\negrets but no welcomers. The simpler state of affairs would appear to\npose no problem for part (a) of the thesis, but the more complex state\nof affairs, which is an example of a solitary good, may pose a\nproblem. For if to welcome a state of affairs entails that that state\nof affairs obtains, then welcoming the more complex state of affairs\nis logically impossible. Furthermore, if to welcome a state of affairs\nentails that one believes that that state of affairs obtains, then the\npertinent belief regarding the more complex state of affairs would be\nnecessarily false. In neither case would it seem plausible to say that\nwelcoming the state of affairs is nonetheless fitting. Thus, unless\nthis challenge can somehow be met, a proponent of the thesis must\nrestrict the thesis to pro attitudes that are neither truth- nor\nbelief-entailing, a restriction that might itself prove unwelcome,\nsince it excludes a number of favorable responses to what is good\n(such as promoting what is good, or taking pleasure in what is good)\nto which proponents of the thesis have often appealed. \nAs to part (b) of the thesis: some philosophers have argued that it\ncan be fitting to value something for its own sake even if that thing\nis not intrinsically good. A relatively early version of this argument\nwas again provided by Blanshard (1961, pp. 287 ff. Cf. Lemos 1994, p.\n18). Recently the issue has been brought into stark relief by the\nfollowing sort of thought-experiment. Imagine that an evil demon wants\nyou to value him for his own sake and threatens to cause you severe\nsuffering unless you do. It seems that you have good reason to do what\nhe wants—it is appropriate or fitting to comply with his demand\nand value him for his own sake—even though he is clearly not\nintrinsically good (Rabinowicz and Rønnow-Rasmussen 2004, pp.\n402 ff.). This issue, which has come to be known as “the wrong\nkind of reason problem,” has attracted a great deal of\nattention. Some have been persuaded that the challenge succeeds, while\nothers have sought to undermine it. \nOne final cautionary note. It is apparent that some philosophers use\nthe term “intrinsic value” and similar terms to express\nsome concept other than the one just discussed. In particular,\nImmanuel Kant [1724–1804] is famous for saying that the only\nthing that is “good without qualification” is a good will,\nwhich is good not because of what it effects or accomplishes but\n“in itself” (Kant 1785, Ak. 1–3). This may seem to\nsuggest that Kant ascribes (positive) intrinsic value only to a good\nwill, declaring the value that anything else may possess merely\nextrinsic, in the senses of “intrinsic value” and\n“extrinsic value” discussed above. This suggestion is, if\nanything, reinforced when Kant immediately adds that a good will\n“is to be esteemed beyond comparison as far higher than anything\nit could ever bring about,” that it “shine[s] like a jewel\nfor its own sake,” and that its “usefulness…can\nneither add to, nor subtract from, [its] value.” For here Kant\nmay seem not only to be invoking the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic value but also to be in agreement with Brentano et\nal. regarding the characterization of the former in terms of the\nfittingness of some attitude, namely, esteem. (The term\n“respect” is often used in place of “esteem”\nin such contexts.) Nonetheless, it becomes clear on further inspection\nthat Kant is in fact discussing a concept quite different from that\nwith which this article is concerned. A little later on he says that\nall rational beings, even those that lack a good will, have\n“absolute value”; such beings are “ends in\nthemselves” that have a “dignity” or\n“intrinsic value” that is “above all price”\n(Kant 1785, Ak. 64 and 77). Such talk indicates that Kant believes\nthat the sort of value that he ascribes to rational beings is one that\nthey possess to an infinite degree. But then, if this were understood\nas a thesis about intrinsic value as we have been understanding this\nconcept, the implication would seem to be that, since it contains\nrational beings, ours is the best of all possible\n worlds.[4]\n Yet this is a thesis that Kant, along with many others, explicitly\nrejects elsewhere (Kant, Lectures in Ethics). It seems best\nto understand Kant, and other philosophers who have since written in\nthe same vein (cf. Anderson 1993), as being concerned not with the\nquestion of what intrinsic value rational beings have—in the\nsense of “intrinsic value” discussed above—but with\nthe quite different question of how we ought to behave toward such\ncreatures (cf. Bradley 2006). \nIn the history of philosophy, relatively few seem to have entertained\ndoubts about the concept of intrinsic value. Much of the debate about\nintrinsic value has tended to be about what things actually do have\nsuch value. However, once questions about the concept itself were\nraised, doubts about its metaphysical implications, its moral\nsignificance, and even its very coherence began to appear. \nConsider, first, the metaphysics underlying ascriptions of intrinsic\nvalue. It seems safe to say that, before the twentieth century, most\nmoral philosophers presupposed that the intrinsic goodness of\nsomething is a genuine property of that thing, one that is no less\nreal than the properties (of being pleasant, of satisfying a need, or\nwhatever) in virtue of which the thing in question is good. (Several\ndissented from this view, however. Especially well known for their\ndissent are Thomas Hobbes [1588–1679], who believed the goodness\nor badness of something to be constituted by the desire or aversion\nthat one may have regarding it, and David Hume [1711–1776], who\nsimilarly took all ascriptions of value to involve projections of\none’s own sentiments onto whatever is said to have value. See\nHobbes 1651, Hume 1739.) It was not until Moore argued that this view\nimplies that intrinsic goodness, as a supervening property, is a very\ndifferent sort of property (one that he called\n“nonnatural”) from those (which he called\n“natural”) upon which it supervenes, that doubts about the\nview proliferated. \nOne of the first to raise such doubts and to press for a view quite\ndifferent from the prevailing view was Axel Hägerström\n[1868–1939], who developed an account according to which\nascriptions of value are neither true nor false (Hägerström\n1953). This view has come to be called “noncognitivism.”\nThe particular brand of noncognitivism proposed by\nHägerström is usually called “emotivism,” since\nit holds (in a manner reminiscent of Hume) that ascriptions of value\nare in essence expressions of emotion. (For example, an emotivist of a\nparticularly simple kind might claim that to say “A is\ngood” is not to make a statement about A but to say\nsomething like “Hooray for A!”) This view was\ntaken up by several philosophers, including most notably A. J. Ayer\n[1910–1989] and Charles L. Stevenson [1908–1979] (see Ayer\n1946, Stevenson 1944). Other philosophers have since embraced other\nforms of noncognitivism. R. M. Hare [1919–2002], for example,\nadvocated the theory of “prescriptivism” (according to\nwhich moral judgments, including judgments about goodness and badness,\nare not descriptive statements about the world but rather constitute a\nkind of command as to how we are to act; see Hare 1952) and Simon\nBlackburn and Allan Gibbard have since proposed yet other versions of\nnoncognitivism (Blackburn 1984, Gibbard 1990). \nHägerström characterized his own view as a type of\n“value-nihilism,” and many have followed suit in taking\nnoncognitivism of all kinds to constitute a rejection of the very idea\nof intrinsic value. But this seems to be a mistake. We should\ndistinguish questions about value from questions about\nevaluation. Questions about value fall into two main groups,\nconceptual (of the sort discussed in the last section) and\nsubstantive (of the sort discussed in the first section).\nQuestions about evaluation have to do with what precisely is going on\nwhen we ascribe value to something. Cognitivists claim that\nour ascriptions of value constitute statements that are either true or\nfalse; noncognitivists deny this. But even noncognitivists must\nrecognize that our ascriptions of value fall into two fundamental\nclasses—ascriptions of intrinsic value and ascriptions of\nextrinsic value—and so they too must concern themselves with the\nvery same conceptual and substantive questions about value as\ncognitivists address. It may be that noncognitivism dictates or rules\nout certain answers to these questions that cognitivism does not, but\nthat is of course quite a different matter from rejecting the very\nidea of intrinsic value on metaphysical grounds. \nAnother type of metaphysical challenge to intrinsic value stems from\nthe theory of “pragmatism,” especially in the form\nadvanced by John Dewey [1859–1952] (see Dewey 1922). According\nto the pragmatist, the world is constantly changing in such a way that\nthe solution to one problem becomes the source of another, what is an\nend in one context is a means in another, and thus it is a mistake to\nseek or offer a timeless list of intrinsic goods and evils, of ends to\nbe achieved or avoided for their own sakes. This theme has been\nelaborated by Monroe Beardsley, who attacks the very notion of\nintrinsic value (Beardsley 1965; cf. Conee 1982). Denying that the\nexistence of something with extrinsic value presupposes the existence\nof something else with intrinsic value, Beardsley argues that all\nvalue is extrinsic. (In the course of his argument, Beardsley rejects\nthe sort of “dialectical demonstration” of intrinsic value\nthat was attempted in the last section, when an explanation of the\nderivative value of helping others was given in terms of some\nnonderivative value.) A quick response to Beardsley’s misgivings\nabout intrinsic value would be to admit that it may well be that, the\nworld being as complex as it is, nothing is such that its value is\nwholly intrinsic; perhaps whatever has intrinsic value also has\nextrinsic value, and of course many things that have extrinsic value\nwill have no (or, at least, neutral) intrinsic value. Far from\nrepudiating the notion of intrinsic value, though, this admission\nwould confirm its legitimacy. But Beardsley would insist that this\nquick response misses the point of his attack, and that it really is\nthe case, not just that whatever has value has extrinsic value, but\nalso that nothing has intrinsic value. His argument for this view is\nbased on the claim that the concept of intrinsic value is\n“inapplicable,” in that, even if something had such value,\nwe could not know this and hence its having such value could play no\nrole in our reasoning about value. But here Beardsley seems to be\noverreaching. Even if it were the case that we cannot know\nwhether something has intrinsic value, this of course leaves open the\nquestion whether anything does have such value. And even if\nit could somehow be shown that nothing does have such value,\nthis would still leave open the question whether something\ncould have such value. If the answer to this last question is\n“yes,” then the legitimacy of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue is in fact confirmed rather than refuted. \nAs has been noted, some philosophers do indeed doubt the legitimacy,\nthe very coherence, of the concept of intrinsic value. Before we turn\nto a discussion of this issue, however, let us for the moment presume\nthat the concept is coherent and address a different sort of doubt:\nthe doubt that the concept has any great moral significance. Recall\nthe suggestion, mentioned in the last section, that discussions of\nintrinsic value may have been compromised by a failure to distinguish\ncertain concepts. This suggestion is at the heart of Christine\nKorsgaard’s “Two Distinctions in Goodness”\n(Korsgaard 1983). Korsgaard notes that “intrinsic value”\nhas traditionally been contrasted with “instrumental\nvalue” (the value that something has in virtue of being a means\nto an end) and claims that this approach is misleading. She contends\nthat “instrumental value” is to be contrasted with\n“final value,” that is, the value that something has as an\nend or for its own sake; however, “intrinsic value” (the\nvalue that something has in itself, that is, in virtue of its\nintrinsic, nonrelational properties) is to be contrasted with\n“extrinsic value” (the value that something has in virtue\nof its extrinsic, relational properties). (An example of a\nnonrelational property is the property of being round; an example of a\nrelational property is the property of being loved.) As an\nillustration of final value, Korsgaard suggests that gorgeously\nenameled frying pans are, in virtue of the role they play in our\nlives, good for their own sakes. In like fashion, Beardsley wonders\nwhether a rare stamp may be good for its own sake (Beardsley 1965);\nShelly Kagan says that the pen that Abraham Lincoln used to sign the\nEmancipation Proclamation may well be good for its own sake (Kagan\n1998); and others have offered similar examples (cf. Rabinowicz and\nRønnow-Rasmussen 1999 and 2003). Notice that in each case the\nvalue being attributed to the object in question is (allegedly) had in\nvirtue of some extrinsic property of the object. This puts\nthe moral significance of intrinsic value into question,\nsince (as is apparent from our discussion so far) it is with the\nnotion of something’s being valuable for its own sake that\nphilosophers have traditionally been, and continue to be, primarily\nconcerned. \nThere is an important corollary to drawing a distinction between\nintrinsic value and final value (and between extrinsic value and\nnonfinal value), and that is that, contrary to what Korsgaard herself\ninitially says, it may be a mistake to contrast final value with\ninstrumental value. If it is possible, as Korsgaard claims, that final\nvalue sometimes supervenes on extrinsic properties, then it might be\npossible that it sometimes supervenes in particular on the property of\nbeing a means to some other end. Indeed, Korsgaard herself suggests\nthis when she says that “certain kinds of things, such as\nluxurious instruments, … are valued for their own sakes under\nthe condition of their usefulness” (Korsgaard 1983, p. 185).\nKagan also tentatively endorses this idea. If the idea is coherent,\nthen we should in principle distinguish two kinds of instrumental\nvalue, one final and the other\n nonfinal.[5]\n If something A is a means to something else B and\nhas instrumental value in virtue of this fact, such value will be\nnonfinal if it is merely derivative from or reflective of\nB’s value, whereas it will be final if it is\nnonderivative, that is, if it is a value that A has in its\nown right (due to the fact that it is a means to B),\nirrespective of any value that B may or may not have in\nits own right. \nEven if it is agreed that it is final value that is central to the\nconcerns of moral philosophers, we should be careful in drawing the\nconclusion that intrinsic value is not central to their concerns.\nFirst, there is no necessity that the term “intrinsic\nvalue” be reserved for the value that something has in virtue of\nits intrinsic properties; presumably it has been used by many writers\nsimply to refer to what Korsgaard calls final value, in which case the\nmoral significance of (what is thus called) intrinsic value has of\ncourse not been thrown into doubt. Nonetheless, it should probably be\nconceded that “final value” is a more suitable term than\n“intrinsic value” to refer to the sort of value in\nquestion, since the latter term certainly does suggest value that\nsupervenes on intrinsic properties. But here a second point can be\nmade, and that is that, even if use of the term “intrinsic\nvalue” is restricted accordingly, it is arguable that, contrary\nto Korsgaard’s contention, all final value does after all\nsupervene on intrinsic properties alone; if that were the case, there\nwould seem to be no reason not to continue to use the term\n“intrinsic value” to refer to final value. Whether this is\nin fact the case depends in part on just what sort of thing\ncan be valuable for its own sake—an issue to be taken\nup in the next section. \nIn light of the matter just discussed, we must now decide what\nterminology to adopt. It is clear that moral philosophers since\nancient times have been concerned with the distinction between the\nvalue that something has for its own sake (the sort of nonderivative\nvalue that Korsgaard calls “final value”) and the value\nthat something has for the sake of something else to which it is\nrelated in some way. However, given the weight of tradition, it seems\njustifiable, perhaps even advisable, to continue, despite\nKorsgaard’s misgivings, to use the terms “intrinsic\nvalue” and “extrinsic value” to refer to these two\ntypes of value; if we do so, however, we should explicitly note that\nthis practice is not itself intended to endorse, or reject, the view\nthat intrinsic value supervenes on intrinsic properties alone. \nLet us now turn to doubts about the very coherence of the concept of\nintrinsic value, so understood. In Principia Ethica and\nelsewhere, Moore embraces the consequentialist view, mentioned above,\nthat whether an action is morally right or wrong turns exclusively on\nwhether its consequences are intrinsically better than those of its\nalternatives. Some philosophers have recently argued that ascribing\nintrinsic value to consequences in this way is fundamentally\nmisconceived. Peter Geach, for example, argues that Moore makes a\nserious mistake when comparing “good” with\n “yellow.”[6]\n Moore says that both terms express unanalyzable concepts but are to\nbe distinguished in that, whereas the latter refers to a natural\nproperty, the former refers to a nonnatural one. Geach contends that\nthere is a mistaken assimilation underlying Moore’s remarks,\nsince “good” in fact operates in a way quite unlike that\nof “yellow”—something that Moore wholly overlooks.\nThis contention would appear to be confirmed by the observation that\nthe phrase “x is a yellow bird” splits up\nlogically (as Geach puts it) into the phrase “x is a\nbird and x is yellow,” whereas the phrase\n“x is a good singer” does not split up in the\nsame way. Also, from “x is a yellow bird” and\n“a bird is an animal” we do not hesitate to infer\n“x is a yellow animal,” whereas no similar\ninference seems warranted in the case of “x is a good\nsinger” and “a singer is a person.” On the basis of\nthese observations Geach concludes that nothing can be good in the\nfree-standing way that Moore alleges; rather, whatever is good is good\nrelative to a certain kind. \nJudith Thomson has recently elaborated on Geach’s thesis\n(Thomson 1997). Although she does not unqualifiedly agree that\nwhatever is good is good relative to a certain kind, she does claim\nthat whatever is good is good in some way; nothing can be “just\nplain good,” as she believes Moore would have it. Philippa Foot,\namong others, has made a similar charge (Foot 1985). It is a charge\nthat has been rebutted by Michael Zimmerman, who argues that\nGeach’s tests are less straightforward than they may seem and\nfail after all to reveal a significant distinction between the ways in\nwhich “good” and “yellow” operate (Zimmerman\n2001, ch. 2). He argues further that Thomson mischaracterizes\nMoore’s conception of intrinsic value. According to Moore, he\nclaims, what is intrinsically good is not “just plain\ngood”; rather, it is good in a particular way, in keeping with\nThomson’s thesis that all goodness is goodness in a way. He\nmaintains that, for Moore and other proponents of intrinsic value,\nsuch value is a particular kind of moral value. Mahrad\nAlmotahari and Adam Hosein have revived Geach’s challenge\n(Almotahari and Hosein 2015). They argue that if, contrary to Geach,\n“good” could be used predicatively, we would be able to\nuse the term predicatively in sentences of the form ‘a is\na good K’ but, they argue, the linguistic evidence\nindicates that we cannot do so (Almotahari and Hosein 2015,\n1493–4).  \nAmong those who do not doubt the coherence of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue there is considerable difference of opinion about what sort or\nsorts of entity can have such value. Moore does not explicitly address\nthis issue, but his writings show him to have a liberal view on the\nmatter. There are times when he talks of individual objects (e.g.,\nbooks) as having intrinsic value, others when he talks of the\nconsciousness of individual objects (or of their qualities) as having\nintrinsic value, others when he talks of the existence of individual\nobjects as having intrinsic value, others when he talks of types of\nindividual objects as having intrinsic value, and still others when he\ntalks of states of individual objects as having intrinsic value. \nMoore would thus appear to be a “pluralist” concerning the\nbearers of intrinsic value. Others take a more conservative,\n“monistic” approach, according to which there is just one\nkind of bearer of intrinsic value. Consider, for example,\nFrankena’s long list of intrinsic goods, presented in Section 1\nabove: life, consciousness, etc. To what kind(s) of entity do\nsuch terms refer? Various answers have been given. Some (such as\nPanayot Butchvarov) claim that it is properties that are the\nbearers of intrinsic value (Butchvarov 1989, pp. 14–15). On this\nview, Frankena’s list implies that it is the properties of being\nalive, being conscious, and so on, that are intrinsically good. Others\n(such as Chisholm) claim that it is states of affairs that\nare the bearers of intrinsic value (Chisholm 1968–69, 1972,\n1975). On this view, Frankena’s list implies that it is the\nstates of affairs of someone (or something) being alive, someone being\nconscious, and so on, that are intrinsically good. Still others (such\nas Ross) claim that it is facts that are the bearers of\nintrinsic value (Ross 1930, pp. 112–13; cf. Lemos 1994, ch. 2).\nOn this view, Frankena’s list implies that it is the facts that\nsomeone (or something) is alive, that someone is conscious, and so on,\nthat are intrinsically good. (The difference between Chisholm’s\nand Ross’s views would seem to be this: whereas Chisholm would\nascribe intrinsic value even to states of affairs, such as that of\neveryone being happy, that do not obtain, Ross would ascribe such\nvalue only to states of affairs that do obtain.) \nOntologists often divide entities into two fundamental classes, those\nthat are abstract and those that are concrete. Unfortunately, there is\nno consensus on just how this distinction is to be drawn. Most\nphilosophers would classify the sorts of entities just mentioned\n(properties, states of affairs, and facts) as abstract. So understood,\nthe claim that intrinsic value is borne by such entities is to be\ndistinguished from the claim that it is borne by certain other closely\nrelated entities that are often classified as concrete. For example,\nit has recently been suggested that it is tropes that have intrinsic\n value.[7]\n Tropes are supposed to be a sort of particularized property, a kind\nof property-instance (rather than simply a property). (Thus the\nparticular whiteness of a particular piece of paper is to be\ndistinguished, on this view, from the property of whiteness.) It has\nalso been suggested that it is states, understood as a kind of\ninstance of states of affairs, that have intrinsic value (cf.\nZimmerman 2001, ch. 3). \nThose who make monistic proposals of the sort just mentioned are aware\nthat intrinsic value is sometimes ascribed to kinds of entities\ndifferent from those favored by their proposals. They claim that all\nsuch ascriptions can be reduced to, or translated into, ascriptions of\nintrinsic value of the sort they deem proper. Consider, for example,\nKorsgaard’s suggestion that a gorgeously enameled frying pan is\ngood for its own sake. Ross would say that this cannot be the case. If\nthere is any intrinsic value to be found here, it will, according to\nRoss, not reside in the pan itself but in the fact that it plays a\ncertain role in our lives, or perhaps in the fact that something plays\nthis role, or in the fact that something that plays this role exists.\n(Others would make other translations in the terms that they deem\nappropriate.) On the basis of this ascription of intrinsic value to\nsome fact, Ross could go on to ascribe a kind of extrinsic\nvalue to the pan itself, in virtue of its relation to the fact in\nquestion. \nWhether reduction of this sort is acceptable has been a matter of\nconsiderable debate. Proponents of monism maintain that it introduces\nsome much-needed order into the discussion of intrinsic value,\nclarifying just what is involved in the ascription of such value and\nsimplifying the computation of such value—on which point, see\nthe next section. (A corollary of some monistic approaches is that the\nvalue that something has for its own sake supervenes on the intrinsic\nproperties of that thing, so that there is a perfect convergence of\nthe two sorts of values that Korsgaard calls “final” and\n“intrinsic”. On this point, see the last section;\nZimmerman 2001, ch. 3; Tucker 2016; and Tucker (forthcoming).)\nOpponents argue that reduction results in distortion and\noversimplification; they maintain that, even if there is intrinsic\nvalue to be found in such a fact as that a gorgeously enameled frying\npan plays a certain role in our lives, there may yet be\nintrinsic, and not merely extrinsic, value to be found in the\npan itself and perhaps also in its existence (cf. Rabinowicz and\nRønnow-Rasmussen 1999 and 2003). Some propose a compromise\naccording to which the kind of intrinsic value that can sensibly be\nascribed to individual objects like frying pans is not the same kind\nof intrinsic value that is the topic of this article and can sensibly\nbe ascribed to items of the sort on Frankena’s list (cf. Bradley\n2006). (See again the cautionary note in the final paragraph of\nSection 2 above.) \nIn our assessments of intrinsic value, we are often and understandably\nconcerned not only with whether something is good or bad but\nwith how good or bad it is. Arriving at an answer to the\nlatter question is not straightforward. At least three problems\nthreaten to undermine the computation of intrinsic value. \nFirst, there is the possibility that the relation of intrinsic\nbetterness is not transitive (that is, the possibility that something\nA is intrinsically better than something else B,\nwhich is itself intrinsically better than some third thing C,\nand yet A is not intrinsically better than C).\nDespite the very natural assumption that this relation is transitive,\nit has been argued that it is not (Rachels 1998; Temkin 1987, 1997,\n2012). Should this in fact be the case, it would seriously complicate\ncomparisons, and hence assessments, of intrinsic value. \nSecond, there is the possibility that certain values are\nincommensurate. For example, Ross at one point contends that it is\nimpossible to compare the goodness of pleasure with that of virtue.\nWhereas he had suggested in The Right and the Good that\npleasure and virtue could be measured on the same scale of goodness,\nin Foundations of Ethics he declares this to be impossible,\nsince (he claims) it would imply that pleasure of a certain intensity,\nenjoyed by a sufficient number of people or for a sufficient time,\nwould counterbalance virtue possessed or manifested only by a small\nnumber of people or only for a short time; and this he professes to be\nincredible (Ross 1939, p. 275). But there is some confusion here. In\nclaiming that virtue and pleasure are incommensurate for the reason\ngiven, Ross presumably means that they cannot be measured on the same\nratio scale. (A ratio scale is one with an arbitrary unit but\na fixed zero point. Mass and length are standardly measured on ratio\nscales.) But incommensurability on a ratio scale does not imply\nincommensurability on every scale—an ordinal scale, for\ninstance. (An ordinal scale is simply one that supplies an ordering\nfor the quantity in question, such as the measurement of arm-strength\nthat is provided by an arm-wrestling competition.) Ross’s\nremarks indicate that he in fact believes that virtue and pleasure\nare commensurate on an ordinal scale, since he appears to\nsubscribe to the arch-puritanical view that any amount of virtue is\nintrinsically better than any amount of pleasure. This view is just\none example of the thesis that some goods are “higher”\nthan others, in the sense that any amount of the former is better than\nany amount of the latter. This thesis can be traced to the ancient\nGreeks (Plato, Philebus, 21a-e; Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics, 1174a), and it has been endorsed by many philosophers\nsince, perhaps most famously by Mill (Mill 1863, paras. 4 ff).\nInterest in the thesis has recently been revived by a set of intricate\nand intriguing puzzles, posed by Derek Parfit, concerning the relative\nvalues of low-quantity/high-quality goods and\nhigh-quantity/low-quality goods (Parfit 1984, Part IV). One response\nto these puzzles (eschewed by Parfit himself) is to adopt the thesis\nof the nontransitivity of intrinsic betterness. Another is to insist\non the thesis that some goods are higher than others. Such a response\ndoes not by itself solve the puzzles that Parfit raises, but, to the\nextent that it helps, it does so at the cost of once again\ncomplicating the computation of intrinsic value. \nTo repeat: contrary to what Ross says, the thesis that some goods are\nhigher than others implies that such goods are commensurate, and not\nthat they are incommensurate. Some people do hold, however, that\ncertain values really are incommensurate and thus cannot be compared\non any meaningful scale. (Isaiah Berlin [1909–1997], for\nexample, is often thought to have said this about the values of\nliberty and equality. Whether he is best interpreted in this way is\ndebatable. See Berlin 1969.) This view constitutes a more radical\nthreat to the computation of intrinsic value than does the view that\nintrinsic betterness is not transitive. The latter view presupposes at\nleast some measure of commensurability. If A is better than\nB and B is better than C, then A\nis commensurate with B and B is commensurate with\nC; and even if it should turn out that A is not\nbetter than C, it may still be that A is\ncommensurate with C, either because it is as good as\nC or because it is worse than C. But if A\nis incommensurate with B, then A is neither better\nthan nor as good as nor worse than B. (Some claim, however,\nthat the reverse does not hold and that, even if A is neither\nbetter than nor as good as nor worse than B, still A\nmay be “on a par” with B and thus be roughly\ncomparable with it. Cf. Chang 1997, 2002.) If such a case can arise,\nthere is an obvious limit to the extent to which we can meaningfully\nsay how good a certain complex whole is (here, “whole” is\nused to refer to whatever kind of entity may have intrinsic value);\nfor, if such a whole comprises incommensurate goods A and\nB, then there will be no way of establishing just how good it\nis overall, even if there is a way of establishing how good it is with\nrespect to each of A and B. \nThere is a third, still more radical threat to the computation of\nintrinsic value. Quite apart from any concern with the\ncommensurability of values, Moore famously claims that there is no\neasy formula for the determination of the intrinsic value of complex\nwholes because of the truth of what he calls the “principle of\norganic unities” (Moore 1903, p. 96). According to this\nprinciple, the intrinsic value of a whole must not be assumed to be\nthe same as the sum of the intrinsic values of its parts (Moore 1903,\np. 28) As an example of an organic unity, Moore gives the case of the\nconsciousness of a beautiful object; he says that this has great\nintrinsic value, even though the consciousness as such and the\nbeautiful object as such each have comparatively little, if any,\nintrinsic value. If the principle of organic unities is true, then\nthere is scant hope of a systematic approach to the computation of\nintrinsic value. Although the principle explicitly rules out only\nsummation as a method of computation, Moore’s remarks strongly\nsuggest that there is no relation between the parts of a whole and the\nwhole itself that holds in general and in terms of which the value of\nthe latter can be computed by aggregating (whether by summation or by\nsome other means) the values of the former. Moore’s position has\nbeen endorsed by many other philosophers. For example, Ross says that\nit is better that one person be good and happy and another bad and\nunhappy than that the former be good and unhappy and the latter bad\nand happy, and he takes this to be confirmation of Moore’s\nprinciple (Ross 1930, p. 72). Broad takes organic unities of the sort\nthat Moore discusses to be just one instance of a more general\nphenomenon that he believes to be at work in many other situations, as\nwhen, for example, two tunes, each pleasing in its own right, make for\na cacophonous combination (Broad 1985, p. 256). Others have furnished\nstill further examples of organic unities (Chisholm 1986, ch. 7; Lemos\n1994, chs. 3 and 4, and 1998; Hurka 1998). \nWas Moore the first to call attention to the phenomenon of organic\nunities in the context of intrinsic value? This is debatable. Despite\nthe fact that he explicitly invoked what he called a “principle\nof summation” that would appear to be inconsistent with the\nprinciple of organic unities, Brentano appears nonetheless to have\nanticipated Moore’s principle in his discussion of\nSchadenfreude, that is, of malicious pleasure; he condemns\nsuch an attitude, even though he claims that pleasure as such is\nintrinsically good (Brentano 1969, p. 23 n). Certainly Chisholm takes\nBrentano to be an advocate of organic unities (Chisholm 1986, ch. 5),\nascribing to him the view that there are many kinds of organic unity\nand building on what he takes to be Brentano’s insights (and,\ngoing further back in the history of philosophy, the insights of St.\nThomas Aquinas [1225–1274] and others). \nRecently, a special spin has been put on the principle of organic\nunities by so-called “particularists.” Jonathan Dancy, for\nexample, has claimed (in keeping with Korsgaard and others mentioned\nin Section 3 above), that something’s intrinsic value need not\nsupervene on its intrinsic properties alone; in fact, the\nsupervenience-base may be so open-ended that it resists\ngeneralization. The upshot, according to Dancy, is that the intrinsic\nvalue of something may vary from context to context; indeed, the\nvariation may be so great that the thing’s value changes\n“polarity” from good to bad, or vice versa (Dancy\n2000). This approach to value constitutes an endorsement of the\nprinciple of organic unities that is even more subversive of the\ncomputation of intrinsic value than Moore’s; for Moore holds\nthat the intrinsic value of something is and must be constant, even if\nits contribution to the value of wholes of which it forms a part is\nnot, whereas Dancy holds that variation can occur at both levels. \nNot everyone has accepted the principle of organic unities; some have\nheld out hope for a more systematic approach to the computation of\nintrinsic value. However, even someone who is inclined to measure\nintrinsic value in terms of summation must acknowledge that there is a\nsense in which the principle of organic unities is obviously true.\nConsider some complex whole, W, that is composed of three\ngoods, X, Y, and Z, which are wholly\nindependent of one another. Suppose that we had a ratio scale on which\nto measure these goods, and that their values on this scale were 10,\n20, and 30, respectively. We would expect someone who takes intrinsic\nvalue to be summative to declare the value of W to be (10 +\n20 + 30 =) 60. But notice that, if X, Y, and\nZ are parts of W, then so too, presumably, are the\ncombinations X-and-Y, X-and-Z, and\nY-and-Z; the values of these combinations, computed\nin terms of summation, will be 30, 40, and 50, respectively. If the\nvalues of these parts of W were also taken into consideration\nwhen evaluating W, the value of W would balloon to\n180. Clearly, this would be a distortion. Someone who wishes to\nmaintain that intrinsic value is summative must thus show not only how\nthe various alleged examples of organic unities provided by Moore and\nothers are to be reinterpreted, but also how, in the sort of case just\nsketched, it is only the values of X, Y, and\nZ, and not the values either of any combinations of these\ncomponents or of any parts of these components, that are to be taken\ninto account when evaluating W itself. In order to bring some\nsemblance of manageability to the computation of intrinsic value, this\nis precisely what some writers, by appealing to the idea of\n“basic” intrinsic value, have tried to do. The general\nidea is this. In the sort of example just given, each of X,\nY, and Z is to be construed as having basic\nintrinsic value; if any combinations or parts of X,\nY, and Z have intrinsic value, this value is not\nbasic; and the value of W is to be computed by appealing only\nto those parts of W that have basic intrinsic value. \nGilbert Harman was one of the first explicitly to discuss basic\nintrinsic value when he pointed out the apparent need to invoke such\nvalue if we are to avoid distortions in our evaluations (Harman 1967).\nHowever, he offers no precise account of the concept of basic\nintrinsic value and ends his paper by saying that he can think of no\nway to show that nonbasic intrinsic value is to be computed in terms\nof the summation of basic intrinsic value. Several philosophers have\nsince tried to do better. Many have argued that nonbasic intrinsic\nvalue cannot always be computed by summing basic intrinsic\nvalue. Suppose that states of affairs can bear intrinsic value. Let\nX be the state of affairs of John being pleased to a certain\ndegree x, and Y be the state of affairs of Jane\nbeing displeased to a certain degree y, and suppose that\nX has a basic intrinsic value of 10 and Y a basic\nintrinsic value of −20. It seems reasonable to sum these values\nand attribute an intrinsic value of −10 to the conjunctive state\nof affairs X&Y. But what of the disjunctive state of\naffairs XvY or the negative state of affairs ~X? How\nare their intrinsic values to be computed? Summation seems to\nbe a nonstarter in these cases. Nonetheless, attempts have been made\neven in such cases to show how the intrinsic value of a complex whole\nis to be computed in a nonsummative way in terms of the basic\nintrinsic values of simpler states, thus preserving the idea that\nbasic intrinsic value is the key to the computation of all intrinsic\nvalue (Quinn 1974, Chisholm 1975, Oldfield 1977, Carlson 1997). (These\nattempts have generally been based on the assumption that states of\naffairs are the sole bearers of intrinsic value. Matters\nwould be considerably more complicated if it turned out that entities\nof several different ontological categories could all have intrinsic\nvalue.) \nSuggestions as to how to compute nonbasic intrinsic value in terms of\nbasic intrinsic value of course presuppose that there is such a thing\nas basic intrinsic value, but few have attempted to provide an account\nof what basic intrinsic value itself consists in. Fred Feldman is one\nof the few (Feldman 2000; cf. Feldman 1997, pp. 116–18).\nSubscribing to the view that only states of affairs bear intrinsic\nvalue, Feldman identifies several features that any state of affairs\nthat has basic intrinsic value in particular must possess. He\nmaintains, for example, that whatever has basic intrinsic value must\nhave it to a determinate degree and that this value cannot be\n“defeated” by any Moorean organic unity. In this way,\nFeldman seeks to preserve the idea that intrinsic value is summative\nafter all. He does not claim that all intrinsic value is to be\ncomputed by summing basic intrinsic value, but he does insist that the\nvalue of entire worlds is to be computed in this way. \nDespite the detail in which Feldman characterizes the concept of basic\nintrinsic value, he offers no strict analysis of it. Others have tried\nto supply such an analysis. For example, by noting that, even if it is\ntrue that only states have intrinsic value, it may yet be that not all\nstates have intrinsic value, Zimmerman suggests (to put matters\nsomewhat roughly) that basic intrinsic value is the intrinsic value\nhad by states none of whose proper parts have intrinsic value\n(Zimmerman 2001, ch. 5). On this basis he argues that disjunctive and\nnegative states in fact have no intrinsic value at all, and thereby\nseeks to show how all intrinsic value is to be computed in terms of\nsummation after all. \nTwo final points. First, we are now in a position to see why it was\nsaid above (in Section 2) that perhaps not all intrinsic value is\nnonderivative. If it is correct to distinguish between basic and\nnonbasic intrinsic value and also to compute the latter in terms of\nthe former, then there is clearly a respectable sense in which\nnonbasic intrinsic value is derivative. Second, if states with basic\nintrinsic value account for all the value that there is in the world,\nsupport is found for Chisholm’s view (reported in Section 2)\nthat some ontological version of Moore’s isolation test is\nacceptable. \nAt the beginning of this article, extrinsic value was said\nsimply—too simply—to be value that is not intrinsic.\nLater, once intrinsic value had been characterized as nonderivative\nvalue of a certain, perhaps moral kind, extrinsic value was said more\nparticularly to be derivative value of that same kind. That\nwhich is extrinsically good is good, not (insofar as its extrinsic\nvalue is concerned) for its own sake, but for the sake of something\nelse to which it is related in some way. For example, the goodness of\nhelping others in time of need is plausibly thought to be extrinsic\n(at least in part), being derivative (at least in part) from the\ngoodness of something else, such as these people’s needs being\nsatisfied, or their experiencing pleasure, to which helping them is\nrelated in some causal way. \nTwo questions arise. The first is whether so-called extrinsic value is\nreally a type of value at all. There would seem to be a sense in which\nit is not, for it does not add to or detract from the value in the\nworld. Consider some long chain of derivation. Suppose that the\nextrinsic value of A can be traced to the intrinsic value of\nZ by way of B, C, D… Thus\nA is good (for example) because of B, which is good\nbecause of C, and so on, until we get to Y’s\nbeing good because of Z; when it comes to Z,\nhowever, we have something that is good, not because of something\nelse, but “because of itself,” i.e., for its own sake. In\nthis sort of case, the values of A, B, …,\nY are all parasitic on the value of Z. It is\nZ’s value that contributes to the value there is in the\nworld; A, B, …, Y contribute no\nvalue of their own. (As long as the value of Z is the only\nintrinsic value at stake, no change of value would be effected in or\nimparted to the world if a shorter route from A to Z\nwere discovered, one that bypassed some letters in the middle of the\nalphabet.) \nWhy talk of “extrinsic value” at all, then? The answer can\nonly be that we just do say that certain things are good, and others\nbad, not for their own sake but for the sake of something else to\nwhich they are related in some way. To say that these things are good\nand bad only in a derivative sense, that their value is merely\nparasitic on or reflective of the value of something else, is one\nthing; to deny that they are good or bad in any respectable sense is\nquite another. The former claim is accurate; hence the latter would\nappear unwarranted. \nIf we accept that talk of “extrinsic value” can be\nappropriate, however, a second question then arises: what sort of\nrelation must obtain between A and Z if A\nis to be said to be good “because of” Z? It is\nnot clear just what the answer to this question is. Philosophers have\ntended to focus on just one particular causal relation, the means-end\nrelation. This is the relation at issue in the example given earlier:\nhelping others is a means to their needs being satisfied, which is\nitself a means to their experiencing pleasure. The term most often\nused to refer to this type of extrinsic value is “instrumental\nvalue,” although there is some dispute as to just how this term\nis to be employed. (Remember also, from Section 3 above, that on some\nviews “instrumental value” may refer to a type of\nintrinsic, or final, value.) Suppose that A is a\nmeans to Z, and that Z is intrinsically good. Should\nwe therefore say that A is instrumentally good? What if\nA has another consequence, Y, and this consequence\nis intrinsically bad? What, especially, if the intrinsic badness of\nY is greater than the intrinsic goodness of Z? Some\nwould say that in such a case A is both instrumentally good\n(because of Z) and instrumentally bad (because of\nY). Others would say that it is correct to say that\nA is instrumentally good only if all of A’s\ncausal consequences that have intrinsic value are, taken as a whole,\nintrinsically good. Still others would say that whether something is\ninstrumentally good depends not only on what it causes to happen but\nalso on what it prevents from happening (cf. Bradley 1998). For\nexample, if pain is intrinsically bad, and taking an aspirin puts a\nstop to your pain but causes nothing of any positive intrinsic value,\nsome would say that taking the aspirin is instrumentally good despite\nits having no intrinsically good consequences. \nMany philosophers write as if instrumental value is the only type of\nextrinsic value, but that is a mistake. Suppose, for instance, that\nthe results of a certain medical test indicate that the patient is in\ngood health, and suppose that this patient’s having good health\nis intrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that the results\nare themselves (extrinsically) good. But notice that the results are\nof course not a means to good health; they are simply indicative of\nit. Or suppose that making your home available to a struggling artist\nwhile you spend a year abroad provides him with an opportunity he\nwould otherwise not have to create some masterpieces, and suppose that\neither the process or the product of this creation would be\nintrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that your making your\nhome available to him is (extrinsically) good because of the\nopportunity it provides him, even if he goes on to squander the\nopportunity and nothing good comes of it. Or suppose that\nsomeone’s appreciating the beauty of the Mona Lisa\nwould be intrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that the\npainting itself has value in light of this fact, a kind of value that\nsome have called “inherent value” (Lewis 1946, p. 391; cf.\nFrankena 1973, p. 82). (“Inherent value” may not\nbe the most suitable term to use here, since it may well suggest\nintrinsic value, whereas the sort of value at issue is\nsupposed to be a type of extrinsic value. The value\nattributed to the painting is one that it is said to have in virtue of\nits relation to something else that would supposedly be intrinsically\ngood if it occurred, namely, the appreciation of its beauty.) Many\nother instances could be given of cases in which we are inclined to\ncall something good in virtue of its relation to something else that\nis or would be intrinsically good, even though the relation in\nquestion is not a means-end relation. \nOne final point. It is sometimes said that there can be no extrinsic\nvalue without intrinsic value. This thesis admits of several\ninterpretations. First, it might mean that nothing can occur that is\nextrinsically good unless something else occurs that is intrinsically\ngood, and that nothing can occur that is extrinsically bad unless\nsomething else occurs that is intrinsically bad. Second, it might mean\nthat nothing can occur that is either extrinsically good or\nextrinsically bad unless something else occurs that is either\nintrinsically good or intrinsically bad. On both these\ninterpretations, the thesis is dubious. Suppose that no one ever\nappreciates the beauty of Leonardo’s masterpiece, and that\nnothing else that is intrinsically either good or bad ever occurs;\nstill his painting may be said to be inherently good. Or suppose that\nthe aspirin prevents your pain from even starting, and hence inhibits\nthe occurrence of something intrinsically bad, but nothing else that\nis intrinsically either good or bad ever occurs; still your taking the\naspirin may be said to be instrumentally good. On a third\ninterpretation, however, the thesis might be true. That interpretation\nis this: nothing can occur that is either extrinsically good or\nextrinsically neutral or extrinsically bad unless something else\noccurs that is either intrinsically good or intrinsically neutral or\nintrinsically bad. This would be trivially true if, as some maintain,\nthe nonoccurrence of something intrinsically either good or bad\nentails the occurrence of something intrinsically neutral. But even if\nthe thesis should turn out to be false on this third interpretation,\ntoo, it would nonetheless seem to be true on a fourth interpretation,\naccording to which the concept of extrinsic value, in all its\nvarieties, is to be understood in terms of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue.","contact.mail":"m_zimme2@uncg.edu","contact.domain":"uncg.edu"},{"date.published":"2002-10-22","date.changed":"2019-01-09","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-intrinsic-extrinsic/","author1":"Michael J. Zimmerman","author2":"Ben Bradley","entry":"value-intrinsic-extrinsic","body.text":"\n\n\nIntrinsic value has traditionally been thought to lie at the heart of\nethics. Philosophers use a number of terms to refer to such value. The\nintrinsic value of something is said to be the value that that thing\nhas “in itself,” or “for its own sake,” or\n“as such,” or “in its own right.” Extrinsic\nvalue is value that is not intrinsic.\n\n\nMany philosophers take intrinsic value to be crucial to a variety of\nmoral judgments. For example, according to a fundamental form of\nconsequentialism, whether an action is morally right or wrong\nhas exclusively to do with whether its consequences are intrinsically\nbetter than those of any other action one can perform under the\ncircumstances. Many other theories also hold that what it is right or\nwrong to do has at least in part to do with the intrinsic value of the\nconsequences of the actions one can perform. Moreover, if, as is\ncommonly believed, what one is morally responsible for doing\nis some function of the rightness or wrongness of what one does, then\nintrinsic value would seem relevant to judgments about responsibility,\ntoo. Intrinsic value is also often taken to be pertinent to judgments\nabout moral justice (whether having to do with moral rights\nor moral desert), insofar as it is good that justice is done and bad\nthat justice is denied, in ways that appear intimately tied to\nintrinsic value. Finally, it is typically thought that judgments about\nmoral virtue and vice also turn on questions of intrinsic\nvalue, inasmuch as virtues are good, and vices bad, again in ways that\nappear closely connected to such value.\n\n\nAll four types of moral judgments have been the subject of discussion\nsince the dawn of western philosophy in ancient Greece. The Greeks\nthemselves were especially concerned with questions about virtue and\nvice, and the concept of intrinsic value may be found at work in their\nwritings and in the writings of moral philosophers ever since. Despite\nthis fact, and rather surprisingly, it is only within the last one\nhundred years or so that this concept has itself been the subject of\nsustained scrutiny, and even within this relatively brief period the\nscrutiny has waxed and waned.\n\nThe question “What is intrinsic value?” is more\nfundamental than the question “What has intrinsic value?,”\nbut historically these have been treated in reverse order. For a long\ntime, philosophers appear to have thought that the notion of intrinsic\nvalue is itself sufficiently clear to allow them to go straight to the\nquestion of what should be said to have intrinsic value. Not even a\npotted history of what has been said on this matter can be attempted\nhere, since the record is so rich. Rather, a few representative\nillustrations must suffice. \nIn his dialogue Protagoras, Plato [428–347 B.C.E.]\nmaintains (through the character of Socrates, modeled after the real\nSocrates [470–399 B.C.E.], who was Plato’s teacher) that,\nwhen people condemn pleasure, they do so, not because they take\npleasure to be bad as such, but because of the bad consequences they\nfind pleasure often to have. For example, at one point Socrates says\nthat the only reason why the pleasures of food and drink and sex seem\nto be evil is that they result in pain and deprive us of future\npleasures (Plato, Protagoras, 353e). He concludes that\npleasure is in fact good as such and pain bad, regardless of what\ntheir consequences may on occasion be. In the Timaeus, Plato\nseems quite pessimistic about these consequences, for he has Timaeus\ndeclare pleasure to be “the greatest incitement to evil”\nand pain to be something that “deters from good” (Plato,\nTimaeus, 69d). Plato does not think of pleasure as the\n“highest” good, however. In the Republic,\nSocrates states that there can be no “communion” between\n“extravagant” pleasure and virtue (Plato,\nRepublic, 402e) and in the Philebus, where Philebus\nargues that pleasure is the highest good, Socrates argues against\nthis, claiming that pleasure is better when accompanied by\nintelligence (Plato, Philebus, 60e). \nMany philosophers have followed Plato’s lead in declaring\npleasure intrinsically good and pain intrinsically bad. Aristotle\n[384–322 B.C.E.], for example, himself a student of\nPlato’s, says at one point that all are agreed that pain is bad\nand to be avoided, either because it is bad “without\nqualification” or because it is in some way an\n“impediment” to us; he adds that pleasure, being the\n“contrary” of that which is to be avoided, is therefore\nnecessarily a good (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1153b).\nOver the course of the more than two thousand years since this was\nwritten, this view has been frequently endorsed. Like Plato, Aristotle\ndoes not take pleasure and pain to be the only things that are\nintrinsically good and bad, although some have maintained that this is\nindeed the case. This more restrictive view, often called hedonism,\nhas had proponents since the time of Epicurus [341–271\n B.C.E.].[1]\n Perhaps the most thorough renditions of it are to be found in the\nworks of Jeremy Bentham [1748–1832] and Henry Sidgwick\n[1838–1900] (see Bentham 1789, Sidgwick 1907); perhaps its most\nfamous proponent is John Stuart Mill [1806–1873] (see Mill\n1863). \nMost philosophers who have written on the question of what has\nintrinsic value have not been hedonists; like Plato and Aristotle,\nthey have thought that something besides pleasure and pain has\nintrinsic value. One of the most comprehensive lists of intrinsic\ngoods that anyone has suggested is that given by William Frankena\n(Frankena 1973, pp. 87–88): life, consciousness, and activity;\nhealth and strength; pleasures and satisfactions of all or certain\nkinds; happiness, beatitude, contentment, etc.; truth; knowledge and\ntrue opinions of various kinds, understanding, wisdom; beauty,\nharmony, proportion in objects contemplated; aesthetic experience;\nmorally good dispositions or virtues; mutual affection, love,\nfriendship, cooperation; just distribution of goods and evils; harmony\nand proportion in one’s own life; power and experiences of\nachievement; self-expression; freedom; peace, security; adventure and\nnovelty; and good reputation, honor, esteem, etc. (Presumably a\ncorresponding list of intrinsic evils could be provided.) Almost any\nphilosopher who has ever addressed the question of what has intrinsic\nvalue will find his or her answer represented in some way by one or\nmore items on Frankena’s list. (Frankena himself notes that he\ndoes not explicitly include in his list the communion with and love\nand knowledge of God that certain philosophers believe to be the\nhighest good, since he takes them to fall under the headings of\n“knowledge” and “love.”) One conspicuous\nomission from the list, however, is the increasingly popular view that\ncertain environmental entities or qualities have intrinsic value\n(although Frankena may again assert that these are implicitly\nrepresented by one or more items already on the list). Some find\nintrinsic value, for example, in certain “natural”\nenvironments (wildernesses untouched by human hand); some find it in\ncertain animal species; and so on. \nSuppose that you were confronted with some proposed list of intrinsic\ngoods. It would be natural to ask how you might assess the accuracy of\nthe list. How can you tell whether something has intrinsic value or\nnot? On one level, this is an epistemological question about which\nthis article will not be concerned. (See the entry in this\nencyclopedia on moral epistemology.) On another level, however, this\nis a conceptual question, for we cannot be sure that something has\nintrinsic value unless we understand what it is for something to have\nintrinsic value. \nThe concept of intrinsic value has been characterized above in terms\nof the value that something has “in itself,” or “for\nits own sake,” or “as such,” or “in its own\nright.” The custom has been not to distinguish between the\nmeanings of these terms, but we will see that there is reason to think\nthat there may in fact be more than one concept at issue here. For the\nmoment, though, let us ignore this complication and focus on what it\nmeans to say that something is valuable for its own sake as\nopposed to being valuable for the sake of something else to\nwhich it is related in some way. Perhaps it is easiest to grasp this\ndistinction by way of illustration. \nSuppose that someone were to ask you whether it is good to help others\nin time of need. Unless you suspected some sort of trick, you would\nanswer, “Yes, of course.” If this person were to go on to\nask you why acting in this way is good, you might say that it is good\nto help others in time of need simply because it is good that their\nneeds be satisfied. If you were then asked why it is good that\npeople’s needs be satisfied, you might be puzzled. You might be\ninclined to say, “It just is.” Or you might accept the\nlegitimacy of the question and say that it is good that people’s\nneeds be satisfied because this brings them pleasure. But then, of\ncourse, your interlocutor could ask once again, “What’s\ngood about that?” Perhaps at this point you would answer,\n“It just is good that people be pleased,” and thus put an\nend to this line of questioning. Or perhaps you would again seek to\nexplain the fact that it is good that people be pleased in terms of\nsomething else that you take to be good. At some point, though, you\nwould have to put an end to the questions, not because you would have\ngrown tired of them (though that is a distinct possibility), but\nbecause you would be forced to recognize that, if one thing derives\nits goodness from some other thing, which derives its goodness from\nyet a third thing, and so on, there must come a point at which you\nreach something whose goodness is not derivative in this way,\nsomething that “just is” good in its own right, something\nwhose goodness is the source of, and thus explains, the goodness to be\nfound in all the other things that precede it on the list. It is at\nthis point that you will have arrived at intrinsic goodness (cf.\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1094a). That which is\nintrinsically good is nonderivatively good; it is good for its\nown sake. That which is not intrinsically good but\nextrinsically good is derivatively good; it is good, not (insofar as\nits extrinsic value is concerned) for its own sake, but for the sake\nof something else that is good and to which it is related in some way.\nIntrinsic value thus has a certain priority over extrinsic value. The\nlatter is derivative from or reflective of the former and is to be\nexplained in terms of the former. It is for this reason that\nphilosophers have tended to focus on intrinsic value in\nparticular. \nThe account just given of the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic value is rough, but it should do as a start. Certain\ncomplications must be immediately acknowledged, though. First, there\nis the possibility, mentioned above, that the terms traditionally used\nto refer to intrinsic value in fact refer to more than one concept;\nagain, this will be addressed later (in this section and the next).\nAnother complication is that it may not in fact be accurate to say\nthat whatever is intrinsically good is nonderivatively good; some\nintrinsic value may be derivative. This issue will be taken up (in\nSection 5) when the computation of intrinsic value is discussed; it\nmay be safely ignored for now. Still another complication is this. It\nis almost universally acknowledged among philosophers that all value\nis “supervenient” or “grounded in” on certain\nnonevaluative features of the thing that has value. Roughly, what this\nmeans is that, if something has value, it will have this value in\nvirtue of certain nonevaluative features that it has; its value can be\nattributed to these features.  For example, the value of helping\nothers in time of need might be attributed to the fact that such\nbehavior has the feature of being causally related to certain pleasant\nexperiences induced in those who receive the help. Suppose we accept\nthis and accept also that the experiences in question are\nintrinsically good. In saying this, we are (barring the complication\nto be discussed in Section 5) taking the value of the experiences to\nbe nonderivative. Nonetheless, we may well take this value, like all\nvalue, to be supervenient on, or grounded in, something. In this case,\nwe would probably simply attribute the value of the experiences to\ntheir having the feature of being pleasant. This brings out the subtle\nbut important point that the question whether some value is derivative\nis distinct from the question whether it is supervenient. Even\nnonderivative value (value that something has in its own right; value\nthat is, in some way, not attributable to the value of\nanything else) is usually understood to be supervenient on certain\nnonevaluative features of the thing that has value (and thus to be\nattributable, in a different way, to these features). \nTo repeat: whatever is intrinsically good is (barring the complication\nto be discussed in Section 5) nonderivatively good. It would be a\nmistake, however, to affirm the converse of this and say that whatever\nis nonderivatively good is intrinsically good. As “intrinsic\nvalue” is traditionally understood, it refers to a\nparticular way of being nonderivatively good; there are other\nways in which something might be nonderivatively good. For example,\nsuppose that your interlocutor were to ask you whether it is good to\neat and drink in moderation and to exercise regularly. Again, you\nwould say, “Yes, of course.” If asked why, you would say\nthat this is because such behavior promotes health. If asked what is\ngood about being healthy, you might cite something else whose goodness\nwould explain the value of health, or you might simply say,\n“Being healthy just is a good way to be.” If the latter\nwere your response, you would be indicating that you took health to be\nnonderivatively good in some way. In what way, though? Well, perhaps\nyou would be thinking of health as intrinsically good. But perhaps\nnot. Suppose that what you meant was that being healthy just is\n“good for” the person who is healthy (in the sense that it\nis in each person’s interest to be healthy), so that\nJohn’s being healthy is good for John, Jane’s being\nhealthy is good for Jane, and so on. You would thereby be attributing\na type of nonderivative interest-value to John’s being healthy,\nand yet it would be perfectly consistent for you to deny that\nJohn’s being healthy is intrinsically good. If John\nwere a villain, you might well deny this. Indeed, you might want to\ninsist that, in light of his villainy, his being healthy is\nintrinsically bad, even though you recognize that his being\nhealthy is good for him. If you did say this, you would be\nindicating that you subscribe to the common view that intrinsic value\nis nonderivative value of some peculiarly moral\n sort.[2] \nLet us now see whether this still rough account of intrinsic value can\nbe made more precise. One of the first writers to concern himself with\nthe question of what exactly is at issue when we ascribe intrinsic\nvalue to something was G. E. Moore [1873–1958]. In his book\nPrincipia Ethica, Moore asks whether the concept of intrinsic\nvalue (or, more particularly, the concept of intrinsic goodness, upon\nwhich he tended to focus) is analyzable. In raising this question, he\nhas a particular type of analysis in mind, one which consists in\n“breaking down” a concept into simpler component concepts.\n(One example of an analysis of this sort is the analysis of the\nconcept of being a vixen in terms of the concepts of being a fox and\nbeing female.) His own answer to the question is that the concept of\nintrinsic goodness is not amenable to such analysis (Moore\n1903, ch. 1). In place of analysis, Moore proposes a certain kind of\nthought-experiment in order both to come to understand the concept\nbetter and to reach a decision about what is intrinsically good. He\nadvises us to consider what things are such that, if they existed by\nthemselves “in absolute isolation,” we would judge their\nexistence to be good; in this way, we will be better able to see what\nreally accounts for the value that there is in our world. For example,\nif such a thought-experiment led you to conclude that all and only\npleasure would be good in isolation, and all and only pain bad, you\nwould be a\n hedonist.[3]\n Moore himself deems it incredible that anyone, thinking clearly,\nwould reach this conclusion. He says that it involves our saying that\na world in which only pleasure existed—a world without any\nknowledge, love, enjoyment of beauty, or moral qualities—is\nbetter than a world that contained all these things but in which there\nexisted slightly less pleasure (Moore 1912, p. 102). Such a view he\nfinds absurd. \nRegardless of the merits of this isolation test, it remains unclear\nexactly why Moore finds the concept of intrinsic goodness to be\nunanalyzable. At one point he attacks the view that it can be analyzed\nwholly in terms of “natural” concepts—the view, that\nis, that we can break down the concept of being intrinsically good\ninto the simpler concepts of being A, being B, being\nC…, where these component concepts are all purely\ndescriptive rather than evaluative. (One candidate that Moore\ndiscusses is this: for something to be intrinsically good is for it to\nbe something that we desire to desire.) He argues that any such\nanalysis is to be rejected, since it will always be intelligible to\nask whether (and, presumably, to deny that) it is good that something\nbe A, B, C,…, which would not be the\ncase if the analysis were accurate (Moore 1903, pp. 15–16). Even\nif this argument is successful (a complicated matter about which there\nis considerable disagreement), it of course does not establish the\nmore general claim that the concept of intrinsic goodness is not\nanalyzable at all, since it leaves open the possibility that this\nconcept is analyzable in terms of other concepts, some or all of which\nare not “natural” but evaluative. Moore apparently thinks\nthat his objection works just as well where one or more of the\ncomponent concepts A, B, C,…, is\nevaluative; but, again, many dispute the cogency of his argument.\nIndeed, several philosophers have proposed analyses of just this sort.\nFor example, Roderick Chisholm [1916–1999] has argued that\nMoore’s own isolation test in fact provides the basis for an\nanalysis of the concept of intrinsic value. He formulates a view\naccording to which (to put matters roughly) to say that a state of\naffairs is intrinsically good or bad is to say that it is possible\nthat its goodness or badness constitutes all the goodness or badness\nthat there is in the world (Chisholm 1978).  \nEva Bodanszky and Earl Conee have attacked Chisholm’s proposal,\nshowing that it is, in its details, unacceptable (Bodanszky and Conee\n1981). However, the general idea that an intrinsically valuable state\nis one that could somehow account for all the value in the world is\nsuggestive and promising; if it could be adequately formulated, it\nwould reveal an important feature of intrinsic value that would help\nus better understand the concept. We will return to this point in\nSection 5. Rather than pursue such a line of thought, Chisholm himself\nresponded (Chisholm 1981) in a different way to Bodanszky and Conee.\nHe shifted from what may be called an ontological version of\nMoore’s isolation test—the attempt to understand the\nintrinsic value of a state in terms of the value that there would be\nif it were the only valuable state in existence—to an\nintentional version of that test—the attempt to\nunderstand the intrinsic value of a state in terms of the kind of\nattitude it would be fitting to have if one were to\ncontemplate the valuable state as such, without reference to\ncircumstances or consequences. \nThis new analysis in fact reflects a general idea that has a rich\nhistory. Franz Brentano [1838–1917], C. D. Broad\n[1887–1971], W. D. Ross [1877–1971], and A. C. Ewing\n[1899–1973], among others, have claimed, in a more or less\nqualified way, that the concept of intrinsic goodness is analyzable in\nterms of the fittingness of some “pro” (i.e., positive)\nattitude (Brentano 1969, p. 18; Broad 1930, p. 283; Ross 1939, pp.\n275–76; Ewing 1948, p. 152). Such an analysis, which has come to\nbe called “the fitting attitude analysis” of value, is\nsupported by the mundane observation that, instead of saying that\nsomething is good, we often say that it is valuable, which\nitself just means that it is fitting to value the thing in question.\nIt would thus seem very natural to suppose that for something to be\nintrinsically good is simply for it to be such that it is fitting to\nvalue it for its own sake. (“Fitting” here is often\nunderstood to signify a particular kind of moral fittingness, in\nkeeping with the idea that intrinsic value is a particular kind of\nmoral value. The underlying point is that those who value for its own\nsake that which is intrinsically good thereby evince a kind of\nmoral sensitivity.) \nThough undoubtedly attractive, this analysis can be and has been\nchallenged. Brand Blanshard [1892–1987], for example, argues\nthat the analysis is to be rejected because, if we ask why\nsomething is such that it is fitting to value it for its own sake, the\nanswer is that this is the case precisely because the thing\nin question is intrinsically good; this answer indicates that the\nconcept of intrinsic goodness is more fundamental than that of the\nfittingness of some pro attitude, which is inconsistent with analyzing\nthe former in terms of the latter (Blanshard 1961, pp. 284–86).\nEwing and others have resisted Blanshard’s argument, maintaining\nthat what grounds and explains something’s being valuable is not\nits being good but rather its having whatever non-value property it is\nupon which its goodness supervenes; they claim that it is because of\nthis underlying property that the thing in question is\n“both” good and valuable (Ewing 1948, pp. 157 and 172. Cf.\nLemos 1994, p. 19). Thomas Scanlon calls such an account of the\nrelation between valuableness, goodness, and underlying properties a\nbuck-passing account, since it “passes the buck” of\nexplaining why something is such that it is fitting to value it from\nits goodness to some property that underlies its goodness (Scanlon\n1998, pp. 95 ff.). Whether such an account is acceptable has recently\nbeen the subject of intense debate. Many, like Scanlon, endorse\npassing the buck; some, like Blanshard, object to doing so. If such an\naccount is acceptable, then Ewing’s analysis survives\nBlanshard’s challenge; but otherwise not. (Note that one might\nendorse passing the buck and yet reject Ewing’s analysis for\nsome other reason. Hence a buck-passer may, but need not, accept the\nanalysis. Indeed, there is reason to think that Moore himself is a\nbuck-passer, even though he takes the concept of intrinsic goodness to\nbe unanalyzable; cf. Olson 2006). \nEven if Blanshard’s argument succeeds and intrinsic goodness is\nnot to be analyzed in terms of the fittingness of some pro\nattitude, it could still be that there is a strict\ncorrelation between something’s being intrinsically good\nand its being such that it is fitting to value it for its own sake;\nthat is, it could still be both that (a) it is necessarily true that\nwhatever is intrinsically good is such that it is fitting to value it\nfor its own sake, and that (b) it is necessarily true that whatever it\nis fitting to value for its own sake is intrinsically good. If this\nwere the case, it would reveal an important feature of intrinsic\nvalue, recognition of which would help us to improve our understanding\nof the concept. However, this thesis has also been challenged. \nKrister Bykvist has argued that what he calls solitary goods may\nconstitute a counterexample to part (a) of the thesis (Bykvist 2009,\npp. 4 ff.). Such (alleged) goods consist in states of affairs that\nentail that there is no one in a position to value them. Suppose, for\nexample, that happiness is intrinsically good, and good in such a way\nthat it is fitting to welcome it. Then, more particularly, the state\nof affairs of there being happy egrets is intrinsically good; so too,\npresumably, is the more complex state of affairs of there being happy\negrets but no welcomers. The simpler state of affairs would appear to\npose no problem for part (a) of the thesis, but the more complex state\nof affairs, which is an example of a solitary good, may pose a\nproblem. For if to welcome a state of affairs entails that that state\nof affairs obtains, then welcoming the more complex state of affairs\nis logically impossible. Furthermore, if to welcome a state of affairs\nentails that one believes that that state of affairs obtains, then the\npertinent belief regarding the more complex state of affairs would be\nnecessarily false. In neither case would it seem plausible to say that\nwelcoming the state of affairs is nonetheless fitting. Thus, unless\nthis challenge can somehow be met, a proponent of the thesis must\nrestrict the thesis to pro attitudes that are neither truth- nor\nbelief-entailing, a restriction that might itself prove unwelcome,\nsince it excludes a number of favorable responses to what is good\n(such as promoting what is good, or taking pleasure in what is good)\nto which proponents of the thesis have often appealed. \nAs to part (b) of the thesis: some philosophers have argued that it\ncan be fitting to value something for its own sake even if that thing\nis not intrinsically good. A relatively early version of this argument\nwas again provided by Blanshard (1961, pp. 287 ff. Cf. Lemos 1994, p.\n18). Recently the issue has been brought into stark relief by the\nfollowing sort of thought-experiment. Imagine that an evil demon wants\nyou to value him for his own sake and threatens to cause you severe\nsuffering unless you do. It seems that you have good reason to do what\nhe wants—it is appropriate or fitting to comply with his demand\nand value him for his own sake—even though he is clearly not\nintrinsically good (Rabinowicz and Rønnow-Rasmussen 2004, pp.\n402 ff.). This issue, which has come to be known as “the wrong\nkind of reason problem,” has attracted a great deal of\nattention. Some have been persuaded that the challenge succeeds, while\nothers have sought to undermine it. \nOne final cautionary note. It is apparent that some philosophers use\nthe term “intrinsic value” and similar terms to express\nsome concept other than the one just discussed. In particular,\nImmanuel Kant [1724–1804] is famous for saying that the only\nthing that is “good without qualification” is a good will,\nwhich is good not because of what it effects or accomplishes but\n“in itself” (Kant 1785, Ak. 1–3). This may seem to\nsuggest that Kant ascribes (positive) intrinsic value only to a good\nwill, declaring the value that anything else may possess merely\nextrinsic, in the senses of “intrinsic value” and\n“extrinsic value” discussed above. This suggestion is, if\nanything, reinforced when Kant immediately adds that a good will\n“is to be esteemed beyond comparison as far higher than anything\nit could ever bring about,” that it “shine[s] like a jewel\nfor its own sake,” and that its “usefulness…can\nneither add to, nor subtract from, [its] value.” For here Kant\nmay seem not only to be invoking the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic value but also to be in agreement with Brentano et\nal. regarding the characterization of the former in terms of the\nfittingness of some attitude, namely, esteem. (The term\n“respect” is often used in place of “esteem”\nin such contexts.) Nonetheless, it becomes clear on further inspection\nthat Kant is in fact discussing a concept quite different from that\nwith which this article is concerned. A little later on he says that\nall rational beings, even those that lack a good will, have\n“absolute value”; such beings are “ends in\nthemselves” that have a “dignity” or\n“intrinsic value” that is “above all price”\n(Kant 1785, Ak. 64 and 77). Such talk indicates that Kant believes\nthat the sort of value that he ascribes to rational beings is one that\nthey possess to an infinite degree. But then, if this were understood\nas a thesis about intrinsic value as we have been understanding this\nconcept, the implication would seem to be that, since it contains\nrational beings, ours is the best of all possible\n worlds.[4]\n Yet this is a thesis that Kant, along with many others, explicitly\nrejects elsewhere (Kant, Lectures in Ethics). It seems best\nto understand Kant, and other philosophers who have since written in\nthe same vein (cf. Anderson 1993), as being concerned not with the\nquestion of what intrinsic value rational beings have—in the\nsense of “intrinsic value” discussed above—but with\nthe quite different question of how we ought to behave toward such\ncreatures (cf. Bradley 2006). \nIn the history of philosophy, relatively few seem to have entertained\ndoubts about the concept of intrinsic value. Much of the debate about\nintrinsic value has tended to be about what things actually do have\nsuch value. However, once questions about the concept itself were\nraised, doubts about its metaphysical implications, its moral\nsignificance, and even its very coherence began to appear. \nConsider, first, the metaphysics underlying ascriptions of intrinsic\nvalue. It seems safe to say that, before the twentieth century, most\nmoral philosophers presupposed that the intrinsic goodness of\nsomething is a genuine property of that thing, one that is no less\nreal than the properties (of being pleasant, of satisfying a need, or\nwhatever) in virtue of which the thing in question is good. (Several\ndissented from this view, however. Especially well known for their\ndissent are Thomas Hobbes [1588–1679], who believed the goodness\nor badness of something to be constituted by the desire or aversion\nthat one may have regarding it, and David Hume [1711–1776], who\nsimilarly took all ascriptions of value to involve projections of\none’s own sentiments onto whatever is said to have value. See\nHobbes 1651, Hume 1739.) It was not until Moore argued that this view\nimplies that intrinsic goodness, as a supervening property, is a very\ndifferent sort of property (one that he called\n“nonnatural”) from those (which he called\n“natural”) upon which it supervenes, that doubts about the\nview proliferated. \nOne of the first to raise such doubts and to press for a view quite\ndifferent from the prevailing view was Axel Hägerström\n[1868–1939], who developed an account according to which\nascriptions of value are neither true nor false (Hägerström\n1953). This view has come to be called “noncognitivism.”\nThe particular brand of noncognitivism proposed by\nHägerström is usually called “emotivism,” since\nit holds (in a manner reminiscent of Hume) that ascriptions of value\nare in essence expressions of emotion. (For example, an emotivist of a\nparticularly simple kind might claim that to say “A is\ngood” is not to make a statement about A but to say\nsomething like “Hooray for A!”) This view was\ntaken up by several philosophers, including most notably A. J. Ayer\n[1910–1989] and Charles L. Stevenson [1908–1979] (see Ayer\n1946, Stevenson 1944). Other philosophers have since embraced other\nforms of noncognitivism. R. M. Hare [1919–2002], for example,\nadvocated the theory of “prescriptivism” (according to\nwhich moral judgments, including judgments about goodness and badness,\nare not descriptive statements about the world but rather constitute a\nkind of command as to how we are to act; see Hare 1952) and Simon\nBlackburn and Allan Gibbard have since proposed yet other versions of\nnoncognitivism (Blackburn 1984, Gibbard 1990). \nHägerström characterized his own view as a type of\n“value-nihilism,” and many have followed suit in taking\nnoncognitivism of all kinds to constitute a rejection of the very idea\nof intrinsic value. But this seems to be a mistake. We should\ndistinguish questions about value from questions about\nevaluation. Questions about value fall into two main groups,\nconceptual (of the sort discussed in the last section) and\nsubstantive (of the sort discussed in the first section).\nQuestions about evaluation have to do with what precisely is going on\nwhen we ascribe value to something. Cognitivists claim that\nour ascriptions of value constitute statements that are either true or\nfalse; noncognitivists deny this. But even noncognitivists must\nrecognize that our ascriptions of value fall into two fundamental\nclasses—ascriptions of intrinsic value and ascriptions of\nextrinsic value—and so they too must concern themselves with the\nvery same conceptual and substantive questions about value as\ncognitivists address. It may be that noncognitivism dictates or rules\nout certain answers to these questions that cognitivism does not, but\nthat is of course quite a different matter from rejecting the very\nidea of intrinsic value on metaphysical grounds. \nAnother type of metaphysical challenge to intrinsic value stems from\nthe theory of “pragmatism,” especially in the form\nadvanced by John Dewey [1859–1952] (see Dewey 1922). According\nto the pragmatist, the world is constantly changing in such a way that\nthe solution to one problem becomes the source of another, what is an\nend in one context is a means in another, and thus it is a mistake to\nseek or offer a timeless list of intrinsic goods and evils, of ends to\nbe achieved or avoided for their own sakes. This theme has been\nelaborated by Monroe Beardsley, who attacks the very notion of\nintrinsic value (Beardsley 1965; cf. Conee 1982). Denying that the\nexistence of something with extrinsic value presupposes the existence\nof something else with intrinsic value, Beardsley argues that all\nvalue is extrinsic. (In the course of his argument, Beardsley rejects\nthe sort of “dialectical demonstration” of intrinsic value\nthat was attempted in the last section, when an explanation of the\nderivative value of helping others was given in terms of some\nnonderivative value.) A quick response to Beardsley’s misgivings\nabout intrinsic value would be to admit that it may well be that, the\nworld being as complex as it is, nothing is such that its value is\nwholly intrinsic; perhaps whatever has intrinsic value also has\nextrinsic value, and of course many things that have extrinsic value\nwill have no (or, at least, neutral) intrinsic value. Far from\nrepudiating the notion of intrinsic value, though, this admission\nwould confirm its legitimacy. But Beardsley would insist that this\nquick response misses the point of his attack, and that it really is\nthe case, not just that whatever has value has extrinsic value, but\nalso that nothing has intrinsic value. His argument for this view is\nbased on the claim that the concept of intrinsic value is\n“inapplicable,” in that, even if something had such value,\nwe could not know this and hence its having such value could play no\nrole in our reasoning about value. But here Beardsley seems to be\noverreaching. Even if it were the case that we cannot know\nwhether something has intrinsic value, this of course leaves open the\nquestion whether anything does have such value. And even if\nit could somehow be shown that nothing does have such value,\nthis would still leave open the question whether something\ncould have such value. If the answer to this last question is\n“yes,” then the legitimacy of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue is in fact confirmed rather than refuted. \nAs has been noted, some philosophers do indeed doubt the legitimacy,\nthe very coherence, of the concept of intrinsic value. Before we turn\nto a discussion of this issue, however, let us for the moment presume\nthat the concept is coherent and address a different sort of doubt:\nthe doubt that the concept has any great moral significance. Recall\nthe suggestion, mentioned in the last section, that discussions of\nintrinsic value may have been compromised by a failure to distinguish\ncertain concepts. This suggestion is at the heart of Christine\nKorsgaard’s “Two Distinctions in Goodness”\n(Korsgaard 1983). Korsgaard notes that “intrinsic value”\nhas traditionally been contrasted with “instrumental\nvalue” (the value that something has in virtue of being a means\nto an end) and claims that this approach is misleading. She contends\nthat “instrumental value” is to be contrasted with\n“final value,” that is, the value that something has as an\nend or for its own sake; however, “intrinsic value” (the\nvalue that something has in itself, that is, in virtue of its\nintrinsic, nonrelational properties) is to be contrasted with\n“extrinsic value” (the value that something has in virtue\nof its extrinsic, relational properties). (An example of a\nnonrelational property is the property of being round; an example of a\nrelational property is the property of being loved.) As an\nillustration of final value, Korsgaard suggests that gorgeously\nenameled frying pans are, in virtue of the role they play in our\nlives, good for their own sakes. In like fashion, Beardsley wonders\nwhether a rare stamp may be good for its own sake (Beardsley 1965);\nShelly Kagan says that the pen that Abraham Lincoln used to sign the\nEmancipation Proclamation may well be good for its own sake (Kagan\n1998); and others have offered similar examples (cf. Rabinowicz and\nRønnow-Rasmussen 1999 and 2003). Notice that in each case the\nvalue being attributed to the object in question is (allegedly) had in\nvirtue of some extrinsic property of the object. This puts\nthe moral significance of intrinsic value into question,\nsince (as is apparent from our discussion so far) it is with the\nnotion of something’s being valuable for its own sake that\nphilosophers have traditionally been, and continue to be, primarily\nconcerned. \nThere is an important corollary to drawing a distinction between\nintrinsic value and final value (and between extrinsic value and\nnonfinal value), and that is that, contrary to what Korsgaard herself\ninitially says, it may be a mistake to contrast final value with\ninstrumental value. If it is possible, as Korsgaard claims, that final\nvalue sometimes supervenes on extrinsic properties, then it might be\npossible that it sometimes supervenes in particular on the property of\nbeing a means to some other end. Indeed, Korsgaard herself suggests\nthis when she says that “certain kinds of things, such as\nluxurious instruments, … are valued for their own sakes under\nthe condition of their usefulness” (Korsgaard 1983, p. 185).\nKagan also tentatively endorses this idea. If the idea is coherent,\nthen we should in principle distinguish two kinds of instrumental\nvalue, one final and the other\n nonfinal.[5]\n If something A is a means to something else B and\nhas instrumental value in virtue of this fact, such value will be\nnonfinal if it is merely derivative from or reflective of\nB’s value, whereas it will be final if it is\nnonderivative, that is, if it is a value that A has in its\nown right (due to the fact that it is a means to B),\nirrespective of any value that B may or may not have in\nits own right. \nEven if it is agreed that it is final value that is central to the\nconcerns of moral philosophers, we should be careful in drawing the\nconclusion that intrinsic value is not central to their concerns.\nFirst, there is no necessity that the term “intrinsic\nvalue” be reserved for the value that something has in virtue of\nits intrinsic properties; presumably it has been used by many writers\nsimply to refer to what Korsgaard calls final value, in which case the\nmoral significance of (what is thus called) intrinsic value has of\ncourse not been thrown into doubt. Nonetheless, it should probably be\nconceded that “final value” is a more suitable term than\n“intrinsic value” to refer to the sort of value in\nquestion, since the latter term certainly does suggest value that\nsupervenes on intrinsic properties. But here a second point can be\nmade, and that is that, even if use of the term “intrinsic\nvalue” is restricted accordingly, it is arguable that, contrary\nto Korsgaard’s contention, all final value does after all\nsupervene on intrinsic properties alone; if that were the case, there\nwould seem to be no reason not to continue to use the term\n“intrinsic value” to refer to final value. Whether this is\nin fact the case depends in part on just what sort of thing\ncan be valuable for its own sake—an issue to be taken\nup in the next section. \nIn light of the matter just discussed, we must now decide what\nterminology to adopt. It is clear that moral philosophers since\nancient times have been concerned with the distinction between the\nvalue that something has for its own sake (the sort of nonderivative\nvalue that Korsgaard calls “final value”) and the value\nthat something has for the sake of something else to which it is\nrelated in some way. However, given the weight of tradition, it seems\njustifiable, perhaps even advisable, to continue, despite\nKorsgaard’s misgivings, to use the terms “intrinsic\nvalue” and “extrinsic value” to refer to these two\ntypes of value; if we do so, however, we should explicitly note that\nthis practice is not itself intended to endorse, or reject, the view\nthat intrinsic value supervenes on intrinsic properties alone. \nLet us now turn to doubts about the very coherence of the concept of\nintrinsic value, so understood. In Principia Ethica and\nelsewhere, Moore embraces the consequentialist view, mentioned above,\nthat whether an action is morally right or wrong turns exclusively on\nwhether its consequences are intrinsically better than those of its\nalternatives. Some philosophers have recently argued that ascribing\nintrinsic value to consequences in this way is fundamentally\nmisconceived. Peter Geach, for example, argues that Moore makes a\nserious mistake when comparing “good” with\n “yellow.”[6]\n Moore says that both terms express unanalyzable concepts but are to\nbe distinguished in that, whereas the latter refers to a natural\nproperty, the former refers to a nonnatural one. Geach contends that\nthere is a mistaken assimilation underlying Moore’s remarks,\nsince “good” in fact operates in a way quite unlike that\nof “yellow”—something that Moore wholly overlooks.\nThis contention would appear to be confirmed by the observation that\nthe phrase “x is a yellow bird” splits up\nlogically (as Geach puts it) into the phrase “x is a\nbird and x is yellow,” whereas the phrase\n“x is a good singer” does not split up in the\nsame way. Also, from “x is a yellow bird” and\n“a bird is an animal” we do not hesitate to infer\n“x is a yellow animal,” whereas no similar\ninference seems warranted in the case of “x is a good\nsinger” and “a singer is a person.” On the basis of\nthese observations Geach concludes that nothing can be good in the\nfree-standing way that Moore alleges; rather, whatever is good is good\nrelative to a certain kind. \nJudith Thomson has recently elaborated on Geach’s thesis\n(Thomson 1997). Although she does not unqualifiedly agree that\nwhatever is good is good relative to a certain kind, she does claim\nthat whatever is good is good in some way; nothing can be “just\nplain good,” as she believes Moore would have it. Philippa Foot,\namong others, has made a similar charge (Foot 1985). It is a charge\nthat has been rebutted by Michael Zimmerman, who argues that\nGeach’s tests are less straightforward than they may seem and\nfail after all to reveal a significant distinction between the ways in\nwhich “good” and “yellow” operate (Zimmerman\n2001, ch. 2). He argues further that Thomson mischaracterizes\nMoore’s conception of intrinsic value. According to Moore, he\nclaims, what is intrinsically good is not “just plain\ngood”; rather, it is good in a particular way, in keeping with\nThomson’s thesis that all goodness is goodness in a way. He\nmaintains that, for Moore and other proponents of intrinsic value,\nsuch value is a particular kind of moral value. Mahrad\nAlmotahari and Adam Hosein have revived Geach’s challenge\n(Almotahari and Hosein 2015). They argue that if, contrary to Geach,\n“good” could be used predicatively, we would be able to\nuse the term predicatively in sentences of the form ‘a is\na good K’ but, they argue, the linguistic evidence\nindicates that we cannot do so (Almotahari and Hosein 2015,\n1493–4).  \nAmong those who do not doubt the coherence of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue there is considerable difference of opinion about what sort or\nsorts of entity can have such value. Moore does not explicitly address\nthis issue, but his writings show him to have a liberal view on the\nmatter. There are times when he talks of individual objects (e.g.,\nbooks) as having intrinsic value, others when he talks of the\nconsciousness of individual objects (or of their qualities) as having\nintrinsic value, others when he talks of the existence of individual\nobjects as having intrinsic value, others when he talks of types of\nindividual objects as having intrinsic value, and still others when he\ntalks of states of individual objects as having intrinsic value. \nMoore would thus appear to be a “pluralist” concerning the\nbearers of intrinsic value. Others take a more conservative,\n“monistic” approach, according to which there is just one\nkind of bearer of intrinsic value. Consider, for example,\nFrankena’s long list of intrinsic goods, presented in Section 1\nabove: life, consciousness, etc. To what kind(s) of entity do\nsuch terms refer? Various answers have been given. Some (such as\nPanayot Butchvarov) claim that it is properties that are the\nbearers of intrinsic value (Butchvarov 1989, pp. 14–15). On this\nview, Frankena’s list implies that it is the properties of being\nalive, being conscious, and so on, that are intrinsically good. Others\n(such as Chisholm) claim that it is states of affairs that\nare the bearers of intrinsic value (Chisholm 1968–69, 1972,\n1975). On this view, Frankena’s list implies that it is the\nstates of affairs of someone (or something) being alive, someone being\nconscious, and so on, that are intrinsically good. Still others (such\nas Ross) claim that it is facts that are the bearers of\nintrinsic value (Ross 1930, pp. 112–13; cf. Lemos 1994, ch. 2).\nOn this view, Frankena’s list implies that it is the facts that\nsomeone (or something) is alive, that someone is conscious, and so on,\nthat are intrinsically good. (The difference between Chisholm’s\nand Ross’s views would seem to be this: whereas Chisholm would\nascribe intrinsic value even to states of affairs, such as that of\neveryone being happy, that do not obtain, Ross would ascribe such\nvalue only to states of affairs that do obtain.) \nOntologists often divide entities into two fundamental classes, those\nthat are abstract and those that are concrete. Unfortunately, there is\nno consensus on just how this distinction is to be drawn. Most\nphilosophers would classify the sorts of entities just mentioned\n(properties, states of affairs, and facts) as abstract. So understood,\nthe claim that intrinsic value is borne by such entities is to be\ndistinguished from the claim that it is borne by certain other closely\nrelated entities that are often classified as concrete. For example,\nit has recently been suggested that it is tropes that have intrinsic\n value.[7]\n Tropes are supposed to be a sort of particularized property, a kind\nof property-instance (rather than simply a property). (Thus the\nparticular whiteness of a particular piece of paper is to be\ndistinguished, on this view, from the property of whiteness.) It has\nalso been suggested that it is states, understood as a kind of\ninstance of states of affairs, that have intrinsic value (cf.\nZimmerman 2001, ch. 3). \nThose who make monistic proposals of the sort just mentioned are aware\nthat intrinsic value is sometimes ascribed to kinds of entities\ndifferent from those favored by their proposals. They claim that all\nsuch ascriptions can be reduced to, or translated into, ascriptions of\nintrinsic value of the sort they deem proper. Consider, for example,\nKorsgaard’s suggestion that a gorgeously enameled frying pan is\ngood for its own sake. Ross would say that this cannot be the case. If\nthere is any intrinsic value to be found here, it will, according to\nRoss, not reside in the pan itself but in the fact that it plays a\ncertain role in our lives, or perhaps in the fact that something plays\nthis role, or in the fact that something that plays this role exists.\n(Others would make other translations in the terms that they deem\nappropriate.) On the basis of this ascription of intrinsic value to\nsome fact, Ross could go on to ascribe a kind of extrinsic\nvalue to the pan itself, in virtue of its relation to the fact in\nquestion. \nWhether reduction of this sort is acceptable has been a matter of\nconsiderable debate. Proponents of monism maintain that it introduces\nsome much-needed order into the discussion of intrinsic value,\nclarifying just what is involved in the ascription of such value and\nsimplifying the computation of such value—on which point, see\nthe next section. (A corollary of some monistic approaches is that the\nvalue that something has for its own sake supervenes on the intrinsic\nproperties of that thing, so that there is a perfect convergence of\nthe two sorts of values that Korsgaard calls “final” and\n“intrinsic”. On this point, see the last section;\nZimmerman 2001, ch. 3; Tucker 2016; and Tucker (forthcoming).)\nOpponents argue that reduction results in distortion and\noversimplification; they maintain that, even if there is intrinsic\nvalue to be found in such a fact as that a gorgeously enameled frying\npan plays a certain role in our lives, there may yet be\nintrinsic, and not merely extrinsic, value to be found in the\npan itself and perhaps also in its existence (cf. Rabinowicz and\nRønnow-Rasmussen 1999 and 2003). Some propose a compromise\naccording to which the kind of intrinsic value that can sensibly be\nascribed to individual objects like frying pans is not the same kind\nof intrinsic value that is the topic of this article and can sensibly\nbe ascribed to items of the sort on Frankena’s list (cf. Bradley\n2006). (See again the cautionary note in the final paragraph of\nSection 2 above.) \nIn our assessments of intrinsic value, we are often and understandably\nconcerned not only with whether something is good or bad but\nwith how good or bad it is. Arriving at an answer to the\nlatter question is not straightforward. At least three problems\nthreaten to undermine the computation of intrinsic value. \nFirst, there is the possibility that the relation of intrinsic\nbetterness is not transitive (that is, the possibility that something\nA is intrinsically better than something else B,\nwhich is itself intrinsically better than some third thing C,\nand yet A is not intrinsically better than C).\nDespite the very natural assumption that this relation is transitive,\nit has been argued that it is not (Rachels 1998; Temkin 1987, 1997,\n2012). Should this in fact be the case, it would seriously complicate\ncomparisons, and hence assessments, of intrinsic value. \nSecond, there is the possibility that certain values are\nincommensurate. For example, Ross at one point contends that it is\nimpossible to compare the goodness of pleasure with that of virtue.\nWhereas he had suggested in The Right and the Good that\npleasure and virtue could be measured on the same scale of goodness,\nin Foundations of Ethics he declares this to be impossible,\nsince (he claims) it would imply that pleasure of a certain intensity,\nenjoyed by a sufficient number of people or for a sufficient time,\nwould counterbalance virtue possessed or manifested only by a small\nnumber of people or only for a short time; and this he professes to be\nincredible (Ross 1939, p. 275). But there is some confusion here. In\nclaiming that virtue and pleasure are incommensurate for the reason\ngiven, Ross presumably means that they cannot be measured on the same\nratio scale. (A ratio scale is one with an arbitrary unit but\na fixed zero point. Mass and length are standardly measured on ratio\nscales.) But incommensurability on a ratio scale does not imply\nincommensurability on every scale—an ordinal scale, for\ninstance. (An ordinal scale is simply one that supplies an ordering\nfor the quantity in question, such as the measurement of arm-strength\nthat is provided by an arm-wrestling competition.) Ross’s\nremarks indicate that he in fact believes that virtue and pleasure\nare commensurate on an ordinal scale, since he appears to\nsubscribe to the arch-puritanical view that any amount of virtue is\nintrinsically better than any amount of pleasure. This view is just\none example of the thesis that some goods are “higher”\nthan others, in the sense that any amount of the former is better than\nany amount of the latter. This thesis can be traced to the ancient\nGreeks (Plato, Philebus, 21a-e; Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics, 1174a), and it has been endorsed by many philosophers\nsince, perhaps most famously by Mill (Mill 1863, paras. 4 ff).\nInterest in the thesis has recently been revived by a set of intricate\nand intriguing puzzles, posed by Derek Parfit, concerning the relative\nvalues of low-quantity/high-quality goods and\nhigh-quantity/low-quality goods (Parfit 1984, Part IV). One response\nto these puzzles (eschewed by Parfit himself) is to adopt the thesis\nof the nontransitivity of intrinsic betterness. Another is to insist\non the thesis that some goods are higher than others. Such a response\ndoes not by itself solve the puzzles that Parfit raises, but, to the\nextent that it helps, it does so at the cost of once again\ncomplicating the computation of intrinsic value. \nTo repeat: contrary to what Ross says, the thesis that some goods are\nhigher than others implies that such goods are commensurate, and not\nthat they are incommensurate. Some people do hold, however, that\ncertain values really are incommensurate and thus cannot be compared\non any meaningful scale. (Isaiah Berlin [1909–1997], for\nexample, is often thought to have said this about the values of\nliberty and equality. Whether he is best interpreted in this way is\ndebatable. See Berlin 1969.) This view constitutes a more radical\nthreat to the computation of intrinsic value than does the view that\nintrinsic betterness is not transitive. The latter view presupposes at\nleast some measure of commensurability. If A is better than\nB and B is better than C, then A\nis commensurate with B and B is commensurate with\nC; and even if it should turn out that A is not\nbetter than C, it may still be that A is\ncommensurate with C, either because it is as good as\nC or because it is worse than C. But if A\nis incommensurate with B, then A is neither better\nthan nor as good as nor worse than B. (Some claim, however,\nthat the reverse does not hold and that, even if A is neither\nbetter than nor as good as nor worse than B, still A\nmay be “on a par” with B and thus be roughly\ncomparable with it. Cf. Chang 1997, 2002.) If such a case can arise,\nthere is an obvious limit to the extent to which we can meaningfully\nsay how good a certain complex whole is (here, “whole” is\nused to refer to whatever kind of entity may have intrinsic value);\nfor, if such a whole comprises incommensurate goods A and\nB, then there will be no way of establishing just how good it\nis overall, even if there is a way of establishing how good it is with\nrespect to each of A and B. \nThere is a third, still more radical threat to the computation of\nintrinsic value. Quite apart from any concern with the\ncommensurability of values, Moore famously claims that there is no\neasy formula for the determination of the intrinsic value of complex\nwholes because of the truth of what he calls the “principle of\norganic unities” (Moore 1903, p. 96). According to this\nprinciple, the intrinsic value of a whole must not be assumed to be\nthe same as the sum of the intrinsic values of its parts (Moore 1903,\np. 28) As an example of an organic unity, Moore gives the case of the\nconsciousness of a beautiful object; he says that this has great\nintrinsic value, even though the consciousness as such and the\nbeautiful object as such each have comparatively little, if any,\nintrinsic value. If the principle of organic unities is true, then\nthere is scant hope of a systematic approach to the computation of\nintrinsic value. Although the principle explicitly rules out only\nsummation as a method of computation, Moore’s remarks strongly\nsuggest that there is no relation between the parts of a whole and the\nwhole itself that holds in general and in terms of which the value of\nthe latter can be computed by aggregating (whether by summation or by\nsome other means) the values of the former. Moore’s position has\nbeen endorsed by many other philosophers. For example, Ross says that\nit is better that one person be good and happy and another bad and\nunhappy than that the former be good and unhappy and the latter bad\nand happy, and he takes this to be confirmation of Moore’s\nprinciple (Ross 1930, p. 72). Broad takes organic unities of the sort\nthat Moore discusses to be just one instance of a more general\nphenomenon that he believes to be at work in many other situations, as\nwhen, for example, two tunes, each pleasing in its own right, make for\na cacophonous combination (Broad 1985, p. 256). Others have furnished\nstill further examples of organic unities (Chisholm 1986, ch. 7; Lemos\n1994, chs. 3 and 4, and 1998; Hurka 1998). \nWas Moore the first to call attention to the phenomenon of organic\nunities in the context of intrinsic value? This is debatable. Despite\nthe fact that he explicitly invoked what he called a “principle\nof summation” that would appear to be inconsistent with the\nprinciple of organic unities, Brentano appears nonetheless to have\nanticipated Moore’s principle in his discussion of\nSchadenfreude, that is, of malicious pleasure; he condemns\nsuch an attitude, even though he claims that pleasure as such is\nintrinsically good (Brentano 1969, p. 23 n). Certainly Chisholm takes\nBrentano to be an advocate of organic unities (Chisholm 1986, ch. 5),\nascribing to him the view that there are many kinds of organic unity\nand building on what he takes to be Brentano’s insights (and,\ngoing further back in the history of philosophy, the insights of St.\nThomas Aquinas [1225–1274] and others). \nRecently, a special spin has been put on the principle of organic\nunities by so-called “particularists.” Jonathan Dancy, for\nexample, has claimed (in keeping with Korsgaard and others mentioned\nin Section 3 above), that something’s intrinsic value need not\nsupervene on its intrinsic properties alone; in fact, the\nsupervenience-base may be so open-ended that it resists\ngeneralization. The upshot, according to Dancy, is that the intrinsic\nvalue of something may vary from context to context; indeed, the\nvariation may be so great that the thing’s value changes\n“polarity” from good to bad, or vice versa (Dancy\n2000). This approach to value constitutes an endorsement of the\nprinciple of organic unities that is even more subversive of the\ncomputation of intrinsic value than Moore’s; for Moore holds\nthat the intrinsic value of something is and must be constant, even if\nits contribution to the value of wholes of which it forms a part is\nnot, whereas Dancy holds that variation can occur at both levels. \nNot everyone has accepted the principle of organic unities; some have\nheld out hope for a more systematic approach to the computation of\nintrinsic value. However, even someone who is inclined to measure\nintrinsic value in terms of summation must acknowledge that there is a\nsense in which the principle of organic unities is obviously true.\nConsider some complex whole, W, that is composed of three\ngoods, X, Y, and Z, which are wholly\nindependent of one another. Suppose that we had a ratio scale on which\nto measure these goods, and that their values on this scale were 10,\n20, and 30, respectively. We would expect someone who takes intrinsic\nvalue to be summative to declare the value of W to be (10 +\n20 + 30 =) 60. But notice that, if X, Y, and\nZ are parts of W, then so too, presumably, are the\ncombinations X-and-Y, X-and-Z, and\nY-and-Z; the values of these combinations, computed\nin terms of summation, will be 30, 40, and 50, respectively. If the\nvalues of these parts of W were also taken into consideration\nwhen evaluating W, the value of W would balloon to\n180. Clearly, this would be a distortion. Someone who wishes to\nmaintain that intrinsic value is summative must thus show not only how\nthe various alleged examples of organic unities provided by Moore and\nothers are to be reinterpreted, but also how, in the sort of case just\nsketched, it is only the values of X, Y, and\nZ, and not the values either of any combinations of these\ncomponents or of any parts of these components, that are to be taken\ninto account when evaluating W itself. In order to bring some\nsemblance of manageability to the computation of intrinsic value, this\nis precisely what some writers, by appealing to the idea of\n“basic” intrinsic value, have tried to do. The general\nidea is this. In the sort of example just given, each of X,\nY, and Z is to be construed as having basic\nintrinsic value; if any combinations or parts of X,\nY, and Z have intrinsic value, this value is not\nbasic; and the value of W is to be computed by appealing only\nto those parts of W that have basic intrinsic value. \nGilbert Harman was one of the first explicitly to discuss basic\nintrinsic value when he pointed out the apparent need to invoke such\nvalue if we are to avoid distortions in our evaluations (Harman 1967).\nHowever, he offers no precise account of the concept of basic\nintrinsic value and ends his paper by saying that he can think of no\nway to show that nonbasic intrinsic value is to be computed in terms\nof the summation of basic intrinsic value. Several philosophers have\nsince tried to do better. Many have argued that nonbasic intrinsic\nvalue cannot always be computed by summing basic intrinsic\nvalue. Suppose that states of affairs can bear intrinsic value. Let\nX be the state of affairs of John being pleased to a certain\ndegree x, and Y be the state of affairs of Jane\nbeing displeased to a certain degree y, and suppose that\nX has a basic intrinsic value of 10 and Y a basic\nintrinsic value of −20. It seems reasonable to sum these values\nand attribute an intrinsic value of −10 to the conjunctive state\nof affairs X&Y. But what of the disjunctive state of\naffairs XvY or the negative state of affairs ~X? How\nare their intrinsic values to be computed? Summation seems to\nbe a nonstarter in these cases. Nonetheless, attempts have been made\neven in such cases to show how the intrinsic value of a complex whole\nis to be computed in a nonsummative way in terms of the basic\nintrinsic values of simpler states, thus preserving the idea that\nbasic intrinsic value is the key to the computation of all intrinsic\nvalue (Quinn 1974, Chisholm 1975, Oldfield 1977, Carlson 1997). (These\nattempts have generally been based on the assumption that states of\naffairs are the sole bearers of intrinsic value. Matters\nwould be considerably more complicated if it turned out that entities\nof several different ontological categories could all have intrinsic\nvalue.) \nSuggestions as to how to compute nonbasic intrinsic value in terms of\nbasic intrinsic value of course presuppose that there is such a thing\nas basic intrinsic value, but few have attempted to provide an account\nof what basic intrinsic value itself consists in. Fred Feldman is one\nof the few (Feldman 2000; cf. Feldman 1997, pp. 116–18).\nSubscribing to the view that only states of affairs bear intrinsic\nvalue, Feldman identifies several features that any state of affairs\nthat has basic intrinsic value in particular must possess. He\nmaintains, for example, that whatever has basic intrinsic value must\nhave it to a determinate degree and that this value cannot be\n“defeated” by any Moorean organic unity. In this way,\nFeldman seeks to preserve the idea that intrinsic value is summative\nafter all. He does not claim that all intrinsic value is to be\ncomputed by summing basic intrinsic value, but he does insist that the\nvalue of entire worlds is to be computed in this way. \nDespite the detail in which Feldman characterizes the concept of basic\nintrinsic value, he offers no strict analysis of it. Others have tried\nto supply such an analysis. For example, by noting that, even if it is\ntrue that only states have intrinsic value, it may yet be that not all\nstates have intrinsic value, Zimmerman suggests (to put matters\nsomewhat roughly) that basic intrinsic value is the intrinsic value\nhad by states none of whose proper parts have intrinsic value\n(Zimmerman 2001, ch. 5). On this basis he argues that disjunctive and\nnegative states in fact have no intrinsic value at all, and thereby\nseeks to show how all intrinsic value is to be computed in terms of\nsummation after all. \nTwo final points. First, we are now in a position to see why it was\nsaid above (in Section 2) that perhaps not all intrinsic value is\nnonderivative. If it is correct to distinguish between basic and\nnonbasic intrinsic value and also to compute the latter in terms of\nthe former, then there is clearly a respectable sense in which\nnonbasic intrinsic value is derivative. Second, if states with basic\nintrinsic value account for all the value that there is in the world,\nsupport is found for Chisholm’s view (reported in Section 2)\nthat some ontological version of Moore’s isolation test is\nacceptable. \nAt the beginning of this article, extrinsic value was said\nsimply—too simply—to be value that is not intrinsic.\nLater, once intrinsic value had been characterized as nonderivative\nvalue of a certain, perhaps moral kind, extrinsic value was said more\nparticularly to be derivative value of that same kind. That\nwhich is extrinsically good is good, not (insofar as its extrinsic\nvalue is concerned) for its own sake, but for the sake of something\nelse to which it is related in some way. For example, the goodness of\nhelping others in time of need is plausibly thought to be extrinsic\n(at least in part), being derivative (at least in part) from the\ngoodness of something else, such as these people’s needs being\nsatisfied, or their experiencing pleasure, to which helping them is\nrelated in some causal way. \nTwo questions arise. The first is whether so-called extrinsic value is\nreally a type of value at all. There would seem to be a sense in which\nit is not, for it does not add to or detract from the value in the\nworld. Consider some long chain of derivation. Suppose that the\nextrinsic value of A can be traced to the intrinsic value of\nZ by way of B, C, D… Thus\nA is good (for example) because of B, which is good\nbecause of C, and so on, until we get to Y’s\nbeing good because of Z; when it comes to Z,\nhowever, we have something that is good, not because of something\nelse, but “because of itself,” i.e., for its own sake. In\nthis sort of case, the values of A, B, …,\nY are all parasitic on the value of Z. It is\nZ’s value that contributes to the value there is in the\nworld; A, B, …, Y contribute no\nvalue of their own. (As long as the value of Z is the only\nintrinsic value at stake, no change of value would be effected in or\nimparted to the world if a shorter route from A to Z\nwere discovered, one that bypassed some letters in the middle of the\nalphabet.) \nWhy talk of “extrinsic value” at all, then? The answer can\nonly be that we just do say that certain things are good, and others\nbad, not for their own sake but for the sake of something else to\nwhich they are related in some way. To say that these things are good\nand bad only in a derivative sense, that their value is merely\nparasitic on or reflective of the value of something else, is one\nthing; to deny that they are good or bad in any respectable sense is\nquite another. The former claim is accurate; hence the latter would\nappear unwarranted. \nIf we accept that talk of “extrinsic value” can be\nappropriate, however, a second question then arises: what sort of\nrelation must obtain between A and Z if A\nis to be said to be good “because of” Z? It is\nnot clear just what the answer to this question is. Philosophers have\ntended to focus on just one particular causal relation, the means-end\nrelation. This is the relation at issue in the example given earlier:\nhelping others is a means to their needs being satisfied, which is\nitself a means to their experiencing pleasure. The term most often\nused to refer to this type of extrinsic value is “instrumental\nvalue,” although there is some dispute as to just how this term\nis to be employed. (Remember also, from Section 3 above, that on some\nviews “instrumental value” may refer to a type of\nintrinsic, or final, value.) Suppose that A is a\nmeans to Z, and that Z is intrinsically good. Should\nwe therefore say that A is instrumentally good? What if\nA has another consequence, Y, and this consequence\nis intrinsically bad? What, especially, if the intrinsic badness of\nY is greater than the intrinsic goodness of Z? Some\nwould say that in such a case A is both instrumentally good\n(because of Z) and instrumentally bad (because of\nY). Others would say that it is correct to say that\nA is instrumentally good only if all of A’s\ncausal consequences that have intrinsic value are, taken as a whole,\nintrinsically good. Still others would say that whether something is\ninstrumentally good depends not only on what it causes to happen but\nalso on what it prevents from happening (cf. Bradley 1998). For\nexample, if pain is intrinsically bad, and taking an aspirin puts a\nstop to your pain but causes nothing of any positive intrinsic value,\nsome would say that taking the aspirin is instrumentally good despite\nits having no intrinsically good consequences. \nMany philosophers write as if instrumental value is the only type of\nextrinsic value, but that is a mistake. Suppose, for instance, that\nthe results of a certain medical test indicate that the patient is in\ngood health, and suppose that this patient’s having good health\nis intrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that the results\nare themselves (extrinsically) good. But notice that the results are\nof course not a means to good health; they are simply indicative of\nit. Or suppose that making your home available to a struggling artist\nwhile you spend a year abroad provides him with an opportunity he\nwould otherwise not have to create some masterpieces, and suppose that\neither the process or the product of this creation would be\nintrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that your making your\nhome available to him is (extrinsically) good because of the\nopportunity it provides him, even if he goes on to squander the\nopportunity and nothing good comes of it. Or suppose that\nsomeone’s appreciating the beauty of the Mona Lisa\nwould be intrinsically good. Then we may well want to say that the\npainting itself has value in light of this fact, a kind of value that\nsome have called “inherent value” (Lewis 1946, p. 391; cf.\nFrankena 1973, p. 82). (“Inherent value” may not\nbe the most suitable term to use here, since it may well suggest\nintrinsic value, whereas the sort of value at issue is\nsupposed to be a type of extrinsic value. The value\nattributed to the painting is one that it is said to have in virtue of\nits relation to something else that would supposedly be intrinsically\ngood if it occurred, namely, the appreciation of its beauty.) Many\nother instances could be given of cases in which we are inclined to\ncall something good in virtue of its relation to something else that\nis or would be intrinsically good, even though the relation in\nquestion is not a means-end relation. \nOne final point. It is sometimes said that there can be no extrinsic\nvalue without intrinsic value. This thesis admits of several\ninterpretations. First, it might mean that nothing can occur that is\nextrinsically good unless something else occurs that is intrinsically\ngood, and that nothing can occur that is extrinsically bad unless\nsomething else occurs that is intrinsically bad. Second, it might mean\nthat nothing can occur that is either extrinsically good or\nextrinsically bad unless something else occurs that is either\nintrinsically good or intrinsically bad. On both these\ninterpretations, the thesis is dubious. Suppose that no one ever\nappreciates the beauty of Leonardo’s masterpiece, and that\nnothing else that is intrinsically either good or bad ever occurs;\nstill his painting may be said to be inherently good. Or suppose that\nthe aspirin prevents your pain from even starting, and hence inhibits\nthe occurrence of something intrinsically bad, but nothing else that\nis intrinsically either good or bad ever occurs; still your taking the\naspirin may be said to be instrumentally good. On a third\ninterpretation, however, the thesis might be true. That interpretation\nis this: nothing can occur that is either extrinsically good or\nextrinsically neutral or extrinsically bad unless something else\noccurs that is either intrinsically good or intrinsically neutral or\nintrinsically bad. This would be trivially true if, as some maintain,\nthe nonoccurrence of something intrinsically either good or bad\nentails the occurrence of something intrinsically neutral. But even if\nthe thesis should turn out to be false on this third interpretation,\ntoo, it would nonetheless seem to be true on a fourth interpretation,\naccording to which the concept of extrinsic value, in all its\nvarieties, is to be understood in terms of the concept of intrinsic\nvalue.","contact.mail":"wbradley@syr.edu","contact.domain":"syr.edu"}]
