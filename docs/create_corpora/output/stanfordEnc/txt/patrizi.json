[{"date.published":"2004-11-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patrizi/","author1":"Fred Purnell","entry":"patrizi","body.text":"\n\n\n\nRenaissance, Francesco Patrizi of Cherso (1529-1597) was a leading\ncritic of the dominant Aristotelianism of the times. Not to be\nconfused with the earlier humanist and political theoretician,\nFrancesco Patrizi of Siena (1413-1494), Patrizi of Cherso focused his\nattention on a wide variety of philosophical, scientific, artistic and\nliterary issues, providing in his “New Philosophy” a major\nalternative to earlier schools of thought and a model which later\nthinkers such as Galileo Galilei no doubt found valuable in developing\nthe mathematized physics which would prove the dominant force in the\nrise of early modern science. In addition, Patrizi's\nresearch into the history of ancient and medieval philosophical sources\nas an essential part of his method for establishing the legitimacy of\nhis own position would make those texts available to his contemporaries\nin a way they had never been before and serve as a model for future\ngenerations of scholars. It also emphasized the centrality of the\nstudy of the history of philosophy as an integral part of engaging in\nphilosophical investigation in its own right.\n\nBorn on the island of Cherso, or Cres, off the coast of Dalmatia,\nin 1529, Francesco Patrizi began his initial scholarly training in his\nhome city, followed by studies in Venice and Ingolstadt, before\nenrolling at the University of Padua in 1547. Although he initially\nintended to study medicine, he quickly turned to the humanities,\nlearning Greek and beginning the systematic analysis of philosophical\ntexts which would come to be the major preoccupation of his\nprofessional life. He spent seven years at Padua working with an\noutstanding faculty in Aristotelian philosophy while engaging in\ndiscussions with thinkers devoted to the study of Plato and other\nalternative philosophical sources. He later travelled to several other\nItalian cities and moved to Cyprus, where he was able to strengthen\nhis knowledge of Greek and assemble a collection of Greek manuscripts\n(Muccillo 1993). Following two excursions to Spain, during which he\nsold a major portion of his Greek manuscripts to Philip II, he was\noffered an appointment to teach Platonic philosophy at the University\nof Ferrara in 1578, a position he held until invited by Cardinal\nIppolito Aldobrandini to accept a similar assignment at the University\nof Rome, the “Sapienza”, in 1592. He spent the last years\nof his life as one of the very few philosophers teaching Platonism in\na university setting in late sixteenth-century Italy, passing away in\n1597 while still engaged in defending his controversial work,\n“The New Universal Philosophy” (Nova de universis\nphilosophia), from the theological criticisms that had led it to\nbe condemned by the Congregation of the Index shortly after it\nappeared in print in 1591. Upon his death, his chair in Platonic\nphilosophy was awarded to the other major university teacher of\nPlatonism in Italy at the time, Patrizi's contemporary and\ncorrespondent, Jacopo Mazzoni (Kristeller 1964, 113-116; Muccillo\n1992). Based on the published and unpublished works he wrote during his\ncareer, it is clear that Patrizi's range of interests was quite\nbroad, reflecting both the artistic, historical and literary influence\nRenaissance humanism continued to enjoy in scholarly circles during\nthe sixteenth century as well as the emergence of a devotion to\npractical scientific and engineering issues on the part of many\nphilosophers. A brief survey of his works amply reveals the scope of\nhis concerns [see Bibliography]. Among his earliest publications was a\ncollection of works which appeared at Venice in 1553, including his\nutopian “The Happy City” (La città\nfelice), a dialogue on honor (Il Barignano) and a\ndiscourse on the diversity of poetic inspirations (Discorso della\ndiversità de' furori poetici). He composed poetic works of\nhis own. In 1560 he published his ten dialogues on history and, two\nyears later, ten dialogues on rhetoric. He also engaged in exchanges\non literary subjects with some of the leading authors of his day. It was not until 1571 that Patrizi put forward his first major\nphilosophical work in a more narrowly construed sense, when the first\npart of his “Peripatetic Discussions” (Discussiones\nperipateticae) appeared at Venice; a greatly expanded version\nwould be published at Basel ten years later. The Discussiones\nwould constitute one of Patrizi's most important contributions\nto Renaissance philosophy. It provided a thoroughgoing analysis and\ncritique of Aristotle's thought, which continued to be the most\ninfluential source in theological as well as secular philosophical\nsettings in the sixteenth century. In addition to taking on the\nleading philosophical tradition of his day, Patrizi's work would\nserve as the basis for his own development of an anti-Aristotelian\nphilosophy in the years ahead. [see section 2]. By actively seeking to compare Aristotle's philosophical\nviews with those of other ancient thinkers, the Discussiones\nearns Patrizi a place in the history of a major philosophical genre\nwhich has its roots in classical antiquity and which flourished again\nduring the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in large part due\nto the increased availability of translations and commentaries of the\nworks of Plato and other ancient sources. This\n‘Comparatio’ tradition would not only attain popularity in\nprinted works but would provide an alternative model for teaching\nphilosophy and natural science in university settings, where\nPeripatetic views had long held the field. Unlike the\n‘Conciliatio’ approach adopted by such thinkers as\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola, which sought to reconcile the apparent\ndifferences between the teachings of Plato and Aristotle, authors like\nPatrizi and contemporaries such as Jacopo Mazzoni and Paolo Beni\nattempted to use a direct confrontation of the opposing views as a\nmethod for arriving at a position which was most defensible\nphilosophically. In his own major works Patrizi did not hesitate to\nemphasize his opposition to Aristotelianism and his preference for a\nPlatonic approach. [see section 3.] The publication of the Discussiones did not by any means\nsignal an end to Patrizi's broader literary and historical\ninterests, however. In 1583 he published a major study on the ancient\nRoman army, based on his reading of Polybius, Livy and Dionysius of\nHalicarnassus, following it up a decade later with a two-volume\ncomparison of ancient Roman military tactics and strategies with those\nof his own day, probably in attempt to encourage an improvement in\nItalian military standing. He translated works of Platonic thinkers\nsuch as Proclus, the pseudo-John Philoponus, and various tracts in\nmagical philosophy, now recognized as spurious, which were associated\nwith the ancient Egyptian sage Hermes Trismegistus and his\nfollowers. His attention to the latter sources placed him in the\nmiddle of the growing debate on the authenticity and philosophical\nmerit, if any, of the “ancient theology” and the practice\nof spiritual and demonic magic by such contemporary thinkers as the\nunfortunate Giordano Bruno. [see section 4]. Shortly before being called to Rome by Pope Clement VIII to teach\nPlatonic philosophy at the University of Rome, the Sapienza, Patrizi\npublished the first edition of his philosophical masterpiece, the\nNova de universis philosophia (Ferrara, 1591; an edition with\nsignificant variants was printed at Venice with a spurious retrodating\nof 1593). In sum, it brings together many of the major themes that had\ndominated his philosophical career: the opposition to Aristotle and\nthe Peripatetic philosophical method, the admiration for Platonism as\na philosophical alternative, together with the incorporation of\ninsights derived from other ancient and modern sources to form a novel\nsystem that Patrizi was proud to call his own and seek to have\nestablished as a new basis for philosophical instruction in the\nuniversities of Europe. Not surprisingly, opposition to his goals was\ndetermined, with critics on both the theological and philosophical\nsides voicing their concerns. In spite of his having produced a series\nof emendations in response to criticisms by theological and\nphilosophical critics, his work was condemned by the Congregation of\nthe Index of prohibited Books “until corrected” in\n1592. He was to spend the last years of his life trying to defend his\nviews, which in some cases hindsight shows to have pointed toward some\nof the ways in which science and philosophy would move in the\nSeventeenth Century and beyond. [see section 5.] \n\nGiven that his earliest development of an interest in logic and\nphilosophy occurred at the University of Padua, it is surely no\nsurprise that a close familiarity with the works of Aristotle and his\ninterpreters would form a major part of his training. It is perhaps\nworth stressing that in philosophy as in other areas such as art,\narchitecture, science and literature, the Renaissance was a\n“retrospective” age. From roughly the mid-Fourteenth\nthrough the late Sixteenth centuries, many of the leading scholars of\nEurope were engaged in attempting to recover the high levels of skills\nand learning that characterized late classical antiquity. \nHumanists trained in the ancient languages sought to recover texts\nwhich had been lost or ignored for a millennium or more. We owe the\nvery concept of the “Middle Ages” (not to mention the more\npejorative notion of the “dark ages”) to this\nmovement. Patrizi's early mastery of Greek and his interest in\nassembling a library of classical Greek manuscripts (Muccillo 1993)\nplaces him well within the tradition of seeking to restore the legacy\nof antiquity as a precondition for moving ahead to a “new”\nera. \n\nAristotle's works had, of course, been made available to\nscholars via translation from Greek and Arabic sources during the\nmedieval period (Twelfth through Fourteenth centuries), and a\nfamiliarity with Aristotle's logic and natural philosophy became\na requirement for an Arts degree at medieval universities and thus an\nintegral part of the training of those who wished to pursue advanced\nstudies in medicine, theology or canon or civil law. But the number of\nphilosophers or theologians who could access the Aristotelian\ncorpus in the original Greek was quite small, and there was\nan extensive body of works in Greek devoted to commentaries and\ncriticisms of the Stagirite's positions that would not become\navailable to a majority of readers until the Renaissance provided\naccessible translations. It is not surprising that Patrizi devoted\nmuch of his time and effort to these endeavors, and his doing so would\nhave a profound effect on the way in which he and many of his\ncontemporaries and successors would come to interpret the Peripatetic\nsystem. \n\nIt is perhaps significant that Patrizi's earliest works,\nproduced while he was still in close contact with teachers and\ncolleagues at Padua, reveal a far less critical view of Aristotle and\nhis doctrines than his later writings would, generally attempting to\nutilize Plato and other earlier thinkers to complement rather than\nrefute Peripatetic positions (see the article by F. Bottin in the\nOther Internet Resources).  In this regard, it is quite likely that\nPatrizi may be said to have undergone a philosophical development from\nan earlier, more sympathetic, view of Aristotle's philosophy to\na more critical attitude as his familiarity with Platonic and other\nearlier sources increased and he became aware of the debates among the\ncontemporary Aristotelians themselves, such as Pietro Pomponazzi and\nAgostino Nifo, over such basic doctrines as the immortality of the\nsoul and the nature of the physical cosmos. Add to this the ongoing\nexchanges he had with thinkers committed to developing a philosophical\nand scientific method outside both the Platonic and Aristotelian\n“mainstreams” and it becomes clear why Patrizi came to\nplay the major role he did in the move from an entrenched Peripatetic\napproach to the search for a “new” method which would come\nto characterize the leading philosophers and scientists of the\nSeventeenth Century and beyond. \n\nBeginning with the first edition of his Discussiones\nperipateticae in 1571, Patrizi initiated a more critical\nassessment of the character and philosophical reasoning of Aristotle\nthan had characterized his earlier writings. That work, followed\nby the expanded edition of 1581, provided a close comparison of the\nviews of Aristotle and Plato on a wide range of philosophical issues,\narguing that Plato's views were preferable on all counts\n(Kristeller 1964, 115), although it should be noted that the three\nbooks added to the 1581 edition exhibit a far more aggressive tone than\nthe initial edition. In addition, Patrizi echoes the theme put\nforward earlier by Christian Platonists such as Augustine,\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and his own Renaissance predecessor\nMarsilio Ficino, that Platonism is more in harmony with Church doctrine\nthan the Stagirite's were. Later, by including the spurious\nwork Theology of Aristotle, derived largely from the\nNeoplatonist Plotinus, as an appendix to his Nova de universis\nphilosophia (1591), he implied that Aristotle in fact agreed with\nmany of the Platonic doctrines he openly attacked in his\ncorpus of attributed works, thus suggesting an underlying\nduplicity on Aristotle's part in order to bolster his own\nphilosophic credentials as an independent thinker. And\nPatrizi's own “novel” philosophical system would\nunderscore the anti-Aristotelian attitude he had expressed throughout\nhis career. \n\nWhat were some of the major issues on which Patrizi took Aristotle\nto task?   In his Della poetica (Aguzzi-Barbagli\n1961-1971) he evaluated and rejected the Stagirite's analysis of\npoetry as a form of imitation, seeking to replace it with his own view,\ninfluenced at least in part by Platonic sources (Bolzoni 1980, 1983;\nSpedicati 1986). With regard to Aristotle's views on\nmetaphysics and natural philosophy, he rejected the notion that the\nthree basic “principles” of form, matter and privation\ncould provide an adequate account of the nature of being, especially\ngiven that matter was conceived in terms of pure potentiality and form\nas incapable of existing except as embodied in a material substrate\n(Vasoli 1996). Within the broader range of scientific and\ncosmological issues discussed in his major work on his\n“New” philosophy, Patrizi rejects Aristotle's denial\nof the possibility of a vacuum, arguing instead for a position closer\nto the atomistic view that a material void is possible, although\ncouched in terms of his own conception of space. In that work he\nwould also argue for replacing the four standard Aristotelian material\nelements – earth, air, fire and water – with his own\nalternatives – space (spatium), light (lux),\nheat (calor) and humidity (fluor). He rejected\nthe finitude of the physical universe and the concept that heavenly\nbodies moved in conjunction with fixed celestial spheres. In sum,\nby drawing upon a series of ancient, late medieval and Renaissance\nsources, Patrizi sought to replace the dominant Aristotelianism of his\nera with a new and challenging alternative – one which showed at\nmany levels his preference for a Platonic conception of reality. \n\nIn rejecting the Peripatetic conceptions so dominant in philosophy\nand science, Patrizi was clearly motivated not only by his desire to\nreplace what he took to be incorrect views contained in the\nAristotelian works but by his wide reading and critical study of many\nof the major sources associated with the Platonic tradition. In\naddition to the translations of and commentaries on the Platonic\ndialogues and the works of Plotinus published by Marsilio Ficino,\nPatrizi's knowledge of Greek gave him access to a body of\nwritings from other relevant authors. Besides translating John\nPhiloponus' commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics,\nProclus' Elements of Theology and Physical\nElements, he was well versed in the works of thinkers such as\nAntiochus of Ascalon, Cicero, Ammonius Saccas, Boethius and Augustine,\nwho actively sought to incorporate Platonic teachings as an essential\npart of their own views, as well as Platonically-influenced\ncontemporaries such as Francesco Verino il Secondo and Jacopo\nMazzoni. He argued actively for the replacement of\nAristotle's works as the model for philosophical and scientific\neducation at the University level, and his holding chairs in Platonic\nphilosophy at both Ferrara and Rome indicates his success in bringing\nhis ideal to fruition. \n\nWhat were some of the major advantages Patrizi felt Platonism had\nover Aristotelianism and how does his own scientific-philosophical\nsynthesis reflect this conviction?  This is best illustrated in\nhis major work, the Nova de universis philosophia (Patrizi\n1591, reprint with variants dated 1593). The work consists of\nfour major parts, combining, as he claims in the title, Aristotelian,\nPatrizian and Platonic methods to produce a new philosophy. This\nnew system involves three stages, initially ascending, as\nAristotle's had, to the First Cause, but not by using motion to\nreach the “Unmoved Mover”, but rather by employing light\n(lux) and illumination (lumen) to attain to the\nFather of Lights. Then the Patrizian method will provide an\nanalysis of the Divinity, followed by the employment of a Platonic\nmethod to show how all creation is derived from God. Although on\nthe surface such a program could be seen as falling within the\nboundaries of the conciliatory model which many of his contemporaries\nused to incorporate both Platonic and Aristotelian elements into their\nthought, a closer analysis reveals the underlying Platonic nature of\nhis undertaking. \n\nThe four major sections of the Nova … Philosophia are\nas follows: Panaugia, or “All-Splendor”;\nPanarchia, or “All Principles”;\nPampsychia, or “All-Soul” and Pancosmia,\nor “All-Cosmos”.  It has been emphasized (Kristeller 1964,\n120) that Patrizi's selection of light as the basis of his initial\n“Aristotelian” method of establishing the existence of God\nas “First Light” involves a departure from an Aristotelian\napproach in favor of a more Platonic one, although this has been\ncalled into question (Ryan 2002, 192-195). The key point seems to be\nwhy light rather than motion is elevated by Patrizi to the status of\nthe primary basis for an a posteriori proof of God's\nexistence as First Cause.  From a Platonic perspective, the answer\nseems clear.  Plato's use of the Sun as the physical counterpart of\nthe Good in the Republic and his extensive use of visual\nmetaphors for intellective processes (rather than, for example, the\ntactile images that later Stoic thinkers would employ in arguing that\nthe mind can “grasp” certain appearances) strongly suggest\nthat Patrizi was seeking to replace the Aristotelian model with a\nPlatonic one. The fact that the notion of “seeing” the\ntruth would become standard in later Platonic sources such as Plotinus\nand lead to the development of what has been termed Neoplatonic Light\nMetaphysics only strengthens the case. In the Panaugia\nPatrizi construes light as an intermediary between the corporeal and\nincorporeal realms. The existence of light in the corporeal realm\nargues for the existence of a purely incorporeal light, and indeed\nPatrizi construes God as the Lux Prima from which by\nillumination proceeds the entire realm of incorporeal entities.  God\nis also the ultimate source of corporeal light as well (Vasoli\n1991). \n\n In contrast to the Panaugia's emphasis on the\ncentrality of light, the Panarchia, constituting as it does\nthe initial application of the overtly “Patrizian” method\nmentioned in the title of the work, builds upon a pattern more familiar\nto students of the Platonic tradition. Dedicated to showing how\nthe levels of reality flow from the ultimate cause, Patrizi's\nontology draws upon such Platonic predecessors as Plotinus, Proclus and\nMarsilio Ficino to present a ten-level system. Beginning with\nGod, whom he terms the “One-All” (Un'omnia),\nhe establishes Unity, Essence, Life, Intelligence, Soul, Nature,\nQuality, Form and Body as the succeeding categories which constitute\nthe incorporeal and corporeal universe. Such a pastiche would\ndoubtless resonate with students of the history of Platonism. God\nthus is viewed as having both internal and external products in\nPatrizi's version of what might be termed the “chain of\nbeing”. \n\nThe third section of the Nova … Philosophia, the\nPampsychia, focuses on Soul as an intermediary between the\nspiritual and corporeal realms. As has been pointed out\n(Kristeller 1964, 122), Soul thus plays a role similar to that assigned\nto Light in the Panaugia, but the precise relationship between\nthe two is not dealt with. The soul of an individual living being\nhas the same connection to its body as the World Soul has to the\nuniverse as a whole; thus the Anima mundi is not simply a\ncollection of individual souls but a separate entity which vivifies the\nuniverse as a distinct reality. \n\nThe fourth and final part of Patrizi's work, the\nPancosmia, shows how the physical world derives its existence\nfrom the supramundane realities discussed previously and how a\n“Platonic” method may be used to arrive at an understanding\nof the connections between the two realms. Thus Patrizi puts\nforward a model for the understanding of the universe which bridges the\ngap between philosophy and science and incorporates methodologies for\nexplaining physical and astronomical phenomena which would resonate\nwith thinkers seeking to establish an alternative approach to the study\nof nature from the largely qualitative analysis embodied in\nAristotle's natural philosophy. [see Section 5]. \n\nSurely one of the most interesting aspects of Patrizi's\nphilosophical works is his ongoing dedication to the study of sources\nin the history of philosophy as an essential part of his developing his\nown philosophical views. Not content merely to interpret the\nmajor sources such as Aristotle and Plato, nor even to limit himself to\nthe “comparatio” tradition which sought to delineate the\nmajor differences between those two schools of thought, Patrizi used\nhis linguistic, historical and humanistic skills to recover, study and\nmake available a great many sources which he believed (rightly or\nwrongly) to have dated from the pre-Platonic and pre-Socratic\nperiod. He may thus be said to have exemplified an interest in\ntwo themes prevalent in other Renaissance authors – the notion of\na “perennial philosophy” which reappears in different\nguises at different periods in the history of thought, and that of an\n“ancient theology” traceable back to pre-Hellenic\ncivilizations (Schmitt 1966; Vasoli, 1981; Muccillo, 1996). His\nsystematic collection of pre-Aristotelian sources as part of his\nattempt to determine the Stagirite's true place in the history of\nphilosophy put valuable textual materials in the hands of future\ngenerations of scholars in a way that anticipated the modern\ncollections of resources in the last two centuries. \n\nPatrizi's concern with early sources was not strictly\nscholarly or historical, as can readily be seen by examining his works\nand the ways in which those texts were employed. An independent\nthinker, he was willing to consider as wide a range of views as\npossible on subjects of interest to him, whether they were scientific,\nphilosophical, historical, or dealt with concrete problems in\nengineering or hydrology. And he made use of them in his own way,\nunwilling to adhere unquestioningly to the theories and practices of\ncontemporaries who dealt with the same works in different ways. \nTo cite a concrete example, Patrizi accepted the authenticity of the\nbody of works attributed to the pseudo-Egyptian sage Hermes or\nMercurius Trismegistus, as had Marsilio Ficino before him and many of\nhis own contemporaries, such as Giordano Bruno (Yates 1964). He\nprinted some Hermetic works and the Chaldaean Oracles\nattributed to Zoroaster (Patrizi 1593). It was, ironically,\nwithin Patrizi's own lifetime that serious textual and historical\narguments would finally be put forward to undermine the authority of\nmany of these spurious works, and his own commitment to the\nauthenticity of the Hermetica can now be seen to have played a\nmajor role in leading some of his critics and defenders to single out\nand publicize some of the historical and textual grounds for rejecting\nthem as spurious (Purnell 2002; Mulsow, ed. 2002).  \n\nBut what is most interesting is that Patrizi did not employ these\ntexts in the way that fanatical Hermeticists like Bruno did, who saw\ntherein a justification for the practice of spiritual and demonic magic\nand a basis for undermining the authority of the Christian church as a\n“triumphant beast”, perverting the “true”\nreligion of the ancient Egyptians. Instead, Patrizi found in\nthose works themes which he felt would be echoed by “later”\nGreek authors such as Plato and his followers, adding additional\nsupport to their appeal. Yet it is clearly no coincidence that\nPatrizi's own difficulties with the Church over the Nova\n… Philosophia would occur while Bruno was languishing in\nprison in Rome prior to his execution in February 1600 and that Galileo\nGalilei and other innovative cosmologists would face similar\nconfrontations with the Congregation of the Index and the\nInquisition. \n\nGiven the “retrospective” character of the Renaissance\nin general, it is not surprising that what were believed to be the\noldest texts to have survived from antiquity would enjoy the audience\nthey did. Such works would have a profound effect on how the more\nfamiliar and “standard” philosophical and scientific\nsources were interpreted. And the coupling of critical\nhistoriographical and etymological skills as developed by Renaissance\nhumanists with the philosophical and scientific interests of thinkers\nlike Patrizi would usher in a new age of systematic analysis of the\nintellectual legacy of the ancient world. \n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Francesco Patrizi's\nheritage as a forebear of early modern science and philosophy is his\nongoing attempt in his major works to incorporate a systematic account\nof the natural world within an overall methodological and metaphysical\ncontext, anticipating by doing so some of the defining characteristics\nof such thinkers as Galileo, Descartes and Leibniz. Perhaps\nnowhere is this more clearly displayed than in his later writings,\nespecially the Pancosmia section of the Nova …\nPhilosophia and in his discussion of mathematical and physical\nspace (Brickman, tr. 1943; Vedrine, ed. 1996). \n\nIn the Pancosmia Patrizi is intent upon replacing the four\nAristotelian elements with his own alternatives – space, light,\nheat and humidity. Space (spatium) is viewed as\npreferable to the Aristotelian conception of “place”,\nconstrued as the inner surface of the body surrounding any\nobject. Patrizi elevates the notion of space to make it the first\nprinciple of the corporeal world. Space is construed as prior to\nall bodies, even light, and constitutes two distinct realms. \nMundane space is finite in extent and contains the physical\ncosmos. It is surrounded in turn by an infinite external space\nempty of all bodies. The universe consists of three separate\nworlds: the “Empyrean”, an infinite space filled with\nlight; the “Aetheric”, which contains all the stars and\nother heavenly bodies down to the Moon; and the\n“Elementary”, which embraces the sublunar realm. \nPatrizi holds that the stars and planets move freely through the\naether, doing away with the fixed celestial spheres which had\ndominated cosmology from antiquity and had even been accepted by\nCopernicus.  \n\nOne can easily see numerous sources in the history of science which\nmay have influenced Patrizi's conception of the universe. \nThe infinity of space and the existence of a vacuum were maintained by\nthe ancient atomists, and, as noted, the centrality of light as an\nintermediary level between the corporeal and incorporeal has solid\nroots in the Platonic tradition. In some ways Patrizi's\ncosmology may well reveal the influence of similar attacks on the\nAristotelian position put forward by his contemporary and\ncorrespondent, Bernardino Telesio of Cosenza. But it is equally\nclear that his system represents his own unique blend of metaphysics\nand physics. He does not embrace a Brunonian schema which couples\nthe notion of an infinite universe with that of an infinite number of\nworld-systems spread throughout it.  Patrizi's universe is\nstill geocentric, though it places the Earth at the center of an\ninfinite expanse of light-filled space beyond the material realm. \nAnd although it rejects the Sun-centered universe, it does accept the\nEarth's diurnal rotation. An innovative production, it\ncould hardly help but influence later theories (Filippona La Bruna\n1965; Grant 1981; Petković 2002). \n\nAnother fundamental distinction Patrizi introduces is that between\nmathematical and physical space, a view which will have profound import\nfor the main figures identified with early modern thought, such as\nGalileo, Kepler, Newton, Descartes and Leibniz. In\nPatrizi's system, mathematical space is a pure reality,\nontologically prior to all bodies; its primary unit is the geometrical\npoint. Physical space, on the other hand, contains bodies, which\nare not purely three-dimensional geometrical forms, but provide the\nadditional factor of resistance, a view which can be seen as\nanticipating Leibniz's addition of the notion of force to\nDescartes' conception of bodies as geometrically definable\n(Kristeller 1964, 123). Thus Patrizi can be counted among the\nRenaissance thinkers such as Jacopo Mazzoni, Galileo's mentor at\nthe University of Pisa, who posited mathematics as prior to physics and\nquite probably opened the doors to the mathematized physics which would\ncome to dominate early modern science (Purnell 1972; Wallace\n1998). Yet for Patrizi it is geometry which is the most valuable\ntool for the study of the physical world, not arithmetic. Perhaps\noddly for someone with a background so deeply rooted in Platonism,\nPatrizi considered numbers to be merely products of thought, not\nconstitutive or revelatory of the ultimate character of the natural\nworld. Perhaps it would take the development of analytic geometry\nto alter such a view in due course.  \n\nAlthough space was put forward as the main principle of the\nphysical, the three derivative principles also play important roles in\nPatrizi's model. The primary occupant of space is light;\nfrom it in turn heat is produced, which is construed as a formal and\nactive principle. It is probably no coincidence that heat had\nbeen one of the three basic principles underlying his colleague\nTelesio's system of nature, together with cold and matter,\nalthough Telesio's was a qualitative rather than quantifiable\nuniverse, as Patrizi's would be. The final constituent of\nPatrizi's physics is humidity (fluor), which is passive\nand material and somewhat akin to the elements associated with\npre-Socratic thinkers such as Empedocles. \n\nIn sum, then, given the innovative, retrospective, Platonic and\nAristotelian/anti-Aristotelian aspects of Patrizi's thought, what\nis the best way to “categorize” him as a Renaissance\nphilosopher?  Humanist, scientist, mathematician, literary critic\nand poet, historian, engineer and utopian theorist, it is hard to find\none category which fills the bill. Perhaps there is a message\nhere, not just about Francesco Patrizi of Cherso but about many\nRenaissance thinkers of his day. Confronted by so many models\nfrom previous ages and seeking to discover the best means to move into\nthe future, it is hardly surprising that many of the most open-minded\nthinkers of the time can best be viewed more appropriately as\ntransitional figures, rather than Platonists, Aristotelians or\n“philosophers of nature” as many have been claimed to have\nbeen. For example, to characterize Patrizi as a\n“Renaissance Platonist” with such thinkers as Marsilio\nFicino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola is to ignore or understate the\nsignificant differences among them. And to see him as a\n“philosopher of nature” with such contemporaries as\nBernardino Telesio and Giordano Bruno hardly fits as well. That\nhe should be so hard to define – both looking back and looking\nforward – should not disturb us. He was, after all, a\n“Renaissance” thinker, helping to usher in a new age."}]
