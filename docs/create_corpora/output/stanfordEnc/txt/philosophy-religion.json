Philosophy of religion also includes the\ninvestigation and assessment of worldviews (such as secular\nnaturalism) that are alternatives to religious worldviews. Philosophy\nof religion involves all the main areas of philosophy: metaphysics,\nepistemology, value theory (including moral theory and applied\nethics), philosophy of language, science, history, politics, art, and\nso on. Section 1 offers an overview of the field and its significance,\nwith subsequent sections covering developments in the field since the\nmid-twentieth century. These sections address philosophy of religion\nas practiced primarily (but not exclusively) in departments of\nphilosophy and religious studies that are in the broadly analytic\ntradition. The entry concludes with highlighting the increasing\nbreadth of the field, as more traditions outside the Abrahamic faiths\n(Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) have become the focus of important\nphilosophical work.\n\n\nIdeally, a guide to the nature and history of philosophy of religion\nwould begin with an analysis or definition of religion. Unfortunately,\nthere is no current consensus on a precise identification of the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions of what counts as a religion. We\ntherefore currently lack a decisive criterion that would enable clear\nrulings whether some movements should count as religions (e.g.,\nScientology or Cargo cults of the Pacific islands). But while\nconsensus in precise details is elusive, the following general\ndepiction of what counts as a religion may be helpful: \nA religion involves a communal, transmittable body of teachings and\nprescribed practices about an ultimate, sacred reality or state of\nbeing that calls for reverence or awe, a body which guides its\npractitioners into what it describes as a saving, illuminating or\nemancipatory relationship to this reality through a personally\ntransformative life of prayer, ritualized meditation, and/or moral\npractices like repentance and personal regeneration. [This is a\nslightly modified definition of the one for “Religion” in\nthe Dictionary of Philosophy of Religion, Taliaferro &\nMarty 2010: 196–197; 2018, 240.] \nThis definition does not involve some obvious shortcomings such as\nonly counting a tradition as religious if it involves belief in God or\ngods, as some recognized religions such as Buddhism (in its main\nforms) does not involve a belief in God or gods. Although\ncontroversial, the definition provides some reason for thinking\nScientology and the Cargo cults are proto-religious insofar as these\nmovements do not have a robust communal, transmittable body of\nteachings and meet the other conditions for being a religion. (So,\nwhile both examples are not decisively ruled out as religions, it is\nperhaps understandable that in Germany, Scientology is labeled a\n“sect”, whereas in France it is classified as “a\ncult”.) For a discussion of other definitions of religion, see\nTaliaferro 2009, chapter one, and for a recent, different analysis,\nsee Graham Oppy 2018, chapter three. The topic of defining religion is\nre-engaged below in the\n section 4, “Religion and Science”.\n But rather than devoting more space to definitions at the outset, a\npragmatic policy will be adopted: for the purpose of this entry, it\nwill be assumed that those traditions that are widely recognized today\nas religions are, indeed, religions. It will be assumed, then, that\nreligions include (at least) Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism,\nJudaism, Christianity, Islam, and those traditions that are like them.\nThis way of delimiting a domain is sometimes described as employing a\ndefinition by examples (an ostensive definition) or making an appeal\nto a family resemblance between things. It will also be assumed that\nGreco-Roman views of gods, rituals, the afterlife, the soul, are\nbroadly “religious” or “religiously\nsignificant”. Given the pragmatic, open-ended use of the term\n“religion” the hope is to avoid beginning our inquiry with\na procrustean bed. \nGiven the above, broad perspective of what counts as religion, the\nroots of what we call philosophy of religion stretch back to\nthe earliest forms of philosophy. From the outset, philosophers in\nAsia, the Near and Middle East, North Africa, and Europe reflected on\nthe gods or God, duties to the divine, the origin and nature of the\ncosmos, an afterlife, the nature of happiness and obligations, whether\nthere are sacred duties to family or rulers, and so on. As with each\nof what would come to be considered sub-fields of philosophy today\n(like philosophy of science, philosophy of art), philosophers in the\nAncient world addressed religiously significant themes (just as they\ntook up reflections on what we call science and art) in the course of\ntheir overall practice of philosophy. While from time to time in the\nMedieval era, some Jewish, Christian, and Islamic philosophers sought\nto demarcate philosophy from theology or religion, the evident role of\nphilosophy of religion as a distinct field of philosophy does not seem\napparent until the mid-twentieth century. A case can be made, however,\nthat there is some hint of the emergence of philosophy of religion in\nthe seventeenth century philosophical movement Cambridge Platonism.\nRalph Cudworth (1617–1688), Henry More (1614–1687), and\nother members of this movement were the first philosophers to practice\nphilosophy in English; they introduced in English many of the terms\nthat are frequently employed in philosophy of religion today,\nincluding the term “philosophy of religion”, as well as\n“theism”, “consciousness”,and\n“materialism”. The Cambridge Platonists provided the first\nEnglish versions of the cosmological, ontological, and teleological\narguments, reflections on the relationship of faith and reason, and\nthe case for tolerating different religions. While the Cambridge\nPlatonists might have been the first explicit philosophers of\nreligion, for the most part, their contemporaries and successors\naddressed religion as part of their overall work. There is reason,\ntherefore, to believe that philosophy of religion only gradually\nemerged as a distinct sub-field of philosophy in the mid-twentieth\ncentury. (For an earlier date, see James Collins’ stress on\nHume, Kant and Hegel in The Emergence of Philosophy of\nReligion, 1967.) \nToday, philosophy of religion is one of the most vibrant areas of\nphilosophy. Articles in philosophy of religion appear in virtually all\nthe main philosophical journals, while some journals (such as the\nInternational Journal for Philosophy of Religion,\nReligious Studies, Sophia, Faith and\nPhilosophy, and others) are dedicated especially to philosophy of\nreligion. Philosophy of religion is in evidence at institutional\nmeetings of philosophers (such as the meetings of the American\nPhilosophical Association and of the Royal Society of Philosophy).\nThere are societies dedicated to the field such as the Society for\nPhilosophy of Religion (USA) and the British Society for Philosophy of\nReligion and the field is supported by multiple centers such as the\nCenter for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame, the\nRutgers Center for Philosophy of Religion, the Centre for the\nPhilosophy of Religion at Glasgow University, The John Hick Centre for\nPhilosophy of Religion at the University of Birmingham, and other\nsites (such as the University of Roehampton and Nottingham\nUniversity). Oxford University Press published in 2009 The History\nof Western Philosophy of Religion in five volumes involving over\n100 contributors (Oppy & Trakakis 2009), and the Wiley\nBlackwell Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Religion in five volumes,\nwith over 350 contributors from around the world, is scheduled for\npublication by 2021. What accounts for this vibrancy? Consider four\npossible reasons. \nFirst: The religious nature of the world population. Most social\nresearch on religion supports the view that the majority of the\nworld’s population is either part of a religion or influenced by\nreligion (see the Pew Research Center online). To engage in philosophy\nof religion is therefore to engage in a subject that affects actual\npeople, rather than only tangentially touching on matters of present\nsocial concern. Perhaps one of the reasons why philosophy of religion\nis often the first topic in textbook introductions to philosophy is\nthat this is one way to propose to readers that philosophical study\ncan impact what large numbers of people actually think about life and\nvalue. The role of philosophy of religion in engaging real life\nbeliefs (and doubts) about religion is perhaps also evidenced by the\ncurrent popularity of books for and against theism in the UK and\nUSA. \nOne other aspect of religious populations that may motivate philosophy\nof religion is that philosophy is a tool that may be used when persons\ncompare different religious traditions. Philosophy of religion can\nplay an important role in helping persons understand and evaluate\ndifferent religious traditions and their alternatives. \nSecond: Philosophy of religion as a field may be popular because of\nthe overlapping interests found in both religious and philosophical\ntraditions. Both religious and philosophical thinking raise many of\nthe same, fascinating questions and possibilities about the nature of\nreality, the limits of reason, the meaning of life, and so on. Are\nthere good reasons for believing in God? What is good and evil? What\nis the nature and scope of human knowledge? In Hinduism; A\nContemporary Philosophical Investigation (2018), Shyam\nRanganathan argues that in Asian thought philosophy and religion are\nalmost inseparable such that interest in the one supports an interest\nin the other. \nThird, studying the history of philosophy provides ample reasons to\nhave some expertise in philosophy of religion. In the West, the\nmajority of ancient, medieval, and modern philosophers philosophically\nreflected on matters of religious significance. Among these modern\nphilosophers, it would be impossible to comprehensively engage their\nwork without looking at their philosophical work on religious beliefs:\nRené Descartes (1596–1650), Thomas Hobbes\n(1588–1679), Anne Conway (1631–1679), Baruch Spinoza\n(1632–1677), Margaret Cavendish (1623–1673), Gottfried\nLeibniz (1646–1716), John Locke (1632–1704), George\nBerkeley (1685–1753), David Hume (1711–1776), Immanuel\nKant (1724–1804), and G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831) (the list\nis partial). And in the twentieth century, one should make note of the\nimportant philosophical work by Continental philosophers on matters of\nreligious significance: Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), Jean-Paul\nSartre (1905–1980), Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986), Albert\nCamus (1913–1960), Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973), Franz\nRosenzweig (1886–1929), Martin Buber (1878–1956), Emmanuel\nLevinas (1906–1995), Simone Weil (1909–1943) and, more\nrecently Jacques Derrida (1930–2004), Michel Foucault\n(1926–1984), and Luce Irigary (1930–). Evidence of\nphilosophers taking religious matters seriously can also be found in\ncases of when thinkers who would not (normally) be classified as\nphilosophers of religion have addressed religion, including A.N.\nWhitehead (1861–1947), Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), G.E.\nMoore (1873–1958), John Rawls (1921–2002), Bernard\nWilliams (1929–2003), Hilary Putnam (1926–2016), Derek\nParfit (1942–2017), Thomas Nagel (1937–), Jürgen\nHabermas (1929–), and others. \nIn Chinese and Indian philosophy there is an even greater challenge\nthan in the West to distinguish important philosophical and religious\nsources of philosophy of religion. It would be difficult to classify\nNagarjuna (150–250 CE) or Adi Shankara (788–820 CE) as\nexclusively philosophical or religious thinkers. Their work seems as\nequally important philosophically as it is religiously (see\nRanganathan 2018). \nFourth, a comprehensive study of theology or religious studies also\nprovides good reasons to have expertise in philosophy of religion. As\njust observed, Asian philosophy and religious thought are intertwined\nand so the questions engaged in philosophy of religion seem relevant:\nwhat is space and time? Are there many things or one reality? Might\nour empirically observable world be an illusion? Could the world be\ngoverned by Karma? Is reincarnation possible? In terms of the West,\nthere is reason to think that even the sacred texts of the Abrahamic\nfaith involve strong philosophical elements: In Judaism, Job is\nperhaps the most explicitly philosophical text in the Hebrew Bible.\nThe wisdom tradition of each Abrahamic faith may reflect broader\nphilosophical ways of thinking; the Christian New Testament seems to\ninclude or address Platonic themes (the Logos, the soul and body\nrelationship). Much of Islamic thought includes critical reflection on\nPlato, Aristotle, Plotinus, as well as independent philosophical\nwork. \nLet us now turn to the way philosophers have approached the meaning of\nreligious beliefs. \nPrior to the twentieth century, a substantial amount of philosophical\nreflection on matters of religious significance (but not all) has been\nrealist. That is, it has often been held that religious beliefs are\ntrue or false. Xenophanes and other pre-Socratic thinkers, Socrates,\nPlato, Aristotle, the Epicureans, the Stoics, Philo, Plotinus differed\non their beliefs (or speculation) about the divine, and they and their\ncontemporaries differed about skepticism, but they held (for example)\nthat there either was a divine reality or not. Medieval and modern\nJewish, Christian, and Islamic philosophers differed in terms of their\nassessment of faith and reason. They also faced important\nphilosophical questions about the authority of revelation claims in\nthe Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Qur’an. In Asian\nphilosophy of religion, some religions do not include revelation\nclaims, as in Buddhism and Confucianism, but Hindu tradition\nconfronted philosophers with assessing the Vedas and Upanishads. But\nfor the most part, philosophers in the West and East thought there\nwere truths about whether there is a God, the soul, an afterlife, that\nwhich is sacred (whether these are known or understood by any human\nbeing or not). Realism of some kind is so pervasive that the great\nhistorian of philosophy Richard Popkin (1923–2005) once defined\nphilosophy as “the attempt the give an account of what is true\nand what is important” (Popkin 1999: 1). Important philosophers\nin the West such as Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) and Friedrich\nNietzsche (1844–1900), among others, challenged classical\nrealist views of truth and metaphysics (ontology or the theory of what\nis), but the twentieth century saw two, especially powerful movements\nthat challenged realism: logical positivism and philosophy of religion\ninspired by Wittgenstein. \nPrior to addressing these two movements, let us take note of some of\nthe nuances in philosophical reflection on the realist treatment of\nreligious language. Many theistic philosophers (and their critics)\ncontend that language about God may be used univocally, analogically\nor equivocally. A term is used univocally about God and humans when it\nhas the same sense. Arguably, the term “to know” is used\nunivocally of God in the claims “God knows you” and\n“You know London”, even though how God knows you and how\nyou know London differ radically. In terms of the later difference,\nphilosophers sometimes distinguish between what is attributed\nto some thing and the mode in which some state (such as\nknowledge) is realized. Terms are used analogously when there is some\nsimilarity between what is being attributed, e.g., when it is said\nthat “two human persons love each other” and “God\nloves the world”, the term “love” may be used\nanalogically when there is some similarity between these loves). Terms\nare used equivocally when the meaning is different as in the statement\n“Adam knew Eve” (which in the King James’ Bible\nmeant Adam and Eve had intercourse) and “God knows the\nworld” (while some of the Homeric gods did have intercourse with\nhumans, this was not part of theistic worldviews). Theological work\nthat stresses our ability to form a positive concept of the divine has\nbeen called the via positiva or catophatic theology.\nOn the other hand, those who stress the unknowability of God embrace\nwhat is called the via negativa or apophatic\ntheology. Maimonides (1135–1204) was a great proponent of\nthe via negativa, favoring the view that we know God\nprincipally through what God is not (God is not material, not evil,\nnot ignorant, and so on). \nWhile some (but not all) philosophers of religion in the Continental\ntradition have aligned themselves with apophatic theology such as\nLevinas (who was non-theistic) and Jean-Luc Marion (1946–), a\nsubstantial amount (but not all) of analytically oriented philosophy\nof religion have tended to adopt the via positiva One of the\nchallenges of apophatic theology is that it seems to make the\nphilosophy of God remote from religious practices such as prayer,\nworship, trust in God’s power and goodness, pilgrimages, and\nreligious ethics. According to Karen Armstrong, some of the greatest\ntheologians in the Abrahamic faiths held that God \nwas not good, divine, powerful, or intelligent in any way that we\ncould understand. We could not even say that God\n“existed”, because our concept of existence is too\nlimited. Some of the sages preferred to say that God was\n“Nothing” because God was not another being… To\nthese theologians some of our modern ideas about God would have seemed\nidolatrous. (Armstrong 2009: x) \nA prima facie challenge to this position is that it is hard\nto believe that religious practitioners could pray or worship or trust\nin a being which was altogether inscrutable or a being that we cannot\nin any way understand. For a realist, via positiva\nphilosophy of God that seeks to appreciate the force of apophatic\ntheology, see Mikael Stenmark’s “Competing conceptions of\nGod: the personal God versus the God beyond being” (2015). \nLet us now turn to two prominent philosophical movements that\nchallenged a realist philosophy of God. \n“Positivism” is a term introduced by Auguste Comte\n(1798–1857), a French philosopher who championed the natural and\nsocial sciences over against theology and the philosophical practice\nof metaphysics. The term “positivism” was used later\n(sometimes amplified to Logical Positivism by A.J. Ayer) by a\ngroup of philosophers who met in Austria called the Vienna Circle from\n1922 to 1938. This group, which included Moritz Schlick and Max\nPlanck, advanced an empirical account of meaning, according to which\nfor a proposition to be meaningful it needed either to be a conceptual\nor formal statement in mathematics or about analytic definitions\n(“triangles have three angles”) or about matters that can\nbe empirically verified or falsified. Ostensibly factual claims that\ndo not make any difference in terms of our actual (or possible)\nempirical experience are void of meaning. A British philosopher, who\nvisited the Vienna Circle, A.J. Ayer popularized this criterion of\nmeaning in his 1936 book, Language, Truth, and Logic. In it,\nAyer argued that religious claims as well as their denial were without\ncognitive content. By his lights, theism, and also atheism and\nagnosticism, were nonsense, because they were about the reality (or\nunreality or unknowability) of that which made no difference to our\nempirical experience. How might one empirically confirm or disconfirm\nthat there is an incorporeal, invisible God or that Krishna is an\navatar of Vishnu? Famously, Antony Flew employed this strategy in his\nlikening the God of theism to a belief that there is an undetectable,\ninvisible gardener who could not be heard or smelled or otherwise\nempirically discovered (Flew 1955). In addition to rejecting\ntraditional religious beliefs as meaningless, Ayer and other logical\npositivists rejected the meaningfulness of moral statements. By their\nlights, moral or ethical statements were expressions of persons’\nfeelings, not about values that have a reality independent of\npersons’ feelings. \nThe logical positivist critique of religion is not dead. It can be\nseen at work in Herman Philipse’s God in the Age of Science;\nA Critique of Religious Reasons (2012). Still, the criterion of\nmeaning advanced by logical positivism faced a series of objections\n(for details see Copleston 1960 and Taliaferro 2005b). \nConsider five objections that were instrumental in the retreat of\nlogical positivism from its position of dominance. \nFirst, it was charged that logical positivism itself is self-refuting.\nIs the statement of its standard of meaning (propositions are\nmeaningful if and only if they are about the relations of ideas or\nabout matters that are subject to empirical verification or\nfalsification) itself about the relations of ideas or about matters\nthat are subject to empirical verification or falsification? Arguably\nnot. At best, the positivist criterion of meaning is a recommendation\nabout what to count as meaningful. \nSecond, it was argued that there are meaningful statements about the\nworld that are not subject to direct or indirect empirical\nconfirmation or disconfirmation. Plausible candidates include\nstatements about the origin of the cosmos or, closer to home, the\nmental states of other persons or of nonhuman animals (for discussion,\nsee Van Cleve 1999 and Taliaferro 1994). \nThird, limiting human experience to what is narrowly understood to be\nempirical seemed to many philosophers to be arbitrary or capricious.\nC. D. Broad and others defended a wider understanding of experience to\nallow for the meaningfulness of moral experience: arguably, one can\nexperience the wrongness of an act as when an innocent person feels\nherself to be violated. \nFourth, Ayer’s rejection of the meaningfulness of ethics seemed\nto cut against his epistemology or normative account of beliefs, for\nhe construed empirical knowledge in terms of having the right to\ncertain beliefs. If it is meaningful to refer to the right to beliefs,\nwhy is it not meaningful to refer to moral rights such as the right\nnot to be tortured? And if we are countenancing a broader concept of\nwhat may be experienced, in the tradition of phenomenology (which\ninvolves the analysis of appearances) why rule out, as a matter of\nprinciple, the experience of the divine or the sacred? \nFifth, and probably most importantly in terms of the history of ideas,\nthe seminal philosopher of science Carl Hempel (1905–1997)\ncontended that the project of logical positivism was too limited\n(Hempel 1950). It was insensitive to the broader task of scientific\ninquiry which is properly conducted not on the tactical scale of\nscrutinizing particular claims about empirical experience but in terms\nof a coherent, overall theory or view of the world. According to\nHempel, we should be concerned with empirical inquiry but see this as\ndefined by an overall theoretical understanding of reality and the\nlaws of nature. This was not ipso facto a position that\nfavored the meaningfulness of religious belief, but Hempel’s\ncriticism of positivism removed their barrier for overall metaphysical\naccounts of reality, be these accounts theistic, pantheistic (roughly,\nGod is everything), naturalistic, and so on. Moreover, the positivist\ncritique of what they called metaphysics was attacked as confused as\nsome metaphysics was implied in their claims about empirical\nexperience; see the aptly titled classic The Metaphysics of\nLogical Positivism (1954) by Gustav Bergmann\n(1906–1987). \nLet us now turn to Wittgenstein (1889–1951) and the philosophy\nof religion his work inspired. \nWittgenstein’s early work was interpreted by some members of the\nVienna Circle as friendly to their empiricism, but they were surprised\nwhen he visited the Circle and, rather than Wittgenstein discussing\nhis Tractatus, he read them poetry by Rabindranath Tagore\n(1861–1941), a Bengal mystic (see Taliaferro 2005b: chapter\neight). In any case, Wittgenstein’s later work, which was not\nfriendly to their empiricism, was especially influential in post-World\nWar II philosophy and theology and will be the focus here. \nIn the Philosophical Investigations (published posthumously\nin 1953) and in many other works (including the publication of notes\ntaken by his students on his lectures), Wittgenstein opposed what he\ncalled the picture theory of meaning. On this view, statements are\ntrue or false depending upon whether reality matches the picture\nexpressed by the statements. Wittgenstein came to see this view of\nmeaning as deeply problematic. The meaning of language is, rather, to\nbe found not in referential fidelity but in its use in what\nWittgenstein referred to as forms of life. As this position\nwas applied to religious matters, D.Z. Phillips (1966, 1976),\nB.R. Tilghman (1994), and, more recently, Howard Wettstein (2012),\nsought to displace traditional metaphysical debate and arguments over\ntheism and its alternatives and to focus instead on the way language\nabout God, the soul, prayer, resurrection, the afterlife, and so on,\nfunctions in the life of religious practitioners. For example,\nPhillips contended that the practice of prayer is best not viewed as\nhumans seeking to influence an all powerful, invisible person, but to\nachieve solidarity with other persons in light of the fragility of\nlife. Phillips thereby sees himself as following Wittgenstein’s\nlead by focusing, not on which picture of reality seems most faithful,\nbut on the non-theoretical ways in which religion is practiced. \nTo ask whether God exists is not to ask a theoretical question. If it\nis to mean anything at all, it is to wonder about praising and\npraying; it is to wonder whether there is anything in all that. This\nis why philosophy cannot answer the question “Does God\nexist?” with either an affirmative or a negative reply …\n“There is a God”, though it appears to be in the\nindicative mood, is an expression of faith. (Phillips 1976: 181) \nAt least two reasons bolstered this philosophy of religion inspired by\nWittgenstein. First, it seemed as though this methodology was more\nfaithful to the practice of philosophy of religion being truly\nabout the actual practice of religious persons themselves.\nSecond, while there has been a revival of philosophical arguments for\nand against theism and alternative concepts of God (as will be noted\nin\n section 5),\n significant numbers of philosophers from the mid-twentieth century\nonward have concluded that all the traditional arguments and\ncounter-arguments about the metaphysical claims of religion are\nindecisive. If that is the case, the Wittgenstein-inspired new\nphilosophy of religion had the advantage of shifting ground to what\nmight be a more promising area of agreement. \nWhile this non-realist approach to religion has its defenders today,\nespecially in work by Howard Wettstein, many philosophers have\ncontended that traditional and contemporary religious life rests on\nmaking claims about what is truly the case in a realist context. It is\nhard to imagine why persons would pray to God if they, literally,\nthought there is no God (of any kind). \nInterestingly, perhaps inheriting the Wittgenstein stress on practice,\nsome philosophers working on religion today place greater stress on\nthe meaning of religion in life, rather than seeing religious belief\nas primarily a matter of assessing an hypothesis (see Cottingham\n2014). \nAccording to the prestigious Cambridge Dictionary of\nPhilosophy, religious epistemology is “a branch of\nphilosophy that investigates the epistemic status of propositional\nattitudes about religious claims” (Audi 2015: 925). Virtually\nall the extant and current methodologies in epistemology have been\nemployed in assessing religious claims. Some of these methods have\nbeen more rationalistic in the sense that they have involved reasoning\nfrom ostensibly self-evident truths (e.g., a principle of sufficient\nreason), while others have been more experiential (e.g., empiricism,\nphenomenology, the stress on passion and subjectivity, the stress on\npractice as found in pragmatism). Also, some have sought to be\nahistorical (not dependent upon historical revelation claims), while\nothers are profoundly historical (e.g., grounded on revelation either\nknown by faith alone or justified evidentially by an appeal to\nmiracles and/or religious experience. \nOver the past twenty years, there has been a growing literature on the\nnature of religious faith. Among many philosophers in the analytical\ntradition, faith has often been treated as the propositional attitude\nbelief, e.g., believing that there is or is not a God, and much work\ndevoted to examining when such belief is backed up by evidence and, if\nso, how much and what kinds of evidence. There has been a famous\ndebate over “the ethics of belief”, determining what kinds\nof belief should not be entertained or countenanced when the evidence\nis deemed insufficient, and when matters of religious faith may be\njustified on pragmatic grounds (e.g., as a wager or venture). Faith\nhas also been philosophically treated as trust, a form of hope, an\nallegiance to an ideal, commitment, and faithful action with or\nwithout belief (for a survey see Abraham & Aquino 2017; for a\nrecent defense of religious faith without belief, see Schellenberg\n2017). \nThe following examines first what is known as evidentialism and\nreformed epistemology and then a form of what is called volitional\nepistemology of religion. \nEvidentialism is the view that for a person to be justified in some\nbelief, that person must have some awareness of the evidence for the\nbelief. This is usually articulated as a person’s belief being\njustified given the total evidence available to the person. On this\nview, the belief in question must not be undermined (or defeated) by\nother, evident beliefs held by the person. Moreover, evidentialists\noften contend that the degree of confidence in a belief should be\nproportional to the evidence. Evidentialism has been defended by\nrepresentatives of all the different viewpoints in philosophy of\nreligion: theism, atheism, advocates of non-theistic models of God,\nagnostics. Evidentialists have differed in terms of their accounts of\nevidence (what weight might be given to phenomenology?) and the\nrelationship between evident beliefs (must beliefs either be\nfoundational or basic or entailed by such foundational beliefs?)\nProbably the most well known evidentialist in the field of philosophy\nof religion who advocates for theism is Richard Swinburne\n(1934–). \nSwinburne was (and is) the leading advocate of theistic natural\ntheology since the early 1970s. Swinburne has applied his considerable\nanalytical skills in arguing for the coherence and cogency of theism,\nand the analysis and defense of specific Christian teachings about the\ntrinity, incarnation, the resurrection of Christ, revelation, and\nmore. Swinburne’s projects in the evidentialist tradition in\nphilosophy of religion are in the great tradition of British\nphilosophy of religion from the Cambridge Platonists in the\nseventeenth century through Joseph Butler (1692–1752) and\nWilliam Paley (1743–1805) to twentieth century British\nphilosophers such as A.E. Taylor (1869–1945), F. R. Tennant\n(1866–1957), William Temple (1881–1944), H.D. Lewis\n(1910–1992), and A.C. Ewing (1899–1973). The positive\nphilosophical case for theism has been met by work by many powerful\nphilosophers, most recently Ronald Hepburn (1927–2008), J.L.\nMackie (1917–1981), Antony Flew (1923–2010), Richard Gale\n(1932–2015), William Rowe (1931–2015), Michael Martin\n(1932–2015), Graham Oppy (1960–), J.L. Schellenberg\n(1959–), and Paul Draper (1957–). (See The Routledge\nCompanion to Theism [Taliaferro, Harrison, & Goetz 2012] for\nan overview of such work.) \nThere have been at least two interesting, recent developments in the\nphilosophy of religion in the framework of evidentialism. One has been\nadvanced by John Schellenberg who argues that if the God of\nChristianity exists, God’s reality would be far more evident\nthan it is. Arguably, in the Christian understanding of values, an\nevident relationship with God is part of the highest human good, and\nif God were loving, God would bring about such a good. Because there\nis evidence that God does not make Godself available to earnest\nseekers of such a relationship, this is evidence that such a God does\nnot exist. According to this line of reasoning, the absence of\nevidence of the God of Christianity is evidence of absence (see\nSchellenberg 2007 and Howard-Snyder & Moser 2001). The argument\napplies beyond Christian values and theism, and to any concept of God\nin which God is powerful and good and such that a relationship with\nsuch a good God would be fulfilling and good for creatures. It would\nnot work with a concept of God (as we find, for example, in the work\nof Aristotle) in which God is not lovingly and providentially engaged\nin the world. This line of reasoning is often referred to in terms of\nthe hiddenness of God. \nAnother interesting development has been advanced by Sandra Menssen\nand Thomas Sullivan. In philosophical reflection about God the\ntendency has been to give priority to what may be called bare theism\n(assessing the plausibility of there being the God of theism) rather\nthan a more specific concept of God. This priority makes sense insofar\nas the plausibility of a general thesis (there are mammals on the\nsavanna) will be greater than a more specific thesis (there are 12,796\ngiraffes on the savanna). But Menssen and Sullivan argue that\npracticing philosophy of religion from a more particular, especially\nChristian, context, provides a richer “data base” for\nreflection. \nThe all–too–common insistence among philosophers that\nproper procedure requires establishing the likelihood of God’s\nexistence prior to testing revelatory claims cuts off a huge part of\nthe data base relevant to arguing for theism… For it is\ndifficult to establish God’s existence as likely unless some\naccount can be given of the evils of the world, and the account\nChristianity has to offer is unimaginably richer than any\nnon-religious account. The Christian account, accessed through\nscripture, is a story of love: of God’s love for us and of what\nGod has prepared for those who love him… It is a story of the\nsalvific value of suffering: our sufferings are caught up with\nChrist’s, and are included in the sufferings adequate for the\nworld’s redemption, sufferings Christ has willed to make his\nown. (Menssen & Sullivan 2017: 37–38) \nIn terms of the order of inquiry, it may be helpful at times, to\nconsider more specific philosophical positions—for example, it\nmay seem at first glance that materialism is hopeless until one\nengages the resources of some specific materialist account that\ninvolves functionalism—but, arguably, this does not alone offset\nthe logical primacy of the more general thesis (whether this is bare\ntheism or bare materialism). Perhaps the import of the\nMenssen-Sullivan proposal is that philosophers of religion need to\nenhance their critical assessment of general positions along with\ntaking seriously more specific accounts about the data on hand (e.g.,\nwhen it comes to theism, assessing the problem of evil in terms of\npossible theological positions on redemption as presented in\nostensible revelations). \nEvidentialism has been challenged on many grounds. Some argue that it\nis too stringent; we have many evident beliefs that we would be at a\nloss to successfully justify. Instead of evidentialism, some\nphilosophers adopt a form of reliabilism, according to which a person\nmay be justified in a belief so long as the belief is produced by a\nreliable means, whether or not the person is aware of evidence that\njustifies the belief. Two movements in philosophy of religion develop\npositions that are not in line with the traditional evidential\ntradition: reformed epistemology and volitional epistemology. \nReformed epistemology has been championed by Alvin Plantinga\n(1932–) and Nicholas Wolterstorff (1932–), among others.\nReformed epistemology is “Reformed” insofar as it draws on\nthe Reformer John Calvin (1509–1564) who claimed that persons\nare created with a sense of God (sensus divinitatis). While\nthis sense of God may not be apparent due to sin, it can reliably\nprompt persons to believe in God and support a life of Christian\nfaith. While this prompting may play an evidential role in terms of\nthe experience or ostensible perception of God, it can also warrant\nChristian belief in the absence of evidence or argument (see K. Clark\n& VanArragon 2011; M. Bergmann 2017; and Plantinga & Bergmann\n2016). In the language Plantinga introduced, belief in God may be as\nproperly basic as our ordinary beliefs about other persons and the\nworld. The framework of Reformed epistemology is conditional as it\nadvances the thesis that if there is a God and if God has indeed\ncreated us with a sensus divinitatis that reliably leads us\nto believe (truly) that God exists, then such belief is warranted.\nThere is a sense in which Reformed epistemology is more of a defensive\nstrategy (offering grounds for thinking that religious belief, if\ntrue, is warranted) rather than providing a positive reason why\npersons who do not have (or believe they have) a sensus\ndivinitatis should embrace Christian faith. Plantinga has argued\nthat at least one alternative to Christian faith, secular naturalism,\nis deeply problematic, if not self-refuting, but this position (if\ncogent) has been advanced more as a reason not to be a naturalist than\nas a reason for being a theist. (For a stronger version of the\nargument that theism better accounts for the normativity of reason\nthan alternatives, see Angus Menuge’s Agents Under\nFire, 2004.) \nReformed epistemology is not ipso facto fideism. Fideism\nexplicitly endorses the legitimacy of faith without the support, not\njust of (propositional) evidence, but also of reason (MacSwain 2013).\nBy contrast, Reformed epistemology offers a metaphysical and\nepistemological account of warrant according to which belief in God\ncan be warranted even if it is not supported by evidence and it offers\nan account of properly basic belief according to which basic belief in\nGod is on an epistemic par with our ordinary basic beliefs about the\nworld and other minds which seem to be paradigmatically rational.\nNonetheless, while Reformed epistemology is not necessarily fideistic,\nit shares with fideism the idea that a person may have a justified\nreligious belief in the absence of evidence. \nConsider now what is called volitional epistemology in the philosophy\nof religion. Paul Moser has systematically argued for a profoundly\ndifferent framework in which he contends that if the God of\nChristianity exists, this God would not be evident to inquirers who\n(for example) are curious about whether God exists. By Moser’s\nlights, the God of Christianity would only become evident in a process\nthat would involve the moral and spiritual transformation of persons\n(Moser 2017). This process might involve persons receiving (accepting)\nthe revelation of Jesus Christ as redeemer and sanctifier who calls\npersons to a radical life of loving compassion, even the loving of our\nenemies. By willfully subjecting oneself to the commanding love of\nGod, a person in this filial relationship with God through Christ may\nexperience a change of character (from self-centeredness to serving\nothers) in which the person’s character (or very being) may come\nto serve as evidence of the truths of faith. \nThe terrain covered so far in this entry indicates considerable\ndisagreement over epistemic justification and religious belief. If the\nexperts disagree about such matters, what should non-experts think and\ndo? Or, putting the question to the so-called experts, if you (as a\ntrained inquirer) disagree about the above matters with those whom you\nregard as equally intelligent and sensitive to evidence, should that\nfact alone bring you to modify or even abandon the confidence you hold\nconcerning your own beliefs? \nSome philosophers propose that in the case of disagreements among\nepistemic peers, one should seek some kind of account of the\ndisagreement. For example, is there any reason to think that the\nevidence available to you and your peers differs or is conceived of\ndifferently. Perhaps there are ways of explaining, for example, why\nBuddhists may claim not to observe themselves as substantial selves\nexisting over time whereas a non-Buddhist might claim that\nself-observation provides grounds for believing that persons are\nsubstantial, enduring agents (David Lund 2005). The non-Buddhist might\nneed another reason to prefer her framework over the Buddhist one, but\nshe would at least (perhaps) have found a way of accounting for why\nequally reasonable persons would come to different conclusions in the\nface of ostensibly identical evidence. \nAssessing the significance of disagreement over religious belief is\nvery different from assessing the significance of disagreement in\ndomains where there are clearer, shared understandings of methodology\nand evidence. For example, if two equally proficient detectives\nexamine the same evidence that Smith murdered Jones, their\ndisagreement should (other things being equal) lead us to modify\nconfidence that Smith is guilty, for the detectives may be presumed to\nuse the same evidence and methods of investigation. But in assessing\nthe disagreements among philosophers over (for example) the coherence\nand plausibility of theism, philosophers today often rely on different\nmethodologies (phenomenology, empiricism, conceptual or linguistic\nanalysis, structural theory, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, and\nso on). But what if a person accepts a given religion as reasonable\nand yet acknowledges that equally reasonable, mature, responsible\ninquirers adopt a different religion incompatible with her own and\nthey all share a similar philosophical methodology? This\nsituation is not an abstract thought experiment. In Christian-Muslim\ndialogue, philosophers often share a common philosophical inheritance\nfrom Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, and a broad range of shared views\nabout the perfection of God/Allah. \nOne option would be to adopt an epistemological pluralism, according\nto which persons can be equally well justified in affirming\nincompatible beliefs. This option would seem to provide some grounds\nfor epistemic humility (Audi 2011; Ward 2002, 2014, 2017). In an\nappropriately titled essay, “Why religious pluralism is not evil\nand is in some respects quite good”, (2018) Robert McKim\npresents reasons why, from a philosophical point of view, it may be\ngood to encourage (and not merely acknowledge) ostensibly equally\nreasonable worldviews. For an overview of the current state of play in\nphilosophy of religion on the topic of religious disagreement, see\n“Disagreement and the Epistemology of Theology” (King\n& Kelly 2017).  \nAt the end of this section, two observations are also worth noting\nabout epistemic disagreements. First, our beliefs and our confidence\nin the truth of our beliefs may not be under our voluntary control.\nPerhaps you form a belief of the truth of Buddhism based on what you\ntake to be compelling evidence. Even if you are convinced that equally\nintelligent persons do not reach a similar conclusion, that alone may\nnot empower you to deny what seems to you to be compelling. Second, if\nthe disagreement between experts gives you reason to abandon a\nposition, then the very principle you are relying on (one should\nabandon a belief that X if experts disagree about X)\nwould be undermined, for experts disagree about what one should do\nwhen experts disagree. For overviews and explorations of relevant\nphilosophical work in a pluralistic setting, see New Models of\nReligious Understanding (2018) edited by Fiona Ellis and\nRenewing Philosophy of Religion (2017) edited by Paul Draper\nand J.L. Schellenberg. \nThe relationship between religion and science has been an important\ntopic in twentieth century philosophy of religion and it seems highly\nimportant today.  \nThis section begins by considering the National Academy of Sciences\nand Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)\nstatement on the relationship between science and religion: \nScience and religion are based on different aspects of human\nexperience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn\nfrom examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or\nexperiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to\nmodification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith,\nin contrast, does not depend only on empirical evidence, is not\nnecessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and\ntypically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are\nnot a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by\nscience. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address\naspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to pit\nscience and religion against each other create controversy where none\nneeds to exist. (NASIM 2008: 12) \nThis view of science and religion seems promising on many fronts. If\nthe above statement on science and religion is accepted, then it seems\nto insure there is minimal conflict between two dynamic domains of\nwhat the Academies refer to as “human experience”. The\nNational Academies do seem to be correct in implying that the key\nelements of many religions do not admit of direct scientific\ninvestigations nor rest “only on empirical evidence”.\nNeither God nor Allah nor Brahman (the divine as conceived of in\nJudaism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism) is a physical or material\nobject or process. It seems, then, that the divine or the sacred and\nmany other elements in world religions (meditation, prayer, sin and\nforgiveness, deliverance from craving) can only be indirectly\ninvestigated scientifically. So, a neurologist can produce detailed\nstudies of the brains of monks and nuns when they pray and meditate,\nand there can be comparative studies of the health of those who\npractice a religion and those who do not, but it is very hard to\nconceive of how to scientifically measure God or Allah or Brahman or\nthe Dao, heaven, and so on. Despite the initial plausibility of the\nAcademies stance, however, it may be problematic. \nFirst, a minor (and controversial) critical point in response to the\nAcademies: The statement makes use of the terms “supernatural\nforces or entities” that “are not part of nature”.\nThe term “supernatural” is not the standard term used to\nrefer only to God or the divine, probably (in part) because in English the\nterm “supernatural” refers not just to God or the divine,\nbut also to poltergeists, ghosts, devils, witches, mediums, oracles,\nand so on. The later are a panoply of what is commonly thought of as\npreposterous superstition. (The similarity of the terms\nsupernatural and superstitious may not be an\naccident.) The standard philosophical term to reference God in the\nEnglish language, from the seventeenth century onward, is\ntheism (from the Greek theos for god/God). So,\nrather than the statement refer to “supernatural forces or\nentities”, a more charitable phrase might refer to how many\nworld religions are theistic or involve some sacred reality that is\nnot directly, empirically measurable.  \nMoving beyond this minor point about terminology, religious beliefs\nhave traditionally and today been thought of as subject to\nevidence. Evidence for religious beliefs have included appeal to the\ncontingency of the cosmos and principles of explanation, the\nostensibly purposive nature of the cosmos, the emergence of\nconsciousness, and so on. Evidence against religious belief have\nincluded appeal to the evident, quantity of evil in the cosmos, the\nsuccess of the natural sciences, and so on.  \nOne reason, however, for supporting the Academies notion that religion\nand science do not overlap is the fact that in modern science there\nhas been a bracketing of reference to minds and the mental. That is,\nthe sciences have been concerned with a mind-independent physical\nworld, whereas in religion this is chiefly a domain concerned with\nmind (feelings, emotions, thoughts, ideas, and so on), created minds\nand (in the case of some religions) the mind of God. The science of\nKepler, Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton was carried out with an\nexplicit study of the world without appeal to anything involving what\ntoday would be referred to as the psychological, the mind or the\nmental. So, Newton’s laws of motion about the attraction and\nrepulsion of material objects make no mention of how love or desire or\nemotional need might be required to explain the motion of two material\nbodies to embrace romantically. The bracketing of mind from the\nphysical sciences was not a sign of early scientists having any doubts\nabout the existence, power and importance of minds. That is, from\nKepler through Newton and on to the early twentieth century,\nscientists themselves did not doubt the causal significance of minds;\nthey simply did not include minds (their own or the minds of others)\namong the data of what they were studying. But interestingly, each of\nthe early modern scientists believed that what they were studying was\nin some fashion made possible by the whole of the natural world\n(terrestrial and celestial) being created and sustained in existence\nby a Divine Mind, an all good, necessarily existing Creator. They had\nan overall or comprehensive worldview according to which science\nitself was reasonable and made sense. Scientists have to have a kind\nof faith or trust in their methods and that the cosmos is so ordered\nthat their methods are effective and reliable. The earliest modern\nscientists thought such faith (in what Einstein refers to as\n“the rationality and intelligibility of the world” (Cain\n2015: 42, quoting a 1929 statement in Einstein 1954 [1973: 262]) was\nreasonable because of their belief in the existence of God (Cain\n2015). \nWhether there is sufficient evidence for or against some religious\nconception of the cosmos will be addressed in\n section 4.\n Let us contrast briefly, however, two very different views on whether\ncontemporary science has undermined religious belief. \nAccording to Steven Pinker, science has shown the beliefs of many\nreligions to be false. \nTo begin with, the findings of science entail that the belief systems\nof all the world’s traditional religions and\ncultures—their theories of the origins of life, humans, and\nsocieties—are factually mistaken. We know, but our ancestors did\nnot, that humans belong to a single species of African primate that\ndeveloped agriculture, government, and writing late in its history. We\nknow that our species is a tiny twig of a genealogical tree that\nembraces all living things and that emerged from prebiotic chemicals\nalmost four billion years ago.… We know that the laws governing\nthe physical world (including accidents, disease, and other\nmisfortunes) have no goals that pertain to human well-being. There is\nno such thing as fate, providence, karma, spells, curses, augury,\ndivine retribution, or answered prayer—though the discrepancy\nbetween the laws of probability and the workings of cognition may\nexplain why people think there is. (Pinker 2013) \nFollowing up on Pinker, it should be noted that it would not be\nscientifically acceptable today to appeal to miracles or to direct\nacts of God. Any supposed miracle would (to many, if not all\nscientists) be a kind of defeat and to welcome an unacceptable\nmystery. This is why some philosophers of science propose that the\nsciences are methodologically atheistic. That is, while\nscience itself does not pass judgment on whether God exists (even\nthough some philosophers of science do), appealing to God’s\nexistence forms no part of their scientific theories and\ninvestigations. \nThere is some reason to think that Pinker’s case may be\noverstated, however, and that it would be more fair to characterize\nthe sciences as methodologically agnostic (simply not taking\na view on the matter of whether or not God exists) rather than\natheistic (taking a position on the matter). First, Pinker’s\nexamples of what science has shown to be wrong, seem unsubstantial. As\nMichael Ruse points out: \nThe arguments that are given for suggesting that science necessitates\natheism are not convincing. There is no question that many of the\nclaims of religion are no longer tenable in light of modern science.\nAdam and Eve, Noah’s Flood, the sun stopping for Joshua, Jonah\nand the whale, and much more. But more sophisticated Christians know\nthat already. The thing is that these things are not all there is to\nreligions, and many would say that they are far from the central\nclaims of religion—God existing and being creator and having a\nspecial place for humans and so forth. (Ruse 2014: 74–75) \nRuse goes on to note that religions address important concerns that go\nbeyond what is approachable only from the standpoint of the natural\nsciences. \nWhy is there something rather than nothing? What is the purpose of it\nall? And (somewhat more controversially) what are the basic\nfoundations of morality and what is sentience? Science takes the world\nas given Science sees no ultimate purpose to reality… I would\nsay that as science does not speak to these issues, I see no reason\nwhy the religious person should not offer answers. They cannot be\nscientific answers. They must be religious answers—answers that\nwill involve a God or gods. There is something rather than nothing\nbecause a good God created them from love out of nothing. The purpose\nof it all is to find eternal bliss with the Creator. Morality is a\nfunction of God’s will; it is doing what He wants us to do.\nSentience is that by which we realize that we are made in God’s\nimage. We humans are not just any old kind of organism. This does not\nmean that the religious answers are beyond criticism, but they must be\nanswered on philosophical or theological grounds and not simply\nbecause they are not scientific. (2014: 76) \nThe debate over religion and science is ongoing (for promising work,\nsee Stenmark 2001, 2004). \nFor much of the history of philosophy of religion, there has been\nstress on the assessment of theism. Non-theistic concepts of the\ndivine have increasingly become part of philosophy of religion (see,\nfor example, Buckareff & Nagasawa 2016; Diller & Kasher 2013;\nand Harrison 2006, 2012, 2015).\n Section 6\n makes special note of this broadening of horizons. Theism still has\nsome claim for special attention given the large world population that\nis aligned with theistic traditions (the Abrahamic faiths and theistic\nHinduism) and the enormity of attention given to the defense and\ncritique of theism in philosophy of religion historically and\ntoday. \nSpeculation about divine attributes in theistic tradition has often\nbeen carried out in accord with what is currently referred to as\nperfect being theology, according to which God is understood\nto be maximally excellent or unsurpassable in greatness. This\ntradition was (famously) developed by Anselm of Canterbury\n(1033/4–1109). For a contemporary work offering an historic\noverview of Anselmian theism, see Yujin Nagasawa’s Maximal\nGod; A New Defense of Perfect Being Theism (2017). Divine\nattributes in this tradition have been identified by philosophers as\nthose attributes that are the greatest compossible set of great-making\nproperties; properties are compossible when they can be instantiated\nby the same being. Traditionally, the divine attributes have been\nidentified as omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness, worthiness\nof worship, necessary of non-contingent existence, and eternality\n(existing outside of time or atemporally). Each of these attributes\nhas been subject to nuanced different analysis, as noted below. God\nhas also been traditionally conceived to be incorporeal or immaterial,\nimmutable, impassable, omnipresent. And unlike Judaism and Islam,\nChristian theists conceive of God as triune (the Godhead is not\nhomogenous but consists of three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit) and incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth (fully God and fully\nhuman). \nOne of the tools philosophers use in their investigation into divine\nattributes involve thought experiments. In thought experiments,\nhypothetical cases are described—cases that may or may not\nrepresent the way things are. In these descriptions, terms normally\nused in one context are employed in expanded settings. Thus, in\nthinking of God as omniscient, one might begin with a\nnon-controversial case of a person knowing that a proposition is true,\ntaking note of what it means for someone to possess that knowledge and\nof the ways in which the knowledge is secured. A theistic thought\nexperiment would seek to extend our understanding of knowledge as we\nthink of it in our own case, working toward the conception of a\nmaximum or supreme intellectual excellence befitting the religious\nbelievers’ understanding of God. Various degrees of refinement\nwould then be in order, as one speculates not only about the extent of\na maximum set of propositions known but also about how these might be\nknown. That is, in attributing omniscience to God, would one thereby\nclaim God knows all truths in a way that is analogous to the way we\ncome to know truths about the world? Too close an analogy would\nproduce a peculiar picture of God relying upon, for example,\ninduction, sensory evidence, or the testimony of others. One move in\nthe philosophy of God has been to assert that the claim “God\nknows something” employs the word “knows” univocally\nwhen read as picking out the thesis that God knows something,\nwhile it uses the term in only a remotely analogical sense if read as\nidentifying how God knows (Swinburne 1977). \nUsing thought experiments often employs an appearance principle. One\nversion of an appearance principle is that a person has a reason for\nbelieving that some state of affairs (SOA) is possible if she can\nconceive, describe or imagine the SOA obtaining and she knows of no\nindependent reasons for believing the SOA is impossible. As stated the\nprinciple is advanced as simply offering a reason for believing the\nSOA to be possible, and it thus may be seen a advancing a prima\nfacie reason. But it might be seen as a secundum facie\nreason insofar as the person carefully scrutinizes the SOA and its\npossible defeaters (see Taliaferro & Knuths 2017). Some\nphilosophers are skeptical of appealing to thought experiments (see\nVan Inwagen 1998; for a defense see Taliaferro 2002, Kwan 2013, and\nSwinburne 1979; for general treatments see Sorensen 1992 and Gendler\n& Hawthorne 2002). \nImagine there is a God who knows the future free action of human\nbeings. If God does know you will freely do some act X, then it\nis true that you will indeed do X. But if you are free, would\nyou not be free to avoid doing X? Given that it is foreknown\nyou will do X, it appears you would not be free to refrain from\nthe act.  \nInitially this paradox seems easy to dispel. If God knows about your\nfree action, then God knows that you will freely do something and that\nyou could have refrained from it. God’s foreknowing the act does\nnot make it necessary. Does not the paradox only arise because the\nproposition, “Necessarily, if God knows X, then\nX” is confused with “If God knows X, then\nnecessarily X?” After all, it is necessarily the case\nthat if someone knows you are reading this entry right now, then it is\ntrue that you are reading this entry, but your reading this entry may\nstill be seen as a contingent, not necessary state of affairs. But the\nproblem is not so easily diffused, however, because God’s\nknowledge, unlike human knowledge, is infallible, and if God\ninfallibly knows that some state of affairs obtains then it cannot be\nthat the state of affairs does not obtain. Think of what is sometimes\ncalled the necessity of the past. Once a state of affairs has\nobtained, it is unalterably or necessarily the case that it did\noccur. If the future is known precisely and comprehensively,\nisn’t the future like the past, necessarily or unalterably the\ncase? If the problem is put in first-person terms and one imagines God\nforeknows you will freely turn to a different entry in this\nEncyclopedia (moreover, God knows with unsurpassable precision when\nyou will do so, which entry you will select and what you will think\nabout it), then an easy resolution of the paradox seems elusive. To\nhighlight the nature of this problem, imagine God tells you what you\nwill freely do in the next hour. Under such conditions, is it still\nintelligible to believe you have the ability to do otherwise if it is\nknown by God as well as yourself what you will indeed elect to do?\nSelf-foreknowledge, then, produces an additional related problem\nbecause the psychology of choice seems to require prior ignorance\nabout what will be choose. \nVarious replies to the freedom-foreknowledge debate have been given.\nSome adopt compatibilism, affirming the compatibility of free will and\ndeterminism, and conclude that foreknowledge is no more threatening to\nfreedom than determinism. While some prominent philosophical theists\nin the past have taken this route (most dramatically Jonathan Edwards\n(1703–1758)), this seems to be the minority position in\nphilosophy of religion today (exceptions include Paul Helm, John\nFischer, and Lynne Baker). A second position adheres to the\nlibertarian outlook, which insists that freedom involves a radical,\nindeterminist exercise of power, and concludes that God cannot know\nfuture free action. What prevents such philosophers from denying that\nGod is omniscient is that they contend there are no truths about\nfuture free actions, or that while there are truths about the future,\nGod either cannot know those truths (Swinburne) or freely decides not\nto know them in order to preserve free choice (John Lucas). On the\nfirst view, prior to someone’s doing a free action, there is no\nfact of the matter that he or she will do a given act. This is in\nkeeping with a traditional, but controversial, interpretation of\nAristotle’s philosophy of time and truth. Aristotle may have\nthought it was neither true nor false prior to a given sea battle\nwhether a given side would win it. Some theists, such as Richard\nSwinburne, adopt this line today, holding that the future cannot be\nknown. If it cannot be known for metaphysical reasons, then\nomniscience can be analyzed as knowing all that it is possible to\nknow. That God cannot know future free action is no more of a\nmark against God’s being omniscient than God’s inability\nto make square circles is a mark against God’s being omnipotent.\nOther philosophers deny the original paradox. They insist that\nGod’s foreknowledge is compatible with libertarian freedom and\nseek to resolve the quandary by claiming that God is not bound in time\n(God does not so much foreknow the future as God knows what for us is\nthe future from an eternal viewpoint) and by arguing that the unique\nvantage point of an omniscient God prevents any impingement on\nfreedom. God can simply know the future without this having to be\ngrounded on an established, determinate future. But this only works if\nthere is no necessity of eternity analogous to the necessity of the\npast. Why think that we have any more control over God’s\ntimeless belief than over God’s past belief? If not, then there\nis an exactly parallel dilemma of timeless knowledge. For outstanding\ncurrent analysis of freedom and foreknowledge, see the work of Linda\nZagzebski. \nCould there be a being that is outside time? In the great monotheistic\ntraditions, God is thought of as without any kind of beginning or end.\nGod will never, indeed, can never, cease to be. Some philosophical\ntheists hold that God’s temporality is very much like ours in\nthe sense that there is a before, during, and an after for God, or a\npast, present, and future for God. This view is sometimes referred to\nas the thesis that God is everlasting. Those adopting a more radical\nstance claim that God is independent of temporality, arguing either\nthat God is not in time at all, or that God is\n“simultaneously” at or in all times. This is sometimes\ncalled the view that God is eternal as opposed to everlasting. \nWhy adopt the more radical stance? One reason, already noted, is that\nif God is not temporally bound, there may be a resolution to the\nearlier problem of reconciling freedom and foreknowledge. As St.\nAugustine of Hippo put it:  \nso that of those things which emerge in time, the future, indeed, are\nnot yet, and the present are now, and the past no longer are; but all\nof these are by Him comprehended in His stable and eternal presence.\n(The City of God, XI.21)  \nIf God is outside time, there may also be a secure foundation\nexplaining God’s immutability (changelessness),\nincorruptibility, and immortality. Furthermore, there may be an\nopportunity to use God’s standing outside of time to launch an\nargument that God is the creator of time. \nThose affirming God to be unbounded by temporal sequences face several\npuzzles which I note without trying to settle. If God is somehow at or\nin all times, is God simultaneously at or in each? If so, there is the\nfollowing problem. If God is simultaneous with the event of Rome\nburning in 410 CE, and also simultaneous with your reading this entry,\nthen it seems that Rome must be burning at the same time you are\nreading this entry. (This problem was advanced by Nelson Pike (1970);\nStump and Kretzmann 1981 have replied that the simultaneity involved\nin God’s eternal knowledge is not transitive). A different\nproblem arises with respect to eternity and omniscience. If God is\noutside of time, can God know what time it is now? Arguably, there is\na fact of the matter that it is now, say, midnight on 1 July 2018. A\nGod outside of time might know that at midnight on 1 July 2018 certain\nthings occur, but could God know when it is now that time?\nThe problem is that the more emphasis one places on the claim that\nGod’s supreme existence is independent of time, the more one\nseems to jeopardize taking seriously time as it is known. Finally,\nwhile the great monotheistic traditions provide a portrait of the\nDivine as supremely different from the creation, there is also an\ninsistence on God’s proximity or immanence. For some theists,\ndescribing God as a person or person-like (God loves, acts, knows) is\nnot to equivocate. But it is not clear that an eternal God could be\npersonal. For recent work on God’s relation to time, see work by\nKatherine Rogers (2007, 2008).  \nAll known world religions address the nature of good and evil and\ncommend ways of achieving human well-being, whether this be thought of\nin terms of salvation, liberation, deliverance, enlightenment,\ntranquility, or an egoless state of Nirvana. Notwithstanding important\ndifferences, there is a substantial overlap between many of these\nconceptions of the good as witnessed by the commending of the Golden\nRule (“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”)\nin many religions. Some religions construe the Divine as in some\nrespect beyond our human notions of good and evil. In some forms of\nHinduism, for example, Brahman has been extolled as possessing a sort\nof moral transcendence, and some Christian theologians and\nphilosophers have likewise insisted that God is only a moral agent in\na highly qualified sense, if at all (Davies 1993). To call God good\nis, for them, very different from calling a human being good. \nHere are only some of the ways in which philosophers have articulated\nwhat it means to call God good. In treating the matter, there has been\na tendency either to explain God’s goodness in terms of\nstandards that are not God’s creation and thus, in some measure,\nindependent of God’s will, or in terms of God’s will and\nthe standards God has created. The latter view has been termed\ntheistic voluntarism. A common version of theistic\nvoluntarism is the claim that for something to be good or right simply\nmeans that God approves of permits it and for something to be bad or\nwrong means that God disapproves or forbids it. \nTheistic voluntarists face several difficulties: moral language seems\nintelligible without having to be explained in terms of the Divine\nwill. Indeed, many people make what they take to be objective moral\njudgments without making any reference to God. If they are using moral\nlanguage intelligibly, how could it be that the very meaning of such\nmoral language should be analyzed in terms of Divine volitions? New\nwork in the philosophy of language may be of use to theistic\nvoluntarists. According to a causal theory of reference,\n“water” necessarily designates H2O. It is not a\ncontingent fact that water is H2O notwithstanding the fact\nthat many people can use the term “water” without knowing\nits composition. Similarly, could it not be the case that\n“good” may refer to that which is willed by God even\nthough many people are not aware of (or even deny) the existence of\nGod? Another difficulty for voluntarism lies in accounting for the\napparent meaningful content of claims like “God is good”.\nIt appears that in calling God or in particular God’s will\n“good” the religious believer is saying more than\n“God wills what God wills”. If so, must not the very\nnotion of goodness have some meaning independent of God’s will?\nAlso at issue is the worry that if voluntarism is accepted, the theist\nhas threatened the normative objectivity of moral judgments. Could God\nmake it the case that moral judgments were turned upside down? For\nexample, could God make cruelty good? Arguably, the moral universe is\nnot so malleable. In reply, some voluntarists have sought to\nunderstand the stability of the moral laws in light of God’s\nimmutably fixed, necessary nature. \nBy understanding God’s goodness in terms of God’s being\n(as opposed to God’s will alone), one comes close to the\nnon-voluntarist stand. Aquinas and others hold that God is essentially\ngood in virtue of God’s very being. All such positions are\nnon-voluntarist in so far as they do not claim that what it means for\nsomething to be good is that God wills it to be so. The goodness of\nGod may be articulated in various ways, either by arguing that\nGod’s perfection requires God being good as an agent or by\narguing that God’s goodness can be articulated in terms of other\nDivine attributes such as those outlined above. For example, because\nknowledge is in itself good, omniscience is a supreme good. God has\nalso been considered good in so far as God has created and conserves\nin existence a good cosmos. Debates over the problem of evil (if God\nis indeed omnipotent and perfectly good, why is there evil?) have\npoignancy precisely because one side challenges this chief judgment\nabout God’s goodness. (The debate over the problem of evil is\ntaken up in\n section 5.2.4.) \nThe choice between voluntarism and seeing God’s very being as\ngood is rarely strict. Some theists who oppose a full-scale\nvoluntarism allow for partial voluntarist elements. According to one\nsuch moderate stance, while God cannot make cruelty good, God can make\nsome actions morally required or morally forbidden which\notherwise would be morally neutral. Arguments for this have been based\non the thesis that the cosmos and all its contents are God’s\ncreation. According to some theories of property, an agent making\nsomething good gains entitlements over the property. The crucial moves\nin arguments that the cosmos and its contents belong to their Creator\nhave been to guard against the idea that human parents would then\n“own” their children (they do not, because parents are not\nradical creators like God), and the idea that Divine ownership would\npermit anything, thus construing human duties owed to God as the\nduties of a slave to a master (a view to which not all theists have\nobjected). Theories spelling out why and how the cosmos belongs to God\nhave been prominent in all three monotheistic traditions. Plato\ndefended the notion, as did Aquinas and Locke (see Brody 1974 for a\ndefense). \nA new development in theorizing about God’s goodness has been\nadvanced in Zagzebski 2004. Zagzebski contends that being an exemplary\nvirtuous person consists in having good motives. Motives have an\ninternal, affective or emotive structure. An emotion is “an\naffective perception of the world” (2004: xvi) that\n“initiates and directs action” (2004: 1). The ultimate\ngrounding of what makes human motives good is that they are in accord\nwith the motives of God. Zagzebski’s theory is perhaps the most\nambitious virtue theory in print, offering an account of human virtues\nin light of theism. Not all theists resonate with her bold claim that\nGod is a person who has emotions, but many allow that (at least in\nsome analogical sense) God may be see as personal and having affective\nstates. \nOne other effort worth noting to link judgments of good and evil with\njudgments about God relies upon the ideal observer theory of ethics.\nAccording to this theory, moral judgments can be analyzed in terms of\nhow an ideal observer would judge matters. To say an act is right\nentails a commitment to holding that if there were an ideal observer,\nit would approve of the act; to claim an act is wrong entails the\nthesis that if there were an ideal observer, it would disapprove of\nit. The theory can be found in works by Hume, Adam Smith, R.M. Hare,\nand R. Firth (see Firth 1952 [1970]). The ideal observer is variously\ndescribed, but typically is thought of as an impartial omniscient\nregarding non-moral facts (facts that can be grasped without already\nknowing the moral status or implications of the fact—for\ninstance, “He did something bad” is a moral fact;\n“He hit Smith” is not), and as omnipercipient\n(Firth’s term for adopting a position of universal affective\nappreciation of the points of view of all involved parties). The\ntheory receives some support from the fact that most moral disputes\ncan be analyzed in terms of different parties challenging each other\nto be impartial, to get their empirical facts straight, and to be more\nsensitive—for example, by realizing what it feels like to be\ndisadvantaged. The theory has formidable critics and defenders. If\ntrue, it does not follow that there is an ideal observer, but if it is\ntrue and moral judgments are coherent, then the idea of an ideal\nobserver is coherent. Given certain conceptions of God in the three\ngreat monotheistic traditions, God fits the ideal observer description\n(and more besides, of course). This need not be unwelcome to atheists.\nShould an ideal observer theory be cogent, a theist would have some\nreason for claiming that atheists committed to normative, ethical\njudgments are also committed to the idea of a God or a God-like being.\n(For a defense of a theistic form of the ideal observer theory, see\nTaliaferro 2005a; for criticism see Anderson 2005. For further work on\nGod, goodness, and morality, see Evans 2013 and Hare 2015. For\ninteresting work on the notion of religious authority, see Zagzebski\n2012.) \nIt should be noted that in addition to attention to the classical\ndivine attributes discussed in this section, there has also been\nphilosophical work on divine simplicity, immutability, impassibility,\nomnipresence, God’s freedom, divine necessity, sovereignty,\nGod’s relationship with abstract objects, Christian teachings\nabout the Trinity, the incarnation, atonement, the sacraments, and\nmore. \nIn some introductory philosophy textbooks and anthologies, the\narguments for God’s existence are presented as ostensible proofs\nwhich are then shown to be fallible. For example, an argument from the\napparent order and purposive nature of the cosmos will be criticized\non the grounds that, at best, the argument would establish there is a\npurposive, designing intelligence at work in the cosmos. This falls\nfar short of establishing that there is a God who is omnipotent,\nomniscient, benevolent, and so on. But two comments need to be made:\nFirst, that “meager” conclusion alone would be enough to\ndisturb a scientific naturalist who wishes to rule out all such\ntranscendent intelligence. Second, few philosophers today advance a\nsingle argument as a proof. Customarily, a design argument might be\nadvanced alongside an argument from religious experience, and the\nother arguments to be considered below. True to Hempel’s advice\n(cited earlier) about comprehensive inquiry, it is increasingly common\nto see philosophies—scientific naturalism or\ntheism—advanced with cumulative arguments, a whole range of\nconsiderations, and not with a supposed knock-down, single proof. \nThis section surveys some of the main theistic arguments. \nThere is a host of arguments under this title; version of the argument\nworks, then it can be deployed using only the concept of God as\nmaximally excellent and some modal principles of inference, that is,\nprinciples concerning possibility and necessity. The argument need not\nresist all empirical support, however, as shall be indicated. The\nfocus of the argument is the thesis that, if there is a God, then\nGod’s existence is necessary. In other words, God’s\nexistence is not contingent—God is not the sort of being that\njust happens to exist or not exist. That necessary existence is built\ninto the concept of God can be supported by appealing to the way God\nis conceived in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions. This would\ninvolve some a posteriori, empirical research into the way\nGod is thought of in these traditions. Alternatively, a defender of\nthe ontological argument might hope to convince others that the\nconcept of God is the concept of a being that exists necessarily by\nbeginning with the idea of a maximally perfect being. If there were a\nmaximally perfect being, what would it be like? It has been argued\nthat among its array of great-making qualities (omniscience and\nomnipotence) would be necessary existence. Once fully articulated, it\ncan be argued that a maximally perfect being which existed necessarily\ncould be called “God”. For an interesting, recent\ntreatment of the relationship between the concept of there being a\nnecessarily existing being and there being a God, see Necessary\nExistence by Alexander Pruss and Joshua Rasmussen (2018: chapters\none to three). \nThe ontological argument goes back to St. Anselm (1033/34–1109),\nbut this section shall explore a current version relying heavily on\nthe principle that if something is possibly necessarily the case, then\nit is necessarily the case (or, to put it redundantly, it is\nnecessarily necessary). The principle can be illustrated in the case\nof propositions. That six is the smallest perfect number (that number\nwhich is equal to the sum of its divisors including one but not\nincluding itself) does not seem to be the sort of thing that might\njust happen to be true. Rather, either it is necessarily true or\nnecessarily false. If the latter, it is not possible, if the former,\nit is possible. If one knows that it is possible that six is the\nsmallest perfect number, then one has good reason to believe that.\nDoes one have reason to think it is possible that God exists\nnecessarily? Defenders of the argument answer in the affirmative and\ninfer that God exists. There have been hundreds of objections and\nreplies to this argument. Perhaps the most ambitious objection is that\nthe same sort of reasoning can be used to argue that God cannot exist;\nfor if it is possible that God not exist and necessary existence is\npart of the meaning of “God”, then it follows that God\ncannot exist. \nClassical, alternative versions of the ontological argument are\npropounded by Anselm, Spinoza, and Descartes, with current versions by\nAlvin Plantinga, Charles Hartshorne, Norman Malcolm, and C. Dore;\nclassical critics include Gaunilo and Kant, and current critics are\nmany, including William Rowe, J. Barnes, G. Oppy, and J. L. Mackie.\nThe latest book-length treatments of the ontological argument are two\ndefenses: Rethinking the Ontological Argument by Daniel\nDombrowski (2006) and Yujin Nagasawa’s Maximal God; A New\nDefence of Perfect Being Theism (2017). Not every advocate of\nperfect being theology embraces the ontological argument. Famously\nThomas Aquinas did not accept the ontological argument. Alvin\nPlantinga, who is one of the philosophers responsible for the revival\nof interest in the ontological argument, contends that while he,\npersonally, takes the argument to be sound (because he believes that\nthe conclusion that God exists necessarily is true, which entails that\nthe premise, that it is possible that God exists necessarily is true)\nhe does not think the argument has sufficient force to convince an\natheist (Plantinga 1974: 216–217). \nArguments in this vein are more firmly planted in empirical, a\nposteriori reflection than the ontological argument, but some\nversions employ a priori reasons as well. There are various\nversions. Some argue that the cosmos had an initial cause outside it,\na First Cause in time. Others argue that the cosmos has a necessary,\nsustaining cause from instant to instant, whether or not the cosmos\nhad a temporal origin. The two versions are not mutually exclusive,\nfor it is possible both that the cosmos had a First Cause and that it\nhas a continuous, sustaining cause. \nThe cosmological argument relies on the intelligibility of the notion\nof there being at least one powerful being which is self-existing or\nwhose origin and continued being does not depend on any other being.\nThis could be either the all-out necessity of supreme pre-eminence\nacross all possible worlds used in versions of the ontological\nargument, or a more local, limited notion of a being that is uncaused\nin the actual world. If successful, the argument would provide reason\nfor thinking there is at least one such being of extraordinary power\nresponsible for the existence of the cosmos. At best, it may not\njustify a full picture of the God of religion (a First Cause would be\npowerful, but not necessarily omnipotent), but it would nonetheless\nchallenge naturalistic alternatives and provide some reason theism.\n(The later point is analogous to the idea that evidence that there was\nsome life on another planet would not establish that such life is\nintelligent, but it increases—perhaps only slightly—the\nhypothesis that there is intelligent life on another planet.) \nBoth versions of the argument ask us to consider the cosmos in its\npresent state. Is the world as we know it something that necessarily\nexists? At least with respect to ourselves, the planet, the solar\nsystem and the galaxy, it appears not. With respect to these items in\nthe cosmos, it makes sense to ask why they exist rather than not. In\nrelation to scientific accounts of the natural world, such enquiries\ninto causes make abundant sense and are perhaps even essential\npresuppositions of the natural sciences. Some proponents of the\nargument contend that we know a priori that if something\nexists there is a reason for its existence. So, why does the cosmos\nexist? Arguably, if explanations of the contingent existence of the\ncosmos (or states of the cosmos) are only in terms of other contingent\nthings (earlier states of the cosmos, say), then a full cosmic\nexplanation will never be attained. However, if there is at least one\nnecessarily (non-contingent) being causally responsible for the\ncosmos, the cosmos does have an explanation. At this point the two\nversions of the argument divide. \nArguments to a First Cause in time contend that a continuous temporal\nregress from one contingent existence to another would never account\nfor the existence of the cosmos, and they conclude that it is more\nreasonable to accept there was a First Cause than to accept either a\nregress or the claim that the cosmos just came into being from\nnothing. Arguments to a sustaining cause of the cosmos claim that\nexplanations of why something exists now cannot be adequate without\nassuming a present, contemporaneous sustaining cause. The arguments\nhave been based on the denial of all actual infinities or on the\nacceptance of some infinities (for instance, the coherence of\nsupposing there to be infinitely many stars) combined with the\nrejection of an infinite regress of explanations solely involving\ncontingent states of affairs. The latter has been described as a\nvicious regress as opposed to one that is benign. There are plausible\nexamples of vicious infinite regresses that do not generate\nexplanations: for instance, imagine that Tom explains his possession\nof a book by reporting that he got it from A who got it from\nB, and so on to infinity. This would not explain how Tom got\nthe book. Alternatively, imagine a mirror with light reflected in it.\nWould the presence of light be successfully explained if one claimed\nthat the light was a reflection of light from another mirror, and the\nlight in that mirror came from yet another mirror, and so on to\ninfinity? Consider a final case. You come across a word you do not\nunderstand; let it be “ongggt”. You ask its meaning and\nare given another word which is unintelligible to you, and so on,\nforming an infinite regress. Would you ever know the meaning of the\nfirst term? The force of these cases is to show how similar they are\nto the regress of contingent explanations. \nVersions of the argument that reject all actual infinities face the\nembarrassment of explaining what is to be made of the First Cause,\nespecially since it might have some features that are actually\ninfinite. In reply, Craig and others have contended that they have no\nobjection to potential infinities (although the First Cause will never\ncease to be, it will never become an actual infinity). They further\naccept that prior to the creation, the First Cause was not in time, a\nposition relying on the theory that time is relational rather than\nabsolute. The current scientific popularity of the relational view may\noffer support to defenders of the argument. \nIt has been objected that both versions of the cosmological argument\nset out an inflated picture of what explanations are reasonable. Why\nshould the cosmos as a whole need an explanation? If everything in the\ncosmos can be explained, albeit through infinite, regressive accounts,\nwhat is left to explain? One may reply either by denying that infinite\nregresses actually do satisfactorily explain, or by charging that the\nfailure to seek an explanation for the whole is arbitrary. The\nquestion, “Why is there a cosmos?” seems a perfectly\nintelligible one. If there are accounts for things in the cosmos, why\nnot for the whole? The argument is not built on the fallacy of\ntreating every whole as having all the properties of its parts. But if\neverything in the cosmos is contingent, it seems just as reasonable to\nbelieve that the whole cosmos is contingent as it is to believe that\nif everything in the cosmos were invisible, the cosmos as a whole\nwould be invisible. \nAnother objection is that rather than explaining the contingent\ncosmos, the cosmological argument introduces a mysterious entity of\nwhich we can make very little philosophical or scientific sense. How\ncan positing at least one First Cause provide a better account of the\ncosmos than simply concluding that the cosmos lacks an ultimate\naccount? In the end, the theist seems bound to admit that why the\nFirst Cause created at all was a contingent matter. If, on the\ncontrary, the theist has to claim that the First Cause had to do what\nit did, would not the cosmos be necessary rather than contingent? \nSome theists come close to concluding that it was indeed essential\nthat God created the cosmos. If God is supremely good, there had to be\nsome overflowing of goodness in the form of a cosmos (see Stump &\nKretzmann 1981, on the ideas of Dionysius the Areopagite; see Rowe\n2004 for arguments that God is not free). But theists typically\nreserve some role for the freedom of God and thus seek to retain the\nidea that the cosmos is contingent. Defenders of the cosmological\nargument still contend that its account of the cosmos has a\ncomprehensive simplicity lacking in alternative views. God’s\nchoices may be contingent, but not God’s existence and the\nDivine choice of creating the cosmos can be understood to be\nprofoundly simple in its supreme, overriding endeavor, namely to\ncreate something good. Swinburne has argued that accounting for\nnatural laws in terms of God’s will provides for a simple,\noverarching framework within which to comprehend the order and\npurposive character of the cosmos (see also Foster 2004). \nDefenders of the cosmological argument include Swinburne, Richard\nTaylor, Hugo Meynell, Timothy O’Connor, Bruce Reichenbach,\nRobert Koons, Alexander Pruss, and William Rowe; prominent opponents\ninclude Antony Flew, Michael Martin, Howard Sobel, Graham Oppy,\nNicholas Everitt, and J. L Mackie. While Rowe had defended the\ncosmological argument, his reservations about the principle of\nsufficient reason prevents his accepting the argument as fully\nsatisfying. \nThese arguments focus on characteristics of the cosmos that seem to\nreflect the design or intentionality of God or, more modestly, of one\nor more powerful, intelligent God-like, purposive forces. Part of the\nargument may be formulated as providing evidence that the cosmos is\nthe sort of reality that would be produced by an intelligent being,\nand then arguing that positing this source is more reasonable than\nagnosticism or denying it. As in the case of the cosmological\nargument, the defender of the teleological argument may want to claim\nit only provides some reason for thinking there is a God. It\nmay be that some kind of cumulative case for theism would require\nconstruing various arguments as mutually reinforcing. If successful in\narguing for an intelligent, trans-cosmos cause, the teleological\nargument may provide some reason for thinking that the First Cause of\nthe cosmological argument (if it is successful) is purposive, while\nthe ontological argument (if it has some probative force) may provides\nsome reason for thinking that it makes sense to posit a being that has\nDivine attributes and necessarily exists. Behind all of them an\nargument from religious experience (to be addressed below) may provide\nsome reasons to seek further support for a religious conception of the\ncosmos and to question the adequacy of naturalism. \nOne version of the teleological argument will depend on the\nintelligibility of purposive explanation. In our own human case it\nappears that intentional, purposive explanations are legitimate and\ncan truly account for the nature and occurrence of events. In thinking\nabout an explanation for the ultimate character of the cosmos, is it\nmore likely for the cosmos to be accounted for in terms of a powerful,\nintelligent agent or in terms of a naturalistic scheme of final laws\nwith no intelligence behind them? Theists employing the teleological\nargument draw attention to the order and stability of the cosmos, the\nemergence of vegetative and animal life, the existence of\nconsciousness, morality, rational agents and the like, in an effort to\nidentify what might plausibly be seen as purposive explicable features\nof the cosmos. Naturalistic explanations, whether in biology or\nphysics, are then cast as being comparatively local in application\nwhen held up against the broader schema of a theistic metaphysics.\nDarwinian accounts of biological evolution will not necessarily assist\nus in thinking through why there are either any such laws or any\norganisms to begin with. Arguments supporting and opposing the\nteleological argument will then resemble arguments about the\ncosmological argument, with the negative side contending that there is\nno need to move beyond a naturalistic account, and the positive side\naiming to establish that failing to go beyond naturalism is\nunreasonable. \nIn assessing the teleological argument, consider the objection from\nuniqueness. The cosmos is utterly unique. There is no access to\nmultiple universes, some of which are known to be designed and some\nare known not to be. Without being able o compare the cosmos to\nalternative sets of cosmic worlds, the argument fails. Replies to this\nobjection have contended that were we to insist that inferences in\nunique cases are out of order, then this would rule out otherwise\nrespectable scientific accounts of the origin of the cosmos. Besides,\nwhile it is not possible to compare the layout of different cosmic\nhistories, it is in principle possible to envisage worlds that seem\nchaotic, random, or based on laws that cripple the emergence of life.\nNow we can envisage an intelligent being creating such worlds, but,\nthrough considering their features, we can articulate some marks of\npurposive design to help judge whether the cosmos is more reasonably\nbelieved to be designed rather than not designed. Some critics appeal\nto the possibility that the cosmos has an infinite history to bolster\nand re-introduce the uniqueness objection. Given infinite time and\nchance, it seems likely that something like our world will come into\nexistence, with all its appearance of design. If so, why should we\ntake it to be so shocking that our world has its apparent design, and\nwhy should explaining the world require positing one or more\nintelligent designers? Replies repeat the earlier move of insisting\nthat if the objection were to be decisive, then many seemingly\nrespectable accounts would also have to fall by the wayside. It is\noften conceded that the teleological argument does not demonstrate\nthat one or more designers are required; it seeks rather to establish\nthat positing such purposive intelligence is reasonable and preferable\nto naturalism. Recent defenders of the argument include George\nSchlesinger, Robin Collins, and Richard Swinburne. It is rejected by\nJ. L. Mackie, Michael Martin, Nicholas Everitt, and many others. \nOne feature of the teleological argument currently receiving increased\nattention focuses on epistemology. It has been argued by Richard\nTaylor (1963), Alvin Plantinga (2011 and in Beilby 2002), and others\nthat if we reasonably rely on our cognitive faculties, it is\nreasonable to believe that these are not brought about by naturalistic\nforces—forces that are entirely driven by chance or are the\noutcome of processes not formed by an overriding intelligence. An\nillustration may help to understand the argument. Imagine Tom coming\nacross what appears to be a sign reporting some information about his\ncurrent altitude (some rocks in a configuration giving him his current\nlocation and precise height above sea-level in meters). If he had\nreason to believe that this “sign” was totally the result\nof chance configurations, would he be reasonable to trust it? Some\ntheists argue that it would not be reasonable, and that trusting our\ncognitive faculties requires us to accept that they were formed by an\noverarching, good, creative agent. This rekindles Descartes’\npoint about relying on the goodness of God to ensure that our\ncognitive faculties are in good working order. Objections to this\nargument center on naturalistic explanations, especially those\nfriendly to evolution. In evolutionary epistemology, one tries to\naccount for the reliability of cognitive faculties in terms of trial\nand error leading to survival. A rejoinder by theists is that survival\nalone is not necessarily linked to true beliefs. It could, in\nprinciple, be false beliefs that enhance survival. In fact, some\natheists think that believing in God has been crucial to\npeople’s survival, though the belief is radically false.\nEvolutionary epistemologists reply that the lack of a\nnecessary link between beliefs that promote survival and\ntruth and the fact that some false beliefs or unreliable belief\nproducing mechanisms promote survival nor falls far short of\nundermining evolutionary epistemology. See Martin (1990), Mackie\n(1983), and Tooley (see Tooley’s chapters 2, 4, and 6 in\nPlantinga & Tooley 2008), among others, object to the epistemic\nteleological argument. \nAnother recent development in teleological argumentation has involved\nan argument from fine-tuning. \nFine tuning arguments contend that life would not exist were it not\nfor the fact that multiple physical parameters (e.g., the cosmological\nconstant and the ratio of the mass of the neutron to the mass of the\nproton) have numerical values that fall within a range of values known\nto be life-permitting that is very narrow compared to the range of\nvalues that are compatible with current physical theory and are known\nto be life-prohibiting. For example, even minor changes to the nuclear\nweak force would not have allowed for stars, nor would stars have\nendured if the ratio of electromagnetism to gravity had been much\ndifferent. John Leslie observes:  \nAlterations by less than one part in a billion to the expansion speed\nearly in the Big Bang would have led to runaway expansion, everything\nquickly becoming so dilute that no stars could have formed, or else to\ngravitational collapse inside under a second. (Leslie 2007: 76)  \nRobin Collins and others have argued that theism better accounts for\nthe fine tuning than naturalism (see Collins 2009; for criticism of\nthe argument, see Craig & Smith 1993). For a collection of\narticles covering both sides of the debate and both biological and\ncosmological design arguments, see Manson 2003. \nA more sustained objection against virtually all versions of the\nteleological argument takes issue with the assumption that the cosmos\nis good or that it is the sort of thing that would be brought about by\nan intelligent, completely benevolent being. This leads us directly to\nthe next central concern of the philosophy of God.  \nIf there is a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and completely good,\nwhy is there evil? The problem of evil is the most widely considered\nobjection to theism in both Western and Eastern philosophy. There are\ntwo general versions of the problem: the deductive or logical version,\nwhich asserts that the existence of any evil at all (regardless of its\nrole in producing good) is incompatible with God’s existence;\nand the probabilistic version, which asserts that given the quantity\nand severity of evil that actually exists, it is unlikely that God\nexists. The deductive problem is currently less commonly debated\nbecause many (but not all) philosophers acknowledge that a thoroughly\ngood being might allow or inflict some harm under certain morally\ncompelling conditions (such as causing a child pain when removing a\nsplinter). More intense debate concerns the likelihood (or even\npossibility) that there is a completely good God given the vast amount\nof evil in the cosmos. Such evidential arguments from evil may be\ndeductive or inductive arguments but they include some attempt to show\nthat some known fact about evil bears a negative evidence relation to\ntheism (e.g., it lowers its probability or renders it improbable)\nwhether or not it is logically incompatible with theism. Consider\nhuman and animal suffering caused by death, predation, birth defects,\nravaging diseases, virtually unchecked human wickedness, torture,\nrape, oppression, and “natural disasters”. Consider how\noften those who suffer are innocent. Why should there be so much\ngratuitous, apparently pointless evil? \nIn the face of the problem of evil, some philosophers and theologians\ndeny that God is all-powerful and all-knowing. John Stuart Mill took\nthis line, and panentheist theologians today also question the\ntraditional treatments of Divine power. According to panentheism, God\nis immanent in the world, suffering with the oppressed and working to\nbring good out of evil, although in spite of God’s efforts, evil\nwill invariably mar the created order. Another response is to think of\nGod as being very different from a moral agent. Brian Davies and\nothers have contended that what it means for God to be good is\ndifferent from what it means for an agent to be morally good (Davies\n2006). See also Mark Murphy’s 2017 book God’s Own\nEthics; Norms of Divine Agency and the Argument from Evil. A\ndifferent, more substantial strategy is to deny the existence of evil,\nbut it is difficult to reconcile traditional monotheism with moral\nskepticism. Also, insofar as we believe there to be a God worthy of\nworship and a fitting object of human love, the appeal to moral\nskepticism will carry little weight. The idea that evil is a privation\nor twisting of the good may have some currency in thinking through the\nproblem of evil, but it is difficult to see how it alone could go very\nfar to vindicate belief in God’s goodness. Searing pain and\nendless suffering seem altogether real even if they are analyzed as\nbeing philosophically parasitic on something valuable. The three great\nmonotheistic, Abrahamic traditions, with their ample insistence on the\nreality of evil, offer little reason to try to defuse the problem of\nevil by this route. Indeed, classical Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\nare so committed to the existence of evil that a reason to reject evil\nwould be a reason to reject these religious traditions. What would be\nthe point of the Judaic teaching about the Exodus (God liberating the\npeople of Israel from slavery), or the Christian teaching about the\nincarnation (Christ revealing God as love and releasing a Divine power\nthat will, in the end, conquer death), or the Islamic teaching of\nMohammed (the holy prophet of Allah, whom is all-just and\nall-merciful) if slavery, hate, death, and injustice did not\nexist? \nIn part, the magnitude of the difficulty one takes the problem of evil\nto pose for theism will depend upon one’s commitments in other\nareas of philosophy, especially ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics.\nIf in ethics you hold that there should be no preventable suffering\nfor any reason, regardless of the cause or consequence, then the\nproblem of evil will conflict with your acceptance of traditional\ntheism. Moreover, if you hold that any solution to the problem of evil\nshould be evident to all persons, then again traditional theism is in\njeopardy, for clearly the “solution” is not evident to\nall. Debate has largely centered on the legitimacy of adopting some\nmiddle position: a theory of values that would preserve a clear\nassessment of the profound evil in the cosmos as well as some\nunderstanding of how this might be compatible with the existence of an\nall powerful, completely good Creator. Could there be reasons why God\nwould permit cosmic ills? If we do not know what those reasons might\nbe, are we in a position to conclude that there are none or that there\ncould not be any? Exploring different possibilities will be shaped by\none’s metaphysics. For example, if you do not believe there is\nfree will, then you will not be moved by any appeal to the positive\nvalue of free will and its role in bringing about good as offsetting\nits role in bringing about evil. \nTheistic responses to the problem of evil distinguish between a\ndefense and a theodicy. A defense seeks to establish that rational\nbelief that God exists is still possible (when the defense is employed\nagainst the logical version of the problem of evil) and that the\nexistence of evil does not make it improbable that God exists (when\nused against the probabilistic version). Some have adopted the defense\nstrategy while arguing that we are in a position to have rational\nbelief in the existence of evil and in a completely good God who hates\nthis evil, even though we may be unable to see how these two beliefs\nare compatible. A theodicy is more ambitious and is typically part of\na broader project, arguing that it is reasonable to believe that God\nexists on the basis of the good as well as the evident evil of the\ncosmos. In a theodicy, the project is not to account for each and\nevery evil, but to provide an overarching framework within which to\nunderstand at least roughly how the evil that occurs is part of some\noverall good—for instance, the overcoming of evil is itself a\ngreat good. In practice, a defense and a theodicy often appeal to\nsimilar factors, the first and foremost being what many call the\nGreater Good Defense. \nIn the Greater Good Defense, it is contended that evil can be\nunderstood as either a necessary accompaniment to bringing about\ngreater goods or an integral part of these goods. Thus, in a version\noften called the Free Will Defense, it is proposed that free creatures\nwho are able to care for each other and whose welfare depends on each\nother’s freely chosen action constitute a good. For this good to\nbe realized, it is argued, there must be the bona fide\npossibility of persons harming each other. The free will defense is\nsometimes used narrowly only to cover evil that occurs as a result,\ndirect or indirect, of human action. But it has been speculatively\nextended by those proposing a defense rather than a theodicy to cover\nother evils which might be brought about by supernatural agents other\nthan God. According to the Greater Good case, evil provides an\nopportunity to realize great values, such as the virtues of courage\nand the pursuit of justice. Reichenbach (1982), Tennant (1930),\nSwinburne (1979), and van Inwagen (2006) have also underscored the\ngood of a stable world of natural laws in which animals and humans\nlearn about the cosmos and develop autonomously, independent of the\ncertainty that God exists.  Some atheists accord value to the good of\nliving in a world without God, and these views have been used by\ntheists to back up the claim that God might have had reason to create\na cosmos in which Divine existence is not overwhelmingly obvious to\nus. If God’s existence were overwhelmingly obvious, then\nmotivations to virtue might be clouded by self-interest and by the\nbare fear of offending an omnipotent being. Further, there may even be\nsome good to acting virtuously even if circumstances guarantee a\ntragic outcome. John Hick (1966 [1977]) so argued and has developed\nwhat he construes to be an Irenaean approach to the problem of evil\n(named after St. Irenaeus of the second century). On this approach, it\nis deemed good that humanity develops the life of virtue gradually,\nevolving to a life of grace, maturity, and love. This contrasts with a\ntheodicy associated with St.  Augustine, according to which God made\nus perfect and then allowed us to fall into perdition, only to be\nredeemed later by Christ. Hick thinks the Augustinian model fails\nwhereas the Irenaean one is credible. \nSome have based an argument from the problem of evil on the charge\nthat this is not the best possible world. If there were a supreme,\nmaximally excellent God, surely God would bring about the best\npossible creation. Because this is not the best possible creation,\nthere is no supreme, maximally excellent God. Following Adams (1987),\nmany now reply that the whole notion of a best possible world, like\nthe highest possible number, is incoherent. For any world that can be\nimagined with such and such happiness, goodness, virtue and so on, a\nhigher one can be imagined. If the notion of a best possible world is\nincoherent, would this count against belief that there could be a\nsupreme, maximally excellent being? It has been argued on the contrary\nthat Divine excellences admit of upper limits or maxima that are not\nquantifiable in a serial fashion (for example, Divine omnipotence\ninvolves being able to do anything logically or metaphysically\npossible, but does not require actually doing the greatest number of\nacts or a series of acts of which there can be no more). \nThose concerned with the problem of evil clash over the question of\nhow one assesses the likelihood of Divine existence. Someone who\nreports seeing no point to the existence of evil or no justification\nfor God to allow it seems to imply that if there were a point they\nwould see it. Note the difference between seeing no point and not\nseeing a point. In the cosmic case, is it clear that if there were a\nreason justifying the existence of evil, we would see it? William Rowe\nthinks some plausible understanding of God’s justificatory\nreason for allowing the evil should be detectable, but that there are\ncases of evil that are altogether gratuitous. Defenders like William\nHasker (1989) and Stephen Wykstra (1984) reply that these cases are\nnot decisive counter-examples to the claim that there is a good God.\nThese philosophers hold that we can recognize evil and grasp our duty\nto do all in our power to prevent or alleviate it. But we should not\ntake our failure to see what reason God might have for allowing evil\nto count as grounds for thinking that there is no reason. This later\nmove has led to a position commonly called skeptical theism.\nMichael Bergmann, Michael Rea, William Alston and others have argued\nthat we have good reason to be skeptical about whether we can assess\nwhether ostensibly gratuitous evils may or may not be permitted by an\nall-good God (Bergmann 2012a and 2012b, 2001; Bergmann & Rea 2005;\nfor criticism see Almeida & Oppy 2003; Draper 2014, 2013,\n1996). Overall, it needs to be noted that from the alleged fact that\nwe would be unlikely to see a reason for God to allow some evil if\nthere were one, it only follows that our failure to see such a reason\nis not strong evidence against theism. \nFor an interesting practical application of the traditional problem of\nevil to the topic of the ethics of procreation, see Marsh 2015. It has\nbeen argued that if one does believe that the world is not good, then\nthat can provide a prima facie reason against procreation.\nWhy should one bring children into a world that is not good? Another\ninteresting, recent development in the philosophy of religion\nliterature has been the engagement of philosophers with ostensible\nevils that God commands in the Bible (see Bergmann, Murray, & Rea\n2010). For a fascinating engagement with the problem of evil that\nemploys Biblical narratives, see Eleonore Stumps’ Wandering\nin Darkness (2010). The treatment of the problem of evil has also\nextended to important reflection on the suffering of non-human animals\n(see S. Clark 1987, 1995, 2017; Murray 2008; Meister 2018). Problems\nraised by evil and suffering are multifarious and are being addressed\nby contemporary philosophers across the religious and non-religious\nspectrums. See, for example, The History of Evil edited by\nMeister and Taliaferro, in six volumes with over 130 contributors from\nvirtually all religious and secular points of view, and the recent\nThe Cambridge Companion to the Problem of Evil edited by\nMeister and Moser (2017). \nSome portraits of an afterlife seem to have little bearing on our\nresponse to the magnitude of evil here and now. Does it help to\nunderstand why God allows evil if all victims will receive happiness\nlater? But it is difficult to treat the possibility of an afterlife as\nentirely irrelevant. Is death the annihilation of persons or an event\ninvolving a transfiguration to a higher state? If you do not think\nthat it matters whether persons continue to exist after death, then\nsuch speculation is of little consequence. But suppose that the\nafterlife is understood as being morally intertwined with this life,\nwith opportunity for moral and spiritual reformation, transfiguration\nof the wicked, rejuvenation and occasions for new life, perhaps even\nreconciliation and communion between oppressors seeking forgiveness\nand their victims. Then these considerations might help to defend\nagainst arguments based on the existence of evil. Insofar as one\ncannot rule out the possibility of an afterlife morally tied to our\nlife, one cannot rule out the possibility that God brings some good\nout of cosmic ills.  \nThe most recent work on the afterlife in philosophy of religion has\nfocused on the compatibility of an individual afterlife with some\nforms of physicalism. Arguably, a dualist treatment of human persons\nis more promising. If you are not metaphysically identical with your\nbody, then perhaps the annihilation of your body is not the\nannihilation of you. Today, a range of philosophers have argued that\neven if physicalism is true, an afterlife is still possible (Peter van\nInwagen, Lynne Baker, Trenton Merricks, Kevin Corcoran). The import of\nthis work for the problem of evil is that the possible redemptive\nvalue of an afterlife should not be ruled out (without argument) if\none assumes physicalism to be true. (For an extraordinary, rich\nresource on the relevant literature, see The Oxford Handbook of\nEschatology, edited by J. Walls, 2007.) \nPerhaps the justification most widely offered for religious belief\nconcerns the occurrence of religious experience or the cumulative\nweight of testimony of those claiming to have had religious\nexperiences. Putting the latter case in theistic terms, the argument\nappeals to the fact that many people have testified that they have\nfelt God’s presence. Does such testimony provide evidence that\nGod exists? That it is evidence has been argued by Jerome Gellman,\nKeith Yandell, William Alston, Caroline Davis, Gary Gutting, Kai-Man\nKwan, Richard Swinburne, Charles Taliaferro, and others. That it is\nnot (or that its evidential force is trivial) is argued by Michael\nMartin, J. L. Mackie, Kai Nielson, Matthew Bagger, John Schellenberg,\nWilliam Rowe, Graham Oppy, and others. In an effort to stimulate\nfurther investigation, consider the following sketch of some of the\nmoves and countermoves in the debate.  \nObjection: Religious experience cannot be experience\nof God for perceptual experience is only sensory and if God is\nnon-physical, God cannot be sensed. \nReply: The thesis that perceptual experience is only\nsensory can be challenged. Yandell marks out some experiences (as when\none has “a feeling” someone is present but without having\nany accompanying sensations) that might provide grounds for\nquestioning a narrow sensory notion of perceptual experience. \nObjection: Testimony to have experienced God is only\ntestimony that one thinks one has experienced God; it is only\ntestimony of a conviction, not evidence. \nReply: The literature on religious experience\ntestifies to the existence of experience of some Divine being on the\nbasis of which the subject comes to think the experience is of God. If\nread charitably, the testimony is not testimony to a conviction, but\nto experiences that form the grounds for the conviction. (See Bagger\n1999 for a vigorous articulation of this objection, and note the reply\nby Kai-man Kwam 2003). \nObjection: Because religious experience is unique,\nhow could one ever determine whether it is reliable? We simply lack\nthe ability to examine the object of religious experience in order to\ntest whether the reported experiences are indeed reliable. \nReply: As we learned from Descartes, all our\nexperiences of external objects face a problem of uniqueness. It is\npossible in principle that all our senses are mistaken and we do not\nhave the public, embodied life we think we lead. We cannot step out of\nour own subjectivity to vindicate our ordinary perceptual beliefs any\nmore than in the religious case. (See the debate between William\nAlston [2004] and Evan Fales [2004]). \nObjection: Reports of religious experience differ\nradically and the testimony of one religious party neutralizes the\ntestimony of others. The testimony of Hindus cancels out the testimony\nof Christians. The testimony of atheists to experience God’s\nabsence cancels out the testimony of “believers”. \nReply: Several replies might be offered here.\nTestimony to experience the absence of God might be better understood\nas testimony not to experience God. Failing to experience God might be\njustification for believing that there is no God only to the extent\nthat we have reason to believe that if God exists God would be\nexperienced by all. Theists might even appeal to the claim by many\natheists that it can be virtuous to live ethically with atheist\nbeliefs. Perhaps if there is a God, God does not think this is\naltogether bad, and actually desires religious belief to be fashioned\nunder conditions of trust and faith rather than knowledge. The\ndiversity of religious experiences has caused some defenders of the\nargument from religious experience to mute their conclusion. Thus,\nGutting (1982) contends that the argument is not strong enough to\nfully vindicate a specific religious tradition, but that it is strong\nenough to overturn an anti-religious naturalism. Other defenders use\ntheir specific tradition to deal with ostensibly competing claims\nbased on different sorts of religious experiences. Theists have\nproposed that more impersonal experiences of the Divine represent only\none aspect of God. God is a person or is person-like, but God can also\nbe experienced, for example, as sheer luminous unity. Hindus have\nclaimed the experience of God as personal is only one stage in the\noverall journey of the soul to truth, the highest truth being that\nBrahman transcends personhood. (For a discussion of these objections\nand replies and references, see Taliaferro 1998.) \nHow one settles the argument will depend on one’s overall\nconvictions in many areas of philosophy. The holistic, interwoven\nnature of both theistic and atheistic arguments can be readily\nillustrated. If you diminish the implications of religious experience\nand have a high standard regarding the burden of proof for any sort of\nreligious outlook, then it is highly likely that the classical\narguments for God’s existence will not be persuasive. Moreover,\nif one thinks that theism can be shown to be intellectually confused\nfrom the start, then theistic arguments from religious experience will\ncarry little weight. Testimony to have experienced God will have no\nmore weight than testimony to have experienced a round square, and\nnon-religious explanations of religious experience—like those of\nFreud (a result of wish-fulfillment), Marx (a reflection of the\neconomic base), or Durkheim (a product of social forces)—will\nincrease their appeal. If, on the other hand, you think the theistic\npicture is coherent and that the testimony of religious experience\nprovides some evidence for theism, then your assessment of the\nclassical theistic arguments might be more favorable, for they would\nserve to corroborate and further support what you already have some\nreason to believe. From such a vantage point, appeal to\nwish-fulfillment, economics, and social forces might have a role, but\nthe role is to explain why some parties do not have experiences of God\nand to counter the charge that failure to have such experiences\nprovides evidence that there is no religious reality. (For an\nexcellent collection of recent work on explaining the emergence and\ncontinuation of religious experience, see Schloss & Murray (eds.)\n2009.) \nThere is not space to cover the many other arguments for and against\nthe existence of God, but several additional arguments are briefly\nnoted. The argument from miracles starts from specific extraordinary\nevents, arguing that they provide reasons for believing there to be a\nsupernatural agent or, more modestly, reasons for skepticism about the\nsufficiency of a naturalistic world view. The argument has attracted\nmuch philosophical attention, especially since David Hume’s\nrejection of miracles. The debate has turned mainly on how one defines\na miracle, understands the laws of nature, and specifies the\nprinciples of evidence that govern the explanation of highly unusual\nhistorical occurrences. There is considerable debate over whether\nHume’s case against miracles simply begs the question against\n“believers”. Detailed exposition is impossible in this\nshort entry. Taliaferro has argued elsewhere that Hume’s case\nagainst the rationality of belief in miracles is best seen as part of\nhis overall case for a form of naturalism (Taliaferro 2005b). \nThere are various arguments that are advanced to motivate religious\nbelief. One of the most interesting and popular is a wager argument\noften associated with Pascal (1623–1662). It is designed to\noffer practical reasons to cultivate a belief in God. Imagine that you\nare unsure whether there is or is not a God. You have it within your\npower to live on either assumption and perhaps, through various\npractices, to get yourself to believe one or the other. There would be\ngood consequences of believing in God even if your belief were false,\nand if the belief were true you would receive even greater good. There\nwould also be good consequences of believing that there is no God, but\nin this case the consequences would not alter if you were correct. If,\nhowever, you believe that there is no God and you are wrong, then you\nwould risk losing the many goods which follow from the belief that God\nexists and from actual Divine existence. On this basis, it may seem\nreasonable to believe there is a God. \nIn different forms the argument may be given a rough edge (for\nexample, imagine that if you do not believe in God and there is a God,\nhell is waiting). It may be put as an appeal to individual\nself-interest (you will be better off) or more generally (believers\nwhose lives are bound together can realize some of the goods\ncomprising a mature religious life). Objectors worry about whether one\never is able to bring choices down to just such a narrow\nselection—for example, to choose either theism or naturalism.\nSome think the argument is too thoroughly egotistic and thus offensive\nto religion. Many of these objections have generated some plausible\nreplies (Rescher 1985). (For a thoroughgoing exploration of the\nrelevant arguments, see the collection of essays edited by Jeffrey\nJordan (1994).) \nRecent work on Pascalian wagering has a bearing on work on the nature\nof faith (is it voluntary or involuntary?), its value (when, if ever,\nis it a virtue?), and relation to evidence (insofar as faith involves\nbelief, is it possible to have faith without evidence?). For an\noverview and promising analysis, see Chappell (1996), Swinburne\n(1979), and Schellenberg (2005). A promising feature of such new work\nis that it is often accompanied by a rich understanding of revelation\nthat is not limited to a sacred scripture, but sees a revelatory role\nin scripture plus the history of its interpretation, the use of\ncreeds, icons, and so on (see the work of William Abraham [1998]). \nA burgeoning question in recent years is whether the cognitive science\nof religion (CSR) has significance for the truth or rationality of\nreligious commitment. According to CSR, belief in supernatural agents\nappears to be cognitively natural (Barrett 2004, Kelemen 2004, Dennett\n2006, De Cruz, H., & De Smedt, J. 2010) and easy to spread (Boyer\n2001). The naturalness of religion thesis has led some, including\nAlvin Plantinga it seems (2011: 60), to imply that we have scientific\nevidence for Calvin’s sensus divinitatis. But others\nhave argued that CSR can intensify the problem of divine hiddenness,\nsince diverse religious concepts are cognitively natural and early\nhumans seem to have lacked anything like a theistic concept (Marsh\n2013). There are many other questions being investigated about CSR,\nsuch as whether it provides a debunking challenge to religion (Murray\n& Schloss 2009), whether it poses a cultural challenge for\nreligious outlooks like Schellenberg’s Ultimism (Marsh 2014),\nand whether it challenges human dignity (Audi 2013). Needless to say,\nat the present time, there is nothing like a clear consensus on\nwhether CSR should be seen as worrisome, welcome, or neither, by\nreligious believers. \nFor some further work on the framework of assessing the evidence for\nand against theism (and other religious and secular worldviews) see C.\nS. Evans 2010, Chandler and Harrison 2012. In the last twenty years\nthere has been increasing attention given to the aesthetic dimension\nof arguments for and against religiously significant conceptions of\nultimate reality and of the meaning of life (see Brown 2004; Wynn\n2013; Hedley 2016; Mawson 2016; Taliaferro & Evans 2010,\n2013). \nIn the midst of the new work on religious traditions, there has been a\nsteady, growing representation of non-monotheistic traditions. An\nearly proponent of this expanded format was Ninian Smart\n(1927–2001), who, through many publications, scholarly as well\nas popular, secured philosophies of Hinduism and Buddhism as\ncomponents in the standard canon of English-speaking philosophy of\nreligion.  \nSmart championed the thesis that there are genuine differences between\nreligious traditions. He therefore resisted seeing some core\nexperience as capturing the essential identity of being religious.\nUnder Smart’s tutelage, there has been considerable growth in\ncross-cultural philosophy of religion. Wilfred Cantwell Smith\n(1916–2000) also did a great deal to improve the representation\nof non-Western religions and reflection. See, for example, the\nRoutledge series Investigating Philosophy of Religion with\nRoutledge with volumes already published or forthcoming on Buddhism\n(Burton 2017), Hinduism (Ranganathan 2018), Daoism, and Confucianism.\nThe five volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Religion\n(mentioned earlier) to be published by Wiley Blackwell (projected for\n2021) will have ample contributions on the widest spectrum of\nphilosophical treatments of diverse religions to date. \nThe explanation of philosophy of religion has involved fresh\ntranslations of philosophical and religious texts from India, China,\nSoutheast Asia, and Africa. Exceptional figures from non-Western\ntraditions have an increased role in cross-cultural philosophy of\nreligion and religious dialogue. The late Bimal Krishna Matilal\n(1935–1991) made salient contributions to enrich Western\nexposure to Indian philosophy of religion (see Matilal 1882). Among the\nmid-twentieth-century Asian philosophers, two who stand out for\nspecial note are T.R.V. Murti (1955) and S.N. Dasgupta\n(1922–1955). Both brought high philosophical standards along\nwith the essential philology to educate Western thinkers. As evidence\nof non-Western productivity in the Anglophone world, see Arvind Sharma\n1990 and 1995. There are now extensive treatments of pantheism and\nstudent-friendly guides to diverse religious conceptions of the\ncosmos.  \nThe expanded interest in religious pluralism has led to extensive\nreflection on the compatibility and possible synthesis of religions.\nJohn Hick is the preeminent synthesizer of religious traditions. Hick\n(1973 a and b)) advanced a complex\npicture of the afterlife involving components from diverse traditions.\nOver many publications and many years, Hick has moved from a broadly\nbased theistic view of God to what Hick calls “the Real”,\na noumenal sacred reality. Hick claims that different religions\nprovide us with a glimpse or partial access to the Real. In an\ninfluential article, “The New Map of the Universe of\nFaiths” (1973a), Hick raised the possibility that many of the\ngreat world religions are revelatory of the Real.  \nSeen in [an] historical context these movements of faith—the\nJudaic-Christian, the Buddhist, the Hindu, the Muslim—are not\nessentially rivals. They began at different times and in different\nplaces, and each expanded outwards into the surrounding world of\nprimitive natural religion until most of the world was drawn up into\none or the other of the great revealed faiths. And once this global\npattern had become established it has ever since remained fairly\nstable… Then in Persia the great prophet Zoroaster appeared;\nChina produced Lao-tzu and then the Buddha lived, the Mahavira, the\nfounder of the Jain religion and, probably about the end of this\nperiod, the writing of the Bhagavad Gita; and Greece produced\nPythagoras and then, ending this golden age, Socrates and Plato. Then\nafter the gap of some three hundred years came Jesus of Nazareth and\nthe emergence of Christianity; and after another gap the prophet\nMohammed and the rise of Islam. The suggestion that we must\nconsider is that these were all movements of the divine\nrevelation. (Hick 1989: 136; emphasis added) \nHick sees these traditions, and others as well, as different meeting\npoints in which a person might be in relation to the same reality or\nthe Real:  \nThe great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions\nof, and correspondingly different responses to, the Real from within\nthe major variant ways of being human; and that within each of them\nthe transformation of human existence from self-centeredness to\nReality-centeredness is taking place. (1989: 240)  \nHick uses Kant to develop his central thesis.  \nKant distinguishes between noumenon and phenomenon, or between a\nDing an sich [the thing itself] and the thing as it appears\nto human consciousness…. In this strand of Kant’s\nthought—not the only strand, but the one which I am seeking to\npress into service in the epistemology of religion—the noumenal\nworld exists independently of our perception of it and the phenomenal\nworld is that same world as it appears to our human\nconsciousness…. I want to say that the noumenal Real is\nexperienced and thought by different human mentalities, forming and\nformed by different religious traditions, as the range of gods and\nabsolutes which the phenomenology of religion reports. (1989:\n241–242) \nOne advantage of Hick’s position is that it undermines a\nrationale for religious conflict. If successful, this approach would\noffer a way to accommodate diverse communities and undermine what has\nbeen a source of grave conflict in the past.  \nHick’s work since the early 1980s provided an impetus for not\ntaking what appears to be religious conflict as outright\ncontradictions. He advanced a philosophy of religion that paid careful\nattention to the historical and social context. By doing so, Hick\nthought that apparently conflicting descriptions of the sacred could\nbe reconciled as representing different perspectives on the same\nreality, the Real (see Hick 2004, 2006). \nThe response to Hick’s proposal has been mixed. Some contend\nthat the very concept of “the Real” is incoherent or not\nreligiously adequate. Indeed, articulating the nature of the Real is\nno easy task. Hick writes that the Real  \ncannot be said to be one thing or many, person or thing, substance or\nprocess, good or bad, purposive or non-purposive. None of the concrete\ndescriptions that apply within the realm of human experience can apply\nliterally to the unexperienceable ground of that realm…. We\ncannot even speak of this as a thing or an entity. (1989: 246).  \nIt has been argued that Hick has secured not the equal acceptability\nof diverse religions but rather their unacceptability. In their\nclassical forms, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity diverge. If, say,\nthe Incarnation of God in Christ did not occur, isn’t\nChristianity false? In reply, Hick has sought to interpret specific\nclaims about the Incarnation in ways that do not commit Christians to\nthe “literal truth” of God becoming enfleshed. The\n“truth” of the Incarnation has been interpreted in such\nterms as these: in Jesus Christ (or in the narratives about Christ)\nGod is disclosed. Or: Jesus Christ was so united with God’s will\nthat his actions were and are the functional display of God’s\ncharacter. Perhaps as a result of Hick’s challenge,\nphilosophical work on the incarnation and other beliefs and practice\nspecific to religious traditions have received renewed attention (see,\nfor example, Taliaferro and Meister 2009). Hick has been a leading,\nwidely appreciated force in the expansion of philosophy of religion in\nthe late twentieth century.  \nIn addition to the expansion of philosophy of religion to take into\naccount a wider set of religions, the field has also seen an expansion\nin terms of methodology. Philosophers of religion have re-discovered\nmedieval philosophy—the new translations and commentaries of\nmedieval Christian, Jewish, and Islamic texts have blossomed. There is\nnow a self-conscious, deliberate effort to combine work on the\nconcepts in religious belief alongside a critical understanding of\ntheir social and political roots (the work of Foucault has been\ninfluential on this point), feminist philosophy of religion has been\nespecially important in re-thinking what may be called the ethics of\nmethodology and, as this is in some respects the most current debate\nin the field, it is a fitting point to end this entry by highlighting\nthe work of Pamela Sue Anderson (1955–2017) and others. \nAnderson (1997 and 2012) seeks to question respects in which gender\nenters into traditional conceptions of God and in their moral and\npolitical repercussions. She also advances a concept of method which\ndelimits justice and human flourishing. A mark of legitimation of\nphilosophy should be the extent to which it contributes to human\nwelfare. In a sense, this is a venerable thesis in some ancient,\nspecifically Platonic philosophy that envisaged the goal and method of\nphilosophy in terms of virtue and the good. Feminist philosophy today\nis not exclusively a critical undertaking, critiquing\n“patriarchy”. For a constructive, subtle treatment of\nreligious contemplation and practice, see Coakley 2002. Another key\nmovement that is developing has come to be called Continental\nPhilosophy of Religion. A major advocate of this new turn is John\nCaputo. This movement approaches the themes of this entry (the concept\nof God, pluralism, religious experience, metaphysics and epistemology)\nin light of Heidegger, Derrida, and other continental philosophers.\n(For a good representation of this movement, see Caputo 2001 and\nCrocket, Putt, & Robins 2014.)","contact.mail":"taliafer@stolaf.edu","contact.domain":"stolaf.edu"}]
