Connexive\nlogics have a standard logical vocabulary and comprise certain\nnon-theorems of classical logic as theses. Since classical\npropositional logic is Post-complete, any additional axiom in its\nlanguage gives rise to the trivial system, so that any non-trivial\nsystem of connexive logic will have to leave out some theorems of\nclassical logic. The name ‘connexive logic’ was introduced\nby Storrs McCall (1963, 1964) and suggests that systems of connexive\nlogic are motivated by some ideas about coherence or connection\nbetween the premises and the conclusions of valid inferences or\nbetween the antecedent and the succedent (consequent) of valid\nimplications. The kind of coherence in question concerns the meaning\nof implication and negation (see the entries on\n indicative conditionals,\n the logic of conditionals,\n counterfactuals,\n and\n negation).\n One basic idea is that no formula provably implies or is implied by\nits own negation. This conception may be expressed by requiring that\nfor every formula A,\n\n\n⊬ ~A → A and ⊬ A →\n~ A,\n\n\n\nbut usually the underlying intuitions are expressed by requiring that\ncertain schematic formulas are theorems:\n\n\nAT: ~(~A → A) and\n\nAT′: ~(A → ~A).\n\n\n\nThe first formula is often called Aristotle’s Thesis.\nIf this non-theorem of classical logic is found plausible, then the\nsecond principle, AT′, would seem to enjoy the same degree of\nplausibility. Indeed, also AT′ is sometimes referred to as\nAristotle’s Thesis, for example in Routley 1978, Mortensen 1984,\nRoutley and Routley 1985, and Ferguson 2016. As McCall (1975, p. 435)\nexplains, \n\n\n[c]onnexive logic may be seen as an attempt to formalize the species\nof implication recommended by Chrysippus:\n\n\nAnd those who introduce the notion of connection say that a\nconditional is sound when the contradictory of its consequent is\nincompatible with its antecedent. (Sextus Empiricus, translated in\nKneale and Kneale 1962, p. 129.)\n\n\n\n\nUsing intuitionistically acceptable means only, the pair of theses AT\nand AT′ is equivalent in deductive power with another pair of\nschemata, which in established terminology are called (Strong)\nBoethius’ Theses (cf. Routley 1978) and which may be\nviewed, in addition with their converses, as capturing\nChrysippus’ idea: \n\n\nBT: (A → B) → ~(A →\n~B) and\n\nBT′: (A → ~B) → ~(A →\nB).\n\n\n\nThe names ‘Aristotle’s Theses’ and\n‘Boethius’ Theses’ are, of course, not arbitrarily\nchosen. As to AT, it is argued in Aristotle’s Prior\nAnalytics 57b14 that it is impossible that if not-A,\nthen A, see Łukasiewicz 1957, p. 50. Note, however, that\nŁukasiewicz and Kneale (1957, p. 66) maintain that Aristotle is\nmaking a mistake here. Moreover, Boethius has been said to hold\nin De Syllogismo Hypothetico 843D that ‘if A\nthen not-B’ is the negation of ‘if A,\nthen\nB’, (“he said that the negative of Si est A,\nest B was Si est A, non est B,” Kneale and Kneale\n1962, p. 191). If we look at De Syllogismo\nHypothetico 843C-D, we find:\n\n\nSunt autem hypotheticae propositiones, aliae quidem affirmativae, aliae\nnegativae […] affirmativa quidem, ut cum dicimus, si est\na, est b; si non est a, non est b;\nnegativa, si est a, non est b, si non est\na, non est b. Ad consequentem enim propositionem\nrespiciendum est, ut an affirmativa an negativa sit propositio\njudicetur.\n\n\n\nBoethius here draws a distinction between affirmative and negative\nconditionals and explains that negative conditionals have the form\n‘if a, then not b’ and ‘if not\na, then not b.’ This statement is quite\ndifferent from the reading offered by Kneale and Kneale. Note that AT\nfollows from BT′ and AT′ follows from BT in logics in\nwhich A → A is theorem and modus ponens is an\nadmissible inference rule. \n\n\nLet L be a language containing a unary connective ~\n(negation) and a binary connective → (implication). A logical\nsystem in a language extending L is called a connexive\nlogic if AT, AT′, BT, and BT′ are theorems and,\nmoreover, implication is non-symmetric, i.e., (A →\nB) → (B → A) fails to be a\ntheorem (so that → can hardly be understood as a bi-conditional).\nThis is the now standard notion of connexive logic. The connective\n→ in a system of connexive logic is said to be a connexive\nimplication. \n\n\nSystems of connexive logic have been motivated and arrived at by\ndifferent considerations. One motivation comes from relevance logic\nand the idea that semantic consequence is a content relationship, see\nsection 3.1. Moreover, principles of connexive logic have been\ndiscussed in conditional logic, see section 3.2 and the entries on\n indicative conditionals,\n the logic of conditionals, and\n counterfactuals,\n in different accounts of negation, see section 3.3 and the entry on\n negation,\n and in approaches to contra-classical logics, see section 3.4.\nAnother motivation emerges from empirical research on the\ninterpretation of negated conditionals in natural language and the aim\nto adequately model the semantical intuitions revealed by these\ninvestigations, see section 3.5.\n\n\nRichard Angell in his seminal paper on connexive logic (1962) aimed at\ndeveloping a logic of subjunctive, counterfactual conditionals in\nwhich what he called a ‘principle of subjunctive\ncontrariety,’ ∼((A → B) ∧\n(A → ~B)), is provable. His proof system,\nPA1, contains BT as an axiom. Also Kapsner and Omori\n(2017) suggest that a connexive implication is suitable for\nformalizing counterfactual conditionals, whereas Cantwell (2008), for\nexample, suggested a system of connexive logic to formalize indicative\nnatural language conditionals. According to McCall (1975, p. 451),\n“[o]ne of the most natural interpretations of connexive\nimplication is as a species of physical or ‘causal’\nimplication,” and in McCall (2014) he argues that “[t]he\nlogic of causal and subjunctive conditionals is … connexive,\nsince ‘If X is dropped, it will hit the floor’ contradicts\n‘If X is dropped, it will not hit the floor’.”\nBoethius’ Thesis BT indeed appears on a list of principles every\n“precausal” connective should satisfy, see Urchs 1994.\nMcCall (2012, p. 437), however, concedes that “causal logic is\nstill very much an ongoing project, and no agreed-on formulation of it\nhas yet been achieved.” Moreover, the characteristic connexive\nprinciples are valid for the analysis of conditionals, generics, and\ndisposition statements presented in van Rooij and Schulz 2019a, 2019b.\n\n\n\nFurther motivation for systems of connexive logic comes from more\ninstrumental studies. In McCall 1967, connexive implication is\nmotivated by reproducing in a first-order language all valid moods of\nAristotle’s syllogistic (see the entry on\n Aristotle’s logic).\n In particular, the classically invalid inference from ‘All\nA is B’ to ‘Some A is\nB’ is obtained by translating ‘Some A is\nB’ as ∃x(~(A(x) →\n~B(x))), where → is a connexive implication. In\nWansing 2007, connexive implication is motivated by introducing a\nnegation connective into Categorial Grammar in order to express\nnegative information about membership in syntactic categories (see the\nentry on\n typelogical grammar).\n Consider, for example, the syntactic category (type) (n\n→ s) of intransitive verbs, i.e., of expressions that in\ncombination with a name (an expression of type n) result in a\nsentence (an expression of type s). The idea is that an\nexpression is of type ~(n → s) iff in\ncombination with a name it results in an expression that is not a\nsentence. In other words, an expression belongs to type ~(n\n→ s) iff it is of type (n → ~s).\nIn the short note Besnard 2011, Aristotle’s thesis AT′ is\nmotivated as expressing a notion of rule consistency for rule-based\nsystems in knowledge representation. A further motivation arises from\nthe problem of modelling conditional obligations in deontic logic.\nWeiss (2019) suggests to understand a certain implication that\nvalidates Aristotle’s theses and weak versions of\nBoethius’ theses (cf. sections 2 and 3.2) as expressing a\nconditional obligation operator. Yet another motivation arises from\nthe problem of modelling conditional obligations in deontic logic.\nAnother motivation in terms of applications comes from non-classical\nmathematics. There is an extended literature on mathematical theories\nbased on non-classical logics, including intutionistic, fuzzy,\nrelevant, and linear arithmetic and paraconsistent set theory. Early\ncontributions in the context of connexive logic are McCall’s\n1967 connexive class theory, and Wiredu’s 1974 paper on\nconnexive set theory. Ferguson (2016, 2019) takes up the challenge of\ninvestigating the prospects for a connexive mathematics and explores\nthe feasibility of a connexive arithmetic. \n\nThere are several further and some diverging notions of a connexive\nlogic. In particular, the second decade of the 21st century has\n(unfortunately) seen the introduction of confusingly many new notions\nof connexivity and non-uniform terminology. McCall (1966) introduced\nconnexive logics as systems ranging from logics in which no\nproposition implies or is implied by its own negation to logics in\nwhich BT is provable (together with non-symmetry of implication), and,\nsimilarly, Mares and Paoli (2019) characterize connexive logics as\nsystems having some or all of AT, AT′, BT, and BT′ among\ntheir theorems (without explicitly requiring non-symmetry of\nimplication). In McCall 2012, AT′ and BT are said to be the\ndistinguishing marks of connexive logic, but note that AT and\nBT′ are valid in the system CC1 due to Angell\n(1962) and MacCall (1966) as well. Logics in which some but not all of\nAT, AT′, BT, and BT′ are provable (or valid) are called\n‘demi-connexive’ in Wansing, Omori, and Ferguson 2016\n(without explicitly requiring non-symmetry of implication), and are\nsaid to be quasi-connexive in Jarmużek and Malinowski\n2019a.  The identification of the negation of (A\n→ B) with (A → ~B), ascribed to\nBoethius by Kneale and Kneale (1962), suggests a strengthening of BT\nand BT′ to the equivalences:  \nBTe: (A → B) ↔ ~(A →\n ~B) and\n\nBTe′: (A → ~B) ↔ ~ (A\n→ B).  \nSylvan 1989 refers to BTe as a principle of hyperconnexive\nlogic. The principles BTe and BTe′ are characteristic of the\nconnexive logics developed subsequent to the definition of the\nconnexive logic C and its quantified version\nQC in Wansing 2005. According to McCall (2012), the\nconverse of BT (the right-to-left direction of BTe) is highly\nunintuitive in light of what he takes to be counterexamples from\nEnglish. For a rejoinder see Wansing and Skurt 2018.  \nKapsner (2012, 2019) refers to a logic that satisfies AT, AT′,\nBT, and BT′ and, moreover, satisfies the requirements  \nas strongly connexive, whereas if the conditions Unsat1 and\nUnsat2 are not both satisfied, the system is only called weakly\nconnexive. Kapsner motivates the extra conditions by two\nintuitions, namely that it is not the case that a formula  A\nshould imply or be implied by its own negation, and that if A\nimplies B, then A does not imply not-B (and\nif A implies not-B, then A does not imply\nB). These intuitions may, however, also be seen to motivate\n⊬ ~A → A and ⊬ A →\n~ A, respectively (A →B) ⊬\n(A → ~B) and (A → ~B)\n⊬ (A → B) instead of Unsat1 and Unsat2.\nMoreover, imposing Unsat1 and Unsat2 precludes systems that satisfy\nthe variable sharing property (i.e., broadly relevant or\nsociative logics in Routley’s (1989) terminology, for\nwhich it holds that if A → B is a theorem, then\nA and B share at least one propositional variable)\nand satisfy the deduction theorem from being connexive. So far only\nfew strongly connexive logics satisfying the non-symmetry of\nimplication condition are known, namely the system\nCC1, which, however, “is an awkward system in\nmany ways” (McCall 2012, p. 429), see section 4.1, and the\nBooelan connexive relatedness logics from Jarmużek and Malinowski\n2019a, see section 4.4. In Wansing and Unterhuber 2019, logics that\nsatisfy AT and AT′ but validate Boethius’ theses only in rule\nform ((A → B) ⊢ ~(A →\n~B) and (A → ~B) ⊢ ~(A\n→ B)) are called weakly connexive. Weiss (2019)\nconsiders a language with classical negation, ¬, classical\nimplication, ⊃, and another binary conditional, →, (notation\nadjusted). He calls a logic half-connexive if it validates\nthe Weak Boethius’ Theses: \nand refers to a logic as connexive if in addition it validates AT and\nAT′ for → and ¬. The Weak Boethius’ Thesis BTw\nwas introduced in Pizzi 1977 as “conditional Boethius’\nthesis” for the connexive implication seen as standing for a\ncounterfactual conditional.  \nIn Kapsner 2019, the demand of strong connexivity is evaluated as\n“too stringent a requirement,” and the notion of plain\nhumble connexivity is introduced by restricting Aristotle’s\ntheses, Boethius’ theses, Unsat1, and Unsat2 to satisfiable\nantecedents. A survey of the terminology and various notions of\nconnexivity used in the literature is presented in the\n Supplement on Terminology. \n It remains to be seen whether all the notions in addition to the\nestablished concept of connexive logic will turn out to be\nconducive.  \nIf a language is used in which implication is not taken as primitive\nbut is defined in terms of other connectives, connexive logics could\nalso be seen as diverging from the orthodoxy of classical logic by\ngiving a deviant account of those connectives. A definition of a\nconnexive implication in terms of negation, conjunction, and necessity\ncan be found in McCall 1966 and Angell 1967b. More recently, Francez\n(2019b) suggested the notion of “poly-connexivity” to\nhighlight a modification of the familiar falsity conditions of\nconjunctions and disjunctions (in addition to adopting falsity\nconditions of implications as expressed by BTe′).  \nMcCall (2012) emphasizes that there is a history of two thousand three\nhundred years of connexive implication. Historical remarks on\nconnexive logic may be found, for instance, in Kneale and Kneale 1962,\nSylvan 1989, Priest 1999, Nasti De Vincentis 2002, Nasti De Vincentis\n2004, Nasti De Vincentis 2006, Estrada-González &\nRamirez-Cámara forthcoming, and McCall 2012. In the latter\nsurvey, McCall refers to ~((A → B) ∧\n(~A → B)) as Aristotle’s Second\nThesis and, following Martin 2004, to Angell’s principle of\nsubjunctive contrariety ~((A → B) ∧\n(A → ~B)) as Abelard’s First\nPrinciple, which is called Strawson’s Thesis in,\nfor example, Routley 1978 and Mortensen 1984. Aristotle’s Second\nThesis and Abelard’s First Principle are interderivable with BT\nand with BT′, respectively, using intuitionistic principles\nonly. Besides Peter Abelard, another medieval philosophers who\ndiscussed and endorsed connexive principles was Richard Kilwardby, see\nJohnston 2019. El-Rouayheb (2009, p. 215) reports on a critical\ndiscussion in thirteenth-century Arabic philosophy of\nAristotle’s thesis AT for impossible antecedents. Modern\nconnexive logic commenced with Nelson 1930, Angell 1962, and McCall\n1966, while MacColl (1878) may be regarded as a forerunner. After\nsmall numbers of publications from the 1960s until the 1990s, with\nS. McCall, R. Routley, and C. Pizzi as the main contributors, in the\n21st century a vigorous new interest in connexive logic\nemerged. Remarks on the history of modern connexive logic can be found\nin sections 3–5.  \nOne question arising from a historical point of view is that of\nexegetical correctness. Can Aristotle’s and Boethius’\ntheses indeed be traced back to Aristotle and Boethius? Lenzen (forthcoming)\nbelieves that Aristotle and Boethius intended the theses named after\nthem as “applicable only to ‘normal’ conditionals\nwith antecedents which are not self-contradictory.” He states\ncorrespondingly restricted versions of Aristotle’s theses in the\nlanguage of modal propositional logic, principles which according to\nLenzen (2019) can be found in Leibniz’s writings (after a\ntransformation from Leibniz’s term logic into a system of\npropositional logic) and where, notation adjusted, &Rarr; stands for\nstrict implication:  \ncf. also the modalized versions of AT′ and BT in Unterhuber\n2016. Lenzen remarks that LEIB1 and LEIB2 are theorems of almost all\nsystems of normal modal logic and therefore do not lead to any\nnon-classical system of connexive logic. A similar observation is made\nin Kapsner 2019. As to Boethius, the question has been raised whether\nit is adequate to render his term logic as a propositional logic (see\nMartin 1991, McCall 2012), and Bonevac and Dever (2012, p. 192) refer\nto Abelard’s First Principle as the most famous thesis\nattributed to Boethius but note that they fail to find it in Boethius.\nIrrespective of these exegetical issues, however, the challenge of\nconnexive logic remains, namely to define nontrivial and\nwell-motivated logical systems that validate both Aristotle’s\nand Boethius’ theses and satisfy non-symmetry of\nimplication. Another question arising from the long history of\nconnexive logic is in which sense the system nowadays called\nclassical logic is indeed classical. A critical discussion of\nthe classicality of classical logic from the point of view of\nparaconsistent and connexive logic can found in Wansing and Odintsov\n2016.  \nSystems of connexive logic can be looked and arrived at from different\nperspectives. Although some of these viewpoints are closely\ninterrelated, it may be helpful to briefly outline them separately.\n \nRoutley (1978), see also Sylvan 1989 (2000, chapter 5), suggested a\nconception of connexive logic different from McCall’s. If the\nrequirement of a connection between antecedent and succedent of a\nvalid implication is understood as a content connection, and if a\ncontent connection obtains if antecedent and succedent are\nrelevant to each other, then “the general classes of\nconnexive and relevant logics are one and the same” (Routley\n1978, p. 393), cf. also Sarenac and Jennings 2003, where the\nconnection between McCall’s connexive system CC1,\npresented in section 4.1, and relevance preservation is studied. \nSince every non-trivial system of connexive logic in the vocabulary of\nclassical logic has to omit some classical tautologies, and since the\nstandard paradoxes of non-relevant, material implication can be\navoided by rejecting Conjunctive Simplification, i.e., (A\n∧ B) → A and (A ∧ B)\n→ B, Routley requires for a connexive logic the\nrejection or qualification of Conjunctive Simplification (or\nequivalent schemata). Although according to Routley (1978, Routley\net al. 1982) and Routley and Routley (1985) the idea of\nnegation as cancellation, see sections 3.3 and 4.3., motivates both\nthe failure of Conjunctive Simplification and AT’ and BT, the\nmodel-theoretic semantics for connexive logics developed in Routley\n1978, see section 4.2, makes use of what has later come to be known as\nthe Routley star negation, see the entry on\n negation.\n  \nIf the contraposition rule and uniform substitution are assumed and\nimplication is transitive, the combination of Conjunctive\nSimplification and Aristotle’s Theses results in negation\ninconsistency, i.e., there are formulas A such that\nA and its negation ~A are both theorems, see, for\nexample, Woods 1968 and Thompson 1991. Non-trivial negation\ninconsistent logics (with a transitive consequence relation) must be\nparaconsistent. Using certain three-valued truth tables, Mortensen\n(1984) pointed out that there are inconsistent but non-trivial systems\nsatisfying both AT′ and Simplification. Examples of non-trivial\ninconsistent systems of connexive logic satisfying Conjunctive\nSimplification are presented in section 4.5. The availability of such\nconnexive systems may be appreciated in view of the fact that\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory based on a system of connexive logic with\nSimplification is inconsistent, see Wiredu 1974. Mortensen (1984) also\npointed out that the addition of AT′ to the relevance logic\nR of Anderson and Belnap has a trivializing effect, a\nfact shown in Routley et al. 1982 as well.  \nThe relation between connexive logic and relevance logic can also be\nseen as follows. Let A and B be contingent formulas\nof classical propositional logic, i.e., formulas that are neither\nconstantly false nor constantly true. It is well-known that then the\nfollowing holds in classical logic:  \nIf property (iii) is generalized to arbitrary formulas A and\nB, it is called the variable sharing property or\nvariable sharing principle, which is generally seen as a necessary\ncondition on a logic to count as a relevance logic (see the entry\n logic: relevance).\n So-called containment logics (also called Parry systems or systems of analytic implication, see Parry 1933, Anderson and Belnap 1975, Fine\n1986, Ferguson 2015), satisfy the strong relevance requirement that if\n⊢ A → B, then every propositional\nvariable of B is also a propositional variable of A.\nThe variable sharing property indicates a content connection between\nA and B if B is derivable from A\n(or, semantically, A entails B). The properties (i)\nand (ii) may be viewed to express a content connection requirement on\nthe derivability relation in a negative way. If one wants to\nexpress these constraints in terms of the provability of object\nlanguage formulas, one naturally arrives at Aristotle’s and\nBoethius’ theses.  \nConnexive relevance logics that combine the ternary frame semantics\nfrom relevance logic and the adjustment of falsity conditions along\nthe lines of the connexive logic C (see section\n4.5.1) have been studied in Omori 2016a and Francez 2019, cf. sections\n4.2 and 4.5.  \nPrinciples of connexive logic have been discussed in conditional logic\n(see the entry\n logic: conditional),\n beginning with Ramsey’s (1929) comments on what is now called\nthe Ramsey Test, as pointed out, e.g., in McCall 2012 and Ferguson\n2014: \nAngell (1966, 1967a, 1978) refers to AT′ as the Law of\nConditional Non-Contradiction. Usually, Abelard’s First\nPrinciple, ~((A → B) ∧ (A →\n~B)) is considered as a principle of conditional\nnon-contradiction and as such is endorsed by some philosophers, e.g.,\nGibbard (1981, p. 231), Lowe (1995, p. 47), and Bennett (2003, p. 84),\nwithout making any reference to connexive logic. Conditional\nnon-contradiction fails, however, to be a valid principle in the\nsemantics suggested by Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973), cf. the\ndiscussion in Unterhuber 2013. The restrictedly connexive logics\npresented in Weiss 2019 that validate Aristotle’s theses, BTw,\nand BTw′ stand in the tradition of Stalnaker and Lewis and are\ngiven an algebraic semantics that builds on the algebraic semantics\nfor conditional logics from Nute 1980.  \nAnother motivation for connexive logic from the perspective of\nconditional logic has been presented by John Cantwell (2008) without\nnoting that the introduced propositional logic is a system of\nconnexive logic. Cantwell considers the denial of indicative\nconditionals in natural language and argues that the denial of, say,\nthe conditional ‘If Oswald didn’t kill Kennedy, Jack Ruby\ndid.’ amounts to the assertion that if Oswald didn’t shoot\nKennedy then neither did Jack Ruby. This suggests that (A\n→ ~B) is semantically equivalent with ~(A\n→ B). Also Claudio Pizzi’s work on logics of\nconsequential implication has been motivated in the context of\nconditional logic, see Pizzi 1977 and section 5.  \nAs the characteristic connexive principles exhibit an implication and\na negation connective, it is not very surprising that connexive logic\ncan be approached also from considerations on the notion of negation.\nTwo different perspectives emerge with the ideas of negation as\ncancellation (erasure, neutralization, or subtraction) and negation as\nfalsity. Negation as cancellation is a conception of negation that can\nbe traced back to Aristotle’s Prior Analytics and is\noften associated with Strawson, who held that a “contradiction\ncancels itself and leaves nothing” (1952, p. 3). Routley (1978,\nRoutley et al. 1982), Routley and Routley 1985, and Priest\n1999 use the notion of subtraction negation to motivate connexive\nprinciples. Routley and Routley (1985, p. 205) present the\ncancellation view of negation as follows: \nNote that if a logic implements the cancellation view of negation, it\nwill also be paraconsistent because the ex contradictione\nquodlibet principle, (A ∧ ∼A) ⊢\nB, will not be valid. (The idea of ex contradictione\nnihil sequitur is discussed in Wagner 1991.) According to the\nRoutleys, a connection between the subtraction account of negation and\nAristotle’s thesis AT′ then arises as follows (Routley and\nRoutley 1985, p. 205):  \nAccordingly then, for Routley (Routley et al. 1982, p. 82)\nconnexivism has two leading theses, namely:  \nThe cancellation view of negation has been heavily criticized in\nWansing and Skurt 2018, where it is stressed that connexive logic can\nbe detached from the notion of negation as erasure and the failure of\nConjunctive Simplification.  \nThe notion of negation as definite falsity, in contrast to negation as\nabsence of truth, does not support the failure of Conjunctive\nSimplification but rather the failure of ex contradictione\nquodlibet if it is coupled with an understanding of inference as\ninformation flow, because the information that A ∧\n~A does not necessarily give the information that B,\nfor any B whatsoever. This suggests a separate treatment of\n(support of) truth and (support of) falsity conditions, which enables\nadopting the falsity conditions for implications represented by\nBTe′. \nHumberstone (2000) calls a logic contra-classical just in\ncase not every formula provable in the logic is provable in classical\nlogic (and, moreover, considers a more demanding notion of a\ncontra-classical logic by requiring that there is no way of\ntranslating its connectives in such a way that one obtains a subsystem\nof classical logic). There are several different kinds of\ncontra-classical logics, such as, for example, Abelian logics\ncontaining the axiom schema ((A → B) →\nB) → A, connexive logics, and logics of logical\nbilattices. The negation, truth order conjunction, weak implication,\nand information order disjunction fragment of Arieli and Avron’s\n(1996) bilattice logic BL⊃, for\nexample, is a standard propositional vocabulary containing a negation,\na conjunction, a disjunction, and a conditional. It is a non-trivial\nbut inconsistent logic and as such contra-classical.  \nIn Omori and Wansing 2018, a way of obtaining contra-classical logics\nis delineated, and in Estrada-Gónzalez (forthcoming) it is\ndiscussed in more detail. Following the pattern of the presentation of\nthe connexive logic C, cf. section 4.5.1, the general\nidea is that of keeping some standard (support of) truth conditions\nfor a logical operation and modifying its (support of) falsity\nconditions. From a bilateralist perspective that treats truth and\nfalsity as well as provability and disprovability or refutability as\nseparate semantical, respectively proof-theoretical dimensions that\nare on a par, there is also the strategy of keeping some standard\n(support of) falsity conditions for a logical operation and modifying\nits (support of) truth conditions. Connexive logic can be seen as\ncontributing to the exploration of roads to contra-classicality.  \nIn McCall 2012 one can find some results on testing the endorsement of\nconnexive principles (AT′, BT, and BT stated as a rule) given by\nindicative conditionals in English in concrete form on a group of 89\nnon-expert philosophy students at McGill University in Canada. These\nfindings support the intuition that laymen speakers of English\nsubscribe to those connexive principles to a rather high degree: 88%\nin the case of AT′, 85% in the case of BT in rule form, and 84%\nin the case of BT.  \nEmpirical studies on Aristotle’s theses have been carried out by\nPfeifer (2012), Pfeifer and Tulkki (2017), and Pfeifer and Yama (2017).\nIn one experiment, presented in Pfeifer 2012, the sample consisted of\n141 psychology students (110 females and 31 males) at the University\nof Salzburg, Austria. Both AT and AT′ were tested as abstract as\nwell as concrete indicative conditionals. In a second experiment, 40\nstudents without training in logic (20 females and 20 males) had to\nsolve tasks involving concrete indicative conditionals in English. In\nthis case, scope ambiguities arising from the negation of conditionals\nwere ruled out. Both experiments provide evidence against the\ninterpretation of indicative conditionals in English as Boolean\nimplication and support the connexive reading of negated implications\nexpressed by Aristotle’s theses. Pfeifer sees these findings as\nstrong evidence for interpreting indicative conditionals as\nconditional events. This interpretation predicts that people should\nstrongly believe that Aristotle’s theses are valid because the\nonly coherent assessment for them is the probability value 1.  \nPfeifer and Tulkki (2017) tested the interpretation of subjunctive\nversus indicative conditionals among a group of 60 students of the\nUniversity of Helsinki, Finland, (30 females and 30 males) and found\nno statistically significant differences between the endorsement of AT\nand AT′ (72%, respectively 77%). Another experiment presented in\nPfeifer and Yama 2017 found no cultural differences between the\nWestern samples and an Eastern sample when testing the endorsement of\nAT and AT′ among 63 Japanese university students from the\nGraduate School of Literature and Human Behavioral Sciences at Osaka\nCity University, with an endorsement of AT and AT′ by 65% and\n76% of the participants, respectively.  \nKhemlani et al. 2014 report on an experiment testing a sample\nof 21 native English-speaking participants on denying concrete natural\nlanguage conditionals (against the background of Johnson-Laird’s\nmental model theory, assuming classical logic). Whereas 28% of the\nparticipants endorsed denial conditions in accordance with classical\nlogic, 34% endorsed denial conditions according to Boethius’\nthesis BT.  \nAnother experiment on the negation of indicative conditionals is\npresented in Egré and Politzer 2013. They consider weakenings of the\nclassical conjunctive understanding of ~(A → B)\nas (A ∧ ~B) and the connexive reading as\n(A → ~B), namely (A ∧\n◊~B), respectively (A → ◊~B).\nExploiting the flexibility of the “tweaking of the falsity\nconditions”-approach to connexive logic, presented in sections\n3.7 and 4.5, Omori 2019 interprets (A →\n◊~B) in a variant of the modal logic BK\nfrom Odintsov and Wansing 2010 by suitably adjusting the falsity\ncondition for implications (A → B), so that\n~(A → B) is provably equivalent with\n(A → ◊~B).  \nModern modal logic started as a syntactical enterprise with C.I.\nLewis, who defined a series of axiom systems to capture notions of\nstrict implication. In a similar vein, Lewis’ student E. Nelson\ncame up with an axiom system from which Aristotle’s and\nBoethius’ theses can be derived. The system is called NL in Mares and Paoli 2019, where its axioms and\ninference rules are presented as follows (we here use schematic\nletters for arbitrary formulas instead of propositional variables and\na different symbol for negation):  \nwhere ◦ is a primitive binary consistency operator, (A|B)\n(inconsistency) is defined as ~(A ◦ B), A\n= B is defined as (A → B) ∧\n(B → A), A ≠ B as ~\n(A = B), and A ≠ B ≠\nC is an abbreviation of (A ≠ B) ∧\n(B ≠ C) ∧ (A ≠ C).\n \nProviding a sound and complete semantics for NL is an\nopen problem in connexive logic. Angell’s (1962) axiomatic proof\nsystem PA1 can also be seen as belonging to the\nproof-theoretical tradition because it is incomplete with respect the\ntruth tables presented by Angell. However, Angell proved\nPA1 to be sound with respect to these truth tables,\nthereby for the first time presenting a non-triviality proof for a\nformal system of connexive logic. Providing a sound and complete\nsemantics for PA1 is another open problem in\nconnexive logic.  \nIn proof-theoretic semantics, proof systems of a suitable form are\nseen as providing a meaning theory, see the entry\n proof-theoretic semantics.\n In that spirit, Francez (2016) presents two natural deduction proof\nsystems for a propositional language with negation and implication,\none in which AT, AT′, BT, and BT′ are provable, and\nanother one in which AT, AT′, and the following variations of\nBoethius’ theses are provable: \nFrancez motivates these principles by certain natural language\ndiscourses and a “dual Ramsey Test” that modifies the\nRamsey test by assuming that in the course of arguing “If\np will q?,” ~p is hypothetically\nadded to a stock of knowledge. Francez’ natural deduction rules\nare straightforwardly obtained by modifying the natural deduction\nrules for the negation and implications fragment of David\nNelsons’s four-valued constructive logic N4, cf.\nKamide and Wansing 2012, in the manner that leads from\nN4 to the constructive connexive logic\nC from Wansing 2005, cf. section 4.5.1. In Francez\n2019 the natural deduction system that gives AT, AT′, BT, and\nBT′ is relevantized as in the familiar natural deduction proof\nsystem for the implication fragment of the relevant logic\nR by introducing subscripts for book-keeping in order\nto avoid empty, irrelevant implication introductions. Omori (2016b)\nadds conjunction and disjunction to the language of Francez 2016,\ngives an axiomatization and a characterizing semantics for the natural\ndeduction system that allows to prove B3 and B4, and observes that\nalthough AT and AT′ are valid, BT, and BT′ are invalid,\nwhich prompts him to call the provable equivalence ~(A →\nB) ↔ (~A → B)\n“half-connexive”.  \nThe natural deduction proof system in Wansing 2016b can be seen a\ncontribution to a bilateralist proof-theoretic semantics for certain\nconnexive logics given in terms of provability as well as refutability\nconditions. In addition to a connexive implication that internalizes a\nnotion of provability into the object language, there is also a\nconnexive co-implication that internalizes a refutability relation.\nThe resulting bi-connexive logic 2C is a connexive\nvariant of the bi-intuitionistic logic 2Int from\nWansing 2016a, 2018. A natural deduction calculus for a quantum logic\nsatisfying Aristotle’s theses is presented in Kamide 2017. \nAccording to Schroeder-Heister 2009, Gentzen’s sequent calculus is a\n“more adequate formal model of hypothetical reasoning”\nthan natural deduction, and proof-theoretic semantics has also been\ndeveloped with respect to various kinds of sequent calculi. Sequent\nsystems for connexive logics can be found in Wansing 2007, Wansing\n2008, McCall 2014, Kamide and Wansing 2011, 2016, Kamide, Shramko and\nWansing 2017, and Kamide 2019.  \nA central approach to connexive logic is given by many-valued and\nmodel-theoretic semantics in terms of truth values or support of truth\nand support of falsity conditions. As explained in Omori and Wansing\n2019, the semantics of several connexive logics can be described as\neither (i) modifying some standard (support of) truth conditions of\nconditionals of a certain kind or keeping standard truth conditions in\ncombination with more complex model structures, or (ii) as tweaking\nthe standard (support of) falsity conditions of certain familiar\nimplications. Given the multitude of different connexive logics and\nthe flexibility of the adjustment of falsity conditions in combination\nwith standard (support of) truth conditions, this classification\nprovides a general perspective. \nA key observation for this classificatory enterprise comes from Omori\nand Sano 2015, where a mechanical procedure is described for turning\ntruth tables using the four generalized truth values of first-degree\nentailment logic, FDE, see the entries on\n truth values\n and\n  relevance logic\n and Omori and Wansing 2017, into pairs of positive and negative\nconditions in terms of containing or not containing the classical\ntruth values 0 and 1. Then, in McCall’s system\nCC1 a connexive conditional A →\nB receives a designated value (is true) in a model just in\ncase (i) A does not receive a designated value or B\ndoes and (ii) 0 belongs to the value of A iff it\nbelongs to the value of B. In this sense, the connexive\nimplication of Angell-McCall is obtained by adding a condition to the\ntruth condition for Boolean implication.  \nThe consequential conditional in the logics of consequential\nimplication investigated by Pizzi (1977, 1991, 1993, 1996, 2004, 2005,\n2008, 2018) and Pizzi and Williamson (1997, 2005) validates\nAristotle’s theses but fails to validate Boethius’ theses.\nIt is thus connexive only in a weak sense, but since the consequential\nimplication is a strict conditional that is required to satisfy some\nextra condition, also logics of consequential implication fit into the\nclassificatory scheme provided by the semantical perspective. The\nfollowing table is a slight extension of the summarizing overview from\nOmori and Wansing 2019 (with pointers to the relevant sections of the\npresent entry), where the approaches above the double line adjust\n(support of) truth conditions (or add semantical machinery to standard\ntruth conditions), whereas the approach below the double line tweaks\n(support of) falsity conditions:  \nA dialogical semantical treatment of connexive logic can be found in\nRahman and Rückert 2001.  \nWhereas the basic ideas of connexive logic can be traced back to\nantiquity, the search for formal systems with connexive implication\nseems to have begun only in the 19th century in the work of H. MacColl\n(1878), see also Rahman and Redmond 2008. The basic idea of connexive\nimplication was spelled out also by E. Nelson (1930), and a more\nrecent formal study of systems of connexive logic started in the\n1960s. In McCall 1966, S. McCall presented an axiomatization of a\nsystem of propositional connexive logic semantically introduced by\nAngell (1962) in terms of certain four-valued matrices. The language\nof McCall’s logic CC1 contains as primitive\n(notation adjusted) a unary connective ~ (negation) and the binary\nconnectives ∧ (conjunction) and → (implication). Disjunction\n∨ and equivalence ↔ are defined in the usual way. The\nschematic axioms and the rules of CC1 are as\nfollows: \nAmong these axiom schemata, only A12 is contra-classical. The system\nCC1 is characterized by the following four-valued\ntruth tables with designated values 1 and 2: \nMcCall emphasizes that the logic CC1 is only one\namong many possible systems satisfying the theses of Aristotle and\nBoethius. Although CC1 is a system of\nconnexive logic, its algebraic semantics appears to be only a formal\ntool with little explanatory capacity. In CC1, the\nconstant truth functions 1, 2,\n3, and 4 can be defined as follows\n(McCall1966, p. 421): 1 := (p →\np), 2 := ~(p ↔ ~p),\n3 := (p ↔ ~p),\n4 := ~(p→ p), for some\nsentence letter p. As Routley and Montgomery (1968, p. 95)\npoint out, CC1 “can be given a semantics by\nassociating the matrix value 1 with logical necessity, value 4 with\nlogical impossibility, value 2 with contingent truth, and value 3 with\ncontingent falsehood. However, many anomalies result; e.g. the\nconjunction of two contingent truths yields a necessary truth”.\nMoreover, McCall points out that CC1 has some\nproperties that are difficult to justify if the name ‘connexive\nlogic’ is meant to reflect the fact that in a valid implication\nA → B there exists some form of connection\nbetween the antecedent A and the succedent B. Axiom\nA4, for example, is bad in this respect. On the other hand,\nCC1 might be said to undergenerate, since (A\n∧ A) → A and A → (A\n∧ A) fail to be theorems of CC1. Routley\nand Montgomery (1968) showed that the addition of the latter formulas\nto only a certain subsystem of CC1 leads to\ninconsistency. For a defense of Angell’s PA1\nagainst Routley and Montgomery’s critical observations see Bode\n1979.  \nThese observations may well have distracted many non-classical\nlogicians from connexive logic at that time. If the validity of\nAristotle’s and Boethius’ Theses is distinctive of\nconnexive logics, it is, however, not quite clear how damaging the\nabove criticism is. In order to construct a more satisfactory system\nof connexive logic, McCall (1975) defined the notions of a connexive\nalgebra and a connexive model and presented an axiom system\nCFL that is characterized by the class of all\nconnexive models. In the language of CFL, however,\nevery implication is first-degree, i.e., no nesting of → is\npermitted. McCall refers to a result by R. Meyer showing that the\nvalid implications of CFL form a subset of the set of\nvalid material equivalences and briefly discusses giving up the\nsyntactic restriction to first-degree implication. Meyer (1977) showed\nthat the first-degree fragment of the normal modal logic\nS5 (and in fact every normal modal logic between\nKT and S5, cf. the entry\n logic: modal)\n and CFL are equivalent in the following sense: all\ntheorems of CFL are provable in S5\nif the connexive implication A → B is defined\nas □(A ⊃ B) ∧ (A ≡\nB), where ⊃ and ≡ are classical implication and\nequivalence, respectively, and every first-degree theorem of\nS5 is provable in CFL if\n□A (“it is necessary that A”) is\ndefined as (~p ∨ p)→A. In summary, it\nseems fair to say that as the result of the investigations into\nconnexive logic in the 1960s and 1970s, connexive logic, its ancient\nroots notwithstanding, appeared as a sort of exotic branch of\nnon-classical logic.  \nMore recently, Cantwell (2008) presented a truth table semantics for a\nsystem of connexive logic together with a proof-theoretical\ncharacterization. The truth tables for negation and implication are\ntaken from Belnap 1970. Cantwell considers a language containing the\nconstantly false proposition ⊥ and the following three-valued\ntruth tables for negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication\nwith designated values T and − (where ‘T’ stands for\ntruth and ‘F’ for falsity): \nIn this system, introduced as a system of conditional negation,\nCN, (A → ~B) and ~(A\n→ B) have the same value under every assignment of truth\nvalues to propositional variables. Cantwell’s system thus\nvalidates BTe and BTe′, and it turns out to be the connexive\nlogic MC from Wansing 2005, see section 4.5.3,\nextended by the Law of Excluded Middle, A ∨ ~A. A\ncertain expansion of CN is studied in Olkhovikov\n2002, 2016 and, independently, in Omori 2016c, see section 4.5.3.  \nA three-valued logic that validates Aristotle’s theses but not\nBoethius’ theses and that is subminimally connexive and Kapsner\nstrong in the terminology of Estrada-González &\nRamirez-Cámara 2016 is the three-valued logic\nMRSP that was introduced in\nEstrada-González 2008. In Estrada-González &\nRamirez-Cámara 2016, MRSP is\ndiscussed against the background of Cantwell’s three-valued\nconnexive logic CN and Mortensen’s (1984)\nthree-valued connexive logic, dubbed M3V by McCall\n(2012).  \nMcCall (2014) presents a cut-free sequent calculus for a system of\nconnexive logic that he calls “connexive Gentzen.” The\ncalculus has the non-standard feature of using pairs of axioms that\nare not logical truths. An annotation with subscripts is used to\nenable the elimination of dependencies on such non-standard axioms in\nthe course of a derivation. The resulting system differs from\nCC1 in that p → (p ∧\np) and (p ∧ p)→ p are\nprovable, and it is shown to be sound with respect to certain\nfour-valued matrices. Sound and complete cut-free sequent calculi for\ncertain constructive and modal connexive logics have been presented\nfor the first time in Wansing 2008 and Kamide and Wansing 2011.  \nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, connexive logic was subjected to\nsemantical investigations based on ternary frames for relevance\nlogics, making use of the Routley star negation that is distinctive of\nlogics “on the Australian Plan,” cf. Meyer and Martin\n1986. Routley (1978) obtained a semantic characterization of\nAristotle’s Thesis AT′ and Boethius’ Thesis BT using\na ‘generation relation’ G between a formula\nA and a possible world s. The semantics employs\nmodel structures F = <T,\nK, R, S, U, G, *>,\nwhere K is a non-empty set of possible worlds, T\n∈ K is a distinguished world (the ‘real\nworld’), R, S, and U are ternary\nrelations on K, G is a generation relation, and * is\na function on K mapping every world s to its\n‘opposite’ or ‘reverse’ s*. A\nvaluation is a function v that sends pairs of worlds and\npropositional variables into {0,1}, satisfying the following heredity\ncondition: if R(T, s, u) and\nv(p, s) = 1, then v(p,\nu) = 1. Intuitively, G(A, t) is\nsupposed to mean that everything that holds in world t is\nimplied by A. A model is a structure M\n= <F,\nv>. The relation M,\nt ⊨ A (“A is true at t\nin M”) is inductively defined as\nfollows: \n[Note: whenever there is little chance for ambiguity, we replace\nR(x, y, z) by\nRxyz.] \nMoreover, it is required that for every formula A and world\nt, G(A, t) implies \nM,\nt ⊨ A. A formula\nA is true in model\nM iff M,\nT ⊨ A, and\nA is valid with respect to a class of models if A is\ntrue in all models from that class. AT′ is semantically\ncharacterized by the following property of models: ∃t\n(R(T*, t, t*) and\nG(A, t)), and BT is characterized by\n∀w∃s, t, u\n(R(w, s, t),\nR(w*, s, u),\nG(A, s), and R(T,\nt, u*)). \nMortensen (1984), who considers AT′, explains that\nRoutley’s characterization of AT′ is “not\nparticularly intuitively enlightening” and points out that in\ncertain logics with a ternary relational models semantics another\ncharacterization of AT′ is available, namely the condition that\nfor every model M the set\nCA := {s : M,\ns ⊨ A and M,\ns ⊭ ~A} is\nnon-empty. Like Routley’s non-recursive requirement that\nG(A, t) implies M,\nt ⊨ A,\nMortensen’s condition is not a purely structural condition,\nsince it mentions the truth relation ⊨. Mortensen (1984, p. 114)\nmaintains that the condition CA ≠\n∅ “is closest to the way we think of Aristotle,” and\nemphasizes that for a self-inconsistent proposition A, the\nset CA must be empty, whence AT′ is\nto be denied. Mortensen also critically discusses the addition of\nAT′ to the relevance logic E. In this context,\nAT′ amounts to the condition that no implication is true at the\nworld T*. \nA more regular semantics for extensions of the basic relevance logic\nB (not to be confused with the truth valued read as\n“both true and false”) by either AT′ or BT has been\npresented in Brady 1989. In this semantics, conjunction is defined in\nthe standard way, and there is a non-empty subset of worlds O ⊆\nK. The set O contains the distinguished element T used to define truth in a model. The extended model structures contain a function ℑ\nthat maps sets of worlds, and in particular, interpretations of\nformulas (alias propositions) I(A) to sets of worlds\nin such a way that a formula A is true at a world t\niff t ∈ ℑ(I(A)). This allows\nBrady to state model conditions capturing AT′ and BT as\nfollows: \nBT: (∃x,y ∈ ℑ(f))\n(∃z ∈ K)\n(Rtxz and\nRt*yz*), for any proposition\nf and any t ∈ K. \nNote that these clauses still are not purely structural conditions but\nconditions on the interpretation of formulas. Also the investigations\ninto connexive logics based on ternary frames did not, as it seems,\nlead to establishing connexive logic as a fully recognized branch of\nnon-classical logic. \nAlbeit according to Routley (1978), Routley et al. (1982) and\nRoutley and Routley (1985) there is a close relation between connexive\nlogic and the idea of negation as cancellation, Routley suggested a\nsemantics using a generation relation and the star negation in ternary\nframes for relevance logics, whereas connexive logics based in a\nstraightforward way on the cancellation view of negation have been\nworked out by Priest (1999). Priest (1999) directly translates a\ndefinition of entailment that enforces the null-content account of\ncontradictions into evaluation clauses. A model is a structure \nM\n= <W, g,\nv>, where W is a non-empty set of possible\nworlds, g is a distinguished element from W, and\nv is a valuation function from the set of propositional\nvariables into the set of classical truth values {1, 0}. Two clauses\nfor evaluating implications at possible worlds are considered\n(notation adjusted): \nCondition (i) ensures that nothing is implied by an unsatisfiable\nantecedent. The evaluation clauses for the other connectives are\nclassical. A formula A is true in a model \n(M\n⊨ A) iff M,\ng ⊨ A; and\nA is valid iff A is true in every model. Condition\n(ii) ensures that the law of contraposition is valid. A set Δ of\nformulas is true in a model iff every element of Δ is true in\nthe model.  \nThere are two notions of entailment (Δ ⊨ A), one\ncoming with clause (a) the other with clause (b): \nThese two connexive logics arise from the idea of negation as\ncancellation in a straightforward way. They are neither monotonic nor\nclosed under uniform substitution. Proof systems and decision\nprocedures for them can be obtained from a straightforward faithful\ntranslation τ into the modal logic S5, cf. the\nentry\n logic: modal.\n For implications A → B the translation is\ndefined as follows, where ⊃ is material implication and ¬ is\nclassical negation: \nFerguson (2015) observes that the intersection of the semantical\nconsequence relations of variant (a) of Priest’s logic and the\nnegation, conjunction, disjunction fragment of Bochvar’s 3-valued\nlogic (cf. the entry\n many-valued logic)\n results in a known system of containment logic, namely the system\nRC presented in Johnson 1976. \nAlthough the semantics of Priest’s connexive logics is simple\nand transparent, the underlying idea of subtraction negation is not\nunproblematic. Priest (1999, 146) mentions strong fallibilists who\n“endorse each of their views, but also endorse the claim that\nsome of their views are false”. Their contradictory opinions in\nfact hardly are contentless, so that the cancellation account of\nnegation and, as a result, systems of connexive logic based on\nsubtraction negation appear not to be very well-motivated. In Skurt\nand Wansing 2018, it is argued that the metaphoric notion of negation\nas cancellation is conceptually unclear and that Routley’s\n(Routley et al. 1982)) suggestion to replace it by a notion\nof negation as subtraction in generalized arithmetic is unclear at\nleast insofar as it has not been worked out in detail.  \nThe Boolean connexive logics of Jarmużek and Malinowski 2019a are\nobtained in the framework of  relating logic, a\ngeneralization of relatedness logic. The latter is an\ninstance of what Sylvan (1989, p. 166) calls a\n“double-barrelled” analysis of implications, an analysis\nthat complements truth conditions with an additional\n“sieve” or “filter” that tightens the relation\nbetween antecedent and succedent. If the relation is meant to be a\nrelevance relation, this is an example of what Schurz 1998 calls\n“relevance post validity” in contrast to “relevance\nin validity” as investigated in relevance logic. Boolean\nconnexive logics extend the language of classical propositional logic\nusing conjunction, disjunction, and Boolean negation by a relating\nimplication, →w, the semantics of which is constrained\nby a binary relation R on the set of all formulas. A model\nthen is a pair <v,R>, where v is a classical valuation function. The truth condition for relating implication\nimposes the relatedness constraint:  \nand a notion of validity with respect to a relation R is\ndefined: R ⊨ A iff for every valuation\nv, v,R ⊨ A.  \nIn order to obtain connexive logics, Jarmużek and Malinowski\nintroduce the following conditions on binary relations R:\n \nThese conditions suffice to validate Aristotle’s and Boethius\ntheses. A correspondence between Aristotle’s and Boethius theses\nand conditions on R is obtained if the relations R\nare required to be closed under negation, i.e., for all formulas\nA and B, R(A, B) implies\nR(~A, ~B). Then,  \nHowever, these correspondences come at a price. Jarmużek and\nMalinowski point out that imposing negation closure validates the\notherwise refutable formula ~((A →wB) ∧ ~B ∧ ~(~A →w\n~B)) with respect to any relation R. Jarmużek and\nMalinowski also show that these five conditions are independent of\neach other and therefore give rise to 25 different logics.\nThe two connexive ones (alias properly connexive ones in Jarmużek and\nMalinowski’s terminology), i.e., the logic defined by means of\nconditions (a1), (a2), (a3), and (4) and the logic defined by in\naddition requiring negation closure, are also Kapsner strong.\nMoreover, Jarmużek and Malinowski present sound and complete tableau\ncalculi for these 25 logics.  \nThe basic paraconsistent logic FDE of first-degree\nentailment lacks a primitive implication connective and lends itself\nto adding an implication connective that validates Aristotle’s\nand Boethius’ theses by using the falsity conditions of\nimplications as expressed by BTe′. This is possible because\nnegation is treated according to “the American Plan,”\ni.e., by making use of four semantical values: T\n(“told true only”), F (“told false\nonly”), N (“neither told true nor told\nfalse”), and B (“both told true and told\nfalse”), so that support of truth and support of falsity emerge\nas two independent semantical dimensions:  \nNegation is then understood as leading from support of truth to\nsupport of falsity, and vice versa. The method of tweaking the\n(support of) falsity conditions can be applied to a number of\ndifferent conditionals, ranging from constructive, relevant, and\nmaterial (Boolean) implication to very weak implications studied in\nconditional logic with the help of so-called Segerberg\nframes.  \nA system of connexive logic with an intuitively plausible possible\nworlds semantics using a binary relation between worlds has been\nintroduced in Wansing 2005. In this paper it is observed that a\nmodification of the falsification conditions for negated implications\nin possible worlds models for David Nelson’s constructive\nfour-valued logic with strong negation results in a connexive logic,\ncalled C, which inherits from Nelson’s logic an\ninterpretation in terms of information states pre-ordered by a\nrelation of possible expansion of these states. For Nelson’s\nconstructive logics see, for example, Almukdad and Nelson 1984,\nGurevich 1977, Nelson 1949, Odintsov 2008, Routley 1974, Thomason\n1969, Wansing 2001, Kamide and Wansing 2012.  \nThe key observation for obtaining C is simple: in the\npresence of the double negation introduction law, it suffices to\nvalidate both BT′ and its converse ~(A →\nB) → (A → ~B). In other words, an\ninterpretation of the falsification conditions of implications is\ncalled for, which deviates from the standard conditions. In\nNelson’s systems of constructive logic, the double negation laws\nhold, and the relational semantics for these logics is such that\nfalsification and verification of formulas are dealt with separately.\nThe system N4 extends FDE by\nintuitionistic implication, however, the falsification conditions of\nimplications are the classical ones expressed by the schema\n~(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ~B).\nTo obtain a connexive implication, it is therefore enough to assume\nanother interpretation of the falsification conditions of\nimplications, namely the one expressed by BTe′: (A\n→ ~B) ↔ ~(A → B). \nConsider the language L := {∧, ∨, →, ~} based on\na denumerable set of propositional variables. Equivalence ↔ is\ndefined as usual. The schematic axioms and rules of the logic\nC are: \nClearly, a5 is the only contra-classical axiom of C.\nThe consequence relation ⊢C\n(derivability in C) is defined as usual. A\nC-frame is a pair F =\n<W, ≤ >, where ≤ is a reflexive and\ntransitive binary relation on the non-empty set W. Let\n<W, ≤ >+ be the set of all\nX ⊆ W such that if u ∈ X\nand u ≤ w, then w ∈ X. A\nC-model is a structure M\n= <W, ≤,\nv+, v− >,\nwhere <W, ≤ > is a C-frame\nand v+ and v− are\nvaluation functions from the set of propositional variables into\n<W, ≤ >+. Intuitively, W\nis a set of information states. The function v+\nsends a propositional variable p to the states in W\nthat support the truth of p, whereas\nv− sends p to the states that\nsupport the falsity of p. M =\n<W, ≤, v+,\nv− > is said to be the model based\non the frame <W, ≤ >. The relations \nM,\nt ⊨+A\n(“M supports the truth of\nA at t”) and M,\nt ⊨−A\n (“M\nsupports the falsity of A at\nt”) are inductively defined as follows: \nIf M = <W, ≤,\nv+, v− > is a\nC-model, then M ⊨\nA (“A is valid in M”)\niff for every t ∈\nW, M, t\n⊨+A. F\n⊨ A (“A is valid on F”)\niff M\n⊨ A for every model M\nbased on F. A formula is\nC-valid iff it is valid on every frame. Support of\ntruth and support of falsity for arbitrary formulas are persistent\nwith respect to the relation ≤ of possible expansion of information\nstates. That is, for any C-model M\n= <W, ≤,\nv+, v− > and\nformula A, if s ≤ t, then M,\ns ⊨+A\nimplies M, t\n⊨+A and M,\ns ⊨−A implies M,\nt ⊨−A. It can easily be shown that a negation normal form theorem\nholds. The logic C is characterized by the class of\nall C-frames: for any L-formula A,\n⊢CA iff A is\nC-valid. Moreover, C satisfies the\ndisjunction property and the constructible falsity property. If\n⊢CA ∨ B, then\n⊢CA or\n⊢CB. If\n⊢C ~(A ∧ B),\nthen ⊢C ~ A or\n⊢C ~B. Decidability of\nC follows from a faithful embedding into positive\nintuitionistic propositional logic. \nLike Nelson’s four-valued constructive logic\nN4, C is a paraconsistent logic (cf.\nthe entry\n logic: paraconsistent).\n Note that C contains contradictions, for example:\n⊢C ((p ∧ ~p)\n→ (~ p ∨ p)) and\n⊢C ~((p ∧ ~p)\n→ (~ p ∨ p)). It is obvious from the above\npresentation that C differs from N4\nonly with respect to the falsification (or support of falsity)\nconditions of implications. As in N4, provable strong\nequivalence is a congruence relation, i.e., the set {A :\n⊢CA} is closed under the\nrule A ↔ B, ~ A ↔ ~ B /\nC(A) ↔ C(B). Wansing (2005)\nalso introduces a first-order extension QC of\nC. Kamide and Wansing (2011) present a sound and\ncomplete sequent calculus for C and show the cut-rule\nto be admissible, which means that it can be dispensed with.  \nWhereas the direction from right to left of Axiom a5 can be justified\nby rejecting the view that if A implies B and\nA is inconsistent, A implies any formula, in\nparticular B, the direction from left to right seems rather\nstrong. If the verification conditions of implications are dynamic (in\nthe sense of referring to other states in addition to the state of\nevaluation), then a5 indicates that the falsification conditions of\nimplications are dynamic as well. The falsity of (A →\nB) thus implies that if A is true, B is\nfalse. Yet, one might wonder why it is not required that the\nfalsity of (A→ B) implies that if A is\ntrue, B is not true. This cannot be expressed in a\nlanguage with just one negation, ~, expressing falsity instead of\nabsence of truth (classically at the state of evaluation or\nintuitionistically at all related states). If one adds to\nC the further axiom ~A → (A\n→ B) to obtain a connexive variant of Nelson’s\nthree-valued logic N3, intuitionistic negation ¬\nis definable by setting: ¬A := A →\n~A. Then a5 might be replaced by \nThe resulting system satisfies AT, AT′, BT, and BT′\nbecause A → ¬ ~A and ~A →\n¬A are theorems. For BT, for example, we have: \nThis logic, however, is the trivial system consisting of every\nL-formula (a fact not noticed in Wansing 2005 (Section 6) but\npointed out in the online version of that paper). \nThe system C is a conservative extension of positive\nintuitionistic logic. In C, strong negation is\ninterpreted in such a way that it turns the intuitionistic implication\nof its negation-free sublanguage into a connexive implication.\nAnalogously, strong negation may be added to positive dual\nintuitionistic logic to obtain a system with a connexive\nco-implication, and to bi-intuitionistic logic, or to the logic\n2Int from Wansing 2016a that also contains an\nimplication and a co-implication connective, to obtain systems with\nboth a connexive implication and a connexive co-implications, see\nWansing 2008, 2016b, and Kamide and Wansing 2016.  \nThe systems C and QC are connexive\nbut not Kapsner strong. This is hardly surprising because these logics\nare paraconsistent and allow formulas A and ~A to be\nsimultaneously satisfiable in the sense that a state and all its\npossible expansions may support the truth of both A and\n~A. As a result, A → ~A and\n~A → A are satisfiable. If A →\n~A and ~A → A are unsatisfiable,\nstrong connexivity is in conflict with at the same time satisfying the\ndeduction theorem and defining semantical consequence as preservation\nof support of truth: A → ~A would entail\n~(A → ~A),  ~A → A would\nentail ~(~A → A), and the formulas (A\n→ ~A) → ~(A → ~A) and\n(~A → A) → ~(~A →A)\nwould be valid instead of unsatisifable.  \nThe starting point for Hitoshi Omori’s (2016a) definition of a\nconnexive extension of the basic relevance logic BD\n(see the entry\n logic: relevance)\n is to find a proof theory for extensions of BD with\nnegation treated according to the American Plan. Priest and Sylvan\n(1992) posed this as an open problem, and Omori gives a partial\nsolution by defining a connexive variant BDW of\nBD. The semantics uses models based on ternary\nframes. There is a base state g, the four truth values are\nrepresented as subsets of the set of classical truth values {0,1}, and\ninterpretations are defined in the style of Dunn (cf. Omori and\nWansing 2017). A model is quadruple <g, W,\nR, I>, where W is a non-empty set (of\nstates), g&in;W, R is a three-place\nrelation on W with Rgxy iff x = y,\nand I is a function that maps pairs consisting of a state and\na propositional variable to subsets of {0,1}. The interpretation\nfunction I is then extended to an assignment of truth values\nat states for all formulas as follows:  \nAn axiomatization of BDW is obtained from the axiom\nsystem for BD by adding BTe′. Like the\nconstructive connexive logic C, the connexive\nrelevance logic BDW is negation inconsistent but\nnon-trivial.  \nAdding ex contradictione quodlibet to system\nC has a trivializing effect, and adding the Law of\nExcluded Middle to C does not result in a logic that\nhas positive classical propositional logic as a fragment. However, if\nimplications A → B are understood as material,\nBoolean implications, then a separate treatment of falsity conditions\nagain allows introducing a system of connexive logic. The resulting\nsystem MC may be called a system of material\nconnexive logic. The semantics is quite obvious: a model M\nis just a function from the set of all\nliterals, i.e., propositional variables or negated propositional\nvariables, into the set of classical truth values {1, 0}. Truth of a\nformula A in a model M (M\n⊨ A) is inductively defined\nas follows:  \nA formula is valid iff it is true in all models. (Alternatively, one\ncould use the semantics of C and require the set of\nstates of a frame to be a singleton.) The set of all valid formulas is\naxiomatized by the following set of axiom schemata and rules: \nThe logic MC can be faithfully embedded into positive\nclassical logic, whence MC is decidable. The\nfollowing truth tables for MC, while considering a\nlanguage with a classical negation, resulting in a system called\n“dialetheic Belnap Dunn Logic,”    dBD, are\ngiven in Omori 2016c:  \nThe formula ~(A → B) → (A ∧\n~B) is, of course, not a theorem of MC. Like\nC, MC is a paraconsistent logic\ncontaining contradictions. The connexive logic MC\ndiffers from the four-valued logic HBe presented in\nAvron 1991 by making use of the above clause that guarantees the\nvalidity of BTe′, i.e.,  \nAs already mentioned, Cantwell’s three-valued connexive logic\nCN can be obtained by extending MC\nwith the Law of Excluded Middle and, semantically, by requiring that\nfor every propositional variable p and every model M,\nM ⊨\np or M ⊨ ~p.\nThere is another three-valued connexive logic that is strictly\nstronger than CN, namely the “dialetheic Logic\nof Paradox,” dLP, studied in Omori 2016c, which\nturned out to be equivalent with the system LImp from\nOlkhovikov 2002 (published in English translation in 2016). Whilst\nOlkhovikov uses a unary operator L, understood as a kind of necessity\noperator, in the language of LImp, Omori uses a unary\nconsistency operator, ○, in the language of\ndLP. The connective L is definable in\ndLP, and the connective ○ is definable in\nLImp. It is shown in Omori 2016c that\ndLP is inconsistent, definitionally complete, and\nPost complete. Both, Omori (2016c) and Olkhovikov (2016) consider a\nfirst-order extension of dLP, respectively\nLImp.  \nIt is quite natural to obtain an FDE-based connexive\nlogic by starting form David Nelson’s logic N4\nbecause the latter system’s intuitionistic implication is the\nweakest conditional satisfying modus ponens and the deduction theorem.\nThe conditionals studied within conditional logic in the tradition of\nRobert Stalnaker and David Lewis, where the conditional is usually\nwritten as ‘□→’, are much weaker than\nintuitionistic or relevant implication. The project of taking the\nbasic system of conditional logic CK introduced by\nBrian Chellas (1975) as the point of departure for obtaining connexive\nconditional logics has been carried out in Wansing and Unterhuber\n2019, and a similar approach is considered in Kapsner and Omori 2017.\nWhereas the semantics for the Lewis-Nelson models from Kapsner and\nOmori 2017 uses binary relations RA on a non-empty\nset of states, for every formula A, the Chellas-Segerberg\nsemantics employed in Wansing and Unterhuber 2019 uses binary\nrelations RX on a non-empty set of states, for\nsubsets X of the set of all states. Both versions of the\nsemantics can be equipped with sound and complete tableau calculi\n(although Kapsner and Omori only present the models), but the\nChellas-Segerberg semantics is suitable for developing a purely\nstructural correspondence theory in terms of properties of relations\nthat are language-independent insofar as they are not relativized to a\nformula.  \nA pair <W, R> is a Chellas frame (or just a frame) iff W is a non-empty set, intuitively understood as a set of information states, and R ⊆ W ×\nW × ℘(W), where ℘( W)\nis the powerset of W. Instead of Rww′\nX one usually writes\nwRXw′. Let\nW, R be a frame such that for all X ⊆\nW and w, w′ &in; W,\nwRXw′ implies\nw′ &in; X. Then M\n= <W, R,\nv+, v−> is a model for\nthe connexive conditional logic CCL iff\nv+ and v− are valuation\nfunctions from the set of propositional variables into ℘(\nW), the support of truth and support of falsity conditions\nfor propositional variables, negated formulas, conjunctions, and\ndisjunctions are defined as in the case of C-models\nand, moreover,  \nwhere [[A]] is the set of states that support the truth of\nA.  \nIf <W, R> is a Chellas frame, a triple\n<W, R, P> is said to be a Segerberg\nframe (or a general frame) for CCL if P\nis a binary relation on ℘(W) that satisfies certain\nclosure conditions. A quintuple M =\n<W, R, P, v+,\nv−> then is a general model for\nCCL if <W, R, P> is a\ngeneral frame for CCL, <W, R,\nv+, v−> is a model for\nCCL, and for every propositional variable p,\n[[p]],[[~p]] &in; P. The closure conditions\non P are exactly the conditions guaranteeing that for every\nformula A, [[A]],[[~A]] &in; P if\nfor every propositional variable p,\n[[p]],[[~p]] &in; P. If\n[[A]],[[~A]] is seen as the proposition expressed by\nA, then a general model for CCL is rich\nenough to guarantee that every proposition expressed by a formula is\navailable. This is needed for a purely structural correspondence\ntheory. The formula A □→ A, for example,\nis valid on a general frame iff it satisfies the frame condition:  \nGeneral frames for CCL are required to satisfy\ncondition CA □→ A in order to\nmake sure that Boethius’ theses are indeed validated. In\nUnterhuber and Wansing 2019 sound and complete tableau calculi are\npresented for CCL and the weaker system\ncCL that validates Aristotle’s theses but not\nBoethius’ theses and that is obtained by giving up\nCA □→ A. In Wansing and\nUnterhuber 2019 these results are then extended to systems that are\nobtained by adding a constructive implication to the language of\ncCL and CCL.  \nMcCall (2012) classifies the principles he calls Abelard’s\nFirst Principle and Aristotle’s Second Thesis (cf.\nsection 2) as connexive principles. In Wansing and Skurt 2018 it is\nargued that since Aristotle’s Second Thesis and Abelard’s\nFirst Principle both involve conjunction, one may think of obtaining\nmotivation for them from the idea of negation as cancellation and from\nthe failure of Simplification as justified by the erasure model of\nnegation. Like the other connexive logics considered in the present\nsection, CCL is a system in which Abelard’s\nFirst Principle and Aristotle’s Second Thesis fail to be valid.\n \nThere is a growing literature on modal extensions of connexive logics.\nIn Wansing 2005, the language of the connexive logic\nC is extended by modal operators □ and ◊\n(“it is possible that”) to define a connexive and\nconstructive analogue CK of the smallest normal modal\nlogic K. The system CK is shown to\nbe faithfully embeddable into QC, to be decidable,\nand to enjoy the disjunction property and the constructible falsity\nproperty. \nIt is well-known that intuitionistic propositional logic can be\nfaithfully embedded into the normal modal logic S4,\nwhich, like K, is based on classical propositional\nlogic (cf. the entries\n logic: intuitionistic\n and\n logic: modal).\n There exists a translation γ, due to Gödel, such that a\nformula A  of intuitionistic logic is intuitionistically\nvalid iff A’s γ-translation is valid in\nS4. In particular, intuitionistic implication is\nunderstood as strict material implication: γ(A →\nB) = □(γ(A) ⊃ γ(B)).\nKamide and Wansing (2011) define a sequent calculus for connexive\nS4 based on MC. This system,\nCS4, is shown to be complete with respect to a\nrelational possible worlds semantics. The proof uses a faithful\nembedding of CS4 into positive, negation-free\nS4. Moreover, it is shown that the cut-rule is an\nadmissible rule in CS4 and that the constructive\nconnexive logic C stand to CS4 as\nintuitionistic logic stands to S4. In the faithful\nembedding, the modal translation of negated implications is as\nexpected: γ(~(A → B)) =\n□(γ(A) ⊃ γ(~B)). A similar\ntranslation is used in Odintsov and Wansing 2010 to embed\nC into a modal extension BS4 of\nBelnap and Dunn’s four-valued logic.  \nIn CS4 the modal operators □ and ◊ are\nsyntactic duals of each other: the equivalence between\n□A and ~◊~A and between ◊A\nand ~□~A is provable. Kamide and Wansing (2011) also\npresent a cut-free sequent calculus for a connexive constructive\nversion CS4d– of\nS4 without syntactic duality between □ and\n◊. The relational possible worlds semantics for\nCS4d– is not fully\ncompositional, cf. Odintsov and Wansing 2004.\nCS4d– is faithfully\nembeddable into positive S4 and decidable. Moreover\nC is faithfully embeddable into\nCS4d–.  \nModal Boolean connexive relatedness logics are investigated in\nJarmużek and Malinowski 2019b, a modal extension of a\n“bi-classical” paraconsistent connexive logic is\nintroduced in Kamide 2019, and connexive variants of various modal\nextensions of FDE that are extensions of\nMC are studied in Odintsov, Skurt, and Wansing 2019.\n \nAristotle’s and Boethius’ theses express, as it seems,\nsome pre-theoretical intuitions about meaning relations between\nnegation and implication. But it is not clear that a language must\ncontain only one negation operation and only one implication. The\nlanguage of bi-intuitionistic logic contains two negations, the\nlanguage of the bi-intuitionistic connexive logics in Wansing 2016b and\nKamide & Wansing 2016 contain three negations, and the language of\nsystems of consequential implication comprises two\nimplication connectives together with one negation, see Pizzi 1977,\n1991, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2018, Pizzi and Williamson\n1997, 2005. Pizzi (2008, p. 127) considers a notion of\nconsequential relevance, namely that “[t]he antecedent\nand the consequent of a true conditional cannot have incompatible\nmodal status,” and suggests to capture consequential relevance\nby requiring that in any true conditional A →\nB, (i) A strictly implies B and (ii)\nA and B have the same modal status in the sense that\n□A ⊃ □B, □B ⊃\n□A, ◊A ⊃ ◊B, and\n◊B ⊃ ◊A are ture, where ⊃ is\nmaterial implication. Moreover, it is required that □A\n⊃ ◊A is always true.  \nIn Pizzi and Williamson 1997, a conditional satisfying (i) and (ii) is\ncalled an analytic consequential implication and the notion\nof a normal system of analytic consequential implication is defined.\n‘Normal’ here means that such a system contains certain\nformulas and is closed under certain rules. The smallest normal\nconsequential logic that satisfies AT is called CI.\nAlternatively, CI can be characterized as the\nsmallest normal system that satisfies the Weak Boethius’ Thesis,\ni.e, (A → B) ⊃ ¬(A →\n¬ B), where → is consequential implication and ¬\nis classical negation. In Omori and Wansing 2019 the semantics of\nCI is presented in a way showing that the semantics\nof the consequential conditional is obtained by tweaking the truth\nconditions of strict implication in Kripke models with a serial\naccessibility relation (so that □A ⊃\n◊A is valid). The standard truth conditions are\nsupplemented by requiring equal modal status for the antecedent and\nthe consequent.  \nPizzi and Williamson (1997) show that CI can be\nfaithfully embedded into the normal modal logic KD,\nand vice versa. Analytic consequential implication is interpreted\naccording to the following translation function φ: \nAs Pizzi and Williamson (1997, p. 571) point out, their investigation\nis a “contribution to the modal treatment of logics intermediate\nbetween logics of consequential implication and connexive\nlogics.” They emphasize a difficulty of regarding consequential\nimplication as a genuine implication connective by showing that in any\nnormal system of consequential logic that admits modus ponens for\nconsequential implication and contains BT, the following formulas are\nprovable: \nwhere ≡ is classical equivalence. Since (A →\nB) ↔ ~(A → ~B) is a theorem of\nC and other connexive logics, the more problematic\nfact, from the point of view of this system, is the provability of\n(a). Pizzi and Williamson also show that in any normal system of\nconsequential logic that contains BT, the formula (A →\nB) ≡ (A ≡ B) is provable if\n(A → B) ⊃ (A ⊃ B) is\nprovable, in other words, consequential implication collapses into\nclassical equivalence if (A → B) ⊃\n(A ⊃ B) is provable. The construction of\nAristotelian squares of opposition and their combination to\nAristotelian cubes in systems of consequential implication is\nconsidered in Pizzi 2008. Two kinds of consequential implication are\ndiscussed and compared to each other in Pizzi 2018. \nIn summary, it may be said that connexive logic, although it is\ncontra-classical and unusual in various respects, is not just a formal\ngame or gimmick. There are several kinds of systems of connexive\nlogics with different kinds of semantics and proof systems, and in the\n21st century the subject has been experiencing a renaissance. The\nintuitions captured by systems of connexive logic can be traced back\nto ancient roots, and applications of connexive logics range from\nAristotle’s syllogistic to Categorial Grammar, the study of\ncausal implications, and connexive mathematics. A monograph developing\na system of connexive logic in the context of solving a broad range of\nparadoxes is Angell 2002. ","contact.mail":"Heinrich.Wansing@rub.de","contact.domain":"rub.de"}]
