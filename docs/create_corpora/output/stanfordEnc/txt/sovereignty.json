It is a\nmodern notion of political authority. Historical variants can be\nunderstood along three dimensions — the holder of sovereignty,\nthe absoluteness of sovereignty, and the internal and external\ndimensions of sovereignty. The state is the political institution in\nwhich sovereignty is embodied. An assemblage of states forms a\nsovereign states system.\n\n\nThe history of sovereignty can be understood through two broad\nmovements, manifested in both practical institutions and political\nthought. The first is the development of a system of sovereign states,\nculminating at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Contemporaneously,\nsovereignty became prominent in political thought through the writings\nof Machiavelli, Luther, Bodin, and Hobbes. The second movement is the\ncircumscription of the sovereign state, which began in practice after\nWorld War II and has since continued through European integration and\nthe growth and strengthening of laws and practices to protect human\nrights. The most prominent corresponding political thought occurs in\nthe writings of critics of sovereignty like Bertrand de Jouvenel and\nJacques Maritain.\n\nIn his classic, The King’s Two Bodies (1957),\nmedievalist Ernst Kantorowicz describes a profound transformation in\nthe concept of political authority over the course of the Middle Ages.\nThe change began when the concept of the body of Christ evolved into a\nnotion of two bodies — one, the corpus naturale, the\nconsecrated host on the altar, the other, the corpus\nmysticum, the social body of the church with its attendant\nadministrative structure. This latter notion — of a collective\nsocial organization having an enduring, mystical essence — would\ncome to be transferred to political entities, the body politic.\nKantorowicz then describes the emergence, in the late Middle Ages, of\nthe concept of the king’s two bodies, vivified in\nShakespeare’s Richard II and applicable to the early modern body\npolitic. Whereas the king’s natural, mortal body would pass away\nwith his death, he was also thought to have an enduring, supernatural\none that could not be destroyed, even by assassination, for it\nrepresented the mystical dignity and justice of the body politic. The\nmodern polity that emerged dominant in early modern Europe manifested\nthe qualities of the collectivity that Kantorowicz described — a\nsingle, unified one, confined within territorial borders, possessing a\nsingle set of interests, ruled by an authority that was bundled into a\nsingle entity and held supremacy in advancing the interests of the\npolity. Though in early modern times, kings would hold this authority,\nlater practitioners of it would include the people ruling through a\nconstitution, nations, the Communist Party, dictators, juntas, and\ntheocracies. The modern polity is known as the state, and the\nfundamental characteristic of authority within it, sovereignty. \nThe evolution that Kantorowicz described is formative, for sovereignty\nis a signature feature of modern politics. Some scholars have doubted\nwhether a stable, essential notion of sovereignty exists. But there is\nin fact a definition that captures what sovereignty came to mean in\nearly modern Europe and of which most subsequent definitions are a\nvariant: supreme authority within a territory. This is the\nquality that early modern states possessed, but which popes, emperors,\nkings, bishops, and most nobles and vassals during the Middle Ages\nlacked. \nEach component of this definition highlights an important aspect of\nthe concept. First, a holder of sovereignty possesses authority. That\nis to say, the person or entity does not merely wield coercive power,\ndefined as A’s ability to cause B to do what\nhe would otherwise not do. Authority is rather what philosopher R.P.\nWolff proposed: “the right to command and correlatively the\nright to be obeyed” (Wolff, 1990, 20). What is most important\nhere is the term “right,” connoting legitimacy. A holder\nof sovereignty derives authority from some mutually acknowledged\nsource of legitimacy — natural law, a divine mandate, hereditary\nlaw, a constitution, even international law. In the contemporary era,\nsome body of law is ubiquitously the source of sovereignty. \nBut if sovereignty is a matter of authority, it is not a matter of\nmere authority, but of supreme authority. Supremacy is what makes the\nconstitution of the United States superior to the government of\nPennsylvania, or any holder of sovereignty different from a police\nchief or corporate executive. The holder of sovereignty is superior to\nall authorities under its purview. Supremacy, too, is endemic to\nmodernity. During the Middle Ages, manifold authorities held some sort\nof legal warrant for their authority, whether feudal, canonical, or\notherwise, but very rarely did such warrant confer supremacy. \nA final ingredient of sovereignty is territoriality, also a feature of\npolitical authority in modernity. Territoriality is a principle by\nwhich members of a community are to be defined. It specifies that\ntheir membership derives from their residence within borders. It is a\npowerful principle, for it defines membership in a way that may not\ncorrespond with identity. The borders of a sovereign state may not at\nall circumscribe a “people” or a “nation,” and\nmay in fact encompass several of these identities, as national\nself-determination and irredentist movements make evident. It is\nrather by simple virtue of their location within geographic borders\nthat people belong to a state and fall under the authority of its\nruler. It is within a geographic territory that modern sovereigns are\nsupremely authoritative. \nTerritoriality is now deeply taken for granted. It is a feature of\nauthority all across the globe. Even supranational and international\ninstitutions like the European Union and the United Nations are\ncomposed of states whose membership is in turn defined territorially.\nThis universality of form is distinctive of modernity and underlines\nsovereignty’s connection with modernity. Though territoriality\nhas existed in different eras and locales, other principles of\nmembership like family kinship, religion, tribe, and feudal ties have\nalso held great prestige. Most vividly contrasting with territoriality\nis a wandering tribe, whose authority structure is completely\ndisassociated with a particular piece of land. Territoriality\nspecifies by what quality citizens are subject to authority —\ntheir geographic location within a set of boundaries. International\nrelations theorists have indeed pointed out the similarity between\nsovereignty and another institution in which lines demarcate land\n— private property. Indeed, the two prominently rose together in\nthe thought of Thomas Hobbes. \nSupreme authority within a territory — this is the general\ndefinition of sovereignty. Historical manifestations of sovereignty\nare almost always specific instances of this general definition. It is\nin fact the instances of which philosophers and the politically\nmotivated have spoken most often, making their claim for the\nsovereignty of this person or that body of law. Understanding\nsovereignty, then, involves understanding claims to it, or at least\nsome of the most important of these claims. \nOver the past half millennium, these claims have taken extraordinarily\ndiverse forms — nations asserting independence from mother\nstates, communists seeking freedom from colonialists, the vox\npopuli contending with ancien regimes, theocracies who\nreject the authority of secular states, and sundry others. It is\nindeed a mark of the resilience and flexibility of the sovereign state\nthat it has accommodated such diverse sorts of authority. Though a\ncatalog of these authorities is not possible here, three dimensions\nalong which they may be understood will help to categorize them: the\nholders of sovereignty, the absolute or non-absolute nature of\nsovereignty, and the relationship between the internal and external\ndimensions of sovereignty. \nAs suggested, diverse authorities have held sovereignty — kings,\ndictators, peoples ruling through constitutions, and the like. The\ncharacter of the holder of supreme authority within a territory is\nprobably the most important dimension of sovereignty. In early modern\ntimes, French theorist Jean Bodin thought that sovereignty must reside\nin a single individual. Both he and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes\nconceived the sovereign as being above the law. Later thinkers\ndiffered, coming to envision new loci for sovereignty, but remaining\ncommitted to the principle. \nSovereignty can also be absolute or non-absolute. How is it possible\nthat sovereignty might be non-absolute if it is also supreme? After\nall, scholars like Alan James argue that sovereignty can only be\neither present or absent, and cannot exist partially (James 1999,\n462–4). But here, absoluteness refers not to the extent or\ncharacter of sovereignty, which must always be supreme, but rather to\nthe scope of matters over which a holder of authority is sovereign.\nBodin and Hobbes envisioned sovereignty as absolute, extending to all\nmatters within the territory, unconditionally. It is possible for an\nauthority to be sovereign over some matters within a territory, but\nnot all. Today, many European Union (EU) member states exhibit\nnon-absoluteness. They are sovereign in governing defense, but not in\ngoverning their currencies, trade policies, and many social welfare\npolicies, which they administer in cooperation with EU authorities as\nset forth in EU law. Absolute sovereignty is quintessential modern\nsovereignty. But in recent decades, it has begun to be circumscribed\nby institutions like the EU, the UN’s practices of sanctioning\nintervention, and the international criminal court. \nA final pair of adjectives that define sovereignty is\n“internal” and “external.” In this case, the\nwords do not describe exclusive sorts of sovereignty, but different\naspects of sovereignty that are coexistent and omnipresent. Sovereign\nauthority is exercised within borders, but also, by definition, with\nrespect to outsiders, who may not interfere with the sovereign’s\ngovernance. The state has been the chief holder of external\nsovereignty since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, after which\ninterference in other states’ governing prerogatives became\nillegitimate. The concept of sovereignty in international law most\noften connotes external sovereignty. Alan James similarly conceives of\nexternal sovereignty as constitutional independence — a\nstate’s freedom from outside influence upon its basic\nprerogatives (James 1999, 460–462). Significantly, external\nsovereignty depends on recognition by outsiders. To states, this\nrecognition is what a no-trespassing law is to private property\n— a set of mutual understandings that give property, or the\nstate, immunity from outside interference. It is also external\nsovereignty that establishes the basic condition of international\nrelations — anarchy, meaning the lack of a higher authority that\nmakes claims on lower authorities. An assemblage of states, both\ninternally and externally sovereign, makes up an international system,\nwhere sovereign entities ally, trade, make war, and make peace. \nSupreme authority with a territory — within this definition,\nsovereignty can then be understood more precisely only through its\nhistory. This history can be told as one of two broad movements\n— the first, a centuries long evolution towards a European\ncontinent, then a globe, of sovereign states, the second, a\ncircumscription of absolute sovereign prerogatives in the second half\nof the twentieth century. \nIt was at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that Europe consolidated its\nlong transition from the Middle Ages to a world of sovereign states.\nAccording to historian J.R. Strayer, Britain and France looked a lot\nlike sovereign states by around 1300, their kings possessing supremacy\nwithin bounded territories. But as late as the beginning of the\nReformation in 1517, Europe remained distant from Westphalia. It was\njust around then that a great reversal in historical momentum occurred\nwhen Charles V of Spain ascended to the throne, uniting Castile,\nAragon and the Netherlands, at the same time becoming Holy Roman\nEmperor, gaining prerogatives over lands in Central Europe, while\ntaking on the role of enforcer of the Catholic Church’s still\nsignificant temporal prerogatives inside the Empire, especially its\nenforcement of ecclesiastical orthodoxy. But within the Empire,\nCharles V was not sovereign, either, for princes and nobles there\nretained prerogatives over which he exercised no control. In 1555, a\nsystem of sovereign states gained important ground in the Peace of\nAugsburg, whose formula cuius regio, eius religio, allowed\nGerman princes to enforce their own faith within their territory. But\nAugsburg was unstable. Manifold contests over the settlement’s\nprovisions resulted in constant wars, culminating finally in the\nThirty Years War, which did not end until 1648, at the Peace of\nWestphalia. \nWhat features of Westphalia make it the origin of the sovereign states\nsystem? In fact, not all scholars agree that it deserves this status\n(see Krasner 1999). Nowhere in the settlement’s treaties is a\nsovereign states system or even the state as the reigning legitimate\nunit, prescribed. Certainly, Westphalia did not create a sovereign\nstates system ex nihilo, for components of the system had\nbeen accumulating for centuries up to the settlement; afterwards, some\nmedieval anomalies persisted. In two broad respects, though, in both\nlegal prerogatives and practical powers, the system of sovereign\nstates triumphed. First, states emerged as virtually the sole form of\nsubstantive constitutional authority in Europe, their authority no\nlonger seriously challenged by the Holy Roman Empire. The Netherlands\nand Switzerland gained uncontested sovereignty, the German states of\nthe Holy Roman Empire accrued the right to ally outside the empire,\nwhile both the diplomatic communications and foreign policy designs of\ncontemporary great powers revealed a common understanding of a system\nof sovereign states. The temporal powers of the Church were also\ncurtailed to the point that they no longer challenged any\nstate’s sovereignty. In reaction, Pope Innocent X condemned the\ntreaties of the peace as “null, void, invalid, iniquitous,\nunjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for\nall time” (quoted in Maland 1966, 16). \nSecond, Westphalia brought an end to a long era of intervention in\nmatters of religion, up to then the most commonly practiced abridgment\nof sovereign prerogatives. After decades of armed contestation, the\ndesign of the Peace of Augsburg was finally consolidated, not in the\nexact form of 1555, but effectively establishing the authority of\nprinces and kings over religion. Although intervention in matters of\nreligion did not come to an absolute end, it became exceedingly rare,\nthis in stark contrast to the previous 130 years, when wars of\nreligion sundered Europe. As the sovereign states system became more\ngeneralized in ensuing decades, this proscription of intervention\nwould become more generalized, too, evolving into a foundational norm\nof the international system. \nAgain, not all scholars agree that Westphalia deserves its\n‘founding moment’ status. Daniel Philpott has argued for\nthe orthodoxy in (Philpott, 2001). In recent years, though a number of\nscholars have come to argue that the Westphalia myth ought to be\ndeconstructed and discarded (Krasner, 1999; Carvalho, Leira, and\nHobson, 2011; Nexon, 2009; Osiander, 1994; Osiander, 2001; Teschke,\n2009). Generally, these scholars stress that important elements of\nstatehood were around long before Westphalia and that important\nelements of ‘hierarchy’, or circumscription of sovereignty\nfrom above, perdured long after Westphalia. Only the long-term\nconsensus of scholars can determine how Westphalia will continue to be\nregarded. \nWhether the sovereign states system was consolidated at Westphalia,\ntook full shape at a later time, or always remained heterodox, its\nbasic form nevertheless spread worldwide over the next three\ncenturies, culminating in the decline of the European colonial empires\nin the mid-20th century, when the state became the only\nform of polity ever to cover the entire land surface of the globe.\nToday, norms of sovereignty are enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations, whose article 2(4) prohibits attacks on “political\nindependence and territorial integrity,” and whose Article 2(7)\nsharply restricts intervention. \nWhile the section that follows this one will detail the\ncircumscription of sovereignty following World War II, this broad\nhistorical trend should not obscure respects in which sovereignty has\npersisted and even resurged in recent years. In an important article,\ninternational relations scholar Roland Paris (2020) makes the case\nthat global politics is seeing the reemergence of pre-Westphalian\nnotions of sovereignty, including “extralegal” and\n“organic” versions, which contrast with Westphalian\nsovereignty and its norms of the legal equality of state and\nnon-interference in domestic affairs. Paris documents this reemergence\nin Russia under President Vladimir Putin, China under President Xi\nJinping, and the United States under President Donald Trump.  \nAs the sovereign state was occupying the European continent, piece by\npiece, in early modern times, eventually forming the system that came\nto occupy the globe, contemporary political philosophers embraced this\nform of polity and described what made it legitimate. They were not\noriginators of the concept, for even during medieval times,\nphilosophers like Dante and Marsilius of Padua advocated a separation\nof temporal and religious powers that would be achieved through a\ntransfer of prerogatives into temporal ruler’s hands. Then, in\nearly modern times, there were two roughly contemporary philosophers\nwho did not write explicitly or consciously of sovereignty, yet whose\nideas amounted in substance to important developments of the concept.\nMachiavelli observed the politics of city states in his Renaissance\nItaly and described what a prince had to do to promote a flourishing\nrepublic in terms that conferred on him supreme authority within his\nterritory. Manifestly, he was not to be bound by natural law, canon\nlaw, Gospel precepts, or any of the norms or authorities that\nobligated members of Christendom. Rather, he would have to be prepared\n“not to be good,” and to be ready to perform evil, not\nbecause evil was no longer evil, but because it was sometimes\nnecessary to further an end that was central for Machiavelli, an end\nthat amounts to the unifying idea of his thought: the strength and\nwell-ordering of the state. The obligation of the prince was\nraison d’état. He was supreme within the\nstate’s territory and responsible for the well being of this\nsingular, unitary body. \nPurveying sovereignty from quite a different perspective was Martin\nLuther. His theology of the Reformation advocated stripping the\nCatholic Church of its many powers, not only its ecclesiastical\npowers, but powers that are, by any modern definition, temporal.\nLuther held that the Church should no longer be thought of as a\nvisible, hierarchical institution, but was rather the invisibly united\naggregate of local churches that adhered to right doctrine. Thus, the\nCatholic Church no longer legitimately held vast tracts of land that\nit taxed and defended, and whose justice it administered; it was no\nlonger legitimate for its bishops to hold temporal offices under\nprinces and kings; nor would the Pope be able to depose secular rulers\nthrough his power of excommunication; most importantly, the Holy Roman\nEmperor would no longer legitimately enforce Catholic uniformity. No\nlonger would the Church and those who acted in its name exercise\npolitical or economic authority. Who, then, would take up such\nrelinquished powers? Territorial princes. “By the destruction of\nthe independence of the Church and its hold on an extra-territorial\npublic opinion, the last obstacle to unity within the State was\nremoved,” writes political philosopher J.N. Figgis (72). It was\nthis vision that triumphed at Westphalia. \nLuther’s political theology explained all of this. He taught\nthat under God’s authority, two orders with two forms of\ngovernment existed. “The realm of the spirit” was the\norder in which Christ was related to the soul of the believer. The\nrealm of the world was the order of secular society, where civil\nauthorities ran governmental institutions through law and coercion.\nBoth realms furthered the good of believers, but in different senses;\nthey were to be separately organized. Leaders of the church would\nperform spiritual duties; princes, kings and magistrates would perform\ntemporal ones. Freed from the power of the pope and the Catholic\nChurch, having appropriated temporal powers within their realm,\nprinces were now effectively sovereign. In that era, princes even\nexercised considerable control over Protestant churches, often\nappointing their regional leaders, as described by the doctrine of\n“Erastianism.” Though neither Luther nor other Protestant\nreformers discussed the doctrine of sovereignty in any detail, they\nprescribed for princes all of its substance. Again, Figgis: \nOther early modern philosophers, of course, espoused the doctrine of\nsovereignty explicitly, and are thus more familiarly associated with\nit. French philosopher Jean Bodin was the first European philosopher\nto treat the concept extensively. His concept of\nsouveraineté featured as a central concept in his\nwork, De la république, which he wrote in 1576, during\na time when France was sundered by civil war between Calvinist\nHuguenots and the Catholic monarchy. He viewed the problem of order as\ncentral and did not think that it could be solved through outdated\nmedieval notions of a segmented society, but only through a concept in\nwhich rulers and ruled were integrated into a single, unitary body\npolitic that was above any other human law, and was in fact the source\nof human law. This concept was sovereignty. Only a supreme authority\nwithin a territory could strengthen a fractured community. \nTo be sure, Bodin thought that the body that exercised sovereignty was\nbound by natural and divine law, though no human law could judge or\nappeal to it. More curiously, he also thought that sovereignty rightly\nexercised would respect customary and property rights. It is not clear\nhow such a restraint was to be reconciled with the supreme status of\nsovereign authority. Possibly, Bodin thought that such rights were to\nbe features of a legal regime which was itself sovereign with respect\nto other authorities. Indeed, he also thought the form of government\nthat exercised sovereign powers could legitimately vary among\nmonarchy, aristocracy and democracy, though he preferred monarchy.\nWhatever the sovereign body looked like, though, it was not subject to\nany external human law or authority within its territory. F.H. Hinsley\nwrites: \nAt a time when it had become imperative that the conflict between\nrulers and ruled should be terminated, [Bodin] realized — and it\nwas an impressive intellectual feat — that the conflict would be\nsolved only if it was possible both to establish the existence of a\nnecessarily unrestricted ruling power and to distinguish this power\nfrom an absolutism that was free to disregard all laws and\nregulations. He did this by founding both the legality of this power\nand the wisdom of observing the limitations which hedged its proper\nuse upon the nature of the body politic as a political society\ncomprising both ruler and ruled — and his statement of\nsovereignty was the necessary, only possible, result\n(124–125). \nBodin’s “statement of sovereignty” is the first\nsystematic one in modern European philosophy, and thus deserves a\nlandmark status. \nThe English philosopher Thomas Hobbes also wrote during a time of\ncivil war and also arrived at the notion of sovereignty as a solution.\nFor Hobbes, the people established sovereign authority through a\ncontract in which they transferred all of their rights to the\nLeviathan, which represented the abstract notion of the state. The\nwill of the Leviathan reigned supreme and represented the will of all\nthose who had alienated their rights to it. Like Bodin’s\nsovereign, Hobbes’ Leviathan was above the law, a mortal god\nunbound by any constitution or contractual obligations with any\nexternal party. Like Bodin, Hobbes also thought the sovereign to be\naccountable to God and most likely to the natural law in some form.\nOtherwise, though, law was the command of the sovereign ruler,\nemanating from his will, and the obligation to obey it absolute. \nBoth Bodin and Hobbes argued for sovereignty as supreme authority. The\nconcept continues to prevail as the presumption of political rule in\nstates throughout the globe today, including ones where the sovereign\nbody of law institutes limited government and civil rights for\nindividuals. Over the centuries, new notions of the holders of\nsovereignty have evolved. Rousseau, far different from Bodin or\nHobbes, saw the collective people within a state as the sovereign,\nruling through their general will. In constitutional government, it is\nthe people ruling through a body of law that is sovereign. That is the\nversion that commands legitimacy most commonly in the world today. \nYet versions of sovereignty evocative of Hobbes’ and\nBodin’s have carried forth into the twentieth century.\nExplicitly invoking both of these philosophers was the early twentieth\ncentury German philosopher and jurist Carl Schmitt, for instance. His\nbook of 1922 opens with the line, “Sovereign is he who decides\non the exception” (trans. G. Schwab, 1985). Schmitt thought that\nthe sovereign was above any constitutional law and ought to be able to\n“make a decision” on behalf of the good of the state\nduring a time of emergency. He had little respect for liberal\nconstitutionalism, which he thought wholly inadequate to contain the\npower struggle that politics involves. By and large, there is little\nindicating that, at least in this work, Schmitt thought the sovereign\nto be bound by divine law or natural law. The liberal\nconstitutionalism of Weimar Germany was his chief piece of evidence\nfor this conviction; during the 1930s he fervently supported the\nNational Socialist regime, one whose emergency powers were just those\nthat he thought necessary. \nThe rise and global expansion of sovereignty, described and even\nlauded by political philosophers, amounts to one of the most\nformidable and successful political trends in modern times. But from\nits earliest days, sovereignty has also met with both doubters and\nqualified supporters, many of whom have regarded any body of\nlaw’s claim to sovereign status as a form of idolatry, sometimes\nas a carapace behind which rulers carry out cruelties and injustices\nfree from legitimate outside scrutiny. It was indeed after the\nHolocaust that meaningful legal and institutional circumscriptions of\nsovereignty in fact arose, many of which have come to abridge the\nrights of sovereign states quite significantly. The two most prominent\ncurtailments are conventions on human rights and European\nintegration. \nIt was in 1948 that the vast majority of states signed the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, committing themselves to respect over 30\nseparate rights for individuals. As it was not a legally binding\ndeclaration and contained no enforcement provisions, the declaration\nleft states’ sovereignty intact, but it was a first step towards\ntethering them to international, universal obligations regarding their\ninternal affairs. Over decades, these human rights would come to enjoy\never stronger legal status. One of the most robust human rights\nconventions, one that indeed curtails sovereignty, even if mildly,\nthrough its arbitration mechanisms, is the European Convention for the\nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, formed in 1950.\nRoughly contemporaneous, signed on December 9, 1948, was the Genocide\nConvention, committing signing states to refrain from and punish\ngenocide. Then, in the mid-1960’s, two covenants — the\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic,\nSocial and Cultural Rights — legally bound most of the\nworld’s states to respecting the human rights of their people.\nAgain, the signatories’ constitutional authority remained\nlargely intact, since they would not allow any of these commitments to\ninfringe upon their sovereignty. Subsequent human rights covenants,\nalso signed by the vast majority of the world’s states,\ncontained similar reservations. \nOnly a practice of human rights backed up by military enforcement or\nrobust judicial procedures would circumscribe sovereignty in a serious\nway. Progress in this direction began to occur after the Cold War\nthrough a historic revision of the Peace of Westphalia, one that\ncurtails a norm strongly advanced by its treaties —\nnon-intervention. In a series of several episodes beginning in 1990,\nthe United Nations or another international organization has endorsed\na political action, usually involving military force, that the broad\nconsensus of states would have previously regarded as illegitimate\ninterference in internal affairs. The episodes have involved the\napproval of military operations to remedy an injustice within the\nboundaries of a state or the outside administration of domestic\nmatters like police operations. Unlike peacekeeping operations during\nthe Cold War, the operations have usually lacked the consent of the\ngovernment of the target state. They have occurred in Iraq, the former\nYugoslavia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Cambodia, Liberia,\nLibya and elsewhere. Although the legitimacy and wisdom of individual\ninterventions is often contested among states — the U.S. bombing\nof Iraq in December 1999 and NATO’s intervention in Kosovo, for\ninstance, failed to elicit U.N. Security Council endorsement, as did\nthe U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 — the broad practice of\nintervention is likely to continue to enjoy broad endorsement within\nthe U.N. Security Council and other international organizations. \nAn explicit call to revise the concept of sovereignty so as to allow\nfor internationally sanctioned intervention arose with The\nResponsibility to Protect, a document written and produced in 2001 by\nthe International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, a\ncommission that the Government of Canada convened at the behest of\nU.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. The document proposes a strong\nrevision of the classical conception by which sovereignty involves a\n“responsibility to protect” on the part of a state towards\nits own citizens, a responsibility that outsiders may assume when a\nstate perpetrates massive injustice or cannot protect its own\ncitizens. Responsibility to Protect has garnered wide international\nattention and serves as a manifesto for a concept of sovereignty that\nis non-absolute and conditional upon outside obligations. \nThe other way in which sovereignty is being circumscribed is through\nEuropean integration. This idea also arose in reaction to the\nHolocaust, a calamity that many European leaders attributed at least\nin part to the sovereign state’s lack of accountability.\nHistorically, the most enthusiastic supporters of European integration\nhave indeed come from Catholic Christian Democratic parties, whose\nideals are rooted in medieval Christendom, where at least in theory,\nno leader was sovereign and all leaders were accountable to a\nuniversal set of values. In the modern language of human rights and\ndemocracy, they echo Pope Innocent X’s excoriation of the Peace\nof Westphalia. \nEuropean integration began in 1950, when six states formed the\nEuropean Coal and Steel Community in the Treaty of Paris. The\ncommunity established joint international authority over the coal and\nsteel industries of these six countries, entailing executive control\nthrough a permanent bureaucracy and a decision-making Council of\nMinisters composed of foreign ministers of each state. This same model\nwas expanded to a general economic zone in the Treaty of Rome in 1957.\nIt was enhanced by a judicial body, the European Court of Justice, and\na legislature, the European Parliament, a directly elected Europe-wide\nbody. Over time, European integration has widened, as the institution\nnow consists of twenty-seven members, and deepened, as it did in the\n1991 Maastricht Treaty, which expanded the institution’s powers\nand reconfigured it as the European Union. Far from a replacement for\nstates, the European Union rather “pools” important\naspects of their sovereignty into a “supranational”\ninstitution in which their freedom of action is constrained (Keohane\n& Hoffman 1991). They are no longer absolutely sovereign. In\nrecent years, European integration has continued to advance in\nimportant respects. On December 1, 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon came\ninto full force, pooling sovereignty further by strengthening the\nCouncil of Ministers and the European Parliament, creating a High\nRepresentative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to\nrepresent a unified European Union position, and making the European\nUnion’s Charter of Fundamental Human Rights legally binding.\nHowever, strains on European integration have emerged in recent years\nas well. A treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed by\nthe European Union’s member states in 2004, but referendums in\nFrance and the Netherlands in 2005 rejected it and prevented its\nratification. Then, in 2016, a referendum in the United Kingdom\nresulted in a victory for the U.K.’s withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union, popularly known as “Brexit.”  \nThis circumscription of the sovereign state, through international\nnorms and supranational institutions, finds a parallel in contemporary\nphilosophers who attack the notion of absolute sovereignty. Their\nthought is not entirely new, for even in early modern times,\nphilosophers like Hugo Grotius, Alberico Gentili, and Francisco\nSuarez, though they accepted the state as a legitimate institution,\nthought that its authority ought to be limited, not absolute. The\ncruel prince, for instance, could be subject to a disciplining action\nfrom neighboring princes that is much like contemporary notions of\nhumanitarian intervention. \nTwo of the most prominent attacks on sovereignty by political\nphilosophers since World War II came in the 1950s from Bertrand de\nJouvenel and Jacques Maritain. In his prominent work of 1957,\nSovereignty: An Inquiry Into the Political Good, Jouvenel\nacknowledges that sovereignty is an important attribute of modern\npolitical authority, needed to quell disputes within the state and to\nmuster cooperation in defense against outsiders. But he roundly\ndecries the modern concept of sovereignty, which creates a power who\nis above the rules, a power whose decrees are to be considered\nlegitimate simply because they emanate from his will. To Jouvenel,\nsovereignty reached its peak in Hobbes, in whose “horrific\nconception everything comes back to means of constraint, which enable\nthe sovereign to issue rights and dictate laws in any way he pleases.\nBut these means of constraint are themselves but a fraction of the\nsocial forces concentrated in the hand of the sovereign” (197).\nDespite their differences over the locus and form of sovereignty,\nsubsequent thinkers like Locke, Pufendorf, and Rousseau “were to\nfeel the lure of this mechanically perfect construction” (198).\nThis was “the hour of sovereignty in itself,”\nwrites Jouvenel, the existence of which “hardly anyone would\nthenceforward have the hardihood to deny” (198). \nAs his description of Hobbes intimates, Jouvenel views early modern\nabsolute sovereignty with great alarm. “[I]t is the idea itself\nwhich is dangerous,” he writes (198). But rather than calling\nfor the concept to be abrogated, he holds that sovereignty must be\nchanneled so that sovereign authority wills nothing but what is\nlegitimate. Far from being defined by the sovereign, morality has an\nindependent validity. Appealing to the perspective of “Christian\nthinkers,” he argues that “there are . . . wills which are\njust and wills which are unjust” (201). “Authority,”\nthen, “carries with it the obligation to command the thing that\nshould be commanded” (201). This was the understanding of\nauthority held by the ancien regime, where effective advisers to the\nmonarch could channel his efforts towards the common good. What can\nchannel the sovereign will today? Jouvenel seems to doubt that\njudicial or constitutional design is alone enough. Rather, he places\nhis hope in the shared moral concepts of the citizenry, which act as a\nconstraint upon the choices of the sovereign. \nIn Chapter Two of his enduring work of 1951, Man and the\nState, Jacques Maritain shows little sympathy for sovereignty at\nall, not even the qualified sympathy of Jouvenel: \nIt is my contention that political philosophy must get rid of the\nword, as well as the concept, of Sovereignty:-not because it is an\nantiquated concept, or by virtue of a sociological-juridical theory of\n“objective law”; and not only because the concept of\nSovereignty creates insuperable difficulties and theoretical\nentanglements in the field of international law; but because,\nconsidered in its genuine meaning, and in the perspective of the\nproper scientific realm to which it belongs — political\nphilosophy — this concept is intrinsically wrong and bound to\nmislead us if we keep on using it — assuming that it has been\ntoo long and too largely accepted to be permissibly rejected, and\nunaware of the false connotations that are inherent in it\n(29–30). \nBodin’s and Hobbes’ mistake was in conceiving of\nsovereignty as authority that the people permanently transferred and\nalienated to an external entity, here the monarch. Rather than\nrepresenting the people and being accountable to it, the sovereign\nbecame a transcendent entity, holding the supreme and inalienable\nright to rule over the people, independently of them, rather than\nrepresenting the people, accountable to them. Like Jouvenel, Maritain\nrues the exaltation of the sovereign’s will such that what is\njust is what serves his interest. This is idolatry. Any transfer of\nthe authority of the body politic either to some part of itself or to\nsome outside entity — the apparatus of the state, a monarch, or\neven the people — is illegitimate, for the validity of a\ngovernment is rooted in its relationship to natural law. Sovereignty\ngives rise to three dysfunctionalities. First, its external dimension\nrenders inconceivable international law and a world state, to both of\nwhich Maritain is highly sympathetic. Second, the internal dimension\nof sovereignty, the absolute power of the state over the body politic,\nresults in centralism, not pluralism. Third, the supreme power of the\nsovereign state is contrary to the democratic notion of\naccountability. \nAs a Catholic philosopher, Maritain’s arguments run similar to\nChristian philosophers of early modern Europe who criticized absolute\nsovereignty. Witnessing the rise of the formidable entity of the\nstate, they sought to place limits on its power and authority. They\nare the ancestors of those who now demand limits on the state’s\nauthority in the name of human rights, of the right to quell genocide\nand disaster and deliver relief from the outside, of an international\ncriminal court, and of a supranational entity that assumes power of\ngovernance over economic, and now, maybe, military affairs. \nThe case for circumscribing sovereignty remains strong in the Catholic\nand other Christian traditions. Pope Benedict XVI made a case for the\nResponsibility to Protect, for instance, in his 2008 speech to the\nUnited Nations. In recent years, political philosophers in the liberal\ntradition have argued for the circumscription of sovereignty as well.\nTwo examples are Thomas Pogge (1992, and 2008, 174–201) and\nAllen Buchanan (2004). Both accord sovereignty an important but not an\nabsolute moral status, seeking to make room for possibilities such as\nhumanitarian intervention approved by the United Nations and the more\nrobust development of global institutions for fighting poverty.","contact.mail":"Philpott.1@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
