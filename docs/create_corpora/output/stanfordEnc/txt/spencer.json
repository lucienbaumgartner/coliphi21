After all, Spencer, and not\nDarwin, coined the infamous expression “survival of the\nfittest”, leading G. E. Moore to conclude erroneously in\nPrincipia Ethica (1903) that Spencer committed the\nnaturalistic fallacy. According to Moore, Spencer’s practical\nreasoning was deeply flawed insofar as he purportedly conflated mere\nsurvivability (a natural property) with goodness itself (a non-natural\nproperty).\n\n\nRoughly fifty years later, Richard Hofstadter devoted an entire\nchapter of Social Darwinism in American Thought (1955) to\nSpencer, arguing that Spencer’s unfortunate vogue in late\nnineteenth-century America inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham\nSumner’s visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism. For\nHofstadter, Spencer was an “ultra-conservative” for whom\nthe poor were so much unfit detritus. His social philosophy\n“walked hand in hand” with reaction, making it little more\nthan a “biological apology for laissez-faire” (Hofstadter,\n1955: 41 and 46). But just because Carnegie interpreted\nSpencer’s social theory as justifying merciless economic\ncompetition, we shouldn’t automatically attribute such\njustificatory ambitions to Spencer. Otherwise, we risk uncritically\nreading the fact that Spencer happened to influence popularizers of\nsocial Darwinism into our interpretation of him. We risk falling\nvictim to what Skinner perceptively calls the “mythology of\nprolepsis.”\n\n\nSpencer’s reputation has never fully recovered from Moore and\nHofstadter’s interpretative caricatures, thus marginalizing him\nto the hinterlands of intellectual history, though recent scholarship\nhas begun restoring and repairing his legacy. Happily, in\nrehabilitating him, some moral philosophers have begun to appreciate\njust how fundamentally utilitarian his practical reasoning was. And\nsome sociologists have likewise begun reassessing Spencer.\n\n\nIntellectual history is forever being rewritten as we necessarily\nreinterpret its canonical texts and occasionally renominate\nmarginalized thinkers for canonical consideration. Changing\nphilosophical fashions and ideological agendas invariably doom us to\nreconstructing incessantly our intellectual heritage regardless the\ndiscipline. Take political theory instance. Isaiah Berlin’s\nunderstandable preoccupation with totalitarianism induced him to read\nT. H. Green and Bernard Bosanquet as its unwitting accomplices insofar\nas both purportedly equated freedom with dangerously enriched,\nneo-Hegelian fancies about self-realization. Regrettably, this\nideological reconstruction of new liberals like Green and Bosanquet\ncontinues largely unabated (see Skinner, 2002: 16). But as our\nideological sensitivities shift, we can now begin rereading them with\nchanged prejudice, if not less prejudice. And the same goes for how we\ncan now reread other marginalized, nineteenth-century English liberals\nlike Spencer. As the shadow of European totalitarianism wanes, the\nlens through which we do intellectual history changes and we can more\neasily read our Spencer as he intended to be read, namely as a\nutilitarian who wanted to be a liberal just as much.\n\n\nLike J. S. Mill, Spencer struggled to make utilitarianism\nauthentically liberal by infusing it with a demanding principle of\nliberty and robust moral rights. He was convinced, like Mill, that\nutilitarianism could accommodate rights with independent moral force\nand yet remain genuinely consequentialist. Subtly construed,\nutilitarianism can effectively mimick the very best deontological\nliberalism.\n\nSpencer’s output was vast, covering several other disciplines\nbesides philosophy and making it difficult to make sense of his\nphilosophizing separate from his non-philosophical writing. And there\nis so much Spencer to make sense of, namely many thousand printed\n pages.[1]\n Besides ethics and political philosophy, Spencer wrote at length\nabout psychology, biology and, especially, about sociology. Certain\nthemes, not unexpectedly, run through much of this material. Coming to\nterms with Spencer and measuring his legacy requires expertise in all\nof these fields, which no one today has. Notwithstanding this caveat,\nit seems fair to say that next to ethics and political philosophy,\nSpencer’s lasting impact has been most pronounced in sociology.\nIn many revealing respects, the latter grounds and orients the former.\nHence, it seems best to discuss his sociology first before turning to\nhis moral and political theory. But taking up his sociological theory,\nin turn, requires addressing, however briefly, the elemental axioms\nundergirding his entire “Synthetic Philosophy,” which\nconsisted of The Principles of Biology (1864–7),\nThe Principles of Psychology (1855 and 1870–2), The\nPrinciples of Sociology (1876–96), and\nThe Principles of Ethics (1879–93). \nFirst Principles was issued in 1862 as an axiomatic\nprolegomena to the synthetic philosophy, which came to a close with\nthe publication of the 1896, final volume of The Principles of\nSociology. Though disguised as mid-19th century speculative\nphysics, First Principles is mostly metaphysics encompassing\nall inorganic change and organic evolution. The synthetic philosophy\npurports to illustrate in often maddening detail what follows from\nFirst Principles. \nAccording to Spencer in First Principles, three principles\nregulate the universe, namely the Law of the Persistence of Force, the\nLaw of the Instability of the Homogeneous and the Law of the\nMultiplicity of Effects. Though originally homogeneous, the universe\nis gradually becoming increasingly heterogeneous because Force or\nEnergy expands un-uniformly. Homogeneity is unstable because Force is\nunstable and variable. And because of the Law of the Multiplicity of\nEffects, heterogeneous consequences grow exponentially, forever\naccelerating the tempo of homogeneity evolving into heterogeneity.\nSpencer postulates, though not always consistently, that the universe\nwill eventually equilibrate, eventually dissolving towards\nhomogeneity. \nUsing some of Spencer’s other terminology, the universe is\nrelentlessly becoming more complex, forever subdividing into\nmultifarious aggregates. As these aggregates become increasingly\ndifferentiated, their components become increasingly dissimilar\nspeeding up the entire process and making the universe heterogeneous\nwithout end until equilibrium occurs. Or more parsimoniously:\n“Evolution is definable as a change from an incoherent\nhomogeneity to a coherent heterogeneity, accompanying the dissipation\nof motion and integration of matter.” (Spencer, 1915: 291). For\nSpencer, then, all organic as well as inorganic phenomena were\nevolving, becoming evermore integrated and heterogeneous. As Spencer\nwas to emphasize years later, this holds human social evolution no\nless: \nIn sum, societies were not only becoming increasingly complex,\nheterogeneous and cohesive. They were becoming additionally\ninterdependent and their components, including their human members,\nmore and more specialized and individuated. \nThe Principles of Sociology has often been considered seminal\nin the development of modern sociology both for its method and for\nmuch of its content. Replete with endless examples from the distant\npast, recent past and present, it speculatively describes and explains\nthe entire arch of human social\n evolution.[3]\n Part V, “Political Institutions,” is especially relevant\nfor understanding Spencer’s ethics. Together with his\nPrinciples of Ethics, “Political Institutions”\ncrowns the synthetic philosophy. They are its whole\n point.[4] \nOn Spencer’s account, social evolution unfolds through four\nuniversal stages. These are 1) “primitive” societies\ncharacterized by casual political cooperation, 2)\n“militant” societies characterized by rigid, hierarchical\npolitical control, 3) “industrial” societies where\ncentralized political hegemony collapses, giving way to minimally\nregulated markets and 4) spontaneously, self-regulating, market\nutopias in which government withers away. Overpopulation causing\nviolent conflicts between social groups fuels this cycle of\nconsolidation and reversal to which no society is immune. \nMore precisely, as embryonic kinship groups grow more numerous, they\n“come to be everywhere in one another’s way,”\n(Spencer, vol. II, 1876–93: 37). The more these primal societies crowd\neach other, the more externally violent and militant they become.\nSuccess in war requires greater solidarity and politically\nconsolidated and enforced cohesion. Unremitting warfare fuses and\nformalizes political control, eradicating societies that fail to\nconsolidate sufficiently. Clans form into nations and tribal chiefs\nbecome kings. As militarily successful societies subdue and absorb\ntheir rivals, they tend to stabilize and to “compound” and\n“recompound,” stimulating the division of labor and\ncommerce. The division of labor and spread of contractual exchange\ntransform successful and established “militant” societies\ninto “negatively regulative industrial” societies prizing\nindividual freedom and basic rights where the state recedes to\nprotecting citizens against force and fraud at home and aggression\nfrom abroad. Other things being equal, a society in which life,\nliberty, and property, are secure, and all interests justly regarded,\nmust prosper more than one in which they are not; and, consequently,\namong competing industrial societies there must be gradual replacing\nof those in which personal rights are imperfectly maintained, by those\nin which they are perfectly maintained.” (Spencer, vol. II,\n1876–93: 608). And societies where rights are perfectly maintained\nwill in due course confederate together in an ever-expanding pacific\nequilibrium. As noted previously, equilibrium is always unstable,\nrisking dissolution and regression. Indeed by the end of his life,\nSpencer was far less sanguine about industrial societies avoiding\nwar.[5] \nNotwithstanding his increasing pessimism regarding liberal progress\nand international concord, the extent to which normative theorizing\ninforms Spencer’s sociological theorizing is palpable. Sociology\nand ethics intertwine. We shall shortly see just how utilitarian as\nwell as how individualistic both were. \nMany recent interpreters of Spencer, especially sociologists, have\ninsisted that his sociological theory and his ethics do not\nintertwine, that his sociology stands apart and that therefore we can\ndiscount his moral theory in our efforts to understand his legacy to\nsocial science. For instance, J. D. Y. Peel has argued that\nSpencer’s sociology is “logically independent of his\nethics.” Jonathan H. Turner concurs, claiming that\nSpencer’s ethics and other ideological shortcomings “get\nin the way of viewing Spencer as a theorist whose [sociological] ideas\nhave endured (if only by rediscovery).” For Turner, his\n“sociology is written so that these deficiencies can easily be\nignored.” Robert Carneiro and Robert Perrin cite and reiterate\nPeel’s assessment.[6] \n And more recently, Mark Francis\nimplies much the same, writing that Spencer’s theory of social\nchange “operated on a different level than his moral\ntheory.”.[7]\n But just because many\nyears later we can get something out of his sociology while ignoring\nhis ethics and, for that matter, anything else besides sociology that\nhe wrote, we would err in thinking that we have correctly interpreted\nSpencer let alone thinking that we have correctly interpreted even\njust his sociology. It is one thing to discover how a past thinker\nseems to presage our present thinking on this matter or that, and it\nis another thing entirely to try to interpret a past thinker as best\nwe can. \nNowhere does Spencer’s ethics and sociology entwine more\npalpably than in his Lamarckism, though how much Spencer borrowed from\nLamarck as opposed to Darwin is contested. However, Peter J. Bowler\nhas lately argued that both Spencer and Darwin believed that the\ninheritance of acquired characteristics and natural selection together\ndrove evolution. For Bowler, it is no less mistaken to view Spencer as\nowing everything to Lamarck as it is to see him as owing very little\nto Lamarck.[8]\nBowler’s assessment is supported by Spencer’s claims in\ntwo late essays from 1886 and 1893 entitled “The Factors of\nOrganic Evolution” and “The Inadequacy of ‘Natural\nSelection.’”[9]\n The earlier essay alleges that evolution\nby natural selection declines in significance compared to\nuse-inheritance as human mental and moral capacities develop. The\nlatter gradually replaces the former as the mechanism of evolutionary\nchange. “Factors of Organic Evolution” succinctly weaves\ntogether use-inheritance, associationist psychology, moral\nintuitionism and utility. Actions producing pleasure or pain tend to\ncause mental associations between types of actions and pleasures or\npains. Sentiments of approval and disapproval also complement these\nassociations. We tend naturally to approve pleasure-producing actions\nand disapprove pain-producing ones. Because of use-inheritance, these\nfeelings of approval and disapproval intensify into deep-seated moral\ninstincts of approval and disapproval, which gradually become refined\nmoral intuitions. \nTo what extent Spencer’s sociology was functionalist has also\nbeen disputed. According to James G. Kennedy, Spencer created\n functionalism.[10]\n It would seem that\nregarding Spencer as a functionalist is another way of viewing him as,\nin contemporary normative terminology, a consequentialist. That is,\nsocial evolution favors social institutions and normative practices\nthat promote human solidarity, happiness and flourishing. \nSpencer’s reputation in sociology has faded. Social theorists remember\nhim though most probably remember little about him though this may be\nchanging somewhat. Moral philosophers, for their part, have mostly\nforgotten him even though 19th-century classical utilitarians like\nMill and Henry Sidgwick, Idealists like T. H. Green and J. S.\nMackenzie, and new liberals like D. G. Ritchie discussed him at\nconsiderable length though mostly critically. And 20th-century ideal\nutilitarians like Moore and Hastings Rashdall and Oxford intuitionists\nlike W. D. Ross also felt compelled to engage him. Spencer was very\nmuch part of their intellectual context. He oriented their thinking\nnot insignificantly. We cannot properly interpret them unless we take\nSpencer more seriously than we do. \nSpencer was a sociologist in part. But he was even more a moral\nphilosopher. He was what we now refer to as a liberal utilitarian\nfirst who traded heavily in evolutionary theory in order to explain\nhow our liberal utilitarian sense of justice emerges. \nThough a utilitarian, Spencer took distributive justice no less\nseriously than Mill. For him as for Mill, liberty and justice were\nequivalent. Whereas Mill equated fundamental justice with his liberty\nprinciple, Spencer equated justice with equal liberty, which holds\nthat the “liberty of each, limited by the like liberty of all,\nis the rule in conformity with which society must be organized”\n(Spencer, 1970: 79). Moreover, for Spencer as for Mill, liberty was\nsacrosanct, insuring that his utilitarianism was equally a bona fide\nform of liberalism. For both, respect for liberty also just happened\nto work out for the utilitarian best all things considered.\nIndefeasible liberty, properly formulated, and utility were therefore\nfully compossible. \nNow in Spencer’s case, especially by The Principles of\nEthics (1879–93), this compossibility rested on a complex\nevolutionary moral psychology combining associationism, Lamarckian\nuse-inheritance, intuitionism and utility. Pleasure-producing activity\nhas tended to generate biologically inheritable associations between\ncertain types of actions, pleasurable feelings and feelings of\napproval. Gradually, utilitarianism becomes\n intuitive.[11]\n And wherever utilitarian intuitions thrive, societies tend to be more\nvibrant as well as stable. Social evolution favors cultures that\ninternalize utilitarian maxims intuitively. Conduct “restrained\nwithin the required limits [stipulated by the principle of equal\nfreedom], calling out no antagonistic passions, favors harmonious\ncooperation, profits the group, and, by implications, profits the\naverage of individuals.” Consequently, “groups formed of\nmembers having this adaptation of nature” tend “to survive\nand spread” (Spencer, vol. II, 1978: 43). Wherever general\nutility thrives, societies thrive. General utility and cultural\nstamina go hand-in-hand. And general utility thrives best where\nindividuals exercise and develop their faculties within the parameters\nstipulated by equal freedom. \nIn short, like any moral intuition, equal freedom favors societies\nthat internalize it and, ultimately, self-consciously invoke it. And\nwherever societies celebrate equal freedom as an ultimate principle of\njustice, well-being flourishes and utilitarian liberalism spreads. \nSpencer likewise took moral rights seriously insofar as properly\ncelebrating equal freedom entailed recognizing and celebrating basic\nmoral rights as its “corollaries.” Moral rights specify\nequal freedom, making its normative requirements substantively\nclearer. They stipulate our most essential sources of happiness,\nnamely life and liberty. Moral rights to life and liberty are\nconditions of general happiness. They guarantee each individual the\nopportunity to exercise his or her faculties according to his or her\nown lights, which is the source of real happiness. Moral rights\ncan’t make us happy but merely give us the equal chance to make\nourselves happy as best we can. They consequently promote general\nhappiness indirectly. And since they are “corollaries” of\nequal freedom, they are no less indefeasible than the principle of\nequal freedom itself. \nBasic moral rights, then, emerge as intuitions too though they are\nmore specific than our generalized intuitive appreciation of the\nutilitarian prowess of equal freedom. Consequently, self-consciously\ninternalizing and refining our intuitive sense of equal freedom,\ntransforming it into a principle of practical reasoning,\nsimultaneously transforms our emerging normative intuitions about the\nsanctity of life and liberty into stringent juridical principles. And\nthis is simply another way of claiming that general utility flourishes\nbest wherever liberal principles are seriously invoked. Moral\nsocieties are happier societies and more vibrant and successful to\nboot. \nThough Spencer sometimes labels basic moral rights\n“natural” rights, we should not be misled, as some\nscholars have been, by this characterization. Spencer’s most\nsustained and systematic discussion of moral rights occurs in the\nconcluding chapter, “The Great Political Superstition,” of\nThe Man Versus the State (1884). There, he says that basic\nrights are natural in the sense that they valorize\n“customs” and “usages” that naturally arise as\na way of ameliorating social friction. Though conventional practices,\nonly very specific rights nevertheless effectively promote human\nwell-being. Only those societies that fortuitously embrace them\nflourish. \nRecent scholars have misinterpreted Spencer’s theory rights\nbecause, among other reasons, they have no doubt misunderstood\nSpencer’s motives for writing The Man Versus the State.\nThe essay is a highly polemical protest, in the name of strong rights\nas the best antidote, against the dangers of incremental legislative\nreforms introducing socialism surreptitiously into Britain. Its\nvitriolic, anti-socialist language surely accounts for much of its\nsometimes nasty social Darwinist rhetoric, which is unmatched in\nSpencer’s other writings notwithstanding scattered passages in\nThe Principles of Ethics and in The Principles of\nSociology\n (1876–96).[12] \nSpencer’s “liberal” utilitarian credentials are\ntherefore compelling as his 1863 exchange of letters with Mill further\ntestifies. Between the 1861 serial publication of\nUtilitarianism in Fraser’s Magazine and its\n1863 publication as a book, Spencer wrote Mill, protesting that Mill\nerroneously implied that he was anti-utilitarian in a footnote near\nthe end of the last chapter, “Of the Connection Between Justice\nand Utility.” Agreeing with Benthamism that happiness is the\n“ultimate” end, Spencer firmly disagrees that it should be\nour “proximate” end. He next adds: \nSpecific types of actions, in short, necessarily always promote\ngeneral utility best over the long term though not always in the\ninterim. While they may not always promote it proximately, they\ninvariably promote it ultimately or, in other words, indirectly. These\naction types constitute uncompromising, normative “laws of\nconduct.” As such, they specify the parameters of equal freedom.\nThat is, they constitute our fundamental moral rights. We have moral\nrights to these action types if we have moral rights to anything at\nall. \nSpencer as much as Mill, then, advocates indirect utilitarianism by\nfeaturing robust moral rights. For both theorists, rights-oriented\nutilitarianism best fosters general happiness because individuals\nsucceed in making themselves happiest when they develop their mental\nand physical faculties by exercising them as they deem most\nappropriate, which, in turn, requires extensive freedom. But since we\nlive socially, what we practically require is equal freedom suitably\nfleshed out in terms of its moral right corollaries. Moral rights to\nlife and liberty secure our most vital opportunities for making\nourselves as happy as we possibly can. So if Mill remains potently\ngermane because his legacy to contemporary liberal utilitarian still\ninspires, then we should take better account of Spencer than,\nunfortunately, we currently do. \nSpencer’s “liberal” utilitarianism, however, differs\nfrom Mill’s in several respects, including principally the\ngreater stringency that Spencer ascribed to moral rights. Indeed, Mill\nregarded this difference as the fundamental one between them. Mill\nresponded to Spencer’s letter professing allegiance to\nutilitarianism, observing that he concurs fully with Spencer that\nutilitarianism must incorporate the “widest and most general\nprinciples” that it possibly can. However, in contrast to\nSpencer, Mill protests that he “cannot admit that any of these\nprinciples are necessary, or that the practical conclusions which can\nbe drawn from them are even (absolutely) universal” (Duncan,\ned., 1908:\n 108).[14] \nSpencer referred to his own brand of utilitarianism as\n“rational” utilitarianism, which he claimed improved upon\nBentham’s inferior “empirical” utilitarianism. And\nthough he never labeled Mill a “rational” utilitarian,\npresumably he regarded him as one. \nOne should not underestimate what “rational”\nutilitarianism implied for Spencer metaethically. In identifying\nhimself as a “rational” utilitarian, Spencer distanced\nhimself decidedly from social Darwinism, showing why Moore’s\ninfamous judgment was misplaced. Responding to T. H. Huxley’s\naccusation that he conflated good with “survival of the\nfittest,” Spencer insisted that “fittest” and\n“best” were not equivalent. He agreed with Huxley that\nthough ethics can be evolutionarily explained, ethics nevertheless\npreempts normal struggle for existence with the arrival of humans.\nHumans invest evolution with an “ethical check,” making\nhuman evolution qualitatively different from non-human evolution.\n“Rational” utilitarianism constitutes the most advanced\nform of “ethical check[ing]” insofar as it specifies the\n“equitable limits to his [the individual’s] activities,\nand of the restraints which must be imposed upon him” in his\ninteractions with others (Spencer, vol. I, 1901:\n 125–28).[15]\n In short, once we begin systematizing our inchoate utilitarian\nintuitions with the principle of equal freedom and its derivative\nmoral rights, we begin “check[ing]” evolutionary struggle\nfor survival with unprecedented skill and subtlety. We\nself-consciously invest our utilitarianism with stringent liberal\nprinciples in order to advance our well-being as never before. \nNow Henry Sidgwick seems to have understood what Spencer meant by\n“rational” utilitarianism better than most, although\nSidgwick didn’t get Spencer entirely right either. Sidgwick\nengaged Spencer critically on numerous occasions. The concluding of\nBook II of The Methods of Ethics (1907), entitled\n“Deductive Hedonism,” is a sustained though veiled\ncriticism of\n Spencer.[16] \nFor Sidgwick, Spencer’s utilitarianism was merely seemingly\ndeductive even though it purported to be more scientific and\nrigorously rational than “empirical” utilitarianism.\nHowever, deductive hedonism fails because, contrary to what deductive\nhedonists like Spencer think, no general science of the causes of\npleasure and pain exists, insuring that we will never succeed in\nformulating universal, indefeasible moral rules for promoting\nhappiness. Moreover, Spencer only makes matters worse for himself in\nclaiming that we can nevertheless formulate indefeasible moral rules\nfor hypothetically perfectly moral human beings. First of all, in\nSidgwick’s view, since we can’t possibly imagine what\nperfectly moral humans would look like, we could never possibly deduce\nan ideal moral code of “absolute” ethics for them.\nSecondly, even if we could somehow conceptualize such a code, it would\nnevertheless provide inadequate normative guidance to humans as we\nfind them with all their actual desires, emotions and irrational\n proclivities.[17]\n For Sidgwick, all we have is utilitarian common-sense, which we can,\nand should, try to refine and systematize according the demands of our\nchanging\n circumstances.[18] \nSidgwick, then, faulted Spencer for deceiving himself in thinking that\nhe had successfully made “empirical” utilitarianism more\nrigorous by making it deductive and therefore “rational.”\nRather, Spencer was simply offering just another variety of\n“empirical” utilitarianism instead. Nevertheless,\nSpencer’s version of “empirical” utilitarianism was\nmuch closer to Sidgwick’s than Sidgwick recognized. Spencer not\nonly shadowed Mill substantively but Sidgwick methodologically. \nIn the preface to the sixth edition of The Methods of Ethics\n(1901), Sidgwick writes that as he became increasingly aware of the\nshortcomings of utilitarian calculation, he became ever more sensitive\nto the utilitarian efficacy of common sense “on the ground of\nthe general presumption which evolution afforded that moral sentiments\nand opinions would point to conduct conducive to general\nhappiness…” (Sidgwick, 1907: xxiii). In other words,\ncommon sense morality is a generally reliable, right-making decision\nprocedure because social evolution has privileged the emergence of\ngeneral happiness-generating moral sentiments. And whenever common\nsense fails us with conflicting or foggy guidance, we have little\nchoice but to engage in order-restoring, utilitarian calculation. The\nlatter works hand-in-glove with the former, forever refining and\nsystematizing it. \nNow Spencer’s “empirical” utilitarianism works much\nthe same way even though Spencer obfuscated these similarities by\nspuriously distinguishing between “empirical” and\nsupposedly superior, “rational” utilitarianism. Much like\nSidgwick, Spencer holds that our common sense moral judgments derive\ntheir intuitive force from their proven utility-promoting power\ninherited from one generation to the next. Contrary to what\n“empirical” utilitarians like Bentham have mistakenly\nmaintained, we never make utilitarian calculations in an\nintuition-free vacuum. Promoting utility is never simply a matter of\nchoosing options, especially when much is at stake, by calculating and\ncritically comparing utilities. Rather, the emergence of utilitarian\npractical reasoning begins wherever our moral intuitions breakdown.\nMoral science tests and refines our moral intuitions, which often\nprove “necessarily vague” and contradictory. In order to\n“make guidance by them adequate to all requirements, their\ndictates have to be interpreted and made definite by science; to which\nend there must be analysis of those conditions to complete living\nwhich they respond to, and from converse with which they have\narisen.” Such analysis invariably entails recognizing the\nhappiness of “each and all, as the end to be achieved by\nfulfillment of these conditions” (Spencer, vol. I, 1978:\n204). \n“Empirical” utilitarianism is “unconsciously\nmade” out of the “accumulated results of past human\nexperience,” eventually giving way to “rational”\nutilitarianism which is “determined by the intellect”\n(Spencer, 1969: 279 ff.). The latter, moreover, “implies\nguidance by the general conclusions which analysis of experience\nyields,” calculating the “distant effects” on lives\n“at large” (Spencer, 1981: 162–5). \nIn sum, “rational” utilitarianism is critical and\nempirical rather than deductive. It resolutely though judiciously\nembraces indefeasible moral rights as necessary conditions of general\nhappiness, making utilitarianism rigorously and uncompromisingly\nliberal. And it was also evolutionary, much like Sidgwick’s. For\nboth Spencer and Sidgwick, utilitarian practical reasoning exposes,\nrefines and systematizes our underlying moral intuitions, which have\nthus far evolved in spite of their under-appreciated utility. Whereas\nSpencer labeled this progress towards “rational”\nutilitarianism, Sidgwick more appropriately called this\n“progress in the direction of a closer approximation to a\nperfectly enlightened [empirical] Utilitarianism” (Sidgwick,\n1907: 455). \nNotwithstanding the undervalued similarities between their respective\nversions of evolutionary utilitarianism, Spencer and Sidgwick\nnevertheless parted company in two fundamental respects. First,\nwhereas for Spencer, “rational” utilitarianism refines\n“empirical” utilitarianism by converging on indefeasible\nmoral rights, for Sidgwick, systematization never ceases. Rather,\nsystematizing common sense continues indefinitely in order to keep\npace with the vicissitudes of our social circumstances. The best\nutilitarian strategy requires flexibility and not the cramping\nrigidity of unyielding rights. In effect, Spencer’s\nutilitarianism was too dogmatically liberal for Sidgwick’s more\ntempered political tastes. \nSecond, Spencer was a Lamarckian while Sidgwick was not. For Spencer,\nmoral faculty exercise hones each individual’s moral intuitions.\nBeing biologically (and not just culturally) inheritable, these\nintuitions become increasingly authoritative in succeeding\ngenerations, favoring those cultures wherever moral common sense\nbecomes more uncompromising all things being equal. Eventually,\nmembers of favored societies begin consciously recognizing, and\nfurther deliberately refining, the utility-generating potency of their\ninherited moral intuitions. “Rational,” scientific\nutilitarianism slowly replaces common sense, “empirical”\nutilitarianism as we learn the incomparable value of equal freedom and\nits derivative moral rights as everyday utilitarian decision\n procedures.[19] \nTheir differences aside, Spencer was nonetheless as much a utilitarian\nas Sidgwick, which the latter fully recognized though we should\nhesitate labeling Spencer a classical utilitarian as we now label\nSidgwick. Moreover, Sidgwick was hardly alone at the turn of the\ntwentieth-century in depicting Spencer as fundamentally utilitarian.\nJ. H. Muirhead viewed him as a utilitarian as did W. D. Ross as late\nas 1939. (Muirhead, 1897: 136; Ross, 1939: 59). Even scholars in\nGermany at that time read Spencer as a utilitarian. For instance, A.\nG. Sinclair viewed him as a utilitarian worth comparing with Sidgwick.\nIn his 1907 Der Utilitarismus bei Sidgwick und Spencer,\nSinclair concludes “Daher ist er [Spencer], wie wir schon gesagt\nhaben, ein evolutionistischer Hedonist und nicht ein ethischer\nEvolutionist,” which we can translate as “Therefore he\n(Spencer) is, as we have already seen, an evolutionary hedonist and\nnot an ethical evolutionist” (Sinclair, 1907: 49). So however\nmuch we have fallen into the erroneous habit of regarding Spencer as\nlittle invested with 19th-century utilitarianism, he was not received\nthat way at all by his immediate contemporaries both in England and in\ncontinental Europe. \nNot only was Spencer less than a “social Darwinist” as we\nhave come to understand social Darwinism, but he was also less\nunambiguously libertarian as some, such as Eric Mack and Tibor Machan,\nhave made him out to be. Not only his underlying utilitarianism but\nalso the distinction, which he never forswears, between “rights\nproperly so-called” and “political” rights, makes it\nproblematic to read him as what we would call a\n‘libertarian’. \nWhereas “rights properly so-called” are authentic\nspecifications of equal freedom, “political rights” are\nnot. They are interim devices conditional on our moral imperfection.\nInsofar as we remain morally imperfect requiring government\nenforcement of moral rights proper, political rights insure that\ngovernment nevertheless remains mostly benign, never unduly violating\nmoral rights proper themselves. The “right to ignore the\nstate” and the right of universal suffrage are two essential\npolitical rights for Spencer. In Social Statics, Spencer says\n“we cannot choose but admit the right of the citizen to adopt a\ncondition of voluntary outlawry.” Every citizen is “free\nto drop connection with the state – to relinquish its protection\nand to refuse paying for its support” (Spencer, 1970: 185). For\nSpencer, this right helps restrict government to protecting proper\nmoral rights because it allows citizens to take their business\nelsewhere when it doesn’t. \nHowever, Spencer eventually repudiated this mere political\nright.  For instance, in his 1894 An Autobiography, he\ninsists that since citizens “cannot avoid benefiting by the\nsocial order which government maintains,” they have no right to\nopt out from its protection (Spencer, 1904, vol. 1: 362). They may not\nlegitimately take their business elsewhere whenever they feel that\ntheir fundamental moral rights are being ill-protected. Because he\neventually repudiated the “right to ignore the state,” we\nshould not interpret Spencer as he comes across in Nozick 1974 (p.\n289–290, footnote 10, the text of which is on p. 350), where he is\nreferenced in support of such a right. \nSpencer’s commitment to the right of universal suffrage likewise\nwanes in his later writings. Whereas in Social Statics, he\nregards universal suffrage as a dependable means of preventing\ngovernment from overreaching its duty of sticking to protecting moral\nrights proper, by the later Principles of Ethics he concludes\nthat universal suffrage fails to do this effectively and so he\nabandons his support of it. He later concluded that universal suffrage\nthreatened respect for moral rights more than it protected them. \nUniversal suffrage, especially when extended to women, encouraged\n“over-legislation,” allowing government to take up\nresponsibilities which were none of its business. \nSpencer, then, was more than willing to modify political rights in\nkeeping with his changing assessment of how well they secured basic\nmoral rights on whose sanctity promoting happiness depended. The more\nhe became convinced that certain political rights were accordingly\ncounterproductive, the more readily he forsook them and the less\ndemocratic, if not patently libertarian, he became. \nLikewise, Spencer’s declining enthusiasm for land\nnationalization (which Hillel Steiner has recently found so\ninspiring), coupled with growing doubts that it followed as a\ncorollary from the principle of equal freedom, testify to his waning\n radicalism.[20]\n According to Spencer in Social Statics, denying every\ncitizen the right to use of the earth equally was a “crime\ninferior only in wickedness to the crime of taking away their lives or\npersonal liberties” (Spencer: 1970, 182.)  Private land\nownership was incompatible with equal freedom because it denied most\ncitizens equal access to the earth’s surface on which faculty\nexercise and happiness ultimately depended. However, by The\nPrinciples of Ethics, Spencer abandoned advocating comprehensive\nland nationalization, much to Henry George’s ire. George, an\nAmerican, had previously regarded Spencer as a formidable ally in his\ncrusade to abolish private land tenure. \nNow Spencer’s repudiation of the moral right to use the earth\nand the political right to ignore the state, as well as the political\nright of universal suffrage, undermines his distinction between\nrational and empirical utilitarianism. In forswearing the right to use\nthe earth — because he subsequently became convinced that land\nnationalization undermined, rather than promoted general utility\n— Spencer betrays just how much of a traditional empirical\nutilitarian he was. He abandoned land nationalization not because he\nconcluded that the right to use the earth did not follow deductively\nfrom the principle of equal freedom. Rather, he abandoned land reform\nsimply because he became convinced that it was an empirically\ncounterproductive strategy for promoting utility. \nEven more obviously, by repudiating political rights like the\n“right to ignore the state” and universal suffrage rights,\nhe similarly divulged just how much empirical utilitarian\nconsiderations trumped all else in his practical reasoning. Not only\nwas Spencer not a committed or consistent libertarian, but he was not\nmuch of rational utilitarian either. In the end, Spencer was mostly,\nto repeat, what we would now call a liberal utilitarian who, much like\nMill, tried to combine strong rights with utility though, in\nSpencer’s case, he regarded moral rights as indefeasible. \nAllan Gibbard has suggested that, for Sidgwick, in refining and\nsystematizing common sense, we transform “unconscious\nutilitarianism” into “conscious utilitarianism.” We\n“apply scientific techniques of felicific assessment to further\nthe achievement of the old, unconscious goal” (Gibbard in Miller\nand Williams, eds., 1982: 72). Spencer’s “liberal”\nutilitarianism was comparable moral science. Sidgwick, however, aimed\nsimply at “progress in the direction of a closer approximation\nto a perfectly enlightened Utilitarianism” (Sidgwick, 1907:\n455). Spencer, by contrast, had more grandiose aspirations for\nrepairing utilitarianism. Merely moving towards “perfectly\nenlightened Utilitarianism” was scientifically under ambitious.\nFully “enlightened” utilitarianism was conceptually\naccessible and perhaps even politically practicable. And Spencer had\ndiscovered its secret, namely indefeasible moral rights. \nSpencer, then, merits greater esteem if for no other reason than that\nSidgwick, besides Mill, took him so seriously as a fellow utilitarian\nworthy of his critical attention. Unfortunately, contemporary\nintellectual history has been less kind, preferring a more convenient\nand simplistic narrative of the liberal canon that excludes him. \nSpencer’s “liberal” utilitarianism was bolder and\narguably more unstable than either Mill or Sidgwick’s. He\nfollowed Mill investing utilitarianism with robust moral rights hoping\nto keep it ethically appealing without forgoing its systemic\ncoherence. While the principle of utility retreats to the background\nas a standard of overall normative assessment, moral rights serve as\neveryday sources of direct moral obligation, making Spencer no less an\nindirect utilitarian than Mill. But Spencer’s indirect\nutilitarianism is more volatile, more logically precarious, because\nSpencer burdened rights with indefeasibility while Mill made them\nstringent but nevertheless overridable depending on the magnitude of\nthe utility at stake. For Spencer, we never compromise basic rights\nlet the heavens fall. But for Mill, the prospect of collapsing heavens\nwould easily justify appealing directly to the principle of utility at\nthe expense of respect for moral rights. \nNow, critics of utilitarianism from William Whewell (1794–1866)\nto David Lyons more recently have taken Mill and subsequent liberal\nutilitarians to task for trying to have their utilitarian cake and eat\ntheir liberalism too. As Lyons argues with great effect, by imposing\nliberal juridical constraints on the pursuit of general utility, Mill\nintroduces as a second normative criterion with independent\n“moral force” compromising his utilitarianism. He risks\nembracing value pluralism if not abandoning utilitarianism altogether.\nAnd if Mill’s liberal version of utilitarianism is just value\npluralism in disguise, then he still faces the further dilemma of how\nto arbitrate conflicts between utility and rights. If utility trumps\nrights only when enough of it is at stake, we must still ask how much\nenough is enough? And any systematic answer we might give simply\ninjects another normative criterion into the problematic logic of our\nliberal utilitarian stew since we have now introduced a third higher\ncriterion that legislates conflicts between the moral force of the\nprinciple of utility and the moral force of\n rights.[21] \nIf these dilemmas hold for Mill’s utilitarianism, then the\nimplications are both better and worse for Spencer. Though for Mill,\nutility always trumps rights when enough of the former is in jeopardy,\nwith Spencer, fundamental rights always trump utility no matter how\nmuch of the latter is imperiled. Hence, Spencer does not need to\nintroduce surreptitiously supplemental criteria for adjudicating\nconflicts between utility and rights because rights are indefeasible,\nnever giving way to the demands of utility or disutility no matter how\nimmediate and no matter how promising or how catastrophic. In short,\nfor Spencer, basic moral rights always carry the greater, practical\n(if not formal) moral force. Liberalism always supersedes\nutilitarianism in practice no matter how insistently Spencer feigns\nloyalty to the latter. \nNaturally, one can salvage this kind of utilitarianism’s\nauthenticity by implausibly contending that indefeasible moral rights\nalways (meaning literally without exception) work out for the\nutilitarian best over both the short and long-terms. As Wayne Sumner\ncorrectly suggests, “absolute rights are not an impossible\noutput for a consequentialist methodology” (Sumner, 1987: 211).\nWhile this maneuver would certainly rescue the logical integrity of\nSpencer’s liberal version of utilitarianism, it does so at the\ncost of considerable common sense credibility. And even if it were\nmiraculously true that respecting rights without exception just\nhappened to maximize long-term utility, empirically demonstrating this\ntruth would certainly prove challenging at best. Moreover,\nnotwithstanding this maneuver’s practical plausibility, it would\nnevertheless seem to cause utilitarianism to retire a “residual\nposition” that is indeed hardly “worth calling\nutilitarianism” (Williams in Smart and Williams, 1973: 135). \nWhether Spencer actually envisioned his utilitarianism this way is\nunclear. In any case, insofar as he also held that social evolution\nwas tending towards human moral perfectibility, he could afford to\nworry less and less about whether rights-based utilitarianism was a\nplausible philosophical enterprise. Increasing moral perfectibility\nmakes secondary decision procedures like basic moral rights\nunnecessary as a utility-promoting strategy. Why bother with promoting\ngeneral utility indirectly once we have learned to promote it directly\nwith certainty of success? Why bother with substitute sources of\nstand-in obligation when, thanks to having become moral saints, act\nutilitarianism will fortunately always do? But moral\nperfectibility’s unlikelihood is no less plausible than the\nlikelihood of fanatical respect for basic moral rights always working\nout for the utilitarian\n best.[22]\n In any case, just as the latter strategy causes utilitarianism to\nretire completely for practical purposes, so the former strategy\namounts to liberalism entirely retiring in turn. Hence, Mill’s\nversion of “liberal” utilitarianism must be deemed more\ncompelling and promising for those of us who remain stubbornly drawn\nto this problematical philosophical enterprise. \nSpencer’s rights-based utilitarianism nonetheless has much to\nrecommend for it despite its unconventional features and implausible\nimplications. Even more than Mill, he suggests how liberal\nutilitarians could attempt to moderate utilitarianism in other ways,\nenabling it to retain a certain measure of considerable ethical\nappeal. Spencer’s utilitarianism wears its liberalism not only\nby constraining the pursuit of utility externally by deploying robust\nmoral rights with palpable independent moral force. It also, and more\nsuccessfully, shows how utilitarians can liberalize their\nutilitarianism by building internal constraints into their maximizing\naims. If, following Spencer, we make our maximizing goal\ndistribution-sensitive by including everyone’s happiness within\nit so that each individual obtains his or her fair share, then we have\nsalvaged some kind of consequentialist authenticity while\nsimultaneously securing individual integrity too. We have salvaged\nutilitarianism as a happiness-promoting, if not a\nhappiness-maximizing, consequentialism. Because everyone is “to\ncount for one, nobody for more than one” not just as a resource\nfor generating utility but also as deserving to experience a share of\nit, no one may be sacrificed callously without limit for the good of\nthe\n rest.[23]\n No one may be treated as a means only but must be treated as an end\nas well. \nSpencer’s utilitarianism also has much to recommend for it\nsimply for its much undervalued importance in the development of\nmodern liberalism. If Mill and Sidgwick are critical to making sense\nof our liberal canon, then Spencer is no less critical. If both are\ncrucial for coming to terms with Rawls particularly, and consequently\nwith post-Rawlsianism generally, as I strongly believe both are, then\nSpencer surely deserves better from recent intellectual history.\nIntellectual history is one of the many important narratives we tell\nand retell ourselves. What a shame when we succumb to scholarly\nlaziness in constructing these narratives just because such laziness\nboth facilitates meeting the pedagogical challenges of teaching the\nliberal tradition and answering our need for a coherent philosophical\nidentity.","contact.mail":"weinstd@wfu.edu","contact.domain":"wfu.edu"}]
