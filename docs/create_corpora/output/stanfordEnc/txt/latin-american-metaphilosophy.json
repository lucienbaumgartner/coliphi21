The result of this reflection has been\nsubstantial debates on issues that are of interest not only to Latin\nAmerican philosophy, but to metaphilosophy in general. For they\nsimilarly arise for other less familiar philosophical traditions. This\nessay looks closely at those debates about Latin American philosophy.\nIt is focused on the analysis of its main problems and the positions\nat stake, without special attention to details of the history of the\nfield.\n\nThe nature of philosophy in Latin America first drew the attention of\nphilosophically-minded thinkers in the early nineteenth century, when\nthe region began to develop into nations independent from Spain. But\nit acquired greater significance with the birth of contemporary\nacademic philosophy in the following century, ultimately taking center\nstage in the second half of the 20th century, where we find\nit today. In fact, it can be broken down into a number of\ninter-related questions about Latin American philosophy’s\nexistence and its originality, authenticity, significance, and role in\nculture and society. \nBut, as in other regions, such questions in the Latin American context\nwere often triggered by discomfort with a philosophical status quo\nthat came to be regarded as inadequate. The critique of the status quo\nsometimes led to a careful reflection on what philosophy is\n(or should be), as a practice, and as an academic discipline.\nQuestions of this sort are ‘metaphilosophical’—where\nthis term of art need not be understood as having the connotation that\nthose who engage in metaphilosophy are stepping out of philosophy to\nlook at it from somewhere else (cf. Williamson 2007, p. ix). The\nmetaphilosophy of Latin American philosophy is itself one of Latin\nAmerican philosophy’s central topics. It triggered skepticism\nabout whether there is a philosophy that can rightly be called Latin\nAmerican, as well as views about which properties are desirable for a\nphilosophy of that sort. More recently, Latin American metaphilosophy\nitself has become the object of reflection (Hurtado 2007, Vargas\n2007). Such reflection, which attempts a theoretical\n‘ascent’ that might be properly considered\nmeta-metaphilosophical, will not be of concern here. \nAcademic philosophy, or autonomous philosophy as practiced in the\nWest since the Enlightenment, did not begin in Latin America\nuntil the first half of the twentieth century. Initially, the reigning\nphilosophical paradigm in the region was Scholasticism. That medieval\nstyle of philosophy prevailed during the colonial period, which\nextended roughly from the early sixteenth century to the early\nnineteenth century. Mainly confined to rehearsing the doctrines of\nclassical and medieval European philosophers, Latin American\nScholasticism was not to be challenged until the eighteenth century,\nwhen the theories of the Enlightenment and the rise of modern\nphilosophy began to be known in the American colonies of Spain and\nPortugal. \nParallel to these philosophical developments, a non-academic type of\nphilosophy consistently prospered in Latin America from the sixteenth\ncentury to the present. It comprises philosophical positions expressed\nin essay format, a hybrid genre cultivated by political and religious\nleaders, scientists, and literary figures among others. Interested in\nthe intersection of philosophy with literature, religion, and\npolitics, non-academic philosophical thinkers made significant\ncontributions to the intellectual history of Latin America. As may be\nexpected, however, the line separating academic and non-academic\nphilosophy is not always sharp. Although it’s clear that a work\nsuch as the Labyrinth of Solitude, by the Mexican writer and\ndiplomat Octavio Paz (1914–1998)\n [1]\n falls within the latter, and Lógica viva (Living\nLogic), by Uruguayan philosopher Carlos Vaz Ferreira\n(1872–1958) falls within the former, there are many borderline\ncases. Consider Lascasianism: first developed by the Dominican friar\nand theologian Bartolomé de las Casas (Spanish-born,\n1474–1566) in colonial times, the doctrine is still influential\nin the work of Peruvian Gustavo Guttiérrez and other\ncontemporary liberation theologians. It advocates a perfectionist\nversion of Roman Catholic ethics according to which the ways of life\nthat should be promoted are those that make people more \nhuman—a thesis consistent with las Casas’ 1552 vindication of\nthe humanity of Amerindians (i.e., their personhood). Since\nLascasianism has philosophical grounds and implications but is a\nproduct of amateur philosophers, it stands out as a prime borderline\ncase between academic and non-academic philosophy. \nWhen did philosophy begin in Latin America? Any answer to this\nquestion would depend in part to whether one is asking about the\nbeginning of academic or non-academic philosophy. There is consensus\nthat some form of academic philosophy, mostly connected with teaching,\nexisted during the colonial period. An example of a successful work\nfrom this early period is Lógica mexicana, a textbook\nby the Mexican Antonio Rubio (1548–1615) widely used at the\ntime, even in Spain. But it was not until the early twentieth century\nthat philosophy acquired contemporary scholarly dimensions, including\nstandard institutional manifestations. \nAn interesting metaphilosophical issue related to the origin of Latin\nAmerican philosophy is whether the philosophical thought of\nPre-Colombian cultures also belongs in the non-academic tradition.\nNeedless to say, pre-Columbian thought unfolds in ways that seem\nutterly alien to our current standards about the form, content, or\nmethod method typical of philosophical work. But compliance with any\nsuch standards falls short of being a necessary condition for a work\nto count as philosophical. After all, the works of Pythagoras and the\nother Pre-Socratics are quite unorthodox in those respects yet\nconsidered philosophical. And contemporary examples too are not far to\nseek. Wittgenstein immediately comes to mind. A number of Latin\nAmerican philosophers are now prepared to agree with Peruvian\nFrancisco Miró Quesada that “[i]n a broad sense,\nphilosophy has always existed in Latin America. The Maya and the Inca\nhad thought that, without abusing the terms, may be considered of\nphilosophical character….” (1978, p. 75, my translation).\nTextual evidence of the existence of philosophical thought among the\nAztecs has been provided and analyzed by a number of experts. For\nexample, Bernardino de Sahagún (1499–1590), a Spanish\nfriar turned into amateur ethnologist, and contemporary philosophers\nsuch as Mexican Miguel León Portilla (1963) and American James\nMaffie (2009, 2014). \nNuccetelli (2011) considers pre-Columbian works of philosophical\nimport to be part of Latin American proto-philosophy of the\nnon-academic variety. Gracia’s (2008) understanding of Latin\nAmerican philosophy as ethnic philosophy (more on this later) can also\naccommodate pre-Columbian philosophical works within that discipline.\nBut Gracia (especially in his 2010) defers taking a position on\nwhether works such as the Maya folk-cosmology in the Popol Vuh\ncount as Latin American philosophy until proper historical work can\nprovide more stable and widely accepted answers about what falls\nwithin that ethnic philosophy and what doesn’t. \nAs noted above, in contemporary Latin American philosophy lively\nmetaphilosophical debates, recognized as such by its participants, are\na frequent occurrence. The Peruvian Augusto Salazar Bondy\n(1925–1974) held that such debates belong to “the\nphilosophy of philosophy” (1968, p. 13). He also divided the\nissues at stake into three categories, descriptive, prescriptive, or\nidentity issues (1968, p. 11), a classification that is for the most\npart still current. One exception is that, today, questions about\nwhether a philosophy is “original, genuine, or peculiar”\nare not strictly descriptive. For these predicates seem both\ndescriptive and evaluative, and therefore analogous to others now\nconsidered thick moral predicates, such as\n‘cruel,’ ‘loyal,’ and the like. \nThe principal purely descriptive question in those debates concerns\nwhether philosophy exists as a practice or discipline in\nLatin America. When answered in the affirmative, a related question is\nwhen did it begin? There is consensus that the practice of philosophy\nsin más (as such—i.e., for its own sake,\nautonomous of non-philosophical interests) is an early\ntwentieth-century phenomenon. But, understood in a broader sense, it\ndates from the colonial period. Thus, some take Latin American\nphilosophy to be a contemporary phenomenon (e.g., Miró Quesada\n1974, p. 75), while others trace it back to the sixteenth century\n(e.g., Gracia et al. 1995, p. 462; Hurtado 2007, p. 47). The\ndisagreement, however, is only apparent, since as noted by Francisco\nRomero one can acknowledge the colonial origins of (broad) philosophy\nwhile noting “the prevalence [then] of pedagogical over\nphilosophical concerns with regard to creativity and even the\nre-thinking of one’s ideas and doctrines” (1941, p. 12,\nsee also his 1943, p. 127). \nThe descriptive question about the existence of a Latin American\n(academic) philosophy can be sharpened by breaking it down into\nsmaller questions concerning the truth of each of the following\nclaims: \nSince the early twentieth century, there has been a strong endorsement\nof claim (I) (Alberini 1927; Romero 1943; Miró Quesada 1978;\nMoulines 2010). But critics are more cautious about previous periods,\npointing out that during the colonial period Latin American philosophy\nwas not autonomous from education. During the nineteenth century, as\nclearly evident in the work of Latin American positivists,\nphilosophical concerns had close connections to political and social\ninterests. In fact, up to about the 1910s, there was room for\nskepticism about all three claims. Between the 1910s and the 40s, a\ngeneration of philosophers known as the fundadores\n(‘Founders’) strove to develop philosophy in Latin America\nas an autonomous discipline within academia, with the usual\nprofessional organizations and institutions. It was clearly owing to\ntheir efforts that philosophy became a practice in their universities\nanalogous to what their peers were doing at the time in major Western\ncenters of scholarship. For the first time since the Wars of\nIndependence and the national organization that followed (roughly,\nl810–1898), philosophy began to be studied for its own sake.\nMoreover, it became a professional activity with recognition in the\nwider community. Through all of these developments, the\nFounders’ efforts bore fruit in establishing philosophical\n“normalcy” (maturity). Philosophers of the next generation\nstrove to make the transformations stable. The Argentine Eduardo\nRabossi (1930–2005) observes that Latin American philosophy\ndeveloped relatively quickly compared to philosophy in Europe, since\nalthough Latin America followed European models, it was not until the\nnineteenth century that Europe itself acquired its own philosophical\n“normalcy” (1994, p. 36). \nBe that as it may, by the 1940s not only (I) but also (III) above\nseemed true, as suggested by Rabossi’s 1994 vivid narrative of\nthe vicissitudes faced by Alejandro Korn (1860–1936) and other\nArgentinean Founders in their effort to create a Facultad de\nFilosofía y Letras (College of Liberal Arts) at\nthe Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires. \nGiven a current view that we may call ‘new skepticism,’\nhowever, claim (II) is false: Latin American philosophy still lacks\ninner and outer dialogue of the sort needed to develop stable\nphilosophical traditions and communities. Ezcurdia (2003),\nGarcía-Ramírez (2011), Hurtado (2006, 2007), Pereda\n(2006), and Rabossi (1994, 2008) are all new skeptics committed to\ndenying some version of (II) on the grounds that Latin American\nphilosophy faces what some of them refer to as an\n“invisibility” problem. Latin American philosophy is\ninvisible because it has these problems \nThe new skeptics mostly take the occurrence of an IDP for granted,\ndevoting little effort to providing reliable evidence for it. And when\navailable, the evidence is often difficult to test. A notable\nexception is Pereda 2006, which points out the lack of sufficient\nreference to Latin American publications in the numerous contributions\nby Latin Americans to the Enciclopedia iberoamericana de\nfilosofía (a multi-volume reference work whose first\nvolume appeared in 1987). Other adduced evidence is anecdotal,\ngenerally appealing to widespread occurrence of an IDP observed at\nconferences, learned societies, etc. Narratives to this effect\ncommonly describe Latin American philosophers as intellectuals who\nfail to engage in the study and discussion of their own traditions,\nwhich they perceive as uninteresting, of poor quality, or\ndisenfranchising. For example, adopting Enrique Dussel’s 1998\ncenter/periphery distinction, Rabossi (2008, pp. 102ff.; see also his\n1994) tells us that the Latin American philosopher is a\n“periphery philosopher,” with the self-image of a\n‘guacho’ (slang for ‘orphan,’ or even\n‘street urchin’). The guacho not only fails to\nacknowledge his own “philosophical parents,” but\ndoesn’t want to know about them at all: “he doesn’t\ntake them into account, he doesn’t read them, he is not even\ninterested in criticizing their defects or limitations; for him, his\nown philosophical past doesn’t exist” (2008, p. 103, my\ntranslation). Without awareness of his own philosophical past and\ndialog with regional peers, the Latin American philosopher can have\nneither philosophical traditions nor genuine philosophical\ncommunities. A related claim is made by Hurtado (2006, pp. 206ff.;\n2007. pp. 24ff.), for whom the IDP arises for Mexican philosophy, and\nby extension for Latin American philosophy, owing to the fact that\nmany of its practitioners have followed a “modernizing\nmodel.” Among the numerous unwelcome traits of this model are\nthe tendencies of its followers to form small groups and spend most of\ntheir time trying to learn some imported philosophy, citing only\nforeign philosophers without paying much attention to regional peers.\nThose who adopt this model proceed to study the latest modern\ntradition, which uncritically replaces previous ones. At the end of\nthe day, in Latin American philosophy “…each modernizing\nmovement got lost for the upcoming movement…” (Hurtado\n2006, p. 206), and there are neither traditions nor stable communities\nof dialogue. “But the foreign philosophers,” laments\nHurtado, “even those who visit our countries to deliver talks,\nvery rarely quote us in their work. There is therefore no genuine\ndialogue…” (Hurtado 2006, p. 205). For Hurtado,in\naddition to the IDP, Latin American philosophy faces the EDP. And of\nthe two problems, the IDP is the “central” one, thus the\nEDP appears to depend on the IDP (see also\nGarcía-Ramírez 2011, and compare Ezcurdia 2003). In any\nevent, on this view, Latin American philosophers will continue to face\nthe IDP “unless we create a genuine critical dialogue among\nourselves and simultaneously exercise a constantly renewed memory of\npast dialogues” (2006, p. 210). Until then, claim (II) is\nfalse. \nBut the new skeptics, confident that both problems, the IDP and EDP,\ncan be resolved invariably offer a list of suggestions about how to do\nthat. There is, however, considerable unacknowledged overlap in such\n“repair manuals,” which suggests that the new skeptics\nfail to establish among themselves an internal philosophical dialogue\nwhose very absence from Latin American philosophy they see as a\nproblem. If this ad hominem is strong, then the new skeptics’\nchallenge to claim (II) is not without problems of its own. For the\nargument charges that new skepticism appears itself to suffer from the\nvery flaw it criticizes in Latin American philosophy: namely, the new\nskeptic omits not just establishing a dialogue with, but even\nacknowledging, the works by other Latin American philosophers on the\ntopic at issue. And although some new skeptics do make some such\nreferences (e.g., García-Ramírez 2011), these are\nlimited to the work of those who are also new skeptics. But not all\nLatin American philosophers face the IDP, since as we shall see next\nthere is abundant textual evidence that the metaphilosophical\nquestions of concern here have generated intense dialogue and\ndiscernible skeptical and anti-skeptical traditions. For this reason,\nclaim (II)—viz., that there are stable philosophical traditions\nand communities in the region, of the sort commonly found in major\ncenters of Western philosophy— has not yet been shown false. \nAnswers to the evaluative questions of whether there is, or\ncould be, a Latin American philosophy that is original, authentic,\npeculiar, or in some other ways distinctive constitute a wide\nphilosophical spectrum, with what may be called ‘strong\nuniversalism’ at one extreme, ‘strong distinctivism’\nat the other, and ‘middle-way theories’ in between. \nStrong universalism is the view that all philosophical theories,\nmethods, and topics have an import that is universal rather than\nrelative to regions, persons, groups, or cultures. It conflicts with\nstrong distinctivism, the view that all of philosophy’s\ntheories, methods, and topics represent the point of view of a region,\nperson, group, or culture. The contemporary representatives of\nuniversalism in Latin American philosophy are many and have different\nphilosophical orientations (for an overview of classic universalism,\nsee Salazar Bondy 1968, pp. 45ff.). Universalism appears to be what\nArgentinean Pablo Navarro has in mind when he asserts “Legal\nphilosophy in Latin America does not differ significantly from\nphilosophical studies of the law in the United States, Germany, the\nUK, or Sweden” (2009, p.\n 439).[2]\n Gracia 2000 and Montemayor 2011 associate being a\nscientifically-minded philosopher with favoring universalism. Perhaps\nthe connection is grounded in some such philosophers’ previous\ncommitment to the objectivity of science, together with their thesis\nthat science is the model for philosophy. \nFor a classic representative of universalism we need to look no\nfurther than the work of the Argentine Risieri Frondizi\n(1910–1983), who by combining universalism with originalism was\nled to the skeptical conclusion that, in the late 1940s, only a very\nsmall part of philosophy in Latin America deserved to be considered\nphilosophy at all. But as pointed out earlier by his compatriot\nJosé Ingenieros (1887–1925), not everything needs to be\n(indeed we might say, ‘can be’) original in the work of\n“a true philosopher” (Ingenieros 1914, p. 7). Furthermore,\nnot only is originality a matter of degree but the term\n‘original’ is itself ambiguous. It has been used with\nconnotations such as \nPutting aside Hurtado’s more idiosyncratic understanding of the\nterm and Ingenieros’s too permissive understanding as a\nsynonymous of ‘autochthonous,’ we have: \nWe’ll now consider two positions, Frondizi 1949 and Pereda 2000,\neach committed to holding that Latin American academic philosophy\nfails to be sufficiently original in the above sense. Frondizi’s\ncommitment to this thesis is explicit: he concludes that based on the\nevidence, only 10% of philosophy ‘as such’ in Latin\nAmerica is original. Since the works of non-academic philosophers are\nexcluded from this evidence, as a result Latin American philosophy is\ndevoid of significant history, theories, methods, and number of\ncreative practitioners. Nuccetelli 2003 responds to this skeptical\nview by arguing that by contrast with academic philosophers in Latin\nAmerica, the non-academic philosophers have offered the more original\nphilosophical positions. Furthermore, in other parts of the world\ncontributions by non-academics who did not practice philosophy for its\nown sake are often counted as philosophy, as exemplified by works of\nHume, Bentham, Mill, Saint Simon, Marx and many others. If this is\ncorrect, then Frondizi’s criterion turns out to be too\ndemanding. In addition, Gracia (2003) notes that in no other\nethnic philosophy (more on this later) is originality\nconsidered a necessary condition for having philosophy \nPereda’s recent work also shows he thinks that there is an\noriginality problem facing Latin American philosophy, an skeptical\nview presupposed by his claim that philosophy in the region is\n“invisible” (i.e., suffers from the IDP and EDP mentioned\nabove). Like Frondizi, Pereda first praises the work of Latin American\nessayists, and even takes it to be a model that philosophy must\nemulate in order to overcome its invisibility problems. But to be a\nmodel that needs emulation is one thing, to count as Latin American\nphilosophy quite another. Since Pereda also locates non-academic\nphilosophy somewhere else, as a result, he runs head-on into a\nconclusion similar to Frondizi’s skepticism about the features\nof Latin American philosophy. Such skepticism is inevitable because on\nPereda’s view, Latin American philosophy suffers from the\n“arrogant reasoning” of its practitioners, which fuels the\nepistemic vices of “nationalist enthusiasm” (in the case\nof distinctivists) or “subaltern fervor” and\n“craving for novelty” (in the case of universalists). Such\nvices, and ultimately arrogant reasoning itself, are to be blamed for\nthe internal and external invisibility of Latin American\nphilosophy. \nIt can now be shown that these alleged vices of universalists, if\nsubstantiated, would raise an originality challenge to Latin America\nphilosophy. After all, universalism has many representatives of a\ngreat variety of persuasions (Gracia and Jaksić 1986, p. 214;\nMiró Quesada 1978, p. 76; Salazar Bondy 1968, pp. 49ff.). If\nuniversalists are driven by subaltern fervor and a craving for\nnovelty, then they need perforce to devote considerable time\nand effort to assimilating the latest fads (something they have done,\naccording to Hurtado’s 2006 critique of the modernizing model).\nSince producing work that is to a significant degree original requires\nconsiderable time and effort, there would be empirical constraints on\nthose philosophers’ capability to produce original work. \nTherefore, it seems that the invisibility problem is closely connected\nwith the originality problem. But although all new skeptics think\nthere is an invisibility problem for Latin American philosophy, they\ndisagree about what to make of the originality problem. For new\nskeptic Maite Ezcurdia (2003), it does arise. On her view, of four\nkinds of originality she identifies as desirable in philosophy (viz.,\ninterpretative, argumentative, problem-making, and problem-solving),\nLatin American philosophy comes out as having interpretative\noriginality, yet lacking originality of the other three kinds. In\nparticular, Ezcurdia contends that an improvement in problem-solving\noriginality is needed for fixing the EDP, which would in turn lead to\na solution to the IDP. On the other hand, Eduardo\nGarcía-Ramírez (2011, p. 13) dismisses the originality\nproblem but writes: “even though there is enough originality,\nmost Latin American philosophy is haunted by the two proceedings of\narrogant reasoning: internal visibility is a function of the external\npartly because Latin American philosophy is not used to thinking on\nits own.” Questions arise, however, as to how could there be\nenough originality in a philosophy that’s not used to thinking\non its own? \nAccording to distinctivists, a chief distinguishing characteristic of\nLatin American philosophy is—or should be—authenticity, a\nfeature of any “philosophical product that, like any other\ncultural product has integrity and is devoid of falsity or pretense.\nIn this sense, we say, for example, that Kant’s philosophy is\nauthentic, but spiritism is pseudo-philosophy” (Salazar Bondy\n1968, pp. 100–101, my translation). Salazar (1968, p. 101) and\n(Hurtado 2006, p. 209) distinguish authenticity from\npeculiarity, the regional coloring of a philosophical product\nthat is characteristically Latin American. A philosophical work may be\npeculiar by virtue of discussing a Latin American theme or by virtue\nof being the product of a Latin American author, even when it could\nlack authenticity, originality, or both. At the same time, it could be\noriginal and/or authentic without being peculiar. Since a full account\nof such conceptual inter-relations goes beyond our present purpose,\nlet’s stipulate that a Latin American philosophy is \nAs pointed out by Salazar, feature (3) is the cheapest of all: it can\neasily be obtained by a work whose topic, or even author, is\nrelevantly related to Latin America. Although, as we’ll soon\nsee, peculiarity may be what some distinctivists actually have in\nmind, more often they care most about authenticity—holding that\noriginality will come ‘for añadidura’ (as an\naddition). \nAn early proposal to develop a peculiar Latin American philosophy is\nthat of the Argentine Juan Bautista Alberdi (1810–1884) in his\n“Ideas….” This short newspaper article, published\nin Montevideo in 1840, offers advice about how to develop a high\nschool course in philosophy to be taught at the Colegio de Humanidades\n(School of Humanities). It recommends that the course be aimed at\n“instruct[ing] the youth in the principles that reside in the\nconscience of our societies” (1840, p. 97, my translation). On\nthis view, Latin American philosophy should be devoted, not to\nabstract metaphysics, but rather to applied philosophy, focusing on\nthe social and political issues of the day in the newly independent\nnations of the region. But Alberdi’s article also ventures into\nmetaphilosophical issues that were far beyond politics and diplomacy,\nhis areas of expertise—notoriously opining, among other things,\nthat it was for Europe, not Latin America, to do the theoretical\nphilosophical thinking (1840, p. 95). Not to be reprinted until the\nfollowing century, this article is unlikely to have had the influence\nascribed to it by some distinctivists of the 1940s and their\nfollowers. The point is made forcefully by the Uruguayan Arturo Ardao\n(1912–2003), a well-known historian of Latin American philosophy\nwho contends that the article “came to have influence in Latin\nAmerica in the context of the philosophical innovations of the 1940s,\nprecisely a year after its centennial. Its most decisive apologist\nturned out to be the magisterial philosopher Gaos in Mexico ”\n(1991, p. xxiii, my translation). Arturo Roig also regards the\ntwentieth-century fascination with Alberdi’s “Ideas”\nas an ideological coincidence. He writes: \nFor a more contemporary vindication of features of Latin American\nphilosophy akin to peculiarity, we’ll need to turn to some of\nthe middle-way theories below. But first, let’s consider the two\nmain strands of extreme distinctivism in Latin American philosophy,\nthe ‘the critical theory’ and\n‘circumstantialism’ (also known as ‘critical\nview,’ and ‘culturalism’ respectively; see e.g.,\nGracia and Jaksić 1986). \nThe critical theory is a hybrid that includes theses from early\ntwentieth century Marxists as well as the views of contemporary\n‘liberation philosophers,’ who in turn combine Marxist\nideas with European doctrines from French structuralism, the Frankfurt\nSchool, and other sources. Abundant textual evidence suggests that,\nfor the critical theorist, Latin America philosophy commonly lacks\noriginality, authenticity, and/or peculiarity. Thus, an early\nrepresentative of the view laments that: \nSimilarly, a critical theorist of the 1940s regards Brazilian (and, by\nextension, Latin American) philosophy as lacking originality,\nauthenticity and peculiarity by virtue of its creators’\n“colonial mentality,” a situation that would persist until\nLatin America has won “complete independence—economic,\nand cultural—from the imperialistic powers” (Coutinho\n1943, pp. 187–188). Analogous arguments were offered later by\nSalazar, for whom Latin American philosophy had been, from its\ncolonial beginnings, only “a thought of the upper class or of a\nrefined oligarchical elite, when it has not corresponded openly to\nwaves of foreign economic and political influence. In all these cases\nunderdevelopment and domination are influential” (1969, p. 241).\nEndorsing this line of reasoning, Roig declares that the work of\nFounders such as the Peruvian Alejandro Deustua (1849–1945) is\n“a prime example of the uprooting and the alienation in Latin\nAmerican thought denounced so vehemently by Augusto Salazar\nBondy” (1976, p. 251). \nBut it seems reductionist at best to hold that cultural dependence and\neconomic underdevelopment always determine a philosophy’s\nshortcomings in the features relevant here. A prime counterexample is\nthe ethics of las Casas mentioned above, which is original, authentic,\nand peculiar, though developed under extreme cultural and economic\ndependence (for more on this, see Nuccetelli 2013). Furthermore, the\ncritical theory also faces the following ad hominem objections: \nObjections along these lines (e.g., Gracia 2003 and Hurtado 2007),\ntogether with its vulnerability to counterexamples, make the critical\ntheory implausible. \nThere is, however, another distinctivist theory that might be\nplausible: circumstantialism. Famously expounded by the Mexican\nLeopoldo Zea (1912–2004), its main concern is authenticity.\nPutting aside its contention that an authentic philosophy is bound to\nacquire originality and peculiarity at some point, here is\ncircumstantialism’s main argument: \nConsistent with this argument, the circumstantialist maintains, \nIn this way, the circumstantialist appears to have dissolved the\nalleged conflict between universalism and distinctivism. For, given\nthe above argument, the following claims are all compatible: \nBut the soundness of the cirumstantialist argument hinges on its\npremise 1. This is a very strong claim which entails not only that (a)\nthe context of discovery (or creation) is to some degree apparent in\nany philosophical theory, so that all theories are peculiar in the\nabove sense, but also that (b) such context renders them authentic.\nYet (a) is at the very least controversial, given that it is not\nobvious what is Greek about Aristotle’s theory of the syllogism\nor German about Kant’s categorical imperative (see Nuccetelli\n2003, but compare Monahan 2005). Moreover, (a) may entail peculiarity,\nnot authenticity. For the latter, the circumstantialist needs (b), a\nclaim for which no sound argument is in the offing. In addition, as\nargued in Gracia 2003, there is an irresolvable problem for anyone\nattempting to specify what’s necessary and sufficient for being\na Latin American cultural circumstance, as opposed to the\ncircumstances of other cultures. And no less difficult would be the\ntask of tracing the connections between philosophical theories and\nculture in Latin America, given the bewildering diversity of cultures\nthat have flourished there. \nMiddle-way theories reject both strong universalism and strong\ndistinctivism. If successful, they would avoid the problems facing\neach of those extremes—which, as we saw above, are skepticism\nabout Latin American philosophy (in strong universalism) and\nungrounded assumptions (in strong distinctivism). Here we’ll\nbriefly consider three recent middle-way positions. The first two\nagree that it would be possible to provide examples of sufficient\nconditions for a work to count as Latin American philosophy. The\nposition discussed last undertakes the more ambitious project of\nproposing a set of conditions that are necessary and jointly\nsufficient. \nWhat we may call ‘the ethnic-philosophy account’\n(Gracia’s 2003, 2008) is a neo-Wittgensteinian view holding that\nLatin American philosophy (and more broadly, Hispanic and Latino/a\nphilosophy) is \nOn this account, being the philosophy of the Latin American ethnos is\nsufficient for counting as Latin American philosophy. At the same\ntime, the account holds that it is not possible to provide conditions\nthat are necessary and jointly sufficient for being an\ninstance of this ethnic philosophy. No such conditions are to be had,\neven in the case of ‘Spanish philosophy,’ another ethnic\nphilosophy for which no necessary and sufficient conditions of\ninclusion can be offered, even though it appears identifiable in\nnationality terms—a conclusion suggested by the fact that\n‘Spanish philosophy’ commonly includes figures such as\n“Seneca and Averroes, philosophers who lived long before the\nSpanish nation was constituted as a political reality, and whose\nrelationship to this nation, as we have known it since the sixteenth\ncentury, is less than tenuous” (Gracia 2003, p. 57). \nThis conception of Latin American philosophy as an ethnic philosophy\nis inspired by Wittgenstein’s ‘family resemblances’\ntheory for concepts such as ‘game’ and\n‘funny.’ For example, there is no distinguishing feature\nthat all games have in common in virtue of which they are games.\nRather, there are resemblances between activities we call\n‘games’ that are like the resemblances between members of\na single family. Similarly, there are no distinguishing properties of\nan ethnic philosophy but numerous properties that would each be a\nsufficient condition for belonging to it. This seems to entail that\nthat an ethnic philosophy can be categorized in a variety of ways,\ngiven that its identity hinges at least in part on the adopted\n“selective point of view” with regard to its properties.\nSome cases illustrating the claim come readily to mind. Consider\nPicasso’s works. They may be legitimately categorized as French\nunder one selective point of view, and as Spanish under another. Thus,\nwhether they fall under one or the other is at least in part\ncontingent upon a selective point of view (Gracia 2003, p. 65).\nLikewise, it is possible that certain philosophical works belong to\nLatin American philosophy under one selective point of view, but not\nunder another. Thus, whether Latin American philosophy turns out to be\nthin or robust would then itself be contingent, at least in part, upon\nwhich selective point of view one were to adopt. In short,\nsince the concept ‘Latin American philosophy’ is\nrelevantly analogous to concepts such as ‘game’ or\n‘funny,’ there are no necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor individuating Latin American philosophy; but a variety of\nselective criteria are possible. Each such criterion would be\nlegitimate, provided that it captured a contextually determined,\nsufficient condition for being an instance of Latin American\nphilosophy. Here is how the ethnic-philosophy theorist spells out his\nview on this matter \nOne of the advantages of this account is its flexibility. For it\nentails that Latin American philosophy can accommodate whatever works\nmeet an appropriate contextually determined condition, whether they be\nnonstandard works such as those of las Casas and Guttiérrez, or\nmainstream ones such as those of Newton da Costa or C. Ulises Moulines\n(more on this below). The account is also capable of accommodating the\nfact that some works seem characteristically Latin American while\nothers have a universal import. Furthermore, it allows one to\nclassify, e.g., Kant’s categorical imperative as German\nphilosophy in a context where an author’s place of origin is\nrelevant, and as universal deontology in a context where birthplace is\nnot relevant. \nThe main challenge for this view is how to avoid an anything-goes form\nof metaphilosophical relativism. Gracia (2003, p. 66) has sought to\neliminate this threat by emphasizing that it is not only a\ncontextually determined, selective point of view that matters for\nindividuating ethnic philosophies. Reality also has a role, possibly\nin connection with history, which Gracia invokes to explain the nature\nof “philosophical texts.” On his view, these are\n“historical entities, the product of historical beings in\nparticular times and places whose identities are linked to the context\nin which they were produced and which, for that reason, depend on\nthem” (2003, p. 65). Metaphilosophical relativists can, however,\nwelcome this appeal to history, though they would further insist that\nit is not only philosophical texts but also the truth of philosophical\ntheories that’s similarly contingent upon historical context. In\nfact, more than a mere logical possibility, relativism of this sort is\nby now a strong twentieth century tradition in the philosophy of\nscience (see, e.g., Kuhn 1962, especially chapter 10). \nAlso a middle way between universalism and distinctivism is\nMoulines’s 2010 position. Like Gracia’s account, it\nvindicates only sufficient conditions for being an instance of Latin\nAmerican philosophy. But unlike Gracia’s account,\nMoulines’s does not argue against the possibility of conditions\nthat are both necessary and jointly sufficient. His positive proposal\nconsists of four sufficient conditions that, on his view, a number of\nrecent works meet—namely, they are universal in the sense that\nthey use concepts and provide arguments that are intended to be\nuniversally valid; (2) they have been developed by Latin American\nauthors; (3) they have been originally devised, at least partially, in\nsome Latin American countries; and (4) they have found widespread\ninterest both in and outside Latin America. \nSatisfying (1) through (4) is considered sufficient for a work to be\n“an instantiation of ‘Latin American\nphilosophy’” (Moulines 2010, p. 460). Moulines’s\nsample of such instances includes several brands of theories and/or\nmethods developed by contemporary Latin American philosophers such as\nparaconsistent logic (by Brazilian Newton da Costa and his\ncollaborators), formal deontic logic (by Argentinean Carlos\nAlchourrón and Eugenio Bulygin), belief revision (in part by\nAlchourrón), scientific realism (by Argentinean Mario Bunge), a\nhistorical approach to the foundations of physics (by Chilean Roberto\nTorreti), and structuralist theory of science (by Venezuelan Moulines\nand his collaborators). \nAccording to Moulines, conditions (1) through (4) express an\nunderstanding of Latin American philosophy that is\n“‘universalist’ as much as\n‘distinctivist’” (2010, p. 460). A quick look at\nthem suggests that (1) is relevant to universalism, (2) and (3) to\ndistinctivism, and (4) to neither because it is neutral, though it\nbears on the external invisibility problem mentioned above. But note\nthat(2) and (3) are distinctivist only in terms of\n‘peculiarity’—which, as pointed out earlier, is the\ncheapest of the distinctive properties at issue on this debate. \nThe last mid-way position to be considered here was developed in\nNuccetelli 2002 and 2009. It proposes a set of conditions that are\ntaken to be both necessary and jointly sufficient for being an\ninstance of a characteristically Latin American\nphilosophy—namely, that any qualifying work must \nAny work satisfying (1) and (2) would count as characteristically\nLatin American in Nuccetelli’s sense. She further contends that\nthere is a robust body of philosophical work in Latin America that\nsatisfies these conditions. It is mostly devoted to issues of moral,\nsocial, and political philosophy and includes the works of both,\nnon-academic and academic philosophers. Thus construed, Latin American\nphilosophy comes out as a branch of applied philosophy and its\nexistence is consistent with that of universal philosophy—which\nis grounded in a variety of traditions of Western philosophy and\ndevoted to problems that have universal import such as knowledge and\nskepticism, the nature of consciousness, moral reasoning, and the\nexistence and attributes of God. A Latin American philosopher may\ncultivate either universal philosophy or some branch of applied\nphilosophy, including Latin American philosophy. From the time of the\nFounders to the present, there has been a long list of those who in\nfact did both. \nA final note on the issue of the name: Latin American philosophers\nhave expressed a number of different preferences about what to call\nthe field. The standard name preferred here has been ‘Latin\nAmerican philosophy.’ But there are other options, depending on\nwhether ‘thought’ takes the place of\n‘philosophy,’ and/or ‘Iberoamerican,’\n‘Hispanic,’ ‘Hispanic-American’ or\n‘Latino/a’ (among other qualifiers) takes the place of\n‘Latin American.’ Keeping in mind that not all\nreplacements would be semantically equivalent (a topic revisited\nlater), note that the rationale for using ‘thought’ in\nlieu of ‘philosophy’ is to do justice to the breadth of\nphilosophical developments in Latin America—which, as\nwe’ve seen, includes a vast corpus of non-standard, non-academic\nphilosophical works. There is no common rationale for substituting any\nof the above qualifiers for ‘Latin American.’ But each\nproposed qualifier (including ‘Latin American’) inherits a\nproblem faced by the proper name from which it derives. The problem\nmay be semantic or pragmatic, where \nAs an illustration, let’s consider the term preferred here,\n‘Latin American philosophy.’ Its qualifier derives from\n‘Latin America,’ which appears to suffer from both types\nof problem. With few exceptions (e.g., Oliver 1998), those who have\nrecently reflected on this term go beyond geography and politics to\nconsider also factors such as culture and history in order to\ndetermine this term’s meaning and reference. But it has proved\ndifficult to find criteria that avoid semantic problems such as \nJorge Gracia (2011a, p. 8) offers a way around these problems by\ntaking ‘Latin America’ to refer to “everything in\nthe Americas that is not American (U.S.) or Canadian.” This\nextensional, negative criterion gets things right provided it assumes\na cultural understanding of ‘American (U.S.)’ and\n‘Canadian.’ Without that assumption, the criterion would\nbe both too narrow and too broad, for it would exclude Puerto Rico,\nwhich is politically part of the U.S., and include St. Pierre and\nMiquelon, which are French islands off the coast of Canada. But Gracia\n(2011a, p. 8) seems to have in mind the relevant cultural\nunderstanding of the term, because he notes that “those parts of\nthe Caribbean and South America that were French, Dutch, or English\ncolonies, such as Haiti and Jamaica” are not part of Latin\nAmerica (i.e., culturally understood).  \nOn the other hand, Eduardo Rabossi (2003) explicitly provides a set of\nintensional criteria, which he appears to consider necessary and\nsufficient for falling under the reference of ‘Latin\nAmerica.’ According to them, the term denotes certain\n“states” of North, Central, and South America by virtue of\ntheir sharing “a common political origin (Spanish/Portuguese\nconquest), a similar linguistic heritage (Spanish/Portuguese), a\ndominant religion (Catholicism), and comparable predicaments vis\nà vis local, regional, and international affairs”\n(Rabossi 2003, p. 507). Rabossi’s criteria, which are more\nrestrictive, avoid being too broad, but face the problem of being too\nnarrow, which makes them unsatisfactory. \nGuillermo Hurtado’s (2010) reflection on the adequacy of the\nqualifier ‘Latin American’ illustrates the pragmatic\nproblem mentioned above. First, Hurtado too takes ‘Latin\nAmerica’ to denote a culturally specific region of the Americas,\none individuated by appeal to language: viz., being a region of the\nAmericas that mostly speaks Spanish, Portuguese or French. Perhaps\naware of the problem of being too broad, Hurtado attempts to avoid it\nby excluding Quebec from the designation of ‘Latin\nAmerica’ on the seemingly ad hoc ground that the region\nis surrounded by mostly ‘Anglo-Saxon’ Canada. In any case,\nhis account of ‘Latin American’ and ‘the Latin\nAmerican’ appears to point to a pragmatic problem arising from\nsome facts about those terms’ introduction into public\ndiscourse. According to Hurtado, there is historical evidence that\nthey were introduced into public discourse in the late nineteenth\ncentury by the French, who did so in order to advance their national\ninterest in dealing with the Latin and Catholic nations of the\nAmericas (as opposed to the Protestant and ‘Anglo-Saxon’\nnations). Once these terms had caught on in thought and language,\ntheir role in discourse was unaffected by the defeat of the French in\nthe region, except for the fact that ‘Latin America’ came\ninstead to be just “an ideal of union among the nations\nthat compose it” (Hurtado 2010, p. 11, my translation and\nemphasis). At the end of the day, however, Hurtado continues to use\nthese terms without explaining why we should do so, given that,\naccording to his own story, they were introduced for colonialist\npurposes—and therefore face the pragmatic\n problem.[3]\n In addition, given this account, it would seem that those terms now\nrefer to nothing objective at all. \nBe that as it may, let’s now consider some of the other options.\n‘Iberoamerican’ and ‘Hispanic American’ are\nthe closest relatives of ‘Latin American.’ Neither of\nthese alternatives is problem free, since they inherit the pragmatic\nproblem facing the nouns from whence they derive, ‘Iberia’\nand ‘Hispania.’ Each of these ancient proper names\ndesignates the European peninsula today divided into Spain and\nPortugal. Thus, taken literally, each has connotations unacceptable to\nthe descendants of the victims of these countries’ colonial\npolicies in the Americas. \nOn the other hand, ‘Hispanic philosophy’ and\n‘Latino/a philosophy’ are more recent terms whose semantic\nfeatures are not yet fully settled by usage. Roughly, ‘Hispanic\nphilosophy’ may include Iberian philosophy too (Gracia 2000),\nwhile ‘Latino/a philosophy’ is the philosophy of or about\nthe descendants of Latin Americans abroad, especially in the United\nStates (Gracia 2011b). As noted above in the cases of\n‘Iberoamerican’ and ‘Hispanic American,’ both\n‘Hispanic’ and ‘Latino/a’ also appear to have\ninherited the pragmatic problem for the proper nouns from which each\nderives (it should now be obvious to the reader what those problems\nare). \nBut it may be that no such pragmatic problem matters after all for\njustifying the current use of ‘Latin American’ or some of\nthe alternative terms. That would be so if the reference of the proper\nname from which any such term derives is direct, in the sense that it\nis not mediated by the term’s descriptive\n meaning.[4]\n On this account, the justification for using the term needs only\nappeal to linguistic convention.","contact.mail":"snuccetelli@stcloudstate.edu","contact.domain":"stcloudstate.edu"}]
