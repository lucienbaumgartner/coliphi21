The\ndynamics of canon formation, however, resulted in her philosophical\nwork being largely ignored until the\n 1990s.[1]\n Addams is best known for her pioneering work in the social\nsettlement movement—the radical arm of the progressive movement\nwhose adherents so embraced the ideals of progressivism that they\nchose to live as neighbors in oppressed communities to learn from and\nhelp the marginalized members of society. Although her activism and\naccomplishments were widely lauded by her contemporaries,\nAddams’ work was mapped onto conventional gender understandings:\nmale philosophers such as John Dewey, William James, and George\nHerbert Mead were regarded as providing original progressive thought\nwhile Addams was seen as brilliantly administering their\ntheories. Recent work by feminist philosophers and historians has\nrevealed that Addams was far more than a competent technician. Her\ndozen published books and over 500 articles display a robust\nintellectual interplay between experience and reflection in the\nAmerican pragmatist tradition. The near half-century that she lived\nand worked as the leader of the Chicago social settlement, Hull House,\ngave her an opportunity to bring her commitment to social improvement,\nfeminism, diversity, and peace to direct action. These experiences\nprovided the foundation for an engaging philosophical\nperspective. Addams viewed her settlement work as a grand\nepistemological endeavor but in the process she also never forgot the\nhumanity of her neighbors.  Addams was indeed a public\nphilosopher—one who was not afraid to get her hands dirty.\n\n\n\nAddams’ philosophy combined feminist sensibilities with an\nunwavering commitment to social improvement through cooperative\nefforts. Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and\npacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic\nrather than ideological. Addams’ commitment to social cohesion\nand cooperation prompted her to eschew what she perceived as divisive\ndistinctions. Active democratic social progress was so essential to\nAddams that she did not want to alienate any group of people from the\nconversation or from the participation necessary for effective\ninclusive deliberation. Addams carefully varied her rhetorical\napproach to engage a variety of constituencies, which makes the\nidentification of her social philosophy challenging. Accordingly,\nAddams did not intend to engage in philosophical narratives removed\nfrom social improvement, but neither did she intend to pursue social\nactivism without theorizing about the wider implications of her\nwork. In this respect, through her integration of theory and action,\nAddams carried pragmatism to its logical conclusion, developing an\napplied philosophy immersed in social action. Thus Addams’\nwriting is replete with examples from her Hull House experience\naddressing atypical topics for philosophic discourse such as garbage\ncollection, immigrant folk stories, and prostitution. For those\nsteeped in traditional philosophy, it is easy to dismiss Addams’\nwritings as non-philosophical if the full sweep of her projects and\nsubsequent analysis is not considered.  For those who persevere,\nAddams offers a rich social and political philosophy built on respect\nand understanding that is refreshing in its faith in the potential for\ncollective progress.\n\n\n\nRecovering Jane Addams as a philosopher requires appreciating the\ndynamic between theory and action that is reflected in her writing.  A\nwellspring of nascent feminist philosophical insight can be found in\nAddams’ work. Addams’ ethical philosophy was guided by the\nnotion of sympathetic knowledge that she described as “the only\nway of approach to any human problem” (NCA 7). Sympathetic\nknowledge is a mingling of epistemology and ethics: knowing one\nanother better reinforces the common connection of people such that\nthe potential for caring and empathetic moral actions\nincreases. Addams not only theorized about this idea, but she lived\nit. Sympathetic knowledge underwrote Addams’ approach to the\ndiversity that she confronted in the immigrant neighborhood\nsurrounding Hull House and allowed her to develop a precursor to\ncontemporary feminist standpoint epistemology. The diversity and\noppression in the neighborhood surrounding Hull House was staggering\n(HHM). Addams’ leadership among the American pragmatists in\nunderstanding the poor and oppressed resulted in a more radical form\nof pragmatism than that of Dewey and James, a social philosophy imbued\nwith a class and gender consciousness. Ultimately, Addams exemplifies\nand theorizes about what today is described as care\nethics. Addams’ version of care ethics does not privatize caring\nrelationships in metaphors of parent-child relationships, but\nassertively extends the notion to the community and society. Jane\nAddams was an original feminist thinker.\n\n\n\nAddams’ philosophical work is deeply connected to her\nextraordinary life. As witnessed by the many biographical\naccounts of Addams compared to the relatively few comprehensive\nconsiderations of her philosophy, her personal exploits often overshadow her\nintellectual contributions. Nevertheless, as an American\npragmatist, Addams valorized experience making it appropriate to\nrecount, at least briefly, her life story. \n\nLaura Jane Addams was born in Cedarville, Illinois on September 6,\n1860. She grew up in the shadow of the Civil War and during a time\nwhen Darwin’s Origin of the Species achieved widespread\ninfluence. Her childhood reflected the material advantage of being the\ndaughter of a politician and successful mill owner, John Addams. When\nJane was two years old, her mother, Mary, died giving birth to her ninth\nchild. Subsequently, the precocious Addams doted upon her father and\nin return benefited emotionally and intellectually from his\nattention. Although John Addams was no advocate of feminism, he did\ndesire higher education for his daughter and sent her to the\nall-women’s institution, Rockford Seminary (renamed later,\nRockford College) in Rockford, Illinois. Addams became part of a\ngeneration of women that were among the first in their family to\nattend college. At Rockford, she experienced the empowerment of living\nin a women-centered environment and she blossomed as an intellectual\nand as a social leader.  Her classmates and teachers acknowledged this\nleadership.  Ultimately, Addams spearheaded an effort to bring\nbaccalaureate degrees to the school, and, after serving as class\nvaledictorian, received the first one. \n\nLike those of many women of her time, Addams’ prospects after college\nwere limited. She made a failed attempt at medical school and then\nslipped into a nearly decade-long malaise over the direction of her life. The\nenergy and spirit of her undergraduate college experience did not translate into any\nclear career path, given that she had rejected both marriage and the\nreligious life. Addams’ malaise was somewhat analogous to the\nunidentified illness that her later acquaintance, Charlotte Perkins\nGilman (as described in The Yellow Wallpaper) suffered. As a\nmember of the privileged class, her soul searching included a trek to\nEurope, which Addams made twice during this period. On the second trip\nshe visited Toynbee Hall, a pioneering Christian settlement house in London,\nwhich was to inspire her in a direction that propelled her toward\ninternational prominence (TYH 53). \n\nToynbee Hall was a community of young men committed to helping the\npoor of London by living among them. After visiting Toynbee Hall,\nAddams was rejuvenated by the idea of a scheme to replicate the\nsettlement in the United States. She enlisted a college friend, Ellen\nGates Starr in the plan. However, to identify their vague idea as a\n“plan” is a bit of hyperbole. There was very little by way\nof specific directions for what the settlement would be other than a\ngood neighbor to oppressed peoples. A suitable location in a\ndevastatingly poor Chicago immigrant neighborhood was found and on\nSeptember 18, 1889, Hull House opened its doors. Working amidst one of\nthe greatest influxes of immigrants the United States has ever known,\nHull House quickly became an incubator for new social programs.\nWithout any formal ideological or political constraints, the\nsettlement workers responded to the needs of the neighborhood by\nstarting project after project.  The list of projects started at Hull\nHouse is astounding, including the first little theatre and juvenile\ncourt in the United States and the first playground, gymnasium, public\nswimming pool and public kitchen in Chicago.  The work of Hull House\nresidents would result in numerous labor union organizations, a labor\nmuseum, tenement codes, factory laws, child labor laws, adult\neducation courses, cultural exchange groups, and the collection of\nneighborhood demographic data.  Hull House was truly a dynamo of\nprogressive initiatives, all of which Addams oversaw.   \n\nThe reputation of the settlement rapidly grew and women, mostly\ncollege educated, from all over the country, came to live and work at\nHull House. Although Hull House was co-educational, it was clearly a\nwoman-identified space. There were male residents at Hull House, some\nof whom later became prominent leaders, however the policies,\nprojects, decision-making, and methodologies of the Hull House\ncommunity were gynocentric—foregrounding women’s experience,\nanalysis, and concerns. Furthermore, although a few of the residents\nwere married, most were single and some were in committed\nrelationships with other women. Given the drastic shifts in sexual\nmores in the twentienth century, the contemporary understanding of\nwhat it means to be lesbian cannot straightforwardly be mapped onto\nthe late and post Victorian eras, but it can be argued that Hull House\nwas lesbian-friendly space. Addams set the tone for this\nidentification with her own long-term intimate relationships with women, first\nwith Starr and then Mary Rozet Smith (Brown, 2004). \n\nFrom the outset of its operation, Addams theorized about the nature\nand function of Hull House. The language she used reflected her\nphilosophical approach. For example, in one published essay, Addams\ndescribes the application and reorganization of knowledge as the\nfundamental problem of modern life and then claims that settlements\nare like applied universities: “The ideal and developed\nsettlement would attempt to test the value of human knowledge by\naction, and realization, quite as the complete and ideal university\nwould concern itself with the discovery of knowledge in all\nbranches” (FSS 187). This kind of reflective analysis and wider\nthematization of her work and the work of the social settlement was a\nhallmark of Addams’ writing.  Because of her insightful\nreflections on the Hull House community, Addams became a popular\nauthor and sought-after public speaker. Eventually, she extended her\ncosmopolitan analysis to issues of race, education, and world\npeace. For Addams, local experiences were always a springboard for\npolitical theorizing. \n\nAddams became one of the most respected and recognized\nindividuals in the nation. She played a key role in numerous\nprogressive campaigns. Addams was a founding figure in the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil\nLiberties Union, and the Women’s International League for Peace and\nFreedom. Her popularity was such that when Theodore Roosevelt sought\nthe presidential nomination of the Progressive Party in 1912, he asked\nJane Addams to second the nomination, the first time a woman had\nparticipated in such an act. There was a gendered dimension to this\npopularity however. Addams had challenged the borders of the public\nand private spheres through her work at Hull House, but her forays\ninto masculine domains were masked by the “social\nhousekeeping” characterization of the settlement activism. After\nWorld War I broke out in Europe, her outspoken pacifism and refusal to\nendorse the war or the U.S. entry into it, was more gender role\ntransgression than the public could tolerate from a woman. Addams’\npopularity fell and she became the victim of vicious gender-specific\ncriticism.  Biographer Allen Davis reports that one writer indicated that what\nAddams needed to disabuse her of her pacifism was “a strong,\nforceful husband who would lift the burden of fate from her shoulders\nand get her intensely interested in fancy work and other things dear\nto the heart of women who have homes and plenty of time on their\nhands” (240). A reporter for the Los Angeles Times\nquipped,  \n\nHer new role as social outcast and critic gave an opportunity for the\npublic philosopher in Addams to reflect on the nature of citizenship\nand patriotism in her many books and articles—some of which had\ndifficulty getting into print because she was perceived as being\nanti-American. Although she had written on peace early in her public\ncareer (NIP), from 1914 through the end of her life, Addams’\npublications became decidedly more focused on issues of peace and war,\nincluding two books exclusively dedicated to the topic (WH, PBT) and\nseveral books with sections devoted to the nature and politics of war\n(LRW, STY, MFJ).  Although initially criticized, Addams’ pacifist\ntenacity was ultimately recognized with the Nobel Peace Price (1931). In the last\nyears of her life, she spent less time at Hull House and more time\nworking for world peace and an end to racism. Addams died of cancer on\nMay 21, 1935, leaving a tremendous intellectual legacy that has yet to\nbe fully explored. \n\nAddams was well read and could claim numerous and varied\ninfluences. However, Addams was no one’s protégé. Addams\npicked and chose intellectual resources that resonated with her notion\nof sympathetic knowledge in the process of bringing about social progress. A few\nsignificant influences are recounted here. Addams read Thomas\nCarlyle’s (1795–1881) work while she was attending Rockford\nSeminary. Carlyle’s social morality held a particular appeal to\nAddams. He believed that the universe was ultimately good and moral\nand led by a divine will that worked through society’s heroes and\nleaders.  Carlyle wrote biographies of social saviors that came in the\nform of poets, kings, prophets, and intellectuals, mixing in\ncommentary that explicated his moral philosophy. However, Carlyle’s\nheroes reflect the evolution of society, as different contexts require\ndifferent leadership. These heroes are able to recognize the social\ndynamics at work and use them for the benefit of others.  Carlyle’s\nheroes evolved over time. For Carlyle, a duty extends to all to\nfind themselves or realize their place in the world and what their\nwork on behalf of society should be. Because of his emphasis on\npowerful individuals, Carlyle was not particularly fond of\ndemocracy. Although Addams shed Carlyle’s notion of individualistic\nheroism and his disdain for democracy, she retained the\nvalorization of moral action throughout her career.  Furthermore,\nCarlyle’s morality was grounded in social relations: to be moral is to\nbe in right relation with God and others. A precursor to Addams’\nnotion of sympathetic knowledge can be found in Carlyle’s relational\nethics. \n\nAddams was also influenced by John Ruskin (1819–1900) who\ntheorized that art and culture reflected the moral health of\nsociety. Although Ruskin maintained a certain elitism in his view that\ngreat people produced great art, he also saw such great cultural works\nas a manifestation of the well-being of society as a whole. The plight\nof the oppressed was tied to a sense of the aesthetic. Certainly,\nAddams’ valorization of art and culture as exhibited in the\nappearance and activities of Hull House resonates with Ruskin’s\naesthetics. For Addams, “Social Life and art have always seemed\nto go best at Hull House” (STY 354).  Addams viewed art and\ncultural activities as reinforcing essential human bonds (DSE\n29). Ruskin also influenced Arnold Toynbee and other future settlement\nworkers by identifying the problems in large industrial cities and\ncalling for reforms foreshadowing the safety nets typical of later\nwelfare states. Ruskin valued labor as a noble means of\nself-actualization. This became a crucial concept for Addams as she\nsought meaningful labor for those in the Hull House neighborhood. For\nexample, Addams expresses sympathy for laborers who skipped work or\ncame in late for work because “all human interest has been\nextracted from it” (SYC 129). Although Addams valued\nRuskin’s moral imagination, concept of labor, and ideas about\ntransforming the city through infusing culture, she rejected his\nromanticization of the preindustrial past. With a strong belief in\nsocial progress, Addams did not desire a return to a previous era. For\nAddams, society should grow and adapt to its conditions even in regard\nto moral philosophy. \n\nLeo Tolstoy (1828–1910) was another type of hero to Addams.\nUnlike Carlyle, Tolstoy did not valorize individuals standing out from\nthe crowd as exemplary moral paragons who wield socially ordained\npositions of power. He valued solidarity with the common\nlaborer. Addams’ wide intellectual curiosity made such extremes\nin influences possible. Addams read Tolstoy’s works from the time that\nshe graduated from college until the last years of her life and she\noften praised his writing in articles and book reviews. Tolstoy’s\nemphasis on working for and with the oppressed, while simultaneously\nwriting novels and essays that influenced a wider audience, resonated\nwith Addams’ work and writings. However, Tolstoy\nwas a moral idealist. He left everything behind to take up the plow\nand work as a common farm laborer. Addams was moved by Tolstoy’s\naccount and—typical of her self-critical, thoughtful\napproach--she questioned her leadership role in the social settlement,\nbut only for a short time.  \n\nMotivated by Tolstoy’s troubling moral challenge to work in solidarity\nwith the common laborer, Addams sought him out while she was on\nvacation (and recovering from typhoid) in Europe in 1896. The meeting\nmade a lasting impression on Addams (TYH 191–195).  Tolstoy came in\nfrom working the fields to be introduced to Addams and her partner\nMary Rozet Smith. The meeting began with Tolstoy questioning Addams’\nfashion choice because the sleeves of her arms, consistent with the\nstyle of the time, had “enough stuff on one arm to make a frock\nfor the girl” (TYH 192). Tolstoy was concerned that the\ntrappings of material wealth alienated Addams from those she was\nworking with. This criticism continued when Tolstoy learned that part\nof Hull House’s funding came from Addams’ estate that included a\nworking farm: “So you are an absentee landlord? Do you think you\nwill help the people more by adding yourself to the crowded city than\nyou would by tilling your own soil?” (TYH 192) Addams was\nhumbled by the remarks and on her return to Hull House was determined\nto take up more direct labor by working in the new Hull House\nbakery. However, reality demonstrated how Tolstoy’s idealism was\nincompatible with her work in social settlements: “The half\ndozen people invariably waiting to see me after breakfast, the piles\nof letters to be opened and answered, the demand of actual and\npressing human wants—were these all to be pushed aside and asked\nto wait while I saved my soul by two hours’ work at baking\nbread?” (TYH 197) Theoretically, the shared experience of\ncommon labor would break down class\ndistinctions. Addams had experienced such camaraderie at Hull House,\nand she never stopped appreciating Tolstoy’s social\ncriticism. However, she saw the value of intelligent\nleadership. Someone had to organize the clubs, arrange for\nphilanthropic support, and chair the meetings.  To a certain extent,\nAddams found Tolstoy’s labor demand to be self-indulgent: if she\nengaged in the labor of the poor exclusively, she might alleviate her\nupper class guilt but she would no longer be working holistically\ntoward changing the structure of society.  Addams’ own philosophy of\ncivic activism valued engagement through ongoing presence and\nlistening. Indeed, Hull House had a very flat and responsive organization\nstructure. Nevertheless, Tolstoy’s absolutist moral demands failed to\ntake into account context—a hallmark of Addams’ approach. \n\nAddams also found Tolstoy’s pacifism inspiring. She admired the\nmanner in which Tolstoy sympathized with revolutionaries in the 1870s\nbut did not compromise his moral convictions because of these\nsympathies. Tolstoy offered a doctrine of non-resistance that sought\nto substitute moral energy for physical force. Addams once again did\nnot accept Tolstoy’s pacifist ideas uncritically. For example, she\nquestioned the clarity of the categories (moral energy versus physical\nforce) that Tolstoy created in his doctrine of non-resistance (TYH\n195). Addams also questioned whether Tolstoy reduced social issues too\nsimplistically, albeit eloquently.  Despite her less than congenial\nmeeting with him, Addams cited Tolstoy as a positive moral\nexample throughout her life. However, like all of her influences,\nTolstoy’s philosophy could not be accepted uncritically. Addams had to\nadapt and infuse her own insight to make it work for the society of\nwhich she was a part.  \n\nAs previously mentioned, Toynbee Hall was the inspiration for\nHull House and Canon Barnett (1844–1913), who served as\n“warden” of the settlement for over twenty years, was the\ninspirational force. Prior to his service at Toynbee Hall, Barnett\nworked as Vicar of St. Judes, Whitechapel where he instituted a number\nof improvements to the slums surrounding the Church, including building\neducational and recreational programs. It was St. Judes that students\nfrom Oxford would visit, working to help improve conditions for\nresidents of the surrounding community, all the while engaging in\ndiscussions about how to institute social reforms.  One of those\nstudents was Andrew Toynbee. \n\nBarnett describes a threefold rationale for the development and growth\nof settlements: First, a general distrust that government-sponsored\ninstitutions could care for the poor. In particular, government and\nprivate philanthropy appeared to be failing the masses. The second\nreason Barnett gives for the rise of settlements is the need for\ninformation. Barnett believed there was widespread curiosity regarding\noppression that he could satisfy with documented observations\nregarding the circumstances of the poor. Finally, Barnett notes a\ngroundswell of fellowship not driven by traditional “Charities\nand Missions” but by a fundamental humanitarianism. Settlements\nprovided an outlet for these fellow feelings.  \n\nAddams was familiar with Barnett’s writings and referred to them on\nmany occasions. For example, when Addams wrote “The Function of\nthe Social Settlement,” Barnett’s philosophy played a prominent\nrole. She agrees with him that settlements should not be missions\nbecause if they become too ideological, they will fail to be\nresponsive to their neighbors (FSS 344–345). However, despite\nacknowledging that the term “settlement” was borrowed from\nLondon, she finds subtle differences between the philosophies of\nToynbee Hall and Hull House: “The American Settlement, perhaps\nhas not so much a sense of duty of the privileged toward the\nunprivileged of the ‘haves’ to the ‘have\nnots,’ to borrow Canon Barnett’s phrase, as a desire to equalize\nthrough social effort those results which superior opportunity may\nhave given the possessor” (FSS 322–323). Addams is very\nsensitive about a sense of superiority in settlement work. She always\neschewed the notion that she was a charitable “lady\nbountiful.” She wanted to learn about others so that she could\ndevelop the proper sympathies and strategies for\nassisting—sympathetic knowledge. For Addams, Hull House always\ncombined epistemological concerns with moral ones.  \n\nWhen Addams’ philosophy is considered, if at all, it is usually\nassociated with the work of John Dewey (1859–1952). This\nassociation is appropriate given their friendship and mutual\ninterests; however her intellectual deference to Dewey is often\noverstated.  Dewey is considered one of the greatest American\nphilosophers and his name, along with William James, Charles Sanders\nPeirce, and Josiah Royce form the traditional list of founding fathers\nof what is labeled American Pragmatism. His work appealed to Addams\nbecause they shared many of the same commitments including the value\nof a robust democracy as well as the importance of education that\nengaged the student’s experience. Addams and Dewey were intellectual\nsoul mates from the moment they met in 1892. Dewey visited Hull House\nshortly after it opened and before he moved to Chicago to teach at the\nUniversity of Chicago. Following the meeting, Dewey expressed to\nAddams an appreciation for Hull House’s work and he would become a\nfrequent visitor. There was much intellectual cross-fertilization\nbetween Hull House and the University of Chicago and vice\nversa.  Historian Rosalind Rosenberg describes Addams as a de\nfacto adjunct professor at the University of Chicago. Mary Jo\nDeegan documents that over the course of a decade Addams taught a\nnumber of college courses through the Extension Division of the\nUniversity of Chicago. In addition, she refused offers to join the\nundergraduate and graduate faculty (Deegan, 1988). Furthermore, Dewey\nassigned Addams’ books in his courses. Addams and Dewey worked\ntogether personally and politically. When Hull House incorporated,\nDewey became one of the board members. He often lectured to the Plato\nClub, Hull House’s philosophy group.  Dewey would dedicate his book\nLiberalism and Social Action to Addams. Dewey named one of\nhis daughters in her honor and Addams wrote the eulogy for Dewey’s son\nGordon (EBP). \n\nAlthough Dewey and Addams would gain celebrity status in their lifetime,\ntheir fame and legacies are characterized much differently. Dewey was\nthe great intellectual—a thinker—and Addams was the\nactivist—a doer. As contemporaries, they represent classic\narchetypes of gender: the male as mind generating theory and the woman\nas body experiencing and caring. However, there is much evidence that\nsuch a characterization is inaccurate. Both John Dewey and his\ndaughter, Jane, credit Jane Addams with developing many of his\nimportant ideas including his view on education, democracy, and\nultimately philosophy itself (Schlipp, 1951). Despite the lack of\nattribution in Dewey’s written work, many scholars document\nAddams’ significant influence (Davis, 1973; Deegan, 1988;\nFarrell, 1967; Lasch, 1965; Linn, 2000; Seigfried, 1996) \n\nOvershadowed by Addams’ relationship with the celebrity philosopher,\nDewey, was her strong tie to George Herbert Mead (1863–1931) who is\nconsidered the father of “symbolic interactionism,” an\napproach to social inquiry that emphasizes how symbols create meaning\nin society. Mead’s work on development through play and education\ninfluenced Addams but, as with Dewey, the influence was mutual. Addams\nmaintained a long-term close personal relationship with Mead and his\nwife, Helen Castle Mead. They often dined together and visited one\nanother’s family. Like Addams’, Mead’s intellectual legacy is\nnot altogether settled. His works have been recognized as significant\nby sociologists but many philosophers have overlooked him. \n\nMead and Addams worked on a number of projects together including\npro-labor speeches, peace advocacy and the Progressive Party.  When\nAddams was publicly attacked for not supporting the U.S. entry into\nWorld War I, Mead defended her even through he did not agree with her\nposition.  Like Dewey, Mead was a frequent lecturer at\nHull House. Also, like Dewey, Mead could not help but be impressed\nwith Addams’ intellect. In 1916, Mead advocated awarding Addams an\nhonorary doctorate from the University of Chicago. The faculty\nsupported the award but the administration overturned the decision\n(eventually making the award in 1931). \n\nAddams also maintained a friendship with William James (1842–1910),\nwhose work she cites on many occasions. James was a pragmatist whose\nvision of urban improvement would have been shared by Addams.  James\nand Addams both valued experience and among the\n“professional” pragmatists his style of writing is closest\nto Addams’ in terms of its readability and use of tangible\nexamples. \n\nAddams clearly influenced and was influenced by the Chicago\nSchool. Although she was often frustrated with the abstract trajectory\nof the university, Addams embraced reflective analysis.  Through her\nHull House experience Addams took many opportunities to theorize about\nthe interchange between theory and practice. For a time, American\nphilosophy, sociology, and social work existed in a symbiotic\nharmony—each not clearly differentiated from the other but\nbenefiting from the interchange. Unfortunately, since the early\n20th century when Mead, Dewey, and Addams were together in\nChicago, the intellectual genealogy of American philosophy, sociology\nand social work has more drastically diverged to a point where\ncrossover is less likely and perhaps less welcome. Lost in the\ncompartmentalization of these disciplines is how Jane Addams played a\nrole in each. \n\nIn addition to the Romantics (Carlyle and Ruskin), the social\nvisionaries (Barnett and Tolstoy), and the pragmatists (Dewey and\nMead) Addams was influenced by the great collection of feminist minds\nwho came to work at the social settlement. Hull House has been\ndescribed in many different ways, reflecting the complexity and\nmultiplicity of its functions.  Perhaps an overlooked descriptor is as\na pragmatist feminist “think tank.” Although the\n“Metaphysical Club” has taken on something of a mythical\nstatus among some in American philosophical circles (Menand, 2001),\nthe intellectual, social, and political impact of the Hull House\nresidents dwarfs that of the Cambridge intellectuals. Hull House\nresidents dined, slept, did domestic chores, and engaged in social\nactivism together. They also discussed and debated ethics, political\ntheory, feminism, and culture while immersed in their tasks and\nstimulated by the many speakers and visitors to Hull House. The\nprolonged contact, shared gender oppression, and common mission made\nfor a unique intellectual collective that not only fostered action but\nalso theory.  \n\nOstensibly, Hull House was the first co-educational settlement. Addams\nrecognized the need for male residents so that men in the neighborhood\ncould better relate to Hull House endeavors. However, it was quite\nclear to visitors and residents that Hull House was a woman’s\nspace. Hull House boasted some of the great minds and agents of change\nof the era. Alice Hamilton (1869–1970), a physician who trained\nin Germany and the U.S. and who is credited with founding the field of\nindustrial medicine, lived at Hull House for 22 years. She went on to\nteach at Harvard where she became a nationally recognized social\nreformer and peace activist. Julia Lathrop (1858–1932) was a\nVassar graduate who, in 1912, after residing at Hull House for 22\nyears, became the first woman to head a federal agency, the Children’s\nBureau, which, in terms of conduct, she modeled after\nHull House. Rachel Yarros (1869–1946), a twenty-year resident at\nHull House, was also a physician who taught at the University of\nIllinois. The university created a position for Yarros in recognition\nof her tremendous contribution to social hygiene and sex\neducation. Author and feminist theorist, Charlotte Perkins Gilman\n(1860–1935), was a resident for a short period of time. Gilman\nthought highly of Addams but had no stomach for settlement existence\namongst the oppressed. However, Gilman’s groundbreaking work on gender\nand economics likely influenced Addams. Sophonisba Breckinridge\n(1866–1948) graduated from Wellesley and went on to obtain both\na Ph.D. in political science and a J.D. from the University of\nChicago. Her greatest contribution was in the area of social work\neducation. Edith Abbott (1876–1957) and her sister Grace Abbott\n(1878–1939) joined Hull-House about the time as Breckinridge\n(1907). Edith Abbott would obtain a Ph.D. in Political Economy from\nthe University of Chicago while Grace Abbott earned a Ph.D. from Grand\nIsland College in Nebraska. Edith would have an academic career at the\nUniversity of Chicago prior to her appointment as Chief of the\nChildren’s Bureau after Julia Lathrop’s departure. Mary Kenney\n(1864–1943) became an important labor organizer for Samuel\nGompers’ American Federation of Labor and influenced Addams’\nsensitivity to the plight of organized labor, something that all\nprogressives did not share. These are only a few of the more\nwell-known residents but numerous feminists used their Hull House\nexperience as a springboard to careers in social reform or\nprofessions of various sorts. \n\nAlthough Hull House was replete with extraordinary minds, no one was\nlikely to be as intellectually challenging to Addams as Florence\nKelley (1859–1932). A Cornell graduate, Kelley translated\nFriedrich Engels’ The Condition of the Working Class in\nEngland and Karl Marx’ Free Trade into\nEnglish. She was an active member of the Socialist Labor Party until the\nleadership, threatened by Kelley’s forceful style,\nexpelled her.  A single mother with three children, Kelley found a home at\nHull House where she opened an employment center and\nbegan conducting research on sweatshops for the Illinois Bureau of\nLabor Statistics. Kelley would later go on to become the general\nsecretary of the new Consumer’s League, an organization dedicated to\nusing consumer pressure to ensure that safe and high quality goods\nwere manufactured. Kelley was one of the most distinguished social\nreformers of the early 20th Century. \n\nAt Hull House, Kelley altered the dynamics of the resident\ncommunity. She brought a sense of class-consciousness along with a\ngreat strength of conviction. After Kelley’s arrival (and Mary Kenny’s\ncoming a year prior) Hull House became more deeply involved in\nsupporting the labor movement, which was heretofore dominated by\nmen. Kelley also learned from Addams, who she admired throughout her\nlife. Perhaps the legacy of the many accomplishments of the Hull-House\nresidents suffered because of the fame of their leader, but given the\nopportunity, each expressed their admiration and gratitude to Addams\nfor making Hull House the hotbed of ideas and action that it\nwas. Addams was the most visible leader of a remarkable group\nof educated activists whose mutual respect allowed intellectual growth\nto flourish. \n\nFinally a few other influences are worthy of mention. Although she was\nnot personally religious, Addams’ Christian roots left their\nmark. Addams was quite well versed in the Christian bible and had\nattended a number of religious courses during her time at Rockford\nSeminary. Addams used religious language on occasion to help get her\nmessage out to Christian constituencies. Addams was also well\nacquainted with Greek philosophy and made references to Socrates,\nPlato, and Aristotle in her work. Addams was attracted to the ability\nof Greek philosophers to move between personal and social concerns\nrather than compartmentalizing their philosophical analysis. Some have\nsuggested that Addams was influenced by August Comte (1798–1857)\nand the positivists. Comte, who coined the term\n“sociology,” believed sciences need their own logic drawn\nfrom experience rather than the a priori universal\nrationalism of Descartes. Addams would have been attracted to his\nideas about social progress and his development of a religion of\nhumanity. Finally, Addams also read a great deal of literature, which\ninfluenced her ideas concerning culture and which sometimes seeps into\nher analysis, as it does when she uses Shakespeare’s King\nLear to understand labor-management relations.  Athough she did not\nbelieve that reading was a substitute for direct experience, she did\nsuggest more than once that reading great works of fiction was a means\nof developing a sympathetic understanding. \n\nAlthough Addams had a wide variety of influences, as we have seen, she\nwas not a derivative thinker as many commentators suggest. She drew\nupon a number of great theorists to develop her ideas about social\nmorality but never dogmatically followed in anyone’s footsteps. All\nthe while, she influenced many others as she made her unique\ncontributions to American and feminist philosophy. \n\nFeminist philosophers have attended to the impact of context on theory\nmore than mainstream philosophers. Although there are lively debates\nwithin feminist philosophical circles regarding the nature of\nobjectivity, many including Dorothy Smith, Nancy Hartsock, Hilary\nRose, Alison Jaggar, and Sandra Harding have developed the notion that\nknowledge is indeed situated. In particular, feminist standpoint\ntheorists valorize the perspectives and theories derived from\noppressed positions in society such as from women’s\nexperience. Harding describes a feminist standpoint as something to be\nachieved rather than as a passive perspective. All women have lived\nexperience in a woman’s body and therefore have a woman’s perspective\nbut a feminist standpoint requires an effort at stepping back to gain\na holistic picture of power struggles. Through the understanding of\nthe perspectival aspect of knowledge claims, standpoint epistemology\ncan create libratory knowledge that can be leveraged to subvert\noppressive systems. One of the challenges of standpoint theory is how\nto give voice to multiple positions without falling back on\nhierarchies that favor certain standpoints over others. \n\nJane Addams demonstrates an appreciation for the spirit of standpoint\ntheory through her work and writing at Hull-House.  Despite the\nprivileged social position she was born into, her settlement avocation\nimmersed her in disempowered communities.  Addams poetically describes\nher moral mandate to meet, know, and understand others: “We know\nat last, that we can only discover truth by a rational and democratic\ninterest in life, and to give truth complete social expression is the\nendeavor upon which we are entering. Thus the identification with the\ncommon lot that is the essential idea of Democracy becomes the source\nand expression of social ethics. It is though we thirsted at the great\nwells of human experience, because we know that a daintier or less\npotent draught would not carry us to the end of the journey, going\nforward as we must in the heat and jostle of the crowd” (DSE\n9). One might object that although these are admirable sentiments,\nthey are still spoken as an outsider. What constitutes an outsider?\nAddams lived the better part of a half-century in the diverse\nimmigrant neighborhood of Hull House in Chicago. She didn’t go\nhome to the suburbs or return with her data to a university\noffice. She lived and worked amongst the crime, civic corruption,\nprostitution, sweatshops, and other ills of the community. When they\nfirst started Hull House, Addams and Starr were involved\noutsiders—an oddity that neighbors looked upon\nsuspiciously. However, time, proximity, and an earnest desire to learn\nand help won the trust and respect of the neighborhood. The outsiders\nbecame insiders. When Addams wrote or spoke about single women\nlaborers, child laborers, prostitutes, or first and second generation\nimmigrants, she employed first-hand knowledge gained from her own\nsocial interactions. Addams leveraged her Hull House experiences to\ngive voice to standpoints marginalized in society. Simultaneously, she\nworked to give the oppressed their own voice through college extension\ncourses, English language courses, and social clubs that fostered\npolitical and social debate. Addams was self-conscious about speaking\nfor others: “I never addressed a Chicago audience on the subject\nof the Settlement and its vicinity without inviting a neighbor to go\nwith me, that I might curb my hasty generalization by the\nconsciousness that I had an auditor who knew the conditions more\nintimately than I could hope to do” (TYH 80). Addams did not try\nto arrive at universal moral truths but recognized that the standpoint\nof Hull House neighbors mattered.  \n\nIn an 1896 article in The American Journal of Sociology,\n“A Belated Industry,” Addams addresses the plight of women\nin domestic labor. These were the most powerless of laborers:\npredominantly women, many of them immigrants with limited English\nlanguage skills and in a job that afforded little legal protection or\norganizing possibilities. Addams begins the article with a footnote\nclaiming that her knowledge of domestic laborers comes from her\nexperience with the Woman’s Labor Bureau, one of the many Hull House\nprojects. Addams goes on to address the powerlessness of domestic work\nparticularly as it entails isolation and a highly inequitable power\nrelationship: “The household employé[sic] has no regular\nopportunity for meeting other workers of her trade, and of attaining\nwith them the dignity of corporate body” (ABI 538). Addams\nidentifies the gendered dimension of this oppressive work: “men\nwould … resent the situation and consider it quite impossible\nif it implied the giving up of their family and social ties, and\nliving under the roof of the household requiring their services”\n(ABI 540). Addams extrapolates her experience of these workers to\nimaginatively inhabit a standpoint and give them voice. She explicitly\nclaims as much, “An attempt is made to present this industry\n[domestic labor] from the point of view of those women who are working\nin households for wages” (ABI 536). Addams repeatedly gave\nrecognition to the experiences of oppressed peoples that she came to\nknow in an effort to have their concerns acknowledged in the social\ndemocracy she was trying to foster. \n\nAddams believed recognizing alternative standpoints was\nimportant in promoting social progress through sympathetic\nunderstanding. Accordingly, if a voice is given to individuals\ninhabiting marginalized positions in society, it fosters the\npossibility of better understanding between people as well as actions\nthat can lead to improving their lot. Addams engaged in the tricky\nbalance of honoring standpoints while simultaneously seeking\nconnections and continuities to build upon. This is exemplified in\nAddams’ books on young people, Youth and\nthe City Streets, and elderly women, The Long Road of Woman’s\nMemory. The latter work is a treatise on memory, which is based\non the memories of first generation immigrant women. Rather than\ngrounding her theory upon the experiences of famous women theorists or\nwriters—and Addams knew most of the prominent women of her\nday—Addams based her analysis on the women who were her\nneighbors at Hull House. Addams not only grounded her philosophical\nwork in experience, but in the experiences of those on the margins of\nsociety. Addams puts experience before theory. She did not begin by\npositing a theory about these women. Instead, she retold a number of\nstories she had heard from them and then drew out conclusions about\nthe function of memory. For Addams, theory follows experience. Addams\nwas in the minority among her peers in philosophy or feminism to\nbelieve that working class immigrant women not only should be given a\nvoice but also had something important to contribute to the community\nof ideas. \n\nAn example of Addams’ application of feminist standpoint theory\n(or at least a forerunner of it) can be seen in the “Devil\nBaby” which recounts what transpired after three Italian women\ncame to Hull House to see a possessed infant. One can form a whimsical\nimage from Addams’ account, “No amount of\ndenial convinced them that he was not there, for they knew exactly\nwhat he was like with his cloven hoofs, his pointed ears and\ndiminutive tail; the Devil Baby had, moreover, been able to speak as\nsoon as he was born and was shockingly profane” (LRW 7–8). This\nwould be an amusing anecdote if it stopped there, but Addams described\na six-week period of time when Hull House was inundated with stories\nabout the alleged Devil Baby. Visitors even offered Hull House\nresidents money to see the creature despite adamant responses that\nthere was no such baby.  Multiple versions of how the Devil Baby came\nto be arose in the neighborhood and eventually the hysteria made the\nnewspapers. One version of the story claimed that the Devil Baby was\nthe offspring of an atheist and a devoted Italian girl. When the\nhusband tore a holy picture from the wall claiming that he would\nrather have a devil in the house, his wish was granted in the form of\nhis coming child (LRW 8). Although a fascinating social phenomenon,\nthe Devil Baby story is of little obvious philosophical importance and\nit would be easy to dismiss those who perpetuated the story as\nsimpletons caught up in hysteria. Not for Jane Addams. She applied a\nfamiliar approach by refusing to pass judgment, listening carefully,\nand developing a sympathetic understanding. Addams actively worked to\ngrasp their subject position. \n\nAlthough Addams dismissed the “gawkers” who came to see the\nDevil Baby as a sensationalist seeking mob, she wanted to understand\nthe older women who had perpetuated the myth: “Whenever I heard\nthe high eager voices of old women, I was irresistibly interested and\nleft anything I might be doing in order to listen to them” (LRW\n9). What she found were women who were serious and highly animated\nabout the Devil Baby. They used the appearance of the Devil Baby and\nthe excitement it created as an opportunity to discuss important and\ntroubling matters of their life. Addams, who never sought simple\nanswers to complex issues, found a convergence of class, race, and\ngender dynamics fueling the Devil Baby phenomenon.  These immigrant\nwomen were in very unfamiliar surroundings and had to adjust to\nforeign ideas and practices. They had been alienated by their children\nwho adapted to the new country more easily, keeping the old ways at\narm’s length. Many of these women also had been victims of domestic\nabuse long before such acts had a distinct label. One woman tells\nAddams, “My face has this queer twist for now nearly sixty\nyears; I was ten when it got that way, the night after I saw my father\ndo my mother to death with his knife” (LRW 11). For these\nforgotten and beaten women the Devil Baby represented a connection to\na past that made more sense to them: one that had clear moral\nimperatives. Another woman tells Addams, “You might say it’s a\ndisgrace to have your son beat you up for the sake of a bit of money\nyou’ve earned by scrubbing—your own man is\ndifferent—but I haven’t the heart to blame the boy for\ndoing what he’s seen all his life, his father forever went wild when\nthe drink was in him and struck me to the very day of his death. The\nugliness was born in the boy as the marks of the Devil was born in the\npoor child up-stairs” (LRW 11). Addams’ recounting of tale after\ntale of violence provides a depressing view of immigrant women’s lives\nat the turn of the century. For women who had lived such a hard life,\nthe Devil Baby provided a momentary opportunity for\nresistance. Husbands and children would listen to them and temporarily\nforsake beating them for fear of divine retribution as evinced by the\nDevil Baby. Addams describes memory as serving to “make life\npalatable and at rare moments even beautiful” (LRW 28). Although\nthis is a specific explanatory analysis, it demonstrates how Addams sought\nconnections among the personal stories: “When these\nreminiscences, based upon the diverse experiences of my people unknown\nto each other, point to one inevitable conclusion, they accumulate\ninto a social protest …” (LRW 29). Addams proceeds to view\nthe Devil Baby in light of the women’s movement and the fight against\noppression. Given the position of the old women, the Devil Baby was\nthe vehicle of resistance and an opportunity for Addams to interject\nfeminist analysis. \n\nIf “radical” is defined as challenging existing structures\nof power, Jane Addams was the least elitist and the most radical of\nthe American philosophers of her era. Addams consistently took and\neloquently supported inclusive positions that sought the benefit of\nsociety. While pragmatists typically advocated for social progress,\nAddams radicalized the extent of that social progress. Rather than\ndefining progress by the achievements of the best and the brightest,\nAddams advocates the betterment of all in what she calls\n“lateral progress.” For Addams, lateral progress meant\nthat social advancement could not be declared through the\nbreakthroughs or peak performances of a few, but could only\nauthentically be found in social gains held in common.  Addams employs\nmetaphor to explain the concept: \n  The man who insists upon consent, who moves with the people, is\nbound to consult the feasible right as well as the absolute right. He\nis often obliged to attain only Mr. Lincoln’s “best\npossible,” and often have the sickening sense of compromising\nwith his best convictions. He has to move along with those whom he\nrules toward a goal that neither he nor they see very clearly till\nthey come to it. He has to discover what people really want, and then\n“provide the channels in which the growing moral force of their\nlives shall flow.” What he does attain, however, is not the\nresult of his individual striving, as a solitary mountain climber\nbeyond the sight of the valley multitude, but it is underpinned and\nupheld by the sentiments and aspirations of many others. Progress has\nbeen slower perpendicularly, but incomparably greater because\nlateral.   \n\nHe has not taught his contemporaries to climb mountains, but he has\npersuaded the villagers to move up a few feet higher (AML 175). \n\nWhether one refers to them as “robber barons” or\n“captains of industry,” the rise of commerce in the United\nStates was defined by the winners of the game: those who amassed\nwealth. The wealthy enjoyed tremendous progress in healthcare,\neducation, and material well-being. Addams was not satisfied with\nnarrow social development and redefined progress according to the\ncommon person’s experience. This redefinition continues to elude us\ntoday as class disparity in the United States continues to\ngrow. Ironically, Addams is often chastised for expounding middle\nclass values, which was her point of reference as she started Hull\nHouse, but Addams’ experiences pushed her to more fully understand and\nappreciate the immigrant poor in the neighborhood. \n\nAddams applied the idea of lateral progress to numerous issues. When\nshe discusses the role of labor unions, she argues that in their\nattempt to improve conditions for all workers, unions are fulfilling a\nvital function that society has abrogated. Addams, who had a track\nrecord of supporting labor, makes it clear that she does not view\ncollective bargaining as an end in itself. Addams views unions as\ntrailblazers who obtain working conditions that eventually benefit\neveryone in society: “trade unions are trying to do for\nthemselves what the government should secure for all its citizens;\nhas, in fact, secured in many cases” (FSS 456). Addams is not\ninterested in improving the lot of one group of workers over\nanother. “Any sense of division and suspicion is fatal in a\ndemocratic form of government, for although each side may seem to\nsecure most for itself, when consulting only its own interests, the\nfinal test must be the good of the community as a whole” (FSS\n461). For Addams, unions are important in as much as they improve\nworking conditions, raise wages, reduce hours and eliminate child\nlabor for all Americans—lateral progress. \n\nAlthough the first chapter of Addams’ Democracy and Social\nEthics is ostensibly a critique of charity workers and their\npreconceived notions of the needs of the destitute, it also reveals\nAddams’ disposition toward the poor and the oppressed. She decries the\nhistorical position of blaming the victim: “Formerly, when it\nwas believed that poverty was synonymous with vice and laziness, and\nthat the prosperous man was the righteous man, charity was\nadministered harshly with a good conscience; for the charitable agent\nreally blamed the individual for his poverty, and the very fact of his\nown superior prosperity gave him a certain consciousness of superior\nmorality” (DSE 11–12). Such a judgment serves to separate the\nwealthy from the poor.  Accordingly, the rich can make progress\nintellectually, materially, technologically, etc., while the poor are\nthought to be left behind largely due to their own actions. Addams\nargues that the poor are often victims of circumstance and that it is\nthe responsibility of society to first understand those who are\nmarginalized and then develop means for their participation in lateral\nprogress. \n\nCharity, although a good, is not lateral progress. A temporary\ntransfer in wealth, while noble, does not constitute real progress in\nalleviating economic disparity. Addams never viewed herself as a\ncharity worker nor did she characterize the work of Hull House as\ncharity: “I am always sorry to have Hull House regarded as\nphilanthropy” (ONS 45). What Addams sought was a lateral\nprogress that could be brought about by the collective will and\nmanifested through social institutions. She believes there would be no\nneed for settlements if “society had been reconstructed to the\npoint of offering equal opportunity for all” (ONS 27). Addams is\nnot advocating a laissez-faire capitalism version of equal\nopportunity that is abstract and rights based. Free market economics\ninfluences modern understandings of democracy as merely assuring the\nadequate opportunity to participate. Addams’ approach to equal\nopportunity is set in a context of active democracy where citizens and\nsocial organizations look out for one another because they all have a\nstake in lateral progress or what today might be termed democratic\nsocialism. \n\nAddams’ radical pragmatism ultimately had a feminist dimension as she\ncontinually gave voice to women’s experience, addressed women’s\nissues, and saw a vibrant social democracy as only possible if there\nwas full participation by both men and women.  When it came to issues\nsuch as women’s suffrage, Addams manifests a feminist\npragmatism. “If women had no votes with which to select the men\nupon whom her social reform had become dependent some cherished\nproject might be so modified by uninformed legislatures during the\nprocess of legal enactment, that the law, as finally passed, injured\nthe very people it was meant to protect. Women had discovered that the\nunrepresented are always liable to be given what they do not want by\nlegislators who merely wish to placate them” (STY 89–90). Note\nthat Addams does not argue the application of abstract human rights\nbut she instead makes a functional claim about the role of voting in\nproper democratic representation. It is not that Addams opposes rights\nbut she will continually opt for pragmatist arguments on feminist\nissues. Her male pragmatist colleagues were sympathetic to feminist\npositions but did not make the claims as forcefully or consistently as\nAddams (Seigfried, 1996). \n\nAddams’ notion of lateral progress exemplifies again how she has\nbeen misrepresented as merely a reformer. Radical discourse, a la Marx,\nhas been associated with the call for extreme changes in social\ninstitutions and systems. Although such changes may be arguably\ndesirable, they entail upheaval that will disrupt social relationships\nat great potential personal cost. Addams sought substantial social progress\nthrough mutual agreement and tapping into communal intelligence.  Her\nradical vision refused to give up on the individuals in society and\ntheir caring relationships. Mixing theoretical notions of social\nchange with concrete experiences of community organizing, Addams was a\ncaring radical.  Addams was indeed interested in ameliorating social\nproblems, but that does not preclude a broadly construed radical edge\nto her social philosophy. \n\nAn analysis of Addams’ moral philosophy suggests at least three\nclaims about her relationship to feminist care ethics avant la lettre. One,\nAddams’ approach to the important social issues of her day\nreflected the relationality and contextualization that are important\nto what is called care ethics today.  Two, although Addams employed\ncaring in response to the needs of others, she contributes an active,\neven assertive, dimension to care ethics not commonly found in\nfeminist theory. Third, Addams advocates what might be called\n“socializing care”: systemically instantiating the habits\nand practices of care in social institutions. \n\nAlthough care is a simple and widely invoked word, many feminist\ntheorists have invested it with a particular meaning as it applies to\nethics.  The original motivation for developing care ethics was an\nacknowledgement that traditional forms of morality, in particular\nprinciple-based and consequence-based ethics, did not adequately\naddress the richness of the human condition. These approaches are said\nto bracket-out emotions, relationships, temporal considerations,\nreciprocity, and creativity to focus on immediate adjudication of\nmoral conflicts. Accordingly, the use of rules or consequences can\nbecome a reductionist and formulaic response resulting in shortsighted\nresponses to complex and systemic issues. For care ethicists, while\nprinciples are not totally ignored, they are tempered by a concern for\ninterpersonal connection. Principles and consequences have an\nimportant place in moral deliberation but care theorists seek a more\nrobust and complex sense of morality that cannot ignore the context\nand people involved. For example, the claim that people who\nspray-paint graffiti on a building ought to be punished because they\nhave damaged someone else’s property (rule/principle violation) will\nlikely receive widespread assent. Care ethicists do not necessarily\ndeny such an assertion but they want to know more. The person doing\nthe spray-painting is a human being whose motivations and\ncircumstances may reveal other variables not sufficiently addressed by\nthe mere recognition of rule violations. There may be systemic issues\ninvolving social opportunities or discrimination or lack of voice that\nhave contributed to this behavior. Care ethicists shift the moral\nfocus from abstract individuals and their actions to concrete,\nsituated people with feelings, friends, and dreams—persons who\ncan be cared about. Care ethics demands effort, experience, knowledge,\nimagination and empathy to effectively understand the totality of the\nmoral context. The result is not exoneration of personal\nresponsibility but a richer understanding of the human condition where\nwe are all actors and acted upon. \n\nAddams consistently moves beyond formulaic moral accounts of\nprinciples or consequences to apply a kind of care ethics to her experiences in\nthe Hull House neighborhood. Proximity is once again crucial as she\nhas direct experience of individuals which better provides the\nresources for a caring response. However, as a philosopher, Addams\nextrapolates her experiences to theorize about others of similar\ncircumstances. For example, in The Spirit of Youth and the City\nStreets Addams addresses juvenile delinquency. She recounts\ncharges against young men who were brought before the Juvenile Court\nin Chicago (which Hull House had helped establish). These charges were\ncategorized by type such as stealing, which included the pilfering of\npigeons, blankets, and a bicycle. Another category was disorderly\nconduct which included picking up coal from railroad tracks, throwing\nstones at railroad employees, and breaking down a fence. There was\nalso vagrancy, which included loafing, sleeping on the streets all\nnight, and wandering (SYC 56–57). Addams does not deny the seriousness\nof some of these infractions but she does not rush to judgment,\ninstead choosing to investigate the context further.  She talks to the\nyoung men and asks them about their motivations.  She identifies a\nlistlessness, a desire for adventure not quieted by what the city has\nto offer: “their very demand for excitement is a protest against\nthe dullness of life, to which we ourselves instinctively\nrespond” (SYC 71). Addams views the city as built around the\npossibility of factory production but ignoring the needs of future\nworkers. She finds in the “juvenile delinquents” many\nyoung people who simply seek adventure and excitement because their\nlives have little of it. Had Addams merely abstracted youth as a\ncategory of individuals who seem to be prone to break the law, she\ncould have easily found principles to place a negative judgment on\nthem. However, Addams saw them as humans, many of whom she witnessed\ngrow up in the neighborhood and she cared for them beyond the\nalienating label of “troubled youth.” \n\nMore than merely prefiguring care ethics, Addams infuses a high standard of\nsocial responsibility into this moral approach. Addams advocates a\nduty of social awareness and engagement thus creating the potential\nfor care. Many care ethicists are wary of the notion of duty, as it\nhas been traditionally formulated. Moral duties have historically\nentailed claims regarding actions that a person is required to offer\non behalf of another. Because the “other” is an abstract\nother and the requirements are universalized (I must act in such a way\nin all cases) duties toward others have tended toward moral minimums\nof obligation. For example, if someone’s life is in peril and minimal\neffort is required to prevent it, such as an infant drowning in 3\ninches of bath water, a moral obligation to act is present. Although\nsuch cases get widespread agreement, it becomes more difficult to\nascertain what obligation one has to distant others with unclear\nexpectations of success. For example, many Americans have disposable\nincome that could save the life of someone in a poverty stricken\ncountry on a distant continent; do they have a moral obligation to\ngive them money and to what extent?  Addams constructs the duty to\ncare differently. Hers is an epistemological demand. Addams claims\nthat good citizens actively pursue knowledge of others—not just\nfacts but a deeper understanding—for the possibility of caring\nand acting on their behalf: “if we grow contemptuous of our\nfellows, and consciously limit our intercourse to certain kinds of\npeople whom we have previously decided to respect, we not only\ntremendously circumscribe our range of life, but limit our scope of\nethics” (DSE 8). For Addams, care ethics must be actively\npursued not passively fostered. Addams’ language is more\nassertive than much current care ethics discourse.  \n\nFinally, Addams extends care ethics to the public realm. She is not\ncontent to compartmentalize personal and social morality.  Caring is\nwhat she desires for democracy and its various institutions. Addams\nviews the residents of social settlements, for example, as having\n“an opportunity of seeing institutions from the recipient’s\nstandpoint” because they are not distant institutions but\nneighbors. She finds this perspective significant and believes that it\nshould ultimately “find expression in institutional\nmanagement” (OVS 39). Furthermore, she differentiates the\nepistemological project of the settlement from the university in\nlanguage that acknowledges a caring element: “The settlement\nstands for application as opposed to research; for emotion as opposed\nto abstraction, for universal interest as opposed to\nspecialization” (FSS 189). While social settlements epitomize a\ndemocratic endeavor for Addams, she applies the same caring values to\nother institutions. The creation of the juvenile courts in Chicago\nrepresented an example of caring because it mandated contextualized\nregard for the context of young people. The creation of adult\neducation that addressed tangible and contemporary issues also\ndemonstrated a caring regard for the needs of Hull-House\nneighbors. Perhaps most of all, the comportment of the Hull-House\nresidents manifested care ethics in their willingness to listen, learn\nand respond. Addams viewed socializing care as participating in a rich\nideal of democracy.","contact.mail":"hamington@earthlink.net","contact.domain":"earthlink.net"}]
