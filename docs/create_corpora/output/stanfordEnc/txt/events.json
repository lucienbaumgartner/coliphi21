In the last few decades, this\nview has been a focus of considerable debate in philosophy, with\nimplications reaching far into the concern of other disciplines as\nwell, above all linguistics and the cognitive sciences. Indeed, there\nis little question that human perception, action, language, and\nthought manifest at least a prima facie commitment to\nentities of this sort:\n\nPre-linguistic infants appear to be able to discriminate and\n“count” events, and the content of adult perception,\nespecially in the auditory realm, endorses the discrimination and\nrecognition as events of some aspects of the perceived\nscene.\n\nHumans (and, presumably, other animals) appear to form intentions\nto plan and execute actions, and to bring about changes in the\nworld.\n\nDedicated linguistic devices (such as verb tenses and aspects,\nnominalization of some verbs, certain proper names) are tuned to events\nand event structures, as opposed to entities and structures of other\nsorts.\n\nThinking about the temporal and causal aspects of the\nworld seems to require parsing those aspects in terms of events and\ntheir descriptions.\n\n\nIt is, however, unclear to what extent such prima facie\ncommitments add up to an integrated phenomenon, as opposed to\nseparate, independent dispositions. Moreover, even among those who\nfavor a realist attitude towards the ontological status of events,\nthere is significant disagreement concerning the precise nature of\nsuch entities. (Their broad characterization as ‘things that\nhappen’, though commonly found in dictionaries, merely shifts\nthe burden to the task of clarifying the meaning of\n‘happen’.) One useful approach is to set them against\nentities belonging to other, philosophically more familiar,\nmetaphysical categories. In the following we review the main contrasts\nbetween events and those categories that have in the literature been\nput forward explicitly as their ontological competitors, or at least\nas categories exhibiting significant differences with the category of\nevents. Along the way, we shall also review the main conceptual tools\nthat metaphysicians and other philosophers have adopted in their\nattempts to deal with events, either from a realist or from a\nnon-realist perspective.\n\n\nAlthough not undisputed, some standard differences between events and\nphysical objects are commonplace in the philosophical literature.\nFirst, there would seem to be a difference in mode of being: material objects such\nas stones and chairs are said to exist; events are said to\noccur or happen or take place (Hacker\n1982a; Cresswell 1986). Second, there would seem to be differences in the way\nobjects and events relate to space and time. Ordinary objects are\nsupposed to have relatively crisp spatial boundaries and vague\ntemporal boundaries; events, by contrast, would have relatively vague\nspatial boundaries and crisp temporal boundaries.  Objects are said to\nbe invidiously located in space—they occupy their\nspatial location; events tolerate co-location much more easily\n(Quinton 1979; Hacker 1982b). Objects can move; events cannot (Dretske\n1967). Finally, objects are standardly construed as enduring\ncontinuants—they are in time and persist through time\nby being wholly present at every time at which they exist; events are perduring\noccurrents—they take up time and persist by having\ndifferent parts or “stages” at different times (Johnson\n1921; Mellor 1980; Simons 2000). \n\nThe last distinction is especially controversial, as there are\nphilosophers—from Whitehead (1919), Broad (1923), and Russell (1927) to Quine\n(1950), Lewis (1986c), Heller (1990), Sider (2001) and many\nothers—who conceive of objects as four-dimensional entities that\nextend across time just as they extend across space. Some such\nphilosophers would accordingly draw no metaphysically significant\ndistinction between objects and events, treating both as entities of\nthe same kind: an object would simply be a “monotonous”\nevent; an event would be an “unstable” object (Goodman\n1951). More generally, the relevant distinction would be one of\ndegree, and while ‘event’ is standardly applied to things\nthat develop and change fast in time, ‘object’ would apply\nto those things that strike us as “firm and internally\ncoherent” (Quine 1970). On the other hand, there are also\nphilosophers who reject the distinction on the side of events, by\nconstruing at least some such entities—e.g., processes—as\ncontinuants: what is happening at any moment when an apple is decaying\nor a person is walking down the street is the whole process, not just\npart of it (Stout 1997, 2003, 2016; Galton 2006, 2008; Galton & Mizoguchi 2009). This view, in turn, admits of several variants and alternatives, e.g. based on different ways of understanding the notion of a continuant (Steward 2013, 2015) or its relation to the stuff of which a continuant is composed (Crowther 2011, 2018). \n\nIf a metaphysical distinction between objects and events is granted,\nthen a question arises as to the relation between the entities in the two\ncategories. Objects are prime actors in events; objectless events are\nuncommon. But so are eventless objects; events make up the lives of\nobjects. In a radical mood, however, one can think of the entities in\none category as being metaphysically dependent on entities in the\nother. For instance, it has been claimed that events supervene on\ntheir participants (Lombard 1986; Bennett 1988), or that objects depend on the\nevents in which they partake (Parsons 1991). In a more moderate way,\none can grant objects and events an equal ontological status but\nmaintain that either objects or events are primary in the order of\nthought. Thus, it has been argued that a pure event-based ontology\nwould not be sufficient for the success of our re-identifying\npractices, which require a stable frame of reference of the sort that\nis adequately provided only by objects (Strawson 1959). A similar\nasymmetry between objects and events seems to be endorsed by natural\nlanguage, which has expressions such as ‘the fall of the\napple’ but not ‘the pomification of the\nfall’. However, these asymmetries may be attenuated to the\nextent that objects, too, may and sometimes must be identified via\nreference to events. For example, if we track down the father of\nSebastian or the author of Waverley, it is by identifying\ncertain events in the first place—of fathering and of writing,\nrespectively (Moravcsik 1965; Davidson 1969; Lycan 1970; Tiles\n1981). \n\nNo matter what their relationships, events are naturally contrasted\nwith objects insofar as both are conceived of as individuals.\nBoth appear to be concrete, temporally and spatially located entities\norganized into part-whole hierarchies. Both can be counted, compared,\nquantified over, referred to, and variously described and re-described.\n(It has been argued that our conceptions of these two categories are so\nclosely tied as to be structurally complementary, in that any\ncharacterization of the concept event that only mentions\nspatial and temporal features yields a characterization of the concept\nobject by a simple replacement of temporal with spatial\npredicates, and vice versa (Mayo 1961).) From this point of view,\nevents are to be distinguished from facts, which are characterized by\nfeatures of abstractness and a-temporality: the event of Caesar’s death\ntook place in Rome in 44 BCE, but that Caesar died is a fact here as\nin Rome, today as in 44 BCE. One could indeed speculate\nthat for every event there is a companion fact, viz. the fact that the event\ntook place (Bennett 1988), but the two would still be categorially distinct. The death of Caesar must no more be confused with the fact that Caesar died than the Queen of England should be confused with the fact that England has a Queen (Ramsey 1927). \n\nAccording to some authors, this categorial distinction is actually\nreflected in the different sorts of expressions through which facts\nand events are referred to in ordinary language. In the terminology of\nVendler (1967), ‘Caesar’s death’ is a perfect nominal: the\nprocess of nominalization is complete and the expression can only be\nmodified by adjectival phrases (‘Caesar’s violent\ndeath’). By contrast, a that-clause such as ‘that\nCaesar died’, or a gerundive such as ‘Ceasar’s\ndying’, are imperfect nominals that still have “a verb\nalive and kicking inside them”: they can therefore tolerate\nauxiliaries and tenses (‘That Caesar would die’,\n‘Caesar’s having died’), adverbs (‘Ceasar’s dying\nviolently’), negation (‘Ceasar’s not dying’),\netc. With some qualifications (McCann 1979), the metaphysical\nhypothesis would be that, as a norm, perfect nominals stand for\nevents, whereas facts or states of affairs are the referents of\nimperfect nominals. \n\nSome philosophers, however, conceive of the link between events\nand facts as being much closer than this—close enough to justify\nassimilating the two categories (Wilson 1974; Tegtmeier 2000) or at\nleast treating both as species of the same “state of\naffairs” genus (Chisholm 1970). This has two main\nconsequences. On the one hand, because facts corresponding to\nnon-equivalent propositions are distinct, events conceived of as facts or fact-like particulars\nare fine-grained entities that cannot be freely re-described or\nre-identified under different conceptualizations: the fact that Caesar\ndied violently is different from the fact that he died, hence the\ndeath of Caesar and his violent death would be two different events\n(Chisholm 1970, 1971), as opposed to one and the same event under\ndifferent descriptions (Davidson 1969; Anscombe 1979). On the other hand, because\nlinguistic expressions of facts are semantically transparent, a\nFregean line of argument could be concocted to show instead that\nevents construed as facts are too coarse-grained, to the point of\nmelting into a single “big” entity (Davidson 1967a). (The\nargument is known as the “slingshot argument”\n(Barwise & Perry 1981).) \n\nOther philosophers have insisted on distinguishing events from facts but\nhave given accounts that effectively amount to an assimilation.\nThis is true especially of those theories that construe events as property\nexemplifications, i.e., exemplifications of properties\nby objects at times (Kim 1966; Martin 1969; Goldman\n1970; Taylor 1985; Hendrickson 2006). On such theories, events are individual entities.\nBut because they have a structure, a difference in any constituent is\nsufficient to yield a different event. In particular, a difference in\nthe relevant constitutive property is sufficient to distinguish events\nsuch as Caesar’s death, construed as Caesar’s exemplification of the\nproperty of dying, and Caesar’s violent death, construed as his\nexemplification of the property of dying violently (Kim 1976). Again, this\nmakes events virtually as fine-grained as facts. It bears emphasis,\nhowever, that this consequence is not intrinsic to the theory of events\nas property exemplifications. Both Caesar’s death and his violent death\ncould be construed as Caesar’s exemplification of one and the same\nproperty P, describable both as a dying and—with\ngreater accuracy—as a dying violently. Thus, even if\nconstrued as a structured complex, an event can be coarsely referred to\ninsofar as its names need not be sensitive to this structure (Bennett\n1988). In this way the distinction between events and facts can be\nreinstated in terms of a firm distinction between semantic and\nmetaphysical aspects (respectively) of the theory of event-descriptions. \n\nSimilar considerations apply to those theories that treat events as\nsituations, in the sense familiar from situation semantics (Barwise\n& Perry 1983). On such theories, events are construed as sets of\nfunctions from spatiotemporal locations to “situation\ntypes” defined as sequences of objects standing or failing to\nstand in a certain relation. But while the formal machinery delivers a\nfine-grained account, the algorithm for applying the machinery to\nnatural language sentences leaves room for flexibility. \n\nA third metaphysical category with which events have sometimes\nbeen contrasted is that of properties. If events are individuals, then\nthey are not properties, at least insofar as properties are construed as\nuniversals. Individuals exist or occur whereas universals\nrecur. However, some philosophers have taken very seriously the\nintuition that in some cases events may be said to recur, as when we\nsay that the sun rises every morning (Chisholm 1970; Johnson 1975; Brandl 1997, 2000). If\nso, then it is natural to think of events as being more similar to\nproperties than to individuals, similar enough to justify treating\nthem as a kind of property—e.g., as properties of\nmoments or intervals of time (Montague 1969), properties of\ncross-world classes of individuals (Lewis 1986a), or properties of\nsets of world segments (von Kutschera 1993). For instance, on the\nfirst of these accounts, the event of the sun’s rising is the property\nof being an interval during which the sun rises. As a characterization\nof event types, this would be uncontroversial and would allow one to\nconstrue particular events as tokens of the corresponding type. (One\nsuch construal would correspond to the above-mentioned conception of\nevents as property exemplifications.) But to conceive of events as\nuniversal properties is to go beyond this uncontroversial fact and to\nreject the existence of event tokens altogether, even when it comes to\n“particular” events such as the unique rising of the sun\nthat we witnessed this morning. Rather than an instance of the\nuniversal sun rising, such an event would be a universal in\nits own right, albeit a universal of such a restricted sort and of\nsuch a degree of singularity as to be instantiated only once. \n\nOne possible view about properties is that they are not universals\nbut rather particulars of a special sort—viz. abstract particulars\n(Stout 1923) or tropes (Williams 1953). According to this\nview, the redness of this apple is different from the redness of\nanything else, not because of its extreme singularity (other things\ncould agree with the apple colorwise) but because it is the redness of\nthis apple. It exists here and now, where and while the apple\nexists. Likewise, this morning’s rising of the sun would be\nnumerically different from (though qualitatively similar to) any other\nmorning’s rising of the sun. If so, then the view that events are\nproperties becomes compatible with the view that they are\nspatiotemporally located. An event would just be a particularized\nproperty located at some region of space-time (Bennett 1996). (Once\nagain, this conception is closely related to the conception of events\nas property exemplifications, although the term\n‘exemplification’ suggests a construal of properties as\nuniversals. Some authors actually identify the two conceptions\n(Bennett 1988); others reject the identification on account of the\ndifference between property instances and property exemplifications\n(Macdonald 1989).) \n\nA variant of the trope conception construes events as trope sequences\n(Campbell 1981). However, since tropes are particulars, a sequence of\ntropes at a place may itself be viewed as a trope, hence this variant is\nbest regarded as a specification of what sort of tropes events\nare. Similar remarks apply to those theories that construe events\nas relational tropes (Mertz 1996), or even as higher-order tropes\n(Moltmann 2013).  \n\nThe intuition that events are properties of times can also be\nfleshed out in terms of thinner metaphysical commitments, by construing\nevents simply as times cum description, i.e., as temporal instants or\nintervals during which certain statements hold (van Benthem 1983). On\nthis view, for example, this morning’s rising of the sun is identified\nby an ordered pair <i,φ> where i is the\nrelevant time interval (corresponding to the descriptor ‘this\nmorning’) and φ is the sentence ‘The sun rises’.\nOf course, this treatment does not do justice to some of the intuitions\nunderlying the prima facie commitments to events mentioned at the beginning—for\ninstance, events can be perceived but times cannot (Gibson 1975). But\nbecause of the availability of fully developed theories of intervals\nalong with fully developed interval-based semantics (Cresswell 1979;\nDowty 1979), and because of equally well worked-out traditional\ntheories of instants and instant-based semantics (Prior 1967), such\naccounts are especially attractive from a reductionist perspective. One might even want to construe events as spatiotemporal\nregions cum description, distinguishing e.g between this morning’s\nrising of the sun in London and its rising in Paris. \n\nThe link between events and times has, however, been explored also in the\nopposite direction. If events are assumed as a primitive\nontological category, then one may dispense with temporal instants or\nintervals and construe them as derived entities. The most classical\ntreatment of this sort proceeds by construing temporal instants as\nmaximal sets of pairwise simultaneous (or partially simultaneous)\nevents (Russell 1914; Whitehead 1929; Walker 1947), but other\ntreatments are possible. For example, it has been suggested that the\nmathematical connection between the way events are perceived to be\nordered and the underlying temporal dimension is essentially that of a\nfree construction (in the category-theoretic sense) of linear orderings\nfrom event orderings, induced by the binary relation x wholly\nprecedes y (Thomason 1989). Treatments such as these provide a\nreduction of time in terms of relations among events and are therefore\nespecially germane to a relational conception of time (and, more\ngenerally, of space-time). Modal variants (Forbes 1993) as well as\nmereological variants (Pianesi & Varzi 1996) of such views are also\navailable. \n\nPhilosophers who agree with a conception of events as particulars\ntypically distinguish different sorts of such particulars. A classic\ntypology distinguishes four sorts: activities, accomplishments,\nachievements, and states (Ryle 1949; Vendler 1957). An\nactivity, such as John’s walking uphill, is a homogeneous\nevent: its sub-events satisfy the same description as the activity\nitself, which has no natural finishing point or culmination. An\naccomplishment, such as John’s climbing the mountain, may have\na culmination, but is never homogeneous. An achievement, such\nas John’s reaching the top, is a culminating event (and is\ntherefore always instantaneous). And a state, such as John’s\nknowing the shortest way, is homogeneous and may extend over time, but\nit makes no sense to ask how long it took or whether it culminated.\nSometimes accomplishments and achievements are grouped together into a\nsingle category of performances (Kenny 1963). Sometimes\nachievements have also been called events tout court and all\nother events have been grouped together into a broadly understood\ncategory of temporally extended entities, called processes\n(Ingarden 1935); the word ‘eventuality’ may then\nbe used as a label covering both categories (Bach 1986). \n\nSome authors introduce aspectual considerations into the taxonomy,\ndrawing on Aristotle’s distinction between Energeia and\nKinêsis (Ackrill 1965). The idea is that different\nverbs describe different types of events: verbs with no continuous\nform (‘know’) correspond to states; verbs with continuous\nform for which the present continuous entails the past perfect\n(‘John is walking uphill’ entails ‘John walked\nuphill’) correspond to activities; and verbs for which the\npresent continuous entails the negation of the past perfect\n(‘John is climbing the mountain’ entails ‘John has\nnot (yet) climbed the mountain’, at least in the relevant\ncontext) correspond to performances (Mourelatos 1978). Several authors\nhave followed in these footsteps to develop linguistically\nsophisticated theories (Taylor 1977; Dowty 1979; Freed 1979; Roberts 1979; Bach\n1981; Galton 1984; Verkuyl 1989; Smith 1991; Kühl 2008), but the\nlegitimacy of drawing ontological categorizations from such linguistic\ndistinctions has been questioned (Gill 1993). \n\nOne may also want to distinguish between dynamic events, such\nas John’s walking, and static events, such as John’s resting under\na tree. According to some authors, the latter are not events proper\nbecause they do not involve any change (Ducasse 1926). In the most\nabstract construal, a change is an ordered pair of states of affairs: an initial state and an end state (von Wright 1963). More substantial accounts of\nevents as changes describe them as exemplifications of dynamic\nproperties, i.e., properties that an object has by virtue of a\n“movement” in some quality space (Quinton 1979; Lombard\n1979, 1986). However, the question of whether all events should be or\ninvolve changes of some sort is controversial (Montmarquet 1980;\nSteward 1997; Mellor 1998; Simons 2003) and it may be argued that it\nis ultimately a matter of stipulation—hence of little\nmetaphysical import (Casati & Varzi 2008). \n\nIf static events are admitted, the question arises of whether they\nshould be kept distinct from states (Parsons 1989). One plausible\nassumption is that the distinction between the static and the dynamic\naspects of the world is skew to the distinction between states and\nactivities. As there may be static activities, so there may be dynamic\nstates. Walking is a state of John’s that is dynamic, as opposed to his\nstate of resting, which is static. The walk itself is an activity of\nJohn’s that is dynamic, as opposed to the rest he took under a tree, which may be\nconsidered a static activity. \n\nPrima facie, actions are naturally categorized as a subclass\nof events, namely, animate events. Like all events, actions are said\nto occur or take place, not to exist, and their relation to time and\nspace is event-like as well: they have relatively clear beginnings and\nendings but unclear spatial boundaries, they appear to tolerate\nco-location, and they cannot be said to move from one place to another\nor to endure from one time to another, but rather extend in space and\ntime by having spatial as well as temporal parts (Thomson 1977).\nActions and events appear to be on a par in causal explanations,\ntoo: actions can be causes of which events are effects (Davidson\n1967b). Some authors, however, prefer to draw a distinction here and\nto treat actions as relations between agents and events,\nnamely as instances of the relation of ‘bringing about’\nthat may hold between an agent and an event (von Wright 1963; Chisholm\n1964; Bach 1980; Bishop 1983; Segerberg 1989), or perhaps the relation\n‘seeing to it that’ (Belnap and Perloff 1988; Tuomela and Sandu 1994; Horty 2001). On such\nviews, actions are not individuals unless relations are themselves\nconstrued as tropes. \n\nWhether or not actions are treated as events, one might be tempted\nto distinguish between actions proper (such as John’s raising of\nhis arm) and bodily movements (such as John’s arm rising), or\nbetween intentional actions (John’s walk) and\nunintentional ones (John’s falling into a hole). For some\nauthors, this is necessary in order to explain important facts of human\nbehavior (Montmarquet 1978; Hornsby 1980a,b; Searle 1983; Brand 1984; Mele\n1997). However, it has also been argued that such distinctions do not\npertain to metaphysics but rather to the conceptual apparatus by means\nof which we describe the realm of things that happen. On this view, an\narm raising is just an arm’s rising under a mentalistic description\n(Anscombe 1957, 1979; Sher 1973). \n\nA similar story applies to the distinction between mental\nevents (John’s decision to wear boots) and physical or\nphysiological events (such and such neurons firing). One may\nthink that this distinction is real insofar as the latter events are\nexpected to fall naturally into the nomological net of physical\ntheories whereas the former seem to escape it. But one may also want\nto resist this line of thought and maintain that the distinction\nbetween the mental and the physical concerns exclusively the\nvocabulary with which we describe what goes on. These options have\nimportant ramifications for various issues in the philosophy of\nmind—e.g., issues of mental causation (Heil & Mele 1993; Walter & Heckmann 2003; Gibb et al. 2013). If\nthe distinction between mental and physical events is ontologically\nsignificant, then the question arises of how these two sorts of event\ncausally interact with each other, leading to various forms of\nanomalous or nomological dualism (Foster 1991). By contrast, the claim\nthat the distinction is purely semantic is congenial to a monist\nposition, whether nomological or\nanomalous (Macdonald 1989). Anomalous monism has been popular\nespecially among philosophers who accept a particularist conception of\nevents as widely redescribable entities, for such a conception allows\none to accept the materialist claim that all events are physical\n(regardless of whether one describes them in mentalistic terms) while\nrejecting the seeming consequence that mental goings-on can be given\npurely physical explanations (precisely because only a physicalistic\nvocabulary is suited to such explanations) (Nagel 1965; Davidson 1970,\n1993). Some authors, however, have argued that this line of argument\nfalls prey to the charge of epiphenomenalism, to the effect that\nmental events would lack causal or explanatory powers altogether\n(Honderich 1982; Robinson 1982; Kim 1993; Campbell 1998, 2005) and on\nsuch matters the debate is still open. \n\nEvents are things that happen. In some cases, however, the same sort\nof prima facie evidence that suggests a realist attitude\ntowards such things might suggest a similar attitude towards things\nthat do not actually happen, including “negative actions”\nof various sorts (Danto 1966; Ryle 1973). We speak of John’s walk with\nthe same easiness with which we speak of the talk he did not deliver,\nthe nap he did not take, the party he failed to organize; we seem to\nquantify over such things, and we normally engage in causal talk that\nseems to refer explicitly to negative causes, as when we reason that\nJohn’s failure to turn off the gas caused an explosion, or that his\nomitting the cutlery from the wedding list made Mary angry. Some\nauthors take such evidence at face value, drawing a distinction at the\nontological level: a good inventory of the world ought to include\n“negative” events and actions along with ordinary,\n“positive” ones (Lee 1978; Vermazen 1985; De Swart 1996;\nPrzepiórkowski 1999; Higginbotham 2000; Mossel 2009; Silver 2018; Bernard & Champollion 2018). Others\ndissent: we often speak as though there were such things, but\ndeep down we want our words to be interpreted in such a way as to\navoid ontological commitment. Thus, either we are just engaging in\nmere counterfactual speculations, or else the putative negative events\nare just ordinary, positive events under a negative description:\n‘John’s omitting the cutlery from the wedding list’, for\nexample, would refer to his drawing up a wedding list that contains no\ncutlery, ‘Mary’s not moving’ would describe Mary’s working\nhard to master urges to move, etc. (Mele 2005; Varzi 2008). The latter view can also be construed in metaphysical (as opposed to semantic) terms, at least in some cases: for x to omit to φ (refrain from φ-ing, etc.) at t would be for x to ensure, through their actual behavior, that they do not φ at t (Payton 2018).  \n\nThe case of negative causation is especially challenging, not last\nbecause of the link between causation and such ethical and legal\nmatters as passive killing (Bennett 1966; Green 1980; Foot 1984), good\nSamaritanism (Kleinig 1976) and, more generally, moral responsibility\n(Weinryb 1980; Walton 1980; Williams 1995; Fischer 1997; Clarke\n2014). Here it is also customary to introduce finer-grained\ndiscriminations, distinguishing e.g. several ways in which an agent\nmay fail to do something, e.g. (trying and) not\nsucceeding, refraining, omitting,\nand allowing (Brand 1971; Milanich 1984; Hall 1984; Bach\n2010). At least with regard to some such ways, it is very tempting to\nendorse a realist ontology. If so, the difficulty naturally arises of\nhow and where to draw the line. For example, the realist about\nomissions will have to find a principled way of refraining from\ntreating all omissions, including non-salient ones, as causes\n(Gorr 1979; Lewis 1986b, 2004; Thomson 2003; Menzies 2004; McGrath 2005; Sartorio\n2009; Bernstein 2014). On the other hand, the antirealist will have to explain how one\ncan account for such causal talk while holding on to the view that\nevery causal situation develops from “positive factors\nalone” (Armstrong 1999). Some would insist that every alleged\ncase of negative causation can be described in terms of positive\ncausation (Laliberté 2013). Others—the\nmajority—would resist ontological commitment by recasting the\nlogical structure of the relevant causal claims in suitable ways,\ne.g. as causal statements about events that are counterfactually\ndescribed (Hunt 2005), or as “quasi-causal” claims about\nwhat would have been a cause if the omitted event had happened (Dowe\n2001), or as mere causal explanations in which the explanans does not\nstand to the explanandum as cause to effect (Beebee 2004; Varzi\n2007; Lombard & Hudson, in press). \n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, one finds a prima facie\ncommitment to events in various aspects of human perception, action,\nlanguage, and thought. The main line of argument offered to back up this\ncommitment, however, comes from considerations of logical form. Not\nonly does ordinary talk involve explicit reference to and\nquantification over events, as when one says that John’s walk\nwas pleasant or that two explosions were heard last night.\nOrdinary talk also seems to involve several ways of adverting to\nevents implicitly. Adverbial modification is a standard example\n(Reichenbach 1947). We say that Brutus stabbed Caesar with a knife. If\nthis statement is taken to assert that a certain three-place relation\nobtains among Brutus, Caesar, and a knife, then it is hard to explain\nwhy the statement entails that Brutus stabbed Caesar (a statement that\ninvolves a different, two-place relation) (Kenny 1963). By contrast,\nif we take our statement to assert that a certain event occurred\n(namely, a stabbing of Caesar by Brutus)\nand that it had a certain property (namely, of being done\nwith a knife), then the entailment is straightforward (Davidson\n1967a).  These reasons do not constitute a proof that there are such\nentities as events. But they are telling insofar as one is interested\nin an account of how it is that certain statements mean what they\nmean, where the meaning of a statement is at least in part determined\nby its logical relations to other statements. For another example, it\nhas been argued that singular causal statements cannot be analyzed in\nterms of a causal connective (essentially for reasons having to do\nwith the above-mentioned slingshot argument) but rather require that\ncausation be treated as a binary relation holding between individual\nevents (Davidson 1967b). A third example involves the semantics of\nperceptual reports with naked infinitive complements, as in\n‘John saw Mary cry’, which is analyzed as ‘John saw\nan event which was a crying by Mary’ (Higginbotham 1983; Vlach\n1983; Gisborne 2010). Still a fourth example involves the logical form\nof statements with plural subjects, such as ‘John and Mary\nlifted the piano (together)’, which is analyzed as reporting,\nnot the exploits of a “plural object”, but rather an event\ninvolving more than one agent (Higginbotham & Schein 1986; Schein\n1993; Lasersohn 1995; Landman 1996, 2000). Many more such arguments\nhave been offered, also by authors working within different programs\nin linguistics (Parsons 1990; Peterson 1997; Rothstein 1998; Link 1998;\nHigginbotham et al. 2000; Tenny & Pustejovsky 2000;\nPietroski 2005; van Lambalgen & Hamm 2005; Robering 2014). \n\nOn the other hand, some philosophers have been dissatisfied with this\nsort of “existential proof” and have argued instead that\nall talk that seems to involve explicit or implicit reference to or\nquantification over events can be paraphrased so as to avoid the\ncommitment. For example, it has been argued that a term such as\n‘John’s walk’ goes proxy for the corresponding statement\n‘John walked’ (Geach 1965), so to say that John’s walk was\npleasant is just to say that John walked pleasantly. Similar\nparaphrases have been offered to deal with the case of explicit\nquantifier-phrases such as ‘two explosions’ as well as\nwith the implicit event quantification that lies behind\nadverb-dropping inferences (Clark 1970; Fulton 1979), singular causal\nstatements (Horgan 1978, 1982; Wilson 1985, Needham 1988, 1994, Mellor\n1991, 1995), and so on. On the face of it, it appears that questions\nof logical form leave the existential issue undecided, at least\ninsofar as an event-committing analysis automatically turns into an\neliminativist paraphrase when read in the opposite direction (and vice\nversa). \n\nAnother issue that appears to be undecided concerns so-called identity\ncriteria for events, which has been the focus of an intense debate\n(Bradie 1983; Pfeifer 1989; Mackie 1997).  Is John’s walk the\nsame event as his pleasant walk? Was Brutus’s stabbing of Caesar\nthe same event as his killing of Caesar? Was it the same as the\nviolent assassination of Caesar? Some philosophers take these to be\nmetaphysical questions—questions whose answers call for adequate\nidentity criteria, which must be provided before we are allowed to\ntake our event talk seriously. In this sense, different conceptions of\nevents tend to suggest different answers, and widely varying ones. At\none extreme we find the radical “unifiers”, who take\nevents to be as coarse-grained as ordinary objects (Quine 1985; Lemmon\n1967); at the other the radical “multipliers”, who take\nevents to be as fine-grained as facts (Kim 1966; Goldman 1971); and\nin between several moderate variants (Davidson 1969; Davis 1970;\nThalberg 1971; Thomson 1971; Brand 1977; Cleland 1991; Engel 1994;\nJones 2013). Other philosophers, however, regard questions of identity\nto be first and foremost semantic questions—questions about the\nway we talk and about what we say. No metaphysical theory, it is said,\ncan settle the semantics of ordinary event talk, hence there is no way\nof determining the truth or falsity of an event identity statement\nexclusively on the basis of one’s metaphysical views. Which\nevents a statement speaks of depends heavily (more heavily than with\nordinary material objects) on local context and unprincipled\nintuitions (Bennett 1988). If so, then the whole identity issue is\nundecidable, since one is demanding metaphysical answers to questions\nthat are in large part semantical.","contact.mail":"casati@ehess.fr","contact.domain":"ehess.fr"},{"date.published":"2002-04-22","date.changed":"2020-04-03","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/events/","author1":"Roberto Casati","author1.info":"http://roberto.casati.free.fr/casati/roberto.htm","author2.info":"http://www.columbia.edu/~av72/","entry":"events","body.text":"\n\n\n\nSmiles, walks, dances, weddings, explosions, hiccups, hand-waves,\narrivals and departures, births and deaths, thunder and lightning: the\nvariety of the world seems to lie not only in the assortment of its\nordinary citizens—animals and physical objects, and perhaps\nminds, sets, abstract particulars—but also in the sort of things\nthat happen to or are performed by them. In the last few decades, this\nview has been a focus of considerable debate in philosophy, with\nimplications reaching far into the concern of other disciplines as\nwell, above all linguistics and the cognitive sciences. Indeed, there\nis little question that human perception, action, language, and\nthought manifest at least a prima facie commitment to\nentities of this sort:\n\nPre-linguistic infants appear to be able to discriminate and\n“count” events, and the content of adult perception,\nespecially in the auditory realm, endorses the discrimination and\nrecognition as events of some aspects of the perceived\nscene.\n\nHumans (and, presumably, other animals) appear to form intentions\nto plan and execute actions, and to bring about changes in the\nworld.\n\nDedicated linguistic devices (such as verb tenses and aspects,\nnominalization of some verbs, certain proper names) are tuned to events\nand event structures, as opposed to entities and structures of other\nsorts.\n\nThinking about the temporal and causal aspects of the\nworld seems to require parsing those aspects in terms of events and\ntheir descriptions.\n\n\nIt is, however, unclear to what extent such prima facie\ncommitments add up to an integrated phenomenon, as opposed to\nseparate, independent dispositions. Moreover, even among those who\nfavor a realist attitude towards the ontological status of events,\nthere is significant disagreement concerning the precise nature of\nsuch entities. (Their broad characterization as ‘things that\nhappen’, though commonly found in dictionaries, merely shifts\nthe burden to the task of clarifying the meaning of\n‘happen’.) One useful approach is to set them against\nentities belonging to other, philosophically more familiar,\nmetaphysical categories. In the following we review the main contrasts\nbetween events and those categories that have in the literature been\nput forward explicitly as their ontological competitors, or at least\nas categories exhibiting significant differences with the category of\nevents. Along the way, we shall also review the main conceptual tools\nthat metaphysicians and other philosophers have adopted in their\nattempts to deal with events, either from a realist or from a\nnon-realist perspective.\n\n\nAlthough not undisputed, some standard differences between events and\nphysical objects are commonplace in the philosophical literature.\nFirst, there would seem to be a difference in mode of being: material objects such\nas stones and chairs are said to exist; events are said to\noccur or happen or take place (Hacker\n1982a; Cresswell 1986). Second, there would seem to be differences in the way\nobjects and events relate to space and time. Ordinary objects are\nsupposed to have relatively crisp spatial boundaries and vague\ntemporal boundaries; events, by contrast, would have relatively vague\nspatial boundaries and crisp temporal boundaries.  Objects are said to\nbe invidiously located in space—they occupy their\nspatial location; events tolerate co-location much more easily\n(Quinton 1979; Hacker 1982b). Objects can move; events cannot (Dretske\n1967). Finally, objects are standardly construed as enduring\ncontinuants—they are in time and persist through time\nby being wholly present at every time at which they exist; events are perduring\noccurrents—they take up time and persist by having\ndifferent parts or “stages” at different times (Johnson\n1921; Mellor 1980; Simons 2000). \n\nThe last distinction is especially controversial, as there are\nphilosophers—from Whitehead (1919), Broad (1923), and Russell (1927) to Quine\n(1950), Lewis (1986c), Heller (1990), Sider (2001) and many\nothers—who conceive of objects as four-dimensional entities that\nextend across time just as they extend across space. Some such\nphilosophers would accordingly draw no metaphysically significant\ndistinction between objects and events, treating both as entities of\nthe same kind: an object would simply be a “monotonous”\nevent; an event would be an “unstable” object (Goodman\n1951). More generally, the relevant distinction would be one of\ndegree, and while ‘event’ is standardly applied to things\nthat develop and change fast in time, ‘object’ would apply\nto those things that strike us as “firm and internally\ncoherent” (Quine 1970). On the other hand, there are also\nphilosophers who reject the distinction on the side of events, by\nconstruing at least some such entities—e.g., processes—as\ncontinuants: what is happening at any moment when an apple is decaying\nor a person is walking down the street is the whole process, not just\npart of it (Stout 1997, 2003, 2016; Galton 2006, 2008; Galton & Mizoguchi 2009). This view, in turn, admits of several variants and alternatives, e.g. based on different ways of understanding the notion of a continuant (Steward 2013, 2015) or its relation to the stuff of which a continuant is composed (Crowther 2011, 2018). \n\nIf a metaphysical distinction between objects and events is granted,\nthen a question arises as to the relation between the entities in the two\ncategories. Objects are prime actors in events; objectless events are\nuncommon. But so are eventless objects; events make up the lives of\nobjects. In a radical mood, however, one can think of the entities in\none category as being metaphysically dependent on entities in the\nother. For instance, it has been claimed that events supervene on\ntheir participants (Lombard 1986; Bennett 1988), or that objects depend on the\nevents in which they partake (Parsons 1991). In a more moderate way,\none can grant objects and events an equal ontological status but\nmaintain that either objects or events are primary in the order of\nthought. Thus, it has been argued that a pure event-based ontology\nwould not be sufficient for the success of our re-identifying\npractices, which require a stable frame of reference of the sort that\nis adequately provided only by objects (Strawson 1959). A similar\nasymmetry between objects and events seems to be endorsed by natural\nlanguage, which has expressions such as ‘the fall of the\napple’ but not ‘the pomification of the\nfall’. However, these asymmetries may be attenuated to the\nextent that objects, too, may and sometimes must be identified via\nreference to events. For example, if we track down the father of\nSebastian or the author of Waverley, it is by identifying\ncertain events in the first place—of fathering and of writing,\nrespectively (Moravcsik 1965; Davidson 1969; Lycan 1970; Tiles\n1981). \n\nNo matter what their relationships, events are naturally contrasted\nwith objects insofar as both are conceived of as individuals.\nBoth appear to be concrete, temporally and spatially located entities\norganized into part-whole hierarchies. Both can be counted, compared,\nquantified over, referred to, and variously described and re-described.\n(It has been argued that our conceptions of these two categories are so\nclosely tied as to be structurally complementary, in that any\ncharacterization of the concept event that only mentions\nspatial and temporal features yields a characterization of the concept\nobject by a simple replacement of temporal with spatial\npredicates, and vice versa (Mayo 1961).) From this point of view,\nevents are to be distinguished from facts, which are characterized by\nfeatures of abstractness and a-temporality: the event of Caesar’s death\ntook place in Rome in 44 BCE, but that Caesar died is a fact here as\nin Rome, today as in 44 BCE. One could indeed speculate\nthat for every event there is a companion fact, viz. the fact that the event\ntook place (Bennett 1988), but the two would still be categorially distinct. The death of Caesar must no more be confused with the fact that Caesar died than the Queen of England should be confused with the fact that England has a Queen (Ramsey 1927). \n\nAccording to some authors, this categorial distinction is actually\nreflected in the different sorts of expressions through which facts\nand events are referred to in ordinary language. In the terminology of\nVendler (1967), ‘Caesar’s death’ is a perfect nominal: the\nprocess of nominalization is complete and the expression can only be\nmodified by adjectival phrases (‘Caesar’s violent\ndeath’). By contrast, a that-clause such as ‘that\nCaesar died’, or a gerundive such as ‘Ceasar’s\ndying’, are imperfect nominals that still have “a verb\nalive and kicking inside them”: they can therefore tolerate\nauxiliaries and tenses (‘That Caesar would die’,\n‘Caesar’s having died’), adverbs (‘Ceasar’s dying\nviolently’), negation (‘Ceasar’s not dying’),\netc. With some qualifications (McCann 1979), the metaphysical\nhypothesis would be that, as a norm, perfect nominals stand for\nevents, whereas facts or states of affairs are the referents of\nimperfect nominals. \n\nSome philosophers, however, conceive of the link between events\nand facts as being much closer than this—close enough to justify\nassimilating the two categories (Wilson 1974; Tegtmeier 2000) or at\nleast treating both as species of the same “state of\naffairs” genus (Chisholm 1970). This has two main\nconsequences. On the one hand, because facts corresponding to\nnon-equivalent propositions are distinct, events conceived of as facts or fact-like particulars\nare fine-grained entities that cannot be freely re-described or\nre-identified under different conceptualizations: the fact that Caesar\ndied violently is different from the fact that he died, hence the\ndeath of Caesar and his violent death would be two different events\n(Chisholm 1970, 1971), as opposed to one and the same event under\ndifferent descriptions (Davidson 1969; Anscombe 1979). On the other hand, because\nlinguistic expressions of facts are semantically transparent, a\nFregean line of argument could be concocted to show instead that\nevents construed as facts are too coarse-grained, to the point of\nmelting into a single “big” entity (Davidson 1967a). (The\nargument is known as the “slingshot argument”\n(Barwise & Perry 1981).) \n\nOther philosophers have insisted on distinguishing events from facts but\nhave given accounts that effectively amount to an assimilation.\nThis is true especially of those theories that construe events as property\nexemplifications, i.e., exemplifications of properties\nby objects at times (Kim 1966; Martin 1969; Goldman\n1970; Taylor 1985; Hendrickson 2006). On such theories, events are individual entities.\nBut because they have a structure, a difference in any constituent is\nsufficient to yield a different event. In particular, a difference in\nthe relevant constitutive property is sufficient to distinguish events\nsuch as Caesar’s death, construed as Caesar’s exemplification of the\nproperty of dying, and Caesar’s violent death, construed as his\nexemplification of the property of dying violently (Kim 1976). Again, this\nmakes events virtually as fine-grained as facts. It bears emphasis,\nhowever, that this consequence is not intrinsic to the theory of events\nas property exemplifications. Both Caesar’s death and his violent death\ncould be construed as Caesar’s exemplification of one and the same\nproperty P, describable both as a dying and—with\ngreater accuracy—as a dying violently. Thus, even if\nconstrued as a structured complex, an event can be coarsely referred to\ninsofar as its names need not be sensitive to this structure (Bennett\n1988). In this way the distinction between events and facts can be\nreinstated in terms of a firm distinction between semantic and\nmetaphysical aspects (respectively) of the theory of event-descriptions. \n\nSimilar considerations apply to those theories that treat events as\nsituations, in the sense familiar from situation semantics (Barwise\n& Perry 1983). On such theories, events are construed as sets of\nfunctions from spatiotemporal locations to “situation\ntypes” defined as sequences of objects standing or failing to\nstand in a certain relation. But while the formal machinery delivers a\nfine-grained account, the algorithm for applying the machinery to\nnatural language sentences leaves room for flexibility. \n\nA third metaphysical category with which events have sometimes\nbeen contrasted is that of properties. If events are individuals, then\nthey are not properties, at least insofar as properties are construed as\nuniversals. Individuals exist or occur whereas universals\nrecur. However, some philosophers have taken very seriously the\nintuition that in some cases events may be said to recur, as when we\nsay that the sun rises every morning (Chisholm 1970; Johnson 1975; Brandl 1997, 2000). If\nso, then it is natural to think of events as being more similar to\nproperties than to individuals, similar enough to justify treating\nthem as a kind of property—e.g., as properties of\nmoments or intervals of time (Montague 1969), properties of\ncross-world classes of individuals (Lewis 1986a), or properties of\nsets of world segments (von Kutschera 1993). For instance, on the\nfirst of these accounts, the event of the sun’s rising is the property\nof being an interval during which the sun rises. As a characterization\nof event types, this would be uncontroversial and would allow one to\nconstrue particular events as tokens of the corresponding type. (One\nsuch construal would correspond to the above-mentioned conception of\nevents as property exemplifications.) But to conceive of events as\nuniversal properties is to go beyond this uncontroversial fact and to\nreject the existence of event tokens altogether, even when it comes to\n“particular” events such as the unique rising of the sun\nthat we witnessed this morning. Rather than an instance of the\nuniversal sun rising, such an event would be a universal in\nits own right, albeit a universal of such a restricted sort and of\nsuch a degree of singularity as to be instantiated only once. \n\nOne possible view about properties is that they are not universals\nbut rather particulars of a special sort—viz. abstract particulars\n(Stout 1923) or tropes (Williams 1953). According to this\nview, the redness of this apple is different from the redness of\nanything else, not because of its extreme singularity (other things\ncould agree with the apple colorwise) but because it is the redness of\nthis apple. It exists here and now, where and while the apple\nexists. Likewise, this morning’s rising of the sun would be\nnumerically different from (though qualitatively similar to) any other\nmorning’s rising of the sun. If so, then the view that events are\nproperties becomes compatible with the view that they are\nspatiotemporally located. An event would just be a particularized\nproperty located at some region of space-time (Bennett 1996). (Once\nagain, this conception is closely related to the conception of events\nas property exemplifications, although the term\n‘exemplification’ suggests a construal of properties as\nuniversals. Some authors actually identify the two conceptions\n(Bennett 1988); others reject the identification on account of the\ndifference between property instances and property exemplifications\n(Macdonald 1989).) \n\nA variant of the trope conception construes events as trope sequences\n(Campbell 1981). However, since tropes are particulars, a sequence of\ntropes at a place may itself be viewed as a trope, hence this variant is\nbest regarded as a specification of what sort of tropes events\nare. Similar remarks apply to those theories that construe events\nas relational tropes (Mertz 1996), or even as higher-order tropes\n(Moltmann 2013).  \n\nThe intuition that events are properties of times can also be\nfleshed out in terms of thinner metaphysical commitments, by construing\nevents simply as times cum description, i.e., as temporal instants or\nintervals during which certain statements hold (van Benthem 1983). On\nthis view, for example, this morning’s rising of the sun is identified\nby an ordered pair <i,φ> where i is the\nrelevant time interval (corresponding to the descriptor ‘this\nmorning’) and φ is the sentence ‘The sun rises’.\nOf course, this treatment does not do justice to some of the intuitions\nunderlying the prima facie commitments to events mentioned at the beginning—for\ninstance, events can be perceived but times cannot (Gibson 1975). But\nbecause of the availability of fully developed theories of intervals\nalong with fully developed interval-based semantics (Cresswell 1979;\nDowty 1979), and because of equally well worked-out traditional\ntheories of instants and instant-based semantics (Prior 1967), such\naccounts are especially attractive from a reductionist perspective. One might even want to construe events as spatiotemporal\nregions cum description, distinguishing e.g between this morning’s\nrising of the sun in London and its rising in Paris. \n\nThe link between events and times has, however, been explored also in the\nopposite direction. If events are assumed as a primitive\nontological category, then one may dispense with temporal instants or\nintervals and construe them as derived entities. The most classical\ntreatment of this sort proceeds by construing temporal instants as\nmaximal sets of pairwise simultaneous (or partially simultaneous)\nevents (Russell 1914; Whitehead 1929; Walker 1947), but other\ntreatments are possible. For example, it has been suggested that the\nmathematical connection between the way events are perceived to be\nordered and the underlying temporal dimension is essentially that of a\nfree construction (in the category-theoretic sense) of linear orderings\nfrom event orderings, induced by the binary relation x wholly\nprecedes y (Thomason 1989). Treatments such as these provide a\nreduction of time in terms of relations among events and are therefore\nespecially germane to a relational conception of time (and, more\ngenerally, of space-time). Modal variants (Forbes 1993) as well as\nmereological variants (Pianesi & Varzi 1996) of such views are also\navailable. \n\nPhilosophers who agree with a conception of events as particulars\ntypically distinguish different sorts of such particulars. A classic\ntypology distinguishes four sorts: activities, accomplishments,\nachievements, and states (Ryle 1949; Vendler 1957). An\nactivity, such as John’s walking uphill, is a homogeneous\nevent: its sub-events satisfy the same description as the activity\nitself, which has no natural finishing point or culmination. An\naccomplishment, such as John’s climbing the mountain, may have\na culmination, but is never homogeneous. An achievement, such\nas John’s reaching the top, is a culminating event (and is\ntherefore always instantaneous). And a state, such as John’s\nknowing the shortest way, is homogeneous and may extend over time, but\nit makes no sense to ask how long it took or whether it culminated.\nSometimes accomplishments and achievements are grouped together into a\nsingle category of performances (Kenny 1963). Sometimes\nachievements have also been called events tout court and all\nother events have been grouped together into a broadly understood\ncategory of temporally extended entities, called processes\n(Ingarden 1935); the word ‘eventuality’ may then\nbe used as a label covering both categories (Bach 1986). \n\nSome authors introduce aspectual considerations into the taxonomy,\ndrawing on Aristotle’s distinction between Energeia and\nKinêsis (Ackrill 1965). The idea is that different\nverbs describe different types of events: verbs with no continuous\nform (‘know’) correspond to states; verbs with continuous\nform for which the present continuous entails the past perfect\n(‘John is walking uphill’ entails ‘John walked\nuphill’) correspond to activities; and verbs for which the\npresent continuous entails the negation of the past perfect\n(‘John is climbing the mountain’ entails ‘John has\nnot (yet) climbed the mountain’, at least in the relevant\ncontext) correspond to performances (Mourelatos 1978). Several authors\nhave followed in these footsteps to develop linguistically\nsophisticated theories (Taylor 1977; Dowty 1979; Freed 1979; Roberts 1979; Bach\n1981; Galton 1984; Verkuyl 1989; Smith 1991; Kühl 2008), but the\nlegitimacy of drawing ontological categorizations from such linguistic\ndistinctions has been questioned (Gill 1993). \n\nOne may also want to distinguish between dynamic events, such\nas John’s walking, and static events, such as John’s resting under\na tree. According to some authors, the latter are not events proper\nbecause they do not involve any change (Ducasse 1926). In the most\nabstract construal, a change is an ordered pair of states of affairs: an initial state and an end state (von Wright 1963). More substantial accounts of\nevents as changes describe them as exemplifications of dynamic\nproperties, i.e., properties that an object has by virtue of a\n“movement” in some quality space (Quinton 1979; Lombard\n1979, 1986). However, the question of whether all events should be or\ninvolve changes of some sort is controversial (Montmarquet 1980;\nSteward 1997; Mellor 1998; Simons 2003) and it may be argued that it\nis ultimately a matter of stipulation—hence of little\nmetaphysical import (Casati & Varzi 2008). \n\nIf static events are admitted, the question arises of whether they\nshould be kept distinct from states (Parsons 1989). One plausible\nassumption is that the distinction between the static and the dynamic\naspects of the world is skew to the distinction between states and\nactivities. As there may be static activities, so there may be dynamic\nstates. Walking is a state of John’s that is dynamic, as opposed to his\nstate of resting, which is static. The walk itself is an activity of\nJohn’s that is dynamic, as opposed to the rest he took under a tree, which may be\nconsidered a static activity. \n\nPrima facie, actions are naturally categorized as a subclass\nof events, namely, animate events. Like all events, actions are said\nto occur or take place, not to exist, and their relation to time and\nspace is event-like as well: they have relatively clear beginnings and\nendings but unclear spatial boundaries, they appear to tolerate\nco-location, and they cannot be said to move from one place to another\nor to endure from one time to another, but rather extend in space and\ntime by having spatial as well as temporal parts (Thomson 1977).\nActions and events appear to be on a par in causal explanations,\ntoo: actions can be causes of which events are effects (Davidson\n1967b). Some authors, however, prefer to draw a distinction here and\nto treat actions as relations between agents and events,\nnamely as instances of the relation of ‘bringing about’\nthat may hold between an agent and an event (von Wright 1963; Chisholm\n1964; Bach 1980; Bishop 1983; Segerberg 1989), or perhaps the relation\n‘seeing to it that’ (Belnap and Perloff 1988; Tuomela and Sandu 1994; Horty 2001). On such\nviews, actions are not individuals unless relations are themselves\nconstrued as tropes. \n\nWhether or not actions are treated as events, one might be tempted\nto distinguish between actions proper (such as John’s raising of\nhis arm) and bodily movements (such as John’s arm rising), or\nbetween intentional actions (John’s walk) and\nunintentional ones (John’s falling into a hole). For some\nauthors, this is necessary in order to explain important facts of human\nbehavior (Montmarquet 1978; Hornsby 1980a,b; Searle 1983; Brand 1984; Mele\n1997). However, it has also been argued that such distinctions do not\npertain to metaphysics but rather to the conceptual apparatus by means\nof which we describe the realm of things that happen. On this view, an\narm raising is just an arm’s rising under a mentalistic description\n(Anscombe 1957, 1979; Sher 1973). \n\nA similar story applies to the distinction between mental\nevents (John’s decision to wear boots) and physical or\nphysiological events (such and such neurons firing). One may\nthink that this distinction is real insofar as the latter events are\nexpected to fall naturally into the nomological net of physical\ntheories whereas the former seem to escape it. But one may also want\nto resist this line of thought and maintain that the distinction\nbetween the mental and the physical concerns exclusively the\nvocabulary with which we describe what goes on. These options have\nimportant ramifications for various issues in the philosophy of\nmind—e.g., issues of mental causation (Heil & Mele 1993; Walter & Heckmann 2003; Gibb et al. 2013). If\nthe distinction between mental and physical events is ontologically\nsignificant, then the question arises of how these two sorts of event\ncausally interact with each other, leading to various forms of\nanomalous or nomological dualism (Foster 1991). By contrast, the claim\nthat the distinction is purely semantic is congenial to a monist\nposition, whether nomological or\nanomalous (Macdonald 1989). Anomalous monism has been popular\nespecially among philosophers who accept a particularist conception of\nevents as widely redescribable entities, for such a conception allows\none to accept the materialist claim that all events are physical\n(regardless of whether one describes them in mentalistic terms) while\nrejecting the seeming consequence that mental goings-on can be given\npurely physical explanations (precisely because only a physicalistic\nvocabulary is suited to such explanations) (Nagel 1965; Davidson 1970,\n1993). Some authors, however, have argued that this line of argument\nfalls prey to the charge of epiphenomenalism, to the effect that\nmental events would lack causal or explanatory powers altogether\n(Honderich 1982; Robinson 1982; Kim 1993; Campbell 1998, 2005) and on\nsuch matters the debate is still open. \n\nEvents are things that happen. In some cases, however, the same sort\nof prima facie evidence that suggests a realist attitude\ntowards such things might suggest a similar attitude towards things\nthat do not actually happen, including “negative actions”\nof various sorts (Danto 1966; Ryle 1973). We speak of John’s walk with\nthe same easiness with which we speak of the talk he did not deliver,\nthe nap he did not take, the party he failed to organize; we seem to\nquantify over such things, and we normally engage in causal talk that\nseems to refer explicitly to negative causes, as when we reason that\nJohn’s failure to turn off the gas caused an explosion, or that his\nomitting the cutlery from the wedding list made Mary angry. Some\nauthors take such evidence at face value, drawing a distinction at the\nontological level: a good inventory of the world ought to include\n“negative” events and actions along with ordinary,\n“positive” ones (Lee 1978; Vermazen 1985; De Swart 1996;\nPrzepiórkowski 1999; Higginbotham 2000; Mossel 2009; Silver 2018; Bernard & Champollion 2018). Others\ndissent: we often speak as though there were such things, but\ndeep down we want our words to be interpreted in such a way as to\navoid ontological commitment. Thus, either we are just engaging in\nmere counterfactual speculations, or else the putative negative events\nare just ordinary, positive events under a negative description:\n‘John’s omitting the cutlery from the wedding list’, for\nexample, would refer to his drawing up a wedding list that contains no\ncutlery, ‘Mary’s not moving’ would describe Mary’s working\nhard to master urges to move, etc. (Mele 2005; Varzi 2008). The latter view can also be construed in metaphysical (as opposed to semantic) terms, at least in some cases: for x to omit to φ (refrain from φ-ing, etc.) at t would be for x to ensure, through their actual behavior, that they do not φ at t (Payton 2018).  \n\nThe case of negative causation is especially challenging, not last\nbecause of the link between causation and such ethical and legal\nmatters as passive killing (Bennett 1966; Green 1980; Foot 1984), good\nSamaritanism (Kleinig 1976) and, more generally, moral responsibility\n(Weinryb 1980; Walton 1980; Williams 1995; Fischer 1997; Clarke\n2014). Here it is also customary to introduce finer-grained\ndiscriminations, distinguishing e.g. several ways in which an agent\nmay fail to do something, e.g. (trying and) not\nsucceeding, refraining, omitting,\nand allowing (Brand 1971; Milanich 1984; Hall 1984; Bach\n2010). At least with regard to some such ways, it is very tempting to\nendorse a realist ontology. If so, the difficulty naturally arises of\nhow and where to draw the line. For example, the realist about\nomissions will have to find a principled way of refraining from\ntreating all omissions, including non-salient ones, as causes\n(Gorr 1979; Lewis 1986b, 2004; Thomson 2003; Menzies 2004; McGrath 2005; Sartorio\n2009; Bernstein 2014). On the other hand, the antirealist will have to explain how one\ncan account for such causal talk while holding on to the view that\nevery causal situation develops from “positive factors\nalone” (Armstrong 1999). Some would insist that every alleged\ncase of negative causation can be described in terms of positive\ncausation (Laliberté 2013). Others—the\nmajority—would resist ontological commitment by recasting the\nlogical structure of the relevant causal claims in suitable ways,\ne.g. as causal statements about events that are counterfactually\ndescribed (Hunt 2005), or as “quasi-causal” claims about\nwhat would have been a cause if the omitted event had happened (Dowe\n2001), or as mere causal explanations in which the explanans does not\nstand to the explanandum as cause to effect (Beebee 2004; Varzi\n2007; Lombard & Hudson, in press). \n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, one finds a prima facie\ncommitment to events in various aspects of human perception, action,\nlanguage, and thought. The main line of argument offered to back up this\ncommitment, however, comes from considerations of logical form. Not\nonly does ordinary talk involve explicit reference to and\nquantification over events, as when one says that John’s walk\nwas pleasant or that two explosions were heard last night.\nOrdinary talk also seems to involve several ways of adverting to\nevents implicitly. Adverbial modification is a standard example\n(Reichenbach 1947). We say that Brutus stabbed Caesar with a knife. If\nthis statement is taken to assert that a certain three-place relation\nobtains among Brutus, Caesar, and a knife, then it is hard to explain\nwhy the statement entails that Brutus stabbed Caesar (a statement that\ninvolves a different, two-place relation) (Kenny 1963). By contrast,\nif we take our statement to assert that a certain event occurred\n(namely, a stabbing of Caesar by Brutus)\nand that it had a certain property (namely, of being done\nwith a knife), then the entailment is straightforward (Davidson\n1967a).  These reasons do not constitute a proof that there are such\nentities as events. But they are telling insofar as one is interested\nin an account of how it is that certain statements mean what they\nmean, where the meaning of a statement is at least in part determined\nby its logical relations to other statements. For another example, it\nhas been argued that singular causal statements cannot be analyzed in\nterms of a causal connective (essentially for reasons having to do\nwith the above-mentioned slingshot argument) but rather require that\ncausation be treated as a binary relation holding between individual\nevents (Davidson 1967b). A third example involves the semantics of\nperceptual reports with naked infinitive complements, as in\n‘John saw Mary cry’, which is analyzed as ‘John saw\nan event which was a crying by Mary’ (Higginbotham 1983; Vlach\n1983; Gisborne 2010). Still a fourth example involves the logical form\nof statements with plural subjects, such as ‘John and Mary\nlifted the piano (together)’, which is analyzed as reporting,\nnot the exploits of a “plural object”, but rather an event\ninvolving more than one agent (Higginbotham & Schein 1986; Schein\n1993; Lasersohn 1995; Landman 1996, 2000). Many more such arguments\nhave been offered, also by authors working within different programs\nin linguistics (Parsons 1990; Peterson 1997; Rothstein 1998; Link 1998;\nHigginbotham et al. 2000; Tenny & Pustejovsky 2000;\nPietroski 2005; van Lambalgen & Hamm 2005; Robering 2014). \n\nOn the other hand, some philosophers have been dissatisfied with this\nsort of “existential proof” and have argued instead that\nall talk that seems to involve explicit or implicit reference to or\nquantification over events can be paraphrased so as to avoid the\ncommitment. For example, it has been argued that a term such as\n‘John’s walk’ goes proxy for the corresponding statement\n‘John walked’ (Geach 1965), so to say that John’s walk was\npleasant is just to say that John walked pleasantly. Similar\nparaphrases have been offered to deal with the case of explicit\nquantifier-phrases such as ‘two explosions’ as well as\nwith the implicit event quantification that lies behind\nadverb-dropping inferences (Clark 1970; Fulton 1979), singular causal\nstatements (Horgan 1978, 1982; Wilson 1985, Needham 1988, 1994, Mellor\n1991, 1995), and so on. On the face of it, it appears that questions\nof logical form leave the existential issue undecided, at least\ninsofar as an event-committing analysis automatically turns into an\neliminativist paraphrase when read in the opposite direction (and vice\nversa). \n\nAnother issue that appears to be undecided concerns so-called identity\ncriteria for events, which has been the focus of an intense debate\n(Bradie 1983; Pfeifer 1989; Mackie 1997).  Is John’s walk the\nsame event as his pleasant walk? Was Brutus’s stabbing of Caesar\nthe same event as his killing of Caesar? Was it the same as the\nviolent assassination of Caesar? Some philosophers take these to be\nmetaphysical questions—questions whose answers call for adequate\nidentity criteria, which must be provided before we are allowed to\ntake our event talk seriously. In this sense, different conceptions of\nevents tend to suggest different answers, and widely varying ones. At\none extreme we find the radical “unifiers”, who take\nevents to be as coarse-grained as ordinary objects (Quine 1985; Lemmon\n1967); at the other the radical “multipliers”, who take\nevents to be as fine-grained as facts (Kim 1966; Goldman 1971); and\nin between several moderate variants (Davidson 1969; Davis 1970;\nThalberg 1971; Thomson 1971; Brand 1977; Cleland 1991; Engel 1994;\nJones 2013). Other philosophers, however, regard questions of identity\nto be first and foremost semantic questions—questions about the\nway we talk and about what we say. No metaphysical theory, it is said,\ncan settle the semantics of ordinary event talk, hence there is no way\nof determining the truth or falsity of an event identity statement\nexclusively on the basis of one’s metaphysical views. Which\nevents a statement speaks of depends heavily (more heavily than with\nordinary material objects) on local context and unprincipled\nintuitions (Bennett 1988). If so, then the whole identity issue is\nundecidable, since one is demanding metaphysical answers to questions\nthat are in large part semantical.","contact.mail":"achille.varzi@columbia.edu","contact.domain":"columbia.edu"}]
