Pure set theory\ndeals exclusively with sets, so the only sets under consideration are\nthose whose members are also sets. The theory of the\nhereditarily-finite sets, namely those finite sets whose\nelements are also finite sets, the elements of which are also finite,\nand so on, is formally equivalent to arithmetic. So, the essence of\nset theory is the study of infinite sets, and therefore it can be\ndefined as the mathematical theory of the actual—as opposed to\npotential—infinite.\n\nThe notion of set is so simple that it is usually introduced\ninformally, and regarded as self-evident. In set theory, however, as\nis usual in mathematics, sets are given axiomatically, so their\nexistence and basic properties are postulated by the appropriate\nformal axioms. The axioms of set theory imply the existence of a\nset-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can be\nconstrued as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allows\none to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. Thus, set theory\nhas become the standard foundation for mathematics, as every\nmathematical object can be viewed as a set, and every theorem of\nmathematics can be logically deduced in the Predicate Calculus from\nthe axioms of set theory.\n\nBoth aspects of set theory, namely, as the mathematical science of\nthe infinite, and as the foundation of mathematics, are of\nphilosophical importance.\n\nSet theory, as a separate mathematical discipline, begins in the\nwork of Georg Cantor. One might say that set theory was born in late\n1873, when he made the amazing discovery that the linear continuum,\nthat is, the real line, is not countable, meaning that its points\ncannot be counted using the natural numbers. So, even though the set\nof natural numbers and the set of real numbers are both infinite,\nthere are more real numbers than there are natural numbers, which\nopened the door to the investigation of the different sizes of\ninfinity. See the entry on the\n early development of set theory\n for a discussion of the origin of\nset-theoretic ideas and their use by different mathematicians and\nphilosophers before and around Cantor’s time. According to Cantor, two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same size, or\ncardinality, if they are bijectable, i.e., the elements of\n\\(A\\) can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of\n\\(B\\). Thus, the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers and the set\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of real numbers have different cardinalities. In 1878\nCantor formulated the famous Continuum Hypothesis (CH), which\nasserts that every infinite set of real numbers is either countable,\ni.e., it has the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), or has the same\ncardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). In other words, there are only two\npossible sizes of infinite sets of real numbers. The CH is the most\nfamous problem of set theory. Cantor himself devoted much effort to\nit, and so did many other leading mathematicians of the first half of\nthe twentieth century, such as Hilbert, who listed the CH as the first\nproblem in his celebrated list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems\npresented in 1900 at the Second International Congress of\nMathematicians, in Paris. The attempts to prove the CH led to major\ndiscoveries in set theory, such as the theory of constructible sets,\nand the forcing technique, which showed that the CH can neither be\nproved nor disproved from the usual axioms of set theory. To this day,\nthe CH remains open. Early on, some inconsistencies, or paradoxes, arose from a naive\nuse of the notion of set; in particular, from the deceivingly natural\nassumption that every property determines a set, namely the set of\nobjects that have the property. One example is Russell’s\nParadox, also known to Zermelo:   consider the property of sets of not being members of\nthemselves. If the property determines a set, call it \\(A\\), then \\(A\\) is\na member of itself if and only if \\(A\\) is not a member of\nitself.  Thus, some collections, like the collection of all sets, the\ncollection of all ordinals numbers, or the collection of all cardinal\nnumbers, are not sets. Such collections are called proper\nclasses. In order to avoid the paradoxes and put it on a firm footing, set\ntheory had to be axiomatized. The first axiomatization was due to\nZermelo (1908) and it came as a result of the need to spell out the\nbasic set-theoretic principles underlying his proof of Cantor’s\nWell-Ordering Principle. Zermelo’s axiomatization avoids Russell’s\nParadox by means of the Separation axiom, which is formulated as\nquantifying over properties of sets, and thus it is a second-order\nstatement. Further work by Skolem and Fraenkel led to the\nformalization of the Separation axiom in terms of formulas of\nfirst-order, instead of the informal notion of property, as well as to\nthe introduction of the axiom of Replacement, which is also formulated\nas an axiom schema for first-order formulas (see next section). The\naxiom of Replacement is needed for a proper development of the theory\nof transfinite ordinals and cardinals, using transfinite recursion\n(see Section 3). It is also needed to\nprove the existence of such simple sets as the set of hereditarily\nfinite sets, i.e., those finite sets whose elements are finite, the\nelements of which are also finite, and so on; or to prove basic\nset-theoretic facts such as that every set is contained in a\ntransitive set, i.e., a set that contains all elements of its elements\n(see Mathias 2001 for the weaknesses of Zermelo set theory). A further\naddition, by von Neumann, of the axiom of Foundation, led to the\nstandard axiom system of set theory, known as the Zermelo-Fraenkel\naxioms plus the Axiom of Choice, or ZFC. Other axiomatizations of set theory, such as those of von\nNeumann-Bernays-Gödel (NBG), or Morse-Kelley (MK), allow also for\na formal treatment of proper classes. ZFC is an axiom system formulated in first-order logic with\nequality and with only one binary relation symbol \\(\\in\\) for\nmembership. Thus, we write \\(A\\in B\\) to express that \\(A\\) is a member of\nthe set \\(B\\). See the \n Supplement on Basic Set Theory\n \n for further details. See also the \n Supplement on Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory\n  for a formalized version of the axioms and further comments. We\nstate below the axioms of ZFC informally. Extensionality: If two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have\nthe same elements, then they are equal. Null Set: There exists a set, denoted by\n\\({\\varnothing}\\) and called the empty set, which has no\nelements. Pair: Given any sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), there\nexists a set, denoted by \\(\\{ A,B\\}\\), which contains \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as its\nonly elements. In particular, there exists the set \\(\\{ A\\}\\) which has\n\\(A\\) as its only element. Power Set: For every set \\(A\\) there exists a\nset, denoted by \\(\\mathcal{P}(A)\\) and called the power set of\n\\(A\\), whose elements are all the subsets of \\(A\\). Union: For every set \\(A\\), there exists a set,\ndenoted by \\(\\bigcup A\\) and called the union of \\(A\\), whose\nelements are all the elements of the elements of \\(A\\). Infinity: There exists an infinite set. In\nparticular, there exists a set \\(Z\\) that contains \\({\\varnothing}\\) and\nsuch that if \\(A\\in Z\\), then \\(\\bigcup\\{ A, \\{ A\\}\\}\\in Z\\). Separation: For every set \\(A\\) and every given\nproperty, there is a set containing exactly the elements of \\(A\\) that\nhave that property. A property is given by a formula\n\\(\\varphi\\) of the first-order language of set theory. Thus, Separation is not a single axiom but an axiom schema, that\nis, an infinite list of axioms, one for each formula\n\\(\\varphi\\). Replacement: For every given definable\nfunction with domain a set \\(A\\), there is a set whose elements are\nall the values of the function. Replacement is also an axiom schema, as definable functions are\ngiven by formulas. Foundation: Every non-empty set \\(A\\) contains\nan \\(\\in\\)-minimal element, that is, an element such that no element of\n\\(A\\) belongs to it. These are the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or ZF. The\naxioms of Null Set and Pair follow from the other ZF axioms, so they\nmay be omitted. Also, Replacement implies Separation. Finally, there is the Axiom of Choice (AC): Choice: For every set \\(A\\) of\npairwise-disjoint non-empty sets, there exists a set that contains\nexactly one element from each set in \\(A\\). The AC was, for a long time, a controversial axiom. On the one\nhand, it is very useful and of wide use in mathematics. On the other\nhand, it has rather unintuitive consequences, such as the\nBanach-Tarski Paradox, which says that the unit ball can be\npartitioned into finitely-many pieces, which can then be rearranged to\nform two unit balls. The objections to the axiom arise from the fact\nthat it asserts the existence of sets that cannot be explicitly\ndefined. But Gödel’s 1938 proof of its consistency, relative to\nthe consistency of ZF, dispelled any suspicions left about it. The Axiom of Choice is equivalent, modulo ZF, to the\nWell-ordering Principle, which asserts that every set can be\nwell-ordered, i.e., it can be linearly ordered so that every non-empty\nsubset has a minimal element. Although not formally necessary, besides the symbol \\(\\in\\) one\nnormally uses for convenience other auxiliary defined symbols. For\nexample, \\(A\\subseteq B\\) expresses that \\(A\\) is a subset of\n\\(B\\), i.e., every member of \\(A\\) is a member of \\(B\\). Other symbols are\nused to denote sets obtained by performing basic operations, such as\n\\(A\\cup B\\), which denotes the union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), i.e., the\nset whose elements are those of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); or \\(A\\cap B\\), which\ndenotes the intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), i.e., the set whose\nelements are those common to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The ordered pair\n\\((A,B)\\) is defined as the set \\(\\{ \\{ A\\},\\{ A,B\\}\\}\\). Thus, two\nordered pairs \\((A,B)\\) and \\((C,D)\\) are equal if and only if \\(A=C\\) and\n\\(B=D\\). And the Cartesian product \\(A\\times B\\) is defined as\nthe set of all ordered pairs \\((C,D)\\) such that \\(C\\in A\\) and \\(D\\in\nB\\). Given any formula \\(\\varphi(x,y_1,\\ldots ,y_n)\\), and sets\n\\(A,B_1,\\ldots ,B_n\\), one can form the set of all those elements of \\(A\\)\nthat satisfy the formula \\(\\varphi(x,B_1,\\ldots ,B_n)\\). This set is\ndenoted by \\(\\{ a\\in A: \\varphi(a,B_1,\\ldots ,B_n)\\}\\). In ZF one can\neasily prove that all these sets exist. See the\n Supplement on Basic Set Theory\nfor further discussion. In ZFC one can develop the Cantorian theory of transfinite (i.e.,\ninfinite) ordinal and cardinal numbers. Following the definition given\nby Von Neumann in the early 1920s, the ordinal numbers, or\nordinals, for short, are obtained by starting with the empty\nset and performing two operations: taking the immediate successor, and\npassing to the limit. Thus, the first ordinal number is\n\\({\\varnothing}\\). Given an ordinal \\(\\alpha\\), its immediate\nsuccessor, denoted by \\(\\alpha +1\\), is the set \\(\\alpha \\cup \\{\n\\alpha \\}\\). And given a non-empty set \\(X\\) of ordinals such that for\nevery \\(\\alpha \\in X\\) the successor \\(\\alpha +1\\) is also in \\(X\\), one\nobtains the limit ordinal \\(\\bigcup X\\). One shows that every\nordinal is (strictly) well-ordered by \\(\\in\\), i.e., it is linearly\nordered by \\(\\in\\) and there is no infinite \\(\\in\\)-descending\nsequence. Also, every well-ordered set is isomorphic to a unique\nordinal, called its order-type. Note that every ordinal is the set of its predecessors. However,\nthe class \\(ON\\) of all ordinals is not a set. Otherwise, \\(ON\\) would be\nan ordinal greater than all the ordinals, which is impossible. The\nfirst infinite ordinal, which is the set of all finite ordinals, is\ndenoted by the Greek letter omega (\\(\\omega\\)). In ZFC, one identifies\nthe finite ordinals with the natural numbers. Thus, \\({\\varnothing}=0\\),\n\\(\\{ {\\varnothing}\\}=1\\), \\(\\{ {\\varnothing}, \\{ {\\varnothing}\\}\\}=2\\),\netc., hence \\(\\omega\\) is just the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural\nnumbers. One can extend the operations of addition and multiplication of\nnatural numbers to all the ordinals. For example, the ordinal \\(\\alpha\n+\\beta\\) is the order-type of the well-ordering obtained by\nconcatenating a well-ordered set of order-type \\(\\alpha\\) and a\nwell-ordered set of order-type \\(\\beta\\). The sequence of ordinals,\nwell-ordered by \\(\\in\\), starts as follows 0, 1, 2,…, \\(n\\),…, \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega+1\\),\n\\(\\omega+2\\),…, \\(\\omega +\\omega\\),…, \\(n\\cdot \\omega\\),\n…, \\(\\omega \\cdot \\omega\\),…, \\(\\omega^n\\), …,\n\\(\\omega^\\omega\\), … The ordinals satisfy the principle of transfinite\ninduction: suppose that \\(C\\) is a class of ordinals such that\nwhenever \\(C\\) contains all ordinals \\(\\beta\\) smaller than some ordinal\n\\(\\alpha\\), then \\(\\alpha\\) is also in \\(C\\). Then the class \\(C\\) contains\nall ordinals. Using transfinite induction one can prove in ZFC (and\none needs the axiom of Replacement) the important principle of\ntransfinite recursion, which says that, given any definable\nclass-function \\(G:V\\to V\\), one can define a class-function \\(F:ON\\to V\\)\nsuch that \\(F(\\alpha)\\) is the value of the function \\(G\\) applied to the\nfunction \\(F\\) restricted to \\(\\alpha\\). One uses transfinite recursion,\nfor example, in order to define properly the arithmetical operations\nof addition, product, and exponentiation on the ordinals. Recall that an infinite set is countable if it is\nbijectable, i.e., it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence, with\n\\(\\omega\\). All the ordinals displayed above are either finite or\ncountable. But the set of all finite and countable ordinals is also an\nordinal, called \\(\\omega_1\\), and is not countable. Similarly, the set\nof all ordinals that are bijectable with some ordinal less than or\nequal to \\(\\omega_1\\) is also an ordinal, called \\(\\omega_2\\), and is not\nbijectable with \\(\\omega_1\\), and so on. A cardinal is an ordinal that is not bijectable with any\nsmaller ordinal. Thus, every finite ordinal is a cardinal, and\n\\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), etc. are also cardinals. The\ninfinite cardinals are represented by the letter aleph (\\(\\aleph\\)) of\nthe Hebrew alphabet, and their sequence is indexed by the ordinals. It\nstarts like this \\(\\aleph_0\\), \\(\\aleph_1\\), \\(\\aleph_2\\), …, \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\),\n\\(\\aleph_{\\omega +1}\\), …, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega +\\omega}\\), …,\n\\(\\aleph_{\\omega^2}\\), …, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega^\\omega}\\), …,\n\\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\), …, \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_2}\\), … Thus, \\(\\omega=\\aleph_0\\), \\(\\omega_1=\\aleph_1\\), \\(\\omega_2=\\aleph_2\\),\netc. For every cardinal there is a bigger one, and the limit of an\nincreasing sequence of cardinals is also a cardinal. Thus, the class\nof all cardinals is not a set, but a proper class. An infinite cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is called regular if it is\nnot the union of less than \\(\\kappa\\) smaller cardinals. Thus,\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) is regular, and so are all infinite successor cardinals,\nsuch as \\(\\aleph_1\\). Non-regular infinite cardinals are called\nsingular. The first singular cardinal is \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), as\nit is the union of countably-many smaller cardinals, namely\n\\(\\aleph_\\omega =\\bigcup_{n<\\omega} \\aleph_n\\). The cofinality of a cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), denoted by\n\\(cf(\\kappa)\\) is the smallest cardinal \\(\\lambda\\) such that \\(\\kappa\\) is\nthe union of \\(\\lambda\\)-many smaller ordinals. Thus,\n\\(cf(\\aleph_\\omega)=\\aleph_0\\). By the AC (in the form of the Well-Ordering Principle), every set\n\\(A\\) can be well-ordered, hence it is bijectable with a unique\ncardinal, called the cardinality of \\(A\\). Given two cardinals\n\\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\lambda\\), the sum \\(\\kappa +\\lambda\\) is defined as the\ncardinality of the set consisting of the union of any two disjoint\nsets, one of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) and one of cardinality\n\\(\\lambda\\). And the product \\(\\kappa \\cdot \\lambda\\) is defined as the\ncardinality of the Cartesian product \\(\\kappa \\times \\lambda\\). The\noperations of sum and product of infinite cardinals are trivial, for\nif \\(\\kappa\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) are infinite cardinals, then \\(\\kappa\n+\\lambda =\\kappa \\cdot \\lambda = maximum \\{ \\kappa ,\\lambda\\}\\). In contrast, cardinal exponentiation is highly non-trivial, for\neven the value of the simplest non-trivial infinite exponential,\nnamely \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), is not known and cannot be determined in ZFC\n(see below). The cardinal \\(\\kappa^\\lambda\\) is defined as the\ncardinality of the Cartesian product of \\(\\lambda\\) copies of \\(\\kappa\\);\nequivalently, as the cardinality of the set of all functions from\n\\(\\lambda\\) into \\(\\kappa\\). König’s theorem asserts that\n\\(\\kappa^{cf(\\kappa)}>\\kappa\\), which implies that the cofinality of\nthe cardinal \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), whatever that cardinal is, must be\nuncountable. But this is essentially all that ZFC can prove about the\nvalue of the exponential \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\). In the case of exponentiation of singular cardinals, ZFC has a lot\nmore to say. In 1989, Shelah proved the remarkable result that if\n\\(\\aleph_\\omega\\) is a strong limit, that is,\n\\(2^{\\aleph_n}<\\aleph_\\omega\\), for every \\(n<\\omega\\), then\n\\(2^{\\aleph_\\omega}<\\aleph_{\\omega_4}\\) (see Shelah (1994)). The\ntechnique developed by Shelah to prove this and similar theorems, in\nZFC, is called pcf theory (for possible\ncofinalities), and has found many applications in other areas of\nmathematics. A posteriori, the ZF axioms other than\nExtensionality—which needs no justification because it just\nstates a defining property of sets—may be justified by their use\nin building the cumulative hierarchy of sets. Namely, in ZF\nwe define using transfinite recursion the class-function that assigns\nto each ordinal \\(\\alpha\\) the set \\(V_\\alpha\\), given as follows: \\(V_0={\\varnothing}\\) \\(V_{\\alpha +1}=\\mathcal{P}(V_\\alpha)\\) \\(V_\\alpha =\\bigcup_{\\beta <\\alpha}V_\\beta\\), whenever \\(\\alpha\\) is\na limit ordinal. The Power Set axiom is used to obtain \\(V_{\\alpha +1}\\) from\n\\(V_\\alpha\\). Replacement and Union allow one to form \\(V_\\alpha\\) for\n\\(\\alpha\\) a limit ordinal. Indeed, consider the function that assigns\nto each \\(\\beta <\\alpha\\) the set \\(V_\\beta\\). By Replacement, the\ncollection of all the \\(V_\\beta\\), for \\(\\beta <\\alpha\\), is a set,\nhence the Union axiom applied to that set yields \\(V_\\alpha\\). The axiom\nof Infinity is needed to prove the existence of \\(\\omega\\) and hence of\nthe transfinite sequence of ordinals. Finally, the axiom of Foundation\nis equivalent, assuming the other axioms, to the statement that every\nset belongs to some \\(V_\\alpha\\), for some ordinal \\(\\alpha\\). Thus, ZF\nproves that the set theoretic universe, denoted by \\(V\\), is the union\nof all the \\(V_\\alpha\\), \\(\\alpha\\) an ordinal. The proper class \\(V\\), together with the \\(\\in\\) relation, satisfies\nall the ZFC axioms, and is thus a model of ZFC. It is the intended\nmodel of ZFC, and one may think of ZFC as providing a description of\n\\(V\\), a description however that is highly incomplete, as we shall see\nbelow. One important property of \\(V\\) is the so-called\nReflection Principle. Namely, for each formula\n\\(\\varphi(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\), ZFC proves that there exists some \\(V_\\alpha\\)\nthat reflects it, that is, for every\n\\(a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\in V_\\alpha\\), \\(\\varphi(a_1,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) holds in \\(V\\) if and only if\n\\(\\varphi(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)\\) holds in \\(V_\\alpha\\). Thus, \\(V\\) cannot be characterized by any sentence, as any sentence\nthat is true in \\(V\\) must be also true in some initial segment\n\\(V_\\alpha\\). In particular, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable, for\notherwise ZFC would prove that, for unboundedly many ordinals\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(V_\\alpha\\) is a model of ZFC, contradicting Gödel’s\nsecond incompleteness theorem (see\n Section 5.2). The Reflection Principle encapsulates the essence of ZF set theory,\nfor as shown by Levy (1960), the axioms of Extensionality, Separation,\nand Foundation, together with the Reflection Principle, formulated as\nthe axiom schema asserting that each formula is reflected by some set\nthat contains all elements and all subsets of its elements (note that\nthe \\(V_\\alpha\\) are like this), is equivalent to ZF. Every mathematical object may be viewed as a set. For example, the\nnatural numbers are identified with the finite ordinals, so\n\\(\\mathbb{N}=\\omega\\). The set of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) may be defined\nas the set of equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers under\nthe equivalence relation \\((n, m)\\equiv (n',m')\\) if and only if\n\\(n+m'=m+n'\\). By identifying every natural number \\(n\\) with the\nequivalence class of the pair \\((n,0)\\), one may extend naturally the\noperations of sum and product of natural numbers to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) (see\nEnderton (1977) for details, and Levy (1979) for a different\nconstruction). Further, one may define the rationals \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) as\nthe set of equivalence classes of pairs \\((n,m)\\) of integers, where\n\\(m\\ne 0\\), under the equivalence relation \\((n,m)\\equiv (n',m')\\) if and\nonly if \\(n\\cdot m'=m\\cdot n'\\). Again, the operations \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\)\non \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) may be extended naturally to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Moreover,\nthe ordering \\(\\leq_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\) on the rationals is given by: \\(r\n\\leq_{\\mathbb{Q}} s\\) if and only if there exists \\(t\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\)\nsuch that \\(s=r+t\\). The real numbers may be defined as Dedekind cuts of\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), namely, a real number is given by a pair \\((A,B)\\) of\nnon-empty disjoint sets such that \\(A\\cup B=\\mathbb{Q}\\), and\n\\(a\\leq_{\\mathbb{Q}}b\\) for every \\(a\\in A\\) and \\(b\\in B\\). One can then\nextend again the operations of \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\) on \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), as\nwell as the ordering \\(\\leq_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\), to the set of real numbers\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Let us emphasize that it is not claimed that, e.g., real numbers\nare Dedekind cuts of rationals, as they could also be defined\nusing Cauchy sequences, or in other different ways. What is important,\nfrom a foundational point of view, is that the set-theoretic version\nof \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), together with the usual algebraic operations,\nsatisfies the categorical axioms that the real numbers satisfy, namely\nthose of a complete ordered field. The metaphysical question of what\nthe real numbers really are is irrelevant here. Algebraic structures can also be viewed as sets, as any \\(n\\)-ary\nrelation on the elements of a set \\(A\\) can be viewed as a set of\n\\(n\\)-tuples \\((a_1,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) of elements of \\(A\\). And any \\(n\\)-ary\nfunction \\(f\\) on \\(A\\), with values on some set \\(B\\), can be seen as the\nset of \\(n+1\\)-tuples \\(((a_1,\\ldots ,a_n),b)\\) such that \\(b\\) is the value\nof \\(f\\) on \\((a_1,\\ldots ,a_m)\\). Thus, for example, a group is\njust a triple \\((A, +, 0)\\), where \\(A\\) is a non-empty set, \\(+\\) is a\nbinary function on \\(A\\) that is associative, \\(0\\) is an element of \\(A\\)\nsuch that \\(a+0=0+a=a\\), for all \\(a\\in A\\), and for every \\(a\\in A\\) there\nis an element of \\(A\\), denoted by \\(-a\\), such that\n\\(a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0\\). Also, a topological space is just a set\n\\(X\\) together with a topology \\(\\tau\\) on it, i.e., \\(\\tau\\) is a subset of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(X)\\) containing \\(X\\) and \\({\\varnothing}\\), and closed under\narbitrary unions and finite intersections. Any mathematical object\nwhatsoever can always be viewed as a set, or a proper class. The\nproperties of the object can then be expressed in the language of set\ntheory. Any mathematical statement can be formalized into the language\nof set theory, and any mathematical theorem can be derived, using the\ncalculus of first-order logic, from the axioms of ZFC, or from some\nextension of ZFC. It is in this sense that set theory provides a\nfoundation for mathematics. The foundational role of set theory for mathematics, while\nsignificant, is by no means the only justification for its study. The\nideas and techniques developed within set theory, such as infinite\ncombinatorics, forcing, or the theory of large cardinals, have turned\nit into a deep and fascinating mathematical theory, worthy of study by\nitself, and with important applications to practically all areas of\nmathematics. The remarkable fact that virtually all of mathematics can be\nformalized within ZFC, makes possible a mathematical study of\nmathematics itself. Thus, any questions about the existence of some\nmathematical object, or the provability of a conjecture or hypothesis\ncan be given a mathematically precise formulation. This makes\nmetamathematics possible, namely the mathematical study of\nmathematics itself. So, the question about the provability or\nunprovability of any given mathematical statement becomes a sensible\nmathematical question. When faced with an open mathematical problem or\nconjecture, it makes sense to ask for its provability or unprovability\nin the ZFC formal system. Unfortunately, the answer may be neither,\nbecause ZFC, if consistent, is incomplete. Gödel’s completeness theorem for first-order logic implies\nthat ZFC is consistent—i.e., no contradiction can be\nderived from it—if and only if it has a model. A model\nof ZFC is a pair \\((M,E)\\), where \\(M\\) is a non-empty set and \\(E\\) is a\nbinary relation on \\(M\\) such that all the axioms of ZFC are true when\ninterpreted in \\((M,E)\\), i.e., when the variables that appear in the\naxioms range over elements of \\(M\\), and \\(\\in\\) is interpreted as\n\\(E\\). Thus, if \\(\\varphi\\) is a sentence of the language of set theory\nand one can find a model of ZFC in which \\(\\varphi\\) holds, then its\nnegation \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) cannot be proved in ZFC. Hence, if one can\nfind a model of \\(\\varphi\\) and also a model of \\(\\neg \\varphi\\), then\n\\(\\varphi\\) is neither provable nor disprovable in ZFC, in which case we\nsay that \\(\\varphi\\) is undecidable in, or independent\nof, ZFC. In 1931, Gödel announced his striking incompleteness theorems,\nwhich assert that any reasonable formal system for mathematics is\nnecessarily incomplete. In particular, if ZFC is consistent, then\nthere are undecidable propositions in ZFC. Moreover, Gödel’s\nsecond incompleteness theorem implies that the formal (arithmetical)\nstatement \\(CON(ZFC)\\), which asserts that ZFC is consistent, while\ntrue, cannot be proved in ZFC. And neither can its negation. Thus,\n\\(CON(ZFC)\\) is undecidable in ZFC. If ZFC is consistent, then it cannot prove the existence of a model\nof ZFC, for otherwise ZFC would prove its own consistency. Thus, a\nproof of consistency or of undecidability of a given sentence\n\\(\\varphi\\) is always a relative consistency proof. That is,\none assumes that ZFC is consistent, hence it has a model, and then one\nconstructs another model of ZFC where the sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is\ntrue. We shall see several examples in the next sections. From Cantor and until about 1940, set theory developed mostly\naround the study of the continuum, that is, the real line\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The main topic was the study of the so-called regularity\nproperties, as well as other structural properties, of\nsimply-definable sets of real numbers, an area of mathematics that is\nknown as Descriptive Set Theory. Descriptive Set Theory is the study of the properties and structure\nof definable sets of real numbers and, more generally, of definable\nsubsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and other Polish spaces (i.e.,\ntopological spaces that are homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space), such as the Baire space\n\\(\\mathcal{N}\\) of all functions \\(f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\), the\nspace of complex numbers, Hilbert space, and separable Banach\nspaces. The simplest sets of real numbers are the basic open sets\n(i.e., the open intervals with rational endpoints), and their\ncomplements. The sets that are obtained in a countable number of steps\nby starting from the basic open sets and applying the operations of\ntaking the complement and forming a countable union of previously\nobtained sets are the Borel sets. All Borel sets are\nregular, that is, they enjoy all the classical regularity\nproperties. One example of a regularity property is the\nLebesgue measurability: a set of reals is Lebesgue measurable\nif it differs from a Borel set by a null set, namely, a set that can\nbe covered by sets of basic open intervals of arbitrarily-small total\nlength. Thus, trivially, every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable, but\nsets more complicated than the Borel ones may not be. Other classical\nregularity properties are the Baire property (a set of reals\nhas the Baire property if it differs from an open set by a meager set,\nnamely, a set that is a countable union of sets that are not dense in\nany interval), and the perfect set property (a set of reals\nhas the perfect set property if it is either countable or contains a\nperfect set, namely, a nonempty closed set with no isolated points). In ZFC one\ncan prove that there exist non-regular sets of reals, but the AC is\nnecessary for this (Solovay 1970). The analytic sets, also called \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_1\\), are\nthe continuous images of Borel sets. And the co-analytic, or\n\\(\\mathbf{\\Pi}^1_1\\), sets are the complements of analytic sets. Starting from the analytic (or the co-analytic) sets and applying\nthe operations of projection (from the product space \\(\\mathbb{R}\\times\n\\mathcal{N}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) and complementation, one obtains the\nprojective sets. The projective sets form a hierarchy of\nincreasing complexity. For example, if \\(A\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\times\n\\mathcal{N}\\) is co-analytic, then the projection \\(\\{ x\\in \\mathbb{R}:\n\\exists y\\in \\mathcal{N}((x,y)\\in A)\\}\\) is a projective set in the\nnext level of complexity above the co-analytic sets. Those sets are\ncalled \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\), and their complements are called\n\\(\\mathbf{\\Pi}^1_2\\). The projective sets come up very naturally in mathematical\npractice, for it turns out that a set \\(A\\) of reals is projective if\nand only if it is definable in the structure \\[\\mathcal{R}=(\\mathbb{R}, +,\\cdot ,\\mathbb{Z}).\\] That is, there is a first-order formula \\(\\varphi ( x, y_1,\\ldots,\ny_n)\\) in the language for the structure such that for some \\(r_1,\\ldots\n,r_n\\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\[A=\\{ x\\in \\mathbb{R}: \\mathcal{R}\\models \\varphi(x,r_1,\\ldots\n,r_n)\\}.\\] ZFC proves that every analytic set, and therefore every co-analytic\nset, is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also proves\nthat every analytic set has the perfect set property. But the perfect\nset property for co-analytic sets implies that the first uncountable\ncardinal, \\(\\aleph_1\\), is a large cardinal in the constructible\nuniverse \\(L\\) (see Section 7), namely a\nso-called inaccessible cardinal (see\n Section 10), \nwhich implies that one cannot prove in ZFC that every\nco-analytic set has the perfect set property. The theory of projective sets of complexity greater than\nco-analytic is completely undetermined by ZFC. For example, in \\(L\\)\nthere is a \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) set that is not Lebesgue measurable\nand does not have the Baire property, whereas if Martin’s axiom holds\n(see Section 11), every such set has those\nregularity properties. There is, however, an axiom, called the axiom\nof Projective Determinacy, or PD, that is consistent with ZFC, modulo\nthe consistency of some large cardinals (in fact, it follows from the existence of some large cardinals), and implies that all\nprojective sets are regular. Moreover, PD settles essentially all\nquestions about the projective sets. See the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for further details. A regularity property of sets that subsumes all other classical\nregularity properties is that of being determined. For\nsimplicity, we shall work with the Baire space \\(\\mathcal{N}\\). Recall\nthat the elements of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) are functions \\(f:\\mathbb{N} \\to\n\\mathbb{N}\\), that is, sequences of natural numbers of length\n\\(\\omega\\). The space \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is topologically equivalent (i.e.,\nhomeomorphic) to the set of irrational points of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). So,\nsince we are interested in the regularity properties of subsets of\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\), and since countable sets, such as the set of rationals,\nare negligible in terms of those properties, we may as well work with\n\\(\\mathcal{N}\\), instead of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Given \\(A\\subseteq \\mathcal{N}\\), the game\nassociated to \\(A\\), denoted by \\({\\mathcal G}_A\\), has two players, I and\nII, who play alternatively \\(n_i\\in \\mathbb{N}\\): I plays \\(n_0\\), then II\nplays \\(n_1\\), then I plays \\(n_2\\), and so on. So, at stage \\(2k\\), player\nI plays \\(n_{2k}\\) and at stage \\(2k+1\\), player II plays \\(n_{2k+1} \\). We\nmay visualize a run of the game as follows: After infinitely many moves, the two players produce an infinite\nsequence \\(n_0, n_1,n_2,\\ldots\\) of natural numbers. Player I wins the\ngame if the sequence belongs to \\(A\\). Otherwise, player II wins. The game \\({\\mathcal{G}}_A\\) is determined if\nthere is a winning strategy for one of the players. A winning\nstrategy for one of the players, say for player II, is a function\n\\(\\sigma\\) from the set of finite sequences of natural numbers into\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\), such that if the player plays according to this\nfunction, i.e., she plays \\(\\sigma (n_0,\\ldots ,n_{2k})\\) at the \\(k\\)-th\nturn, she will always win the game, no matter what the other player\ndoes. We say that a subset \\(A\\) of \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is determined if\nand only if the game \\({\\mathcal{G}}_A\\) is determined. One can prove in ZFC—and the use of the AC is\nnecessary—that there are non-determined sets. Thus, the\nAxiom of Determinacy (AD), which asserts that all subsets of\n\\(\\mathcal{N}\\) are determined, is incompatible with the AC. But Donald\nMartin proved, in ZFC, that every Borel set is determined. Further, he\nshowed that if there exists a large cardinal called measurable (see\n Section 10), then even the analytic sets are\ndetermined. The axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD) asserts\nthat every projective set is determined. It turns out that PD implies\nthat all projective sets of reals are regular, and Woodin has shown\nthat, in a certain sense, PD settles essentially all questions about\nthe projective sets. Moreover, PD seems to be necessary for\nthis. Another axiom, \\(AD^{L(\\Bbb R )}\\), asserts that the AD holds in\n\\(L(\\Bbb R)\\), which is the least transitive class that contains all the\nordinals and all the real numbers, and satisfies the ZF axioms (see\n Section 7). So, \\(AD^{L(\\Bbb R )}\\) implies that\nevery set of reals that belongs to \\(L(\\Bbb R)\\) is regular. Also, since\n\\(L(\\Bbb R)\\) contains all projective sets, \\(AD^{L(\\Bbb R )}\\) implies\nPD. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH), formulated by Cantor in 1878,\nasserts that every infinite set of real numbers has cardinality either\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) or the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Thus, the CH is\nequivalent to \\(2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_1\\). Cantor proved in 1883 that closed sets of real numbers have the\nperfect set property, from which it follows that every uncountable\nclosed set of real numbers has the same cardinality as\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Thus, the CH holds for closed sets. More than thirty\nyears later, Pavel Aleksandrov extended the result to all Borel sets,\nand then Mikhail Suslin to all analytic sets. Thus, all analytic sets\nsatisfy the CH. However, the efforts to prove that co-analytic sets\nsatisfy the CH would not succeed, as this is not provable in ZFC. In 1938 Gödel proved the consistency of the CH with\nZFC. Assuming that ZF is consistent, he built a model of ZFC, known as\nthe constructible universe, in which the CH holds. Thus, the\nproof shows that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZF together with the\nAC and the CH. Hence, assuming ZF is consistent, the AC cannot be\ndisproved in ZF and the CH cannot be disproved in ZFC. See the entry on the\n continuum hypothesis\n for the current status of the problem, including the\nlatest results by Woodin. Gödel’s constructible universe, denoted by \\(L\\), is defined by\ntransfinite recursion on the ordinals, similarly as \\(V\\), but at\nsuccessor steps, instead of taking the power set of \\(V_\\alpha\\) to\nobtain \\(V_{\\alpha +1}\\), one only takes those subsets of \\(L_\\alpha\\)\nthat are definable in \\(L_\\alpha\\), using elements of \\(L_\\alpha\\) as\nparameters. Thus, letting \\(\\mathcal{P}^{Def}(X)\\) to denote the set of\nall the subsets of \\(X\\) that are definable in the structure \\((X,\\in )\\)\nby a formula of the language of set theory, using elements of \\(X\\) as\nparameters of the definition, we let \\(L_0={\\varnothing}\\) \\(L_{\\alpha +1}=\\mathcal{P}^{Def}(L_\\alpha)\\) \\(L_\\lambda =\\bigcup_{\\alpha <\\lambda}L_\\alpha\\), whenever\n\\(\\lambda\\) is a limit ordinal. Then \\(L\\) is the union of all the \\(L_\\alpha\\), for \\(\\alpha\\) an\nordinal, i.e., \\(L=\\bigcup_{\\alpha \\in ON}L_\\alpha\\). Gödel showed that \\(L\\) satisfies all the ZFC axioms, and also\nthe CH. In fact, it satisfies the Generalized Continuum\nHypothesis (GCH), namely \\(2^{\\aleph_\\alpha}=\\aleph_{\\alpha +1}\\),\nfor every ordinal \\(\\alpha\\). The statement \\(V=L\\), called the axiom of constructibility,\nasserts that every set belongs to \\(L\\). It holds in \\(L\\), hence it is\nconsistent with ZFC, and implies both the AC and the GCH. The proper class \\(L\\), together with the \\(\\in\\) relation restricted\nto \\(L\\), is an inner model of ZFC, that is, a\ntransitive (i.e., it contains all elements of its elements)\nclass that contains all ordinals and satisfies all the ZFC axioms. It\nis in fact the smallest inner model of ZFC, as any other inner model\ncontains it. More generally, given any set \\(A\\), one can build the smallest\ntransitive model of ZF that contains \\(A\\) and all the ordinals in a\nsimilar manner as \\(L\\), but now starting with the transitive closure of\n\\(\\{A \\}\\), i.e., the smallest transitive set that contains \\(A\\), instead\nof \\({\\varnothing}\\). The resulting model, \\(L(A)\\), need not be however a\nmodel of the AC. One very important such model is \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\), the\nsmallest transitive model of ZF that contains all the ordinals and all\nthe real numbers. The theory of constructible sets owes much to the work of Ronald\nJensen. He developed the so-called fine structure theory of\n\\(L\\) and isolated some combinatorial principles, such as the diamond\n(\\(\\diamondsuit\\)) and square (\\(\\Box\\)), which can be used to carry out\ncomplicated constructions of uncountable mathematical objects. Fine\nstructure theory plays also an important role in the analysis of\nbigger \\(L\\)-like models, such as \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) or the inner models\nfor large cardinals (see \nSection 10.1). In 1963, twenty-five years after Gödel’s proof of the\nconsistency of the CH and the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF, Paul Cohen (1966)\nproved the consistency of the negation of the CH, and also of the negation of the AC, relative to the\nconsistency of ZF. Thus, if ZF is consistent, then the CH is\nundecidable in ZFC, and the AC is undecidable in ZF.  To achieve this, Cohen\ndevised a new and extremely powerful technique, called\nforcing, for expanding countable transitive models of ZF. Since the axiom \\(V=L\\) implies the AC and the CH, any model of the\nnegation of the AC or the CH must violate \\(V=L\\). So, let’s illustrate\nthe idea of forcing in the case of building a model for the negation\nof \\(V=L\\). We start with a transitive model \\(M\\) of ZFC, which we may\nassume, without loss of generality, to be a model of \\(V=L\\). To violate\n\\(V=L\\) we need to expand \\(M\\) by adding a new set \\(r\\) so that, in the\nexpanded model, \\(r\\) will be non-constructible. Since all\nhereditarily-finite sets are constructible, we aim to add an infinite\nset of natural numbers. The first problem we face is that \\(M\\) may\ncontain already all subsets of \\(\\omega\\). Fortunately, by the\nLöwenheim-Skolem theorem for first-order logic, \\(M\\) has a\ncountable elementary submodel \\(N\\). So, since we are only interested in\nthe statements that hold in \\(M\\), and not in \\(M\\) itself, we may as well\nwork with \\(N\\) instead of \\(M\\), and so we may assume that \\(M\\) itself is\ncountable. Then, since \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\omega)\\) is uncountable, there are\nplenty of subsets of \\(\\omega\\) that do not belong to \\(M\\). But,\nunfortunately, we cannot just pick any infinite subset \\(r\\) of \\(\\omega\\)\nthat does not belong to \\(M\\) and add it to \\(M\\). The reason is that \\(r\\)\nmay encode a lot of information, so that when added to \\(M\\), \\(M\\) is no\nlonger a model of ZFC, or it is still a model of \\(V=L\\). To avoid this,\none needs to pick \\(r\\) with great care. The idea is to pick \\(r\\)\ngeneric over \\(M\\), meaning that \\(r\\) is built from its finite\napproximations in such a way that it does not have any property that\nis definable in \\(M\\) and can be avoided. For example, by viewing \\(r\\) as\nan infinite sequence of natural numbers in the increasing order, the\nproperty of \\(r\\) containing only finitely-many even numbers can be\navoided, because given any finite approximation to \\(r\\)—i.e., any\nfinite increasing sequence of natural numbers—one can always\nextend it by adding more even numbers, so that at the end of the\nconstruction \\(r\\) will contain infinitely-many even numbers; while the\nproperty of containing the number 7 cannot be avoided, because when a\nfinite approximation to \\(r\\) contains the number 7, then it stays there\nno matter how the construction of \\(r\\) proceeds. Since \\(M\\) is\ncountable, there are such generic \\(r\\). Then the expanded model \\(M[r]\\),\nwhich includes \\(M\\) and contains the new set \\(r\\), is called a\ngeneric extension of \\(M\\). Since we assumed \\(M\\) is a\ntransitive model of \\(V=L\\), the model \\(M[r]\\) is just \\(L_\\alpha (r)\\),\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the supremum of the ordinals of \\(M\\). Then one can\nshow, using the forcing relation between finite\napproximations to \\(r\\) and formulas in the language of set theory\nexpanded with so-called names for sets in the generic\nextension, that \\(M[r]\\) is a model of ZFC and \\(r\\) is not constructible\nin \\(M[r]\\), hence the axiom of constructibility \\(V=L\\) fails. In general, a forcing extension of a model \\(M\\) is obtained by\nadding to \\(M\\) a generic subset \\(G\\) of some partially ordered set\n\\(\\mathbb{P}\\) that belongs to \\(M\\). In the above example, \\(\\mathbb{P}\\)\nwould be the set of all finite increasing sequences of natural\nnumbers, seen as finite approximations to the infinite sequence \\(r\\),\nordered by \\(\\subseteq\\); and \\(G\\) would be the set of all finite initial\nsegments of \\(r\\). In the case of the consistency proof of the negation of the CH, one\nstarts from a model \\(M\\) and adds \\(\\aleph_2\\) new subsets of \\(\\omega\\),\nso that in the generic extension the CH fails. In this case one needs\nto use an appropriate partial ordering \\(\\mathbb{P}\\) so that the\n\\(\\aleph_2\\) of \\(M\\) is not collapsed, i.e., it is the same as\nthe \\(\\aleph_2\\) of the generic extension, and thus the generic\nextension \\(M[G]\\) will satisfy the sentence that says that there are\n\\(\\aleph_2\\) real numbers. Besides the CH, many other mathematical conjectures and problems\nabout the continuum, and other infinite mathematical objects, have\nbeen shown undecidable in ZFC using the forcing technique. One important example is Suslin’s Hypothesis (SH). Cantor\nhad shown that every linearly ordered set \\(S\\) without endpoints that\nis dense (i.e., between any two different elements of \\(S\\) there is\nanother one), complete (i.e., every subset of \\(S\\) that is bounded\nabove has a supremum), and with a countable dense subset is isomorphic\nto the real line. Suslin conjectured that this is still true if one\nrelaxes the requirement of containing a countable dense subset to\nbeing ccc, i.e., every collection of pairwise-disjoint\nintervals is countable. In the early 1970s, Thomas Jech produced a\nconsistent counterexample using forcing, and Ronald Jensen showed that\na counterexample exists in \\(L\\). About the same time, Robert Solovay\nand Stanley Tennenbaum (1971) developed and used for the first time\nthe iterated forcing technique to produce a model where the SH holds,\nthus showing its independence from ZFC. In order to make sure that the\nSH holds in the generic extension, one needs to destroy all\ncounterexamples, but by destroying one particular counterexample one\nmay inadvertently create new ones, and so one needs to force again and\nagain; in fact one needs to go on for at least \\(\\omega_2\\)-many\nsteps. This is why a forcing iteration is needed. Among other famous mathematical problems that have been shown\nundecidable in ZFC thanks to the forcing technique, especially using\niterated forcing and sometimes combined with large cardinals, we may\nmention the Measure Problem and the Borel Conjecture in measure\ntheory, Kaplansky’s Conjecture on Banach algebras, and Whitehead’s\nProblem in group theory. As a result of 50 years of development of the forcing technique,\nand its applications to many open problems in mathematics, there are\nnow literally thousands of questions, in practically all areas of\nmathematics, that have been shown independent of ZFC. These include\nalmost all questions about the structure of uncountable sets. One\nmight say that the undecidability phenomenon is pervasive, to the\npoint that the investigation of the uncountable has been rendered\nnearly impossible in ZFC alone (see however Shelah (1994) for\nremarkable exceptions). This prompts the question about the truth-value of the statements\nthat are undecided by ZFC. Should one be content with them being\nundecidable? Does it make sense at all to ask for their truth-value?\nThere are several possible reactions to this. One is the skeptic’s\nposition: the statements that are undecidable in ZFC have no definite\nanswer; and they may even be inherently vague. Another, the common one\namong mathematicians, is Gödel’s position: the undecidability\nonly shows that the ZFC system is too weak to answer those questions,\nand therefore one should search for new axioms that once added to ZFC\nwould answer them. The search for new axioms has been known as\nGödel’s Program. See Hauser (2006) for a thorough\nphilosophical discussion of the Program, and also the entry on\n  large cardinals and determinacy\n for philosophical considerations on the justification\nof new axioms for set theory. A central theme of set theory is thus the search and classification\nof new axioms. These fall currently into two main types: the axioms of\nlarge cardinals and the forcing axioms. One cannot prove in ZFC that there exists a regular limit cardinal\n\\(\\kappa\\), for if \\(\\kappa\\) is such a cardinal, then \\(L_\\kappa\\) is a\nmodel of ZFC, and so ZFC would prove its own consistency,\ncontradicting Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem. Thus, the\nexistence of a regular limit cardinal must be postulated as a new\naxiom. Such a cardinal is called weakly inaccessible. If, in\naddition \\(\\kappa\\) is a strong limit, i.e., \\(2^\\lambda <\\kappa\\), for\nevery cardinal \\(\\lambda <\\kappa\\), then \\(\\kappa\\) is called\nstrongly inaccessible. A cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is strongly\ninaccessible if and only if it is regular and \\(V_\\kappa \\) is a model\nof ZFC. If the GCH holds, then every weakly inaccessible cardinal is\nstrongly inaccessible. Large cardinals are uncountable cardinals satisfying some\nproperties that make them very large, and whose existence cannot be\nproved in ZFC. The first weakly inaccessible cardinal is just the\nsmallest of all large cardinals. Beyond inaccessible cardinals there\nis a rich and complex variety of large cardinals, which form a linear\nhierarchy in terms of consistency strength, and in many cases also in\nterms of outright implication. See the entry on\n independence and large cardinals\n for more details. To formulate the next stronger large-cardinal notion, let us say\nthat a subset \\(C\\) of an infinite cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is closed\nif every limit of elements of \\(C\\) is also in \\(C\\); and is\nunbounded if for every \\(\\alpha <\\kappa\\) there exists\n\\(\\beta\\in C\\) greater than \\(\\alpha\\). For example, the set of limit\nordinals less than \\(\\kappa\\) is closed and unbounded. Also, a subset\n\\(S\\) of \\(\\kappa\\) is called stationary if it intersects every\nclosed unbounded subset of \\(\\kappa\\). If \\(\\kappa\\) is regular and\nuncountable, then the set of all ordinals less than \\(\\kappa\\) of\ncofinality \\(\\omega\\) is an example of a stationary set. A regular\ncardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is called Mahlo if the set of strongly\ninaccessible cardinals smaller than \\(\\kappa\\) is stationary. Thus, the\nfirst Mahlo cardinal is much larger than the first strongly\ninaccessible cardinal, as there are \\(\\kappa\\)-many strongly\ninaccessible cardinals smaller than \\(\\kappa\\). Much stronger large cardinal notions arise from considering strong\nreflection properties. Recall that the Reflection Principle\n (Section 4), which is provable in ZFC, asserts\nthat every true sentence (i.e., every sentence that holds in\n\\(V\\)) is true in some \\(V_\\alpha\\). A strengthening of this principle to\nsecond-order sentences yields some large cardinals. For example,\n\\(\\kappa\\) is strongly inaccessible if and only if every \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\)\nsentence (i.e., existential second-order sentence in the language of\nset theory, with one additional predicate symbol) true in any \nstructure of the form \\((V_\\kappa ,\\in, A)\\), where \\(A\\subseteq V_\\kappa\\), is true\nin some \\((V_\\alpha ,\\in ,A\\cap V_\\alpha)\\), with \\(\\alpha <\\kappa\\). The\nsame type of reflection, but now for \\(\\Pi^1_1\\) sentences (i.e.,\nuniversal second-order sentences), yields a much stronger large\ncardinal property of \\(\\kappa\\), called weak compactness. Every\nweakly compact cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is Mahlo, and the set of Mahlo\ncardinals smaller than \\(\\kappa\\) is stationary. By allowing reflection\nfor more complex second-order, or even higher-order, sentences one\nobtains large cardinal notions stronger than weak compactness. The most famous large cardinals, called measurable, were\ndiscovered by Stanisław Ulam in 1930 as a result of his solution\nto the Measure Problem. A (two-valued) measure, or\nultrafilter, on a cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is a subset \\(U\\) of\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(\\kappa)\\) that has the following properties: (i) the\nintersection of any two elements of \\(U\\) is in \\(U\\); (ii) if \\(X\\in U\\) and\n\\(Y\\) is a subset of \\(\\kappa\\) such that \\(X\\subseteq Y\\), then \\(Y\\in U\\);\nand (iii) for every \\(X\\subseteq\\kappa\\), either \\(X\\in U\\) or \\(\\kappa\n-X\\in U\\), but not both. A measure \\(U\\) is called\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete if every intersection of less than \\(\\kappa\\)\nelements of \\(U\\) is also in \\(U\\). And a measure is called\nnon-principal if there is no \\(\\alpha <\\kappa\\) that belongs\nto all elements of \\(U\\). A cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is called\nmeasurable if there exists a measure on \\(\\kappa\\) that is\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete and non-principal. Measurable cardinals can be characterized by elementary embeddings\nof the universe \\(V\\) into some transitive class \\(M\\). That such an\nembedding \\(j:V\\to M\\) is elementary means that \\(j\\) preserves\ntruth, i.e., for every formula \\(\\varphi (x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) of the\nlanguage of set theory, and every \\(a_1,\\ldots ,a_n\\), the sentence\n\\(\\varphi (a_1,\\ldots ,a_n)\\) holds in \\(V\\) if and only if \\(\\varphi\n(j(a_1),\\ldots ,j(a_n))\\) holds in \\(M\\). It turns out that a cardinal\n\\(\\kappa\\) is measurable if and only if there exists an elementary\nembedding \\(j:V\\to M\\), with \\(M\\) transitive, so that \\(\\kappa\\) is the\nfirst ordinal moved by \\(j\\), i.e., the first ordinal such that\n\\(j(\\kappa)\\ne \\kappa\\). We say that \\(\\kappa\\) is the critical\npoint of \\(j\\), and write \\(crit(j)=\\kappa\\). The embedding \\(j\\) is\ndefinable from a \\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal measure on \\(\\kappa\\),\nusing the so-called ultrapower construction. Conversely, if\n\\(j:V\\to M\\) is an elementary embedding, with \\(M\\) transitive and\n\\(\\kappa=crit(j)\\), then the set \\(U=\\{ X\\subseteq \\kappa:\\kappa\\in\nj(X)\\}\\) is a \\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal ultrafilter on\n\\(\\kappa\\). A measure \\(U\\) obtained in this way from \\(j\\) is called\nnormal. Every measurable cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is weakly compact, and there are\nmany weakly compact cardinals smaller than \\(\\kappa\\). In fact, below\n\\(\\kappa\\) there are many cardinals that are totally\nindescribable, i.e., they reflect all sentences, of any\ncomplexity, and in any higher-order language. If \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable and \\(j:V\\to M\\) is given by the ultrapower\nconstruction, then \\(V_\\kappa \\subseteq M\\), and every sequence of\nlength less than or equal to \\(\\kappa\\) of elements of \\(M\\) belongs to\n\\(M\\). Thus, \\(M\\) is quite similar to \\(V\\), but it cannot be \\(V\\)\nitself. Indeed, a famous theorem of Kenneth Kunen shows that there\ncannot be any elementary embedding \\(j:V\\to V\\), other than the trivial\none, i.e., the identity. All known proofs of this result use the Axiom\nof Choice, and it is an outstanding important question if the axiom is\nnecessary. Kunen’s Theorem opens the door to formulating large\ncardinal notions stronger than measurability by requiring that \\(M\\) is\ncloser to \\(V\\). For example, \\(\\kappa\\) is called strong if for every\nordinal \\(\\alpha\\) there exists an elementary embedding \\(j:V\\to M\\), for\nsome \\(M\\) transitive, such that \\(\\kappa =crit(j)\\) and \\(V_\\alpha\n\\subseteq M\\). Another important, and much stronger large cardinal notion is\nsupercompactness. A cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) is supercompact if for\nevery \\(\\alpha\\) there exists an elementary embedding \\(j:V\\to M\\), with\n\\(M\\) transitive and critical point \\(\\kappa\\), so that\n\\(j(\\kappa)>\\alpha\\) and every sequence of elements of \\(M\\) of length\n\\(\\alpha\\) belongs to \\(M\\). Woodin cardinals fall between strong and supercompact. Every\nsupercompact cardinal is Woodin, and if \\(\\delta\\) is Woodin, then\n\\(V_\\delta\\) is a model of ZFC in which there is a proper class of\nstrong cardinals. Thus, while a Woodin cardinal \\(\\delta\\) need not be\nitself very strong—the first one is not even weakly\ncompact—it implies the existence of many large cardinals in\n\\(V_\\delta\\). Beyond supercompact cardinals we find the extendible\ncardinals, the huge, the super huge, etc. Kunen’s theorem about the non-existence of a non-trivial elementary\nembedding \\(j:V\\to V\\) actually shows that there cannot be an elementary\nembedding \\(j:V_{\\lambda +2}\\to V_{\\lambda +2}\\) different from the\nidentity, for any \\(\\lambda\\). The strongest large cardinal notions not known to be inconsistent,\nmodulo ZFC, are the following: There exists an elementary embedding \\(j:V_{\\lambda +1}\\to\nV_{\\lambda +1}\\) different from the identity. There exists an elementary embedding \\(j:L(V_{\\lambda +1})\\to\nL(V_{\\lambda +1})\\) different from the identity. Large cardinals form a linear hierarchy of increasing consistency\nstrength. In fact they are the stepping stones of the interpretability\nhierarchy of mathematical theories. See the entry on\n independence and large cardinals\n for more details. Given any sentence \\(\\varphi\\), exactly\none the following three possibilities holds about the theory ZFC plus\n\\(\\varphi\\): ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is inconsistent. ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is equiconsistent with ZFC. ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is equiconsistent with ZFC plus the existence of\nsome large cardinal. Thus, large cardinals can be used to prove that a given sentence\n\\(\\varphi\\) does not imply another sentence \\(\\psi\\), modulo ZFC, by\nshowing that ZFC plus \\(\\psi\\) implies the consistency of some large\ncardinal, whereas ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is consistent assuming the\nexistence of a smaller large cardinal, or just assuming the\nconsistency of ZFC. In other words, \\(\\psi\\) has higher consistency\nstrength than \\(\\varphi\\), modulo ZFC. Then, by Gödel’s second\nincompleteness theorem, ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) cannot prove \\(\\psi\\),\nassuming ZFC plus \\(\\varphi\\) is consistent. As we already pointed out, one cannot prove in ZFC that large\ncardinals exist. But everything indicates that their existence not\nonly cannot be disproved, but in fact the assumption of their\nexistence is a very reasonable axiom of set theory. For one thing,\nthere is a lot of evidence for their consistency, especially for those\nlarge cardinals for which it is possible to construct an inner\nmodel. An inner model of ZFC is a transitive proper class that\ncontains all the ordinals and satisfies all ZFC axioms. Thus, \\(L\\) is\nthe smallest inner model, while \\(V\\) is the largest. Some large\ncardinals, such as inaccessible, Mahlo, or weakly-compact, may exist\nin \\(L\\). That is, if \\(\\kappa\\) has one of these large cardinal\nproperties, then it also has the property in \\(L\\). But some large\ncardinals cannot exist in \\(L\\). Indeed, Scott (1961) showed that if\nthere exists a measurable cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), then \\(V\\ne L\\). It is\nimportant to notice that \\(\\kappa\\) does belong to \\(L\\), since \\(L\\)\ncontains all ordinals, but it is not measurable in \\(L\\) because a\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal measure on \\(\\kappa\\) cannot exist\nthere. If \\(\\kappa\\) is a measurable cardinal, then one can construct an\n\\(L\\)-like model in which \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable by taking a\n\\(\\kappa\\)-complete non-principal and normal measure \\(U\\) on \\(\\kappa\\),\nand proceeding as in the definition of \\(L\\), but now using \\(U\\) as an\nadditional predicate. The resulting model, called \\(L[U]\\), is an inner\nmodel of ZFC in which \\(\\kappa\\) is measurable, and in fact \\(\\kappa\\) is\nthe only measurable cardinal. The model is canonical, in the sense\nthat any other normal measure witnessing the measurability of \\(\\kappa\\)\nwould yield the same model, and has many of the properties of \\(L\\). For\ninstance, it has a projective well ordering of the reals, and it\nsatisfies the GCH. Building similar \\(L\\)-like models for stronger large cardinals, such\nas strong, or Woodin, is much harder. Those models are of the form\n\\(L[E]\\), where \\(E\\) is a sequence of extenders, each extender\nbeing a system of measures, that encode the relevant elementary\nembeddings. The largest \\(L\\)-like inner models for large cardinals that have\nbeen obtained so far can contain Woodin limits of Woodin cardinals\n(Neeman 2002). However, building an \\(L\\)-like model for a supercompact\ncardinal is still a challenge. The supercompact barrier seems to be\nthe crucial one, for Woodin has shown that for a kind of \\(L\\)-like\ninner model for a supercompact cardinal, which he calls the\nUltimate-\\(L\\), all stronger large cardinals that may exist in \\(V\\), such as\nextendible, huge, I1, etc. would also exist in the model. The\nconstruction of Ultimate-\\(L\\) is still incomplete, and it is not clear\nyet that it will succeed, for it rests upon some technical hypotheses\nthat need to be confirmed. The existence of large cardinals has dramatic consequences, even\nfor simply-definable small sets, like the projective sets of real\nnumbers. For example, Solovay (1970) proved, assuming that there\nexists a measurable cardinal, that all \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) sets of\nreals are Lebesgue measurable and have the Baire property, which\ncannot be proved in ZFC alone. And Shelah and Woodin (1990) showed\nthat the existence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies that\nthe theory of \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\), even with real numbers as parameters,\ncannot be changed by forcing, which implies that all sets of real\nnumbers that belong to \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) are regular. Further, under a\nweaker large-cardinal hypothesis, namely the existence of infinitely\nmany Woodin cardinals, Martin and Steel (1989) proved that every\nprojective set of real numbers is determined, i.e., the axiom of PD\nholds, hence all projective sets are regular. Moreover, Woodin showed\nthat the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, plus a\nmeasurable cardinal above all of them, implies that every set of reals\nin \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\) is determined, i.e., the axiom \\(AD^{L(\\mathbb{R})}\\)\nholds, hence all sets of real numbers that belong to \\(L(\\mathbb{R})\\),\nand therefore all projective sets, are regular. He also showed that\nWoodin cardinals provide the optimal large cardinal assumptions by\nproving that the following two statements: There are infinitely many Woodin cardinals. \\(AD^{L({\\Bbb R})}\\). are equiconsistent, i.e., ZFC plus 1 is consistent if and only if\nZFC plus 2 is consistent. See the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for more details and related results. Another area in which large cardinals play an important role is the\nexponentiation of singular cardinals. The so-called Singular\nCardinal Hypothesis (SCH) completely determines the behavior of\nthe exponentiation for singular cardinals, modulo the exponentiation\nfor regular cardinals. The SCH follows from the GCH, and so it holds\nin \\(L\\). A consequence of the SCH is that if\n\\(2^{\\aleph_n}<\\aleph_\\omega\\), for all finite \\(n\\), then\n\\(2^{\\aleph_{\\omega}}=\\aleph_{\\omega +1}\\). Thus, if the GCH holds for\ncardinals smaller than \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), then it also holds at\n\\(\\aleph_\\omega\\). The SCH holds above the first supercompact cardinal\n(Solovay). But Magidor (1977) showed that, remarkably, assuming the\nexistence of large cardinals it is possible to build a model of ZFC\nwhere the GCH first fails at \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), hence the SCH\nfails. Large cardinals stronger than measurable are actually needed\nfor this. In contrast, however, ZFC alone suffices to prove that if\nthe SCH holds for all cardinals smaller than \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\), then\nit also holds for \\(\\aleph_{\\omega_1}\\). Moreover, if the SCH holds for\nall singular cardinals of countable cofinality, then it holds for all\nsingular cardinals (Silver). Forcing axioms are axioms of set theory that assert that certain\nexistential statements are absolute between the universe \\(V\\) of all\nsets and its (ideal) forcing extensions, i.e., some existential\nstatements that hold in some forcing extensions of \\(V\\) are already\ntrue in \\(V\\). The first forcing axiom was formulated by Donald Martin\nin the wake of the Solovay-Tennenbaum proof of the consistency of\nSuslin’s Hypothesis, and is now known as Martin’s Axiom\n(MA). Before we state it, let us say that a partial ordering\nis a non-empty set \\(P\\) together with a binary relation \\(\\leq\\) on \\(P\\)\nthat is reflexive and transitive. Two elements, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), of \\(P\\)\nare called compatible if there exists \\(r\\in P\\) such that\n\\(r\\leq p\\) and \\(r\\leq q\\). An antichain of \\(P\\) is a subset of\n\\(P\\) whose elements are pairwise-incompatible. A partial ordering \\(P\\)\nis called ccc if every antichain of \\(P\\) is countable. A\nnon-empty subset \\(G\\) of \\(P\\) is called a filter if (i) every\ntwo elements of \\(G\\) are compatible, and (ii) if \\(p\\in G\\) and \\(p\\leq\nq\\), then also \\(q\\in G\\). Finally, a subset \\(D\\) of \\(P\\) is called\ndense if for every \\(p\\in P\\) there is \\(q\\in D\\) such that\n\\(q\\leq p\\). MA asserts the following: For every ccc partial ordering \\(P\\) and every set \\(\\{ D_\\alpha\n:\\alpha <\\omega_1\\}\\) of dense subsets of \\(P\\), there exists a filter\n\\(G\\subseteq P\\) that is generic for the set, i.e., \\(G\\cap\nD_\\alpha \\ne {\\varnothing}\\), for all \\(\\alpha\n<\\omega_1\\). Martin and Solovay (1970) proved that MA is consistent with ZFC,\nusing iterated forcing with the ccc property. At first sight, MA may\nnot look like an axiom, namely an obvious, or at least reasonable,\nassertion about sets, but rather like a technical statement about ccc\npartial orderings. It does look more natural, however, when expressed\nin topological terms, for it is simply a generalization of the\nwell-known Baire Category Theorem, which asserts that in every compact\nHausdorff topological space the intersection of countably-many dense\nopen sets is non-empty. Indeed, MA is equivalent to: In every compact Hausdorff ccc topological space, the intersection\nof \\(\\aleph_1\\)-many dense open sets is non-empty. MA has many different equivalent formulations and has been used\nvery successfully to settle a large number of open problems in other\nareas of mathematics. For example, it implies Suslin’s Hypothesis and\nthat every \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^1_2\\) set of reals is Lebesgue measurable\nand has the Baire property. It also implies the negation of the CH and\nthat \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) is a regular cardinal, but it does not decide what\ncardinal it is. See Fremlin (1984) for many more consequences of MA\nand other equivalent formulations. In spite of this, the status of MA\nas an axiom of set theory is still unclear. Perhaps the most natural\nformulation of MA, from a foundational point of view, is in terms of\nreflection. Writing HC for the set of hereditarily-countable sets\n(i.e., countable sets whose elements are countable, the elements of\nwhich are also countable, and so on), MA is equivalent to: For every ccc partial ordering \\(P\\), if an existential statement\nabout \\(HC\\) holds in an (ideal) generic extension of \\(V\\) obtained by\nforcing with \\(P\\), then the statement is true, i.e., it holds in\n\\(V\\). In other words, if a set having a property that depends only on\nsets in \\(HC\\) exists in some (ideal) generic extension of \\(V\\) obtained\nby forcing with a ccc partial ordering, then a set with that property\nalready exists in \\(V\\). The notion of ideal generic extension of \\(V\\) can be made precise in\nterms of so-called Boolean-valued models, which provide an alternative\nversion of forcing. Much stronger forcing axioms than MA were introduced in the 1980s,\nsuch as J. Baumgartner’s Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), and the\nstronger Martin’s Maximum (MM) of Foreman, Magidor, and\nShelah (1988), which is essentially the strongest possible forcing\naxiom. Both the PFA and MM are consistent relative to the existence of\na supercompact cardinal. The PFA asserts the same as MA, but for\npartial orderings that have a property weaker than the ccc, called\nproperness, introduced by Shelah. And MM asserts the same for\nthe wider class of partial orderings that, when forcing with them, do\nnot destroy stationary subsets of \\(\\omega_1\\). Strong forcing axioms, such as the PFA and MM imply that all\nprojective sets of reals are determined (PD), and have many other\nstrong consequences in infinite combinatorics. Notably, they imply\nthat the cardinality of the continuum is \\(\\aleph_2\\).","contact.mail":"joan.bagaria@icrea.cat","contact.domain":"icrea.cat"}]
