During his period at the University of Jena\n(1787–94), Reinhold proclaimed the need for a more\n“scientific” and systematic presentation of the Critical\nphilosophy, one based upon a single, self-evident first principle. In\nan effort to satisfy this need, he expounded his own “Elementary\nPhilosophy” in a series of influential works between 1789 and\n1791. Though Reinhold’s Elementary Philosophy was much criticized, his\ncall for a more coherent and systematic exposition of transcendental\nidealism exercised a profound influence upon the subsequent development\nof post-Kantian idealism and spurred others (such as J. G. Fichte) to\nseek a philosophical first principle even more\n“fundamental” than Reinhold’s own “Principle of\nConsciousness.” After moving to the University of Kiel, Reinhold\nbecame an adherent, first of Fichte’s Wissenschaftslehre and\nthen of C. G. Bardili’s “rational realism,” before finally\nproposing a novel “linguistic” approach to philosophical\nproblems.\n\n\n\nKarl Leonhard Reinhold was born in Vienna October 26, 1757 (though\nmany older sources erroneously give 1758 as his year of his birth). He\nstudied at the Jesuit Seminary in Vienna for a year, until the order\nwas suppressed in 1773, at which time he entered the Barnabite\nseminary. Following his ordination, he became a Barnabite monk and\nserved for several years as a parish priest and teacher of philosophy.\nReinhold’s first publications were book reviews and short essays in\npopular newspapers, in which he showed himself to be a zealous advocate\nof Josephite reforms and an enthusiastic exponent of radical\nEnlightenment and religious toleration. \n\nIn 1783 Reinhold moved to Leipzig and converted to Protestantism. He\nalso became a Freemason and a member of the Illuminati, and he\nremained an active Freemason until the end of his life. Possessed of a\nrestless, inquiring spirit, Reinhold’s early intellectual trajectory\nled him from orthodox Catholicism, to reformed Catholicism, to\nmaterialism and atheism, and then to Leibnizianism and to Humean\nskepticism. Yet he always remained true to the ideal of\n“Enlightenment,” at least as he understood that ideal, and\nhe never ceased to insist that philosophy ought to make a practical\ndifference in the world. For all of his forays into the most technical\nand arcane philosophical debates and issues, he never wavered in his\ninsistence that true “popularity” must remain the goal of\nphilosophy, and that the ultimate test of any system is its capacity\nfor convincing everyone of its truth. Enlightenment, for Reinhold, was\nno abstract pursuit of truth, but a program of religious, moral,\nsocial, and political reform. Coupled with this commitment to\npopularity, was a pedagogic zeal to do everything in his power to\nspread the message of popular Enlightenment—whether in its\nmaterialist, its neo-Leibnizian, its skeptical, its Kantian, its\nFichtean, its Bardilian, or its distinctively “Reinholdian”\nform—as widely and as effectively as possible. \n\nIn 1784, after studying philosophy for a semester in Leipzig,\nReinhold moved to Weimar, where he became a confidant (and son-in-law)\nof C. M. Wieland and a regular contributor to Wieland’s widely read\nDer Teutsche Merkur. It was in this journal that his famous\nseries of “Letters on the Kantian Philosophy” began to\nappear in 1786. It is with these “Letters,” which were\nsubsequently published in revised and expanded form in two volumes,\nthat Reinhold’s name enters the history of philosophy. What Reinhold\nfound in Kant is clearly expressed in the first of his many private\nletters to the latter: namely, a way to resolve the debilitating\nconflict between faith and reason, “superstition” and\n“disbelief,” “heart” and “head.”\nAnd this is precisely the aspect of the new, Critical philosophy that\nis emphasized in his Letters on the Kantian Philosophy: not\nKant’s radical new account of space and time, nor his audacious effort\nto provide a transcendental deduction of the pure categories of the\nunderstanding, but rather the conclusions and implications of the\n“transcendental dialectic.” \n\nKantianism was recommended by Reinhold, above all, for its allegedly\nsalubrious and enlightened practical consequences, particular\nwith respect to religion and morality. It was not for nothing that\nReinhold described this new philosophy to readers of Die Teutscher\nMerkur as “the gospel of pure reason.” Rational belief\nin God, in the immortality of the soul, in the reality of free will:\nsuch are the articles of this new “gospel”—a gospel\npromulgated, everyone agreed, far more effectively and popularly by\nReinhold than by Kant himself. Even Kant professed to be charmed by\nReinhold’s effort and gratified by his success. \n\nOn the strength of his newfound fame as author of the\nLetters, Reinhold was invited to be the inaugural occupant of\nthe first professorial chair devoted exclusively to the new Kantian\nphilosophy, and thus he began lecturing at the University of Jena in\n1787. First at Jena, and then later at the University of Kiel, Reinhold\nproved to be an immensely popular and influential teacher, much beloved\nby his students. (Of the approximately 860 students enrolled in Jena in\nthe Spring Semester of 1794, 600 were enrolled in Reinhold’s three\nlecture courses.) Indeed, Reinhold was largely responsible for making\nJena the center of German philosophy, which it remained for the next\nseveral decades. \n\nIn his published Letters on the Kantian Philosophy Reinhold\nhad excused himself from the task of presenting and examining the\ntheoretical foundations of Kant’s Critical philosophy, in order to\nconcentrate instead upon the practical consequences of the same. But\nonce he arrived at Jena he set himself to the former task, the\nsurprising result of which was not so much the popularization of\nanother aspect of Kant’s thought as a first, historically momentous\neffort to revise and recast the theoretical\nfoundations of the new transcendental idealism in a new, allegedly more\ncoherent and systematic form. The fruit of this revisionist effort was\nReinhold’s own “Elementary Philosophy” (see below), which,\nthough only a passing phase in Reinhold’s own development as a\nphilosopher, remains his most substantial and effective contribution to\nthe historical development of German Idealism. \n\nReinhold’s Elementary Philosophy is most fully expounded in three\nworks he published in rapid succession during his tenure at the\nUniversity of Jena: Versuch einer neuen Theorie des menschlichen\nVorstellungsvermögens [Attempt a New Theory of the Human\nPower of Representation] (1789), Beyträge zur\nBerichtigung bisheriger Missverständnisse der Philosophen,\nErster Band [Contributions toward Correcting the Previous\nMisunderstandings of Philosophers, Vol. I] (1790), and Ueber\ndas Fundament des philosophischen Wissens [On the Foundation\nof Philosophical Knowledge] (1791). \n\nReinhold’s radical revision and implicit critique of orthodox\nKantianism exercised an immediate and immense influence upon his\ncontemporaries, and particularly upon the philosopher who followed him\nat Jena in 1794, namely Johann Gottlieb Fichte. But though Fichte was\nthoroughly convinced by Reinhold’s arguments for the incompleteness of\nKant’s own presentation of the Critical philosophy and by his demand\nfor an immediately certain “first principle” of the same,\nhe was not satisfied with Reinhold’s own efforts to satisfy these\ndemands and, in the Aenesidemus review and elsewhere, made\npublic his own criticisms of the Elementary Philosophy and of\nReinhold’s “Principle of Consciousness.” For a few years\nfollowing Fichte’s arrival in Jena and Reinhold’s transfer to Kiel, the\ntwo men engaged in a wide-ranging and stimulating philosophical\ncorrespondence, though they never met. \n\nThe final upshot of Reinhold’s Auseinandersetzung with\nFichte was the former’s recantation of his own Elementary Philosophy\nand transference of his allegiance to the standpoint of Fichte’s\nWissenschaftslehre. This conversion was made public in early\n1798, in a lengthy review essay in the Allgemeine\nLiteratur-Zeitung of Fichte’s recent writings, and it was\nelaborated the following year in Reinhold’s Ueber die Paradoxien\nder neuesten Philosophie [Concerning the Paradoxes of the most\nrecent Philosophy], in which he explicitly acknowledged the\ninadequacy of his own Principle of Consciousness as the foundation of\nphilosophy as a whole and endorsed Fichte’s proposal for a more\n“active” first principle (the Tathandlung, or\n“fact-act” of the I’s self-positing), which would be\ncapable of fully integrating theoretical with practical reason, as well\nas uniting theoretical and practical philosophy. \n\nAs his contribution to the Atheism Controversy of 1798/99, which led\nto Fichte’s departure from Jena, Reinhold published a pamphlet in\nFichte’s defense. However, it was not long before he grew dissatisfied\nwith what he perceived to be the “one-sidedness” of\nFichte’s philosophy—and indeed, of transcendental idealism as a\nwhole—and publicly sought some “third way,” which could\nreconcile the opposing positions of Fichte and Jacobi (whose\ncontribution to the Atheism Controversy was an influential “Open\nletter,” criticizing philosophy in general and Fichte’s\ntranscendental idealism in particular as “nihilism.”) This\neffort on Reinhold’s part to mediate the differences between the\ntranscendental idealist “philosopher of freedom” (Fichte)\nand the common-sense “non-philosopher of faith” (Jacobi)\npleased neither party, and signaled the quick and abrupt end of\nReinhold’s short-lived “Fichte phase.” \n\nAfter resolutely turning his back on the new post-Kantian idealist\nphilosophy that he himself had done so much to instigate, Reinhold\nnow presented himself to the public, in the six issues of his own\nBeyträge zur leichtern Uebersicht des Zustandes der\nPhilosophie beym Anfange des 19. Jahrhunderts [Contributions\nto an Easier Overview of the State of Philosophy at the Beginning of\nthe Nineteenth Century] (1801–1803), as a partisan of the\n“logical realism” of C. G. Bardili, which was an effort to\nbase philosophy upon pure logic and upon an appeal to what Bardili\ncalled “thinking qua thinking.” It was this effort\non Reinhold’s part, in the first issue of the Beyträge,\n“to reduce philosophy to logic” that drew the sarcastic ire\nof Hegel in his notorious appendix to his Differenz des\nFichte’schen und Schelling’schen Systems der Philosophie\n[Difference between the Fichtean and Schellingian System of\nPhilosophy] (1801) \n\nSoon enough, however, Reinhold became dissatisfied with Bardili’s\nposition as well, and began publicly to criticize the same “from\nthe standpoint of language” and to reject all efforts to ground\nphilosophy in pure formal logic. Reinhold’s final project as a\nphilosopher can be described as a pioneering effort to take seriously\nthe implications of ordinary language for philosophy itself and to\ninsist upon the intimate relationship between speaking and thinking.\nThese writings of Reinhold’s final years went nearly unnoticed during\nhis own lifetime and have generally remained unknown until the present\nday; yet they would appear to merit the attention of contemporary\nphilosophers and scholars, inasmuch as they anticipate in certain ways\nthe “linguistic turn” of so much subsequent philosophy \n\nAfter a lifetime of philosophical inquiry, during which he\ninfluenced countless readers and students, while himself moving\nrestlessly from one theoretical standpoint to another, Reinhold died in\nKiel in 1823. \n\nNo sooner did he begin lecturing on the first Critique than\nReinhold began to have serious doubts about the completeness of Kant’s\nphilosophy, the soundness of its theoretical foundations, and the\nadequacy of Kant’s own arguments and deductions. With remarkable\nalacrity and considerable ingenuity, he took it upon himself to remedy\nthese perceived defects in Kant’s own presentation and to construct his\nown, allegedly more systematic, well-grounded, and “universally\nacceptable” version of the new Critical philosophy. \n\nThough Reinhold sometimes referred to his new system simply as\n“philosophy without a nickname,” it soon became known by\nanother name that he used for it, namely: “Elementary\nPhilosophy” or “Philosophy of the Elements”\n[Elementarphilosophie]. After introducing his new\nphilosophical ideas in his own lectures, Reinhold began laying them\nbefore the public in a series of essays in popular and professional\njournals, essays which were then revised and expanded as chapters of\nthe three books which together constitute his “official”\nexposition of the Elementary Philosophy: Versuch einer neuen\nTheorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens (1789),\nBeyträge zur Berichtigung bisheriger Missverständnisse\nder Philosophen, Erster Band (1790), and Ueber das\nFundament des philosophischen Wissens (1791). \n\nReinhold introduced his presentation of the Elementary Philosophy\nwith the following “metaphilosophical” questions: How is\nphilosophy possible as a strict science, and what is the distinguishing\nfeature of such a science? Following Kant, as well as the entire\nrationalist tradition, Reinhold maintained that the essence of science\nlies in universality and necessity. But these are properties of\nthought, not of sensation or intuition. Only through thinking and\njudging can we recognize universality and necessity, a recognition that\nis, in turn, formulated and expressed in concepts and propositions. The\nbusiness of philosophy is therefore to establish “universally\nvalid” [allgemeingültig] propositions in a manner\nthat allows their necessity and universality to be universally\nrecognized as binding upon everyone [allgemeingeltend]. This\nlast requirement reveals the intimate link between Reinhold’s earlier\nefforts at “popularizing” the Kantian philosophy and his\nsubsequent efforts to expand and to ground this same system. One of the\nconstant hallmarks of Reinhold’s philosophical efforts was his\nconviction that a genuinely scientific philosophy must be capable of\nbeing understood and recognized as true by everyone. \n\nWhat makes philosophy “scientific,” according to\nReinhold, is not simply that it consists of propositions arrived at by\nthinking, but rather, the logical connection between the propositions\nin question—that is, their systematic form. Over and over\nagain, in one forum after another, Reinhold trumpeted the same\ndeclaration: scientific philosophy is systematic philosophy.\nAccordingly, he embarked upon an influential analysis of systematic\nform as such, in order to gain insight into how Kantianism could be\nmade rigorously systematic and therefore genuinely\n“scientific.” \n\nThe fundamental hallmarks of systematic form, according to Reinhold,\nare consistency and completeness, but it was the former of these that\nattracted most of Reinhold’s attention. The only way to be sure that\nany two propositions are truly consistent with one another—and\nhence, the only way to determine whether a number of philosophical\npropositions actually constitute a “system”—is to show\nthat they can all be traced back to the same first principle or\nfoundation [Grundsatz]. And the only way to show that they can\nindeed be “traced back” to such a first principle is by\nactually “deriving” them therefrom. (Despite his efforts to\nclarify this point, Reinhold’s conception of philosophical\n“derivation”—which is apparently not to be understood as\nsimple logical deduction—nevertheless remains extraordinarily\nmurky.) \n\nIt follows that a philosophical system must begin with a single\nfirst principle, which “determines” all the other\npropositions of the system. (Here again, there is a certain obscurity\nin Reinhold’s claim, inasmuch as he insisted that the first principle\n“determines” only the “form” and not the\n“content” of all the other, subordinate propositions, yet\nhe also described the relationship between the first principle and the\nsubordinate principles as a “syllogism,” in which the\nlatter are “derived” from the former.) Only if propositions\nare logically related to one another in this manner can they constitute\na “system.” A system with two or more “first\nprinciples” is not a system at all, but several different\nsystems. As for the completeness problem, Reinhold’s implicit solution\nseems to have been to seek an a priori first principle that could be\nknown in advance to encompass the entire domain of experience, and\nhence of philosophy. \n\nWhat, however, can one say about the truth (or, as Reinhold was more\nlikely to say, the “validity” [Gültigkeit])\nof the proposed first principle itself? If the validity of a\nphilosophical proposition is determined by its systematic, logical\nconnection to other propositions, then what determines the truth of the\nfirst principle, from which the system as a whole is generated or\nderived? The answer, Reinhold thought, is obvious: the first principle\nand systematic starting point of philosophy must be\nself-evident. It must be immediately certain. \n\nDespite reservations concerning the capacity of the first principle\nto determine the content, as opposed to the form, of the propositions\nderived from it, Reinhold unequivocally maintained that the first\nprinciple of all philosophy had to be a material (or synthetic) as well\nas a formal (or analytic) principle. Otherwise, “scientific\nphilosophy” would be identical to formal logic and would have no\ncontent of its own, which Reinhold (at this point anyway) staunchly\ndenied. Moreover, according to Reinhold, the establishment of such a\nuniversally valid and immediately certain first principle is not merely\na pressing requirement of theoretical reason, but also a matter of the\nutmost practical urgency, inasmuch as in the absence of such a\nfoundational first principle “philosophy itself is impossible as\na science, in which case the basis for our ethical duties and rights —\nas well as those duties and rights themselves—must remain forever\nundecided” (Beyträge I, p. 367). \n\nGranted, then, that a system of philosophy must begin with a single,\nimmediately certain, synthetic first proposition or “grounding\nprinciple”: where might one turn in order to discover and to\nrecognize the first principle in question, a proposition that alone can\nserve as the foundation or “ground” of all other\nphilosophical propositions and cannot itself be established by any\nargument? The answer is, we must turn within—to the\nconsideration of consciousness itself. This, Reinhold maintained, is\nprecisely what Kant (not to mention Descartes) had done, albeit he did\nnot succeed in presenting the fruits of his inquiries in an adequately\nscientific and systematic form. \n\nWhat then is the “first principle” of the Elementary\nPhilosophy? It is the “Principle of Consciousness,” namely,\nthe proposition that “in consciousness, the subject distinguishes\nthe representation from the subject and the object and relates the\nrepresentation to both” (Beyträge I, p. 167). In\nthis proposition, the term “representation”\n[Vorstellung] designates whatever we are directly conscious of\nwhenever we are conscious of anything whatsoever; the term\n“subject” designates the one who “is conscious”\nof whatever one is conscious of (the “conscious subject” or\n“subject of consciousness”); and the term\n“object” designates that “of which” the\nrepresentation is a representation (the intentional object of\nconsciousness, that to which the representation\n“refers”). \n\nThough “self-evident” and “universally\nvalid,” the proposition asserting this tripartite character of\nconsciousness is, according to Reinhold, not analytic but synthetic.\nThe Principle of Consciousness is not a tautology, yet anyone who\nreflects upon what is asserted by this principle will immediately\nrecognize its truth and universal validity, inasmuch as it expresses\nwhat Reinhold called a “universally recognized fact of\nconsciousness.” \n\nSelf-evidence alone, however, is not enough. One of the chief merits\nof the Principle of Consciousness, according to Reinhold, is that from\nit one can then derive the starting point of Kant’s own\nphilosophy, which appears to begin with a sheer, ungrounded assumption\nof the distinction between intuiting and thinking, the difference\nbetween theoretical and practical reason, etc. From this point,\nReinhold assures us, one can then proceed to the derivation of a\ncomplete system of philosophy as a whole, as envisioned but never\nactually accomplished by Kant himself. (One must recall that Reinhold’s\nwork on Elementary Philosophy preceded Kant’s third\nCritique.) \n\nWith the Principle of Consciousness Reinhold believed he had\nuncovered that “common root” of thought and sensibility,\nwhich Kant had declared to be unknowable. By commencing his analysis at\nthe level of “representations as such,” Reinhold was\nconvinced that he had, so to speak, hit philosophical rock bottom,\ninasmuch as all consciousness is self-evidently\n“representational” in character. (Fichte, however, in his\nAenesidemus review and his early writings on the\nWissenschaftslehre, would subsequently challenge precisely\nthis claim.) Thus, Reinhold’s “Theory of Representation”\n(which is the first section of the Elementary Philosophy) purports to\nprovide Kant’s Critical philosophy with the very foundation it so\nsorely lacks. And the Principle of Consciousness is, in turn, the\nfoundational or first principle of this new Theory of Representation —\nand hence the first principle of philosophy as a whole. \n\nBy far the most original and influential portion of the Elementary\nPhilosophy is its first part, the Theory of Representation, which is\ndevoted entirely to an analysis of our fundamental spiritual power —\nthe power of representation itself [Vorstellungsvermögen]—in an effort to determine “everything that can be known a\npriori concerning the representations of sensibility, understanding,\nand reason.” This foundational portion of the Elementary\nPhilosophy thus purports to provide a thorough and complete analysis of\nthe necessary features of representation qua representation,\nan analysis that claims to show “that space, time, the\ntwelve categories, and the three forms of the ideas\nare originally nothing but properties of mere\nrepresentations” (Fundament, pp. 72–73). This same\nanalysis of our power of representation also claims to establish the\ndistinction between the form and content of representations, the\nnecessity of both receptivity and spontaneity on the part of the power\nof representation, the necessary multiplicity of sensations, and the\nunknowability of things in themselves. \n\nIf Reinhold displays considerable originality and ingenuity in\nderiving the above mentioned results from his first principle (the\nPrinciple of Consciousness), the same cannot be said of the subsequent\nsection of the Elementary Philosophy, the “Theory of the Power of\nCognition,” which follows Kant’s own exposition much more closely\nthan the Theory of the Power of Representation and becomes increasingly\nschematic—and less convincing—as it advances. (Reinhold’s sole\nattempt at complete exposition of his “Theory of the Power of\nCognition” is roughly sketched in Book 3 of the Versuch,\nwhereas the “Theory of the Power of Representation” is\ntreated in elaborate detail in all three of his book-length\npresentations of the Elementary Philosophy.) \n\nOne may recall that Reinhold’s intention was to provide a new\nfoundation not merely for the “theoretical philosophy”\nexpounded by Kant in the first Critique, but for the Critical\nphilosophy as a whole, including Kant’s practical philosophy. In fact,\nhowever, Reinhold provided his readers with only the barest hints of\nhow his Elementary Philosophy might embrace Kant’s account of will and\nof practical reason. Significantly, this occurs in the final, 19 page\nsection of his “Theory of the Power of Cognition,” entitled\n“Theory of the Power of Desire,” in which Reinhold limits\nhimself to what he himself describes as the mere “outline”\nof a strategy for demonstrating the unity of theoretical and practical\nreason: if willing is the condition for the possibility of actual, as\nopposed to merely possible representation and cognition, then the\n“power of desire” conditions the powers of cognition and\nrepresentation. \n\nUnfortunately, Reinhold never fleshed out this fascinating outline,\nnever provided any arguments for the same, and never indicated how this\nprovocative claim concerning the relation of willing to knowing could\nbe reconciled with the “immediate certainties” of his\nstarting point. And this was precisely what provoked his most brilliant\nand critical reader, J. G. Fichte to attempt his own version of an\nElementary Philosophy—a version that would begin with the\nunity of the theoretical and the practical and that would, with the act\nof “positing” or Setzen, claim to have discovered\na starting point even more “basic” than that of mere\n“representation.” (It is significant that Fichte’s\nunpublished notebook of 1793/94, in which he first sketched what would\nsubsequently be known as the Wissenschaftslehre or\n“Theory of Scientific Knowledge,” was titled “Private\nMeditations on Elementary Philosophy/Practical Philosophy.”) \n\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the influence of Reinhold’s\ninquiries into systematicity and first principles upon an entire\ngeneration of philosophers. Though some recent research on Reinhold and\nthe “Jena circle” of the late 1780s has stressed the degree\nto which Reinhold himself soon came to have doubts about the project of\n“philosophy from a single principle” (see the work of\nDieter Henrich and his students, such as Marcello Stamm), this project\nwas nevertheless enthusiastically embraced by Fichte and the young\nSchelling, and inspired others, notably Hegel, to re-examine (and to\nquestion) the alleged connection between systematic form and\nself-evident first principles. Reinhold’s subsequent reservations about\nhis own Elementary Philosophy notwithstanding, the Elementary\nPhilosophy remains one of the clearest examples of a thoroughgoing\n“foundationalist” project in the history of European\nphilosophy. \n\nDuring Reinhold’s own lifetime, or at least during certain phases of\nthe same, he was among the more influential philosophers in Germany —\nfirst as an immensely successful popularizer of the Kantian revolution\nand then, with his effort to construct an Elementary Philosophy, as one\nof the founders of “post-Kantian idealism.” This, however,\nnearly exhausts his positive influence upon his contemporaries. \n\nFollowing the heyday of German idealism, Reinhold’s name has\ngenerally been relegated to the history of philosophy, within which he\nis assigned the role of serving as a small, but not insignificant rung\non the alleged ladder “from Kant to Hegel,” and this is\nprecisely how he is still treated in most general histories of\nphilosophy (as well as in this entry). In this context, Reinhold is\nusually credited with (or blamed for) putting the issues of systematic\nform and “philosophical foundations” at the center of\nphilosophical concern. Even those, such as Fichte, who roundly\ncriticized the details of his Elementary Philosophy professed sincere\nadmiration for Reinhold’s “systematic spirit.” And many of\nthose who rejected his contention that the Principle of Consciousness\ncould serve as the first principle of a philosophy as a whole,\nnevertheless praised him as the philosopher who first recognized the\nneed for some such principle and first sought to provide Kantianism\nwith a solid “foundation.” In both of these respects,\nReinhold served as an important catalyst or stimulus for further\nphilosophical developments. \n\nGiven this situation, it his hardly surprising that—with a few\nminor exceptions—the only works of Reinhold familiar even to most\nscholars, as well as the only writings by him to be reissued after his\nlifetime, were the Letters on the Kantian Philosophy and the\nthree, above-mentioned volumes in which he expounded his Elementary\nPhilosophy. This, however, is unfortunate, inasmuch as these texts\nrepresent only a small fraction of Reinhold’s literary output and do\nnot include some of his most original ideas, projects, and literary\nproductions, such as his final writings on philosophy and language and\nhis pioneering, lifelong efforts to get philosophers to take seriously\nthe history of their own discipline and to understand the\n“history of philosophy” philosophically. \n\nThis situation has recently begun to change, however. A critical\nedition of Reinhold’s voluminous and important philosophical\ncorrespondence was inaugurated in 1983 (though only one of the\nprojected ten volumes has appeared to date), and plans are currently\nafoot for an edition—the first ever—of Reinhold’s complete\nworks.  Newly edited editions of some of Reinhold’s major works have\nalso begun to appear, most notably the two volumes of his\nBeyträge zur Berichtigung bisheriger Missverständnisse\nder Philosophen, edited by Alessandro Lazzari and issued in the\n“Philosophische Bibliothek” series published by Felix Meiner. \n\nFor many years, the serious secondary literary on Reinhold was very\nsparse and was dominated by Alfred Klimmt’s monograph (see below).\nRecent years, however, have seen a spate of new articles and monographs\ndevoted to Reinhold, the most significant of which are the works by\nWolfgang Schrader and the recent, groundbreaking book by Martin\nBondeli. Also worth mentioning is Alexander von Schönborn’s\nannotated bibliography of Reinhold’s writings, a fine example of\nscholarly detective work and an essential tool for further research. In\nconjunction with and as part of the renaissance of Fichte studies over\nthe past four decades, there have been numerous efforts to reexamine\nthe relationship between Reinhold and Fichte, and, in particular, to\nreassess the precise debt of the Wissenschaftslehre to the\nElementary Philosophy. Accordingly, the scholarly literature on Fichte\nincludes numerous studies of this aspect of Reinhold’s achievement. \n\nEven more recently and for the first time ever, Reinhold’s ideas\nhave begun to be expounded, criticized, and debated among Anglophone\nscholars and philosophers, including Karl Ameriks, Frederick C. Beiser,\nDaniel Breazeale, Paul Franks, and Alexander von Schönborn. A\nrecent annual meeting of the Eastern Division of the American\nPhilosophical Association featured a session devoted almost entirely to\na debate (between Ameriks and Breazeale) over Reinhold’s actual\ncontribution to post-Kantian philosophy and the merits of his position.\nSuch a debate would have been unimaginable even a few decades ago. \n\nAppreciation and discussion of Reinhold among Anglophone readers is,\nhowever, not likely to spread very widely until more of Reinhold’s\nwritings have become available in English. Until very recently the English\nreader had to make do with incomplete translations of two works by\nReinhold: one, by George di Giovanni, of excerpts from the\nFundament and another, by Sabine Rohr, of portions of the\nVerhandlung über die Grundbegriffe und Grundsätze der\nMoralität aus dem Gesichtspunke des gemeinen und gesunden\nVerstandes.  In 2005 a fine translation of the first series of\nReinhold’s “Letters on the Kantian Philosophy,” translated by James\nHebbeler and edited by Karl Ameriks, was published as the series of\n“Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy.”  However, the rest of\nReinhold’s philosophical writings still await English translation. \n\nIn 1998 Reinhold’s philosophy was the subject of an international\nacademic conference—the first such conference ever to be devoted to\nReinhold—in Bad Homburg, Germany. The second international Reinhold\nconference was held in Luzern, Switzerland in 2002; the third, in\nRome, Italy in 2004; the fourth in Montreal, Canada in 2007, and the fifth in Siegen, Germany.  (The proceedings of all five of these conferences have now been published.) The level\nof scholarship and philosophical acumen on display at these two events\nwas very high and augurs well for the future. Indeed, one could argue\nthat the future of Reinhold Studies is brighter today than at any time\nsince Reinhold’s death.","contact.mail":"breazeal@uky.edu","contact.domain":"uky.edu"}]
