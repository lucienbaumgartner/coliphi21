A more cautious,\nepistemological characterization is that analytic sentences\nare those whose truth can be known merely by knowing the\nmeanings of the constituent terms, as opposed to having also to know\nsomething about the represented world. Beginning with Frege, many\nphilosophers hoped to show that the truths of logic and mathematics\nand other apparently a priori domains, such as much of\nphilosophy and the foundations of science, could be shown to be at\nleast epistemically analytic by careful “conceptual\nanalysis.” This project encountered a number of problems that\nhave seemed so intractable as to lead some philosophers, particularly\nQuine, to doubt the reality of the distinction. Surprisingly, this led\nhim and others to doubt the reality and determinacy of psychological\nstates. There have been a number of interesting reactions to this\nscepticism, both in philosophy and in linguistics, but, while the\nreality of psychological states might be saved, it has yet to be shown\nthat appeals to the analytic will ever be able to ground the a\npriori in the way that philosophers had hoped. (Note that\nseveral substantive issues are discussed in the \n footnotes.)\n\n\nCompare the following two sets of sentences: \nMost competent English speakers who know the meanings of all the\nconstituent words would find an obvious difference between the two\nsets: whereas they might wonder about the truth or falsity of those of\nset I, they would find themselves pretty quickly incapable of doubting\nthose of II. Unlike the former, these latter seem to be known\nautomatically, “just by virtue of knowing just what the\nwords mean,” as many might spontaneously put it. Indeed, a\ndenial of any of them would seem to be in some important way\nunintelligible, very like a contradiction in terms.\nAlthough there is, as we shall see, a great deal of dispute about\nthese italicized ways of drawing the distinction, and even about\nwhether it is real, philosophers standardly refer to sentences of the\nfirst class as “synthetic,” those of the second as (at\nleast apparently) “analytic.” Many philosophers have hoped\nthat the apparent necessity and a priori status of the claims\nof logic, mathematics and much of philosophy would prove to be due to\nthese claims being analytic, i.e., explaining why such claims seemed\nto be true “in all possible worlds,” and knowable to be so\n“independently of experience.” This view has led them to\nregard philosophy as consisting in large part in the\n“analysis” of the meanings of the relevant claims, words\nand concepts (hence “analytic” philosophy, although the\nterm has long ceased to have any such specific commitment, and refers\nnow more generally to philosophy done in the associated closely\nreasoned style); and, most importantly, this seemed to invite and\nsupport the special methodology of “arm chair reflection”\non concepts in which philosophers traditionally engaged, independently\nof any empirical research. \nAlthough there are precursors of the contemporary notion of the\nanalytic in Leibniz, and in Locke and Hume in their talk of\n“relations of ideas,”, the conception that currently\nconcerns many philosophers has its roots in the work of Kant (1781\n[1998]) who, at the beginning of his Critique of Pure Reason,\nwrote: \nHe provided as an example of an analytic judgment, “All bodies\nare extended”: in thinking of a body we can’t help but\nalso think of something extended in space; that would seem to be just\npart of what is meant by “body.” He contrasted this with\n“All bodies are heavy,” where the predicate (“is\nheavy”) “is something entirely different from that which I\nthink in the mere concept of body in general” (A7), and we must\nput together, or “synthesize,” the different concepts,\nbody and heavy (sometimes such concepts are called\n“ampliative,” “amplifying” a concept beyond\nwhat is “contained” in it). \nKant tried to spell out his “containment” metaphor for the\nanalytic in two ways. To see that any of set II is true, he wrote,\n“I need only to analyze the concept, i.e., become conscious of\nthe manifold that I always think in it, in order to encounter this\npredicate therein” (A7). But then, picking up a suggestion of\nLeibniz, he went on to claim: \nAs Katz (1988) emphasized, this second definition is significantly\ndifferent from the “containment” idea, since now, in its\nappeal to the powerful method of proof by contradiction, the analytic\nwould include all of the (potentially infinite) deductive consequences\nof a particular claim, most of which could not be plausibly regarded\nas “contained” in the concept expressed in the claim. For\nstarters, “Bachelors are unmarried or the moon is blue” is\na logical consequence of “Bachelors are\nunmarried”—its denial contradicts the latter (a denial of\na disjunction is a denial of each disjunct)—but clearly nothing\nabout the color of the moon is remotely “contained in” the\nconcept bachelor. To avoid such consequences, Katz (e.g., 1972, 1988)\nwent on to try to develop a serious theory based upon only the initial\ncontainment idea, as, along different lines, does Pietroski (2005).\n \nOne reason Kant may not have noticed the differences between his\ndifferent characterizations of the analytic was that his conception of\n“logic” seems to have been confined to the Aristotelian\nsyllogistic, and so didn’t include the full resources of modern\nlogic, where the differences between the two characterizations become\nmore glaring (see MacFarlane 2002). Indeed, he demarcates the category\nof the analytic chiefly in order to contrast it with what he regards\nas the more important category of the “synthetic,” which\nhe famously thinks is not confined, as one might initially suppose,\nmerely to the empirical. (That providing a serious, positive account\nof the “analytic” was not Kant’s concern is perhaps\nbrought out by his scepticism at 1781 [1998], A727–732, at least\nabout definitions outside of mathematics). While some trivial a\npriori claims might be analytic in this sense, for Kant the\nseriously interesting ones were synthetic. He argues that even so\nelementary an example in arithmetic as “7+5=12,” is\nsynthetic, since the concept of “12” is not contained in\nthe concepts of “7,” “5,” or “+,”:\nappreciating the truth of the proposition would seem to require some\nkind of active synthesis of the mind uniting the different constituent\nthoughts. And so we arrive at the category of the “synthetic\na priori,” whose very possibility became a major\nconcern of his work. He tries to show that the activity of\n“synthesis” was the source of the important cases of a\npriori knowledge, not only in arithmetic, but also in geometry,\nthe foundations of physics, ethics, and philosophy generally, a view\nthat set the stage for much of the philosophical discussions of the\nsubsequent century (see Coffa 1991, pt. I).  \nApart from geometry, Kant, himself, didn’t focus much on the\ncase of mathematics. But, as mathematics in the 19th C. began reaching\nnew heights of sophistication, worries were increasingly raised about\nits foundations as well. It was specifically in response to this\nlatter problem that Gottlob Frege (1884 [1980]) tried to improve upon\nKant’s formulations of the analytic, and presented what is\nwidely regarded as the next significant discussion of the topic.  \nFrege (1884 [1980], §§5,88) and others noted a number of\nproblems with Kant’s “containment” metaphor. In the\nfirst place, as Kant (1781 [1998], A728) himself would surely have\nagreed, the criterion would need to be freed of\n“psychologistic” suggestions, or claims about merely the\naccidental thought processes of thinkers, as opposed to claims about\ntruth and justification that are presumably at issue with the\nanalytic. In particular, mere associations are not always matters of\nmeaning: someone might regularly associate bachelors with being\nunharried, but this wouldn’t therefore seriously be a part of\nthe meaning of “bachelor” (“a harried\nbachelor” is not contradictory). But, secondly, although the\ndenial of a genuinely analytic claim may well be a\n“contradiction,” it isn’t clear what makes it so:\nthere is no explicit contradiction in the thought of a\nmarried bachelor, in the way that there is in the thought of a\nbachelor who is not a bachelor. “Married bachelor” has at\nleast the same explicit logical form as “harried\nbachelor.” Rejecting “a married bachelor” as\ncontradictory would seem to have no justification other than the claim\nthat “All bachelors are unmarried” is analytic, and so\ncannot serve to justify or explain that claim. \nEven were Kant to have solved these problems, it isn’t clear how\nhis notion of “containment” would cover all the cases of\nwhat seem to many to be as “analytic” as any of set II.\nThus, consider: \nThe symmetry of the marriage relation, or the transitivity of\n“ancestor” and “bigger than” are not obviously\n“contained in” the corresponding thoughts in the way that\nthe idea of extension is plausibly “contained in” the\nnotion of body, or male in the notion of bachelor. (14) has seemed\nparticularly troublesome: what else besides “colored”\ncould be included in the analysis? Red is colored and what else? It is\nhard to see what else to “add”—except red itself!\n(See §3.4 below for further discussion.) \nFrege attempted to remedy the situation by completely rethinking the\nfoundations of logic, developing what we now think of as modern\nsymbolic logic. He defined a perfectly precise “formal”\nlanguage, i.e., a language characterized by the “form”\n–standardly, the shape—of its expressions, and he\ncarefully set out an account of the syntax and semantics of what are\ncalled the “logical constants,” such as “and”,\n“or”, “not”, “all” and\n“some”, showing how to capture a very wide class of valid\ninferences containing them. Saying precisely how these constants are\nselected is a matter of considerable difficulty (see Logical\nConstants), but, at least intuitively, the constants can be\nthought of as those parts of language that don’t\n“point” or “function referentially,” aiming to\nrefer to something in the world, in the way that ordinary nouns, verbs\nand adjectives seem to do: “Socrates” refers to Socrates,\n“dogs” to dogs, “clever” to clever and/or\nclever things, and even “Zeus” aims to refer to a Greek\ngod, but words like “and” and “all”\ndon’t seem to function referentially at all: at any rate, it\ncertainly isn’t clear that there are “and”s and\n“all”s in the world, along with the dogs and their\nproperties. (Rendering this distinction fully precise, in a way that\ndeals with all of the many “function” words of natural\nlanguage, such as auxiliary verbs, pronouns and prepositions, is none\ntoo easy; for purposes here, it will suffice to restrict attention to\nmerely the constants of standard first-order logic.) \nThis distinction between non-logical, “referring”\nexpressions and logical constants allows us to define a logical truth\nas a sentence that is true no matter what non-logical expressions\noccur in it. Consequently (italicizing non-logical expressions), \ncounts as a (strict) logical truth: no matter what non-logical\nexpressions we put in for “doctor”, “eyes” and\n“specialize on” in (6), the sentence will remain true. For\nexample, substituting “cats” for “doctors”,\n“mice” for “eyes” and “chase” for\n“specialize on”, we get: \n(Throughout this discussion, by “substitution” we shall\nmean uniform substitution of one presumably univocal expression for\nanother in all its occurrences in a sentence.) But what about the\nothers of set II? Substituting “cats” for\n“doctors” and “mice” for\n“ophthalmologists” in \nwe get:  \nwhich is patently false, as would many such substitutions render the\nrest of the examples of II. (6) is a patent logical truth;\nits truth depends only upon the semantic values of its logical\nparticles. But the truth of (7) – (10) depends upon analyticities of the\nfurther non-logical terms. How are we to capture these? \nHere Frege appealed to the notion of definition,\nor—presuming that definitions preserve “meaning”\n(see §3.2ff below)—synonymy: the non-logical\nanalytic truths are those that can be converted to (strict) logical\ntruths by substitution of definitions for defined terms, or synonyms\nfor synonyms. Since “mice” is not synonymous with\n“ophthalmologist”, (16) is not a substitution of the\nrequired sort. We need, instead, a substitution of the definition of\n“ophthalmologist”, i.e., “doctor that specializes on\neyes”, which would convert (7) into our earlier purely logical\ntruth: \nOf course, these notions of definition, meaning and\nsynonymy would themselves need to clarified, But they were\nthought to be sufficiently obvious notions, whose clarification\ndidn’t seem particularly urgent until Quine raised serious\nquestions about them much later (see §3.6ff below). \nFrege was mostly interested in formalizing arithmetic, and so\nconsidered the logical forms of a relative minority of natural\nlanguage sentences in a deliberately spare formalism. Work on the\nlogical (or syntactic) structure of the full range of sentences of\nnatural language has blossomed since then, initially in the work of\nBertrand Russell (1905), in his famous theory of definite\ndescriptions, where the criterion is applied to whole phrases in\ncontext, but then especially in the work of Noam Chomsky and other\n“generative” linguists (see §4.3 below). Whether\nFrege’s criterion of analyticity will work for the rest of II\nand other analyticities depends upon the details of those proposals\n(see, e.g., Katz, 1972, Montague, 1974, Hornstein, 1984, Harman, 1996,\nand Pietroski, 2005 and forthcoming).  \nWhy should philosophy be interested in what would seem to be a purely\nlinguistic notion? Because, especially in the first half of the\nTwentieth Century, many philosophers thought it could perform crucial\nepistemological work, providing an account, first, of our\napparently a priori knowledge of mathematics, and\nthen—with a little help from British empiricism—of our\nunderstanding of claims about the spatio-temporal world as well.\nIndeed, “conceptual analysis” soon came to constitute the\nvery way particularly Anglophone philosophers characterized their\nwork.  \nMany additionally thought it would perform the metaphysical\nwork of explaining the truth and necessity of\nmathematics, showing not only how it is we could know about\nthese topics independently of experience, but how they could be\ntrue in this and all possible worlds. This latter ambition\nwas sometimes not distinguished from the former one, although it is no\nlonger shared by most philosophers still interested in the analytic.\nIndeed, many have wondered how could any sentence be true, much less\nnecessary, “by virtue of meaning alone,” since surely the\ntruth of any sentence depends upon the world being the way the\nsentence represents it as being. Recall that Frege’s ambition\nwas to reduce mathematics to logic by showing how, substituting\nsynonyms for synonyms, every mathematical truth could be shown to be a\nlogical one. He didn’t go on to claim (although some later\nphilosophers did) that the logical truths themselves were true by\nvirtue of meaning alone. Thus, “Bachelors are unmarried”\nmight be shown to be analytic by substituting “unmarried\nmales” for “bachelors” and converting it thereby to\nthe logical truth “Unmarried males are unmarried.” But\nwhat makes this latter true? As Devitt (1996) pointed\n out:[1] \nIn view of this point, in the remainder of this entry we will focus\nprimarily on the epistemological project. \nThe problem of accounting for mathematical knowledge is arguably one\nof the oldest and hardest problems in Western philosophy. It is easy\nenough to understand: ordinarily we acquire knowledge about the world\nby our senses. If we are interested in, for example, whether\nit’s raining outside, how many birds are on the beach, whether\nfish sleep or stars collapse, we look and see, or turn to others who\ndo. It is a widespread view that Western sciences owe their tremendous\nsuccesses precisely to relying on just such “empirical”\n(experiential, experimental) methods. However, it is also a patent\nfact about all these sciences, and even our ordinary ways of counting\nbirds, fish and stars, that they depend on mathematics; and\nmathematics does not seem to be known on the basis of experience.\nMathematicians don’t do experiments in the way that chemists,\nbiologists or other “natural scientists” do. They seem\nsimply to think, at most with pencil and paper as an aid to\nmemory. In any case, they don’t try to justify their claims by\nreference to experiments: “Twice two is four” is not\njustified by observing that pairs of pairs tend in all cases observed\nso far to be quadruples. \nBut how could mere processes of thought issue in any knowledge about\nthe independently existing external world? The belief that it could\nwould seem to involve some kind of mysticism; and, indeed, many\n“naturalistic” philosophers have felt that the appeals of\n“Rationalist” philosophers like Plato, Descartes, Leibniz\nand, more recently, Katz (1988, 1990), Bealer (1987) and Bonjour\n(1998), to some special faculty of “rational intuition,”\nseem no better off than appeals to “revelation” to\nestablish theology. \nHere’s where the analytic seemed to many to offer a more\npromising alternative. Perhaps all the truths of arithmetic could be\nshown to be analytic by Frege’s criterion, i.e., by showing that\nthey could all be converted into logical truths by substitution of\nsynonyms for synonyms. Of course, the relevant synonyms were not quite\nas obvious as “ophthalmologist” and “eye\ndoctor”; one needed to engage in a rigorous process of\n“logical analysis” of the meanings of such words as\n“number”, “plus”, “exponent”,\n“limit”, “integral”, etc. But this is what\nFrege set out to do, and in his train, Bertrand Russell and the young\nLudwig Wittgenstein, launching the program of logicism, often with\ngreat insight and at least some success (see §5 below). \nBut why stop at arithmetic? If logical analysis could illuminate the\nfoundations of mathematics by showing how it could all be derived from\nlogic by substitution of synonyms, perhaps it could also illuminate\nthe foundations of the rest of our knowledge by showing how\nits claims could similarly be derived from logic and\nexperience. Such was the hope and program of Logical\nPositivism, championed by, e.g., Moritz Schlick, A.J. Ayer and,\nespecially, Rudolf Carnap. Of course, such a proposal did presume that\nall of our concepts were “derived” either from logic or\nexperience, but this seemed in keeping with the then prevailing\npresumptions of empiricism, which, they assumed, had been vindicated\nby the immense success of the empirical sciences. \nHow were our concepts of, e.g., space, time, causation, or material\nobjects analytically related to experience? For the Positivists, the\nanswer seemed obvious: by tests. Interpreting\nWittgenstein’s (1922) Tractatus along the lines of the\nAmerican philosopher, C.S. Peirce, they proposed various versions of\ntheir “Verifiability Theory of Meaning,”\naccording to which the meaning (or “cognitive\nsignificance”) of any sentence was the conditions of its\nempirical (dis-)confirmation. Thus, to say that the temperature of a\nliquid is of a certain magnitude is to say, for example, that the\nmercury in a thermometer immersed in the liquid would expand to a\ncertain point marked by a numeral representing that magnitude, a claim\nthat would ordinarily be disconfirmed if it didn’t. Closer to\n“experience”: to say that there is a cat on a mat is just\nto say that certain patterns of sensation (certain familiar visual,\ntactile and aural appearances) are to be expected under certain\ncircumstances. After all, it seemed to them, as it seemed to Locke,\nBerkeley and Hume centuries earlier, that all our concepts are derived\nfrom sensory experiences, and, if so, then all our concepts must\ninvolve some or other kind of construction from those experiences.\n \nFor the Positivists, these earlier empiricists had erred only in\nthinking that the mechanism of construction was mere association. But\nassociation can’t even account for the structure of a judgment,\nsuch as “Salt comes in shakers,” which is not merely the\nexcitation of its constituent ideas, along the lines of\n“salt” exciting “pepper,” but involves\ncombining the nouns “salt” and “shakers” with\nthe predicate “x comes in y” in a very particular way (see\nKant, 1781 [1998], A111–2 and Frege, 1892b [1966]). That is, our\nthoughts and claims about the world have some kind of logical\nstructure, of a sort that seems to begin to be revealed by\nFrege’s proposals. Equipped with Frege’s logic, it was\npossible to provide a more plausible formulation of conceptual\nempiricism: our claims about the empirical world were to be analyzed\ninto the (dis)confirming experiences out of which they must somehow\nhave been logically constructed. \nThe project of providing “analyses” in this way of\nespecially problematic concepts like those concerning, for example,\nmaterial objects, knowledge, perception, causation, freedom,\nand the self, was pursued by Positivists and other\n“analytic” philosophers for a considerable period (see\nCarnap 1928 [1967] for some rigorous examples, Ayer 1934 [1952] for\nmore accessible ones). With regard to material object claims, the\nprogram came to be known as “phenomenalism”; with regard\nto the theoretical claims of science, as “operationalism”\n; and with regard to the claims about people’s mental lives, as\n“analytical behaviorism” (the relevant experiential basis\nof mental claims in general being taken to be observations of\nothers’ behavior). Although these programs became extremely\ninfluential, and some form of the verifiability criterion was often\n(and sometimes still is) invoked in physics and psychology to\nconstrain theoretical speculation, they seldom, if ever, met with any\nserious success. No sooner was an analysis, say, of “material\nobject” or “expectation,” proposed than serious\ncounterexamples were raised and the analysis revised, only to be faced\nwith still further counterexamples (see Chisholm 1957, and Fodor 1981,\nfor discussion of the failures, and note, again, Kant’s 1781\n[1998], A327–32, scepticism about at least definitions outside\nmathematics). Despite what seemed its initial plausibility,\nphilosophers came to suspect that the criterion, and with it the very\nnotion of analyticity itself, rested on some fundamental mistakes. \nAn issue that Frege’s criterion didn’t address is the\nstatus of the basic sentences of logic themselves. Are the logical\ntruths themselves a priori because they, too, are\n“analytic”? But what makes them so? Is it that anyone who\nunderstands their wording just must see that they are true? If so, how\nare we to make sense of people’s frequent, often apparent\nviolations of them in fallacious reasoning and ordinary\n speech?[2]\n What are we to make of disputes about the laws of logic of the sort\nthat are raised, for example, by mathematical intuitionists, who deny\nthe Law of Excluded Middle (“p or not p”), or, more\nrecently, by “para-consistent” logicians, who argue for\nthe toleration even of contradictions to avoid certain paradoxes (see\nPriest 1987 [2006] and Williamson 2007:chapter 4, for discussion)?\nMoreover, given that the infinitude of logical truths needs to be\n“generated” by rules of inference, wouldn’t that be\na reason for regarding them as “synthetic” in Kant’s\nsense (see Frege 1884 [1980], §88, Katz 1988, pp. 58–9 and\nMacFarlane 2002)? Most worrisome is a challenge raised by Quine 1956\n[1976], §II): how does claiming logical truths to be analytic\ndiffer from merely claiming them to be obviously and universally\ncorrect, i.e., widely and firmly held beliefs, indistinguishable in\nkind from banalities like “The earth has existed for many\nyears” or “There have been black dogs”? \nA further problem arises for the non-logical vocabulary. The sentences\nreporting our experiences seemed to many to have some kind of analytic\nconnection with those experiences—a normal sighted person\nfailing to apply “looks red” in clear cases arguably fails\nto understand the words. But there was a serious question about just\nwhat “experience” should be taken to be: was it the usual\nsort of encounter we have with ordinary middle-sized objects such as\ntables and chairs, the weather and bodily actions, in terms of which\nmost people would readily describe their perceptual experience? Or was\nit some sort of special “un-conceptualized” play of sense\nimpressions that would require careful introspection to reveal? This\nlatter suggestion seemed to involve a “myth of the given”\n(Sellars 1956), or the dubious assumption that there was something\ngiven in our experience that was entirely un-interpreted by our\nunderstanding. This was a claim about which serious doubts were raised\nnot only by Sellars, but by psychologists (e.g., Bruner 1957) and\nhistorians of science (e.g., Hanson 1958 and Kuhn 1962). Ordinary\n“observations” can be seen to be shot through with\nconceptual presuppositions: observing a meter reading “7\namps” requires conceptualizing some object as a meter, the marks\non it as numerals as indicating numbers and/or magnitudes of amperage;\nobserving someone kick a cat requires conceptualizing a bodily motion\nas an intentional act; and even observing the sky to be blue requires\nthe peculiar concept of the sky. Trying to divest such\nordinary observations of all of their conceptual baggage and\nreporting experience as it seems in and of itself would seem\nto require at least the trained eye of a Monet and the nuanced mind of\na Proust, and it’s difficult to see why such special and\nsophisticated reports should be particularly privileged. And if there\nis no privileged set of sentences reporting experience, then the rug\nwould seem to have been pulled out from under some of the main\npresumptions and motivations for the Positivist program: what would be\nthe significance of “analyzing” the meaning of a claim\ninto merely what a particular theorist had (arbitrarily?) decided to\nregard as primitive? \nRecent developments in psychology, however, suggest that human minds\nmay well contain sensory and motor “modules” whose\nprimitives would be epistemically distinctive, even if they do involve\nsome limited degree of conceptual interpretation (see Modularity\nof Mind and Fodor 1983, 1984). And so the analytical Positivist\nprogram might be recast in terms of the reduction of all concepts to\nthese sensorimotor primitives, a project that is sometimes implicit in\ncognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. \nAnother problem with the entire program was raised by Langford (1942)\nand discussed by Moore (1942 [1968], pp. 665–6): why should\nanalyses be of any conceivable interest? After all, if an analysis\nconsists in providing the definition of an expression, then it should\nbe providing a synonym for it, and this, then, should be wholly\nuninformative: if “brother” is analyzed as the presumably\nsynonymous “male sibling,” then the claim “Brothers\nare male siblings” should be synonymous with “Brothers are\nbrothers,” and thinking the one should be no different from\nthinking the other. But, aside from such simple cases as\n“brother” and “bachelor,” proposed analyses,\nif successful, often seemed unobvious and philosophically informative.\nThe proposed reductions of, say, material object statements to sensory\nones were often fairly complex, had to be studied and learned, and so\ncould hardly be uninformative. So how could they count as seriously\nanalytic? \nThis is “the paradox of analysis,” which can be seen as\ndormant in Frege’s own move from his (1884) focus on definitions\nto his more controversial (1892a) doctrine of sense, where two senses\nare distinct if and only if someone can think a thought containing the\none but not other, as in the case of the senses of “the morning\nstar” and “the evening star.” If analyses or\ndefinitions preserved sense, then, unlike the case of “morning\nstar” and “evening star,” whenever one thought the\ndefiniendum, one would be thereby thinking the definiens. And perhaps\none can’t think Bill is Bob’s brother without thinking\nBill is Bob’s male sibling. But few of Frege’s definitions\nof arithmetic concepts are nearly so simple (see\n Gottlob Frege,\n §2.5). In their case, it seems perfectly possible to think the\ndefiniendum, say, number, without thinking the elaborate definiens\nFrege provides (see Bealer 1982, Dummett 1991, and Horty 1993, 2007,\nfor extensive discussions of this problem, and further conditions,\ne.g., fecundity, that Frege placed on serious definitions). \nA related problem, discussed by Bealer (1998), is the possible\nproliferation of candidate analyses. The concept of a circle can be\nanalyzed as the concept of a set of co-planar points equidistant\nfrom a given point and as a closed figure of constant\ncurvature. Not only do both of these analyses seem informative,\nthe equivalence between them would need to be shown by some serious\ngeometry, and, especially since the advent of non-Euclidean geometries\nand Einstein’s theories of relativity, this could no longer be\nassumed to be justified merely on the basis of logic and\ndefinitions. \nThese problems, so far, can be regarded as relatively technical, for\nwhich further technical moves within the program might be made. For\nexample, one might make further distinctions within the theory of\nsense between an expression’s content and the specific\n“linguistic vehicle” used for its expression, as in Fodor\n(1990a) and Horty (1993, 2007); and maybe distinguish between the\ntruth-conditional content of an expression and its\nidiosyncratic role, or “character,” in a language\nsystem, along the lines of a distinction Kaplan (1989) introduced to\ndeal with indexical and demonstrative expressions (such as\n“I,” “now” and “that”; see\nDemonstratives, Narrow Mental Content and White\n1982). Perhaps analyses could be regarded as providing a particular\n“vehicle,” having a specific “character,” that\ncould account for why one could entertain a certain concept without\nentertaining its analysis (see G. Russell, 2008, and Pietroski, 2002,\n2005, and forthcoming, for different suggestive discussions). \nHowever, the problems with the program seemed to many philosophers to\nbe deeper than merely technical. By far, the most telling and\ninfluential of the criticisms both of the program, and then of\nanalyticity in general, were those of the American philosopher, W.V.\nQuine, who began as a great champion of the program (see esp. his\n1934), and whose subsequent objections therefore carry special weight.\nThe reader is well-advised to consult particularly his (1956 [1976])\nfor as rich and deep a discussion of the issues as one might find. The\nnext two sections abbreviate some of that discussion. \nAlthough the pursuit of the logicist program gave rise to a great many\ninsights into the nature of mathematical concepts, not long after its\ninception it began encountering substantial difficulties. For Frege,\nthe most calamitous came early on in a letter from Russell, in which\nRussell pointed out that one of Frege’s crucial axioms for\narithmetic was actually inconsistent. His intuitively quite plausible\n“Basic Law V” (sometimes called “the unrestricted\nComprehension Axiom”) had committed him to the existence of a\nset for every predicate. But what, asked Russell, of the predicate\n“x is not a member of itself”? If there were a set\nfor that predicate, that set itself would be a member of itself if and\nonly if it weren’t; consequently, there could be no such set.\nFrege’s Basic Law V couldn’t be true (but see\n Frege’s theorem and foundations for arithmetic\n and recent discussion of Frege’s program in §5 below). \nWhat was especially upsetting about “Russell’s\nparadox” was that there seemed to be no intuitively satisfactory\nway to repair set theory in a way that could lay claim to being as\nobvious and merely a matter of logic or meaning in the way that\nPositivists had hoped. Various proposals were made, but all of them\nwere tailored precisely to avoid the paradox, and seemed to have\nlittle independent appeal. Certainly none of them appeared to be\nanalytic. As Quine (1956 [1976], §V) observed, in the actual\npractice of choosing axioms for set theory, we seem to be left\n“making deliberate choices and setting them forth unaccompanied\nby any attempt at justification other than in terms of their elegance\nand convenience,” appeals to the meanings of terms be hanged\n(although see Boolos’ 1971 defense of the “iterative\nconception of set”). \nPerhaps, however, these “deliberate choices” could\nthemselves be seen as affording a basis for analytic claims. For\naren’t matters of meaning in the end really matters about the\ndeliberate or implicit conventions with which words are used? Someone,\nfor example, could invest a particular word, say,\n“schmuncle,” with a specific meaning merely by stipulating\nthat it mean, say, unmarried uncle. Wouldn’t that afford a basis\nfor claiming then that “A schmuncle is an uncle” is\nanalytic, or “true by virtue of the (stipulated) meanings of the\nwords alone”? Carnap (1947) proposed setting out the\n“meaning postulates” of a scientific language in just this\nway. This had the further advantage of allowing terms to be\n“implicitly defined” by their roles in such postulates,\nwhich might be a theory’s laws or axioms. This strategy seems\nespecially appropriate for defining logical constants, as well as for\ndealing with cases like (11)–(14) above, e.g. “Red is a\ncolor,” where mere “containment” seemed not to\nsuffice. So perhaps what philosophical analysis is doing is revealing\nthe tacit conventions of ordinary language, an approach particularly\nfavored by Ayer (1934 [1952]). \nQuine (1956, §§IV–V) goes on to address the complex\nrole(s) of convention in mathematics and science. Drawing on his\nearlier discussion (1936 [1976]) of the conventionality of logic, he\nargues that logic could not be established by such conventions,\nsince \nThis is certainly an argument that ought to give the proponents of the\nconventionality of logic pause: how could one hope to set out the\ngeneral conventions for “all” or\n“if…then…” without using the notions of\n“all” and\n“if…then…”? (“ALL universal\ninstantiations are valid”; “IF p is one\npremise, and if p then q is another, THEN it’s\nvalid to conclude\n q”)[3] \nTurning to set theory and then the rest of science, Quine goes on to\nargue that, although stipulative definition, what he calls\n“legislative postulation,” \nEven if Newton, say, had himself explicitly set out “F=ma”\nas a stipulated definition of “F”, this wouldn’t\nreally settle the interesting philosophical question of whether\n“F=ma”, is justified by its being analytic, or “true\nby meaning alone,” since our taking his stipulation seriously\nwould seem to depend upon our acceptance of his theory as a whole, in\nparticular, perhaps, upon “the elegance and convenience”\nit brought to the rest of our physical theory of the world. If it\ndidn’t do so, that might be a serious reason to reject it. In a\nfamous discussion of Quine, Putnam (1965 [1975]) adduced numerous\ncases of revisions of definitions in the history of science, for\nexample, the revision of the “ definition” of\n“kinetic energy” as 1/2mv2 in the light of\nEinstein’s Theory of Relativity (see Harman 1996, p. 399 for a\nnice discussion of how “something that is true by stipulative\ndefinition can turn out to be false”). As Quine goes on to\nobserve: \nCarnap’s legislated “meaning postulates” should\ntherefore be regarded as just an arbitrary selection of sentences of a\ntheory, a selection perhaps useful for purposes of exposition, but no\nmore significant than the selection of certain towns in Ohio as\n“starting points” for a journey (1953 [1980], p.\n 35).[4]\n Invoking his famous holistic metaphor of the “fabric”, or\n“web” of belief, Quine concludes: \nThese last passages express a tremendously influential view of\nQuine’s that led several generations of philosophers to despair\nnot only of the analytic-synthetic distinction, but of the category of\na priori knowledge entirely. The view has come to be called\n“confirmation holism,” and Quine had expressed it more\nshortly a few years earlier, in his widely read article, “Two\nDogmas of Empiricism” (1953, ch. 2): \nIndeed, the “two dogmas” that the article discusses are\n(i) the belief in the intelligibility of the “analytic”\nitself, and (ii), what Quine regards as the flip side of the same\ncoin, the belief that “each statement, taken in isolation from\nits fellows, can admit of confirmation or infirmation at all”\n(p. 41), i.e., the very (version of the) Verifiability Theory of\nMeaning we have seen the Positivists enlisted in their effort to\n“analyze” the claims of science and commonsense.\n(Ironically enough, Quine, himself, continued to adhere to a\nverifiability conception of meaning, his confirmation holism\nleading him merely to embrace a further meaning holism and\nhis notorious “thesis of the indeterminacy of translation”\nsee his 1986, p. 155, and the next section below). \nQuine bases his “confirmation holism” upon observations of\nPierre Duhem (1914 [1954]), who drew attention to the myriad ways in\nwhich theories are supported by evidence, and the fact that an\nhypothesis is not (dis)confirmed merely by some specific experiment\nconsidered in isolation from an immense amount of surrounding theory.\nThus, to take our earlier example, a thermometer will be a good\nindication of ambient temperature only if it’s made of the right\nmaterials, calibrated appropriately, and there aren’t any other\nforces at work that might disturb the measurement—and, of\ncourse, only if the background laws of physics and other beliefs that\nhave informed the design of the measurement are in fact sufficiently\ncorrect. A failure of the thermometer to measure the temperature could\nbe due to a failure of any of these other conditions, which is, of\ncourse, why experimenters spend so much time and money constructing\nexperiments to “control” for them. Moreover, with a small\nchange in our theories or background beliefs, or just in our\nunderstanding of the conditions for measurement, we might change the\ntests on which we rely, but often without changing the meaning of the\nsentences whose truth we might be trying to test (which, as Putnam\n1965 [1975] pointed out, is precisely what practicing scientists\nregularly do). \nWhat is novel—and highly controversial—about Quine’s\nunderstanding of these commonplace observations is his extension of\nthem to claims presumed by most people (e.g., by Duhem himself) to be\noutside their scope, viz., the whole of mathematics and even logic! It\nis this extension that seems to undermine the traditional a\npriori status of these latter domains, since it appears to open\nthe possibility of a revision of logic or mathematics in the interest\nof the plausibility of the overall resulting theory—containing\nboth the empirical claims and those of logic and mathematics. Perhaps\nthis wouldn’t be so bad should the revisability of logic and\nmathematics permit their ultimately admitting of a justification that\ndidn’t involve experience. But this is ruled out by\nQuine’s insistence that scientific theories, along with their\nlogic and mathematics, are confirmed “only” as\n“corporate bodies.” (It’s not clear what entitles\nQuine to this crucial “only,” but his doctrine has been\nread as standardly including it; see Rey 1998, 2013, for discussion).\nCertainly, though, as an observation about the revisability of claims\nof logic and meaning, Quine’s claim can seem plausible. As\nPutnam (1968 [1975]) argued, enlarging on Quine’s theme, it\ncould turn out to be rational to revise even elementary logic in view\nof the surprising results of quantum\n mechanics.[5]\n It is certainly not hard to imagine discovering that a homely\npurported analytic truth, such as “cats are animals,”\ncould be given up in light of discovering that the little things are\nreally cleverly disguised robots controlled from Mars (Putnam, 1962;\nsee Katz, 1990, pp. 216ff, and G. Russell, 2008, for replies). \nQuine’s discussion of the role of convention in science seems\nright; but how about the role of meaning in ordinary natural language?\nIs it really true that in the “pale grey lore” of all the\nsentences we accept, there aren’t some that are\n“white” somehow “by virtue of the very meanings of\ntheir words”? What about our examples in our earlier set II?\nWhat about sentences of the sort that interest Juhl and Loomis (2010)\nthat merely link patent synonyms, as in “Lawyers are\nattorneys,” or “A fortnight is a period of fourteen\ndays”? As Grice and Strawson (1956) and Putnam (1965 [1975])\npointed out, it is unlikely that so intuitively plausible a\ndistinction should turn out to have no basis at all in\nfact. \nQuine addresses this issue, first, in his (1953 [1980], chapters 1 and\n3), and then in a much larger way in chapter 2 of his (1960) and many\nsubsequent writings. In his (1953) he pressed his objection to\nanalyticity further to the very ideas of synonymy and the linguistic\nmeaning of an expression, on which, we saw, Frege’s criterion of\nanalyticity crucially relied. His objection is that he sees no way to\nmake any serious explanatory sense of them. He explores plausible\nexplanations in terms of “definition,”\n“intension,” “possibility,” and\n“contradiction,”, plausibly pointing out that each of\nthese notions stand in precisely as much need of explanation as\nsynonymy itself (recall our observation in §1.2 above regarding\nthe lack of overt contradiction in “married\nbachelor”). They form what seems to be\na—viciously?—small “closed curve in space”.\nThough they might be invoked to explain one another, they could not in\nthe end answer the challenge of how to distinguish an analytic claim\nfrom simply a tenaciously held belief. \nTo take a recent example, David Chalmers (2012) revisits\nCarnap’s (1955) proposal for basing synonymy on\n“intension” by way of eliciting a person’s judgments\nabout the extension of a term/concept in all possible\n worlds:[6] \nBut such a proposal only pushes the question back to how to\ndistinguish verdicts about “possible” cases based upon\nmeaning from those based upon (tenacious) belief. In the first place,\nthere are the likely peculiar beliefs respondents may have about\n“logical possibility.” Do they mean what (some) logicians\nmean, e.g., metaphysical or model-theoretic possibility, or do they\nmean what people usually mean, mere “conceivability”?\nSecondly, what about people’s sometimes reasonable resistance to\neven standard deductive logic (again, see Williamson, 2007, chapter 4;\nand \n footnote 2\nabove)? And, thirdly, and most importantly, how is one\nto disconfound genuine verdicts about meaning from convictions due to\nmere dogmatic resistance, or to failures of imagination, as arguably\noccurs when people initially resist non-Euclidean geometries, General\nRelativity or quantum mechanics, where even physicists have\nhistorically gone wrong? Well, perhaps we should limit people’s\nverdicts to those involving the term or concept\n“univocally,” or with “the same meaning.” But\nthen, of course, we’d be relying on the very notion of\n“same meaning” and analyticity that the appeal to\npeople’s intensions was being invoked to explain. Although, to\nbe sure, as many have noted (e.g., Williamson, 2007, p.50), there may\nbe explanatory circularities in the best of theories, the circularity\nhere seems particularly vicious, with the relevant notions appearing\nnot to perform any explanatory work other than bringing in each\nother’s laundry (we’ll turn to further explanatory work\nthat neither Quine, Carnap nor most of their followers have\nconsidered, in §4.4 below). \nIndeed, in a way the best argument that Quine at least implicitly\nraises against the analytic and its kin is precisely that they perform\nno serious scientific explanatory work, and this he attempts to show\nby providing what he takes to be a satisfactory explanation of human\nlanguage without them. In his (1960, 1973) he sketches a behavioristic\ntheory of language that doesn’t rely on the postulation of\ndeterminate meaning or reference. He argues that translation (i.e.,\nthe identification of two expressions from different languages as\nhaving the same meaning) is “indeterminate”; there is\n“no fact of the matter” about whether two expressions do\nor do not have the same meaning (see Indeterminacy of\nTranslation). This would appear to imply that there are pretty\nmuch no facts of the matter about people’s mental lives at all!\nFor, if there is no fact of the matter about whether two people mean\nthe same thing by their words, then there is no fact of the matter\nabout whether they ever have mental states with the same content; and\nconsequently no fact of the matter about the content of anyone’s\nthoughts. Quine himself took this consequence in stride—he was,\nafter all, a behaviorist– regarding it as “of a\npiece” with Brentano’s thesis of the irreducibility of the\nintentional; it’s just that for him, unlike for Brentano, it\nsimply showed the “baselessness of intentional idioms and the\nemptiness of a science of intention” (1960, p.221). Needless to\nsay, many subsequent philosophers have not been happy with this view,\nand have wondered where Quine’s argument went wrong. \nOne reservation many have had about Quine’s argument is about\nhow to explain the appearance of the analytic. Most people,\nfor example, would distinguish our original two sets of sentences\n(§1), by saying that sentences of the second set, such as\n“All ophthalmologists are eye doctors,” could be known to\nbe true just by knowing the meanings of the constituent words.\nMoreover, they might agree about an indefinite number of further\nexamples, e.g., that pediatricians are doctors for children,\ngrandfathers are parents of parents, that sauntering is a kind of\nmovement, pain a mental state, and food, stuff that nourishes living\nthings. Again, as Grice and Strawson (1956) and Putnam (1965 [1975])\nstressed, it’s implausible to suppose that there’s\nnothing people are getting at in these judgments. \nHere, once again, Quine invoked his metaphor of the web of belief,\nclaiming that sentences are more or less revisable, depending upon how\n“peripheral” or “central” their position is in\nthe web. The appearance of sentences being “analytic” is\nsimply due to their being, like the laws of logic and mathematics,\ncomparatively central, and so are given up, if ever, only under\nextreme pressure from the peripheral forces of experience. But no\nsentence is absolutely immune from revision; all sentences are thereby\nempirical, and none is actually analytic. \nThere are a number of problems with this explanation. In the first\nplace, centrality and the appearance of analyticity don’t seem\nto be so closely related. As Quine (1960, p.66) himself noted, there\nare are plenty of central, unrevisable beliefs that don’t seem\nanalytic, e.g., “There have been black dogs,” “The\nearth has existed for more than five years,” “Mass-energy\nis conserved”; and many standard examples of what seems analytic\naren’t seriously central: “Bachelors are\nunmarried” and “Aunts are female” are of no central\nimportance, and could easily be revised if someone really cared (cf.\nJuhl and Loomis, 2010:118).  \nSecondly, it’s not mere unrevisability that seems distinctive of\nthe analytic, but rather a certain sort of unintelligibility:\nfor all the unrevisability of “Some people have eyes,”\nit’s perfectly possible to imagine it to be false. In\ncontrast, what’s peculiar about the analytic is that denials of\nit often seem unintelligible: it seems impossible to imagine a married\nbachelor. Indeed, far from unrevisability explaining analyticity, it\nwould seem to be analyticity that explains unrevisability: the only\nreason one balks at denying bachelors are unmarried is that\nthat’s just what “bachelor” means!  \nIt is important to note here a crucial change that Quine (and earlier\nPositivists) casually introduced into the characterization of the\na priori, and consequently into much of the now common\nunderstanding of the analytic. Where Kant and others had traditionally\nassumed that the a priori concerned beliefs\n“justifiable independently of experience,” Quine and many\nother philosophers of the time came to regard it as consisting of\nbeliefs “unrevisable in the light of experience.” And, as\nwe have seen, a similar status is accorded the at least apparently\nanalytic. However, this would imply that someone’s taking\nsomething to be analytic or a priori would have to regard\nherself as being infallible about it, forever unwilling to\nrevise it in light of further evidence or argument. But this is a\nfurther claim that many defenders of the traditional notions need not\nembrace. A claim might be in fact analytic and justifiable\nindependently of experience, but nevertheless perfectly revisable in\nthe light of it. Experience, after all, might mislead us, as it\n(perhaps) misled Putnam when he suggested revising logic in light of\ndifficulties in quantum mechanics, or suggested revising “cats\nare animals,” were we to discover the things were robots. Just\nwhat claims are genuinely analytic might not be available at the\nintrospective or behavioral surface of our lives, in merely our\ndispositions to assent or dissent from sentences, as Quine (1960)\nsupposes. The relevant dispositions might be hidden more deeply in our\npsychology, and our access to them as fallible as our access to any\nother such facts about ourselves. The genuinely analytic may be a\nmatter of reflective philosophical analysis or abstract linguistic\ntheory (see Bonjour, 1998, Rey, 1998, Field, 2000, and §4.3 below\nfor further discussion). \nIn his important commentary on Quine’s discussion, Hilary Putnam\n(1962 [1975]) tried to rescue what he thought were theoretically\ninnocuous examples of analytic truths by appeal to what he called\n“one-criterion” concepts, or concepts like, e.g.,\n[bachelor], [widow], [ophthalmologist], where there seems to be only\none “way to tell” whether they apply. However, as Fodor\n(1998) pointed out, so stated, this latter account won’t suffice\neither, since the notion of “criterion” seems no better\noff than “analytic.” Moreover, if there were just one way\nto tell what’s what, there would seem, trivially, to be\nindefinite numbers of different ways: look for some reliable correlate\n(living alone for bachelor), or, just ask someone\nwho knows the one way; or ask someone who knows someone who knows;\nor…, etc., and so now we would be faced with saying which of\nthese ways is genuinely “criterial,” which would seem to\nleave us with the same problem we faced in saying which way is\n“analytic.” \nFodor (1998) tries to improve on Putnam’s proposal by suggesting\nthat a criterion that appears to be analytic is the one on which all\nthe other criteria depend, but which does not depend upon\nthem. Thus, telling that someone is a bachelor by checking out his\ngender and marriage status doesn’t depend upon telling by asking\nhis friends, but telling by asking his friends does depend upon\ntelling by his gender and marriage status; and so we have an\nexplanation of why “bachelors are unmarried males” seems\nanalytic, but, says Fodor, without it’s actually being so\n(perhaps somewhat surprisingly, given his general “asymmetric\ndependence” theory of content, see his 1990b and cf. Horwich,\n1998, and Rey, 2009, to be discussed shortly,\n§§4.2–4.3.) \nHowever, such asymmetric dependencies among criteria alone will not\n“explain (away)” either the reality or the appearance of\nthe analytic, since there would appear to be asymmetric dependencies\nof the proposed sort in non-analytic cases. Natural kinds are dramatic\ncases in point (see Putnam 1962, 1970 [1975], 1975). At some stage in\nhistory probably the only way anyone could tell whether something was\na case of polio was to see whether there was a certain constellation\nof standard symptoms; other ways (including asking others)\nasymmetrically depended upon that way. But this wouldn’t make\n“All polio cases exhibit the standard symptoms” remotely\nanalytic—after all, the standard symptoms for many diseases can\nsometimes be misleading. It’s reasonable to suppose that with\nfurther research, there could in principle come to be better ways to\ntell (which is, of course, precisely what happened). \nIndeed, these cases of “deep” natural kinds contrast\ndramatically with cases of more superficial kinds like\n“bachelor,” whose nature is pretty much exhausted by the\nlinguistics of the matter. Again, unlike the case of polio and its\nsymptoms, the reason that gender and marriage status are the best way\nto tell whether someone is a bachelor is that that’s just what\n“bachelor” means. Indeed, should a doctor propose\nrevising the test for polio in the light of better\ntheory—perhaps reversing the dependency of certain\ntests—this would not even appear to involve a change in the\nmeaning. Should, however, a feminist propose, in the light of better\npolitics, revising the use of “bachelor” to include women,\nthis obviously would. If the appearance of the analytic is to be\nexplained away, it needs to account for such differences in our\nunderstanding of different sorts of verbal revisions. \nThere has been a wide variety of responses to Quine’s attack.\nSome, for example, Davidson (1980), Stich (1983) and Dennett (1987),\nseem simply to accept it and try to account for our practice of\nmeaning ascription within its “non-factual” bounds. Since\nthey follow Quine in at least claiming to forswear the analytic, we\nwill not consider their views further here. Others, who might be\n(loosely) called “neo-Cartesians,” reject Quine’s\nattack as simply so much prejudice of the empiricism and naturalism\nthat they take to be his own uncritical dogmas (§4.1 in what\nfollows). Still others hope simply to find a way to break out of the\n“intentional circle,” and provide an account of at least\nwhat it means for one thing (a state of the brain, for example) to\nmean (or “carry the information about”) another external\nphenomenon in the world (§4.2). Perhaps the most trenchant\nreaction has been that of empirically oriented linguists and\nphilosophers, who look to a specific explanatory role the\nanalytic may play in an account of thought and talk (§4.3). This\nrole is currently being explored in considerable detail in the now\nvarious areas of research inspired by the important linguistic\ntheories of Noam Chomsky (§4.4). \nThe most unsympathetic response to Quine’s challenges has been\nessentially to stare him down and insist upon an inner faculty of\n“intuition” whereby the truth of certain claims is simply\n“grasped” directly through, as Bonjour (1998) puts it: \nBealer (1987, 1999) defends similar proposals. Neither Bonjour nor\nBealer are in fact particularly concerned to defend the analytic by\nsuch claims, but their recourse to mere understanding of propositional\ncontent is certainly what many defenders of the analytic have had in\nmind. Katz (1998, pp. 44–5), for example, made the very same\nappeal to intuitions explicitly on behalf of the analytic claims\nsupported by his semantic theory (although he could also be\ninterpreted as sometimes having adopted the more sophisticated\nstrategy of §4.3 below). Somewhat more modestly, Peacocke (1992,\n2005) claims that possession of certain logical concepts requires that\na person find certain inferences “primitively compelling,”\nor compelling not by reason of some inference or in any way that takes\n“their correctness…as answerable to anything else”\n(1992, p.6) (see the references in \n footnote 3 \nfor further discussion and \n footnote 2\nfor worries about the strategy). \nPerhaps the most modest reply along these lines emerges from a\nsuggestion of David Lewis (1972 [1980]), who proposes to implicitly\ndefine common, e.g., psychological terms by\n“platitudes”: \nHe later (1994, p. 416) amends this suggestion to allow for the\n“folk theory” that may tacitly underlie our ordinary use\nof, e.g., mental terms. Enlarging on this idea, Frank Jackson (1998)\nemphasizes the role of intuitions about possible cases, as well as the\nneed sometimes to massage such intuitions so as to arrive at\n“the hypothesis that best makes sense of [folk] responses”\n(p. 36; see also pp. 34–5 and Slote\n 1966).[7] \nThe Quinean reply to all these approaches as they stand is pretty\nstraightforward, and, in a way, expresses what many regard as the real\nheart of his challenge to all proponents of the analytic: how in the\nend are we to distinguish such claims of “rational\ninsight,” “primitive compulsion,” inferential\npractice or folk belief, from merely some deeply held empirical\nconviction, indeed, from mere dogma? Isn’t the history of\nthought littered with what have turned out to be deeply mistaken\nclaims, inferences and platitudes that people at the time have found\n“rationally” and/or “primitively compelling,”\nsay, with regard to God, sin, biology, sexuality, or even patterns of\nreasoning themselves? Again, consider the resistance Kahneman (2011)\nreports people displaying to correction of the fallacies they commit\nin a surprising range of ordinary thought (cf. \n footnote 2 \nabove); or\nin a more disturbing vein, how the gifted mathematician, John Nash,\nclaimed that his delusional ideas “about supernatural beings\ncame to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did” (Nasar\n1998, p. 11). Introspected episodes, primitive compulsions, intuitions\nabout possibilities, or even tacit folk theories alone are not going\nto distinguish the analytic, since these all may be due as much to\npeople’s empirical theories as to any special knowledge of\n meaning.[8] \nA particularly vivid way to feel the force of Quine’s challenge\nis afforded by a recent case that came before the Ontario Supreme\nCourt concerning whether laws that confined marriage to heterosexual\ncouples violated the equal protection clause of the constitution (see\nHalpern et al. 2001). The question was regarded as turning in\npart on the meaning of the word “marriage”, and each party\nto the dispute solicited affidavits from philosophers, one of whom\nclaimed that the meaning of the word was tied to heterosexuality,\nanother that it wasn’t. Putting aside the complex\nsocio-political issues, Quine’s challenge can be regarded as a\nreasonably sceptical request to know precisely what the argument is\nabout, and how any serious theory of the world might settle it. It\ncertainly wouldn’t be sufficient merely to claim that marriage\nis/isn’t necessarily heterosexual on the basis of\n“platitudes,” much less on “an act of rational\ninsight [into] the propositional content itself”; or because\nspeakers found the inference from marriage to heterosexuality\n“primitively compelling” and couldn’t imagine gay\npeople getting married! (In this connection see also the—for\nmany—equivocal data of “experimental philosophy” in\n§4.4 below.) If Cartesians are to reply to Quine by appeal to\ninternal rules and roles, they’re going to have sort through\nthese and related complexities in understanding people’s\nintuitive responses. \nExternalist theories try to meet at least part of Quine’s\nchallenge by considering how matters of meaning need not rely on\nconnections among thoughts or beliefs, in the way that the tradition\nhad encouraged philosophers to suppose, but as involving relations\nbetween words and the phenomena in the world that they pick out. This\nsuggestion gradually emerged in the work of Putnam (1962 [1975], 1965\n[1975] and 1975), Kripke (1972 [1980]) and Burge (1979, 1986), but it\ntakes the form of positive theories in, e.g., the work of Dretske\n(1981, 1988) Fodor (1987, 1990b, 1992) and Devitt (2015), who try to\nbase meaning in various actual or co-variation relations between\nstates of the mind/brain and external phenomena (see indicator\nsemantics); and in the work of Millikan (1984), Papineau (1987)\nand Neander (1995, 2017), who look to mechanisms of natural selection.\n \nFodor (1987, 1990b), for example, claims\n that[9] \na symbol S means p if \nThus, tokenings of “horse” mean horse because\nthere are (say, optimal viewing) conditions under which tokenings of\n“horse” co-vary with horses, and tokenings of\n“horse” caused by “cows” asymmetrically depend\nupon that fact. The intuitive idea here is that what makes\n“horse” mean horse is that errors and other tokenings of\n“horse” in the absence of horses depend upon being able to\nget things right, but not vice versa: getting things right\ndoesn’t depend upon getting them wrong. Fodor’s and\nrelated proposals are not without their problems (see Loewer 1996 and\nthe entry on\n causal theories of mental content).\n But if something like them were right, they would go some way towards\nsaving at least intentional psychology from Quine’s\nchallenge. \nHowever, even if these strategies were to save meaning and\nintentionality, they would do so only by forsaking the high hopes we\nnoted in §2 philosophers harbored for the analytic. For\nexternalists are typically committed to counting expressions as\n“synonymous” if they happen to be linked in the right way\nto the same external phenomena, even if a thinker couldn’t\nrealize that they are by reflection alone. Consequently, by\nat least the Fregean criterion, they would seem to be committed to\ncounting as “analytic” many patently empirical sentences\nas “Water is H2O,” “Salt is NaCl”\nor “Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens,” since in each of these\ncases, something may co-vary in the relevant way with tokenings of the\nexpression on one side of the identity if and only if it co-varies\nwith tokenings of the one on the other (similar problems and others\narise for teleosemantics; see the entry on\n teleological theories of mental content). \nOf course, an externalist might cheerfully just allow that\nsome analytic truths, e.g., “water is H20,” are\nin fact “external” and subject to empirical\n(dis)confirmation. Such a view would actually comport well with an\nolder philosophical tradition less interested in the meanings of our\nwords and concepts, and more interested in the “essences”\nof the worldly phenomena they pick out. Locke (1690 [1975], II, 31,\nvi), for example, posited “real” essences of things rather\nalong the lines resuscitated by Putnam (1975) and Kripke (1972\n[1980]), the real essences being the conditions in the world\nindependent of our thought that make something the thing it is. Thus,\nbeing H2O is what makes something water, and (to take the\nstriking examples of diseases noted by Putnam, 1962) being the\nactivation of a certain virus is what makes something polio). But, of\ncourse, such an external view would still dash the hopes of\nphilosophers looking to the analytic to explain a priori\nknowledge (see Bealer 1987 and Jackson 1998 for strategies to\nassimilate such empirical cases to nevertheless a priori\nanalysis). Such a consequence, however, might not faze an externalist\nlike Fodor (1998), who is concerned only to save intentional\npsychology, and might otherwise share Quine’s scepticism about\nthe analytic and a priori. \nAn interesting possibility raised by an Externalist theory is that the\nbeliefs that are responsible for a person’s competence with a\nterm or concept might turn out actually to be false. Kripke (1972/80)\npointed out how the descriptions associated with the use of a term\nmight actually not apply to its intended referent. Thus, “the\ndiscover of America” could have been used to introduce the name\n“Columbus,” which might stick to it even if the discoverer\nturned out to be someone else (as it almost surely has done). And\nPutnam (1975) went on to suggest that part of the competence\nconditions with a term might involve both some kind of external\nrelation to the term’s referent, and stereotypical beliefs,\ne.g., that lemons are yellow, tigers striped, water a liquid, even\nthough it’s perfectly possible for there to be exceptions to\nsuch claims. It may be essential to knowing the meaning of a term at\nleast that such claims are regularly believed by users of it. On this\naccount, then, a claim might turn out to be analytic and\n false![10]\n A competent user perhaps needs at least to “feel the\npull” of certain claims, such as that tigers are striped, which\nshe might ultimately nevertheless recognize to be mistaken (in\nPeacocke’s 1992 phrase, they might feel a “primitive\ncompulsion” in this regard—even if it turned out to be a\ncompulsion they need to learn to resist!). Rather than understanding\n“analytic” to mean “known to be true by\nvirtue of meaning,” one might understand it merely as\n“justified by virtue of meaning,” a prima\nfacie justification that simply could be overridden by other,\nglobal theoretical considerations (pace Juhl and Loomis\n2010:270, the analytic may simply involve defeasible\nconstraints; cf., Rey 2009 and below). \nA promising strategy for replying to Quine’s challenge that\nmight begin to provide what the neo-Cartesian wants can be\nfound in recent proposals of Michael Devitt (1996, 2002) and,\nindependently, of Paul Horwich (1998, 2005). They emphasize how the\nmeaning properties of a term are the ones that play a basic\nexplanatory role with regard to the use of a term generally, the ones\nin virtue ultimately of which a term is used with that meaning. For\nexample, the use of “red” to refer to the color of blood,\nroses, stop signs, etc,. is arguably explained by its use to refer to\ncertain colors in good light, but not vice versa: the latter\nuse is “basic” to all the other uses. Similarly, uses of\n“and” explanatorily depend upon its basic use in\ninferences to and from the sentences it conjoins. Devitt and Horwich\ndiffer about the proper locus of such a strategy. Horwich thinks of it\nmainly with regard to the use of terms in natural language, and only\nmarginally allows what Devitt (2002) argues is required, that it be\napplied primarily to terms in a “language of thought.” \nThere are several potential problems with these strategies. The first\nis that merely appealing to a “basic explanatory”\ncondition for the use of a word doesn’t distinguish misuses and\nmetaphors from etymologies, derived idioms and “dead\nmetaphors”: saying “Juliet is the sun” can be\nexplained by the use of “sun” to refer to the sun, but so\nis “lobbying” explained by the use of “lobby”\nfor lobbies of buildings (where politicians often met) and “the\neye of a needle” by the shape of a human eye. In these latter\ncases, the words seem to take on meanings of their own that, while\nthey are explained by original “basic” uses, they are, so\nto say, no longer “governed” by them. Here it may be worth\nsomehow combining the Devitt-Horwich view with Fodor’s\naforementioned cousin suggestion of the synchronic asymmetric\ncounterfactual (cf. Rey 2009): the new “dead” uses of an\nidiom or metaphor no longer asymmetrically depend upon the\nexplanatorily basic use. “Eye of a needle” would still\nmean the hole at the end of a needle, even if “eye” no\nlonger referred to a human eye.  \nA second problem, however, is that they still risk Quinean scepticism\nabout meaning and the analytic. For, if Quine (1960) is right about\nthe psychology of language use, then there may be no sufficiently\nlocal explanatorily basic facts on which all other uses of a term\ndepend. To take the kind of case that most interested Quine, it\ncertainly seems unlikely that there is some small set of uses of at\nleast theoretic terms in science, say “electron” or\n“mass,” that are explanatorily basic, on which all other\nuses really asymmetrically depend: again, revision may touch any\nparticular claim in the interests of overall explanatory adequacy.\nUses of a term involved in the expression of belief, either in thought\nor talk, will likely be explained by the same processes of\nconfirmation that Quine argued were dependent on the character of\none’s belief system as a whole, and not upon some local feature\nof that system in the way that an “analytic” claim would\nhave to be (cf. Gibbard 2008). Of course, Quine might be wrong about\ntaking the case of theoretic terms in science to be representative of\nterms in human psychology generally. But, to put it lightly, the\nverdict on that issue is not quite in (see Fodor 1983, 2000 for a\nperhaps surprising endorsement of Quine’s view, and the next\nsection for some qualified alternatives to it). \nIn any case, a third drawback of this strategy is that it risks\nrendering matters of meaning far less “transparent” and\nintrospectively accessible than Cartesians have standardly supposed.\nFor there is little reason to suppose that what is explanatorily basic\nabout one’s use of a term in thought or talk is a matter that is\navailable to introspection or common knowledge. As in the case of\n“marriage” mentioned earlier, but certainly with respect\nto other philosophically problematic notions, just which properties,\nif any, are explanatorily basic may not be an issue that is at all\neasy to determine. \nIndeed, arguably a crucial defect of much of the discussion of the\nanalytic we have considered so far is that it is too confined to\nsurface phenomena, either introspective or behavioral. This\nis probably at least partly due to the traditional view that\nintrospection and ordinary behavior are our only access to the mind.\nBut suppose we thought of the analytic more on the analogy of, say,\nwhat’s metabolic or pulmonary, where surface\nphenomena, e.g., chronic fatigue, may be merely symptomatic,\nnot constitutive of features of one or the other system. A\nsentence’s being analytic may be constituted not by\nsomeone’s intuitive verdicts or dispositions to behave, but by\nits etiology in one rather than another subsystem of the\nmind. Such, at any rate, has been the strategy pursued for the last\nsixty years or so by the linguist, Noam Chomsky (1965, 1986) who\ninsists that a theory of language in general should focus on\nspeakers’ underlying “competence” with the\nrules of a language, not with their surface\n“performance”. \nBeginning in the 1950s, Chomsky (1965, 1968 [2006]) began to\nrevolutionize linguistics by presenting substantial evidence and\narguments for the existence of a “generative” grammar\nthat, he argued, was the basis for people’s underlying\ncompetence to speak and understand natural languages. This opened up\nthe possibility of a response to Quine’s (1960) scepticism about\nthe analytic within his own naturalistic framework, just freed of its\nodd behaviorism, which had been independently empirically refuted (see\nChomsky 1959, and Gleitman, Gross and Reisberg 2011, chapter 7). \nThe data that concerned Chomsky, himself, have largely concerned\nsyntactic properties of natural language, but he sometimes construes\nthem broadly to include at least some “analytic” examples,\nas when he writes, “it seems reasonable to suppose that semantic\nrelations between words like persuade, intend, believe, can be\nexpressed in purely linguistic terms (namely: if I persuade you to go,\nthen you intend to go)…” (Chomsky 1977 [1998], p. 142).\nAlong these lines (and in arguments that could be sustained\nindependently of the appeals to intuition we considered in §4.1),\nKatz (1972) drew attention to related semantic data, such as\nsubjects’ agreements about, e.g., synonymy, redundancy,\nantonymy, and implication, and developed a theory systematically\nrelating syntactic and semantic structure to account for them (see\nPietroski 2005, and forthcoming, for more recent and cautious\nsuggestions along related lines). Since, as we have seen (§3.7),\nthe explanations offered by Quine, Putnam and Fodor in terms of\ncentrality and/or preferred ways of telling seem simply empirically\ninadequate, perhaps the best explanation of these phenomena are to be\nhad in a theory of the human language faculty. \nIt might be thought that appeals to such data beg the question against\nQuine, since, as Quine (1967) pointed out, so much as asking subjects\nto say whether two expressions are synonymous, antonymous, or\nimplicative is simply transferring the burden of determining what is\nbeing discussed from the theorist to the informant. Imagine, again, a\nperson being asked whether “2+1=3,” “Monday precedes\nTuesday,” and “Marriage entails heterosexuality” are\nmatters known to be true by virtue of “the meanings of the\nwords.” One can sympathize with someone being at a loss as to\nwhat to say. In any case, what is the possible significance of\npeople’s answers? Do they manifest the analytic or merely an\nentrenched belief? \nThe Chomskyan actually has the seed of an interesting reply. For part\nof Chomsky’s view has to do with the modularity of the natural\nlanguage faculty: whether a sentence is grammatical or not depends not\non its relation to our thought and communicative projects, but\nentirely on its conformity with the internal principles of that\nspecific faculty. It is easy for us to produce in our behavior strings\nof words that may communicate information effectively, but which may\nviolate those principles. An ungrammatical sentence like “Who do\nyou wanna sneeze?” might get uttered, but go unnoticed as such\nand suffice on occasion for thought and communication (of “Who\ndo you want to sneeze?”), but it’s a striking fact that\nspeakers of English—even four-year old ones!—nevertheless\ndon’t utter it when given the chance (see Crain and Lillo-Martin\n1999). The existence of the language faculty as a separate faculty may\nsimply be an odd, but psychologically real fact about us, and it may\nthereby supply a real basis for commitments about not only what is or\nisn’t grammatical, but about what is or isn’t a matter of\nnatural language meaning. On this view, if one were to deny an\nanalytic truth, one would simply be violating a principle of\none’s natural language, which, on Chomskyan views, it’s\nperfectly possible to do: people often speak in a way that appears to\nviolate patent analyticities (“Ann is his real mother, despite\nZoe being his biological one,” “Carl’s still really\na bachelor, even though he’s been married for years”), and\nscientists regularly do so with their introduction of technical ways\nof talking about, e.g., “force”, “mass” and\n“energy”. Indeed, at least in some cases one might combine\na Chomskyan view with an Externalist one, and allow that some of the\nmeaning-constitutive rules for a term can turn out to be false\n(§4.2 above). \nThe burden of such a reply lies, however, in actually producing a\nlinguistic theory that sustains a principled class of sentences that\ncould be isolated in this way and that, per the suggestion of\n§4.3, might play the basic explanatory role of meaning. This is\nsomething that, as yet, it is by no means obvious that it can do.\nFodor et al (1975) raised doubts about whether any kind of\n“semantic decomposition” is psychologically real, and\nFodor (1970, 1998) has contested some of the most prized examples of\nanalyticities, such as (10) in our initial set II (see §1 above),\nlinking killing to death (but see Pietroski 2002 for a reply).\nMoreover, many linguists (e.g., Jackendoff 1992, Pustejovsky 1995)\nproceed somewhat insouciantly to include under issues of\n“meaning” and “conceptual structure”, issues\nthat are patently matters of just ordinary belief and sometimes mere\nphenomenology. For example, Jackendoff and others have called\nattention to the heavy use of spatial metaphors in many grammatical\nconstructions. But such facts don’t entail that the concepts of\nthe domains to which these metaphors are applied –say, the\nstructure of the mind, social relations, or mathematics—are,\nthemselves, somehow intrinsically spatial, or really thought by anyone\nto be. People may find it useful to conceive of these domains\nin spatial ways. However, conceptions—ordinary beliefs,\nmetaphors, associations—are one thing; people’s\nconcepts quite another: two mathematicians, after all, can\nhave the thought that there is no largest prime, even if one of them\nthinks of numbers spatially and the other purely algebraically. \nIn considering Chomskyan theories of the analytic, it is important to\nbear in mind that, while the theory may be as methodologically\nempiricist as any theory ought to be, the theory itself explicitly\nrejects empiricist conceptions of meaning and mind themselves. Chomsky\nis famous for having resuscitated Rationalist doctrines of\n“innate ideas,” according to which many ideas have their\norigins not in experience, but in our innate endowment. And\nthere’s certainly no commitment in semantic programs like those\nof Katz, Jackendoff or Pustejovsky to anything like the\n“reduction” of all concepts to the sensori-motor\nprimitives eyed by the Positivists. Of course, just how we come by the\nmeaning of whatever primitive concepts their theories do endorse, is a\nquestion they would seriously have to confront, cf. Fodor (1990b,\n1998). \nRecently, some philosophers have offered some empirical evidence that\nmight be taken to undermine these efforts to empirically ground the\nanalytic, casting doubt on just how robust the data for the analytic\nmight be. The movement of “experimental philosophy” has\npointed to evidence of considerable malleability of subject’s\n“intuitions” with regard to the standard kinds of thought\nexperiments on which defenses of analytic claims typically rely. Thus,\nWeinberg, Nichols and Stich (2001) found significant cultural\ndifferences between responses of Asians and Western students regarding\nwhether someone counted as having knowledge in a standard\n“Gettier” (1963) example of accidental justified true\nbelief; and Knobe (2003) found that non-philosopher’s judgments\nabout whether an action is intentional depended on the (particularly\nnegative) moral qualities of the action, and not, as is presumed by\nmost philosophers, on whether the action was merely intended by the\nagent. Questions, of course, could be raised about these experimental\nresults (How well did the subjects understand the project of assessing\nintuitions? Did the experiments sufficiently control for the\nmultitudinous “pragmatic” effects endemic to polling\nprocedures? To what extent are the target terms merely polysemous,\nallowing for different uses in different contexts?). However, the\nresults do serve to show how the determination of meaning and analytic\ntruths can be regarded as a more difficult empirical question than\nphilosophers have traditionally supposed (see Bishop and Trout 2005\nand Alexander and Weinberg 2007 for extensive discussion). \nSuppose linguistics were to succeed in delineating a class of analytic\nsentences grounded in a special language faculty. Would such sentences\nserve the purposes for which we noted earlier (§2) philosophers\nhad enlisted them? Perhaps some of them would. An empirical grounding\nof the analytic might provide us with an understanding of what\nconstitutes a person’s competence with a concept. Given that\nQuinean scepticism about the analytic is a source of his scepticism\nabout the determinacy of cognitive states (see §3.6 above), such\na grounding may be crucial for a realistic psychology. \nMoreover, setting out the constitutive conditions for possessing a\nconcept might be of some interest to philosophers generally, since\nmany of the crucial questions they ask concern the proper\nunderstanding of ordinary notions such as material object, person,\naction, freedom, god, the good, or the beautiful.\nSuppose, further, that a domain, such as perhaps ethics or aesthetics,\nare “response dependent,” constituted by the\nunderlying rules of our words and concepts; suppose, that is, that\nthese rules exhaustthe nature of, say, the good, the funny,\nor the beautiful. If so, then it might not be implausible to claim\nthat successful conceptual analysis could provide us with some a\npriori knowledge of such domains. \nBut, of course, many philosophers have wanted more than these\nessentially psychological gains. They have hoped that analytic claims\nmight provide a basis for a priori knowledge of domains that\nexist independently of us and not exhausted by our concepts.\nAn important case in point would seem to be the very case of\narithmetic that motivated much of the discussion of the analytic in\nthe first place. Recent work of Crispin Wright (1983) and others on\nthe logicist program has shown how a version of Frege’s program\nmight be rescued by appealing not to his problematic Basic Law V, but\ninstead merely to what he calls “Hume’s Principle,”\nor the claim that for the number of Fs to be equal to the number of Gs\nis for there to be a “one-to-one correspondence” between\nthe Fs and the Gs (as in the case of the fingers of a normal right\nhand and a left one). According to what is now regarded as\n“Frege’s Theorem,” the Peano axioms for arithmetic\ncan be derived from this principle in standard second-order logic (see\n Frege’s theorem and foundations for arithmetic).\n Now, Wright has urged that Hume’s Principle might be regarded\nas analytic, and perhaps this claim could be sustained by an\nexamination of the language faculty along the lines of §4.4. If\nso, then wouldn’t that vindicate the suggestion that arithmetic\ncan be known a priori? \nNot obviously, since Hume’s Principle is a claim not merely\nabout the concepts F and G, but about the presumably\nconcept-independent fact about the number of things that are\nF and\nthe number of things that are G, and, we can ask, what\njustifies any claim about them? As Boolos (1997) asks in\nresponse to Wright: \nIndeed, as Zalta (2013) observes,  \nIt would certainly seem as if justifying Hume’s Principle would\ninvolve appealing to “the elegance and convenience which the\nhypothesis brings to the containing bodies of laws and data,”\ni.e., to our best overall theory of the world, precisely as Quine\nclaimed (§3.4). (see Wright 1999 and Horwich 2000 for further\ndiscussion) \nThe problem here becomes even more obvious in non-mathematical cases.\nFor example, philosophers have wanted to claim not merely that our\nconcepts of red and green exclude the possibility of our\nthinking that something is both colors all over, but that this\npossibility is ruled out for the actual colors, red and\ngreen, themselves (if such there be). It is therefore no accident that\nBonjour’s (1998, pp. 184–5) defense of a priori\nknowledge turns on including the very properties of red and green\nthemselves as constituents of the propositions we grasp. But it\nis just such a wonderful coincidence between merely our concepts and\nactual worldly properties that a linguistic semantics alone does not\nobviously ensure. \nBut suppose there in fact existed a wonderful correspondence between\nour concepts and the world, indeed, a deeply reliable, counterfactual\nsupporting correspondence whereby it was in fact metaphysically\nimpossible for certain claims constitutive of those concepts not to be\ntrue. This is, of course, not implausible in the case of logic and\narithmetic, and is entirely compatible with, e.g., Boolos’\nreasonable doubts about them (after all, it’s always possible to\ndoubt what is in fact a necessary truth). Such necessary\ncorrespondences between thought and the world might then serve as a\nbasis for claims to a priori knowledge in at least a\nreliabilist epistemology, where what’s important is not\na believer’s ability to justify his claims, but merely\nthe reliability of the processes by which he arrived at them.\nIndeed, in the case of logic and arithmetic, the beliefs might be\narrived at by steps that were not only necessarily reliable, but might\nalso be taken to be so by the believer, in ways that might in fact\ndepend in no way upon experience, but only on his competence with the\nrelevant concepts (Kitcher 1980, Rey 1998 and Goldman 1999 explore\nthis strategy). \nSuch a reliabilist approach, though, might be less than fully\nsatisfying to someone interested in the traditional analytic a\npriori. For, although someone might turn out in fact to have\nanalytic a priori knowledge of this sort, she might not know\nthat she does (reliabilist epistemologists standardly forgo the\n“KK Principle,” according to which if one knows that p,\none knows that knows that p). Knowledge that the relevant claims were\nknowable a priori might itself be only possible by an\nempirically informed understanding of, e.g., one’s language\nfaculty, and, à la Quine, by its consonance with the rest of\none’s theory of the world. But the trouble then is that claims\nthat people do have a capacity for a priori knowledge seems\nquite precarious. As we noted earlier \n (footnote 2), \npeople are often\nunreliable at appreciating deductively valid arguments; appreciating\nthe standard rules even of natural deduction is for many people often\na difficult intellectual achievement. Consequently, people’s\ngeneral competence with logical notions may not in fact consist in any\ngrip on valid logical rules; and so whatever rules do underlie that\ncompetence may well turn out not to be the kind of absolutely reliable\nguide to the world on which the above reliabilist defense of a\npriori analytic knowledge seems to depend. In any case, in view\nmerely of the serious possibility that these pessimistic conclusions\nare true, it’s hard to see how any appeal to the analytic to\nestablish the truth of any controversial claim in any mind-independent\ndomain could have any special justificatory force without a\nsufficiently detailed empirical psychological theory to back it\nup. \nBut even if we did have a true account of our minds and the semantic\nrules afforded by our linguistic and conceptual competence, it’s\nnot clear it would really serve the “arm-chair” purposes\nof traditional philosophy that we mentioned at the outset (§1).\nConsider, for example, the common puzzle about the possibility that\ncomputers might actually think and enjoy a mental life. In response to\nthis puzzle, some philosophers (e.g., Wittgenstein 1953 [1967], p.\n97e, Ziff 1959, and even Chomsky 2000, p44, himself) have suggested\nthat it’s analytic that a thinking thing must be alive, a\nsuggestion that certainly seems to accord with many folk intuitions\n(many people who might cheerfully accept a computational explanation\nof a thought process often balk at the suggestion that an inanimate\nmachine engaging in that computation would actually be thinking).\nSuppose this claim were sustained by a Chomskyan theory, showing that\nthe ordinary notion expressed by the natural language word\n“thinking” is, indeed, correctly applied only to living\nthings, and not to artifactual computers. Should this really satisfy\nthe person worried about the possibility of artificial thought?\nIt’s hard to see why. For the serious question that concerns\npeople worried about whether artifacts could think concerns whether\nthose artifacts could in fact share the real, theoretically\ninteresting, explanatory properties of being a thinking thing (cf.\nJackson 1998, pp. 34–5). We might have no reason to suppose that\nbeing alive actually figures among them, and so conclude that, despite\nthese (supposed) constraints of natural language, inanimate computers\ncould come to “think” after all. Indeed, perhaps the\nbelief that thinking things must be alive is an example of a false\nbelief that, we saw in §§4.2–4.3, an externalist\nChomskyan could claim is part of the constitutive conditions on\n“think” (again, one doesn’t have the concept unless\none feels the pull). \nAlternatively, one might argue that what the language faculty provides\nare not sentences with truth-conditions, but merely\ndefeasible constraints on how the sentence might be used by\nour conceptual system to express the truth conditional claims that\npeople make with the sentences (as in Sperber and Wilson 1995, Carsten\n2016, Pietroski 2002, 2005, and forthcoming, and Rey, 2009; cf.\n footnote 10 passim above). \nOf course, one could insist on\nadhering to whatever meaning constraints turn out to be imposed by\nnatural language and so, perhaps, deny that inanimate computers could\never think. But, if the explanatory point were correct, it would be\nhard to see how this would amount to anything more than a verbal\nquibble: so computers don’t “think”; they\n“think* instead.” (It’s a peculiar feature of the\nwhole discussion of the analytic that it can seem to turn on what may\nin the end be mere verbal quibbles.) \nIn sum: an account of the language faculty might provide a basis for\nascribing competence with the concepts that that faculty might deploy,\nand thereby a basis for intentional realism and a distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic claims. It might also provide a basis for\nanalytic a priori knowledge of claims about concept-dependent\ndomains, such as those of ethics and aesthetics. However, in the case\nof concept-independent domains, such as logic and mathematics, or the\nnature of worldly phenomena like life or mind, the prospects seem more\nproblematic. There may be analytic claims to be had here, but at least\nin these cases they would, in the immortal words of Putnam (1965\n[1975], p. 36), “cut no philosophical ice…bake no\nphilosophical bread and wash no philosophical windows.” We would\njust have to be satisfied with theorizing about the\nconcept-independent domains themselves, without being able\nto justify our claims about them by appeal to the meanings of\nour words alone.  Reflecting on the difficulties of the past\ncentury’s efforts on behalf of the analytic, it’s not\nclear why anyone would really want to insist otherwise.","contact.mail":"georey2@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
