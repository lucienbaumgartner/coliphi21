It’s a distinction that matters. You\nare likely to make more headway in a difficult task working with\nothers; and even if little progress is made, there’s at least the\ncomfort and solidarity that comes with a collective undertaking. Or,\nto take a very different perspective, the realization (or delusion)\nthat the many bits of rudeness one has been suffering of late are part\nof a concerted effort can be of significance in identifying\nwhat one is up against: the accumulation of grievances (no doubt well\ncatalogued) is seen, not as an unfortunate coincidence of affronts\nstemming from various quarters, but as itself a product of a unified\nexercise of agency. A paranoid conspiracy theorist is not usually to\nbe taken seriously. But he does get right that it certainly would be\nawful, for example, if everyone were out to get him and were\nworking together to do so.\n\n\nShared agency also has important normative implications. Institutions\nor laws established by everyone acting together have a status\ndifferent from those that are, for example, imposed on a people by the\ndictates of one. And the nature of justification, be it epistemic or\npractical, might depend on whether it figures in the context of a\nshared enterprise. No wonder, then, that shared activity and intention\nis of interest for a variety of disciplines, including politics,\nsocial science, economics, ethics, law, epistemology (especially\ntestimony and social epistemology), and psychology.\n\n\nBut what is it to act together? The question has received sustained\ndiscussion in contemporary philosophy of action. Central concerns have\nbeen to explicate the distinctive features of shared agency, and to\ninvestigate the possibility and scope of reduction: can shared agency\nbe understood in terms of the resources available to us from the study\nof individual agency? This entry will focus on some issues most\nclosely related to the philosophy of action. See the entry on\ncollective intentionality for a broader discussion. \n\nAgency is sometimes exercised in concert, as when we walk together,\nseveral individuals undertake painting a house, or a football team\nexecutes a pass\n play.[1]\n It is hardly controversial that there really is a phenomenon falling\nunder labels such as shared activity, and joint or\ncollective action. What is disputed is how to understand it.\nOne way to approach the issues here is to ask what distinguishes\nactions of individuals that together constitute shared activity from\nthose that amount to a mere aggregation of individual acts. What is\nleft over when we subtract what each of us did from what we did\n together?[2] \nConsider a case discussed by Searle (1990, 402). A number of\nindividuals are scattered about in a park. Suddenly it starts to rain,\nand each runs to a centrally located shelter. Although there may be\nsome coordination (people tend not to collide into one another),\nrunning to the shelter is not, in the relevant sense, something that\nwe do together. Now imagine another scenario with the same individuals\nexecuting the same movements but as members of a dance troop\nperforming a site-specific piece in that park. In both cases, there is\nno difference in the collection or “summation” of\nindividual behavior: A is running to the shelter, and B is running to\nthe shelter, etc. But the dancers are engaged in collective action,\nwhereas the storm panicked picnickers are not. \nSearle suggests that what distinguishes the two cases is not the\noutward behavior, but something “internal”. He hints that\nin the collective case, the outward behavior—everyone running to\nand converging on the shelter—is not a matter of\n coincidence.[3]\n It is, rather, explained as something aimed at by the\nparticipants. This suggests that the internal difference is a matter\nof intention. And, indeed, Searle sees it this way. In both\ncases, a participant has an intention expressed by “I am running\nto the shelter”. But in the collective case this intention\nsomehow derives from and is dependent upon an intention that\nnecessarily adverts to the others, one that might be expressed as\n“We are running to the shelter” (or perhaps “We are\nperforming the part of the piece where….”). It is this\n“we-intention” that distinguishes shared or collective\nactivity from a mere summation or heap of individual acts. \nPerhaps it’s premature to conclude, as Searle does, that there has\nto be an “internal” difference here. While most theorists treat\nintention as a psychological attitude (e.g. Davidson 1978, Harman\n1976, Bratman 1986), some work on intention influenced by Anscombe and\nWittgenstein (such as Wilson 1989 and Thompson 2008) understands\nintention fundamentally in terms of intentional action (see the entry\non intention for discussion). It remains to be seen how Anscombian\napproaches to shared agency will develop, though some forays into this\nterritory are to be found in Stoutland 1997 and Laurence 2010. \nAnother reservation with invoking intention at this point stems from\nconsideration of unintentional collective action. Appealing to\nintention as Searle does would seem to preclude what some see as a\nreal possibility: that there are φ-ings done jointly in some robust\nsense, but which are not intended under any description. One possible\nexample would be our jointly bringing about some severe environmental\ndamage. This might come about as a side effect of each of us pursuing\nour own projects. No subject intends the severe environmental damage,\nunder any description: no single individual has enough of an impact to\nintend anything that would count as severe environmental damage, and\nas a collective the polluters seem not to be sufficiently integrated\nto count as a subject of intention. Whether this really amounts to a\ncounterexample will depend on whether our damaging the environment was\njoint, a genuine exercise of shared agency. For discussion see Ludwig\n2007; 2016, 182, and Chant 2007. \nSetting aside these reservations, we can ask how the attitude of\nintention should be understood if it is to serve as a distinctive mark\nof joint action. One approach is to think of it as an attitude of a\npeculiar, supra-individual\n entity.[4]\n The intention whose content is expressed by We are running to the\nshelter is, on this view, an attitude had by whatever entity is\ndenoted by the ‘we’. On this view whenever people\nact together, they constitute a group that, in a non-figurative sense,\nintends. This entails that groups can be genuine agents and\nsubjects of intentional attitudes. \nSearle (1990, 406) rules this out of court, understandably and perhaps\ndogmatically reluctant to embrace a view that leads to a profusion of\nsupra-individual intentional subjects, group minds, or corporate\npersons whenever individuals act together. Such ontological profligacy\nis prompted in part by a straightforward interpretation of the\nlanguage we use to describe joint action, with the plural subject term\nunderstood simply as a referring expression. Ludwig 2016 suggests\ninstead that we think of the subject term as involving implicit\nrestricted quantification over members of the group. This proposal,\ncombined with a Davidsonian event analysis of action descriptions,\nprovides resources for an alternative rendering of the underlying\nlogical form of action descriptions, one that does not encourage the\nsupra-individual view. What would be required instead is that there be\nsome one event for which there is more than one\n agent.[5] \nThere is reason, moreover, to think that a strategy appealing to\nsupra-individual entities as subjects of intentional states is\nmisplaced if the social phenomenon in question is shared activity.\nIt’s not at all obvious that an individual who is a constituent of a\nsupra-individual entity is necessarily committed to what it\nis up to. For example, consider the U.S., which would on such a view\ncount as supra-individual entity. The U.S. increases research funding\nin physics in order to win the space race with the U.S.S.R. I’m a\ngraduate student benefitting from the additional funding, and I do\nresearch in rocket and satellite technology, and teach physics and\nengineering to undergraduates; indeed, I wouldn’t have gone into the\narea had it not been for the funding opportunities. I am in the\nrelevant sense a constituent of the larger entity - in this case the\nU.S. - but I have no concern with the space race. I’m just doing my\njob, advancing my career, hoping to raise a family and be able to pay\nthe mortgage, etc.; I frankly couldn’t care less about larger\ngeopolitical issues, which are presumably the concern of the\nsupra-individual entity that is the U.S. In contrast, a participant in\nshared activity arguably is committed to the collective endeavor and\nits aims - at least in the sense of commitment to an end implicated in\nany instance of intention or intentional action. So, while we\nhaven’t ruled out that there are supra-individual agents (see below\nfor more discussion), it’s not clear that we need to be committed to\nthem in order to understand shared activity.  \nIf shared activity does indeed involve commitment on the part of the\nindividual participants, then it seems that some intention-like\nelement of each individual’s psychology must realize or reflect the\nwe-intention that is the mark of shared\n activity.[6]\n The Intention Thesis attributes to each individual\nparticipant in shared activity an intention pertaining to that\nactivity. This participatory intention accounts for each\nindividual’s participatory commitment to the activity, and it serves\nto distinguish one’s action when it is done with others from action\ndone on one’s own.\n [7] \nSome of the discussion of the current literature on shared activity\ncan be understood as a debate about the nature of this participatory\nintention and how instances of it in different individuals must be\nrelated to one another so that the individuals could be said to act\ntogether, and share an intention (presumably the intention expressed\nwith the aforementioned we-locution). \nParticipatory intentions might, for example, be understood as an\ninstance of an ordinary intention, familiar from the study of\nindividual agency; if we-intentions are identified with, or built out\nof these participatory intentions, we would thus be offered the\nprospect of a reductive account of this we-intention in terms of\nordinary individual intentions. Tuomela and Miller 1988 defend such a\nview. Take an individual who is a member of a group. According to\nTuomela and Miller, this individual has a participatory intention with\nrespect to X if she intends to do her part in X, believes conditions\nfor success of X obtain, and believes that there is mutual belief\namongst members of the group that conditions for success\n obtain.[8]\n (Other work in this general vein include Bratman 1992, MacMahon 2001,\n2005, S. Miller 2001. Tuomela’s later work is rather different, as\nwill be noted below.) \nAs a counterexample to the reductive account, Searle imagines each\nmember of a business school graduating class, versed in Adam Smith’s\ntheory of the invisible hand, intending to pursue his selfish\ninterests and thereby intending to do his part in helping humanity.\nSuch an intention, even supplemented with the sort of beliefs that\nTuomela and Miller require, intuitively doesn’t count as the sort of\nintention one has when acting with others, and it is implausible to\nthink that these graduates go on to act collectively. And yet it seems\nto satisfy Tuomela and Miller’s\n analysis.[9]\n Searle’s diagnosis of the problem is that reductive approaches\ndon’t guarantee the element of cooperation that is essential to\nshared activity and necessarily reflected in the attitudes of the\nparticipant (1990, 406). And one cannot respond by inserting the\ncooperative element into the content of the intention, so that what\nthe agent intends is to do her part in shared activity. That\nwould in effect presuppose the notion for which we’re seeking an\naccount (1990,\n 405).[10] \nSearle, in contrast to Tuomela and Miller, insists that the\nindividual’s participatory intention (what he calls a collective\nintention) is primitive. The aforementioned “we-intention”\nturns out, for Searle, just to be an individual’s participatory\nintention. But though it is an attitude or state of an individual, it\nis a fundamentally different kind of intention, and not the sort of\nintention that figures in individual action. It should be mentioned\nthat this is a view with similarities to those held by Sellars and\nlater\n Tuomela.[11] \nSearle’s version of the intention thesis also involves a rejection\nof anti-individualism in the philosophy of mind (see the entry on\nexternalism about mental content). In particular, whether an\nindividual has this primitively collective participatory intention is\nindependent of what may be going on in the minds of others, or whether\nthere even are any others around her. Thinking to help you with your\nstalled car, I might have the collective intention expressed as we\nare pushing the car. And this is so, even if you’re just\nstretching your calves before a run and not trying to move the car,\nand even if I’m just hallucinating and there is no one\n around.[12] \nBe that as it may, whether one is sharing an intention and\nacting with others will depend, of course, on there being\nother agents with whom one is appropriately related. Suppose that each\nof several individuals has a participatory intention. How must they be\nrelated in order for those individuals to count as sharing an\nintention? Recall that for Searle, the participatory intention is\nprimitively collective and expressed, for example, as We will do\nA. Given this, one thing Searle presumably would require for the\nsharing of intentions is the co-extensiveness of the\nwe-element instanced in the intentions across the several\nindividuals. But this is not sufficient. No intention is shared if\nyours is for us to go to the beach this afternoon, whereas mine has us\ndoing something incompatible, like working all day in the library.\nEven if our intentions coincide on the action and the plural subject\nin question, if there is no agreement on how to go about it, or if we\neach fail even to accord any significant status to the other’s\nintentions, there would be no intention or action shared in this\ninstance. So, more needs to be said about the interrelations of the\nparticipatory intentions if they are to account for the coordination\nand cooperativeness we find in shared or joint activity. Searle is\nsilent on the matter; for what more to say, we need to turn\n elsewhere.[13] \nIn an influential series of papers, Bratman has developed a reductive\naccount of shared activity and shared\n intention.[14]\n He understands a shared intention to be an interpersonal structure of\nrelated intentions that serves to coordinate action and planning, as\nwell as structure bargaining between\n participants.[15]\n The individually held intentions that constitute this\nstructure—what we’ve been calling participatory\nintentions—are instances of a familiar sort of individual\nintention that figures in the planning and the coordination of\none’s activities over time. When these individual intentions\nconcern something that is done by more than one person, taking the\nform I intend that we J, they accord with Bratman’s\nversion of the Intention Thesis, and the core of his proposals about\nshared intention and action. But Bratman imposes further conditions,\nand these serve to relate these participatory intentions in\ndistinctive ways. \nOne important condition concerns the meshing of sub-plans (Bratman\n1992, 331ff). On Bratman’s view, an intention is distinctive in\nhow it leads to planning about necessary means and facilitative steps\nthat lead to its satisfaction. Now, suppose each of us has the\nintention to paint the house together (or, as Bratman would have it,\nthe intention that we paint the house), but my plan is to paint it\ngreen all over, whereas yours is to paint it purple all over. It seems\nthat we don’t share the intention to paint the house. So Bratman\nintroduces the condition that each participant intends that the\nsubplans that follow upon the participatory intentions of each\nindividual mesh—that is, are mutually satisfiable and\ncoherent—in order for the individuals to count as sharing an\n intention.[16] \nWe wouldn’t exhibit the right sort of cooperative attitude for\nshared activity and intention if the mesh of our sub-plans were\naccidental and we were not at all disposed to make them\nconsistent if they were to become incompatible. That’s why\nBratman requires the intention to mesh\n subplans.[17]\n There is, moreover, a normative element to the meshing, as emphasized\nby Roth 2003. Participants are subject to some sort of rational\n requirement[18]\n such that they in a sense ought to mesh their plans: the\nplans of the other participants serve as a normative constraint on\none’s own plans. And there is no reason to restrict this status\nto the plans, and not extend it to the intentions that generate them.\nThus, shared activity exhibits what Roth calls practical\nintersubjectivity. In effect, each participant treats the\nother’s intentions and plans much in the way that he or she\ntreats her own: as rational constraints on further intention and\nplanning. \nBratman (especially in his 2014 book, but see also his 2009c, 2009b,\n1992) defends a reductive account of this normative\nrequirement, explaining this interpersonal normative constraint in\nterms of the norms of commitment governing individual intention, such\nas those of consistency and means-end coherence. Your intentions and\nplans pertaining to our J-ing have an authority for me because of what\nmight be called a bridge intention to mesh my J-related plans and\nintentions with yours. Bratman expresses the bridge intention in terms\nof the condition requiring each participant to have the intention to\nact in accordance with and because of the others’ intentions and\nplans (as well as his or her own). Bratman’s idea is that, given my\nbridge intention, the norms of consistency and coherence governing my\nindividual intentions will be recruited to require that I form my\nplans and intentions with an eye toward consistency and coherence with\nyour plans and intentions. Roth 2003 sympathizes with these\ninterpersonal normative requirements of consistency and coherence as a\ncondition for shared intention and action, but resists the reductive\nbridge intention account of it. \nThe demand that subplans must mesh might inspire the view that\nsuper-ordinate intentions, or the reasons each participant in shared\nactivity A has for taking part, might also be subject to a similar\nrequirement. This is suggested, for example, in Korsgaard’s talk\nof the sharing of reasons: \nIn a similar vein, Tuomela requires that the “we-mode” intention\nat the core of his more recent theory necessarily involves group\nreasons shared by all participants. See his 2007; 13, 47, 98. \nBut it seems possible that individuals might engage in shared activity\n(and have the corresponding intention) even when they have different\nand incompatible reasons for doing so. For example, representatives\nfrom rival parties might engage in the legislative process that leads\nto the passage of laws, even when each is motivated by considerations\nthat the other finds\n unacceptable.[19]\n Still, it is plausible to think that there must be some constraints\non the sort of individual motive or reason a participant has to engage\nin shared activity. If my motive for engaging in shared activity is\noverly manipulative or undermining of fellow participants (e.g. doing\nsomething with A in order better to control him/her), the status of\nthe activity or intention as shared might be\n compromised.[20] \nA further way in which participatory intentions of different\nindividuals are related stems from how they might be formed, modified,\nor set aside. For example, Gilbert holds that shared activity gets\nstarted only when each individual openly expresses a readiness to be\njointly committed in a certain way with\n others.[21]\n She adds that rescinding or significantly modifying the resulting\nintention, as well as releasing any individual from participation,\nwould also require concurrence on everyone’s part. It’s\nnot clear that Gilbert herself would want to talk of this\n“concurrence condition” in terms of relating intention or\nintention-like attitudes in different participants. But, given that\nwhether I concur with how you propose to modify your intentions will\ndepend in part on my intentions, it is natural to take Gilbert’s\nconditions as imposing dynamic constraints on how the participatory\nintentions of different individual are related to one another. Of\ncourse, Gilbert’s conditions might be too strong. For example,\nthe concurrence criterion does not permit one to withdraw unilaterally\nfrom shared\n activity.[22]\n Some may find this implausible. But relaxing Gilbert’s\nconditions would naturally result in another perhaps weaker set of\ndynamic constraints, and not in their complete absence. For example,\nrecall that intentions are defeasible: they can be revised or dropped\nif changing circumstances warrant it. Now, we might imagine that each\nparticipant in shared activity might have the authority unilaterally\nto revise or defeat the intention in light of those changing\ncircumstances, whereupon other participants would have to abide by the\nchange unless, of course, they think that some mistake has been made\n(Roth 2004). \nMost of the views canvassed here emphasize as a condition for shared\nactivity fairly robust forms of integration between participants.\nBefore continuing in this vein, it bears mention that the focus on the\nparticipants and how they are related might lead us to neglect other\nimportant conditions for shared activity. Epstein 2015 argues that the\nmetaphysical grounds for some forms of shared activity, such as that\ninvolved in some cases of group action, involve a variety of\nconditions that are not themselves relations between members of the\ngroup, but often can determine how those members are related. These\nmight include historical conditions that determine the structure and\nmembership criteria for the group. Or, the grounds might include\nexternal conditions such as the actions of some designated individual\n(such as a sergeant at arms) not a part of the collective body but who\nfor example must convene a meeting in order that the members of the\nbody may collectively take some action.  \nSo shared activity is distinguished from a mere aggregation of\nindividual acts by a structure of appropriately related participatory\nintentions across different individuals. It is a structure that has a\ndistinctive normative significance for those individuals, with an\nimpact most immediately on each individual’s intention-based\npractical\n reasoning.[23] \nIt is natural to think that this structure of intentions is brought\nabout by individuals involved in shared activity, presumably when each\nforms the participatory intention that is his or her contribution to\nthe structure. But recall that participatory intentions are meant to\ncapture the sense in which each individual is committed to what\neveryone is doing together, and not merely to what he or she is doing.\nThus, Searle says of an instance of shared activity that\n“I’m pushing only as a part of our pushing.” This\nsuggests that what is intended is the entirety of the\nactivity, something reflected in Bratman’s intentions of the\nform I intend that we\n J.[24] \nBut as Velleman has shown, given the standard understanding of\nintentions, it’s not clear that one can intend the entire\nactivity; or if one can, it would seem incompatible with the activity\nbeing\n shared.[25]\n Intending is something I do to settle a deliberative issue: weighing\nseveral options, I decide on A-ing, and thereby intend to A. This\nsuggests the Settling\n Condition[26]\n that I can only intend what I take to be up to me to decide or\nsettle. It is a violation of a rational requirement to intend\nsomething I don’t think I can settle, and thus regard my ensuing\nplans and actions as likely coming to grief. Applying the point to\ncollective action, to say that I intend for us to be dining together\npresumes that whether we’re dining together is something for\nme to settle. But the idea behind shared activity\nand intention is precisely that it’s not entirely up to\nme what we do. You have a say in the matter; at the very least what\nyou do should be up to you (see also Schmid 2008). Our\nproblem, then, is that shared activity would seem both to demand and\nto disallow one and the same intention on the part of each\n participant.[27] \nSeveral responses have emerged to this problem. Velleman develops a\nsolution that invokes interdependent conditional\n intentions.[28]\n Each individual conditionally settles what the group will do, where\nthe condition is that each of the others has a similar commitment and\nintends likewise. Thus, I intend to J, on condition that you\nintend likewise. Some have worried that when intentions are\ninterdependent in this way it’s not entirely clear that they\nsettle anything at all, and hence, whether anyone is appropriately\ncommitted to our J-ing. If each intention is conditioned on\nthe other, it’s just as reasonable to refrain from acting as it\nis to engage in it. For discussion, see Roth 2004, 373–80;\nBacharach 2006, 137ff. Gilbert 2002, while addressing Robins 2002 and\na precursor of Roth 2004 disavows the interdependent conditional view\nattributed to her by Velleman, Roth, and Robins. See also Gilbert\n2003, 2009. Velleman himself is sensitive to something like this worry\n(1997a, 39) and it shapes how he formulates the content of the\nconditional\n intention.[29] \nBratman (1997) has suggested that what an individual intends can\nextend beyond what he can settle himself, so long as he can reasonably\npredict that the relevant other parties will act appropriately.\nFlagrantly disregarding sound medical advice, I can have the\ncategorical intention to work on my tan at the beach this afternoon,\nso long as I can reasonably predict that it’ll be sunny.\nLikewise, when I reasonably believe that you have or will have the\nappropriate intentions, I can then intend that we J. One might wonder\nwhether taking this sort of predictive attitude with respect to the\nintentions and actions of fellow participants is consistent with\nsharing an intention and acting with them. On the other hand,\nit’s not obvious that the prediction of an action entails that\nit is or must be regarded as involuntary or otherwise problematic. If\nso, the predictive attitude toward others very well may be compatible\nwith acting with them, and might account for how our\nJ-ing might be the object of my\n intention.[30] \nAnother suggestion is that a participant intends not the entirety of\nthe activity, but only his or her part in it. Such an intention is\nmore modest in that it does not purport to settle what other people\ndo. An account of shared activity in terms of such intentions (e.g.\nTuomela & Miller 1998, Kutz 2000) does not entail the authority or\ncontrol over others that would be difficult to reconcile with the\nactivity being shared. But this modest intention involves a commitment\nonly to one’s part in our J-ing and doesn’t seem to\naccount for a participatory commitment to our J-ing as a whole. To see\nwhy not, consider the case of walking together from Gilbert 1990. We\nmight describe my part as walking at a certain pace. But intending to\ndo that is entirely compatible with undermining my partner’s\ncontribution, for example by tripping him. Suppose instead that we\navail ourselves of some robust conception of part, so that\neach participant intends to do his part in shared activity, as\nsuch. This would appear to rule out attempts to undermine a\npartner’s contribution. But what exactly is this intention? It\nseems to presuppose an understanding of the concept of shared\nactivity, which is the notion we’re trying to\n elucidate.[31] \nMaybe this criticism is too quick. Perhaps there remains a way to\ncharacterize the intention to do one’s part that doesn’t\npresuppose the notion of shared activity. One approach appeals to\n“team reasoning”, a distinctive form of strategic\npractical reasoning. This view of reasoning was developed to address\ncertain difficulties standard game theory has in accounting for the\nrationality of selecting more cooperative options in strategic\nscenarios such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and Hi-Lo. The idea is\nthat we get intuitively more rational outcomes with individuals each\napproaching the situation asking him- or herself not what’s\nbest for me given what others do?, but what\nis best for us or the group as a\n whole?[32]\n The participatory intention is characterized in terms of the\ndistinctive reasoning that leads to its formation, rather than in\nterms of some more intrinsic feature of the intention or its content.\nIt remains to be seen whether intending one’s part, so\nunderstood, can account for the participatory commitment distinctive\nof shared\n activity.[33] \nThe issue of how to establish the interpersonal structure of\nparticipatory intention is a central problem for the theory of shared\nagency, and remains an area of active research interest. For further\nviews, see Gilbert 2009 (some discussion of which is below),\nKorsgaard’s interpretation of Kant in her 2009, 189ff, and Roth\n2004, whose conception of intentions allows him to appeal to an\ninterpersonal mechanism similar in some respects to that of\ncommands. \nGilbert has long held that participants in shared activity are\nobligated to do their part in it. Take her well-known example of\nwalking together, starring Jack and Sue. When Jack does something\nthat’s not compatible with walking together, e.g. walking so\nfast that Sue cannot keep up, Sue is entitled to rebuke Jack.\nThis suggests to Gilbert that it is essential to shared activity (and\nintention) that each participant has an obligation to do his or her\npart in the activity (or in carrying out the intention). For\nexample, \nGilbert has used this mutual obligation criterion to criticize\nreductive accounts of shared activity in terms of “personal\nintentions” (1990, 180ff; 2008,499), such as that defended by\nBratman. Bratman 1997 acknowledges that mutual obligations are\ntypically associated with the sharing of intentions, but insists that\nthey are not essential. He argues that when present, the obligations\nare explained in terms of a moral principle that one should live up to\nthe expectations about one’s actions that one has intentionally\ncreated in others. This principle, articulated by Scanlon in the\ncontext of a discussion about promising, does generally apply to\nsituations where individuals act together and share intentions.\n(Scanlon’s Principle F is in his 1998, 304. For recent discussion of\nScanlon and promising that bears on shared activity, see Shiffrin\n2008. For another reductivist response to Gilbert see MacMahon 2005,\n299ff. For more recent discussion of mutual obligation, see Roth 2004,\nAlonso 2009.) \nSuppose, however, that we have individuals engaged in an endeavor they\nknow to be immoral, such as that of a pillager and a lazy plunderer\nraiding a village. The inadmissibility of the action undermines the\npillager’s entitlement to hold the plunderer accountable for\nslacking off in his search for loot. There could not be an obligation\nto do one’s part in this activity (Bratman, 1999,\n132–6). For Bratman, this shows that there can be shared\nactivity without these obligations. Gilbert responds that it only\nshows that the obligations in question are special, “of a\ndifferent kind” (2009, 178) than the sort of obligation familiar\nfrom discussion of moral philosophy. She goes so far as to say that\nthe obligations to do one’s part are present, even when\none’s partners in shared activity have coerced one into joining\nthem. \nGilbert’s later statements become more explicit about the\ndirected nature of these non-moral obligations (Gilbert 1997,\n75–6). The obligation relates Jack with Sue in a way in which\nJack and a non-participant are not related (Gilbert 2009; 2008, 497;\nthis connects with recent discussion of “bipolar normativity”; see\nDarwall 2006, Thompson 2004, and Wallace 2013). To mark the\ndirected nature of the normative relation, and in a way that does not\nsuggest as strongly that they are moral in nature, we might speak of\ncontralateral commitments (Roth 2004). Thus, Jack has a\ncontralateral commitment-to-Sue to walk in a way that is compatible\nwith their walking together. \nGilbert attempts to articulate the sense of directedness in terms of\nownership: Jack’s contralateral commitment to Sue to\nwalk at the appropriate pace entails that Sue is owed, and in a sense\nowns, the relevant performance on Jack’s part (Gilbert 2008,\n497). This would presumably explain why Sue and not anyone else can\nrelease Jack from fulfilling the obligation/commitment, by giving up\nher claim on Jack’s action. One might, in a related vein, try to\narticulate the directed nature of the commitment in terms of\n promising.[35]\n If we understand Jack’s obligation as the result of something\nlike a promise to Sue, we can see not only that Jack has a commitment,\nbut that Sue is in a special position such that she can, for example,\nrelease him from fulfilling it. One drawback, at least for Gilbert, of\nappealing either to ownership or promising to articulate the notion of\ndirected obligation or contralateral commitment is that it is not\nclear that this would allow for these commitments to be as insulated\nfrom moral considerations as Gilbert seems to think they are (e.g. in\nthe response to Bratman above). A further question is whether\nownership or promising fully captures all that there is to the\ncontralateral or directed nature of the commitment. These strategies\nmight explain why Sue is in a special position to release\nJack from his commitment. But one might wonder whether there are other\naspects of her special standing with respect to Jack that are left\n unaddressed.[36]\n Furthermore, it might be that certain aspects of promising - in\nparticular the directedness of the obligation - might in some way\ndepend on shared agency or aspects thereof. See Gilbert 2011 and Roth\n2016. \nWhile the notion of ownership or claim rights is meant to be\nsuggestive of the sort of mutual obligations/contralateral commitments\nshe has in mind, the central explanatory concept deployed by Gilbert\nis that of joint commitment, which she takes to be\n primitive.[37]\n A concern here is whether joint commitment provides anything like a\nphilosophical account or explanation of mutual obligations, or whether\nit merely re-describes them. We get some idea of what Gilbert has in\nmind by contrasting it with personal commitment associated with\nindividual intention or decision (2009, 180). Whereas one can on\none’s own take on and rescind the sort of commitment associated\nwith individual intention and decision, joint commitment can only be\nformed through a process whereby everyone expresses their readiness,\nand it can only be rescinded when all parties concur. This raises the\nissue of the previous section, of how exactly the joint commitment\ncomes into force. Even if everyone expresses a readiness to A\ntogether, it doesn’t follow that we all take the plunge and\nactually undertake it. A further worry Gilbert herself has voiced is\nwhether any condition requiring expression might limit the\napplicability of her view in giving a more general account of\npolitical obligation, something she aims to do (e.g., in her 2006).\nGilbert’s view has also been charged with circularity; it would seem\nthat the expression of readiness needed to establish joint commitment\nwould itself be an instance of shared activity and thus presuppose\njoint commitment. For discussion, see Tuomela 1992, Tollefsen 2002,\nand Schmid 2014. \nUnderstood as a kind of obligation, Gilbert’s insight about a\ndistinctive normative relation holding between participants in shared\nagency risks rejection. Many find obligation, and especially the\nno-unilateral withdrawal condition, to be too strong. Gilbert’s\ngeneral idea might find wider acceptance if we talk instead of\ncommitment that allows for unilateral\n withdrawal.[38]\n Finally, Stroud (2010) has suggested a normative condition in some\nrespects even weaker. Stroud holds that participants in shared\nactivity have a prerogative—a moral permission—that can\noverride or mitigate moral obligations had to non-participants (such\nas that of beneficence). It remains to be seen to what extent this\nmight address the intuitions that motivated Gilbert’s original\nand important insight. \nIt was suggested earlier (in Section 1) that thinking of a group as\nitself an agent and a subject of intentional states was not a good\nmodel or account of central forms of shared intention and activity.\nBut that’s not to say that it’s never appropriate to talk\nthis way. Indeed, Rovane, Pettit and others have argued that some\ngroups can be genuine subjects of intentional attitudes, and can have\nminds of their own. This would amount to a different way in which\nindividuals can act together, and raises interesting questions about\nhow a group’s intentions must be related to an individual’s in\npractical reasoning. \nPettit starts with the assumption that a rational integration of a\ncollective is a sign of its mentality (2003, 181). He says,  \nThe group mind hypothesis thus seems to explain or account for the\nrationality exhibited by the group, both in what it does and what it\nrepresents. This explanatory role, if indispensable, would give us a\nreason for admitting into our ontology groups with genuine minds of\ntheir own. The point might be put in traditional Quinean terms: if a\nregimentation in first order logic of our best empirical theory\nquantifies over such groups, then such groups exist. But this sort of\nexplanatory commitment needn’t be quite as explicitly\nquantificational as Quine would have it, and Pettit himself never\nmentions Quine. The ontological commitment might be more implied in\nthe content of our theory than a matter of logical form. \nAnother question to raise, if only to set aside on this occasion, is\nwhether the only sort of indispensability that can support the group\nmind hypothesis is of the theoretical/explanatory sort. One might, for\nexample, consider whether the Rovane/Pettit line of thought could be\nrun with the assumption that the indispensability of such groups is\npractical in nature, perhaps a condition for a sort of agency that\nindividuals can and do exercise (Roth 2014a, 140–141; Pettit\n2015, 1642). \nBut is the group mind hypothesis explanatorily indispensable? If the\nrational behavior, representation, speech, etc. can easily be\nexplained (or explained away) without invoking group minds, then the\npresumption of mindedness is defeated. Thus, if we discover of what\nappears to be a subject that its behavior was entirely controlled by\nor explicable in terms of the attitudes and behavior of some other (or\nothers), then one would no longer have reason to think the subject in\nquestion as minded. For example, if the rational behavior of a group\nis explained wholly in terms of the individual members, then we are\nnot tempted to think that the group itself is genuinely minded\n(Watkins 1957). Or, if there is a very tight fit between judgments and\nattitudes of the group on the one hand, and members on the other\n– for example if ascriptions of attitudes to a group just is a\nsummary of ascriptions to its individual members (Quinton\n1975–6) – then there is no reason to think of the group as\nhaving a mind of its own. \nPettit’s recent arguments address this worry. He has suggested\nthat some group decision procedures are such that past group judgments\nrationally constrain subsequent decisions, judgments, and intentions.\nWhen such “premise-driven” procedures are followed, a\ngroup not only displays a rational unity indicative of mindedness, but\ndoes so in such a way that it might arrive at a judgment that a\nminority—perhaps even none—of the individual members\npersonally hold. \nPettit draws on the literature on judgment aggregation (E.g.\nKornhauser and Sager, 1986; List & Pettit, 2002). Here’s a\nversion of the sort of case Pettit has in mind: several colleagues (A,\nB, and C) heading to the APA convention in Chicago have to decide\nwhether to take the El (train) from the airport. An affirmative\njudgment regarding each of the following considerations or\n“premises” is necessary for the decision/conclusion to get\non board: whether the train is safe enough, whether it’s quick\nenough, and whether it’s scenic enough (e.g. whether it’s\nokay that they’ll miss out on a view of the lake). Let us also\nsuppose, given appropriate background assumptions, that the\nsatisfaction of these conditions amounts to a conclusive reason to\ntake the train. Finally, suppose the group arrives at judgments\nregarding the premises by majority vote as follows:  \nIf the group decides on the conclusion by a majority vote on what each\nindividual personally thinks s/he ought to do, it will decide against\ntaking the train (this is the “no” in the upper triangle\nof the lower right box). But this conclusion would be hard to square\nwith the group judgments concerning the three premises of the\nargument. Whereas, if the group adopts the premise driven procedure,\nwhere the conclusion is determined not by a vote but by group’s\nviews regarding the premises, then the group’s conclusion is\nrational (this is the “yes” in the lower triangle of the\nlower right box). \nSuch a conclusion, however, is not obviously explicable in terms of\nthe personal conclusions of the members, each of whom concludes the\nopposite. Thus, suppose (as Pettit does) that there are groups that do\nin fact adopt the premise-driven procedure. Then, the rationality of\nthe group’s conclusion suggests that the group has a mind.\nMoreover, the discontinuity between individual and group level\nattitudes concerning the conclusion is such that the presumption of\nmindedness is not defeated. This suggests to Pettit that, at least in\nsome cases, groups can have minds of their own, and be genuine\nintentional subjects. \nOne worry with this argument concerns how the premise-driven decision\nprocedure is implemented. If it’s simply implemented by virtue\nof the intentions of each individual to establish and maintain\nrationality at the group level, then there appears to be an\nalternative to the group mind hypothesis. That the group appears to\nhave a mind of its own in examples such as this would then be an\nartifact of the restricted focus of the example, which said nothing\nabout how a policy of rationality at the collective level is\nmaintained. Once we broaden our perspective to recognize that each\nindividual aims to maintain rationality at the collective level,\nit’s no longer clear that there is such a gap or discontinuity\nbetween the intentionality at the level of the individuals and of the\ngroup. Thus, there would be no warrant for talk of group\n minds.[39]\n Of course, this criticism makes strong assumptions about how to\nexplain any rationality that might be exhibited at the group level,\nassumptions that are open to challenge. \nFor some, taking seriously the idea that a group has a mind of its own\ninvolves more than an empiricist commitment to the explanation of\nphenomena. That is, a group mind is not merely a convenient posit\nadopted from within the third person perspective of the intentional\nstance for the purposes of explanation and prediction (Dennett 1987).\nA mind has a point of view, and if sufficiently sophisticated, is a\nsubject of commitment and obligation. In developing ideas of Searle\nand Tuomela in a new direction, Schmid (2014) argues that such a group\nmind would require a distinctive form of plural self-awareness on the\npart of each of the members of the group. He suggests that such groups\ndo exist, and explores ways in which plural self-awareness is and is\nnot analogous to the self-awareness each of us as individuals exhibit.\n","contact.mail":"roth.263@osu.edu","contact.domain":"osu.edu"}]
