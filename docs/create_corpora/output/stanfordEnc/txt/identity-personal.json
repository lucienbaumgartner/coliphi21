Olson","author1.info":"http://www.shef.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/profiles/eolson.html","entry":"identity-personal","body.text":"\n\n\nPersonal identity deals with philosophical questions that arise about\nourselves by virtue of our being people (or, as lawyers and\nphilosophers like to say, persons). This contrasts with\nquestions about ourselves that arise by virtue of our being living\nthings, conscious beings, material objects, or the like. Many of these\nquestions occur to nearly all of us now and again: What am I? When did\nI begin? What will happen to me when I die? Others are more abstruse.\nThey have been discussed since the origins of Western philosophy, and\nmost major figures have had something to say about them. (There is\nalso a rich literature on the topic in Eastern philosophy, which won't\nbe discussed; see, e.g., Jinpa 2002, and the entry\n mind in Indian Buddhist philosophy.)\n \n\nThe topic is sometimes discussed under the protean term self.\n‘Self’ is sometimes synonymous with ‘person’,\nbut often means something different: a sort of unchanging, immaterial\nsubject of consciousness, for instance (as in the phrase ‘the\nmyth of the self’). The term is often used without any clear\nmeaning and shall be avoided here.\n\n\nAfter surveying the main questions of personal identity, the entry\nwill focus on the one that has received most attention in recent\ndecades, namely our persistence through time.\n\nThere is no single problem of personal identity, but rather a wide\nrange of questions that are at best loosely connected. Discussions in\nthis area do not always make clear which one is at stake. Here are the\nmost familiar: \nWho am I? Outside of philosophy, ‘personal\nidentity’ usually refers to properties to which we feel a\nspecial sense of attachment or ownership. Someone’s personal\nidentity in this sense consists of those properties she takes to\n“define her as a person” or “make her the person she\nis”, and which distinguish her from others. (The precise meaning\nof these phrases is hard to pin down.) To have an “identity\ncrisis” is to become unsure of what one’s most\ncharacteristic properties are—of what sort of person, in some\ndeep and fundamental sense, one is. This “personal\nidentity” contrasts with ethnic or national identity, which\nconsists roughly of the ethnic group or nation one takes oneself to\nbelong to and the importance one attaches to this. \nOne’s personal identity in this sense is contingent and\ntemporary: the way I define myself as a person might have been\ndifferent, and can vary from one time to another. It could happen that\nbeing a philosopher and a parent belong to my identity, but not being\na man and living in Yorkshire, while someone else has the same four\nproperties but feels differently towards them, so that being a man and\nliving in Yorkshire belong to his identity but not being a philosopher\nor a parent. And these attitudes are all subject to change. \nDepending on how the term is defined, it may also be possible for a\nproperty to belong to someone’s “identity” without\nher actually having it: if I become convinced that I am Napoleon,\nbeing an emperor could be one of the properties central to the way I\ndefine myself, and thus an element of my identity, even though my\nbelief is false.  \nThe Who am I? question—sometimes called the characterization\nquestion (Schechtman 1996: 1)—is what determines\nsomeone’s personal identity in this sense (Glover 1988: part 2,\nLudwig 1997). \nPersonhood. What is it to be a person, as opposed to\na nonperson? What have we people got that nonpeople haven’t got?\nMore specifically, we can ask at what point in our development from a\nfertilized egg there comes to be a person, or what it would take for a\nchimpanzee or a Martian or an electronic computer to be a person, if\nthey could ever be. An ideal account of personhood would be a\ndefinition of the word person, taking the form\n‘Necessarily, x is a person at time t if and\nonly if … x … t …’, with\nthe blanks appropriately filled in. The most common answer is that to\nbe a person at a time is to have certain special mental properties\nthen (e.g. Baker 2000: ch. 3). Others propose a less direct connection\nbetween personhood and mental properties: for example that to be a\nperson is be capable of acquiring those properties (Chisholm 1976:\n136f.), or to belong to a kind whose members typically have them when\nhealthy and mature (Wiggins 1980: ch. 6). \nPersistence. What does it take for a person to\npersist from one time to another—to continue existing rather\nthan cease to exist? What sorts of adventures is it possible, in the\nbroadest sense of the word ‘possible’, for you to survive,\nand what sort of event would necessarily bring your existence to an\nend? What determines which past or future being is you? Suppose you\npoint to a child in an old class photograph and say,\n“That’s me.” What makes you that one, rather than\none of the others? What is it about the way she relates then to you as\nyou are now that makes her you? For that matter, what makes it the\ncase that anyone at all who existed back then is you? This is\nsometimes called the question of personal identity over time.\nThat’s because it’s about whether the earlier being and\nthe later being are one or two—that is, whether they are\nnumerically identical. An answer to it is an account of our\npersistence conditions. \nHistorically this question often arises out of the hope (or fear) that\nwe might continue to exist after we die (as in Plato’s\nPhaedo). Whether this could happen depends on whether\nbiological death necessarily brings one’s existence to an end.\nImagine that after your death there really will be someone, in this\nworld or the next, who resembles you in certain ways. How would that\nbeing have to relate to you as you are now in order to be\nyou, rather than someone else? What would the Higher Powers have to do\nto keep you in existence after your death? Or is there anything they\ncould do? The answer to these questions depends on the answer to the\npersistence question. \nEvidence. How do we find out who is who? What\nevidence bears on the question of whether the person here now is the\none who was here yesterday? One source of evidence is first-person\nmemory: if you remember doing some particular action (or seem to), and\nsomeone really did do it, this supports the claim that that person is\nyou. Another source is physical continuity: if the person who did it\nlooks just like you, or even better if she is in some sense physically\nor spatio-temporally continuous with you, that too is reason to think\nshe is you. Which of these sources is more fundamental? Does\nfirst-person memory count as evidence all by itself, for instance, or\nonly insofar as we can check it against publicly available physical\nfacts? What should we do when they support opposing verdicts? Suppose\nCharlie’s memories are erased and replaced with accurate\nmemories (or apparent memories) of the life of someone long\ndead—Guy Fawkes, say (Williams 1956–7). Ought we to\nconclude, on the basis of memory evidence, that the resulting person\nis not Charlie but Guy Fawkes brought back to life, or should we\ninstead infer on the basis of physical continuity that he is simply\nCharlie with different memories? What principle would answer this\nquestion? \nThe evidence question dominated the anglophone literature on personal\nidentity from the 1950s to the 1970s (good examples include Shoemaker\n1963, 1970 and Penelhum 1967, 1970). It is important to distinguish it\nfrom the persistence question. What it takes for you to persist\nthrough time is one thing; how we ought to evaluate the relevant\nevidence is another. If the criminal had fingerprints just like yours,\nthe courts may conclude that he is you. But even if they are right to\ndo so, having your fingerprints is not what it is for a past\nor future being to be you: it is neither necessary (you could survive\nwithout any fingers at all) nor sufficient (someone else could have\nfingerprints just like yours). \nPopulation. If the persistence question is about\nwhich of the characters introduced at the beginning of a story have\nsurvived to become those at the end of it, we may also ask how many\nare on the stage at any one time. What determines how many of us there\nare now? If there are some seven billion people on the earth at\npresent, what facts—biological, psychological, or what have\nyou—make that the right number? The question is not what\ncauses there to be a certain number of people at a given\ntime, but what there being that number consists in. It’s like\nasking what sort of configuration of pieces amounts to winning a game\nof chess, rather than what sorts of moves typically lead to\nwinning. \nYou may think the number of people at any given time (or at least the\nnumber of human people) is simply the number of human\norganisms there are then (ignoring any that don’t count as\npeople). But this is disputed. Some say that cutting the main\nconnections between the cerebral hemispheres results in radical\ndisunity of consciousness, and that because of this, two people share\na single organism (see e.g. Nagel 1971; Puccetti 1973 argues that\nthere are two people within each normal human being; see also van\nInwagen 1990: 188–212). Others say that a human being with\nmultiple personality could literally be the home of two or more\nthinking beings (Wilkes 1988: 127f., Rovane 1998: 169ff.; see also\nOlson 2003b, Snowdon 2014: ch. 7). Still others argue that two people\ncan share an organism in cases of conjoined twinning (Campbell and\nMcMahan 2010; see also Olson 2014). \nThis is sometimes called the problem of “synchronic\nidentity”, as opposed to the “diachronic identity”\nof the persistence question. These terms need careful handling,\nhowever. They are apt to give the mistaken impression that identity\ncomes in two kinds, synchronic and diachronic. The truth is simply\nthat there are two kinds of situations where we can ask how many\npeople (or other things) there are: those involving just one moment\nand those involving several. \nWhat am I? What sort of things, metaphysically\nspeaking, are you and I and other human people? What are our\nfundamental properties, in addition to those that make us people?\nWhat, for instance, are we made of? Are we composed entirely of\nmatter, as stones are, or are we partly or wholly immaterial? Where do\nour spatial boundaries lie, if we are spatially extended at all? Do we\nextend all the way out to our skin and no further, for instance? If\nso, what fixes those boundaries? Are we\nsubstances—metaphysically independent beings—or is each of\nus a state or aspect or activity of something else? \nHere are some of the main proposed answers (Olson 2007): \nThere is no consensus or even a dominant view on this question. \nWhat matters in identity? What is the practical\nimportance of facts about our persistence? Why does it\nmatter? What reason have you to care whether you yourself\ncontinue to exist, rather than someone else just like you existing in\nyour place? Imagine that surgeons are going to put your brain into my\nhead and that neither of us has any choice about this. Suppose the\nresulting person will be in terrible pain after the operation unless\none of us pays a large sum in advance. If we were both entirely\nselfish, which of us would have a reason to pay? Will the resulting\nperson—who will presumably think he is you—be responsible\nfor your actions or for mine? (Or both, or neither?) \nThe answer may seem to turn entirely on whether the resulting person\nwould be you or I. Only I can be responsible for my\nactions. The fact that some person is me, by itself, gives me a reason\nto care about him. Each person has a special, selfish interest in her\nown future and no one else’s. Identity itself matters\npractically. But some say that I could have an entirely selfish reason\nto care about someone else’s future for his own sake. Perhaps\nwhat gives me a reason to care about what happens to the man people\nwill call by my name tomorrow is not that he is me, but that\nhe is then psychologically continuous with me as I am now (see Section\n4), or because he relates to me in some other way that does not imply\nthat we are the same person. If someone other than me were\npsychologically continuous tomorrow with me as I am now, he would have\nwhat matters to me and I ought to transfer my selfish concern to him.\nLikewise, someone else could be responsible for my actions, and not\nfor his own. Identity itself has no practical importance. (See\nShoemaker 1970: 284; Parfit 1971, 1984: 215, 1995; Sosa 1990, Martin\n1998.) \nThat completes our survey. Though some of these questions may bear on\nothers, they are to a large extent independent. It’s important\nnot to confuse them. \nWe turn now to the persistence question. Few concepts have been the\nsource of more misunderstanding than identity over time. The\nPersistence Question is often confused with other questions or stated\nin a tendentious way. \nThe question is roughly what is necessary and sufficient for a past or\nfuture being to be someone existing now. Suppose we point to you now,\ndescribe someone or something existing at another time, and ask\nwhether we are referring twice to one thing or once to each of two\nthings. The persistence question asks what determines the answer to\nsuch queries. (There are precisely analogous questions about the\npersistence of other objects, such as dogs.) \nSome take the persistence question to ask what it means to\nsay that a past or future being is you. This would imply that we can\nanswer it by working out the meaning of terms such as\n‘person’, or by analysing the concepts they express. The\nanswer would be knowable a priori if at all. It would also imply that\nnecessarily all people have the same persistence conditions—that\nthe answer to the question is the same no matter what sort of people\nwe considered. Though some endorse these claims (Noonan 2003:\n86–92), they are disputed. What it takes for us to persist might\ndepend on whether we are biological organisms, which we cannot know a\npriori. And if there could be immaterial people, such as gods or\nangels, what it takes for them to persist might differ from what it\ntakes for a human person to persist. \nWe sometimes ask what it takes for someone to remain the same\nperson. The idea is that if you were to alter in certain\nways—if you lost much of your memory, say, or became badly\ndisabled, or had a dramatic change in character—you would no\nlonger be the person you were before. This is not the persistence\nquestion. The two questions can have different answers. Suppose you\nchange in such a way as to “become a different person”:\nthe answer to the question of whether you are the same person is No.\nThe persistence question asks, in this case, whether you would still\nexist. And the answer to that question is Yes: if you are a\ndifferent person, then you still exist, just as you do if you remain\nthe same person.  \nWhen we speak of remaining the same person or of becoming a different\none, we mean remaining or ceasing to be a certain sort of\nperson. For someone no longer to be the same person is for her still\nto exist, but to have changed in some important way. This has to do\nwith her individual identity in the sense of the characterization\nquestion—with what sorts of changes would count as losing the\nproperties that define someone as a person. It has nothing to do with\npersistence. Asking what it takes for someone to “retain her\npersonal identity”, or to lose it, also appears to be about\ncharacterization rather than persistence. \nThe persistence question is often taken to ask what it takes for the\nsame person to exist at two different times. The most common\nformulation is something like this: \nThis asks, in effect, what it takes for a past or future person to be\nyou. We have a person existing at one time and a person existing at\nanother, and the question is what is necessary and sufficient for them\nto be one person rather than two. \nThis is narrower than the persistence question. We may want to know\nwhether each of us was ever an embryo or a foetus, or whether someone\ncould survive in an irreversible vegetative state (where the resulting\nbeing is biologically alive but has no mental properties). These are\nclearly questions about what it takes for us to persist. But being a\nperson is most often defined as having special mental properties.\nLocke, for instance, said that a person is “a thinking\nintelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider\nitself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and\nplaces” (1975: 335). This implies that something is a person at\na given time only if it has those mental properties then. It follows\nthat early-term foetuses and human beings in a vegetative state,\nhaving no mental properties at all, are not people at those times. In\nthat case we cannot infer anything about whether you were once an\nembryo or could come to be a vegetable from a principle about what it\ntakes for a past or future person to be you. \nWe can illustrate the point by considering this answer to question\n1: \nThat is, a past or future person is you just if you (who are now a\nperson) can now remember an experience she had then, or she can then\nremember an experience you are having now. Call this the memory\ncriterion. (It too is sometimes attributed to Locke, though\nit’s doubtful whether he actually held it: see Behan 1979.) \nThe memory criterion may seem to imply that if you were to lapse into\nan irreversible vegetative state, you would cease to exist (or perhaps\npass to the next world): the resulting being could not be you because\nit would not remember anything. But no such conclusion follows.\nAssuming that a human vegetable is not a person, this is not a case\ninvolving a person existing at one time and a person existing at\nanother time. The memory criterion purports to tell us which past or\nfuture person you are, but not which past or future being\ngenerally. It says what it takes for someone to persist as a\nperson, but not what it takes for someone to persist without\nqualification. So it implies nothing about whether you could come to\nbe a vegetable or even a corpse, or whether you were ever an embryo.\nAs stated, the memory criterion is compatible with your surviving with\nno memory continuity at all, as long as this happens when you are not\na person (Olson 1997: 22–26, Mackie 1999: 224–228).  \nNo one who thinks that we persist by virtue of memory continuity would\naccept this. The memory criterion is intended to imply that if a\nperson x exists now and a being y exists at another\ntime--whether or not it is is a person then--they are one just if\nx can now remember an experience y has at the other time\nor vice versa. But this not an answer to Question 1: what it takes for\na person existing at one time and a person existing at another time to\nbe one rather than two. It is an answer to a more general question:\nwhat it takes for something that is a person at one time to exist at\nanother time as well, whether as a person or not: \nThose who state the persistence question as Question 1 generally do so\nbecause they assume that every person is a person essentially:\nnothing that is in fact a person could possibly exist without being a\nperson. (By contrast, no student is a student essentially: something\nthat is in fact a student can exist without being a student.) This\nclaim, “person essentialism”, implies that whatever is a\nperson at one time must be a person at every time when she exists. It\nmakes Questions 1 and 2 equivalent. \nBut person essentialism is controversial. Combined with a Lockean\naccount of personhood, it implies that you could never have been an\nembryo: at best you may have come into being when the embryo that gave\nrise to you developed certain mental capacities. Nor could you come to\nbe a human vegetable. For that matter, it rules out our being\nbiological organisms, since no organism is a person essentially: every\nhuman organism starts out as an embryo and may end up in a vegetative\nstate. It rules out both animalism and the brute-physical view\ndescribed in the next section. \nWhether we were once embryos or could become vegetables, or whether we\nare people essentially, are substantive questions that an account of\nour persistence should answer, not matters to be unwittingly settled\nin advance by the way we frame the debate. Question 1 is tendentious,\nby presupposing that we can only survive as people. Question 2 is\nneutral. \nFour main sorts of answers to the persistence question have been\nproposed. The most popular are psychological-continuity\nviews. They say that our persistence consists in some\npsychological relation. You are that future being that in some sense\ninherits its mental features from you—beliefs, memories,\npreferences, the capacity for rational thought, and so on—and\nyou are that past being whose mental features you have inherited in\nthis way. There is dispute over what sort of inheritance this has to\nbe—whether it must be underpinned by some kind of physical\ncontinuity, for instance, and whether it requires a\n“non-branching” restriction. There is also disagreement\nabout what mental features need to be inherited. (We will return to\nsome of these points.) But most philosophers writing on personal\nidentity since the early 20th century have endorsed some version of\nthis view. The memory criterion mentioned earlier is an example.\nAdvocates of psychological-continuity views include Garrett (1998),\nHudson (2001, 2007), Johnston (1987, 2016), Lewis (1976), Nagel (1986:\n40), Noonan (2003), Parfit (1971; 1984: 207; 2012), Perry (1972),\nShoemaker (1970; 1984: 90; 1997; 1999, 2008, 2011), and Unger (1990:\nch. 5; 2000).  \nA second answer is that our persistence consists in some sort of brute\nphysical relation. You are that past or future being that has your\nbody, or that is the same biological organism as you are, or the like.\nIt has nothing to do with psychological facts. Call these\nbrute-physical views. (Don’t confuse them with the view\nthat physical evidence has some sort of priority over psychological\nevidence in finding out who is who. That has to do with the evidence\nquestion.) Their advocates include Ayers (1990: 278–292), Carter\n(1989), Mackie (1999), Olson (1997), van Inwagen (1990:\n142–188), and Williams (1956–7, 1970). \nSome try to combine these views, saying that we need both mental and\nphysical continuity to survive, or that either would suffice without\nthe other (Nozick 1981: ch. 1, Langford 2014). \nA different sort of proposal, narrativism, is that what it\ntakes for us to persist has to do with the stories we tell about\nourselves. We understand our lives in terms of narratives about the\nmomentous events in our past and their influence on our later\ndecisions and character. These narratives can be\n“identity-constituting”. The thought is not just that they\nbear on our “personal identity” in the sense of the\ncharacterization question—what sort of people we are in some\nfundamental sense. They literally determine when we begin and end.\nRoughly speaking, a past being is you just if you now have narratives\nof the right sort identifying you with her as she was then. A future\nbeing is you just if the narratives she has then identify her with you\nas you are now. Remembering a past event may be necessary for it to\nfigure in an identity-constituting narrative, but it’s not\nsufficient, distinguishing narrativist from psychological-continuity\nviews. Narrativists about persistence include Schechtman (1996: esp.\nch. 5, 2001) and Schroer and Schroer (2014); critics include Strawson\n(2008) and Olson and Witt (2019). DeGrazia 2005: ch. 3 is a helpful\noverview.  \nAll these views agree that there is something that it takes for us to\npersist—that there are informative, nontrivial necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a person existing at one time to exist at\nanother time. A fourth view, anticriterialism, denies this.\nPsychological and physical continuity are evidence for persistence, it\nsays, but do not always guarantee it and may not be required. The\nclearest advocate of this view is Merricks (1998; see also Swinburne\n1984, Lowe 1996: 41ff., 2012; Langford 2017; for criticism see\nZimmerman 1998, Shoemaker 2012). There are anticriterialist views\nabout things other than people as well. And there is debate about how\nanticriterialism should be understood (Olson 2012, Noonan 2011,\n2019). \nMost people—most Western philosophy teachers and students,\nanyway—feel immediately drawn to psychological-continuity views\n(Nichols and Bruno 2010 give experimental evidence for this). If your\nbrain were transplanted, and that organ carried with it your memories\nand other mental features, the resulting person would be convinced\nthat he or she was you. This can make it easy to suppose that the\nperson would be you, and that this would be so because she\nwas psychologically continuous with you. It is difficult, however, to\nget from this thought to an attractive answer to the persistence\nquestion. \nWhat psychological relation might our persistence consist in? We have\nalready mentioned memory: a past or future being might be you if and\nonly if you can now remember an experience she had then, or vice\nversa. This proposal faces two objections, dating to Sergeant and\nBerkeley in the 18th century (see Behan 1979), but more famously\ndiscussed by Reid and Butler (see the snippets in Perry 1975). \nFirst, suppose a young student is fined for overdue library books.\nLater, as a middle-aged lawyer, she remembers paying the fine. Later\nstill, in her dotage, she remembers her law career, but has entirely\nforgotten not only paying the fine but all the other events of her\nyouth. According to the memory criterion the young student is the\nmiddle-aged lawyer, the lawyer is the elderly woman, but the elderly\nwoman is not the young student. This is an impossible result: if\nx and y are one and y and z are\none, x and z cannot be two. Identity is\ntransitive; memory continuity is not. \nSecond, it seems to belong to the very idea of remembering that you\ncan remember only your own experiences. To remember paying a fine (or\nthe experience of it) is to remember yourself paying. That\nmakes it trivial and uninformative to say that you are the person\nwhose experiences you can remember—that memory continuity is\nsufficient for us to persist. It’s uninformative because you\ncannot know whether someone genuinely remembers a past experience\nwithout already knowing whether she is the one who had it. Suppose we\nwant to know whether Blott, who exists now, is the same as Clott, whom\nwe know to have existed at some time in the past. The memory criterion\ntells us that Blott is Clott just if Blott can now remember an\nexperience Clott had at that past time. But Blott’s seeming to\nremember one of Clott’s experiences counts as genuine memory\nonly if Blott actually is Clott. So we should already have to know\nwhether Blott is Clott before we could apply the principle that is\nsupposed to tell us whether she is. (There is, however, nothing\ntrivial or uninformative about the claim that memory connections are\nnecessary for us to persist. We can know that the corpse\nresulting from my death cannot remember any events from my life\nwithout knowing already whether it’s me.) \nOne response to the first problem (about transitivity) is to modify\nthe memory criterion by switching from direct to indirect memory\nconnections: the old woman is the young student because she can recall\nexperiences the lawyer had at a time when the lawyer remembered the\nstudent’s life. The second problem is commonly met by replacing\nmemory with a new concept, “retrocognition” or\n“quasi-memory”, which is just like memory but without the\nidentity requirement: even if it’s self-contradictory to say\nthat you remember doing something you didn’t do but someone else\ndid, you could still “quasi-remember” it (Penelhum 1970:\n85ff., Shoemaker 1970; for criticism see McDowell 1997).  \nNeither move gets us far, however, as both the original and the\nmodified memory criteria face a more obvious problem: there are many\ntimes in our pasts that we cannot remember or quasi-remember at all,\nand to which we are not linked even indirectly by an overlapping chain\nof memories. There is no time when you could recall anything that\nhappened to you while you dreamlessly slept last night. The memory\ncriterion has the absurd implication that you have never existed at\nany time when you were unconscious. The person sleeping in your bed\nlast night must have been someone else. \nA better solution replaces memory with the more general notion of\ncausal dependence (Shoemaker 1984, 89ff.). We can define two notions,\npsychological connectedness and psychological continuity. A being is\npsychologically connected, at some future time, with you as you\nare now just if she is in the psychological states she is in then in\nlarge part because of the psychological states you are in now\n(and this causal link is of the right sort: see Shoemaker 1979).\nHaving a current memory (or quasi-memory) of an earlier experience is\none sort of psychological connection—the experience causes the\nmemory of it—but there are others. The important point is that\nour current mental states can be caused in part by mental states we\nwere in at times when we were unconscious. For example, most of your\ncurrent beliefs are the same ones you had while you slept last night:\nthey have caused themselves to continue existing. We can then say that\nyou are psychologically continuous, now, with a past or future\nbeing just if some of your current mental states relate to those he or\nshe is in then by a chain of psychological connections. \nNow suppose that a person x who exists at one time is the\nsame thing as something y existing at another time if and\nonly if x is, at the one time, psychologically continuous\nwith y as it is at the other time. This avoids the most\nobvious objections to the memory criterion. \nIt still leaves important questions unanswered, however. Suppose we\ncould somehow copy all the mental contents of your brain to mine, much\nas we can copy the contents of one computer drive to another, and that\nthis erased the previous contents of both brains. Whether this would\nbe a case of psychological continuity depends on what sort of causal\ndependence counts. The resulting being (with my brain and your mental\ncontents) would be mentally as you were before, and not as I was. He\nwould have inherited your mental properties in a way—but a funny\none. Is it the right way? Could you literally move from one organism\nto another by “brain-state transfer”?\nPsychological-continuity theorists disagree (Shoemaker (1984:\n108–111, 1997) says yes; Unger (1990: 67–71) says no; see\nalso van Inwagen 1997). (Schechtman 2001 gives a different sort of\nobjection to the psychological-continuity strategy.) \nA more serious worry for psychological-continuity views is that you\ncould be psychologically continuous with two past or future people at\nonce. If your cerebrum—the upper part of the brain largely\nresponsible for mental features—were transplanted, the recipient\nwould be psychologically continuous with you by anyone’s lights\n(even if there would also be important psychological differences). Any\npsychological-continuity view will imply that she would be you. If we\ndestroyed one of your cerebral hemispheres, the resulting being would\nalso be psychologically continuous with you.\n(Hemispherectomy—even the removal of the left hemisphere, which\ncontrols speech—is considered a drastic but acceptable treatment\nfor otherwise-inoperable brain tumors: see Rigterink 1980.) What if we\ndid both at once, destroying one hemisphere and transplanting the\nother? Then too, the one who got the transplanted hemisphere would be\npsychologically continuous with you, and would be you according to the\npsychological-continuity view. \nBut now suppose that both hemispheres are transplanted, each into a\ndifferent empty head. (We needn’t pretend that the hemispheres\nare exactly alike.) The two recipients—call them Lefty and\nRighty—will each be psychologically continuous with you. The\npsychological-continuity view as we have stated it implies that any\nfuture being who is psychologically continuous with you must be you.\nIt follows that you are Lefty and also that you are Righty. But that\ncannot be: if you and Lefty are one and you and Righty are one, Lefty\nand Righty cannot be two. And yet they are: there are indisputably two\npeople after the operation. One thing cannot be numerically identical\nwith two things that are distinct from each other. Suppose Lefty is\nhungry at a time when Righty isn’t. If you are Lefty, you are\nhungry at that time. If you are Righty, you aren’t. If you are\nLefty and Righty, you are both hungry and not hungry at once: a\nstraight contradiction. \nPsychological-continuity theorists have proposed two different\nsolutions to this problem. One, sometimes called the\n“multiple-occupancy view”, says that if there is fission\nin your future, then there are two of you, so to speak, even now. What\nwe think of as you is really two people, who are now exactly similar\nand located in the same place, doing the same things and thinking the\nsame thoughts. The surgeons merely separate them (Lewis 1976, Noonan\n2003: 139–42; Perry 1972 offers a more complex variant). \nThe multiple-occupancy view is usually combined with the general\nmetaphysical claim that people and other persisting things are\ncomposed of temporal parts (often called\n“four-dimensionalism”; see Heller 1990: ch. 1, Hudson\n2001, Sider 2001a, Olson 2007: ch. 5). For each person, there is such\na thing as her first half: an entity just like the person only\nbriefer, like the first half of a meeting. On this account, the\nmultiple-occupancy view is that Lefty and Righty coincide before the\noperation by sharing their pre-operative temporal parts or\n“stages”, and diverge later by having different temporal\nparts located afterwards. They are like two roads that coincide for a\nstretch and then fork, sharing some of their spatial parts but not\nothers. At the places where the roads overlap, they are just like one\nroad. Likewise, the idea goes, at the times before the operation when\nLefty and Righty share their temporal parts, they are just like one\nperson. Even they themselves can’t tell that they are two.\nWhether we really are composed of temporal parts, however, is\ndisputed. (Its consequences are explored further in section 8.) \nThe other solution to the fission problem abandons the intuitive claim\nthat psychological continuity by itself suffices for us to persist. It\nsays, rather, that a past or future being is you only if she is then\npsychologically continuous with you and no other being is.\n(There is no circularity in this. We need not know the answer to the\npersistence question in order to know how many people there are at any\none time; that comes under the population question.) This means that\nneither Lefty nor Righty is you. They both come into existence when\nyour cerebrum is divided. If both your cerebral hemispheres are\ntransplanted, you cease to exist—though you would survive if\nonly one were transplanted and the other destroyed. Fission is death.\n(Shoemaker 1984: 85, Parfit 1984: 207; 2012: 6f., Unger 1990: 265,\nGarrett 1998: ch. 4).  \nThis proposal, the “non-branching view”, has the\nsurprising consequence that if your brain is divided, you will survive\nif only one half is preserved, but you will die if both halves are.\nThat looks like the opposite of what we should expect: if your\nsurvival depends on the functioning of your brain (because that is\nwhat underlies psychological continuity), then the more of that organ\nwe preserve, the greater ought to be your chance of surviving. In fact\nthe non-branching view implies that you would perish if one of your\nhemispheres were transplanted and the other left in place: you can\nsurvive hemispherectomy only if the hemisphere to be removed is first\ndestroyed. This seems mysterious. Why should an event that would\nnormally preserve your existence bring it to an end if accompanied by\na second such event—one having no causal effect on the first? If\nyour brain is to be divided, why do we need to destroy half of it in\norder to save you? (For discussion, see Noonan 2003: 12–15 and\nch. 7.)  \nThe problem is especially acute if brain-state transfer counts as\npsychological continuity. In that case, even copying your total brain\nstate to another brain without doing you any physical or psychological\nharm would kill you. (“Best-candidate” theories such as\nNozick 1981: ch. 1 attempt to avoid this.) \nThe non-branching view makes the What matters? question especially\nacute. Faced with the prospect of having one of your hemispheres\ntransplanted, there is no evident reason to prefer having the other\ndestroyed. Most of us would rather have both preserved, even if they\ngo into different heads. Yet on the non-branching view that is to\nprefer death over continued existence. This leads Parfit and others to\nsay that that is precisely what we ought to prefer. We have no\nreason to want to continue existing, at least for its own sake. What\nyou have reason to want is that there be someone in the future who is\npsychologically continuous with you, whether or not she actually is\nyou.  \nThe usual way to achieve this is to continue existing yourself, but\nthe fission story shows that this is not necessary. Likewise, even the\nmost selfish person has a reason to care about the welfare of the\nbeings who would result from her undergoing fission, even if, as the\nnon-branching view implies, neither would be her. In the fission case,\nthe sorts of practical concerns you ordinarily have for yourself apply\nto someone other than you. This suggests more generally that facts\nabout who is who have no practical importance. All that matters\npractically is who is psychologically continuous with whom. (Lewis\n1976 and Parfit 1976 debate whether the multiple-occupancy view can\npreserve the conviction that identity is what matters\npractically.) \nAnother objection to psychological-continuity views is that they rule\nout our being biological organisms (Carter 1989, Ayers 1990:\n278–292, Snowdon 1990, Olson 1997: 80f., 100–109, 2003a).\nThis is because no sort of psychological continuity appears to be\neither necessary or sufficient for a human organism to persist. Human\norganisms have brute-physical persistence conditions. If your brain\nwere transplanted, the one who ended up with that organ would be\nuniquely psychologically continuous with you (and this continuity\nwould be continuously physically realized). On any\npsychological-continuity view, she would be you: the person would go\nwith her transplanted brain. But no organism would go with its\ntransplanted brain. The operation would simply move an organ from one\norganism to another. So it seems, anyway. It follows that if you were\nan organism, you would stay behind with an empty head. Even though\nthis is never going to happen, it shows that according to\npsychological-continuity views we have a property that no organism\nhas, namely possibly moving from one organism to another by brain\ntransplant.  \nAgain, a human organism could continue existing in an irreversible\nvegetative state with no psychological continuity. If you were an\norganism, you could too. But according to psychological-continuity\nviews you could not. It follows that human animals have a property\nthat we lack, namely possibly surviving as a vegetable.  \nThis does not merely rule out our being essentially or\n“fundamentally” organisms, but our being organisms at all:\nnothing that is even contingently an organism would go with its\ntransplanted brain, or would cease to exist just by lapsing into an\nirreversible vegetative state. \nBut a healthy, adult human organism seems a paradigm case of a\nthinking being. If human organisms can think, yet (as\npsychological-continuity views imply) we are not organisms, three\ndifficulties arise. First, you are one of two intelligent\nbeings sitting there and reading this entry. More generally, there are\ntwo thinking beings wherever we thought there was just one.  \nSecond, the organism would not merely think in some way or other, but\nwould presumably be psychologically indistinguishable from you. That\nwould make it a person, if being a person amounts to having certain\nmental or behavioral properties (as on Locke’s\ndefinition)—a second person in addition to you. In that case it\ncannot be true that all people (or even all human people) persist by\nvirtue of psychological continuity. Some—those that are\norganisms—would have brute-physical persistence conditions. \nThird, it becomes hard to see how you could know whether you\nwere a nonanimal person with psychological persistence conditions or\nan animal person with brute-physical ones. If you thought you were the\nnonanimal, the organism would use the same reasoning to conclude that\nit was too. For all you could ever know, it seems, you might\nbe the one making this mistake. \nWe can make this epistemic problem more vivid by imagining a\nthree-dimensional duplicating machine. When you step into the\n“in” box, it reads off your complete physical (and mental)\ncondition and uses this information to assemble a perfect duplicate of\nyou in the “out” box. The process causes temporary\nunconsciousness but is otherwise harmless. Two beings wake up, one in\neach box. The boxes are indistinguishable. Because each being will\nhave the same apparent memories and perceive identical surroundings,\neach will think, for the same reasons, that he or she is you. But only\none will be right. If this happened to you, it’s hard to see how\nyou could know, afterwards, whether you were the original or the\nduplicate. (Suppose the technicians who work the machine are sworn to\nsecrecy and immune to bribes.) You would think, “Who am I? Did I\ndo the things I seem to remember doing? Or did I come into being only\na moment ago, complete with false memories of someone else’s\nlife?” And you would have no way of answering these questions.\nIn the same way, psychological-continuity views raise the questions,\n“What am I? Am I a nonanimal that would go with its transplanted\nbrain, or an animal that would stay behind with an empty head?”\nAnd here too there seem to be no grounds on which to answer them. \nThese three objections have been called the\n“too-many-thinkers” or “thinking-animal”\nproblem. \nThe most popular defense of the psychological-continuity view against\nthis objection is to say that, despite sharing our brains and showing\nall the outward signs of consciousness and intelligence, human\norganisms do not think and are not conscious. Thinking animals are not\na problem for psychological-continuity views for the simple reason\nthat there are none (Shoemaker 1984: 92–97, Lowe 1996: 1,\nJohnston 2007: 55; Baker 2000 is a subtle variant). If human organisms\ncannot be conscious, it would seem to follow that no biological\norganism of any sort could have any mental properties at all.\nShoemaker argues that this follows from the functionalist theory of\nmind (1999, 2008, 2011). This threatens to imply that human organisms\nare “zombies” in the philosophical sense: beings\nphysically identical to conscious beings, with the same behavior, but\nlacking consciousness (Olson 2018) \nAnother option is to concede that human organisms are psychologically\nindistinguishable from us, but try to explain how we can still know\nthat we are not those organisms. The best-known proposal of this sort\nfocuses on personhood and first-person reference. It says that not\njust any being with mental properties of the sort that you and I\nhave—rationality and self-consciousness, for\ninstance—counts as a person. A person must also persist by\nvirtue of psychological continuity. It follows that human animals are\nnot people (thus solving the second problem, about personhood). \nFurther, personal pronouns such as ‘I’, and the thoughts\nthey express, refer only to people. So when your animal body says or\nthinks ‘I’, it refers not to itself but to you, the\nperson. The organism’s statement ‘I am a person’\ndoes not express the false belief that it is a person, but the\ntrue belief that you are. So the organism is not mistaken about which\nthing it is: it has no first-person beliefs about itself at all. And\nyou are not mistaken either. You can infer that you are a person from\nthe linguistic facts that you are whatever you refer to when you say\n‘I’, and that ‘I’ never refers to anything but\na person. You can know that you are not the animal thinking your\nthoughts because it is not a person and personal pronouns never refer\nto nonpeople (thus solving the third, epistemic problem). (See Noonan\n1998, 2010, Olson 2002; for a different approach based on epistemic\nprinciples see Brueckner and Buford 2009.) \nOr one could say that human organisms have psychological persistence\nconditions. Despite appearances, the transplant operation would not\nmove your brain from one organism to another, but would cut an\norganism down to the size of a brain, move it across the room, and\nthen give it new parts to replace the ones it lost—presumably\ndestroying the animal into which the brain is implanted. (This may be\nthe view of Wiggins (1980: 160, 180) and McDowell (1997: 237), and is\nunequivocally endorsed by Madden (2016); see also Langford 2014, Olson\n2015: 102–106.) \nNone of these objections arise on animalism, the view that we are\norganisms. This does not imply that all organisms, or even all human\norganisms, are people: as we saw earlier, human embryos and animals in\na persistent vegetative state may not count as people. Being a person\nmay be only a temporary property of you, like being a student. Nor\ndoes animalism imply that all people are organisms. It is consistent\nwith the existence of wholly inorganic people: gods or angels or\nconscious robots. It does not say that being an animal is part of what\nit is to be a person (a view defended in Wiggins 1980: 171 and\nWollheim 1984: ch. 1 and criticized in Snowdon 1996). Animalism leaves\nthe answer to the personhood question entirely open. (It is\nconsistent, for instance, with Locke’s definition quoted in\nsection 2.) \nAssuming that organisms persist by virtue of some sort of\nbrute-physical continuity, animalism implies a version of the\nbrute-physical view. Some endorse a brute-physical view without saying\nthat we are animals. They say that we are our bodies (Thomson 1997),\nor that our identity through time consists in the identity of our\nbodies (Ayer 1936: 194). This has been called the bodily criterion of\npersonal identity. It is obscure, and its relation to animalism is\nuncertain. \nMost versions of the brute-physical view imply that human people have\nthe same persistence conditions as certain nonpeople, such as dogs.\nAnd it implies that our persistence conditions differ from those of\nimmaterial people, if they are possible. It follows that there are no\npersistence conditions for people as such. (Baker (2000: 124) objects\nstrenuously to this.) \nThe most common objection to brute-physical views is the repugnance of\ntheir implication that you would stay behind if your brain were\ntransplanted (e.g. Unger 2000; for an important related objection see\nJohnston 2007, 2016). In other words, brute-physical views are\nunattractive in just the way that psychological-continuity views are\nattractive.  \nAnimalists generally concede the force of this, but take it to be\noutweighed by other considerations. First, animalism avoids the\ntoo-many-thinkers problem. Second, it is compatible with our beliefs\nabout who is who in real life. Every actual case in which we take\nsomeone to survive or perish is a case where a human organism does so.\nPsychological-continuity views, by contrast, conflict with the\nappearance that each of us was once a foetus. When we see an\nultrasound picture of a 12-week-old foetus, we ordinarily think we are\nseeing something that will, if all goes well, be born, learn to speak,\nand eventually become an adult human person. Yet none of us is in any\nway psychologically continuous with a 12-week-old foetus. \nAnd the “transplant argument” may be less compelling than\nit appears (Snowdon 2014: 234). Suppose you had a tumor that would\nkill you unless your brain were replaced with a healthy donated organ.\nThis would have grave side-effects: it would destroy your memories,\nplans, preferences, and other mental properties. It may not be clear\nwhether you could survive such a thing. But it’s not obvious\nthat you could not survive it either. Maybe the operation could save\nyour life, though at great cost. We cannot confidently rule this out\neven if the new brain gave you memories, plans, and preferences from\nthe donor. But if it’s not obvious that the brain recipient\nwould not be you, then it’s not obvious that it would be the\ndonor. A brain transplant might be metaphysically analogous to a liver\ntransplant. The claim is not that this is obviously true, but just\nthat it’s not obviously false. And in that case it’s not obvious\nthat a person must go with her transplanted brain. \nThe debate between psychological-continuity and brute-physical views\ncannot be settled without considering more general matters outside of\npersonal identity. For instance, psychological-continuity theorists\nneed to explain why human organisms are unable to think as we do. This\nwill require an account of the nature of mental properties. Or if\nhuman organisms can think, they must explain how we can know\nthat we are not those organisms. This will turn on how the reference\nof personal pronouns and proper names works, or on the nature of\nknowledge. \nSome general metaphysical views suggest that there is no unique right\nanswer to the persistence question. The best-known example is the\nontology of temporal parts mentioned in section 5. It says that for\nevery period of time when you exist, short or long, there is a\ntemporal part of you that exists only then. This gives us many likely\ncandidates for being you—that is, many different beings now\nsitting there and reading this. Suppose you are a material thing, and\nthat we know what determines your spatial boundaries. That should tell\nus what counts as your current temporal part or\n“stage”—the temporal part of you located now and at\nno other time. But that stage is a part of a vast number of temporally\nextended objects (Hudson 2001: ch. 4).  \nFor instance, it is a part of a being whose temporal boundaries are\ndetermined by relations of psychological continuity (Section 4) among\nits stages. That is, one of the beings thinking your current thoughts\nis an aggregate of person-stages, each of which is psychologically\ncontinuous with each of the others and with no other stage. If this is\nwhat you are, then you persist by virtue of psychological continuity.\nYour current stage is also a part of a being whose temporal boundaries\nare determined by relations of psychological connectedness.\nThat is, one of the beings now thinking your thoughts is an aggregate\nof person-stages, each of which is psychologically connected with each\nof the others and to no other stage. This may not be the same as the\nfirst being, as some stages may be psychologically continuous with\nyour current stage but not psychologically connected with it. If this\nis what you are, then psychological connectedness is necessary and\nsufficient for you to persist (Lewis 1976). What’s more, your\ncurrent stage is a part of a human organism, which persists by virtue\nof brute-physical continuity, and a part of many bizarre and\ngerrymandered objects, such as “contacti persons” (Hirsch\n1982, ch. 10). Some even say that you are your current stage itself\n(Sider 2001a, 188–208). And there would be many other\ncandidates. \nThe temporal-parts ontology implies that each of us shares our current\nthoughts with countless beings that diverge from one another in the\npast or future. If this were true, which of these things should\nwe be? Of course, we are the things we refer to when we say\n‘I’, or more generally the referents of our personal\npronouns and proper names. But these words would be unlikely to\nsucceed in referring to just one sort of thing—to only one of\nthe many candidates on each occasion of utterance. There would\nprobably be some indeterminacy of reference, so that each such\nutterance referred ambiguously to many different candidates. That\nwould make it indeterminate what things, and even what sort of things,\nwe are. And insofar as the candidates have different histories and\ndifferent persistence conditions, it would be indeterminate when we\ncame into being and what it takes for us to persist (Sider 2001b).","contact.mail":"e.olson@shef.ac.uk","contact.domain":"shef.ac.uk"}]
