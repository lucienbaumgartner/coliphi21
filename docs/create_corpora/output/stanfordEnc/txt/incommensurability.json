The idea has its origins in Ancient Greek mathematics,\nwhere it meant no common measure between magnitudes. For example,\nthere is no common measure between the lengths of the side and the\ndiagonal of a square. Today, such incommensurable relations are\nrepresented by irrational numbers. The metaphorical application of\nthis mathematical notion specifically to the relation between\nsuccessive scientific theories became controversial in 1962 after it\nwas popularised by two influential philosophers of science: Thomas\nKuhn and Paul Feyerabend. They appeared to be challenging the\nrationality of natural science and were often considered to be among\n“the worst enemies of science” (Theocharis and Psimopoulos\n1987, 596; cf. Preston et al. 2000). Since 1962, the\nincommensurability of scientific theories has been a widely discussed,\ncontroversial idea that was instrumental in the historical turn in the\nphilosophy of science and the establishment of the sociology of\nscience as a professional discipline.\n\nIn the influential The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962), Kuhn made the dramatic claim that history of science reveals\nproponents of competing paradigms failing to make complete contact\nwith each other’s views, so that they are always talking at\nleast slightly at cross-purposes. Kuhn characterized the collective\nreasons for these limits to communication as the incommensurability of\npre- and post-revolutionary scientific traditions, claiming that the\nNewtonian paradigm is incommensurable with its Cartesian and\nAristotelian predecessors in the history of physics, just as\nLavoisier’s paradigm is incommensurable with that of\nPriestley’s in chemistry (Kuhn 1962, 147–150; cf.\nCaamaño 2009 and Hoyningen-Huene 2008). These competing\nparadigms lack a common measure because they use different concepts\nand methods to address different problems, limiting communication\nacross the revolutionary divide. Kuhn initially used\nincommensurability predominately to challenge cumulative\ncharacterizations of scientific advance, according to which scientific\nprogress is an improving approximation to the truth, and to challenge\nthe idea that there are unchanging, neutral methodological standards\nfor comparing theories throughout the development of the natural\nsciences. Like in evolution, the process does not change\ntoward some fixed goal according to some fixed rules, methods\nor standards, but rather it changes away from the pressures\nexerted by anomalies on the reigning theory (Kuhn 1962,\n170–173). The process of scientific change is eliminative and\npermissive rather than instructive. In the process of confronting\nanomalies, certain alternatives are excluded, but nature does not\nguide us to some uniquely correct theory. \nKuhn developed and refined his initial idea over the following\ndecades, repeatedly emphasizing that incommensurability neither means\nnor implies incomparability; nor does it make science irrational (e.g.\nKuhn 2000 [1970], 155ff.). He focused increasingly on conceptual\nincompatibility as manifest in the structural differences used to\nclassify the kinds whose relations are stated in laws and theories,\nsuch as chemical elements and biological species (Kuhn 2000, see\nespecially chs. 3, 4, 5, 10 & 11). He used incommensurability to\nattack the idea, prominent among logical positivists and logical\nempiricists, that comparing theories requires translating their\nconsequences into a neutral observation language (cf. Hoyningen-Huene\n1993, 213–214). In the late 1990s, he explicated\nincommensurability in terms of ineffability, emphasizing that\nit became possible for scientists to make and understand certain new\nstatements only after a particular theory had been introduced\n(in the older vocabulary the new sentences are nonsensical), just as\nit only becomes possible for historians to understand certain older\nstatements by setting aside current conceptions that otherwise cause\ndistortions (Kuhn 2000 [1989], 58–59; 2000 [1993], 244). Such\n‘taxonomic incommensurability’ results in\ntranslation failure between local subsets of inter-defined terms due\nto the cross-classification of objects into mutually exclusive\ntaxonomies. This can be distinguished from ‘methodological\nincommensurability’, according to which there is no common\nmeasure between successive scientific theories, in the sense that\ntheory comparison is sometimes a matter of weighing historically\ndeveloping values, not following fixed, definitive rules (Sankey and\nHoyningen-Huene 2001, vii-xv). This makes room for rational\ndisagreement in theory comparison, as scientists may apply different\nvalues (such as scope, simplicity, fruitfulness, accuracy) in\nevaluating and comparing particular theories, so that theory choice is\nnot unequivocally determined throughout the scientific community. \nPaul Feyerabend first used the term incommensurable in 1962 in\n“Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism” to describe the\nlack of logical relations between the concepts of fundamental theories\nin his critique of logical empiricists models of explanation and\nreduction. He argued that in the course of scientific advance, when\nfundamental theories change, meanings change, which can result in a\nnew conception of the nature of reality. By calling two fundamental\ntheories incommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they were conceptually\nincompatible: The main concepts of one could neither be defined on the\nbasis of the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor related to\nthem via a correct empirical statement (Feyerabend 1962, 74, 90). For\nexample, Feyerabend claimed that the concepts of temperature and\nentropy in kinetic theory are incommensurable with those of\nphenomenological thermodynamics (1962, 78); whereas the Newtonian\nconcepts of mass, length and time are incommensurable with those of\nrelativistic mechanics (1962, 80). Feyerabend repeatedly used the idea\nof incommensurability to challenge a wide range of forms of conceptual\nconservativism, arguing that they unjustifiably favor successful,\nentrenched concepts over potential improvements, and overlook the\npossibility of developing incommensurable alternatives (Oberheim 2005,\n2006). \nThe entry is organized around the 1962 popularisations of the concept\nof incommensurability by Kuhn and Feyerabend and the basic ideas that\ninfluenced their developments of this concept. First, Kuhn’s\nnotion of incommensurability as it was initially developed is\ncharacterized, as is its cause and its purported consequences. That is\nfollowed by an examination of Kuhn’s route to the idea, and then\nhis subsequent development after 1962. The sections on\nFeyerabend’s notion of incommensurability mirror the same basic\nstructure. They are followed by a brief comparison of Kuhn and\nFeyerabend’s views on incommensurability, especially its\nrelation to theory comparison. \nKuhn’s notion of incommensurability in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions misleadingly appeared to imply that\nscience was somehow irrational, and consequently it faced many\nchallenges and caused many confusions. This led to many\nclarifications, and eventually to a substantial redevelopment of a\nmore precise and restricted version of it over the following decades.\nKuhn initially used the term holistically to capture methodological,\nobservational and conceptual disparities between successive scientific\nparadigms that he had encountered in his historical investigations\ninto the development of the natural sciences (Kuhn 1962,\n148–150). Later, he refined the idea arguing that\nincommensurability is due to differences in the taxonomic structures\nof successive scientific theories and neighbouring contemporaneous\nsub-disciplines. Kuhn’s developing notion of incommensurability\nhas received much attention, and it continues to provoke plenty of\ncontroversy (cf. Bird 2007, Demir 2008, Moreno 2009, Psillos 2008, and\nSoler, Sankey and Hoyningen-Huene 2008). \nIn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), Thomas\nKuhn used the term ‘incommensurable’ to characterize the\nholistic nature of the changes that take place in a scientific\nrevolution. His investigations into the history of science revealed a\nphenomena often now called ‘Kuhn loss’: Problems whose\nsolution was vitally important to the older tradition may temporarily\ndisappear, become obsolete or even unscientific. On the other hand,\nproblems that had not even existed, or whose solution had been\nconsidered trivial, may gain extraordinary significance in the new\ntradition. Kuhn concluded that proponents of incommensurable theories\nhave different conceptions of their discipline and different views\nabout what counts as good science; and that these differences arise\nbecause of changes in the list of problems that a theory must resolve\nand a corresponding change in the standards for the admissibility of\nproposed solutions (cf. Stillwaggon Swan and Bruce 2011). So for\nexample, Newton’s theory was initially widely rejected because\nit did not explain the attractive forces between matter, something\nrequired of any mechanics from the perspective of the proponents of\nAristotle and Descartes’ theories (Kuhn 1962, 148). According to\nKuhn, with the acceptance of Newton’s theory, this question was\nbanished from science as illegitimate, only to re-emerge with the\nsolution offered by general relativity. He concluded that scientific\nrevolutions alter the very definition of science itself. \nChanges in problems and standards come with corresponding conceptual\nchanges, so that after a revolution, many (though not all) of the\nolder concepts are still used, but in a slightly modified way. Such\nconceptual changes have both intensional and extensional aspects,\nwhich is to say that the same terms take on different meanings and are\nused to refer to different things when used by proponents of competing\nincommensurable theories. The changes in the intensional aspects of\nconcepts result because the terms used to express a theory are\ninter-defined and their meanings depend on the theories to which they\nbelong. For example, the meanings of the terms\n‘temperature’, ‘mass’, ‘chemical\nelement’ and ‘chemical compound’ depend on which\ntheories are used to interpret them. Conceptual changes also result in\nthe exclusion of some old elements of the extension of a concept,\nwhile new elements come to be subsumed by it, so that the same term\ncomes to refer to different things. For example, the term\n‘Planet’ referred to the sun but not the earth in the\nPtolemaic theory, whereas it refers to the earth and not the sun in\nthe Copernican theory. Incommensurable theories use some of the same\nterms, but with different meanings, to refer to different sets of\nthings. Two scientists who perceive the same situation differently,\nbut nevertheless use the same vocabulary to describe it, speak from\nincommensurable viewpoints (Kuhn 1970, 201). \nOne of the most controversial claims to emerge from Kuhn’s\nassertions about the incommensurability of scientific theories is that\nthe proponents of different paradigms work in different worlds (Kuhn\n1962, 150; cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1990; 1993). Drawing on experiments in\nthe psychology of perception, Kuhn argued that the rigorous training\nrequired for admittance to a paradigm conditions scientist’s\nreactions, expectations and beliefs (Kuhn 1962, 128; 2000 [1989],\n66–71), so that learning how to apply the concepts of a theory\nto solve exemplary problems determines scientists’ experiences.\nSo for example, where a proponent of the Newtonian theory sees a\npendulum, an Aristotelian saw constrained free fall; where Priestley\nsaw dephlogisticated air, Lavoisier saw oxygen; where Berthollet saw a\ncompound that could vary in proportion, Proust saw only a physical\nmixture. Kuhn (and Feyerabend) used the analogy of a Gestalt switch to\nillustrate this point. In this way, one main source of the notion of\nincommensurability of scientific theories has been the development of\nGestalt psychology. \nAccording to Kuhn, these three interrelated aspects of\nincommensurability (changes in problems and standards that define a\ndiscipline, changes in the concepts used to state and solve those\nproblems, and world change) jointly constrain the interpretation of\nscientific advance as cumulative. Scientific progress, Kuhn argued, is\nnot simply the continual discovery of new facts duly explained.\nInstead, revolutions change what counts as the facts in the first\nplace. When reigning theories are replaced by incommensurable\nchallengers, the purported facts are re-described according to new and\nincompatible theoretical principles. The main goal of Kuhn’s\nStructure was to challenge the idea of scientific progress as\ncumulative, according to which what is corrected or discarded in the\ncourse of scientific advance is that which was never really scientific\nin the first place, and Kuhn used incommensurability as the basis of\nhis challenge. Instead of understanding scientific progress as a\nprocess of change toward some fixed truth, Kuhn compared his\nsuggestion to that of Darwin’s: scientific progress is like\nevolution in that its development should be understood without\nreference to a fixed, permanent goal (1962, 173). \nAccording to Kuhn, he discovered incommensurability as a graduate\nstudent in the mid to late 1940s while struggling with what appeared\nto be nonsensical passages in Aristotelian physics (Kuhn 2000 [1989],\n59–60). He could not believe that someone as extraordinary as\nAristotle could have written them. Eventually patterns in the\ndisconcerting passages began to emerge, and then all at once, the text\nmade sense to him: a Gestalt switch that resulted when he changed the\nmeanings of some of the central terms. He saw this process of meaning\nchanging as a method of historical recovery. He realized that in his\nearlier encounters, he had been projecting contemporary meanings back\ninto his historical sources (Whiggish history), and that he would need\nto peel them away in order to remove the distortion and understand the\nAristotelian system in its own right (hermeneutic history). For\ninstance, when he encountered the word “motion” in\nAristotle (the standard translation of the Greek kinesis), he\nwas thinking in terms of the change of position of objects in space\n(as we do today). But to get more closely at Aristotle’s\noriginal usage, he had to expand the meaning of motion to cover a much\nbroader range of phenomena that include various other sorts of change,\nsuch as growth and diminution, alternation, and generation and\ncorruption, making an objects motion in space (displacement or\n‘locomotion’) just a special case of motion. Kuhn realized\nthat these sorts of conceptual differences indicated breaks between\ndifferent modes of thought, and he suspected that such breaks must be\nsignificant both for the nature of knowledge, and for the sense in\nwhich the development of knowledge can be said to make progress.\nHaving made this discovery, Kuhn changed his career plans, leaving\ntheoretical physics to pursue this strange phenomenon. Some fifteen\nyears later the term ‘incommensurable’ first appears in\nhis classic The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962). \nOf all the sources influencing Kuhn on incommensurability, at least\none deserves special attention. In the foreword of The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn acknowledged a deep debt to\nLudwik Fleck, a bacteriologist who developed the first explicit\nsociology of natural science, and anticipated many contemporary views\nabout the social construction of knowledge. Around 1950, Kuhn was\nenticed by the potential relevance to his experience of\nincommensurability of Fleck’s paradoxical title: Entstehung\nund Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einführung in\ndie Lehre von Denkstil und Denkkollektiv (1935)(Genesis and\nDevelopment of a Scientific Fact, 1979). There and in other\nearlier works, Fleck had already used ‘inkommensurabel’ to\ndescribe different styles of thinking within the natural sciences as\nwell as to discuss the ramifications of radical conceptual change in\nthe history of science. For example, Fleck used the term\n‘inkommensurabel’ to describe the differences between\n‘medical thinking’ and ‘scientific thinking’.\nThe former addresses irregular, temporally dynamic phenomena such as\nan illness, while the later addresses uniform phenomena (Fleck 1986\n[1927], 44–45). Fleck also used the term\n‘inkommensurabel’ to describe conceptual replacements in\ntheoretical transitions within what he considered the most vital of\nthe natural sciences, the medical sciences. For example, he claimed\nthat an old concept of disease became incommensurable with a newer\nconcept that was not a completely adequate substitute for it (Fleck\n1979 [1935], 62). While Fleck’s program of comparative\nepistemology anticipates Kuhn’s ideas in many significant\nrespects, it is also strikingly different (Harwood 1986; Oberheim\n2005; Peine 2011). The most pervasive differences concerning\nincommensurability are that Fleck treats meaning and meaning change as\na function of how concepts are received and developed by the\ncollective, while for Kuhn it is individuals who develop and apply the\nconcepts that advance science. Moreover, for Fleck meaning change is a\ncontinuous feature of scientific development, whereas Kuhn\ndistinguishes normal scientific development that does not change\nmeanings from revolutionary developments that do. \nEven so, Fleck emphasized all three of the interrelated aspects of the\nshifts that Kuhn called revolutions and tried to capture by calling\ntheories ‘incommensurable’ (changes in problems and\nstandards (1979 [1935], 75–76; 1979 [1936], 89), conceptual\nchange (e.g. 1979 [1935]; 1979 [1936], 72, 83) and world change (e.g.\n1986 [1936], 112). Fleck argued that science does not approach the\ntruth because successive thought-styles raise new problems and discard\nolder forms of knowledge (Fleck 1986 [1936], 111–112; 1979\n[1935], 19, 51, 137–139; cf. Harwood 1986, 177). Fleck\nemphasized that scientific terms acquire their meanings through their\napplication within a particular theoretical context and that those\nmeanings change when theories change in the course of advance, even\noffering the example of ‘chemical elements’ and\n‘compounds’ repeated by Kuhn (Fleck 1979 [1935], 25, 39,\n40, 53–54). Fleck emphasized the theory-ladenness of observation\nwith explicit reference to Gestalt switches; stressing that a\n‘thought-style’ determines not only the meanings of the\nconcepts it uses, but also the perception of phenomena to be\nexplained, developing examples from the history of anatomical\nrepresentation (1979 [1935], 66; 1986 [1947]). Fleck (like Kuhn,\nFeyerabend and Wittgenstein) acknowledged Wolfgang Köhler’s\nwork in psychology of perception in this regard. Fleck concluded that\nscientific advance is not cumulative, that conceptual differences\nbetween members of different scientific communities cause\ncommunication difficulties between them (1979 [1936], 109), and later\nfor historians trying to understand older ideas (1979 [1936],\n83–85, 89). Fleck even emphasized that meaning change in the\ncourse of scientific advance causes translation failure between\ntheories, anticipating a central aspect of Kuhn’s later notion\nof taxonomic incommensurability (e.g. 1986 [1936], 83). \nAnother major source of Kuhn’s idea of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories is Gestalt psychology (Kuhn 1962, vi). Wolfgang\nKöhler, for example, had emphasized the active role of\norganization in perception and argued that in psychology one begins\nwith Gestalten (organized, segregated wholes such as the\nobjects of human perception or identifiable human behaviours) and then\nproceeds to discover their natural parts (and not vice versa, like in\nparticle physics). In the opening sentences of the condensed English\nversion of Köhler’s investigation of the relationship\nbetween the mental concepts of psychology and the material concepts of\nphysics, Köhler wrote: “In order to orient itself in the\ncompany of natural sciences, psychology must discover connections\nwherever it can between its own phenomena and those of other\ndisciplines. If this search fails, then psychology must recognize that\nits categories and those of natural science are incommensurable”\n(1938 [1920], 17). \nIn a preliminary draft “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\nChapter 1, What are Scientific Revolutions?” (dated 1958-1960,\nlikely composed in late 1958) of the first chapter of his projected\nbook, Kuhn initially used the idea of incommensurability to\ncharacterize stages of development in the arts in contrast to the\ntraditional image of scientific progress as cumulative that he set out\nto challenge (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). Although, this draft\nchapter was entirely rewritten as the introduction of Kuhn (1962), and\nwas explicitly intended only to provoke exploratory discussion and not\nfor publication, it strongly suggests that, at that time, Kuhn began\nto develop the idea of the incommensurability in science in reaction\nto the traditional (e.g. Sarton, Conant) contrast between development\nin the arts and cumulative progress in the sciences (see Pinto de\nOliveira, 2017). In the draft, Kuhn announced his project as an\nattempt to reshape the image of science so as to make it closer to the\nimage of art (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). He wanted to challenge the\ncumulative conception of scientific progress promoted by the old\nhistoriography of science, according to which “science appears\nto advance by accretion” and science is “an ever-growing\nedifice to which each scientist strives to add a few stones or a bit\nof mortar” (Kuhn 1958, 2, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017,\n748) in contrast to the image of art according to which “the\ntransition between one stage of artistic development and the next is a\ntransition between incommensurables” (Kuhn 1958, 3, as cited in\nPinto de Oliveira 2017, 749). \nA few pages later, Kuhn proceeds to apply the idea of\nincommensurability to science for the very first time, again while\ncomparing scientific revolutions to the non-cumulative nature of\nprogress in the arts: “Often a decision to embrace a new theory\nturns out to involve an implicit redefinition of the corresponding\nscience. Old problems may be relegated to another science or may be\ndeclared entirely ‘unscientific’. Problems that, on the old\ntheory, were non-existent or trivial may, with a new theory, become\nthe very archetypes of significant scientific achievement. And, as the\nproblems change, so, often, does the standard that distinguishes a\nreal scientific solution from a mere metaphysical speculation, word\ngame, or mathematical play. It follows that, to a significant extent,\nthe science that emerges from a scientific revolution is not only\nincompatible, but often actually incommensurable, with that which has\ngone before. Only as this is realized, can we grasp the full sense in\nwhich scientific revolutions are like those in the arts” (Kuhn\n1958, 17–18 as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 756). Kuhn\nconcludes that “If we are to preserve any part of the metaphor\nwhich makes inventions and discoveries new bricks for the scientific\nedifice, and if we are simultaneously to give resistance and\ncontroversy an essential place in the development of science, then we\nmay have to recognize that the addition of new bricks demands at least\npartial demolition of the existing structure, and that the new edifice\nerected to include the new brick is not just the old one plus, but a\nnew building. We may, that is, be forced to recognize that new\ndiscoveries and new theories do not simply add to the stock of\npre-existing scientific knowledge. They change it.” (Kuhn 1958,\n7, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 756). \nKuhn continued to struggle with, develop, and then refine his\nunderstanding of incommensurability until his death in 1996. Although\nhis development of incommensurability went through several stages (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1993, 206-222), he claimed to have made a\n“series of significant breakthroughs” beginning in 1987\n(Kuhn 2000 [1993], 228). They are described in a number of essays and\npublished lectures that were collected in (Kuhn 2000, cf. chs. 3, 4,\n5, 10 & 11), and a last as yet unpublished book by Kuhn on\nincommensurability is still pending (Conant and Haugeland 2000, 2).\nThe nature of these developments is controversial. Some commentators\nclaim that Kuhn’s incommensurability thesis underwent a\n‘major transformation’ (Sankey 1993), while others\n(including Kuhn himself) see only a more specific characterization of\nthe original core insight (Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 212; Kuhn 2000,\n[1983], 33ff.; Chen 1997). Kuhn’s original holistic\ncharacterization of incommensurability has been distinguished into two\nseparate theses. ‘Taxonomic incommensurability’ involves\nconceptual change in contrast to ‘methodological\nincommensurability’, which involves the epistemic values used to\nevaluate theories (Sankey 1991; Sankey and Hoyningen-Huene 2001; see\nSection 2.3.2 below). \nKuhn continued to emphasize the difference between normal, cumulative\ngrowth that does not change existing concepts; such as the discovery\nof Boyle’s law, which left the concepts of gas, pressure and\nvolume and the instruments used to measure them unchanged, from\nrevolutionary discoveries that could not have been made on the basis\nof antecedently available concepts; such as the discovery of\nNewton’s theory (Kuhn 2000 [1981], 14). Such developments\nrequire replacing existing concepts with new concepts that\nare incompatible with the older ideas. To help explain the\nnature of this conceptual incompatibility, Kuhn adopted the notion of\na ‘lexical taxonomy’ or ‘lexicon‘ from\nlinguistics (2000 [1989]). A lexical taxonomy stores and structures\nthe vocabulary used to state laws and theories; or more specifically,\nthe kinds of things that they describe. It is the “mental\nmodule” in which members of a speech community store the kind\nterms prerequisite to generalization and description (2000 [1991],\n92–97; 2000 [1993], 229, 233, 238–239, 242, 244). To\ncommunicate, the terms that speakers use do not have to have the same\nmeanings, nor do speakers need to use the same criteria for\nidentifying something as a member of a particular kind (one\nornithologist might identify ducks by their beaks, another by their\ntails) (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 99). Speakers need only share\nhomologous lexical structures; that is, vocabularies incorporating the\nsame system of taxonomic classification. This suffices to ensure that\nthey refer to the same objects with the same kind terms. If two\ntheories do not share the same taxonomic lexical structure, then they\nare incommensurable (2000 [1989], 63; 2000 [1991]; cf. Sankey 1997 and\nWolf 2007). \nTo help explicate incommensurability in terms of taxonomic\nclassification, Kuhn developed the no-overlap principle. The\nno-overlap principle precludes cross-classification of objects into\ndifferent kinds within a theory’s taxonomy. According to the\nno-overlap principle, no two kind terms may overlap in their referents\nunless they are related as species to genus. For example, there are no\ndogs that are also cats; no gold that is also silver, and that is what\nmakes the terms ‘dogs’, ‘cats’,\n‘silver’, and ‘gold’ kind terms (Kuhn 2000\n[1991], 92). Such kind terms are used to state laws and theories and\nmust be learned together through experience (2000 [1993],\n230; cf. Barker et al. 2003, 214 ff.). There are two possibilities.\nMost kind terms must be learned as members of one or another contrast\nset. For example to learn the term ‘liquid’, one must also\nmaster the terms ‘solid’ and ‘gas’. Other\ntypes of kind terms are not learned through contrast sets, but\ntogether with closely related terms through their joint application to\nsituations that exemplify natural laws. For example, the term\n‘force’ must be learned together with terms like\n‘mass’ and ‘weight’ through an application of\nHooke’s law and either Newton’s three laws of motion or\nelse the first and third laws together with the law of gravity (2000\n[1993], 231). According to Kuhn, scientific revolutions change the\nstructural relations between pre-existing kind terms, breaking the\nno-overlap principle (2000 [1991], 92–96]. This is to say that\ntheories separated by a revolution cross-classify the same things into\nmutually exclusive sets of kinds. A kind from one taxonomy is mutually\nexclusive with another if it cannot simply be introduced into it\nbecause the objects to which it refers would be subject to different\nsets of natural laws. This would result in conflicting expectations\nabout the same objects, loss of logical relations between statements\nmade with those concepts, and ultimately incoherence and\nmiscommunication (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 232, 238). For example,\nPtolemy’s theory classifies the sun as a planet, where planets\norbit the earth, while Copernicus’ theory classifies the sun as\na star, where planets orbit stars like the sun. A correct statement\naccording to Copernican theory, such as “Planets orbit the\nsun” is incoherent in Ptolemaic vocabulary (2000 [1991], 94).\nMoreover, the Copernican claim that the planets orbit the sun could\nnot even have been made without abandoning the Ptolemaic concepts and\ndeveloping new ones to replace (and not supplement) them. \nFurthermore, Kuhn (in a move toward Feyerabend’s view) now\nclaims that the same types of difficulties in communication that arise\ndue to incommensurability between members of different scientific\ncommunities separated by the passage of time also occur\nbetween members of different contemporaneous sub-disciplines that\nresult from scientific revolutions (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 238). This\nrepresents a significant change to his original phase-model of\nscientific advance, and a corresponding shift in his application of\nthe notion of incommensurability. Kuhn no longer represents scientific\nadvance as a linear progression from pre-normal science to\nnormal science, through crisis to revolution that results in a new\nphase of normal science. Instead, scientific revolutions are\ncompared to the process of speciation in biology, in that they result\nin branching into sub-disciplines that resemble a\nphylogenetic tree. The application of the relation of\nincommensurability is no longer restricted to diachronic episodes of\nscientific advance in which two theories are separated by a\nrevolution. The contemporaneous sub-disciplines that result from a\nscientific revolution can also be incommensurable with each other. The\nincommensurability derives from different training required to master\nthe incompatible kind terms used to state their laws and theories.\nThese shared kind terms cross-classify the same set of objects into\ndifferent sets of kinds, resulting in mutually exclusive lexical\ntaxonomies that break the no-overlap principle. Moreover, now not only\nare both processes (scientific progress and biological evolution)\nsimilar in that they are not fixed in advance on some set goal (i.e.\ntruth), but driven from behind (i.e. away from anomalies that play an\nanalogous role to selection pressure), but also the incommensurability\nof scientific theories is presented as analogous to the isolating\nmechanisms required for speciation (Kuhn 2000 [1991],\n94–99). \nKuhn compared the function of such lexical taxonomies to Kant’s\na priori when taken in a relativized sense. Each lexicon\nmakes a corresponding form of life possible within which the truth or\nfalsity of propositions may be both claimed and rationally justified.\nFor example, with the Aristotelian lexicon, one can speak of the truth\nor falsity of Aristotelian assertions, but these truth values have no\nbearing on the truth of apparently similar assertions made with the\nNewtonian lexicon (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 244). A lexicon is thus\nconstitutive of the objects of knowledge (Kuhn 2000 [1993],\n245); and consequently, Kuhn rejected characterizations of scientific\nprogress according to which science zeros in on the truth:\n“no shared metric is available to compare our\nassertions … and thus to provide a basis for a claim that our\n(or, for that matter, his) are closer to the truth” (2000\n[1993], 244). Instead, the logical status of a lexical structure, like\nthat of word-meanings in general, is that of convention, and the\njustification of a lexicon or of lexical change can only be pragmatic\n(2000 [1993], 244). Kuhn thus reaffirmed his earlier claim that the\nnotion of a match or correspondence between the ontology of a theory\nand its real counterpart in nature is illusive in principle (1970,\n206; 2000 [1993], 244). The implications that incommensurability has\nfor scientific realism have been widely discussed and continue to be\ncontroversial (cf. Devitt 2001, Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene 1997,\nSankey 2009). \nA lexicon is not only prerequisite to making meaningful statements, it\nalso sets limits on what can be meaningfully said within the community\nof speakers that share it: “There is, for example, no way, even\nin an enriched Newtonian vocabulary, to convey the Aristotelian\npropositions regularly misconstrued as asserting the proportionality\nof force and motion or the impossibility of a void. Using our\nconceptual lexicon, these Aristotelian propositions cannot be\nexpressed — they are simply ineffable — and we are barred\nby the no-overlap principle from access to the concepts required to\nexpress them ” (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 244; cf. 2000 [1989], 76). In\nthis way, Kuhn’s later notion of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories is based on effability. The structure of\nthe lexicon shared by a particular community determines how the world\ncan be described by its members, as well as how they will\nmisunderstand the history of their own discipline; that is, unless\nthey learn to understand older terms according to the structure of the\nolder lexicon. Where Kuhn had earlier likened the process by which\nhistorians come to understand antiquated science as a special type of\ntranslation, he retracted these claims, insisting that the process is\none of language learning, not translation (2000 [1993], 238, 244).\nKuhn often claimed that incommensurable theories are untranslatable\n(e.g. Kuhn 2000 [1991], 94). However, he also emphasized that\ntranslation is neither needed in the comparison of incommensurable\ntheories, nor in the hermeneutic historical method necessary to\nunderstand antiquated sciences (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 237, 238, 244). To\novercome the barriers posed by incommensurability to understanding\nantiquated sciences, and to understanding the special technical\nvocabulary used by contemporaneous, phylogenetically related\nsub-disciplines, it is neither necessary not possible to translate\nbetween them. Rather, one must become bilingual, learning to\nuse (and keep separate) the incongruently structured lexical\ntaxonomies underwriting different laws and theories. \nAs Kuhn refined his notion of incommensurability as a special type of\nconceptual incompatibility, some commentators began to distinguish it\nfrom ‘methodological incommensurability’. Methodological\nincommensurability is the idea that there are no shared, objective\nstandards of scientific theory appraisal, so that there are no\nexternal or neutral standards that univocally determine the\ncomparative evaluation of competing theories (Sankey and\nHoyningen-Huene 2001, xiii). This idea has also been recently\ndiscussed in detail under the rubric\n“Kuhn-underdetermination” (Carrier 2008, 278). The basic\nidea was developed out of Kuhn and Feyerabend’s rejections of\nthe traditional view that a distinguishing feature of science is a\nuniform, invariant scientific method, that remains fixed throughout\nits development (Kuhn 1962, 94, 103; Feyerabend 1975, 23–32; cf.\nFarrell 2003). Feyerabend famously argued that every proposed\nmethodological rule has been fruitfully violated at some point in the\ncourse of scientific advance, and that only by breaking such rules\ncould scientists have made the progressive steps for which they are\npraised (1975). He concluded that the idea of a fixed, historically\ninvariant scientific method is a myth. There are no universally\napplicable methodological rules. The only methodological rule that is\nuniversally applicable is ‘anything goes’, which buys its\nuniversality at the cost of being completely empty (1970a, 105). Kuhn\nchallenged the traditional view of scientific method as a set of\nrules, claiming that the standards of theory appraisal, such as\nsimplicity, accuracy, consistency, scope and fruitfulness (1977, 322),\ndepend on and vary with the currently dominant paradigm. He is often\ncited for having pointed out that as in political revolutions, so in\nchoice of paradigm, there is no standard higher than the assent of the\nrelevant community (1962, 94), and as having argued that there is\n“no neutral algorithm for theory choice, no systematic decision\nprocedure which, properly applied, must lead each individual in the\ngroup to the same decision” (1970, 200). Kuhn developed the idea\nthat such epistemic standards do not function as rules that determine\nrational theory choice, but as values that merely guide it (1977,\n331). Different scientists apply these values differently, and they\nmay even pull in different directions, so that there may be rational\ndisagreement between scientists from incommensurable paradigms, who\nsupport different theories due to their weighing the same values\ndifferently. \nAn examination of Feyerabend’s use and development of the idea\nof incommensurability of scientific theories reveals just how\nwidespread it was prior to 1962. It also reveals the veiled common\ncore of Feyerabend’s philosophy of science, which otherwise\nappears to be a series of critical papers on unrelated topics\n(Oberheim 2005, 2006). That common core is the use of the idea of\nincommensurability to challenge many different forms of conceptual\nconservativism in science and philosophy. Conceptual conservativism\nunjustly favors existing ideas over potential improvements offered by\nincommensurable alternatives. Feyerabend used the notion of\nincommensurability to attack the following forms of conceptual\nconservativism: Heisenberg’s idea of closed theories (1951),\nattempts to distinguish philosophical accounts of ontology from\nphysics (1954), the foundational role of the stability thesis in\nlogical positivism (1951, 1958a), Bohr’s principle of\ncomplementarity (1958b, 1961, 1962, 1965b, 1970a), and the logical\nempiricists’ models of explanation and reduction (1962, 1963a).\nHe also used the idea of incommensurability to attack forms of\nconceptual conservativism implicit in the models of theory testing\npromoted by classical empiricists, the logical positivists, the\nlogical empiricists, Popper, and Kuhn (1958a, 1962, 1963a, 1965b,\n1970a), Kantian transcendental necessities (1962, 1965b, 1965c),\ntraditional philosophical conundrums like the problem of the existence\nof the external world, the problem of the existence of other minds,\nand especially the mind-body problem (1962, 1965b, 1967, 1969a),\ncertain aspects of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy, as well as\nthe linguistic philosophical movement that takes the utility of\neveryday concepts as given and merely attempts to analyze them,\nwithout changing their meanings (or ‘arguments from\nsynonymy’) (1962, 1963a, 1965b, 1969b, 1970a), Popper’s\nconception of verisimilitude (1970b), and scientific realist\ncharacterizations of scientific knowledge and scientific advance\n(1970b). Feyerabend argued that all of these views cannot accommodate\nthe fact that the history of science reveals revolutionary\ndevelopments in which incommensurable alternatives replaced existing\nideas in the course of progress. \nIn his landmark 1962 “Explanation, Reduction and\nEmpiricism”, Paul Feyerabend initially introduced the term\n‘incommensurable’ as part of a criticism of the\nconceptual conservativism that he found in Nagel’s\ntheory of reduction and the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He\nargued that formal accounts of reduction and explanation are\nimpossible for general theories because they cannot accommodate the\ndevelopment of incommensurable concepts in the course of scientific\nadvance. Feyerabend used the notion of incommensurability to\ncharacterize the relation between two successive fundamental,\nuniversal scientific theories interpreted realistically; i.e. as\npurported descriptions of reality. By limiting incommensurability to\nuniversal theories, Feyerabend meant only those that apply to all\nobjects in the universe. By limiting incommensurability to fundamental\ntheories, Feyerabend meant those that have ontological implications;\ni.e., those that have implications about the very nature of reality.\nUniversal, fundamental scientific theories can be incommensurable only\nif they are interpreted realistically, according to Feyerabend,\nbecause otherwise they cannot compete as the one true theory, and are\nthus not mutually exclusive. By calling two such theories\nincommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they were conceptually\nincompatible: The main concepts of one could neither be defined on the\nbasis of the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor related to\nthem via a correct empirical statement (1962, 74, 90). As a\nconsequence, it is impossible to reduce incommensurable theories\nformally. \nIn 1962, Feyerabend illustrated the incommensurability of scientific\ntheories with a comparison of six pairs of central concepts drawn from\nthree episodes of fundamental theory change in the course of\nscientific advance: (1) The dynamical characterization of impetus in\nthe impetus theory of motion and the concept of force in the\nconceptual apparatus of Newtonian mechanics, (2 & 3) the concepts\nof temperature and entropy in the transition from phenomenological\nthermodynamics to kinetic theory, and (4, 5 & 6) the concepts\nmass, length and time in the transition from Newtonian to relativistic\nmechanics. Feyerabend subsequently added the example of geometrical\noptics and wave optics (1965b, 227). In 1962, Feyerabend also claimed\nthat incommensurability occurs between traditional, fundamental\ntheories in philosophy, and consequently arises in the discussions of\nthe mind-body problem, the problem of the reality of the external\nworld, and the problem of other minds (1962, 31, 90). Feyerabend\nargued that such age-old philosophical problems have not been solved\nbecause the disputants resist the kind of meaning change necessary for\ntheir dissolution. Concepts are incommensurable, according to\nFeyerabend, because they belong to mutually exclusive theoretical\nperspectives. These perspectives are mutually exclusive because they\ngive incompatible accounts of the nature of reality. Feyerabend argued\nthat because the meanings of their terms are provided by the theories\nto which they belong, when there is theoretical change, there are\nmeaning changes (1962, 68, 94). Feyerabend argued that these changes\nin meaning affect our theoretical and observational terms, as well as\nour conception of the nature of reality. When this occurs, there is\nincommensurability; or as Feyerabend later characterized his view:\n“a theory is incommensurable with another if its ontological\nconsequences are incompatible with the ontological consequences of the\nlatter” (1981a, xi). The idea is intended to capture conceptual\nincompatibility due to changes of meaning that occur in theoretical\ntransitions that affect our ontological beliefs. Two fundamental\ntheories are incommensurable because the meanings of their terms are\ndetermined by the theoretical principles that govern their use, and\nthese principles are qualitatively incompatible (1962, 58). \nFeyerabend used the idea of incommensurability to attempt to expose a\ndogmatic element that contemporary empiricists share with school\nphilosophies such as Platonism and Cartesianism (from whom empiricists\nhad tried to distance themselves by insisting on an empirical\nfoundation for scientific knowledge). The dogmatic element is due to\nthe assumption that the meanings of empirical terms remain stable\nthrough theoretical transitions; or what Feyerabend called the\nprinciple of meaning invariance (1962, 30). Feyerabend argued that\nthis principle is inconsistent with the existence of incommensurable\nconcepts. Feyerabend drew two main consequences from the insight that\nsome pairs of successive scientific theories are incommensurable.\nFirst, successive scientific theories that are incommensurable have no\nlogical relations: “The order introduced into our experiences by\nNewton’s theory is retained and improved by relativity. This\nmeans that the concepts of relativity theory are sufficiently rich to\nallow us to state all the facts which were stated before with the help\nof Newtonian physics. Yet these two sets of categories are completely\ndifferent and bear no logical relation to each other”\n(1962, 88–89). Because their concepts have different meanings,\nthey cannot be brought into formal logical relations. Second, a\nrevision in the logical empiricist conception of scientific advance is\nrequired. Older theories, and the concepts used to state them, are not\ncorrected and absorbed, and thereby legitimised. Rather, they are\nrejected and replaced, having been falsified. In this way, the logical\nempiricists’ conceptually conservative (or retentive) accounts\nof reduction and explanation are undermined. They cannot accommodate\nthe development of incommensurable concepts in the course of\nscientific advance. \nIn 1965, Feyerabend attempted to clarify his notion, claiming that two\ntheories are incommensurable when the meanings of their main\ndescriptive terms depend on mutually inconsistent principles (1965c,\n227; 1975, 269–270, 276). He also claimed that two theories are\nincommensurable if a new theory entails that all the concepts of the\npreceding theory have zero extension or if it introduces rules that\nchange the system of classes itself (1965a, 268). On this account, in\norder for there to be incommensurability, the “situation must be\nrigged in such a way that the conditions of concept formation in one\ntheory forbid the formation of the basic concepts of the other”\n(Feyerabend 1978, 68; cf. 1975, 269; 1981b, 154). Still later, he\nclaimed that with the term “incommensurability” he always\nmeant “deductive disjointedness, and nothing else” (1977,\n365). These subsequent formulations were all intended to capture the\nsame idea. \nAlthough Feyerabend first used the term ‘incommensurable’\nto describe successive scientific theories in 1962, he had been\ndeveloping his conception of incommensurability for about a decade\nprior to meeting Kuhn in the late 1950s. According to Feyerabend, he\nfirst discussed his notion of incommensurable concepts with the Kraft\nCircle from 1949–1951, while working toward his doctoral thesis\non protocol statements (Feyerabend 1951). The Kraft Circle was a\nstudent group named after Feyerabend’s Ph.D. supervisor Viktor\nKraft, which was modeled after the Vienna Circle of which Kraft had\nbeen a member. Prominent guests such as Elizabeth Anscombe and Ludwig\nWittgenstein attended some meetings (Feyerabend 1978, 108ff.,\n115–116; 1993, 259–260; 1995, 92). Feyerabend traced the\norigins of his conception of incommensurability to those ideas as\nrepresented by ‘thesis I’ in “An attempt at a\nrealistic interpretation of experience” (1958a), which is a\ncondensed version of his 1951 doctoral thesis. \nIn his (1958a), Feyerabend criticized two conceptions of meaning. He\nargued against the logical positivist idea that the meaning of an\nobservational term is determined by immediate experiences, as well as\nagainst the Wittgensteinian idea that the meaning of an observational\nterm is determined by its use. Instead, Feyerabend argued that the\nmeaning of a term, even an observation term, is determined by its\ntheoretical context, or more precisely, by the theoretical principles\nthat govern its correct use according to our best theories. For\nexample, according to Feyerabend, the correct meaning of the term\n‘temperature’ is not determined by its everyday use, but\nby the principles of statistical thermodynamics. On the basis of such\na conception, Feyerabend developed ‘thesis I’, according\nto which the interpretation of an observation language is determined\nby the theories that we use to explain what we observe, and it changes\nas soon as those theories change (1958a, 163). Feyerabend proceeded to\nargue that when older theories are replaced, the meanings of the\nobservational terms used to test those theories change. Just as in\n(1962), the result is incommensurability: The idea that successive\nscientific theories are conceptually incompatible and consequently\nlogically disjoint due to differences in the meanings of the\nobservation statements used to test them. Feyerabend’s\n‘thesis I’ is thus an early version of his\nincommensurability thesis. In his (1958a), with this notion of\nincommensurability, Feyerabend challenged an implicit conceptual\nconservativism in logical positivism: The assumptions that theoretical\nterms derive their meaning solely through their connection with\nexperience and that experience itself is a stable (or unchanging)\nfoundation on which theoretical meaning can be based. Instead of such\na bottom-up version of the relation of experience and theoretical\nknowledge, according to which experience determines the meanings of\nour theoretical terms, Feyerabend argued for a top-down version,\naccording to which our best theories determine the meanings that we\nattach to our experiences. According to Feyerabend, experience cannot\nbe taken for granted as some kind of fixed, neutral basis for\ncomparing theories. Rather, it takes on its particular character in\nlight of the theories we bring to it.  \nAt the time Feyerabend was developing these views, he was working very\nclosely with Karl Popper. There has been much controversy concerning\nFeyerabend’s evolving relationship to Popper, especially given\nits tumultuous trajectory, the revisions Feyerabend made concerning\nhis debts to Popper in the reprints of his original papers (see\nPreston 1997), informal accusations of plagiarism by Popperians (see\nCollodel 2016), and Feyerabend’s subsequent increasingly vocal\ndenials of his debts to Popper (Oberheim 2006, Ch. 3.4). It has\nhowever always been clear that Feyerabend developed his views on\nincommensurability while working as a vocal proponent of Karl\nPopper’s critical rationalist philosophy (Preston 1997, Oberheim\n2006, Collodel 2016), and that there are many different\ninterpretations of the relationships between their ideas. Bschir\n(2015) recently emphasizes just how Popperian Feyerabend’s\nphilosophy was at that time, and casts Feyerabend’s idea of\nincommensurability as a positive extension of many of Popper’s\nviews. Oberheim (2006) argues that incommensurability is exactly the\npoint at which Feyerabend breaks the Popperian framework. Many\n(including Popper) seem to interpret Feyerabend’s conception of\nincommensurability as a rather misguided development (or even\nmisunderstanding) of Karl Popper’s views (see Bschir 2015,\nCollodel 2016), which Feyerabend often repeated, sometimes seemingly\nas if they were his own. In any case, incommensurability marks the\npoint after which Feyerabend and Popper’s philosophies\ndramatically part ways, as they lead to very different conceptions of\nprogress (see Tambolo 2017).  \nFeyerabend’s route to the idea of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories was heavily influenced by a number of prominent\nindividuals who had been discussing a wide range of related topics. An\ninvestigation of the source of these ideas reveals some of the\nfounding fathers of the notion of incommensurability in the\ncontemporary history and philosophy of science. \nFeyerabend drew heavily from Duhem’s The Aim and Structure\nof Physical Theory (1954 [1906]) in his development of the notion\nof incommensurability of scientific theories. Many of the main points\nFeyerabend emphasized by calling scientific theories incommensurable\nhad been developed already by Duhem, who had argued that logic is\ninsufficient for determining the outcome of theoretical disputes in\nthe natural sciences, and who documented the difficulties historians\nhave in understanding the development of the natural sciences due to\nmeaning change. Duhem also already highlighted the communication\ndifficulties between proponents of competing scientific theories\nbecause of these differences in meaning. For example, Duhem had\nclaimed that what a physicist states as the result of an experiment is\nnot simply the recital of some observed facts. Rather, it is the\ninterpretation of these facts on the basis of the theories the\nscientist regards as true (1954 [1906], 159). It follows, according to\nDuhem, that in order to understand the meanings that scientists\nascribe to their own statements, it is necessary to understand the\ntheories that they use in order to interpret what they observe. Thus,\nDuhem had stated an early version of Feyerabend’s\nincommensurability thesis. Moreover, Duhem explicitly limited his\ndiscussion to non-instantial, physical theories, as opposed to mere\nexperimental laws. This is very similar to the criteria that marks the\nmost significant difference between Kuhn and Feyerabend’s\ndevelopment of the idea of incommensurability (see Section 4), and\nthat also delimits Einstein’s use of\n‘incommensurable’ while discussing the problems of theory\ncomparison (see Section 3.2.3). \nAfter explaining that the meaning of a term depends on the theory to\nwhich it belongs, and that a consequence of theoretical advance is\nmeaning change, Duhem continued: “If the theories admitted by\nthis physicist are those we accept, and if we agree to follow the same\nrules in the interpretation of the same phenomena, we speak the same\nlanguage and can understand each other. But that is not always the\ncase. It is not so when we discuss the experiments of a physicist who\ndoes not belong to our school; and it is especially not so when we\ndiscuss the experiments of a physicist separated from us by fifty\nyears, a century, or two centuries” (1954 [1906], 159). Duhem\ncontinued: “How many scientific discussions there are in which\neach of the contenders claims to have crushed his adversary under the\noverwhelming testimony of the facts! … How many propositions\nare regarded as monstrous errors in the writings of those who have\npreceded us! We should perhaps commemorate them as great truths if we\nreally wished to enquire into the theories which gave their\npropositions their true meaning” (Duhem 1954 [1906],\n160–161). These passages make the same basic points that both\nFeyerabend and Kuhn made with their claims about incommensurability of\nscientific theories: Because older ideas are misunderstood, as a\nresult of taking them out of their theoretical context, proponents of\nincommensurable scientific theories misunderstand each other, both\nclaiming to have the facts on their side. Kuhn and Feyerabend both\nclaimed that in such a situation, even empirical arguments can become\ncircular (Feyerabend 1965b, 152; Kuhn 1962, 94). \nIn his autobiography, Feyerabend acknowledged Niels Bohr’s\ndirect influence on the development of his notion of\nincommensurability in the 1950s. Feyerabend recalled a conversation in\nwhich Bohr had talked about the discovery that the square root of two\ncannot be an integer or a fraction. According to Feyerabend, Bohr\npresented the event as having led to the extension of a concept of\nnumber that retained some properties of integers and fractions, but\nchanged others; and claimed that the transition from classical to\nquantum mechanics was carried out in accordance with precisely this\nprinciple (1995, 78). Feyerabend also used the notion of\nincommensurability in a publication on Bohr’s complementarity\nthesis, where Feyerabend argued that Bohr’s complementarity\nthesis is an example of an unjustified conceptual conservativism,\ntaking issue with Bohr’s contention that all quantum mechanical\nevidence will always necessarily be expressed in classical terms\n(Feyerabend 1958b). He presented Bohr’s defence of the principle\nof complementarity as based on the conviction that every experience\nmust necessarily make its appearance within the frame of our customary\npoints of view, which is currently that of classical physics. However,\naccording to Feyerabend, even though classical concepts have been\nsuccessful in the past, and even though at the moment it may be\ndifficult, or even impossible, for us to imagine how to replace them,\nit does not follow that the classical framework could not one day be\nsuperseded by an incommensurable rival. Consequently, it does not\nfollow that all our future microscopic theories will have to take the\nnotion of complementarity as fundamental. Instead, according to\nFeyerabend, a theory may be found whose conceptual apparatus, when\napplied to the domain of validity of classical physics, would be just\nas comprehensive and useful as the classical apparatus, without\ncoinciding with it. He claimed that such a situation is by no means\nuncommon, and he used the transition from Newtonian to relativistic\nphysics to bolster his point. According to Feyerabend, while the\nconcepts of relativity theory are sufficiently rich to state all of\nthe facts captured by Newtonian physics, the two sets of concepts are\n“completely different” and bear “no logical\nrelations” to each other (1958b, 83; 1961, 388; 1962,\n88–89). This is clearly an early version of his\nincommensurability thesis. On Feyerabend’s fallibilist view of\nempirical knowledge, no element of our knowledge can be held to be\nnecessary or absolutely certain. In our search for satisfactory\nexplanations, we are at liberty to change any parts of our existing\nknowledge, however fundamental they may seem, including the concepts\nof classical physics. \nAlbert Einstein used the term ‘incommensurable’ to apply\nspecifically to difficulties selecting and evaluating scientific\ntheories before Kuhn and Feyerabend, and there are strong reasons to\nbelieve that Feyerabend’s development of incommensurability was\ndirectly inspired by Einstein’s use of the term (Oberheim 2016).\nIn his ‘Autobiographical notes’ (1949), Einstein attempted\nto explain that assessing the relative merits of universal physical\ntheories involves making difficult judgments about their\n‘naturalness’ that requires making judgments based on the\nreciprocal weighing of incommensurable qualities: “The second\npoint of view is not concerned with the relation to the material\nobservation but with the premises of the theory itself, with what may\nbriefly but vaguely be characterized as the ‘naturalness’\nor ‘logical simplicity’ of the premises (of the basic\nconcepts and of the relations between these which are taken as a\nbasis). This point of view, an exact formulation of which meets with\ngreat difficulties, has played an important role in the selection and\nevaluation of theories since time immemorial. The problem here is not\nsimply one of a kind of enumeration of the logically independent\npremises (if anything like this were at all unequivocally possible),\nbut that of a kind of reciprocal weighing of incommensurable\nqualities” (1949a, 23). \nThere are good reasons to believe that these admittedly cryptic\nremarks directly inspired Feyerabend’s use and development of\nthe idea of incommensurability. Although Feyerabend did not cite from\nEinstein (1949) in his (1962), he does cite from Bohr’s paper in\nthat very same edited volume (Schilpp 1949). Moreover, there are\nstriking similarities between Feyerabend and Einstein’s uses of\nthe term. First, both make a distinction between universal theories\nand theories that do not apply to the totality of all physical\nappearances, and then use this distinction to limit the application of\nincommensurability in the same way; i.e., the problem of weighing\nincommensurable qualities in selecting and evaluating theories is\nexplicitly only meant to apply to such universal physical\ntheories, and not just any pair of scientific theories (cf. Feyerabend\n1962a, 28 and Einstein 1949a, 23). Second, Einstein’s\ntheoretical attitude is explicitly a form of neo-Kantianism very much\nlike that of Feyerabend and Kuhn’s. According to Einstein, his\ntheoretical attitude “is distinct from that of Kant only by the\nfact that we do not conceive of the ‘categories’ as\nunalterable (conditioned by the nature of the understanding) but as\n(in the logical sense) free conventions. They appear to be a\npriori only insofar as thinking without the positing of\ncategories and of concepts in general would be as impossible as is\nbreathing in a vacuum” (Einstein 1949b, 374). This is the same\nbasic perspective that both Kuhn and Feyerabend delineated when they\ndeveloped their ideas of incommensurability. For example, Kuhn says,\n“I go around explaining my own position saying I am a Kantian\nwith moveable categories” (Kuhn 2000 [1995], 264), an idea\ndeveloped in detail by Hoyningen-Huene (1993). As for Feyerabend, he\nset out such a ‘Kant on wheels’ approach – to use\nPeter Lipton’s apt expression (Lipton 2001) – at the\nbeginning of ‘Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism’\n(1962a). Feyerabend overtly adopted such a neo-Kantian metaphysical\nperspective with changing categories in order to pursue the question:\nIf universal theories determine all of our experiences of the world,\nhow can experience be used to test such theories? Third, the main\nexample Feyerabend used to illustrate that and how incommensurable\ntheories can indeed be compared on the basis of a ‘crucial\nexperiment’ was Einstein’s quantitative prediction, and\nPerrin’s subsequent confirmation, of Brownian motion, which\nserved as a crucial experiment between classical and statistical\nthermodynamics – one of only three examples of incommensurable\nscientific theories in Feyerabend (1962a) (cf. Oberheim 2006, 253ff.;\nSirtes and Oberheim 2006). Feyerabend argued that although Brownian\nmotion was already a well-known phenomenon, it became\nevidence for statistical thermodynamics and against classical\nthermodynamics only after the development of the kinetic\ntheory, which was needed to interpret it as such. Even though there\nwas a crucial experiment between these two universal theories, the\ntheories have no common measure as the observations of\nBrownian motion that confirmed statistical thermodynamics were not\ncouched in a neutral observation language. The observations\nonly became evidence after they were interpreted according to\nstatistical theory. Einstein discussed exactly this episode at length\nin his ‘Autobiographical notes’, where he used the term\n‘incommensurable’ to apply to difficulties in judging the\nmerits of universal physical theories. Fourth, later Feyerabend often\ndefended his view that there is no fixed scientific method\n(e.g. 1975, 10–11) by citing Einstein: “The external\nconditions which are set for [the scientist] by the facts of\nexperience do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted, in\nthe construction of his conceptual world, by the adherence to an\nepistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic\nepistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist”\n(Einstein1949b, 683ff.). Although Feyerabend’s development of\nthe idea of incommensurability of scientific theories was received by\nthe philosophic and scientific communities as propagating radical,\nirrationalist ideas about science, he was actually trying to develop\nsomething he found in Einstein. In the preface to the German version\nof Against Method, Feyerabend wrote, “I want to\nemphasize yet again that the views in this book are not new –\nfor physicist like Mach, Boltzmann, Einstein and Bohr they were a\ntriviality. But the ideas of these great thinkers have been distorted\n[by positivist philosophers] beyond recognition” (1983, 12, our\ntranslation). \nFeyerabend, like Kuhn, explicitly drew from Wolfgang\nKöhler’s work in Gestalt psychology in the development of\nhis notion of incommensurability. Moreover, Köhler had already\napplied the notion of incommensurability to scientific theories (see\nSection 2.2.2). Köhler’s use applies to different areas\nwithin natural science, not to successive scientific theories such as\nin early Kuhn (1962). Köhler’s use of the term\n‘incommensurable’ to describe the relationship between the\nconcepts of psychology and physics was a main source of\nFeyerabend’s development of the idea of the incommensurability\n(Oberheim 2005). Feyerabend’s discussion of incommensurability\nin the formulation of the mind-body problem derives directly from\nKöhler’s claims (Oberheim 2005). However,\nFeyerabend’s (Wittgensteinian) strategy for overcoming the\nincommensurability in the dissolution of philosophical conundrums is\nnot Köhler’s (Oberheim 2006, 43–45). Feyerabend\nsuggested that the insolubility is due to the unwillingness of\nphilosophers of different persuasions to change the deeply entrenched\nmeanings of their terms, and that in this case, the mental should be\nreinterpreted so that it is compatible with materialism (Feyerabend\n1963b). \nWhile Feyerabend’s notion of the incommensurability did not\nsignificantly change throughout his early writings in the philosophy\nof science, in his later more general philosophy, Feyerabend extended\nthe application of the term beyond universal scientific theories. For\nexample, he used it to characterize the transition from the Greek\narchaic, aggregate worldview of Homer to the substance world-view of\nthe Pre-Socratics (1975, 261-269), and thereafter in a very broad\nsense, discussing incommensurable frameworks of thought and action\n(1975, 271), incommensurability in the domain of perceptions (1975,\n225, 271), incommensurable discoveries and attitudes (1975, 269) and\nincommensurable paradigms (1981b [1970], 131–161), where such\nincommensurability involves the suspension of some of the universal\nprinciples of the received view. Feyerabend characterized this wider\nnotion of incommensurability as a historical, anthropological thesis\n(1975, 271), but also applied it to different stages of the\ndevelopment of thought and perception in the individual (1975, 274).\nHe also further developed his notion of incommensurability, claiming\nthat it involves major conceptual changes of both ‘overt’\nand ‘covert classifications’ (in Whorff’s sense), so\nthat incommensurability is difficult to explicitly define, and can\nonly be shown (1975, 224–225). Still later, Feyerabend argued\nthat ‘potentially every culture is all cultures’,\napparently retracting a wider, cultural notion of incommensurability\n(Feyerabend 1994). \nInitially, Feyerabend had a more concrete characterization of the\nnature and origins of incommensurability than Kuhn. On\nFeyerabend’s view, because the nature of objects depends on the\nmost advanced theories about them, and because the meaning of\nobservation statements depends on the nature of those objects, the\ninterpretation of an observation language is determined by the\ntheories we use to explain what we observe. Kuhn, by contrast, was\ninitially much less sure about the exact meaning of his notion of\nincommensurability, especially regarding world change, which he saw as\nthe most fundamental aspect of incommensurability. Kuhn frankly\nconfessed to have been at a loss: “In a sense that I am unable\nto explicate further, the proponents of competing paradigms practice\ntheir trades in different worlds” (1962, 150). He suggested that\n“we must learn to make sense of statements that at least\nresemble these” (1962, 121), and then spent a great deal of\neffort attempting to do so. \nFurthermore, Feyerabend’s concept of incommensurability of\nscientific theories was much more restricted than Kuhn’s. For\nKuhn, incommensurability had three prima facie heterogeneous\ndomains, holistically bound: a change of problems and standards, a\nchange of concepts used to state and solve them, and a change of\nworld-view in which they arise. Feyerabend’s focus, on the other\nhand, was initially exclusively on concepts occurring in universal or\nfundamental theories, together with their ontological implications.\nIronically, however, in developments after 1962, both authors move in\nopposite directions. Kuhn gradually eliminated everything from his\nnotion of incommensurability that does not concern scientific\nconcepts, and ended more or less where Feyerabend began (see Carrier\n2001; Chen 1997; Hoyningen-Huene 1990, 487-488; Hoyningen-Huene 1993,\n212-218; Hoyningen-Huene 2004, Sankey 1993; Sankey 1994, 16-30; Sankey\n1997). Feyerabend, by contrast, increasingly emphasized aspects of\nperceptual change (1975, 225–229, 273–274; 1978, 68; 1988,\n172–176), and also changes to the set of legitimate problems a\ndiscipline should handle (1975, 274–275), and his later\nphilosophy emphasizes one of Kuhn’s original points; the role of\nnon-binding, epistemic values in theory choice (cf. Farrell 2003). \nWith respect to the range of theories that are subject to\nincommensurability, Feyerabend’s concept is again much more\nrestricted than Kuhn’s. For Feyerabend, only universal,\nfundamental, non-instantial theories that are\ninterpreted realistically can be incommensurable (Feyerabend\n1962, 44; 1965b, 216; 1975, 114, 271, 284; 1975, 221–222; 1987,\n272). Feyerabend was interested in fundamental, universal theories\nthat apply to everything, because he believed that only “such\ncomprehensive structures of thought” have ontological\nimplications that are capable of sustaining entire worldviews\n(Feyerabend 1962, 28; cf. Feyerabend 1954 and Oberheim 2006, 157ff.).\nHe restricted incommensurability to non-instantial theories, which he\ndistinguished from empirical generalizations, on the basis of the\ndifferences in their test procedures. Generalizations of the form\n‘All As are Bs’ (regardless of whether the\nAs or Bs are observable) are tested by inspecting\ninstances. So for example, Kepler’s first law makes claims about\nthe planets, which can be tested directly by inspecting their motion.\nIn order to test non-instantial theories, such as Newton’s\ntheory of gravitation, first empirical generalizations must be derived\nfrom them with the help of auxiliary hypothesis, and only thereafter\ncan they be tested by inspection (Feyerabend 1962, 28). Due to these\nrestrictions (only universal, fundamental, non-instantial theories),\nfor Feyerabend, incommensurability of scientific theories occurs\ncomparatively rarely (1987, 272). Kuhn included a wider range of\ntheories as candidates for incommensurability. For him, even smaller\nepisodes, like unexpected discoveries, might be incommensurable with\nthe earlier tradition (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 197-201). This\ndifference in the range of incommensurability between Kuhn and\nFeyerabend’s versions finds its most striking expression in the\nway they regard the transition from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican\ntheory. For Kuhn, the differences between these two theories comprise\nan exemplary illustration of incommensurability. For Feyerabend,\nhowever, because planetary theory lacks the quality of universality,\nthere is no incommensurability (1975, 114). Furthermore, in his later\nwritings Kuhn insisted that the version of incommensurability he\nchampioned had always been “local incommensurability,” a\nnotion that restricts conceptual change to a few, typically\ninterconnected concepts (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 213, 219). Thus,\nthere may be empirical consequences of incommensurable theory pairs\nthat can be immediately compared. For instance, the geocentric and\nheliocentric planetary theories are incommensurable in Kuhn’s\nsense, while predictions of the planetary positions of both theories\nare fully commensurable, and can be immediately compared regarding\ntheir empirical accuracy. By contrast, Feyerabend always thought of\nhis concept more globally, as affecting all statements\nderivable from two fundamental theories (1962, 93; 1965c, 117; 1965b,\n216; 1975, 275–276; 1981a, xi).  \nBoth Kuhn and Feyerabend have often been misread as advancing the view\nthat incommensurability implies incomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene\n1993, 218ff.; Oberheim 2006, 235). In response to this misreading,\nKuhn repeatedly emphasized that incommensurability does not imply\nincomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 236ff.). Theory comparison\nis merely more complicated than imagined by some philosophers of\nscience. In particular, it cannot fully be made\n‘point-by-point’. It is not an algorithmic procedure (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1993, 147-154; Feyerabend 1975, 114; 1981a, 238), nor\none that requires translation into a neutral observation language.\nDifferent epistemic values, such as universality, accuracy,\nsimplicity, fruitfulness may pull in different directions (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1992, 492–496; 1993, 150–154; Feyerabend\n1981a, 16; 1981c, 238) allowing for the possibility of rational\ndisagreement. But even if a full point-by-point comparison of\nincommensurable theories is impossible, and even if theory comparison\ndoes not have the status of a proof, a comparative evaluation of\nincommensurable theories is still possible (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993,\n236-258; Carrier 2001) and rational in a means/ends or instrumental\nsense. For example, according to Kuhn it is rational to choose\ntheories that are better problem-solvers because they better serve the\nends of science. This property of theory choice makes the overall\nprocess of science both rational and progressive. With the notion of\nincommensurability, Kuhn was not so much challenging the rationality\nof theory choice, as trying to make room for the possibility of\nrational disagreement between proponents of competing paradigms. In\nfact, according to Kuhn, “incommensurability is far from being\nthe threat to rational evaluation of truth claims that it has\nfrequently seemed. Rather, it’s what is needed, within a\ndevelopmental perspective, to restore some badly needed bite to the\nwhole notion of cognitive evaluation. It is needed, that is, to defend\nnotions like truth and knowledge from, for example, the excesses of\npost-modernist movements like the strong program” (2000 [1991],\n91). \nThe extent of the misreading of incommensurability as implying\nincomparability is even more dramatic in Feyerabend’s case. A\nfar cry from claiming that incommensurable theories cannot be\ncompared, Feyerabend explicitly and repeatedly argued that\nincommensurable alternatives actually offer a better means of\ncomparing the merits of theories than the mere development of\ncommensurable alternatives (Feyerabend 1962, 66; cf. Oberheim 2006,\n235ff.). He illustrated this point with an example of a crucial\nexperiment between incommensurable theories. He argued that even\nthough the central concepts of statistical and classical\nphenomenological thermodynamics are incommensurable, it was still\npossible indirectly to stage a crucial experiment between them\n(Perrin’s confirmation of Einstein’s quantitative\npredictions of Brownian motion). This was the centre piece of\nFeyerabend’s argument for pluralism. The argument turns on the\nclaim that this refutation of classical phenomenological\nthermodynamics could not have been conducted without the development\nof statistical thermodynamics, which is an incommensurable\nalternative. Feyerabend concluded that some observations can\nonly be interpreted as refutations of an existing theory\nafter an incommensurable alternative has been developed with which to\ninterpret them (cf. Oberheim 2006, 240–245). His unorthodox\nimage of scientific progress is delineated as an increase in a set of\nincommensurable alternatives, each forcing the others into greater\narticulation (Feyerabend 1965c, 107; 1975, 30; cf. Oberheim 2005;\nOberheim 2006, 260ff.). \nThe source of the misunderstanding concerning incomparability appears\nto be Feyerabend’s onetime suggestion that\n“incommensurable theories may not possess any comparable\nconsequences” (1962, 94). However, here Feyerabend was arguing\nthat although the same experimental set-up might produce a numerical\nresult that can be used to confirm both of two\nincommensurable theories (e.g. measuring the time of a freefalling\nstone to test predictions by both Newtonian mechanics and Relativity\ntheory), in order to use the result to confirm a theory, it must be\ninterpreted by that theory. Given that the two incommensurable\ntheories will use qualitatively incompatible concepts to\ninterpret quantitatively identical results, they will\ninterpret the same quantitative sentences as different qualitative\nstatements. Feyerabend concluded directly thereafter: “Hence,\nthere may not exist any possibility of finding a\ncharacterization of the observations which are supposed to\nconfirm two incommensurable theories” (1962, 94, italics\ninserted). This does rule out the possibility of using a\nneutral observation language to compare the empirical\nconsequences of two incommensurable theories. Yet Feyerabend did not\nconclude that this inhibits their comparison, but rather that there is\nno need for a neutral observation language in order to\ncompare them. Feyerabend also mentions other possibilities of\ncomparing incommensurable theories (Feyerabend 1965b, 217; 1970, 228;\n1975, 284; 1978, 68; 1981a, 16). Some of these involve making\nsubjective judgments about how to weigh different values that may pull\nin different directions (methodological incommensurability). \nFinally, there is one central, substantive point of agreement between\nKuhn and Feyerabend. Both see incommensurability as precluding the\npossibility of interpreting scientific development as an approximation\nto truth (or as an “increase of verisimilitude”)\n(Feyerabend, 1965c, 107; 1970, 220, 222, 227–228; 1975, 30, 284;\n1978, 68; Kuhn 1970, 206; 2000 [1991], 95; 2000 [1993], 243ff.; cf.\nOberheim 2006, 180ff.; Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 262-264). They reject\nsuch characterizations of scientific progress because they recognize\nand emphasize that scientific revolutions result in changes in\nontology. Such changes are not just refinements of, or additions to,\nthe older ontology, such that these developments could be seen as\ncumulative additions to already established theoretical views. Rather,\nthe new ontology replaces its predecessor. Consequently,\nneither Kuhn nor Feyerabend can correctly be characterized as\nscientific realists who believe that science makes progress toward the\ntruth.","contact.mail":"eric.oberheim@googlemail.com","contact.domain":"googlemail.com"},{"date.published":"2009-02-25","date.changed":"2018-09-04","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/","author1":"Eric Oberheim","author1.info":"http://www.philos.uni-hannover.de/hoyningen.html","entry":"incommensurability","body.text":"\n\n\nThe term ‘incommensurable’ means ‘to have no common\nmeasure’. The idea has its origins in Ancient Greek mathematics,\nwhere it meant no common measure between magnitudes. For example,\nthere is no common measure between the lengths of the side and the\ndiagonal of a square. Today, such incommensurable relations are\nrepresented by irrational numbers. The metaphorical application of\nthis mathematical notion specifically to the relation between\nsuccessive scientific theories became controversial in 1962 after it\nwas popularised by two influential philosophers of science: Thomas\nKuhn and Paul Feyerabend. They appeared to be challenging the\nrationality of natural science and were often considered to be among\n“the worst enemies of science” (Theocharis and Psimopoulos\n1987, 596; cf. Preston et al. 2000). Since 1962, the\nincommensurability of scientific theories has been a widely discussed,\ncontroversial idea that was instrumental in the historical turn in the\nphilosophy of science and the establishment of the sociology of\nscience as a professional discipline.\n\nIn the influential The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962), Kuhn made the dramatic claim that history of science reveals\nproponents of competing paradigms failing to make complete contact\nwith each other’s views, so that they are always talking at\nleast slightly at cross-purposes. Kuhn characterized the collective\nreasons for these limits to communication as the incommensurability of\npre- and post-revolutionary scientific traditions, claiming that the\nNewtonian paradigm is incommensurable with its Cartesian and\nAristotelian predecessors in the history of physics, just as\nLavoisier’s paradigm is incommensurable with that of\nPriestley’s in chemistry (Kuhn 1962, 147–150; cf.\nCaamaño 2009 and Hoyningen-Huene 2008). These competing\nparadigms lack a common measure because they use different concepts\nand methods to address different problems, limiting communication\nacross the revolutionary divide. Kuhn initially used\nincommensurability predominately to challenge cumulative\ncharacterizations of scientific advance, according to which scientific\nprogress is an improving approximation to the truth, and to challenge\nthe idea that there are unchanging, neutral methodological standards\nfor comparing theories throughout the development of the natural\nsciences. Like in evolution, the process does not change\ntoward some fixed goal according to some fixed rules, methods\nor standards, but rather it changes away from the pressures\nexerted by anomalies on the reigning theory (Kuhn 1962,\n170–173). The process of scientific change is eliminative and\npermissive rather than instructive. In the process of confronting\nanomalies, certain alternatives are excluded, but nature does not\nguide us to some uniquely correct theory. \nKuhn developed and refined his initial idea over the following\ndecades, repeatedly emphasizing that incommensurability neither means\nnor implies incomparability; nor does it make science irrational (e.g.\nKuhn 2000 [1970], 155ff.). He focused increasingly on conceptual\nincompatibility as manifest in the structural differences used to\nclassify the kinds whose relations are stated in laws and theories,\nsuch as chemical elements and biological species (Kuhn 2000, see\nespecially chs. 3, 4, 5, 10 & 11). He used incommensurability to\nattack the idea, prominent among logical positivists and logical\nempiricists, that comparing theories requires translating their\nconsequences into a neutral observation language (cf. Hoyningen-Huene\n1993, 213–214). In the late 1990s, he explicated\nincommensurability in terms of ineffability, emphasizing that\nit became possible for scientists to make and understand certain new\nstatements only after a particular theory had been introduced\n(in the older vocabulary the new sentences are nonsensical), just as\nit only becomes possible for historians to understand certain older\nstatements by setting aside current conceptions that otherwise cause\ndistortions (Kuhn 2000 [1989], 58–59; 2000 [1993], 244). Such\n‘taxonomic incommensurability’ results in\ntranslation failure between local subsets of inter-defined terms due\nto the cross-classification of objects into mutually exclusive\ntaxonomies. This can be distinguished from ‘methodological\nincommensurability’, according to which there is no common\nmeasure between successive scientific theories, in the sense that\ntheory comparison is sometimes a matter of weighing historically\ndeveloping values, not following fixed, definitive rules (Sankey and\nHoyningen-Huene 2001, vii-xv). This makes room for rational\ndisagreement in theory comparison, as scientists may apply different\nvalues (such as scope, simplicity, fruitfulness, accuracy) in\nevaluating and comparing particular theories, so that theory choice is\nnot unequivocally determined throughout the scientific community. \nPaul Feyerabend first used the term incommensurable in 1962 in\n“Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism” to describe the\nlack of logical relations between the concepts of fundamental theories\nin his critique of logical empiricists models of explanation and\nreduction. He argued that in the course of scientific advance, when\nfundamental theories change, meanings change, which can result in a\nnew conception of the nature of reality. By calling two fundamental\ntheories incommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they were conceptually\nincompatible: The main concepts of one could neither be defined on the\nbasis of the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor related to\nthem via a correct empirical statement (Feyerabend 1962, 74, 90). For\nexample, Feyerabend claimed that the concepts of temperature and\nentropy in kinetic theory are incommensurable with those of\nphenomenological thermodynamics (1962, 78); whereas the Newtonian\nconcepts of mass, length and time are incommensurable with those of\nrelativistic mechanics (1962, 80). Feyerabend repeatedly used the idea\nof incommensurability to challenge a wide range of forms of conceptual\nconservativism, arguing that they unjustifiably favor successful,\nentrenched concepts over potential improvements, and overlook the\npossibility of developing incommensurable alternatives (Oberheim 2005,\n2006). \nThe entry is organized around the 1962 popularisations of the concept\nof incommensurability by Kuhn and Feyerabend and the basic ideas that\ninfluenced their developments of this concept. First, Kuhn’s\nnotion of incommensurability as it was initially developed is\ncharacterized, as is its cause and its purported consequences. That is\nfollowed by an examination of Kuhn’s route to the idea, and then\nhis subsequent development after 1962. The sections on\nFeyerabend’s notion of incommensurability mirror the same basic\nstructure. They are followed by a brief comparison of Kuhn and\nFeyerabend’s views on incommensurability, especially its\nrelation to theory comparison. \nKuhn’s notion of incommensurability in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions misleadingly appeared to imply that\nscience was somehow irrational, and consequently it faced many\nchallenges and caused many confusions. This led to many\nclarifications, and eventually to a substantial redevelopment of a\nmore precise and restricted version of it over the following decades.\nKuhn initially used the term holistically to capture methodological,\nobservational and conceptual disparities between successive scientific\nparadigms that he had encountered in his historical investigations\ninto the development of the natural sciences (Kuhn 1962,\n148–150). Later, he refined the idea arguing that\nincommensurability is due to differences in the taxonomic structures\nof successive scientific theories and neighbouring contemporaneous\nsub-disciplines. Kuhn’s developing notion of incommensurability\nhas received much attention, and it continues to provoke plenty of\ncontroversy (cf. Bird 2007, Demir 2008, Moreno 2009, Psillos 2008, and\nSoler, Sankey and Hoyningen-Huene 2008). \nIn The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), Thomas\nKuhn used the term ‘incommensurable’ to characterize the\nholistic nature of the changes that take place in a scientific\nrevolution. His investigations into the history of science revealed a\nphenomena often now called ‘Kuhn loss’: Problems whose\nsolution was vitally important to the older tradition may temporarily\ndisappear, become obsolete or even unscientific. On the other hand,\nproblems that had not even existed, or whose solution had been\nconsidered trivial, may gain extraordinary significance in the new\ntradition. Kuhn concluded that proponents of incommensurable theories\nhave different conceptions of their discipline and different views\nabout what counts as good science; and that these differences arise\nbecause of changes in the list of problems that a theory must resolve\nand a corresponding change in the standards for the admissibility of\nproposed solutions (cf. Stillwaggon Swan and Bruce 2011). So for\nexample, Newton’s theory was initially widely rejected because\nit did not explain the attractive forces between matter, something\nrequired of any mechanics from the perspective of the proponents of\nAristotle and Descartes’ theories (Kuhn 1962, 148). According to\nKuhn, with the acceptance of Newton’s theory, this question was\nbanished from science as illegitimate, only to re-emerge with the\nsolution offered by general relativity. He concluded that scientific\nrevolutions alter the very definition of science itself. \nChanges in problems and standards come with corresponding conceptual\nchanges, so that after a revolution, many (though not all) of the\nolder concepts are still used, but in a slightly modified way. Such\nconceptual changes have both intensional and extensional aspects,\nwhich is to say that the same terms take on different meanings and are\nused to refer to different things when used by proponents of competing\nincommensurable theories. The changes in the intensional aspects of\nconcepts result because the terms used to express a theory are\ninter-defined and their meanings depend on the theories to which they\nbelong. For example, the meanings of the terms\n‘temperature’, ‘mass’, ‘chemical\nelement’ and ‘chemical compound’ depend on which\ntheories are used to interpret them. Conceptual changes also result in\nthe exclusion of some old elements of the extension of a concept,\nwhile new elements come to be subsumed by it, so that the same term\ncomes to refer to different things. For example, the term\n‘Planet’ referred to the sun but not the earth in the\nPtolemaic theory, whereas it refers to the earth and not the sun in\nthe Copernican theory. Incommensurable theories use some of the same\nterms, but with different meanings, to refer to different sets of\nthings. Two scientists who perceive the same situation differently,\nbut nevertheless use the same vocabulary to describe it, speak from\nincommensurable viewpoints (Kuhn 1970, 201). \nOne of the most controversial claims to emerge from Kuhn’s\nassertions about the incommensurability of scientific theories is that\nthe proponents of different paradigms work in different worlds (Kuhn\n1962, 150; cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1990; 1993). Drawing on experiments in\nthe psychology of perception, Kuhn argued that the rigorous training\nrequired for admittance to a paradigm conditions scientist’s\nreactions, expectations and beliefs (Kuhn 1962, 128; 2000 [1989],\n66–71), so that learning how to apply the concepts of a theory\nto solve exemplary problems determines scientists’ experiences.\nSo for example, where a proponent of the Newtonian theory sees a\npendulum, an Aristotelian saw constrained free fall; where Priestley\nsaw dephlogisticated air, Lavoisier saw oxygen; where Berthollet saw a\ncompound that could vary in proportion, Proust saw only a physical\nmixture. Kuhn (and Feyerabend) used the analogy of a Gestalt switch to\nillustrate this point. In this way, one main source of the notion of\nincommensurability of scientific theories has been the development of\nGestalt psychology. \nAccording to Kuhn, these three interrelated aspects of\nincommensurability (changes in problems and standards that define a\ndiscipline, changes in the concepts used to state and solve those\nproblems, and world change) jointly constrain the interpretation of\nscientific advance as cumulative. Scientific progress, Kuhn argued, is\nnot simply the continual discovery of new facts duly explained.\nInstead, revolutions change what counts as the facts in the first\nplace. When reigning theories are replaced by incommensurable\nchallengers, the purported facts are re-described according to new and\nincompatible theoretical principles. The main goal of Kuhn’s\nStructure was to challenge the idea of scientific progress as\ncumulative, according to which what is corrected or discarded in the\ncourse of scientific advance is that which was never really scientific\nin the first place, and Kuhn used incommensurability as the basis of\nhis challenge. Instead of understanding scientific progress as a\nprocess of change toward some fixed truth, Kuhn compared his\nsuggestion to that of Darwin’s: scientific progress is like\nevolution in that its development should be understood without\nreference to a fixed, permanent goal (1962, 173). \nAccording to Kuhn, he discovered incommensurability as a graduate\nstudent in the mid to late 1940s while struggling with what appeared\nto be nonsensical passages in Aristotelian physics (Kuhn 2000 [1989],\n59–60). He could not believe that someone as extraordinary as\nAristotle could have written them. Eventually patterns in the\ndisconcerting passages began to emerge, and then all at once, the text\nmade sense to him: a Gestalt switch that resulted when he changed the\nmeanings of some of the central terms. He saw this process of meaning\nchanging as a method of historical recovery. He realized that in his\nearlier encounters, he had been projecting contemporary meanings back\ninto his historical sources (Whiggish history), and that he would need\nto peel them away in order to remove the distortion and understand the\nAristotelian system in its own right (hermeneutic history). For\ninstance, when he encountered the word “motion” in\nAristotle (the standard translation of the Greek kinesis), he\nwas thinking in terms of the change of position of objects in space\n(as we do today). But to get more closely at Aristotle’s\noriginal usage, he had to expand the meaning of motion to cover a much\nbroader range of phenomena that include various other sorts of change,\nsuch as growth and diminution, alternation, and generation and\ncorruption, making an objects motion in space (displacement or\n‘locomotion’) just a special case of motion. Kuhn realized\nthat these sorts of conceptual differences indicated breaks between\ndifferent modes of thought, and he suspected that such breaks must be\nsignificant both for the nature of knowledge, and for the sense in\nwhich the development of knowledge can be said to make progress.\nHaving made this discovery, Kuhn changed his career plans, leaving\ntheoretical physics to pursue this strange phenomenon. Some fifteen\nyears later the term ‘incommensurable’ first appears in\nhis classic The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962). \nOf all the sources influencing Kuhn on incommensurability, at least\none deserves special attention. In the foreword of The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn acknowledged a deep debt to\nLudwik Fleck, a bacteriologist who developed the first explicit\nsociology of natural science, and anticipated many contemporary views\nabout the social construction of knowledge. Around 1950, Kuhn was\nenticed by the potential relevance to his experience of\nincommensurability of Fleck’s paradoxical title: Entstehung\nund Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einführung in\ndie Lehre von Denkstil und Denkkollektiv (1935)(Genesis and\nDevelopment of a Scientific Fact, 1979). There and in other\nearlier works, Fleck had already used ‘inkommensurabel’ to\ndescribe different styles of thinking within the natural sciences as\nwell as to discuss the ramifications of radical conceptual change in\nthe history of science. For example, Fleck used the term\n‘inkommensurabel’ to describe the differences between\n‘medical thinking’ and ‘scientific thinking’.\nThe former addresses irregular, temporally dynamic phenomena such as\nan illness, while the later addresses uniform phenomena (Fleck 1986\n[1927], 44–45). Fleck also used the term\n‘inkommensurabel’ to describe conceptual replacements in\ntheoretical transitions within what he considered the most vital of\nthe natural sciences, the medical sciences. For example, he claimed\nthat an old concept of disease became incommensurable with a newer\nconcept that was not a completely adequate substitute for it (Fleck\n1979 [1935], 62). While Fleck’s program of comparative\nepistemology anticipates Kuhn’s ideas in many significant\nrespects, it is also strikingly different (Harwood 1986; Oberheim\n2005; Peine 2011). The most pervasive differences concerning\nincommensurability are that Fleck treats meaning and meaning change as\na function of how concepts are received and developed by the\ncollective, while for Kuhn it is individuals who develop and apply the\nconcepts that advance science. Moreover, for Fleck meaning change is a\ncontinuous feature of scientific development, whereas Kuhn\ndistinguishes normal scientific development that does not change\nmeanings from revolutionary developments that do. \nEven so, Fleck emphasized all three of the interrelated aspects of the\nshifts that Kuhn called revolutions and tried to capture by calling\ntheories ‘incommensurable’ (changes in problems and\nstandards (1979 [1935], 75–76; 1979 [1936], 89), conceptual\nchange (e.g. 1979 [1935]; 1979 [1936], 72, 83) and world change (e.g.\n1986 [1936], 112). Fleck argued that science does not approach the\ntruth because successive thought-styles raise new problems and discard\nolder forms of knowledge (Fleck 1986 [1936], 111–112; 1979\n[1935], 19, 51, 137–139; cf. Harwood 1986, 177). Fleck\nemphasized that scientific terms acquire their meanings through their\napplication within a particular theoretical context and that those\nmeanings change when theories change in the course of advance, even\noffering the example of ‘chemical elements’ and\n‘compounds’ repeated by Kuhn (Fleck 1979 [1935], 25, 39,\n40, 53–54). Fleck emphasized the theory-ladenness of observation\nwith explicit reference to Gestalt switches; stressing that a\n‘thought-style’ determines not only the meanings of the\nconcepts it uses, but also the perception of phenomena to be\nexplained, developing examples from the history of anatomical\nrepresentation (1979 [1935], 66; 1986 [1947]). Fleck (like Kuhn,\nFeyerabend and Wittgenstein) acknowledged Wolfgang Köhler’s\nwork in psychology of perception in this regard. Fleck concluded that\nscientific advance is not cumulative, that conceptual differences\nbetween members of different scientific communities cause\ncommunication difficulties between them (1979 [1936], 109), and later\nfor historians trying to understand older ideas (1979 [1936],\n83–85, 89). Fleck even emphasized that meaning change in the\ncourse of scientific advance causes translation failure between\ntheories, anticipating a central aspect of Kuhn’s later notion\nof taxonomic incommensurability (e.g. 1986 [1936], 83). \nAnother major source of Kuhn’s idea of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories is Gestalt psychology (Kuhn 1962, vi). Wolfgang\nKöhler, for example, had emphasized the active role of\norganization in perception and argued that in psychology one begins\nwith Gestalten (organized, segregated wholes such as the\nobjects of human perception or identifiable human behaviours) and then\nproceeds to discover their natural parts (and not vice versa, like in\nparticle physics). In the opening sentences of the condensed English\nversion of Köhler’s investigation of the relationship\nbetween the mental concepts of psychology and the material concepts of\nphysics, Köhler wrote: “In order to orient itself in the\ncompany of natural sciences, psychology must discover connections\nwherever it can between its own phenomena and those of other\ndisciplines. If this search fails, then psychology must recognize that\nits categories and those of natural science are incommensurable”\n(1938 [1920], 17). \nIn a preliminary draft “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\nChapter 1, What are Scientific Revolutions?” (dated 1958-1960,\nlikely composed in late 1958) of the first chapter of his projected\nbook, Kuhn initially used the idea of incommensurability to\ncharacterize stages of development in the arts in contrast to the\ntraditional image of scientific progress as cumulative that he set out\nto challenge (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). Although, this draft\nchapter was entirely rewritten as the introduction of Kuhn (1962), and\nwas explicitly intended only to provoke exploratory discussion and not\nfor publication, it strongly suggests that, at that time, Kuhn began\nto develop the idea of the incommensurability in science in reaction\nto the traditional (e.g. Sarton, Conant) contrast between development\nin the arts and cumulative progress in the sciences (see Pinto de\nOliveira, 2017). In the draft, Kuhn announced his project as an\nattempt to reshape the image of science so as to make it closer to the\nimage of art (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). He wanted to challenge the\ncumulative conception of scientific progress promoted by the old\nhistoriography of science, according to which “science appears\nto advance by accretion” and science is “an ever-growing\nedifice to which each scientist strives to add a few stones or a bit\nof mortar” (Kuhn 1958, 2, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017,\n748) in contrast to the image of art according to which “the\ntransition between one stage of artistic development and the next is a\ntransition between incommensurables” (Kuhn 1958, 3, as cited in\nPinto de Oliveira 2017, 749). \nA few pages later, Kuhn proceeds to apply the idea of\nincommensurability to science for the very first time, again while\ncomparing scientific revolutions to the non-cumulative nature of\nprogress in the arts: “Often a decision to embrace a new theory\nturns out to involve an implicit redefinition of the corresponding\nscience. Old problems may be relegated to another science or may be\ndeclared entirely ‘unscientific’. Problems that, on the old\ntheory, were non-existent or trivial may, with a new theory, become\nthe very archetypes of significant scientific achievement. And, as the\nproblems change, so, often, does the standard that distinguishes a\nreal scientific solution from a mere metaphysical speculation, word\ngame, or mathematical play. It follows that, to a significant extent,\nthe science that emerges from a scientific revolution is not only\nincompatible, but often actually incommensurable, with that which has\ngone before. Only as this is realized, can we grasp the full sense in\nwhich scientific revolutions are like those in the arts” (Kuhn\n1958, 17–18 as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 756). Kuhn\nconcludes that “If we are to preserve any part of the metaphor\nwhich makes inventions and discoveries new bricks for the scientific\nedifice, and if we are simultaneously to give resistance and\ncontroversy an essential place in the development of science, then we\nmay have to recognize that the addition of new bricks demands at least\npartial demolition of the existing structure, and that the new edifice\nerected to include the new brick is not just the old one plus, but a\nnew building. We may, that is, be forced to recognize that new\ndiscoveries and new theories do not simply add to the stock of\npre-existing scientific knowledge. They change it.” (Kuhn 1958,\n7, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 756). \nKuhn continued to struggle with, develop, and then refine his\nunderstanding of incommensurability until his death in 1996. Although\nhis development of incommensurability went through several stages (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1993, 206-222), he claimed to have made a\n“series of significant breakthroughs” beginning in 1987\n(Kuhn 2000 [1993], 228). They are described in a number of essays and\npublished lectures that were collected in (Kuhn 2000, cf. chs. 3, 4,\n5, 10 & 11), and a last as yet unpublished book by Kuhn on\nincommensurability is still pending (Conant and Haugeland 2000, 2).\nThe nature of these developments is controversial. Some commentators\nclaim that Kuhn’s incommensurability thesis underwent a\n‘major transformation’ (Sankey 1993), while others\n(including Kuhn himself) see only a more specific characterization of\nthe original core insight (Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 212; Kuhn 2000,\n[1983], 33ff.; Chen 1997). Kuhn’s original holistic\ncharacterization of incommensurability has been distinguished into two\nseparate theses. ‘Taxonomic incommensurability’ involves\nconceptual change in contrast to ‘methodological\nincommensurability’, which involves the epistemic values used to\nevaluate theories (Sankey 1991; Sankey and Hoyningen-Huene 2001; see\nSection 2.3.2 below). \nKuhn continued to emphasize the difference between normal, cumulative\ngrowth that does not change existing concepts; such as the discovery\nof Boyle’s law, which left the concepts of gas, pressure and\nvolume and the instruments used to measure them unchanged, from\nrevolutionary discoveries that could not have been made on the basis\nof antecedently available concepts; such as the discovery of\nNewton’s theory (Kuhn 2000 [1981], 14). Such developments\nrequire replacing existing concepts with new concepts that\nare incompatible with the older ideas. To help explain the\nnature of this conceptual incompatibility, Kuhn adopted the notion of\na ‘lexical taxonomy’ or ‘lexicon‘ from\nlinguistics (2000 [1989]). A lexical taxonomy stores and structures\nthe vocabulary used to state laws and theories; or more specifically,\nthe kinds of things that they describe. It is the “mental\nmodule” in which members of a speech community store the kind\nterms prerequisite to generalization and description (2000 [1991],\n92–97; 2000 [1993], 229, 233, 238–239, 242, 244). To\ncommunicate, the terms that speakers use do not have to have the same\nmeanings, nor do speakers need to use the same criteria for\nidentifying something as a member of a particular kind (one\nornithologist might identify ducks by their beaks, another by their\ntails) (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 99). Speakers need only share\nhomologous lexical structures; that is, vocabularies incorporating the\nsame system of taxonomic classification. This suffices to ensure that\nthey refer to the same objects with the same kind terms. If two\ntheories do not share the same taxonomic lexical structure, then they\nare incommensurable (2000 [1989], 63; 2000 [1991]; cf. Sankey 1997 and\nWolf 2007). \nTo help explicate incommensurability in terms of taxonomic\nclassification, Kuhn developed the no-overlap principle. The\nno-overlap principle precludes cross-classification of objects into\ndifferent kinds within a theory’s taxonomy. According to the\nno-overlap principle, no two kind terms may overlap in their referents\nunless they are related as species to genus. For example, there are no\ndogs that are also cats; no gold that is also silver, and that is what\nmakes the terms ‘dogs’, ‘cats’,\n‘silver’, and ‘gold’ kind terms (Kuhn 2000\n[1991], 92). Such kind terms are used to state laws and theories and\nmust be learned together through experience (2000 [1993],\n230; cf. Barker et al. 2003, 214 ff.). There are two possibilities.\nMost kind terms must be learned as members of one or another contrast\nset. For example to learn the term ‘liquid’, one must also\nmaster the terms ‘solid’ and ‘gas’. Other\ntypes of kind terms are not learned through contrast sets, but\ntogether with closely related terms through their joint application to\nsituations that exemplify natural laws. For example, the term\n‘force’ must be learned together with terms like\n‘mass’ and ‘weight’ through an application of\nHooke’s law and either Newton’s three laws of motion or\nelse the first and third laws together with the law of gravity (2000\n[1993], 231). According to Kuhn, scientific revolutions change the\nstructural relations between pre-existing kind terms, breaking the\nno-overlap principle (2000 [1991], 92–96]. This is to say that\ntheories separated by a revolution cross-classify the same things into\nmutually exclusive sets of kinds. A kind from one taxonomy is mutually\nexclusive with another if it cannot simply be introduced into it\nbecause the objects to which it refers would be subject to different\nsets of natural laws. This would result in conflicting expectations\nabout the same objects, loss of logical relations between statements\nmade with those concepts, and ultimately incoherence and\nmiscommunication (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 232, 238). For example,\nPtolemy’s theory classifies the sun as a planet, where planets\norbit the earth, while Copernicus’ theory classifies the sun as\na star, where planets orbit stars like the sun. A correct statement\naccording to Copernican theory, such as “Planets orbit the\nsun” is incoherent in Ptolemaic vocabulary (2000 [1991], 94).\nMoreover, the Copernican claim that the planets orbit the sun could\nnot even have been made without abandoning the Ptolemaic concepts and\ndeveloping new ones to replace (and not supplement) them. \nFurthermore, Kuhn (in a move toward Feyerabend’s view) now\nclaims that the same types of difficulties in communication that arise\ndue to incommensurability between members of different scientific\ncommunities separated by the passage of time also occur\nbetween members of different contemporaneous sub-disciplines that\nresult from scientific revolutions (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 238). This\nrepresents a significant change to his original phase-model of\nscientific advance, and a corresponding shift in his application of\nthe notion of incommensurability. Kuhn no longer represents scientific\nadvance as a linear progression from pre-normal science to\nnormal science, through crisis to revolution that results in a new\nphase of normal science. Instead, scientific revolutions are\ncompared to the process of speciation in biology, in that they result\nin branching into sub-disciplines that resemble a\nphylogenetic tree. The application of the relation of\nincommensurability is no longer restricted to diachronic episodes of\nscientific advance in which two theories are separated by a\nrevolution. The contemporaneous sub-disciplines that result from a\nscientific revolution can also be incommensurable with each other. The\nincommensurability derives from different training required to master\nthe incompatible kind terms used to state their laws and theories.\nThese shared kind terms cross-classify the same set of objects into\ndifferent sets of kinds, resulting in mutually exclusive lexical\ntaxonomies that break the no-overlap principle. Moreover, now not only\nare both processes (scientific progress and biological evolution)\nsimilar in that they are not fixed in advance on some set goal (i.e.\ntruth), but driven from behind (i.e. away from anomalies that play an\nanalogous role to selection pressure), but also the incommensurability\nof scientific theories is presented as analogous to the isolating\nmechanisms required for speciation (Kuhn 2000 [1991],\n94–99). \nKuhn compared the function of such lexical taxonomies to Kant’s\na priori when taken in a relativized sense. Each lexicon\nmakes a corresponding form of life possible within which the truth or\nfalsity of propositions may be both claimed and rationally justified.\nFor example, with the Aristotelian lexicon, one can speak of the truth\nor falsity of Aristotelian assertions, but these truth values have no\nbearing on the truth of apparently similar assertions made with the\nNewtonian lexicon (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 244). A lexicon is thus\nconstitutive of the objects of knowledge (Kuhn 2000 [1993],\n245); and consequently, Kuhn rejected characterizations of scientific\nprogress according to which science zeros in on the truth:\n“no shared metric is available to compare our\nassertions … and thus to provide a basis for a claim that our\n(or, for that matter, his) are closer to the truth” (2000\n[1993], 244). Instead, the logical status of a lexical structure, like\nthat of word-meanings in general, is that of convention, and the\njustification of a lexicon or of lexical change can only be pragmatic\n(2000 [1993], 244). Kuhn thus reaffirmed his earlier claim that the\nnotion of a match or correspondence between the ontology of a theory\nand its real counterpart in nature is illusive in principle (1970,\n206; 2000 [1993], 244). The implications that incommensurability has\nfor scientific realism have been widely discussed and continue to be\ncontroversial (cf. Devitt 2001, Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene 1997,\nSankey 2009). \nA lexicon is not only prerequisite to making meaningful statements, it\nalso sets limits on what can be meaningfully said within the community\nof speakers that share it: “There is, for example, no way, even\nin an enriched Newtonian vocabulary, to convey the Aristotelian\npropositions regularly misconstrued as asserting the proportionality\nof force and motion or the impossibility of a void. Using our\nconceptual lexicon, these Aristotelian propositions cannot be\nexpressed — they are simply ineffable — and we are barred\nby the no-overlap principle from access to the concepts required to\nexpress them ” (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 244; cf. 2000 [1989], 76). In\nthis way, Kuhn’s later notion of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories is based on effability. The structure of\nthe lexicon shared by a particular community determines how the world\ncan be described by its members, as well as how they will\nmisunderstand the history of their own discipline; that is, unless\nthey learn to understand older terms according to the structure of the\nolder lexicon. Where Kuhn had earlier likened the process by which\nhistorians come to understand antiquated science as a special type of\ntranslation, he retracted these claims, insisting that the process is\none of language learning, not translation (2000 [1993], 238, 244).\nKuhn often claimed that incommensurable theories are untranslatable\n(e.g. Kuhn 2000 [1991], 94). However, he also emphasized that\ntranslation is neither needed in the comparison of incommensurable\ntheories, nor in the hermeneutic historical method necessary to\nunderstand antiquated sciences (Kuhn 2000 [1993], 237, 238, 244). To\novercome the barriers posed by incommensurability to understanding\nantiquated sciences, and to understanding the special technical\nvocabulary used by contemporaneous, phylogenetically related\nsub-disciplines, it is neither necessary not possible to translate\nbetween them. Rather, one must become bilingual, learning to\nuse (and keep separate) the incongruently structured lexical\ntaxonomies underwriting different laws and theories. \nAs Kuhn refined his notion of incommensurability as a special type of\nconceptual incompatibility, some commentators began to distinguish it\nfrom ‘methodological incommensurability’. Methodological\nincommensurability is the idea that there are no shared, objective\nstandards of scientific theory appraisal, so that there are no\nexternal or neutral standards that univocally determine the\ncomparative evaluation of competing theories (Sankey and\nHoyningen-Huene 2001, xiii). This idea has also been recently\ndiscussed in detail under the rubric\n“Kuhn-underdetermination” (Carrier 2008, 278). The basic\nidea was developed out of Kuhn and Feyerabend’s rejections of\nthe traditional view that a distinguishing feature of science is a\nuniform, invariant scientific method, that remains fixed throughout\nits development (Kuhn 1962, 94, 103; Feyerabend 1975, 23–32; cf.\nFarrell 2003). Feyerabend famously argued that every proposed\nmethodological rule has been fruitfully violated at some point in the\ncourse of scientific advance, and that only by breaking such rules\ncould scientists have made the progressive steps for which they are\npraised (1975). He concluded that the idea of a fixed, historically\ninvariant scientific method is a myth. There are no universally\napplicable methodological rules. The only methodological rule that is\nuniversally applicable is ‘anything goes’, which buys its\nuniversality at the cost of being completely empty (1970a, 105). Kuhn\nchallenged the traditional view of scientific method as a set of\nrules, claiming that the standards of theory appraisal, such as\nsimplicity, accuracy, consistency, scope and fruitfulness (1977, 322),\ndepend on and vary with the currently dominant paradigm. He is often\ncited for having pointed out that as in political revolutions, so in\nchoice of paradigm, there is no standard higher than the assent of the\nrelevant community (1962, 94), and as having argued that there is\n“no neutral algorithm for theory choice, no systematic decision\nprocedure which, properly applied, must lead each individual in the\ngroup to the same decision” (1970, 200). Kuhn developed the idea\nthat such epistemic standards do not function as rules that determine\nrational theory choice, but as values that merely guide it (1977,\n331). Different scientists apply these values differently, and they\nmay even pull in different directions, so that there may be rational\ndisagreement between scientists from incommensurable paradigms, who\nsupport different theories due to their weighing the same values\ndifferently. \nAn examination of Feyerabend’s use and development of the idea\nof incommensurability of scientific theories reveals just how\nwidespread it was prior to 1962. It also reveals the veiled common\ncore of Feyerabend’s philosophy of science, which otherwise\nappears to be a series of critical papers on unrelated topics\n(Oberheim 2005, 2006). That common core is the use of the idea of\nincommensurability to challenge many different forms of conceptual\nconservativism in science and philosophy. Conceptual conservativism\nunjustly favors existing ideas over potential improvements offered by\nincommensurable alternatives. Feyerabend used the notion of\nincommensurability to attack the following forms of conceptual\nconservativism: Heisenberg’s idea of closed theories (1951),\nattempts to distinguish philosophical accounts of ontology from\nphysics (1954), the foundational role of the stability thesis in\nlogical positivism (1951, 1958a), Bohr’s principle of\ncomplementarity (1958b, 1961, 1962, 1965b, 1970a), and the logical\nempiricists’ models of explanation and reduction (1962, 1963a).\nHe also used the idea of incommensurability to attack forms of\nconceptual conservativism implicit in the models of theory testing\npromoted by classical empiricists, the logical positivists, the\nlogical empiricists, Popper, and Kuhn (1958a, 1962, 1963a, 1965b,\n1970a), Kantian transcendental necessities (1962, 1965b, 1965c),\ntraditional philosophical conundrums like the problem of the existence\nof the external world, the problem of the existence of other minds,\nand especially the mind-body problem (1962, 1965b, 1967, 1969a),\ncertain aspects of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy, as well as\nthe linguistic philosophical movement that takes the utility of\neveryday concepts as given and merely attempts to analyze them,\nwithout changing their meanings (or ‘arguments from\nsynonymy’) (1962, 1963a, 1965b, 1969b, 1970a), Popper’s\nconception of verisimilitude (1970b), and scientific realist\ncharacterizations of scientific knowledge and scientific advance\n(1970b). Feyerabend argued that all of these views cannot accommodate\nthe fact that the history of science reveals revolutionary\ndevelopments in which incommensurable alternatives replaced existing\nideas in the course of progress. \nIn his landmark 1962 “Explanation, Reduction and\nEmpiricism”, Paul Feyerabend initially introduced the term\n‘incommensurable’ as part of a criticism of the\nconceptual conservativism that he found in Nagel’s\ntheory of reduction and the Hempel-Oppenheim theory of explanation. He\nargued that formal accounts of reduction and explanation are\nimpossible for general theories because they cannot accommodate the\ndevelopment of incommensurable concepts in the course of scientific\nadvance. Feyerabend used the notion of incommensurability to\ncharacterize the relation between two successive fundamental,\nuniversal scientific theories interpreted realistically; i.e. as\npurported descriptions of reality. By limiting incommensurability to\nuniversal theories, Feyerabend meant only those that apply to all\nobjects in the universe. By limiting incommensurability to fundamental\ntheories, Feyerabend meant those that have ontological implications;\ni.e., those that have implications about the very nature of reality.\nUniversal, fundamental scientific theories can be incommensurable only\nif they are interpreted realistically, according to Feyerabend,\nbecause otherwise they cannot compete as the one true theory, and are\nthus not mutually exclusive. By calling two such theories\nincommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they were conceptually\nincompatible: The main concepts of one could neither be defined on the\nbasis of the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor related to\nthem via a correct empirical statement (1962, 74, 90). As a\nconsequence, it is impossible to reduce incommensurable theories\nformally. \nIn 1962, Feyerabend illustrated the incommensurability of scientific\ntheories with a comparison of six pairs of central concepts drawn from\nthree episodes of fundamental theory change in the course of\nscientific advance: (1) The dynamical characterization of impetus in\nthe impetus theory of motion and the concept of force in the\nconceptual apparatus of Newtonian mechanics, (2 & 3) the concepts\nof temperature and entropy in the transition from phenomenological\nthermodynamics to kinetic theory, and (4, 5 & 6) the concepts\nmass, length and time in the transition from Newtonian to relativistic\nmechanics. Feyerabend subsequently added the example of geometrical\noptics and wave optics (1965b, 227). In 1962, Feyerabend also claimed\nthat incommensurability occurs between traditional, fundamental\ntheories in philosophy, and consequently arises in the discussions of\nthe mind-body problem, the problem of the reality of the external\nworld, and the problem of other minds (1962, 31, 90). Feyerabend\nargued that such age-old philosophical problems have not been solved\nbecause the disputants resist the kind of meaning change necessary for\ntheir dissolution. Concepts are incommensurable, according to\nFeyerabend, because they belong to mutually exclusive theoretical\nperspectives. These perspectives are mutually exclusive because they\ngive incompatible accounts of the nature of reality. Feyerabend argued\nthat because the meanings of their terms are provided by the theories\nto which they belong, when there is theoretical change, there are\nmeaning changes (1962, 68, 94). Feyerabend argued that these changes\nin meaning affect our theoretical and observational terms, as well as\nour conception of the nature of reality. When this occurs, there is\nincommensurability; or as Feyerabend later characterized his view:\n“a theory is incommensurable with another if its ontological\nconsequences are incompatible with the ontological consequences of the\nlatter” (1981a, xi). The idea is intended to capture conceptual\nincompatibility due to changes of meaning that occur in theoretical\ntransitions that affect our ontological beliefs. Two fundamental\ntheories are incommensurable because the meanings of their terms are\ndetermined by the theoretical principles that govern their use, and\nthese principles are qualitatively incompatible (1962, 58). \nFeyerabend used the idea of incommensurability to attempt to expose a\ndogmatic element that contemporary empiricists share with school\nphilosophies such as Platonism and Cartesianism (from whom empiricists\nhad tried to distance themselves by insisting on an empirical\nfoundation for scientific knowledge). The dogmatic element is due to\nthe assumption that the meanings of empirical terms remain stable\nthrough theoretical transitions; or what Feyerabend called the\nprinciple of meaning invariance (1962, 30). Feyerabend argued that\nthis principle is inconsistent with the existence of incommensurable\nconcepts. Feyerabend drew two main consequences from the insight that\nsome pairs of successive scientific theories are incommensurable.\nFirst, successive scientific theories that are incommensurable have no\nlogical relations: “The order introduced into our experiences by\nNewton’s theory is retained and improved by relativity. This\nmeans that the concepts of relativity theory are sufficiently rich to\nallow us to state all the facts which were stated before with the help\nof Newtonian physics. Yet these two sets of categories are completely\ndifferent and bear no logical relation to each other”\n(1962, 88–89). Because their concepts have different meanings,\nthey cannot be brought into formal logical relations. Second, a\nrevision in the logical empiricist conception of scientific advance is\nrequired. Older theories, and the concepts used to state them, are not\ncorrected and absorbed, and thereby legitimised. Rather, they are\nrejected and replaced, having been falsified. In this way, the logical\nempiricists’ conceptually conservative (or retentive) accounts\nof reduction and explanation are undermined. They cannot accommodate\nthe development of incommensurable concepts in the course of\nscientific advance. \nIn 1965, Feyerabend attempted to clarify his notion, claiming that two\ntheories are incommensurable when the meanings of their main\ndescriptive terms depend on mutually inconsistent principles (1965c,\n227; 1975, 269–270, 276). He also claimed that two theories are\nincommensurable if a new theory entails that all the concepts of the\npreceding theory have zero extension or if it introduces rules that\nchange the system of classes itself (1965a, 268). On this account, in\norder for there to be incommensurability, the “situation must be\nrigged in such a way that the conditions of concept formation in one\ntheory forbid the formation of the basic concepts of the other”\n(Feyerabend 1978, 68; cf. 1975, 269; 1981b, 154). Still later, he\nclaimed that with the term “incommensurability” he always\nmeant “deductive disjointedness, and nothing else” (1977,\n365). These subsequent formulations were all intended to capture the\nsame idea. \nAlthough Feyerabend first used the term ‘incommensurable’\nto describe successive scientific theories in 1962, he had been\ndeveloping his conception of incommensurability for about a decade\nprior to meeting Kuhn in the late 1950s. According to Feyerabend, he\nfirst discussed his notion of incommensurable concepts with the Kraft\nCircle from 1949–1951, while working toward his doctoral thesis\non protocol statements (Feyerabend 1951). The Kraft Circle was a\nstudent group named after Feyerabend’s Ph.D. supervisor Viktor\nKraft, which was modeled after the Vienna Circle of which Kraft had\nbeen a member. Prominent guests such as Elizabeth Anscombe and Ludwig\nWittgenstein attended some meetings (Feyerabend 1978, 108ff.,\n115–116; 1993, 259–260; 1995, 92). Feyerabend traced the\norigins of his conception of incommensurability to those ideas as\nrepresented by ‘thesis I’ in “An attempt at a\nrealistic interpretation of experience” (1958a), which is a\ncondensed version of his 1951 doctoral thesis. \nIn his (1958a), Feyerabend criticized two conceptions of meaning. He\nargued against the logical positivist idea that the meaning of an\nobservational term is determined by immediate experiences, as well as\nagainst the Wittgensteinian idea that the meaning of an observational\nterm is determined by its use. Instead, Feyerabend argued that the\nmeaning of a term, even an observation term, is determined by its\ntheoretical context, or more precisely, by the theoretical principles\nthat govern its correct use according to our best theories. For\nexample, according to Feyerabend, the correct meaning of the term\n‘temperature’ is not determined by its everyday use, but\nby the principles of statistical thermodynamics. On the basis of such\na conception, Feyerabend developed ‘thesis I’, according\nto which the interpretation of an observation language is determined\nby the theories that we use to explain what we observe, and it changes\nas soon as those theories change (1958a, 163). Feyerabend proceeded to\nargue that when older theories are replaced, the meanings of the\nobservational terms used to test those theories change. Just as in\n(1962), the result is incommensurability: The idea that successive\nscientific theories are conceptually incompatible and consequently\nlogically disjoint due to differences in the meanings of the\nobservation statements used to test them. Feyerabend’s\n‘thesis I’ is thus an early version of his\nincommensurability thesis. In his (1958a), with this notion of\nincommensurability, Feyerabend challenged an implicit conceptual\nconservativism in logical positivism: The assumptions that theoretical\nterms derive their meaning solely through their connection with\nexperience and that experience itself is a stable (or unchanging)\nfoundation on which theoretical meaning can be based. Instead of such\na bottom-up version of the relation of experience and theoretical\nknowledge, according to which experience determines the meanings of\nour theoretical terms, Feyerabend argued for a top-down version,\naccording to which our best theories determine the meanings that we\nattach to our experiences. According to Feyerabend, experience cannot\nbe taken for granted as some kind of fixed, neutral basis for\ncomparing theories. Rather, it takes on its particular character in\nlight of the theories we bring to it.  \nAt the time Feyerabend was developing these views, he was working very\nclosely with Karl Popper. There has been much controversy concerning\nFeyerabend’s evolving relationship to Popper, especially given\nits tumultuous trajectory, the revisions Feyerabend made concerning\nhis debts to Popper in the reprints of his original papers (see\nPreston 1997), informal accusations of plagiarism by Popperians (see\nCollodel 2016), and Feyerabend’s subsequent increasingly vocal\ndenials of his debts to Popper (Oberheim 2006, Ch. 3.4). It has\nhowever always been clear that Feyerabend developed his views on\nincommensurability while working as a vocal proponent of Karl\nPopper’s critical rationalist philosophy (Preston 1997, Oberheim\n2006, Collodel 2016), and that there are many different\ninterpretations of the relationships between their ideas. Bschir\n(2015) recently emphasizes just how Popperian Feyerabend’s\nphilosophy was at that time, and casts Feyerabend’s idea of\nincommensurability as a positive extension of many of Popper’s\nviews. Oberheim (2006) argues that incommensurability is exactly the\npoint at which Feyerabend breaks the Popperian framework. Many\n(including Popper) seem to interpret Feyerabend’s conception of\nincommensurability as a rather misguided development (or even\nmisunderstanding) of Karl Popper’s views (see Bschir 2015,\nCollodel 2016), which Feyerabend often repeated, sometimes seemingly\nas if they were his own. In any case, incommensurability marks the\npoint after which Feyerabend and Popper’s philosophies\ndramatically part ways, as they lead to very different conceptions of\nprogress (see Tambolo 2017).  \nFeyerabend’s route to the idea of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories was heavily influenced by a number of prominent\nindividuals who had been discussing a wide range of related topics. An\ninvestigation of the source of these ideas reveals some of the\nfounding fathers of the notion of incommensurability in the\ncontemporary history and philosophy of science. \nFeyerabend drew heavily from Duhem’s The Aim and Structure\nof Physical Theory (1954 [1906]) in his development of the notion\nof incommensurability of scientific theories. Many of the main points\nFeyerabend emphasized by calling scientific theories incommensurable\nhad been developed already by Duhem, who had argued that logic is\ninsufficient for determining the outcome of theoretical disputes in\nthe natural sciences, and who documented the difficulties historians\nhave in understanding the development of the natural sciences due to\nmeaning change. Duhem also already highlighted the communication\ndifficulties between proponents of competing scientific theories\nbecause of these differences in meaning. For example, Duhem had\nclaimed that what a physicist states as the result of an experiment is\nnot simply the recital of some observed facts. Rather, it is the\ninterpretation of these facts on the basis of the theories the\nscientist regards as true (1954 [1906], 159). It follows, according to\nDuhem, that in order to understand the meanings that scientists\nascribe to their own statements, it is necessary to understand the\ntheories that they use in order to interpret what they observe. Thus,\nDuhem had stated an early version of Feyerabend’s\nincommensurability thesis. Moreover, Duhem explicitly limited his\ndiscussion to non-instantial, physical theories, as opposed to mere\nexperimental laws. This is very similar to the criteria that marks the\nmost significant difference between Kuhn and Feyerabend’s\ndevelopment of the idea of incommensurability (see Section 4), and\nthat also delimits Einstein’s use of\n‘incommensurable’ while discussing the problems of theory\ncomparison (see Section 3.2.3). \nAfter explaining that the meaning of a term depends on the theory to\nwhich it belongs, and that a consequence of theoretical advance is\nmeaning change, Duhem continued: “If the theories admitted by\nthis physicist are those we accept, and if we agree to follow the same\nrules in the interpretation of the same phenomena, we speak the same\nlanguage and can understand each other. But that is not always the\ncase. It is not so when we discuss the experiments of a physicist who\ndoes not belong to our school; and it is especially not so when we\ndiscuss the experiments of a physicist separated from us by fifty\nyears, a century, or two centuries” (1954 [1906], 159). Duhem\ncontinued: “How many scientific discussions there are in which\neach of the contenders claims to have crushed his adversary under the\noverwhelming testimony of the facts! … How many propositions\nare regarded as monstrous errors in the writings of those who have\npreceded us! We should perhaps commemorate them as great truths if we\nreally wished to enquire into the theories which gave their\npropositions their true meaning” (Duhem 1954 [1906],\n160–161). These passages make the same basic points that both\nFeyerabend and Kuhn made with their claims about incommensurability of\nscientific theories: Because older ideas are misunderstood, as a\nresult of taking them out of their theoretical context, proponents of\nincommensurable scientific theories misunderstand each other, both\nclaiming to have the facts on their side. Kuhn and Feyerabend both\nclaimed that in such a situation, even empirical arguments can become\ncircular (Feyerabend 1965b, 152; Kuhn 1962, 94). \nIn his autobiography, Feyerabend acknowledged Niels Bohr’s\ndirect influence on the development of his notion of\nincommensurability in the 1950s. Feyerabend recalled a conversation in\nwhich Bohr had talked about the discovery that the square root of two\ncannot be an integer or a fraction. According to Feyerabend, Bohr\npresented the event as having led to the extension of a concept of\nnumber that retained some properties of integers and fractions, but\nchanged others; and claimed that the transition from classical to\nquantum mechanics was carried out in accordance with precisely this\nprinciple (1995, 78). Feyerabend also used the notion of\nincommensurability in a publication on Bohr’s complementarity\nthesis, where Feyerabend argued that Bohr’s complementarity\nthesis is an example of an unjustified conceptual conservativism,\ntaking issue with Bohr’s contention that all quantum mechanical\nevidence will always necessarily be expressed in classical terms\n(Feyerabend 1958b). He presented Bohr’s defence of the principle\nof complementarity as based on the conviction that every experience\nmust necessarily make its appearance within the frame of our customary\npoints of view, which is currently that of classical physics. However,\naccording to Feyerabend, even though classical concepts have been\nsuccessful in the past, and even though at the moment it may be\ndifficult, or even impossible, for us to imagine how to replace them,\nit does not follow that the classical framework could not one day be\nsuperseded by an incommensurable rival. Consequently, it does not\nfollow that all our future microscopic theories will have to take the\nnotion of complementarity as fundamental. Instead, according to\nFeyerabend, a theory may be found whose conceptual apparatus, when\napplied to the domain of validity of classical physics, would be just\nas comprehensive and useful as the classical apparatus, without\ncoinciding with it. He claimed that such a situation is by no means\nuncommon, and he used the transition from Newtonian to relativistic\nphysics to bolster his point. According to Feyerabend, while the\nconcepts of relativity theory are sufficiently rich to state all of\nthe facts captured by Newtonian physics, the two sets of concepts are\n“completely different” and bear “no logical\nrelations” to each other (1958b, 83; 1961, 388; 1962,\n88–89). This is clearly an early version of his\nincommensurability thesis. On Feyerabend’s fallibilist view of\nempirical knowledge, no element of our knowledge can be held to be\nnecessary or absolutely certain. In our search for satisfactory\nexplanations, we are at liberty to change any parts of our existing\nknowledge, however fundamental they may seem, including the concepts\nof classical physics. \nAlbert Einstein used the term ‘incommensurable’ to apply\nspecifically to difficulties selecting and evaluating scientific\ntheories before Kuhn and Feyerabend, and there are strong reasons to\nbelieve that Feyerabend’s development of incommensurability was\ndirectly inspired by Einstein’s use of the term (Oberheim 2016).\nIn his ‘Autobiographical notes’ (1949), Einstein attempted\nto explain that assessing the relative merits of universal physical\ntheories involves making difficult judgments about their\n‘naturalness’ that requires making judgments based on the\nreciprocal weighing of incommensurable qualities: “The second\npoint of view is not concerned with the relation to the material\nobservation but with the premises of the theory itself, with what may\nbriefly but vaguely be characterized as the ‘naturalness’\nor ‘logical simplicity’ of the premises (of the basic\nconcepts and of the relations between these which are taken as a\nbasis). This point of view, an exact formulation of which meets with\ngreat difficulties, has played an important role in the selection and\nevaluation of theories since time immemorial. The problem here is not\nsimply one of a kind of enumeration of the logically independent\npremises (if anything like this were at all unequivocally possible),\nbut that of a kind of reciprocal weighing of incommensurable\nqualities” (1949a, 23). \nThere are good reasons to believe that these admittedly cryptic\nremarks directly inspired Feyerabend’s use and development of\nthe idea of incommensurability. Although Feyerabend did not cite from\nEinstein (1949) in his (1962), he does cite from Bohr’s paper in\nthat very same edited volume (Schilpp 1949). Moreover, there are\nstriking similarities between Feyerabend and Einstein’s uses of\nthe term. First, both make a distinction between universal theories\nand theories that do not apply to the totality of all physical\nappearances, and then use this distinction to limit the application of\nincommensurability in the same way; i.e., the problem of weighing\nincommensurable qualities in selecting and evaluating theories is\nexplicitly only meant to apply to such universal physical\ntheories, and not just any pair of scientific theories (cf. Feyerabend\n1962a, 28 and Einstein 1949a, 23). Second, Einstein’s\ntheoretical attitude is explicitly a form of neo-Kantianism very much\nlike that of Feyerabend and Kuhn’s. According to Einstein, his\ntheoretical attitude “is distinct from that of Kant only by the\nfact that we do not conceive of the ‘categories’ as\nunalterable (conditioned by the nature of the understanding) but as\n(in the logical sense) free conventions. They appear to be a\npriori only insofar as thinking without the positing of\ncategories and of concepts in general would be as impossible as is\nbreathing in a vacuum” (Einstein 1949b, 374). This is the same\nbasic perspective that both Kuhn and Feyerabend delineated when they\ndeveloped their ideas of incommensurability. For example, Kuhn says,\n“I go around explaining my own position saying I am a Kantian\nwith moveable categories” (Kuhn 2000 [1995], 264), an idea\ndeveloped in detail by Hoyningen-Huene (1993). As for Feyerabend, he\nset out such a ‘Kant on wheels’ approach – to use\nPeter Lipton’s apt expression (Lipton 2001) – at the\nbeginning of ‘Explanation, Reduction and Empiricism’\n(1962a). Feyerabend overtly adopted such a neo-Kantian metaphysical\nperspective with changing categories in order to pursue the question:\nIf universal theories determine all of our experiences of the world,\nhow can experience be used to test such theories? Third, the main\nexample Feyerabend used to illustrate that and how incommensurable\ntheories can indeed be compared on the basis of a ‘crucial\nexperiment’ was Einstein’s quantitative prediction, and\nPerrin’s subsequent confirmation, of Brownian motion, which\nserved as a crucial experiment between classical and statistical\nthermodynamics – one of only three examples of incommensurable\nscientific theories in Feyerabend (1962a) (cf. Oberheim 2006, 253ff.;\nSirtes and Oberheim 2006). Feyerabend argued that although Brownian\nmotion was already a well-known phenomenon, it became\nevidence for statistical thermodynamics and against classical\nthermodynamics only after the development of the kinetic\ntheory, which was needed to interpret it as such. Even though there\nwas a crucial experiment between these two universal theories, the\ntheories have no common measure as the observations of\nBrownian motion that confirmed statistical thermodynamics were not\ncouched in a neutral observation language. The observations\nonly became evidence after they were interpreted according to\nstatistical theory. Einstein discussed exactly this episode at length\nin his ‘Autobiographical notes’, where he used the term\n‘incommensurable’ to apply to difficulties in judging the\nmerits of universal physical theories. Fourth, later Feyerabend often\ndefended his view that there is no fixed scientific method\n(e.g. 1975, 10–11) by citing Einstein: “The external\nconditions which are set for [the scientist] by the facts of\nexperience do not permit him to let himself be too much restricted, in\nthe construction of his conceptual world, by the adherence to an\nepistemological system. He therefore must appear to the systematic\nepistemologist as a type of unscrupulous opportunist”\n(Einstein1949b, 683ff.). Although Feyerabend’s development of\nthe idea of incommensurability of scientific theories was received by\nthe philosophic and scientific communities as propagating radical,\nirrationalist ideas about science, he was actually trying to develop\nsomething he found in Einstein. In the preface to the German version\nof Against Method, Feyerabend wrote, “I want to\nemphasize yet again that the views in this book are not new –\nfor physicist like Mach, Boltzmann, Einstein and Bohr they were a\ntriviality. But the ideas of these great thinkers have been distorted\n[by positivist philosophers] beyond recognition” (1983, 12, our\ntranslation). \nFeyerabend, like Kuhn, explicitly drew from Wolfgang\nKöhler’s work in Gestalt psychology in the development of\nhis notion of incommensurability. Moreover, Köhler had already\napplied the notion of incommensurability to scientific theories (see\nSection 2.2.2). Köhler’s use applies to different areas\nwithin natural science, not to successive scientific theories such as\nin early Kuhn (1962). Köhler’s use of the term\n‘incommensurable’ to describe the relationship between the\nconcepts of psychology and physics was a main source of\nFeyerabend’s development of the idea of the incommensurability\n(Oberheim 2005). Feyerabend’s discussion of incommensurability\nin the formulation of the mind-body problem derives directly from\nKöhler’s claims (Oberheim 2005). However,\nFeyerabend’s (Wittgensteinian) strategy for overcoming the\nincommensurability in the dissolution of philosophical conundrums is\nnot Köhler’s (Oberheim 2006, 43–45). Feyerabend\nsuggested that the insolubility is due to the unwillingness of\nphilosophers of different persuasions to change the deeply entrenched\nmeanings of their terms, and that in this case, the mental should be\nreinterpreted so that it is compatible with materialism (Feyerabend\n1963b). \nWhile Feyerabend’s notion of the incommensurability did not\nsignificantly change throughout his early writings in the philosophy\nof science, in his later more general philosophy, Feyerabend extended\nthe application of the term beyond universal scientific theories. For\nexample, he used it to characterize the transition from the Greek\narchaic, aggregate worldview of Homer to the substance world-view of\nthe Pre-Socratics (1975, 261-269), and thereafter in a very broad\nsense, discussing incommensurable frameworks of thought and action\n(1975, 271), incommensurability in the domain of perceptions (1975,\n225, 271), incommensurable discoveries and attitudes (1975, 269) and\nincommensurable paradigms (1981b [1970], 131–161), where such\nincommensurability involves the suspension of some of the universal\nprinciples of the received view. Feyerabend characterized this wider\nnotion of incommensurability as a historical, anthropological thesis\n(1975, 271), but also applied it to different stages of the\ndevelopment of thought and perception in the individual (1975, 274).\nHe also further developed his notion of incommensurability, claiming\nthat it involves major conceptual changes of both ‘overt’\nand ‘covert classifications’ (in Whorff’s sense), so\nthat incommensurability is difficult to explicitly define, and can\nonly be shown (1975, 224–225). Still later, Feyerabend argued\nthat ‘potentially every culture is all cultures’,\napparently retracting a wider, cultural notion of incommensurability\n(Feyerabend 1994). \nInitially, Feyerabend had a more concrete characterization of the\nnature and origins of incommensurability than Kuhn. On\nFeyerabend’s view, because the nature of objects depends on the\nmost advanced theories about them, and because the meaning of\nobservation statements depends on the nature of those objects, the\ninterpretation of an observation language is determined by the\ntheories we use to explain what we observe. Kuhn, by contrast, was\ninitially much less sure about the exact meaning of his notion of\nincommensurability, especially regarding world change, which he saw as\nthe most fundamental aspect of incommensurability. Kuhn frankly\nconfessed to have been at a loss: “In a sense that I am unable\nto explicate further, the proponents of competing paradigms practice\ntheir trades in different worlds” (1962, 150). He suggested that\n“we must learn to make sense of statements that at least\nresemble these” (1962, 121), and then spent a great deal of\neffort attempting to do so. \nFurthermore, Feyerabend’s concept of incommensurability of\nscientific theories was much more restricted than Kuhn’s. For\nKuhn, incommensurability had three prima facie heterogeneous\ndomains, holistically bound: a change of problems and standards, a\nchange of concepts used to state and solve them, and a change of\nworld-view in which they arise. Feyerabend’s focus, on the other\nhand, was initially exclusively on concepts occurring in universal or\nfundamental theories, together with their ontological implications.\nIronically, however, in developments after 1962, both authors move in\nopposite directions. Kuhn gradually eliminated everything from his\nnotion of incommensurability that does not concern scientific\nconcepts, and ended more or less where Feyerabend began (see Carrier\n2001; Chen 1997; Hoyningen-Huene 1990, 487-488; Hoyningen-Huene 1993,\n212-218; Hoyningen-Huene 2004, Sankey 1993; Sankey 1994, 16-30; Sankey\n1997). Feyerabend, by contrast, increasingly emphasized aspects of\nperceptual change (1975, 225–229, 273–274; 1978, 68; 1988,\n172–176), and also changes to the set of legitimate problems a\ndiscipline should handle (1975, 274–275), and his later\nphilosophy emphasizes one of Kuhn’s original points; the role of\nnon-binding, epistemic values in theory choice (cf. Farrell 2003). \nWith respect to the range of theories that are subject to\nincommensurability, Feyerabend’s concept is again much more\nrestricted than Kuhn’s. For Feyerabend, only universal,\nfundamental, non-instantial theories that are\ninterpreted realistically can be incommensurable (Feyerabend\n1962, 44; 1965b, 216; 1975, 114, 271, 284; 1975, 221–222; 1987,\n272). Feyerabend was interested in fundamental, universal theories\nthat apply to everything, because he believed that only “such\ncomprehensive structures of thought” have ontological\nimplications that are capable of sustaining entire worldviews\n(Feyerabend 1962, 28; cf. Feyerabend 1954 and Oberheim 2006, 157ff.).\nHe restricted incommensurability to non-instantial theories, which he\ndistinguished from empirical generalizations, on the basis of the\ndifferences in their test procedures. Generalizations of the form\n‘All As are Bs’ (regardless of whether the\nAs or Bs are observable) are tested by inspecting\ninstances. So for example, Kepler’s first law makes claims about\nthe planets, which can be tested directly by inspecting their motion.\nIn order to test non-instantial theories, such as Newton’s\ntheory of gravitation, first empirical generalizations must be derived\nfrom them with the help of auxiliary hypothesis, and only thereafter\ncan they be tested by inspection (Feyerabend 1962, 28). Due to these\nrestrictions (only universal, fundamental, non-instantial theories),\nfor Feyerabend, incommensurability of scientific theories occurs\ncomparatively rarely (1987, 272). Kuhn included a wider range of\ntheories as candidates for incommensurability. For him, even smaller\nepisodes, like unexpected discoveries, might be incommensurable with\nthe earlier tradition (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 197-201). This\ndifference in the range of incommensurability between Kuhn and\nFeyerabend’s versions finds its most striking expression in the\nway they regard the transition from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican\ntheory. For Kuhn, the differences between these two theories comprise\nan exemplary illustration of incommensurability. For Feyerabend,\nhowever, because planetary theory lacks the quality of universality,\nthere is no incommensurability (1975, 114). Furthermore, in his later\nwritings Kuhn insisted that the version of incommensurability he\nchampioned had always been “local incommensurability,” a\nnotion that restricts conceptual change to a few, typically\ninterconnected concepts (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 213, 219). Thus,\nthere may be empirical consequences of incommensurable theory pairs\nthat can be immediately compared. For instance, the geocentric and\nheliocentric planetary theories are incommensurable in Kuhn’s\nsense, while predictions of the planetary positions of both theories\nare fully commensurable, and can be immediately compared regarding\ntheir empirical accuracy. By contrast, Feyerabend always thought of\nhis concept more globally, as affecting all statements\nderivable from two fundamental theories (1962, 93; 1965c, 117; 1965b,\n216; 1975, 275–276; 1981a, xi).  \nBoth Kuhn and Feyerabend have often been misread as advancing the view\nthat incommensurability implies incomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene\n1993, 218ff.; Oberheim 2006, 235). In response to this misreading,\nKuhn repeatedly emphasized that incommensurability does not imply\nincomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 236ff.). Theory comparison\nis merely more complicated than imagined by some philosophers of\nscience. In particular, it cannot fully be made\n‘point-by-point’. It is not an algorithmic procedure (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1993, 147-154; Feyerabend 1975, 114; 1981a, 238), nor\none that requires translation into a neutral observation language.\nDifferent epistemic values, such as universality, accuracy,\nsimplicity, fruitfulness may pull in different directions (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1992, 492–496; 1993, 150–154; Feyerabend\n1981a, 16; 1981c, 238) allowing for the possibility of rational\ndisagreement. But even if a full point-by-point comparison of\nincommensurable theories is impossible, and even if theory comparison\ndoes not have the status of a proof, a comparative evaluation of\nincommensurable theories is still possible (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993,\n236-258; Carrier 2001) and rational in a means/ends or instrumental\nsense. For example, according to Kuhn it is rational to choose\ntheories that are better problem-solvers because they better serve the\nends of science. This property of theory choice makes the overall\nprocess of science both rational and progressive. With the notion of\nincommensurability, Kuhn was not so much challenging the rationality\nof theory choice, as trying to make room for the possibility of\nrational disagreement between proponents of competing paradigms. In\nfact, according to Kuhn, “incommensurability is far from being\nthe threat to rational evaluation of truth claims that it has\nfrequently seemed. Rather, it’s what is needed, within a\ndevelopmental perspective, to restore some badly needed bite to the\nwhole notion of cognitive evaluation. It is needed, that is, to defend\nnotions like truth and knowledge from, for example, the excesses of\npost-modernist movements like the strong program” (2000 [1991],\n91). \nThe extent of the misreading of incommensurability as implying\nincomparability is even more dramatic in Feyerabend’s case. A\nfar cry from claiming that incommensurable theories cannot be\ncompared, Feyerabend explicitly and repeatedly argued that\nincommensurable alternatives actually offer a better means of\ncomparing the merits of theories than the mere development of\ncommensurable alternatives (Feyerabend 1962, 66; cf. Oberheim 2006,\n235ff.). He illustrated this point with an example of a crucial\nexperiment between incommensurable theories. He argued that even\nthough the central concepts of statistical and classical\nphenomenological thermodynamics are incommensurable, it was still\npossible indirectly to stage a crucial experiment between them\n(Perrin’s confirmation of Einstein’s quantitative\npredictions of Brownian motion). This was the centre piece of\nFeyerabend’s argument for pluralism. The argument turns on the\nclaim that this refutation of classical phenomenological\nthermodynamics could not have been conducted without the development\nof statistical thermodynamics, which is an incommensurable\nalternative. Feyerabend concluded that some observations can\nonly be interpreted as refutations of an existing theory\nafter an incommensurable alternative has been developed with which to\ninterpret them (cf. Oberheim 2006, 240–245). His unorthodox\nimage of scientific progress is delineated as an increase in a set of\nincommensurable alternatives, each forcing the others into greater\narticulation (Feyerabend 1965c, 107; 1975, 30; cf. Oberheim 2005;\nOberheim 2006, 260ff.). \nThe source of the misunderstanding concerning incomparability appears\nto be Feyerabend’s onetime suggestion that\n“incommensurable theories may not possess any comparable\nconsequences” (1962, 94). However, here Feyerabend was arguing\nthat although the same experimental set-up might produce a numerical\nresult that can be used to confirm both of two\nincommensurable theories (e.g. measuring the time of a freefalling\nstone to test predictions by both Newtonian mechanics and Relativity\ntheory), in order to use the result to confirm a theory, it must be\ninterpreted by that theory. Given that the two incommensurable\ntheories will use qualitatively incompatible concepts to\ninterpret quantitatively identical results, they will\ninterpret the same quantitative sentences as different qualitative\nstatements. Feyerabend concluded directly thereafter: “Hence,\nthere may not exist any possibility of finding a\ncharacterization of the observations which are supposed to\nconfirm two incommensurable theories” (1962, 94, italics\ninserted). This does rule out the possibility of using a\nneutral observation language to compare the empirical\nconsequences of two incommensurable theories. Yet Feyerabend did not\nconclude that this inhibits their comparison, but rather that there is\nno need for a neutral observation language in order to\ncompare them. Feyerabend also mentions other possibilities of\ncomparing incommensurable theories (Feyerabend 1965b, 217; 1970, 228;\n1975, 284; 1978, 68; 1981a, 16). Some of these involve making\nsubjective judgments about how to weigh different values that may pull\nin different directions (methodological incommensurability). \nFinally, there is one central, substantive point of agreement between\nKuhn and Feyerabend. Both see incommensurability as precluding the\npossibility of interpreting scientific development as an approximation\nto truth (or as an “increase of verisimilitude”)\n(Feyerabend, 1965c, 107; 1970, 220, 222, 227–228; 1975, 30, 284;\n1978, 68; Kuhn 1970, 206; 2000 [1991], 95; 2000 [1993], 243ff.; cf.\nOberheim 2006, 180ff.; Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 262-264). They reject\nsuch characterizations of scientific progress because they recognize\nand emphasize that scientific revolutions result in changes in\nontology. Such changes are not just refinements of, or additions to,\nthe older ontology, such that these developments could be seen as\ncumulative additions to already established theoretical views. Rather,\nthe new ontology replaces its predecessor. Consequently,\nneither Kuhn nor Feyerabend can correctly be characterized as\nscientific realists who believe that science makes progress toward the\ntruth.","contact.mail":"hoyningen@ww.uni-hannover.de","contact.domain":"ww.uni-hannover.de"}]
