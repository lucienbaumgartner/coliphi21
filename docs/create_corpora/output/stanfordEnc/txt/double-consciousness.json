Pittman","entry":"double-consciousness","body.text":"\n\n\nDouble-consciousness is a concept in social philosophy\nreferring, originally, to a source of inward “twoness”\nputatively experienced by African-Americans because of their\nracialized oppression and disvaluation in a white-dominated society.\nThe concept is often associated with William Edward Burghardt Du Bois,\nwho introduced the term into social and political thought, famously,\nin his groundbreaking The Souls of Black Folk (1903). Its\nsource has been traced back from there, by recent writers, to the\ndevelopment of clinical psychology in the nineteenth-century North\nAtlantic, and to trends in idealist philosophies of self—to the\ntranscendentalism of Ralph Waldo Emerson and G.W.F. Hegel’s\nPhenomenology of Spirit. It is thus indirectly related to\nother nineteenth- and twentieth-century riffs on Hegelian themes, such\nas false consciousness and bad faith. In our day it continues to be\nused and discussed by numerous commentators—philosophical and\notherwise—on racialized cultures, societies, and literatures, by\ncultural and literary theorists, and by students and investigators of\nAfricana Philosophy. Recent philosophical debates center on the\nsignificance of the concept for Du Bois’s thought overall, its\ntheoretical coherence, and its relevance for current social\nconditions.\n\n\nIn an 1897 magazine article and again in his 1903 Souls of Black\nFolk, Du Bois innovated by using a term already in\ncurrency—and with multiple associations in a variety of\nliterary, philosophical, and scientific discourses—in a\ndistinctive and original way to name a theretofore largely unremarked\nphenomenon. The innovation was part of an account of a form of\nlife-experience that he ascribed to “black folk” in\nAmerica generally in then-current social circumstances—Jim Crow\nin the south, de facto segregation in the North, and the\nthreat and actuality of racist violence throughout the country.  \nThe term he\nused—“double-consciousness”—dropped entirely,\nafter just these two uses, from his published writing. Those uses\nnonetheless struck a chord, and use of the term, interpreted in a\nnumber of distinct ways, has become more frequent as the century since\nits appearance has passed. While the disappearance of the term from Du\nBois’s writing after 1903 has fueled questions about the\nsignificance of the concept in the overall assessment of his work,\nsome commentators continue to insist on the centrality of the concept\nfor an appreciation of Du Bois’s legacy.  \nDu Bois was engaged throughout his long career in the attempt to\nunderstand both the socio-historic conditions facing “Black\nfolk” in the American twentieth century, and the impacts of\nthose conditions on the consciousness and “inner world” of\nthe human beings subject to them. In Souls of Black Folk that\nsecond concern was with capturing in words “the strange meaning\nof being black”, with describing the “spiritual\nworld” and the “spiritual strivings” of “the\nAmerican Negro”. Du Bois continued to articulate responses to\nthese concerns in his later works: one finds formulations addressing\nthem even in his posthumously published Autobiography\n(1968). As the contexts of Du Bois’s writing, research, and\nactivism changed, these responses shifted in focus, emphasis, and\nperspective. Broadly speaking, as his reflections on what he initially\ntermed the “spiritual world” of Black folk came to be more\nrichly filled out in the variety and extent of its details, Du\nBois’s account of the phenomena he originally identified with\nthe term “double-consciousness” both overflowed the\ninitial associations of that term and became stratified under pressure\nfrom his shifts in perspective. In what follows, we trace the fate of\nDu Bois’s 1903 account in his later work and then try to assess\nthe reconstructed account on its own terms.  \nThis article will, first, briefly survey some of the attempts to\nexplicate and contextualize the use of the concept by Du Bois in\nThe Souls of Black Folk of 1903 (hereafter Souls),\npresent a brief overview of controversies concerning the viability of\nthe concept and its significance for contemporary Africana thought,\nand then present some suggestions concerning the development of Du\nBois’s understanding of the phenomenon after Souls.\n(The term Du Bois used was “double-consciousness”, with\nthe hyphen intact; more recent writers have generally abandoned the\nhyphen. In this article the hyphen is retained in discussing Du\nBois’s 1903 term and concept, and interpretive attempts to get\nat it. But “double consciousness”\nsimpliciter is used when discussing the term more generally,\nand in relation to current debates about its import for Africana\nthought.) \nThe locus classicus for the Du Boisian conception occurs in the\nthird paragraph of “Of our Spiritual Strivings”, the first\nchapter of Du Bois’s 1903 Souls (this chapter is a very\nslightly modified version of the earlier “The Strivings of the\nNegro People”, an article Du Bois published in The\nAtlantic magazine in August, 1897, where he first uses the\nterm): \nAfter the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and\nMongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and\ngifted with second-sight in this American world,—a world which\nyields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself\nthrough the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation,\nthis double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s\nself through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the\ntape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever\nfeels his two-ness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two\nthoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark\nbody, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\n(1997 [1903]: 38) [This passage henceforth referred to as the “Strivings”\ntext.]  \nAn inspection of the passage reveals the complexity of its object.\nDouble-consciousness is identified here as a “sensation”,\none which falls short of “true” self-consciousness, but is\na consciousness of one’s self, nonetheless. It is also part of a\nmore complex feeling of “two-ness”, of disparate and\ncompeting “thoughts”, “strivings”, and\n“ideals”. This is not an episodic or occasional sensation,\nbut a fixed and persistent form of consciousness. It is ascribed to\n“the Negro … in this American world”, that is, it\nseems to be a socio-cultural construct rather than a baldly bio-racial\ngiven, and it is particularly attributed to people of African descent\nin America. The “two-ness” of which it is a consciousness\nthus is not inherent, accidental, nor benign: the condition is both\nimposed and fraught with psychic danger. It is presented as arising in\nconjunction with two other phenomena, related to two other\nfigures—the “veil”, and the “gift” of\n“second-sight”. Of these, “the veil” is the\nmore insistent motif, recurring regularly throughout Souls as\nwell as other of Du Bois’s writings. By contrast, the terms\n“double-consciousness” and “second-sight” seem\nnot to have been used in print by Du Bois after 1903. Still, this\npassage has come to have a singular significance in the philosophical\ninterpretation of Du Bois’s thought as well as for the influence\nof his views. \nThe paragraph immediately following makes clear that, for Du Bois,\nthis is not only a “sensation” but constitutes a crucial\nobject of “striving” and political struggle for black folk\nin the United States:  \nThe history of the American Negro is the history of this\nstrife,—this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge\nhis double self into a better and truer self. In this merging he\nwishes neither of the older selves to be lost.  \nThe phenomenon is identified again—but without being so named\nagain—in the tenth chapter of Souls, “Of the\nFaith of the Fathers”, an essay on “Negro religious\nlife”. In a passage devoted to “the current critical phase\nof Negro religion”, Du Bois sets down these words: \nFrom the double life every American Negro must live, as a Negro and as\nan American, as swept on by the current of the nineteenth while yet\nstruggling in the eddies of the fifteenth century,—from this\nmust arise a painful self-consciousness, an almost morbid sense of\npersonality, and a moral hesitancy which is fatal to self-confidence.\nThe worlds within and without the Veil of Color are changing, and\nchanging rapidly, but not at the same rate, not in the same way; and\nthis must produce a peculiar wrenching of the soul, a peculiar sense\nof doubt and bewilderment. Such a double life, with double thoughts,\ndouble duties, and double social classes, must give rise to double\nwords and double ideals, and tempt the mind to pretence or revolt, to\nhypocrisy or radicalism. (1997 [1903]: 155–6) [This passage henceforth\nreferred to as the “Faith”\ntext.]  \nHere double-consciousness, unnamed, is set in a more dynamic context\nthan in the earlier, “Strivings”\ntext. The two passages,\nparallel in form, are subtly different in tone. Here Du Bois clearly\ndistinguishes two social “worlds” and the “double\nlives” that result. This text sweeps us along, showing a\ncausality, a coming-into-being of consciousness. And this second,\n“Faith” text, concludes by\nnoting, in a matter of words, the social and political consequences of\nthis “painful” double-consciousness. Yet, oddly, the\n“Faith” text is largely\nneglected in discussions of the concept.  \nThe current relevance of double consciousness to an understanding of\nBlack lives, and of contemporary American reality, is evidenced by\nrecent commentary and scholarship. In a recent interview, Toni\nMorrison recalls the Du Boisian motif in characterizing the\nliterary work of Black men:  \n… African American male writers justifiably write books about\ntheir oppression,  \nshe says.  \nConfronting the oppressor who is white male or white woman. It’s\nrace. And the person who defines you under those circumstances is a\nwhite mind—tells you whether you’re worthy or what have\nyou. And as long as that’s your preoccupation, you’re\ndefending yourself against that. Reacting to it. Reacting to the\ndefinition—saying it’s not true.  \nMorrison contrasts this to her own approach, which is to  \ntake away the gaze of the white male. Once you take that out, the\nwhole world opens up. (Morrison 2012)   \nLawrie Balfour, in discussing what she calls James Baldwin’s\n“race conscious” approach to American race relations\n(1998), measures its similarities to and differences from Du Boisian\ndouble consciousness. Balfour argues that Baldwin’s approach\n“goes to the core of the post-civil rights predicament”\n(1998: 246) since the basic reality\nof the color line has not been decisively effaced. Most recently, the\nNew York Times columnist Charles M. Blow has more than once\ncited the “Strivings” text in\ncommenting on the contemporary paradoxes of black life brought into\nthe open by some of President Obama’s public statements in the\nwake of recent criminal justice controversies (Blow 2013).  \nA number of academic writers have been concerned in the last twenty\nyears to contextualize and interpret Du Bois’s notion of\ndouble-consciousness—most often focusing on the\n “Strivings”\ntext, and ignoring the\n“Faith” text—to\nidentify sources and antecedents that influenced his conception, and\nto clarify the concerns he was addressing and his intentions in\nputting it forward. A brief resume of that interpretive record\nfollows.  \nIn his 1992 article “W.E.B. Du Bois and the Idea of Double\nConsciousness”, Dickson D. Bruce Jr. suggests a variety of\nsources of the complex of meanings marshaled at the time by Du\nBois’s use of the term. The “double consciousness”\nfigure precedes Du Bois, coming out of the European romantic\nopposition between an innate human affinity for the transcendent and a\npragmatic “materialism” grounded in a utilitarian attitude\nto life, to mundane needs and commercial enterprise. Tracing this\nunderstanding of double consciousness back to the American philosopher\nRalph Waldo Emerson (and beyond him to Goethe), who used the term in\nhis essay, “The Transcendentalist” (1842), Bruce maintains\nthat this anti-bourgeois romanticism is a “figurative\nbackground” of Du Bois’s use of the term, to which Du Bois\nbrought his idea that  \nthe essence of a distinctive African consciousness was its\nspirituality… revealed among African Americans in their\nfolklore, their history of patient suffering, and their faith. (Bruce\n1999 [1992]: 238) \nBruce also briefly traces the trajectory of\n“double-consciousness” in the medical and psychological\nliterature of the nineteenth century. An early appearance of the term\nin the Medical Repository in 1817 (Mitchill 1817: 185) named\nthe condition of a Mary Reynolds, who, for a period of about fifteen\nyears beginning in her nineteenth, alternately lived two distinct\nlives, with wholly different personalities, uncognizant of and\ninaccessible to each other. This use of the term had some currency\nthroughout the nineteenth century; William James, one of Du\nBois’s Harvard philosophy professors, described such cases as\nalternating between “primary and secondary\nconsciousnesses” in his considerable discussion of them in the\nPrinciples of Psychology (1890: see esp. Vol. I, 379-393),\npublished while Du Bois was at Harvard (although James does not seem\nto have used the term “double-consciousness”) (Bruce 1999\n[1992]: 240–1). Bruce comments that  \n…based on Du Bois’s use of\n“double-consciousness” in his Atlantic essay he\ncertainly seems to have known the term’s psychological\nbackground, because he used it in ways quite consistent with that\nbackground. (1999: 242)  \n[Bruce does not note the appearance of the term, in\nFrench—“double conscience”—in Josef\nBreuer and Sigmund Freud’s “On the Psychical Mechanism of\nHysterical Phenomena” published in 1893 in Neurologisches\nCentralblatt, Nos. 1 and 2. This paper was later reprinted as the\nfirst chapter of Studies on Hysteria, published in 1895.\nBreuer and Freud appear to use the French term in responding to and\ndeveloping its earlier use by Pierre Janet, relating it to\n“splitting of consciousness” and psychic\n“dissociation”. (For a discussion of the\nBreuer-Freud-Janet connection, see James Strachey’s introduction to\nStudies on Hysteria.)]  \nThe diverse associations of the different senses of the term were\ncrucial, Bruce argues, to the resonance and suggestiveness of Du\nBois’s distinctive use of the term: the romantic-transcendental\nconnotations of spiritual longing and unbridgeable opposition between\ntwo viewpoints combined with the psychological sense of not only the\nreal distinctiveness and moral parity of the two personae but\nalso the possibility that they could merge in a new synthetic unity\nsignifying a cure, a fact reported in a number of cases of the\npsychological malady. \nThe first book-length study thematizing Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness was Sandra Adell’s\nDouble-Consciousness/ Double Bind: Theoretical Issues in\nTwentieth-Century Black Literature (1994). The book engaged\ncritical debates over theoretical approaches to Black literature;\nAdell argues for an intertextualism inspired by Derridean\ndeconstruction, and aimed at transcending the “Afrocentric/\nEurocentric” divide. The book begins with a chapter on Du\nBois’s “Strivings” text\nand Souls. Adell, following the lead of Joel\nWilliamson’s earlier article, “W.E.B. Du Bois as a\nHegelian” (1978), presents Du Bois’s text as a\n“reading” and use of crucial passages in Hegel: Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness, she claims, “emerges from the philosophy\nof Hegel as it is articulated in the Phenomenology of\nSpirit” (1994: 8). She adduces as evidence for the Hegelian\nreading of Souls Du Bois’s studies with William James\nand Josiah Royce, references to Hegel in Du Bois’s Philosophy IV\nnotebook from his time at Harvard, as well as his studies with von\nTrietschke in Berlin “(in the midst of a ‘Hegelian\nrevival’ when he arrived)” (1994: 12). \nAdell identifies three “instances” of the “doubling\nof consciousness” in Hegel’s text (in the section on\n“Self-Consciousness”; in “Lordship and\nBondage”; and in “The Unhappy Consciousness”); it is\nthe third of these that, Adell argues, forms the basic pattern for the\n“Strivings” text: \nDu Bois’s “double-consciousness” decontextualizes\nHegel’s “Unhappy Consciousness” … and opens\nit up to other contexts. In this case, the new context is one upon\nwhich is inscribed the problem of the twentieth century: the problem\nof the color line. (1994: 19)  \nAdell sketches a reading of the entire text of Souls as a\ndetailed “sociological, psychological, and philosophical”\naccount of “the Negro’s being-in-the-world” (1994:\n19). Her reading identifies other borrowings from German Idealism,\nnoting along the way that  \nthe title of Du Bois’s text itself, The Souls of Black\nFolk, remarks and reiterates the two concepts—soul and\nfolk—(Volk) that are central, not only to [Johann\nGottfried von] Herder’s aesthetics, but to that of Hegel as\nwell. (1994: 23) \nWhat might be called a “deflationist” approach to the\ninterpretation of Du Bois’s conception of double-consciousness\nis pursued by Adolph Reed, Jr., in his 1997 book on Du Bois’s\npolitical philosophy, W.E.B. Du Bois and American Political\nThought: Fabianism and the Color Line. Reed’s book offers a\ncritique of what he dubs “vindicationist” approaches to\nAfro-American political thought—approaches attempting to show\nthe significance of the work of African-American theorists by tracing\nanalogies and lines of influence between them and the\n“greats” of the European tradition (1997: 12). The double\npolemical thrust of Reed’s text, with respect to\ndouble-consciousness, is to question the alleged sources of influence\non Du Bois’s thinking, and to refute the claim that Du\nBois’s formulation refers to a transhistorical feature of black\nlife in America. He points to the  \nfact that, for all its prominence in The Souls of Black Folk,\nthe double-consciousness notion by and large disappears from Du\nBois’s writing after 1903,  \nto undercut the claims that it “was a definitive element, a key\norganizing principle of his thought” or “a moment in a\ndistinctively black social-theoretical discourse or tradition”\n(1997: 124). He concludes that  \n[a]s a proposition alleging a generic racial condition—that\nmillions of individuals experience a peculiar form of bifurcated\nidentity, simply by virtue of common racial status—the notion\nseems preposterous on its face. (1997: 125) \nReed, setting out an extensive contextualizing account, shows the\nconsiderable cachet of ideas of duality current when Du Bois wrote,\nand argues that the claims of a lineage connecting Du Bois’s use\nof double-consciousness to Emerson’s and James’s writings\nfail. He rejects any Hegelian source of influence on Du Bois, aligning\nDu Bois’s concept with evolutionary and Lamarckian\nsocial-scientific views instead. Reed argues that an emphasis on\ndouble-consciousness comes to the fore in Du Bois interpretation only\nafter the 1960s, when it supplants critical attention to the critique\nof Booker T. Washington’s strategy of\n“accommodation” in the third essay of the book. Reed\nattributes this shift in focus to “an ideological current within\nthe post-segregation-era black petite bourgeoisie” (1997: 130)\n“centered on assertion of black presence within hermetically\nconstituted communities of academic discourse” (1997:\n94–5).  \nErnest Allen Jr. presents a similarly deflationist case in his\narticle, “Du Boisian Double Consciousness: The Unsustainable\nArgument” (2002), arguing that the Du Boisian conception of\ndouble-consciousness was a “tactical, political” attempt\nto gain support among sympathetic white philanthropists for the\nefforts of cultural uplift and organization on the part of a\n“Talented Tenth”, an “educated black elite”.\nThe rhetorical construction of a model of double-consciousness in\nSouls involves for Allen a “double sleight of\nhand” (2002: 25), requiring a slippage between a putative\nconflict of ideals within the minds of the black elite and a more\ngeneral problem for African Americans “who could not help but\nhave internalized some of the negative sentiments that white society\nheld towards them” (2002: 29). \nThe attribution of distinctive “American” and\n“Negro” ideals is empty, Allen argues: there are no clear\nexamples of “Negro” ideals in the offing in Du\nBois’s text. Though there is no conflict between\n“warring” ideals as claimed by Du Bois—ideals\nequally attractive, between which Negroes had to choose but\ncouldn’t—there is a conflict between white racial\nprejudice and intransigent hostility and exclusion of blacks, on the\none hand, and the ideal of civic equality for all emblazoned on the\nideological banners of the American republic, on the other.\nThis—what Allen calls “the institutionalized as well as\neveryday double consciousness and double dealings of white\nAmericans”—is, he claims, “the social\nfoundation” of the “African American ideological\nambivalence” (2002: 38) that Du Boisian double-consciousness\nexpresses. \nRobert Gooding-Williams develops an elaborate analysis of\ndouble-consciousness in his In the Shadow of Du Bois: Afro-Modern\nPolitical Thought in America (2009). Gooding-Williams presents a\ntripartite account of the concept as a keystone in Du Bois’s\npolitical-philosophical project. Double-consciousness functions as\npart of an account of the subjective experience of African-Americans\nin conditions dominated by Jim Crow and the “color line”;\nit serves as an essential component of Du Bois’s critique of\ncertain forms of black political leadership under those conditions;\nand it underwrites Du Bois’s own positive theory of\n“political expressivism”. Gooding-Williams, like Allen,\ndistinguishes double-consciousness from the more general idea of\n“two-ness” that Du Bois connects it to, arguing also that\n“second sight” is a distinctive feature of Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness. \nGooding-Williams’ account of double-consciousness emphasizes\nthat Du Bois presents the concept in Souls in a passage that\nbegins with the question, “How does it feel to be a\nproblem?”—a question which references the so-called\n“Negro problem”. This positioning indicates an inward\napproach to the “subjective” felt experience of “the\nNegro”. Double-consciousness is related in this passage to\n“second sight”, which Du Bois characterizes as a\n“gift” in this American world. Gooding-Williams finds two\nsources for the idea of second sight—one in African-American\nfolklore, and one in the nineteenth-century literature on animal\nmagnetism. Both these present it as a capacity for a sort of\nextra-sensory perception (e.g., of ghosts) or a kind of vision into\nthe future—a capacity to see what is not generally visible.\nGooding-Williams argues that Du Bois uses “second sight”\nto identify “the Negro’s” capacity to see himself\nthrough the eyes of white Americans. Because white Americans\nconstitute what Du Bois refers to as “the other world”, a\nsocial group distinct from that of black folk, whites’\nperceptions of and views about blacks would not “normally”\nbe available to blacks, for Gooding-Williams; it is second sight that\ngives such access. In “this American world”, however,\nwhites’ perspectives on blacks are deeply distorted by racial\nprejudice. It is the “gift” of second sight, then, that\nmakes blacks’ self-consciousness into a “false\nself-consciousness”, Gooding-Williams claims, by fostering in\nthem a self-concept molded by contempt and a presumption of\ninferiority.  \nGooding-Williams agrees with Reed in rejecting readings of\ndouble-consciousness as a timeless condition, and in seeing the\ncentrality of an emancipatory political project for Du Bois’s\nunderstanding of the Negro’s social condition. On\nGooding-Williams’ reconstruction, double-consciousness, as a\nform of false self-consciousness, is a causally necessary condition of\nthe sense of two-ness Du Bois describes. That sense is of a\nconflict between two sets of ideals and strivings, so\nGooding-Williams dubs it “conflictual two-ness”. For Du\nBois, the “merging” of the two selves can only take place\nif white prejudice and, in a word, racism, has been eliminated from\nthe environing culture and the “other world’s”\nperspective on the Negro, and, consequently, from “the\nNegro’s” second sight. Gooding-Williams identifies this\nwith the achievement of reciprocal recognition that has been denied\nthe Negro by the white “other world” throughout American\nhistory. \nThus, Gooding-Williams presents double-consciousness as a “false\nself-consciousness” arising through second sight exercised in\nconditions of a racially prejudiced dominant culture. This false\nconsciousness can make way for a “true self-consciousness”\nonly when those conditions have been transformed and whites no longer\nperceive blacks as “contemptible” or\n“inferior” (for only then will the Negro’s\n“second sight” reflect a perception of himself undistorted\nby prejudice). This eventuality, neither inevitable nor unattainable,\nis consequently a prime object of the Du Boisian political project.\nThat project’s broader object—indeed, the goal of the\nhistory of African-American striving—is for African-Americans to\nbe recognized as “co-workers in the kingdom of culture”.\nGooding-Williams concludes that the overcoming of double-consciousness\nis a necessary and sufficient condition for the achievement of\nreciprocal recognition and full equality, since the struggle for full\nequality grounded in reciprocal recognition cannot be won without\neradicating the basis for double-consciousness. \nGooding-Williams argues finally that Du Bois was concerned with\ndouble-consciousness not only as a correlate of the disenfranchised\ncondition that constitutes the so-called Negro problem, but also as a\ncrucial test of the effectiveness of the struggle for the overcoming\nof that condition itself. In his discussions of Booker T. Washington\nand Alexander Crummell (in chapters III and XII of Souls), Du\nBois makes a case that both these leaders fell victim to a\ndouble-consciousness, vitiating their effectiveness as leaders of the\nemancipation struggle. The “Atlanta Compromise” Washington\nproposed in 1895, for example, was a strategy that, by giving up the\ndemand for black citizenship rights, compromised the struggle for\nrecognition and effectively reinforced double-consciousness by failing\nto challenge the white perception of Negro\n“inferiority”. \nFrank Kirkland proposes, following Gooding-Williams, to take Du Bois\nat his word in describing double-consciousness as a\n“feeling”; Kirkland articulates that feeling through the\nRousseauian notion of amour-propre, the form of\n“civilized” self-love that is reflective, contrastive,\nand, in Rousseau’s account, radically corrosive of social\nsolidarity. (Rousseau’s account distinguishes\namour-propre from amour de soi, a\n“natural” instinctual urge to self-preservation.\nAmour-propre is a purely social sort of anti-solidarity,\npitting one against another on grounds of comparative measures of\nworth.)  \nDu Bois’ “double consciousness” refers to a black\nperson’s felt awareness of the harmfully comparative measures of\nothers on her character and self-esteem, by which s⁄he takes\nherself to be a problem in and of a social arrangement permitting such\nmeasures or obliging them. (2013: 144) \nFor Kirkland, Du Bois’ conception of double-consciousness is\ninherently comparative, the consequence of the operation of\namour-propre in conditions of the color line. Du Bois,\naccording to Kirkland, began from the “inflamed\namour-propre of others”:  \nthose (of the darker races) have their own respect and esteem …\ndenied or underestimated by others (of the lighter races), thereby\nagitating and worsening the color line. (2013: 140)  \nFor Kirkland amour-propre is not the cause of the color-line,\nbut  \nonce the color line is on the scene, amour-propre provides it\nwith the stimulus to spread widely and intensely forms of inequality.\n(2013: 146 n19) \nKirkland also stresses the element of “sentience” within\ndouble-consciousness, of the black person’s awareness, even if\nunreflective and rudimentary, of the comparative form of his/her\ndisvaluation.  \n[F]or Du Bois, this comparison gone awry is a matter about which black\npeople are, at least, sentient, awake to, even if they have not\ngrasped it conceptually,  \nwrites Kirkland, adding that this is “their sentience to the\ncomparison by which they are made a problem” (2013: 140). \nKirkland identifies two forms of the “hazard” consequent\non double-consciousness for African-Americans: it can induce a\n“dual/duelist” hazard of internally conflicted aspirations\nand expectations, and a related “duplicitous” stance of\nhypocrisy. Both these arise from the felt need to  \ncompromis[e] one’s ideals to maintain one’s\nesteem…. Being of two conflicting minds or being two-faced are\nthe outcomes of the compromise to the hazards accompanying their\naspirations for esteem. (2013: 145)  \nKirkland also identifies a third, “dyadic” form of\ndouble-consciousness which  \nwould reflect, via education, the result of an individual coming to a\ntrue, non-estranged comprehension of the position s⁄he deserves\nin comparison to others as both a citizen and a person of color with\ncertain talents and competences. (2013: 142)  \nThis “non-estranged” mode of double-consciousness is a\n“solution to the hazards” of the other two forms,\naccording to Kirkland. \nCornel West extends the analytic grasp of the concept as part of a\ncritical discussion of double-consciousness in his first book,\nProphecy Deliverance! (1982). In the first chapter, West\nsuggests an ingredient missing from Du Bois’s analysis of the\nself-consciousness of Africans in America, claiming that  \nDu Bois overlooked the broader dialectic of being American yet feeling\nEuropean, of being provincial but yearning for British\ncosmopolitanism, of being at once incompletely civilized and\nmaterially prosperous, a genteel Brahmin amid uncouth conditions.\nBlack Americans labored rather under the burden of a triple crisis of\nself-consciousness. Their cultural predicament was comprised of\nAfrican appearance and unconscious cultural mores, involuntary\ndisplacement to America without American status, and American\nalienation from the European ethos complicated through domination by\nincompletely European Americans. (1982: 30–1) \nWest further complicates his enumeration of the tangled elements of\nthe African-American cultural dialectic, referring to the\n“anxiety-ridden provinciality” of Protestant-American\nself-identity, and the “distinctly antimodern values and\nsensibilities” dominant in the southern states, the\n“geographic cradle of black America” (1982: 31).  \nWest’s formulations do not unmake the basic claim of Du\nBois’s text, but embed its core insight in a richer vision. The\n“triple crisis of self-consciousness” West attributes to\nblack Americans seems to add “American alienation from the\nEuropean ethos” to the two “sides” of Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness. It’s worth noting that, near the end of\nWest’s discussion, he acknowledges that, in the first attempts\nto shape their own self-identity, “Black people were relatively\nuninformed about British culture…”. This seems to\nminimize the significance of “British cosmopolitanism” and\n“alienation from the European ethos” as issues for black\nfolk in America generally. It would follow that, as Africans in\nAmerica became educated in the European-American cultural milieu,\ntheir awareness and sensitivity to the anxieties of generic American\nself-awareness might be more fully reflected in their own\nself-understandings. \nIn The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness\n(1993) Paul Gilroy attempts to “muddle” the\nboundaries—both disciplinary and geographical—of the\npolitical and cultural analysis in/of black studies. Gilroy argues,\nagainst essentialist and nationalist trends in black political\ndiscourse, for an “intercultural and anti-ethnocentric account\nof black history and political culture” (1993: 115). Du Bois\nfigures prominently in that argument, and Gilroy extends Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness both beyond the American context and at odds with\nan essentialist understanding of race. \nGilroy claims double consciousness as an overriding thematic element\nin Du Bois’s thought and writing, both in and beyond\nSouls, part of Du Bois’s attempt to subvert rigidly\nfixed racial identities as imposed categories keyed to the oppressive\nsocial structures of white supremacy. The\n “Strivings”\ntext is taken as one early\nexplicit expression of Du Bois’s own ambivalence toward\nmodernity, prefiguring as well the increasingly transnational and\npan-racial scope of Du Bois’s evolving concerns as the twentieth\ncentury unrolls. Gilroy also identifies that ambivalence as a stable\nand pronounced tendency in diasporic black cultures and political\ndebates generally.  \nIn a reading of Souls that is central to his book, Gilroy\nhighlights the  \nnagging anxiety over the inner contradictions of modernity and a\nradical scepticism towards the ideology of progress with which it is\nassociated (1993: 117)  \nthat he finds there in germ form. Gilroy further finds elements of an\nimplicit global-diasporic—hence “Black\nAtlantic”—perspective on “the meaning of being\nblack” that is in tension with, and submerged somewhat under the\n“smooth flow of African-American exceptionalisms” (1993:\n120). This element within the discourse of Souls points to\nthe wider significance of double consciousness, according to Gilroy,\nwho argues that the theme would, subsequent to Souls, come\n“to illuminate the experience of post-slave populations in\ngeneral” and to “animate a dream of global co-operation\namong people of color which came to full fruition only in [Du\nBois’] later work” (1993: 126).  \nPaget Henry’s phenomenological treatment of Du Bois’s\ndouble-consciousness conception in his “Africana Phenomenology:\nIts Philosophical Implications” (2005) identifies a\n“theory” of double consciousness as part of a\n“comprehensive phenomenology of Africana\nself-consciousness” (2005: 85). Henry distinguishes Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness from the double consciousness found in\nHegel’s discussion of lordship and bondage in the\nPhenomenology of Spirit: Du Boisian double-consciousness  \nis the theorizing of a period of racial/imperial domination in the\nself-consciousness of the Africana subject that is absent from the\nlife of Hegel’s European subject. (2005: 94) \nHenry offers further an explication of Du Boisian “second\nsight”: on his view, it is  \nthe ability of the racialized Africana subject to see him/herself as\n“a negro”, that is, through the eyes of the white other.\n(2005: 89)  \nHenry characterizes this as a “categoric form of self-blindness\n… a classic case of false consciousness” (2005: 90). But\nHenry claims a further, ethically propitious form of second sight is\npossible—what he calls “potentiated second sight”.\nThis is a “very special access and insight into the dehumanizing\n‘will to power’ of the European imperial subject”.\nThis “potentiating” of second sight can occur, according\nto Henry, when an Africana subject is able to uproot the\n“blackface” stereotype from his/her consciousness and\nreconceive him/herself as “an African” by operating\n“within the creative codes of African discourses and\nsymbols” (2005: 91). Henry cites the Rastafarians as an example\nof this route to potentiated second sight. An alternate route to\npotentiated second sight is through an individually acquired\nindependent standpoint on the world of the agents of white supremacy,\nand here Henry cites Du Bois himself as an exemplar. \nHenry’s account of double consciousness identifies Du Boisian\ndouble-consciousness with the object of Frantz Fanon’s\nexistential-psychoanalytic account of black self-consciousness,\nrelying primarily on Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks\n(1967). While clearly specifying the Freudian and Sartrian idiom in\nwhich Fanon carries through his analyses in that text, Henry writes\nthat “there is no finer or more detailed account of the state of\nracial double consciousness” (2005: 95). In the very first pages\nof that text, Fanon makes clear his psychoanalytic orientation,\nwriting of the black’s “inferiority complex”—a\nterm whose first appearance in the book is in an epigraph, a quotation\nfrom Aime Cesaire’s Discourse on Colonialism. Several\npages later, Fanon observes that \nThe effective disalienation of the black man entails an immediate\nrecognition of social and economic realities. If there is an\ninferiority complex, it is the outcome of a double process: primarily,\neconomic; subsequently, the internalization—or better, the\nepidermalization—of this inferiority. (1967: 10–11)  \nHenry details a process he dubs “negrification”, to which,\non his reading of Fanon, the black is subject in the confines of the\nWest. In that process, “colonized Africana people lost their\nearlier cultural identities and became identified by the color of\ntheir skin” (2005: 96). In this process, the white colonizer\nprojects the most reprehensible and forbidden aspects of himself onto\nthe black man, thereby bringing about the stereotype of “the\nNegro”. Fanon also borrows Jungian formulations for his account,\nwriting of the “collective unconscious of homo\noccidentalis”, in which the black man “symbolizes\nevil, sin, wretchedness, death, war, famine”. Referring to his\nnative land, Fanon writes  \n[i]n Martinique, whose collective unconscious makes it a European\ncountry, when a “blue” Negro—a coal-black\none—comes to visit, one reacts at once: “What bad luck is\nhe bringing?” (1967: 191) \nIn an earlier text, Caliban’s Reason (2000), Henry uses\nthe Shakespearean motif, from The Tempest, of the clash of\nthe European colonizer Prospero with the native Caliban. There he\nwrites of the “Calibanization” of the Africans imported by\nEuropean slavers to the Caribbean:  \n[C]olor eclipsed culture. The latter became more invisible as Africans\nwere transformed into negroes and niggers in the minds of Europeans.\nThis racial violence shattered the cultural foundations of the African\nself…. Race became the primary signifier of Europeans and\nAfricans and of the differences between them. Consequently, the\nidentities of these two groups were rigidly inscribed in a set of\nbinary oppositions that linked the binary black/white to other\nbinaries such as primitive/civilized, irrational/rational, body/mind,\nprelogical/logical, flesh/spirit. (2000: 11–2)  \nHenry takes this process of “Calibanization”—the\nsubstitution of a racialized identity based on a set of insidiously\ncontrastive binaries for an original and native cultural identity\ngrounded in African ways of life—as the production of a form of\ndouble consciousness. \nLewis Gordon touches on double consciousness in his account of Du\nBois’s significance to the tradition of Africana philosophy in\nhis Introduction to Africana Philosophy (2008). Gordon notes\nthat in the very first paragraphs of the “Strivings”\nchapter, Du Bois refers to the\n“unasked question” at the root of his personal\ninteractions with white interlocutors: “How does it feel to be a\nproblem?” For Gordon, this question presupposes the\nsubjectivity, and, hence, the humanity, of the black person being\naddressed. And yet, the ascription of the status of a\n“problem” to that person involves at the same time a\ndenial of the humanity of that black addressee. Gordon notes\nthat “[t]he appeal to blacks as problem-people is an assertion\nof their ultimate location outside the system of order and\nrationality” (2008: 76). This outsider status, Gordon suggests,\nis crucial to the formation of double consciousness, leading as it\ndoes to “the splitting of worlds and consciousness itself\naccording to the norms of U.S. society and its contradictions”.\nGordon claims the ascription of problematic status to blacks itself is\nnecessitated by the fact that “‘American’ was\npersistently defined as ‘white’ in North America and the\nrest of the Americas” (2008: 77). \nGordon specifies the “negative version” of double\nconsciousness as when the self-image of the black person is wholly\ndetermined by how the racial others view her—her view of herself\nbecomes a “white point of view” (2008: 78). Closely\nrelated to this is an exclusionary account of citizenship, relegating\nthe black person to the status of noncitizen or a lesser, second class\ncitizen. For Gordon, the epistemological significance of double\nconsciousness is that one of the two perspectives implicit in\nit—that of the white world—is necessarily partial, yet\npositions itself as universal, and so, is “a form of\nconsciousness that hides itself” (2008: 79). This only comes to\nlight because this dominant self-conception brings into being a\n“subaltern” consciousness, which is a consciousness of the\ncontradictions in that dominant self-conception. This, Gordon writes,\nis the second, doubling consciousness in its affirmative, fully\nrealized manifestation. \nThe preceding resume of the interpretive literature on Du Bois’s\nconception yields several points of contention, among them issues\nconcerning the source(s) of Du Bois’s conception and\nterminology, and especially the possible Rousseauian, Hegelian and/or\nAmerican philosophical connections; the scope of the conception, that\nis, how widely and to whom Du Bois thought it applied; the relation\nbetween double-consciousness and the psychic duality he associated it\nwith; the nature of “second sight”, and its relation to\ndouble-consciousness; double-consciousness’s connection to what\nmight be called pathology, on the one hand, and to critical social\nawareness or critique, on the other; the validity and usefulness of\nthe conception to an understanding of the situation of black folk\nspecifically, both at the turn of the twentieth century when Du Bois\nput it forward, and today, in the century plus since. Here we briefly\nrecapitulate several of those questions. \nThe first question, one Gooding-Williams identifies as a paradox,\nconcerns Du Bois’s apparent invulnerability to\ndouble-consciousness. If double-consciousness is indeed endemic to\n“Negroes”—if it was, in a sense, a structural\nproblem for any Negro consciousness under conditions of Jim\nCrow—then how exactly could Du Bois himself write as though he\nhas transcended or surmounted it, and achieved himself the “true\nself-conscious manhood”? And if not, how can the account he\npresents be taken as veridical? Although Du Bois never explicitly\nmakes the claim that he himself is free from double-consciousness, he\ndoes seem to have written as though his theoretical vision was\nrelatively unclouded by an internal soul-struggle. And yet Du Bois\nalso clearly introduces his conception of double-consciousness in the\ncontext of an account of his own personal experience and as, in part,\nbased on that experience. \nGooding-Williams argues that this paradox can be overcome by\ndistinguishing the narrative authority of Souls from the\nhistorical author of the text. It is the narrator of Souls,\nand not Du Bois himself, who has escaped double-consciousness. This\nmay work for Souls as a literary text, but it doesn’t\nhelp make a consistent theory of black political leadership plausible,\nsuggesting as it does that no actual black political leader is immune\nfrom double-consciousness. Another possible resolution to the paradox,\none not readily available to Gooding-Williams given his\ninterpretation, involves the liberatory potential of a second sight\nthat penetrates to the contradictions of the dominant white cultural\nmilieu, and so opens up the possibility for undermining and\nsubsequently rejecting its biased assumption about black folk (what\nHenry calls “potentiated second sight”).  \nDu Bois often insisted that his accounting of “the Negro\nproblem”—or, alternatively, of “the race\nconcept”—involves leading his readers “within the\nVeil”—making it possible for his (presumably mostly white)\nreaders to gain some sense of the experience of “being\nblack”. This involves, as he puts it in Dusk of Dawn\n(1940), “elucidating the inner meaning and significance of that\nrace problem by explaining it in terms of the one human life that I\nknow best” (1968 [1940]: viii). But that life, by any measure,\nwas one lived at the top of “the upper layers of educated and\nambitious Negroes” (1968 [1940]: 185). This returns us to the\nquestion of the scope of double-consciousness, a question raised most\ninsistently by Allen. \nWhile Du Bois presents double-consciousness in the 1903 texts as a\nproblem for black folks generally given conditions of segregation and\nhistorically persisting inequality, a closer inspection shows that he\nalso suggests that the phenomenon is specific to black leadership or\nthose who are most fully caught between the white world and\nthe world of color—those who have deliberately taken on the\nproject of “the moral uplift” of the\n“backward” black masses, and who stand as\n“representatives” of these two “worlds” one to\nanother. Much of what he says in illustration of his original claim\nabout double-consciousness in the “Strivings”\npassage features educated,\n“better” Negroes: illustrative examples cited in the\nsubsequent paragraphs include that of the black artisan, the Negro\nminister or doctor, the “would be black savant”\nand the black artist. Du Bois also devotes several chapters in\nSouls to detailed characterizations of the inner soul\nstruggles of those, both actual and fictional, who would be or were in\nfact leaders of their people—Washington, Crummell, and the\nfictional John Jones. Yet much of the force of the initial claim for\ndouble-consciousness in the “Strivings”\ntext is the universality of\nits attribution there to “the Negro in this American\nworld”. \nSome recent commentators have rejected the claim that\ndouble-consciousness, in the sense of internalized disparagement or a\nself-perception of inferiority, has been a universal feature of black\nlife in America. Molefi Kete Asante, discussing his own experience\ngrowing up in and around the small town of Valdosta, Georgia, in the\n1950s, writes that \n[t]he tightly knit community of Africans who lived on the dirt roads\nof Valdosta never saw themselves as intellectually or physically\ninferior to whites. There existed no reference points outside of\nourselves despite the economic and psychological poverty of our\nsituation. (1993: 133)  \nSeveral pages later Asante states flat-out, “I was never\naffected by the Du Boisian double-consciousness” (1993: 136). He\ndoes go on to acknowledge the special circumstances of his experience:\n \nIt might have been another matter if I had gone to school and to\nchurch with whites when I was younger. I might have suffered\nconfusion, double-consciousness, but I did not. (1993: 137) \nA third issue for Du Bois’s conception of double-consciousness\nconcerns its putative relation to the “two-ness” of the\nNegro psyche. Du Bois never explicitly clarifies the relation between\ndouble-consciousness and two-ness in his texts. Du Bois was concerned\nearly on to establish a distinct contribution of “the\nNegro” to world culture and civilization, since lynch law and\nthe backlash against Reconstruction in the last decades of the\nnineteenth and early twentieth century raised the specter of a\ngenocidal extermination of black folk in America. The claim of a\ndistinctly “Negro” contribution to world culture seems to\nrequire, indeed, some distinctive Negro “ideals”. But the\nreconstruction presented by Gooding-Williams, who makes the best\ndetailed case so far for the coherence and viability of Du\nBois’s conception, depends on the claim that the two-ness is\nconflictual, and hence a “problem”, only because\ndouble-consciousness incorporates white prejudices into the\nNegro’s own self-consciousness. As Allen and others have pointed\nout (and Gooding-Williams acknowledges) Du Bois presents vague,\nseemingly empty, or competing accounts of just what the conflicting\nAmerican and Negro “ideals” are. The question, then, is\nwhether Du Bois’s reference to distinctly “Negro” or\nblack “ideals” can be sustained as a source of the\n“two-ness” to which Du Bois connects double-consciousness.\nIf there are indeed such (non-empty) ideals, and they are an\nindependent source of conflictual two-ness, then double-consciousness\nmight turn out to be a more complex phenomenon than\nGooding-Williams’ account suggests. \nThe Du Boisian conception has been criticized as well for\noversimplifying the complexity and multidimensionality of contemporary\nselves, for expressing a nostalgia for a unitary and integral self\nthat may never have existed, is an illusion, an unachievable ideal.\nThus Darlene Clark Hine suggests that  \nhad Du Bois specifically included the experiences and lives of black\nwomen in his lament, … instead of writing, “One ever\nfeels his twoness”, he would have mused about how one ever feels\nher “fiveness”: Negro, American, woman, poor, black woman.\n(Hines 1993: 338)  \nCritiques of Du Bois’s conception along these lines have become\nwidespread since the last decades of the twentieth century, but, it\nmight be argued, they are in one sense beside the point. That the 1903\ntext is masculinist seems undeniable. But it’s also true that Du\nBois’s “double-consciousness” was not proposed as a\ncomprehensive account of the reality of human being, was not addressed\nto the variety of sources of human social identity per se.\nHis conception was an attempt to capture something about the lived\nexperience of black folk as black folk in the United States\nunder conditions of Jim Crow and white supremacy. It would be wholly\nconsistent with the point of his conception if, added to the doubling\nof consciousness consequent upon racially oppressive social\nconditions, other forms of psychic doubling or fragmentation,\nresponses to other forms of inequality, might arise.  \nHenry Louis Gates Jr. addresses not the descriptive adequacy but the\nnormative thrust of Du Bois’s conception when he observes that\n \ncultural multiplicity is no longer seen as the problem, but as a\nsolution—a solution to the confines of identity itself. Double\nconsciousness, once a disorder, is now the cure. (2006: xv)\n \nThis remark is best read as a contextualizing point about Du\nBois’s conception, yet it trades upon the common confusion of\nthe duality or “two-ness” Du Bois wraps around his\ndouble-consciousness conception with that conception itself. Surely\neven if “cultural multiplicity” has come to be valuable in\nitself, as Gates has it, the “amused contempt and pity”\ncrucial to Du Bois’s double-consciousness, directed against\noneself, is an unlikely part of any “cure”.  \nFinally, a question might be raised about the relation of Du\nBois’s double-consciousness conception and the sorts of\nself-doubts, troubled feelings, and “identity issues” that\nhave been linked to biracial or mixed-race appearance or identity in\nour persisting, harshly racialized American social world. The racist\nideologies accompanying and justifying white supremacy, and the mores\nand systems of “etiquette” governing “race\nrelations” in racially hierarchical social conditions, have\npresented particular difficulties for persons of ambiguous racial\ndescent, visibly marked as brought into being by “race\nmixing”. Often mixed-race persons have encountered hostility and\nsuspicion from “both sides”, from each of the distinct\nraces of which they are mixed. Sometimes they are deemed weak or\ninferior just because they are mixed, as Naomi Zack documents\nin her Race and Mixed-Race (1993: chapters 11, 12). Indeed,\nDu Bois was himself personally deeply familiar with this issue, as he\nrelates, for instance, from his university days in Berlin. His\n“most interesting” professor there was Heinrich von\nTrietschke; \n[o]ne day he startled me by suddenly declaring during a lecture on\nAmerica: “Die Mulattin sind niedrig! Sie fuhlen sich\nniedrig!” [Mulattoes are inferior; they feel themselves\ninferior.] I felt as if he were pointing me out; but I presume he was\nquite unaware of my presence. However my presence or absence would\nhave made no difference to him. He was given to making extraordinary\nassertions out of a clear sky and evidently believing just what he\nsaid. My fellow students gave no evidence of connecting what he said\nwith me. (Du Bois 1968: 165)  \nIn the further course of his life, skin color—Du Bois’s\nown skin color—would be made an issue of by some who wanted to\nchallenge his positions and leadership or with whom he had ideological\ndisagreements—Marcus Garvey being a notable case in point (on\nthe Du Bois – Garvey contretemps, see Lewis 2000). \nYet when Du Bois formulated “double-consciousness” at the\nturn of the century, mixed-race and issues of what might be called\n“skin color anxiety” among black folk were not topics he\naddressed in print. There is virtually no consideration of such issues\nin Souls. The duality posited in the texts of 1903 is one\nbetween “Negro”—an identity keyed to a\nmetaphysically conceived racial designation—and\n“American”—one based on a putative citizenship\nstatus. Racial designation at that time was determined primarily\nthrough hypodescent, and the citizenship status of black folk was\nimpugned by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Jim Crow. But Du\nBois’s conception did not reference skin color discriminations\nwithin black racial designation. \nCommentators are agreed that while Du Bois names\n“double-consciousness” and uses the concept in his own way\nin that 1903 text, the term does not reappear in any of his\nsubsequent texts. That does not mean he abandons the concept, of\ncourse, but most of the commentary on his employment of the concept\nfocuses on the treatment of the issues it names in Souls.\nThere have been some attempts to interpret various of his other works\nin terms of the conception, but these tend to focus on his fictional\nwritings, and the use made of these is not primarily to develop the\nconception but rather to show its uses by Du Bois in other contexts.\nThroughout, the focus is always on the conception as it is presented\nin the “Strivings” text. This\nfact is due undoubtedly both to the canonical status of that 1903 text\nin African-American literature and social criticism—and in\nAfricana philosophy—and to the fact noted above that the term\n“double-consciousness” is used there alone. More than one\nwriter has asserted that the passage in which Du Bois presents the\nterm is the most-referenced text in all African-American letters. \nIt seems problematic, however, to pin a full-blown account of and\ntheoretical reconstruction on one passage in one work, however seminal\nor influential it may have been. So it may be useful to\nexamine several later texts of Du Bois’s to see if the claim\nsome commentators have made that Du Bois abandons the conception after\n1903 can be substantiated or if it can be challenged and the\nconception given further legs. There are discussions in later texts\nthat seem to involve aspects, at least, of the 1903 conception. \nWhile Du Bois does not present the “double-consciousness”\nconcept in so many words in Darkwater, published in 1920, the\nsecond chapter of that text, “The Souls of White Folks”,\nseems to involve something like the “second sight” of the\n“Strivings” text. In that\nchapter, Du Bois characterizes the development of what he calls\n“the religion of whiteness” and discusses its impact on\nsocial relations in the nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries.\nDu Bois seems to make a claim for a special kind of knowledge of the\npsychology of white people. He writes of himself that, about them,\n“I am singularly clairvoyant”. After specifying that his\nknowledge is not that of the foreigner, nor of the servant or the\nworker, he writes:  \nI see these souls undressed and from the back and sides. I see the\nworking of their entrails. I know their thoughts and they know that I\nknow. (Du Bois 1920: 17)  \nDu Bois here claims a “singular” insight into the psyches\nof white folk, one that depends in part on an awareness of the beliefs\nand attitudes of white folks of the kind that double-consciousness\ninvolves. But what Du Bois claims here also seems to go beyond the\n1903 conception, since that conception did not specifically and\nexplicitly refer to knowledge of the souls of white folks.\nSeveral pages into the “Souls of White Folks” chapter,\nafter identifying the “discovery of personal whiteness” as\nan historically recent phenomenon associated with “this new\nreligion of whiteness”, Du Bois indicates that it is black folk\ngenerally—“we”—who have such powers of\n“clairvoyance”: \nWe whose shame, humiliation and deep insult [the white man’s]\naggrandizement so often involved were never deceived. We looked at him\nclearly, with world-old eyes, and saw simply a human being, weak and\npitiable and cruel, even as we are and were. (1920: 20)  \nHere is a condition of consciousness that allows “the\nhumiliated” to see more clearly the reality of the lives of\nthose who humiliate them than the humiliators themselves can. This\ncondition of consciousness is a kind of\n“clairvoyance”—a capacity for knowledge that escapes\nthose who initiate the humiliation, who do not—and, perhaps,\ncannot—see themselves as clearly. While such knowledge does not\ninvolve “knowing the thoughts” of the humiliators in\ndetail, it does require that one know some patterns of\nwhat and how they think and feel. Du Bois is here considering the\nideology of white supremacy, tracing out the historical conditions of\nits development and some of the psychological consequences it has for\nwhites who accept it and live in and on the basis of it. To the extent\nthat whites accept the premises of white supremacy, and live and act\nupon them, they are deceived about themselves and act out a deception\nthat the blacks who are subject to them are in a position to see\nthrough. This is not the core of double-consciousness, though it seems\nto be the sort of thing Du Bois had in mind when he referred in 1903\nto “second sight”, a key adjunct to double-consciousness,\nin the “Strivings” passage.\nThis interpretation is brought out in Henry, Gordon, and Kirkland as\nwell. \nBut there is a bit more here, and other than, “second\nsight”. For what Du Bois presents in this chapter is a critical\nanalysis of the American ideology of white supremacy that is informed\nby historical understanding and backed up by social-scientific data.\nDu Bois both begins and ends the chapter by noting his own position\n“high in the tower”. This refers both to his distanced,\nobserver status relative to those who he is discussing, and to his own\nachieved position as an academically trained social\nscientist—indeed, one of the most highly trained minds in\nAmerica at the time—bringing his powers of analysis to bear on\nthe “souls of white folk”. Du Bois presents, if we take\nhim at his word, a case of scientifically-informed, nuanced historical\nanalysis built on a “clairvoyant” insight into the psyche\nof the white person “under the influence” of white\nsupremacist ideology, one predicated on both the second sight and\nideology-critique. \nThere is another passage later in Darkwater that bears, if\nsomewhat indirectly, on the notion of double-consciousness: \nPessimism is cowardice. The man who cannot frankly acknowledge the\n“Jim-Crow” car as a fact and yet live and hope is simply\nafraid either of himself or of the world. There is not in the world a\nmore disgraceful denial of brotherhood than the “Jim-Crow”\ncar of the Southern United States; but, too, just as true, there is\nnothing more beautiful in the universe than sunset and moonlight on\nMontego Bay in far Jamaica. And both things are true and both belong\nto this our world, and neither can be denied. (1920: 135)  \nThis passage is surely aimed against the debilitating effects of the\nfacts of life for Black folk in the Jim-Crow south. In it Du Bois\nurges the reader’s resistance against the submersion of her\ncherished ideal—equality qua\n“brotherhood”—by those brute facts of life. And that\nis resistance to the pernicious double consciousness that would bury\nour intimate self-understanding under a dominant white supremacist\nrationalization of racial inequality. Such resistance involves an\nexpanded, and expansive, conception of “this our world”,\none that owns the world in all its manifold, stunning, and appalling\ncomplexity.  \nDu Bois begins the essay, published in Crisis in September,\n1933, with a story about his grandfather, who indignantly rejected an\ninvitation to a “Negro” picnic:  \n[i]t meant close association with poverty, ignorance and suppressed\nand disadvantaged people, dirty and with bad manners. (Du Bois 1933: 199)  \nHe then succinctly captures the whole dilemma of this Negro upper\ncrust: \nbecause the upper colored group is desperately afraid of being\nrepresented before American whites by this lower group, or being\nmistaken for them, or being treated as though they were part of it,\nthey are pushed to the extreme of effort to avoid contact with the\npoorest classes of Negroes. This exaggerates, at once, the secret\nshame of being identified with such people and the anomaly of\ninsisting that the physical characteristics of these folk which the\nupper class shares, are not the stigmata of degradation. (1933: 199)  \nHere Du Bois explicitly draws out the intra-racial implications and\ngrounds of this aspect of double consciousness—what he\nidentifies as “being ashamed” of members of one’s\ngroup, and, thus, “indirectly”, of oneself. He also\nreiterates a theme that was apparent from the very beginning of his\nthinking about double-consciousness—its close connection to\ndivergent personal as well as political strategies for managing, and\nworking to transform, the conditions giving rise to it. He identified\nthese especially in the 1903 “Faith”\ntext, where he speaks both of\n“double classes” and of “pretense or revolt”,\n“hypocrisy or radicalism”. In the 1920 text, Du Bois notes\nthat such feelings of shame can motivate the strategy of “race\nsuicide”—“the attempt to escape from\nourselves”, as he describes assimilation. This attempt\ninvolves—and also is grounded in—“a drawing of class\nlines inside the Negro race” and “the emergence of a\ncertain social aristocracy” defined by\n“looks”—by which Du Bois presumably means\ncomplexion—as well as education, income, cultivation, and\naspiration. \nBut this class-based sense of shame is both impediment and adjunct of\nany strategy based on race pride and solidarity, as well, since such\nshame and embarrassment can present an obstacle to any concerted\npolitical action, which demands racial unity in common cause, and\nunder the leadership of the “talented tenth” of race\naristocrats, to be successful. While calling for efforts to “to\nbuild up a racial ethos”, Du Bois thus warns against too extreme\na version of such “propaganda for race pride”, counseling\nBlacks to avoid reproducing what he describes as a “superiority\ncomplex among the white and the yellow race”. \nThere is a discussion of what appears to be more or less the same\nphenomena in Du Bois’s book Dusk of Dawn, published in\n1940, two years after Du Bois turned seventy. Indeed, since Dusk\nof Dawn is more nearly autobiographical in design than\nSouls—its subtitle is An Essay Toward an\nAutobiography of a Race Concept—it’s not surprising\nthat Du Bois writes more expansively there of the experience of living\nin conditions of segregation and white supremacy, even though he\ndoesn’t use the term employed in Souls. But also, by\nthis time, his conception of race itself has opened up even further\nbeyond that of any linear historical development. As he writes at the\nend of the central chapter of that book, “The Concept of\nRace”,  \nIt had as I have tried to show all kinds of illogical trends and\nirreconcilable tendencies. Perhaps it is wrong to speak of it at all\nas “a concept” rather than as a group of contradictory\nforces, facts, and tendencies. (1940: 133) \nA number of things change in the account given by Du Bois in Dusk\nof Dawn of the phenomena that, in Souls, are brought\nunder the sign of double-consciousness. \nThe first is that the Dusk of Dawn treatment of the issues is\nsubsumed much more fully under a thematics of\n“environment”, articulated as social, geographical, and\ncultural in its dimensions and both dynamic and relatively stable in\nhistorical terms. Writing about “the facts of the Negro’s\ndouble environment”, Du Bois, characterizes the situation\nthus: \nThe Negro American has for his environment not only the white\nsurrounding world, but also, and touching him usually much more nearly\nand compellingly, is the environment furnished by his own colored\ngroup. There are exceptions, of course, but this is the rule. The\nAmerican Negro, therefore, is surrounded and conditioned by the\nconcept which he has of white people and he is treated in accordance\nwith the concept they have of him. On the other hand, so far as his\nown people are concerned, he is in direct contact with individuals and\nfacts. He fits into this environment more or less willingly. It gives\nhim a social world and mental peace. (1940: 173) \nHere the white world is “surrounding” the world of the\ncolored group with which the Negro individual is, as a rule, “in\ndirect contact”. This double environment is the basic reality,\noverwhelmingly, of the Negro in the 1940 text. This way of putting it\nis prefigured in the “Faith”\ntext of Souls, in which Du Bois writes of the “double\nlife” of Black folk and of the “worlds within and without\nthe Veil of Color”. What is only once formulated explicitly in\nSouls is given extensive treatment in Dusk of\nDawn. \nThis characterization of the situation also suggests that, while the\ninhabitants of the “white world” and the “colored\nworld” look at one other each through “the concept”\nthey have of one another, individuals within the “colored\nworld” know each other directly, being aware of\n“individuals and facts”. This is the impact of the veil,\nthe color line. Writing of his own personal experience, Du Bois\ndetails the effect of this environing white world on him: \nI was by long education and continual compulsion and daily reminder, a\ncolored man in a white world; and that white world often existed\nprimarily, so far as I was concerned, to see with sleepless vigilance\nthat I was kept within bounds. All this made me limited in physical\nmovement and provincial in thought and dream. I could not stir, I\ncould not act, I could not live, without taking into careful daily\naccount the reaction of my white environing world. (1940:\n135–6) \nNote here that in addition to the definite limitation of possibilities\nby this white world, there is also an active appropriation, and\nemployment in strategic thinking by Du Bois, of the understanding he\nhas of the white world. This suggests another mode in which\ndouble consciousness—that seems to be what we are dealing with\nhere—can operate. If double consciousness can also take the form\nof practical consciousness, one of “taking into careful\ndaily account” whites’ reactions—tinged as they are\nby prejudice, by expectations grounded in that prejudice—in\none’s plans, one’s own expectations, that would not\nnecessarily involve internalizing the prejudiced viewpoint itself,\nthough it might surely engender considerable disturbance of the soul.\nDouble consciousness would then be a practical, and affective, rather\nthan a strictly cognitive, impact of the environing conditions on the\nNegro soul. \nThere is also, indeed, according to the Dusk of Dawn account,\na further, more telling and insidious effect of the white world on the\nNegro soul, here exemplified by Du Bois:  \n… this fact of racial distinction based on color was the\ngreatest thing in my life and absolutely determined it, because this\nsurrounding group, in alliance and agreement with the white European\nworld, was settled and determined upon the fact that I was and must be\na thing apart. It was impossible to gainsay this. It was impossible\nfor any time and to any distance to withdraw myself and look down upon\nthese absurd assumptions with philosophical calm and humorous\nself-control. (1940: 136)  \nThe “absurd assumptions” can and often do infiltrate the\nNegro’s psyche, and affect how she thinks and feels about\nherself in ways that stubbornly resist her own efforts to override or\nundermine them. (Or else, perhaps, more rarely, they elicit fierce and\nabiding anger, even rage.) Writing in a less autobiographical vein, Du\nBois notes that despair of racial progress “too often”\nresults from the Negro’s “lack of faith in essential Negro\npossibilities parallel to similar attitudes on the part of the\nwhites”. This attitude itself is, he continues, “a natural\nphenomenon”, since Negroes share “average American culture\nand current American prejudices”. Because of this, it is  \nalmost impossible for a Negro boy trained in a white Northern high\nschool and a white college to come out with any high idea of his own\npeople or any abiding faith in what they can do. (1940: 191)  \nThis is Du Boisian double-consciousness as Gooding-Williams interprets\nit in Souls. \nBut the 1940 text never asserts a basic inner duality within the\nNegro: missing entirely from the Dusk of Dawn account is any\nmention of inward two-ness, of the psychic splitting that was so\ncrucial to the account given in Souls. In the later work the\nissue is characterized in the terminology of “Negro\nself-criticism” (1940: 179), a “lack of faith in essential\nNegro possibilities” (1940: 191), and the “inner\ncontradiction and frustration which [segregation and white racist\nintransigence] involves” (1940: 187)—a terminology that,\nwhile conveying the ambivalence and complexity of the treatment in the\nearlier text, falls far short of an assertion of an overriding psychic\nduality. And this is not because the text does not address the\n“felt experience” of being a Negro in America: a central,\nand the longest, chapter in Dusk of Dawn is devoted to\n“The Colored World Within”. \nThere are, “naturally”, problems with the unitary\nconsciousness of a soul within the double environment Du Bois depicts,\nbut these fall short of causing a split in the psyche itself. There is\nresentment, frustration, and anger verging on madness; there is a\nfaithlessness, and, often, consequent despair; there are the\ntemptations to turning one’s back on the folk, and also\ntemptations to reject absolutely anything the “environing”\nwhite world offers or proposes. And there is what Du Bois calls  \nthat bitter inner criticism of Negroes directed in upon themselves,\nwhich is widespread. It tends often to fierce, angry, contemptuous\njudgment of nearly all that Negroes do, say, and believe….\n(1940: 179)  \nBut what two-ness there is in the Dusk of Dawn account has\nbeen removed from the inwardness of souls, and is located instead in\nthe “environing” world. \nThere are two more important ways in which the Dusk of Dawn\naccount diverges from that of Souls. The first is that the\nbrute facticity of what Du Bois calls the “inferiority” of\nthe colored world is asserted in this text quite explicitly, and its\neffect upon the attitudes of Negroes described tellingly. Du Bois\npresents this stark reality as undeniable, while at the same time as\ncontrasted to the claims made by racist prejudice concerning black\nfolk, claims he takes the trouble to explicitly reject: \nIt is true, as I have argued, that Negroes are not inherently ugly nor\ncongenitally stupid. They are not naturally criminal and their poverty\nand ignorance today have clear and well-known and remediable causes.\nAll this is true: and yet what every colored man living today knows is\nthat by practical present measurements Negroes today are inferior to\nwhites. The white folk of the world are richer and more intelligent;\nthey live better; have better government; have better legal systems;\nhave built more impressive cities; larger systems of communication and\nthey control a larger part of the earth than all the colored peoples\ntogether. (1940: 173–4) \nBy invoking this set of what he regards as indubitable facts, Du Bois\nis naming historically contingent yet palpably certain realities that,\nhe claims, “every colored man living today knows”.\nConsequently, “Negro self-criticism” is, in part, grounded\nin “a perfectly obvious fact” (1940: 179), namely,\n“that most Negroes in the United States today occupy a low\ncultural status” and a “low social condition” (1940:\n180), which he specifies by immediately discussing “Negro\nignorance”, the death rate, “criminal tendencies”,\npoverty, and “social degradation”. These facts, it is\nworth emphasizing, are listed by Du Bois not as representations of\nwhite prejudice but as an essential acknowledgment of patent\nobservable realities. Though their causes, both present and past,\ncount against the prejudiced conclusions often drawn, the causes are\nless visible, so less obvious. But the facts on the ground cannot be\ndenied.  \nAnother important departure of the 1940 text from Souls is an\nexplicit recognition in the latter text that the psychic phenomena\nattributed to Negro Americans are not distinctive; as Du Bois writes,\n \n[s]imilar phenomena may be noticed always among undeveloped or\nsuppressed peoples or groups undergoing extraordinary experience. None\nhave more pitilessly castigated the Jews than the Jewish prophets,\nancient and modern. (1940: 179)  \nHe goes on to cite as further cases the Irish and the Germans of the\nSturm und Drang period. This is part of a broader recognition\nby Du Bois, one that he gives expression to explicitly only subsequent\nto Souls, that “the imprisoning of a human group with\nchains in the hands of an environing group” was not “a\nsingularly unusual characteristic of the Negro in the United States in\nthe nineteenth century”, but that “the majority of mankind\nhas struggled through this inner spiritual slavery…”\n(1940: 137). \nAny account of double consciousness rooted in the sweep of Du\nBois’s writings must acknowledge his taking it as both a state\nof consciousness of individual African-Americans as members of an\noppressed group and also as a form of social recognition of an entire\nsocial situation in which that group finds itself. Such an account\nmust, of course, confront the glaringly peculiar fact of the singular\nuse of the term by Du Bois despite his revisiting in his writing, on\nvarious occasions in different contexts of publication, what seems to\nbe an increasingly expansive repertoire of closely related\nphenomena. \nDu Bois gives up the moniker “double-consciousness” for a\nvariety of reasons, but at least in part because he wants to resist\nthe impression that this is simply and only a problem of\nconsciousness, unconnected with any palpable social facts. Also, as we\nhave seen, the close association of at least some of the original\nsenses of “double-consciousness”—as the term was\nused just before the turn of the twentieth century—with\npathological psychic states, may well have given Du Bois pause after\nhis initial use of the term. Part of what he wants to distance himself\nfrom is the idea—explicitly rejected in Dusk of\nDawn—that collectivities can be treated as entities with\ntheir own consciousnesses, reified in what he seems to have regarded\nas mistaken idealist theoretical overreach. Finally, Du Bois seems to\nhave opened up and expanded the range of phenomena related to double\nconsciousness beyond the exemplar in the 1903 texts. \nBut Du Bois did not characterize the matter succinctly in one place so\nas to embrace both all its effects on consciousness and affect\nand its reality as an “environing” condition.\nRather, he employs, alternately, two strategies of writing in trying\nto capture its fullness. He presents first- and third-personal\naccounts of “what it is like”, “spiritually”,\nto live in conditions of double consciousness, either through\nautobiographical writing or by personifying the feelings, attitudes,\nand thoughts associated with double consciousness in fictional or\ncomposite characters. And he also describes social environments along\nwith the “customs” and “irrational”,\n“subconscious” attitudes and modes of being characteristic\nof social groups living in those environments.  \nNear the end of his life, in the posthumously published\nAutobiography, Du Bois revisited his original formulation of\n“two-ness”: \nI began to feel that dichotomy which all my life has characterized my\nthought: how far can love for my oppressed race accord with love for\nthe oppressing country? And when these loyalties diverge, where shall\nmy soul find refuge? (1968: 169)  \nThis passage relates the young Du Bois’s feelings on observing\n“the pageantry and patriotism of Germany in 1892”. It is\nplainly autobiographical rather than programmatic, as are the\nSouls texts. This formulation in no way suggests anything\nlike a basic psychic split, but rather reflects an ambivalence, a\nconflict of affections and loyalties—but within an integral\nself. \nAll previous critical attention has been fixed steadily on the\nspiritual aspect of the phenomena of double consciousness, virtually\nnone on the environing conditions Du Bois saw as giving rise to it. The environing\nconditions might be summed up as \na social and political regime grounded in the maintenance of rigid\nsegregation in vastly unequal living conditions of social groups\nideologically identified as racially distinct and unequal, creating a\n“double environment” particularly for members of the\nsubordinate racial group.   \nThe spiritual correlate of these environing conditions would\ninclude some combination of at least some of these sorts of emergent\naspects: \nThis list, while including the sense of\n“double-consciousness” as Du Bois develops the idea in\nSouls (particularly the first three items), also expands the\nsense of “double consciousness” to include more active,\npractical, and critical appropriations of the situation established by\nthe color line.","contact.mail":"jpittman@jjay.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"jjay.cuny.edu"}]
