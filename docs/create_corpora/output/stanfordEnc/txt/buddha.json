These teachings, preserved in\ntexts known as the Nikāyas or Āgamas,\nconcern the quest for liberation from suffering. While the ultimate aim\nof the Buddha’s teachings is thus to help individuals attain the\ngood life, his analysis of the source of suffering centrally involves\nclaims concerning the nature of persons, as well as how we acquire\nknowledge about the world and our place in it. These teachings formed\nthe basis of a philosophical tradition that developed and defended a\nvariety of sophisticated theories in metaphysics and epistemology.\n\n\n\nThis entry concerns the historical individual, traditionally called\nGautama, who is identified by modern scholars as the founder of\nBuddhism. According to Buddhist teachings, there have been other\nBuddhas in the past, and there will be yet more in the future. The\ntitle ‘Buddha’, which literally means\n‘awakened’, is conferred on an individual who discovers the\npath to nirvana, the cessation of suffering, and propagates that\ndiscovery so that others may also achieve nirvana. If the teaching that\nthere have been other Buddhas is true, then Gautama is not the founder\nof Buddhism. This entry will follow modern scholarship in taking an\nagnostic stance on the question of whether there have been other\nBuddhas, and likewise for questions concerning the superhuman status\nand powers that some Buddhists attribute to Buddhas. The concern of\nthis entry is just those aspects of the thought of the historical\nindividual Gautama that bear on the development of the Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition. \n\nThe Buddha will here be treated as a philosopher. To so treat him is\ncontroversial, but before coming to why that should be so, let us first\nrehearse those basic aspects of the Buddha’s life and teachings\nthat are relatively non-controversial. Tradition has it that Gautama\nlived to age 80. Up until recently his dates were thought to be\napproximately 560–480 BCE, but many scholars now hold that he must have\ndied around 405 BCE. He was born into a family of some wealth and\npower, members of the Śākya clan, in the area of the present\nborder between India and Nepal. The story is that in early adulthood he\nabandoned his comfortable life as a householder (as well as his wife\nand young son) in order to seek a solution to the problem of\nexistential suffering. He first took up with a number of different\nwandering ascetics (śramanas) who claimed to know the\npath to liberation from suffering. Finding their teachings\nunsatisfactory, he struck out on his own, and through a combination of\ninsight and meditational practice attained the state of enlightenment\n(bodhi) which is said to represent the cessation of all\nfurther suffering. He then devoted the remaining 45 years of his life\nto teaching others the insights and techniques that had led him to this\nachievement. \n\nGautama could himself be classified as one of the\nśramanas. That there existed such a phenomenon as the\nśramanas tells us that there was some degree of\ndissatisfaction with the customary religious practices then prevailing\nin the Gangetic basin of North India. These practices consisted largely\nin the rituals and sacrifices prescribed in the Vedas. Among the\nśramanas there were many, including the Buddha, who\nrejected the authority of the Vedas as definitive pronouncements on the\nnature of the world and our place in it (and for this reason are called\n‘heterodox’). But within the Vedic canon itself there is a\nstratum of (comparatively late) texts, the Upaniṣads,\nthat likewise displays disaffection with Brahmin ritualism. Among the\nnew ideas that figure in these (‘orthodox’) texts, as well\nas in the teachings of those heterodox śramanas whose\ndoctrines are known to us, are the following: that sentient beings\n(including humans, non-human animals, gods, and the inhabitants of\nvarious hells) undergo rebirth; that rebirth is governed by the causal\nlaws of karma (good actions cause pleasant fruit for the agent, evil\nactions cause unpleasant fruit, etc.); that continual rebirth is\ninherently unsatisfactory; that there is an ideal state for sentient\nbeings involving liberation from the cycle of rebirth; and that\nattaining this state requires overcoming ignorance concerning\none’s true identity. Various views are offered concerning this\nignorance and how to overcome it. The Bhagavad Gītā\n(classified by some orthodox schools as an Upaniṣad)\nlists four such methods, and discusses at least two separate views\nconcerning our identity: that there is a plurality of distinct selves,\neach being the true agent of a person’s actions and the bearer of\nkarmic merit and demerit but existing separately from the body and its\nassociated states; and that there is just one self, of the nature of\npure consciousness (a ‘witness’) and identical with the\nessence of the cosmos, Brahman or pure undifferentiated Being. \n\nThe Buddha agreed with those of his contemporaries embarked on the\nsame soteriological project that it is ignorance about our identity\nthat is responsible for suffering. What sets his teachings apart (at\nthis level of analysis) lies in what he says that ignorance consists\nin: the conceit that there is an ‘I’ and a\n‘mine’. This is the famous Buddhist teaching of non-self\n(anātman). And it is with this teaching that the\ncontroversy begins concerning whether Gautama may legitimately be\nrepresented as a philosopher. First there are those who (correctly)\npoint out that the Buddha never categorically denies the existence of a\nself that transcends what is empirically given, namely the five\nskandhas or psychophysical elements. While the Buddha does\ndeny that any of the psychophysical elements is a self, these\ninterpreters claim that he at least leaves open the possibility that\nthere is a self that is transcendent in the sense of being\nnon-empirical. To this it may be objected that all of classical Indian\nphilosophy—Buddhist and orthodox alike—understood the\nBuddha to have denied the self tout court. To this it is\nsometimes replied that the later philosophical tradition simply got the\nBuddha wrong, at least in part because the Buddha sought to indicate\nsomething that cannot be grasped through the exercise of philosophical\nrationality. On this interpretation, the Buddha should be seen not as a\nproponent of the philosophical methods of analysis and argumentation,\nbut rather as one who sees those methods as obstacles to final\nrelease. \n\nAnother reason one sometimes encounters for denying that the Buddha\nis a philosopher is that he rejects the characteristically\nphilosophical activity of theorizing about matters that lack evident\npractical application. On this interpretation as well, those later\nBuddhist thinkers who did go in for the construction of theories about\nthe ultimate nature of everything simply failed to heed or properly\nappreciate the Buddha’s advice that we avoid theorizing for its\nown sake and confine our attention to those matters that are directly\nrelevant to liberation from suffering. On this view the teaching of\nnon-self is not a bit of metaphysics, just some practical advice to the\neffect that we should avoid identifying with things that are transitory\nand so bound to yield dissatisfaction. What both interpretations share\nis the assumption that it is possible to arrive at what the Buddha\nhimself thought without relying on the understanding of his teachings\ndeveloped in the subsequent Buddhist philosophical tradition. \n\nThis assumption may be questioned. Our knowledge of the\nBuddha’s teachings comes by way of texts that were not written\ndown until several centuries after his death, are in languages\n(Pāli, and Chinese translations of Sanskrit) other than the one he\nis likely to have spoken, and disagree in important respects. The first\ndifficulty may not be as serious as it seems, given that the\nBuddha’s discourses were probably rehearsed shortly after his\ndeath and preserved through oral transmission until the time they were\ncommitted to writing. And the second need not be insuperable either.\nBut the third is troubling, in that it suggests textual transmission\ninvolved processes of insertion and deletion in aid of one side or\nanother in sectarian disputes. Our ancient sources attest to this: one\nwill encounter a dispute among Buddhist thinkers where one side cites\nsome utterance of the Buddha in support of their position, only to have\nthe other side respond that the text from which the quotation is taken\nis not universally recognized as authoritatively the word of the\nBuddha. This suggests that our record of the Buddha’s teaching\nmay be colored by the philosophical elaboration of those teachings\npropounded by later thinkers in the Buddhist tradition. \n\nSome scholars are more sanguine than others about the possibility of\novercoming this difficulty, and thereby getting at what the Buddha\nhimself had thought, as opposed to what later Buddhist philosophers\nthought he had thought. No position will be taken on this dispute\nhere. We will be treating the Buddha’s thought as it was understood\nwithin the later philosophical tradition that he had inspired. The\nresulting interpretation may or may not be faithful to his\nintentions. It is at least logically possible that he believed there\nto be a transcendent self that can only be known by mystical\nintuition, or that the exercise of philosophical rationality leads\nonly to sterile theorizing and away from real emancipation. What we\ncan say with some assurance is that this is not how the Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition understood him. It is their understanding that\nwill be the subject of this essay. \n\nThe Buddha’s basic teachings are usually summarized using the\ndevice of the Four Noble Truths: \n\nThe first of these claims might seem obvious, even when\n‘suffering’ is understood to mean not mere pain but\nexistential suffering, the sort of frustration, alienation and despair\nthat arise out of our experience of transitoriness. But there are said\nto be different levels of appreciation of this truth, some quite subtle\nand difficult to attain; the highest of these is said to involve the\nrealization that everything is of the nature of suffering. Perhaps it\nis sufficient for present purposes to point out that while this is not\nthe implausible claim that all of life’s states and events are\nnecessarily experienced as unsatisfactory, still the realization that\nall (oneself included) is impermanent can undermine a precondition for\nreal enjoyment of the events in a life: that such events are meaningful\nby virtue of their having a place in an open-ended narrative. \n\nIt is with the development and elaboration of (2) that substantive\nphilosophical controversy begins. (2) is the simple claim that there\nare causes and conditions for the arising of suffering. (3) then makes\nthe obvious point that if the origination of suffering depends on\ncauses, future suffering can be prevented by bringing about the\ncessation of those causes. (4) specifies a set of techniques that are\nsaid to be effective in such cessation. Much then hangs on the correct\nidentification of the causes of suffering. The answer is traditionally\nspelled out in a list consisting of twelve links in a causal chain that\nbegins with ignorance and ends with suffering (represented by the\nstates of old age, disease and death). Modern scholarship has\nestablished that this list is a later compilation. For the texts that\nclaim to convey the Buddha’s own teachings give two slightly\ndifferent formulations of this list, and shorter formulations\ncontaining only some of the twelve items are also found in the texts.\nBut it seems safe to say that the Buddha taught an analysis of the\norigins of suffering roughly along the following lines: given the\nexistence of a fully functioning assemblage of psychophysical elements\n(the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the\nthree characteristics of sentient existence—suffering,\nimpermanence and non-self—will lead, in the course of normal\ninteractions with the environment, to appropriation (the identification\nof certain elements as ‘I’ and ‘mine’). This\nleads in turn to the formation of attachments, in the form of desire\nand aversion, and the strengthening of ignorance concerning the true\nnature of sentient existence. These ensure future rebirth, and thus\nfuture instances of old age, disease and death, in a potentially\nunending cycle. \n\nThe key to escape from this cycle is said to lie in realization of\nthe truth about sentient existence—that it is characterized by\nsuffering, impermanence and non-self. But this realization is not\neasily achieved, since acts of appropriation have already made desire,\naversion and ignorance deeply entrenched habits of mind. Thus the\nmeasures specified in (4) include various forms of training designed to\nreplace such habits with others that are more conducive to seeing\nthings as they are. Training in meditation is also prescribed, as a way\nof enhancing one’s observational abilities, especially with\nrespect to one’s own psychological states. Insight is cultivated\nthrough the use of these newly developed observational powers, as\ninformed by knowledge acquired through the exercise of philosophical\nrationality. There is a debate in the later tradition as to whether\nfinal release can be attained through theoretical insight alone,\nthrough meditation alone, or only by using both techniques.\nCh’an, for instance, is based on the premise that enlightenment\ncan be attained through meditation alone, whereas Theravāda\nadvocates using both but also holds that analysis alone may be\nsufficient for some. (This disagreement begins with a dispute over how\nto interpret D I.77–84.) The third option seems the most plausible, but\nthe first is certainly of some interest given its suggestion that one\ncan attain the ideal state for humans just by doing philosophy. \n\nThe Buddha seems to have held (2) to constitute the core of his\ndiscovery. He calls his teachings a ‘middle path’ between\ntwo extreme views, and it is this claim concerning the causal origins\nof suffering that he identifies as the key to avoiding those extremes.\nThe extremes are eternalism, the view that persons are eternal, and\nannihilationism, the view that persons go utterly out of existence\n(usually understood to mean at death, though a term still shorter than\none lifetime is not ruled out). It will be apparent that eternalism\nrequires the existence of the sort of self that the Buddha denies. What\nis not immediately evident is why the denial of such a self is not\ntantamount to the claim that the person is annihilated at death (or\neven sooner, depending on just how impermanent one takes the\npsychophysical elements to be). The solution to this puzzle lies in the\nfact that eternalism and annihilationism both share the presupposition\nthat there is an ‘I’ whose existence might either extend\nbeyond death or terminate at death. The idea of the ‘middle\npath’ is that all of life’s continuities can be explained\nin terms of facts about a causal series of psychophysical elements.\nThere being nothing more than a succession of these impermanent,\nimpersonal events and states, the question of the ultimate fate of this\n‘I’, the supposed owner of these elements, simply does not\narise. \n\nThis reductionist view of sentient beings was later articulated in\nterms of the distinction between two kinds of truth, conventional and\nultimate. Each kind of truth has its own domain of objects, the things\nthat are only conventionally real and the things that are ultimately\nreal respectively. Conventionally real entities are those things that\nare accepted as real by common sense, but that turn out on further\nanalysis to be wholes compounded out of simpler entities and thus not\nstrictly speaking real at all. The stock example of a conventionally\nreal entity is the chariot, which we take to be real only because it is\nmore convenient, given our interests and cognitive limitations, to have\na single name for the parts when assembled in the right way. Since our\nbelief that there are chariots is thus due to our having a certain\nuseful concept, the chariot is said to be a mere conceptual fiction.\n(This does not, however, mean that all conceptualization is\nfalsification; only concepts that allow of reductive analysis lead to\nthis artificial inflation of our ontology, and thus to a kind of\nerror.) Ultimately real entities are those ultimate parts into which\nconceptual fictions are analyzable. An ultimately true statement is one\nthat correctly describes how certain ultimately real entities are\narranged. A conventionally true statement is one that, given how the\nultimately real entities are arranged, would correctly describe certain\nconceptual fictions if they also existed. The ultimate truth concerning\nthe relevant ultimately real entities helps explain why it should turn\nout to be useful to accept conventionally true statements (such as\n‘King Milinda rode in a chariot’) when the objects\ndescribed in those statements are mere fictions. \n\nUsing this distinction between the two truths, the key insight of\nthe ‘middle path’ may be expressed as follows. The ultimate\ntruth about sentient beings is just that there is a causal series of\nimpermanent, impersonal psychophysical elements. Since these are all\nimpermanent, and lack other properties that would be required of an\nessence of the person, none of them is a self. But given the right\narrangement of such entities in a causal series, it is useful to think\nof them as making up one thing, a person. It is thus conventionally\ntrue that there are persons, things that endure for a lifetime and\npossibly (if there is rebirth) longer. This is conventionally true\nbecause generally speaking there is more overall happiness and less\noverall pain and suffering when one part of such a series identifies\nwith other parts of the same series. For instance, when the present set\nof psychophysical elements identifies with future elements, it is less\nlikely to engage in behavior (such as smoking) that results in present\npleasure but far greater future pain. The utility of this convention\nis, however, limited. Past a certain point—namely the point at\nwhich we take it too seriously, as more than just a useful\nfiction—it results in existential suffering. The cessation of\nsuffering is attained by extirpating all sense of an ‘I’\nthat serves as agent and owner. \n\nThe Buddha’s ‘middle path’ strategy can be seen as\none of first arguing that there is nothing that the word\n‘I’ genuinely denotes, and then explaining that our\nerroneous sense of an ‘I’ stems from our employment of the\nuseful fiction represented by the concept of the person. While the\nsecond part of this strategy only receives its full articulation in the\nlater development of the theory of two truths, the first part can be\nfound in the Buddha’s own teachings, in the form of several\nphilosophical arguments for non-self. Best known among these is the\nargument from impermanence (S III.66–8), which has this basic\nstructure: \n\nIt is the fact that this argument does not contain a premise\nexplicitly asserting that the five skandhas (classes of\npsychophysical element) are exhaustive of the constituents of persons,\nplus the fact that these are all said to be empirically observable,\nthat leads some to claim that the Buddha did not intend to deny the\nexistence of a self tout court. There is, however, evidence\nthat the Buddha was generally hostile toward attempts to establish the\nexistence of unobservable entities. In the Pohapāda Sutta (D\nI.178–203), for instance, the Buddha compares someone who posits an\nunseen seer in order to explain our introspective awareness of\ncognitions, to a man who has conceived a longing for the most beautiful\nwoman in the world based solely on the thought that such a woman must\nsurely exist. And in the Tevijja Sutta (D I.235–52), the Buddha rejects\nthe claim of certain Brahmins to know the path to oneness with Brahman,\non the grounds that no one has actually observed this Brahman. This\nmakes more plausible the assumption that the argument has as an\nimplicit premise the claim that there is no more to the person than the\nfive skandhas. \n\nPremise (1) appears to be based on the assumption that persons\nundergo rebirth, together with the thought that one function of a self\nwould be to account for diachronic personal identity. By\n‘permanent’ is here meant continued existence over at least\nseveral lives. This is shown by the fact that the Buddha rules out the\nbody as a self on the grounds that the body exists for just one\nlifetime. (This also demonstrates that the Buddha did not mean by\n‘impermanent’ what some later Buddhist philosophers meant,\nviz., existing for just a moment; the Buddhist doctrine of\nmomentariness represents a later development.) The mental entities that\nmake up the remaining four types of psychophysical element might seem\nlike more promising candidates, but these are ruled out on the grounds\nthat these all originate in dependence on contact between sense faculty\nand object, and last no longer than a particular sense-object-contact\nevent. That he listed five kinds of psychophysical element, and not\njust one, shows that the Buddha embraced a kind of dualism. But this\nstrategy for demonstrating the impermanence of the psychological\nelements shows that his dualism was not the sort of mind-body dualism\nfamiliar from substance ontologies like those of Descartes and of the\nNyāya school of orthodox Indian philosophy. Instead of seeing the\nmind as the persisting bearer of such transient events as occurrences\nof cognition, feeling and volition, he treats ‘mind’ as a\nkind of aggregate term for bundles of transient mental events. These\nevents being impermanent, they too fail to account for diachronic\npersonal identity in the way in which a self might be expected to. \n\nAnother argument for non-self, which might be called the argument\nfrom control (S III.66–8), has this structure: \n\nPremise (1) is puzzling. It appears to presuppose that the self\nshould have complete control over itself, so that it would effortlessly\nadjust its state to its desires. That the self should be thought of as\nthe locus of control is certainly plausible. Those Indian\nself-theorists who claim that the self is a mere passive witness\nrecognize that the burden of proof is on them to show that the self is\nnot an agent. But it seems implausibly demanding to require of\nthe self that it have complete control over itself. We do not require\nthat vision see itself if it is to see other things. The case of vision\nsuggests an alternative interpretation, however. We might hold that\nvision does not see itself for the reason that this would violate an\nirreflexivity principle, to the effect that an entity cannot operate on\nitself. Indian philosophers who accept this principle cite supportive\ninstances such as the knife that cannot cut itself and the finger-tip\nthat cannot touch itself. If this principle is accepted, then if the\nself were the locus of control it would follow that it could never\nexercise this function on itself. A self that was the controller could\nnever find itself in the position of seeking to change its state to one\nthat it deemed more desirable. On this interpretation, the first\npremise seems to be true. And there is ample evidence that (2) is\ntrue: it is difficult to imagine a bodily or psychological state\nover which one might not wish to exercise control. Consequently, given\nthe assumption that the person is wholly composed of the psychophysical\nelements, it appears to follow that a self of this description does not\nexist. \n\nThese two arguments appear, then, to give good reason to deny a self\nthat might ground diachronic personal identity and serve as locus of\ncontrol, given the assumption that there is no more to the person than\nthe empirically given psychophysical elements. But it now becomes\nsomething of a puzzle how one is to explain diachronic personal\nidentity and agency. To start with the latter, does the argument from\ncontrol not suggest that control must be exercised by something other\nthan the psychophysical elements? This was precisely the conclusion of\nthe Sāṃkhya school of orthodox Indian philosophy. One of\ntheir arguments for the existence of a self was that it is possible to\nexercise control over all the empirically given constituents of the\nperson; while they agree with the Buddha that a self is never observed,\nthey take the phenomena of agency to be grounds for positing a self\nthat transcends all possible experience. \n\nThis line of objection to the Buddha’s teaching of non-self is\nmore commonly formulated in response to the argument from impermanence,\nhowever. Perhaps its most dramatic form is aimed at the Buddha’s\nacceptance of the doctrines of karma and rebirth. It is clear that the\nbody ceases to exist at death. And given the Buddha’s argument\nthat mental states all originate in dependence on sense-object contact\nevents, it seems no psychological constituent of the person can\ntransmigrate either. Yet the Buddha claims that persons who have not\nyet achieved enlightenment will be reborn as sentient beings of some\nsort after they die. If there is no constituent whatever that moves\nfrom one life to the next, how could the being in the next life be the\nsame person as the being in this life? This question becomes all the\nmore pointed when it is added that rebirth is governed by karma,\nsomething that functions as a kind of cosmic justice: those born into\nfortunate circumstances do so as a result of good deeds in prior lives,\nwhile unpleasant births result from evil past deeds. Such a system of\nreward and punishment could be just only if the recipient of pleasant\nor unpleasant karmic fruit is the same person as the agent of the good\nor evil action. And the opponent finds it incomprehensible how this\ncould be so in the absence of a persisting self. \n\nIt is not just classical Indian self-theorists who have found this\nobjection persuasive. Some Buddhists have as well. Among these\nBuddhists, however, this has led to the rejection not of non-self but\nof rebirth. (Historically this response was not unknown among East\nAsian Buddhists, and it is not rare among Western Buddhists today.) The\nevidence that the Buddha himself accepted rebirth and karma seems quite\nstrong, however. The later tradition would distinguish between two\ntypes of discourse in the body of the Buddha’s teachings: those\nintended for an audience of householders seeking instruction from a\nsage, and those intended for an audience of monastic renunciates\nalready versed in his teachings. And it would be one thing if his use\nof the concepts of karma and rebirth were limited to the former. For\nthen such appeals could be explained away as another instance of the\nBuddha’s pedagogical skill (commonly referred to as\nupāya). The idea would be that householders who fail to\ncomply with the most basic demands of morality are not likely (for\nreasons to be discussed shortly) to make significant progress toward\nthe cessation of suffering, and the teaching of karma and rebirth, even\nif not strictly speaking true, does give those who accept it a\n(prudential) reason to be moral. But this sort of ‘noble\nlie’ justification for the Buddha teaching a doctrine he does not\naccept fails in the face of the evidence that he also taught it to\nquite advanced monastics (e.g., A III.33). And what he taught is not\nthe version of karma popular in certain circles today, according to\nwhich, for instance, an act done out of hatred makes the agent somewhat\nmore disposed to perform similar actions out of similar motives in the\nfuture, which in turn makes negative experiences more likely for the\nagent. What the Buddha teaches is instead the far stricter view that\neach action has its own specific consequence for the agent, the hedonic\nnature of which is determined in accordance with causal laws and in\nsuch a way as to require rebirth as long as action continues. So if\nthere is a conflict between the doctrine of non-self and the teaching\nof karma and rebirth, it is not to be resolved by weakening the\nBuddha’s commitment to the latter. \n\nThe Sanskrit term karma literally means\n‘action’. What is nowadays referred to somewhat loosely as\nthe theory of karma is, speaking more strictly, the view that there is\na causal relationship between action (karma) and\n‘fruit’ (phala), the latter being an experience of\npleasure, pain or indifference for the agent of the action. This is the\nview that the Buddha appears to have accepted in its most\nstraightforward form. Actions are said to be of three types: bodily,\nverbal and mental. The Buddha insists, however, that by action is meant\nnot the movement or change involved, but rather the volition or\nintention that brought about the change. As Gombrich (2009) points out,\nthe Buddha’s insistence on this point reflects the transition\nfrom an earlier ritualistic view of action to a view that brings action\nwithin the purview of ethics. For it is when actions are seen as\nsubject to moral assessment that intention becomes relevant. One does\nnot, for instance, perform the morally blameworthy action of speaking\ninsultingly to an elder just by making sounds that approximate to the\npronunciation of profanities in the presence of an elder; parrots and\nprelinguistic children can do as much. What matters for moral\nassessment is the mental state (if any) that produced the bodily,\nverbal or mental change. And it is the occurrence of these mental\nstates that is said to cause the subsequent occurrence of hedonically\ngood, bad and neutral experiences. More specifically, it is the\noccurrence of the three ‘defiled’ mental states that brings\nabout karmic fruit. The three defilements (kleśas) are\ndesire, aversion and ignorance. And we are told quite specifically (A\nIII.33) that actions performed by an agent in whom these three\ndefilements have been destroyed do not have karmic consequences; such\nan agent is experiencing their last birth. \n\nSome caution is required in understanding this claim about the\ndefilements. The Buddha seems to be saying that it is possible to act\nnot only without ignorance, but also in the absence of desire or\naversion, yet it is difficult to see how there could be intentional\naction without some positive or negative motivation. To see one’s\nway around this difficulty, one must realize that by\n‘desire’ and ‘aversion’ are meant those\npositive and negative motives respectively that are colored by\nignorance, viz. ignorance concerning suffering, impermanence and\nnon-self. Presumably the enlightened person, while knowing the truth\nabout these matters, can still engage in motivated action. Their\nactions are not based on the presupposition that there is an\n‘I’ for which those actions can have significance.\nIgnorance concerning these matters perpetuates rebirth, and thus\nfurther occasions for existential suffering, by facilitating a\nmotivational structure that reinforces one’s ignorance. We can\nnow see how compliance with common-sense morality could be seen as an\ninitial step on the path to the cessation of suffering. While the\npresence of ignorance makes all action—even that deemed morally\ngood—karmically potent, those actions commonly considered morally\nevil are especially powerful reinforcers of ignorance, in that they\nstem from the assumption that the agent’s welfare is of paramount\nimportance. While recognition of the moral value of others may still\ninvolve the conceit that there is an ‘I’, it can\nnonetheless constitute progress toward dissolution of the sense of\nself. \n\nThis excursus into what the Buddha meant by karma may help us see\nhow his middle path strategy could be used to reply to the objection to\nnon-self from rebirth. That objection was that the reward and\npunishment generated by karma across lives could never be deserved in\nthe absence of a transmigrating self. The middle path strategy\ngenerally involves locating and rejecting an assumption shared by a\npair of extreme views. In this case the views will be (1) that the\nperson in the later life deserves the fruit generated by the action in\nthe earlier life, and (2) that this person does not deserve the fruit.\nOne assumption shared by (1) and (2) is that persons deserve reward and\npunishment depending on the moral character of their actions, and one\nmight deny this assumption. But that would be tantamount to moral\nnihilism, and a middle path is said to avoid nihilisms (such as\nannihilationism). A more promising alternative might be to deny that\nthere are ultimately such things as persons that could bear moral\nproperties like desert. This is what the Buddha seems to mean when he\nasserts that the earlier and the later person are neither the same nor\ndifferent (S II.62; S II.76; S II.113). Since any two existing things\nmust be either identical or distinct, to say of the two persons that\nthey are neither is to say that strictly speaking they do not\nexist. \n\nThis alternative is more promising because it avoids moral nihilism.\nFor it allows one to assert that persons and their moral properties are\nconventionally real. To say this is to say that given our interests and\ncognitive limitations, we do better at achieving our\naim—minimizing overall pain and suffering—by acting as\nthough there are persons with morally significant properties.\nUltimately there are just impersonal entities and events in causal\nsequence: ignorance, the sorts of desires that ignorance facilitates,\nan intention formed on the basis of such a desire, a bodily, verbal or\nmental action, a feeling of pleasure, pain or indifference, and an\noccasion of suffering. The claim is that this situation is usefully\nthought of as, for instance, a person who performs an evil deed due to\ntheir ignorance of the true nature of things, receives the unpleasant\nfruit they deserve in the next life, and suffers through their\ncontinuing on the wheel of saṃsāra. It is useful to think of\nthe situation in this way because it helps us locate the appropriate\nplaces to intervene to prevent future pain (the evil deed) and future\nsuffering (ignorance). \n\nIt is no doubt quite difficult to believe that karma and rebirth\nexist in the form that the Buddha claims. It is said that their\nexistence can be confirmed by those who have developed the power of\nretrocognition through advanced yogic technique. But this is of little\nhelp to those not already convinced that meditation is a reliable means\nof knowledge. What can be said with some assurance is that karma and\nrebirth are not inconsistent with non-self. Rebirth without\ntransmigration is logically possible. \n\nWhen the Buddha says that a person in one life and the person in\nanother life are neither the same nor different, one’s first\nresponse might be to take ‘different’ to mean something\nother than ‘not the same’. But while this is possible in\nEnglish given the ambiguity of ‘the same’, it is not\npossible in the Pāli source, where the Buddha is represented as\nunambiguously denying both numerical identity and numerical\ndistinctness. This has led some to wonder whether the Buddha does not\nemploy a deviant logic. Such suspicions are strengthened by those cases\nwhere the options are not two but four, cases of the so-called\ntetralemma (catuṣkoṭi). For instance, when the\nBuddha is questioned about the post-mortem status of the enlightened\nperson or arhat (e.g., at M I.483–8) the possibilities\nare listed as: (1) the arhat continues to exist after death,\n(2) does not exist after death, (3) both exists and does not exist\nafter death, and (4) neither exists nor does not exist after death.\nWhen the Buddha rejects both (1) and (2) we get a repetition of\n‘neither the same nor different’. But when he goes on to\nentertain, and then reject, (3) and (4) the logical difficulties are\ncompounded. Since each of (3) and (4) appears to be formally\ncontradictory, to entertain either is to entertain the possibility that\na contradiction might be true. And their denial seems tantamount to\naffirmation of excluded middle, which is prima facie\nincompatible with the denial of both (1) and (2). One might wonder\nwhether we are here in the presence of the mystical. \n\nThere were some Buddhist philosophers who took ‘neither the\nsame nor different’ in this way. These were the Personalists\n(Pudgalavādins), who were so called because they affirmed\nthe ultimate existence of the person as something named and\nconceptualized in dependence on the psychophysical elements. They\nclaimed that the person is neither identical with nor distinct from the\npsychophysical elements. They were prepared to accept, as a\nconsequence, that nothing whatever can be said about the relation\nbetween person and elements. But their view was rejected by most\nBuddhist philosophers, in part on the grounds that it quickly leads to\nan ineffability paradox: one can say neither that the person’s\nrelation to the elements is inexpressible, nor that it is not\ninexpressible. The consensus view was instead that the fact that the\nperson can be said to be neither identical with nor distinct from the\nelements is grounds for taking the person to be a mere conceptual\nfiction. Concerning the persons in the two lives, they understood the\nnegations involved in ‘neither the same nor different’ to\nbe of the commitmentless variety, i.e., to function like illocutionary\nnegation. If we agree that the statement ‘7 is green’ is\nsemantically ill-formed, on the grounds that abstract objects such as\nnumbers do not have colors, then we might go on to say, ‘Do not\nsay that 7 is green, and do not say that it is not green either’.\nThere is no contradiction here, since the illocutionary negation\noperator ‘do not say’ generates no commitment to an\nalternative characterization. \n\nThere is also evidence that claims of type (3) involve\nparameterization. For instance, the claim about the arhat\nwould be that there is some respect in which they can be said to exist\nafter death, and some other respect in which they can be said to no\nlonger exist after death. Entertaining such a proposition does not\nrequire that one believe there might be true contradictions. And while\nclaims of type (4) would seem to be logically equivalent to those of\ntype (3) (regardless of whether or not they involve parameterization),\nthe tradition treated this type as asserting that the subject is beyond\nall conceptualization. To reject the type (4) claim about the\narhat is to close off one natural response to the rejections\nof the first three claims: that the status of the arhat after\ndeath transcends rational understanding. That the Buddha rejected all\nfour possibilities concerning this and related questions is not\nevidence that he employed a deviant logic. \n\nThe Buddha’s response to questions like those concerning the\narhat is sometimes cited in defense of a different claim about\nhis attitude toward rationality. This is the claim that the Buddha was\nessentially a pragmatist, someone who rejects philosophical theorizing\nfor its own sake and employs philosophical rationality only to the\nextent that doing so can help solve the practical problem of\neliminating suffering. The Buddha does seem to be embracing something\nlike this attitude when he defends his refusal to answer questions like\nthat about the arhat, or whether the series of lives has a\nbeginning, or whether the living principle (jīva) is\nidentical with the body. He calls all the possible views with respect\nto such questions distractions insofar as answering them would not lead\nto the cessation of the defilements and thus to the end of suffering.\nAnd in a famous simile (M I.429) he compares someone who insists that\nthe Buddha answer these questions to someone who has been wounded by an\narrow but will not have the wound treated until they are told who shot\nthe arrow, what sort of wood the arrow is made of, and the like. \n\nPassages such as these surely attest to the great importance the\nBuddha placed on sharing his insights to help others overcome\nsuffering. But this is consistent with the belief that philosophical\nrationality may be used to answer questions that lack evident\nconnection with pressing practical concerns. And on at least one\noccasion the Buddha does just this. Pressed to give his answers to the\nquestions about the arhat and the like, the Buddha first\nrejects all the possibilities of the tetralemma, and defends his\nrefusal on the grounds that such theories are not conducive to\nliberation from saṃsāra. But when his questioner\nshows signs of thereby losing confidence in the value of the\nBuddha’s teachings about the path to the cessation of suffering,\nthe Buddha responds with the example of a fire that goes out after\nexhausting its fuel. If one were asked where this fire has gone, the\nBuddha points out, one could consistently deny that it has gone to the\nnorth, to the south, or in any other direction. This is so for the\nsimple reason that the questions ‘Has it gone to the\nnorth?’, ‘Has it gone to the south?’, etc., all share\nthe false presupposition that the fire continues to exist. Likewise the\nquestions about the arhat and the like all share the false\npresupposition that there is such a thing as a person who might either\ncontinue to exist after death, cease to exist at death, etc. (Anālayo 2018, 41) The\ndifficulty with these questions is not that they try to extend\nphilosophical rationality beyond its legitimate domain, as the\nhandmaiden of soteriologically useful practice. It is rather that they\nrest on a false presupposition—something that is disclosed\nthrough the employment of philosophical rationality. \n\nA different sort of challenge to the claim that the Buddha valued\nphilosophical rationality for its own sake comes from the role played\nby authority in Buddhist soteriology. For instance, in the Buddhist\ntradition one sometimes encounters the claim that only enlightened\npersons such as the Buddha can know all the details of karmic\ncausation. And to the extent that the moral rules are thought to be\ndetermined by the details of karmic causation, this might be taken to\nmean that our knowledge of the moral rules is dependent on the\nauthority of the Buddha. Again, the subsequent development of Buddhist\nphilosophy seems to have been constrained by the need to make theory\ncompatible with certain key claims of the Buddha. For instance, one\nschool developed an elaborate form of four-dimensionalism, not because\nof any deep dissatisfaction with presentism, but because they believed\nthe non-existence of the past and the future to be incompatible with\nthe Buddha’s alleged ability to cognize past and future events.\nAnd some modern scholars go so far as to wonder whether non-self\nfunctions as anything more than a sort of linguistic taboo against the\nuse of words like ‘I’ and ‘self’ in the\nBuddhist tradition (Collins 1982: 183). The suggestion is that just as\nin some other religious traditions the views of the founder or the\nstatements of scripture trump all other considerations, including any\nviews arrived at through the free exercise of rational inquiry, so in\nBuddhism as well there can be at best only a highly constrained arena\nfor the deployment of philosophical rationality. \n\nNow it could be that while this is true of the tradition that\ndeveloped out of the Buddha’s teachings, the Buddha himself held\nthe unfettered use of rationality in quite high esteem. This would seem\nto conflict with what he is represented as saying in response to the\nreport that he arrived at his conclusions through reasoning and\nanalysis alone: that such a report is libelous, since he possesses a\nnumber of superhuman cognitive powers (M I.68). But at least some\nscholars take this passage to be not the Buddha’s own words but\nan expression of later devotionalist concerns (Gombrich 2009: 164).\nIndeed one does find a spirited discussion within the tradition\nconcerning the question whether the Buddha is omniscient, a discussion\nthat may well reflect competition between Buddhism and those\nBrahmanical schools that posit an omniscient creator. And at\nleast for the most part the Buddhist tradition is careful not to\nattribute to the Buddha the sort of omniscience usually ascribed to an\nall-perfect being: the actual cognition, at any one time, of all\ntruths. Instead a Buddha is said to be omniscient only in the much\nweaker sense of always having the ability to cognize any individual\nfact relevant to the soteriological project, viz. the details of their\nown past lives, the workings of the karmic causal laws, and whether a\ngiven individual’s defilements have been extirpated. Moreover,\nthese abilities are said to be ones that a Buddha acquires through a\nspecific course of training, and thus ones that others may reasonably\naspire to as well. The attitude of the later tradition seems to be that\nwhile one could discover the relevant facts on one’s own, it\nwould be more reasonable to take advantage of the fact that the Buddha\nhas already done all the epistemic labor involved. When we arrive in a\nnew town we could always find our final destination through trial and\nerror, but it would make more sense to ask someone who already knows\ntheir way about. \n\nThe Buddhist philosophical tradition grew out of earlier efforts to\nsystematize the Buddha’s teachings. Within a century or two of\nthe death of the Buddha, exegetical differences led to debates\nconcerning the Buddha’s true intention on some matter, such as\nthat between the Personalists and others over the status of the person.\nWhile the parties to these debates use many of the standard tools and\ntechniques of philosophy, they were still circumscribed by the\nassumption that the Buddha’s views on the matter at hand are\nauthoritative. In time, however, the discussion widened to include\ninterlocutors representing various Brahmanical systems. Since the\nlatter did not take the Buddha’s word as authoritative, Buddhist\nthinkers were required to defend their positions in other ways. The\nresulting debate (which continued for about nine centuries) touched on\nmost of the topics now considered standard in metaphysics, epistemology\nand philosophy of language, and was characterized by considerable\nsophistication in philosophical methodology. What the Buddha would have\nthought of these developments we cannot say with any certainty. What we\ncan say is that many Buddhists have believed that the unfettered\nexercise of philosophical rationality is quite consistent with his\nteachings.","contact.mail":"msideri@ilstu.edu","contact.domain":"ilstu.edu"}]
