Written at the request of\nthe Council of Universities of the Provincial Government of Quebec on\nthe state of knowledge in the contemporary world, this work brought\nthe term “postmodernism”, already in use in other fields,\nsuch as the arts and literature, to the forefront of debates in\nWestern philosophy, especially when published in English in 1984. The\nbook was more prescient than realized at the time, as described below,\nthough soon critics of Continental philosophy used the term\n“postmodernism” to hold together a variety of thinkers\noften at odds with one another (Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault,\nJacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and so on). These critics argued that\npostmodernists believed that were no such things as\n“facts”, only modes of discourse that forever block us\nfrom making truth claims about reality, and the term\n“postmodern” became a pejorative term to deride these\nthinkers as adhering to epistemological and moral nihilism. While\nLyotard was surely interested in the postmodern loss of\n“metanarratives”—traditional means by which we order\nworld—his works, especially after The Postmodern\nCondition, considered ways to think of justice after the loss of\nthese metanarratives. In works such as Just Gaming (1979) and\nespecially his masterwork, The Differend (1983), Lyotard\noffers not an “anything goes” relativism, but rather takes\nup the historical fact that after the Shoah, there is no longer a\nbelief in the progress of history, à la G. W. F. Hegel\n(1770–1831) (and even more so today, when polls all over the\nWest show that many believe the next generation will be worse off than\nthe last) while there is also what Hannah Arendt (1906–1975)\ncalled a general “loss of authority” in traditional\ninstitutions. Hence both progressive and conservative political views\nare found flailing in diagnosing the problems of the political,\nespecially when facing the devaluation of all values in consumer\nculture. The range of Lyotard’s works were not limited to\ndiagnosing the politics of postmodernity, but also made important\ncontributions to aesthetics, the philosophy of science, and the\nphilosophy of language, among other areas.\n\nBorn in Vincennes, France on August 10, 1924, Jean-François\nLyotard was the son of Jean-Pierre Lyotard, a salesman. As he reports\nin an autobiographical essay that opens Peregrinations: Law, Form,\nEvent (1988), while schooling in Paris lycées, he had\ndreams of becoming a Dominican monk, a novelist, a painter, or even a\nhistorian. During the second world war, he acted as a medic during the\nliberation of Paris and he became a father soon after studying\nliterature and philosophy at the Sorbonne University in Paris (he\nfailed entrance twice into the more prestigious École Normale\nSupériour), which certainly cut off any dreams of becoming a\nmonk. As for being a novelist or artist, he says he had an\n“unfortunate lack of talent”, and an “obvious\nweakness of memory” meant he could never be a good historian\n(Peregrinations, 1–2). He met Gilles Deleuze\n(1925–1995) while studying at the Sorbonne and his work would\nlater influence Lyotard’s Libidinal Economy (1974). Lyotard\nproduced an M.A. dissertation, “Indifference as an Ethical\nNotion”, whose central belief in indifference he would spend his\ncareer repudiating. In 1954, he would publish a study on phenomenology\n(a textbook treatment that would go through some ten editions) and\nbecame a philosophy professor at a lycée in Constantine, the\ncapital of the French department of East Algeria, having passed the\nagrégation that enabled him to do so\n(Peregrinations, 2). Lyotard came to Algeria at a propitious\ntime: near start of the Algerian revolution that would ultimately\nliberate the country from France in 1962, the colony had a\nrevolutionary air that he inhaled in full. After his arrival, Lyotard\nimmersed himself in the works of Marx while updating himself on the\nAlgerian situation. As the revolution began in 1954, Lyotard joined\nSocialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarism), which also\nincluded Claude Lefort (1924–2010) and Cornelius Castoriadis\n(1922–1997), important political thinkers in their own right.\nLyotard became an astute and strident political militant over the next\nfifteen years, writing works that would later be collected in\nPolitical Writings (1993). He edited and wrote for\nSocialisme ou Barbarie’s journal as well as leaflets\ngiven to protesters and union workers, and this work left him little\ntime for academic philosophy (“Resisting a Discourse of\nMastery”, 174). He returned to Paris in 1959, becoming until\n1966 a maître-assistant at the Sorbonne, when he\nfinally gained a position in the philosophy department at the\nUniversity of Paris X, Nanterre. In 1964, he broke with Socialisme\nou Barbarie, joining Pouvoir Ouvrier (Worker’s\nPower), quitting that splinter group two years later and, as often\nhappens on the French left, losing many of his closest friends along\nthe way as his distance from Marxism became clear. Around the same\ntime, he began to attend the seminars of the French psychoanalyst\nJacques Lacan (1901–1981). This was an important moment as\nLyotard lost faith in the all-encompassing philosophy of Marxism,\nwhich offered, especially in the variant of the French Communist\nParty, a single key to history and its end. This loss of faith in\nMarxism’s “metanarrative” would expand to encompass\nall those available in modernity, a fact that would come to mark all\nhis remaining writings. This didn’t keep him from participating\nin the events of May 1968, helping to organize the March 22 movement\nin Nanterre. Three years later he would publish Discourse,\nFigure (1971), earning him the degree of doctorat\nd’état. In light of the revolts of 1968, the French\ngovernment set up a radical university in Vincennes, which Lyotard\nwould join, becoming maître de conferences. Two years\nlater, he published a work he later dubbed “my evil book”,\nLibidinal Economy (Peregrinations, 13). This work\nremains an important thinking of immanence and what a body politic\nwould be like if reduced only to its libidinal pleasures and the\nblockages that make institutions possible. That Lyotard would later\nrepudiate this difficult and complex work should say much to those who\nwould reduce him to advocating a postmodern pastiche where any\npleasure is good as long as it provides some intensity of feeling. In\n1979, he would publish The Postmodern Condition, which was\ninstantly taken as emblematic of what was underway in the West, right\nor wrong. Many would take up his call, as he put it in the book, to\n“wage a war on totality; let us be witnesses to the\nunpresentable; let us activate the differences and save the honor of\nthe name” (Postmodern Condition, 82). The work was both\ndescriptive of what we today would dub neoliberalism’s\nfunctionalization of knowledge—what can be known has value only\ninsofar as it can increase the future economic productivity of the\nresearcher or student—and prescriptive that the loss of\nmetanarratives should be underway. With the fame gained from\nthis book, Lyotard would go on to lecture all over the world, while\nacting as a major contributor to the Collège International de\nPhilosophie in Paris. In 1979 and 1983, he published Au juste\n(translated as Just Gaming) and The Differend,\nrespectively, two works that remain important to anyone thinking a\npostmodern politics. His later works, such as The Inhuman\n(1988) and Soundproof Room: Malraux’s Anti-aesthetics\n(1998), concentrated on aesthetics, an enduring theme as early as the\n1970s, but always while extending conclusions he reached in The\nDifferend. In April 1998, Lyotard died of leukemia in Paris. \nLyotard’s intellectual milieu is one that crossed major events\nin French philosophy and, of course, in global history. His writings\nwould encounter the dominant Marxism of the French political and\nacademic milieu, while also, over a long career, he would debate with\nwriters in existential phenomenology, structuralism, and eventually\npost-structuralism, the latter being the moniker under which his works\nare commonly placed. Lyotard’s first book,\nPhenomenology (1954), demonstrated the import of that\nmovement on his early thought. Husserlian phenomenology, by way of\nJean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty\n(1908–1961), was dominant in the era’s existentialist\nmovements, and Lyotard’s work attempts to find a place for\nphenomenology in light of the Marxism dominant on the left, especially\nin the human sciences (e.g., sociology, history, and linguistics).\nLike Sartre, who attempted to wed his existentialist emphasis on the\nirreducibility of subjective experience and Marxian analyses, which\nled to his Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960), Lyotard\nwanted to understand if there was a way to take up the era’s\ndominant phenomenological bent in French philosophy in terms of the\nLeft’s adherence to Marxian analyses. Ultimately, he argues for\nphenomenology’s place to speak to experiences beyond what is\narticulable in language, while also following its founder, Edmund\nHusserl (1859–1938), in arguing that it could provide the\nsciences with their grounding in the essence of their areas of study:\nwhat is the meaning of history for the historical sciences? What is\nthe social for the sociologist? For Lyotard, these questions cannot be\nanswered from within these sciences themselves. \nUnlike Sartre, Lyotard does not seek a dialectical fusion of freedom,\nas found in existentialism, and necessity, as found in the objective\nlaws found in the various sciences. Rather he seeks a “third\nway” of thinking of history that shows how ultimately\nphenomenology cannot speak to the movements of history found in\nMarxism, but he also rejects any incipient structuralism of the period\nthat would denude the human of its place in history\n(Phenomenology, 131). For structuralism, as it would come to\ndefine itself over the next fifteen years in works by Lacan and Claude\nLevi-Strauss (1908–2009), among others, the human subject is\nlargely the effect of discursive grammars in which it is\nproduced. But most importantly for his later work, Lyotard argues that\nphenomenology offers a way not to think a single key to history, some\none meaning to which it must answer, but rather stipulates that\nhistory, for phenomenology, has “some meaning”\n(Phenomenology, 131, his emphasis). \nNevertheless, Lyotard judged phenomenology to be ultimately\nreactionary, unable to respond to the ways in which the economic\nrelations of production produce given conscious states, that is, how\nsubjectivity is founded in objectivity. In this way,\nLyotard’s work for the next decade would look to identify and\nillustrate these relations of production, especially in the Algerian\nsituation, but time and again he chafed against Marxism’s cookie\ncutter approach, which denied cultural differences as epiphenomenal to\nthe same economic forces it would find everywhere. The events of\nMay 1968—and the vibrant intellectual period of France during\nthe whole of the late 1960s—would have an indelible impact on\nLyotard’s work. Marxism failed, he believed, to account for the\nalliance of bourgeois students and workers together demanding\nliberation, while the French Communist Party’s siding with\nCharles de Gaulle’s government in helping bring the May 1968\nevents to an end scandalized many on the left. Marxism, Lyotard\nbelieved, failed to account for the desire that pushed those very\nstudents into the streets in the first place. Structuralism, for its\npart, Lyotard averred, was ultimately too intellectualist to account\nfor the sensuous and figural gestures that were very much a part of\nthe anarchical May 1968 events. As marchers argued against their\nstructuralist professors that structures don’t take to the\nstreets, Lyotard came to emphasize the figural and aesthetic\ndimensions of human existence—going against what he believed was\nstructuralism’s adherence to intellectual discourse over the\nlibidinal, extra-linguistic and sensuous experience. This would result\nin Discourse, Figure (1971). This put him at odds with the\ndominant structuralist and post-structuralist emphasis on language,\nand as the 1970s began and disappointment set in that May 1968 gave\nrise to little in terms of substantive change, Lyotard, like others,\nlooked to aesthetics and sensuous relations for their revolutionary\npotential. This led him to his strongest denunciation of Marxism yet\nin Libidinal Economy (1973). As the 1970s progressed and\nFrance moved from one technocratic government to the next, Lyotard\nbegan to elaborate a critique of technoscience and its reductionist\naccount of existence in terms that also reflected\npost-structuralism’s attunement to difference. Ultimately, as he\nargued in such works as The Postmodern Condition (1979),\nJust Gaming (1979), and The Differend (1983), the\ntask—in light of the loss of modernity’s metanarratives—was \nto account for the “differends” among different language\ngames, that is, irreducible ways in which peoples operating within\ndifferent milieu don’t have access to some all-encompassing\norder in which to have discussions over what is just, true, and so\nforth. This emphasis on language games, derived from Ludwig\nWittgenstein’s (1889–1951) later work, but also influenced\nby such figures as Saul Kripke (1940– ), brought him within the\nlinguistic turn that he had earlier found to be a linguistic idealism.\nLyotard’s writings, then, were always on the move and it would\nbe difficult to form a metanarrative or passkey that brings them all\nunder a common point of view or set of concerns. Nevertheless, while\nhe remained a man of his time—always responding and making\nadvances in the dominant schools of French thought through which he\nlived—his work continues to speak to those influenced by those\nfields, as well as new movements in Continental realisms, aesthetics,\nand posthumanism. \nLyotard’s writings of the early 1970s were, it’s fair to\nsay, far less influential at the time than, say, the writings of\nMichel Foucault (1926–1984) or Jacques Derrida\n(1930–2004). Yet, like Julia Kristeva (1941–), who\ndeveloped in well-known articles leading to The Revolution in\nPoetic Language (1974) the distinction between the semiotic (the\nlibidinal disruptiveness of bodily motility) and the symbolic (the\nstructured grammar whose extreme form is mathematics) that together\nmake language possible, Lyotard was interested in what escapes\ndiscourse but yet needs it to exist, just as there is no pure semiotic\nor symbolic language for Kristeva. In Discourse, Figure\n(1971), Lyotard differentiates discourse, that is, the written text\ninvestigated by semiotics and structuralism, and the figural, that is,\nthe visual, which he discusses through the phenomenology of\nMerleau-Ponty. Lyotard’s work was avowedly a shot across the bow\nat structuralism, whether found in Lacan’s reading of Sigmund\nFreud (1856–1939) or Louis Althusser’s (1918–1990)\nstructuralist Marxism. As he put it in a later interview, “I was\nagainst this way of thinking”, and for that reason the book was\n“ignored at the time because it was explicitly against\nstructuralism” (“Resisting a Discourse of Mastery”,\n191). For Lyotard, the emphasis on the written text in structuralism\ncontinues the Western tradition’s emphasis on the intellectual\nover the sensual. The figural is the disruptive force that is\nirreducible to any systemic or linguistic approach to language. For\nthis reason, Lyotard valorizes the eye and its modes of seeing\nfigures—shadings of meanings—that cannot be reduced to a\nsingle meaning or representation. The figural is what makes it\nimpossible to collapse language into pure signification, what Kristeva\nwould dub the symbolic, and this makes changes in language possible,\nas seen in poetry and literature. Discourse and figure, however, are\nnot opposed but are co-implicated: texts always contain figures\n(metaphors and the poetic in general) while visual milieu would be\nchaotic without being ordered or structured discursively such that one\ncan perceptually make one’s way about the world. In this way,\nwhat is libidinal and sensual is not, as Lacan argued, structured like\na language, and Lyotard’s writings testify to an attunement of\nfigural events that disrupt pre-given significations. \nLibidinal Economy, published three years later, is one he\nlater denounced, but remains an important examination of\ndesire’s place as the driver of the political while also\ncritiquing political and linguistic models of representation. The book\nis very much a reflection of its era: Deleuze and Felix\nGuattari’s (1930–1992) Anti-Oedipus had come out\nin 1972, arguing against Freudian accounts of repression while\noffering an immanentist ontology whereby all events had to be\naccounted for without reference to an outside or be confused with the\nrepresentations made of them. Lyotard follows Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844–1900) in arguing that there is no objective science or\nforms of knowledge that are not based in a desire or what Nietzsche\ncalled a will for power, a point that Lyotard will make by looking at\nthe desire or libido behind the so-called scientific works of the\nlater Marx. Libidinal Economy is not an easy read, not least\nsince it does not wish to set itself up as merely another\nphilosophical theory hiding its own desires, with a truth easily\nrepresentable to others (Libidinal, 244). While Freud largely\ndiscussed the libido at the individual level as a form of energy\ncirculating within the body and necessitating societal laws that led\nto the formation of an internal superego keeping these energies in\ncheck, Lyotard greatly extends the idea of the libido to think of\npolitical economy as really a libidinal economy. In sum, he looks to\nany stable formations within society as libidinal fields, whether we\nare discussing linguistics, economics, or architecture.  For\nLyotard, Freud’s notion of the pleasure principle (Eros)\nprovides for this stabilizing effect of the other side of our drives,\nnamely the death drive (Thanatos), which seeks out intensities,\nwhether high or low, that destabilize institutions. These\ntransformations occur through certain techniques\n(dispositifs, a term important in Foucault’s work of\nthe time) that guide these energies and which are themselves almost\nprecarious formations of energies themselves: the body, works of art,\nfinancial systems, texts, theoretical systems, and so forth. The\nmutations caused by the libidinal economy are events. The libido\nitself, its energetics, is never representable or containable within\nany given system; all desires are dissimulated in these institutions,\nand they are never presentable as they are in themselves. This is\nquite similar to what Deleuze and Guattari discuss in terms of\norganisms and and the body without organs in Anti-Oedipus two\nyears earlier, and both texts are often read as encouraging these\nflows of energy, that is, the creation of the highest intensities,\nover forms of organization that tamp down these events. For this\nreason, both books will be critiqued as being irresponsibly anarchist.\nFor Lyotard, structures and institutions tend to totalize and exploit\nintensities for their own good, and thus lay claim to all proper\ninterpretations of these intensities. But where Deleuze and Guattari\ndifferentiate fascistic and liberating forms of desire, Lyotard argues\nit is impossible to do so. Hence, for example, he will say that\ncapitalism is a liberating form of libidinal economy, since it\noverthrows all manner of institutions in the name of the accumulation\nof more and more money. Against Marx, he argues that our innate\ndesires are not alienated in capitalism, but rather that capitalism is\nanother means for the death drive to demolish those entities in its\nway, such as when capitalist expansion undoes traditional values and\nprevious forms of economics. And just as in capitalism, where it\nmatters not what goods are in circulation as long as there is an\naccumulation of capital, desires are neutral as to their locale.\nIndeed, later in interviews he will argue for at least passing through\ncapitalism for those facing economic hardship.\n“Capitalism”, he will say in 1995, “is the only\nsolution” for the unemployed and dispossessed, and there is\n“no competition” to capitalism for doing so\n(“Resisting a Discourse of Mastery”, 182). Only once one\nhas a job, food, and housing, he goes on, can “real resistance\nappear”. \nIn any event, as Lyotard puts it, there is “not good or bad\nintensities, then, but intensity or its decompression”\n(Libidinal, 42). But this leaves, then, open a question that\nhaunts other similar projects of the time: if each intensity is not to\nbe thought outside of itself in terms of some representation or\nmeasure, then what ethics is available when all intensities are only\nto be thought in terms of their inherent efficacy? From what place, then,\ncan one deem one set of intensities or libido economy\n“bad” over and against another? If all can and, it seems\nin Lyotard’s text, should come undone, then are we merely\npositing a nihilism? \nAs the 1970s progressed, Lyotard moved towards considerations of\njustice that could discern among different regimes of intensities,\nbut only once we acknowledge the changes in the era in which we live.\nThe Postmodern Condition begins by defining the postmodern as\n“incredulity towards metanarratives”, which is fitting\ngiven that it is a report on knowledge in the contemporary age.\nLyotard means that modernist considerations of education as slowly\ndeveloping and emancipating human beings in terms of a common project\nwhere all forms of knowledge ultimately cohere has fallen away and\nthat we are left merely with “little” or regional\nnarratives at odds with one another. He writes: \nI will use the term modern to designate any science that legitimates\nitself with reference to a metadiscourse … making an explicit\nappeal to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit, the\nhermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working\nsubject, or the creation of wealth … I define postmodern as\nincredulity toward metanarratives. (Postmodern Condition,\nxxiii–xxiv) \nThis is the overarching theme of the book, which also takes up the\ncrisis of legitimation in the sciences, which often must use\nextra-scientific narratives to attempt to place themselves above other\nkinds of narration (the arts, novels, philosophy, and so forth) as the\nfinal arbiter of truth, and hence is one of the last metanarratives of\nmodernity. The problem, Lyotard argues, is that the sciences face two\ncrises: one of representation, that is, that it cannot be held naively\nthat its models present to human subjects an accurate view of the\nobjective world, instead of paradigms in which only certain views of\nthe world fit and which, within a few years, can be completely\noverturned. Like any other particular kind of knowledge, e.g., a\nreligious or philosophical text, science is unable to move to\ntranscend its particular modes of discourse in order to claim anything\nbeyond its own sphere of competence and the rules by which its\nlanguage game is played. The second crisis is that science and other\nforms of knowledge are being put to the “technological” or\n“operativity” criterion (Postmodern Condition,\nxxv). In this way, the gaining of scientific knowledge is not an end\nin itself, in but is in service ultimately to economic motives that\nwill make certain processes more efficient and others redundant. \nThe narrative of The Postmodern Condition moves along two\ntemporal periods, one being modernity and its adherence to certain\nmetanarratives or means of organizing society’s chaotic mix of\ndifferent language games, the other being the computerization of\nknowledge that occurred from the 1950s forward. This would become what\nis now called the “information” or “knowledge”\neconomy, and Lyotard is one of those political thinkers who recognized a changeover\nfrom state-centered forms of liberalism to the neo-liberal,\nlaissez-faire deregulation of economies just before the Reagan and\nThatcher victories in the United States and United Kingdom. This\ncomputerization of knowledge has not just sped up how knowledge is\ntransferred, but what we think knowledge is, especially as the\nsciences are put almost wholly in service of supplying patents and\nknow-how for corporations. Lyotard avers that the old model of the\nlearning of knowledge as a means for making citizens and free agents\nof individuals is falling away as knowledge is exteriorized from any\nparticular individual knowers, and what is considered knowledge will\nonly be that which can be translated into computerizable language.\n“We can predict that anything in the constituted body of\nknowledge that is not translatable in this way will be\nabandoned”, he writes, “and that the direction of new\nresearch will be dictated by the possibility” (Postmodern\nCondition, 4). Where before nation-states scrambled in\ncompetition for resources, what is now at stake are\n“informational commodit[ies]”, small packets of\ninformation to be gained and traded under conditions where maximal\nefficiency is given absolute privilege (Postmodern Condition,\n5). Universities, then, will soon give up their roles in providing\ntraining (what the Germans call Bildung), instead preparing\ntheir students for becoming managers and creating these packets of\ninformation. No doubt, Lyotard was not the only one to see these\nchanges coming, but his prescience is notable nonetheless. At the same\ntime, since multinational corporations are best suited to commodify\ninformation at vast scales, the nation-state will lose its central\npolitical place and indeed purposely abdicate its role in managing\nnational economies. This reduction of knowledge to that which is\neasily translatable and understandable, of course, is what drives\nglobalization, and the leading economies, as Lyotard notes, will not\nbe those engaged in manufacturing traditional commodities but instead\nthose created and utilized through modern computing.  \nKnowledge in the form of an informational commodity indispensable to\nproductive power is already, and will continue to be, a\nmajor—perhaps the major—stake in the worldwide competition\nfor power. (Postmodern Condition, 5)  \nOne need only see the decimation of the U.S.’s rust belt\ncommunities and the outsized economic and political role of Silicon\nValley and the banking sectors in London and New York as proof of\nLyotard’s claims. But these changes have another effect as well:\nthese centers adjudicate what knowledge is, and one need only witness\noften fruitless attempts by humanities departments to prove themselves\nvaluable to employers in the digital economy as evidence of this. \nLyotard offers that the postmodern, as he sees it, ought to look for\nwhat is irreducible to commodification, that which is unpresentable\nwithin the “realism” of today (Postmodern\nCondition, 73–9). That which is taken to be real and most\nnatural is the formation of knowledge in terms understandable by\ncapitalist economics and its modes of efficiency. Lyotard, then,\nargues for forms of avant-gardism that seek what is unpresentable in\nthe present. Books by James Joyce (1882–1941), no doubt, can be treated like a commodity like any other, but\nopen up onto a plurality of meanings. One could read Joyce’s\nUlysses (1922) in the service of having dinner party patter,\nbut such postmodern works ultimately evade any simple meaning to pass\nalong in such idle chatter. Here is how Lyotard famously defines the\npostmodern more positively than being merely a disbelief in\nmetanarratives: \nThe postmodern would be that which, in the modern, puts forward the\nunpresentable in presentation itself; that which denies itself the\nsolace of good forms, the consensus of a taste which would make it\npossible to share collectively the nostalgia for the unattainable;\nthat which searches for new presentations, not in order to enjoy them\nbut in order to impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable. A\npostmodern artist or writer is in the position of a philosopher: the\ntext he writes, the work he produces are not in principle governed by\npre-established rules, and they cannot be judged according to a\ndetermining judgment, by applying familiar categories to the text.\n(Postmodern Condition, 81) \nIn sum, while there are a heterogeneity of language games through which\nwe pass, artists, writers, and philosophers make moves within those\nlanguage games—say those said to govern what a novel\nis—that disrupt and open those language games to what\n“will have been”, as he puts it. That is, they open up new\nways of thinking that are unpresentable in current language games.\n“Terror”, as he understands it, is “a fantasy to\nseize reality”, that is to colonize or totalize all other\nlanguage games and their future possibilities under the regime of one\nlanguage game (e.g., the technocratic language game of efficiency\n[Postmodern Condition, 67]). On this flip side of this terror\nare those that are “witnesses to the unpresentable”, who\nwish to “activate the difference” beyond and between the\nplurality of language games that make up postmodern societies\n(Postmodern Condition, 82). \nPublished the same year as The Postmodern Condition,\nLyotard’s Just Gaming (Au juste) is short, but\nnevertheless deserves its place among a canon of important\n20th-century texts on justice, along with his The Differend.\nAfter Libidinal Economy, through a series of shorter works,\nLyotard argued that we live again in pagan societies with many gods to\nbe worshipped. By this he means that we live among and through a\nvariety of language games (science, art, politics, and so on)\n(Just Gaming, 36). His main argument, though, is that\n“we judge without criteria” (Just Gaming, 14),\nthat is, there are no ontological or theoretical foundations for our\nethical and political claims for justice (Just Gaming, 44).\nIn this way, he radicalizes David Hume’s (1711–1776) claim\nthat one cannot derive an “ought” from an\n“is”. Just because there is a certain set of circumstances\nthat we can denotate does not prescribe for us what to do in light of\nthose conditions. Lyotard’s answers in this set of interviews to\nhis interlocutor, Jean-Loup Thébaud, the editor of the French\njournal L’esprit, attempt to thread a tricky political\nneedle: he recognizes that in postmodernity, there is no\nmetanarrative, no onto-theology, as Martin Heidegger (1889–1976)\nwould call it, that can ground prescriptive statements. Yet, leaving\nbehind any foundation for prescriptive statements does not leave us\nunable to speak to what is just and unjust. For Lyotard, following\nEmmanuel Levinas (1906–1995), we are nothing but the receivers\nof obligations. For Levinas, that meant that ethics was first\nphilosophy and we were always passive to the Other who came before us.\nBut Lyotard argues, though, that ethics cannot be first philosophy,\nbut is but one language game among others. And yet it is not\nnothing, since we are pulled into the pragmatics and practice\nof this particular language game that calls on us to make judgments.\nWhat is unjust, Lyotard avers, \noccur[s] if the pragmatics of obligation, that is, the possibility of\ncontinuing to play the game of the just, were excluded. That is what\nis unjust. Not the opposite of the just, but that which prohibits that\nthe question of the just and the unjust be, and remain, raised. Thus,\nobviously, all terror, annihilation, massacre, etc., or their threat,\nare, by definition, unjust. (Just Gaming, 66–7) \nIn this way, there can be prescriptives after the “death of\nGod”, as Nietzsche called it, and the era of paganism that arose\nin its place (Just Gaming, 36). What is unjust is the violent\nsilencing of those raising claims to justice and disallowing them from\nmaking prescriptive claims, such as those colonized and left unheard\nby hegemonic powers. \nFor Lyotard, there is “no knowledge in the matter of\nethics”, nor is there a theoretical truth to adhere to in\npolitics. Rather, politics is a matter of a diversity of opinions, as\nthe non-Platonic Greeks believed, and is about nothing but this\nplurality of opinions. The ability to judge is a “power to\ninvent criteria”, that is, create new rules not recognized by\nthe dominant modes of thinking politics. This claim brings\nLyotard’s thinking of the political close to Hannah\nArendt’s thinking of action and her notion of “thinking\nwithout banisters” after modernity’s loss of authority.\nPolitics, she believed, became ideological at best and totalitarian at\nworst if wedded to notions of truth, such as involved in the\nmetanarratives of Marxist economic theory and its inexorable laws of\nhistory, or the racist theories of Nazism. The task, for Lyotard, is\nto see that questions of justice and prescriptive language games are\nnot simply about obeying laws. Rather, the task is to develop an\nattunement to the plurality of opinions and language games. “We\nhave to judge case by case”, he avers, pointing to Aristotelian\nphronēsis or practical wisdom as a model, but without an\noverarching community telos as in Aristotle’s (384–422\nBCE) Nichomachean Ethics (Just Gaming, 47). Even\nsuch seemingly universal prescriptions, such as “thou shall not\nkill”, are anything but, since exceptions are invariably made\nconcerning those lives that are to be taken in terms of the death\npenalty or in war. The point, then, is not that Lyotard’s\n“pagan” ethics and politics leads to irresponsibility, but\nthe opposite. If it were just a matter of having a sure knowledge or\nabsolute set of laws to follow, then politics would be pre-programmed\nand there would be no judgment worthy of the name. \nShortly after completing Libidinal Economy, Lyotard began\nnine years of efforts crafting his masterwork, The Differend\n(1983). The book begins with a “Reading Dossier” that sets\nout clearly the question, theses, context, addressee, and so forth of\nthe work in separate paragraphs. The context, he argues, is the\nlinguistic turn in philosophy, and his avowed method is to engage\npolitical disputes on the model of linguistic affairs\n(Differend, xiii). The book itself contains 264 numbered\nparagraphs, building on arguments he had been making in the years\nleading up to the work. The major change is that Lyotard no longer\nuses the term “language games”, which led some readers to\nthink that subjects could be outside these games as players. Lyotard\nis clear that subjects are only such in the way that they move and are\nproduced by moves within different language games. The\n“object”, of The Differend will be\n“phrases”, which are indubitable since “to doubt\nthat one phrases is still to phrase”, he argues, since even\n“one’s silence makes a phrase” (Differend,\n11). \nDespite this linguistic model, phrases may be extralinguistic,\nincluding the very gestures, shadings, and libidinal energetics he had\ndiscussed in his earlier writings. Anything, then, can be a phrase in\nLyotard’s understanding. For every phrase, there is a regimen\nwithin which it exists, the possible significations of that phrase,\nthe referent of the phrase, the one from whom the phrase arrives, and\nthe addressee, the one to whom the phrase is addressed. Within each\nphrase regimen, there is a certain play, since there may be\nambiguities along each aspect above. Any reader of Twitter knows the\nproblem: is this meant as irony? In the form of a question? Who is\nbeing addressed and why? Only with continual phrases, linked to the\ninitial phrase, does the initial ambiguity become clearer, but of\ncourse, with these newer phrases, further ambiguities may take place,\nsince they face the same problems as the initial phrase. Nevertheless\nthere are rules followed within phrase regimens such that certain\nphrases are allowable while others are not. Lyotard writes: \nThere are a number of phrase regimens: knowing, describing,\nrecounting, questioning, showing, ordering. etc. Phrases from\nheterogeneous regimens cannot be translated from one into the other.\nThey can be linked one onto the other in accordance with an end fixed\nby the a genre of discourse …Genres of discourse supply rules\nfor linking together heterogeneous phrases, rules that are proper for\nattaining certain goals: to know, to teach, to be just, to seduce, to\njustify, to evaluate, to rouse emotion, to oversee.\n(Differend, xii). \nThis notion of linkages is important. Links follow the rules of the\nparticular regimen or genre, while linking different phrases together\nis “the problem of politics” (Differend, xiii).\nLinking phrases, he says, is necessary but contingent in how it is\ndone (Differend, 29). Linkages among phrases occur within\ngenres, and these links are successful when the goals of the discourse\nare met: one seduces another, a question is met with an answer, or an\neconomic exchange is performed. Yet these rules only apply within\nspecific genres and there are no rules for how to make links between\nthe different genres themselves. Lyotard argues that within genres, we\ncannot help but make linkages, and the hope is to escape the problem\nof what Lyotard calls a differend, where one move makes a link from\nwithin one discourse in other to colonize, that is, silence, another.\nThus, though we cannot do anything other than make linkages among\nphrases and create new events, hegemonic discourses or grand\nnarratives often want to pre-program how those links are to be made\nand thus control all future phrases or events (Differend,\n80). \nThis is not to say that links within regimens are not without\nconflict: within the regimen of parliamentary democracy, within courts\nof law, within art criticism, there are always forms of\n“litigation” where one takes the rules within that genre\nand apply them to a particular case and arguments ensue. For example,\nto use the court example from which Lyotard borrows his term, in court\none may use rules of evidence, case law, and so forth both in\ndefending and prosecuting a certain defendant, all of which remains\nwithin the regimen of criminal law, and even if there are\n“damages”—one loses—one has at least been\ngiven one’s “rights” within that phrase regimen.\nThis is not the case where there is a differend\n(différend): \nAs distinguished from a litigation, a differend would be a case of\nconflict, between (at least) two parties, that cannot be resolved for\nlack of a rule of judgement applicable to both of the arguments. One\nside’s legitimacy does not imply the other’s lack of legitimacy.\nHowever, applying a single rule of judgement to both in order to\nsettle their differend as though it were merely a litigation would\nwrong (at least) one of them (and both of them if neither side admits\nthis rule). (Differend, xi) \nLyotard offers a number of examples of differends: the relation of\ncolonizer and the colonized or between the bourgeoisie and the\nproletariat, but he opens The Differend with the case of the\nFrench Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson, who claimed that the only\ntestimony that he would accept would be that of someone who had\nactually been through the gas chambers. This, of course, sets off a\ndifferend since to have seen the gas chambers in operation would be to\nhave been its victim, and thus silences all other genres, the various\nlinkages of communication within the genre of history, for example,\nthat would testify to the Shoah. One set of phrases is absolutely\nincommunicable with the other. But this does not mean that there is an\n“equivalence” between the discourse of the denier and the\ndiscourses of historians and survivors alike. Lyotard’s response\nto this problem is complicated. He argues, not always persuasively,\nthat the Nazis were in many ways successful in destroying the means by\nwhich historians adduce historical events: they not only killed their\nvictims and destroyed their bodies, but also the paperwork and\nbuildings that would be evidence of their crimes. “The\nresult”, he writes, “is that one cannot adduce numerical\nproof of the massacre and that a historian pleading for the trial’s\nrevision will be able to object at great length that the crime has not\nbeen established in its quantity” (Differend, 56). But\nthe task of justice, he claims, is not to let the Nazis or their\nmodern apologists claim a relativism of different discourses. Lyotard\nargues that Auschwitz offers something that is unpresentable in the\npresentation of history itself: an inverted sublime, a horror so\ninfinite that a “silence” is “imposed on\nknowledge”, though it does “not impose the silence of\nforgetting” (Differend, 56). Indeed, he says, it\nimposes a sentiment, if not an obligation:  \nThe silence that surrounds the phrase, Auschwitz was the extermination\ncamp is not a state of mind, is the sign that something remains to be\nphrased which is not. (Differend, 57)  \nIn other words, the Shoah leaves us silent before its void, since it\ndoes not belong to any previous political phrase regimen or means for\nrepresenting it. To represent it is to misrepresent it, and hence any\nregime is going to leave this powerful silence always on the edge of\nany discourse about it. From his early work on phenomenology through\nDiscourse, Figure, Libidinal Economy, and The\nPostmodern Condition, Lyotard argued that events occur always in\nthe face of what is not presentable to a phenomenology, discourse,\nlanguage game, or phrase regimen. An event, if it occurs, is not\nsimply unforseeable within any of these, but in fact explodes our\nability to represent them within any language game or phrase regimen.\nThe Shoah is one such event. \nThe political import of differends is easy to see: Israelis and\nPalestinians are not “litigating” a\n“political” impasse, but have completely different phrase\nregimens within which situations are interpreted and understood, and\nthey are completely irreconcilable. There is no link to be found\nbetween the genre of discourse of the Apartheid South Africa and those\nwho were silenced and violently suffered under white hegemony. There\nis, in these cases, no possibility for litigation, since one side has\nno right to claim justice within the dominant language of the\npolitical regime. This is what Lyotard had in earlier works called\n“terror” and in The Differend calls a wrong: \nThis is what a wrong would be: a damage accompanied by the lose of the\nmeans to prove the damage. This is the case if the victim is deprived\nof life, or all of his or her liberties, or of the freedom to make his\nor her ideas or opinions public, or simply the right to testify to the\ndamage… In all of these cases, to the privation constituted by\nthe damage there is added the impossibility of bringing it to the\nknowledge of others. (Differend, 5) \nThis should not be taken to mean that linkages cannot eventually be\nmade, that justice cannot be done in spite of a differend. But new\nphrases regimens will need to be invented, new gestures or ways of\nexisting together will have to be found, to get around this\nincommensurability. In fact, the cause of justice means that one\nphrase regimen (e.g., that of the Apartheid government) will need to\nbe rooted out in order for its hegemony to end. For Lyotard, then, the\npolitics of the differend does not call for valuing different\ndiscourses equally or one recognizing another, since, of course,\nconflict occurs precisely where neither side finds meaning in the\nphrase regimen of the other. Lyotard thus does not model the different\nphrase regimens as a marketplace of ideas, since the existence of one\nphrase regimen may mean the violent silencing of another. \nThis is what gives us the ability to name the unjust. The plurality of\nphrase regimens is a fact, and what is unjust or wrong would be\nprecisely using one phrase regimen to silence that of others, to\nintroduce a localized narrative as a metanarrative that would put all\nothers in their place and render them mute and unseen. The postmodern\nobligation, then, as we saw at the end of The Postmodern\nCondition, is, yes, to deny “reality”, but only as\nthat reality tends to be defined by hegemonic discourses, not the\nplenitude of plural ways of being in the world. \nReturning to themes in The Postmodern Condition, 1988’s\nThe Inhuman returns to the problems of consumer capitalism.\nThis set of essays, most first given as lectures, are remarkable in\ntheir literary and philosophical quality, with each indirectly, as the\nsubtitle suggests, taking up the problem of temporality, that is, our\nopenness to the unphraseable events given in a future worthy of the\nname. Like other French thinkers of his day, Lyotard was a\nthoroughgoing critic of humanism and its pretension to define and thus\nlimit what the human was to be. The Inhuman begins by\ndissociating two forms that the “inhuman” has taken in\npostmodernity: on the one hand, there is the dehumanizing inhumanism\nof contemporary capitalism and its reduction of the human to modes of\nefficiency and the needs of the technocratic order, specifically\nthrough the ideology of “development”. Under this rubric,\nwhat is dubbed the human is constrained to become more like machines\nin their functioning, or indeed that the machines we have built will\nreplace us in terms of the thinking we thought integral to the human\nbeing. The opening essay, “Can Thought Go on without a\nBody?” takes this up as the ultimate dream of technoscience,\narguing, in a dialogue between a “he” and a\n“she”, that “the sole serious question to face\nhumanity today” is the fact that in 4.5 billion years, the sun\nwill burn out and take all of human thought, including the entire\narchive that human beings ever existed, with it (Inhuman, 9).\nTechno-science, the “he” claims, has its telos in escaping\nthis fate, which “he” calls a “pure event”,\none that, in the terms of The Differend, could never be put\ninto a phrase since no one would be there to think it. “All the\nevents and disasters we’re familiar with and try to think\nof”, “he” writes, “will end up as no more than\npale simulacra” (Inhuman, 11). While hyperbolic,\nLyotard’s surmise is that technoscience is driven by a need to\nconquer our being-towards-death and indeed, the possibility of the\nultimate finitude of any living-on of any memory or history of\nhumanity marked by the coming solar catastrophe. Digital technologies\noffer the hope of a becoming-inhuman of thought, of thought going on\nwithout a body, one that “she” offers would have to\ntranscend “the differend of gender” and corporeal\nexistence (Inhuman, 22–3). “She” argues\nthat suffering and pain can only exist within a body, and thus any\nimpetus to resistance to the literal programming of phrase regimens\n(computer programming being the most purified form of what Lyotard had\ncalled discourse in Discourse, Figure) would disappear. This\nsurmise is no longer hyperbolic: there are myriad research programs in\nSilicon Valley and elsewhere for performing precisely what Lyotard\nsuggests, namely making thought go on without a body, though whether\none could call this thought in the full sense is precisely why Lyotard\ncalls this the “sole question” facing humanity, given that\nit goes to what we mean by the word human. \nAgainst this notion of the inhuman, akin to what Lyotard years earlier\nhad called the figural, is the inventiveness of another form of the\ninhuman, what would get us beyond the human of humanism and its grand\nnarratives. This event is one that Lyotard links to the youth of the\nchild, since it has ever present possibilities that are nevertheless\nnot presentable or speakable within the phrase regimens of the\npresent, and thus provides a site of resistance to the dominant modes\nof “reality”. “Being prepared to receive what\nthought is not prepared to think”, he writes, “is what\ndeserves the name of thinking” (Inhuman, 73). This form\nof the inhuman, against those who would think of Lyotard as a\ncelebrant of the 1960s death of man and the end of humanism, stands as\na testament to the inventiveness of the human and its irreducibility\nto the machinic—to the point where it can transcend what we\nthought the human was to be. As in Discourse, Figure, it is\nnot that one form of the inhuman exists without the other: the\ntechnical and the artistic are not easily separable, and the arts\nsurvive using techniques and known grammars in order to coming into\nbeing. This is why Lyotard argues that the postmodern, despite\nsuggestions otherwise in The Postmodern Condition, is not a\n“period” that comes after the modern. On his view, the\npostmodern is that which exists within the modern itself. \nIn any case, computerization seeks the repetition of what exists now\nin modes of efficiency, while the child in the human is open to\npossibilities of the future, the events to come that cannot be\nprogrammed or pre-figured. To attempt the latter, Lyotard claims\nthroughout his later works, is an attempt to control and therefore\nescape time: \n[I]t must never be forgotten that if thinking indeed consists in\nreceiving the event, it follows that no-one can claim to think without\nbeing ipso facto in a position of resistance to the\nprocedures for controlling time. To think is to question everything,\nincluding thought, and question, and the process. To question requires\nthat something happen that reason has not yet known. In thinking, one\naccepts the occurrence for what it is: “not yet”\ndetermined. (Inhuman, 74) \nIn the Inhuman, Lyotard thinks the event not through the\nphrase “What is happening”, which presumes that all one\nhas to do is await a form of information, as one does when watching\ntelevision news. Rather the event arrives, as suggested above, through\na questioning, specifically the question “is it happening”\n(“arrive-t-il?”), which opens up the possibility\nthat “nothing might happen” (Inhuman, 92). This\nis the terror and pleasure found in Immanuel Kant’s\n(1724–1804) account of the sublime in The Critique of\nJudgment (1790), wherein one experiences a feeling that explodes\none’s capacities for imagination and causes both pleasure and\ndispleasure at once (Inhuman, 85). This, for Lyotard, is at\nthe heart of all creation, which comes with the  \nmisery that the painter faces with a plastic surface, of the musician\nwith the acoustic surface, the misery the thinker faces with a desert\nof thought, and so on. (Inhuman, 91) \nBarnett Newman’s (1905–1970) paintings, which often are\nmerely monochromatic with single, straight “zips” or lines\ntraversing them, is a paradigm of this. Newman’s paintings offer\nthe “postmodern sublime”, for Lyotard. Everything in\nNewman’s paintings arrives in an instant, yet what arrives is\nwhat Lyotard calls the postmodern: the unpresentable in presentation\nitself. The paintings have no allusions, no modernist story to them.\nTo their surfaces one can only ask “is it happening?” Any\nanswer to the question fails since it would be attempting to represent\nwhat is not offered in the painting itself. In this way, the\npostmodern artist is modernist in the sense of seeking out what is\nnew, not according to pre-established phrase regimens, but by\nexploring means for finding what cannot be articulated within\nany phrase regimens. Lyotard’s essays on Newman have\nhad an indelible impact on aesthetics and understanding what has been\nunderway in so-called postmodern art. When spectators complain that\npostmodern artists do not present anything to be understood or that\ntheir works withstand interpretation, Lyotard’s claim is that\nthis is precisely the point: to stand against being recuperated within\ndominant modes of thinking. This is the ultimate argument that art is\nfor art’s sake. Art need not provide a political message,\nrepresent reality properly, or morally guide us. Rather postmodern art\nwould be that taking place of a self-enclosed event that withstands\ninterpretation and is irreducible, as art, to any use value. \nLyotard’s writings have been seen as paradigmatic of the\nexcesses of “high theory” in the 1970s and 1980s. His\naccount of language games and refusal to allow any to have a grip on\nreality is supposed by his critics to have helped usher in a\n“post-fact” world. Yet Lyotard’s claims, as he well\nknew, were not far from the anti-realisms of those in Anglo-American\nphilosophy influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein, such as Michael Dummett\n(1925–2011), who at the time Lyotard was writing argued that\nclaims to reality were merely moves within a given conceptual scheme\nand there was no test external to these schemes for corresponding that\nscheme to an external reality. Though this led Dummett to an\nanti-realist position on time, following J. M. E. McTaggart\n(1866–1925), Lyotard’s thinking of phrase regimens and\ntheir limits were meant to testify, as The Inhuman makes\nclear, to human finitude and the unassailable coming of the future and\nthe simplicity of events. The future, as such, is not something that\ncan be predicted from the present, since this would only be a present\nimagined into the future. Lyotard, especially in The Postmodern\nCondition, assailed realisms, but always from the point of view\nthat these “realisms” want to pre-program and thus\ndisallow the coming of events. In this way, from the beginning of his\ncareer to its end, Lyotard never argued that all was socially\nconstructed, that all language games had equal validity, or that we\nare locked within the prison house of language. Rather, all of his\nworks attempt to testify to that which escapes language, though we\nnever stop attempting to articulate this excess. This leads to a\ndizzying array of differences among and between phrase regimens, and\nLyotard’s work was to testify to the fact of these differences\nand the injustices of differends where these differences are silenced.\nThe postmodern, then, bears witness not to the fact that there are no\nfacts, but rather that those claiming a passkey to reality merely want\nto make a claim for the hegemony of one phrase regimen (e.g., the\nsciences or techno-capitalism) over all others.","contact.mail":"pmgratton@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
