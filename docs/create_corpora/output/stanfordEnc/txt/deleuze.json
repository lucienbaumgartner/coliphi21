Deleuze conceived of philosophy as the\nproduction of concepts, and he characterized himself as a “pure\nmetaphysician.” In his magnum opus Difference and\nRepetition, he tries to develop a metaphysics adequate to\ncontemporary mathematics and science—a metaphysics in which the\nconcept of multiplicity replaces that of substance, event replaces\nessence and virtuality replaces possibility. Deleuze also produced\nstudies in the history of philosophy (on Hume, Nietzsche, Kant,\nBergson, Spinoza, Foucault, and Leibniz), and on the arts (a two-\nvolume study of the cinema, books on Proust and Sacher-Masoch, a work\non the painter Francis Bacon, and a collection of essays on\nliterature.) Deleuze considered these latter works as pure philosophy,\nand not criticism, since he sought to create the concepts that\ncorrespond to the artistic practices of painters, filmmakers, and\nwriters. In 1968, he met Félix Guattari, a political activist\nand radical psychoanalyst, with whom he wrote several works, among\nthem the two-volume Capitalism and Schizophrenia, comprised\nof Anti-Oedipus (1972) and\nA Thousand Plateaus (1980).  Their final collaboration was\nWhat is Philosophy? (1991).\n\n\n\nDeleuze is noteworthy for his rejection of the Heideggerian notion of\nthe “end of metaphysics.” In an interview, he once offered\nthis self-assessment: “I feel myself to be a pure\nmetaphysician.... Bergson says that modern science hasn’t found its\nmetaphysics, the metaphysics it would need. It is this metaphysics\nthat interests me.” [Villani 1999: 130.]) We should also point\nto the extent of his non-philosophical references (inter\nalia, differential calculus, thermodynamics, geology, molecular\nbiology, population genetics, ethology, embryology, anthropology,\npsychoanalysis, economics, linguistics, and even esoteric thought);\nhis colleague Jean-François Lyotard spoke of him as a\n“library of Babel.” Although it remains to be seen whether\nthe 20th century will be “Deleuzean,” as his friend Michel\nFoucault once quipped, Deleuze’s influence reaches beyond philosophy;\nhis work is approvingly cited by, and his concepts put to use by,\nresearchers in architecture, urban studies, geography, film studies,\nmusicology, anthropology, gender studies, literary studies and other\nfields.\n\n\n\nOne of the barriers to Deleuze’s being better read among mainstream\nphilosophers is the difficulty of his writing style in his original\nworks (as opposed to his historical works, which are often models of\nclarity and concision). Deleuze’s prose can be highly allusive, as\nwell as peppered with neologisms; to make matters even more complex,\nthese terminological innovations shift from one work to the\nother. While claims of intentional obscurantism are not warranted,\nDeleuze did mean for his style to keep readers on their toes, or even\nto “force” them to rethink their philosophical\nassumptions. (We will discuss this notion of being\n“forced” to think below in 3.1.) As befits an encyclopedia\nentry, we will concentrate on the conceptual architecture of his\nthought, though readers should be aware that, perhaps more than with\nmost philosophers, such a treatment of Deleuze’s work removes much of\nthe performative effect of reading the original.\n\n\n\nDeleuze was born in Paris to conservative, middle-class parents, who\nsent him to public schools for his elementary education; except for\none year of school in Normandy during the Occupation, he lived in the\nsame section of Paris his entire life. His personal life was\nunremarkable; he remained married to the same woman he wed at age 31,\nFanny (Denise Paul) Grandjouan, a French translator of D. H. Lawrence,\nand raised two children with her. He rarely traveled abroad, although\nhe did take a trip to the United States in 1975; for the most part he\nminimized his attendance at academic conferences and colloquia,\ninsisting that the activity of thought took place primarily in\nwriting, and not in dialogue and discussion. The most dramatic event\nin his life occurred early, when, during the Occupation, Deleuze’s\nolder brother was arrested by the Nazis for resistance activities and\ndeported; he died on the train to Auschwitz. \n\nWhen the Germans began their occupation of France in June 1940,\nDeleuze’s family was on vacation in Normandy, and he spent a year\nbeing schooled there. Deleuze traced his initiation into literature\nand philosophy to his encounter with a teacher at Deauville named\nPierre Halbwachs (son of the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs), who\nintroduced him to writers such as Gide and Baudelaire. Early on, he\nrecalled, philosophical concepts struck him with the same force as\nliterary characters, having their own autonomy and style. After the\nLiberation, Deleuze returned to Paris and undertook his\nkhâgne (an intensive year of preparatory studies) at\nthe well-known Lycée Henri IV, and then studied the history of\nphilosophy at the Sorbonne.  He was taught by Jean Hippolyte and\nFerdinand Alquié, whom he “loved and admired\nenormously,” as well as by Georges Canguilheim and Maurice de\nGandillac. Like many of his peers he was as influenced by the writings\nof Jean-Paul Sartre as he was by the work of his academic mentors. \n\nDeleuze’s historically oriented study at the Sorbonne led him to\ndevote his first book, Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953), to\nHume. In an era in which peers like Foucault and Derrida, students at\nthe Ecole Normale Supérieure, concentrated on “the three\n‘H’s” (Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger), Deleuze’s\ndecision to write on empiricism and Hume was already a provocation,\nearly evidence of the heterodox tendencies of his thought. From 1953\nto 1962—which he later referred to as “a hole in my\nlife”—Deleuze published little, moving among various\nteaching positions in Paris and the provinces. It was also during this\ntime that he contracted the recurring respiratory ailment that would\nplague him for the rest of his life. In 1962, Nietzsche and\nPhilosophywas published to considerable acclaim, cementing\nDeleuze’s reputation in academic circles. He followed this\ninitial success with Kant’s Critical Philosophy (1963);\nProust and Signs (1964); and Bergsonism (1966). In\n1968 he published Difference and Repetition as his primary\nthesis for the doctorat d’Etat, with Spinoza and\nthe Problem of Expression as the secondary thesis. The next year,\n1969, proved to be an important one for Deleuze. First, he found a\npermanent teaching position in Paris, at the experimental campus of\nthe University of Paris VIII in Vincennes (which later moved to its\ncurrent location in St. Denis); he gave weekly seminars at this\ninstitution until his retirement in 1987. Second, he published another\nmajor text in his own name, Logic of Sense. But most\nimportantly, it was then that he met Félix Guattari, a radical\npsychoanalyst and political militant, with whom he began a long\ncollaboration. Their first joint volume, Anti-Oedipus (1972),\nwas a best seller in France, a veritable succès de\nscandale, and thrust Deleuze into the limelight as a public\nintellectual. They followed this with Kafka: Toward a Minor\nLiterature (1975), and then a book which, at least in the eyes of\nsome, rivals Difference and Repetition for the title of\nDeleuze’s masterwork, A Thousand Plateaus (1980). \n\nThe 1980s were a decade of independent works for Deleuze: Francis\nBacon: Logic of Sensation (1981); Cinema I: The\nMovement-Image (1983); Cinema II: The Time-Image (1985);\nFoucault (1986); and The Fold: Leibniz and the\nBaroque (1988). He then resumed his collaboration with Guattari\nfor their final joint work, What is Philosophy? (1991). His\nfinal years were spent in very ill health, although he did manage to\npublish a remarkable short essay, “Immanence: A Life” in\n1995, before taking his own life on November 4, 1995. \n\nBefore he ever wrote “in his own name” in Difference\nand Repetition and Logic of Sense, Deleuze wrote a\nseries of works on figures in the history of philosophy (Hume,\nBergson, Nietzsche, Kant, and Spinoza). In writing these works,\nDeleuze sought to unearth the presuppositions he absorbed in his\neducation; chief among them, he felt, was a deep-seated privilege of\nidentity over difference. Deleuze thus set about trying to accelerate\nhowever he could a departure from Hegel, whom he saw as emblematic of\nthat privilege. Deleuze attacks Hegel and others in what we can\ncall—though Deleuze did not—the “identitarian”\ntradition first of all by means of a radicalized reading of Kant,\nwhose genius, as Deleuze explains in Kant’s Critical\nPhilosophy (1963), was to have conceived of a purely\nimmanent critique of reason—a critique that did not\nseek “errors” of reason produced by external causes, but\nrather “illusions” that arise from within reason itself by\nthe illegitimate (transcendent) uses of the syntheses of\nconsciousness. Deleuze characterized his own work as a philosophy of\nimmanence, arguing that Kant himself had failed to realize fully the\nambitions of his critique, for at least two reasons: first, the\nfailure to pursue a fully immanent critique, and second, the failure\nto propose a genetic account of real experience, resting content with\nthe account of the conditions of possible experience. \n\nFirst, Kant made the field of consciousness immanent to a\ntranscendental subject, thereby reintroducing an element of identity\nthat is transcendent (that is, external) to the field itself, and\nreserving all power of synthesis (that is, identity-formation) in the\nfield to the activity of the always already unified and transcendent\nsubject. (Deleuze was influenced in this regard by his reading of\nSartre’s 1937 essay “The Transcendence of the Ego.”)\nAlready in his Hume book, Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953),\nDeleuze had pointed to an empiricist reversal of Kant. Where Kant’s\nquestion had been “How can the given be given to a\nsubject?” Hume’s question had been “How is the subject\n(human nature) constituted within the given?” In his mature\nwork, Deleuze argues for an “impersonal and\npre-individual” transcendental field in which the subject as\nidentity pole which produces empirical identities by active synthesis\nis itself the result or product of differential passive\nsyntheses (for instance, in what Deleuze calls the syntheses of\nhabit, we find bodily, desiring, and unconscious\n“contractions” which unify a series of experiences,\nextracting that which it to be retained in the habit and allowing the\nrest to be “forgotten”). The passive syntheses responsible\nfor subject formation must be qualified as “differential,”\nfor three reasons. Each passive synthesis is serial, never singular\n(there is never one synthesis by itself, but always a series of\n“contractions,” that is to say, experience is ongoing and\nso our habits require constant “updating”); each series is\nrelated to other series in the same body (at the most basic level, for\ninstance, the series of taste contractions is related to those of\nsmell, sight, touch, hearing and proprioception); and each body is\nrelated to other bodies, which are themselves similarly differential\n(the series of syntheses of bodies can resonate or clash). Together\nthe passive syntheses at all these levels form a differential field\nwithin which subject formation takes place as an integration or\nresolution of that field; in other words, subjects are roughly\nspeaking the patterns of these multiple and serial syntheses which\nfold in on themselves producing a site of self-awareness. Of course,\nDeleuze never simply proclaims this as a bald thesis, but develops a\ngenetic account of subjectivity in many of his books. Taking all this\ninto account, Deleuze summarized his differential, immanent and\ngenetic position by the at first glance odd phrase of\n“transcendental empiricism.” This is cashed out in terms\nof two characteristics: (1) the abstract (e.g., “subject,”\n“object,” “State,” the “whole,”\nand so on) does not explain, but must itself be explained; and (2) the\naim of philosophy is not to rediscover the eternal or the universal,\nbut to find the singular conditions under which something new is\nproduced. In other words—and this is a pragmatic perspective\nfrom which Deleuze never deviated—philosophy aims not at stating\nthe conditions of knowledge qua representation, but at finding and\nfostering the conditions of creative production. \n\nDeleuze’s second criticism of Kant claims that he had simply presumed\nthe existence of knowledge and morality as “facts” and\nthen sought their conditions of possibility in the transcendental. But\nalready in 1789, Salomon Maimon, whose early critiques of Kant helped\ngenerate the post-Kantian tradition, had argued that Kant’s critical\nproject required a method of genesis—and not merely a method of\nconditioning—that would account for the production of knowledge,\nmorality, and indeed reason itself. In other words, Maimon called for\na genetic method that would be able to reach the conditions of real\nand not merely possible experience. Maimon found a solution to this\nproblem in a principle of difference: whereas identity is the\ncondition of possibility of thought in general, it is difference that\nconstitutes the genetic and productive principle of real\nthought. These two Maimonian exigencies—the search for the\ngenetic conditions of real experience and the positing of a\nprinciple of difference—appear in almost every one of\nDeleuze’s early monographs. Nietzsche and Philosophy (1962),\nfor instance, suggests that Nietzsche completed and inverted\nKantianism by bringing critique to bear, not simply on false claims to\nknowledge or morality, but on true knowledge and true morality, and\nindeed on truth itself: “genealogy” constituted\nNietzsche’s genetic method, and the will-to-power was his principle of\ndifference. Deleuze’s anti-Hegelianism is shown in his focus on the\nproductivity of the non-dialectical (“affirmative”)\ndifferential forces termed by Nietzsche “noble.” These\nforces affirm themselves, and thereby differentiate themselves first,\nand only secondarily consider that from which they have differentiated\nthemselves. \n\nIn Bergsonism (1966), Deleuze develops the ideas of\nvirtuality and multiplicity that will serve as the backbone of his\nlater work. From Maimon’s reading of Kant, we know that Deleuze needs\nto substitute the notion of the condition of the genesis of the real\nfor the notion of conditions of possibility of representational\nknowledge. The positive name for that genetic condition is the\nvirtual, which Deleuze adopts from the following Bergsonian\nargument. The notion of the possible, Bergson holds in Creative\nEvolution, is derived from a false problem that confuses the\n“more” with the “less” and ignores differences\nin kind; there is not less but more in the idea of the possible than\nin the real, just as there is more in the idea of nonbeing than in\nthat of being, or more in the idea of disorder than in that of\norder. When we think of the possible as somehow\n“pre-existing” the real, we think of the real, then we add\nto it the negation of its existence, and then we project the\n“image” of the possible into the past. We then reverse the\nprocedure and think of the real as something more than possible, that\nis, as the possible with existence added to it. We then say that the\npossible has been “realized” in the real. By contrast,\nDeleuze will reject the notion of the possible in favor of that of the\nvirtual. Rather than awaiting realization, the virtual is fully real;\nwhat happens in genesis is that the virtual is actualized. \n\nThe fundamental characteristic of the virtual, that which means it\nmust be actualized rather than realized, is its differential makeup.\nDeleuze always held the critical axiom that the ground cannot resemble\nthat which it grounds; he constantly critiques the\n“tracing” operation by which identities in real experience\nare said to be conditioned by identities in the transcendental. For\ninstance, Deleuze criticizes Kant for copying the transcendental field\nin the image of the empirical field. That is, empirical experience is\npersonal, identitarian and centripetal; there is a central focus, the\nsubject, in which all our experiences are tagged as belonging to\nus. Kant says this empirical identity is only possible if we can posit\nthe Transcendental Unity of Apperception, that is, the possibility of\nadding “I think” to all our judgments. Instead of this\nsmuggled-in or “traced” identity, Deleuze will want to\nhave the transcendental field be differential. Deleuze still wants to\nwork back from experience, but since the condition cannot resemble the\nconditioned, and since the empirical is personal and individuated, the\ntranscendental must be impersonal and pre-individual. The virtual is\nthe condition for real experience, but it has no identity; identities\nof the subject and the object are products of processes that resolve,\nintegrate, or actualize (the three terms are synonymous for Deleuze) a\ndifferential field. The Deleuzean virtual is thus not the condition of\npossibility of any rational experience, but the condition of genesis\nof real experience. \n\nAs we have seen, the virtual, as genetic ground of the actual, cannot\nresemble that which it grounds; thus, if we are confronted with actual\nidentities in experience, then the virtual ground of those identities\nmust be purely differential. Deleuze adopts “multiplicity”\nfrom Bergson as the name for such a purely differential field. In this\nusage, Deleuze later clarifies, “multiplicity” designates\nthe multiple as a substantive, rather than as a predicate. The\nmultiple as predicate generates a set of philosophical problems under\nthe rubric of “the one and the many” (a thing is one or\nmultiple, one and multiple, and so on). With multiplicity, or the\nmultiple as substantive, the question of the relation between the\npredicates one/multiple is replaced by the question of distinguishing\ntypes of multiplicities (as with Bergson’s distinction of qualitative\nand quantitative multiplicities in Time and Free Will). A\ntypological difference between substantive multiplicities, in short,\nis substituted for the dialectical opposition of the one and the\nmultiple. \n\nIn sum, then, against the “major” post-Kantian tradition\nof Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, Deleuze in effect posited his own\n“minor” post-Kantian trio of Maimon, Nietzsche, and\nBergson. To these he added a trio of pre-Kantians, Spinoza, Leibniz\nand Hume, but read through a post-Kantian lens. We have already\ntouched on Deleuze’s reading of Hume. Let us now turn to Spinoza, for\nwhom Deleuze’s admiration was seemingly limitless; for Deleuze,\nSpinoza was the “prince” or even the “Christ”\nof philosophers. There are many Spinozist inheritances in Deleuze, but\none of the most important is certainly the notion of univocity in\nontology. Univocity—as opposed to its great rivals, equivocity\nand analogy—is the key to developing a “philosophy of\ndifference” (Deleuze’s term for his project in Difference\nand Repetition), in which difference would no longer be\nsubordinated to identity. The result is a Spinozism minus substance, a\npurely modal or differential universe. In univocity, as Deleuze reads\nSpinoza, the single sense of Being frees a charge of difference\nthroughout all that is. In univocal ontology being is said in a single\nsense of all of which it is said, but it is said of difference\nitself. What is that difference? Difference is difference in degrees\nof “power”; in interpreting this term we must distinguish\nthe two French words puissance and pouvoir. In\nsocial terms, puissance is immanent power, power to act\nrather than power to dominate another; we could say that\npuissance is praxis (in which equals clash or act\ntogether) rather than poiesis (in which others are matter to\nbe formed by the command of a superior, a sense of transcendent power\nthat matches what pouvoir indicates for Deleuze). In the most\ngeneral terms Deleuze develops throughout his career,\npuissance is the ability to affect and to be affected, to\nform assemblages or consistencies, that is, to form emergent unities\nthat nonetheless respect the heterogeneity of their components. (Here\nwe see the empiricist theme of the “externality of\nrelations”: in an assemblage or consistency, the\n“becoming” or relation of the terms attains its own\nindependent ontological status. In Deleuze’s favorite example, the\nwasp and orchid create a “becoming” or symbiotic emergent\nunit.) \n\nAlthough Deleuze wrote a touching and certainly important book in\ntribute to his friend Foucault after the latter’s death in 1984, the\nfinal important figure in Deleuze’s readings of other philosophers is\nLeibniz, to whom, it must be recalled, Maimon appealed in his\ncriticism of Kant. In 1988, Deleuze published a book on Leibniz\nentitled The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque, which added new\nelements to the reading of Leibniz that appeared in Deleuze’s earlier\nbooks: an interpretation centered on the concept of the fold, a\ndevelopment of a concept of the Baroque, and a attempt to define a\nneo-Leibnizianism in terms of contemporary artistic and scientific\npractices. While The Fold is a fascinating work, we will\nconcentrate here on Deleuze’s early reading of Leibniz, which plays an\nimportant role in Difference and Repetition. \n\nDeleuze pushes Leibniz’s thought to a point where Leibniz could never\nhave taken it, given his theological presuppositions. This is the\npoint where one begins to consider the virtual domain on its own\naccount, freed from its actualization in a world and its individuals.\nOn this score, Deleuze often likes to cite Jorge Luis Borges’s famous\nstory, “The Garden of the Forking Paths,” in which such a\nvirtual world is described in the labyrinthine book of a Chinese\nphilosopher named Ts’ui Pên: “In all fiction, when a man\nis faced with alternatives, he chooses one at the expense of\nothers. In the almost unfathomable Ts’ui Pên, he\nchooses—simultaneously—all of them… In Ts’ui\nPên’s work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the\npoint of departure for other bifurcations.” Leibniz had in fact\ngiven a similar presentation of the world at the conclusion of the\nTheodicy. In Deleuze’s transformation of the Leibnizian /\nBorgesian image, the three Kantian transcendent Ideas of God, World,\nand Self all take on a completely different demeanor. First, God is no\nlonger a Being who compares and chooses the richest compossible world;\nhe has now become a pure Process that affirms incompossibilities and\npasses through them. (As the notion of “process” here\nattests, Deleuze’s relation to Whitehead is one of the most important\ncontemporary issues for students of his thought; although the points\nof comparison are many, Deleuze himself rarely discussed Whitehead,\nsave for several important pages in The Fold.) Second, the\nworld is no longer a continuous world defined by its pre-established\nharmony; instead, divergences, bifurcations, and incompossibles must\nnow be seen to belong to one and the same universe, a chaotic universe\nin which divergent series trace endlessly bifurcating paths, and give\nrise to violent discords and dissonances that are never resolved into\na harmonic tonality: a “chaosmos,” as Deleuze puts it\n(borrowing a word from Joyce) and no longer a world. In contrast,\nLeibniz could only save the “harmony” of this world by\nrelegating discordances and disharmonies to other possible\nworlds—this was his theological sleight of hand.  Third, selves\nor individuals, rather than being closed upon the compossible and\nconvergent world they express from within, are now torn open, and kept\nopen through the divergent series and incompossible ensembles that\ncontinually pull them outside themselves. The “monadic”\nsubject, as Deleuze puts it, becomes the “nomadic”\nsubject. In other words, if Deleuze is Leibnizian, it is only by\neliminating the idea of a God who chooses the best of all possible\nworlds, with its pre-established harmony and well-established selves;\nin Deleuze, incompossibilities and dissonances belong to one and the\nsame world, the only world, our world. But they belong to our world as\nits virtual register; developing the thought of the virtual is one of\nthe great challenges of Deleuze’s masterpiece, Difference and\nRepetition, to which we now turn. \n\nDeleuze’s historical monographs were, in a sense, preliminary sketches\nfor the great canvas of Difference and Repetition (1968),\nwhich marshaled these resources from the history of philosophy in an\nambitious project to construct a “philosophy of\ndifference.” Following Maimon’s critique, Difference and\nRepetition produces a two-fold shift from the Kantian project of\nproviding the universal and necessary conditions for possible\nexperience. First, rather than seeking the conditions\nfor possible experience, Deleuze wants to provide an account\nof the genesis of real experience, that is, the experience of\nthis concretely existing individual here and now. Second, to respect\nthe demands of the philosophy of difference, the genetic principle\nmust itself be a differential principle.  \n\nHowever, despite these departures, Deleuze maintains a crucial\nalignment with Kant; Difference and Repetition is still a\ntranscendental approach. Here we should remind ourselves that the\nterms “transcendent” and “transcendental” have\nopposing significations. Transcendental philosophy in fact critiques\nthe pretensions of other philosophies to transcend experience by\nproviding strict criteria for the use of syntheses immanent to\nexperience. On this score, at least, Deleuze aligns himself with\nKant’s critical philosophy. \n\nThree further preliminary notes are in order here. First, as we will\ndiscuss in section 4 below, the Capitalism and Schizophrenia\nproject of Deleuze and Guattari will bring to the fore naturalist\ntendencies that are only implicitly present in the still-Kantian\nframework of Difference and Repetition. So, although there is\nsome risk of reading backwards in this formulation, we can say that\nthe “of” in the phrase “the experience of this\nconcretely existing individual here and now” is both subjective\nand objective. It is the experience by human subjects of this\nindividual object in front of it, and it is the experience enjoyed by\nthe concretely existing individual itself, even when that individual\nis non-human or even non-living. (Deleuze’s panpsychism is treated\nbriefly in Protevi 2011.) Second, then, in the demand for genetic\nprinciples to account for the real experience of concrete individuals,\nDeleuze is working in the tradition of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason. Third, the notion of “genesis” is itself double;\nin Chapter 3, Deleuze lays out a dynamic genesis that moves from an\nencounter with intensity in sensation to the thinking of virtual\nIdeas, while Chapters 4 and 5 lay out a static genesis that moves from\nthe virtual Idea through an intensive individuation process to an\nactual entity.  \n\nWe are now ready to discuss the book itself. Murphy 1992 suggests that\nthe first part of the book (the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2)\nconstitutes Deleuze’s treatment of the history of philosophy, while in\nthe second part of the book (Chapters 4 and 5) Deleuze is doing\nphilosophy in his own name. From this point of view, Chapter 3, on the\n“image of thought,” plays a pivotal role, leading us into\nDeleuze’s own philosophy. This transitional role of Chapter 3 is\nconfirmed elsewhere when Deleuze says that the study of the image of\nthought is the “prolegomena to philosophy”\n(Negotiations, 149). \n\nIn Chapters 1 and 2, to find a differential genetic principle, Deleuze\nworks through the history of philosophy to isolate the concepts of\n“difference in itself” and “repetition for\nitself” that the assumptions of previous philosophies had\nprevented from being formulated. “Difference in itself” is\ndifference that is freed from identities seen as metaphysically\nprimary. Normally, difference is conceived of as an empirical relation\nbetween two terms which each has a prior identity of its own (“x\nis different from y”). Deleuze inverts this priority: identity\npersists, but is now a something produced by a prior relation between\ndifferentials (dx rather than not-x). Difference is no longer\nan empirical relation but becomes a transcendental principle that\nconstitutes the sufficient reason of empirical diversity (for example,\nit is the difference of electrical potential between cloud and ground\nthat constitutes the sufficient reason of the phenomenon of\nlightning). \n\nIn Chapter 2, the concept of “repetition for itself” is\nproduced as repetition that is freed from being repetition of an\noriginal self-identical thing so that it can be the repetition of\ndifference. Following the formula of Deleuze’s reading of Nietzsche’s\neternal return, repetition is the return of the differential genetic\ncondition of real experience each time there is an indviduation of a\nconcrete entity. Ultimately, then, Difference and Repetition\nwill show that the individuation of entities is produced by the\nactualization, integration, or resolution (the terms are synonymous\nfor Deleuze) of a differentiated virtual field of Ideas or\n“multiplicities” that are themselves changed, via\n“counter-effectuation,” in each individuating event. \n\nChapter 3 lays out 8 postulates of the “dogmatic image of\nthought.” Between the first four and last four postulates we\nfind a theory of the faculties, which is thus at the crossroads of\nboth the chapter and the book. \n\nLet us take up the first four postulates. The first postulate concerns\nour supposed natural disposition to think; the denial of this is what\nnecessitates our being forced to think. The second and third\npostulates concern subjective and objective unity. Subjective unity is\ncaptured by the notion of “common sense” such that our\nfaculties of sensation, memory, imagination, and thought work in\nharmony, while objective unity is captured by the notion of\n“recognition” such that it is the same object that is\nsensed, remembered, imagined, and thought. The fourth postulate\nconcerns “representation”, a key target of Deleuze’s\ncritique. Here difference is submitted to a fourfold structure that\nrenders difference subordinate to identity: 1) identity in the\nconcept; 2) opposition of predicates; 3) analogy in judgment; and 4)\nresemblance in perception. A good way to approach Deleuze’s notion of\nrepresentation is via Aristotle and Porphyry. Specific differences are\nthe opposed predicates that function on a horizon of identity in the\nconcept under division; thus animal is the genus that is divided into\nrational and irrational as specific differences that enable the\nisolation of the species “human.” Then, we find that the\ndifference between individuals of the same species is infra-conceptual\nand can only be made via the perception of resemblances; Theaetetus\nlooks like Socrates but not so much that they cannot be\ndistinguished. Finally, the relation of substance to the other\ncategories is analogical, such that being is said in many ways, but\nwith substance as the primary way in which it is said. \n\nAfter the first four postulates, we find the theory of the faculties,\nwhich will be Deleuze’s account of what it means to be\n“forced” to think in differential rather than identitarian\nterms. To free a notion of “difference in itself” such\nthat difference need not be thought on the basis of a prior horizon of\nidentity, Deleuze looks for an “encounter,” a sensation\nthat cannot be thought, that cannot find the empirical category under\nwhich an object can be recognized, and thus forces the\n“transcendent exercise” of the faculty of sensibility,\nwhen something can only be sensed. \n\nHere we see the dynamic genesis from intensity in sensation to the\nthinking of virtual Ideas. Each step here has a distinct Kantian\necho. The faculties are linked in order; here Deleuze as well as Kant\nlooks to the privilege of sensibility as the origin of\nknowledge—the “truth of empiricism.” With\nsensibility, pure difference in intensity is grasped immediately in\nthe encounter as the sentiendum, that which can only be\nsensed. In the differential theory of the faculties, sensibility,\nimagination, memory, and thought all “communicate a\nviolence” from one to the other—here Deleuze works with\nthe Kantian notion of the sublime as discordant accord of the\nfaculties. The “free form of difference” in intensity\nmoves each faculty and communicates its violence to the next, though\nin this case there is no supernatural vocation that will redeem the\nconflict of imagination and reason, as there is in the resolution to\nthe discussion of the sublime in the Critique of\nJudgment. Rather than a reconciliation of the faculties, with\nthought, a “fractured self”—here Deleuze takes up\nKant’s notion of the split between the empirical ego and the\nTranscendental subject—is constrained to think “difference\nin itself” in Ideas. \n\nWe won’t discuss the last four postulates in detail, as they concern\nthe theory of Ideas, the topic of Chapter 4, which we will shortly\ndiscuss. For now, let us note that two of Deleuze’s technical terms,\nintensity and virtuality, occupy two different places on this line of\ndynamic genesis. Intensity is the characteristic of the encounter, and\nsets off the process of thinking, while virtuality is the\ncharacteristic of the Idea. \n\nWith the notions of intensive and extensive we come upon a crucial\ndistinction for Deleuze that is explored in Chapters 4 and 5\nof Difference and Repetition. Extensive differences, such as\nlength, area or volume, are intrinsically divisible. A volume of\nmatter divided into two equal halves produces two volumes, each having\nhalf the extent of the original one. Intensive differences, by\ncontrast, refer to properties such as temperature or pressure that\ncannot be so divided. If a volume of water whose temperature is\n90º is divided in half, the result is two volumes at the original\ntemperature, not two volumes at 45º. However, the important\nproperty of intensity is not that it is indivisible, but that it is a\nproperty that cannot be divided without involving a change in\nkind. The temperature of a volume of water, for instance, can be\n“divided” by heating the container from below, causing a\ntemperature difference between the top and the bottom. In so doing,\nhowever, we change the system qualitatively; moreover, if the\ntemperature differences reach a certain threshold (if they attain a\ncertain “intensity” in Deleuze’s terms), the system will\nundergo a “phase transition,” losing symmetry and changing\nits dynamics, entering into a periodic pattern of\nmotion—convection—which displays extensive properties of\nsize: X centimeters of length and breadth. Drawing on these kinds of\nanalyses, Deleuze will assign a transcendental status to the\nintensive: intensity, he argues, constitutes the genetic condition of\nextensive space. Intensive processes are themselves in turn structured\nby Ideas or multiplicities. \n\nAn Idea or multiplicity is really a process of progressive\ndetermination of differential elements, differential relations, and\nsingularities. Let us take these step-by-step. “Elements”\nmust have no independent existence from the system in which they\ninhere; phonemes as the elements of the virtual linguistic Idea are an\nexample Deleuze uses in Difference and Repetition. When\nphonemes are actualized they enter into differential relations that\ndetermine the patterns of individual languages; thus the English\nphoneme /p/ is reciprocally determined by its differences from /t/,\n/b/, /d/, and so on. Finally, these differential relations of an\nindividual language determine singularities or remarkable points at\nwhich the pattern of that language can shift: the Great Vowel Shift of\nMiddle English being an example, or more prosaically, dialect\npronunciation shifts. \n\nFor another example—and here, in the applicability of his schema\nto widely divergent registers, is one of the aspects of Deleuze as\nmetaphysician—let us try to construct the Idea of\nhurricanes. The differential elements would be material\n“flows” driven by intensive differences in temperature and\npressure but undetermined in form (neither smooth nor turbulent,\nneither big nor small) and function (neither forming nor destroying of\nweather events). These flows qua differential elements enter into\nrelations of reciprocal determination linking changes in any one\nelement to changes in the others; thus temperature and pressure\ndifferences will link changes in air and water currents to each other:\nupdrafts are related to downdrafts even if the exact relations (the\ntightness of the links, the velocity of the flows) are not yet\ndetermined. Finally, at singular points in these relations\nsingularities are determined that mark qualitative shifts in the\nsystem, such as the formation of thunderstorm cells, the eye wall, and\nso on. But this is still the virtual Idea of hurricanes; real existent\nhurricanes will have measurable values of these variables so that we\ncan move from the philosophical realm of sufficient reason to that of\nscientific causation. A hurricane is explained by its Idea, but it is\ncaused by real wind currents driven by real temperature supplied by\nthe sun to tropical waters. \n\nTo see how Ideas are transcendental and immanent, we have to\nappreciate that an Idea is a concrete universal. In an early article\non Bergson (“The Conception of Difference in Bergson”\n[1956]), Deleuze gave a particularly helpful example of this\nnotion. In La Pensée et le Mouvant, Bergson had shown\nthat there are two ways of determining what the spectrum of\n“colors” have in common. (1) You can extract from\nparticular colors an abstract and general idea of color (“by\nremoving from the red that which makes it red, from the blue what\nmakes it blue, from the green what makes it green”). Or, (2) you\ncan make all these colors “pass through a convergent lens,\nbringing them to a single point,” in which case a “pure\nwhite light” is obtained that “makes the differences\nbetween the shades stand out.” The former case defines a single\ngeneric “concept” with a plurality of objects; the\nrelation between concept and object is one of subsumption; and the\nstate of difference remains exterior to the thing. The second case, on\nthe contrary, defines a differential Idea in the Deleuzean sense: the\ndifferent colors are no longer objects under a concept, but constitute\nan order of mixture in coexistence and succession within the Idea; the\nrelation between the Idea and a given color is not one of subsumption,\nbut one of actualization and differenciation; and the state of\ndifference between the concept and the object is internalized in the\nIdea itself, so that the concept itself has become the object. White\nlight is still a universal, but it is a concrete universal, and not a\ngenus or generality. \n\nThe Idea of color is thus like white light, which\n“perplexes” within itself the genetic elements and\nrelations of all the colors, but which is actualized in the diverse\ncolors and their respective spaces. (Like the word\n“problem,” Deleuze uses the word “perplexion”\nto signify, not a coefficient of doubt, hesitation, or astonishment,\nbut the multiple and virtual state of Ideas. Indeed, Deleuze adopts a\nnumber of neoplatonic notions to indicate the structure of Ideas, all\nof which are derived from the root word pli [fold]:\nperplication, complication, implication, explication, and\nreplication.) Similarly, the Idea of sound could be conceived of as a\nwhite noise, just as there is also a white society or a white\nlanguage, which contains in its virtuality all the phonemes and\nrelations destined to be actualized in the diverse languages and in\nthe remarkable parts of a same language. \n\nWe can now move to discuss Chapter 5, on the individuation of\nconcretely existing real entities as the actualization of a virtual\nIdea. In isolating the conditions of genesis, Deleuze sets up a\ntripartite ontological scheme, positing three interdependent\nregisters: the virtual, intensive, and actual. Deleuze’s basic notion\nis that in all realms of being intensive morphogenetic processes\nfollow differential virtual multiplicities to produce localized and\nindividuated actual substances with extensive properties. Simply put,\nthe actualization of the virtual proceeds by way of intensive\nprocesses. Beneath the actual (any one state of a system), we find\n“impersonal individuations” or intensive morphogenetic\nprocesses that produce system states and beneath these we find\n“pre-individual singularities” (that is, the key elements\nin virtual fields, marking system thresholds that structure the\nintensive morphogenetic processes). We thus have to distinguish the\nintense “impersonal” field of individuation and its\nprocesses from the virtual “pre-individual” field of\ndifferential relations and singularities that make up an Idea or\nmultiplicity. \n\nTying together the themes of difference, multiplicity, virtuality and\nintensity, at the heart of Difference and Repetition we find\na theory of Ideas (dialectics) based neither on an essential model of\nidentity (Plato), nor a regulative model of unity (Kant), nor a\ndialectical model of contradiction (Hegel), but rather on a\nproblematic and genetic model of difference. Ideas define the being of\na thing, but one cannot attain an Idea through the Socratic question\n“What is … ?” (which posits Ideas as transcendent\nand eternal), but rather through “minor” questions such as\n“Which one?” “Where?” “When?”\n“How?” “How many?” “In which\ncase?” “From which viewpoint?”—all of which\nallow one to define the differential Ideas immanent in the intensive\nprocesses they structure. \n\nFrom these examples we can see that Ideas structure the intensive\nprocesses that give rise to the behavior patterns of systems, and\ntheir singularities mark the thresholds at which systems change\nbehavior patterns. In a word, the virtual Idea is the transformation\nmatrix for material systems or bodies. Bodies are determined\n“solutions” to the “problem” that lays out the\nmanifold options for incarnating bodies of that nature. Ideas then\nrespond to the question “who?” (who is it that incarnates\nthe Idea in this case?) rather than the essentialist “what\nis?” (what are the properties of the substance that provide the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the class of\nwhich the object is a member?)  \n\nFor orientation purposes, it’s useful to consider Gilbert Simondon’s\ntheory of individuation as a very simple model for what Deleuze calls\n“actualization.” For Simondon, crystallization is a\nparadigm of individuation: a supersaturated solution is metastable;\nfrom that pre-individuated field, replete with gradients of density\nthat are only implicit “forms” or “potential\nfunctions,” individual crystals precipitate out. The crucial\ndifference is that crystals form in homogenous solutions, while the\nDeleuzean virtual is composed of “Ideas” or\n“multiplicities” involving differential relations among\nheterogeneous components, whose rates of change are connected with\neach other. For an example of such heterogeneity, let us return to\nhurricane formation, the Idea of which we sketched above. Here it\nshould be intuitively clear that there is no central command, but a\nself-organization of multiple processes of air and water movement\npropelled by temperature and pressure differences. All hurricanes form\nwhen intensive processes of wind and ocean currents reach singular\npoints. These singular points, however, are not unique to any one\nhurricane, but are virtual for each actual hurricane, just as the\nboiling point of water is virtual for each actual pot of tea on the\nstove. In other words, all hurricanes share the same virtual structure\neven as they are singular individuations or actualizations of that\nstructure. \n\nIn this treatment, we have concentrated on only some of the\nmetaphysics in Difference and Repetition; much more could be\nsaid about the role that Nietzsche’s thought of the eternal return\nplays therein, in addition to Deleuze’s remarks on a dizzying array of\nfigures from Plato and Scotus to Freud and Artaud. In the interests of\nspace, however, let us move to a brief treatment of Deleuze’s second\nmajor work of the late 1960s, Logic of Sense. \n\nWhile Difference and Repetition ranges over a wide field of\nphilosophical topics, Logic of Sense focuses on two aspects\nof a single issue, the structure and genesis of sense. The genius of\nFrege and Russell was to have discovered that the condition of truth\n(denotation) lies in the domain of sense. In order for a proposition\nto be true (or false) it must have a sense; a nonsensical proposition\ncan be neither true nor false. Yet they betrayed this insight, Deleuze\nargues, because they—like Kant before them—remained\ncontent with establishing the condition of truth rather than its\ngenesis. In Logic of Sense, Deleuze attacks this problem,\nfirst developing the paradoxes that result from the structure of sense\nand then sketching a theory of its genesis. He does this using\nresources from analytic philosophy and the Stoics in the course of a\nreading of Lewis Carroll—a typically innovative, if not quirky,\nset of Deleuzean references. \n\nIn the first part of the book, Deleuze analyzes the structure of\nsense. He begins by identifying three types of relation within\npropositions: \n\nPropositions, in other words, can be related either to the objects to\nwhich they refer, or to the subjects who utter them, or to other\npropositions. But each of these relations, in turn, can be taken to be\nprimary. (1) In the domain of speech, it is the “I” that\nbegins: manifestation not only makes denotation possible (Hume), but\nis also prior to signification (Descartes’ cogito). (2) In\nthe domain of language, however, it is signification that is primary,\nsince one is always born into a preexisting language, and signified\nconcepts are always primary in relation to the self as a manifested\nperson or to things as designated objects. (3) Yet in the domain of\nlogic we see the primacy of designation: as shown by the hypothetical\nmode of implications, the logical value of demonstration is not the\ntruth, but rather the conditions of truth (the conditions of\npossibility under which the proposition would be true); the premises\nmust thus be posited as effectively true, which forces one to leave\nthe pure order of implication in order to relate the premises to a\ndenoted state of affairs. Logical designation, in other words, cannot\nfulfill its putative role as foundation, since it presupposes an\nirreducible denotation. \n\nThe theory of the proposition is thus caught in a circle, with each\ncondition in turn being conditioned by what it supposedly conditions.\n“For the condition of truth to avoid this defect,” Deleuze\nargues, “it would have to have something unconditioned capable\nof assuring a real genesis of designation and the other dimensions of\nthe proposition: the condition of truth would then be defined, no\nlonger as the form of conceptual possibility, but as an ideal matter\nor ‘medium’ [matière ou ‘couche’\nidéelle], that is, no longer as signification, but as\nsense” (LS 19). Sense, then, would be a fourth dimension of\npropositions, for which Deleuze reserves the term expression. For\nDeleuze as for Frege, sense is what is expressed in a proposition; the\ntwo senses of “morning star” and “evening\nstar” are two ways in which the same denotatum may be\nexpressed in propositions. \n\nDeleuze’s contribution to the philosophy of sense really begins to\ntake off when he shows that the attempt to make this fourth dimension\nevident is akin to Lewis Carroll’s Hunt for the Snark, or to\nunraveling a Möbius strip, since sense has neither a physical nor\na mental existence. Deleuze suggests that it was the Stoics who first\ndiscovered the dimension of sense when they distinguished between\ncorporeal mixtures and incorporeal events. I can attribute the proper\nname “Battle of Waterloo” to a particular state of\naffairs, but the battle itself is an incorporeal event (or sense) with\nno other reality than that of the expression of my proposition; what\nwe find in the state of affairs are bodies mixing with one\nanother—spears stabbing flesh, bullets flying through the air,\ncannons firing, bodies being ripped apart—and the battle itself\nis the effect or the result of this intermingling of\nbodies. Sense thus has a complex status. On the one hand, it does not\nexist outside the proposition that expresses it, but it cannot be\nconfused with the proposition, since it has a distinct\n“objectity” of its own (it does not exist, but rather\n“subsists” or “insists”). On the other hand,\nit is attributed to states of affairs or things, but it cannot be\nconfused or identified with state of affairs, nor with a quality or\nrelation of these states. “Sense is both the expressible or the\nexpressed of the proposition, and the attribute of the state of\naffairs. It turns one side toward things, and another side toward\npropositions. But it cannot be confused with the proposition which\nexpressed it any more than with the state of affairs or the quality\nwhich the proposition denotes. It is exactly the boundary between\npropositions and things” (LS 22). \n\nThe structure of sense generates a number of paradoxes, which Deleuze\ndistinguishes from the paradoxes of signification discovered by\nRussell in set theory (the set of all sets, and the “barber of\nthe regiment”). The first is the paradox of regress, or\nindefinite proliferation: I can never state the sense of what I am\nsaying, but I can take the sense of what I am saying as the object of\nanother proposition, whose sense in turn I cannot state, ad\ninfinitum. This first paradox points both to the impotence of the\nspeaker (my inability to state the sense of what I am saying) and to\nthe highest power of language (its infinite capability to speak about\nwords). The second paradox is that of sterile reiteration or doubling:\none can avoid the infinite regress by extracting sense as the mere\ndouble of a proposition, but at the price of catapulting us into a\nthird paradox of neutrality or sterility—sense is necessarily\nneutral with regard to the various modes of the proposition: quality\n(affirmation, negation), quantity (all, some, none), relation, and\nmodality (possibility, reality, necessity). \n\nThus extracted from the proposition, Deleuze argues that sense has the\nstatus of a pure ideational event, irreducible to\npropositions and their three dimensions: (1) the states of affairs the\npropositions denote; (2) the experiences or mental activities\n(beliefs, desires, images, representations) of persons who express\nthemselves in the proposition; and (3) universals or general concepts.\nBut how can sense be said to engender the other dimension of the\nproposition? This is the second task of a logic of sense: “to\ncombine the sterility of sense in relation to the proposition from\nwhich it was extracted with its power of genesis in relation to the\ndimensions of the proposition” (LS 32). \n\nIn the second half of Logic of Sense, Deleuze analyzes what\nhe calls the dynamic genesis of language, drawing in part from texts\nin developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. “What renders\nlanguage possible,” he writes, “is that which separates\nsounds from bodies and organizes them into propositions, freeing them\nfor the expressive function” (LS 181). Deleuze distinguishes\nthree stages in the dynamic genesis, which at the same time constitute\nthree dimensions of language: (1) the primary order is the noise\nproduced in the depths of the body; (2) the secondary organization\nconstitutes the surface of sense (and non-sense); and (3) the tertiary\narrangement [ordonnance] is found in fully-formed\npropositions, with their functions of denotation, manifestation, and\nsignification. \n\nThe first stage of the dynamic genesis of sense, the primary order of\nlanguage, is found in the newborn infant. Deleuze draws from a\ntradition of developmental psychology whose insights are expressed in\nthe vivid image of Daniel N. Stern: the infant’s experience is a kind\nof human “weatherscape,” made up entirely of sequences of\nrisings and fallings of intensity—the jolting of a bright light\nor a sharp noise, the calming of a voice, or the explosive breakout of\na storm of hunger (The Interpersonal World of the Infant,\n1985). Deleuze will draw upon the writings of the French writer\nAntonin Artaud and call this life of intensities-in-motion the\n“body without organs.” This primary order of language\n(pure Noise as a dimension of the body) constitutes a first type of\nnonsense. But in the midst of this world of intensities, there also\nappears a particular noise: the sound of the child’s parents, or other\nadults. Long before the infant can understand words and sentences, it\ngrasps language as something that pre-exists itself, as something\nalways-already there, like a Voice on high. But for the child the\nVoice has the dimensions of language without having its\ncondition. (Adults have the same experience when they hear a foreign\nlanguage being spoken.) For the infant to accede to the tertiary\narrangement of language (denotation, manifestation, signification), it\nmust pass through its secondary organization, which is the production\nof the surface dimension of sense. How does this construction take\nplace? From the flow of the Voice, the child will extract differential\nelements of various orders (phonemes, morphemes, semantemes) and begin\nto synthesize them into diverse series. \n\nAt this point, Deleuze isolates three series or syntheses: connective,\nconjunctive, and disjunctive. In the first, the child connects\nphonemes in a concatenation of successive entities\n(“mama,” “dada”); in the second, there is the\nconstruction of esoteric words out of these phonemes through their\nintegration and conjunction (“your royal highness” is\ncontracted into “y’reince”); in the third, the child\nstarts making these esoteric words ramify and enter into relation with\nother divergent and independent series. We can clearly see that the\nconstructions of this secondary organization of sense are not yet the\nfully formed units of the tertiary arrangement of language on high,\nbut they are no longer merely the bodily noises of the primary order.\nBefore the child has any understanding of linguistic units, it\nundertakes a vast apprenticeship in their formative elements. This is\nwhy the domain of sense is the condition or ground of propositions,\nnot as their form of possibility, but as their “ideal matter or\n‘medium’”: we are positioned immediately within\nsense whenever we denote, manifest, or signify. Moreover, since sense\nlies at the frontier of words and things—it is expressed in\npropositions and attributed to states of affairs, but it cannot be\nconfused with either propositions or states of affairs—it\nengenders both the determinate dimensions of the proposition\n(denotation, manifestation, signification) as well as its objective\ncorrelates (the denoted, the manifested, and the signified). \n\nThe domain of sense is necessarily subject to a fundamental fragility,\ncapable of toppling over into nonsense: the ground gives way to a\ngroundlessness, a sans-fond. The reason for this is\nclear. Sense is never a principle or an origin; rather, it is an\neffect, it is produced, and it is produced out of elements that do\nnot, in themselves, have a sense. Sense, in other words, has a\ndeterminate relation with nonsense. Deleuze, however, distinguishes\nbetween two very different types of nonsense. The first is that of\nLewis Carroll, who remains at the surface of sense and, like children,\nmakes use of the non-signifying elements of language in order to\nconstruct the portmanteau words (snark = shark + snake; frumious =\nfurious + fuming) and nonsensical phrases (“’Twas brillig, and\nthe slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe”) that populate\nhis writing. If Logic of Sense is in part a reading of\nCarroll’s work, it is because no one knew better than Carroll about\nthe conditions for the production of sense, which Deleuze elucidates\nin detail: the extraction of differential elements or pure event,\ntheir organization in multiple series, and most importantly, the\naleatory point or paradoxical element that links the series (the ideal\n“quasi-cause” that produces the effect of sense out of\nnonsense). \n\nBut there is a second type of nonsense, which is more profound than\nthe surface nonsense found in Lewis Carroll. This is the terrifying\nnonsense of the primary order, which found expression in the writings\nof Antonin Artaud. Sense is what prevents the sonorous language from\nbeing confused with the physical body (noise). But in the primary\norder of schizophrenia experienced by Artaud, there is no longer\nanything to prevent propositions from falling back onto bodies, which\nmingle their sonorous elements with the olfactory, gustatory, and\ndigestive effects of the body (Artaud’s cris-souffles:\n“ratara ratara ratara Atara tatara rana Otara otara\nkatara”). \n\nDeleuze will develop his theory of the body-without-organs in his\ncollaboration with Félix Guattari, to which we now turn. As we\nshall see, the concept of the body-without-organs is put to work in a\ncomplex naturalistic philosophy of “desiring-production”\nthat moves far beyond the question of sense into the realms of nature,\nhistory, and politics. In other words, if Logic of Sense\nrepresents Deleuze’s confrontation with the “linguistic\nturn” that was so important for twentieth-century philosophy, it\nis a confrontation that he quickly put behind him as he came to\nembrace fully his materialist and naturalistic leanings. \n\nFollowing his work in the philosophy of difference, Deleuze meets\nGuattari in the aftermath of May 1968. These famous\n“events,” which have marked French culture and politics\never since, brought together students and workers, to the befuddlement\nof the established guardians of the revolution, the French Communist\nParty. Days of general strikes and standoffs with the police led the\nFrench President Charles de Gaulle to call a general election. De\nGaulle’s call for a parliamentary solution to the crisis was backed by\nthe Communists, who were evidently as scared of any revolution from\nbelow—which by definition would lack the party discipline they\nso craved—as were the official holders of State power, to whose\nposition they aspired. The worker-student movement eventually\ncollapsed, leaving memories of non-scripted social interactions and\nrevealing the investments of the Party, lampooned thereafter as\n“bureaucrats of the revolution,” in Foucault’s words in\nhis Preface to the English translation of Anti-Oedipus. The\nFrench Communist Party’s agreement with De Gaulle to allow a\nparliamentary solution to the social crisis was a glaring example of\nthe horizon of identity (the desire that someone be in control of a\ncentral State bureaucracy) that allowed an opposition (of the\nGaullists and the Communists as rivals for control of the State) to\nshackle difference. The government response to May 1968 changed French\nacademic life in two ways. First, institutionally, by the creation of\nParis VIII (Vincennes) where Deleuze taught; and second, in the\ndirection of the philosophy of difference, which became explicitly\npolitical post-1968.  It became, in fact, a politics of philosophy\ndedicated to exposing the historical force relations producing\nidentity in all its ontological and epistemological forms. In other\nwords, the philosophy of difference now set out to show how the\nunified objects of the world, the unified subjects who know and hence\ncontrol them, the unified bodies of knowledge that codify this\nknowledge, and the unified institution of philosophy that polices the\nwhole affair, are products of historical, political forces in combat\nwith other forces. \n\nIn purely philosophical terms, the works with Guattari naturalize the\nstill-Kantian framework of Difference and Repetition. By the\ntime of Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus Deleuze\nand Guattari explicitly thematize that the syntheses they investigate\nare fully material syntheses, syntheses of nature in geological as\nwell as biological, social, and psychological registers (Welchman\n2009). Not just organic syntheses, but inorganic ones as well, are\n“spatio-temporal dynamisms.” With this full naturalization\nof syntheses, the question of panpsychism is brought into full relief\n(Protevi 2011), since material syntheses are as much syntheses of\nexperience as they are syntheses of things, as we see in the title of\nChapter 3 of A Thousand Plateaus: “The Geology of\nMorals: Who does the earth think it is?” \n\nIn considering Anti-Oedipus we should first discuss its\nperformative effect, which attempts to “force us to\nthink,” that is, to fight against a tendency to\ncliché. Reading Anti-Oedipus can indeed be shocking\nexperience. First, we find a bizarre collection of sources; for\nexample, the schizophrenic ranting of Antonin Artaud provides one of\nthe basic concepts of the work, the “body without organs.”\nSecond is the book’s vulgarity, as in the infamous opening lines about\nthe unconscious (the Id): “It is at work everywhere, functioning\nsmoothly at times, at other times in fits and starts. It breathes, it\nheats, it eats. It shits and fucks [Ça chie, ça\nbaise]. What a mistake to have ever said the id”\n(7 / 1). A third performative effect is humor, as in the mocking of\nMelanie Klein’s analysis of children: “Say it’s Oedipus, or I’ll\nslap you upside the head [sinon t’auras un gifle]” (54\n/ 45; trans. modified). There are many more passages like this; it’s\nsafe to say very few philosophy books contain as many jokes, puns, and\ndouble entendres as Anti-Oedipus. A fourth element\nis the gleeful coarseness of the polemics. Among many other examples,\nthinkers of the signifier are associated with the lap dogs of tyrants,\nmembers of the French Communist Party are said to have fascist\nlibidinal investments, and Freud is described as a “masked Al\nCapone.” All in all, the performative effect of reading\nAnti-Oedipus is unforgettable. \n\nPassing to the conceptual structure of the book, the key term of\nAnti-Oedipus is “desiring-production,” which\ncrisscrosses Marx and Freud, putting desire in the eco-social realm of\nproduction and production in the unconscious realm of desire. Rather\nthan attempting to synthesize Marx and Freud in the usual way, that\nis, by a reductionist strategy that either (1) operates in favor of\nFreud, by positing that the libidinal investment of social figures and\npatterns requires sublimating an original investment in family figures\nand patterns, or (2) operates in favor of Marx by positing neuroses\nand psychoses as mere super-structural by-products of unjust social\nstructures, Deleuze and Guattari will call desiring-production a\n“universal primary process” underlying the seemingly\nseparate natural, social and psychological realms. Desiring-production\nis thus not anthropocentric; it is the very heart of the\nworld. Besides its universal scope, we need to realize two things\nabout desiring-production right away: (1) there is no subject that\nlies behind the production, that performs the production; and (2) the\n“desire” in desiring-production is not oriented to making\nup a lack, but is purely positive. Desiring-production is autonomous,\nself-constituting, and creative: it is the natura naturans of\nSpinoza or the will-to-power of Nietzsche. \n\nAnti-Oedipus is, along with its conceptual and terminological\ninnovation, a work of grand ambitions: among them, (1) an eco-social\ntheory of production, encompassing both sides of the nature/culture\nsplit, which functions as an ontology of change, transformation, or\n“becoming”; (2) a “universal history” of\nsocial formations—the “savage” or tribal, the\n“barbarian” or imperial, and the capitalist—which\nfunctions as a synthetic social science; (3) and to clear the ground\nfor these functions, a critique of the received versions of Marx and\nFreud—and the attempts to synthesize them by analogizing their\nrealms of application. In pursuing its ambitions,\nAnti-Oedipus has the virtues and the faults of the tour\nde force: unimagined connections between disparate elements are\nmade possible, but at the cost of a somewhat strained conceptual\nscheme. \n\nAnti-Oedipus identifies two primary registers of\ndesiring-production, the natural or “metaphysical” and the\nsocial or “historical.” They are related in the following\nway: natural desiring-production is that which social machines\nrepress, but also that which is revealed in capitalism, at the end of\nhistory (a contingent history, that is, one that avoids dialectical\nlaws of history). Capitalism sets free desiring-production even as it\nattempts to rein it in with the institution of private property and\nthe familial or “Oedipal” patterning of desire;\nschizophrenics are propelled by the charge of desiring-production thus\nset free but fail at the limits capitalist society proposes, thus\nproviding a clue to the workings of desiring-production. \n\nIt’s important at the start to realize that Deleuze and Guattari do\nnot advocate schizophrenia as a “lifestyle” or as the\nmodel for a political program. The schizophrenic, as a clinical\nentity, is the result of the interruption or the blocking of the\nprocess of desiring-production, its having been taken out of nature\nand society and restricted to the body of an individual where it spins\nin the void rather than make the connections that constitute reality.\nDesiring-production does not connect “with” reality, as in\nescaping a subjective prison to touch the objective, but it makes\nreality, it is the Real, in a twisting of the Lacanian sense of the\nterm. In Lacan, the real is produced as an illusory and retrojected\nremainder to a signifying system; for Deleuze and Guattari, the Real\nis reality itself in its process of self-making. The schizophrenic is\na sick person in need of help, but schizophrenia is an avenue into the\nunconscious, the unconscious not of an individual, but the\n“transcendental unconscious,” an unconscious that is\nsocial, historical, and natural all at once. \n\nIn studying the schizophrenic process, Deleuze and Guattari posit that\nin both the natural and social registers desiring-production is\ncomposed of three syntheses, the connective, disjunctive, and\nconjunctive; the syntheses perform three functions: production,\nrecording, and enjoyment. We can associate production with the\nphysiological, recording with the semiotic, and enjoyment with the\npsychological registers. While it is important to catch the Kantian\nresonance of “synthesis,” it is equally important to note,\nin keeping with the post-structuralist angle we discussed above, that\nthere is no subject performing the syntheses; instead, subjects are\nthemselves one of the products of the syntheses. The syntheses have no\nunderlying subject; they just are the immanent process of\ndesiring-production.  Positing a subject behind the syntheses would be\na transcendent use of the syntheses. Here we see another reference to\nthe Kantian principle of immanence. Deleuze and Guattari propose to\nstudy the immanent use of the synthesis in a “materialist\npsychoanalysis,” or “schizoanalysis”; by contrast,\npsychoanalysis is transcendent use of the syntheses, producing five\n“paralogisms” or “transcendental illusions,”\nall of which involve assigning the characteristics of the extensive\nproperties of actual products to the intensive production process, or,\nto put it in the terms of the philosophy of difference, all the\nparalogisms subordinate differential processes to identities derived\nfrom products. \n\nAccording to the “universal history” undertaken in\nAnti-Oedipus, social life has three forms of\n“socius,” the social body that takes credit for\nproduction: the earth for the tribe, the body of the despot for the\nempire, and capital for capitalism.  According to Deleuze and\nGuattari’s reading of the anthropological literature, tribal societies\nmark bodies in initiation ceremonies, so that the products of an organ\nare traced to a clan, which is mythically traced to the earth or, more\nprecisely, one of its enchanted regions, which function as the organs\non the full body of the earth. Material flows are thus\n“territorialized,” that is, traced onto the earth, which\nis credited as the source of all production. The signs in tribal\ninscription are not signifiers: they do not map onto a voice, but\nenact a “savage triangle forming … a theater of cruelty\nthat implies the triple independence of the articulated voice, the\ngraphic hand and the appreciative eye” (189). Empires overcode\nthese tribal meaning codes, tracing production back to the despot, the\ndivine father of his people. Material flows in despotic empires are\nthus “deterritorialized” (they are no longer credited to\nthe earth), and then immediately “reterritorialized” on\nthe body of the despot, who assumes credit for all production. When\ntribal signs are overcoded, the signifier is formed as a\n“deterritorialized sign” allowing for communication\nbetween the conquered and the conquerors. Signifiers are a\n“flattening” or “bi-univocalization”: two\nchains are lined up, one to one, the written and the spoken (205–6;\ncf. Derrida’s notion of “phonocentrism”). The body of the\ndespot as imperial socius means that workers are the\n“hands” of the emperor, spies are his “eyes,”\nand so on. \n\nCapitalism is the radical decoding and deterritorialization of the\nmaterial flows that previous social machines had zealously coded on\nthe earth or the body of the despot. Production is credited to the\n“body” of capital, but this form of recording works by the\nsubstitution of an “axiomatic” for a code: in this context\nan “axiomatic” means a set of simple principles for the\nquantitative calculation of the difference between flows (of\ndeterritorialized labor and capital) rather than elaborate rules for\nthe qualitative judgments that map flows onto the socius. Capitalism’s\ncommand is utterly simple: connect deterritorialized flows of labor\nand capital and extract a surplus from that connection. Thus\ncapitalism sets loose an enormous productive charge—connect\nthose flows! Faster, faster!—the surpluses of which the\ninstitutions of private property try to register as belonging to\nindividuals. Now those individuals are primarily social (as figures of\ncapitalist or laborer) and only secondarily private (family\nmembers). Whereas organs of bodies were socially marked in previous\nregimes (as belonging to the clan and earth, or as belonging to the\nemperor, as in the jus primae noctis), body organs are\nprivatized under capitalism and attached to persons as members of the\nfamily. In Deleuze and Guattari’s terms, capitalism’s decoded flows\nare reterritorialized on “persons,” that is, on family\nmembers as figures in the Oedipal triangle. \n\nThree differences between this work and its predecessor are\nimmediately apparent. First, A Thousand Plateaus has a much\nwider range of registers than Anti-Oedipus: cosmic, geologic,\nevolutionary, developmental, ethological, anthropological,\nmythological, historical, economic, political, literary, musical, and\neven more. Second, the results of the paralogisms of\nAnti-Oedipus become “strata” in A Thousand\nPlateaus: the organism (the unification and totalization of the\nconnective synthesis of production, or the physiological register),\nthe signifying totality or signifiance, which we can perhaps render as\n“signifier-ness” (the flattening or\n“bi-univocalizing” of the disjunctive synthesis of\nrecording, the semiotic register), and the subject (the reification of\nthe conjunctive synthesis of consummation, the psychological\nregister). Finally, while Anti-Oedipus has a classical\nconceptual architecture, that is, chapters that develop a single\nargument, A Thousand Plateaus is written as a\n“rhizome,” that is, as allowing immediate connections\nbetween any of its points. Because of this rhizomatic structure, a\ntraditional summary of the “theses” and arguments of A\nThousand Plateaus is either downright impossible, or at best,\nwould be much too complex to attempt in an encyclopedia article. We\nwill therefore have to limit ourselves to the following remarks. \n\nIn fourteen plateaus, or planes of intensity—productive\nconnections between immanently arrayed material systems without\nreference to an external governing source—Deleuze and Guattari\ndevelop a new materialism in which a politicized philosophy of\ndifference joins forces with the sciences explored in Difference and\nRepetition. A Thousand Plateaus is a book of strange new\nquestions: “Who Does the Earth Think It Is?,” “How\nDo You make Yourself a Body Without Organs?,” “How does\nthe war-machine ward off the apparatus of capture of the State?”\nand so on. To over-simplify, Deleuze and Guattari take up the insights\nof dynamical systems theory, which explores the various thresholds at\nwhich material systems self-organize (that is, reduce their degrees of\nfreedom, as in our previous example of convection currents). Deleuze\nand Guattari then extend the notion of self-organizing material\nsystems—those with no need of transcendent organizing agents\nsuch as gods, leaders, capital, or subjects—to the social,\nlinguistic, political-economic, and psychological realms. The\nresultant “rhizome” or de-centered network that is A\nThousand Plateaus provides hints for experimentation with the\nmore and more de-regulated flows of energy and matter, ideas and\nactions—and the attendant attempts at binding them—that\nmake up the contemporary world. \n\nA Thousand Plateaus maintains the tripartite ontological\nscheme of all of Deleuze’s work, but, as the title indicates, with\ngeological terms of reference. Deleuze and Guattari call the virtual\n“the Earth,” the intensive is called\n“consistency,” and the actual is called “the system\nof the strata.” As the latter term indicates, one of the foci of\ntheir investigations is the tendency of some systems to head toward\ncongealment or stratification. More precisely put, any concrete system\nis composed of intensive processes tending toward the (virtual) plane\nof consistency and/or toward (actual) stratification.  We can say that\nall that exists is the intensive, tending towards the limits of\nvirtuality and actuality; these last two ontological registers do not\n“exist,” but they do “insist,” to use one of\nDeleuze’s terms. Nothing ever instantiates the sheer frozen stasis of\nthe actual nor the sheer differential dispersion of the virtual;\nrather, natural or worldly processes are always and only\nactualizations, that is, they are processes of actualization\nstructured by virtual multiplicities and heading toward an actual\nstate they never quite attain. More precisely, systems also contain\ntendencies moving in the other direction, toward virtuality; systems\nare more or less stable sets of processes moving in different\ndirections, toward actuality and toward virtuality. In still other\nwords, Deleuze and Guattari are process philosophers; neither the\nstructures of such processes nor their completed products merit the\nsame ontological status as processes themselves. With this\nperspective, Deleuze and Guattari offer a detailed and complex\n“open system” which is extraordinarily rich and complex. A\nuseful way into it is to follow the concepts of coding, stratification\nand territorialization. They are related in the following\nmanner. Coding is the process of ordering matter as it is drawn into a\nbody; by contrast, stratification is the process of creating\nhierarchal bodies, while territorialization is the ordering of those\nbodies in “assemblages,” that is to say, an emergent unity\njoining together heterogeneous bodies in a\n“consistency.” \n\nThese concepts, and several other networks of concepts considerations\nof space preclude us from considering, are put to work in addressing\nthe following topics. After a discussion of the notion of\n“rhizome” in the first chapter (or “plateau”\nas they call it), Deleuze and Guattari quickly dismiss psychoanalysis\nin the second. In the third chapter they discuss the process of\nstratification in physical, organic, and social strata, with special\nattention to questions in population genetics, where speciation can be\nthought to stratify or channel the flow of genes. In chapters 4 and 5\nthey intervene in debates in linguistics in favor of pragmatics, that\nis to say, highlighting the “incorporeal transformations”\n(labels that prompt a different form of action to be applied to a\nbody: “I now pronounce you man and wife”) that socially\nsanctioned “order words” bring about (Deleuze and Guattari\nalso refer to speech act theory in this regard).  They also lay out\nthe theory of “territories” or sets of environmentally\nembedded triggers of self-organizing processes, and the concomitant\nprocesses of deterritorialization (breaking of habits) and\nreterritorialization (formation of habits). Chapters 6 and 7 discuss\nmethods of experimenting with the strata in which we found ourselves.\nChapter 6 deals with the organic stratum or the\n“organism”; the notorious term of art “Body without\nOrgans” can be at least partially glossed as the reservoir of\npotentials for different patterns of bodily affect. Chapter 7 deals\nwith the intersection of signifiance\n(“signifier-ness”) and subjectification in\n“faciality”; the face arrests the drift of signification\nby tying meaning to the expressive gestures of a subject. Chapters 8\nand 9 deal with the social organizing practices they name\n“lines” and “segments”; of particular interest\nhere is their treatment of fascism. Chapter 10 returns to the question\nof intensive experimentation, now discussed in terms of\n“becoming,” in which (at least) two systems come together\nto form an emergent system or “assemblage.” Chapter 11\ndiscusses the “refrain” or rhythm as a means of escaping\nfrom and forming new territories, or even existing in a process of\ncontinual deterritorialization, what they call\n“consistency.” Chapters 12 and 13 discuss the relation of\nthe “war machine” and the State; the former is a form of\nsocial organization that fosters creativity (it\n“reterritorializes on deterritorialization itself”), while\nthe latter is an “apparatus of capture” living\nvampirically off of labor (here Deleuze and Guattari’s basically\nMarxist perspective is apparent). Finally, Chapter 14 discusses types\nof social constitution of space, primarily the “smooth”\nspace of war machines and the “striated” space of\nStates. \n\nAfter a long period in which each pursued his own interests, Deleuze\nand Guattari published a last collaboration in 1991, What Is\nPhilosophy? In answering\ntheir title question, Deleuze and Guattari seek to place philosophy in\nrelation to science and art, all three being modes of thought, with no\nsubordination among them. Thought, in all its modes, struggles with\nchaos against opinion. Philosophy is the creation or construction of\nconcepts; a concept is an intensive multiplicity, inscribed on a plane\nof immanence, and peopled by “conceptual personae” which\noperate the conceptual machinery. A conceptual persona is not a\nsubject, for thinking is not subjective, but takes place in the\nrelationship of territory and earth. Science creates functions on a\nplane of reference.  Art creates “a bloc of sensation, that is\nto say, a compound of percepts and affects” (WP, 164). \n\nWe will deal with Deleuze and the arts in some detail below. In\ndiscussing What is Philosophy?, let us concentrate on the\ntreatment of the relation of philosophy and science. We should\nremember at the outset that the nomad or minor science evoked in A\nThousand Plateaus is not the Royal or major science that makes up\nthe entirety of what Deleuze and Guattari call ‘science’\nin What is Philosophy?. The motives for this conflation are\nunclear; in the eyes of some, this change considerably weakens the\nvalue of the latter work. Be that as it may, in What is\nPhilosophy? Deleuze and Guattari vigorously deny that philosophy\nis needed to help science think about its own presuppositions\n(“no one needs philosophy to reflect on anything” [WP\n6]). Instead, they emphasize the complementary nature of the two.\nFirst, they point out a number of similarities between philosophy and\nscience: both are approaches to “chaos” that attempt to\nbring order to it, both are creative modes of thought, and both are\ncomplementary to each other, as well as to a third mode of creative\nthought, art. Beyond these similarities, Deleuze and Guattari\ndistinguish between philosophy as the creation of concepts on a plane\nof immanence and science as the creation of functions on a plane of\nreference. Both relate to the virtual, the differential field of\npotential transformations of material systems, but in different\nways. Philosophy gives consistency to the virtual, mapping the forces\ncomposing a system as pure potentials, what the system is capable\nof. Meanwhile, science gives it reference, determining the conditions\nby which systems behave the way they actually do. Philosophy is the\n“counter-effectuation of the event,” abstracting an event\nor change of pattern from bodies and states of affairs and thereby\nlaying out the transformative potentials inherent in things, the roads\nnot taken that coexist as compossibles or as inclusive disjunctions\n(differentiation, in the terms of Difference and Repetition),\nwhile science tracks the actualization of the virtual, explaining why\nthis one road was chosen in a divergent series or exclusive\ndisjunction (differenciation, according to Difference and\nRepetition). Functions predict the behavior of constituted\nsystems, laying out their patterns and predicting change based on\ncausal chains, while concepts “speak the event” (WP 21),\nmapping out the multiplicity structuring the possible patterns of\nbehavior of a system—and the points at which the system can\nchange its habits and develop new ones. For Deleuze and Guattari in\nWhat is Philosophy?, then, science deals with properties of\nconstituted things, while philosophy deals with the constitution of\nevents. Roughly speaking, philosophy explores the plane of immanence\ncomposed of constellations of constitutive forces that can be\nabstracted from bodies and states of affairs. It thus maps the range\nof connections a thing is capable of, its “becomings” or\n“affects.” Science, on the other hand, explores the\nconcretization of these forces into bodies and states of affairs,\ntracking the behavior of things in relation to already constituted\nthings in a certain delimited region of space and time (the\n“plane of reference”). How do concepts relate to\nfunctions? Just as there is a “concept of concept” there\nare also “concepts of functions,” but these are purely\nphilosophical creations “without the least scientific\nvalue” (WP 117). Thus concrete concepts like that of\n“deterritorialization” are philosophical concepts, not\nscientific functions, even though they might resonate with, or echo,\nscientific functions. Nor are they metaphors, as Deleuze and Guattari\nrepeatedly insist: \n\nOf course, we realize the dangers of citing scientific propositions\noutside their own sphere. It is the danger of arbitrary metaphor or of\nforced application. But perhaps these dangers are averted if we\nrestrict ourselves to taking from scientific operators a particular\nconceptualizable character which itself refers to non-scientific\nareas, and converges with science without applying it or making it a\nmetaphor (Deleuze 1989: 129). \n\nDeleuze and Guattari’s refusal to recognize that their work contains\nmetaphors is due to their struggle against the\n“imperialism” of the signifying regime, a major theme in\nboth Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus: not every\nrelation between different intellectual fields can be grasped by the\nmost common notions of “metaphor,” reliant as they are on\nthe notion of a transfer of sense from primary to secondary\nsignification. \n\nKant had dissociated aesthetics into two halves: the theory of\nsensibility as the form of possible experience (the\n“Transcendental Aesthetic” of the Critique of Pure\nReason), and the theory of art as a reflection on real experience\n(the “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” in the Critique\nof Judgment). In Deleuze’s work, these two halves of aesthetics\nare reunited: if the most general aim of art is to “produce a\nsensation,” then the genetic principles of sensation are at the\nsame time the principles of composition for works of art; conversely,\nit is works of art that are best capable of revealing these conditions\nof sensibility. Deleuze therefore writes on the arts not as a critic\nbut as a philosopher, and his books and essays on the various\narts—including the cinema (Cinema I and II), literature\n(Essays Critical and Clinical), and painting (Francis\nBacon: The Logic of Sensation)—must be read as\nphilosophical explorations of this transcendental domain of\nsensibility. The cinema, for instance, produces images that move, and\nthat move in time, and it is these two aspects of film that Deleuze\nset out to analyze in The Movement-Image and The\nTime-Image: “What exactly does the cinema show us about\nspace and time that the other arts don’t show?” Deleuze thus\ndescribes his two-volume Cinema as “a book of logic, a\nlogic of the cinema” that sets out “to isolate certain\ncinematographic concepts,” concepts which are specific to the\ncinema, but which can only be formed philosophically. Francis\nBacon: The Logic of Sensation likewise creates a series of\nphilosophical concepts, each of which relates to a particular aspect\nof Bacon’s paintings, but which also find a place in “a general\nlogic of sensation.” In general, Deleuze will locate the\nconditions of sensibility in an intensive conception of space and a\nvirtual conception of time, which are necessarily actualized in a\nplurality of spaces and a complex rhythm of times (for instance, in\nthe non-extended spaces and non-linear times of modern mathematics and\nphysics). \n\nFor Deleuze, the task of art is to produce “signs” that\nwill push us out of our habits of perception into the conditions of\ncreation. When we perceive via the re-cognition of the properties of\nsubstances, we see with a stale eye pre-loaded with clichés; we\norder the world in what Deleuze calls “representation.” In\nthis regard, Deleuze cites Francis Bacon: we’re after an artwork that\nproduces an effect on the nervous system, not on the brain. What he\nmeans by this figure of speech is that in an art encounter we are\nforced to experience the “being of the sensible.” We get\nsomething that we cannot re-cognize, something that is\n“imperceptible”—it doesn’t fit the hylomorphic\nproduction model of perception in which sense data, the\n“matter” or hyle of sensation, is ordered by\nsubmission to conceptual form. Art however cannot be re-cognized, but\ncan only be sensed; in other words, art splits perceptual processing,\nforbidding the move to conceptual ordering. This is exactly what Kant\nin the Third Critique called reflective judgment: when the concept is\nnot immediately given in the presentation of art. With art we reach\n“sensation,” or the “being of the sensible,”\nthe sentiendum. \n\nDeleuze talks about this effect of sensation as the\n“transcendent exercise” of the faculty of sensibility;\nhere we could refer to the third chapter of Difference and\nRepetition, where Deleuze lays out a non-Kantian\n“differential theory of the faculties.” In this remarkable\ntheory, intensity is “difference in itself,” that which\ncarries the faculties to their limits. The faculties are linked in\norder; here we see what Deleuze calls the privilege of sensibility as\norigin of knowledge—the “truth of empiricism.” In\nthe differential theory of the faculties, sensibility, imagination,\nmemory, and thought all “communicate a violence” from one\nto the other. With sensibility, pure difference in intensity is\ngrasped immediately in the encounter as the sentiendum; with\nimagination, the disparity in the phantasm is that which can only be\nimagined. With memory, in turn, the memorandum is the\ndissimilar in the pure form of time, or the immemorial of transcendent\nmemory. With thought, a fractured self is constrained to think\n“difference in itself” in Ideas. Thus the “free form\nof difference” moves each faculty and communicates its violence\nto the next. You have to be forced to think, starting with an art\nencounter in which intensity is transmitted in signs or sensation.\nRather than a “common sense” in which all the faculties\nagree in recognizing the “same” object, we find in this\ncommunicated violence a “discordant harmony” (compare the\nKantian sublime) that tears apart the subject (here we find the notion of\n“cruelty” Deleuze picks up from Artaud). \n\nThe writings of Deleuze have provoked a large literature of\nexplication and introduction in both French and English; more\nrecently, works in German, Italian, and other European languages have\nappeared.  There have also been noteworthy critiques. Rather than\nattempt a complete survey of the voluminous secondary literature, we\nwill concentrate on a few of the major critiques. \n\nAn early wave of criticism was directed in the 1980s at Deleuze’s\ncollaborations with Guattari by feminists such as Alice Jardine and\nLuce Irigaray. Jardine 1985 criticized the concept of\n“becoming-woman” in A Thousand Plateaus, which\nDeleuze and Guattari position as the first step towards a\nde-subjectivizing “becoming-indiscernible.” Jardine argued\nthat Deleuze and Guattari’s claim that even women must undergo a\n“becoming-woman” amounts to a threat to the hard-fought\nvictories of concrete feminist struggle that allowed women to claim a\nsubjectivity in the first place. According to Grosz 1994’s survey of\nthe early feminist critiques, Irigaray argued that the use of\n“becoming-woman” as a figure of change incumbent upon all,\nincluding men, amounts to a masculinist and desexualizing\nappropriation of feminist struggle. In the 1990s and now into the\n2000s, a number of feminists associated with the “corporeal\nfeminism” movement have attempted positive connections with\nDeleuze in the name of an open and experimental attitude toward bodily\npotentials, in both the singular and political registers, as in the\nphrase “body politic.” See among others Braidotti 1994 and\n2002; Gatens 1996; Grosz 1994 and 1995; Olkowski 1999; Lorraine 1999;\nand the essays in Buchanan and Colebrook 2002. \n\nOne of the most important criticisms of Deleuze was put forth in\nBadiou 1997. Badiou claimed, contrary to the dominant perception, that\nDeleuze is not so much a philosopher of the multiple as of the\nOne. Conducted in the highly technical idiom for which he is known,\nBadiou criticizes Deleuze for a certain vitalism, which in Badiou’s\neyes falls short of the axiomatic austerity demanded of\nphilosophy. Whereas Badiou merely ignored the collaborative works with\nGuattari, Zizek 2003 conducts a polemic against the Guattari\ncollaborations in favor of a Deleuzean logic of Being characterized as\nan “immaterial affect generated by interacting bodies as a\nsterile surface of pure Becoming” (as in Logic of\nSense). A third critical work in this vein is Hallward 2005. For\nHallward, the singular logic of Deleuze’s thought is analogous to the\ntradition of theophantic thinkers, whereby the divine spark of\ncreation is entombed in creatures; the task of the creature is to\nredeem that divine spark from its creatural prison. But this\nredemption is not annihilation; Deleuze’s philosophy is not that of\nLacanian-Zizekian “renunciation-extinction.” \n\nIn response to the Badiouan critique, we can note that one of the most\npromising leads for future research in discussing the relation of\nBadiou and Deleuze is to concentrate on the type of mathematics each\nthinker prefers. Rather than accepting Badiou’s characterization of\nDeleuze as a thinker of reality in biological term (as opposed to\nBadiou’s mathematical orientation), we should see Deleuze as proposing\na “problematic” version of mathematics, versus Badiou’s\naxiomatic conception. This tack has been taken by Smith 2003. \n\nDeleuze was one of the targets of the polemic in Sokal and Bricmont\n1999. As much of their chapter on Deleuze consists of exasperated\nexclamations of incomprehension, it is hard to say what it is that\nSokal and Bricmont think they have accomplished. One thing is clear\nthough: Deleuze was perfectly aware of the finitist revolution in the\nhistory of the differential calculus, despite Sokal and Bricmont’s\nintimations otherwise. He writes in Difference and\nRepetition, “it is a mistake to tie the value of the symbol\ndx to the existence of infinitesimals; but it is also a\nmistake to refuse it any ontological or gnoseological value in the\nname of a refusal of the latter. In fact, there is a treasure buried\nwithin the old so-called barbaric or pre-scientific interpretations of\nthe differential calculus, which must be separated from its\ninfinitesimal matrix. A great deal of heart and a great deal of truly\nphilosophical naivety is needed in order to take the symbol\ndx seriously …” (170). It seems obvious here\nthat Deleuze’s treatment of early forms of the differential calculus\nis not meant as an intervention into the history of mathematics, or an\nattempt at a philosophy of mathematics, but as an investigation\nseeking to form a properly philosophical concept of difference by\nmeans of extracting certain forms of thought from what he clearly\nlabels as antiquated mathematical methods. (For positive views of\nDeleuze’s use of mathematics as provocations for the formation of his\nphilosophical concepts, see the essays in Duffy 2006.) \n\nAnother and perhaps more effective response to Sokal and Bricmont\nwould be to point to the positive work done on Deleuze and science.\nMassumi 1992 and DeLanda 2003 attempt to show that Deleuze’s\nepistemology and ontology can be brought together with the results of\ncontemporary dynamical systems theory (popularly known as\n“chaos” and “complexity” theory). Bell 2006\nfollows up on this work. Protevi 2001 looks at the accompanying\nnotions of hylomorphism and self-organization in the history of\nphilosophy; Bonta and Protevi 2004 treat Deleuze and dynamic systems\ntheory with regard to its potentials for geographical work. For other\nissues on Deleuze and science, see the essays in Marks 2006. Finally,\nAnsell Pearson 1999 brought attention to Deleuze and biology; see also\nToscano 2006 in this regard. As the interest in Deleuze continues to grow, three of its effects\nare of interest to us, one of which is sociological and the other two\nof which are philosophical. The sociological effect is the globalization of institutions\ndevoted to the study of Deleuze’s thought and its application in\nvarious fields. A noteworthy institutional initiative is the series of\nconferences sponsored by the journal Deleuze and Guattari\nStudies (see Other Internet Resources) under the leadership of\nIan Buchanan. In addition to some 10 conferences in Europe and North\nAmerica, an index of Deleuze’s widespread impact is the success of a\nnumber of conferences in Asia (to date, Taiwan, India, Singapore, and\nSouth Korea). The two philosophical effects are that of reviving interest in\nthose whom Deleuze discusses explicitly or those whose influence on\nDeleuze can be discerned, and that of providing a foil or counterpoint\nor reference point in readings of other philosophers. The most prominent example of the revivifying effect is Bergson,\nrelatively forgotten at the time of Deleuze’s Bergsonism (1966), but\nnow the subject of a growing philosophical literature. Of course, we\ncannot attribute all this interest to Deleuze’s book and to the\nsubsequent secondary literature on Deleuze that stresses the\ncontribution of Bergson to Deleuze’s system (as we ourselves do above\non the concept of the virtual and the critique of the possible), but\nit is not implausible to consider the counterfactual whereby without\nDeleuze’s work the interest in Bergson would not be as strong as it\ncurrently is. Among the Bergson commentaries Mullarkey 1999, Guerlac\n2006, Moulard-Leonard 2009, and Grosz 2017 all link the two thinkers\nin their works. The post-Kantian Salomon Maimon has been for some time now a\nsubject of specialist interest by historians of philosophy; see the\nentry on Maimon; see also the recent English\ntranslation of his major work [Maimon 1790 [2010]).  Maimon’s\nrelation to Deleuze is explored in Jones & Roffe (eds.) 2009,\nSmith 2010, and Voss 2011. Another example of thinker whose current level of interest was\narguably catalyzed by being noticed as an influence on Deleuze is the\nmid-20th century French philosopher Gilbert Simondon, whose notions of\nthe “pre-individual” and of “crystallization”\nwere influential in the development of Deleuze’s notions of the\nvirtual and actualization, respectively. Among others, see Toscano\n2006 and 2009, Scott 2014, Sauvagnargues 2016, Swan 2016, Alloa and\nMichalet 2017 for treatments of the Deleuze-Simondon relation. Yet another would be the early 20th century French sociologist\nGabriel Tarde, whose notion of microsociology is referred to\napprovingly in Deleuze and Guattari’s development of their\nnotion of “micropolitics” (Deleuze and Guattari 1980\n[1987, 216-219]). For Deleuze-inspired treatments, see Alliez 2001,\nBrighenti 2010, Read 2015, Tonkonoff 2017. More recently and to a still muted extent is the revival of\ninterest in mid-20th century French thinker Raymond Ruyer, whose\nnotion of survol or “self-survey” is mentioned by Deleuze\nand Guattari in their brief remarks on the consistency of the concept\nin its neural instantiation in What is Philosophy (Deleuze and\nGuattari 1991 [1994, 210]). English translations of Ruyer’s works are\nRuyer 2016 and 2018. Ruyer’s relation to Deleuze is explored in Bains\n2002, Bogue 2009 and 2017, and Roffe 2017. Other treatments of Ruyer\nthat are relevant would be Massumi 2014 and Grosz 2017. Finally, while it’s certainly the case that Whitehead has garnered\ncontinuous interest, a good bit of current Whitehead scholarship\nincludes reference to Deleuze as a leitmotif, as in Stengers 2011. A\nnoteworthy new work influenced by both Deleuze and Whitehead is\nWilliams 2016.

Deleuze conceived of philosophy as the\nproduction of concepts, and he characterized himself as a “pure\nmetaphysician.” In his magnum opus Difference and\nRepetition, he tries to develop a metaphysics adequate to\ncontemporary mathematics and science—a metaphysics in which the\nconcept of multiplicity replaces that of substance, event replaces\nessence and virtuality replaces possibility. Deleuze also produced\nstudies in the history of philosophy (on Hume, Nietzsche, Kant,\nBergson, Spinoza, Foucault, and Leibniz), and on the arts (a two-\nvolume study of the cinema, books on Proust and Sacher-Masoch, a work\non the painter Francis Bacon, and a collection of essays on\nliterature.) Deleuze considered these latter works as pure philosophy,\nand not criticism, since he sought to create the concepts that\ncorrespond to the artistic practices of painters, filmmakers, and\nwriters. In 1968, he met Félix Guattari, a political activist\nand radical psychoanalyst, with whom he wrote several works, among\nthem the two-volume Capitalism and Schizophrenia, comprised\nof Anti-Oedipus (1972) and\nA Thousand Plateaus (1980).  Their final collaboration was\nWhat is Philosophy? (1991).\n\n\n\nDeleuze is noteworthy for his rejection of the Heideggerian notion of\nthe “end of metaphysics.” In an interview, he once offered\nthis self-assessment: “I feel myself to be a pure\nmetaphysician.... Bergson says that modern science hasn’t found its\nmetaphysics, the metaphysics it would need. It is this metaphysics\nthat interests me.” [Villani 1999: 130.]) We should also point\nto the extent of his non-philosophical references (inter\nalia, differential calculus, thermodynamics, geology, molecular\nbiology, population genetics, ethology, embryology, anthropology,\npsychoanalysis, economics, linguistics, and even esoteric thought);\nhis colleague Jean-François Lyotard spoke of him as a\n“library of Babel.” Although it remains to be seen whether\nthe 20th century will be “Deleuzean,” as his friend Michel\nFoucault once quipped, Deleuze’s influence reaches beyond philosophy;\nhis work is approvingly cited by, and his concepts put to use by,\nresearchers in architecture, urban studies, geography, film studies,\nmusicology, anthropology, gender studies, literary studies and other\nfields.\n\n\n\nOne of the barriers to Deleuze’s being better read among mainstream\nphilosophers is the difficulty of his writing style in his original\nworks (as opposed to his historical works, which are often models of\nclarity and concision). Deleuze’s prose can be highly allusive, as\nwell as peppered with neologisms; to make matters even more complex,\nthese terminological innovations shift from one work to the\nother. While claims of intentional obscurantism are not warranted,\nDeleuze did mean for his style to keep readers on their toes, or even\nto “force” them to rethink their philosophical\nassumptions. (We will discuss this notion of being\n“forced” to think below in 3.1.) As befits an encyclopedia\nentry, we will concentrate on the conceptual architecture of his\nthought, though readers should be aware that, perhaps more than with\nmost philosophers, such a treatment of Deleuze’s work removes much of\nthe performative effect of reading the original.\n\n\n\nDeleuze was born in Paris to conservative, middle-class parents, who\nsent him to public schools for his elementary education; except for\none year of school in Normandy during the Occupation, he lived in the\nsame section of Paris his entire life. His personal life was\nunremarkable; he remained married to the same woman he wed at age 31,\nFanny (Denise Paul) Grandjouan, a French translator of D. H. Lawrence,\nand raised two children with her. He rarely traveled abroad, although\nhe did take a trip to the United States in 1975; for the most part he\nminimized his attendance at academic conferences and colloquia,\ninsisting that the activity of thought took place primarily in\nwriting, and not in dialogue and discussion. The most dramatic event\nin his life occurred early, when, during the Occupation, Deleuze’s\nolder brother was arrested by the Nazis for resistance activities and\ndeported; he died on the train to Auschwitz. \n\nWhen the Germans began their occupation of France in June 1940,\nDeleuze’s family was on vacation in Normandy, and he spent a year\nbeing schooled there. Deleuze traced his initiation into literature\nand philosophy to his encounter with a teacher at Deauville named\nPierre Halbwachs (son of the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs), who\nintroduced him to writers such as Gide and Baudelaire. Early on, he\nrecalled, philosophical concepts struck him with the same force as\nliterary characters, having their own autonomy and style. After the\nLiberation, Deleuze returned to Paris and undertook his\nkhâgne (an intensive year of preparatory studies) at\nthe well-known Lycée Henri IV, and then studied the history of\nphilosophy at the Sorbonne.  He was taught by Jean Hippolyte and\nFerdinand Alquié, whom he “loved and admired\nenormously,” as well as by Georges Canguilheim and Maurice de\nGandillac. Like many of his peers he was as influenced by the writings\nof Jean-Paul Sartre as he was by the work of his academic mentors. \n\nDeleuze’s historically oriented study at the Sorbonne led him to\ndevote his first book, Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953), to\nHume. In an era in which peers like Foucault and Derrida, students at\nthe Ecole Normale Supérieure, concentrated on “the three\n‘H’s” (Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger), Deleuze’s\ndecision to write on empiricism and Hume was already a provocation,\nearly evidence of the heterodox tendencies of his thought. From 1953\nto 1962—which he later referred to as “a hole in my\nlife”—Deleuze published little, moving among various\nteaching positions in Paris and the provinces. It was also during this\ntime that he contracted the recurring respiratory ailment that would\nplague him for the rest of his life. In 1962, Nietzsche and\nPhilosophywas published to considerable acclaim, cementing\nDeleuze’s reputation in academic circles. He followed this\ninitial success with Kant’s Critical Philosophy (1963);\nProust and Signs (1964); and Bergsonism (1966). In\n1968 he published Difference and Repetition as his primary\nthesis for the doctorat d’Etat, with Spinoza and\nthe Problem of Expression as the secondary thesis. The next year,\n1969, proved to be an important one for Deleuze. First, he found a\npermanent teaching position in Paris, at the experimental campus of\nthe University of Paris VIII in Vincennes (which later moved to its\ncurrent location in St. Denis); he gave weekly seminars at this\ninstitution until his retirement in 1987. Second, he published another\nmajor text in his own name, Logic of Sense. But most\nimportantly, it was then that he met Félix Guattari, a radical\npsychoanalyst and political militant, with whom he began a long\ncollaboration. Their first joint volume, Anti-Oedipus (1972),\nwas a best seller in France, a veritable succès de\nscandale, and thrust Deleuze into the limelight as a public\nintellectual. They followed this with Kafka: Toward a Minor\nLiterature (1975), and then a book which, at least in the eyes of\nsome, rivals Difference and Repetition for the title of\nDeleuze’s masterwork, A Thousand Plateaus (1980). \n\nThe 1980s were a decade of independent works for Deleuze: Francis\nBacon: Logic of Sensation (1981); Cinema I: The\nMovement-Image (1983); Cinema II: The Time-Image (1985);\nFoucault (1986); and The Fold: Leibniz and the\nBaroque (1988). He then resumed his collaboration with Guattari\nfor their final joint work, What is Philosophy? (1991). His\nfinal years were spent in very ill health, although he did manage to\npublish a remarkable short essay, “Immanence: A Life” in\n1995, before taking his own life on November 4, 1995. \n\nBefore he ever wrote “in his own name” in Difference\nand Repetition and Logic of Sense, Deleuze wrote a\nseries of works on figures in the history of philosophy (Hume,\nBergson, Nietzsche, Kant, and Spinoza). In writing these works,\nDeleuze sought to unearth the presuppositions he absorbed in his\neducation; chief among them, he felt, was a deep-seated privilege of\nidentity over difference. Deleuze thus set about trying to accelerate\nhowever he could a departure from Hegel, whom he saw as emblematic of\nthat privilege. Deleuze attacks Hegel and others in what we can\ncall—though Deleuze did not—the “identitarian”\ntradition first of all by means of a radicalized reading of Kant,\nwhose genius, as Deleuze explains in Kant’s Critical\nPhilosophy (1963), was to have conceived of a purely\nimmanent critique of reason—a critique that did not\nseek “errors” of reason produced by external causes, but\nrather “illusions” that arise from within reason itself by\nthe illegitimate (transcendent) uses of the syntheses of\nconsciousness. Deleuze characterized his own work as a philosophy of\nimmanence, arguing that Kant himself had failed to realize fully the\nambitions of his critique, for at least two reasons: first, the\nfailure to pursue a fully immanent critique, and second, the failure\nto propose a genetic account of real experience, resting content with\nthe account of the conditions of possible experience. \n\nFirst, Kant made the field of consciousness immanent to a\ntranscendental subject, thereby reintroducing an element of identity\nthat is transcendent (that is, external) to the field itself, and\nreserving all power of synthesis (that is, identity-formation) in the\nfield to the activity of the always already unified and transcendent\nsubject. (Deleuze was influenced in this regard by his reading of\nSartre’s 1937 essay “The Transcendence of the Ego.”)\nAlready in his Hume book, Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953),\nDeleuze had pointed to an empiricist reversal of Kant. Where Kant’s\nquestion had been “How can the given be given to a\nsubject?” Hume’s question had been “How is the subject\n(human nature) constituted within the given?” In his mature\nwork, Deleuze argues for an “impersonal and\npre-individual” transcendental field in which the subject as\nidentity pole which produces empirical identities by active synthesis\nis itself the result or product of differential passive\nsyntheses (for instance, in what Deleuze calls the syntheses of\nhabit, we find bodily, desiring, and unconscious\n“contractions” which unify a series of experiences,\nextracting that which it to be retained in the habit and allowing the\nrest to be “forgotten”). The passive syntheses responsible\nfor subject formation must be qualified as “differential,”\nfor three reasons. Each passive synthesis is serial, never singular\n(there is never one synthesis by itself, but always a series of\n“contractions,” that is to say, experience is ongoing and\nso our habits require constant “updating”); each series is\nrelated to other series in the same body (at the most basic level, for\ninstance, the series of taste contractions is related to those of\nsmell, sight, touch, hearing and proprioception); and each body is\nrelated to other bodies, which are themselves similarly differential\n(the series of syntheses of bodies can resonate or clash). Together\nthe passive syntheses at all these levels form a differential field\nwithin which subject formation takes place as an integration or\nresolution of that field; in other words, subjects are roughly\nspeaking the patterns of these multiple and serial syntheses which\nfold in on themselves producing a site of self-awareness. Of course,\nDeleuze never simply proclaims this as a bald thesis, but develops a\ngenetic account of subjectivity in many of his books. Taking all this\ninto account, Deleuze summarized his differential, immanent and\ngenetic position by the at first glance odd phrase of\n“transcendental empiricism.” This is cashed out in terms\nof two characteristics: (1) the abstract (e.g., “subject,”\n“object,” “State,” the “whole,”\nand so on) does not explain, but must itself be explained; and (2) the\naim of philosophy is not to rediscover the eternal or the universal,\nbut to find the singular conditions under which something new is\nproduced. In other words—and this is a pragmatic perspective\nfrom which Deleuze never deviated—philosophy aims not at stating\nthe conditions of knowledge qua representation, but at finding and\nfostering the conditions of creative production. \n\nDeleuze’s second criticism of Kant claims that he had simply presumed\nthe existence of knowledge and morality as “facts” and\nthen sought their conditions of possibility in the transcendental. But\nalready in 1789, Salomon Maimon, whose early critiques of Kant helped\ngenerate the post-Kantian tradition, had argued that Kant’s critical\nproject required a method of genesis—and not merely a method of\nconditioning—that would account for the production of knowledge,\nmorality, and indeed reason itself. In other words, Maimon called for\na genetic method that would be able to reach the conditions of real\nand not merely possible experience. Maimon found a solution to this\nproblem in a principle of difference: whereas identity is the\ncondition of possibility of thought in general, it is difference that\nconstitutes the genetic and productive principle of real\nthought. These two Maimonian exigencies—the search for the\ngenetic conditions of real experience and the positing of a\nprinciple of difference—appear in almost every one of\nDeleuze’s early monographs. Nietzsche and Philosophy (1962),\nfor instance, suggests that Nietzsche completed and inverted\nKantianism by bringing critique to bear, not simply on false claims to\nknowledge or morality, but on true knowledge and true morality, and\nindeed on truth itself: “genealogy” constituted\nNietzsche’s genetic method, and the will-to-power was his principle of\ndifference. Deleuze’s anti-Hegelianism is shown in his focus on the\nproductivity of the non-dialectical (“affirmative”)\ndifferential forces termed by Nietzsche “noble.” These\nforces affirm themselves, and thereby differentiate themselves first,\nand only secondarily consider that from which they have differentiated\nthemselves. \n\nIn Bergsonism (1966), Deleuze develops the ideas of\nvirtuality and multiplicity that will serve as the backbone of his\nlater work. From Maimon’s reading of Kant, we know that Deleuze needs\nto substitute the notion of the condition of the genesis of the real\nfor the notion of conditions of possibility of representational\nknowledge. The positive name for that genetic condition is the\nvirtual, which Deleuze adopts from the following Bergsonian\nargument. The notion of the possible, Bergson holds in Creative\nEvolution, is derived from a false problem that confuses the\n“more” with the “less” and ignores differences\nin kind; there is not less but more in the idea of the possible than\nin the real, just as there is more in the idea of nonbeing than in\nthat of being, or more in the idea of disorder than in that of\norder. When we think of the possible as somehow\n“pre-existing” the real, we think of the real, then we add\nto it the negation of its existence, and then we project the\n“image” of the possible into the past. We then reverse the\nprocedure and think of the real as something more than possible, that\nis, as the possible with existence added to it. We then say that the\npossible has been “realized” in the real. By contrast,\nDeleuze will reject the notion of the possible in favor of that of the\nvirtual. Rather than awaiting realization, the virtual is fully real;\nwhat happens in genesis is that the virtual is actualized. \n\nThe fundamental characteristic of the virtual, that which means it\nmust be actualized rather than realized, is its differential makeup.\nDeleuze always held the critical axiom that the ground cannot resemble\nthat which it grounds; he constantly critiques the\n“tracing” operation by which identities in real experience\nare said to be conditioned by identities in the transcendental. For\ninstance, Deleuze criticizes Kant for copying the transcendental field\nin the image of the empirical field. That is, empirical experience is\npersonal, identitarian and centripetal; there is a central focus, the\nsubject, in which all our experiences are tagged as belonging to\nus. Kant says this empirical identity is only possible if we can posit\nthe Transcendental Unity of Apperception, that is, the possibility of\nadding “I think” to all our judgments. Instead of this\nsmuggled-in or “traced” identity, Deleuze will want to\nhave the transcendental field be differential. Deleuze still wants to\nwork back from experience, but since the condition cannot resemble the\nconditioned, and since the empirical is personal and individuated, the\ntranscendental must be impersonal and pre-individual. The virtual is\nthe condition for real experience, but it has no identity; identities\nof the subject and the object are products of processes that resolve,\nintegrate, or actualize (the three terms are synonymous for Deleuze) a\ndifferential field. The Deleuzean virtual is thus not the condition of\npossibility of any rational experience, but the condition of genesis\nof real experience. \n\nAs we have seen, the virtual, as genetic ground of the actual, cannot\nresemble that which it grounds; thus, if we are confronted with actual\nidentities in experience, then the virtual ground of those identities\nmust be purely differential. Deleuze adopts “multiplicity”\nfrom Bergson as the name for such a purely differential field. In this\nusage, Deleuze later clarifies, “multiplicity” designates\nthe multiple as a substantive, rather than as a predicate. The\nmultiple as predicate generates a set of philosophical problems under\nthe rubric of “the one and the many” (a thing is one or\nmultiple, one and multiple, and so on). With multiplicity, or the\nmultiple as substantive, the question of the relation between the\npredicates one/multiple is replaced by the question of distinguishing\ntypes of multiplicities (as with Bergson’s distinction of qualitative\nand quantitative multiplicities in Time and Free Will). A\ntypological difference between substantive multiplicities, in short,\nis substituted for the dialectical opposition of the one and the\nmultiple. \n\nIn sum, then, against the “major” post-Kantian tradition\nof Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, Deleuze in effect posited his own\n“minor” post-Kantian trio of Maimon, Nietzsche, and\nBergson. To these he added a trio of pre-Kantians, Spinoza, Leibniz\nand Hume, but read through a post-Kantian lens. We have already\ntouched on Deleuze’s reading of Hume. Let us now turn to Spinoza, for\nwhom Deleuze’s admiration was seemingly limitless; for Deleuze,\nSpinoza was the “prince” or even the “Christ”\nof philosophers. There are many Spinozist inheritances in Deleuze, but\none of the most important is certainly the notion of univocity in\nontology. Univocity—as opposed to its great rivals, equivocity\nand analogy—is the key to developing a “philosophy of\ndifference” (Deleuze’s term for his project in Difference\nand Repetition), in which difference would no longer be\nsubordinated to identity. The result is a Spinozism minus substance, a\npurely modal or differential universe. In univocity, as Deleuze reads\nSpinoza, the single sense of Being frees a charge of difference\nthroughout all that is. In univocal ontology being is said in a single\nsense of all of which it is said, but it is said of difference\nitself. What is that difference? Difference is difference in degrees\nof “power”; in interpreting this term we must distinguish\nthe two French words puissance and pouvoir. In\nsocial terms, puissance is immanent power, power to act\nrather than power to dominate another; we could say that\npuissance is praxis (in which equals clash or act\ntogether) rather than poiesis (in which others are matter to\nbe formed by the command of a superior, a sense of transcendent power\nthat matches what pouvoir indicates for Deleuze). In the most\ngeneral terms Deleuze develops throughout his career,\npuissance is the ability to affect and to be affected, to\nform assemblages or consistencies, that is, to form emergent unities\nthat nonetheless respect the heterogeneity of their components. (Here\nwe see the empiricist theme of the “externality of\nrelations”: in an assemblage or consistency, the\n“becoming” or relation of the terms attains its own\nindependent ontological status. In Deleuze’s favorite example, the\nwasp and orchid create a “becoming” or symbiotic emergent\nunit.) \n\nAlthough Deleuze wrote a touching and certainly important book in\ntribute to his friend Foucault after the latter’s death in 1984, the\nfinal important figure in Deleuze’s readings of other philosophers is\nLeibniz, to whom, it must be recalled, Maimon appealed in his\ncriticism of Kant. In 1988, Deleuze published a book on Leibniz\nentitled The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque, which added new\nelements to the reading of Leibniz that appeared in Deleuze’s earlier\nbooks: an interpretation centered on the concept of the fold, a\ndevelopment of a concept of the Baroque, and a attempt to define a\nneo-Leibnizianism in terms of contemporary artistic and scientific\npractices. While The Fold is a fascinating work, we will\nconcentrate here on Deleuze’s early reading of Leibniz, which plays an\nimportant role in Difference and Repetition. \n\nDeleuze pushes Leibniz’s thought to a point where Leibniz could never\nhave taken it, given his theological presuppositions. This is the\npoint where one begins to consider the virtual domain on its own\naccount, freed from its actualization in a world and its individuals.\nOn this score, Deleuze often likes to cite Jorge Luis Borges’s famous\nstory, “The Garden of the Forking Paths,” in which such a\nvirtual world is described in the labyrinthine book of a Chinese\nphilosopher named Ts’ui Pên: “In all fiction, when a man\nis faced with alternatives, he chooses one at the expense of\nothers. In the almost unfathomable Ts’ui Pên, he\nchooses—simultaneously—all of them… In Ts’ui\nPên’s work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the\npoint of departure for other bifurcations.” Leibniz had in fact\ngiven a similar presentation of the world at the conclusion of the\nTheodicy. In Deleuze’s transformation of the Leibnizian /\nBorgesian image, the three Kantian transcendent Ideas of God, World,\nand Self all take on a completely different demeanor. First, God is no\nlonger a Being who compares and chooses the richest compossible world;\nhe has now become a pure Process that affirms incompossibilities and\npasses through them. (As the notion of “process” here\nattests, Deleuze’s relation to Whitehead is one of the most important\ncontemporary issues for students of his thought; although the points\nof comparison are many, Deleuze himself rarely discussed Whitehead,\nsave for several important pages in The Fold.) Second, the\nworld is no longer a continuous world defined by its pre-established\nharmony; instead, divergences, bifurcations, and incompossibles must\nnow be seen to belong to one and the same universe, a chaotic universe\nin which divergent series trace endlessly bifurcating paths, and give\nrise to violent discords and dissonances that are never resolved into\na harmonic tonality: a “chaosmos,” as Deleuze puts it\n(borrowing a word from Joyce) and no longer a world. In contrast,\nLeibniz could only save the “harmony” of this world by\nrelegating discordances and disharmonies to other possible\nworlds—this was his theological sleight of hand.  Third, selves\nor individuals, rather than being closed upon the compossible and\nconvergent world they express from within, are now torn open, and kept\nopen through the divergent series and incompossible ensembles that\ncontinually pull them outside themselves. The “monadic”\nsubject, as Deleuze puts it, becomes the “nomadic”\nsubject. In other words, if Deleuze is Leibnizian, it is only by\neliminating the idea of a God who chooses the best of all possible\nworlds, with its pre-established harmony and well-established selves;\nin Deleuze, incompossibilities and dissonances belong to one and the\nsame world, the only world, our world. But they belong to our world as\nits virtual register; developing the thought of the virtual is one of\nthe great challenges of Deleuze’s masterpiece, Difference and\nRepetition, to which we now turn. \n\nDeleuze’s historical monographs were, in a sense, preliminary sketches\nfor the great canvas of Difference and Repetition (1968),\nwhich marshaled these resources from the history of philosophy in an\nambitious project to construct a “philosophy of\ndifference.” Following Maimon’s critique, Difference and\nRepetition produces a two-fold shift from the Kantian project of\nproviding the universal and necessary conditions for possible\nexperience. First, rather than seeking the conditions\nfor possible experience, Deleuze wants to provide an account\nof the genesis of real experience, that is, the experience of\nthis concretely existing individual here and now. Second, to respect\nthe demands of the philosophy of difference, the genetic principle\nmust itself be a differential principle.  \n\nHowever, despite these departures, Deleuze maintains a crucial\nalignment with Kant; Difference and Repetition is still a\ntranscendental approach. Here we should remind ourselves that the\nterms “transcendent” and “transcendental” have\nopposing significations. Transcendental philosophy in fact critiques\nthe pretensions of other philosophies to transcend experience by\nproviding strict criteria for the use of syntheses immanent to\nexperience. On this score, at least, Deleuze aligns himself with\nKant’s critical philosophy. \n\nThree further preliminary notes are in order here. First, as we will\ndiscuss in section 4 below, the Capitalism and Schizophrenia\nproject of Deleuze and Guattari will bring to the fore naturalist\ntendencies that are only implicitly present in the still-Kantian\nframework of Difference and Repetition. So, although there is\nsome risk of reading backwards in this formulation, we can say that\nthe “of” in the phrase “the experience of this\nconcretely existing individual here and now” is both subjective\nand objective. It is the experience by human subjects of this\nindividual object in front of it, and it is the experience enjoyed by\nthe concretely existing individual itself, even when that individual\nis non-human or even non-living. (Deleuze’s panpsychism is treated\nbriefly in Protevi 2011.) Second, then, in the demand for genetic\nprinciples to account for the real experience of concrete individuals,\nDeleuze is working in the tradition of the Principle of Sufficient\nReason. Third, the notion of “genesis” is itself double;\nin Chapter 3, Deleuze lays out a dynamic genesis that moves from an\nencounter with intensity in sensation to the thinking of virtual\nIdeas, while Chapters 4 and 5 lay out a static genesis that moves from\nthe virtual Idea through an intensive individuation process to an\nactual entity.  \n\nWe are now ready to discuss the book itself. Murphy 1992 suggests that\nthe first part of the book (the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2)\nconstitutes Deleuze’s treatment of the history of philosophy, while in\nthe second part of the book (Chapters 4 and 5) Deleuze is doing\nphilosophy in his own name. From this point of view, Chapter 3, on the\n“image of thought,” plays a pivotal role, leading us into\nDeleuze’s own philosophy. This transitional role of Chapter 3 is\nconfirmed elsewhere when Deleuze says that the study of the image of\nthought is the “prolegomena to philosophy”\n(Negotiations, 149). \n\nIn Chapters 1 and 2, to find a differential genetic principle, Deleuze\nworks through the history of philosophy to isolate the concepts of\n“difference in itself” and “repetition for\nitself” that the assumptions of previous philosophies had\nprevented from being formulated. “Difference in itself” is\ndifference that is freed from identities seen as metaphysically\nprimary. Normally, difference is conceived of as an empirical relation\nbetween two terms which each has a prior identity of its own (“x\nis different from y”). Deleuze inverts this priority: identity\npersists, but is now a something produced by a prior relation between\ndifferentials (dx rather than not-x). Difference is no longer\nan empirical relation but becomes a transcendental principle that\nconstitutes the sufficient reason of empirical diversity (for example,\nit is the difference of electrical potential between cloud and ground\nthat constitutes the sufficient reason of the phenomenon of\nlightning). \n\nIn Chapter 2, the concept of “repetition for itself” is\nproduced as repetition that is freed from being repetition of an\noriginal self-identical thing so that it can be the repetition of\ndifference. Following the formula of Deleuze’s reading of Nietzsche’s\neternal return, repetition is the return of the differential genetic\ncondition of real experience each time there is an indviduation of a\nconcrete entity. Ultimately, then, Difference and Repetition\nwill show that the individuation of entities is produced by the\nactualization, integration, or resolution (the terms are synonymous\nfor Deleuze) of a differentiated virtual field of Ideas or\n“multiplicities” that are themselves changed, via\n“counter-effectuation,” in each individuating event. \n\nChapter 3 lays out 8 postulates of the “dogmatic image of\nthought.” Between the first four and last four postulates we\nfind a theory of the faculties, which is thus at the crossroads of\nboth the chapter and the book. \n\nLet us take up the first four postulates. The first postulate concerns\nour supposed natural disposition to think; the denial of this is what\nnecessitates our being forced to think. The second and third\npostulates concern subjective and objective unity. Subjective unity is\ncaptured by the notion of “common sense” such that our\nfaculties of sensation, memory, imagination, and thought work in\nharmony, while objective unity is captured by the notion of\n“recognition” such that it is the same object that is\nsensed, remembered, imagined, and thought. The fourth postulate\nconcerns “representation”, a key target of Deleuze’s\ncritique. Here difference is submitted to a fourfold structure that\nrenders difference subordinate to identity: 1) identity in the\nconcept; 2) opposition of predicates; 3) analogy in judgment; and 4)\nresemblance in perception. A good way to approach Deleuze’s notion of\nrepresentation is via Aristotle and Porphyry. Specific differences are\nthe opposed predicates that function on a horizon of identity in the\nconcept under division; thus animal is the genus that is divided into\nrational and irrational as specific differences that enable the\nisolation of the species “human.” Then, we find that the\ndifference between individuals of the same species is infra-conceptual\nand can only be made via the perception of resemblances; Theaetetus\nlooks like Socrates but not so much that they cannot be\ndistinguished. Finally, the relation of substance to the other\ncategories is analogical, such that being is said in many ways, but\nwith substance as the primary way in which it is said. \n\nAfter the first four postulates, we find the theory of the faculties,\nwhich will be Deleuze’s account of what it means to be\n“forced” to think in differential rather than identitarian\nterms. To free a notion of “difference in itself” such\nthat difference need not be thought on the basis of a prior horizon of\nidentity, Deleuze looks for an “encounter,” a sensation\nthat cannot be thought, that cannot find the empirical category under\nwhich an object can be recognized, and thus forces the\n“transcendent exercise” of the faculty of sensibility,\nwhen something can only be sensed. \n\nHere we see the dynamic genesis from intensity in sensation to the\nthinking of virtual Ideas. Each step here has a distinct Kantian\necho. The faculties are linked in order; here Deleuze as well as Kant\nlooks to the privilege of sensibility as the origin of\nknowledge—the “truth of empiricism.” With\nsensibility, pure difference in intensity is grasped immediately in\nthe encounter as the sentiendum, that which can only be\nsensed. In the differential theory of the faculties, sensibility,\nimagination, memory, and thought all “communicate a\nviolence” from one to the other—here Deleuze works with\nthe Kantian notion of the sublime as discordant accord of the\nfaculties. The “free form of difference” in intensity\nmoves each faculty and communicates its violence to the next, though\nin this case there is no supernatural vocation that will redeem the\nconflict of imagination and reason, as there is in the resolution to\nthe discussion of the sublime in the Critique of\nJudgment. Rather than a reconciliation of the faculties, with\nthought, a “fractured self”—here Deleuze takes up\nKant’s notion of the split between the empirical ego and the\nTranscendental subject—is constrained to think “difference\nin itself” in Ideas. \n\nWe won’t discuss the last four postulates in detail, as they concern\nthe theory of Ideas, the topic of Chapter 4, which we will shortly\ndiscuss. For now, let us note that two of Deleuze’s technical terms,\nintensity and virtuality, occupy two different places on this line of\ndynamic genesis. Intensity is the characteristic of the encounter, and\nsets off the process of thinking, while virtuality is the\ncharacteristic of the Idea. \n\nWith the notions of intensive and extensive we come upon a crucial\ndistinction for Deleuze that is explored in Chapters 4 and 5\nof Difference and Repetition. Extensive differences, such as\nlength, area or volume, are intrinsically divisible. A volume of\nmatter divided into two equal halves produces two volumes, each having\nhalf the extent of the original one. Intensive differences, by\ncontrast, refer to properties such as temperature or pressure that\ncannot be so divided. If a volume of water whose temperature is\n90º is divided in half, the result is two volumes at the original\ntemperature, not two volumes at 45º. However, the important\nproperty of intensity is not that it is indivisible, but that it is a\nproperty that cannot be divided without involving a change in\nkind. The temperature of a volume of water, for instance, can be\n“divided” by heating the container from below, causing a\ntemperature difference between the top and the bottom. In so doing,\nhowever, we change the system qualitatively; moreover, if the\ntemperature differences reach a certain threshold (if they attain a\ncertain “intensity” in Deleuze’s terms), the system will\nundergo a “phase transition,” losing symmetry and changing\nits dynamics, entering into a periodic pattern of\nmotion—convection—which displays extensive properties of\nsize: X centimeters of length and breadth. Drawing on these kinds of\nanalyses, Deleuze will assign a transcendental status to the\nintensive: intensity, he argues, constitutes the genetic condition of\nextensive space. Intensive processes are themselves in turn structured\nby Ideas or multiplicities. \n\nAn Idea or multiplicity is really a process of progressive\ndetermination of differential elements, differential relations, and\nsingularities. Let us take these step-by-step. “Elements”\nmust have no independent existence from the system in which they\ninhere; phonemes as the elements of the virtual linguistic Idea are an\nexample Deleuze uses in Difference and Repetition. When\nphonemes are actualized they enter into differential relations that\ndetermine the patterns of individual languages; thus the English\nphoneme /p/ is reciprocally determined by its differences from /t/,\n/b/, /d/, and so on. Finally, these differential relations of an\nindividual language determine singularities or remarkable points at\nwhich the pattern of that language can shift: the Great Vowel Shift of\nMiddle English being an example, or more prosaically, dialect\npronunciation shifts. \n\nFor another example—and here, in the applicability of his schema\nto widely divergent registers, is one of the aspects of Deleuze as\nmetaphysician—let us try to construct the Idea of\nhurricanes. The differential elements would be material\n“flows” driven by intensive differences in temperature and\npressure but undetermined in form (neither smooth nor turbulent,\nneither big nor small) and function (neither forming nor destroying of\nweather events). These flows qua differential elements enter into\nrelations of reciprocal determination linking changes in any one\nelement to changes in the others; thus temperature and pressure\ndifferences will link changes in air and water currents to each other:\nupdrafts are related to downdrafts even if the exact relations (the\ntightness of the links, the velocity of the flows) are not yet\ndetermined. Finally, at singular points in these relations\nsingularities are determined that mark qualitative shifts in the\nsystem, such as the formation of thunderstorm cells, the eye wall, and\nso on. But this is still the virtual Idea of hurricanes; real existent\nhurricanes will have measurable values of these variables so that we\ncan move from the philosophical realm of sufficient reason to that of\nscientific causation. A hurricane is explained by its Idea, but it is\ncaused by real wind currents driven by real temperature supplied by\nthe sun to tropical waters. \n\nTo see how Ideas are transcendental and immanent, we have to\nappreciate that an Idea is a concrete universal. In an early article\non Bergson (“The Conception of Difference in Bergson”\n[1956]), Deleuze gave a particularly helpful example of this\nnotion. In La Pensée et le Mouvant, Bergson had shown\nthat there are two ways of determining what the spectrum of\n“colors” have in common. (1) You can extract from\nparticular colors an abstract and general idea of color (“by\nremoving from the red that which makes it red, from the blue what\nmakes it blue, from the green what makes it green”). Or, (2) you\ncan make all these colors “pass through a convergent lens,\nbringing them to a single point,” in which case a “pure\nwhite light” is obtained that “makes the differences\nbetween the shades stand out.” The former case defines a single\ngeneric “concept” with a plurality of objects; the\nrelation between concept and object is one of subsumption; and the\nstate of difference remains exterior to the thing. The second case, on\nthe contrary, defines a differential Idea in the Deleuzean sense: the\ndifferent colors are no longer objects under a concept, but constitute\nan order of mixture in coexistence and succession within the Idea; the\nrelation between the Idea and a given color is not one of subsumption,\nbut one of actualization and differenciation; and the state of\ndifference between the concept and the object is internalized in the\nIdea itself, so that the concept itself has become the object. White\nlight is still a universal, but it is a concrete universal, and not a\ngenus or generality. \n\nThe Idea of color is thus like white light, which\n“perplexes” within itself the genetic elements and\nrelations of all the colors, but which is actualized in the diverse\ncolors and their respective spaces. (Like the word\n“problem,” Deleuze uses the word “perplexion”\nto signify, not a coefficient of doubt, hesitation, or astonishment,\nbut the multiple and virtual state of Ideas. Indeed, Deleuze adopts a\nnumber of neoplatonic notions to indicate the structure of Ideas, all\nof which are derived from the root word pli [fold]:\nperplication, complication, implication, explication, and\nreplication.) Similarly, the Idea of sound could be conceived of as a\nwhite noise, just as there is also a white society or a white\nlanguage, which contains in its virtuality all the phonemes and\nrelations destined to be actualized in the diverse languages and in\nthe remarkable parts of a same language. \n\nWe can now move to discuss Chapter 5, on the individuation of\nconcretely existing real entities as the actualization of a virtual\nIdea. In isolating the conditions of genesis, Deleuze sets up a\ntripartite ontological scheme, positing three interdependent\nregisters: the virtual, intensive, and actual. Deleuze’s basic notion\nis that in all realms of being intensive morphogenetic processes\nfollow differential virtual multiplicities to produce localized and\nindividuated actual substances with extensive properties. Simply put,\nthe actualization of the virtual proceeds by way of intensive\nprocesses. Beneath the actual (any one state of a system), we find\n“impersonal individuations” or intensive morphogenetic\nprocesses that produce system states and beneath these we find\n“pre-individual singularities” (that is, the key elements\nin virtual fields, marking system thresholds that structure the\nintensive morphogenetic processes). We thus have to distinguish the\nintense “impersonal” field of individuation and its\nprocesses from the virtual “pre-individual” field of\ndifferential relations and singularities that make up an Idea or\nmultiplicity. \n\nTying together the themes of difference, multiplicity, virtuality and\nintensity, at the heart of Difference and Repetition we find\na theory of Ideas (dialectics) based neither on an essential model of\nidentity (Plato), nor a regulative model of unity (Kant), nor a\ndialectical model of contradiction (Hegel), but rather on a\nproblematic and genetic model of difference. Ideas define the being of\na thing, but one cannot attain an Idea through the Socratic question\n“What is … ?” (which posits Ideas as transcendent\nand eternal), but rather through “minor” questions such as\n“Which one?” “Where?” “When?”\n“How?” “How many?” “In which\ncase?” “From which viewpoint?”—all of which\nallow one to define the differential Ideas immanent in the intensive\nprocesses they structure. \n\nFrom these examples we can see that Ideas structure the intensive\nprocesses that give rise to the behavior patterns of systems, and\ntheir singularities mark the thresholds at which systems change\nbehavior patterns. In a word, the virtual Idea is the transformation\nmatrix for material systems or bodies. Bodies are determined\n“solutions” to the “problem” that lays out the\nmanifold options for incarnating bodies of that nature. Ideas then\nrespond to the question “who?” (who is it that incarnates\nthe Idea in this case?) rather than the essentialist “what\nis?” (what are the properties of the substance that provide the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the class of\nwhich the object is a member?)  \n\nFor orientation purposes, it’s useful to consider Gilbert Simondon’s\ntheory of individuation as a very simple model for what Deleuze calls\n“actualization.” For Simondon, crystallization is a\nparadigm of individuation: a supersaturated solution is metastable;\nfrom that pre-individuated field, replete with gradients of density\nthat are only implicit “forms” or “potential\nfunctions,” individual crystals precipitate out. The crucial\ndifference is that crystals form in homogenous solutions, while the\nDeleuzean virtual is composed of “Ideas” or\n“multiplicities” involving differential relations among\nheterogeneous components, whose rates of change are connected with\neach other. For an example of such heterogeneity, let us return to\nhurricane formation, the Idea of which we sketched above. Here it\nshould be intuitively clear that there is no central command, but a\nself-organization of multiple processes of air and water movement\npropelled by temperature and pressure differences. All hurricanes form\nwhen intensive processes of wind and ocean currents reach singular\npoints. These singular points, however, are not unique to any one\nhurricane, but are virtual for each actual hurricane, just as the\nboiling point of water is virtual for each actual pot of tea on the\nstove. In other words, all hurricanes share the same virtual structure\neven as they are singular individuations or actualizations of that\nstructure. \n\nIn this treatment, we have concentrated on only some of the\nmetaphysics in Difference and Repetition; much more could be\nsaid about the role that Nietzsche’s thought of the eternal return\nplays therein, in addition to Deleuze’s remarks on a dizzying array of\nfigures from Plato and Scotus to Freud and Artaud. In the interests of\nspace, however, let us move to a brief treatment of Deleuze’s second\nmajor work of the late 1960s, Logic of Sense. \n\nWhile Difference and Repetition ranges over a wide field of\nphilosophical topics, Logic of Sense focuses on two aspects\nof a single issue, the structure and genesis of sense. The genius of\nFrege and Russell was to have discovered that the condition of truth\n(denotation) lies in the domain of sense. In order for a proposition\nto be true (or false) it must have a sense; a nonsensical proposition\ncan be neither true nor false. Yet they betrayed this insight, Deleuze\nargues, because they—like Kant before them—remained\ncontent with establishing the condition of truth rather than its\ngenesis. In Logic of Sense, Deleuze attacks this problem,\nfirst developing the paradoxes that result from the structure of sense\nand then sketching a theory of its genesis. He does this using\nresources from analytic philosophy and the Stoics in the course of a\nreading of Lewis Carroll—a typically innovative, if not quirky,\nset of Deleuzean references. \n\nIn the first part of the book, Deleuze analyzes the structure of\nsense. He begins by identifying three types of relation within\npropositions: \n\nPropositions, in other words, can be related either to the objects to\nwhich they refer, or to the subjects who utter them, or to other\npropositions. But each of these relations, in turn, can be taken to be\nprimary. (1) In the domain of speech, it is the “I” that\nbegins: manifestation not only makes denotation possible (Hume), but\nis also prior to signification (Descartes’ cogito). (2) In\nthe domain of language, however, it is signification that is primary,\nsince one is always born into a preexisting language, and signified\nconcepts are always primary in relation to the self as a manifested\nperson or to things as designated objects. (3) Yet in the domain of\nlogic we see the primacy of designation: as shown by the hypothetical\nmode of implications, the logical value of demonstration is not the\ntruth, but rather the conditions of truth (the conditions of\npossibility under which the proposition would be true); the premises\nmust thus be posited as effectively true, which forces one to leave\nthe pure order of implication in order to relate the premises to a\ndenoted state of affairs. Logical designation, in other words, cannot\nfulfill its putative role as foundation, since it presupposes an\nirreducible denotation. \n\nThe theory of the proposition is thus caught in a circle, with each\ncondition in turn being conditioned by what it supposedly conditions.\n“For the condition of truth to avoid this defect,” Deleuze\nargues, “it would have to have something unconditioned capable\nof assuring a real genesis of designation and the other dimensions of\nthe proposition: the condition of truth would then be defined, no\nlonger as the form of conceptual possibility, but as an ideal matter\nor ‘medium’ [matière ou ‘couche’\nidéelle], that is, no longer as signification, but as\nsense” (LS 19). Sense, then, would be a fourth dimension of\npropositions, for which Deleuze reserves the term expression. For\nDeleuze as for Frege, sense is what is expressed in a proposition; the\ntwo senses of “morning star” and “evening\nstar” are two ways in which the same denotatum may be\nexpressed in propositions. \n\nDeleuze’s contribution to the philosophy of sense really begins to\ntake off when he shows that the attempt to make this fourth dimension\nevident is akin to Lewis Carroll’s Hunt for the Snark, or to\nunraveling a Möbius strip, since sense has neither a physical nor\na mental existence. Deleuze suggests that it was the Stoics who first\ndiscovered the dimension of sense when they distinguished between\ncorporeal mixtures and incorporeal events. I can attribute the proper\nname “Battle of Waterloo” to a particular state of\naffairs, but the battle itself is an incorporeal event (or sense) with\nno other reality than that of the expression of my proposition; what\nwe find in the state of affairs are bodies mixing with one\nanother—spears stabbing flesh, bullets flying through the air,\ncannons firing, bodies being ripped apart—and the battle itself\nis the effect or the result of this intermingling of\nbodies. Sense thus has a complex status. On the one hand, it does not\nexist outside the proposition that expresses it, but it cannot be\nconfused with the proposition, since it has a distinct\n“objectity” of its own (it does not exist, but rather\n“subsists” or “insists”). On the other hand,\nit is attributed to states of affairs or things, but it cannot be\nconfused or identified with state of affairs, nor with a quality or\nrelation of these states. “Sense is both the expressible or the\nexpressed of the proposition, and the attribute of the state of\naffairs. It turns one side toward things, and another side toward\npropositions. But it cannot be confused with the proposition which\nexpressed it any more than with the state of affairs or the quality\nwhich the proposition denotes. It is exactly the boundary between\npropositions and things” (LS 22). \n\nThe structure of sense generates a number of paradoxes, which Deleuze\ndistinguishes from the paradoxes of signification discovered by\nRussell in set theory (the set of all sets, and the “barber of\nthe regiment”). The first is the paradox of regress, or\nindefinite proliferation: I can never state the sense of what I am\nsaying, but I can take the sense of what I am saying as the object of\nanother proposition, whose sense in turn I cannot state, ad\ninfinitum. This first paradox points both to the impotence of the\nspeaker (my inability to state the sense of what I am saying) and to\nthe highest power of language (its infinite capability to speak about\nwords). The second paradox is that of sterile reiteration or doubling:\none can avoid the infinite regress by extracting sense as the mere\ndouble of a proposition, but at the price of catapulting us into a\nthird paradox of neutrality or sterility—sense is necessarily\nneutral with regard to the various modes of the proposition: quality\n(affirmation, negation), quantity (all, some, none), relation, and\nmodality (possibility, reality, necessity). \n\nThus extracted from the proposition, Deleuze argues that sense has the\nstatus of a pure ideational event, irreducible to\npropositions and their three dimensions: (1) the states of affairs the\npropositions denote; (2) the experiences or mental activities\n(beliefs, desires, images, representations) of persons who express\nthemselves in the proposition; and (3) universals or general concepts.\nBut how can sense be said to engender the other dimension of the\nproposition? This is the second task of a logic of sense: “to\ncombine the sterility of sense in relation to the proposition from\nwhich it was extracted with its power of genesis in relation to the\ndimensions of the proposition” (LS 32). \n\nIn the second half of Logic of Sense, Deleuze analyzes what\nhe calls the dynamic genesis of language, drawing in part from texts\nin developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. “What renders\nlanguage possible,” he writes, “is that which separates\nsounds from bodies and organizes them into propositions, freeing them\nfor the expressive function” (LS 181). Deleuze distinguishes\nthree stages in the dynamic genesis, which at the same time constitute\nthree dimensions of language: (1) the primary order is the noise\nproduced in the depths of the body; (2) the secondary organization\nconstitutes the surface of sense (and non-sense); and (3) the tertiary\narrangement [ordonnance] is found in fully-formed\npropositions, with their functions of denotation, manifestation, and\nsignification. \n\nThe first stage of the dynamic genesis of sense, the primary order of\nlanguage, is found in the newborn infant. Deleuze draws from a\ntradition of developmental psychology whose insights are expressed in\nthe vivid image of Daniel N. Stern: the infant’s experience is a kind\nof human “weatherscape,” made up entirely of sequences of\nrisings and fallings of intensity—the jolting of a bright light\nor a sharp noise, the calming of a voice, or the explosive breakout of\na storm of hunger (The Interpersonal World of the Infant,\n1985). Deleuze will draw upon the writings of the French writer\nAntonin Artaud and call this life of intensities-in-motion the\n“body without organs.” This primary order of language\n(pure Noise as a dimension of the body) constitutes a first type of\nnonsense. But in the midst of this world of intensities, there also\nappears a particular noise: the sound of the child’s parents, or other\nadults. Long before the infant can understand words and sentences, it\ngrasps language as something that pre-exists itself, as something\nalways-already there, like a Voice on high. But for the child the\nVoice has the dimensions of language without having its\ncondition. (Adults have the same experience when they hear a foreign\nlanguage being spoken.) For the infant to accede to the tertiary\narrangement of language (denotation, manifestation, signification), it\nmust pass through its secondary organization, which is the production\nof the surface dimension of sense. How does this construction take\nplace? From the flow of the Voice, the child will extract differential\nelements of various orders (phonemes, morphemes, semantemes) and begin\nto synthesize them into diverse series. \n\nAt this point, Deleuze isolates three series or syntheses: connective,\nconjunctive, and disjunctive. In the first, the child connects\nphonemes in a concatenation of successive entities\n(“mama,” “dada”); in the second, there is the\nconstruction of esoteric words out of these phonemes through their\nintegration and conjunction (“your royal highness” is\ncontracted into “y’reince”); in the third, the child\nstarts making these esoteric words ramify and enter into relation with\nother divergent and independent series. We can clearly see that the\nconstructions of this secondary organization of sense are not yet the\nfully formed units of the tertiary arrangement of language on high,\nbut they are no longer merely the bodily noises of the primary order.\nBefore the child has any understanding of linguistic units, it\nundertakes a vast apprenticeship in their formative elements. This is\nwhy the domain of sense is the condition or ground of propositions,\nnot as their form of possibility, but as their “ideal matter or\n‘medium’”: we are positioned immediately within\nsense whenever we denote, manifest, or signify. Moreover, since sense\nlies at the frontier of words and things—it is expressed in\npropositions and attributed to states of affairs, but it cannot be\nconfused with either propositions or states of affairs—it\nengenders both the determinate dimensions of the proposition\n(denotation, manifestation, signification) as well as its objective\ncorrelates (the denoted, the manifested, and the signified). \n\nThe domain of sense is necessarily subject to a fundamental fragility,\ncapable of toppling over into nonsense: the ground gives way to a\ngroundlessness, a sans-fond. The reason for this is\nclear. Sense is never a principle or an origin; rather, it is an\neffect, it is produced, and it is produced out of elements that do\nnot, in themselves, have a sense. Sense, in other words, has a\ndeterminate relation with nonsense. Deleuze, however, distinguishes\nbetween two very different types of nonsense. The first is that of\nLewis Carroll, who remains at the surface of sense and, like children,\nmakes use of the non-signifying elements of language in order to\nconstruct the portmanteau words (snark = shark + snake; frumious =\nfurious + fuming) and nonsensical phrases (“’Twas brillig, and\nthe slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe”) that populate\nhis writing. If Logic of Sense is in part a reading of\nCarroll’s work, it is because no one knew better than Carroll about\nthe conditions for the production of sense, which Deleuze elucidates\nin detail: the extraction of differential elements or pure event,\ntheir organization in multiple series, and most importantly, the\naleatory point or paradoxical element that links the series (the ideal\n“quasi-cause” that produces the effect of sense out of\nnonsense). \n\nBut there is a second type of nonsense, which is more profound than\nthe surface nonsense found in Lewis Carroll. This is the terrifying\nnonsense of the primary order, which found expression in the writings\nof Antonin Artaud. Sense is what prevents the sonorous language from\nbeing confused with the physical body (noise). But in the primary\norder of schizophrenia experienced by Artaud, there is no longer\nanything to prevent propositions from falling back onto bodies, which\nmingle their sonorous elements with the olfactory, gustatory, and\ndigestive effects of the body (Artaud’s cris-souffles:\n“ratara ratara ratara Atara tatara rana Otara otara\nkatara”). \n\nDeleuze will develop his theory of the body-without-organs in his\ncollaboration with Félix Guattari, to which we now turn. As we\nshall see, the concept of the body-without-organs is put to work in a\ncomplex naturalistic philosophy of “desiring-production”\nthat moves far beyond the question of sense into the realms of nature,\nhistory, and politics. In other words, if Logic of Sense\nrepresents Deleuze’s confrontation with the “linguistic\nturn” that was so important for twentieth-century philosophy, it\nis a confrontation that he quickly put behind him as he came to\nembrace fully his materialist and naturalistic leanings. \n\nFollowing his work in the philosophy of difference, Deleuze meets\nGuattari in the aftermath of May 1968. These famous\n“events,” which have marked French culture and politics\never since, brought together students and workers, to the befuddlement\nof the established guardians of the revolution, the French Communist\nParty. Days of general strikes and standoffs with the police led the\nFrench President Charles de Gaulle to call a general election. De\nGaulle’s call for a parliamentary solution to the crisis was backed by\nthe Communists, who were evidently as scared of any revolution from\nbelow—which by definition would lack the party discipline they\nso craved—as were the official holders of State power, to whose\nposition they aspired. The worker-student movement eventually\ncollapsed, leaving memories of non-scripted social interactions and\nrevealing the investments of the Party, lampooned thereafter as\n“bureaucrats of the revolution,” in Foucault’s words in\nhis Preface to the English translation of Anti-Oedipus. The\nFrench Communist Party’s agreement with De Gaulle to allow a\nparliamentary solution to the social crisis was a glaring example of\nthe horizon of identity (the desire that someone be in control of a\ncentral State bureaucracy) that allowed an opposition (of the\nGaullists and the Communists as rivals for control of the State) to\nshackle difference. The government response to May 1968 changed French\nacademic life in two ways. First, institutionally, by the creation of\nParis VIII (Vincennes) where Deleuze taught; and second, in the\ndirection of the philosophy of difference, which became explicitly\npolitical post-1968.  It became, in fact, a politics of philosophy\ndedicated to exposing the historical force relations producing\nidentity in all its ontological and epistemological forms. In other\nwords, the philosophy of difference now set out to show how the\nunified objects of the world, the unified subjects who know and hence\ncontrol them, the unified bodies of knowledge that codify this\nknowledge, and the unified institution of philosophy that polices the\nwhole affair, are products of historical, political forces in combat\nwith other forces. \n\nIn purely philosophical terms, the works with Guattari naturalize the\nstill-Kantian framework of Difference and Repetition. By the\ntime of Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus Deleuze\nand Guattari explicitly thematize that the syntheses they investigate\nare fully material syntheses, syntheses of nature in geological as\nwell as biological, social, and psychological registers (Welchman\n2009). Not just organic syntheses, but inorganic ones as well, are\n“spatio-temporal dynamisms.” With this full naturalization\nof syntheses, the question of panpsychism is brought into full relief\n(Protevi 2011), since material syntheses are as much syntheses of\nexperience as they are syntheses of things, as we see in the title of\nChapter 3 of A Thousand Plateaus: “The Geology of\nMorals: Who does the earth think it is?” \n\nIn considering Anti-Oedipus we should first discuss its\nperformative effect, which attempts to “force us to\nthink,” that is, to fight against a tendency to\ncliché. Reading Anti-Oedipus can indeed be shocking\nexperience. First, we find a bizarre collection of sources; for\nexample, the schizophrenic ranting of Antonin Artaud provides one of\nthe basic concepts of the work, the “body without organs.”\nSecond is the book’s vulgarity, as in the infamous opening lines about\nthe unconscious (the Id): “It is at work everywhere, functioning\nsmoothly at times, at other times in fits and starts. It breathes, it\nheats, it eats. It shits and fucks [Ça chie, ça\nbaise]. What a mistake to have ever said the id”\n(7 / 1). A third performative effect is humor, as in the mocking of\nMelanie Klein’s analysis of children: “Say it’s Oedipus, or I’ll\nslap you upside the head [sinon t’auras un gifle]” (54\n/ 45; trans. modified). There are many more passages like this; it’s\nsafe to say very few philosophy books contain as many jokes, puns, and\ndouble entendres as Anti-Oedipus. A fourth element\nis the gleeful coarseness of the polemics. Among many other examples,\nthinkers of the signifier are associated with the lap dogs of tyrants,\nmembers of the French Communist Party are said to have fascist\nlibidinal investments, and Freud is described as a “masked Al\nCapone.” All in all, the performative effect of reading\nAnti-Oedipus is unforgettable. \n\nPassing to the conceptual structure of the book, the key term of\nAnti-Oedipus is “desiring-production,” which\ncrisscrosses Marx and Freud, putting desire in the eco-social realm of\nproduction and production in the unconscious realm of desire. Rather\nthan attempting to synthesize Marx and Freud in the usual way, that\nis, by a reductionist strategy that either (1) operates in favor of\nFreud, by positing that the libidinal investment of social figures and\npatterns requires sublimating an original investment in family figures\nand patterns, or (2) operates in favor of Marx by positing neuroses\nand psychoses as mere super-structural by-products of unjust social\nstructures, Deleuze and Guattari will call desiring-production a\n“universal primary process” underlying the seemingly\nseparate natural, social and psychological realms. Desiring-production\nis thus not anthropocentric; it is the very heart of the\nworld. Besides its universal scope, we need to realize two things\nabout desiring-production right away: (1) there is no subject that\nlies behind the production, that performs the production; and (2) the\n“desire” in desiring-production is not oriented to making\nup a lack, but is purely positive. Desiring-production is autonomous,\nself-constituting, and creative: it is the natura naturans of\nSpinoza or the will-to-power of Nietzsche. \n\nAnti-Oedipus is, along with its conceptual and terminological\ninnovation, a work of grand ambitions: among them, (1) an eco-social\ntheory of production, encompassing both sides of the nature/culture\nsplit, which functions as an ontology of change, transformation, or\n“becoming”; (2) a “universal history” of\nsocial formations—the “savage” or tribal, the\n“barbarian” or imperial, and the capitalist—which\nfunctions as a synthetic social science; (3) and to clear the ground\nfor these functions, a critique of the received versions of Marx and\nFreud—and the attempts to synthesize them by analogizing their\nrealms of application. In pursuing its ambitions,\nAnti-Oedipus has the virtues and the faults of the tour\nde force: unimagined connections between disparate elements are\nmade possible, but at the cost of a somewhat strained conceptual\nscheme. \n\nAnti-Oedipus identifies two primary registers of\ndesiring-production, the natural or “metaphysical” and the\nsocial or “historical.” They are related in the following\nway: natural desiring-production is that which social machines\nrepress, but also that which is revealed in capitalism, at the end of\nhistory (a contingent history, that is, one that avoids dialectical\nlaws of history). Capitalism sets free desiring-production even as it\nattempts to rein it in with the institution of private property and\nthe familial or “Oedipal” patterning of desire;\nschizophrenics are propelled by the charge of desiring-production thus\nset free but fail at the limits capitalist society proposes, thus\nproviding a clue to the workings of desiring-production. \n\nIt’s important at the start to realize that Deleuze and Guattari do\nnot advocate schizophrenia as a “lifestyle” or as the\nmodel for a political program. The schizophrenic, as a clinical\nentity, is the result of the interruption or the blocking of the\nprocess of desiring-production, its having been taken out of nature\nand society and restricted to the body of an individual where it spins\nin the void rather than make the connections that constitute reality.\nDesiring-production does not connect “with” reality, as in\nescaping a subjective prison to touch the objective, but it makes\nreality, it is the Real, in a twisting of the Lacanian sense of the\nterm. In Lacan, the real is produced as an illusory and retrojected\nremainder to a signifying system; for Deleuze and Guattari, the Real\nis reality itself in its process of self-making. The schizophrenic is\na sick person in need of help, but schizophrenia is an avenue into the\nunconscious, the unconscious not of an individual, but the\n“transcendental unconscious,” an unconscious that is\nsocial, historical, and natural all at once. \n\nIn studying the schizophrenic process, Deleuze and Guattari posit that\nin both the natural and social registers desiring-production is\ncomposed of three syntheses, the connective, disjunctive, and\nconjunctive; the syntheses perform three functions: production,\nrecording, and enjoyment. We can associate production with the\nphysiological, recording with the semiotic, and enjoyment with the\npsychological registers. While it is important to catch the Kantian\nresonance of “synthesis,” it is equally important to note,\nin keeping with the post-structuralist angle we discussed above, that\nthere is no subject performing the syntheses; instead, subjects are\nthemselves one of the products of the syntheses. The syntheses have no\nunderlying subject; they just are the immanent process of\ndesiring-production.  Positing a subject behind the syntheses would be\na transcendent use of the syntheses. Here we see another reference to\nthe Kantian principle of immanence. Deleuze and Guattari propose to\nstudy the immanent use of the synthesis in a “materialist\npsychoanalysis,” or “schizoanalysis”; by contrast,\npsychoanalysis is transcendent use of the syntheses, producing five\n“paralogisms” or “transcendental illusions,”\nall of which involve assigning the characteristics of the extensive\nproperties of actual products to the intensive production process, or,\nto put it in the terms of the philosophy of difference, all the\nparalogisms subordinate differential processes to identities derived\nfrom products. \n\nAccording to the “universal history” undertaken in\nAnti-Oedipus, social life has three forms of\n“socius,” the social body that takes credit for\nproduction: the earth for the tribe, the body of the despot for the\nempire, and capital for capitalism.  According to Deleuze and\nGuattari’s reading of the anthropological literature, tribal societies\nmark bodies in initiation ceremonies, so that the products of an organ\nare traced to a clan, which is mythically traced to the earth or, more\nprecisely, one of its enchanted regions, which function as the organs\non the full body of the earth. Material flows are thus\n“territorialized,” that is, traced onto the earth, which\nis credited as the source of all production. The signs in tribal\ninscription are not signifiers: they do not map onto a voice, but\nenact a “savage triangle forming … a theater of cruelty\nthat implies the triple independence of the articulated voice, the\ngraphic hand and the appreciative eye” (189). Empires overcode\nthese tribal meaning codes, tracing production back to the despot, the\ndivine father of his people. Material flows in despotic empires are\nthus “deterritorialized” (they are no longer credited to\nthe earth), and then immediately “reterritorialized” on\nthe body of the despot, who assumes credit for all production. When\ntribal signs are overcoded, the signifier is formed as a\n“deterritorialized sign” allowing for communication\nbetween the conquered and the conquerors. Signifiers are a\n“flattening” or “bi-univocalization”: two\nchains are lined up, one to one, the written and the spoken (205–6;\ncf. Derrida’s notion of “phonocentrism”). The body of the\ndespot as imperial socius means that workers are the\n“hands” of the emperor, spies are his “eyes,”\nand so on. \n\nCapitalism is the radical decoding and deterritorialization of the\nmaterial flows that previous social machines had zealously coded on\nthe earth or the body of the despot. Production is credited to the\n“body” of capital, but this form of recording works by the\nsubstitution of an “axiomatic” for a code: in this context\nan “axiomatic” means a set of simple principles for the\nquantitative calculation of the difference between flows (of\ndeterritorialized labor and capital) rather than elaborate rules for\nthe qualitative judgments that map flows onto the socius. Capitalism’s\ncommand is utterly simple: connect deterritorialized flows of labor\nand capital and extract a surplus from that connection. Thus\ncapitalism sets loose an enormous productive charge—connect\nthose flows! Faster, faster!—the surpluses of which the\ninstitutions of private property try to register as belonging to\nindividuals. Now those individuals are primarily social (as figures of\ncapitalist or laborer) and only secondarily private (family\nmembers). Whereas organs of bodies were socially marked in previous\nregimes (as belonging to the clan and earth, or as belonging to the\nemperor, as in the jus primae noctis), body organs are\nprivatized under capitalism and attached to persons as members of the\nfamily. In Deleuze and Guattari’s terms, capitalism’s decoded flows\nare reterritorialized on “persons,” that is, on family\nmembers as figures in the Oedipal triangle. \n\nThree differences between this work and its predecessor are\nimmediately apparent. First, A Thousand Plateaus has a much\nwider range of registers than Anti-Oedipus: cosmic, geologic,\nevolutionary, developmental, ethological, anthropological,\nmythological, historical, economic, political, literary, musical, and\neven more. Second, the results of the paralogisms of\nAnti-Oedipus become “strata” in A Thousand\nPlateaus: the organism (the unification and totalization of the\nconnective synthesis of production, or the physiological register),\nthe signifying totality or signifiance, which we can perhaps render as\n“signifier-ness” (the flattening or\n“bi-univocalizing” of the disjunctive synthesis of\nrecording, the semiotic register), and the subject (the reification of\nthe conjunctive synthesis of consummation, the psychological\nregister). Finally, while Anti-Oedipus has a classical\nconceptual architecture, that is, chapters that develop a single\nargument, A Thousand Plateaus is written as a\n“rhizome,” that is, as allowing immediate connections\nbetween any of its points. Because of this rhizomatic structure, a\ntraditional summary of the “theses” and arguments of A\nThousand Plateaus is either downright impossible, or at best,\nwould be much too complex to attempt in an encyclopedia article. We\nwill therefore have to limit ourselves to the following remarks. \n\nIn fourteen plateaus, or planes of intensity—productive\nconnections between immanently arrayed material systems without\nreference to an external governing source—Deleuze and Guattari\ndevelop a new materialism in which a politicized philosophy of\ndifference joins forces with the sciences explored in Difference and\nRepetition. A Thousand Plateaus is a book of strange new\nquestions: “Who Does the Earth Think It Is?,” “How\nDo You make Yourself a Body Without Organs?,” “How does\nthe war-machine ward off the apparatus of capture of the State?”\nand so on. To over-simplify, Deleuze and Guattari take up the insights\nof dynamical systems theory, which explores the various thresholds at\nwhich material systems self-organize (that is, reduce their degrees of\nfreedom, as in our previous example of convection currents). Deleuze\nand Guattari then extend the notion of self-organizing material\nsystems—those with no need of transcendent organizing agents\nsuch as gods, leaders, capital, or subjects—to the social,\nlinguistic, political-economic, and psychological realms. The\nresultant “rhizome” or de-centered network that is A\nThousand Plateaus provides hints for experimentation with the\nmore and more de-regulated flows of energy and matter, ideas and\nactions—and the attendant attempts at binding them—that\nmake up the contemporary world. \n\nA Thousand Plateaus maintains the tripartite ontological\nscheme of all of Deleuze’s work, but, as the title indicates, with\ngeological terms of reference. Deleuze and Guattari call the virtual\n“the Earth,” the intensive is called\n“consistency,” and the actual is called “the system\nof the strata.” As the latter term indicates, one of the foci of\ntheir investigations is the tendency of some systems to head toward\ncongealment or stratification. More precisely put, any concrete system\nis composed of intensive processes tending toward the (virtual) plane\nof consistency and/or toward (actual) stratification.  We can say that\nall that exists is the intensive, tending towards the limits of\nvirtuality and actuality; these last two ontological registers do not\n“exist,” but they do “insist,” to use one of\nDeleuze’s terms. Nothing ever instantiates the sheer frozen stasis of\nthe actual nor the sheer differential dispersion of the virtual;\nrather, natural or worldly processes are always and only\nactualizations, that is, they are processes of actualization\nstructured by virtual multiplicities and heading toward an actual\nstate they never quite attain. More precisely, systems also contain\ntendencies moving in the other direction, toward virtuality; systems\nare more or less stable sets of processes moving in different\ndirections, toward actuality and toward virtuality. In still other\nwords, Deleuze and Guattari are process philosophers; neither the\nstructures of such processes nor their completed products merit the\nsame ontological status as processes themselves. With this\nperspective, Deleuze and Guattari offer a detailed and complex\n“open system” which is extraordinarily rich and complex. A\nuseful way into it is to follow the concepts of coding, stratification\nand territorialization. They are related in the following\nmanner. Coding is the process of ordering matter as it is drawn into a\nbody; by contrast, stratification is the process of creating\nhierarchal bodies, while territorialization is the ordering of those\nbodies in “assemblages,” that is to say, an emergent unity\njoining together heterogeneous bodies in a\n“consistency.” \n\nThese concepts, and several other networks of concepts considerations\nof space preclude us from considering, are put to work in addressing\nthe following topics. After a discussion of the notion of\n“rhizome” in the first chapter (or “plateau”\nas they call it), Deleuze and Guattari quickly dismiss psychoanalysis\nin the second. In the third chapter they discuss the process of\nstratification in physical, organic, and social strata, with special\nattention to questions in population genetics, where speciation can be\nthought to stratify or channel the flow of genes. In chapters 4 and 5\nthey intervene in debates in linguistics in favor of pragmatics, that\nis to say, highlighting the “incorporeal transformations”\n(labels that prompt a different form of action to be applied to a\nbody: “I now pronounce you man and wife”) that socially\nsanctioned “order words” bring about (Deleuze and Guattari\nalso refer to speech act theory in this regard).  They also lay out\nthe theory of “territories” or sets of environmentally\nembedded triggers of self-organizing processes, and the concomitant\nprocesses of deterritorialization (breaking of habits) and\nreterritorialization (formation of habits). Chapters 6 and 7 discuss\nmethods of experimenting with the strata in which we found ourselves.\nChapter 6 deals with the organic stratum or the\n“organism”; the notorious term of art “Body without\nOrgans” can be at least partially glossed as the reservoir of\npotentials for different patterns of bodily affect. Chapter 7 deals\nwith the intersection of signifiance\n(“signifier-ness”) and subjectification in\n“faciality”; the face arrests the drift of signification\nby tying meaning to the expressive gestures of a subject. Chapters 8\nand 9 deal with the social organizing practices they name\n“lines” and “segments”; of particular interest\nhere is their treatment of fascism. Chapter 10 returns to the question\nof intensive experimentation, now discussed in terms of\n“becoming,” in which (at least) two systems come together\nto form an emergent system or “assemblage.” Chapter 11\ndiscusses the “refrain” or rhythm as a means of escaping\nfrom and forming new territories, or even existing in a process of\ncontinual deterritorialization, what they call\n“consistency.” Chapters 12 and 13 discuss the relation of\nthe “war machine” and the State; the former is a form of\nsocial organization that fosters creativity (it\n“reterritorializes on deterritorialization itself”), while\nthe latter is an “apparatus of capture” living\nvampirically off of labor (here Deleuze and Guattari’s basically\nMarxist perspective is apparent). Finally, Chapter 14 discusses types\nof social constitution of space, primarily the “smooth”\nspace of war machines and the “striated” space of\nStates. \n\nAfter a long period in which each pursued his own interests, Deleuze\nand Guattari published a last collaboration in 1991, What Is\nPhilosophy? In answering\ntheir title question, Deleuze and Guattari seek to place philosophy in\nrelation to science and art, all three being modes of thought, with no\nsubordination among them. Thought, in all its modes, struggles with\nchaos against opinion. Philosophy is the creation or construction of\nconcepts; a concept is an intensive multiplicity, inscribed on a plane\nof immanence, and peopled by “conceptual personae” which\noperate the conceptual machinery. A conceptual persona is not a\nsubject, for thinking is not subjective, but takes place in the\nrelationship of territory and earth. Science creates functions on a\nplane of reference.  Art creates “a bloc of sensation, that is\nto say, a compound of percepts and affects” (WP, 164). \n\nWe will deal with Deleuze and the arts in some detail below. In\ndiscussing What is Philosophy?, let us concentrate on the\ntreatment of the relation of philosophy and science. We should\nremember at the outset that the nomad or minor science evoked in A\nThousand Plateaus is not the Royal or major science that makes up\nthe entirety of what Deleuze and Guattari call ‘science’\nin What is Philosophy?. The motives for this conflation are\nunclear; in the eyes of some, this change considerably weakens the\nvalue of the latter work. Be that as it may, in What is\nPhilosophy? Deleuze and Guattari vigorously deny that philosophy\nis needed to help science think about its own presuppositions\n(“no one needs philosophy to reflect on anything” [WP\n6]). Instead, they emphasize the complementary nature of the two.\nFirst, they point out a number of similarities between philosophy and\nscience: both are approaches to “chaos” that attempt to\nbring order to it, both are creative modes of thought, and both are\ncomplementary to each other, as well as to a third mode of creative\nthought, art. Beyond these similarities, Deleuze and Guattari\ndistinguish between philosophy as the creation of concepts on a plane\nof immanence and science as the creation of functions on a plane of\nreference. Both relate to the virtual, the differential field of\npotential transformations of material systems, but in different\nways. Philosophy gives consistency to the virtual, mapping the forces\ncomposing a system as pure potentials, what the system is capable\nof. Meanwhile, science gives it reference, determining the conditions\nby which systems behave the way they actually do. Philosophy is the\n“counter-effectuation of the event,” abstracting an event\nor change of pattern from bodies and states of affairs and thereby\nlaying out the transformative potentials inherent in things, the roads\nnot taken that coexist as compossibles or as inclusive disjunctions\n(differentiation, in the terms of Difference and Repetition),\nwhile science tracks the actualization of the virtual, explaining why\nthis one road was chosen in a divergent series or exclusive\ndisjunction (differenciation, according to Difference and\nRepetition). Functions predict the behavior of constituted\nsystems, laying out their patterns and predicting change based on\ncausal chains, while concepts “speak the event” (WP 21),\nmapping out the multiplicity structuring the possible patterns of\nbehavior of a system—and the points at which the system can\nchange its habits and develop new ones. For Deleuze and Guattari in\nWhat is Philosophy?, then, science deals with properties of\nconstituted things, while philosophy deals with the constitution of\nevents. Roughly speaking, philosophy explores the plane of immanence\ncomposed of constellations of constitutive forces that can be\nabstracted from bodies and states of affairs. It thus maps the range\nof connections a thing is capable of, its “becomings” or\n“affects.” Science, on the other hand, explores the\nconcretization of these forces into bodies and states of affairs,\ntracking the behavior of things in relation to already constituted\nthings in a certain delimited region of space and time (the\n“plane of reference”). How do concepts relate to\nfunctions? Just as there is a “concept of concept” there\nare also “concepts of functions,” but these are purely\nphilosophical creations “without the least scientific\nvalue” (WP 117). Thus concrete concepts like that of\n“deterritorialization” are philosophical concepts, not\nscientific functions, even though they might resonate with, or echo,\nscientific functions. Nor are they metaphors, as Deleuze and Guattari\nrepeatedly insist: \n\nOf course, we realize the dangers of citing scientific propositions\noutside their own sphere. It is the danger of arbitrary metaphor or of\nforced application. But perhaps these dangers are averted if we\nrestrict ourselves to taking from scientific operators a particular\nconceptualizable character which itself refers to non-scientific\nareas, and converges with science without applying it or making it a\nmetaphor (Deleuze 1989: 129). \n\nDeleuze and Guattari’s refusal to recognize that their work contains\nmetaphors is due to their struggle against the\n“imperialism” of the signifying regime, a major theme in\nboth Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus: not every\nrelation between different intellectual fields can be grasped by the\nmost common notions of “metaphor,” reliant as they are on\nthe notion of a transfer of sense from primary to secondary\nsignification. \n\nKant had dissociated aesthetics into two halves: the theory of\nsensibility as the form of possible experience (the\n“Transcendental Aesthetic” of the Critique of Pure\nReason), and the theory of art as a reflection on real experience\n(the “Critique of Aesthetic Judgment” in the Critique\nof Judgment). In Deleuze’s work, these two halves of aesthetics\nare reunited: if the most general aim of art is to “produce a\nsensation,” then the genetic principles of sensation are at the\nsame time the principles of composition for works of art; conversely,\nit is works of art that are best capable of revealing these conditions\nof sensibility. Deleuze therefore writes on the arts not as a critic\nbut as a philosopher, and his books and essays on the various\narts—including the cinema (Cinema I and II), literature\n(Essays Critical and Clinical), and painting (Francis\nBacon: The Logic of Sensation)—must be read as\nphilosophical explorations of this transcendental domain of\nsensibility. The cinema, for instance, produces images that move, and\nthat move in time, and it is these two aspects of film that Deleuze\nset out to analyze in The Movement-Image and The\nTime-Image: “What exactly does the cinema show us about\nspace and time that the other arts don’t show?” Deleuze thus\ndescribes his two-volume Cinema as “a book of logic, a\nlogic of the cinema” that sets out “to isolate certain\ncinematographic concepts,” concepts which are specific to the\ncinema, but which can only be formed philosophically. Francis\nBacon: The Logic of Sensation likewise creates a series of\nphilosophical concepts, each of which relates to a particular aspect\nof Bacon’s paintings, but which also find a place in “a general\nlogic of sensation.” In general, Deleuze will locate the\nconditions of sensibility in an intensive conception of space and a\nvirtual conception of time, which are necessarily actualized in a\nplurality of spaces and a complex rhythm of times (for instance, in\nthe non-extended spaces and non-linear times of modern mathematics and\nphysics). \n\nFor Deleuze, the task of art is to produce “signs” that\nwill push us out of our habits of perception into the conditions of\ncreation. When we perceive via the re-cognition of the properties of\nsubstances, we see with a stale eye pre-loaded with clichés; we\norder the world in what Deleuze calls “representation.” In\nthis regard, Deleuze cites Francis Bacon: we’re after an artwork that\nproduces an effect on the nervous system, not on the brain. What he\nmeans by this figure of speech is that in an art encounter we are\nforced to experience the “being of the sensible.” We get\nsomething that we cannot re-cognize, something that is\n“imperceptible”—it doesn’t fit the hylomorphic\nproduction model of perception in which sense data, the\n“matter” or hyle of sensation, is ordered by\nsubmission to conceptual form. Art however cannot be re-cognized, but\ncan only be sensed; in other words, art splits perceptual processing,\nforbidding the move to conceptual ordering. This is exactly what Kant\nin the Third Critique called reflective judgment: when the concept is\nnot immediately given in the presentation of art. With art we reach\n“sensation,” or the “being of the sensible,”\nthe sentiendum. \n\nDeleuze talks about this effect of sensation as the\n“transcendent exercise” of the faculty of sensibility;\nhere we could refer to the third chapter of Difference and\nRepetition, where Deleuze lays out a non-Kantian\n“differential theory of the faculties.” In this remarkable\ntheory, intensity is “difference in itself,” that which\ncarries the faculties to their limits. The faculties are linked in\norder; here we see what Deleuze calls the privilege of sensibility as\norigin of knowledge—the “truth of empiricism.” In\nthe differential theory of the faculties, sensibility, imagination,\nmemory, and thought all “communicate a violence” from one\nto the other. With sensibility, pure difference in intensity is\ngrasped immediately in the encounter as the sentiendum; with\nimagination, the disparity in the phantasm is that which can only be\nimagined. With memory, in turn, the memorandum is the\ndissimilar in the pure form of time, or the immemorial of transcendent\nmemory. With thought, a fractured self is constrained to think\n“difference in itself” in Ideas. Thus the “free form\nof difference” moves each faculty and communicates its violence\nto the next. You have to be forced to think, starting with an art\nencounter in which intensity is transmitted in signs or sensation.\nRather than a “common sense” in which all the faculties\nagree in recognizing the “same” object, we find in this\ncommunicated violence a “discordant harmony” (compare the\nKantian sublime) that tears apart the subject (here we find the notion of\n“cruelty” Deleuze picks up from Artaud). \n\nThe writings of Deleuze have provoked a large literature of\nexplication and introduction in both French and English; more\nrecently, works in German, Italian, and other European languages have\nappeared.  There have also been noteworthy critiques. Rather than\nattempt a complete survey of the voluminous secondary literature, we\nwill concentrate on a few of the major critiques. \n\nAn early wave of criticism was directed in the 1980s at Deleuze’s\ncollaborations with Guattari by feminists such as Alice Jardine and\nLuce Irigaray. Jardine 1985 criticized the concept of\n“becoming-woman” in A Thousand Plateaus, which\nDeleuze and Guattari position as the first step towards a\nde-subjectivizing “becoming-indiscernible.” Jardine argued\nthat Deleuze and Guattari’s claim that even women must undergo a\n“becoming-woman” amounts to a threat to the hard-fought\nvictories of concrete feminist struggle that allowed women to claim a\nsubjectivity in the first place. According to Grosz 1994’s survey of\nthe early feminist critiques, Irigaray argued that the use of\n“becoming-woman” as a figure of change incumbent upon all,\nincluding men, amounts to a masculinist and desexualizing\nappropriation of feminist struggle. In the 1990s and now into the\n2000s, a number of feminists associated with the “corporeal\nfeminism” movement have attempted positive connections with\nDeleuze in the name of an open and experimental attitude toward bodily\npotentials, in both the singular and political registers, as in the\nphrase “body politic.” See among others Braidotti 1994 and\n2002; Gatens 1996; Grosz 1994 and 1995; Olkowski 1999; Lorraine 1999;\nand the essays in Buchanan and Colebrook 2002. \n\nOne of the most important criticisms of Deleuze was put forth in\nBadiou 1997. Badiou claimed, contrary to the dominant perception, that\nDeleuze is not so much a philosopher of the multiple as of the\nOne. Conducted in the highly technical idiom for which he is known,\nBadiou criticizes Deleuze for a certain vitalism, which in Badiou’s\neyes falls short of the axiomatic austerity demanded of\nphilosophy. Whereas Badiou merely ignored the collaborative works with\nGuattari, Zizek 2003 conducts a polemic against the Guattari\ncollaborations in favor of a Deleuzean logic of Being characterized as\nan “immaterial affect generated by interacting bodies as a\nsterile surface of pure Becoming” (as in Logic of\nSense). A third critical work in this vein is Hallward 2005. For\nHallward, the singular logic of Deleuze’s thought is analogous to the\ntradition of theophantic thinkers, whereby the divine spark of\ncreation is entombed in creatures; the task of the creature is to\nredeem that divine spark from its creatural prison. But this\nredemption is not annihilation; Deleuze’s philosophy is not that of\nLacanian-Zizekian “renunciation-extinction.” \n\nIn response to the Badiouan critique, we can note that one of the most\npromising leads for future research in discussing the relation of\nBadiou and Deleuze is to concentrate on the type of mathematics each\nthinker prefers. Rather than accepting Badiou’s characterization of\nDeleuze as a thinker of reality in biological term (as opposed to\nBadiou’s mathematical orientation), we should see Deleuze as proposing\na “problematic” version of mathematics, versus Badiou’s\naxiomatic conception. This tack has been taken by Smith 2003. \n\nDeleuze was one of the targets of the polemic in Sokal and Bricmont\n1999. As much of their chapter on Deleuze consists of exasperated\nexclamations of incomprehension, it is hard to say what it is that\nSokal and Bricmont think they have accomplished. One thing is clear\nthough: Deleuze was perfectly aware of the finitist revolution in the\nhistory of the differential calculus, despite Sokal and Bricmont’s\nintimations otherwise. He writes in Difference and\nRepetition, “it is a mistake to tie the value of the symbol\ndx to the existence of infinitesimals; but it is also a\nmistake to refuse it any ontological or gnoseological value in the\nname of a refusal of the latter. In fact, there is a treasure buried\nwithin the old so-called barbaric or pre-scientific interpretations of\nthe differential calculus, which must be separated from its\ninfinitesimal matrix. A great deal of heart and a great deal of truly\nphilosophical naivety is needed in order to take the symbol\ndx seriously …” (170). It seems obvious here\nthat Deleuze’s treatment of early forms of the differential calculus\nis not meant as an intervention into the history of mathematics, or an\nattempt at a philosophy of mathematics, but as an investigation\nseeking to form a properly philosophical concept of difference by\nmeans of extracting certain forms of thought from what he clearly\nlabels as antiquated mathematical methods. (For positive views of\nDeleuze’s use of mathematics as provocations for the formation of his\nphilosophical concepts, see the essays in Duffy 2006.) \n\nAnother and perhaps more effective response to Sokal and Bricmont\nwould be to point to the positive work done on Deleuze and science.\nMassumi 1992 and DeLanda 2003 attempt to show that Deleuze’s\nepistemology and ontology can be brought together with the results of\ncontemporary dynamical systems theory (popularly known as\n“chaos” and “complexity” theory). Bell 2006\nfollows up on this work. Protevi 2001 looks at the accompanying\nnotions of hylomorphism and self-organization in the history of\nphilosophy; Bonta and Protevi 2004 treat Deleuze and dynamic systems\ntheory with regard to its potentials for geographical work. For other\nissues on Deleuze and science, see the essays in Marks 2006. Finally,\nAnsell Pearson 1999 brought attention to Deleuze and biology; see also\nToscano 2006 in this regard. As the interest in Deleuze continues to grow, three of its effects\nare of interest to us, one of which is sociological and the other two\nof which are philosophical. The sociological effect is the globalization of institutions\ndevoted to the study of Deleuze’s thought and its application in\nvarious fields. A noteworthy institutional initiative is the series of\nconferences sponsored by the journal Deleuze and Guattari\nStudies (see Other Internet Resources) under the leadership of\nIan Buchanan. In addition to some 10 conferences in Europe and North\nAmerica, an index of Deleuze’s widespread impact is the success of a\nnumber of conferences in Asia (to date, Taiwan, India, Singapore, and\nSouth Korea). The two philosophical effects are that of reviving interest in\nthose whom Deleuze discusses explicitly or those whose influence on\nDeleuze can be discerned, and that of providing a foil or counterpoint\nor reference point in readings of other philosophers. The most prominent example of the revivifying effect is Bergson,\nrelatively forgotten at the time of Deleuze’s Bergsonism (1966), but\nnow the subject of a growing philosophical literature. Of course, we\ncannot attribute all this interest to Deleuze’s book and to the\nsubsequent secondary literature on Deleuze that stresses the\ncontribution of Bergson to Deleuze’s system (as we ourselves do above\non the concept of the virtual and the critique of the possible), but\nit is not implausible to consider the counterfactual whereby without\nDeleuze’s work the interest in Bergson would not be as strong as it\ncurrently is. Among the Bergson commentaries Mullarkey 1999, Guerlac\n2006, Moulard-Leonard 2009, and Grosz 2017 all link the two thinkers\nin their works. The post-Kantian Salomon Maimon has been for some time now a\nsubject of specialist interest by historians of philosophy; see the\nentry on Maimon; see also the recent English\ntranslation of his major work [Maimon 1790 [2010]).  Maimon’s\nrelation to Deleuze is explored in Jones & Roffe (eds.) 2009,\nSmith 2010, and Voss 2011. Another example of thinker whose current level of interest was\narguably catalyzed by being noticed as an influence on Deleuze is the\nmid-20th century French philosopher Gilbert Simondon, whose notions of\nthe “pre-individual” and of “crystallization”\nwere influential in the development of Deleuze’s notions of the\nvirtual and actualization, respectively. Among others, see Toscano\n2006 and 2009, Scott 2014, Sauvagnargues 2016, Swan 2016, Alloa and\nMichalet 2017 for treatments of the Deleuze-Simondon relation. Yet another would be the early 20th century French sociologist\nGabriel Tarde, whose notion of microsociology is referred to\napprovingly in Deleuze and Guattari’s development of their\nnotion of “micropolitics” (Deleuze and Guattari 1980\n[1987, 216-219]). For Deleuze-inspired treatments, see Alliez 2001,\nBrighenti 2010, Read 2015, Tonkonoff 2017. More recently and to a still muted extent is the revival of\ninterest in mid-20th century French thinker Raymond Ruyer, whose\nnotion of survol or “self-survey” is mentioned by Deleuze\nand Guattari in their brief remarks on the consistency of the concept\nin its neural instantiation in What is Philosophy (Deleuze and\nGuattari 1991 [1994, 210]). English translations of Ruyer’s works are\nRuyer 2016 and 2018. Ruyer’s relation to Deleuze is explored in Bains\n2002, Bogue 2009 and 2017, and Roffe 2017. Other treatments of Ruyer\nthat are relevant would be Massumi 2014 and Grosz 2017. Finally, while it’s certainly the case that Whitehead has garnered\ncontinuous interest, a good bit of current Whitehead scholarship\nincludes reference to Deleuze as a leitmotif, as in Stengers 2011. A\nnoteworthy new work influenced by both Deleuze and Whitehead is\nWilliams 2016. See also Shaviro 2009, Robinson 2010, and Bell 2011 and\n2012, on the Deleuze and Whitehead connection.","contact.mail":"protevi@lsu.edu","contact.domain":"lsu.edu"}]
