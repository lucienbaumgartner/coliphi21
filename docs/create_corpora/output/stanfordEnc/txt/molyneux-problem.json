In brief, the question Molyneux asked was whether a man who has\nbeen born blind and who has learnt to distinguish and name a globe and\na cube by touch, would be able to distinguish and name these objects\nsimply by sight, once he had been enabled to see.\n\nAs is apparent from both his writings and his lectures, Molyneux was\nhighly interested in optics and in the psychology of sight. To some\nextent this simply reflects the general attitude of his time: optics\nwas a subject that was then engaging the attention of a number of\nleading scientists. His interest also had a more personal background,\nhowever, for his wife had lost her sight in the first year of their\nmarriage. The immediate cause of his formulating the problem and\nsending it to Locke is to be found in Locke’s French extract of An\nEssay Concerning Humane Understanding, published in 1688 in the\nBibliothèque Universelle & Historique. In this\nextract Locke distinguished between ideas we acquire by means of one\nsense and those we acquire by means of more than one sense. He\nmaintained that someone who lacks a sense will never be able to\nacquire the ideas pertaining to it. A blind man, for example, will\nnever be able to have any idea of colour. Among the ideas we are able\nto acquire by means of a combination of senses, Locke reckoned those\nof space, rest, motion and figure. Molyneux’s problem had to do with\nthe last of these. Molyneux was probably inspired by Locke’s\nexposition of the ideas of persons born blind and the ideas which can\nbe acquired by means of both sight and touch. He was, moreover, a\ngreat admirer of Locke. (In addition to this, Molyneux may have been\ninspired by Ibn Tufail’s twelfth-century philosophical novel Hayy\nibn Yaqdhan, which had just been published in Latin (1671) and\nEnglish (1674) and also had an influence on\n Locke.)[1] \nOn Saturday 7 July 1688 William Molyneux wrote a letter to John Locke\nsetting out for the first time his problem concerning the person born\nblind: \nDublin July. 7. 88 \nA Problem Proposed to the Author of the Essai Philosophique\nconcernant L’Entendement  \nA Man, being born blind, and having a Globe and a Cube, nigh of the\nsame bignes, Committed into his Hands, and being taught or Told, which\nis Called the Globe, and which the Cube, so as easily to distinguish\nthem by his Touch or Feeling; Then both being taken from Him, and Laid\non a Table, Let us Suppose his Sight Restored to Him; Whether he\nCould, by his Sight, and before he touch them, know which is the Globe\nand which the Cube? Or Whether he Could know by his Sight, before he\nstretch’d out his Hand, whether he Could not Reach them, tho they were\nRemoved 20 or 1000 feet from Him? \nIf the Learned and Ingenious Author of the Forementiond Treatise think\nthis Problem Worth his Consideration and Answer, He may at any time\nDirect it to One that Much Esteems him, and is, \nHis Humble Servant\n\nWilliam Molyneux\n\nHigh Ormonds Gate in Dublin. Ireland \nFor reasons unknown Locke never replied to the letter. However, a\ncouple of years later, after the two men had started an amicable\ncorrespondence, Molyneux returned to his problem. This time with\nsuccess. In his letter, dated 2 March 1693, Molyneux presented Locke\nwith his problem, though in a somewhat altered form, asking Locke if\nhe could perhaps find some place in his Essay to say\nsomething about it. This time Locke reacted with enthusiasm:\n“Your ingenious problem will deserve to be published to the\nworld.” From the second edition of his Essay (that of\n1694) Locke included Molyneux’s problem in his work and thereby made\nit accessible to a wider audience: \nIn this formulation Molyneux’s problem attracted the attention of lots\nof philosophers and other men of learning, such as Berkeley, Leibniz,\nVoltaire, Diderot, La Mettrie, Helmholtz and William James. In\nwhich ways did they approach the problem? \nIn the first instance, philosophers considered it to be impossible\nthat a man born blind should be able to acquire sight. They regarded\nMolyneux’s problem as a kind of thought-experiment, which was to be\ndealt with by ratiocination alone. The arguments put forward were\nusually concerned with the relation between visual and tactual\nsensations or between visual and tactual notions of the form of\nobjects. \nAll these philosophers assumed that the visual and tactual sensations\nof an object differ from each other, but there was no agreement\nconcerning the relation between the two. Some, Berkeley for instance,\nbelieved that this relation is arbitrary and based only on experience.\nOthers, such as Lee and Synge, thought that it is necessary and\nperceived directly, while yet others, such as Molyneux and Locke,\nthought that it is necessary and learned by experience. Opinions were\nalso divided concerning the relation between visual and tactual\nnotions of objects. Some philosophers defended the position that the\nvisual and tactual notions of a globe differ from one another, and can\nonly be related by either experience or reason (the latter view was\ndefended by Reid). Others believed that the visual and the tactual\nnotion of a globe are actually the same, or have something in common\nwhich is either observed directly (Boullier and Hutcheson) or inferred\nby reason (Leibniz). \nInvestigating how the different positions correlate with the answers\ngiven to Molyneux’s question, one can conclude as follows. Empiricists\nsuch as Molyneux, Locke and Berkeley answered in the negative. More\nrationalist philosophers such as Synge, Lee and Leibniz gave an\naffirmative answer. There was no unanimous solution, amongst others\nbecause Molyneux’s problem was interpreted in different ways. Some\nphilosophers thought that the man born blind had to answer directly,\nwhile others were of the opinion that he should be able to make use of\nhis memory and reason, and that he should be at liberty to view all\nsides of the objects by walking around them. Some philosophers\nbelieved that the question implied that the man should be told in\nadvance that he would be presented with a globe and cube, whereas\nothers thought that he should not be provided with this\ninformation. \nDiscussion concerning Molyneux’s problem took a new turn once the\nEnglish surgeon and anatomist William Cheselden (1688–1752)\npublished an account of what a congenitally blind person had seen\nafter his cataracts had been removed (1728). The publication led\nphilosophers to regard the Molyneux problem no longer as a simple\nthought-experiment, but as a question which could be answered by\nexperimentation. \nIn his account, Cheselden noted that when the boy was first able to\nsee, he did not know the shape of a thing and could not recognize one\nthing from another, regardless of how different in shape or magnitude\nthey were. Some philosophers thought that Cheselden’s observations\nwere unequivocal and that they confirmed the hypothesis that a blind\nman restored to sight would not be able to distinguish objects and\nwould have to learn to see. Most of these philosophers, we might\nmention Voltaire, Camper and the elder Condillac as examples, were\nadherents of Berkeley’s theory of vision, which had predicted a\nsimilar outcome. \nOthers, however, such as La Mettrie and Diderot, regarded Cheselden’s\naccount as wholly ambiguous in its implications. They pointed out that\nit was possible that the boy had been unable to make valid perceptual\njudgments because his eyes had not been functioning properly. They\nsuggested that this could have been due to the fact that his eyes had\nnot been used for a long time, or to their not having had enough time\nto recover from the operation. They pointed out that Cheselden had,\nperhaps, asked the boy leading questions. Some philosophers also\nbelieved that the results of the inquiry depended on the intelligence\nof the patient. \nThose who criticised the significance of Cheselden’s account in this\nway (most of them were French philosophes) made proposals as\nto how to avoid the problems mentioned. They suggested that one should\nprepare the patient carefully for the operation and for the\ninterrogation, that one should allow his eyes time to recover from the\noperation and that one should give him the opportunity to exercise his\neyes in darkness. What is more, one should avoid asking leading\nquestions. \nSome philosophers were even more radically critical of operations like\nthat performed by Cheselden. Mérian, for example, noticed that\nCheselden’s observations, like all observations of blind people whose\ncataracts have been extracted, present difficulties because cataracts\ndo not cause complete blindness and complete blindness cannot be\ncured. It could not be concluded from this that Molyneux’s problem\ncould not be solved experimentally, however, for it could be\nmaintained that patients operated upon for cataracts are directly\nrelevant to the solution of it. They are unable to perceive form\nbefore they are operated upon, and the essential issue at stake when\nposing Molyneux’s problem is the ability to distinguish and name\nforms. This is a point of view which was taken by many\nphilosophers. \nAbout 1800 several developments occurred which justify the speaking of\na new period in the history of Molyneux’s problem. New accounts of\npatients operated on for cataracts were published, and shed fresh\nlight on the issue. Whereas Cheselden had only noticed what his\npatient observed in more or less natural circumstances, later\nophthalmologists performed experiments which showed whether their\npatients were able to see form, size, distance, etc. Some, such as\nFranz and Nunneley, were especially interested in Molyneux’s problem\nas such, and performed experiments with the prescribed globe and cube.\nSome of the reports were in agreement with that of Cheselden, others\nconflicted with it. The cases could not easily be compared, however,\nsince the pre- and post-operative circumstances differed to such a\ngreat extent. As one might have expected, an extended scale of\npossible solutions to the Molyneux problem was brought under\nconsideration. \nWhat is more, specialists also began to consider observations\nconcerning the sight of newly born animals and babies when discussing\nMolyneux’s problem. Some of those doing research in the field, such as\nAdam Smith and Johannes Müller, supposed that the sight of young\nanimals could be compared with that of a person who had been made to\nsee. The fact that certain animals see objects at a distance as soon\nas they are born suggested that Molyneux’s question could be answered\naffirmatively. This turned out to be a strong argument against\nBerkeley’s theory of vision. Others, Thomas Brown for instance, were\nof the opinion that the visual behaviour of babies could be compared\nwith that of a blind person who had been operated upon and made to\nsee. They were convinced that in both cases seeing has to be learned,\nand that Molyneux’s question had, therefore, to be answered in the\nnegative. \nWheatstone’s discovery that the perception by sight of the third\ndimension of space is immediate, was used as a reason for answering\nMolyneux’s question affirmatively. The discovery was also regarded as\ndisproving Berkeley’s theory of vision. \nThe data concerning the sight of patients who had been operated upon\nfor cataracts, and of young animals and infants, were used as evidence\nin the debate concerning the question of whether the perception of\nspace is innate or acquired. Although Molyneux’s problem was\nfrequently discussed in this debate, there was still no agreement on\nthe right solution to it. \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the main interest in\nMolyneux’s problem has been historical. Biographers and commentators\ndealing with well-known philosophers have analysed the solutions they\nproposed for it. Molyneux’s problem has also turned up frequently in\ntextbooks and general histories of psychology, ophthalmology,\nneurophysiology, etcetera (and also in publications on diverse\ndisciplines, like mathematics, architecture, literature, arts and\nsports). A few authors have written brief and incomplete histories of\nthe problem. Degenaar (1996) has written a comprehensive survey of the\nhistory of the discussion about Molyneux’s problem. Riskin (2002)\ndescribed Molyneux’s problem in the wider context of the\nEnlightenment. \nPhilosophers, psychologists and other scientists have also tried to\nsolve the Molyneux problem by making use of alternative approaches,\nboth old and new. They have, for example, made use of various accounts\nof recovery from early blindness. As was to be expected, these proved\nto be as problematic and inconclusive as were their predecessors in\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. \nThe Molyneux problem has also been tackled by methods more amenable to\nexperimental control than is possible in clinical studies, namely by\nrearing animals in darkness. Visual deprivation experiments have shown\nthat during the development of the visual system there is a certain\ncritical period in connection with the presentation of light patterns.\nDuring this period, changes brought about by deprivation can be\nreversed. If exposure to light is postponed for too long, however, the\ndevelopment of normal visual mechanisms will be extremely difficult,\nif not impossible. Although the results of deprivation experiments are\nnot relevant to the solution of Molyneux’s problem—Molyneux\nsupposed that his blind man had a good visual system, whereas that of\ndeprived animals is abnormal—they have been used as evidence for\nLocke’s position. \nA different approach to Molyneux’s problem involves the use of sensory\nsubstitution devices, developed in the context of corporeal mobility\nor reading (Morgan, 1977). Learning how to use sensory substitution\nsystems has been considered a good approximation to Molyneux’s\nproblem, since such systems present information normally handled by\none modality, such as vision, to another sense, typically audition or\ntouch, using forms of coding novel to the user. Experiments with\nsensory substitution systems show that subjects need some time to\nlearn to distinguish and identify objects, and this has been\ninterpreted as a confirmation of the position of Molyneux and Locke.\nSome researchers have stressed the fact that a sensory aid is not,\nstrictly speaking, a new modality, and that to learn to use such\ndevices is only an approximation to Molyneux’s problem, depending as\nit does upon the raising of similar issues. \nAnother variation of Molyneux’s problem was suggested by Evans (1985).\nHe wondered whether the visual cortex of a patient with congenital\nblindness could be electrically stimulated in such a way that the\npatient experiences a pattern of light flashes (phosphenes) in the\nshape of a square or circle. This question has been investigated\nexperimentally, but the results do not provide a final answer to\nMolyneux’s question (see Jacomuzzi, Kobau and Bruno 2003 for\ndiscussion). \nMore recently, Gallagher (2005, ch. 7) argued that modern\ndevelopmental psychology and neurophysiology suggest that Locke’s\nreaction to Molyneux’s question was right, but for the wrong\nreasons. \nA more or less straightforward attempt to answer Molyneux’s question\nempirically has been carried out during the last decade. One reason\nthat Molyneux’s problem could be posed in the first place is the\ndearth of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital\nblindness. It has been estimated that less than twenty cases have been\nfound in the last 1000 years (Valvo 1971). In Western countries the\nvast majority of cases of curable congenital blindness are detected in\ninfancy and treated as early as possible. However, many congenitally\nblind children in developing countries often do not receive treatment\ndespite having curable conditions because of inadequate medical\nservices. In 2003, Pawan Sinha set up a program in India as a part of\nwhich he treated five patients, aged from 8 to 17 years, that almost\ninstantly took them from total congenital blindness to fully seeing.\nThis provided an opportunity to answer Molyneux’s problem empirically.\nBased on this study, it was concluded that the answer to Molyneux’s\nquestion is likely negative. Although after restoration of sight, the\nsubjects could distinguish between objects visually as effectively as\nthey would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection\nbetween object perceived using the two different senses. The results\nof the touch-to-vision tests were barely better than if the subjects\nhad guessed. However, such cross-modal mappings developed rapidly, in\nthe course of a few days (Held, et al., 2011).  \nA fruitful tendency is taking Molyneux’s problem to be a cluster of\n subproblems[2]\n or generating different versions of or variations on Molyneux’s\nproblem (e.g. Glenny, 2012 and Matthen and Cohen, 2017).  \nThe history of the issues surrounding Molyneux’s question shows that\nthe question was not as easy to answer as Molyneux himself may have\nassumed. On the contrary, there is no problem in the history of the\nphilosophy of perception that has provoked more thought than the\nproblem that Molyneux raised in 1688. In this sense, Molyneux’s\nproblem is one the most fruitful thought-experiments ever proposed in\nthe history of philosophy, which is still as intriguing today as when\nMolyneux first formulated it more than three centuries ago.","contact.mail":"degenaar@erasmiaans.nl","contact.domain":"erasmiaans.nl"}]
