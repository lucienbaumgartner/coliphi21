Immanuel Kant (Lectures on\nEthics) considered it the only inclination that cannot satisfy\nthe Categorical Imperative, and Jean-Paul Sartre claimed that sexual\ndesire aims to capture the other’s freedom (1943: pt. III, ch.\n3]). The Marquis de Sade (a philosopher of sorts) went to the opposite\nextreme, celebrating all types of sexual acts, including rape (1785;\n1791; 1795). Only during contemporary times do philosophers, beginning\nwith Bertrand Russell (1929) and including Sigmund Freud (1905), think\nof sex as generally good (see Soble 2006b and 2008: ch. 2 for a brief\nyet excellent chapters on this history; see also Belliotti 1993: Pt.\nI).\n\n\nSex raises fascinating issues. Rooted in our biology, pervaded by our\nintentionality, and (normally) directed at other human beings, sexual\ndesire is complex and not confined to specific mating seasons. Its\npleasures are powerful and have ruined many lives. Men and women seem\nto exhibit, desire, and experience sex differently (e.g., men, much\nmore than women, consume pornography, have sex with prostitutes,\nfrequent strip clubs, and have fetishes [Buss 2016, esp. chs. 2 and 3;\nLaumann et al. 1994, esp. pt. II; Margolis 2004, esp. ch. 1–3;\nSymons 1979, esp. chs. 1 and 7]). Why this is so, is debatable (Soble\n2008: ch. 10; Wertheimer 2003: ch. 3) but these issues make it crucial\nto understand sexual desire, pleasure, activity, and preferences, and\nto explore the moral aspects of sex.\n\nFour broad lines of thought are prominent regarding sexual desire: (1)\nwhether it is merely a biological drive or an intentional mental\nstate; (2) how it should be defined; (3) whether it is benign or\nmalignant; and (4) whether it admits of perverted forms. (I discuss\n(4) in the third section.) \nDefinitions of sexual desire in terms of sexual pleasure seem to\nunderstand sexual desire as basically an appetite. “Sexual\ndesire” is “desire for contact with another person’s\nbody and for the pleasure which such contact produces” (Goldman\n1977: 268) or “sexual desire” is “the desire for\ncertain bodily pleasures” (Primoratz 1999: 46; see also Soble\n1991: 139–151; 1996: 83). On the first, if X feels sexual\ndesire, then X desires the touch of another person’s\n(Y) body and the sexual pleasure derived through that touch.\nThe second definition avoids the conceptual involvement of another\nperson, understanding sexual desire instead as desire for sexual\npleasures, period. This accommodates cases in which the desire is not\nfor the touch of another’s body: some cases of masturbation,\nvoyeurism, and exhibitionism, for example. \nThese views have in common the idea that sexual desire is desire for\nbrute bodily pleasures, possibly implying that sexual desire is merely\na biological appetite. If so, they face the objection that they\nmischaracterize the nature of sexual desire, which should instead be\nunderstood as intentional through and through (Morgan 2003b). So\nwhenever X sexually desires someone or something, X does\nso under a description: X desires Y because something\nabout Y appeals to X. Even when X desires\nanonymous sex, X desires “the pleasure of anonymous\nsex” (Morgan 2003b). On the intentional view, sexual desire is\nno mere appetite but thoroughly infused with meaning. \nAlthough the intentional view need not insist on the conceptual\nrequirement of another person, its most common instantiation is the\nidea that sexual desire is interpersonal—that the agent’s\nsexual desire always seeks fulfillment with another person. Being a\nnormal human being means having interpersonal attitudes, and sexual\ndesire is no exception; it must have a proper direction and involve\nthe “marshalling and directing of animal urges toward an\ninterpersonal aim, and an interpersonal fulfillment” (Scruton\n1986: 289). On one version, sexual desire involves multiple levels of\nawareness: X desires Y, desires that Y desire\nX, desires to be aroused by Y’s desire of\nX, and so on (Nagel 1969). On another version, sexual desire\nshould be directed to love (Scruton 1986: 339; cf. Giles 2008: ch. 3).\nBoth these variations might raise doubts, however, because they layer\na normative view of sexual desire, dictating its aim (e.g., towards\nlove), atop a descriptive one as an interpersonal attitude, whereas\nthe trick is to articulate a normatively neutral interpersonal view.\nOther such views burden sexual desire with too much inter-personality\n(Russon 2017). \nIs the pleasure view of sexual desire committed to understanding\nsexual desire as mere appetite? Perhaps not. For example, if X\nwants to masturbate, X is not being led by blind instinct like\na cat in heat; X can be thinking, “I look forward to\nenjoying the sensations of rubbing my clitoris with my favorite\nvibrator as I fantasize about having sex with my neighbor. ” In\nother words, “sexual desire can be focused or selective at the\nsame time as being physical” (Goldman 1977: 279). \nThe intentional view is plausible in that sexual desire can be quite\ncomplex and that its complexity is not captured well (or at all) by\nthe pleasure view, given that human mentality infuses our most basic\nurges and appetites. But whether the intentional view is at odds with\nthe pleasure view depends on our goals. If the latter is meant to\ncapture the “essence” of the phenomenon, the two are\ncompatible with each other; if our goal is a detailed description of\nthe depth, complexity, and variety of the phenomenon, the pleasure\nview falls short. Given that definitions are not usually meant to\nconvey the complexity of what they define, we should not expect a\ndefinition of sexual desire to be a full-blown theory sexual desire,\nwhile agreeing that it is a complex phenomenon. \nThis does not mean that the pleasure view of sexual desire is correct,\nonly that its aim or strategy need not be misguided. Indeed, depending\non how it is stated it might be wrong. For example, if the pleasure\nview conceptually ties sexual desire to sexual pleasure obtained\nthrough the touch of another person, it would be dualistic\nand might implausibly render many sexual desires as nonsexual, such as\nsome masturbatory desires, voyeurism, and exhibitionism. Furthermore,\nthe touch of another person’s body implies that\nzoophiliac desires are nonsexual. Necrophiliac desires would also be\nnonsexual if “person” refers to a living person. A\nnon-dualistic definition—“for bodily pleasures,\nperiod”—avoids such implications (Soble 1991 and later\neditions of the essay, the last being 2013a; Halwani 2018b: ch.\n5). \nEven a non-dualistic pleasure view might face difficulties stemming\nfrom understanding desire in terms of what it seeks (sexual\npleasure). One problem is the difficulty of defining “sexual\npleasure” (see below), which this view needs to do to be\ncomplete. But there might be additional problems. First, not all\nsexual desires are for sexual pleasure: a couple might have sex to\nhave a baby, even though the act is pleasurable (Jacobsen 2017: 33;\nsee also 1993). Second, our sexual partners would in principle be\ndispensable if there are other ways to attain the pleasure. This\nobjection is not moral—that we use our sexual partners as mere\ninstruments—but ontological: sexual pleasure cannot be the only\nor common goal to all sexual desires otherwise the agent would be\nindifferent between the available ways of attaining sexual pleasure.\nSince this is not true, sexual desire is not solely for sexual\npleasure (Jacobsen 2017: 33). \nGiven that the pleasure view understands sexual desire in terms of an\nobject (pleasure), we can describe it as “object-based”.\nAn alternative is the “feature-based” approach, which\ndefines “sexual desire” in terms of “sexual\narousal” (Jacobsen 2017). Sexual arousal is a state we find\nourselves in—it is basically the state of being turned on or\nhorny, manifested in erections, lubricated vaginas, flushed faces, and\n“tingling earlobes” (Jacobsen 2017: 35; cf. Shaffer 1978).\nBecause this state is enjoyable, we often induce it in ourselves: we\nthink about sex in order to be sexually aroused (Jacobsen\n2017: 34–35). “Sexual desire” is then  \na subject’s desire for something—some activity, person, or\nobject—in virtue of the effect that it is expected to have on\nthe subject’s own states of sexual arousal. (Jacobsen 2017: 36)\n \nThis is a feature-based account in that at point t in time, I\ndesire someone in virtue of, say, the pleasure that his voice brings\nme, but at point t+1 I desire him in virtue of the sexual\npleasure his body brings me. This allows the feature-based view to\navoid being confined to the false binary of my desire for someone\nbeing either sexual or not, a problem that the object-based approach\nmight face. \nThe feature-based view, however, might pass the buck: either\n“sexual arousal” means what we usually mean by\n“sexual desire” (the examples of sexual\narousal—erections, lubricated vaginas—might serve equally\nwell as examples of sexual desire), or it does not. If the former, we\nwould still need a definition of “sexual arousal”, much\nlike we needed a definition of “sexual desire”. If the\nlatter, we would need an account of what “sexual arousal”\nis, because now it does not mean what we thought it meant: if it is\nnot the same as sexual desire, what exactly is it? Referring back to\nerections and lubricated vaginas will not do, because we may ask,\n“Why aren’t they states of sexual desire?”\nSo defining “sexual desire” in terms of sexual arousal\nmight be convincing only if we can understand “sexual\narousal” independently of “sexual desire” (Halwani\n2018b: 170–171). \nThe objections to the object-based views merit scrutiny. First, even\nif the goal of sexual desire is sexual pleasure, unless we assume that\nsexual pleasure is uniform across different contexts (an assumption\nwith which the feature-based view saddles the object-based one), one\nmight not be indifferent to how the pleasure is produced. Second,\nalthough the couple in the example want to have sex from procreative\nmotives, this might not show that their sexual desire (if it\nexists in this case) is not for pleasure. People can have sex from\nnonsexual motives (most prostitutes), but once we postulate the motive\nof sexual desire, the motive of pleasure is present. People’s\nintentions for nonsexual goals in a sex act cannot wave away the\ndesire for pleasure; sexual desire has an independence that cannot be\n(metaphysically) wiped away by intentions or nonsexual motives (see\nDent 1984: ch. 2; see also Hamilton 2001: ch. 9; Webber 2009). \nThis independence lends support to pessimist views of sexual desire.\nAlthough pessimism and optimism have moral implications – some\nof which are addressed below – they are based in the nature of\nsexual desire. Pessimism considers sexual desire morally dangerous and\nthreatening to our rationality (including Christian philosophers such\nas Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, Plato, Kant, and Schopenhauer [1859:\nch. 44], and, among contemporary philosophers of sex Alan Soble, whose\nviews in “Sexual Use” [2013b; 2017b] imply with some\ncertainty that he is also a pessimist). Pessimism is opposed by\noptimism, which views sexual desire as generally benign and as\nbringing people together (it commands a large majority of the\nphilosophers of sex, including Bertrand Russell 1929: passim;\nIrving Singer 2001: passim; and Martha Nussbaum 1995, 1998),\nthough it recognizes that it can be morally problematic (Morgan\n2003a). The issue, then, between the pessimists and the optimists\nconcerns not whether sexual desire can be morally\nproblematic, but whether it is so by its nature (Soble, with Halwani\n2017: 5–8). \nSexual pessimism can be deep. One version is that sexual desire is for\nanother’s body “as an organic totality in situation with\nconsciousness at the horizon” (Sartre 1943 [ 1956: 502]). Sexual\ndesire aims to capture a person in their entirety through their body.\nTo do so, the agent must also make him or herself pure flesh by\nallowing sexual desire to “clog” his or her consciousness\n(Sartre 1943 [1956: 504]). Thus, “I make myself flesh in the\npresence of the Other in order to appropriate the Other’s\nflesh” (Sartre 1943 [1956: 506]). Another version of deep\npessimism considers sexual desire to be for the sexual parts or body\nof another person, not the person’s “work and\nservices” (Kant 1930 [1963: 163]; see also 1797:\n6:424–6:427; we discuss below the moral implications of this\nview). Sexual desire sets aside another’s humanity and targets\ntheir flesh. This does not mean that in desiring Y, X\nwould be as happy with Y’s corpse or with Y\nunconscious as with Y alive (as Shrage and Stewart [2015: 6]\nclaim); for X, Y-dead is not at all equally preferable\nto Y-alive. It also does not mean that during sex X\ntreats Y as an object with no desires or interests of\nY’s own. Instead, X treats those interests as\nmerely instrumental to the satisfaction of X’s sexual\ndesires (Halwani 2018b: ch. 8, Soble 2013b, 2017b; see also Herman\n1993; O’Neill 1985; Papadaki 2007). A phenomenology of sexual\ndesire seems to support the above views, according to which in\nsexually desiring Y, X is attracted to the bodily,\nphysical attributes of Y. \nSexual optimism claims that although sexual desire can be morally\ndangerous, it need not be and is usually not. They agree that its\nfocus is on the body but do not see this as a problem. Sex intimately\nand pleasurably brings two (or more) people together. It is a force\nfor good, establishing trust and strengthening human bonds. Unlike\nappetites,  sexual interest … [is] … an interpersonal\nsensitivity, one that enables us to delight in the mind and character\nof other persons as well as in their flesh… [S]ex may be seen\nas an instinctual agency by which persons respond to one\nanotherthrough their bodies. (Singer 1984: 382; see also\nGoldman 1977: 282–283; Russell 1929 [1970: passim]) For the optimist, Soble notes, “Sexual pleasure is\n… a valuable thing in its own right, something to be cherished and\npromoted because it has intrinsic and not merely instrumental\nvalue” (Soble, with Halwani 2017: 8). \nIt is difficult to define “sexual act” or “sexual\nactivity.” Various proposed criteria face difficulties (Soble\n2006a). This is especially so when closely related concepts (e.g.,\n“having sex”) do not have the same extension. In ordinary\nlanguage use, and according to some studies, people distinguish\nbetween having sex and sexual activity; they count many activities as\nsexual but not as having sex, such as solo masturbation, cyber-sex,\nand even oral sex (Soble 2006a: 15–16). Solo masturbation counts as\nsexual activity and as a sexual act, but not as having sex. There are\na few criteria to define “sexual activity” (Soble 2006a).\nOne criterion is reproduction: for an activity to be sexual it has to\nbe or aim at being reproductive. This faces obvious counter-examples,\nsuch as same-sex sexual activities and heterosexual oral and anal sex\n(Soble 2006a: 18–19). Another criterion is bodily contact: sexual\nactivities are those that involve contact with sexual body parts\n(though we need to figure out what these are). This fails as a\nsufficient condition (doctors sometimes have to touch patients’\ngenitals) and as a necessary one (achieving orgasm during a phone-sex\nchat) (Soble 2006a: 19–20).  \nSexual pleasure is a third criterion: “Those activities …\nare sexual … which give rise to sexual pleasure” (Gray\n1978: 191–192). But the production of sexual pleasure is not necessary\nbecause many acts do not produce such pleasure; and this criterion\nconceptually rules out non-pleasurable sex (Soble 2006a: 21–22). It\nmight also not be sufficient: a man might see someone on the street\nand feel a twinge of sexual pleasure (Soble 1996: 130). The presence\nof sexual pleasure in this case does not suffice for the man’s\nexperience to be sexual activity (perhaps if the man continues to look\nthe experience becomes a sexual activity because of his intention to\nkeep looking; Soble 1996: 130). \nAnother criterion is intention, though we need to figure out what the\nintention is for. One reasonable candidate is “the intention to\nproduce sexual pleasure in oneself or in another”. But this is\nnot necessary: two people who have sexual intercourse to procreate\nengage in a sexual act. The experience, if any, of sexual pleasure is\na by-product of the action (Soble 1996: 132). This criterion\nis also not sufficient. Suppose that X intends to produce\nsexual pleasure in Y by “whistling\n‘Dixie’,” but what X does is not a sexual act\n(Soble 2006a: 22).  \nAnother criterion for defining “sexual activity” is sexual\ndesire:  \nsexual desire is desire for contact with another person’s body\nand for the pleasure which such contact produces; sexual activity is\nactivity which tends to fulfill such desire of the agent. (Goldman\n1977: 268)  \nA “sexual act” (or “activity”, in\nGoldman’s terms) is activity “which tends to\nfulfill” sexual desire. \nThe definition sounds right: what else is a sexual act if not\none that satisfies or “tends to” satisfy sexual desire?\nBut it faces counter-examples. A prostitute performing fellatio on a\nman does it (typically) not to satisfy or fulfill her sexual desire,\nbut to make money. Nor does the act tend to fulfill her desire, for\nshe might have none to be fulfilled. Thus satisfying sexual desire is\nnot necessary for an activity to be sexual. Whether it is sufficient\ndepends on what we mean by “satisfaction” or\n“fulfillment”. If it means “the desire is no longer\nfelt for the time being” or “the desire is gone”,\nsatisfying sexual desire would not be sufficient. Taking a\ncold shower, a powerful sleeping pill, or even just focusing on\nsomething else might get rid of the sexual desire, yet these\nactivities are not sexual. If “satisfying sexual desire”\nmeans, “the desire achieves its goal” (which is sexual\nfulfillment), satisfying sexual desire by a particular activity\nwould be sufficient for that activity to be sexual, but the\ndefinition becomes circular. The criterion of sexual desire, then,\ndoes not succeed in defining “sexual act”. \nBy the above criteria, a definition of “sexual activity”\nis hard to find. One crucial reason might be that what we commonly\nthink is a sexual act does not depend on one criterion: behavior,\nintentions, contact with body parts, etc., play a role depending on\nthe context. Another reason might be that there are many concepts\nclosely related to each other that nonetheless commonly mean different\nthings. “To have sex” or “to engage in sex”\nalmost always refer to sexual activity with at least one more person,\nwhereas “engaging in a sexual activity)” and “having\na sexual experience” do not have this reference, and they are\nnot common expressions. Thus, defining these concepts is tricky if we\nwant the definitions to agree with common linguistic usage, or if we\nrely on such usage to formulate these definitions. More worrisome, if\nwe need to define these concepts for help with practical, moral, and\nlegal issues, the rift between them and common language should give us\npause. \n“Pleasure” refers to various phenomena: (a) physical\nsensations, with specific bodily locations (e.g., scratching an itch);\n(b) enjoyment, as when one takes pleasure in solving a jigsaw puzzle\nor lying under the sun (enjoyment does not have a specific bodily\nlocation, though the same phenomenon can be experienced as sensation\nand as enjoyment (e.g., lying under the sun); a “pure”\nfeeling that is felt all over but has no specific bodily location, and\nthat need not be focused on a particular activity, such as being\nelated (Goldman 2016: 88); and (d) an attitude, to be “pleased\nat something”; the belief that what one is pleased at is good\n(Goldman 2016: 83–90).  \nWe thus have four types of pleasure: pleasure-as-sensation,\npleasure-as-enjoyment, pleasure-as-feeling, and\npleasure-as-pro-attitude. All four concepts can be relevant to sex,\nbut it is the first two that are important, because each can be a type\nof sexual pleasure, whereas the third is typically consequent to\nsexual activity and the fourth is about sex. (a) The pleasure of\norgasm is an obvious example of the first, and (b) enjoying sexual\nactivity is a usual experience that people undergo. (c) One can\nexperience elation because of having had great sex, and (d) one can\nfeel pleased at that. \nMoreover, one or more parties to the act might experience\npleasure-as-sensation, yet not enjoy the activity itself. One can\nexperience the pleasurable sensations of sex and enjoy the act, yet\nfeel repulsion later. We can thus see how each pleasure has its\nopposite: one can feel painful sensations during a sexual act (e.g.,\nat being anally penetrated), one can endure a sexual act (not enjoy\nit), and one can feel nausea at what one has done sexually. \nAlthough orgasm does not exhaust the pleasures of sex, there is\nsomething to the idea that the pleasure of orgasm is unique. As a\nsensation, it is unique in the way it feels and in its intensity,\nthough this feeling might differ between men and women, especially\nsince women seem to experience various types of orgasm (Komisaruk et\nal. 2006: ch. 7; Meston et al. 2004: 174–176; but see Wallen and Lloyd\n2011: 780–783). Moreover, it contrasts with other sensation-pleasures\nin its physiological aspects and ability to be produced through\ngenital stimulation. For example, the sensation of having one’s\near licked is not as such a pleasure and depends on who one\nthinks is licking it. But the sensation of orgasm is not like this,\nwhich makes orgasm a pleasure that cuts across social layers, a bodily\nsensation unmediated by social meanings or concepts; “the trait\nof female orgasm [is] a physiological trait or reflex, not a social\ntrait” (Lloyd 2005: 48). Of course its frequency, significance,\nand meaning vary socially, culturally, and contextually (Blair et al.\n2017; Janssen 2007; Mah and Binik 2002). This feature of orgasm might\nexplain how we can speak of sexual desire across times and cultures as\na unified phenomenon, even though sexual desires and bodily sensations\nare socially and linguistically mediated. \nIf the pleasure of orgasm is unique, why do people usually prefer sex\nwith someone else to masturbating, given that masturbating produces\norgasms, often more intense than partnered sex? This shows that orgasm\nis not the only pleasure sought in sexual activity, not that its\npleasure is not unique. Touching, smelling, kissing, and licking, for\nexample, are other goals of sexual desire (Soble 1996: 85–86).\nWe can even claim that people prefer the pleasure of orgasm\nthrough these other goals. \nThe discussion of sexual pleasure is important in itself and for\ndefining “sexual desire” and “sexual\nactivity”:  \nSexual activity can … be defined as activity that tends to\nfulfill sexual desire, while sexual desire is sufficiently defined as\nthe desire for certain bodily pleasures, period. (Primoratz 1999: 46)\n \n“Sexual activity” is ultimately defined in terms of\n“sexual pleasure” via that of “sexual desire”.\nBut which bodily pleasures? One answer is pleasure-as-sensation: those\n“experienced in the sexual parts of the body, i.e., the genitals\nand other parts that differentiate the sexes” (Primoratz 1999:\n46). More generally, and accounting for sexual pleasures not located\nin the genitals, sexual pleasure  \nis the sort of bodily pleasure experienced in the sexual parts of the\nbody, or at least related to those parts in that if it is associated\nwith arousal, the arousal occurs in those parts. (Primoratz 1999: 46)\n \nTo distinguish a sexual from a nonsexual kiss, we ask which of the two\nis associated with arousal, and we understand the notion of arousal as\nessentially linked to the sexual body parts. \nBecause the above view relies solely on sexual pleasure-as-sensation,\nit would have to understand the other two types ultimately in terms of\npleasure-as-sensation. That is, what makes sexual\npleasure-as-enjoyment sexual is its connection to arousal.\nThis implies that “sensory pleasure is more fundamental when it\ncomes to sex” (Goldman 2016: 95). Although in nonsexual contexts\nwe do not pursue activities because of their sensual pleasures, we\npursue sex for sexual pleasure-as-sensation. \nIn most activities, the pleasure and the activity are\nintertwined—we do not watch a movie and then feel the pleasure.\nInstead, we enjoy the movie as we watch it. The pleasures here are\npleasures-as-enjoyment. Things are different with sex because of\npleasure-as-sensation, specifically, orgasm. Sexual\npleasure-as-enjoyment supervenes on sexual pleasure-as-sensation, and\nit often culminates in orgasm, a result that comes at the end of the\nactivity (though the orgasm as an end differs between men and women).\nWe can then see why some prominent philosophers have considered\ntemperance and intemperance to be about bodily appetites satisfied\nespecially through touch (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics\n1118a–1118b). \nMoreover, sexual pleasure seems to be the primary motive for sexual\nactivity: although sexual activity has other goals (Meston and Buss\n2007), few people would have sex just to exercise, to boost\ntheir self-image, or for revenge, and although many people would have\nsex just to procreate, procreation would plummet were sex to not be\nenjoyable. It then seems that sexual pleasure provides a basic motive\nfor sexual activity that underlies multiple other motives. \nSexual pleasures-as-enjoyment and as-feeling might thus be parasitic\non sexual pleasures-as-sensations. The butterflies one feels in\none’s stomach at the prospect of sex exist because of the\nexpectation of sensual pleasure, and so does enjoying a sexual act.\nSexual pleasure, especially as-sensation, stands out as the main\nmotivation for having sex, and its concept supplies us with a good way\nof defining “sexual activity” and “sexual\ndesire”. \nIt is a contentious question in the philosophy of sex of how the\ntriumvirate concepts of “sexual desire”, “sexual\nactivity”, and “sexual pleasure” are ordered when it\ncomes to their conceptual analysis. Which concept is prior? (Jacobsen\n2006). \nSexual orientation is commonly understood as a person’s standing\nsexual preference for men, women, or both. It is a basic preference,\nunlike, say, the preference for blondness or buttock size. It is also\nan organizing preference: other sexual preferences are built upon it\n(Stein 1999: ch. 2). A foot fetishist is either gay, straight or\nbisexual, before he is a foot fetishist, though it is an empirical\nquestion whether there can be sexual orientations for body parts (or\nobjects) regardless of the gender or sex of the person’s body\npart (Stein 1999: ch. 2; Wilkerson 2013). \nMere sexual preferences vary tremendously, targeting people, objects,\nactivities, and sexual positions, probably because they are a function\nof the person’s individual history and the available social and\ncultural options (on this variety, see Love 1992). Given their\nvariety, it is inevitable that some preferences are considered\nperverted (e.g., coprophilia), some immoral (e.g., pedophilia), and\nsome both. Yet with others it is not so obvious, such as sexual\npreferences for members of particular races or ethnic groups. Perhaps\nX’s preference for Asian women is innocent, on a par with\nthe preference for tall people. But it might also indicate an ethical\nfault if, say, racially ugly stereotypes inform it (Halwani 2017b;\nZheng 2016). \nReturning to sexual orientation, its popular conception relies on\ndubious assumptions (Corvino 2006a; Dembroff 2017). (1) It assumes\nthree basic orientations: homosexual, heterosexual, and bisexual. (2)\nIt includes the gender or sex of the person who has the orientation as\nan essential element of the orientation; X’s being gay\nmeans that X has the same sex/gender as the target of the\norientation. (3) It is ambiguous between sex and gender: is a straight\nman attracted to the gender or the sex of women? (The same question\narises regarding the person with the orientation.) (4) It assumes a\nbinary of gender/sex for both parties, excluding people who exist\noutside the binary. (5) It is ambiguous between sexual and emotional\nattraction: if a man is emotionally attracted to other men, does that\nmean that he is gay or something else? (6) It is silent on what counts\nas the basic components of the orientation: is it behavior, desires,\nor fantasies? Finally, (7) it assumes the cross-temporal and\ncross-cultural existence of the three sexual orientations: there were\ngay men and gay women in 15th century Russia just as there\nwere in 21st century North America, albeit with adjustment\nfor cultural variances. \n(1) There is no good reason to believe that there are only three\nsexual orientations. Many men are attracted to people with female\nfeatures from the waist up but male features from the waist down (a\npenis). What is their orientation? Many men are also attracted to both\nyoung boys and women—this is true of many cultures around the\nworld, past and present. Are they all bisexuals? It is also possible\nthat some men are attracted to young people, both girls and boys. Is\nthere a sexual orientation, then, for young people? And zoophilia\nthreatens to expand the number of sexual orientations with no limit:\ngenuine zoophiles—people who have long-standing desires to have\nsex with nonhuman animals—will have as many sexual orientations\nas there are different types of animals to which they are attracted\n(Wilkerson 2013). \n(2) It is unclear why the gender/sex of the person with the\norientation should be a component of the conception of sexual\norientation. Under the poplar conception, if a formerly straight man\nis currently a woman (after transitioning), they would now be a\nlesbian (assuming that their sexual desires for women does not\nchange). But if we omit the person’s own gender from the\nconception, the person’s sexual orientation remains the same.\nPerhaps this would be politically and morally better (Dembroff\n2017). \n(3) The lack of distinction between sex and gender makes it hard to\nclassify cases such as this: X is attracted to Y who is\nanatomically male (sex) but who presents herself as a woman (gender).\nAssume that X’s own gender and sex are male. Then,\nwhether we claim that X is gay or is straight, we face\nobstacles: if X gay, X would not be attracted to someone\nwho appears as a woman. If X straight, X would not be\nattracted to someone who is anatomically male. The popular concept of\norientation leaves such cases unclassified (Corvino 2006a; Wilkerson\n2013). \n(4) Connected to the previous point is that the popular understanding\nof sexual orientation assumes a binary conception of sex/gender,\nalbeit one that can include trans people. A straight woman is a woman,\ncis or trans, who is attracted to men (cis or trans). Thus, there is\nno room for people who are gender fluid or whose gender or sex\nidentification exists outside the binary (Dembroff 2017). \n(5) Both the American Psychological Association and the Human Rights\nCampaign understand “sexual orientation” as including\nemotional attraction. The former’s definition states,  \nSexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional,\nromantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes.\n(American Psychological Association, Introduction to “Sexual\nOrientation and Homosexuality”, Other Internet Resources)  \nThus, the APA believes that a man would be straight were he to be\nemotionally (even if neither romantically nor sexually) attracted to a\nwoman. Yet it is possible that he is nonetheless sexually attracted to\nmen, a result that leads to conceptual trouble. Perhaps keeping the\nconception of sexual orientation limited to sexual attraction\nso as to avoid such muddles is better (though adding romantic\nattractions is plausible, given that they include a sexual dimension)\n(Dembroff 2017). \n(6) The popular conception of sexual orientation is not so crude as to\nrely solely on behavior, but it is silent on what we should rely.\nDesires and fantasies are obvious candidates. But occurrent desires\nare not a good guide to sexual orientation: a shepherd can sexually\ndesire sex with a sheep, but he need not be a zoophile, even were his\ndesire for it to recur. David—a straight guy—might desire\noral sex from another man (Tom) or other men. Recourse to\n“enduring desires”, as in the APA’s definition,\nmight not do the trick if the conditions under which David desires\noral sex from other men recur. Other information, such as\ncounter-factual information as to what the person would do under\nsuch-and-such conditions (e.g., Stein’s “ideal\nconditions”; 1999: ch. 2), is needed—if David prefers a\nwoman’s mouth under ideal conditions, then he is straight. But\nstating these conditions is tough. What if David prefers the way that\nTom performs oral sex? David might, under some conditions, still opt\nfor Tom (Corvino 2006a; cf. Díaz-León, forthcoming). \nPerhaps fantasies are a better guide if we have a good way of\ndistinguishing between fantasies that indicate the person’s\nsexual orientation and those that don’t (after all,\nDavid’s desire for Tom is a fantasy of sorts; Storms 1980). This\nmight push us to ideal conditions again, to distinguish between\nsomeone’s real and “fake” fantasies. Or we might\nrely on initial sexual impulses: what sexually catches the eye of\nsomeone, without much thought: David does desire Tom’s oral\nskills, but what captures David’s sexual eye are women, not\nmen. \n(7) Philosophers and historians of sex are roughly divided into social\nconstructionists and essentialists. Weak social constructionism claims\nthat the concepts of “homosexuality”,\n“heterosexuality”, “natural sexuality”, and\nsimilar concepts are limited to a specific time period and\ngeographical region. This version is weak because it is only concerned\nwith how sexuality is conceptualized: there might have been\nhomosexuals in ancient Greece, but the ancient Greeks did not think\nabout them using the concept “homosexual”. Strong social\nconstructionism—more in line with Michel Foucault’s views\n(1976)—claims that the very existence of homosexual and\nheterosexual orientations is geographically and temporally limited;\nour concepts of “homosexual” and\n“heterosexual” do not refer to anything when used to refer\nto other times and regions. Essentialists claim that homosexuals,\nheterosexuals, and bisexuals have existed in various times and\ncultures (see Card 1995: ch. 3; Corvino 1997: pt. III; Corvino 2006b;\nDe Cecco 1981; Mohr 1992: ch. 7; Stein 1992, 1999: ch. 4; Wilkerson\n2013). \nEssentialism does not appear to be correct. It has difficulty\naccounting for the historical and cultural evidence: Were all the\nancient Athenians who had sex with boys and women bisexuals? Possibly,\nbut then why, in such social configurations, do we find a\npreponderance of bisexual men? If they were not all bisexuals, what\nwere they? Neither “homosexual” nor\n“heterosexual” is adequate. Perhaps then such men had an\naltogether different sexual orientation. Related to this, essentialism\nhas to be universally true for it to be true at all, for if it\nexcludes some cultures and times, it concedes the truth of social\nconstructionism. But if true of every single culture, it would be a\nvery strong thesis, and the need for evidence becomes more urgent.\nPerhaps, then, some version of social constructionism is true. Our\nsexual desires are biologically rigid enough to target mostly members\nof our species, but not so rigid as to reflect only our three basic\nsexual orientations, though social constructionism would have to\nproperly accommodate evolutionary biology’s\n“designing” us for procreation (Halperin 1990: ch.1). \nThe concept of “identity” is a philosophical minefield:\nidentity can be descriptive or normative; public or personal; with\nexplanatory power or inert. The distinction between first person and\nthird person attributions of identity helps us see this. When Amy\nasserts that she is gay, she could be describing herself (informing\nsomeone of who she is); she could be asserting a political or cultural\nposition, especially if the identity in question is threatened by the\npowers that be (“I am gay”, uttered as a way of resisting\noppression); or she could be making sense of herself, either to\nherself or to others: “I am gay” helps Amy see herself or\nothers see her more coherently. Third parties can make the same\nassertion about Amy in any of these ways. \nThe second and third ways are interesting because they allow choice\nwith respect to the identity, and disagreement about its assertion.\nAmy can choose to adopt, be indifferent to, or reject the identity of\nbeing gay, and she can choose to use it (or not) to make sense of\nherself. She might fail to identify with her homosexuality because it\nis not important to her, because she does not find gay cultural ways\nappealing, because she does not think highly of gays, because she is\nashamed, because she is religious, etc. This allows for healthy\ndisagreements with Amy’s decisions. And Marcia, a straight\nwoman, might be wrong to assert her straight identity in a climate in\nwhich gay people are oppressed, much like a person might be wrong to\nassert his white identity in a racist society, also allowing for\ndisagreements with her (see Alcoff 2006, esp. pt. I; Appiah 2005: ch.\n3; Halwani 2006; Lance & Tanesini 2000; Ozturk 2017; Wilkerson\n2007). \n“Good sex” and “bad sex” can refer to moral,\npleasurable, aesthetic, practical, legal, and, especially with sex,\nnaturalness (Soble 2008: 85–87; Soble, with Halwani 2017: 8–16).\nIt is unclear what aesthetic sex is (this is in need of philosophical\nexploration), but applying some common aesthetic concepts, such as\n“unity”, “coherence”, and\n“completeness”—concepts used in defining the\naesthetic experience (Beardsley 1982: chs. 1, 5, 16; cf. Levine 2006;\nSinger 2001: ch. 5)—might be useful: a sexual act can be\ncoherent, unified, and fulfills the parties’ expectations (this\nis Beardsley’s view of completeness; 1982: 85–86). Assuming\nthese three are the only components of aesthetic experiences, sexual\nactivity can provide an aesthetic experience to its participants.\nOther concepts, such as “beauty” and its opposites (e.g.,\n“dullness”, “monotony”, “the\ndisgusting”, “the insipid”) can also be relevant,\nthough whether they retain their aesthetic sense when applied to sex\nis the question. This last point is as true, if not more, of\n“pleasure”: Is there such a thing as aesthetic pleasure,\nand can it be a property of sexual acts? \nSex can also be practically or pragmatically good or bad: a\n“sexting” politician can ruin his career, unprotected anal\nsex risks contracting HIV, sex without contraception risks pregnancy\n(if undesired), and public sex risks arrest. Practically good sex does\nnot lead to bad results or has positive outcomes: a sense of\nrejuvenation, loss of calories, or a wanted pregnancy. We do not\ndiscuss aesthetic, practical, and legal considerations, though many\nissues that go under them are also moral (e.g., pregnancy and\nSTDs). \n“Good sex” most obviously refers to pleasurable sex. A sex\nact can be good or bad depending on the amount and intensity of the\npleasure or pain it provides (Vannoy 1980: ch. 3), though pain in sex\ncan contribute to its pleasure (in BDSM sex, e.g.). We must keep in\nmind the different senses of “pleasure” that can come into\nplay, though pleasure-as-sensation and pleasure-as-enjoyment are\ncrucial because they are often the reason people pursue sexual\nactivity. Imagine the sexual experience of a woman forced into\nmarrying someone she finds undesirable, even revolting. Such negative\nemotions provide the crucial reason why consent is necessary. Note\nalso how negative evaluations border on the moral: a disgusting sexual\nexperience is both painful and, perhaps because of this, leaves a bad\nmoral taste in one’s mouth. \nSexual activity is either morally permissible or impermissible. There\nis consensus among philosophers that informed and voluntary consent is\nnecessary for the moral permissibility of sex though there are\ndissenters, and consent’s sufficiency is debatable (see\nbelow). \nWe usually think of sexual activity as neither obligatory nor\nsupererogatory, but as permissible in that (genuine) consent is\nsufficient. Yet there are interesting questions. (1) Are there sexual\nacts that are good in some more positive sense? (2) Are there sexual\nobligations—moral obligations to engage in sexual activity? and\n(3) Are there sexual supererogatory actions? \nThe answer to (1) is “Yes,” and the virtues help us see\nthis: sexual activity can be caring, courageous, kind, generous,\ncompassionate, or fair. Each is compatible with the activity being\nmerely for the sake of sexual pleasure (not connected to love or other\npositive emotions), and each is done from a motive that is additional\nto, or in place of, that of sexual desire, and neither possibility\nsubtracts from the goodness of the act. Actually, acting from sexual\ndesire might diminish its goodness if sexual desire objectifies (see\nbelow). Thus, sexual activity can be morally evaluated as good beyond\npermissibility because of participant consent. Further questions\nconcern sexual desire’s connections to the virtues and the vices\n(especially temperance and intemperance) and how a virtuous (and\nvicious) agent relates to sex, including how they sexually act and\nwhat motivates such actions (Halwani 2003: ch. 3, 2018a, 2018b: ch. 7;\nMorgan 2003a). \n(2) Clear cases of sexual obligations exist in relationships (though\nthe obligations are likely imperfect) because sexual activity is an\nexpected and crucial aspect of (especially monogamous) relationships.\nNote that ordinarily threatening harm to someone unless they have sex\nis morally wrong, but threats to end a relationship unless the other\nparty has sex (“Have sex with me or I will break up with\nyou”) are not obviously wrong, further indicating that sexual\nobligations exist (Anderson 2013; Soble 2017a; Wertheimer 2003: ch.\n12). \nThe difficult question is whether there are sexual obligations outside\nsuch relationships. If having sex is a basic need, perhaps plausible\ncases involve a health caretaker alleviating the sexual needs of a\npatient. Even if not a duty, such actions might be classified as\nsupererogatory (Soble 2017a: 453–54; see below). These cases are\nplausible only if sexual needs are basic and if certain professionals\nhave duties to meet them. One can argue that although under the usual\nconception of “health care professional” (e.g., a nurse)\nthere are no such duties, society should create a category of such\nprofessionals to meet these needs—if they are indeed basic. \nStill, sexual obligations might exist outside professional roles,\nbased in general duties of benevolence—attending to\nsomeone’s sexual needs would be similar to attending to\nsomeone’s hunger (Soble 2017a: 454–55). But who is to\nfulfill these obligations? What would their fulfillment amount to (is\nmasturbating the beneficiary of the duty enough)? Do the gender and\nsexual orientation of the parties matter? These are tough questions,\nbut they have their parallels in nonsexual domains—Who has to\nfulfill the obligation to feed the starving? Is a plate of boiled rice\nenough or more sophisticated dishes are required? \nBut they might not be exactly parallel. The extent to which\nsomeone’s sexual needs are properly met does somewhat depend on\ntheir sexual desires and preferences: a straight man’s needs\nmight not be met by a gay one, and straight women meeting men’s\nsexual needs is troubling given sexism and gender-based oppression.\nMoreover, if X’s sexual need cannot be alleviated by\nX masturbating, how the needs are to be met is a pressing\nquestion, and so is how the depth of a sexual need is determined to\nsee whether it gives rise to an obligation.  \nEven if such sexual obligations do not exist, obligations to ourselves\nto develop or dampen certain sexual preferences might, assuming there\nare general moral obligations to ourselves. Pedophiles, for example,\nmight have an obligation to change their preferences, not merely to\nrefrain from acting on them. Other examples include obligations to\nchange one’s preferences (or their lack) for, say, members of a\nparticular race, ethnic group, age group, body type, etc. These are\nmore controversial, however, because it is not clear that such\npreferences are bad to begin with (Halwani 2017b; Zheng 2016), and\nsome might not be under our control as others are (preference for skin\ncolor vs. age group). \n(3) A supererogatory action is permissible but not obligatory, is\nintended to benefit the recipient, involves, or probably involves,\n“a significant reduction in the interests or good of the agent,\n[o]r the act is risky, significantly, not trivially”, and is\nsuch that the agent knows or truly believes this in advance (Soble\n2017a: 452; the agent’s belief has to be true; falsely\nbelieving that the act is risky might disqualify the act from being\nsupererogatory). There can easily be permissible, non-obligatory\nsexual actions intended to benefit the recipient. So everything hinges\non the criterion of serious risk to the agent. \nThe inclusion of risk is controversial, because one can imagine\nnon-obligatory actions that greatly benefit another without risk to\nthe agent (the examples of supererogation given in Heyd 2015 include\nboth risk and non-risk cases). But it is plausible to assume it\nbecause it explains why the agent, not only the act, is admirable, and\n(see below) without risk it is implausible to speak of supererogatory\nsexual acts. What are the risks to the agent in the case of sexual\nsupererogation? Risk of pregnancy is one, risk of contracting serious\n(or not so serious) diseases is another. But consider: X is\nattracted to and wants to have sex with Z, whom X meets\nin a bar. For some reason, having sex is a crucial need for Z,\nand X knows this. X also knows that were X to\nhave sex with Z, there’s a serious risk that Y,\nX’s partner, will find out and dissolve the relationship\nwith X, a relationship that X values. X\nnonetheless has sex with Z (and enjoys it). This satisfies the\nconditions for a supererogatory act, but it is doubtful that X\nperforms one. The presence of sexual desire and the prospect of sexual\npleasure lower the degree of the supererogation, if not entirely\nnullifying it. This is not parallel to other cases of supererogation,\nin which no additional motive to wanting to help someone exists. In\nX’s case, X intends to benefit Z but also\nto derive pleasure from the sexual act. This might affect its\nsupererogatory status. \nThus, risk to the agent might not be sufficient; perhaps the agent\nmust also lack the sexual desire for the action or find it\nundesirable. The degree of supererogation increases in direct\nproportion to that of undesirability. As awful as it sounds, this fits\nwith the type of cases that would come to mind in thinking of\nsupererogation: sex with the least physically desirable. But there is\nroom for subjectivity: a young gay man not attracted to other young\nmen would find sex with them undesirable, so having sex with one out\nof kindness would be supererogatory in his case. \nIs sexual activity like any other activity in that the same moral\nrules apply to it?  \n[N]o conduct otherwise immoral should be excused because it is sexual\nconduct, and nothing in sex is immoral unless condemned by rules which\napply elsewhere as well. (Goldman 1977: 280)  \nThis is true at a general level because the same general moral\nfeatures (e.g., harm) affect sexual acts. But it might be false at\nmore specific levels: sexual violation of the body by a penis\nor an object makes the violation distinct. This has to do with how one\nexperiences sexual bodily violations, thereby making sexual consent a\ncrucial moral aspect of sexual relations (Wertheimer 2003:\n107–112). Moreover, if Kant is right, the objectifying nature of\nsexual desire makes it unique. If virtue ethicists are right, actions\ncan be right and wrong because they are sexually temperate and\nintemperate: seducing the ex-boss’s husband is vengeful or\nintemperate, depending on the motive (Carr 2007; Halwani 2018a, 2018b;\nPiers 1999). The specialness of sex might be explained by sexual\ndesire’s rootedness in biology and its being directed at the\nbodies of other human beings (Dent 1984: ch. 2 and\npassim). \nConsent is crucial because (a) it transforms an otherwise wrong act\ninto a permissible one (though not necessarily to a good act); (b) in\nheterosexual sex, men and women might importantly differ when it comes\nto sex; and (c) sexual violation is typically experienced as very\nharmful (Wertheimer 2003: 119–121). \nThere is general consensus among philosophers that valid or genuine\nconsent (henceforth “consent”) by all the parties to a sex\nact is necessary and sufficient for the moral permissibility of the\nsex act (Archard 1998; Mappes 1987; Miller & Wertheimer 2010;\nPrimoratz 2001; Wertheimer 2003; but see Pateman 1988), though what\nvalid consent consists of is an intricate issue (to which Wertheimer\n2003 is dedicated). Yet the sufficiency of consent can be questioned.\nIf, for example, sexual desire by nature objectifies, as the Kantian\nview has it, then the consent of the parties is\ninsufficient—they consent to a wrong action (see below). \nAnother reason to reject consent’s sufficiency stems from some\nconceptions of what marital sex is. The theory of New Natural Law\nconsiders only marital sex—which it understands as referring to\nsex acts between married partners who do it from the specific\nmotive of the good of marriage (what this means, though, is\nunclear)—is morally permissible (even good). The main reasons\nare the theory’s view of marriage, which, following Thomas\nAquinas, is understood as a basic good, and the view of marital sexual\nacts as reproductive and unitive, as two-in-one flesh communions.\nThus, although consent to the sexual act is necessary, it is not\nsufficient: the sex has to be done from the motive of the good of\nmarriage (Finnis 1993; George 2003; George & Bradley 1995; Lee\n& George 1997). \nTwo prominent objections to the New Natural Law view are (1) that the\nview of marriage is both undefended and implausible: the connection\nbetween reproduction or biological two-in-one union and the morality\nof sex is unclear, and (2) that it is unclear why other goods (sexual\npleasure) are ruled out as basic (Koppelman 2008; see also Biggar\n& Black 2000). \nNew Natural Law is a version of any type of view that limits the\nmorality of sexual acts to specific domains. In addition to marriage,\nlove is another such domain. A view confining sex to love need not\ninsist also on marriage, on only two love partners, or that they be of\ndifferent sex/gender. It requires only the presence of love. Other\nversions require only affection or a mutually respectful relationship\n(Hampton 1999; Nussbaum 1995). On such views, consensual casual sex\nbetween two strangers is impermissible. \nBut why must such factors be present for the permissibility\nof sex? One prominent reason is that sex is somehow morally dangerous,\nso something is needed to minimize from or erode this danger. Sex\nmight make us treat our sexual partners as objects, and the power of\nsex might make us engage in sex with the wrong people, in the wrong\ncircumstances, etc. Love or a respectful relationship minimizes these\nrisks (Nussbaum 1995: 227–231). \nBut if sex is objectifying, love or a respectful relationship might\nnot prevent this objectification; lovers or partners to a relationship\nend up objectifying each other (Soble 2017b: 304–309). Moreover, if\nsex is so powerful or mind-numbing, being in a relationship might not\nmake this power any less effective: partners soon start eyeing people\noutside the relationship. The argument must assume that being in a\nrelationship turns off sexual desire for other people. This is\nimplausible, however, given that in long-term relationships\n“bedroom death” might eventually set in. There is also the\nthought that relationships do not escape the power of desire: people\noften have sex with each other prior to initiating a relationship. \nA second type of reason against the sufficiency of consent is harm.\nSetting aside harm to third parties, if sexual activity leads to harm\nto one or more of its parties, then consent is not sufficient. This\nview might be plausible especially when it comes to women, given that\nmany women engage in consensual sex but motivated by\nnonsexual desires, such as not wanting to put their partner in a foul\nmood. The harm is psychological, especially to their autonomy (West\n1995). This implies that prostitutes are harmed women because of their\nconsent to undesired sex, an implausible implication. However, even if\nspecific formulations of the view are implausible (such as\nWest’s; see Soble 1996: 37–39, Wertheimer 2003:\npassim), this does not negate the claim that if\nsexual activity harms one or more of the consenting parties, the\nactivity is wrong. Put this way, the argument sounds plausible: there\nis no good reason to deny that harmful sexual acts are wrong in that\nrespect. One might object that this argument is paternalistic, telling\npeople not to engage in sex when the sex is harmful (Soble 1996:\n37–39). This objection is true in that harmful sex gives the\nparticipants a reason to not engage in it, although it cannot be used\nto argue that social or legal forces should prevent this action\n(Wertheimer 2003: 130–131). \nA third type of reason relies on virtues and vices. Consider the\nfollowing examples.  \nEach case has universal participant consent, yet each sexual act is\nwrong in some aspect (though not all are seriously wrong) because it\nexhibits a vice: unprofessional, intemperate, malicious (and possibly\ncruel and demeaning; cf. Morgan 2003a), vain, and cowardly,\nrespectively. Once again consent is not sufficient for the act’s\ngoodness, though perhaps it is for its permissibility (depending on\nthe seriousness of the harm or vice). \nThe necessity of consent is often taken for granted by philosophers.\nBut this can be questioned. For instance, viewing sexual activity and\npleasure as casual might render consent unnecessary in some cases\n(Benatar 2002). On the “casual view” of sexual pleasure,\nsexual pleasure is like other pleasures and may be enjoyed like them,\nsubject to the usual moral constraints. If so, liberals are correct to\ndefend promiscuity and casual sex as morally permissible, but might be\nunable to explain the wrongness of pedophilia or the special wrongness\nof rape, because if sexual pleasure is casual it would be difficult to\nsee why pedophilia is wrong, and why the wrongness of rape is as bad\nas we think it is; perhaps it would be as bad as forcing\n“somebody to eat something” (Benatar 2002: 196). Arguing\nthat children cannot consent to sex, so pedophilia is wrong, assumes\nthat sexual pleasure is serious, otherwise children’s consent\nwould not be necessary. Indeed, a parent might want to instill in\ntheir child the ability to be sexually experienced, so might coerce\nthe child into sex on occasion, much like parents coerce their\nchildren into activities deemed good for them (Benatar 2002:\n195–196). Thus, consent might not always be necessary. Briefly\nput, if sexual activity is trivial, sexual consent would not be\nimportant (or as important as we think). \nSince we do consider sex to be important (imagine claiming that incest\nor sex with animals is “cool” because sex is trivial), the\ncasual view of sex must be wrong. But then promiscuity and casual sex\ncannot be easily defended on liberal grounds, and a\nsignificance view of sex—that sex is a serious\nmatter—is correct (Benatar 2002: 191–192). Thus, if the\nliberal is to accept the significance view of sex, she must shield\ncasual sex and promiscuity from moral censor. \nOne strategy is to argue that sex is significant in that it involves\none’s most important private space: one’s body. Suppose\nthat X is a social person, always happy to have guests over at\nX’s house. One day, X discovers that some people\nhave entered her apartment and used it to entertain themselves.\nX feels justifiably violated, indicating that the violation of\nprivate spaces is a serious wrong. If this is true of an apartment, it\nis truer of one’s body, especially since sexual violation\nusually involves the insertion of something in the body. This explains\nwhy sexual violations are experienced as deeply traumatic (Wertheimer\n2003: ch.5). Sex is significant because it involves the involvement\none’s most important and private space (cf. Brogaard 2015:\n188–190). \nAnother strategy is to reject a single view of sexual pleasure as\neither casual or significant and argue that, depending on between whom\nthe pleasure occurs, it might or might not be casual. \nBut even if (or when) sex is significant, it does not follow that it\nmust be experienced only in the context of love, deep affection, etc.\nWhat follows instead is that consent is necessary. Thus, sex may be\ncasual or promiscuous, as long as consent is secured. \nObjectification is a perennial issue in the philosophy of sex. It\noriginates in Kant’s moral philosophy, and many feminists have\nadopted its language to criticize, for example, pornography, though\nwhereas Kant was concerned with the objectifying nature of sexual\ndesire, feminists do not target sex as such, but only in the context\nof patriarchy, claiming that it involves the sexual objectification of\nwomen by men in certain contexts (see below; some claim that all\nheterosexual sex is poison under patriarchy, e.g., Dworkin 1987).\nIndeed, sexual desire might not be necessary for the claim that a\nwoman is sexually objectified under patriarchy: a man need not\nsexually desire a woman to catcall her. \nSexual objectification is treating or considering a person\nonly as a sex object. Casual sex, watching pornography,\ncatcalling, ogling, and other examples all allegedly involve sexual\nobjectification. The “only” is important because otherwise\nthere is no basis for moral complaint given that we frequently treat\neach other as objects. It is unclear whether objectification can\nconsist of mere mental regard or whether it must have a treatment\ncomponent (ogling someone is interesting because it is unclear whether\nit is treatment or mere regard). Some philosophers (Papadaki 2017;\nLangton 2009; Nussbaum 1995) define “sexual\nobjectification” broadly enough to include mere regard (others,\ne.g., LeMoncheck [1985: ch. 1] do not). The inclusion of regard is\nwise because objectification seems to involve mere attitudes and\nperceptions (e.g., ogling, the regard found in watching pornography).\nX then sexually objectifies Y if, and only if, X\ntreats or regards Y only as a sexual object. \nThe importance of objectification stems from a view of human beings as\nmore than objects (LeMoncheck 1985: ch. 1; Papadaki 2017). If human\nbeings, regardless of individual merit, have elevated moral status in\nvirtue of having rationality, dignity, autonomy, or some such\nproperty, reducing someone to a lower level is wrong. But how\ncommon the actual occurrence of sexual objectification and\nhow serious it is, are additional questions. It seems rare to\ntreat our sexual partners as mere objects in any obvious and troubling\nways: not only are we aware of their humanity, we are also attentive\nto it. Indeed, among the various ways of\nobjectification—instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness,\nfungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity (this\nis Nussbaum’s list [1995: 257]; cf. Langton 2009:\n228–229)—only instrumentality is common. Others, such\nownership and denial of subjectivity, seem rare (Halwani 2017a). Clear\ncases of sexual objectification include sexually-motivated rape and\ncatcalling. \nThe Kantian view is that sexual desire objectifies by its nature and\nmakes it impossible for the sexual partners to satisfy the Categorical\nImperative. Equally problematic on this view is X objectifying\nhim or herself—more accurately, allowing him or herself\nto be objectified by Y. Indeed, self-objectification is what\nmakes the view particularly Kantian (Soble 2017b: 313). It also marks\nanother difference with feminists’ understanding of\nobjectification. \nSexual desire objectifies by its nature because when X sexually\ndesires Y, X desires Y’s body and body\nparts, especially the sexual ones, making it hard, if not impossible,\nto treat the humanity in Y as an end (Kant 1930 [1963: 164]).\nOnly sexual desire among our inclinations is directed at human beings\nas such, not “their work and services” (Kant 1930 [1963:\n163]). Although it is morally permissible to use each other for all\nsorts of purposes as long as they involve our “work and\nservices”, sexual interactions are different. In almost every\ninteraction with each other, we are interested in some ability,\ntalent, or service that another can perform, an aspect intimately\nconnected to their rationality. In these cases, either X does\nnot desire Y’s body (but Y’s abilities,\ntalents, or services) or X desires it but in service to\nY’s abilities. Only with sexual desire (and,\nKant says, in the rare case of cannibalism; 1930 [1963: 162–63])\ndoes X desire Y as a body, as an object.\nX wants to enjoy Y herself, not her beautiful\nvoice, her massaging abilities, etc. And if X desires\nY’s abilities, it is in service to\nY’s physicality. Sexual desire renders people\nobjects by reversing our normal relationship with their\nbodies. Their bodies become the objects, not the instruments, of our\nattention. Kant thought that only marriage can make objectification\ntolerable, though his argument is implausible (Kant 1930 [1963: 163];\nsee Soble 2013b, 2017b; Denis 2001; Wertheimer 2003:\n130–135). \nConsent is thus not sufficient for permissible sex because consenting\nto sex is consenting to objectification, to something wrong (Soble\n2017b: 303–304). Kant’s view indicates also why including\nregard in a definition of “sexual objectification” is\nplausible: even though X and Y treat each other well\nduring sex, they still regard each other as mere sex objects. \nThe phenomenology of sexual desire seems to confirm Kant’s\npoint: The “other’s body, his or her lips, thighs,\nbuttocks, and toes, are desired as the arousing parts they are,\ndistinct from the person” (Soble 2013b: 302). During a good\nsexual act, even with one’s lover, at some point they focus on\nass, cock, pussy, tits, etc. (Vannoy 1980: 14). Kant’s view that\nsexual desire and activity are different—perhaps even\nunique—from other ways we view and interact with other people\nseems correct, providing support for the conclusion that sexual desire\nobjectifies. \nSexual desire seems also powerful: its pull is strong and its voice\nloud, insisting, and persistent, so much so that people do irrational\nand immoral things to satisfy it. This might be a gendered feature of\nsexual desire, truer more of men than of women, though throughout\nhistory, and in today’s popular culture especially, women have\noften been portrayed as sexually insatiable (see Anderson &\nStruckman-Johnson 1998; Soble 2008: ch. 10). Of course, sexual\npartners normally observe limits on how they treat each other: they do\nnot violate each other, treat each other literally as objects, and so\non, exactly because they understand that they may not treat people in\nsuch ways. Thus, sexual desire operates within moral red lines. \nThe Kantian problem of objectification cannot be easily solved.\nArguing that there is no objectification because human beings have no\nspecial moral status from which they can be lowered (Soble 2002:\n53–63) does not meet Kant on his own grounds (as Soble insists in\n2017b). Claiming that parties to the sexual act normally consent to it\n(Mappes 1987), that objectification is okay as long as the\nrelationship is respectful (Nussbaum 1995: esp. 227–231), or that\nsexual partners attend to each other’s sexual needs (Goldman\n1977: 282–283; Singer 1984: 382) also do not solve the problem because\nnone addresses the nature of sexual desire (Soble 2017b). \nTwo other options are to accept the problem as a problem (but perhaps\nminimize it; Halwani 2017a) or to argue that sexual desire among human\nbeings is not always objectifying. This is not merely the idea,\ninsisted on by the intentional view, that sexual desire in human\nbeings is complex, because a Kantian view of sex can accommodate this\npoint, but that  \nthere is far more to sex than the desire to use another’s body\nin a degrading manner for your selfish pleasure. Even the elements in\nsexual desire closest to this are combined, at least in healthy\npeople, with other elements of human emotion that radically transform\ntheir meaning. (Wood 2008: 227)  \nKant’s view, however, can also accommodate this insight. For\nexample, X might sexually desire Y because Y is,\namong other things, a kind person, such that X would not have\ndesired Y otherwise. But once X desires Y,\nX desires Y’s body and body parts. Sexual desire\ncan be selfish while layered in other elements of human emotions, and\nthe Kantian view need not be confined to a simplistic view of sexual\ndesire such that it is crassly selfish or always acted on in a\ndegrading “manner”; Kantian sex can be attentive to the\nother’s needs. \nNonetheless, the above idea that sexual desire can be combined with\nhealthy emotions makes it possible that sexual desire is not always\ntoxic, though how remains unclear. To succeed, sexual desire needs to\nbe injected with healthy emotions, and not merely added to them, so\nthat its nature changes on particular occasions. \nOn the Kantian view, not all sexual activity is objectifying:\nany sexual activity not stemming from sexual desire might not be\nobjectifying. Even in those cases when sexual activity is\nobjectifying, its seriousness varies: in consensual encounters it is\ndrowned by other moral factors, whereas in (sexually motivated) rape\nit is very serious as sexual desire is the primary motive. (The motive\nis not to sexually objectify someone, as this is rare;\ninstead, X regards Y in a way that is sexually\nobjectifying.) \nMoreover, it is unclear how sexual objectification differs between men\nand women, especially if men and women experience sex differently. Men\nexperience sexual desire more frequently and insistently than women,\nthough both are similar in their enjoyment of sexual activity (Ogas\nand Gaddam 2001: chs. 3 and 4; Symons 1979: 179; Wertheimer 2003:\n38–46). Thus men might engage in more sexual objectification than do\nwomen given that men think about sex more, ogle others more, and are\nmore easily turned on visually. Since during sexual activity both\nwould sexually objectify each other roughly equally, men would\nsexually objectify women overall more than women would men. Men also\nconsume pornography (straight and gay) far more than women do, so\nwould engage in much more sexual objectification than do women (by\nviewing people on-screen, by viewing people as mere sexual objects,\netc.). It is perhaps in this sense that pornography allows women (and\nmen, as objects of other men’s desire) to be objectified, not so\nmuch in the feminist sense, as I’ll explain next. \nSome feminists have argued that pornography objectifies women by\ndehumanizing them, and it dehumanizes them by depicting them as mere\nsexual instruments for men (Hill 1987), by depicting their pleasure as\nonly for the men’s (Longino 1980), by endorsing this treatment\n(Longino 1980; Eaton 2007), or by sending the message that all women\nare like this (Garry 1978). But these claims seem unconvincing.\nPornography shows both men and women sexually enjoying each other, and\nit is difficult to prove that women’s pleasure is depicted as\nmerely for the men’s (one might as well argue for the reverse)\nbecause the scenes themselves do not tell us anything (Soble 2002:\n19–20, 28, 98, 196; 1996: 225–227). Nor does pornography seem to send\nmessages about the status of women, whether about the depicted women\nor women in general. Doing so disables the viewer’s ability to\nimagine the scenes as he wants, thereby undermining its own purposes\nof titillating him (Soble 1996: 231–234). But pornography enables the\nsexual objectification of women by displaying them to the gaze of the\nmale viewer (ditto for men in pornography, albeit the gay gaze). This\nform of objectification seems innocuous, as long as it is not\nimplicated in harm towards women, either individually or as a class\n(Gruen 2006; see also Eaton 2007). \nA deeper form of objectification is found in the view that pornography\nconstructs women’s sexuality in a bad way (MacKinnon 1993;\nDworkin 1974, 1979). It eroticizes patriarchal ways of viewing women,\nso that sexual desire becomes infused with dominance (cf. Morgan\n2003a: 388–390). The sexual desires of young men who routinely consume\npornography become desires for the sexual domination of women. Women\nbecome socially constructed sexual beings for men, such that men\ndesire them as pornography depicts them—as non-real beings:\n“objectification comes to define femininity, and one-sidedness\ncomes to define mutuality” (MacKinnon 1993: 26; see Mason-Grant\n2004). This view, however, implausibly neglects sexual desire’s\nbiology, assuming that sexual desire can be fully socially\nconstructed. Moreover, insofar as it is an empirical view, no proper\nevidence has been marshalled in its support (Diorio 2006; Tarrant\n2014). \nSexual desire, as we have seen, is sufficient for objectification.\nHowever, it is not necessary. The guy catcalling a woman to feel part\nof the group is an example, and so are pornography directors and\neditors, who, by choosing the angle of the camera and the footage\ncuts, help sexually objectify the performers by presenting them to the\nviewer in particular ways; similar reasoning applies to, say, brothel\nowners. Indeed, women themselves might have few options other than to\nsexually objectify themselves, in a society that values women mostly\nthrough their sexuality (Jütten 2016). This might be the most\npernicious form of sexual objectification in that social forces direct\nor pressure (not necessarily force) women to adopt such\nself-identifications or self-presentations to lead better lives,\nthough whether they are actually flourishing is harder to gauge. \nRecently, the concept of “derivatization” has been used to\nexamine sex and sexual practices (Parker 2017; Wolf 2016).  \nTo derivatize something is to portray, render, understand, or approach\na being solely or primarily as the reflection, projection, or\nexpression of another being’s identity, desires, fears, etc. The\nderivatized subject becomes reducible in all relevant ways to the\nderivatizing subject’s existence. (Cahill 2011: 32; see also\n2013)  \nThis view might capture some central feminist problems with\npornography, namely, the depiction of women’s sexuality as\nreflecting men’s sexual desires of women.\n“Derivatization” might also be a more accurate concept\nthan “objectification” because the latter relies on a\nmistaken view of human beings (that we are autonomous and non-bodily),\nwhereas the former is based on a relational view of human beings\n(Cahill 2013). \nThe importance of “derivatization” notwithstanding, the\nabove reasons do not clinch the case for its replacement of\n“objectification” because “objectification”\nneed not assume that human beings are non-bodily and autonomous; it\ncan accept them as enmeshed in this world as they are (with varying\ndegrees of autonomy). Moreover, “derivatization” seems not\nto cover all cases (or all cases well). Consider a closeted gay man\nwho catcalls a woman only to impress his peers. He objectifies her but\ndoes not seem derivatize her. If the reply is that he catcalls that\nparticular woman because she represents not his desires but, say,\nsociety’s desires of what women should look like, then, given\nthat for any sexual situation one can attribute derivatization to some\nparty or other, “derivatization” stands in danger of being\nempty or too broad to be explanatory. \nThe most famous contemporary philosophical account is Thomas\nNagel’s psychologically-based view of sexual perversion.\n“Natural” sexual desire involves a multi-leveled mutual\nawareness by two people of each other: X perceives sexual\nexcitement in Y, Y perceives excitement in X,\nX perceives that Y is excited by X, and so on\n(1969: 10–12). Sexual desire is complex in that it includes\nX’s sexual arousal by Y and X’s\nfeeling sexual because of Y’s arousal by X, and so\non with higher levels. Sexual perversions are then standing\npreferences for sexual activity that does not involve such\nmulti-levels of sexual arousal. Since this view locates naturalness\nand perversion in the agent’s preferences, the sexual act itself\nneed not mirror this structure; only the desires need have this\ncomplexity. Thus, it is inaccurate to accuse it of being sexless\n(Solomon 1974: 336) or to evaluate it by giving examples of\nnon-complex sexual acts (Kupfer 2016: 333). \nAlthough this view accommodates some perversions, such as zoophilia,\npedophilia, and “intercourse with … inanimate\nobjects” because they “seem to be stuck at some primitive\nversion of the first stage of sexual feeling” (Nagel 1969: 14),\nit yields counter-intuitive results: masturbation does not fare well\non this view, depending on whether it insists on the perception of the\nactual (not imaginative) embodiment of desire in another person (Soble\n2013a: 85–87). It also misunderstands how perversions usually\nwork: a coprophiliac does not normally desire sex with feces,\nbut to incorporate feces in his sexual act with another, which could\ninvolve multi-levels of perception. Moreover, the account does not\ncapture common intuitions about natural and perverted sex: it goes\nbeyond the plausible idea that the arousal of one partner increases\nthe other’s, to that of multi-layered arousal—an\nunintuitive idea. Similar views rely on the idea that natural sexual\ndesire is interpersonal, such as that it culminates in love (Scruton\n1986: ch. 10) and that it communicates attitudes and feelings (Solomon\n1974; see Halwani 2018b: ch. 9 for discussion). \nA non-psychological account of sexual perversion, one closer to folk\nbiology, claims that only reproduction allows us to distinguish\nperversions from non-perversions (Ruddick 1984: 287; cf. Gray 1978).\nThis does not mean that every act has to be reproductive, only that\nnatural sexual desires “could lead to reproduction in\nnormal physiological circumstances” (Ruddick 1984: 288). Thus, a\nheterosexual couple having intercourse but not intending to procreate\nare not engaging in perverted sex: their desire is of the\nkind that, under “normal physiological\ncircumstances”, could lead to reproduction (1984: 288). \nThe account might have implausible implications, however. Anyone who\nprefers (heterosexual) oral sex to intercourse would be perverted.\nMoreover, any heterosexual couple that incorporate fetish objects,\nurine, feces, and so on, in their sexual intercourse would be\nsexually natural (Gray 1978: 190–192; Primoratz 1999: 53–54). Indeed,\ncoprophilia can sink all the above accounts: two people who exhibit\ninter-personal attitudes in the form of multi-level perceptions, and\nwho have sexual intercourse of the reproductive type, communicating\nhealthy emotions sincerely, yet use feces in their activity would\ncounter-intuitively not be perverted on any of the above accounts. \nEven though explaining perversion in terms of biology seems obvious,\n“perversion” is opposed not only to “natural”,\nbut also to “normal”, and the natural and the normal do\nnot fully overlap. Moreover, the concept of “perversion”\ncould refer to many things: the immoral, disgusting, bizarre, and\nbiologically abnormal, among others. Using only one of these to define\n“perversion” will probably fail. It might also be that the\nmethodology of discussing this concept is flawed, failing to account\nfor the concept’s social function (Miller 2010). Thus, some\nphilosophers have proposed to get rid of the concept altogether\n(Priest 1997; Primoratz 1999: ch. 6; Ruse 1988: 197–201).\nRecently, however, a new account of it in terms of its inhibiting\n“shared joy, mutual exploration, self-affirmation, and\nunion” was offered (Kupfer 2016: 351). But this view seems to\nset the bar too high for what counts as non-perverted. \nA good account of perversion might have to be prescriptive, capturing\nthe core of perversion but not necessarily capturing all our beliefs\nabout it (it should explain why our beliefs are mistaken when they\nare). Furthermore, it will likely be a psychological account, a\npreference to have sex with or involving certain types of object that\nare anti-life, such as bodily waste and corpses, and that are\nbiologically odd, such as inter-species sexual intercourse.\nEvolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology would have to play\ncrucial roles. \nWhat is the value of sex? How important (or valuable!) is this value?\nProcreation, love, and pleasure (as types, not tokens) are obvious\nanswers to the first question. Sex is usually the way to procreate, so\nsex is valuable insofar as procreation is valuable. But this value is\ninstrumental, and it is contingent given technology’s ability to\nseparate procreation from sex. There is also anti-natalism\n(Schopenhauer 1851, 1859: ch. 46; Benatar 2006, 2015), which implies\nthat sex has negative value in its procreative aspect. The value of\nsex in regards to procreation is thus precarious. \nAnother instrumental value of sex is that X’s sexual\ndesire for Y can (help) cause X to love Y\n(Bertocci 1949: ch. 2). Here, sex’s value is contingent on\nlove’s, and, despite sounding strange, the value of romantic\nlove, especially in its early, passionate stages, is not obvious given\nits negative effects on the lover and others. Still, if sex leads to\nthe settled stage of love (via the passionate one), it is valuable for\nthat. Sex can also express love and affection for one’s partner\nand cement their relationship (McKeever 2017, but see Vannoy 1980: ch.\n1). But even if true, all this still makes sex’s value depend on\nand instrumental to love’s, especially since the two are very\ndifferent (Goldman 1977: 272–275; Soble 2008: ch. 9 [which adds\nmarriage to the mix]; Vannoy 1980: 7–12). \nDoes sex have intrinsic value? If it does, it is probably sexual\npleasure, as-sensation or as-enjoyment, a pleasure that provides\npeople with the main motive for having sex, often with drastic\nconsequences. So then how valuable is the pleasure of sex? Perhaps we\nshould regard our appetite for sex like we do that for food to avoid\nobsessing about it (Russell 1929 [1970: 289]). But can we go\nfurther? \nPeople spend much time pursuing projects and activities they enjoy or\nconsider worthwhile. Some do only when time, work, or family time\npermit, and some do much of the time (they are, say, independently\nwealthy). Writing, pursuing Hollywood or Bollywood stardom, playing\nchess, swimming, traveling, and, of course, building a family are\nexamples. Other than philosophical far-fetched examples of worthless\npursuits (counting blades of grass, collecting bottle caps), most\nprojects and activities have some worth, unless we wish to\ncondemn most human beings of having worthless lives. Perhaps some\nprojects are more worthwhile than others (though how to argue for this\nis not easy), but almost all have some worth, and an intellectual one\nat that, including watching reality television or reading junk fiction\n(Carroll 1998: esp. ch. 1 and 2). \nNow consider X, whose life project is the pursuit of sexual\npleasures. X says,  \nI am young, moderately good-looking, and, with current technology\n(e.g., phone apps), I can easily sexually hook up with others. I enjoy\nsex, and it makes me feel good. In between bouts of sex, I can see\nfriends, go to the gym, movies, whatever. But my deepest\nenjoyment—my life-plan, to use philosophical jargon—is to\npursue the pleasures of sex.  \nIs there something we can say to prove X wrong, especially if\nX has the talent for something considered more important?\nPerhaps we can claim that pursuing sex is not as worthy as reading\nRussian literature, but even here we are on insecure ground. \nOne can argue that X is not using X’s intellectual\npowers. But this underestimates the reliance on intellect in sexual\npursuits or presumes that such use is unimportant. Alternatively, one\ncan argue that X is not using X’s intellectual\npowers deeply or in a theoretical way. But this would rule out many a\nlife as good. One can argue that there are more important things in\nlife than pursuing sexual pleasure. But X need not live without\nfriends, family, and other important things present in normal lives.\nOne can argue that sex objectifies, so it is wrong to make it central\nto one’s life. But unless one were a die-hard Kantian, the\nobjectification involved in sex can be redeemed by other factors. \nOne can argue that sexual sensory pleasure “will not be at the\ncenter of a rational life plan”, and that these pleasures are\n“intermittent and short-lived”, their value ultimately\ndepending “entirely on the interpersonal relationships into\nwhich they fit and which constitute their context” (Goldman\n2016: 98). But it is not clear why the pleasures’ brevity and\nintermittency are problems. One can argue that someone who prefers\nmasturbation to sex with others “could reflect a failure to\nunderstand the importance and value of sex and sexual pleasure”\n(Scanlon 1998: 175) because the importance of sex is its expression in\nrelations with other people (Scanlon seems not to have in mind casual\nor promiscuous sex). But X can have affectionate sexual\nrelationships with others, and friendships, etc., with different\nothers. Even casual hookups have their bonding aspects. Finally, one\ncan argue that sex “achieves a level of passion” with\n“no equal in other forms of interaction”, and such that\nwhen it occurs between lovers  \nit defines a most significant moment of goodness between two people,\nwhere each achieves a most profound moment of affirmation and\nsatisfaction that is inextricably tied to the endeavor to please the\nother. (Thomas 1999: 59)  \nBut note how the affirmation and satisfaction here can as easily apply\nto passionate yet love-less sex. \nThus, even if pursuing sexual pleasure is not as intellectually\nstimulating as reading classical Arabic poetry, it is not worthless,\nwhether intellectually or non-intellectually, and it is on a par with\nmany other pursuits that people undertake that are far from having\nintellectual depth. Moreover,  \n[I]sn’t being a provider of sexual pleasure an important and\nvaluable attribute, one to be cherished? Maybe we should construct a\ntheory of human dignity based on our sexual capacities …\ninstead of looking for something ‘finer’ beyond or above\nthe sexual. (Soble 2002: 58–59)  \nIf X conducts X’s life morally, and if X\ndevelops some talents or hobbies for those rainy days (sure\nto come) when X is no longer sexually desirable and\nX’s friends are busy with other things, we can say to\nX, “Enjoy!”","contact.mail":"rhalwa@saic.edu","contact.domain":"saic.edu"}]
