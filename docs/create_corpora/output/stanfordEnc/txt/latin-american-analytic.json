Its development has been heterogeneous in the\ndifferent countries of the region, but has reached today a considerable\ndegree of maturity and originality. There is now a strong community\nworking within the analytic tradition in Latin America.\n\n\nAnalytic philosophy was introduced in Latin America in the\nmid-twentieth century, though it did not spread easily throughout the\nregion. This entry gives an historical overview of analytic philosophy\nproduced in Latin America, and not about Latin\nAmerica; it encompasses philosophical developments concerning the most\ndiverse and universal problems that are at the heart of Western\nphilosophy. Given the vast number of individuals, institutions,\njournals and issues that coexist in this geographical area of the\nanalytic tradition, we must begin by specifying some of the boundaries\nof this work. \n\nFirst, the entry focuses on the ideas of philosophers who have\ndeveloped their research and teaching practice for most of their lives\nin a Latin American country (instead of taking the country of origin as\na criterion). One feature of Latin American intellectuals is that many\nhave had to emigrate to other countries within or outside of the\nregion, in many cases due to political reasons, in other cases for\neconomic reasons, and in a few cases for personal reasons. For reasons\nof space those philosophers with Latin American roots who developed\ntheir philosophical work outside this area will be\n excluded.[1] \n\nSecond, this entry will not discuss the contemporary history of the\ntopic, as it is still evolving. As mentioned above, analytic philosophy\nwas introduced in the mid-twentieth century, initially in Argentina and\nMexico, then to a lesser extent in Brazil. The first analytic\nphilosophers in the region carried out extensive didactic work that has\nleft generations of professional philosophers working within the\ntradition. As the research is ongoing, it is impossible to mention all\nthe people currently working within this tradition in Latin America.\nSee the Other Internet Resources for links to relevant\nAssociations. \n\nFinally, it is important to delineate what will be considered within\nthe scope of analytic philosophy for the present work. Our\nconsideration of analytic philosophy is not limited to work involving\nconceptual analysis. Indeed, as Ezcurdia (2015) maintains, not all\nphilosophers who consider themselves analytic adopt this method, and\nthose who do disagree about the way in which it should be understood.\nRabossi (1975) defends the idea that analytic philosophy can be\nidentified by considering certain family resemblances. He suggests the\nfollowing family traits: a positive attitude toward scientific\nknowledge; a cautious attitude toward metaphysics; a conception of\nphilosophy as a conceptual task, which takes conceptual analysis as a\nmethod; a close relationship between language and philosophy; a concern\nwith seeking argumentative answers to philosophical problems; search\nfor conceptual clarity. In the case of analytic philosophy in Latin\nAmerica, we must add two other family traits to the above list; these\ntraits distinguish the ways in which philosophy is practiced in Latin\nAmerica from how it is practiced in other parts of the world. First,\nsince analytic philosophy was introduced when other philosophical\ntraditions were dominant, philosophical reflections in the analytic\ntradition frequently go hand in hand with metaphilosophical issues\n(e.g. the nature of philosophy, its role in society, its specific way\nof teaching, the relationships amongst various philosophical\ntraditions, etc.). Second, since the introduction of analytic\nphilosophy in Latin American countries was related to a quest to change\nconservative intellectual institutions, social and political\nstructures, and their forms of management, the critical and\nconstructive spirit of analytic philosophy led many of its\npractitioners in Latin America to engage politically in a variety of\nways in their home countries. \n\nEven this expanded list of family traits is not sufficient to\ncharacterize analytic philosophy in Latin America. Many non-analytic\nphilosophers exhibit these same traits. Glock (2008) suggests that the\nright way to understand analytic philosophy is to add a historical\ndimension to these traits and understand analytic philosophy as an\nintellectual tradition. In a similar vein, Gracia (2010) argues that\nsociological considerations play an important role in distinguishing\nanalytic philosophy from other methods of philosophy: \n\nWhat we have then is a family structure not based on a genetic but\non an intellectual lineage, an intellectual pedigree, which in turn is\nbased on practices that have been passed and amended within a family\ncontext. In fact, we continue to organize in families and tribes and\nthere are exclusions and fiefdoms. Mankind is primarily composed of\ncommunities, and philosophy does not differ from other human endeavors.\nThis explains why cultural, political and ethnically considerations,\nplay a role in human projects, including the academic ones. (Gracia\n2010: 29) \n\nThe analytic tradition not only has a history, but is made up of\nseveral generations of people who are linked in particular ways (e.g.\nadvisor-student and colleague-colleague relationships). These people\nparticipate in shared activities in which they recognize each other as\nmembers of the same community, discuss and research similar topics\nusing a similar approach, and operate with a shared theoretical\nbackground. This does not mean that analytic philosophers from Latin\nAmerica do not share links to the wider community of European and\nAnglo-Saxon analytic philosophers. On the contrary, many of them have\nbeen educated outside of Latin America, engage in work that goes beyond\nthe Latin American context and forge important ties with Anglo-Saxon\nand European academic communities. \n\nThis entry presents the community of analytic philosophers that\nexists today in Latin America, describing the way in which this\nphilosophical tradition has developed in the region. Section 2 offers\nan historical approach to the subject, while\n section 3\nprovides examples of the\nmost original lines of research developed in Latin America\nwithin the analytic tradition. \n\nPhilosophy in Latin America, as with all other cultural enterprises,\nhas been closely related to European culture since\ncolonial\n times.[2]\nIt is against a\nbackground of Thomist, Marxist, positivist, phenomenological,\nexistentialist and idealistic philosophy that the works of authors like\nFrege, Russell, Quine, Carnap, Wittgenstein, Strawson and others were\nintroduced. Analytic philosophy developed heterogeneously across Latin\nAmerica. The analytic tradition appears in Argentina and Mexico in the\nmid-twentieth century, and to a lesser extent in Brazil, Peru, Colombia\nand Uruguay in the same period. The development in Argentina and Mexico\nwas much faster, and analytic philosophy had matured in the two\ncountries by the 1980s. Strong institutions there, created by early\nanalytic philosophers (e.g., the Instituto de Investigaciones\nfilosóficas at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma\nde México (IIF-UNAM) and the Sociedad Argentina de\nAnálisis Filosófico (SADAF)), played an important\nrole. The development of analytic philosophy was more limited in other\ncountries where there were only isolated figures who, in many cases,\nleft no students. \n\nAnalytic philosophy appeared in Argentina in the mid-twentieth\ncentury in two very different areas: (1) philosophy of math and science\nand (2) philosophy of law. \n\nA number of mathematicians and physicists interested in the\nfoundations of mathematics and the natural sciences introduced the\nlogical developments of the early twentieth century and the ideas of\nthe logical positivists of the Vienna Circle. Mario Bunge, who in 1944\nfounded Minerva, the first philosophy journal in the country,\nplayed an important role. Bunge was also the author of the first\nanalytic book written in Latin America, Causality: The Place of the\nCausal Principle in Modern Science, published by Harvard in 1959,\nwhich was subsequently translated into Spanish. The next year he\npublished Antología Semántica, the first Spanish\ntranslations of Russell, Carnap, Hempel, Tarski, Quine and Goodman.\nHowever, Bunge moved to Canada shortly afterwards and left no students\nin Argentina. Contemporaneous with Bunge, Julio Rey Pastor and Gregorio\nKlimovsky introduced issues in logic and the foundations of mathematics\nat the Faculty of Exact Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires.\nThough he published few papers, Gregorio Klimovsky fostered the\ndevelopment of analytic philosophy in Argentina. His deep knowledge and\nenthusiasm for the foundations of mathematics, methodology of natural\nsciences, the foundations of psychoanalysis and the history of science\nleft a deep impression on his students. Klimovsky taught\nlogic and philosophy of science at the University of Buenos Aires from\n1957 to 1966, introducing contemporary logic and analytic authors to\nphilosophy students, some of whom became the first generation of\nArgentine analytic philosophers. \n\nPhilosophy of language was introduced as a discipline in Argentina\nby Thomas Moro Simpson who published Formas lógicas,\nrealidad y significado in 1964, a book of Latin American analytic\nliterature, influential not only in Argentina and Mexico (where he\ntraveled in 1967 to teach on these topics), but also in other Latin\nAmerican countries. Simpson also published Semántica\nFilosófica in 1973, a book which includes translations\nof some of the most foundational works in analytic\nphilosophy—such as Russell’s “On Denoting”\nand Frege’s “Sense and Reference”—in addition\nto discussions related to quantification, existence and\nbelief\n attribution.[3]\nHis students,\nRaúl Orayen and Alberto Moretti, worked specifically on logic,\nthe philosophy of logic and philosophy of language. Moretti specialized\nin Frege and also studied Davidson’s philosophy of language and\nTarski’s theory of truth. Some of his most significant\ncontributions have recently been compiled in Interpretar y referir.\nEjercicios de análisis filosófico (2008). Orayen\nworked in Argentina until the 1970s when he emigrated to Mexico, where\nhe joined the IIF-UNAM. There he fostered several generations of\nanalytic philosophers and made his most substantive contributions\nincluding one of his most significant works, Lógica,\nsignificado y ontología. His\n research[4]\nfocused on the philosophy of logic and language,\nincluding the work of Russell, Frege, Quine, Kripke,\nand\n others.[5] \n\nFelix Schuster focused his work on the philosophy of social\nsciences. His book, Explicación y predicción: La\nvalidez del conocimiento en ciencias sociales, published in 1982,\nis a classic that has been reprinted numerous times. In this work he\nwas concerned with the methodology and validity of sociology, history,\neconomics, anthropology, psychology and psychoanalysis, as well as the\nstructure and predictive possibilities of the various\n theories.[6] \n\nA number of lawyers and experts in the foundations of law\nintroduced formal developments as well as analytic tools developed\nwithin ordinary language philosophy to study of the language of law.\nRegarding analytic tools, it is necessary to mention Carlos Cossio and\nAmbrosio Gioja from the Faculty of Law at the University of Buenos\nAires. While neither of them is strictly speaking an analytic\nphilosopher (both were trained within the phenomenological tradition)\nthey introduced their students to new analytic readings in their\nseminars. Gioja introduced classical analytic texts in legal philosophy\nand ethics to young students participating in a reading group with him.\nSome of these young philosophers of law went on to become founders of\nthe analytic tradition in the\n country.[7]\nMany philosophers were interested in the analysis of\nordinary language, especially Genaro\n Carrió[8]\nand Eduardo Rabossi. Rabossi wrote on many\nissues. His most influential piece in ethics was the book La\njustificación moral del castigo (1976), and he also\npublished Análisis filosófico, lenguaje y\nmetafísica (1975), a book which introduced basic ideas\n from the analytic tradition for the first time in Spanish.\nPosthumously, one of the most\nimportant works of his career was published, En el comienzo Dios\ncreó el canon (2008; see below in\n §3.3).[9] \n\nAmong the first analytic philosophers trained in law school, there\nwas also a line of thought that departs from ordinary language and\nseeks to apply formal tools to studying the language of law. Especially\nnoteworthy in this area is Alchourrón and Bulygin’s\nNormative Systems (1971), on the logic of norms and\nnormative propositions. This work presents legal systems as deductive\nsystems and aims to study the logical asymmetries between the processes\nof promulgation and the abolition of\n laws.[10]\nAlchourrón was concerned with changes in\nthe legal systems produced by the promulgation and abolition of laws,\nseeking to produce a formal system that would give substance to the\nlegal bodies; the parallel with systems of belief induced him to focus\non belief change, producing the first formal paper on the dynamics of\nbelief (Alchourrón et al. 1985); the theory, known as AGM (by\nthe initials of the last names of its creators: Carlos\nAlchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors and David Makinson), have had\na major impact worldwide. \n\nCarlos Nino is one of the youngest members of the Law School\ntradition, and he played an influential role in both practical\nphilosophy and the institutional history of Argentina. He made\nimportant theoretical contributions in ethics, philosophy of law and\nconstitutional theory, among others in Etica y derechos\n humanos.[11]\nNino is also\nremembered for his political commitment to the recovery of democracy in\nArgentina in the 1980s. He was an assessor of President\nAlfonsín, and one of the designers (together with Eduardo\nRabossi) of Alfonsín’s human rights policy, a policy which\nincluded, among other measures, historical judgment of the leaders of\nthe military government in 1985, allowing the imprisonment of the\nleaders of state terrorism in Argentina. Nino died very young\nin\n 1993.[12] \n\nWhile all the patriarchs of analytic philosophy in Argentina were\nformed by, began working, and convened at the University of Buenos\nAires, the institutional history of the country forced them early on to\nleave the university and take refuge in an institution created to\nstrengthen the development of analytic philosophy in the region.\nIndeed, in 1966 the coup d’état drove many\nintellectuals to abandon the public university, forcing them to leave\ntheir jobs and intellectual development. Shortly after, various\nphilosophers begin to gather outside official circles in order to\ncontinue their philosophical work, founding SADAF in\n 1972.[13]\nMany women philosophers also participated in this enterprise such as Cecilia Hidalgo, Cristina Gonzalez, Diana Maffia, Gladys Palau and Nora Stigol. The founding of this\ninstitution converged philosophers from the two lines mentioned above,\ncreating thereafter a unified community of analytic philosophers in the\ncountry. In addition to maintaining the spirit and practice of analytic\nphilosophy during the years in which it was excluded from the public\nsphere (1966–1983), SADAF and its members carried out three major\ntasks: (1) continuing the training of young generations within the\nanalytic tradition; (2) strengthening connections with analytic\ncommunities from other countries, especially with the analytic\ncommunity in the IIF-UNAM Mexico and the Centro de lógica,\nepistemología e história da ciência\n(henceforth: CLE) in Brazil; and (3) creating, in 1981, the first\nanalytic journal in Spanish in Argentina and the second in Latin\nAmerica: Análisis Filosófico. \n\nAs mentioned above, the rapid development of analytic philosophy in\nArgentina had two causes: its early institutionalization, and the\nteaching legacy of many of its founders who produced new generations of\nanalytic philosophers whose works traveled beyond the borders of their\ncountry of\n origin.[14] \n\nThomas Simpson was the intellectual mentor of generations of\nphilosophers of language, most significantly Alberto Moretti, who in\nturn formed a new and powerful generation of\nanalytic\n philosophers.[15]\n Eduardo Rabossi covered wider issues of philosophy and had students\nwho focused on bioethics, Wittgenstein and 20th century\nphilosophy, although most of his students focused on philosophy of\n mind.[16]\n Carlos Alchourrón and Eugenio Bulygin left many students\nworking on the logic of norms, such as Hugo Zuleta and Ricardo\n Caracciolo[17]\nand Alchourrón also had students focused in philosophical \n logic.[18]\n And, despite his early death, Carlos Nino also had many \n students.[19] \n\nBy the mid-80s, analytic philosophy was also developed beyond Buenos Aires, at the National University of Cordoba focusing on three areas: philosophy of language, under the\ndirection of Carolina Scotto; logic, under the direction of Horacio\nFaas; and philosophy of science, under the direction of Victor\nRodriguez. \n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, several Mexican\nphilosophers, themselves not analytic philosophers strictly speaking,\nintroduced a series of formal tools, texts, and themes of analytic\nphilosophy in the country. The first book of philosophy and history of\nscience in Spanish was published by Juan David García Bacca in\n1936. More analytic works followed as a book on logical positivism and\nthe Vienna Circle was published in 1941 by Antonio Caso, and Ayer and\nCarnap’s works were translated by his student, Nicolás\nMolina Flores, who was also the first Mexican to argue in favor of\nlogical empiricism. Eduardo García Maynez, a philosopher of law,\nintroduced the tools of mathematical logic in his work. In 1953 he\npublished Los principios de la ontología formal del derecho\ny su expresión simbólica, one of the first\nphilosophical works expressed in formal symbols in\n Mexico.[20]\nThere are, however, two notable\ndifferences from how analytic philosophy developed in Argentina.\nGarcía Maynez only made superficial use of logical\n tools[21]\nand left no\n students[22]\nso his works had no echo in later\ndevelopments in Mexico and had no impact outside of the country.\nHowever, he achieved an important institutional legacy as he and others\nadvocated for the creation of the Centro de Estudios\nFilosóficos, which later became the IIF-UNAM. While\nGarcía Maynez was its head, the Centro incorporated\nfull time researchers and created the journal Dianoia in 1955.\nDuring this period philosophical discussions and publications in\nSpanish were encouraged. \n\nIn addition to García Maynez, José Gaos, a Spanish\nphilosopher who emigrated to Mexico because of the Spanish civil war,\nwas also influential in the development of analytic philosophy in\nMexico. Many important works in phenomenology, including\nHeidegger’s Sein und Zeit, were translated into Spanish\nby Gaos, himself a phenomenologist. It is in the group meetings\norganized by Gaos where we find the three figures who drove Mexican\nanalytic philosophy since the 1960s: Alejandro Rossi, Luis Villoro and\nFernando Salmerón. Classical analytic readings, such as works by\nRussell, Wittgenstein, and Moore, were introduced during those\nseminars. Henceforth, in Mexico, analytic philosophy appears in\ndialogue and conflict with phenomenology (Salmerón 2003). This\ntransition from phenomenology to analytic philosophy in the IIF-UNAM is\nconsolidated between 1966 and 1977, years in which Salmerón was\nits director. In 1967 the first strictly analytic journal in Spanish is\nfounded: Crítica: Revista hispanoamericana de\nfilosofía. Mexico always welcomed political emigrants and\nhad a policy of inviting other Latin American colleagues who helped\nstrengthen ties among researchers in the region. In those years several\nArgentine analytic philosophers (e.g. Rabossi, Alchourrón, and\nSimpson) were invited to teach in\n Mexico.[23] \n\nThe first article in Spanish about analytic philosophy of\nlanguage—more specifically, about the private language\nargument—was published by Alejandro Rossi, who is of Italian and\nVenezuelan roots but developed his research in Mexico. This work and\nothers were later reprinted in Lenguaje y Significado (1969),\na book consisting of five papers, which clearly reflects the shift from\nphenomenology to analytic philosophy, taking Wittgenstein as its\njuncture. The book’s first paper is on Husserl’s\nLogical Investigations, and the last three papers deal\nspecifically with Strawson and Russell’s disagreement about\ndefinite descriptions, the problem of empty descriptions, and the\nrelationship between proper names and definite descriptions. Besides\nhis philosophical work within the analytic tradition and his enormous\nwork to strengthen the Instituto, Rossi wrote several essays\nof a more literary character, compiled later in Manual del\ndistraído\n (1978).[24] \n\nAnalytic epistemology was introduced in Mexico by Luis Villoro, the\nauthor of a foundational Spanish book Saber, creer, conocer\npublished in 1982. In this book, Villoro reviews many of the themes\ndeveloped in twentieth century epistemology, such as the distinction\nbetween knowledge and belief, its connection with truth, the\ndistinction between different types of knowledge (know-that and\nknow-how), and ethical considerations in a theory of knowledge (e.g.\nthat of tolerance of the others’ unshared beliefs and the rules\nof veracity, rationality and autonomy of reason governing our\nknowledge). In addition, Villoro’s book is foundational in the\nLatin American context because he tried to systematize a technical\nvocabulary in Spanish on these topics for the first time. The question\nof translation is central, as will be discussed in\n §3.3.\nIn English, the dominant language of analytic\nphilosophy, there is a single verb—“to know”—\nwhereas in Spanish (as in German, French, and other languages) there\nare two verbs: “saber” and “conocer”; therefore\nthe question of the relationship between the various types of knowledge\nidentified by philosophers of ordinary language, such as Ryle, and its\ntranslation into Spanish is not an insignificant philosophical issue.\nIn addition to these invaluable contributions to the theory of\nknowledge, Villoro also made outstanding progress on issues related to\nMexico’s political history and political philosophy, as well as\ndiscussions on the possibility of founding an American philosophy, an\nissue at the core of the Hyperion group\n (1948–1952).[25] \n\nPractical philosophy, including ethics and philosophy of education,\nwas introduced by Fernando Salmerón. His first clearly analytic\nbook is La filosofía y las actitudes morales (1971).\nThis book includes three essays written between 1966 and 1969 where\nSalmerón seeks to: 1) highlight the argumentative and critical\nnature of the philosophical activity; 2) connect this vital undertaking\n(the adoption of philosophy as a profession) with a broader sense of\nphilosophy understood as a worldview; and 3) stress issues such as the\npractical commitment of philosophers, the connection between these\npractices and other social practices, the role of philosophical\nresearch and teaching in the society in which it is immersed, the\nrelationship with scientific knowledge, etc. He also published with\nEduardo Rabossi a series of translations of classical works in\npractical analytic philosophy, such as those of Moore, Strawson, Hare,\nStevenson, Searle, Harman, etc. Among his most outstanding works are\nEnsayos filosóficos (1988) and Enseñanza y\nfilosofía (1991). One of his deepest concerns seems to have\nbeen to place philosophy—understood as a critical and\nargumentative practice—in a central site for the political and\nintellectual development of a society. Also noteworthy is his\ninstitutional work, the dissemination of analytic philosophy in Latin\nAmerica, and foreign presentations of analytic contributions made by\nLatin American\n philosophers.[26] \n\nThe abovementioned founders of the analytic tradition in Mexico were\nfollowed by another group of philosophers who were worked on logic and\nphilosophy of science. The next generation, which includes Roberto Caso\nBercht, Hugo Padilla, and Wonfilio Trejo, completely abandoned\nphenomenology and could be considered the first generation of\n“pure” analytic philosophers. Analytic issues and authors\nwere expanded throughout the country by Trejo who taught at other\nuniversities beyond the UNAM. Significant contributions in philosophy\nof language were made by Hugo Margáin and in philosophy of law\nby Ulises Schmill and Javier Esquivel. \n\nDuring the last two decades of the twentieth century, philosophical\nproduction of the IIF-UNAM greatly\n increased.[27]\nAmong the philosophers who contributed are:\nMargarita Valdés who works on applied ethics, philosophy of\nlanguage and mind, epistemology, and more recently on the history of\nanalytic philosophy and philosophy in general in Latin America;\nPaulette Dieterlen who works on political philosophy, specifically on\npoverty and distributive justice and Olbeth Hansberg working in philosophy\nof mind, especially on emotions, perception, consciousness and\nDavidsonian philosophy. Mark Platts, of\nBritish origin, moved to Mexico where he published Ways of\nMeaning in 1979 (second edition in 1997) and Moral Realities:\nAn Essay in Philosophical Psychology (1991), where he explores the\nconcept of desire and develops an anti-Humean theory of moral\nmotivation. He influenced several IIF-UNAM members, including Lourdes\nValdivia, Olbeth Hansberg, Salma Saab, Guillermo Hurtado and Maite\nEzcurdia. Carlos Pereda (originally from Uruguay) works mainly on\nethics, epistemology, and political theory, but also on speech acts and\nlinguistic communication. Since then, younger generations of\nphilosophers have diversified and deepened the\nanalytic\n program.[28] \n\nUnlike what happened in Argentina, Mexico, like Brazil, had\nconsistent state policies that encouraged young scholars to pursue\ngraduate studies abroad with the commitment to return to work in their\nown country. Thus, many philosophers have gotten their PhDs abroad, and\ntheir doctoral advisors work outside of Mexico, usually in the United\nKingdom or the United States. That is why the Mexican philosophical\ncommunities are held together by institutions such as the IIF-UNAM,\nunlike in Argentina where the student-advisor relation is essential to\nthe consolidation of philosophical communities. \n\nIn Brazil we find several early and isolated glimpses of the\nanalytic tradition. Francisco Cavalcante Pontes de Miranda published\nO Método de Análise\nSócio-Psicológica in 1925 and, in 1937, O\nProblema Fundamental do Conhecimento, which was influenced by\nWittgenstein’s Tractatus, Ramsey and the Vienna Circle.\nVicente Ferreira da Silva published a book on the fundamentals of\nmathematical logic in 1940. It is remarkable that W.V.O. Quine stayed\nfor some time in São Paulo, where he published in Portuguese\nO sentido da nova lógica (1944). Though his work\ninfluenced the next generation of philosophers, he did not leave any\nstudents in the region. In contrast, the French analytic philosopher\nGilles-Gaston Granger, who taught at the University of São Paulo\nfrom 1947 to 1953 and returned to Brazil many times afterwards, had a\nmore lasting influence on the likes of Newton da Costa and José\nArthur Giannotti, who worked at the intersection of phenomenology and\nMarxism under Wittgenstein’s influence. Within this first\ngeneration of Brazilian analytic philosophers, it is perhaps Newton Da\nCosta—the creator of paraconsistent logic—who achieved most\nprominence outside of\n Brazil.[29] \n\nAside from the logical tradition, the rest of Brazilian analytic\nphilosophy emerges not as a sequel of positivism, but as a\nphilosophical innovation. The first publications in the area appeared\nin the 70s. In Brazil, unlike in Mexico and Argentina, early analytic\nworks did not come from the phenomenological tradition, but from\nscholars in the history of philosophy. Indeed, there are two major\nfigures in this story, who worked on the history of philosophy but had\nanalytic students: João Paulo Monteiro (a scholar of Hume,\ninterested in questions of epistemology, skepticism, and philosophy of\nscience) and Oswaldo Porchat (a scholar of Aristotle, focused on\nskepticism but also interested in logic, philosophy of language, and\nsciences). In 1976, Porchat founded the Centro de lógica,\nepistemología e história da ciência (CLE) at\nthe University of Campinas, São Paulo, and the following year he\n began to edit the journal Manuscrito, edited by M. Wrigley and later by M. \n Ruffino.[30] \n\nThere is a large group of analytic philosophers in the area of Rio\nde Janeiro, including Oswaldo Chateaubriand, who works in philosophy of\nlogic, metaphysics, and philosophy of language, and contributed to\ntopics such as logical form, syntax, grammar, logical truth, theory of\ndescriptions, theories of truth, modalities\nand\n counterfactuals.[31]\nOther\nanalytic philosophers working in Rio include Danilo Marcondes Filho\n(philosophy of language, epistemology, skepticism), Wilson\nMendonça (philosophy of mind, ethics, and metaethics) and Maria\nClara Dias (ethics, philosophy of action and mind). \n\nIn addition, a large group of philosophers of science work at the\nFederal University of Santa Catarina (Florianópolis) organized\naround the Núcleo de Epistemologia e Lógica\n(NEL) which edits the journal Principia. Every two years they\norganize an international symposium on topics of philosophy of science,\nepistemology, logic, and metaphysics. The group includes Newton da\nCosta, Décio Krause, Luiz Henrique de A. Dutra, and two\nArgentine emigrants, Alberto Cupani and Gustavo Caponi. \n\nUnlike Argentina and Mexico, where much of the activity is\nconcentrated in the two capital cities, Brazil has a vast landscape\nwhere we can find in different universities many philosophers within\nthe analytic tradition, although they work connected to each other by \nANPOF’s “Grupos de \n Trabalho”.[32] \n\nIt is not until 2008 that the Brazilian Society for Analytic\nPhilosophy (SBFA) was\n founded.[33] \n\nIn Colombia, as in other countries in the region, the first works in\nanalytic philosophy were produced in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury. There are two journals—\n Ideas y valores[34]\nand Cuadernos de\nFilosofía y Letras—in which analytic (and\nnon-analytic) works are published. Rubén Sierra Mejia, in the\nsecond half of the 1960s, introduced in Bogotá courses and\ntranslations of some classical works within the analytic tradition, and\npublished his articles in a book, Apreciación de la\nFilosofía Analítica (1987). At the University of\nValle (Cali), Adolfo León Lobos introduced argumentation theory\nand ordinary language philosophy. In the 1980s there was much activity\nin ordinary language\n philosophy.[35]\nJuan José Botero is known for his work\nfocused on the common origins of the phenomenological and the analytic\ntraditions, examining the correspondence between Husserl and Frege and\npublishing works on consciousness, propositional attitudes, sense and\nreference. There are many other contemporary Colombian philosophers who\nare making significant contributions within the\nanalytic\n tradition.[36] \n\nIn Peru, analytic philosophy was introduced by Francisco Miró\nQuesada. In 1946 he published the first book in the area:\nLógica. He wrote many works on logic, deontic logic,\nphilosophy of mathematics, and also on the social and political reality\nof his\n country.[37]\nIn the 1970s\nhe founded, with Alberto Cordero, a program on philosophy\nof\n science.[38]\nIn the 1960s\nAugusto Salazar Bondy translated Moore and Wittgenstein and wrote a\nseries of essays on evaluative language, which was eventually published\nas a book in 1971 in\n Chile.[39] \n\nBeyond these isolated figures who left no students, only in the\ntwenty-first century do we find two small groups in Peru working on\nanalytic issues. At the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, Pablo\nQuintanilla leads an interdisciplinary group dedicated to the study of\nthe philosophy of language and mind and its evolution (Grupo Mente\ny Lenguaje). At the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos a small\ngroup led by Oscar Garcia Zárate who founded the Centro de\nestudios de filosofía analítica (CESFIA) in\n2006. CESFIA publishes the journal Analítica\n(though the Centro seems to function in some\nisolation from the rest of the Latin American analytic\nphilosophers). \n\nIn Uruguay, Carlos Vaz Ferreira introduced some ideas and texts from\nthe analytic tradition in the first half of the twentieth century, but\ndied very young in 1956 without leaving students. By the late 1950s\nEzra Heymann introduced Frege and Austin, and taught logic in\nMontevideo before moving to Venezuela. The most internationally\nrecognized Uruguayan philosopher was Mario Otero, who was educated in\nthe United States and exiled to the IIF-UNAM in the 1970’s. He\neventually returned to Uruguay with the return of democracy in the\n1980s and worked at the University of the Republic in the history of\nlogic and philosophy of science. His student, Lucía Leiwowicz,\ncontinues working on these issues. Also exiled in the 1970s, never to\nreturn to Uruguay, were Javier Sasso and Eduardo Piacenza who went to\nVenezuela and Carlos Pereda who went to the IIF-UNAM. Currently, the\nmost prominent philosopher in Uruguay is Carlos Enrique Caorsi who\nworks in philosophy of language with an emphasis on Davidson’s\nphilosophy. \n\nChile shows a certain isolation. Until the coup\nd’état in 1973, developments were limited to formal\nlogic by Juan Rivano, Gerold Stahl, and Rolando Chuaqui. Roberto\nTorretti, who was exiled to Puerto Rico, stands out. He made an early\nimpact with a well-regarded book on Kant published in 1967. These\nhistorical studies led to more systematic studies in the field of\nphilosophy of science and history of geometry, published in the 1990s.\nAlfonso Gómez Lobo took the opposite path as he first published\nSiete escritos sobre lógica y semántica in 1972\nbefore leaving analytic philosophy to engage with ancient philosophy\nwhen he was exiled to the United States. In the 1990s there were only a\ncouple of figures working on philosophy of mind and language\nin\n Chile.[40]\nIn the twenty-first\ncentury the analytic tradition grows, mostly due to the many\nphilosophers who returned to their country after\nstudies\n abroad.[41]\nThe Sociedad\nChilena de Filosofía Analítica was founded around\n2008. \n\nIn Venezuela, Juan David García Bacca, though not an analytic\nphilosopher himself, introduced authors from the analytic tradition in\nthe 1960s. Juan Nuño published Sentido de la\nfilosofía contemporánea in 1965, which included\nlogic and other analytic issues, and dealt with proper names and\nnativism in a book of formal logic published in 1973. Adolfo\nGarcía Díaz, of Mexican origin, worked in the 1960s in\nVenezuela on issues of logic, metaphysics, and history of philosophy.\nIn the 1970s, Venezuela, as did Mexico, welcomed political exiles such\nas Ernesto Batistella, Javier Sasso, and Eduardo Piacenza from Uruguay.\nThere were also more Venezuelans working within the analytic tradition\nat this time, including Rafael Burgos (Wittgenstein and ontology) and\nPedro Lluberes (ontology and philosophy of science). And in the 1980s,\nVictor Krebs worked on Wittgenstein’s philosophy and Vicenzo Lo\nMonaco on Davidson’s philosophy and interpretation theory,\nsemantics of proper names, and ontological commitments. \n\nIn Costa Rica, Claudio Gutierrez published papers in the area of\nphilosophy of logic, epistemology, philosophy of language and\nphilosophy of mind. Luis Camacho Naranjo makes contributions in epistemology\nand philosophy of science. Max Freund works on the \nlogics of sortals, modal logic, and in the logical, computational and philosophical consequences of conceptualism. \n\nIn Guatemala, Hector-Neri Castañeda (who later emigrated to\nthe United States) published several papers on consciousness and\nnormative logic in the late 1950s and on the private language argument\nin the early 1960s. From his workplace in the United States (Indiana\nUniversity) he collaborated with PhD students from Costa Rica,\nGuatemala, and Mexico. Similarly, other Latin American philosophers\nemigrated to the United States; a paradigmatic case is Ernesto Sosa, a\nCuban-born philosopher who studied and worked all his life in the\nUnited States who constantly sought to establish links with philosophy\nin Spanish, especially the analytic philosophers of Mexico and\nArgentina. \n\nThe growth of analytic philosophy in Latin America led to the\nfoundation in 2007 of the Asociación Latinoamericana de\nFilosofía Analítica (ALFAn) which brings together\nindividuals and institutions working in the analytic tradition in the\nregion. \n\nIn this section I will mention examples of original work developed\nby philosophers who have done most of their professional work in Latin\nAmerica within the analytic tradition. (For reasons of space, it is\nimpossible to be exhaustive). \n\nThe areas in which major original contributions have occurred are\nlogic, especially what might be called “philosophical\nlogic”, such as paraconsistent logic, belief dynamics and deontic\nlogic, and practical philosophy, due to the role analytic philosophy\nplayed in strengthening democracy in the region. Also important are the\ncontributions made on metaphilosophical issues arising from reflecting\non what “importing” philosophy implies. However, there are\nimportant contributions in all philosophical disciplines since Latin\nAmerican analytic philosophers have addressed most of the universal\nproblems posed by western philosophy. \n\nIn the case of theoretical philosophy, most research in Latin\nAmerica was not originated by local thoughts or interests, but by the\ninfluence of philosophers abroad, i.e., by the importation of\nphilosophical theories and standpoints. In the majority of cases the\nphilosophical ideas proposed are not in dialogue exclusively with other\nmembers of the Latin American community, but with the broader\ninternational community. There are, however, some exceptions in the\nfield of philosophical logic and philosophy of logic where important\ntraditions were born: paraconsistent logic and the logic of belief\nrevision. \n\nParaconsistent logic is one of the autochthonous philosophical\nproducts of Latin America. The idea behind these developments is simple\nand philosophically motivated: a logic is paraconsistent if the\nprinciple of non-contradiction is not valid in general; syntactically\nspeaking, “a logic is paraconsistent if it can be the basic logic\nof inconsistent but non-trivial theories” (Da Costa & Bueno\n2010: 221). As mentioned in the previous section, the father of these\nlogics is Newton da Costa who originated what has been called the\n“Brazilian school of\n paraconsistency”.[42] \n\nThe other leading figure in logic who birthed a research tradition\nwas Carlos Alchourrón. Besides his contribution in\ndeontic\n logic[43],\nAlchourrón was\nalso one of the first logicians to develop a logical system for belief\ndynamics (AGM). The key notions of this theory are revision\n(when we introduce a new piece of information into the current\nepistemic state and readjust the background information in such a way\nthat the new result is consistent), and contraction (when a\npiece of information is eliminated from an epistemic state)\n(Arló-Costa and Fermé 2010: 483). Developments produced\nby Alchourrón and collaborators (until his early death in 1996)\nincluded issues related to non-monotonic logic and developments in\nartificial\n intelligence.[44] \n\nA lesser known philosophical issue that originated and developed in\nLatin America is Orayen’s Paradox, baptized as such by\nAlchourrón (1987). Orayen’s paradox is a problem that Raul\nOrayen identified and originally presented at a symposium on Quine, in\nGranada in 1986 (Orayen 1992). It arises when the following\npropositions are asserted simultaneously: \nOne cannot simultaneously accept these two statements, because if we\nlook at (1), the set theory cannot be formalized in the sense of (2).\nOrayen not only presented this paradox, but also offered two possible\nsolutions. The first appeals to semantics based on the adoption of\nnatural language predicates to interpret formal predicates, i.e. it\nproposes a new way of interpreting the symbols of quantificational\nlanguage with a language that is already interpreted. The second\nsolution is inspired by the hierarchies developed in Russell’s\ntheory of types. Orayen’s Paradox produced many responses, among\nothers by W.V.O. Quine, Hilary Putnam, and William\n Hart[45],\nas well as famous logicians of the\nLatin American community, such as Atocha Aliseda, Agustin Rayo, Eduardo Barrio, Max Freund, Mario \nGómez-Torrente, Sandra Lazzer, Adolfo Garcia de la Sienra and Axel Barceló. The\nmain proposals around this paradox are included in Moretti and Hurtado\n(2003) and García de la Sienra (2008). \n\nBoth general and special philosophy of science, as well as the\nhistory and sociology of science, have been extensively studied in Lain\nAmerica. The intense activity in philosophy of science is reflected in\nthe regional institutions that have served as an impetus for its\ndevelopment. In Argentina, the Jornadas de epistemología e\nhistoria de la ciencia has been organized every year since 1989 by\na local group led by Victor Rodriguez, Marisa Velasco and Jose Ahumada.\nIn Chile, the Jornadas Rolando Chuaqui Kettlunen has been\norganized every year since 1999 in tribute to the distinguished\nmathematician, philosopher of science and Chilean thinker, Professor\nRolando Chuaqui Kettlun, perhaps the most important leader in\ndeveloping formal sciences in the country during the twentieth century.\nAmong the organizers are Andrés Bobenrieth, Rolando Rebolledo, José Tomás Alvarado, Guido Vallejos, Claudia\nMuñoz and Wilfredo Quezada. There is also an organization of\nregional scope, the Asociación de Filosofía e\nHistoria de la ciencia del Cono Sur (AFHIC), which was founded in\n2000 in order to promote ties among regional specialists and organize\nmeetings every two years in different member\n countries.[46]\nSee the entry on\n philosophy of science in Latin America\nfor a detailed revision of the main contributions to the\nfield. \n\nThe theory of knowledge is a popular discipline in Brazil, which is\nnot surprising since the origins of analytic philosophy in this country\nis associated with two figures— Porchat and Monteiro—who\nworked on skepticism and the foundation of science, followed by Plinio Junqueira-Smith and Paulo Faria. The main\ndevelopments in the field, not only in Brazil but also in the rest of\nLatin America, can be found in the entry on\n skepticism in Latin America\nand\nCresto 2010. Analytic metaphysics, on the contrary, has had little\ndevelopment in the region, with only a few\n exceptions.[47] \n\nPhilosophy of language and mind have had extensive development in\nthe region. Philosophical reflection on language, which is at the heart\nof analytic philosophy, is exhaustively spread throughout Latin\nAmerica. The first analytic publications in Latin America, by Alejandro\nRossi and Thomas Simpson, were devoted to this area, and they generated\nin their respective countries a strong tradition in philosophy of\nlanguage. As in the rest of the world, many philosophers originally\nconcerned with issues in philosophy of language turned to philosophy of\nmind in the 1980s. Thus, both philosophy of language and mind have had\na very homogeneous development throughout Latin\n America.[48]\nIn these topics the influence of\nforeign philosophy is apparent, but though the problems and arguments\naddressed were not born in Latin America, original contributions from\nLatin American philosophers can be found. Most of the research in the\nfield assumes a naturalistic approach, connecting recent developments\nin linguistics, cognitive sciences and neurosciences to deal with\nphilosophical issues about language and mind including theories of\nreference, contexualism, psychological and phenomenal concepts, the\nmind-body problem, understanding others, and theory of\n action.[49]\n The emotions, not always addressed in mainstream philosophy of mind,\nhave also been an object of philosophical reflection in\nthe\n region.[50] \n\nConcerning the classical\ndevelopments in analytic philosophy of language, Frege’s legacy\nhas been deeply studied in the\n region.[51] \n\nMany traditional questions of moral and political philosophy as well\nas that of philosophy of law have been addressed by Latin\nAmerican\n philosophers.[52]\nHowever, the\nsocial and political peculiarities of the region have produced specific\nissues which will be the topic of this section. \n\nPolitical instability prevailed in Lain America for most part of the\ntwentieth century. Almost all the countries in the region have suffered\ncoup d’ états, electoral fraud, cancellation of\nconstitutional rights, political persecutions; in sum, democracy has\nbeen a chimera. In most countries the political situation has changed\nin the last thirty years, and to some extent this was due to moral,\npolitical and law philosophers who produced an extensive discussion of\nthe foundation of democracy, human rights, and other related issues.\nFrom the economic point of view, Latin America was, and still is, a\nregion where most of the population live below the poverty line, the\ngap between the rich and poor is very large, health and education are\nsometimes “luxury” items that many people cannot access; in\nsum, economic inequalities, and therefore educational, cultural and\nhealth inequalities, abound. \n\nApplied ethics, especially bioethics, has seen ample and original\nphilosophical developments in Latin America. The political, economic,\nand social situation of the region has led to focused reflections on\nissues like\n abortion[53]\nand\nmedical practice and research on vulnerable subjects (Rivera\nLópez 2010: 365). The public commitment to ongoing debates that\nmatter to their local societies is an important feature of the analytic\nphilosophical tradition in the region. The philosophical reflections on\nabortion are a paradigmatic case to consider. In most Latin American\ncountries, unlike Europe and the US, abortion is not legal almost\nwithout exception, and many women have died or been imprisoned due to\nthis fact. Mexico has been a pioneer in the decriminalization of\nabortion, but it was not until 2007—and only in Mexico City, and\nnot in the rest of the country—that abortion was legalized. The\nMexican philosophical community was involved in the process that led to\nthis change. \n\nMargarita Valdés (1997, 2001b) has been a pioneer in this\nfield as her contributions aim to produce political impact (i.e.,\nchange existing laws), seeking to undermine the dogmatic thinking of\nthe vast majority of the population and legislators and emphasizing\nspecific issues such as child and adolescent pregnancy, pregnancy\nresulting from rape,\n etc.[54]\nValdés (2001a) presents the main arguments for and against the\nlegalization of abortion, and distinguishes three notions of a\n“person” in the arguments: the biological notion, the idea\nof a “potential” person, and the metaphysical and moral\nnotion of person. She finally shows that the more conservative\narguments cannot be held, because they either appeal to a notion of a\nperson which is not relevant to the moral question, or\nclaim—falsely—that the moral person is present at the very\nmoment of conception. \n\nGustavo Ortiz-Millán (2009), also in Mexico, makes a\nsystematic and comprehensive study of the issue of abortion where he\nconsiders the main ethical arguments for and against abortion, the\nreproductive rights of women, the conflict with the rights of the\nfetus, the rule of law in his country and the statistics related to the\ntopics under discussion, in addition to considering the pro-life\nconservative proposal of adoption, paternity rights, and politics and\npervading religious arguments. \n\nIn Argentina, Florencia Luna, Eduardo Rivera López and Arleen\nSalles have developed several lines of research in bioethics.\nInitially, some books with Spanish translations of leading papers in\nthe\n field[55]\nhave been\npublished, aiming to introduce into Spanish-speaking societies\nimportant issues such as problems raised by genetic knowledge and\ngenetic manipulation, euthanasia, abortion, reproductive rights, the\nprinciple of autonomy and the patient-physician relationship, justice\nand the right to health, experimentation on human subjects, organ\ntransplants, etc. But soon these philosophers developed their own work\nin the field, shifting from translating the work of others to producing\ntheir own original\n works[56].\nLuna (2006) focuses her research on vulnerable subjects, i.e.\n“people living in deprivation, oppression, and\npowerlessness—conditions that are all too common for many Latin\nAmericans” (Luna 2006: 1). Vulnerable subjects pose urgent\nquestions to a moral philosopher given paternalistic attitudes based on\nwide-spread illiteracy, denial of women’s reproductive rights,\nextremely restrictive legal circumstances with respect to abortion, and\nlack of sexual education and contraception information. Difficulties\nfound in biomedical research with vulnerable subjects involve a lack of\nrespect for research subjects, e.g. when researchers hide relevant\ninformation from the subjects, fail to request their informed consent,\nor take their case history without consent. Luna also addresses the\nquestion of post-trial obligations with experimental subjects, patents,\nand the intellectual property of biomedical\n findings.[57]\nRivera López (2011) deals with\nclassical ethical questions such as euthanasia, the challenges posed by\nnew technologies such as assisted reproduction, organ transplants and\ngenetic manipulation, but also addresses questions of distributive\njustice on health resources and services, medical technologies, the\nmoral problem of selling organs for transplant, among other issues. \n\nThe unstable political situation in Latin America during the\ntwentieth century characterized by repeated breaches of constitutional\norder led generations of philosophers to deal with issues related to\nthe foundations of law and human rights, including the general theory\nof ethics and human rights, the theory of democracy, the theory of\npunishment, and the general theory of legal norms. Garzón\nValdés (1998: 27) argues that one can genuinely speak of an\nArgentinian philosophy of law, and not just a philosophy of law made in\nArgentina, by virtue of its originality and impact. A central figure in\nphilosophy of law was Carlos Nino, not only because of the importance\nof his work outside of Latin America, but also for the great political\nand theoretical impact his work had in the region, including leaving a\nlong list of students who have strongly contributed to the development\nof these\n issues[58].\nOne of the\nmost significant political event contributing to the recovery of\ndemocracy was the 1985 trial of the military government that ruled\nArgentina from 1976 to 1983. \n\nThe human rights policy carried out by President Alfonsín was\nbased on theoretical discussions held in SADAF, led by Carlos Nino in\nthe early 1980s. The moral and legal considerations on which these\npolicies were based are developed in Nino 1996 (posthumous). This book\nincludes a historical background in which Nino reviews prior solutions\nto the systematic and governmental violation of human rights after a\nchange of government (such as the Nuremberg trial, Eichmann’s\ntrial, the lack of answers to previous human rights violations during\ndemocratic transitions in Europe in the 1970s, and in Eastern Europe in\nthe 1980s and 1990s,) as well as the situation in Asia, Africa, South\nAmerica, and Argentina, including the historical context of the\npolitical and legal decisions made by President Alfonsín. In the\nsecond part of the book, Nino analyzes the political, moral and legal\nproblems posed by the decision to prosecute human rights violators.\nSome of the main problems are: how to justify the retroactive\napplication of criminal justice, the diffusion of responsibility (since\nfor a massive violation of human rights, many people in different\npositions in the chain of command must be involved), under which laws\nthe accused should be judged, in which jurisdiction they should be\njudged, who is legally responsible for a violation of human rights (the\nperson who gave the order or the one who executed it) and whether the\ninternational community should intervene, among many other\nquestions. \n\nIt is natural that analytic philosophy, a tradition with roots\noutside Latin America, generated a philosophical revolution when it\narrived in the region. It is no wonder, then, that many Latin American\nanalytic philosophers have devoted their efforts to thinking about\nmetaphilosophical issues such as the methods and nature of philosophy,\nthe social role of philosophy, teaching methodologies, etc. The\nfounders of analytic philosophy in the region addressed these issues;\nRossi, Salmerón, Villoro, Miró Quesada, and Salazar Bondy\nsought for a scientific philosophy, first drawing on phenomenology and\nlater on analytic philosophy and logic as tools. Three recent\ndiscussions in this area are fundamental. \n\nThere has been significant contributions regarding the nature and\npractice of philosophy when a tradition is introduced and\ninstitutionalized in a given region, several public and private\ninstitutions founded to guide philosophical practice, and\nprofessionalism developed. Salmerón (1971) holds that philosophy\nin Latin America should maintain philosophical normality and\nprofessionalization, connect with science, and avoid metaphysical\nspeculation and literary style. Later he argues that there are two\naspects of philosophy: a critical one linked with science, and another\none concerned with the conception of the world, e.g. philosophy of\neducation and ethics. He seeks to reconcile these two aspects of\nphilosophy (Salmerón 1991).  \n\nMeanwhile, Hurtado (2007) distinguishes between theoretical\nmetaphilosophy and practical metaphilosophy (i.e. philosophical\nreflection on the conditions and problems posed by the concrete\npractice of philosophy in a given place and time) and argues that the\nlatter depends on theoretical metaphilosophy (i.e. the general\nconception of philosophy). \n\nRabossi’s posthumous book is a paradigmatic example of\nmetaphilosophical thinking in the region. Rabossi (2008) presents a\nvery original hypothesis about why philosophical practice has its\ncurrent characteristics based on a careful historical analysis of the\ninstitutionalization of philosophy resulting from the split between\nphilosophy and other theoretical disciplines in idealist German thought\nin the nineteenth century. The three provocative\n“conjectures” he develops in the book are: (1) Philosophy,\ni.e., what we conceive, practice and value as philosophy nowadays, is a\nyoung discipline only two hundred years old; (2) The long life usually\nattributed to philosophy is the result of a historical narrative also\nconceived two hundred years ago; and (3) Philosophy is an anomalous\ndiscipline (Rabossi 2008: 13). The history he reconstructs regarding\nthe split between philosophy and theology in the nineteenth century\nallows him to present the “philosophical canon” explicit or\nimplicit in philosophical practices, a decalogue of maxims guiding all\nphilosophical research across philosophical traditions. In the book, he\nalso engages in academic geopolitical issues, including the tension\nbetween a growing globalization of philosophy and the consolidation of\n“national philosophies” (such as French Philosophy, Latin\nAmerican Philosophy, etc.), and the relationship between the central\nand peripheral producers of\n philosophy.[59] \n\nA second issue that has been widely discussed is the teaching of\nphilosophy, both at the university and the secondary school level. The\nissue of teaching philosophy is entrenched with the conception of\nphilosophizing itself. For centuries, since colonial times, Latin\nAmerica was merely a receptor of philosophy produced in other regions.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, however, the debate around\nthe idea of an authentic Latin American philosophy was\nclearly\n settled[60],\nand both these\npolitical and academic movements, together with analytic philosophy\n(which usually focuses on problems and arguments rather than on figures\nand theories), helped question the traditional academic practices in\nthe region. The claim defended by many analytic philosophers in the\nregion was that teaching philosophy should promote original\nphilosophical thinking rather than merely reproducing the philosophical\ndevelopments of others. For instance, Gaos (1956) insisted on changing\nthe university curricula of philosophy, seeking to transform\neducational institutions in order to create philosophers able to\nproduce their own philosophies. Another powerful idea, proposed by\nRabossi and his research group, was to take seriously Kant’s\nclaim that philosophy cannot be taught but philosophizing can, and to\ndevelop a series of teaching strategies in order to instill in\nphilosophy students the relevant “know-how” proper to\nphilosophical practice (Rabossi 1987; González and Stigol 1993).\nTeaching philosophy is no longer considered merely a way of\ntransmitting information to students about historical figures and\ntheories (to give them propositional knowledge about philosophy);\ninstead, under a “critical model” of teaching philosophy\n(opposed to the traditional “dogmatic” model), teaching is\nseen as a way of promoting philosophical\n thinking.[61] \n\nFinally, the last notable metaphilosophical question regards the\nlanguage of philosophy. The fact that most analytic works are published\nin English and the current globalization of the profession push Latin\nAmerican analytic philosophers to produce philosophy in English\n(despite the fact that they work in countries whose native language is\nSpanish or Portuguese). This has generated much controversy concerning\nwhether or not to leave the native language while doing philosophy.\nSome opening lines of the controversy are presented in an issue of the\njournal Crítica (vol 54, no.133) with\ncontributions by Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, Marco Ruffino, Diana\nPérez, and Guillermo Hurtado. In 2014, a discussion on the\nsubject was held at the Cervantes Institute of\nHarvard\n University[62].\nOn the one side,\nRodriguez-Pereyra, Ruffino and Toribio argue that English should be\nconsidered the new Latin in the sense that English should be widely\nadopted as the proper language to write philosophy in given pragmatic\nprofessional reasons and ideal reasons of having a common language to\ncommunicate within the analytic community. On the other hand,\nPérez, Hurtado, and Gracia, among others, defend the idea that\npracticality is not the only relevant factor to consider when deciding\nwhich language is chosen for communication as there are also political,\ncultural, linguistic, contextual, and experiential reasons to take into\naccount. Moreover, the shared experience has been that choosing what\nlanguage to communicate one’s ideas in is not a neutral process\nbecause (1) there are issues concerning translation that are important\nto philosophy and using a plurality of languages often helps the author\nimprove her ideas; and (2) language is not only a means to communicate\nideas which are already established in our minds, but a vehicle which\ncontributes to the shaping of our ideas. \n\nThe development of analytic philosophy in Latin America since its\nintroduction over the past sixty years has been impressive not only in\nthe originality of many of the contributions, but also in the\ninternational impact that philosophers who live and work in the region\nhave achieved. Thus, Latin America today is not only an importer of\nanalytic philosophy, but also a producer of analytic philosophy. More\nand more resources are becoming available in the region, which\nforetells a prolific future for the analytic tradition in Latin\nAmerica. Globalization and technological resources that allow faster\ncommunication have contributed to this development. The more stable\ndemocratic political regimes of the past thirty years have also\npromoted research, freedom of expression, and critical thought in the\nregion. \n\nMoreover, globalization and increased resources of the area have\nenabled Latin American philosophers to be more closely connected to\neach other, which favors the development of a Latin American\nphilosophical\n community.[63]\nIndeed, there are lines of inquiry arising from the political, social,\nand cultural needs of the region that have enabled the development of\noriginal philosophical production in the past. These developments will\nsurely establish themselves and multiply in the years to come.","contact.mail":"dianazerep@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
