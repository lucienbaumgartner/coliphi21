He is best\nremembered for a novel critique of anthropomorphism in religion, a\npartial advance toward monotheism, and some pioneering reflections on\nthe conditions of knowledge. Many later writers, perhaps influenced by\ntwo brief characterizations of Xenophanes by Plato (Sophist\n242c–d) and Aristotle (Metaphysics 986b18-27), identified him\nas the founder of Eleatic philosophy (the view that, despite\nappearances, what there is is a changeless, motionless, and eternal\n‘One’). In fact, the Xenophanes who emerges from the\nsurviving fragments defies simple classification. He was a travelling\nrhapsode who criticised the stories about the gods told by the poets,\nand he defended a novel conception of the divine nature. But he was\nalso a reflective observer of the human condition, a practitioner of\nthe special form of ‘inquiry’ (historiê)\nintroduced by the Milesian philosopher-scientists, and a civic\ncounselor who encouraged his fellow citizens to respect the gods and\nwork to safeguard the well-being of their city.\n\n\n\nIn his Lives of the Philosophers (Diels-Kranz, testimonium\nA1), Diogenes Laertius reports that Xenophanes was born in the small\nIonian town of Colophon and flourished during the sixtieth Olympiad\n(540–537 BCE). Laertius adds that when Xenophanes was\n“banished from his native city” he “joined the\ncolony planted at Elea” (in Italy), and also lived at Zancle and\nCatana (two Greek communities in Sicily). He credits Xenophanes with\ncomposing verses “in epic meter, as well as elegiacs and iambics\nattacking Hesiod and Homer and denouncing what they said about the\ngods”, with reciting his own works, and with composing poems on\nthe founding of Colophon and Elea. Later writers add that “he\nburied his sons with his own hands”, was sold into slavery, and\nlater released from it. By Xenophanes’ own account (B8) he\n“tossed about the Greek land” for sixty-seven years,\nstarting at the age of twenty-five. \n\nDiels-Kranz (DK) provides 45 fragments of his poetry (although B4,\n13, 19, 20, 21 and 41 would be more accurately classified as\ntestimonia), ranging from the 24 lines of B1 to the\nsingle-word fragments of B21a, 39, and 40. A number of the\n‘sympotic poems’ (poems for drinking parties) (B1–3, 5, 6,\n22, and the imitation in C2) were preserved by Athenaeus, while the\nremarks on the nature of the divine were quoted by Clement (B14–16 and\n23), Sextus Empiricus (B11, 12, and 24), and Simplicius (B25 and 26).\nOther snippets survive in the accounts by Diogenes Laertius and\nAëtius, or as marginal notes in our manuscripts of various\nauthors, or as entries in later rhetorical summaries and dictionaries.\nSeventy-four selections, of which the most extensive is the\npseudo-Aristotelian treatise On Melissus, Xenophanes, Gorgias\n(MXG), make up the collection of testimonia in DK.\nLaertius’ statement (A1) that Xenophanes “wrote in epic meter,\nalso elegiacs, and iambics” is confirmed by extant poems in\nhexameters and elegiac meter, with one couplet (B14) a combination of\nhexameter and iambic trimeter. Ancient writers referred to a number of\nhis compositions as silloi—‘squints’ or\nsatires, and a critical tone pervades many of the surviving fragments.\nThree late sources credit Xenophanes with a didactic poem under the\ntitle Peri Phuseôs (“On Nature”) but not\nevery allusion to an earlier author’s views “on nature” represented a\nreference to a single work on that subject. \n\nFragments B11 and B12 describe, and implicitly criticize, the\nstories about the gods told by Homer and Hesiod. \n\nThe basis for Xenophanes’ unhappiness with the poets’ accounts is\nnot explained, but we may infer from the concluding call to pay due\nhonor to the gods in Xenophanes’ B1 that an attribution of scandalous\nconduct would be incompatible with the goodness or perfection any\ndivine being must be assumed to possess (cf. Aristotle Meta.\n1072b; Plato, Rep. 379b.) \n\nIn the well-known fragments B14-16, Xenophanes comments on the\ngeneral tendency of human beings to conceive of divine beings in human\nform: \n\nB15 adds, probably in a satirical vein, that if horses and oxen had\nhands and could draw pictures, their gods would look remarkably like\nhorses and oxen. B17, “…and bacchants of pine stand round\nthe well-built house” may represent a criticism of the common\nancient belief that a god could assume possession of a physical object\nso as to offer protection to its possessor. The ridiculing of\nPythagoras’ claim to have recognized the soul of a departed friend in\nthe voice of a barking dog (B7), together with the attacks on\ndivination credited to Xenophanes in A52, reflect the broader denial of\nknowledge of divine attributes and operations set out in B34.\nXenophanes is prepared to offer a positive account of the nature of the\ndeity (see the following section) but his position appears to be that\nwhile no mortal being will ever know about the gods with any degree of\ncertainty, we can at least avoid adopting beliefs and practices clearly\nat odds with the special nature any divine being must be assumed to\npossess. \n\nSo far as is known, Xenophanes was the first Greek thinker to offer\na complex and at least partially systematic account of the divine\nnature. We have already noted how an implicit assumption of divine\nperfection may underlie his criticisms of Homer, Hesiod, and the\ntendency to imagine the gods in human form. Of the positive\ncharacterizations of the divine made in B23–26, perhaps the most\nfundamental is B23: \n\nAlthough the remark has often been read as a pioneering expression\nof monotheism, this reading is made problematic by the nearby reference\nto ‘gods’ in the plural in the first line and the\npossibility that Xenophanes sought to highlight not the one\ngod but rather the one greatest god (cf. Homer, Iliad\n12, 243 for the use of ‘one’ (Greek heis)\nreinforcing a superlative). The relevant measures of divine\n‘greatness’ are not specified, but the two most obvious\nchoices would be greatness in honor and power, with honor perhaps the\nmore basic of the two (cf. Iliad 2, 350; 2, 412; 4, 515;\nOd. 3, 378; 5,4; Hesiod, Theogony 49, 534, 538,\netc.). Greatness in power would in turn explain the characterizations\nof the divine as perceptive and conscious in all its parts (B24), able\nto shake all things by the exercise of his thought (B25), and able to\naccomplish everything while remaining forever in the same place or\ncondition (B26). It is unclear, however, how far Xenophanes himself\nrealized the interconnections among the different divine attributes or\nsought to exploit those connections for didactic purposes. At least as\nthey have come down to us, none of the remarks on the divine nature\n(B23–26) contains any of the inferential particles (gar, epei, oun,\nhoti, etc.) one would normally expect to find in a piece of\nreasoned discourse. \n\nSome later writers (A28.6, 31.2, 34–36) report that Xenophanes\nidentified his ‘one greatest god’ with the entire physical\nuniverse—often termed ‘the whole’ or ‘all\nthings’, and some modern accounts portray Xenophanes as a\npantheist. But this understanding of Xenophanes’ doctrines seems\ninconsistent with his assertion that “god shakes all\nthings” (B25) that “all things are from the earth and to\nthe earth all things come in the end” (B27), and that “all\nthings which come into being and grow, are earth and water”\n(B29). On the whole, Xenophanes’ remarks on the divine nature are\nperhaps best read as an expression of a traditional Greek piety: there\nexists a being of extraordinary power and excellence, and it is\nincumbent on each of us to hold it in high regard. \n\nFive fragments touch on traditional subjects of Greek sympotic\nverse—on proper conduct at symposia (drinking parties), the\nmeasures of personal excellence, and the existence of various human\nfoibles or failures. Xenophanes appears to have been particularly\ninterested in identifying and discouraging conduct that failed to pay\ndue honor to the gods or posed a risk to the stability and well-being\nof the city (or perhaps both). Although these passages may be\ninsufficiently abstract and demonstrative in character to count as\n‘philosophical teachings’, they do represent an important\nbridge between Greek poetry of the archaic period and the kind of\nmoral theorizing practiced by many 5th and 4th-century\nthinkers. Xenophanes’ disparagement of the honors accorded to athletes\n(B2), his call to censor the stories the poets tell about the gods\n(B1), and counsel to live a life of moderation (B3 and 5, and perhaps\nB21) all anticipate views expressed in Plato’s Republic\n(cf. 607a, 378b, 372b.)  His criticism of the pursuit of useless\nluxuries (B3) also anticipates Socrates’ rebuke of his fellow citizens\nfor caring more about wealth and power than about virtue\n(cf. Apology 30b.) His cautionary remarks about knowledge\n(B34) and reminder of the subjectivity of human taste (B38: “If\ngod had not made yellow honey, they would think that figs were far\nsweeter”) also reflect a traditional view of human judgment as\nlimited and conditioned by personal experience. In each of these\nareas, Xenophanes’ social commentary represents a continuation of the\nGreek poetic tradition as well as a step toward explicit philosophical\ntheorizing. \n\nWe may reasonably conclude from several surviving fragments and a\nlarge number of testimonia that Xenophanes was well aware of\nthe teachings of the Milesian philosopher-scientists (Thales,\nAnaximander, and Anaximenes), and sought to improve on them. While many\nof the details of his own ‘scientific’ views remain\nobscure, the range and interconnectedness of his interests make him an\nimportant figure in the development of Ionian scientific theory.\nTheodoretus, Stobaeus, and Olympiodorus (all in A 36) credit him with a\nview of earth as the archê or “first\nprinciple” of all things. Yet Galen (also in A36) rejects this\nattribution, and B29 equates “all things which come into being\nand grow” with “earth and water”. A\ntwo-substance archê would, moreover, be compatible with\nthe many references to physical mixtures. A33 credits Xenophanes with a\nview of the sea as containing many mixtures, while B37 notes the\npresence of water in rocky caves, and A50 reports a view of the soul as\nearth and water. Insofar as some natural bodies are described as\nconsisting entirely of water (or of a part of water, as in A46 where\n“the sweet portion” of the water is drawn up from the sea\nand separated off), it would be best to understand Xenophanes’\n“two-substance theory” in a distributed sense: all things\nare either earth, or water, or earth combined with water. \n\nXenophanes appears to have explored many of the same phenomena\nstudied at an earlier date by the Milesians. B28 presents a view of the\nnature and extent of the earth’s depths; B30 identifies the sea as the\nsource of clouds, wind, and rain; B32 comments on the nature of Iris\n(rainbow); B37 notes the presence of water in caves; B39 and 40 mention\n“cherry trees” and “frogs”; A38–45 discuss\nvarious astronomical phenomena, and A48 indicates an interest in\nperiodic volcanic eruptions in Sicily. Hippolytus (A33) credits\nXenophanes with a theory of alternating periods of world-wide flood and\ndrought that was inspired, at least in part, by the discovery of\nfossilized remains of sea creatures at inland locations. Whether or not\nXenophanes himself traveled to Syracuse, Paros, and Malta where these\nremains were found, his use of this information as the basis for a\nbroad explanation of phenomena is an implicit testimonial to the\nheuristic value of information gained through travel and\nobservation. \n\nMany testimonia credit Xenophanes with an interest in\nmeteorological and astronomical phenomena. Not only are these comments\nof interest in their own right, they also present us what was arguably\nhis single most important scientific contribution--his contention that\nclouds or cloud-like substances play a basic role in a great many\nnatural phenomena. The term nephos (“cloud”)\nappears only twice in the fragments of his work (in B30 and 32) but\nmany testimonia either bear directly on the nature of clouds\nor make use of clouds in order to explain the nature of other\nphenomena. To cite an example of the first type, according to Diogenes\nLaertius “he says…the clouds are formed by the sun’s vapor\n[i.e. vapor caused by the heat from the sun’s rays] raising and lifting\nthem to the surrounding air” (A1.24–5). Aëtius (A46)\nprovides a similar account: \n\nB30 gives us essentially the same view in Xenophanes’ own words: \n\nHaving accounted for the formation of clouds in mechanistic terms\nthrough processes of vaporization and compression Xenophanes proceeds\nto make use of clouds to explain a large number of meteorlogical and\nastronomical phenomena. The general claim appears in the\npseudo-Plutarch Miscellanies: “he says that the sun and\nthe stars come into being from the clouds” (A32), and Aëtius\ngives us many specific applications:\n \n\nThe sort of fires that appear on ships--whom some call the Dioscuri\n[St. Elmo’s fire]--are tiny clouds glimmering in virtue of the sort of\nmotion they have (A39). \n\nThe sun consists of burning clouds…a mass of little fires,\nthemselves constructed from the massing together of the moist\nexhalation (A40). \n\nThe moon is compressed cloud (A43). \n\nAll things of this sort [comets, shooting stars, meteors] are either\ngroups or movements of clouds (A44). \n\nFlashes of lightning come about through the shining of the clouds\nbecause of the movement (A45). \n\nAs it happens, clouds are natural candidates for the\nexplanans in a scientific account. Since they are midway in\nform between a solid and gaseous state they are easily linked with\nsolids, liquids, and gases of various kinds. And since they occupy a\nregion midway between the surface of the earth and the upper regions of\nthe heavens, they are well positioned to link the two basic substances\nof earth and water with many astronomical phenomena. \n\nAnother important feature of Xenophanes’ cloud-based approach to\nunderstanding natural phenomena is the application of this theory to a\nset of phenomena closely linked with traditional religious belief. We\nhave already seen this in the thoroughly naturalistic accounts given of\nthe “great sea”, sun, moon, and stars, but nowhere is the\ncontrast of the old and new ways of thinking more evident than in his\ncomments on “Iris”--rainbow: \n\nFor the members of Xenophanes’ audience “Iris” referred\nto the messenger goddess of Homer’s Iliad (2, 686) and\nHesiod’s Theogony (780) and a set of atmospheric phenomena\n(halos, coronae, and cloud iridescence) commonly considered portents or\nsigns of the intentions of divine beings. As the daughter of Thaumas\n(“marvel”) Iris was the natural marvel par\nexcellence. Yet for Xenophanes, ‘she’ is really an\n‘it’ and a ‘this’ (the Greek neuter\ndemonstrative touto), by nature a purple, red, and\ngreenish-yellow cloud. It is, moreover, something that is there for us\n‘to behold’ or ‘to look at’\n(idesthai). Perhaps nowhere in presocratic philosophy can we\nfind a clearer expression of the character of the Ionian\n‘intellectual revolution’—a decision to put aside an\nolder way of thinking about events grounded in a belief in divine\nbeings in favor of an approach to understanding the world that employs\nwide-ranging inquiry and direct observation and resorts to strictly\nphysical causes and forces. Having deprived the gods of human form and\nclothing and removed the divine to some permanent and distant location,\nXenophanes proceeds to strip a wide range of natural phenomena of all\nvestiges of religious or spiritual significance. His de-mythologized\naccount of natural phenomena is, in short, the logical complement to\nhis thoroughly de-naturalized account of the divine nature. \n\nDespite its several virtues, Xenophanes’ physical theory appears to\nhave had little impact on later thinkers. Anaxagoras followed his lead\non the nature of the rainbow (cf. DK 59 B19) and Empedocles knew (but\nrepudiated) his claim of the earth’s indefinitely extended depths (DK\n31 B39). But both Plato and Aristotle appear to have ignored\nXenophanes’ scientific views or assigned them little importance. One\nfactor that may have contributed to this chilly reception was the\nabsence of any expression by Xenophanes of the kind of commitment to\nteleology that both Plato and Aristotle regarded as essential to a\nproper understanding of the cosmos. Xenophanes’ universe is controlled\nby a set of forces, but it is never described as “heading toward\nthe best” nor is it directed toward some best result by a\ncontrolling intelligence. (Xenophanes’ divine does “shake all\nthings” by the thought of his mind (alone), but he is never\ndescribed as in any way directing or controlling particular events.) It\nis also obvious that Xenophanes’ heavenly bodies would have fallen far\nshort of the level of perfection that, with Aristotle, became a\nhallmark of classical astronomical theory. Not only are Xenophanes’\nheavenly bodies not divine beings, they undergo creation and\ndestruction at regular intervals. Only from the perspective of a much\nlater period can the merits of Xenophanes’ scientific views be fairly\nappreciated. Many centuries would have to pass before an emphasis on\ndirect observation and the use of entirely natural causes and forces\nwould become the scientific orthodoxy. \n\nFive surviving fragments and roughly a dozen testimonia\naddress what might be termed ‘epistemological\nquestions’—“How much can any mortal being hope to\nknow?”, “Does truth come to us through our own efforts or\nby divine revelation?”, and “What role do our sense\nfaculties play in the acquisition of knowledge?” Unfortunately,\nthe picture that emerges from many of the testimonia largely\ncontradicts what appear to be the views Xenophanes himself\nexpressed. According to the summary in the\npseudo-Plutarch Miscellanies, Xenophanes “declares that\nthe senses are deceptive and generally rejects reason along with\nthem” (A32.) Similarly, in his Concerning Philosophy\nAristocles reports that “…since they think that sense\nperceptions and appearances must be rejected and trust only\nreason. For at one earlier time Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, and\nMelissus said something of this sort” (A49). Similarly,\nAëtius declares that “Pythagoras, Empedocles, and\nXenophanes (say that) sense perceptions are deceptive”\n(A49). Yet, as we have noted, B28 refers without qualification to\n“the upper limit of the earth that is seen (horatai)\nhere at our feet” and B32 appears to encourage those in\nXenophanes’ audience to ‘look at’ or ‘observe’\n(idesthai) the multi-colored cloud that is the rainbow. The\nrealistic description of the sumptuous banquet in B1 and the wide\nrange of Xenophanes’ reported geographical and geological interests\nall sit poorly with an Eleatic “rationalism” that would\ndismiss all information gained through our faculties of sense and\nconstruct on the basis of reason alone a view of “what is”\nas a motionless, changeless and eternal unity. \n\nXenophanes’ most extended comment on knowledge is B34: \n\nPortions of these remarks were quoted, and thereby preserved for\nposterity, by the ancient skeptics who hailed Xenophanes as the founder\nof their particular variety of philosophical skepticism. Recent\ninterpretations of B34 reject the skeptical interpretation in favor of\nother less extreme readings. On some accounts, B34 is concerned to deny\nonly a direct perceptual awareness. Others find in his comments a\ndistinction between natural science, where only probabilities can be\nachieved, and theology, where certainty is possible. Still others read\nXenophanes’ remarks as a blanket endorsement of\n“fallibilism”—the view that while each individual is\nfree to express his or her opinion, the possibility of error can never\nbe completely excluded. \n\nSince B34 opens with the phrase “and indeed…” it\nis likely that we do not have the whole of the remark, or all the\npremises from which its main conclusion was intended to follow.\nHowever, the use of the term saphes (“clear”, in\nthe first line of the fragment) by Xenophanes’ Ionian contemporary, the\nhistorian Herodotus, provides a helpful clue to the logic of the\nargument. At several points in his History Herodotus speaks of\nwhat is saphes, or what can be known in a\nsapheôs manner, as what can be confirmed to be the case\non the basis of first-hand observation: \n\nSince the gods were believed to inhabit a realm far removed from that of\nmortal beings, it would be natural for Xenophanes to hold that no\naccount of their nature and activities could possibly be confirmed on\nthe basis of first-hand observation, hence known for certain to be\ncorrect. And since the pioneering cosmological accounts put forward by\nhis Milesian predecessors held that a single material substance\nunderlay phenomena in all places and times it would be equally\nimpossible for any individual to confirm such a universal claim on the\nbasis of first-hand observation, hence know for certain that it was\ntrue—even if in fact it was true. The sentiments expressed in lines\nthree and four can be read as reinforcing this cautionary sentiment.\nTheir point would be that no one (moreover) should be credited with\nknowledge (of the certain truth concerning the gods or the nature of\nall things) simply on the basis of having correctly described, perhaps\neven predicted, individual events as they take place (perhaps a\nreference to self-styled paragons of wisdom and predictors of events\nsuch as Epimenides and Pythagoras). The overall message of B34, from\nits opening reference to “no man” to its concluding phrase\n“fashioned for all” would have been that there never has\nbeen nor ever will be anyone who has the capacity to achieve certainty\nwith respect to these important matters. \n\nXenophanes’ reference to a second-best level of comprehension or\nawareness—‘opinion’ or ‘conjecture’\n(dokos) should not be read as inherently negative or\ndismissive. By Platonic standards, opinion—even when\ncorrect—would be an inferior possession, unstable and subject to\nremoval through persuasion. But we have no reason to assume that\nXenophanes shared Plato’s view on this topic. And in fact B35, quoted\nby Plutarch in connection with encouraging a bashful speaker to\nexpress his views, appears to present what one ‘opines’ or\nbelieves in a fairly positive light: \n\nThe similarity between the verbal dedoxasthô of B35\nand the nominative dokos of B34 permits us to combine the two\nfragmentary remarks into a single coherent view: of course there can be\nno knowledge of the certain truth concerning the gods and the basic\nprinciples governing the cosmos, but dokos—opinion or\nconjecture—is available and should be accepted when it corresponds\nwith how things really are. \n\nThe full sense of B36, however, may never be determined. Neither its\ncontext (a grammatical treatise of Herodian) nor its wording\n(“…however many they have made evident for mortals to look\nupon”) provides definitive guidance. Perhaps Xenophanes was\nseeking to set an upper limit to the range of things that can be known\nby human beings (i.e. to caution others that they could know only as\nmany as things as the gods had made available to them to experience).\nBut it is equally possible that the remark was intended (as B32 above)\nto encourage the members of his audience to explore and inquire on\ntheir own (i.e. to encourage them to investigate “however many\nthings” the gods have made available to them to experience). \n\nB18 has often been hailed as an expression of an optimistic outlook\nor “faith in human progress”—the conviction that\nhumankind has made and will continue to make improvements in the arts\nand conditions of life generally. Yet none of the other surviving\nfragments reflects such an optimism and several (e.g. B2 and 3) suggest\nthat Xenophanes was not at all optimistic about his city’s prospects\nfor survival. In the light of his reported repudiation of divination\n(A52), de-mythologizing of various natural phenomena (B30 and 32), and\nevident enthusiasm for inquiry into a wide range of subjects, B18 is\nperhaps best read as an expression of faith in the value of\n‘inquiry’ or ‘seeking’ as the preferred\napproach to gaining knowledge of ‘all things’. \n\nTo sum up: Xenophanes’ attitude toward knowledge appears to have\nbeen the product of two distinct impulses. While he believed that\ninquiry in the form of travel and direct observation was capable of\nyielding useful information about the nature of things, he remained\nsufficiently under the influence of an older piety to want to caution\nothers against seeking to understand matters that lay beyond the limits\nof all human experience. Here, as in other aspects of his thought,\nXenophanes stands with one foot in the world of the archaic poet and\nthe other in the “new science” of the late 6th and early\n5th centuries BCE \n\nMany later writers identified Xenophanes as the teacher of\nParmenides and the founder of the Eleatic “school of\nphilosophy”—the view that, despite appearances, what there is\nis a motionless, changeless, and eternal ‘One’. This view\nof Xenophanes is based largely on Plato’s reference to “our\nEleatic tribe, beginning from Xenophanes as well as even earlier”\n(Sophist 242d) and Aristotle’s remark that “...with\nregard to the whole universe, he says that the one is the god”\n(Meta. A5, 986b18), along with some verbal similarities\nbetween Xenophanes’ description of the “one greatest, unmoving\ngod” and Parmenides’ account of a “motionless, eternal, and\nunitary being”. But the Xenophanes who speaks to us in the\nsurviving fragments is a combination of rhapsode, social critic,\nreligious teacher, and keen student of nature. Euripides’\nHeracles 1341 ff. echoes his attack on the stories told about\nthe gods by Homer and Hesiod (B11–12) and a passage of Euripides’\nAutolycus quoted by Athenaeus (C2) repeats portions of the\nattack on the honors accorded to athletes delivered in B2. In the\nRepublic, Plato shows himself the spiritual heir of\nXenophanes when he states that the guardians of his ideal state are\nmore deserving of honors and public support than the victors at\nOlympia, criticizes the stories told about the gods by the poets, and\ncalls for a life of moderate desire and action. A pronounced ethic of\nmoderation, sometimes bordering on asceticism, runs through much of\nancient Greek ethical thought, beginning with Solon and Xenophanes and\ncontinuing through Socrates and Plato to the Epicureans and\nCynics. Xenophanes’ conception of a “one greatest\ngod” who “shakes all things by the thought (or will) of\nhis mind” (noou phreni) may have helped to encourage\nHeraclitus’ belief in an ‘intelligence’\n(gnômê) that steers all things (B41),\nAnaxagoras’ account of the nous that orders and\narranges all things (B12), and Aristotle’s account of a\ndivine nous that inspires a movement toward perfection\nwithout actually doing anything toward bringing it about\n(Metaphysics Lambda.) \n\nIn his Dictionnaire historique et critique (1697) Pierre Bayle began\nthe modern philosophical discussion of the problem of evil by quoting\nXenophanes’ remark (as reported in Diogenes Laertius 9.19) that\n“most things give way to mind” (ta polla\nhêssô nou). Accepting the conjecture proposed by the\nclassical scholar Méric Casaubon, Bayle took Xenophanes to be\nasserting that God was unable to make all things conform to his\nbenevolent will. Bayle then assembled a set of texts in support of the\nview that in fact the amount of evil in the universe far exceeds the\namount of good. Bayle’s article sparked a reply from Leibniz (in\nhis Théodicée of 1710). In his Candide (1759), Voltaire\nsupported Bayle’s view by ridiculing Leibniz’s contention\nthat this is the best of all possible worlds.\n\nAlthough there may be no direct line of influence, we may also\nconsider Feuerbach’s critique of religious belief as a\n‘projection’ of human attributes, and Freud’s analysis of\nreligious belief as an instance of ‘wish-fulfillment’, as\ntwo modern successors to Xenophanes’ observation of the general\ntendency of human beings to conceive of divine beings in terms of their\nown attributes and capacities. \n\nXenophanes’ most enduring philosophical contribution was arguably\nhis pioneering exploration of the conditions under which human beings\ncan achieve knowledge of the certain truth. The distinction between\nknowledge and true opinion set out in B34 quickly became an axiom of\nancient Greek accounts of knowledge and survives in modern garb as the\n‘belief’ and ‘truth’ conditions of the\n‘standard’ or ‘tripartite analysis’ of\nknowledge. It can be plausibly argued that every later Greek thinker,\nat least until the time of Aristotle, undertook to respond to the basic\nchallenge posed in Xenophanes’ B34—how, given the severely limited\ncharacter of human experience, anyone can plausibly claim to have\ndiscovered the truth about matters lying beyond anyone’s capacity to\nobserve first-hand. Xenophanes may also be credited with expanding the\nrange of topics considered appropriate for philosophical inquiry and\ndiscussion. His Ionian predecessors had initiated the study of\nphenomena “above the heavens and below the earth” but, so\nfar as we know, they did not turn their critical fire against the\nleading poets of ancient Greece nor did they seek through their\nteachings to correct or improve the conduct of their fellow citizens.\nAlthough many aspects of his thought remain the subject of scholarly\ndebate, Xenophanes was clearly a multi-dimensional thinker who left his\nmark on many aspects of later Greek thought.","contact.mail":"jlesher@email.unc.edu","contact.domain":"email.unc.edu"}]
