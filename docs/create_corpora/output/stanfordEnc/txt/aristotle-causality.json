If successful, such an investigation\nresults in causal knowledge; that is, knowledge of the relevant or\nappropriate causes. The emphasis on the concept of cause explains why\nAristotle developed a theory of causality which is commonly known as\nthe doctrine of the four causes. For Aristotle, a firm grasp of what a\ncause is, and how many kinds of causes there are, is essential for a\nsuccessful investigation of the world around us.\n\n\nAs will become clear in due course, Aristotle is committed to a form\nof causal pluralism (Stein 2011: 121–147). For\nAristotle, there are four distinct and irreducible kinds of causes.\nThe focus of this entry is on the systematic interrelations among\nthese four kinds of causes.\n\nAristotle was not the first thinker to engage in a causal\ninvestigation of the world around us. From the very beginning, and\nindependently of Aristotle, the investigation of the natural world\nconsisted in the search for the relevant causes of a variety of\nnatural phenomena. From the Phaedo, for example, we learn\nthat the so-called “inquiry into nature” consisted in a\nsearch for “the causes of each thing; why each thing comes into\nexistence, why it goes out of existence, why it exists” (96 a\n6–10). In this tradition of investigation, the search for causes\nwas a search for answers to the question “why?”. Both in\nthe Physics and in the Metaphysics Aristotle places\nhimself in direct continuity with this tradition. At the beginning of\nthe Metaphysics, Aristotle offers a concise review of the\nresults reached by his predecessors (Metaph. I 3–7).\nFrom this review we learn that all his predecessors were engaged in an\ninvestigation that eventuated in knowledge of one or more of the\nfollowing causes: material, formal, efficient and final cause.\nHowever, Aristotle makes it very clear that all his predecessors\nmerely touched upon these causes (Metaph. 988 a 22–23;\nbut see also 985 a 10–14 and 993 a 13–15). That is to say,\nthey did not engage in their causal investigation with a firm grasp of\nthese four causes. They lacked a complete understanding of the range\nof possible causes and their systematic interrelations. Put\ndifferently, and more boldly, their use of causality was not\nsupported by an adequate theory of causality. According to\nAristotle, this explains why their investigation, even when it\nresulted in important insights, was not entirely successful. \nThis insistence on the doctrine of the four causes as an indispensable\ntool for a successful investigation of the world around us explains\nwhy Aristotle provides his reader with a general account of the four\ncauses. This account is found, in almost the same words, in\nPhysics II 3 and Metaphysics V 2. \nIn the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle places the following\ncrucial condition on proper knowledge: we think we have knowledge of a\nthing only when we have grasped its cause (APost. 71 b\n9–11. Cf. APost. 94 a 20). That proper knowledge is\nknowledge of the cause is repeated in the Physics: we think\nwe do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why,\nthat is to say, its cause (Phys. 194 b 17–20). Since\nAristotle obviously conceives of a causal investigation as the search\nfor an answer to the question “why?”, and a why-question\nis a request for an explanation, it can be useful to think of a cause\nas a certain type of explanation. \nNeedless to say, not all why-questions are requests for an explanation\nthat identifies a cause, let alone a cause in the particular sense\nenvisioned by Aristotle. Still, Aristotle is clearly committed to the\nview that giving the relevant cause (or causes) is necessary and\nsufficient for offering a scientific explanation. His conception of a\ncause has both a metaphysical and an epistemological\n component. Part of the challenge for us is to do justice to both\ncomponents. Following a recent suggestion, we may say that\n“causes are not ways in which we explain things, except\nderivatively, in virtue of the fact that they are ways in which some\nelements of the natural world explain others” (Stein 2012a:\n705). \nIn Physics II 3 and Metaphysics V 2, Aristotle\noffers his general account of the four causes. This account is general\nin the sense that it applies to everything that requires an\nexplanation, including artistic production and human action. Here\nAristotle recognizes four kinds of things that can be given in answer\nto a why-question: \nAll the four (kinds of) causes may enter in the explanation of\nsomething. Consider the production of an artifact like a bronze\nstatue. The bronze enters in the explanation of the production of the\nstatue as the material cause. Note that the bronze is not\nonly the material out of which the statue is made; it is also the\nsubject of change, that is, the thing that undergoes the change and\nresults in a statue. The bronze is melted and poured in order to\nacquire a new shape, the shape of the statue. This shape enters in the\nexplanation of the production of the statue as the formal\ncause. However, an adequate explanation of the production of a\nstatue requires also a reference to the efficient cause or\nthe principle that produces the statue. For Aristotle, this principle\nis the art of bronze-casting the statue (Phys. 195 a 6–8. Cf.\nMetaph. 1013 b 6–9). \nThis result is mildly surprising and requires a few words of\nelaboration. There is no doubt that the art of bronze-casting resides\nin an individual artisan who is responsible for the production of the\nstatue. According to Aristotle, however, all the artisan does in the\nproduction of the statue is the manifestation of specific knowledge.\nThis knowledge, not the artisan who has mastered it, is the salient\nexplanatory factor that one should pick as the most accurate\nspecification of the efficient cause (Phys. 195 b\n21–25). By picking the art, not the artisan, Aristotle is not\njust trying to provide an explanation of the production of the statue\nthat is not dependent upon the desires, beliefs and intentions of the\nindividual artisan; he is trying to offer an entirely different type\nof explanation–namely, an explanation that does not make a\nreference (implicit or explicit) to these desires, beliefs and\nintentions. More directly, the art of bronze-casting the statue enters\nin the explanation as the efficient cause because it helps us to\nunderstand what it takes to produce the statue; that is to say, what\nsteps are required to produce the statue. But can an explanation of\nthis type be given without a reference to the final outcome of the\nproduction, the statue? The answer is emphatically “no”. A\nmodel is made for producing the statue. A mold is prepared for\nproducing the statue. The bronze is melted and poured for producing\nthe statue. Both the prior and the subsequent stage are for the sake\nof a certain end, the production of the statue. Clearly, the statue\nenters in the explanation of each step of the artistic production as\nthe final cause or that for the sake of which everything in\nthe production process is done. \nIn thinking about the four causes, we have come to understand that\nAristotle offers a teleological explanation of the production\nof a bronze statue; that is to say, an explanation that makes a\nreference to the telos or end of the process. Moreover, a\nteleological explanation of the type sketched above does not crucially\ndepend upon the application of psychological concepts such as desires,\nbeliefs and intentions. This is important because artistic production\nprovides Aristotle with a teleological model for the study of natural\nprocesses, whose explanation does not involve beliefs, desires,\nintentions or anything of this sort. Some have objected that Aristotle\nexplains natural process on the basis of an inappropriately\npsychological teleological model; that is to say, a teleological model\nthat involves a purposive agent who is somehow sensitive to the end.\nThis objection can be met if the artistic model is understood in\nnon-psychological terms. In other words, Aristotle does not\npsychologize nature because his study of the natural world is based on\na teleological model that is consciously free from psychological\nfactors. (For further information on the role that artistic production\nplays in developing an explanatory model for the study of nature, see\nBroadie 1987, pp. 35–50.) \nOne final clarification is in order. By insisting on the art of\nbronze-casting as the most accurate efficient cause of the production\nof the statue, Aristotle does not mean to preclude an appeal to the\nbeliefs and desires of the individual artisan. On the contrary, there\nare cases where the individual realization of the art obviously enters\nin the explanation of the bronze statue. For example, one may be\ninterested in a particular bronze statue because that statue is the\ngreat achievement of an artisan who has not only mastered the art but\nhas also applied it with a distinctive style. In this case it is\nperfectly appropriate to make reference to the beliefs and desires of\nthe artisan. Aristotle seems to make room for this case when he says\nthat we should look “for general causes of general things and\nfor particular causes of particular things” (Phys. 195\na 25–26). Note, however, that the idiosyncrasies that may be\nimportant in studying a particular bronze statue as the great\nachievement of an individual artisan may be extraneous to a more\ncentral (and more interesting) case. To understand why let us focus on\nthe study of nature. When the student of nature is concerned with the\nexplanation of a natural phenomenon like the formation of sharp teeth\nin the front and broad molars in the back of the mouth, the student of\nnature is concerned with what is typical about that\nphenomenon. In other words, the student of nature is expected to\nprovide an explanation of why certain animals typically have\na certain dental arrangement. We shall return to this example in due\ncourse. For the time being, it is important to emphasize this\nimportant feature of the explanatory project attempted by Aristotle; a\nfeature that we must keep in mind in trying to understand his theory\nof causality. This theory has in fact been developed primarily (but\nnot exclusively) for the study of nature. \nIn the Physics, Aristotle builds on his general account of\nthe four causes by developing explanatory principles that are specific\nto the study of nature. Here Aristotle insists that all four causes\nare involved in the explanation of natural phenomena, and that the job\nof “the student of nature is to bring the why-question back to\nthem all in the way appropriate to the science of nature”\n(Phys. 198 a 21–23). The best way to understand this\nmethodological recommendation is the following: the science of nature\nis concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are subject to\nchange, and the job of the student of nature is to provide the\nexplanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved in\nthe explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that\nwhich produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that\nAristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved\nin the explanation of each and every instance of natural change.\nRather, he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may\ninvolve a reference to all of them. \nAristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the\nfour causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are\nformally the same as that which produces the change (Phys.\n198 a 23–26). This is one of the several times where Aristotle\noffers the slogan “it takes a human being to generate a human\nbeing” (for example, Phys. 194 b 13; Metaph.\n1032 a 25, 1033 b 32, 1049 b 25, 1070 a 8, 1092 a 16). This slogan is\ndesigned to point at the fundamental fact that the generation of a\nhuman being can be understood only in the light of the end of the\nprocess; that is to say, the fully developed human being. The question\nthus arises as to what it takes for a human being to be fully\ndeveloped. Aristotle frames his answer in terms of the human form,\nmaintaining that a human form is fully realized at the end of\ngeneration. But this does not explain why it takes a human\nbeing to generate a human being. Note, however, that a fully\ndeveloped human being is not only the end of generation; it is also\nwhat initiates the entire process. For Aristotle, the ultimate moving\nprinciple responsible for the generation of a human being is a fully\ndeveloped living creature of the same kind; that is, a human being who\nis formally the same as the end of generation. (A final clarification\nis in order here: Aristotle is committed to a hylomorphic explanation\nof animal generation. His considered view is that the father supplies\nthe form whereas the mother provides the matter.)  \nThus, the student of nature is often left with three types of causes:\nthe formal/final cause, the efficient cause, and the material cause.\nHowever, the view that there are in nature causes besides material and\nefficient causes was controversial in antiquity. According to\nAristotle, most of his predecessors recognized only the material and\nthe efficient cause. This explains why Aristotle cannot be content\nwith saying that formal and final causes often coincide, but he also\nhas to defend his thesis against an opponent who denies that final\ncausality is a genuine mode of causality. \nPhysics II 8 contains Aristotle’s most general defense\nof final causality. Here Aristotle establishes that explaining nature\nrequires final causality by discussing a difficulty that may be\nadvanced by an opponent who denies that there are final causes in\nnature. Aristotle shows that an opponent who claims that material and\nefficient causes alone suffice to explain natural change fails to\naccount for their characteristic regularity. Before considering how\nthe defense is attempted, however, it is important to clarify that\nthis defense does not perform the function of a proof. By showing that\nan approach to the study of nature that ignores final causality cannot\naccount for a crucial aspect of nature, Aristotle does not thereby\nprove that there are final causes in nature. Strictly speaking, the\nonly way to prove that nature exhibits final causality is to establish\nit on independent grounds. But this is not what Aristotle does in\nPhysics II 8. Final causality is here introduced as the best\nexplanation for an aspect of nature which otherwise would remain\nunexplained. \nThe difficulty that Aristotle discusses is introduced by considering\nthe way in which rain works. It rains because of material processes\nwhich can be specified as follows: when the warm air that has been\ndrawn up is cooled off and becomes water, then this water comes down\nas rain (Phys. 198 b 19–21). It may happen that the\ncorn in the field is nourished or the harvest is spoiled as a result\nof the rain, but it does not rain for the sake of any good or bad\nresult. The good or bad result is just a coincidence (Phys.\n198 b 21–23). So, why cannot all natural change work in the same\nway? For example, why cannot it be merely a coincidence that the front\nteeth grow sharp and suitable for tearing the food and the molars grow\nbroad and useful for grinding the food (Phys. 198 b\n23–27)? When the teeth grow in just this way, then the animal\nsurvives. When they do not, then the animal dies. More directly, and\nmore explicitly, the way the teeth grow is not for the sake of the\nanimal, and its survival or its death is just a coincidence\n(Phys. 198 b 29–32). \nAristotle’s reply is that the opponent is expected to explain\nwhy the teeth regularly grow in the way they do: sharp teeth\nin the front and broad molars in the back of the mouth. Moreover,\nsince this dental arrangement is suitable for biting and chewing the\nfood that the animal takes in, the opponent is expected to explain the\nregular connection between the needs of the animal and the\nformation of its teeth. Either there is a real causal connection\nbetween the formation of the teeth and the needs of the animal, or\nthere is no real causal connection and it just so happens that the way\nthe teeth grow is good for the animal. In this second case it is just\na coincidence that the teeth grow in a way that it is good for the\nanimal. But this does not explain the regularity of the\nconnection. Where there is regularity there is also a call for an\nexplanation, and coincidence is no explanation at all. In other words,\nto say that the teeth grow as they do by material necessity and this\nis good for the animal by coincidence is to leave unexplained the\nregular connection between the growth of the teeth and the needs of\nthe animal. Aristotle offers final causality as his explanation for\nthis regular connection: the teeth grow in the way they do for biting\nand chewing food and this is good for the animal. (See Code 1997:\n127–134.) \nOne thing to be appreciated about Aristotle’s reply is that the\nfinal cause enters in the explanation of the formation of the parts of\nan organism like an animal as something that is good either\nfor the existence or the flourishing of the animal. In the first case,\nsomething is good for the animal because the animal cannot survive\nwithout it; in the second case, something is good for the animal\nbecause the animal is better off with it. This helps us to understand\nwhy in introducing the concept of end (telos) that is\nrelevant to the study of natural processes Aristotle insists on its\ngoodness: “not everything that is last claims to be an end\n(telos), but only that which is best” (Phys.\n194 a 32–33). \nOnce his defense of the use of final causes is firmly in place,\nAristotle can make a step further by focusing on the role that matter\nplays in his explanatory project. Let us return to the example chosen\nby Aristotle, the regular growth of sharp teeth in the front and broad\nmolars in the back of the mouth. What explanatory role is left for the\nmaterial processes involved in the natural process? Aristotle does not\nseem to be able to specify what material processes are involved in the\ngrowth of the teeth, but he is willing to recognize that certain\nmaterial processes have to take place for the teeth to grow in the\nparticular way they do. In other words, there is more to the formation\nof the teeth than these material processes, but this formation does\nnot occur unless the relevant material processes take place. For\nAristotle, these material processes are that which is necessary to the\nrealization of a specific goal; that which is necessary on the\nhypothesis that the end is to be obtained. \nHypothetical necessity is often equated to conditional necessity. But\nthis equation can be a first approximation at best. Stating the\nconditions under which something is the case is not yet giving a\nsuccessful explanation. In other words, conditional necessity is a\nwider, and indeed weaker, notion than hypothetical necessity (see\nStein 2016: 353–382, for a lucid reflection on this point). \nPhysics II 9 is entirely devoted to the introduction of the\nconcept of hypothetical necessity and its relevance for the\nexplanatory ambition of Aristotle’s science of nature. In this\nchapter, matter is reconfigured as hypothetical necessity. By so doing\nAristotle acknowledges the explanatory relevance of the material\nprocesses, while at the same time he emphasizes their dependency upon\na specific end. \nIn the Physics, Aristotle builds on his general account of\nthe four causes in order to provide the student of nature with the\nexplanatory resources indispensable for a successful investigation of\nthe natural world. However, the Physics does not provide\nall the explanatory resources for all natural\ninvestigations. Aristotle returns to the topic of causality in the\nfirst book of the Parts of Animals. This is a relatively\nindependent and self-contained treatise entirely devoted to developing\nthe explanatory resources required for a successful study of animals\nand animal life. Here Aristotle completes his theory of causality by\narguing for the explanatory priority of the final cause over the\nefficient cause. \nSignificantly enough, there is no attempt to argue for the existence\nof four fundamental modes of causality in the first book of the\nParts of Animals. Evidently, Aristotle expects his reader to\nbe already familiar with his general account of the four causes as\nwell as his defense of final causality. The problem that here concerns\nAristotle is presented in the following way: since both the final and\nthe efficient cause are involved in the explanation of natural\ngeneration, we have to establish what is first and what is second\n(PA 639 b 12–13). Aristotle argues that there is no\nother way to explain natural generation than by reference to what lies\nat the end of the process. This has explanatory priority over the\nprinciple that is responsible for initiating the process of\ngeneration. Aristotle relies on the analogy between artistic\nproduction and natural generation, and the teleological model that he\nhas developed for the explanation of artistic production. Consider,\nfor example, house-building. There is no other way to explain how a\nhouse is built, or is being built, than by reference to the final\nresult of the process, the house. More directly, the bricks and the\nbeams are put together in the particular way they are for the sake of\nachieving a certain end: the production of the house. This is true\nalso in the case of natural generation. In this context\nAristotle’ slogan is “generation is for the sake of\nsubstance, not substance for the sake of generation”\n(PA 640 a 18–19). This means that the proper way to\nexplain the generation of an organism like an animal, or the formation\nof its parts, is by reference to the product that lies at the end of\nthe process; that is to say, a substance of a certain type. \nFrom Aristotle we learn that Empedocles explained the articulation of\nthe human spine into vertebrae as the result of the twisting and\nturning that takes place when the fetus is in the womb of the mother.\nAristotle finds this explanation unacceptable (PA 640 a\n19–26). To begin with, the fetus must have the power to twist\nand turn in the way it does, and Empedocles does not have an\nexplanation for this fact. Secondly, and more importantly, Empedocles\noverlooks the fact that it takes a human being to generate a\nhuman being. That is to say, the originating principle of the\ngeneration is a fully developed human being which is formally the same\nas the final outcome of the process of generation. It is only by\nlooking at the fully developed human being that we can understand why\nour spine is articulated into vertebrae and why the vertebrae are\narranged in the particular way they are. This amounts to finding the\nrole that the spine has in the life of a fully developed human being.\nMoreover, it is only by looking at the fully developed human being\nthat we can explain why the formation of the vertebrae takes place in\nthe particular way it does. (For further information about the\nexplanatory priority of the final over the efficient cause, see Code\n1997: 127–143.) \nPerhaps we are now in the position to understand how Aristotle argues\nthat there are four kinds of causes and at the same time says that\nproper knowledge is knowledge of the cause or knowledge of\nthe why (APost. 71 b 10–12, 94 a 20;\nPhys. 194 b 17–20; Metaph. 981 a 28–30).\nAdmittedly, at least at first sight, this is a bit confusing.\nConfusion dissolves when we realize that Aristotle recognizes the\nexplanatory primacy of the final/formal cause over the efficient and\nmaterial cause. Of course this does not mean that the other causes can\nbe eliminated. Quite the contrary: Aristotle is adamant that, for a\nfull range of cases, all four causes must be given in order to give an\nexplanation. More explicitly, for a full range of cases, an\nexplanation which fails to invoke all four causes is no explanation at\nall. At the same time, however, the final/formal cause is the primary\ncause and knowledge of this cause amounts to knowledge of the why. \nWe have already seen that Aristotle is not committed to the view that\neverything has all four kinds of causes, Rather, his view is that a\nscientific explanation requires up to four kinds of causes. We may\nillustrate this point with the help of an example. Consider, in\nparticular, the case of a lunar eclipse. In the Metaphysics,\nAristotle says that an eclipse of the moon does not have a final cause\n(Metaph. 1044 b 12). He also says that, strictly speaking, a\nlunar eclipse does not have matter. Rather, it has a cause that plays\na role analogous to matter. This second claim can be inferred\nfrom what Aristotle says about the things that exist by nature but are\nnot substances. With respect to these things, Aristotle says that they\ndo not have matter but rather something that underlies\n(Metaph. 1044 b 8–9). In the case of a lunar eclipse,\nthat which underlies is the subject affected by the eclipse, that is,\nthe moon. The moon is not strictly speaking the matter of the eclipse\nbut rather the subject that undergoes an eclipse when the earth comes\nin the middle between the moon and the sun. Should we give the earth\nas the efficient cause of a lunar eclipse? We have to be careful here.\nBy saying that the moon is a deprivation of light caused by the earth,\nwe distinguish this particular deprivation of light from other kinds\nof deprivation of light. Still, by citing the earth as the efficient\ncause of a lunar eclipse, we are not yet giving the most precise\ndescription of the efficient cause. More directly, we are not yet\nsaying what the earth is doing to cause a lunar eclipse. A lunar\neclipse is a deprivation of light caused by the interposition of the\nearth between the sun and the moon. By coming in the middle of the\nmoon and the sun the earth blocks the light and causes the moon to\nsuffer an eclipse. Hence, it is the interposition of the earth between\nthe sun and the moon is the proximate efficient cause of a\nlunar eclipse. Citing the proximate efficient cause is also giving the\nmost accurate description, and indeed the full explanation, of a lunar\neclipse. (An insightful discussion of how Aristotle explains natural\nphenomena such as a lunar eclipse and sleep can be found in Code 2015:\n11–45). \nThis brief discussion of the explanation of eclipse of the moon brings\nus back to a point that was already made in connection with\nAristotle’s explanation of the production of an artifact such as a\nbronze statue. There too we are required to look for the most accurate\ndescription of the efficient cause, which is to be identified with the\nart of bronze-casting a statue rather than the artisan. It is possible\nto build on both examples to conclude that Aristotle is concerned not\nonly with finding the relevant kinds of causes but also with giving\nthe most accurate description of those causes. By his lights, it is\nonly the most accurate description of all the relevant causes that\ngives us the full explanation, and thereby scientific knowledge, of\nsomething. \nThe study of nature was a search for answers to the question\n“why?” before and independently of Aristotle. A critical\nexamination of the use of the language of causality by his\npredecessors, together with a careful study of natural phenomena, led\nAristotle to elaborate a theory of causality. This theory is\npresented in its most general form in Physics II 3 and in\nMetaphysics V 2. In both texts, Aristotle argues that a\nfinal, formal, efficient or material cause can be given in answer to a\nwhy-question. \nAristotle further elaborates on causality in the rest of\nPhysics II and in Parts of Animals I. Aristotle\nexplores the systematic interrelations among the four modes of\ncausality and argues for the explanatory priority of the final cause.\nIn so doing Aristotle not only expands on his theory of causality; he\nalso builds explanatory principles that are specific to the study of\nnature. Aristotle considers these principles an indispensable\ntheoretical framework for a successful investigation of the natural\nworld. Both Physics II and Parts of Animals have a\nfoundational character. More directly, Aristotle expects the student\nof nature to have mastered these principles before engaging in the\ninvestigation of any aspect of the natural world. \nAlthough Aristotle’s theory of causality is developed in the\ncontext of his science of nature, its application goes well beyond the\nboundaries of natural science. This is already clear from the most\ngeneral presentation of the theory in Physics II 3 and in\nMetaphysics V 2. Here the four causes are used to explain\nhuman action as well as artistic production. In addition, any\ntheoretical investigation that there might be besides natural science\nwill employ the doctrine of the four causes.  \nConsider, briefly, the case of Aristotle’s Metaphysics.\nHere Aristotle is seeking wisdom. Part of the argument of the\nMetaphysics is in an attempt to clarify what sort of wisdom\nAristotle is seeking. Suffice it to say that Aristotle conceives of\nthis wisdom as a science of substance that is, or is a part of, a\nscience of being qua being (for further information about this\nargument, see the entry Aristotle’s Metaphysics, especially\nSections 1 and 3.) What is important is that this science consists in\na causal investigation, that is, a search for the relevant causes.\nThis helps us to understand why the most general presentation of\nAristotle’s theory of causality is repeated, in almost the same\nwords, in Physics II 3 and in Metaphysics V 2.\nAlthough the Physics and the Metaphysics belong to\ntwo different theoretical enterprises, in both cases we are expected\nto embark on an investigation that will eventuate in causal knowledge,\nand this is not possible without a firm grasp of the interrelations\nbetween the four (types of) causes.","contact.mail":"Andrea.Falcon@concordia.ca","contact.domain":"concordia.ca"}]
