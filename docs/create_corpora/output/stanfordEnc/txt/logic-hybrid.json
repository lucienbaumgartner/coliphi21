The most basic hybrid logic is obtained\nby adding so-called nominals which are propositional symbols of a new\nsort, each being true at exactly one possible world. The history of\nhybrid logic goes back to\n   Arthur N. Prior’s work in the 1960s.\n\n\n\nIn the standard Kripke semantics for modal logic, truth is relative to\npoints in a set. Thus, a propositional symbol might have different\ntruth-values relative to different points. Usually, these points are\ntaken to represent possible worlds, times, epistemic states, states in\na computer, or something else. This allows us to formalize natural\nlanguage statements whose truth-values are relative to for example\ntimes, like the statement \nwhich clearly has different truth-values at different times. Now,\ncertain natural language statements are true at exactly one time,\npossible world, or something else. An example is the statement \nwhich is true at the time five o’clock 15 March 2006, but false\nat all other times. The first kind of natural language statements can\nbe formalized in ordinary modal logic, but the second kind cannot. \nA major motivation for hybrid logic is to add further expressive power\nto ordinary modal logic with the aim of being able to formalize the\nsecond kind of statements. This is obtained by adding to ordinary\nmodal logic a second sort of propositional symbols called\nnominals such that in the Kripke semantics each nominal is\ntrue relative to exactly one point. A natural language statement of\nthe second kind (like the example statement with the time five\no’clock 15 March 2006) is then formalized using a nominal, not\nan ordinary propositional symbol (which would be used to formalize the\nexample statement with rainy weather). The fact that a nominal is true\nrelative to exactly one point implies that a nominal can be considered\na term referring to a point, for example, if \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) is a\nnominal that stands for “it is five o’clock 15 March\n2006”, then this nominal can be considered a term referring to\nthe time five o’clock 15 March 2006. Thus, in hybrid logic a\nterm is a specific sort of propositional symbol whereas in first-order\nlogic it is an argument to a predicate. \nMost hybrid logics involve further additional machinery than nominals.\nThere is a number of options for adding further machinery; here we\nshall consider what are called satisfaction operators. The\nmotivation for adding satisfaction operators is to be able to\nformalize a statement being true at a particular time, possible world,\nor something else. For example, we want to be able to formalize that\nthe statement “it is raining” is true at the time five\no’clock 15 March 2006, that is, that \nThis is formalized by the formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a p}\\) where the nominal\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\) stands for “it is five o’clock 15 March\n2006” as above and where \\(\\mathtt{p}\\) is an ordinary\npropositional symbol that stands for “it is raining”. It\nis the part \\(\\mathtt{@_a}\\) of the formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a p}\\) that is\ncalled a satisfaction operator. In general, if \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) is a\nnominal and \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is an arbitrary formula, then a new\nformula \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\) called a satisfaction statement\ncan be built. The satisfaction statement \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\)\nexpresses that the formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is true relative to one\nparticular point, namely the point to which the nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\)\nrefers. \nTo sum up, we have now added further expressive power to ordinary\nmodal logic in the form of nominals and satisfaction operators.\nInformally, the nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) has the truth-condition \nand the satisfaction statement \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\) has the\ntruth-condition \nNote that actually the point \\(w\\) does not matter in the\ntruth-condition for \\(\\mathtt{@_a\\phi}\\) since the satisfaction\noperator \\(\\mathtt{@_a}\\) moves the point of evaluation to the\nreference of \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) whatever the identity of \\(w\\). \nIt is remarkable that nominals together with satisfaction operators\nallow us to express that two points are identical: If the nominals\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{b}\\) refer to the points \\(w\\) and \\(v\\),\nthen the formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a b}\\) expresses that \\(w\\) and \\(v\\) are\nidentical. The following line of reasoning shows why. \nThe identity relation on a set has the well-known properties\nreflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, which is reflected in the\nfact that the formulas \nare valid formulas of hybrid logic. Also the formula \nis valid. This is the rule of replacement. \nBeside nominals and satisfaction operators, in what follows we shall\nconsider the so-called binders \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) allowing us to build formulas\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall a \\phi}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} a \\phi}\\). The\nbinders bind nominals to points in two different ways: The\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder quantifies over points analogous to the\nstandard first-order universal quantifier, that is, \\(\\mathtt{\\forall\na \\phi}\\) is true relative to \\(w\\) if and only if whatever point the\nnominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) refers to, it is the case that\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is true relative to \\(w\\). The\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder binds a nominal to the point of\nevaluation, that is, \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} a \\phi}\\) is true relative\nto \\(w\\) if and only if \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is true relative to \\(w\\)\nwhen \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) refers to \\(w\\). It turns out that the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder is definable in terms of\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) (as shown below). \nThe language we consider is the language of ordinary modal logic built\nover ordinary propositional symbols \\(\\mathtt{p}, \\mathtt{q},\n\\mathtt{r}, …\\) as well as nominals \\(\\mathtt{a}, \\mathtt{b},\n\\mathtt{c}, …\\) and extended with satisfaction operators and\nbinders. We take the propositional connectives \\(\\mathtt{\\wedge}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{\\neg}\\) to be primitive; other propositional connectives are\ndefined as usual. Similarly, we take the modal operator\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\) to be primitive and define the modal operator\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Diamond}\\) as \\(\\mathtt{\\neg \\Box \\neg}\\). As the name\nsuggests, binders bind nominals and the notions of free and bound\noccurrences of nominals are defined analogously to first-order logic.\nSatisfaction operators do not bind nominals, that is, the free nominal\noccurrences in a formula \\(\\mathtt{@_a \\phi}\\) are the free nominal\noccurrences in \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) together with the occurrence of\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\). We let \\(\\mathtt{\\phi[c/a]}\\) be the formula\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) where the nominal \\(\\mathtt{c}\\) has been\nsubstituted for all free occurrences of the nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\). If\nthe nominal \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) occurs free in \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) within the\nscope of \\(\\mathtt{\\forall c}\\) or \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c}\\), then\nthe bound nominal \\(\\mathtt{c}\\) in \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is renamed as\nappropriate. \nWe now define models and frames. A model for hybrid logic is\na triple \\((W, R, V)\\) where \\(W\\) is a non-empty set, \\(R\\) is a\nbinary relation on \\(W\\), and \\(V\\) is a function that to each pair\nconsisting of an element of \\(W\\) and an ordinary propositional symbol\nassigns an element of the set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). The pair \\((W, R)\\) is\ncalled a frame. Thus, models and frames are the same as in\nordinary modal logic. The elements of \\(W\\) are called worlds\nand the relation \\(R\\) is called the accessibility relation.\nThe model \\((W, R, V)\\) is said to be based on the frame\n\\((W, R)\\). \nAn assignment for a model \\(M = (W, R, V)\\) is a function\n\\(g\\) that to each nominal assigns an element of \\(W\\). An assignment\n\\(g'\\) is an \\(\\mathtt{a}\\)-variant of \\(g\\) if \\(g'\\) agrees\nwith \\(g\\) on all nominals save possibly \\(\\mathtt{a}\\). The relation\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\phi\\) is defined by induction, where \\(g\\) is an\nassignment, \\(w\\) is an element of \\(W\\), and \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is a\nformula. \nA formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is said to be true at \\(w\\) if\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\); otherwise it is said to be\nfalse at \\(w\\). By convention \\(M, g \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\nmeans \\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) for every element \\(w\\) of\n\\(W\\) and \\(M \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) means \\(M, g \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) for every assignment \\(g\\). A formula\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in a frame if and only if \\(M\n\\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) for any model \\(M\\) that is based on the frame\nin question. A formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in a class\nof frames \\(F\\) if and only if \\( \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in any\nframe in \\(F\\). A formula \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid if and\nonly if \\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) is valid in the class of all frames. The\ndefinition of satisfiability is left to the reader. \nNote that the binder \\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) is definable in terms of\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) as the formula \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} a\\phi\n\\leftrightarrow \\forall a(a \\rightarrow \\phi)}\\) is valid in any\nframe. \nThe fact that hybridizing ordinary modal logic actually does give more\nexpressive power can for example be seen by considering the formula\n\\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\Box \\neg c}\\). It is straightforward to check\nthat this formula is valid in a frame if and only if the frame is\nirreflexive. Thus, irreflexivity can be expressed by a hybrid-logical\nformula, but it is well known that it cannot be expressed by any\nformula of ordinary modal logic. Irreflexivity can actually be\nexpressed just by adding nominals to ordinary modal logic, namely by\nthe formula \\(\\mathtt{c\\rightarrow \\Box \\neg c}\\). Other examples of\nproperties expressible in hybrid logic, but not in ordinary modal\nlogic, are asymmetry (expressed by \\(\\mathtt{c \\rightarrow \\Box \\neg\n\\Diamond c }\\)), antisymmetry (expressed by \\(\\mathtt{c\\rightarrow\n\\Box(\\Diamond c \\rightarrow c)}\\)), and universality (expressed by\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Diamond c}\\)). \nSee the handbook chapter Areces and ten Cate (2006) for a detailed\naccount of the syntax and semantics of hybrid logic, as well as many\nother basic definitions. The syntax and semantics above can be\nextended in a number of ways, in particular, first-order machinery can\nbe added (of course, an equivalent way to obtain first-order hybrid\nlogic is by adding hybrid-logical machinery to first-order modal\nlogic). See Braüner (2014) for an overview of first-order hybrid\nlogic, see Chapter 6 of Braüner (2011a) for a more detailed account,\nand see Chapter 7 of Braüner (2011a) for an account of intensional\nfirst-order hybrid logic. \nHybrid logic can be translated into first-order logic with equality,\nand (a fragment of) first-order logic with equality can be translated\nback into (a fragment of) hybrid logic. The first-order language under\nconsideration has a 1-place predicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{p^*}\\)\ncorresponding to each ordinary propositional symbol \\(\\mathtt{p}\\) of\nmodal logic, a 2-place predicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{R}\\), and a 2-place\npredicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{=}\\). Of course, the predicate symbol\n\\(\\mathtt{p^*}\\) will be interpreted such that it relativises the\ninterpretation of the corresponding modal propositional symbol\n\\(\\mathtt{p}\\) to worlds, the predicate symbol \\(\\mathtt{R}\\) will be\ninterpreted using the accessibility relation, and the predicate symbol\n\\(\\mathtt{=}\\) will be interpreted using the identity relation on\nworlds. We let \\(\\mathtt{a}, \\mathtt{b}, \\mathtt{c},\\ldots\\) range\nover first-order variables. The language does not have constant or\nfunction symbols. We shall identify first-order variables with\nnominals of hybrid logic. \nWe first translate hybrid logic into first-order logic with equality.\nGiven two new first-order variables \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{b}\\),\nthe translations \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a}\\) and\n\\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{b}\\) are defined by mutual recursion. We just\ngive the translation \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a}\\). \nThe definition of \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{b}\\) is obtained by exchanging\n\\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{b}\\). The translation is an extension of\nthe well-known standard translation from modal logic into\nfirst-order logic. As an example, we demonstrate step by step how the\nhybrid-logical formula \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\Box \\neg c}\\) is\ntranslated into a first-order formula: \nThe resulting first-order formula is equivalent to \\(\\mathtt{\\neg R(a,\na)}\\) which shows that \\(\\mathtt{{\\downarrow} c\\Box \\neg c}\\) indeed\ndoes correspond to the accessibility relation being irreflexive, cf.\nabove. \nFirst-order logic with equality can be translated back into hybrid\nlogic by the translation HT given below. \nNote that the hybrid-logical binder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) is needed.\nThe history of the above mentioned observations goes back to the work\nof Arthur N. Prior, we shall return to that later. \nSimilarly, what is called the bounded fragment of first-order\nlogic can be translated into the hybrid logic but here only the binder\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) is needed, as pointed out in the paper Areces,\nBlackburn, and Marx (2001). The bounded fragment is the fragment of\nfirst-order logic with the property that quantifiers only occur as in\nthe formula \\(\\mathtt{\\forall c(R(a, c) \\rightarrow \\phi)}\\), where it\nis required that the variables \\(\\mathtt{a}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{c}\\) are\ndifferent. A translation from the bounded fragment to the hybrid logic\nwithout the \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder can be obtained by replacing\nthe last clause in the translation HT above by \nIn Areces, Blackburn, and Marx (2001) a number of independent semantic\ncharacterisations of the bounded fragment are given. \nThe translations given above are truth-preserving. To state this\nformally, one makes use of the well-known observation that models and\nassignments for hybrid logic can be considered as models and\nassignments for first-order logic and vice versa. These\ntruth-preservation results are straightforward to formulate and we\nleave the details to the reader. Thus, the hybrid logic with the\nbinder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) has the same expressive power as\nfirst-order logic with equality and the hybrid logic without the\nbinder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) (but with the binder\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\)) has the same expressive power as the bounded\nfragment of first-order logic (note that the translation\n\\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a} (\\mathtt{\\phi})\\) of any formula\n\\(\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) without the binder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) is in the\nbounded fragment). \nThe translations above can be extended to first-order hybrid logic, in\nwhich case the relevant target logic is two-sorted first-order logic\nwith equality, one sort for worlds and one sort for individuals, see\nChapter 6 of Braüner (2011a). In the case of intensional first-order\nhybrid logic, three sorts are employed, the third sort being for\nintensions, see Chapter 7 of Braüner (2011a). \nThe history of hybrid logic goes back to Arthur N. Prior’s\nhybrid tense logic, which is a hybridized version of ordinary tense\nlogic. With the aim of investigating this further, we shall give a\nformal definition of hybrid tense logic: The language of hybrid tense\nlogic is simply the language of hybrid logic defined above except that\nthere are two modal operators, namely \\(\\mathtt{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{H}\\), instead of the single modal operator\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\). The two new modal operators are called tense\noperators. The semantics of hybrid tense logic is the semantics\nof hybrid logic, cf. earlier, with the clause for \\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\)\nreplaced by clauses for the tense operators \\(\\mathtt{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{H}\\). \nThus, there are now two modal operators, namely one that “looks\nforwards” along the accessibility relation and one that\n“looks backwards”. In tense logic the elements of the set\n\\(W\\) are called moments or instants and the\nrelation \\(R\\) is called the earlier-later relation. \nOf course, it is straightforward to modify the translations\n\\(\\mathrm{ST}_a\\) and \\(\\mathrm{HT}\\) above such that translations are\nobtained between hybrid tense logic (including the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder) and first-order logic with equality. The\nfirst-order logic under consideration is what Prior called\nfirst-order earlier-later logic. Given the translations, it\nfollows that Prior’s first-order earlier-later logic has the\nsame expressive power as hybrid tense logic. \nNow, Prior introduced hybrid tense logic in connection with what he\ncalled four grades of tense-logical involvement. The motivation for\nhis four grades of tense-logical involvement was philosophical. The\nfour grades were presented in the book Prior (1968), Chapter XI (also\nChapter XI in the new edition Prior (2003)). Moreover, see Prior\n(1967), Chapter V.6 and Appendix B.3-4. For a more general discussion,\nsee the posthumously published book Prior and Fine (1977). The stages\nprogress from what can be regarded as pure first-order earlier-later\nlogic to what can be regarded as pure tense logic; the goal being to\nbe able to consider the tense logic of the fourth stage as\nencompassing the earlier-later logic of the first stage. In other\nwords, the goal was to be able to translate the first-order logic of\nthe earlier-later relation into tense logic. It was with this goal in\nmind Prior introduced so-called instant-propositions: \nIn the context of modal logic, Prior called such propositions\npossible-world-propositions. Of course, this is what we here call\nnominals. Prior also introduced the binder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) and\nwhat we here call satisfaction operators (he used the notation\n\\(\\mathtt{T(a, \\phi)}\\) instead of \\(\\mathtt{@_a \\phi}\\) for\nsatisfaction operators). In fact, Prior’s third grade tense\nlogic is identical to the hybrid tense logic as defined above. The\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder was introduced much later. Thus, Prior\nobtained the expressive power of his first-order earlier-later logic\nby adding to ordinary tense logic further expressive power in the form\nof nominals, satisfaction operators, and the binder\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\). So from a technical point of view he clearly\nreached his goal. \nHowever, from a philosophical point of view it has been debated\nwhether or not the ontological import of his third grade tense logic\nis the same as the ontological import of the first-order earlier-later\nlogic. For example, the \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder is by some authors\nconsidered a direct analogy to the first-order \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\)\nquantifier, and therefore suspect; see for example the paper Sylvan\n(1996) in the collection Copeland (1996). Also a number of other\npapers in this collection are relevant. See Braüner (2002) for a\ndiscussion of Prior’s fourth grade tense logic. See also\nØhrstrøm and Hasle (1993), Øhrstrøm and\nHasle (2006), Müller (2007), and Blackburn (2007). Finally, see\nthe discussion of Prior’s four grades in Chapter 1 of\nBraüner (2011a). \nThe above mentioned paper Øhrstrøm and Hasle (2006)\ngives a detailed account of Prior's logical work. For a comprehensive\naccount of Prior's life and work, see the book Øhrstrøm and Hasle\n(1995). The paper Hasle and Øhrstrøm (2016) describes\nPrior's methodological approach, in particular, his view on\nformalisation and the role of symbolic logic in conceptual\nstudies. \nThe first completely rigorous definition of hybrid logic was given in\nBull (1970), which appeared in a special issue of the journal\nTheoria in memory of Prior. Bull introduces a third sort of\npropositional symbols where a propositional symbol is assumed to be\ntrue exactly at one branch (“course of events”) in a\nbranching time model. This idea of sorting propositional symbols\naccording to restrictions on their interpretations has later been\ndeveloped further by a number of authors, see Section 5 of the paper\nBlackburn and Tzakova  (1999) for a discussion. \nThe hybrid logical machinery originally invented by Prior in the late\n1960s was reinvented in the 1980s by Solomon Passy and Tinko Tinchev\nfrom Bulgaria, see Passy and Tinchev (1985) as well as Passy and\nTinchev (1991). Rather than ordinary modal logic, this work took place\nin connection with the much more expressive Propositional Dynamic\nLogic. \nA major contribution in the 1990s was the introduction of the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder. An early version of the downarrow\nbinder was introduced by Valentin Goranko in the papers Goranko (1994)\nand Goranko (1996). The version of the present paper was introduced in\nBlackburn and Seligman (1995). Since then, hybrid logic with the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder has been extensively studied, see for\nexample the paper Areces, Blackburn, and Marx (2001) on\nmodel-theoretic aspects of this logic. A comprehensive study of the\nmodel-theory of hybrid logic is the PhD thesis of ten Cate (2004). \nAlso the weaker hybrid logic obtained by omitting both of the binders\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) has been the subject\nof extensive exploration. It turns out that this binder-free logic and\na number of variants of it are decidable. In the paper Areces,\nBlackburn, and Marx (1999), a number of complexity results are given\nfor hybrid modal and tense logics over various classes of frames, for\nexample arbitrary, transitive, linear, and branching. It is remarkable\nthat the satisfiability problem of the binder-free hybrid logic over\narbitrary frames is decidable in PSPACE, which is the same as the\ncomplexity of deciding satisfiability in ordinary modal logic. Thus,\nhybridizing ordinary modal logic gives more expressive power, but the\ncomplexity stays the same. Some work has been carried out on\nsimulating nominals inside modal logic, see Kracht and Wolter\n(1997). \nAny ordinary modal formula expresses a monadic second-order property on\nframes, and it is well-known that for some modal formulas, including\nwhat are called Sahlqvist formulas, the second-order property is\nequivalent to a first-order property. In the paper Goranko and\nVakarelov (2006) this is shown to hold also for a class of\nhybrid-logical formulas, including nominals. Several algorithms exists\nfor calculating first-order equivalents of ordinary modal formula. One\nsuch algorithm, SQEMA, is in the paper Conradie, Goranko, and\nVakarelov (2006) extended to encompass the hybrid-logical formulas\nconsidered in Goranko and Vakarelov (2006). \nIt is remarkable that first-order hybrid logic offers precisely the\nfeatures needed to prove interpolation theorems: While interpolation\nfails in a number of well-known first-order modal logics, their\nhybridized counterparts have this property, see Areces, Blackburn, and\nMarx (2003) as well as Blackburn and Marx (2003). The first paper\ngives a model-theoretic proof of interpolation whereas the second\npaper gives an algorithm for calculating interpolants based on a\ntableau system. \nIt should also be mentioned that logics similar to hybrid logics play\na central role within the area of description logic, which is a family\nof logics used for knowledge representation in Artificial\nIntelligence, see the paper Blackburn and Tzakova (1998) and Carlos\nAreces’ PhD thesis (2000). \nAs described in the previous section, Prior introduced hybrid tense\nlogic to deal with a particular issue in the philosophy of time, but\nin Prior (1968), Chapter XIV (also Chapter XIV in the new edition\nPrior (2003)), he also showed that hybrid tense logic can replace a\ntwo-dimensional temporal logic introduced by Hans Kamp in Kamp (1971).\nThe dimension is simply the number of instants a formula is evaluated\nrelative to, so adding hybrid-logical machinery enables two dimensions\nto be replaced by one. This work has recently been followed up in a\nnumber of papers by Blackburn and Jørgensen, see Blackburn and\nJørgensen (2016a) for an overview. We now give a brief sketch of this\nline of work, adapted to the terminology of the present paper. The\nversion of hybrid logic in question has a designated nominal\n\\(\\mathtt{now}\\) and each model comes together with a designated time\n\\( t_0 \\) such that i) any stand-alone formula is evaluated relative\nto \\( t_0 \\) and ii) the nominal \\(\\mathtt{now}\\) refers to \\( t_0 \\).\nMore formally, we adopt the convention that \\((M,t_0), g \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\) means \\(M, g, t_0 \\vDash \\mathtt{\\phi}\\) and we only\nconsider assignments \\(g\\) where \\(g(\\mathtt{now})=t_0\\). Note that\nthe nominal \\(\\mathtt{now}\\), considered as a stand-alone formula, is\nvalid in this semantics, but this is not the case for any other\nnominal. This new notion of validity is by Blackburn and Jørgensen\ncalled contextual validity. The paper Blackburn and\nJørgensen (2013) gives an axiom system which is complete wrt. this\nnotion of contextual validity. The paper Blackburn and Jørgensen\n(2012) gives a complete tableau system, but the semantics of this\npaper is in line with Kamp's original two-dimensional semantics. Both\npapers also consider further indexicals like \\(\\mathtt{yesterday}\\),\n\\(\\mathtt{today}\\) and \\(\\mathtt{tomorrow}\\).  \nThe paper Blackburn and Jørgensen (2016b) uses hybrid tense logic to\ncombine ideas of Prior with those of Hans Reichenbach on how to\nrepresent natural language tenses. Prior preferred the well-known\ntense operators described above, whereas Reichenbach preferred\ntemporal references, that is, references to specific times,\nReichenbach (1947). It turns out that the two approaches can be\ncombined, which was not the route taken by Prior\nhimself––see the account given in Blackburn and Jørgensen\n(2016b),  \nA number of papers have dealt with axioms for hybrid logic, for\nexample Gargov and Goranko (1993), Blackburn (1993), and Blackburn and\nTzakova (1999). In the paper Gargov and Goranko (1993) an axiom system\nfor hybrid logic is given, and it is shown that if the system is\nextended with a set of additional axioms which are pure\nformulas (that is, formulas where all propositional symbols are\nnominals), then the extended axiom system is complete with respect to\nthe class of frames validating the axioms in question. Pure formulas\ncorrespond to first-order conditions on the accessibility relation\n(cf. the translation \\(\\mathrm{ST}_\\mathtt{a}\\) above), so axiom\nsystems for new hybrid logics with first-order conditions on the\naccessibility relation can be obtained in a uniform way simply by\nadding axioms as appropriate. So, if for example the formula\n\\(\\mathtt{c\\rightarrow \\Box \\neg c}\\) is added as an axiom, then the\nresulting system is complete with respect to irreflexive frames, cf.\nearlier. See the discussion of such rules in Section 4 of the paper\nBlackburn (2000). \nThe proof­ system in Gargov and Goranko (1993) makes use of a complex\nrule (called COV) where the formula schema containing the active part\nof the rule can be arbitrarily large; in fact, the active part is\nembedded under arbitrarily deep nestings of modal operators. Blackburn\nand Tzakova (1999) shows that satisfaction operators can be used to\nformulate an axiom system in a more standard format, using a simpler\nrule called PASTE, such that the system is still complete when\nextended with pure axions.  \nThe paper Blackburn and ten Cate (2006) investigates orthodox\nproof-rules (which are proof-rules without side-conditions) in axiom\nsystems, and it is shown that if one requires extended completeness\nusing pure formulas, then unorthodox proof-rules are indispensable in\naxiom systems for binder-free hybrid logic, but an axiom system can be\ngiven only involving orthodox proof-rules for the stronger hybrid\nlogic including the \\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder. See also the book\nBraüner (2011a) for another axiom system for hybrid logic as well\nas axiom systems for intuitionistic hybrid logic and a hybridization\nof Nelson's paraconsistent logic N4 (compare to Costa and Martins\n(2016) where another paraconsistent hybrid logic is considered). A\nsurvey of intuitionistic hybrid logic can be found in Braüner\n(2011b). \nThe paper Areces, Blackburn, Huertas, and Manzano (2014) deals with a\nhybrid-logical version of higher-order modal logic (that is, modal\nlogic built over Church's simple theory of types). Axiom systems are\ngiven and completeness is proved wrt. Henkin-type semantics. The paper\nBlackburn, Huertas, Manzano, and Jørgensen (2014) extends these\nresults to encompass the downarrow binder and gives translations to\nand from the bounded fragment of first-order logic (see above).  \nTableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction style proof-theory for hybrid\nlogic work very well compared to ordinary modal logic. Usually, when a\nmodal tableau, Gentzen, or natural deduction system is given, it is\nfor one particular modal logic and it has turned out to be problematic\nto formulate such systems for modal logics in a uniform way without\nintroducing metalinguistic machinery. This can be remedied by\nhybridization, that is, hybridization of modal logics enables the\nformulation of uniform tableau, Gentzen, and natural deduction systems\nfor wide classes of logics. The paper Blackburn (2000) introduces a\ntableau system for hybrid logic that has this desirable feature:\nAnalogous to the axiom system of Blackburn and Tzakova (1999),\ncompleteness is preserved if the tableau system is extended with a set\nof pure axioms, that is, a set of pure formulas that are allowed to be\nadded to a tableau during the tableau construction. The tableau system\nof Blackburn (2000) is the basis for a decision procedure for the\nbinder-free fragment of hybrid logic given in Bolander and\nBraüner (2006). This line of work has been continued in the\npapers Bolander and Blackburn (2007) and Bolander and Blackburn\n(2009). The paper Cerrito and Cialdea (2010) presents another\ntableau-based decision procedure for hybrid logic. Other decision\nprocedures for hybrid logics, which also are based on proof-theory,\nare given in the paper Kaminski and Smolka (2009). The procedures of\nthe latter paper are based on a higher-order formulation of hybrid\nlogic involving the simply typed lambda calculus. \nThe article Hansen, Bolander, and Braüner (2017) gives a\ntableau-based decision procedure for many-valued hybrid logic, that\nis, hybrid logic where the two-valued classical logic basis has been\ngeneralized to a many-valued logic basis involving a truth-value space\nhaving the structure of a finite Heyting algebra. Hansen (2010) gives\na tableau-based decision procedure for a hybridized version of a\ndynamic epistemic logic called public annoucement logic. This is also\na major issue of the PhD thesis Hansen (2011). \nNatural deduction style proof-theory of hybrid logic has been explored\nin the book Braüner (2011a). This book also gives a Gentzen\nsystem for hybrid logic. These natural deduction and Gentzen systems\ncan be extended with additional proof-rules corresponding to\nfirst-order conditions on the accessibility relations expressed by\nso-called geometric theories (this is of course analogous to\nextending tableau and axiom systems with pure axioms). See also\nBraüner and de Paiva (2006) where a natural deduction system is\ngiven for intuitionistic hybrid logic (Chapter 8 of Braüner\n(2011a)). \nTableau systems for first-order hybrid logic can be found in the paper\nBlackburn and Marx (2002). Natural deduction and axiom systems for\nfirst-order hybrid logic can be found in Chapter 6 of the book\nBraüner (2011a) and Chapter 7 of the book deals with natural\ndeduction for intensional first-order hybrid logic. The paper Barbosa,\nMartins, and Carreteiro (2014) gives an axiomatization of a fragment\nof first-order hybrid logic called equational first-order hybrid\nlogic. \nGentzen and natural deduction systems for logics similar to hybrid\nlogics were explored already in the 1990s by Jerry Seligman, see the\noverview in Seligman (2001). In particular, Seligman developed\nproof-systems that work with arbitrary formulas, not just satisfaction\nstatements, the latter being the case for most proof-systems for\nhybrid logic, where satisfaction operators are used to access\ninformation hidden behind modalities. A natural deduction system in\nthis style was introduced in Seligman (1997) and this system has been\nfurther developed in Chapter 4 of the book Braüner (2011a). A\ntableau systems in Seligman's proof-style has been considered in\nBlackburn, Bolander, Braüner, and Jørgensen (2017) where a syntactic\ncompleteness proof is given. A semantic completenes proof of the\ntableau system is given in Jørgensen, Blackburn, Bolander, Braüner\n(2016). Reasoning in these systems does not directly rely on the\nglobal encodings that satisfaction operators make possible, hence,\nthese systems can be considered more in line with the local character\nof the standard Kripke semantics for modal logic. In fact, this more\nlocal reasoning style makes these systems suitable for formalizing the\nperspectival reasoning taking place in certain psychological reasoning\ntasks, see Braüner (2014b) as well as Braüner, Blackburn, and\nPolyanskaya (2016). \nSome work in resolution calculi and model checking has been carried\nout, see Areces, de Rijke, and de Nivelle (2001) as well as Areces and\nGorin (2011) for resolution calculi and see as Franceschet and de\nRijke (2006) as well as Lange (2009) for results on model\nchecking. \nSince the mid 1990s, the work on hybrid logic has flourished.
