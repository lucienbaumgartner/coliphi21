It is a state of\nmind familiar to everyone who has ever wanted to drink water or desired\nto know what has happened to an old friend, but its familiarity does\nnot make it easy to give a theory of desire. Controversy immediately\nbreaks out when asking whether wanting water and desiring knowledge\nare, at bottom, the same state of mind as others that seem somewhat\nsimilar: wishing never to have been born, preferring mangoes to\npeaches, craving gin, having world conquest as one's goal, having\na purpose in sneaking out to the shed, or being inclined to provoke\njust for the sake of provocation. These varied states of mind have all\nbeen grouped together under the heading of ‘pro attitudes’,\nbut whether the pro attitudes are fundamentally one mental state or\nmany is disputed.\n\n\n\nIn spite of the disputes, it is nonetheless possible to get a fix on\ndesire itself. Desiring is a state of mind that is commonly associated\nwith a number of different effects: a person with a desire tends to act\nin certain ways, feel in certain ways, and think in certain ways. If\nNora desires tea, for example, then Nora will typically make herself a\ncup of tea; if she does not get herself some tea right away she will\nnonetheless typically feel the urge to do so; she will find the thought\nof tea pleasant and will find her current lack of tea unpleasant; she\nwill find her thoughts repeatedly turning to the idea of tea; she will\njudge that tea seems like a good idea; and so on. These various effects\nhave been the focus of efforts to develop theories that are theories of\ndesire.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding desires requires at least two things: first, to have a\ntheory of desire itself, and second, to have some familiarity with the\nvarieties of desires that there are. Once acquired, an understanding of\ndesire can illuminate a number of controversies surrounding desire.\n\n\n\nThere is a simple, conservative theory of desire according to which\nhaving a desire is a matter of having dispositions to act. According to\nthis theory, dispositions to act are the only essential feature of\ndesires; the tendencies a person has to feel certain ways or think in\ncertain ways when she has a desire are interesting but inessential\ntendencies. If Nora desires tea, this is because she is disposed to get\nherself some tea, and her dispositions to feel good about tea, think\npositively about getting tea, or to keep having her thoughts turn\ntoward getting tea are merely associated effects of her desire. The\nsimple, conservative theory has a number of competitors, each\nemphasizing something different from, or in addition to, dispositions\nto action. \n\nIn spite of the variety of theoretical options, the simple,\nconservative theory of desire—the action-based theory—is\nthe most widely-held theory, making it the appropriate place to begin\nany discussion. \n\nConsider a desire for a yellow mango. “The primitive sign of\nwanting,” Anscombe writes, “is trying to get”\n(Anscombe 2000). Taking this thought to heart, one might hold that if\nJanet tries to get a yellow mango, then a yellow mango is what Janet\ndesires. But Janet can desire a yellow mango even when she is not\ntrying to get one (she might be struck by a craving while all out of\nmangoes, and not be willing to go shopping at that moment). So there is\nreason to want something more elaborate as a theory of desire. To deal\nwith Janet, it might seem simplest to hold that desires\ndispose us to action, without always bringing it about that we\nact. Although Janet is not trying to get a mango, she is disposed to\nget one—and would, were it only more convenient to do so. This\nleads to a simple, action-based theory of desire. \n\nThis sort of theory has been criticized for being insufficiently\nrestrictive, because it appears to attribute desires to organisms on\nthe basis of mere behavioral tics. For instance, if a woman has a\ntendency to stutter, then it follows from the theory above that she has\na desire to stutter—simply because she is disposed to act so as\nto stutter. For such reasons, it is common to prefer a more\nsophisticated version of an action-based theory of desire. \n\nAccording to this theory, for Janet to desire to have a yellow mango\nis just for her to be disposed to go to the fridge, or the store, or to\nask her friend, or to do whatever else she believes likely to get her a\nyellow mango. She need not actually do any of these things, for she\nmight desire to do something else even more, or might be asleep, or\ndrugged, or otherwise prevented from doing the things she is disposed\nto do, but she must be (at least to some extent) disposed to do them\nall else being equal. Likewise, for John to desire that Janet love him\nis for John to be disposed to take whatever actions he believes are\nlikely to make it the case that Janet loves him. And so on, for the\nvarious desires that people and other organisms are capable of having.\nMichael Smith has very clearly articulated this sort of theory of\ndesire in a number of works (Smith 1987; 1994). \n\nLike their less sophisticated counterparts, more sophisticated\naction-based theories of desire have been criticized for being\ninsufficiently restrictive. Dennis Stampe points out that a person who\nbelieves that serving just so will cause him to double fault in tennis\nmight thereby become disposed to serve just so and double fault (being\nnervous seems to have this effect quite often), but this would not show\nthat such a person desires to double fault (Stampe 1986). And a number\nof philosophers have suggested that desires are only one psychological\nstate able to initiate action, so that it is a mistake to identify\ndesires with psychological states disposing us to actions. Some of\nthese philosophers have focused on the negative point, that what might\nbe called ‘true desires’ do not exhaust the possible\nmotivational states (Davis 1986; Marks 1986). Others have focused on a\npositive alternative to desire as a motivating state, and these latter\nhave tended to focus on the idea that a judgment of what is good (or\nobligatory) is at least one further psychological state that can lead\nto action, independently of antecedent desire. In both the case of\ndesire and of belief in the good, being in such a state is being\ndisposed to take whatever actions are believed likely to bring about\nwhat is desired or what is judged good. But according to these\nphilosophers, desires and judgments of goodness are very different\nthings. Hence action-based theories of desire fail to make an important\ndistinction (e.g., McDowell 1978; Scanlon 1998). \n\nAn important variant of action-based theories of desire holds that\ndesires are mental states that have the function of producing actions,\nrather than mental states that merely dispose agents to act. On these\ntheories, a desire might or might not dispose an actor to satisfy the\ndesire, but causing that result is the job or purpose of the desire\n(the biological function of the desire), or bringing about the\nsatisfaction of the desire is how the action-production systems do\ntheir jobs or fulfill their purposes (Millikan 1984; Papineau 1987).\nWhile these variations do well with Stampe-type objections (because it\nis not the purpose of a belief that one is going to double fault to\ncause a double fault), they nonetheless would seem to be subject to\nobjections by those who think that beliefs in the good can also perform\ntheir functions by moving one to act. \n\nTo overcome these latter objections, the action-based theorist may\nfollow any of a number of lines of argument. The action-based theorist\nmay argue that mere beliefs in goodness cannot move agents to act,\ngiven an independently motivated theory of belief in general (a\nposition open to many philosophers of mind with complementary theories\nof belief and desire). Or he may argue that there is an incoherence in\nthe principles by which one should revise a belief in goodness and by\nwhich one should revise one's dispositions to act (see the\ndiscussion of Lewis below in section 1.3), so that there is something\nincoherent in the idea of a belief in goodness that also moves one to\nact. Or, in a more concessive spirit, he may allow that the\naction-based theory of desire should be supplemented with other\nelements (dispositions to pleasure, for instance) not characteristic of\nbeliefs in goodness. \n\nOne further difficulty for action-based theories of desire comes from\napparent desires for things that action is ill-suited to bring about\n(evidence, that is, that the action-based theory of desire is\nexcessively restrictive). For example, suppose it is possible for me\nto desire that pi be a rational number, or to desire that I had never\nbeen born, or to desire that a committee decide in my favor regardless\nof what I do (Schroeder 2004). These are desires that do not seem to\nexist in virtue of facts about dispositions to action, even facts\nabout what actions I would perform if I were so foolish as to believe\nthat I could fulfill my desires by actions. In response, the\naction-based theorist may hold that these attitudes are not true\ndesires at all but only related conative attitudes: wishes, perhaps. A\ndifferent line of response might be to hold that, even for such\ndesires, dispositions to act still exist, even if they are unlikely to\nbe acted upon in moderately reasonable people (Wall 2009). \n\nAs just suggested, philosophers who complain that an action-based\ntheory of desire fails to distinguish judgments of goodness from desire\nsometimes suggest that pleasure is the key to this distinction.\nAccording to these philosophers, a person moved by a desire always\nenjoys what is desired, or eagerly anticipates the desire's\nsatisfaction, whereas a person moved only by a judgment of goodness\ndoes not share these feelings (Schueler 1995; Vadas 1984; see also\nDavis 1986). Insofar as this seems right, there is reason to try out a\ntheory of desire according to which dispositions to pleasure (and\ndispleasure) are all there is to desire. Perhaps desires only\ncontingently move us to action, but necessarily give rise to certain\nfeelings. A simple version of this theory holds: \n\nIn addition to considerations in moral psychology, there are also\nreasons to prefer a pleasure-based theory of desire that stem from the\nphilosophy of mind. Galen Strawson defends a pleasure-based theory on\ntwo grounds: first, Strawson holds that being a desire for\nanything (or being a belief about anything or otherwise\nexhibiting intentionality) requires consciousness, and pleasure and\ndispleasure are the states of consciousness most closely linked to\ndesire. And second, Strawson holds that it is conceivable that there be\ncreatures who would lack dispositions to act but who would have\ndispositions to feelings of pleasure and displeasure, and that these\ncreatures would seem to have desires for the things that would please\nthem. These creatures might include actual human beings suffering from\nneurological injuries removing their dispositions to act, and they\nmight include purely imaginary beings never born with capacities to\nact, just capacities to feel (Strawson 1994). \n\nCarolyn Morillo has also defended a pleasure-based theory of desire,\nthough on quite different grounds. Beginning on conceptual grounds,\nMorillo argues that desires are ontologically independent of action,\nbecause they are non-trivial explainers of action. And then on\nempirical (specifically, neuroscientific) grounds, Morillo argues that\nepisodes of pleasure are identical to certain neural events (the\nrelease of dopamine by what is known as the ‘reward\nsystem’), and these same neural events are the causal origin (in\nconjunction with belief) of action. Thus, episodes of pleasure play the\nrole of desires, and so desires are episodes of pleasure (Morillo\n1990). \n\nA difficulty for pleasure-based theories of desire is that pleasure\nhas seemed to some to have a causal or representational relationship to\ndesire. According to these philosophers, net satisfaction of desire, or\nnet increase in satisfaction of desire, is the standard cause of\npleasure, and the pleasure caused perhaps represents this change in\ndesire satisfaction. If such views are correct, then it seems desires\nmust be ontologically distinct from pleasure in the way that causes are\ndistinct from their effects, or objects of representation from their\nrepresentations (Davis 1982; Schroeder 2004). \n\nWhile some philosophers hold that desires need to be strongly\nseparated from judgments of goodness, other philosophers think that\nthey need to be more closely linked. It was perhaps the view of\nSocrates that to want something is simply to think it good, and it is\nsimple enough to formulate a theory of desire on this basis. \n\nRecommending such a theory is the intuition, shared by many, that we\nare motivated to do what we judge good just because we judge it good\n(and the intuition that, if I am motivated to do something, I desire to\ndo it). If I judge it good to go to a meeting of the PTA, then that\nsuffices to motivate me to go to the meeting, it would seem, and thus\n(perhaps) to desire it. \n\nDavid Lewis has mounted a challenge to such theories of desire on\nthe basis of results from decision theory (Lewis 1988; 1996). Lewis\nconsiders the thesis, Desire As Belief, that a rational individual is\nmotivated to make true a proposition p to the extent that she\nbelieves p to be good, and shows that within a familiar\ndecision-theoretic framework inconsistencies result. In Lewis's\nargument, the result follows because of the differences between\nrational belief revision and rational desire (or motivation) revision\nwithin the decision-theoretic framework. In response to Lewis, a number\nof philosophers have sought to defend the general idea that desires are\nbeliefs in goodness (or are entailed by such beliefs in rational\nindividuals) by defending different specific formulations of the thesis\nwithin decision theory (e.g., Price 1989; Byrne and Hájek 1997).\nThere have also been efforts to show that formal decision theory might\nnot be formalizing the right things to draw conclusions about desire\nand goodness (e.g., Broome 1991). \n\nIn a less formal mode, Dennis Stampe and Graham Oddie have\nindependently advanced very similar good-based theories of desire\naccording to which desires are a kind of high-level perceptual state: a\nperception of goodness. \n\nAccording to these theorists, perceptions of goodness are not like\nperceptions of cold or white light, but more like perceptions of\nsomething as looking like Mikhail Gorbachev—i.e., complex,\nhigh-level perceptual states that are nonetheless distinct from belief\nstates. Stampe and Oddie are both careful to hold that the appearance\nof goodness is something quite distinct from the judgment or belief\nthat something is good (and thus, though this is not their main\nconcern, they evade Lewis's formal arguments). On Stampe's\nview, this distinctness is best demonstrated by the fact that it is\nconsistent to claim to believe that something is good while it does not\nseem good (i.e., is not wanted), but it is not consistent to claim to\ndesire something while it does not seem good (i.e., is not wanted). In\na related vein, Oddie argues that, while it is not incoherent to\nbelieve that one course of action is the best while not desiring to\ntake it, there is a tension in such a state of affairs, and this\ntension is best explained as resulting from the fact that desires\nrepresent their contents as good (Stampe 1987; Oddie 2005). \n\nOne other interesting variant of the position is defended by\nT.M. Scanlon (1998). According to Scanlon, motivating desires are\njudgments of, not what is good, but what we have reason to\ndo. (Scanlon also holds that there are non–motivating desires\nthat direct attention; these sorts of desires are discussed in the\nnext section.) \n\nGood-based theories of desire are motivated by considerations so\ndifferent from action-based theories of desire (or pleasure-based\ntheories) that it is very rare to see advocates of the one attack the\nother, with the exception of Lewis's very technical work and the\nliterature following from it. As a result, difficulties for good-based\ntheories of desire have not been richly explored in the philosophical\nliterature. One puzzle for such theories might be to explain the\nrelationship of desires to non-human animals. On the one hand, it would\nseem that rats desire to get away from cats, desire to be around other\nrats, and the like. On the other hand, it would seem that rats do not\nrepresent anything as good (they would both seem to lack the concept of\ngoodness and to lack a perceptual-style representation of goodness that\nwould be well poised to generate such a concept). But if rats can\ndesire without representing the good, then why would people be\ndifferent? The options available for solving such puzzles have not yet\nbeen fully explored. \n\nAnother evaluatively loaded theory of desire has been proposed by\nT.M. Scanlon. Dubbed a theory of desire in the\n‘directed-attention’ sense, this theory links desires to\nreasons, rather than goodness. But the theory does so through its\ncharacterization of how desire plays its most important role, which is\nits role in directing the attention of the subject who desires. \n\nSince, on Scanlon's view, reasons are considerations that\ncount in favor of propositions, it follows from this theory that a\ndesire p exists if one's attention is directed\ninsistently toward apparent reasons to have it be the case that\np. This is where the evaluative element enters the theory\n(Scanlon 1998). \n\nTechnically, Scanlon does not present a complete attention-based\ntheory of desire, but only an attention-based sufficient condition for\nthe existence of a desire. Perhaps this is because Scanlon sees his\ntheory as best suited to characterizing desires that are playing an\nactive role at the moment—occurrent desires—but not as\ngiving a good characterization of desires not having that\nrole—standing desires (see below). A theory of standing desires\nthat follows Scanlon's lead might look something like the\nfollowing. \n\nLike good-based theories of desire, Scanlon's\nattention-based theory of desire has not yet been engaged at length by\nproponents of more conservative theories of desire, and it remains to\nbe seen what objections more conservative theorists might raise. One\npuzzle for the theory might come from its focus on one limited form of\nattention. According to the theory, desire's characteristic\neffect is to direct attention toward reasons to fulfill the desire. But\ndesire has notable effects on other forms of attention, too: if Katie\ndesires that Ohio State win a football game, then her desire will\ndirect her attention to information about the game, will direct her\nattention to opportunities to gain information about the game, will\ndirect her attention to people discussing the game, and so on. These\nways in which attention can be directed seem, pre-theoretically, just\nas important to the nature of desire as the ways that are of interest\nto the attention-based theory of desire. \n\nAll of the theories considered so far have treated desire as a\nsuitable topic for a priori investigation, with one\nexception.  Morillo's methodology treats desires as a natural kind:\nthe natural kind that is responsible for a familiar\neffect—action—one associates with desire. This general\nmethodology is shared by another philosopher, Timothy Schroeder. But\nSchroeder sees the neuroscientific evidence as supporting a different\nconclusion from Morillo's. Schroeder agrees with Morillo that there is\na single neurological structure that is the unique common cause of the\nvarious phenomena associated with desire (at least, with action,\npleasure, and some aspects of thought and attention), and agrees that\nthis structure is the dopamine-releasing reward system. However, he\nargues that the activity of this neurological structure does not\nrealize pleasure.  (Pleasure is said to be one of its effects.)\nRather, the output of this neurological structure realizes a form of\nunconscious learning known as contingency-based learning or\nreward-based learning. Schroeder thus concludes that desires are this\nnatural kind: reward-based learning mechanisms. Desires have all of\ntheir familiar effects on action, feelings, and thought only\ncontingently (compare Morillo 1990 to Schroeder 2004; compare both to\nthe related view in Butler 1992). \n\nSchroeder's version of a reward-based theory of desire is a\ndevelopment of a theory advanced by Fred Dretske (Dretske 1988, chapter\n5). Dretske advances the view that desires in fact determine what\nstates of affairs will drive reward-based learning, but does not go so\nfar as to offer a complete theory of desire on this basis. \n\nThe dispute between Schroeder and Morillo over how to interpret the\nneural structure that is the unique common cause of phenomena such as\naction and pleasure highlights one way in which scientific research can\nbecome important to philosophical theories of desire. The\ndopamine-releasing reward system is said by Schroeder to be a cause of\npleasure, but by Morillo to be the neural realization of pleasure (when\nactive). Evidence that the reward system realizes pleasure comes\nprincipally from the fact that its activity coincides with pleasure\n(reviewed in Berridge 2003), and from the fact that stimulating the\nreward system (via drugs or electrodes) is known to cause pleasure\n(classics of this literature are reviewed in Stellar and Stellar 1985).\nBut this evidence is also compatible with the theory that the reward\nsystem is one normal cause of pleasure. Evidence for this latter view\nhas come in the form of evidence that some pleasure-causing drugs work\nindependently of the reward system (reviewed in Berridge 2003), in the\nform of evidence that rats deprived of their reward systems can still\nexperience gustatory pleasure (Berridge and Robinson 1998), and in the\nform of reasonable candidates for neural realizers of pleasure that are\nlocated causally “downstream” from the reward system\n(reviewed in Berridge 2003 in support of one candidate structure; a\ndifferent candidate is defended in Schroeder 2004). \n\nOf all the theories of desire considered here, learning-based\ntheories of desire have the least a priori credibility: no one\ncomes to grasp the idea of a desire through being taught about\nreward-based learning. A learning-based theory of desire is committed\nto holding that a desire can exist in a creature that cannot, by its\nnature, move or feel; so long as it can represent and learn in a\ncertain way (and so long as these capacities are appropriately\nrelated), that suffices for a creature to have a desire. A\npriori, this is likely to seem outlandish. Our ideas about desire\ntell us that desires are all about actions and feelings, after all. The\nfact that the learning-based theory of desire holds that an organism\ncould desire sunny days without feeling good about sunny days, without\nfeeling bad about cloudy days, without being motivated to do whatever\nmight help bring about a sunny day or even being moved to jump for joy\nwhen it turns sunny—this can be hard to swallow. The\nplausibility of learning-based theories thus requires either a\nrejection of a priori constraints on theories of desire, or\nacceptance of the idea that it is a priori that desires are\nbest theorized as a natural kind that might, in principle, lack the\nfeatures we most commonly associate with it (for versions of these\ncriticisms, see, e.g., Bratman 1990; Brook 2006; Latham 2006). \n\nSo far, only single-feature theories of desire have been considered.\nBut there are also a number of theories of desire that refuse to\nprivilege any one feature. Instead, these theories make central\ntheoretical appeal to the total package of features associated with\ndesire. To have a desire, according to such holistic theories, is a\nmatter of having enough (often a somewhat vague constraint) of some set\nof desire-like features. \n\nA list of desire-like features for a holistic theory is rarely\nprovided in full, but certain desire-like features are commonly\nmentioned and can be expected to play a role in most holistic theories.\nThese are the features just considered as candidates for the essential\nfeature of desires. \n\nAdditional features that might well play a role in a holistic theory\ninclude any platitudinous observation about desires. A few follow,\nthough platitudes about desire are so numerous that the list could be\nquite a bit longer than it is. \n\nHolistic theories of desire come in two main forms: functionalist\nand interpretationist. In the functionalist form, a desire is an\ninternal state-type that plays enough of the causal roles suggested by\n(1)–(8) etc. (e.g., Lewis 1972). In the interpretationist form, desires\nare not treated as internal state-types found in a causal network.\nRather, desires are treated as states of the whole organism, states\nthat exist in virtue of the organism's displaying enough of\nthe sorts of behaviors suggested by (1)–(8) etc. to be legitimately\ninterpreted (in accordance with general principles of interpretation,\nsuch as a requirement to interpret creatures as means-end consistent)\nas having desires (e.g., Davidson 1980). \n\nAlso worth noting here is work on caring by Agnieszka Jaworska.\nJaworska does not take herself to be developing a theory of desire, and\nindeed appears to hold something like an action-based theory of desire.\nRather, she takes herself to be developing a theory of what it is to\ncare about someone or something. However, the theory which she develops\nlooks much the way a holistic theory of desire would look. To care\nabout someone, on Jaworska's view, is to be motivated to act for\nthat person's welfare (for its own sake), be disposed to feel\ngood at the prospect of the person doing well and bad at the prospect\nof the person doing poorly, to tend to attend to features of the\nperson's welfare, to have emotions in keeping with this general\npackage—fear when the person's welfare is in peril,\nrelief when all works out for the best, and so on. Thus, while this is\nnot Jaworska's intention, one can read her as offering a holistic\ntheory of desire focused on a subclass of desires: those that can be\nsaid to constitute caring about something or someone (Jaworska 2007a;\n2007b; 1999). \n\nWith a theory of desire in hand one can go on to consider a number\nof varieties of desire. Even if desires form a large unified group of\nmental states, there is certainly room for there to be sub-types of\ndesire, and a number have been discussed. \n\nAccording to most theories, desires are always desires for\nconceivable states of affairs. A desire for tea is a desire for a\ncertain state of affairs one has in mind: that one drink some tea. A\ndesire for a new pair of skates is likewise a desire for another state\nof affairs: that one own a new pair of skates. And so on. This idea is\nalso expressed with phrases such as ‘desires are attitudes toward\npropositions’ or ‘desires have propositional\ncontent’. Treating desires in this way makes it easy to see how\nthere could be logical relations between the contents of beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions. \n\nA competing way of thinking about desires holds that some or all\ndesires are desires for objects, not states of affairs. A desire for\ntea is simply for tea, not for any state of affairs involving the tea.\nThis competing way of thinking has the advantage that it takes\nseriously the way we ordinarily talk about desires and think about\nthem. It is far more natural to say that I desire tea than to say that\nI desire that I have some tea, and perhaps this naturalness is\nindicative of something deep about the nature of desire. Furthermore,\nit might well seem that non-human animals have desires without being\nable to grasp the propositions a grip on which we so readily attribute\nto human beings (Thagard 2006). \n\nA response, though, is that the natural phrasing conceals some of\nthe complexity inherent in desire, and that the non-human animals who\nhave desires have structure to their cognitive capacities that is\nexpressed by talking about propositional content. If Nora desires tea,\nthere is a fact of the matter about which of the following four states\nof affairs is one in which her desire is satisfied: \n\nIf it is (3) that would satisfy Nora's desire, then there\nseems much gained and little lost in saying that Nora's desire is\nfor a state of affairs: that she drink a cup of tea in the near future.\nAnd likewise, if an owl desires a vole it seems that there is a fact of\nthe matter about which of the counterpart states of affairs it is that\nwould satisfy the owl's desire (and the counterpart to (3) seems\nmost likely). \n\nEven if it is accepted that desires are for conceivable states of\naffairs, there are other complications remaining. Some have pointed to\nthe difficulties of specifying exactly what is desired: even if Nora\nwants to now drink a cup of tea, she might protest that she hasn't\nreceived what she wants if it turns out that the tea is very stale, or\nlaced with arsenic, or brought by a robber, or … (e.g., Lycan\n2012). Others have pointed to the difficulties generated by\nconditional desires, such as the desire to have beer later if one is\nnot too tired (e.g., McDaniel and Bradley 2008). \n\nSome desires are for states of affairs that are wanted for\nthemselves: these are intrinsic desires. It is generally agreed that\npleasure is desired for its own sake, and it is plausible that many\npeople also desire the welfare of their children, the success of their\nfavorite sports teams, and the end of injustice, and desire them all\nintrinsically. To desire something intrinsically is not to desire it\nexclusively for its own sake, but to desire it at least partially for\nits own sake: my father desires my welfare in part for my own sake, but\nno doubt he also desires it in part because he would have trouble\nsleeping were I doing poorly, and he does not want to lose sleep. \n\nThat is to say, my father desires my welfare both intrinsically and\ninstrumentally: as a means to an end. Normally, however, one calls a\ndesire ‘instrumental’ when one means it is merely\ninstrumental: when one means that the end is desired merely as a means\nto some other end, and not at all for its own sake (instrumental\ndesires are also sometimes called ‘extrinsic’). \n\nAn interesting case of instrumental desires might be many of the\nso-called ‘second-order desires’ that have been discussed\nin the wake of Harry Frankfurt's work. According to Frankfurt, it\nis the power to form desires about their own desires, i.e.,\nsecond-order desires, that makes us persons, makes us beings capable of\nhaving cares, loves, and free will (e.g., Frankfurt 1971; 1999).\nSecond-order desires are desires regarding one's first-order\ndesires, and first-order desires are desires for ordinary\n(non-conative) things such as snacks or the trouncing of the New York\nYankees. Thus, a desire to yell at a drunken reveler who disturbs my\nsleep is a first-order desire, while a desire that I not act on my\ndesire to yell at the drunken reveler is a second-order desire. If one\nconsiders whether such a second-order desire is intrinsic or\ninstrumental, the most reasonable conclusion is typically that the\ndesire is instrumental: I desire not to act on my desire to yell\nbecause I desire to not have rocks thrown at my window, and I see not\nacting on my desire to yell as a means to not having rocks thrown at my\nwindow. (Note that David Lewis' discussion of the role of\nsecond-order desires in valuing requires that they be intrinsic\ndesires. This raises an interesting question: how often would a\nsecond-order desire be truly intrinsic? See Lewis 1989.) \n\nIn the above scenario, I might also intrinsically desire to be civil\nand tolerant, and see not acting on my desire to yell as a way to be\ncivil and tolerant. But in this case, the relation between my\nintrinsic desire and my desire not to act on my desire to yell is not\nquite an instrumental relation. Refraining from acting on my desire to\nyell is not a means for achieving the end of civil and tolerant\nbehavior.  Rather, it is an instance of civil and tolerant\nbehavior. In such situations, it is said that my desire not to act on\nmy desire to yell is a realizer desire: a desire for an end that would\ncount as one possible realization of an intrinsic desire. This sort of\ndesire gets some discussion in, e.g., Arpaly and Schroeder (2014) and\nSchmidtz (1994). \n\nIt is generally held that desires come on a continuum of\nstrength: desires can be stronger or weaker. The strength of a\ndesire is typically said to be constituted by the desire's causal\npower regarding the control of action: for one desire to be stronger\nthan another is for the agent to be disposed to act upon it, rather than\nthe second desire, in a situation in which (a) all else is equal, and\n(b) the agent believes that each desire is satisfiable by a distinct\naction, and (c) the agent believes that the desires are not jointly\nsatisfiable. This way of characterizing desire strength is obviously\nmost suited to an action-based theory of desire. But for each theory of\ndesire there is a corresponding theory of desire strength available.\nDesire strength could be determined by the amount of pleasure or\ndispleasure apparent satisfaction of the desire would bring, or by the\ndegree to which a state of affairs seems good, or by the degree to\nwhich one's attention is drawn to the reasons to bring some state\nof affairs about, or by the amount of reward-based learning apparent\nsatisfaction of the desire would cause, or by some average of all of\nthese. \n\nMost theorists have little more to say about desire strength than\nwhat appears above. An exception is found in the work of decision\ntheorists: within decision theory, preference is given a formal\ncharacterization, and through this formal characterization, various\nresults can be proven. A foundational result about desire strength is\nthat, if a minimally rational person has set of pairwise preferences\n(for A over B, for C over D, and so on), these pairwise preferences can\nbe used to determine the strengths of preferences. That is, from a\nlarge set of basic facts about what is preferred to what, facts about\nhow much each thing must be preferred to the other can be derived\n(e.g., von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944). \n\nOne puzzle for most theories of desire strength is that desires seem\nto vary in their power to manifest the typical signs of strength even\nwhen it would seem that there is no variation in how much their ends\nare wanted. Think of a standard intrinsic desire: a desire for the\nwelfare of a child. My disposition to act so as to benefit Cecilia\nmight well be stronger when I am in a good mood than when I am feeling\nlow, it might well be stronger when I am wide awake than when I am very\nsleepy, might well be stronger when the change in welfare will happen\nright now rather than in a month, and so on. These changes in\ndisposition seem unlikely to mark changes in how much I desire\nCecelia's welfare, however. Rather, they would seem to mark\nchanges in how effectively my desire is poised to influence my actions.\nSimilarly, the idea of certain harms to Cecelia's welfare will\nmake me feel terrible (the idea of her being bitten by a dog, say)\nwhile others will make me feel less terrible (the idea of her getting\nchicken pox, say), even while my estimation of the harm to her welfare\nmight make the two scenarios quite similar. Again, this would seem to\nindicate some idiosyncrasy in how effectively my desire is poised to\ninfluence my feelings, rather than indicating a difference in strength\nof desire (in this case, getting chicken pox seems like an expected\nordeal of childhood, and that seems to blunt my felt response). And\nlikewise for appearances of goodness and dispositions to pay\nattention. \n\nAn advantage shared by learning-based theories and holistic theories\nof desire is that they are, in a natural way, able to hold that the\nstrength of a desire can be a constant even while the effect of the\ndesire on action, feelings, or thoughts seems disproportionate to the\ndesire's strength. In the case of learning-based theories of\ndesire, so long as there is a merely causal relation between the\nlearning signal and the ordinary signs of desire strength, there is no\ncontradiction in holding that a strong desire has effects like those of\na weak desire, or vice versa. In the case of holistic theories, so long\nas desire strength is not reduced to strength of a single phenomenon,\nthere is no contradiction in holding that a strong desire has one or a\nfew effects like those of a weak desire, or vice versa. It is when\ntheories reduce desires to a single observable core phenomenon that\napparently meaningless fluctuations in that phenomenon pose a\nproblem. \n\nIf Nora desires tea, then her desire is likely to be manifest: Nora\nis likely to be aware of her desire, and her desire is likely to\ngenerate its characteristic effects so long as Nora continues to desire\ntea. On the other hand, if Ben desires a new pair of skates, then his\ndesire is not likely to be manifest all the time. A new pair of skates\nis something Ben might well desire for two or three months before\ngetting a new pair, and it is unlikely that his desire will be\nmanifesting itself for that entire time. More likely, Ben's\ndesire will lie quietly “in the back of his mind” most of\nthe time, and occasionally generate thoughts, feelings, and actions of\nthe familiar sorts. \n\nStanding desires are desires one has that are not playing any role\nin one's psyche at the moment. Occurrent desires, on the other\nhand, are desires that are playing some role in one's\npsyche at the moment. Notice here that occurrent desires need not be in\ncontrol of one's actions: my desire to laze in bed is occurrent\neven while I am getting up and making breakfast, for my desire is\nleading me to think longingly of bed, and is perhaps acting upon my\nmechanisms of action production in a way that would lead me back to bed\nif only I did not also desire to get some things done. Desires of which\none is not aware, but which are current causes of one's behavior,\nare also occurrent on this way of thinking about things: a desire for a\nnew inkstand might cause one to move clumsily so as to destroy\none's current inkstand without affecting one's thoughts or\nfeelings, and if so it would be occurrent at the moment of\nclumsiness. \n\nSome philosophers hold that only occurrent desires are real desires.\nSo-called standing desires are really just dispositions to generate\ndesires, on this way of thinking. One difficulty for this position is\nthat standing desires seem to be good components of causal explanations\nof various mental processes. For instance: why does the new tin of tea\non the counter of her boyfriend's kitchen catch Nora's\nattention? It might be that it caught her attention because she has a\nstanding desire to know about the tea that is available to her, and the\ntin in her boyfriend's kitchen is relevant to this desire. Why is\nNora delighted to see the tin? Because she has a standing desire to try\nnew kinds of tea, and she has just seen that the tin contains a new\nkind of tea. And so on. The ground of the disposition to generate\noccurrent desires can do for these sorts of explanations, but it is\ntruer to ordinary thinking about the mind to say that this ground just\nis a desire—a standing desire—than to say that it is\nanything else. \n\nSome philosophers hold that all occurrent desires are elements of\none's conscious life. Just as I have a capacity to see red that\nis not exercised until seeing red is an element of my consciousness, so\ntoo I have a capacity to desire that my French be fluent, and this\ncapacity is not exercised until desiring that my French be fluent is an\nelement of my consciousness. Notice that the thesis is not just that\ndesires are only sometimes objects of one's conscious life. That\nis, the thesis is not merely that I am only sometimes conscious of my\ndesires in the same way that I am only sometimes conscious of my toes.\nRather, the thesis in question is that there is a qualitative character\nto desire, a qualitative character that can be an element, feature, or\naspect of one's consciousness. Any philosopher holding that\ndesires are constituted by pleasures or seemings might well take this\nposition (e.g., Oddie 2005; Stampe 1987; Strawson 1994). Against it the\nargument has been made that the direction of fit of desire is\nincompatible with the direction of fit of elements of consciousness, on\nthe grounds that desires (roughly) say how things should be while\nconsciousness (roughly) says how things are (Hulse, Read, and Schroeder\n2004). \n\nBecause desires feature prominently in theories of mind, action,\nfree will, and morality (and more!), desires are enmeshed in far too\nmany controversies to enumerate them all here. Nonetheless, some\ncontroversies surrounding desires are worthy of special attention,\neither because they are controversies surrounding key features of\ndesire (the first three that follow) or because they are controversies\nthat illustrate the larger role of desires in philosophical theorizing,\nespecially ethical theorizing (the second three). \n\nSince Anscombe, desires are said to have a “direction of\nfit,” and one that is the opposite to the “direction of\nfit” of beliefs. One modest way of putting the point is this:\nbeliefs are like declarative sentences, which are satisfied (made true)\nby whether the world as it is conforms to them, but desires are like\nimperative sentences, which are satisfied (fulfilled) by changes in the\nworld bringing the world into conformity with them. What exactly\nthis analogy amounts to, literally, is controversial. Is it perhaps\nthat one's beliefs ought to conform to the world, whereas the\nworld ought to conform to one's desires (Gregory 2012)? Is it perhaps that the\nworld tends to cause satisfied beliefs (true beliefs), while desires\ntend to cause there to be a desire-satisfying (desire-fulfilling)\nworld? This is still an area in which it is difficult to know just how\nto evaluate the proposals on offer, and there is little sign of a\nconsensus emerging in the foreseeable future (see, e.g., Anscombe 2000;\nSchueler 1991; Smith 1994; Zangwill 1998). \n\nAnother and related puzzle is over whether there might be states of\nmind with both desire-like and belief-like directions of fit. These\nstates of mind, sometimes called ‘besires’, are said to be\nof particular interest to ethicists interested in the possibility of\nbelief-like attitudes motivating action all on their own (see, e.g.,\nSmith 1994 chapter 4; Zangwill 2008). \n\nThere is relatively little mystery about the generation of\ninstrumental and realizer desires. These desires are generated by\n(conscious or unconscious) reasoning processes, in which one reasons\none's way to the conclusion that if only it were the case that\np that would make it more likely that q or would be a\nrealization of q. If it so happens that one already\nintrinsically desires that q, then this reasoning process will\nautomatically and unconsciously generate an instrumental or realizer\ndesire that p, at least in rational beings. (The strength of\nthe new desire, in a rational individual, and all else being equal,\nincreases with the strength of the intrinsic desire that q and\nthe apparent usefulness of bringing it about that p toward\nbringing it about that q.) Or at least, this picture is a\nrelatively uncontroversial one among philosophers who treat\ninstrumental and realizer desires as components in a causal network\nthat might be investigated by science. Philosophers who approach the\nmind as a field for interpretation are more likely to hold a\nnon-mechanistic version of this story according to which a person\nshould be interpreted as instrumentally or realizationally desiring\np when we already interpret her as intrinsically desiring\nq and we already interpret her as believing that p\nwould make q more likely. \n\nThe generation of intrinsic desires is a matter of much more\ncontroversy and interest. The psychological hedonist holds that there\nis only one intrinsic desire—for pleasure—and this\ndesire is innate (e.g., Pollock 2006). Philosophers who believe that we\nhave a rich collection of intrinsic desires, including desires for the\nwelfare of those we love and the success of those sports teams we\nsupport, are left with more difficult questions, however. Perhaps some\nof our desires are innate (for pleasure, for gentle touches and hugs,\nfor adequate nutrition and hydration…) but many of our intrinsic\ndesires clearly are not. If Ben intrinsically desires success for the\nColumbus Blue Jackets, this is certainly not a result of the innate\nstructure of his mind. \n\nSome have proposed that it is possible to acquire new intrinsic\ndesires by reasoning. According to Michael Smith, if one believes that,\nwere one rational, one would desire that p, then this will\ntend to generate an intrinsic desire that p. Thus, if I\nbelieve that, were I rational, I would want to give money to the Third\nWorld, then this will tend to generate an intrinsic desire in me to\ngive money to the Third World (Smith 1994). There is a difficulty here\nin evaluating Smith's idea. It certainly seems as though thinking\nabout what I would—were I only perfectly rational—want\nto do is the sort of thing that can generate a new desire in me. But it\nis less clear that the desire generated is intrinsic as opposed to a\nrealizer desire (a realizer for the desire to do what is rational, or\nperhaps moral). Phenomenologically, it seems difficult to distinguish\nthe two, and so it is not easy to evaluate Smith's theory. These\ndifficulties have not prevented philosophers from trying, however\n(e.g., Dreier 2000). \n\nAn interesting consequence of Smith's proposal is that it\nmakes it rational to have certain intrinsic desires, and irrational to\nlack other intrinsic desires, depending on what one believes to be\ntrue. This is a departure from a view of desires stemming at least from\nDavid Hume, according to which beliefs have no business dictating what\nwe should desire intrinsically. (At most, beliefs can dictate what we\nshould desire as a means or realizer to what we desire intrinsically,\naccording to this line of thought.) But it aligns Smith with those who\ntake it to be part of the business of reasoning to set “final\nends” (e.g., Richardson 1997). \n\nAnother proposal regarding the generation of intrinsic desires\nleaves rationality out of the picture entirely. According to this\nproposal, new intrinsic desires are acquired by associating new states\nof affairs with ones that already satisfy existing intrinsic desires,\naccording to the principles of reward-based learning. So, if a young\nchild intrinsically desires a dry bottom and a full stomach, and is\naware that its mother's presence tends to help with these things,\nthen the young child will naturally desire its mother's presence\ninstrumentally. But whether the child is aware of the instrumental\nrelationship or not, if the mother's presence often presages the\nsatisfaction of the child's intrinsic desires for a dry bottom\nand full stomach, then the learning processes generated by desire\nsatisfaction will also tend to cause the young child to acquire an\nintrinsic desire for the presence of its mother (Schroeder 2004). \n\nTalk of preference, rather than desire, tends to dominate the\nliterature of decision theory. The decision theorist sees human beings\nas making choices between options, and these choices express\npreferences among the options. If the human being is rational, her\npreferences are consistent and allow one to determine the expected\nutility of any given choice for her. The expected utility of an action,\nin turn, is the pleasure (or relief from suffering) it can be expected\nto bring, according to one (mostly older) approach, or is the degree to\nwhich the agent would (ideally) be inclined to choose it, according to\nthe other (more modern) approach to utility (see, e.g., Skyrms 1990 for\na discussion). \n\nIf utility is treated as pleasure, then decision theory is\ncompatible with any theory of desire that holds pleasure to be the only\nthing desired. If utility is treated as choice-worthiness, then\ndecision theory is compatible with any theory of desire at all (except\nperhaps for theories that hold desires are beliefs in goodness, as\ndiscussed in section 1.3). So the focus on preferences does not, on its\nown, generate conflict between decision theory and theories of\ndesire. \n\nConflict can arise, however, when one asks whether desires or\npreferences are more fundamental; John Pollock has recently brought\nattention to this dispute (Pollock 2006). Decision theorists have\ntended to treat pairwise preferences as basic: the basic attitude is\nthat of preferring A to B (e.g., von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944).\nMost other theorists of desire have treated desires as basic: the basic\nattitude is that of desiring A. If desires are basic, and desires have\nstrengths, then it is easy enough to determine preferences from them:\nif I desire that my father be healthy to a high degree, and I desire\nthat I do my laundry to a low degree, then it follows that I prefer my\nfather's health to doing the laundry, all else being equal. But\nif preferences are basic, then deriving something like desires from\nthem becomes an interesting task (discussed briefly above, in Section\n2.3). \n\nThe simplest reason to suppose that preferences are basic is that they\nare readily introspected and acted upon, whereas desires with specific\nstrengths are not. I can tell that I prefer securing my father's\nhealth to doing the laundry, and I know which I would choose if it\ncame to a choice. But can I introspect the degree to which I prefer my\nfather's health over clean laundry? Perhaps not. And if I cannot,\nperhaps this is because I have introspective access to the most basic\npsychological facts only, and these are facts about simple pairwise\npreferences. As von Neumann and Morgenstern write, “every\nmeasurement—or rather every claim of measurability—must\nultimately be based on some immediate sensation, which possibly cannot\nand certainly need not be analyzed any further. In the case of utility\nthe immediate sensation of preference—of one object or aggregate\nof objects as against another—provides this basis” (1944,\n16). \n\nOne reason to suppose that preferences are not basic is that it\nappears, within standard decision theory, that a very large number of\nbasic pairwise preferences are required in order to settle facts about\nhow much one prefers A to B for arbitrary objects A and B. That is, the\nfacts about degrees of desire can only be generated from more basic\nfacts about pairwise preferences given a truly enormous number of basic\nfacts about pairwise preferences. Pollock (2006) argues that the number\nof such facts is on the order of a billion billions at the very least,\njust to encode the same facts about desire and preference that could\nreadily be generated from just three hundred basic facts about desires.\nFrom the assumption that the basic psychological facts must be\nphysically realized in the brain, Pollock concludes that it is\npsychologically realistic to believe in basic desires, not basic\npairwise preferences. \n\nComplicating matters is empirical research suggesting that our\npreferences are subject to such powerful contextual influences that it\nis better to talk about the construction of coherent preferences than\nabout their derivation from underlying desires (see, e.g., the papers\nin Lichtenstein and Slovic 2006). For example, in a classic study, it\nwas found that offering subjects a free choice between one of two bets\n(of almost identical expected value—around $4—but with\ndifferent maximum payoffs and different maximum penalties) led to\nsubjects revealing a preference for one of the two bets. Offering the\nsame subjects a chance to bid on each bet revealed that subjects were\noften willing to pay more to play the other of the two bets, apparently\nshowing that subjects preferred the other of the two bets when bidding\nbut not when choosing freely (Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971). Thus,\nsomething as minimal as the difference between choosing and bidding can\nshift preferences between two near-equivalent bets, or so it would\nseem, calling into question the very existence of a stable fact about\npreference independent of the way a choice is framed. If this is the\nbest way to look at things, then perhaps it will turn out that a small\nnumber of preferences are basic, and that there just are no facts about\nthe degree to which something is desired overall by a person. \n\nTurning to meta-ethics, a vibrant debate exists over the relation of\ndesires to reasons to act. According to one tradition, typically called\n‘Humean’ or ‘Neo-Humean’, the existence of\nreasons to act depends on the existence of desires possessed by the\nagent who would act. Thus, my reason to drink hot chocolate depends on\nmy desires, and likewise my reason to help a stranger depends on my\ndesires, according to the Humean. \n\nSome have taken Humeanism to claim that reasons are identical to the\nhaving of desires (so that my reason to drink hot chocolate is the fact\nthat I desire to drink hot chocolate) while others have taken Humeanism\nto claim that reasons are (typically) non-desire states of affairs that\nare reasons in virtue of their relations to desires (so that my reason\nto drink hot chocolate is that it tastes a certain way, but that it\ntastes a certain way is only a reason to drink hot chocolate because I\ndesire to experience such tastes). Though related, these two positions\nhave substantially different implications, as Mark Schroeder has argued\n(Schroeder 2007). \n\nHumeans have defended their position in several ways, but\ncontemporary debate has focused in large part on an argument developed\nby Bernard Williams. Williams argues that only Humeanism can explain\nthe relation between reasons and motivation: if one has a reason to\nact, then one can act for that reason, Williams holds. But this is only\nguaranteed if having a reason to act involves having a desire. Hence\nreasons to act depend on the existence of desires (Williams 1981).\nTaking a somewhat different approach, Mark Schroeder argues that, when\nproperly formulated, Humeanism simply fits best with our range of\nintuitions about what reasons there are to act and the ways in which\nthese reasons are or are not contingent on facts about our psychologies\n(Schroeder 2007). \n\nAttacks on the Humean position have often been motivated by moral\nconsiderations: one does not need to have any desires whatsoever (not\ndesires properly so-called, at any rate) in order to have a reason to\ndo what is moral, according to some anti-Humeans, and so this\nparticular reason to act, at least, is not in any way dependent upon\ndesires (e.g., Schueler 1995). A more fundamental attack has been\nlaunched by Christine Korsgaard, who argues that, if it is true that\nthere is a reason to act on one's desires, then this is a\nfundamental evaluative fact—and so there is no reason to be\nskeptical about parallel fundamental evaluative facts that entail there\nare reasons independent of one's desires (Korsgaard 1997). \n\nWithin normative ethics there is some interest in the notion of a\nperson's happiness, welfare, or well-being, especially within\nconsequentialist approaches to morality holding that a moral action is\none that maximizes well-being. One approach to well-being holds that a\nperson's well-being stems from the satisfaction of her\ndesires. \n\nA central feature of desire-based theories of well-being is that\nthey take actual states of affairs to be what is important to a\nperson's well-being, rather than the person's perceptions\nof actuality. Thus, if I desire that I win an Olympic gold medal, then\nI am only well off in this respect if I win the medal: if I get tricked\ninto believing that I have won the medal when I have not, then my\nwell-being has not been increased in the relevant respect. This might\nbe an advantage for desire-based theories of well-being (mere trickery\nseems unlikely to increase my actual well-being) or it might be a\ndisadvantage (what I do not know cannot hurt me, can it?). Discussion\nof this point is ongoing (e.g., Sumner 1996). \n\nA challenge for desire-based theories of well-being is that we would\nseem to have some desires the satisfaction of which would not,\nultimately, contribute to our well-being in any obvious sense. Desires\nstemming from ignorance, from neurosis, or the like might be of this\nsort. Brandt (1979) develops a well known response to these sorts of\nconcerns, arguing that the desires the satisfaction of which would\ncontribute to one's well-being are those that would survive a\nprocess of “cognitive psychotherapy.” \n\nDesire-based theories of well-being have been challenged both by\nthose who find them insufficiently attentive to the individual's\nstate of mind, especially to the pleasure enjoyed by the individual\n(e.g., Feldman 2004), and by those who find them excessively attentive\nto the individual's state of mind, to the exclusion of what is\nessential to human flourishing (e.g., Nussbaum 2000, chapter 1). \n\nWithin moral psychology, desire features prominently in a debate\nover the conditions for moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness. \n\nAccording to a familiar Kantian doctrine, a person is only\npraiseworthy for doing the right thing if the person acts only from the\nmotive of duty, and not from an “inclination” (a desire) to\ndo the right thing (Kant 1964). Thus, if the right thing to do is to\nsupport microlending in Africa, and I do so, then I am praiseworthy\nonly if I have acted out of my intellectual grasp of the fact that\nsupporting microlending is my duty. If have acted out of a desire to\nfeel good about myself, or even a desire to be kind or to work for\njustice, then I am not praiseworthy for doing the right thing. The\nthesis has also been defended by contemporary Kantians (e.g., Herman\n1993, chapter 1). \n\nOpposing the familiar Kantian doctrine is work by Nomy Arpaly, who\nargues that praiseworthiness in fact requires acting on certain\ndesires—namely, desires for what is in fact good (Arpaly 2002;\nsee also Arpaly and Schroeder 2014). In Arpaly's view, acting rightly\nfrom a sense of duty is compatible with acting rightly in a way that\nis not praiseworthy at all, if one's view of duty is sufficiently\nmistaken that one ends up doing the right thing only by\naccident. Thus, if the right thing to do is to support microlending in\nAfrica, and I do so, then I am praiseworthy according to Arpaly only\nif I have acted out of a desire to be kind (if that is the content of\nmorality) or a desire to do what is just (if that is the content of\nmorality). \n\nBetween the contrasting views of Kant and Arpaly are the views of a\nnumber of virtue ethicists, Aristotle (perhaps) among them, who hold\nthat a desire to do what is right and knowledge of the right are both\nrequired for an otherwise appropriate act to be praiseworthy (e.g.,\nAristotle 1999, Hursthouse 1999).","contact.mail":"timothy.a.schroeder@rice.edu","contact.domain":"rice.edu"}]
