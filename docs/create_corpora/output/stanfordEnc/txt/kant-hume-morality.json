Kant\ncredited Hume with waking him from his “dogmatic slumber”,\nand he describes the Critique of Pure Reason, arguably\nthe most important work of modern philosophy, as the solution to\nthe “Humean problem in its greatest possible\namplification” (Prol 4:260–61). Much of the focus has been\non their respective views in metaphysics and epistemology. Yet, as\nThomas Nagel remarks, contemporary moral philosophy also\n“continues to be dominated by the disagreement between these two\ngiants” (Nagel 2012). Comparing Hume and Kant therefore provides\nopportunity to clarify and assess two of the modern era’s most\ninfluential approaches to the central problems of moral philosophy.\nComparing their views also illuminates the landscape of\neighteenth-century ethical thought. Although there are many points at\nwhich Kant’s and Hume’s ethics stand in opposition to each\nother, there are also important connections between the two. Kant\nshared with Hume some important assumptions about morality, virtue,\nand motivation. Indeed, early in his career he had been attracted to\nthe sentimentalism of Hume and other British moralists, especially\nFrancis Hutcheson (1694–1746), and the influence lingered long\nafter he changed his mind about the value of their approach.\n\n\nFor the sake of brevity, this article assumes familiarity with\nHume’s and Kant’s main contributions to moral philosophy.\nThe aim here is not to summarize their views or compare them on all\nmatters ethical. Instead, the task is to examine several key areas\nwhere we can reasonably see Kant as responding to or influenced by\nHume, or where comparisons between their views are particularly\nfruitful.\n\n\n\n\nHume and Kant operate with two somewhat different conceptions of\nmorality itself, which helps explain some of the differences\nbetween their respective approaches to moral philosophy. The\nmost important difference is that Kant sees law, duty, and obligation\nas the very heart of morality, while Hume does not. In this respect,\nKant’s conception of morality resembles what Bernard Williams\ncalls “the moral system”, which defines the domain of\nmorality primarily in terms of an unconditionally binding and\ninescapable form of obligation (Williams 1985: 193–94). Kant\nbelieves that our moral concerns are dominated by the question of what\nduties are imposed on us by a law that commands with a uniquely moral\nnecessity. Like most eighteenth-century philosophers, he also believes\nthat our moral lives are preoccupied with the question of how to be\nvirtuous over the course of a life, but he defines virtue in terms of\nthe more fundamental concepts of law, obligation, and duty. By\ncontrast, these concepts certainly figure into morality as Hume\nunderstands it, but they are far less central. For Hume, the broader\nand somewhat looser notion of “personal merit” lies at the\nheart of morality (EPM 9.1.1). Our moral concerns are dominated by the\nquestion of which motives are virtuous, and we answer this question by\nlooking to the responses of our fellow human beings, who—when\nviewing things properly—approve of those motives and character\ntraits that are useful or immediately agreeable (EPM 9.1.13). These\nare the terms that characterize duty and obligation for Hume, rather\nthan the other way around. \nTwo other differences are worth noting for the purposes of this\narticle. First, Kant draws a bright line between moral and non-moral\nphenomena, such as prudence, politics, or art. Morality’s\nnormative standards and the nature of its demands distinguish it\nsharply from the non-moral. For Hume, the line between the moral and\nnon-moral is far blurrier. He frequently assimilates moral judgment to\n“taste” or judgments about beauty and deformity (Gill\n2007), and he explicitly argues against the strict separation of moral\nvirtues from other personal qualities such as a quick wit or even good\nlooks (T 3.3.4–5). According to Hume, the strict separation of\nmoral and non-moral virtues marks one way in which modern moral\nthought is inferior to ancient ethics; he also seems to suspect that\nit reflects an unhealthy fixation on responsibility and guilt\ninherited from Christianity (Darwall 2013: 8–9). A second\nimportant difference is closely related to the first. For Kant the\nmoral is distinguished from the non-moral not only by a special form\nof obligation but also by its elevation above the rest of life.\nMorality itself has a unique status or “dignity”, as does\nthe rational being from whose autonomous will the law springs (G\n4:435). The proper response to both is a correspondingly unique form\nof reverence or “respect”, which morality demands equally\nfrom each of us. Kant believes that in the moral domain we take\nourselves—often only implicitly—to be\n“persons”, elevated above mere “things” such\nas machines or other animals. One of our chief moral concerns is to\nprotect this status, which requires respecting the rational autonomy\nat its source and avoiding behavior or patterns of thought and desire\nthat dishonor or degrade persons by treating ourselves or others as\nmere things. This concern looms large in Kant’s conception of\nmorality, and it has a profound influence on his approach to moral\nphilosophy (Anderson 2008). We see it, for example, in his discussions\nof respect for persons and his characterization of ethical virtue as\n“love of honor” (cf. Denis 2014). We see it also in the\npriority given to duties to self (cf. Denis 2010a), as well as\nKant’s claim that a person throws herself away and makes herself\nan object of “contempt” when she lies to herself or\ngrovels before others, for example (MM 6:420). Hume does not see things\nthis way. For Hume, the domain of morality is not particularly pure,\nspecial, or elevated. It sometimes shows us at our most benevolent or\nmost magnanimous, but morality is continuous with the rest of life,\nincluding politics and the pursuit of wealth and status in modern\ncommercial society. Moral virtue is undoubtedly pleasing to us,\nsometimes powerfully so, but it does not command a unique\nform of respect or reverence. Neither do the rules and ideals of\nmorality, which spring from the same propensities, ideas, and passions\nthat drive the rest of human behavior. Notions of honor and dignity\nmay figure into Hume’s view of morality but they are far from\ncentral. Morality has us far more concerned with promoting pleasure\nand utility. \nHume and Kant both believe that philosophy should dig beneath the\nsurface of morality and present a theory of its foundation. When it\ncomes to morality’s foundation, they seem to agree on two\nthings. First, morality’s foundation cannot be located in\nreligion. Second, it cannot be found in mind-independent facts about\nthe world. Yet they disagree about the rest of the story. Hume locates\nthe foundation of morality in human nature, primarily in our emotional\nresponses to the behavior of our fellow human beings. By contrast,\nKant locates the foundation of morality in the rational nature that we\nshare with all possible finite rational beings. He argues that\nmorality’s foundation lies in the “autonomy” of the\nrational will. Kant’s notion of autonomy is one of the more\ncentral, distinctive, and influential aspects of his ethics. He\ndefines autonomy as “the property of the will by which it is a\nlaw to itself (independently of any property of the objects of\nvolition)” (G 4:440). According to Kant, the will of a moral\nagent is autonomous in that it both gives itself the moral law (is\nself-legislating) and can constrain or motivate itself to follow the\nlaw (is self-constraining or self-motivating). The source of the moral\nlaw is not in the agent’s feelings, natural impulses or\ninclinations, but in her “pure” rational will, which Kant\nidentifies as the “proper self” (G 4:461). A heteronomous\nwill, on the other hand, is governed by something other than itself,\nsuch as an external force or authority. \nThese rival conceptions of morality and its foundation correspond to\ntwo very different approaches to moral philosophy. Hume’s\napproach could be called naturalistic, empirical, or experimental. His\nmoral philosophy is part of his larger endeavor to provide a\nnaturalistic explanation of human nature as a whole. Hume’s\napproach relies on and reflects his philosophy of mind, which is\nempirical in its approach. He treats ethics, together with psychology,\nhistory, aesthetics, and politics, as the subject of his “moral\nscience”. Hume often seems more interested in explaining\nmorality as a natural phenomenon than in setting out a normative\nethical theory, treating moral action as part of the same physical\nworld in which we explain things in terms of cause and effect (EHU\n8.1.20–22). On this view, everything we do is open to empirical\ninvestigation and explanation. In fact, Hume often compares humans\nwith other animals, tracing the bases of human morality to features of\nthe mind that human beings and other animals have in common (T\n2.1.12). \nIn sharp contrast with Hume, Kant insists on the need for an a\npriori investigation of morality’s foundation. His detailed\ntreatment of virtue and moral judgment draws heavily on observations\nand ideas about human nature. But Kant makes explicit that morality\nmust be based on a supreme moral principle, which can only be\ndiscovered a priori, through a method of pure moral\nphilosophy (G 4:387–92). By “pure” or a\npriori moral philosophy, Kant has in mind a philosophy grounded\nexclusively on principles that are inherent in and revealed through\nthe operations of reason. According to Kant, morality’s commands\nare unconditional. We could never discover a principle that commands\nall rational beings with such absolute authority through a method of\nempirical moral philosophy. An empirical approach, he argues, can tell\nus how people do act, but it cannot tell us how we ought to act.\nMoreover, we must keep the pure and empirical parts of moral\nphilosophy clearly distinguished, since if we do not we could find\nourselves confusing conditional truths, such as what is prudentially\ngood for certain individuals or species, with unconditional truths\nabout fundamental moral requirements (G 4:389–90). Once one has\nin hand the supreme principle of morality, however, one requires an\nunderstanding of human beings in order to apply it to them (MM 6:217).\nOne can say little about what the supreme moral principle requires as\nduties human agents have to themselves and to one another without\nknowing such things as the sorts of ends people may be inclined to\nadopt and the conditions under which human agency will\ncharacteristically thrive or wither. \nHume’s treatment of causality exerted a profound influence on\nKant. He tells us that his “labor” in the Critique of\nPure Reason was fundamentally a response to “that Humean\nskeptical teaching” (CPrR 5:32). The direct impact of\nHume’s moral philosophy is less clear. Early in his career Kant\nendorsed an idiosyncratic form of sentimentalism. But he often\nindicated that he saw Hutcheson as more significant to ethics than\nHume. He seems to have associated Hutcheson more with the positive\ninsights about the role of sensibility in ethics, whereas he seems to\nhave associated Hume more with skepticism about practical reason\n(Kuehn 2001: 182). Sentimentalism’s positive influence on Kant\nwas strongest during the early part of his career. As his views\ndeveloped, he noted its inadequacies with increasing frequency,\neventually rejecting any version of sentimentalism as a theory of\nmorality’s foundation. Yet elements of the tradition continued\nto influence Kant’s mature thinking about the nature and\nimportance of emotion in morality. \nKant’s early debt to sentimentalism is evident in two of his\npublished works from the 1760s. In Observations on the Feeling of\nthe Beautiful and Sublime (1764), which often reads like the work\nof a mid-eighteenth century British thinker, Kant notes and analyzes\nthe various feelings of pleasure or displeasure, and attraction and\naversion, people feel to different traits and temperaments in\nthemselves and others (and to different types of literature, objects\nin nature, kinds of relationships, and other things). His statements\nabout the foundation of morality and its principles convey a\ncommitment to some form of sentimentalism, however idiosyncratic. He\nclaims, for example, that the principles of morality are  \nnot speculative rules, but the consciousness of a feeling that lives\nin every human breast and that extends much further than to the\nspecial grounds of sympathy and complaisance. (OFBS 2.217)  \nHe describes this as “the feeling of the beauty and the dignity\nof human nature”, proclaiming that one can “bring about\nthe noble attitude that is the beauty of virtue” only when a\nperson “subordinates” her particular inclinations\n“to such an enlarged” feeling of the beauty and dignity of\nhuman nature (OFBS 2.217). Kant expresses a similar line of thought in\nanother work from the period, Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness\nof the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality (1763), where\nhe distinguishes between the faculty for representing truth and the\nfaculty for experiencing the good, identifying the latter with\nfeeling. “Just as there are unanalyzable concepts of\nthe true”, Kant argues,  \nso too there is an unanalyzable feeling of the good… One of the\ntasks of the understanding is to analyze and render distinct the\ncompound and confused concept of the good by showing how it arises\nfrom simpler feelings of the good. (I 2:299) \nOther indications of sentimentalism’s influence can be found in\nKant’s notes and lectures from that period. For example, in the\nannouncement of his lectures for the winter semester of\n1765–1766, he explains one difference between ethics and\nmetaphysics by remarking that  \nthe distinction between good and evil in actions, and the judgment of\nmoral rightness, can be known, easily and accurately, by the human\nheart through what is called sentiment, and that without elaborate\nnecessity of proofs. (WS 2:311)  \nIn the same announcement, he states his intention to develop and clarify\n \nthe attempts of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson and Hume, which, though\nimperfect and defective, have nevertheless come farthest in the\ndiscovery of the first principles of all morality. (WS 2:311)  \nSimilarly, in notes that appear to come from between 1764 and 1768,\nKant writes, “[t]he rules of morality proceed from a special,\neponymous feeling, upon which the understanding is\nguided…” (NF 19:93 #6581). \nIf Kant was genuinely trying out a version of sentimentalism in the\n1760s, this phase did not last long, nor was it a simple adoption of\nthe theories of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, or Hume. His description of\ntheir approach as “imperfect and defective” already\nindicates some dissatisfaction with sentimentalism. By the late 1760s\nit was a theme of Kant’s notes and lectures that it could not\nprovide an adequate account of moral obligation. Morality imposes\nunconditional requirements, and he became increasingly convinced that\nsentimentalism could not explain or justify such requirements.\nArguments for this conclusion appear in Kant’s later written\nworks and lectures. In a number of works, Kant creates taxonomies of\nmisguided, heteronomous ethical theories based on material determining\ngrounds—in contrast to his theory of autonomy, in which the\nmoral motive constitutes an objective, formal determining ground (see\nWood 2005b [Other Internet Resources]; Irwin 2009: chapters 68 and 71;\nand Schneewind 2009). Kant distinguishes among these theories based on\ntheir accounts of the basis of moral obligation or the fundamental\nmoral principle (G 4:441–44; CPrR 5:39–41; C 27:\n252–54; M 29:621–25). Such theories may assume either\nsubjective (empirical) or objective (rational) determining grounds for\nthe moral principle; and within each of these categories, there are\ntheories that assume these determining grounds are external, and\nothers that assume they are internal. Objective, internal grounds\ninclude perfection (e.g., Wolff and the Stoics). Objective, external\ngrounds include the will of God (e.g., Crusius). Subjective, external\ngrounds include education (e.g., Montaigne) or civil constitution\n(e.g., Mandeville). Subjective, internal grounds can include physical\nfeeling, such as self-love (e.g., Epicurus) or self-interest (e.g.,\nHobbes), or moral feeling (e.g., Hutcheson) (CPrR 5:40; C 27:253).\nThus, Kant locates moral sense theories among those theories that\nassume a subjective, empirical, internal determining ground of moral\nfeeling as the principle of morality (cf. M 29:621). \nFrom the Groundwork on, Kant registers a number of complaints\nagainst sentimentalism, all of which cluster around what he takes to\nbe the core insight into its inadequacy. No empirical principles can\nground moral laws, because moral laws bind all rational beings\nuniversally, necessarily, and unconditionally; empirical principles\nare contingent in various ways, for example, on aspects of human\nnature (G 4:442–43). Variance in moral feelings makes them an\ninadequate standard of good and evil (G 4:442). Moral feelings cannot\nbe the source of the supreme moral principle, because the supreme\nmoral principle holds for all rational beings, whereas feelings differ\nfrom person to person (M 29:625). If duty were grounded in feeling, it\nwould seem that morality would bind some people (e.g., the\ntender-hearted) more strongly than others, contrary to the universal,\nequal nature of moral obligation. Even if people were in complete\nagreement regarding their moral feelings, the universality of these\nfeelings would be a contingent matter, and thus an inadequate ground\nfor the unconditionally binding moral law. Indeed, if morality were\ngrounded in feeling, it would be arbitrary: God could have constituted\nus so that we would get from vice the pleasurable, calm feelings of\napproval that we now (allegedly) get from virtue (M 29:625). So for\nKant, the contingency of the ground of obligation offered by moral\nsense theories renders those theories inadequate; only a\npriori determining grounds will do. \nAs these criticisms indicate, Kant’s mature view is\nfundamentally opposed to sentimentalism in a variety of ways. Yet the\ninfluence of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume lingered long after Kant\ncame to believe that morality’s true foundation lies in the\nautonomy of the will, and he continued to find value in their\napproach. In his notes Kant remarks that moral sense theories are\nbetter understood as providing a hypothesis explaining why we in fact\nfeel approval and disapproval of various actions than as supplying a\nprinciple that justifies approval or disapproval or that guides\nactions (NF 19:117 #6626). He also suggests that even if one rejects\nmoral sense “as a principle for the judgment of moral\naction” one might still accept it as a theory “of the\nmind’s incentives to morality” (M 29:625). Quite\nstrikingly, Kant also continues to believe some version of his earlier\nclaim in Observations that some of our feelings indicate a\n“susceptibility of the soul which… makes it fit for\nvirtuous impulses” (OFBS 2:208). We see this in the\nMetaphysics of Morals, for instance, where Kant claims\nthat moral feeling, conscience, love of one’s neighbor, and\nself-respect all “lie at the basis of morality, as\nsubjective conditions of receptiveness to the concept of\nduty” (MM 6:399; see Guyer 2010). The lingering influence of\nsentimentalism can also be seen in his emphasis on the obligation to\n“sympathize actively” with others, and in the claim that\nwe have “an indirect duty to cultivate the compassionate natural\n(aesthetic) feelings in us, and to make use of them as so many means\nto sympathy based on moral principles and the feeling appropriate to\nthem… . For this [compassion] is still one of the impulses that\nnature has implanted in us to do what the representation of duty alone\nmight not accomplish (MM 6:457). \nKant, as discussed above, underwent a decisive change of mind about\nthe views of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. Early in his career, he\nendorsed core aspects of their approach, but Kant’s mature work\nis organized around the idea that reason, rather than feeling\nor emotion, is the highest authority in the moral domain. In this\nrespect, many features of his moral philosophy are fundamentally\nopposed to Hume’s. We can see this opposition at work in their\nrespective accounts of moral judgment and moral motivation. A careful\nlook at these topics, however, also highlights sentimentalism’s\nresidual influence on Kant. \nAccording to Hume, moral judgments typically concern the character\ntraits and motives behind human actions. To make a moral judgment is\nto detect, by means of a sentiment, the operation of a virtuous or\nvicious quality of mind. The sentiment here is a\n“peculiar” kind of feeling—namely, a feeling of\napproval (love, pride) or disapproval (hatred, humility) (T 3.3.1.3).\nWe call the traits that elicit our approval “virtues”, and\nthose that elicit our disapproval “vices”. Sentiments of\napproval and disapproval are passions, but they tend to be “soft\nand gentle” and therefore easily mistaken for thoughts or ideas\n(T 3.1.2.1). The real story is that “morality… is more\nproperly felt than judg’d of” (T 3.1.2.1). Reason and\nexperience are required for determining the likely effects of a given\nmotive or character trait, so reason does play an important role in\nmoral judgment. Yet reason’s role is subordinate. It is one\nthing to say that a given trait tends to be useful or conducive to\npleasure and quite another to say that it is “good” or\n“virtuous”. The moral value of a trait is conferred by the\nsentiment of approval, which “gilding and staining all natural\nobjects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises, in\na manner, a new creation” (EPM App. I.21). Hume argues, however,\nthat only those sentiments experienced from a “general point of\nview” count as genuinely moral (T 3.1.2.4). For example, a\nperson might hate or envy the courage of her enemy but this is not\nnecessarily a moral response. The moral sentiment is\nexperienced when she considers her enemy’s courage from a\n“general point of view” (T 3.1.2.4). When a person\nconsiders things from this point of view, she looks upon them as a\n“judicious spectator”, who is disinterested but not\nemotionally unaffected by the scene she beholds (Cohon 2008:\n126–58). On the contrary, rather than eliminating her\nsentiments, the judicious spectator enlarges them by means of\nsympathy, which enables her to resent the misery of others or rejoice\nin their happiness. (Regarding the mechanism of sympathy, see Taylor\n2015: 189–94.) \nKant offers a very different account of moral judgment. He focuses on\nthe first-person judgments an agent (not a spectator) must make about\nhow to behave. In his view, the primary question is whether a\nparticular mode of conduct is permissible, required, or forbidden in\nlight of the moral law, and sentiment or emotion has no authority in\nthis matter. Answering the question requires an operation of\nreason by means of which the agent determines whether her\nprinciple or “maxim” of conduct conflicts with the moral\nlaw. Because she is an imperfect and finite rational being, the law\npresents itself to her as a “categorical imperative” (CI).\nIt is an imperative because it commands and constrains us; it is\ncategorical because it commands and constrains us with ultimate\nauthority and without regard to our personal preferences or any\nempirically contingent ends (G 4:413–20). The two best known\nformulations of the CI are the formula of universal law (FUL), which\ncommands, “act only in accordance with that maxim through\nwhich you can at the same time will that it become a universal\nlaw” (G 4:421), and the formula of the end in itself (FEI),\nwhich commands, “So act that you use humanity, whether in\nyour own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time\nas an end, never merely as a means” (G 4:429). Scholars\ndisagree about the relationship between these two formulations of the\nCI, as well as their relationship to the other formulations Kant\nprovides. There is also disagreement about whether FUL or FEI has\nprimacy in deliberation and moral judgment. Kant claims that FUL is\nthe standard everyone actually does employ in moral judgment (G 4:402;\nCPrR 5:69), and some scholars defend its primacy (e.g., Engstrom\n2009). Others argue in favor of FEI, emphasizing, in particular, its\nrole in the Metaphysics of Morals, where FEI seems to play\nthe fundamental role in guiding judgment about specific ethical duties\n(e.g., Wood 1999). \nSome passages from Kant’s work seem to suggest that moral\njudgment requires no experience, no knowledge of human nature and\nlocal custom, and no emotional sensitivity. A rational being equipped\nwith a purely formal procedure for testing maxims has all she needs.\nYet such passages are misleading when read in isolation. This is not\nKant’s view of how human beings do, or even should, make moral\njudgments (Wood 2008: 56). First, application of the CI typically\nrequires auxiliary or subordinate “principles of\napplication”, which must be taken from our empirical knowledge\nof human nature (MM 6:217). Second, Kant frequently emphasizes that no\nformal procedure could specify all the principles for applying\nhigher-order principles. Principles of application help us apply\nhigher order principles to concrete circumstances, but there is no\nsubstitute for experience and “judgment”, which is a knack\nor uncodifiable talent (A138/B172). This is why the practice of\ncasuistry is “woven into ethics” (MM 6:411). Third,\nexperience and judgment are also required because the moral law\n“cannot specify precisely in what way one is to act and how much\none is to do by the action for an end that is also a duty” (MM\n6:390). The wider the duty, the more latitude for individual judgment\nand experience (MM 6:390). Finally, it is clear that, on Kant’s\nview, moral judgment requires emotional sensitivity and an\nunderstanding of social convention. For example, without these, one\nmight unable to determine whether a particular act of beneficence is\nmore condescending than kind (MM 6:453) or to prevent friendly banter\nfrom sliding into disrespectful mockery (MM 6:467). Proper moral\njudgment in such circumstances requires attunement to the feelings of\nothers, but also facility with the social conventions that shape the\ndynamics of personal interaction. \nKant and Hume are clearly opposed on the question of whether reason or\nfeeling has the final say in moral matters. Hume assigns reason to a\nsubordinate role, while Kant takes reason to be the highest normative\nauthority. However, it is important not to misunderstand the nature of\ntheir opposition. Hume offers an empirical explanation of the moral\njudgments made in “common life”, which he takes to be part\nof his broader science of human nature. This is his main focus. By\ncontrast, Kant makes observations about the “common” use\nof reason in morality (e.g., G 4:399), but this is not his main focus.\nHe says relatively little about what is going on in our heads or the\nsurrounding social environment when we actually make moral judgments.\nAs noted above, Kant at least entertained the possibility that\nsentimentalism provides the correct empirical explanation of why human\nbeings tend to approve or disapprove of the actions and motives that\nthey do (NF 19:117 #6626). What Kant insists on is that such responses\ncan be justified only by pure reason, which is the only faculty\ncapable of understanding the unconditional necessity of the moral\nlaw’s commands. Emotion or feeling plays an important role in\nguiding our application of this law to particular maxims in concrete\ncircumstances, but feeling’s role is definitely subordinate to\nreason’s. \nA similar contrast between Hume and Kant can be found in their\nrespective accounts of moral motivation. Hume famously claims\nthat “Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions,\nand can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem” (T 2.3.3.4). The claim is not that reason has no role in\nhuman action, but rather that its role is subordinate to passion. Hume\noffers three main arguments for this claim in A Treatise of Human\nNature. (There is debate among interpreters about whether Hume\nchanged his position on reason and motivation between the\nTreatise and the second Enquiry, as well as\nprecisely what Hume’s understanding of the nature, extent, and\nsignificance of reason’s contribution to action is (see, e.g.,\nMilgram 1995; Radcliffe 1997; Cohon 2008: chapters 2 and 3; and Irwin\n2008: chapter 26).) \nAccording to the first argument, “reason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will” (T 2.3.3.1). Abstract (or\ndemonstrative) reasoning, which involves a priori inferences\nand judgments pertaining to relations of ideas, cannot influence the\nwill, but only assist us in our pursuit of an end we already have\n(e.g., if mathematical calculations would facilitate our achievement\nof our end). Probable (or causal) reasoning helps us discover cause\nand effect relations among objects of experience conducive to the\nrealization of pre-selected ends, but such information about cause and\neffect can never motivate action on its own: “It can never in\nthe least concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and such\nothers effects, if both causes and effects be indifferent to us”\n(T 2.3.3.3). In order to be motivated to act, we must first anticipate\npleasure or pain from something. That anticipated pleasure or pain\ngives rise to feelings of desire or aversion for the object in\nquestion. Probable reasoning allows us to discern the causes of this\nobject; our positive or negative feelings about the object then spread\nto the causes of it; and we are then motivated to pursue or to avoid\nthem. Simply believing that one thing causes another will not motivate\naction (T 2.3.3.2). \nA second argument, which builds on the first, aims to show that reason\n“can never oppose passion in the direction of the will” (T\n2.3.3.1). The only thing that can oppose an impulse to action\ngenerated by one passion is a contrary impulse. Reason, then, could\ncounteract an impulse to action generated by a passion if and only if\nreason could itself generate a contrary impulse. But from the first\nargument, we know that that reason cannot generate such an impulse.\n“Thus it appears, that the principle, which opposes any passion,\ncannot be the same with reason, and is only called so in an improper\nsense” (T 2.3.3.4). Hume goes on to say that whatever we feel in\nus running contrary to an impulse to act that we mistake for reason\nmust be something else, such as a calm passion (e.g., a general\nappetite for the good, benevolence, or aversion to evil; T\n2.3.3.8). \nThe third argument claims that a passion is an “original\nexistence”, not an idea, or a mental copy of another object.\nContradiction to truth and reason “consists in the disagreement\nof ideas, consider’d as copies, with those objects, which they\nrepresent” (T 2.3.3.5). So a passion cannot be contrary to truth\nand reason. Passions cannot, strictly speaking, be evaluated as\nreasonable or unreasonable, despite our practice of calling passions\nunreasonable or irrational when they depend in some way on poor\nreasoning or false beliefs. Later in the Treatise, Hume\nextends this argument to volitions and actions as well (T 3.1.1.9); we\nmight view Kant’s conflict in conception and contradiction in\nwill tests of the formula of universal law to constitute refutations\nof the latter argument (G 4:421–24; see Guyer 2008: ch. 5). \nThese arguments convey the main components of Hume’s view of\nmotivation: passion plays the dominant role in motivating action,\nreason a merely subsidiary role; reason cannot control or resist\npassion’s motivational influence; and one cannot use the\nstandards of reason to praise or criticize passions. Hume draws some\nfurther important, anti-rationalist moral conclusions from this line\nof thought. One obvious implication is that reason cannot be the\nmotive to moral action; if reason cannot motivate any sort of action,\nit cannot motivate moral action. A second further conclusion is that\nmorality (fundamental moral principles) cannot be grounded in reason;\nthis one follows both from his views about the “inertness”\nof reason generally, and from his assumption that morality is capable\nof motivating people:  \nMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of\nitself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality,\ntherefore, are not conclusions of reason. (T 3.1.1.6) \nKant never directly addresses Hume’s arguments, but he clearly\nrejects the idea that reason is motivationally “impotent”\nor enslaved to the passions. It is a central feature of his moral\nphilosophy that pure reason can be “practical”—that\nreason can “of itself, independently of anything empirical,\ndetermine the will” (CPrR 5: 42). He says of right actions that\nthey “need no recommendation” from emotion or personal\ninclination. Such actions  \npresent the will that practices them as the object of an immediate\nrespect, and nothing but reason is required to impose them\nupon the will. (G 4:435)  \nMoreover, in the first section of the Groundwork, Kant\nrepeatedly emphasizes the special form of “moral worth”\nthat attaches to right actions that are performed simply because they\nare right—i.e., actions motivated from “from duty”\nor “from respect for the law” (G 4:396–401; see\nTimmermann 2009a). \nYet Kant also holds that emotion or feeling is involved somehow in\npure reason’s motivational influence on finite rational beings\n(such as humans). In the Groundwork, he focuses on the\nfeeling of “respect” or reverence for the moral law. Early\nin the Groundwork, Kant describes respect in a manner that\nmakes it sound like a felt aspect of the law itself:  \nan action from duty is to put aside entirely the influence of\ninclination, and with it every object of the will; hence there is left\nfor the will nothing that could determine it the except objectively\nthe law and subjectively pure respect for this\npractical law. (G 4:400)  \nBut his subsequent development of respect makes it sound more like a\nseparate feeling, though one arising from reason: \nBut although respect is a feeling, it is not one received by means of\ninfluence; it is, instead, a feeling self-wrought by a\nrational concept and therefore specifically different from all\nfeelings of the first kind, which can be referred to inclination or\nfear. What I cognize immediately as a law for me, I cognize with\nrespect, which signifies merely consciousness of the subordination of\nmy will to a law without the mediation of other influences on any\nsense. Immediate determination of the will by means of the law and the\nconsciousness of this is called respect, so that this is\nregarded as the effect of the law on the subject, and not as\nthe cause of the law. (G 4:401 n; also see 460) \nDespite his emphasis on the motivational efficacy of pure reason,\nKant’s discussion of respect makes clear that feeling must be\nsomehow involved in human moral motivation (see Guyer 2008: ch. 5; and\nGuyer 2010). In the Groundwork, Kant states:  \nIn order for a sensibly affected rational being to will that for which\nreason alone prescribes the ‘ought,’ it is admittedly\nrequired that his reason have the capacity to induce a feeling of\npleasure or of delight in the fulfillment of duty, and thus there\nis required a causality of reason to determine sensibility in\nconformity with its principles. (G 4:460)  \nEven though we cannot know (or “make intelligible a\npriori”) how a thought or judgment about the morality of an\naction “can itself produce a sensation of pleasure or\npain”, Kant thinks that this somehow does happen; it must, if\nmoral considerations are to be motivating in beings like us. The\nphenomenology of respect is unusual, as it involves both pain and\npleasure (or something like it). There is the humiliation an agent\nfeels when the moral law strikes down her self-conceit; but respect\nalso feels invigorating and ennobling, since the moral law comes from\nthe agent’s own reason and represents her higher self and\nvocation (CPrR 5:73). However one interprets the phenomenology,\nrespect seems to function as an intermediary between reason and the\nwill. This raises questions about the consistency of Kant’s\nview, since he argues repeatedly that pure reason can, and should,\ndetermine the will “immediately”. For this and other\nreasons, scholars are divided on how to interpret Kant’s\ntreatment of respect. According to an “intellectualist”\nline of interpretation, respect is the effect of pure\nreason’s motivational influence on the will. In other words, we\ngrasp the law by means of reason, are moved to act accordingly, and\nfeel respect as a result of being so moved. According to an\n“affectivist” approach, however, respect is the proximate\ncause of reason’s influence on the will. In other\nwords, our rational grasp of the law’s demand produces a feeling\nof respect or reverence, which then moves the will (or higher faculty\nof desire). Vexingly, both interpretations have a strong textual basis\nand both have been defended with great skill and insight. (For an\nexcellent discussion of the issues, see Frierson 2014: ch. 4.) \nIn the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant also describes the\nmotivational role played by additional feelings. He lists moral\nfeeling, conscience, love of human beings, and respect (for oneself)\nas special kinds of feelings of which we are made aware only though\nconsciousness of the moral law (MM 6:399). Kant describes these as\n“moral endowments” that “lie at the basis of\nmorality” or the “subjective conditions of\nreceptivity to the concept of duty” (MM 6:399). Since our\ncompliance with duty presupposes our having these feelings, there is\nno duty for us to have them. However, because of their\nindispensibility to human morality, there is a duty to cultivate them.\nAdditionally, Kant clearly sees moral value in some sensibly-grounded\n(“pathological”) feelings (MM 6:456–57, 458; also M\n29:626; NF 19:77 #6560). Speaking of sympathy, which is perhaps the\nbest example of this sort of feeling, Kant says,  \nit is… an indirect duty to cultivate the natural…\nfeelings in us, and to make use of them as so many means to sympathy\nbased on moral principles and the feeling appropriate to them. (MM\n6:457)  \nSympathy allows us better to understand others’ needs, helps us\nto communicate our concern for them, and can act as an additional\nincentive to facilitate our promotion of our happiness helping others.\nSuch sensibly-grounded feelings can work with rationally-grounded\nfeelings in order to motivate us to act morally. We may cultivate\nsympathetic feelings from respect for the law, and then find these\nfeelings prompting us to act in certain ways. In this context, where\nthe focus is on virtue, Kant sounds closer to Hume than he is often\ntaken to be. Indeed, according to one prominent interpretation,\ncareful consideration of this and other relevant material highlights\nat least a few “deep affinities” between Kant on Hume on\nmotivation and practical reason (Guyer 2008: 164). \nDespite the above similarities, Kant and Hume are clearly opposed on\nthe basic question of whether pure reason, to use Kant’s\nexpression, can be motivationally efficacious. Kant thinks it can,\nwhile Hume does not. However, one must interpret this opposition with\ncare. First, Kant’s account of respect makes clear that feeling\nor emotion is involved even when pure reason motivates action. The\n“affectivist” interpretation of respect, in particular,\nsuggests that Kant and Hume actually agree that reason cannot motivate\naction without the intervention of feeling. The crucial difference\nbetween them is that Kant believes pure reason capable of producing a\nmotivationally efficacious feeling (respect), while Hume believes\nnothing of the sort. The opposition between them is even starker if\nthe “intellectualist” interpretation is correct. Second,\nKant’s account of virtue makes it clear that feelings such as\nlove and sympathy often play an important moral role in the motivation\nof human action. Indeed, feelings appear to be indispensible for human\nbeings and should therefore be cultivated and strengthened through\ndeliberate practice. Third, one must keep track of the level at which\nthese two philosophers disagree. Consider, for example, the reason why\nHume would adamantly reject Kant’s attribution of a special form\nof “moral worth” to actions done “from duty”.\nAccording to Hume,  \nno action can be virtuous, or morally good, unless there be in\nhuman nature some motive to produce it, distinct from a sense of its\nmorality. (T 3.2.1.7)  \nTo avoid circularity, there must be a motive to virtuous action that\ndoes not itself refer to the moral goodness of the act (T 3.2.1.4).\nFor Hume, the only time one would have to rely on one’s sense of\nthe goodness of an act to motivate oneself to do it is when one is\ndeficient in the natural feelings that ordinarily prompt people to act\nmorally (e.g., natural affection, generosity, gratitude). The two\nphilosophers do not necessarily disagree here on the\nempirical question of what actually motivates people. Hume\nseems to countenance the possibility of being motivated directly by\nthe sense of an action’s moral goodness. Kant, in fact, seems\ncomparatively skeptical; he expresses doubt that there have ever been\nhuman actions motivated from duty alone (e.g., G 4:406–407).\nThey disagree sharply, however, on the normative question at\nissue. Kant believes that the most morally admirable actions are\nperformed “from duty” alone. These are the only actions\nthat have true “moral worth”. By contrast, Hume believes\nthat such actions indicate a character flaw. Indeed, if a person finds\nshe is moved to act only by the sense that the action is good, she may\nvery well reproach herself for a lack of generosity or gratitude, for\nexample, and consequently form a desire to change her character. \nHume and Kant both treat the concepts of virtue and vice as central to\nhuman morality. But they differ on the basic nature of virtue, and\nthey present different catalogues of particular virtues and vices.\nKant’s discussions reflect his consistent emphasis on freedom,\ndignity, rationality, and purity of motive. Hume’s reflect his\nemphasis on utility, pleasure, and the inherently social nature of the\nhuman mind. Correspondingly, the notion of internal struggle is\ncentral to Kant’s account, while Hume portrays the pursuit of\nvirtue in comparatively relaxed and genial terms. For this reason,\nHume seems far more comfortable with the bourgeois virtues integral to\nsuccessful participation in modern commercial and political society\n(cf. EPM 9.1.2). By contrast, Kant seems warier of society’s\ninfluence on the individual, more insistent on the need to resist the\npower of what Rousseau calls amour-propre. \nFor Hume, the concepts of virtue and vice apply primarily to character\ntraits or “mental qualities”, and secondarily to occurrent\nmotives and actions. According to Hume, a character trait is a virtue\nif, and only if, it “gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment\nof approbation” (EPM App. I.10). Vices, by contrast, are those\ntraits that generate a displeasing sentiment of disapproval.\nHume’s definition builds on his account of moral judgment, and\nit makes virtue dependent on the responses of a\n“judicious” spectator who contemplates things from a\ngeneral point of view. The trait of prudence, for example, is a virtue\nbecause it tends to be pleasing to such a spectator. As Hume\nputs it, the defining mark of a virtue is that it has the “power\nof producing love or pride” when surveyed from the general point\nof view (T 3.3.1.3). In other words, a trait is a virtue only insofar\nas it tends to provoke the moral sentiment of approval in a properly\nsituated spectator. If it did not tend to provoke this response, it\nwould not be a virtue. This marks a significant departure from\nAristotelian conceptions of virtue (Cohon 2008: 161). According to the\nlatter, a character trait’s goodness is a function of the role\nit plays in the agent’s own flourishing, which has nothing to do\nwith the responses of a spectator. Prudence, for example, is a virtue\nwhether or not it tends to provoke the pleasing sentiment of\napprobation in an outside observer, however “judicious”\nshe may be. \nHume discusses a capacious catalogue of particular virtues and vices.\nHis account in the Treatise is organized around the\ndistinction between “natural” and “artificial”\nvirtues, which is easily misunderstood. The question is not whether\nsome virtues are fake or phony and others are authentic. The question\nis whether some depend on social rules and conventions and others do\nnot. Organizing his catalogue by means of this distinction allows Hume\nto steer a middle path between those who see morality as entirely\nconventional (e.g., Bernard Mandeville) and those who believe it\nsprings directly from features of human nature that exist\nindependently of social convention (e.g., Francis Hutcheson).\nAccording to Hume, some virtues do depend on social convention but\nothers do not (Cohon 2008: 162–163). In both cases, he seeks to\nexplain why people tend to develop such traits and why they tend to be\npleasing to judicious spectators. Hume drops the artificial-natural\ndistinction from the second Enquiry, but his investigations\nthere are motivated by the same questions and the resulting view also\nsteers a middle course between Mandeville and Hutcheson. \nAccording to the Treatise, artificial virtues include\njustice, fidelity to promises, allegiance to government, and chastity.\nHume devotes much discussion to justice, which he treats as a\nparamount and paradigmatic artificial virtue. Hume understands justice\nprimarily as honesty with respect to property or conformity to\nconventions of property (T 3.2.2.28). Establishing a system of\nproperty allows us to avoid conflict and enjoy the possession and use\nof various goods, so the social value of conventions involving\nproperty seems obvious. Yet one reason that justice receives such\nattention from Hume is that it poses a problem about moral motivation\nand moral approval. Hume claims that there needs to be a natural\n(non-moral) motive for morally good actions, for otherwise they could\nonly be done because they are morally good; and that would be\ncircular, since our judgment of acts as morally good reflects our\napproval of the motives and traits that give rise to the acts in\nquestion (T 3.2.1.7, 3.2.1.17). But this position makes it hard to see\nhow justice can be a virtue; for it is hard to find the requisite\nnatural, nonmoral motive for it. Self-interest is the natural motive\nthat justifies our establishing rules regarding property (T 3.2.2.24);\nbut self-interest is neither always satisfied by just acts, nor\napproved in the way that traits we call virtues generally are (T\n3.2.1.9–10). Neither public nor private benevolence would do,\nsince neither could motivate all just actions (T 3.2.1.12). Hume\nhimself says that “a sympathy with public interest\nis the source of the moral approbation, which attends that\nvirtue” (T 3.2.2.24). But since sympathy with the public\ninterest itself seems neither nonmoral nor inherent in human nature,\nthis claim redescribes the problem rather than solves it. Hume must\nground sympathy for the public interest in more obviously natural\nsentiments, and explain its development from them (e.g., as\nself-interest, corrected or redirected through education or the\ncontrivances of politicians). Otherwise, Hume must abandon his claim\nthat all morally good actions—even those associated with\nartificial virtues—have non-moral, natural motives. (See\nGauthier 1979; Mackie 1980: ch. 5; and Darwall 1995:\n302–316.) \nAmong the natural virtues, Hume includes beneficence, prudence,\ntemperance, frugality, industry, assiduity, enterprise, dexterity,\ngenerosity, and humanity (T 3.3.1.24). In the second Enquiry,\nhe distinguishes among virtues useful to others, virtues useful to\noneself, virtues immediately agreeable to oneself, and virtues\nimmediately agreeable to others. Among qualities useful to others are\njustice, fidelity, honor, allegiance, chastity, along with the other\n“social virtues” of humanity, generosity, charity,\naffability, lenity, mercy, and moderation (EPM 5.2.44). Among\nqualities useful to ourselves are discretion, caution, enterprise,\nindustry, assiduity, frugality, economy, good sense, prudence,\ndiscernment (EPM 6.1.21). Among qualities contrary to our own\nwell-being are indolence, negligence, “want of order and\nmethod”, obstinacy, fickleness, rashness, and credulity (EPM\n6.1.1). Qualities immediately agreeable to oneself include\ncheerfulness, tranquility, benevolence, and delicacy of taste.\nQualities immediately agreeable to others include good manners,\npoliteness, wit, ingenuity, decency, cleanliness, and a graceful or\ngenteel manner. What holds all these varied traits together as virtues\nis their evoking the sentiment of approval in spectators, itself\ngrounded in sympathy. \nLike Hume, Kant takes virtue to be central to human morality. But his\nbasic conception of virtue differs from Hume’s, as does his\ncatalogue of particular virtues and vices. According to Kant, virtue\nis the form in which a being with an imperfect or non-holy will\nexpresses her supreme commitment to morality. Virtue is such a\nbeing’s continually cultivated capacity to master her\ninclinations so as to fulfill her duties; a capacity whose cultivation\nand exercise is motivated by respect for the moral law (Denis 2006;\nBaxley 2010). Several related claims are integral to Kant’s\nview. First, virtue is a general disposition to do one’s duty\nout of respect for the moral law (CPrR 5:128, 160; C 27:300). Second,\nvirtue is a kind of strength. More specifically, virtue is “a\nmoral strength of the will” (MM 6:405) or “moral strength\nin adherence to one’s duty” (Ant 7:147). Third, virtue\npresupposes opposition and entails internal struggle. Kant often seems\nto identify our inclinations as the primary opponents of morality (G:\n4:405; V 27:450, 492; C 27:450). His considered view, however, is that\ninclinations are not the source of the problem. Virtue’s primary\nopponent is “radical evil in human nature”—a\npropensity to adopt maxims that prioritize self-love (and inclinations\ngenerally) over the moral law (Rel 6:29, 35–37, 57 n., 58). It\nis because of radical evil that virtue implies struggle and demands\nstrength. The fundamental task of the virtuous person is to achieve\nthe proper ordering of her incentives, giving the moral law undisputed\npriority over self-love. Finally, virtue is moral self-constraint\n“based on inner freedom” (MM 6:408), which is the capacity\nto act on the autonomously chosen principles of morality, even in the\nface of temptation (MM 6:394, 405). Virtue both expresses and promotes\ninner freedom. The greater one’s moral self-constraint, the more\none acts based on reason, and the less one acts based on inclination\nor impulse (MM 6:382 n). \nKant’s catalogue of virtues and vices is organized by his system\nof duties. These duties are grounded in the moral law, the supreme\nprinciple of morality, which impresses itself on imperfect, finite\nrational beings like us as a categorical imperative. Whatever duties\nwe have must ultimately derive from this supreme moral principle. But\nin the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant’s discussion of\nparticular duties of virtue is based more directly on what he calls\nthe “supreme principle of the doctrine of virtue”. This\nprinciple enjoins us to “act in accordance with a maxim of\nends that it can be a universal law for everyone to\nhave” (MM 6:395). As Kant explains,  \nIn accordance with this principle a human being is an end for himself\nas well as for others, and it is not enough that he is not authorized\nto use either himself or others merely as a means (since he could then\nstill be indifferent to them); it is in itself his duty to make the\nhuman being as such his end. (MM 6:395)  \nDuties of virtue have fundamentally to do with the ends, principles,\nand attitudes of agents; they aim to protect each agent’s inner\nfreedom; they can be compelled only by the agent herself. It is\nbecause duties of virtue alone are subject only to internal compulsion\nthat Kant calls them “directly ethical duties”. Among\nthese duties are the perfect duties to oneself to avoid vices of\nsuicide, self-mutilation, gluttony, drunkenness, sexual\nself-degradation (duties to oneself as an animal and moral being),\nlying, avarice, and servility (duties to oneself as a moral being\nonly); the imperfect duties to oneself concerning the promotion of the\nobligatory end of one’s own natural and moral perfection, along\nwith duties to foster self-knowledge, compassion for animals, and\nappreciation of the beautiful in nature; the perfect duties to others\nto avoid the vices of arrogance, defamation, and ridicule (duties of\nrespect), and the imperfect duties to promote the end of others\nhappiness by means of beneficence, sympathy, and gratitude, as well as\nby avoiding malice, envy, and ingratitude (duties of love and vices\nopposed to them). Kant does not claim to derive these duties from the\ncategorical imperative or the supreme principle of virtue alone.\nRather, in moving from general principles of morality to moral duties,\nhe draws on a variety of considerations regarding human nature and\nother aspects of the natural world. \nHume and Kant share a number of influences, so we should not be\nsurprised to see areas of overlap. First, like most eighteenth century\nphilosophers, both regard the pursuit of virtue as central to human\nmorality. Second, Kant shares Hume’s rejection of both\nHobbes’s psychological egoism and Hutcheson’s reduction of\nall virtues to the sentiment of benevolence. Third, Hume and Kant both\naccept of versions of Grotius’s distinction between perfect and\nimperfect duties, though they do not incorporate this distinction into\ntheir theories in the same way (see Schneewind 1990). Fourth, their\nrespective conceptions of virtue are secular by historical standards.\nNeither recognizes duties to God, for example, and neither counts\npiety or hope among the virtues. Kant also seems to agree with, and\nperhaps to have been influenced by, much of what Hume says about the\n“monkish virtues”. He follows Hume in rejecting fasting,\nself-flagellation, mortification of the flesh and other forms of\nphysical self-chastisement and self-abasement as false virtues. Kant\ncondemns such attempts at  \nweakening and removing all the body’s sensuality, to renounce\neverything that its sensuous enjoyment promotes, so that thereby the\nanimal nature of the body would be suppressed  \nas contrary to proper care for the body; such care requires\ndiscipline, but also  \ninvolves trying to promote its vigor, activity, strength, and courage.\n(C 27:379–80) \nYet there are striking and important differences between their views.\nHume defines virtue in terms of the moral sentiments of a properly\nsituated judicious spectator, and his definition makes virtue and vice\ndependent on such responses. Kant, by contrast, defines virtue in\nterms of duty, obligation, and law. Virtue is thought of as moral\nstrength, which is measured by an agent’s ability to defeat\nthose inclinations that oppose the demands of the moral law (MM\n6:405–407). Hume’s theory of virtue has a place for duty\nand law, but these are not the fundamental concepts in terms of which\neverything else must be explained or justified. Moreover, Hume\ncertainly recognizes individual virtues such as strength of mind,\nfortitude, and courage; but they are not central to his view of virtue\nas such, and their status as virtues depends on the moral sentiments\nof a judicious spectator, as well as the exigencies and social\nconventions of a particular age (EPM “A\nDialogue”.40)—both of which Kant takes to be irrelevant.\nVirtue for Kant is defined in terms of the law, and neither the\nlaw’s normative status nor its psychological weight rests on\nmoral sentiments or social convention. \nA few additional differences are worth noting. First, both\nphilosophers recognize and discuss a plurality of virtues and vices.\nBut, unlike Hume, Kant insists on the unitary nature of virtue:\n“in its Idea (objectively) there is only one virtue (as\nmoral strength of one’s maxims)” (MM 6:447; cf. MM 6:395\nand 406). Second, Hume casts a much wider net with regard to the\nqualities that count as virtues. The concepts of virtue and vice can\napply to things outside our control, such as traits and motives that\nspring involuntarily from our basic temperament. Kant, by contrast,\nrestricts the application of these concepts to traits, behaviors, and\nattitudes that are voluntarily adopted and cultivated as a matter of\nprinciple. For Kant each virtue and each vice has its own maxim (MM\n6:404). This would be true even of wit or good memory, for example.\nWit and good memory are certainly things that an agent might cultivate\nfor the sake of her natural perfection. But for these traits to be\nconsidered Kantian virtues would require at least an agent’s\nmorally grounded interest in and cultivation of them. But for Hume the\nagent’s reasons and her degree of voluntary control are\nirrelevant. Wit, good memory, and other “natural\nabilities” are virtues because of their power to please a\nproperly situated spectator, even if they spring directly from a\nnatural temperament over which the agent has no control (T\n3.3.4.1–5). A third important contrast concerns justice. Justice\nis an immensely significant virtue for Hume, but is not treated by\nKant as a virtue at all. For Kant, justice has primarily to do with\none’s external treatment of others. As long as one does not\nhinder their freedom in a way that violates universal law or\nlegitimate positive law, one complies with the demands of justice.\nOne’s motive or attitude is irrelevant from the standpoint of\njustice. It is a matter not of justice itself, but of ethics, if one\nrespects the rights of others not from fear of punishment but from\nrespect for persons or law. The moral worth adhering to acting rightly\nout of respect for right is not part of justice, but of ethics; it is\na matter of self-constraint or virtue. Hume’s treatment of\njustice reflects his distinction between artificial and natural\nvirtues, but Kant would reject this distinction altogether. None of\nthe virtues is either “artificial” or\n“natural” in Hume’s sense since none of them depends\non social convention and none of them springs directly from human\nnature. Finally, their conceptions of moral vice are quite different.\nFor Hume a vice is a mental quality that provokes disapproval from a\njudicious spectator. A person’s vices do not necessarily say\nanything about the quality of her will as a whole or her fundamental\nattitude toward the demands of morality. But Kant holds that vice is a\npropensity to act contrary to the moral law (Rel 6:37), and it implies\na principled “contempt for moral laws” (C\n27:463). As he puts it, “it is when an intentional transgression\nhas become a principle that it is properly called a\nvice” (MM 6:390). \nHume and Kant both believe that freedom is essential to morality.\nMoreover, both believe that a philosophical theory and vindication of\nhuman morality requires reconciling freedom with universal causal\nnecessity (determinism). However, they offer different conceptions of\nfreedom, different ways of reconciling it with necessity, and\ndifferent ways of understanding why this reconciliation matters for\nmorality. Scholars agree that Hume is a “compatibilist”,\nbut there is no consensus on the correct label for Kant’s\nposition. \nHume defends compatibilism in section eight of Enquiry concerning\nHuman Understanding and Book Two of the Treatise\n(2.3.1–2). In the Treatise, Hume distinguishes between\ntwo conceptions of freedom or liberty: “liberty of\nindifference” and “liberty of spontaneity”.\nAccording to the idea of indifference, liberty implies “a\nnegation of necessity and causes” (T 2.3.2.1). For illustration,\nconsider the Anglican bishop John Bramhall’s claim that genuine\nliberty is “a liberty from necessity, or rather from\nnecessitation, that is, a universal immunity from all inevitability\nand determination” (1645 [1999: 1]). On this view, a person is\nfree when, and only when, her action is not necessitated by\nany antecedent causes. Hume rejects this idea as\nunintelligible (T 2.3.1.18) and destructive to morality and religion\n(T 2.3.2.5). By contrast, he characterizes spontaneity as that idea of\nliberty “which is oppos’d to violence” (T 2.3.2.1).\nSo the liberty of spontaneity is freedom from violence, but not\nfreedom from necessity per se. “Violence” here\nrefers to various forms of unwanted interference with the execution of\none’s will, as when a person is forced to sign a document or\nlocked in a cell from which she wants to escape. These are cases where\nwe lack the liberty of spontaneity. But a person has such liberty\nwhenever she is able to do what she wants to do. In such cases, her\nactions are causally necessitated, just like any other event in\nnature; but they are caused by motives that spring from her own\ncharacter. According to Hume, this is the form of liberty at issue in\nreligion, morality, law, and common life. Hence, spontaneity is the\nonly form of liberty “which it concerns us to preserve” (T\n2.3.2.1). \nThe liberty of spontaneity, as just described, is perfectly compatible\nwith causal necessity. There are two main reasons people often believe\notherwise. First, we tend to conflate the two ideas of liberty. In\ncases where we enjoy the liberty of spontaneity, our experience\nsuggests that we also enjoy something more. We recognize, of course,\nthat “we were influenc’d by particular views and\nmotives”, yet we find it difficult to “perswade ourselves\nwe govern’d by necessity, and that ’twas utterly\nimpossible for us to have acted otherwise” (T 2.3.2.1). This is\nbecause “[w]e feel that our actions are subject to our will on\nmost occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to\nnothing” (T 2.3.2.2). Yet this is a mistake explained by the\nblind spots of introspection. An outside observer, whether a friend or\na scientist,  \ncan commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and\neven where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he\nperfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and\ntemper. (T 2.3.2.2)  \nThe second source of resistance to compatibilism stems from confusion\nabout necessity. People are prone to think that necessity rules out\nliberty because they conflate necessity with compulsion or force. They\nbelieve that when A causes B, A compels or forces B. Hume holds that\nthis is a mistake, however. Causal necessity is nothing more than the\n“constant conjunction” of similar objects and a customary\ninference of the mind from the one to the other (EHU 8.1.5). For\nexample, experience shows that the vibration of a particular string is\nconstantly conjoined with a particular sound. As a result, the mind\ndevelops the habit of immediately inferring the sound from the\nvibration (EHU 7.2.29). We believe that the sound is causally\nnecessitated by the vibration, but the necessity is a product of the\nimagination, which associates the idea of the sound with the\nperception of the vibration. This feeling that there is a\nnecessary connection between them is the whole of the matter (EHU\n7.2.28). So defined, causal necessity no longer poses an obvious\nthreat to liberty. It makes sense to follow Bramhall’s\ndefinition of liberty as “liberty from necessity” if one\nthinks that necessitation involves force or compulsion. But causes do\nnot force or compel their effects. If one can accept this point, then\na definition like Bramhall’s seems less tempting, and necessity\nper se no longer poses a threat to liberty. The only real\nthreat is necessitation by external forces, as when a person is forced\nto do something she does not want to do. \nBroadly speaking, the scholarship offers two ways of interpreting\nHume’s compatibilism. According to the most common approach,\nHume’s arguments concern the logic of the concepts at issue. On\nthis reading, Hume analyzes the concepts of liberty and necessity in\norder to show that, properly understood, they do not conflict. We can\nbe rationally justified in holding a person responsible for her action\neven though all human actions are caused. The only question is whether\nshe, rather than some other person or external force, is the\ncause of her action. According to Paul Russell’s naturalist\napproach, however, Hume’s view is not primarily a piece of a\npriori reasoning about the logic of our concepts or the rational\njustification of attributions of moral responsibility. Above all it is\nan empirical explanation for why we sometimes feel that people are\nresponsible for their conduct. Hume’s concern is with the\ncognitive processes that cause such attributions (Russell 1995: ch.\n4). He starts with the\noccasions in common life when we hold people responsible for their\nbehavior, and then asks, what happens in the mind on such occasions?\nOn the standard reading, Hume’s treatment of liberty is a fairly\nself-contained set of compatibilist arguments, easily detached from\nhis larger project. On the naturalist reading, it is deeply connected\nto his theory of the passions and moral judgment, which makes it an\nintegral part of his “science of man”. \nHume claims that liberty, understood properly, is “essential to\nmorality” (EHU 8.31). The above interpretations provide two\ndifferent explanations for why this is the case. The standard approach\nsays that Hume’s compatibilism is about the logic of our\nconcepts and the justification of our judgments. Our judgments about\nresponsibility entail judgments about the causal antecedents of\naction, and such judgments are consistent with determinism. On this\nview, the liberty of spontaneity is essential to morality because\nattributions of responsibility, which permeate morality (as well as\nlaw and religion), are unjust and unreasonable without it. According\nto the naturalist approach, liberty is essential for a different\nreason. The naturalist reading emphasizes that, on Hume’s view,\nattributions of responsibility are made via feelings of\napproval and disapproval, not judgments (T 2.3.2.6; Russell 1995:\n60–4). They are, in\nhis terminology, impressions or sentiments rather than ideas. These\nsentiments are partially caused by beliefs about the source of the\nbehavior to which we are responding. We would not feel approval or\ndisapproval unless we had been led to think of the person as the cause\nof the action. If we believed that her action was either compelled or\nuncaused, we would neither approve nor disapprove of her. Our\nresponses or thoughts would be about something else. Hume’s\nclaim, on the naturalist reading, is that in approving or disapproving\nof the agent—in feeling gratitude or resentment, for\nexample—we hold her responsible, and in holding her responsible\nwe believe that her conduct is free. Hume does not argue that the\nlatter justifies attributions of responsibility. His claim is that it\ncausally contributes to such attributions. They are made by means of\nfeelings of approval and disapproval, which are are a core feature of\nhuman morality as we know it. Therefore, the idea of liberty, properly\nreconciled with necessity, is essential to morality.  Like Hume, Kant seeks to reconcile freedom with a commitment to\ncausal determinism. Yet the two philosophers operate with different\nconceptions of causal necessity and very different ideas about the\nnature of freedom. For present purposes, it is important to focus on\nthe main difference between their conceptions of freedom. Hume\nconcentrates on the liberty of spontaneity, the only idea of freedom\n“which it concerns us to preserve”. His treatment looks\ndownstream from the will to its execution in action. A person has\nliberty when her action is caused by her will, which Hume equates with\nan occurrent motive or desire (T 2.3.1.2). The question of what\nultimately moves the will is irrelevant. Such causes are found in the\nperson’s character and circumstances, and they determine her\nwill with the same necessity that determines everything else in\nnature. Kant, by contrast, looks upstream to what determines the will:\n“It is here a question only of the determination of the will and\nof the determining ground of its maxims as a free will, not of its\nresult” in bodily action (CPrR 5:45). One way of putting it is\nto say that Hume’s account concerns the freedom of action, while\nKant’s concerns freedom of the will. Both are concerned with the\nfreedom of the person or agent, but Kant thinks the person is not\ntruly free unless her will is free. This is the first point about the\nmain difference between Kant and Hume. \nThe second point is that Kant, unlike Hume, believes that the will is\nnot free unless it can be determined by pure reason. This is why he\nrepeatedly insists that the main question concerning freedom is\nwhether pure reason “can be an immediate determining ground of\nthe will, that is, of the causality of a rational being with respect\nto the reality of objects” (CPrR 5:44–45). Furthermore,\nKant holds that this is a question of whether the will can be\ndetermined “independently of anything empirical” (CPrR\n5:42). For when pure reason determines the will, the latter’s\n“ground” must be found in “the intelligible order of\nthings” rather than in empirical order (CPrR 5:49). This is why\nKant thinks that “the concept of a being that has free\nwill” involves the concept of a “noumenal” cause\n(CPrR 5:55). Note that this is not obviously equivalent to what Hume\ncalls the liberty of indifference, which implies a complete absence of\ncauses or necessitation. Free will, on Kant’s view, is not quite\nwhat Bramhall calls “liberty from necessitation”. On the\ncontrary, Kant seems to think that the will is free if, and only if,\nit is necessitated. But it must be necessitated by the right\nsort of thing and in the right way: namely, by pure reason rather than\nby an antecedent event whose causal impact on the will could be\ndescribed by an empirical law. That is, the will is free if and only\nif can be determined by pure reason, which lies outside the realm\ngoverned by empirical laws. \nThis conception of freedom has profound implications for the task of\nreconciling freedom with causal determinism. Kant maintains that all\nevents, including human actions, are causally determined by antecedent\nevents in accordance with empirical laws. But he also seeks to show\nthat this does not rule out free will (A536–537/B564-565). On\nthe contrary, one and the same event can be both “a mere effect\nof nature” but also an “effect of freedom”\n(A543/B571). Kant demonstrates this possibility by distinguishing\nbetween two different “worlds” and arguing that we belong\nto both. On the one hand, we belong to the “phenomenal”\nworld, where all our actions can be explained in terms of antecedent\nevents (whether physical or psychological). On the other hand,\nconsidered as a “thing in itself”, each of us belongs to\nthe “noumenal” world, which is not subject to “the\ntemporal order in accord with empirical laws” (A534/B562). We\ncannot know whether we actually belong to the noumenal world,\nbut Kant’s theoretical philosophy secures room for this\npossibility, and his moral philosophy tries to show that when we\nbecome aware of morality’s categorical demands, we think of\nourselves as members of this noumenal or “intelligible\nworld” (G 4:457-58). With this line of thought, Kant seeks to\nreconcile freedom and natural necessity by means of his transcendental\nidealism. Indeed, the question of whether natural necessity rules out\nfreedom is a “transcendental problem” and only\ntranscendental philosophy can solve it (A535/B563, A557/B585). The\nappeal to transcendental idealism is controversial, of course. Some\nscholars of Kant’s ethics understand him to be making a\nmetaphysical (or ontological) claim when he distinguishes between\nnoumenal and phenomenal worlds (e.g. McCarty 2009). Others understand\nKant to be distinguishing between only different standpoints we take,\nidentifying the noumenal world with the practical standpoint that we\ntake when we think of ourselves as autonomous, responsible beings, and\nthe phenomenal world with the theoretical standpoint we take when we\nthink of ourselves as part of the natural, deterministic, empirical\nworld (see Beck 1960: 191–94; Korsgaard 1996a, esp. chs.\n6–7). There are concerns about both. Many find the notion of two\nworlds metaphysically cumbersome; but others question whether the two\nstandpoints approach is adequate for transcendental and practical\nfreedom. (See Irwin 1984, esp. 37–38; Allison 1990; Guyer 1992:\n103–107; and Wood 2005a: 99–100.) \nKant has a number of reasons for thinking that freedom is essential to\nmorality. First, freedom is necessary for moral responsibility. When\nwe hold a person responsible for blameworthy conduct, for example, we\n“impute” the ability to have refrained from such conduct\nand blame the person for her failure to exercise this ability\nproperly. The judgment of “blame is grounded on the law of\nreason, which regards reason as a cause that… could have and\nought to have determined the conduct of the person to be other than it\nis” (A555/B583). Second, Kant holds that “what is\nessential to any moral worth of actions is that the moral law\ndetermine the will immediately” (CPrR 5:71). If a\nperson’s will were necessitated by her circumstances and\nempirical character, as Hume maintains, it would be impossible to\nrespond properly to the moral law, which demands a kind of purity of\nthought and motive that Hume would not countenance. Third, freedom is\nessential to morality in that freedom is the ground of a special\nstatus or “dignity” that morality commands us to respect\nin ourselves and others. One important but unorthodox line of\ninterpretation suggests a fourth reason for thinking that freedom is\nessential to morality. According to this view, Kant holds (in at least\nsome places) that freedom is our most fundamental value, the source\nfrom which all other moral value derives. This is “the real\nbedrock of Kant’s moral thought” (Guyer 2000: 203). On\nthis view, in fact, we are commanded to obey the moral law because it\n“is the necessary means for the realization of human\nfreedom” (Guyer 2016: 38). \nWhen comparing Hume and Kant, it is a mistake to ask simply which\nphilosopher has the best account of freedom or does the best job of\nreconciling freedom and necessity. They disagree about both causal\nnecessity and the question of which idea of freedom “it concerns\nus to preserve”. As a result, they focus on somewhat different\ntopics. Hume concentrates on what happens downstream from the will,\nthat is, on how motives determine action. But Kant’s attention\nis focused on what happens upstream—on the question of what\ndetermines the will. It seems fair to say that from Kant’s\nperspective, Hume’s notion of liberty is thin gruel, no better\nthan “the freedom of a turnspit” (CPrR 5:97) or the\nfreedom exhibited by a self-moving clock (CPrR 5:96). It also seems\nfair to say that from Hume’s perspective, Kant’s notion of\nfree will looks, at best, like a misguided fiction. One important\nquestion is whether morality requires the sort of freedom Kant has in\nmind. Hume would deny that it does, but this is partly because his\nview of morality itself is so different from Kant’s. The issue\nhere is not just about free will. It is about which conception of\nmorality is most plausible. If Kant has convincing grounds for\ninsisting on the unique nature of moral obligation or judgments of\n“moral worth”, this puts some pressure on Hume to take\nKant’s notion of free will more seriously. Another important\nquestion is how to interpret Kant’s actual position, which is\nthe subject of controversy. Standard textbooks classify Kant as a\nlibertarian (incompatibilist) about free will, but those who study\nKant most intensively often disagree about the nature of his view.\nSome argue that Kant offers a form of incompatibilism (e.g., Pereboom\n2006; Allison 1990; Watkins 2005), while others maintain that he is some sort of\ncompatibilist, however unorthodox (e.g., Bennett 1984; Hudson 1994).\nAccording to one very influential interpretation, Kant endorses\n“not only the compatibility of freedom and determinism, but also\nthe compatibility of compatibilism and incompatibilism” (Wood\n1984: 74). These scholarly debates bear on the question of how\nKant’s view compares to Hume’s, as does the question of\nwhether the naturalist or traditional interpretation best captures\nHume’s own position. Finally, when comparing Kant and Hume on\nthe question of freedom, one must recognize that there is a modest and\nskeptical side to Kant’s view that Hume would applaud. For Kant,\nfree will is an “inscrutable faculty” (CPrR 5:47), whose\noperations lie beyond the reach of human cognition. It is impossible\nto know whether we actually have free will (CPrR 5:72; G\n4:459). Indeed, Kant’s significant debt to Hume is evident in\nhis claim that “all human insight is at an end as soon as we\nhave arrived at basic powers or basic faculties” (CPrR\n5:46). \nReflections on religion and concern with religious themes can be found\nin the majority of Hume’s and Kant’s major works. Their\ntreatments of the subject differ significantly, but they have a few\nimportant things in common, especially on the question of how religion\nrelates to morality. Above all, both philosophers advocate a\nsecularized approach to moral philosophy. That is, both argue for the\nindependence of morality from religion and the importance of keeping\nthe two distinct. They both express deep concern about the corrupting\ninfluence of false religion, including “enthusiasm” and\n“superstition”. And they both seek to undermine a good\ndeal of Christian theology, including traditional arguments for the\nexistence of God. There are also important areas of disagreement,\nhowever. Generally speaking, Hume is far more alert to\nreligion’s potential costs, such as intolerance, violence, and\ndistraction from whatever happiness is available in this life. Kant,\nby contrast, seems far more attuned to the benefits of religion,\nespecially its attempts to address the perhaps unavoidable need for\nultimate answers or consolation in the face of death and\nsuffering.  On Hume’s view, the foundation of morality has nothing to do\nwith God. This is evident from his distinctive version of\nsentimentalism. He argues that morality, much like our aesthetic\nresponses to beauty, is “founded entirely on the peculiar fabric\nand constitution of the human species” (EPM 1.3). This claim is\nmade in the context of arguing against a form of moral rationalism\nthat locates the foundation of morality in immutable truths\ndiscoverable by reason (Schneewind 2010). Against rationalists like\nSamuel Clarke, Hume claims that morality is a distinctly and entirely\nhuman phenomenon; there are no grounds for believing that human beings\nexist in any kind of moral community with God or that God is\nanswerable to the moral norms that bind us (Schneewind 2010). For\npresent purposes, there are two additional points to\nappreciate. First, Hume’s claim entails a rejection of the idea\nthat moral distinctions between good and evil are instituted by divine\ncommand, as argued by voluntarists such as Pufendorf, Luther, or\nCalvin. Second, Hume’s version of the above claim differs from\nthe version found in Hutcheson. On Hutcheson’s view, human\nnature is essentially good and its goodness reflects the wisdom and\nbenevolence of God. When we behave virtuously, we further the purposes\nfor which we were created. Hume, by contrast, rejects\nHutcheson’s equation of the natural with the good (T 3.1.2.10),\nand he rejects his predecessor’s underlying teleology (Gill\n2006: 194–208). \nHume frequently draws attention to the moral and political costs of\nreligion. He never argues that religion is inherently destructive, but\nhe consistently claims that it tends to distort and corrupt morality.\nWere it not for religion’s influence, Hume claims, we would\nnever approve of qualities such as “celibacy, fasting, penance,\nmortification, self-denial, humility, silence, solitude, and the whole\ntrain of monkish virtues” (EPM 9.1.3). The “delusive\nglosses of superstition and false religion” can cause us to\napprove of such qualities despite the fact that they are neither\nuseful nor agreeable (EPM 9.1.3). Similarly, Hume emphasizes the\ndifference between moral and religious sources of motivation. When a\nperson pays a debt or restores a loan, for example,  \nhis divinity is nowise beholden to him; because these acts of justice\nare what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed,\nwere there no god in the universe. But if he fast a day, or give\nhimself a sound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion,\nto the service of God. No other motive could engage him to such\nausterities. (NHR 14.6)  \nHume often blames these distortions of morality on particular\nforms of Christianity, such as Catholicism and sectarian\noffshoots of Calvinism and Lutheranism. But in some places Hume comes\nclose to faulting any religion that represents\nGod as “infinitely superior to mankind” (NHR 10.2),\narguing that, “[t]he more tremendous the divinity is\nrepresented, the more tame and submissive do men become to his\nministers” (NHR 14.8). He clearly believes that monotheistic\nreligions tend to focus human attention on the one God rather than on\nthe enjoyment of life on earth. Monotheism also tends to promote\nintolerance, factionalism, and even violence. \nLike Hume, Kant holds that the foundation of morality is independent\nof religion. The main difference between them is that Hume locates\nthat foundation in human nature, while Kant —depending on the\ninterpretation—locates it in the structure of practical reason,\nthe nature of rational beings, or the supreme value of freedom. On\nKant’s view, morality is not only independent of religion; it is\nalso more fundamental. One way that he gives priority to morality is\nby arguing that belief in God follows from a moral commitment, and\ndenying that recognition of the moral law follows from or must be\ngrounded in recognition of God’s authority. A second way in\nwhich Kant treats morality as fundamental is by denying that we have\nany duties to God. All that God commands us to do is what morality\nrequires: our duties to ourselves and others. A third point is that\nKant insists that children not be taught about religion until they are\nfamiliar with basic moral concepts and principles; otherwise, they may\nthink, for example, that the reason one should act rightly is to hope\nfor God’s favor and to avoid God’s punishment. He argues\nthat Christianity is superior to other ecclesiastical faiths because\nof the centrality of ethics within it from its inception (Rel 6:167).\nBut all ecclesiastical faiths are liable to corruption, and none is\nthe ideal form for religion to take. Ideally, we will dispense with\ndistinct ecclesiastical faiths, along with their revealed texts and\ndoctrinal statutes and observances, in favor of a universal, pure\nreligion of reason, dedicated to morality. \nWhile Kant holds that morality’s foundation is independent of\nreligion, the two are more closely connected for him than they are for\nHume. Compared with Hume, Kant is far less antagonistic to religion,\nand he consistently tries to preserve a place for religious belief\nwithin the strictures of his moral philosophy. Indeed, this is an\nimportant aspect of his approach to morality. Kant’s\n“moral theism” is one of his most significant\ncontributions to the philosophy of religion and the question of\nreligion’s relation to morality. Moral theism is belief in God\nfounded on morality. By belief (or faith) [Glaube], Kant\nmeans something different from knowledge [Wissen] (A 822/B\n850; WOT 8:140–41). Believing and knowing both involve holding\nsomething to be true. When one knows something, one holds it to be\ntrue on grounds that are “subjectively and objectively”\nsufficient, whereas when one believes something, one holds it to be\ntrue on grounds that are subjectively but not objectively sufficient\n(A 822/B 850). Here, Kant takes objective sufficiency to imply valid\ntheoretical grounds, such as evidence or theoretical argument; he\ntakes subjective sufficiency, by contrast, to imply valid practical\ngrounds. Thus, belief entails having valid practical reasons for\nholding something to be true, while lacking valid theoretical reasons\nfor doing so. Indeed, when it comes to belief in God, Kant does not\nthink that knowledge is possible (CPJ 5:471–72). \nKant’s position contains a distinctly moral conception of God.\nIn addition to the attributes of omniscience, omnipresence, and\nomnipotence, he ascribes to God the moral attributes of holiness,\nbenevolence, and justice (LPDR 28:1073–74). God is not only\nauthor and executor of the moral law, but also as its\n“personification” (C 27:322; V 27:530, 723; LPDR 28:1076,\n1091). Kant says that all moral requirements can be seen as divine\ncommands (CPrR 5:129; Rel 6:153). God knows and cares about our virtue\nand well-being. In particular, he cares about the realization of the\nhighest good, in which people attain maximal virtue and, consequently,\nmaximal happiness. This is a God who has created the world, has\nincorporated morality into the world, and has a moral plan for the\nworld (CPrR 5:125; CPJ 5:450). Belief in God allows us to retain our\nfaith that some of our moral actions will produce the intended good\nconsequences, and that if we strive our best to promote the highest\ngood, God will complete the task (C 27:310, 321–22; CPJ\n5:450–53; Rel 6:74–77, 192, 201–202). \nThe relation between God and the highest good is the basis of\nKant’s main argument for belief in God. (See Wood 1970.) The\nargument, most clearly articulated in the Critique of Practical\nReason, goes like this (CPrR 5:110–14, 124–46). The\nmoral law issues categorical demands through each agent’s own\nreason. If the moral law sets forth an end for us to promote, we must\npromote it. For our promotion of this end to be rational, the end must\nbe one that we can rationally view as possible for us to promote\nthrough our own agency. The moral law gives rise to the highest good\n(i.e., virtue and conditioned, proportionate happiness), as practical\nreason’s ultimate end. Thus, we must promote it. Yet it is not\nclear that we are capable of effecting the highest good, given the\nlimitations of our agency and the conditions and workings of the\nnatural world. If the realization of the highest good is not possible,\nhowever, then we cannot rationally promote it as an end; indeed, we\ncannot even make sense of it as an end. But if we do not promote the\nhighest good, we flout the moral law. Now, suppose that there were a\nsupreme, eternal, all powerful, all knowing ruler of the universe\n(i.e., God); he could bring to completion our imperfect strivings for\nthe highest good. Thus, if we postulate the existence of God, we can\nview the highest good as possible, and can rationally follow\nmorality’s command to promote it. There is no reason not to\npostulate God’s existence, since his non-existence cannot be\nproven, and since belief in him does not conflict with any necessary\nbeliefs (CPrR 5:135–43). In addition, since belief in God is\nnecessary for seeing the highest good as possible, we must believe in\nGod (CPrR 5:125–26, 142–46). Thus, belief in God is\ngrounded in the necessity of seeing the highest good as possible, and\nso for the rational compliance with morality. Thus, Kant says that\nbelief in God is morally necessary, and that morality leads\nineluctably to religion (CPrR 5:125). We do not, however, have a duty\nto believe in God. Postulating God’s existence is a theoretical\nexercise of reason, which cannot be morally commanded (CPrR 5:125,\n144). Rather, our duty to promote the highest good gives rise to\n“a need of reason” to assume the possibility of the\nhighest good. From this need emerges the necessity of postulating\nGod’s existence. \nKant’s practical argument differs profoundly from the\nspeculative arguments for God’s existence popular in\nKant’s day–i.e., ontological, cosmological, and\nphysiotheological proofs. His moral argument grounds the necessity of\nbelieving in God in each person’s practical reason, required to\n“orient ourselves in thinking” (WOT 8:136–37).\nAccording to Kant, belief in God is “a postulate of pure\npractical reason”: “a theoretical proposition which is not\nas such demonstrable, but which is an inseparable corollary of an a\npriori unconditionally valid practical law” (CPrR 5:122).\nAlthough practical arguments cannot provide knowledge of God’s\nexistence, they can provide “moral certainty” of\nGod’s existence (A 828–30/B 856–58; CPrR 5:134, 143;\nLPDR 28:1011–12). Such moral certainty is stronger than the sort\nof confidence one could obtain from any theoretical argument. \nHume’s influence on Kant regarding the intersection of religion\nand morality is evident, though difficult to measure. It is also hard\nto tell how much of the influence came directly from Hume’s\nwritings. Hume is not often cited regarding religion in Kant’s\nmajor works. Kant’s Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine\nof Religion, however, suggest familiarity with Hume’s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion, a work which Kant\ncould have read in its entirety in 1781 (Wood 1978: 14–15), and\nperhaps in part when it first came out, since Hamann translated the\nfirst and last parts of it for him (Kuehn 2001: 121). Kant explicitly\ndiscusses Hume’s Dialogues in the section on the\nphysiotheological proof, which is what Kant calls the argument from\ndesign (see LPDR 28:1063–4). Furthermore, in the Danzig\nmanuscript of these lectures, Kant cites Hume within his argument\nagainst the cosmotheological proof (Ak 28:1266; Wood 1978: 83n31).\nKant was clearly also familiar with Hume’s The Natural\nHistory of Religion. In “A History of Natural Theology,\naccording to Meiners’ Historia doctrinae de uno vero\nDeo”, Kant refers briefly to Hume’s account of\npolytheists as tolerant in section 9 of The Natural History of\nReligion (LPDR 28:1125). \nFinally, it is interesting to note that many philosophers and other\nintellectuals in Königsberg in the late 1750s and early 1760s\nseem to have attributed to Hume a view of religion that has something\nsignificant in common with Kant’s mature view. Hamann and others\nsaw Hume’s skepticism as necessary for purging religion of its\npoor arguments and traditional associations, and clearing the way for\ntrue religion. One source for this view of Hume is the conclusion of\nbook I of the Treatise, which Hamann translated into German\n(with some alterations and excisions to hide its origin) and published\nanonymously in 1771 under the title “Night Thoughts of a\nSceptic” (Kuehn 2001: 198–201). Another source is the end\nof the Dialogues, where Philo says, “To be a\nphilosophical skeptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most\nessential step towards being a sound, believing Christian” (DR\n89). This statement is out of line with Philo’s previous\nassertions and arguments, and comes as a surprise at this point in the\nthe text. Some take Hume to be arguing here that once a person has\nrid themselves of philosophically suspect rational justifications for\nbelief in God, he is free to embrace religion based simply on faith.\nAt least this seems to be how Hamann interprets Hume. Kant, of course is no\nfideist, for he does not take a leap of faith based on revealed\nreligion to be the proper ground for belief in God. Still, Kant does\nendorse the notion that when one clears away the fallacious or at\nleast inadequate metaphysical arguments for the existence of God found\nin philosophical theology, one is able to see that morality itself\noffers an argument for God’s existence which both allows for\n(moral) certainty and addresses people in a moving, concrete way.","contact.mail":"ewilson30@gsu.edu","contact.domain":"gsu.edu"},{"date.published":"2008-03-26","date.changed":"2018-03-29","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-hume-morality/","author1":"Eric Entrican Wilson","author2":"Lara Denis","entry":"kant-hume-morality","body.text":"\n\n\nThe relationship between Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) and David\nHume (1711–1776) is a source of longstanding fascination. Kant\ncredited Hume with waking him from his “dogmatic slumber”,\nand he describes the Critique of Pure Reason, arguably\nthe most important work of modern philosophy, as the solution to\nthe “Humean problem in its greatest possible\namplification” (Prol 4:260–61). Much of the focus has been\non their respective views in metaphysics and epistemology. Yet, as\nThomas Nagel remarks, contemporary moral philosophy also\n“continues to be dominated by the disagreement between these two\ngiants” (Nagel 2012). Comparing Hume and Kant therefore provides\nopportunity to clarify and assess two of the modern era’s most\ninfluential approaches to the central problems of moral philosophy.\nComparing their views also illuminates the landscape of\neighteenth-century ethical thought. Although there are many points at\nwhich Kant’s and Hume’s ethics stand in opposition to each\nother, there are also important connections between the two. Kant\nshared with Hume some important assumptions about morality, virtue,\nand motivation. Indeed, early in his career he had been attracted to\nthe sentimentalism of Hume and other British moralists, especially\nFrancis Hutcheson (1694–1746), and the influence lingered long\nafter he changed his mind about the value of their approach.\n\n\nFor the sake of brevity, this article assumes familiarity with\nHume’s and Kant’s main contributions to moral philosophy.\nThe aim here is not to summarize their views or compare them on all\nmatters ethical. Instead, the task is to examine several key areas\nwhere we can reasonably see Kant as responding to or influenced by\nHume, or where comparisons between their views are particularly\nfruitful.\n\n\n\n\nHume and Kant operate with two somewhat different conceptions of\nmorality itself, which helps explain some of the differences\nbetween their respective approaches to moral philosophy. The\nmost important difference is that Kant sees law, duty, and obligation\nas the very heart of morality, while Hume does not. In this respect,\nKant’s conception of morality resembles what Bernard Williams\ncalls “the moral system”, which defines the domain of\nmorality primarily in terms of an unconditionally binding and\ninescapable form of obligation (Williams 1985: 193–94). Kant\nbelieves that our moral concerns are dominated by the question of what\nduties are imposed on us by a law that commands with a uniquely moral\nnecessity. Like most eighteenth-century philosophers, he also believes\nthat our moral lives are preoccupied with the question of how to be\nvirtuous over the course of a life, but he defines virtue in terms of\nthe more fundamental concepts of law, obligation, and duty. By\ncontrast, these concepts certainly figure into morality as Hume\nunderstands it, but they are far less central. For Hume, the broader\nand somewhat looser notion of “personal merit” lies at the\nheart of morality (EPM 9.1.1). Our moral concerns are dominated by the\nquestion of which motives are virtuous, and we answer this question by\nlooking to the responses of our fellow human beings, who—when\nviewing things properly—approve of those motives and character\ntraits that are useful or immediately agreeable (EPM 9.1.13). These\nare the terms that characterize duty and obligation for Hume, rather\nthan the other way around. \nTwo other differences are worth noting for the purposes of this\narticle. First, Kant draws a bright line between moral and non-moral\nphenomena, such as prudence, politics, or art. Morality’s\nnormative standards and the nature of its demands distinguish it\nsharply from the non-moral. For Hume, the line between the moral and\nnon-moral is far blurrier. He frequently assimilates moral judgment to\n“taste” or judgments about beauty and deformity (Gill\n2007), and he explicitly argues against the strict separation of moral\nvirtues from other personal qualities such as a quick wit or even good\nlooks (T 3.3.4–5). According to Hume, the strict separation of\nmoral and non-moral virtues marks one way in which modern moral\nthought is inferior to ancient ethics; he also seems to suspect that\nit reflects an unhealthy fixation on responsibility and guilt\ninherited from Christianity (Darwall 2013: 8–9). A second\nimportant difference is closely related to the first. For Kant the\nmoral is distinguished from the non-moral not only by a special form\nof obligation but also by its elevation above the rest of life.\nMorality itself has a unique status or “dignity”, as does\nthe rational being from whose autonomous will the law springs (G\n4:435). The proper response to both is a correspondingly unique form\nof reverence or “respect”, which morality demands equally\nfrom each of us. Kant believes that in the moral domain we take\nourselves—often only implicitly—to be\n“persons”, elevated above mere “things” such\nas machines or other animals. One of our chief moral concerns is to\nprotect this status, which requires respecting the rational autonomy\nat its source and avoiding behavior or patterns of thought and desire\nthat dishonor or degrade persons by treating ourselves or others as\nmere things. This concern looms large in Kant’s conception of\nmorality, and it has a profound influence on his approach to moral\nphilosophy (Anderson 2008). We see it, for example, in his discussions\nof respect for persons and his characterization of ethical virtue as\n“love of honor” (cf. Denis 2014). We see it also in the\npriority given to duties to self (cf. Denis 2010a), as well as\nKant’s claim that a person throws herself away and makes herself\nan object of “contempt” when she lies to herself or\ngrovels before others, for example (MM 6:420). Hume does not see things\nthis way. For Hume, the domain of morality is not particularly pure,\nspecial, or elevated. It sometimes shows us at our most benevolent or\nmost magnanimous, but morality is continuous with the rest of life,\nincluding politics and the pursuit of wealth and status in modern\ncommercial society. Moral virtue is undoubtedly pleasing to us,\nsometimes powerfully so, but it does not command a unique\nform of respect or reverence. Neither do the rules and ideals of\nmorality, which spring from the same propensities, ideas, and passions\nthat drive the rest of human behavior. Notions of honor and dignity\nmay figure into Hume’s view of morality but they are far from\ncentral. Morality has us far more concerned with promoting pleasure\nand utility. \nHume and Kant both believe that philosophy should dig beneath the\nsurface of morality and present a theory of its foundation. When it\ncomes to morality’s foundation, they seem to agree on two\nthings. First, morality’s foundation cannot be located in\nreligion. Second, it cannot be found in mind-independent facts about\nthe world. Yet they disagree about the rest of the story. Hume locates\nthe foundation of morality in human nature, primarily in our emotional\nresponses to the behavior of our fellow human beings. By contrast,\nKant locates the foundation of morality in the rational nature that we\nshare with all possible finite rational beings. He argues that\nmorality’s foundation lies in the “autonomy” of the\nrational will. Kant’s notion of autonomy is one of the more\ncentral, distinctive, and influential aspects of his ethics. He\ndefines autonomy as “the property of the will by which it is a\nlaw to itself (independently of any property of the objects of\nvolition)” (G 4:440). According to Kant, the will of a moral\nagent is autonomous in that it both gives itself the moral law (is\nself-legislating) and can constrain or motivate itself to follow the\nlaw (is self-constraining or self-motivating). The source of the moral\nlaw is not in the agent’s feelings, natural impulses or\ninclinations, but in her “pure” rational will, which Kant\nidentifies as the “proper self” (G 4:461). A heteronomous\nwill, on the other hand, is governed by something other than itself,\nsuch as an external force or authority. \nThese rival conceptions of morality and its foundation correspond to\ntwo very different approaches to moral philosophy. Hume’s\napproach could be called naturalistic, empirical, or experimental. His\nmoral philosophy is part of his larger endeavor to provide a\nnaturalistic explanation of human nature as a whole. Hume’s\napproach relies on and reflects his philosophy of mind, which is\nempirical in its approach. He treats ethics, together with psychology,\nhistory, aesthetics, and politics, as the subject of his “moral\nscience”. Hume often seems more interested in explaining\nmorality as a natural phenomenon than in setting out a normative\nethical theory, treating moral action as part of the same physical\nworld in which we explain things in terms of cause and effect (EHU\n8.1.20–22). On this view, everything we do is open to empirical\ninvestigation and explanation. In fact, Hume often compares humans\nwith other animals, tracing the bases of human morality to features of\nthe mind that human beings and other animals have in common (T\n2.1.12). \nIn sharp contrast with Hume, Kant insists on the need for an a\npriori investigation of morality’s foundation. His detailed\ntreatment of virtue and moral judgment draws heavily on observations\nand ideas about human nature. But Kant makes explicit that morality\nmust be based on a supreme moral principle, which can only be\ndiscovered a priori, through a method of pure moral\nphilosophy (G 4:387–92). By “pure” or a\npriori moral philosophy, Kant has in mind a philosophy grounded\nexclusively on principles that are inherent in and revealed through\nthe operations of reason. According to Kant, morality’s commands\nare unconditional. We could never discover a principle that commands\nall rational beings with such absolute authority through a method of\nempirical moral philosophy. An empirical approach, he argues, can tell\nus how people do act, but it cannot tell us how we ought to act.\nMoreover, we must keep the pure and empirical parts of moral\nphilosophy clearly distinguished, since if we do not we could find\nourselves confusing conditional truths, such as what is prudentially\ngood for certain individuals or species, with unconditional truths\nabout fundamental moral requirements (G 4:389–90). Once one has\nin hand the supreme principle of morality, however, one requires an\nunderstanding of human beings in order to apply it to them (MM 6:217).\nOne can say little about what the supreme moral principle requires as\nduties human agents have to themselves and to one another without\nknowing such things as the sorts of ends people may be inclined to\nadopt and the conditions under which human agency will\ncharacteristically thrive or wither. \nHume’s treatment of causality exerted a profound influence on\nKant. He tells us that his “labor” in the Critique of\nPure Reason was fundamentally a response to “that Humean\nskeptical teaching” (CPrR 5:32). The direct impact of\nHume’s moral philosophy is less clear. Early in his career Kant\nendorsed an idiosyncratic form of sentimentalism. But he often\nindicated that he saw Hutcheson as more significant to ethics than\nHume. He seems to have associated Hutcheson more with the positive\ninsights about the role of sensibility in ethics, whereas he seems to\nhave associated Hume more with skepticism about practical reason\n(Kuehn 2001: 182). Sentimentalism’s positive influence on Kant\nwas strongest during the early part of his career. As his views\ndeveloped, he noted its inadequacies with increasing frequency,\neventually rejecting any version of sentimentalism as a theory of\nmorality’s foundation. Yet elements of the tradition continued\nto influence Kant’s mature thinking about the nature and\nimportance of emotion in morality. \nKant’s early debt to sentimentalism is evident in two of his\npublished works from the 1760s. In Observations on the Feeling of\nthe Beautiful and Sublime (1764), which often reads like the work\nof a mid-eighteenth century British thinker, Kant notes and analyzes\nthe various feelings of pleasure or displeasure, and attraction and\naversion, people feel to different traits and temperaments in\nthemselves and others (and to different types of literature, objects\nin nature, kinds of relationships, and other things). His statements\nabout the foundation of morality and its principles convey a\ncommitment to some form of sentimentalism, however idiosyncratic. He\nclaims, for example, that the principles of morality are  \nnot speculative rules, but the consciousness of a feeling that lives\nin every human breast and that extends much further than to the\nspecial grounds of sympathy and complaisance. (OFBS 2.217)  \nHe describes this as “the feeling of the beauty and the dignity\nof human nature”, proclaiming that one can “bring about\nthe noble attitude that is the beauty of virtue” only when a\nperson “subordinates” her particular inclinations\n“to such an enlarged” feeling of the beauty and dignity of\nhuman nature (OFBS 2.217). Kant expresses a similar line of thought in\nanother work from the period, Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness\nof the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality (1763), where\nhe distinguishes between the faculty for representing truth and the\nfaculty for experiencing the good, identifying the latter with\nfeeling. “Just as there are unanalyzable concepts of\nthe true”, Kant argues,  \nso too there is an unanalyzable feeling of the good… One of the\ntasks of the understanding is to analyze and render distinct the\ncompound and confused concept of the good by showing how it arises\nfrom simpler feelings of the good. (I 2:299) \nOther indications of sentimentalism’s influence can be found in\nKant’s notes and lectures from that period. For example, in the\nannouncement of his lectures for the winter semester of\n1765–1766, he explains one difference between ethics and\nmetaphysics by remarking that  \nthe distinction between good and evil in actions, and the judgment of\nmoral rightness, can be known, easily and accurately, by the human\nheart through what is called sentiment, and that without elaborate\nnecessity of proofs. (WS 2:311)  \nIn the same announcement, he states his intention to develop and clarify\n \nthe attempts of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson and Hume, which, though\nimperfect and defective, have nevertheless come farthest in the\ndiscovery of the first principles of all morality. (WS 2:311)  \nSimilarly, in notes that appear to come from between 1764 and 1768,\nKant writes, “[t]he rules of morality proceed from a special,\neponymous feeling, upon which the understanding is\nguided…” (NF 19:93 #6581). \nIf Kant was genuinely trying out a version of sentimentalism in the\n1760s, this phase did not last long, nor was it a simple adoption of\nthe theories of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, or Hume. His description of\ntheir approach as “imperfect and defective” already\nindicates some dissatisfaction with sentimentalism. By the late 1760s\nit was a theme of Kant’s notes and lectures that it could not\nprovide an adequate account of moral obligation. Morality imposes\nunconditional requirements, and he became increasingly convinced that\nsentimentalism could not explain or justify such requirements.\nArguments for this conclusion appear in Kant’s later written\nworks and lectures. In a number of works, Kant creates taxonomies of\nmisguided, heteronomous ethical theories based on material determining\ngrounds—in contrast to his theory of autonomy, in which the\nmoral motive constitutes an objective, formal determining ground (see\nWood 2005b [Other Internet Resources]; Irwin 2009: chapters 68 and 71;\nand Schneewind 2009). Kant distinguishes among these theories based on\ntheir accounts of the basis of moral obligation or the fundamental\nmoral principle (G 4:441–44; CPrR 5:39–41; C 27:\n252–54; M 29:621–25). Such theories may assume either\nsubjective (empirical) or objective (rational) determining grounds for\nthe moral principle; and within each of these categories, there are\ntheories that assume these determining grounds are external, and\nothers that assume they are internal. Objective, internal grounds\ninclude perfection (e.g., Wolff and the Stoics). Objective, external\ngrounds include the will of God (e.g., Crusius). Subjective, external\ngrounds include education (e.g., Montaigne) or civil constitution\n(e.g., Mandeville). Subjective, internal grounds can include physical\nfeeling, such as self-love (e.g., Epicurus) or self-interest (e.g.,\nHobbes), or moral feeling (e.g., Hutcheson) (CPrR 5:40; C 27:253).\nThus, Kant locates moral sense theories among those theories that\nassume a subjective, empirical, internal determining ground of moral\nfeeling as the principle of morality (cf. M 29:621). \nFrom the Groundwork on, Kant registers a number of complaints\nagainst sentimentalism, all of which cluster around what he takes to\nbe the core insight into its inadequacy. No empirical principles can\nground moral laws, because moral laws bind all rational beings\nuniversally, necessarily, and unconditionally; empirical principles\nare contingent in various ways, for example, on aspects of human\nnature (G 4:442–43). Variance in moral feelings makes them an\ninadequate standard of good and evil (G 4:442). Moral feelings cannot\nbe the source of the supreme moral principle, because the supreme\nmoral principle holds for all rational beings, whereas feelings differ\nfrom person to person (M 29:625). If duty were grounded in feeling, it\nwould seem that morality would bind some people (e.g., the\ntender-hearted) more strongly than others, contrary to the universal,\nequal nature of moral obligation. Even if people were in complete\nagreement regarding their moral feelings, the universality of these\nfeelings would be a contingent matter, and thus an inadequate ground\nfor the unconditionally binding moral law. Indeed, if morality were\ngrounded in feeling, it would be arbitrary: God could have constituted\nus so that we would get from vice the pleasurable, calm feelings of\napproval that we now (allegedly) get from virtue (M 29:625). So for\nKant, the contingency of the ground of obligation offered by moral\nsense theories renders those theories inadequate; only a\npriori determining grounds will do. \nAs these criticisms indicate, Kant’s mature view is\nfundamentally opposed to sentimentalism in a variety of ways. Yet the\ninfluence of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume lingered long after Kant\ncame to believe that morality’s true foundation lies in the\nautonomy of the will, and he continued to find value in their\napproach. In his notes Kant remarks that moral sense theories are\nbetter understood as providing a hypothesis explaining why we in fact\nfeel approval and disapproval of various actions than as supplying a\nprinciple that justifies approval or disapproval or that guides\nactions (NF 19:117 #6626). He also suggests that even if one rejects\nmoral sense “as a principle for the judgment of moral\naction” one might still accept it as a theory “of the\nmind’s incentives to morality” (M 29:625). Quite\nstrikingly, Kant also continues to believe some version of his earlier\nclaim in Observations that some of our feelings indicate a\n“susceptibility of the soul which… makes it fit for\nvirtuous impulses” (OFBS 2:208). We see this in the\nMetaphysics of Morals, for instance, where Kant claims\nthat moral feeling, conscience, love of one’s neighbor, and\nself-respect all “lie at the basis of morality, as\nsubjective conditions of receptiveness to the concept of\nduty” (MM 6:399; see Guyer 2010). The lingering influence of\nsentimentalism can also be seen in his emphasis on the obligation to\n“sympathize actively” with others, and in the claim that\nwe have “an indirect duty to cultivate the compassionate natural\n(aesthetic) feelings in us, and to make use of them as so many means\nto sympathy based on moral principles and the feeling appropriate to\nthem… . For this [compassion] is still one of the impulses that\nnature has implanted in us to do what the representation of duty alone\nmight not accomplish (MM 6:457). \nKant, as discussed above, underwent a decisive change of mind about\nthe views of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. Early in his career, he\nendorsed core aspects of their approach, but Kant’s mature work\nis organized around the idea that reason, rather than feeling\nor emotion, is the highest authority in the moral domain. In this\nrespect, many features of his moral philosophy are fundamentally\nopposed to Hume’s. We can see this opposition at work in their\nrespective accounts of moral judgment and moral motivation. A careful\nlook at these topics, however, also highlights sentimentalism’s\nresidual influence on Kant. \nAccording to Hume, moral judgments typically concern the character\ntraits and motives behind human actions. To make a moral judgment is\nto detect, by means of a sentiment, the operation of a virtuous or\nvicious quality of mind. The sentiment here is a\n“peculiar” kind of feeling—namely, a feeling of\napproval (love, pride) or disapproval (hatred, humility) (T 3.3.1.3).\nWe call the traits that elicit our approval “virtues”, and\nthose that elicit our disapproval “vices”. Sentiments of\napproval and disapproval are passions, but they tend to be “soft\nand gentle” and therefore easily mistaken for thoughts or ideas\n(T 3.1.2.1). The real story is that “morality… is more\nproperly felt than judg’d of” (T 3.1.2.1). Reason and\nexperience are required for determining the likely effects of a given\nmotive or character trait, so reason does play an important role in\nmoral judgment. Yet reason’s role is subordinate. It is one\nthing to say that a given trait tends to be useful or conducive to\npleasure and quite another to say that it is “good” or\n“virtuous”. The moral value of a trait is conferred by the\nsentiment of approval, which “gilding and staining all natural\nobjects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises, in\na manner, a new creation” (EPM App. I.21). Hume argues, however,\nthat only those sentiments experienced from a “general point of\nview” count as genuinely moral (T 3.1.2.4). For example, a\nperson might hate or envy the courage of her enemy but this is not\nnecessarily a moral response. The moral sentiment is\nexperienced when she considers her enemy’s courage from a\n“general point of view” (T 3.1.2.4). When a person\nconsiders things from this point of view, she looks upon them as a\n“judicious spectator”, who is disinterested but not\nemotionally unaffected by the scene she beholds (Cohon 2008:\n126–58). On the contrary, rather than eliminating her\nsentiments, the judicious spectator enlarges them by means of\nsympathy, which enables her to resent the misery of others or rejoice\nin their happiness. (Regarding the mechanism of sympathy, see Taylor\n2015: 189–94.) \nKant offers a very different account of moral judgment. He focuses on\nthe first-person judgments an agent (not a spectator) must make about\nhow to behave. In his view, the primary question is whether a\nparticular mode of conduct is permissible, required, or forbidden in\nlight of the moral law, and sentiment or emotion has no authority in\nthis matter. Answering the question requires an operation of\nreason by means of which the agent determines whether her\nprinciple or “maxim” of conduct conflicts with the moral\nlaw. Because she is an imperfect and finite rational being, the law\npresents itself to her as a “categorical imperative” (CI).\nIt is an imperative because it commands and constrains us; it is\ncategorical because it commands and constrains us with ultimate\nauthority and without regard to our personal preferences or any\nempirically contingent ends (G 4:413–20). The two best known\nformulations of the CI are the formula of universal law (FUL), which\ncommands, “act only in accordance with that maxim through\nwhich you can at the same time will that it become a universal\nlaw” (G 4:421), and the formula of the end in itself (FEI),\nwhich commands, “So act that you use humanity, whether in\nyour own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time\nas an end, never merely as a means” (G 4:429). Scholars\ndisagree about the relationship between these two formulations of the\nCI, as well as their relationship to the other formulations Kant\nprovides. There is also disagreement about whether FUL or FEI has\nprimacy in deliberation and moral judgment. Kant claims that FUL is\nthe standard everyone actually does employ in moral judgment (G 4:402;\nCPrR 5:69), and some scholars defend its primacy (e.g., Engstrom\n2009). Others argue in favor of FEI, emphasizing, in particular, its\nrole in the Metaphysics of Morals, where FEI seems to play\nthe fundamental role in guiding judgment about specific ethical duties\n(e.g., Wood 1999). \nSome passages from Kant’s work seem to suggest that moral\njudgment requires no experience, no knowledge of human nature and\nlocal custom, and no emotional sensitivity. A rational being equipped\nwith a purely formal procedure for testing maxims has all she needs.\nYet such passages are misleading when read in isolation. This is not\nKant’s view of how human beings do, or even should, make moral\njudgments (Wood 2008: 56). First, application of the CI typically\nrequires auxiliary or subordinate “principles of\napplication”, which must be taken from our empirical knowledge\nof human nature (MM 6:217). Second, Kant frequently emphasizes that no\nformal procedure could specify all the principles for applying\nhigher-order principles. Principles of application help us apply\nhigher order principles to concrete circumstances, but there is no\nsubstitute for experience and “judgment”, which is a knack\nor uncodifiable talent (A138/B172). This is why the practice of\ncasuistry is “woven into ethics” (MM 6:411). Third,\nexperience and judgment are also required because the moral law\n“cannot specify precisely in what way one is to act and how much\none is to do by the action for an end that is also a duty” (MM\n6:390). The wider the duty, the more latitude for individual judgment\nand experience (MM 6:390). Finally, it is clear that, on Kant’s\nview, moral judgment requires emotional sensitivity and an\nunderstanding of social convention. For example, without these, one\nmight unable to determine whether a particular act of beneficence is\nmore condescending than kind (MM 6:453) or to prevent friendly banter\nfrom sliding into disrespectful mockery (MM 6:467). Proper moral\njudgment in such circumstances requires attunement to the feelings of\nothers, but also facility with the social conventions that shape the\ndynamics of personal interaction. \nKant and Hume are clearly opposed on the question of whether reason or\nfeeling has the final say in moral matters. Hume assigns reason to a\nsubordinate role, while Kant takes reason to be the highest normative\nauthority. However, it is important not to misunderstand the nature of\ntheir opposition. Hume offers an empirical explanation of the moral\njudgments made in “common life”, which he takes to be part\nof his broader science of human nature. This is his main focus. By\ncontrast, Kant makes observations about the “common” use\nof reason in morality (e.g., G 4:399), but this is not his main focus.\nHe says relatively little about what is going on in our heads or the\nsurrounding social environment when we actually make moral judgments.\nAs noted above, Kant at least entertained the possibility that\nsentimentalism provides the correct empirical explanation of why human\nbeings tend to approve or disapprove of the actions and motives that\nthey do (NF 19:117 #6626). What Kant insists on is that such responses\ncan be justified only by pure reason, which is the only faculty\ncapable of understanding the unconditional necessity of the moral\nlaw’s commands. Emotion or feeling plays an important role in\nguiding our application of this law to particular maxims in concrete\ncircumstances, but feeling’s role is definitely subordinate to\nreason’s. \nA similar contrast between Hume and Kant can be found in their\nrespective accounts of moral motivation. Hume famously claims\nthat “Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions,\nand can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem” (T 2.3.3.4). The claim is not that reason has no role in\nhuman action, but rather that its role is subordinate to passion. Hume\noffers three main arguments for this claim in A Treatise of Human\nNature. (There is debate among interpreters about whether Hume\nchanged his position on reason and motivation between the\nTreatise and the second Enquiry, as well as\nprecisely what Hume’s understanding of the nature, extent, and\nsignificance of reason’s contribution to action is (see, e.g.,\nMilgram 1995; Radcliffe 1997; Cohon 2008: chapters 2 and 3; and Irwin\n2008: chapter 26).) \nAccording to the first argument, “reason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will” (T 2.3.3.1). Abstract (or\ndemonstrative) reasoning, which involves a priori inferences\nand judgments pertaining to relations of ideas, cannot influence the\nwill, but only assist us in our pursuit of an end we already have\n(e.g., if mathematical calculations would facilitate our achievement\nof our end). Probable (or causal) reasoning helps us discover cause\nand effect relations among objects of experience conducive to the\nrealization of pre-selected ends, but such information about cause and\neffect can never motivate action on its own: “It can never in\nthe least concern us to know, that such objects are causes, and such\nothers effects, if both causes and effects be indifferent to us”\n(T 2.3.3.3). In order to be motivated to act, we must first anticipate\npleasure or pain from something. That anticipated pleasure or pain\ngives rise to feelings of desire or aversion for the object in\nquestion. Probable reasoning allows us to discern the causes of this\nobject; our positive or negative feelings about the object then spread\nto the causes of it; and we are then motivated to pursue or to avoid\nthem. Simply believing that one thing causes another will not motivate\naction (T 2.3.3.2). \nA second argument, which builds on the first, aims to show that reason\n“can never oppose passion in the direction of the will” (T\n2.3.3.1). The only thing that can oppose an impulse to action\ngenerated by one passion is a contrary impulse. Reason, then, could\ncounteract an impulse to action generated by a passion if and only if\nreason could itself generate a contrary impulse. But from the first\nargument, we know that that reason cannot generate such an impulse.\n“Thus it appears, that the principle, which opposes any passion,\ncannot be the same with reason, and is only called so in an improper\nsense” (T 2.3.3.4). Hume goes on to say that whatever we feel in\nus running contrary to an impulse to act that we mistake for reason\nmust be something else, such as a calm passion (e.g., a general\nappetite for the good, benevolence, or aversion to evil; T\n2.3.3.8). \nThe third argument claims that a passion is an “original\nexistence”, not an idea, or a mental copy of another object.\nContradiction to truth and reason “consists in the disagreement\nof ideas, consider’d as copies, with those objects, which they\nrepresent” (T 2.3.3.5). So a passion cannot be contrary to truth\nand reason. Passions cannot, strictly speaking, be evaluated as\nreasonable or unreasonable, despite our practice of calling passions\nunreasonable or irrational when they depend in some way on poor\nreasoning or false beliefs. Later in the Treatise, Hume\nextends this argument to volitions and actions as well (T 3.1.1.9); we\nmight view Kant’s conflict in conception and contradiction in\nwill tests of the formula of universal law to constitute refutations\nof the latter argument (G 4:421–24; see Guyer 2008: ch. 5). \nThese arguments convey the main components of Hume’s view of\nmotivation: passion plays the dominant role in motivating action,\nreason a merely subsidiary role; reason cannot control or resist\npassion’s motivational influence; and one cannot use the\nstandards of reason to praise or criticize passions. Hume draws some\nfurther important, anti-rationalist moral conclusions from this line\nof thought. One obvious implication is that reason cannot be the\nmotive to moral action; if reason cannot motivate any sort of action,\nit cannot motivate moral action. A second further conclusion is that\nmorality (fundamental moral principles) cannot be grounded in reason;\nthis one follows both from his views about the “inertness”\nof reason generally, and from his assumption that morality is capable\nof motivating people:  \nMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of\nitself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality,\ntherefore, are not conclusions of reason. (T 3.1.1.6) \nKant never directly addresses Hume’s arguments, but he clearly\nrejects the idea that reason is motivationally “impotent”\nor enslaved to the passions. It is a central feature of his moral\nphilosophy that pure reason can be “practical”—that\nreason can “of itself, independently of anything empirical,\ndetermine the will” (CPrR 5: 42). He says of right actions that\nthey “need no recommendation” from emotion or personal\ninclination. Such actions  \npresent the will that practices them as the object of an immediate\nrespect, and nothing but reason is required to impose them\nupon the will. (G 4:435)  \nMoreover, in the first section of the Groundwork, Kant\nrepeatedly emphasizes the special form of “moral worth”\nthat attaches to right actions that are performed simply because they\nare right—i.e., actions motivated from “from duty”\nor “from respect for the law” (G 4:396–401; see\nTimmermann 2009a). \nYet Kant also holds that emotion or feeling is involved somehow in\npure reason’s motivational influence on finite rational beings\n(such as humans). In the Groundwork, he focuses on the\nfeeling of “respect” or reverence for the moral law. Early\nin the Groundwork, Kant describes respect in a manner that\nmakes it sound like a felt aspect of the law itself:  \nan action from duty is to put aside entirely the influence of\ninclination, and with it every object of the will; hence there is left\nfor the will nothing that could determine it the except objectively\nthe law and subjectively pure respect for this\npractical law. (G 4:400)  \nBut his subsequent development of respect makes it sound more like a\nseparate feeling, though one arising from reason: \nBut although respect is a feeling, it is not one received by means of\ninfluence; it is, instead, a feeling self-wrought by a\nrational concept and therefore specifically different from all\nfeelings of the first kind, which can be referred to inclination or\nfear. What I cognize immediately as a law for me, I cognize with\nrespect, which signifies merely consciousness of the subordination of\nmy will to a law without the mediation of other influences on any\nsense. Immediate determination of the will by means of the law and the\nconsciousness of this is called respect, so that this is\nregarded as the effect of the law on the subject, and not as\nthe cause of the law. (G 4:401 n; also see 460) \nDespite his emphasis on the motivational efficacy of pure reason,\nKant’s discussion of respect makes clear that feeling must be\nsomehow involved in human moral motivation (see Guyer 2008: ch. 5; and\nGuyer 2010). In the Groundwork, Kant states:  \nIn order for a sensibly affected rational being to will that for which\nreason alone prescribes the ‘ought,’ it is admittedly\nrequired that his reason have the capacity to induce a feeling of\npleasure or of delight in the fulfillment of duty, and thus there\nis required a causality of reason to determine sensibility in\nconformity with its principles. (G 4:460)  \nEven though we cannot know (or “make intelligible a\npriori”) how a thought or judgment about the morality of an\naction “can itself produce a sensation of pleasure or\npain”, Kant thinks that this somehow does happen; it must, if\nmoral considerations are to be motivating in beings like us. The\nphenomenology of respect is unusual, as it involves both pain and\npleasure (or something like it). There is the humiliation an agent\nfeels when the moral law strikes down her self-conceit; but respect\nalso feels invigorating and ennobling, since the moral law comes from\nthe agent’s own reason and represents her higher self and\nvocation (CPrR 5:73). However one interprets the phenomenology,\nrespect seems to function as an intermediary between reason and the\nwill. This raises questions about the consistency of Kant’s\nview, since he argues repeatedly that pure reason can, and should,\ndetermine the will “immediately”. For this and other\nreasons, scholars are divided on how to interpret Kant’s\ntreatment of respect. According to an “intellectualist”\nline of interpretation, respect is the effect of pure\nreason’s motivational influence on the will. In other words, we\ngrasp the law by means of reason, are moved to act accordingly, and\nfeel respect as a result of being so moved. According to an\n“affectivist” approach, however, respect is the proximate\ncause of reason’s influence on the will. In other\nwords, our rational grasp of the law’s demand produces a feeling\nof respect or reverence, which then moves the will (or higher faculty\nof desire). Vexingly, both interpretations have a strong textual basis\nand both have been defended with great skill and insight. (For an\nexcellent discussion of the issues, see Frierson 2014: ch. 4.) \nIn the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant also describes the\nmotivational role played by additional feelings. He lists moral\nfeeling, conscience, love of human beings, and respect (for oneself)\nas special kinds of feelings of which we are made aware only though\nconsciousness of the moral law (MM 6:399). Kant describes these as\n“moral endowments” that “lie at the basis of\nmorality” or the “subjective conditions of\nreceptivity to the concept of duty” (MM 6:399). Since our\ncompliance with duty presupposes our having these feelings, there is\nno duty for us to have them. However, because of their\nindispensibility to human morality, there is a duty to cultivate them.\nAdditionally, Kant clearly sees moral value in some sensibly-grounded\n(“pathological”) feelings (MM 6:456–57, 458; also M\n29:626; NF 19:77 #6560). Speaking of sympathy, which is perhaps the\nbest example of this sort of feeling, Kant says,  \nit is… an indirect duty to cultivate the natural…\nfeelings in us, and to make use of them as so many means to sympathy\nbased on moral principles and the feeling appropriate to them. (MM\n6:457)  \nSympathy allows us better to understand others’ needs, helps us\nto communicate our concern for them, and can act as an additional\nincentive to facilitate our promotion of our happiness helping others.\nSuch sensibly-grounded feelings can work with rationally-grounded\nfeelings in order to motivate us to act morally. We may cultivate\nsympathetic feelings from respect for the law, and then find these\nfeelings prompting us to act in certain ways. In this context, where\nthe focus is on virtue, Kant sounds closer to Hume than he is often\ntaken to be. Indeed, according to one prominent interpretation,\ncareful consideration of this and other relevant material highlights\nat least a few “deep affinities” between Kant on Hume on\nmotivation and practical reason (Guyer 2008: 164). \nDespite the above similarities, Kant and Hume are clearly opposed on\nthe basic question of whether pure reason, to use Kant’s\nexpression, can be motivationally efficacious. Kant thinks it can,\nwhile Hume does not. However, one must interpret this opposition with\ncare. First, Kant’s account of respect makes clear that feeling\nor emotion is involved even when pure reason motivates action. The\n“affectivist” interpretation of respect, in particular,\nsuggests that Kant and Hume actually agree that reason cannot motivate\naction without the intervention of feeling. The crucial difference\nbetween them is that Kant believes pure reason capable of producing a\nmotivationally efficacious feeling (respect), while Hume believes\nnothing of the sort. The opposition between them is even starker if\nthe “intellectualist” interpretation is correct. Second,\nKant’s account of virtue makes it clear that feelings such as\nlove and sympathy often play an important moral role in the motivation\nof human action. Indeed, feelings appear to be indispensible for human\nbeings and should therefore be cultivated and strengthened through\ndeliberate practice. Third, one must keep track of the level at which\nthese two philosophers disagree. Consider, for example, the reason why\nHume would adamantly reject Kant’s attribution of a special form\nof “moral worth” to actions done “from duty”.\nAccording to Hume,  \nno action can be virtuous, or morally good, unless there be in\nhuman nature some motive to produce it, distinct from a sense of its\nmorality. (T 3.2.1.7)  \nTo avoid circularity, there must be a motive to virtuous action that\ndoes not itself refer to the moral goodness of the act (T 3.2.1.4).\nFor Hume, the only time one would have to rely on one’s sense of\nthe goodness of an act to motivate oneself to do it is when one is\ndeficient in the natural feelings that ordinarily prompt people to act\nmorally (e.g., natural affection, generosity, gratitude). The two\nphilosophers do not necessarily disagree here on the\nempirical question of what actually motivates people. Hume\nseems to countenance the possibility of being motivated directly by\nthe sense of an action’s moral goodness. Kant, in fact, seems\ncomparatively skeptical; he expresses doubt that there have ever been\nhuman actions motivated from duty alone (e.g., G 4:406–407).\nThey disagree sharply, however, on the normative question at\nissue. Kant believes that the most morally admirable actions are\nperformed “from duty” alone. These are the only actions\nthat have true “moral worth”. By contrast, Hume believes\nthat such actions indicate a character flaw. Indeed, if a person finds\nshe is moved to act only by the sense that the action is good, she may\nvery well reproach herself for a lack of generosity or gratitude, for\nexample, and consequently form a desire to change her character. \nHume and Kant both treat the concepts of virtue and vice as central to\nhuman morality. But they differ on the basic nature of virtue, and\nthey present different catalogues of particular virtues and vices.\nKant’s discussions reflect his consistent emphasis on freedom,\ndignity, rationality, and purity of motive. Hume’s reflect his\nemphasis on utility, pleasure, and the inherently social nature of the\nhuman mind. Correspondingly, the notion of internal struggle is\ncentral to Kant’s account, while Hume portrays the pursuit of\nvirtue in comparatively relaxed and genial terms. For this reason,\nHume seems far more comfortable with the bourgeois virtues integral to\nsuccessful participation in modern commercial and political society\n(cf. EPM 9.1.2). By contrast, Kant seems warier of society’s\ninfluence on the individual, more insistent on the need to resist the\npower of what Rousseau calls amour-propre. \nFor Hume, the concepts of virtue and vice apply primarily to character\ntraits or “mental qualities”, and secondarily to occurrent\nmotives and actions. According to Hume, a character trait is a virtue\nif, and only if, it “gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment\nof approbation” (EPM App. I.10). Vices, by contrast, are those\ntraits that generate a displeasing sentiment of disapproval.\nHume’s definition builds on his account of moral judgment, and\nit makes virtue dependent on the responses of a\n“judicious” spectator who contemplates things from a\ngeneral point of view. The trait of prudence, for example, is a virtue\nbecause it tends to be pleasing to such a spectator. As Hume\nputs it, the defining mark of a virtue is that it has the “power\nof producing love or pride” when surveyed from the general point\nof view (T 3.3.1.3). In other words, a trait is a virtue only insofar\nas it tends to provoke the moral sentiment of approval in a properly\nsituated spectator. If it did not tend to provoke this response, it\nwould not be a virtue. This marks a significant departure from\nAristotelian conceptions of virtue (Cohon 2008: 161). According to the\nlatter, a character trait’s goodness is a function of the role\nit plays in the agent’s own flourishing, which has nothing to do\nwith the responses of a spectator. Prudence, for example, is a virtue\nwhether or not it tends to provoke the pleasing sentiment of\napprobation in an outside observer, however “judicious”\nshe may be. \nHume discusses a capacious catalogue of particular virtues and vices.\nHis account in the Treatise is organized around the\ndistinction between “natural” and “artificial”\nvirtues, which is easily misunderstood. The question is not whether\nsome virtues are fake or phony and others are authentic. The question\nis whether some depend on social rules and conventions and others do\nnot. Organizing his catalogue by means of this distinction allows Hume\nto steer a middle path between those who see morality as entirely\nconventional (e.g., Bernard Mandeville) and those who believe it\nsprings directly from features of human nature that exist\nindependently of social convention (e.g., Francis Hutcheson).\nAccording to Hume, some virtues do depend on social convention but\nothers do not (Cohon 2008: 162–163). In both cases, he seeks to\nexplain why people tend to develop such traits and why they tend to be\npleasing to judicious spectators. Hume drops the artificial-natural\ndistinction from the second Enquiry, but his investigations\nthere are motivated by the same questions and the resulting view also\nsteers a middle course between Mandeville and Hutcheson. \nAccording to the Treatise, artificial virtues include\njustice, fidelity to promises, allegiance to government, and chastity.\nHume devotes much discussion to justice, which he treats as a\nparamount and paradigmatic artificial virtue. Hume understands justice\nprimarily as honesty with respect to property or conformity to\nconventions of property (T 3.2.2.28). Establishing a system of\nproperty allows us to avoid conflict and enjoy the possession and use\nof various goods, so the social value of conventions involving\nproperty seems obvious. Yet one reason that justice receives such\nattention from Hume is that it poses a problem about moral motivation\nand moral approval. Hume claims that there needs to be a natural\n(non-moral) motive for morally good actions, for otherwise they could\nonly be done because they are morally good; and that would be\ncircular, since our judgment of acts as morally good reflects our\napproval of the motives and traits that give rise to the acts in\nquestion (T 3.2.1.7, 3.2.1.17). But this position makes it hard to see\nhow justice can be a virtue; for it is hard to find the requisite\nnatural, nonmoral motive for it. Self-interest is the natural motive\nthat justifies our establishing rules regarding property (T 3.2.2.24);\nbut self-interest is neither always satisfied by just acts, nor\napproved in the way that traits we call virtues generally are (T\n3.2.1.9–10). Neither public nor private benevolence would do,\nsince neither could motivate all just actions (T 3.2.1.12). Hume\nhimself says that “a sympathy with public interest\nis the source of the moral approbation, which attends that\nvirtue” (T 3.2.2.24). But since sympathy with the public\ninterest itself seems neither nonmoral nor inherent in human nature,\nthis claim redescribes the problem rather than solves it. Hume must\nground sympathy for the public interest in more obviously natural\nsentiments, and explain its development from them (e.g., as\nself-interest, corrected or redirected through education or the\ncontrivances of politicians). Otherwise, Hume must abandon his claim\nthat all morally good actions—even those associated with\nartificial virtues—have non-moral, natural motives. (See\nGauthier 1979; Mackie 1980: ch. 5; and Darwall 1995:\n302–316.) \nAmong the natural virtues, Hume includes beneficence, prudence,\ntemperance, frugality, industry, assiduity, enterprise, dexterity,\ngenerosity, and humanity (T 3.3.1.24). In the second Enquiry,\nhe distinguishes among virtues useful to others, virtues useful to\noneself, virtues immediately agreeable to oneself, and virtues\nimmediately agreeable to others. Among qualities useful to others are\njustice, fidelity, honor, allegiance, chastity, along with the other\n“social virtues” of humanity, generosity, charity,\naffability, lenity, mercy, and moderation (EPM 5.2.44). Among\nqualities useful to ourselves are discretion, caution, enterprise,\nindustry, assiduity, frugality, economy, good sense, prudence,\ndiscernment (EPM 6.1.21). Among qualities contrary to our own\nwell-being are indolence, negligence, “want of order and\nmethod”, obstinacy, fickleness, rashness, and credulity (EPM\n6.1.1). Qualities immediately agreeable to oneself include\ncheerfulness, tranquility, benevolence, and delicacy of taste.\nQualities immediately agreeable to others include good manners,\npoliteness, wit, ingenuity, decency, cleanliness, and a graceful or\ngenteel manner. What holds all these varied traits together as virtues\nis their evoking the sentiment of approval in spectators, itself\ngrounded in sympathy. \nLike Hume, Kant takes virtue to be central to human morality. But his\nbasic conception of virtue differs from Hume’s, as does his\ncatalogue of particular virtues and vices. According to Kant, virtue\nis the form in which a being with an imperfect or non-holy will\nexpresses her supreme commitment to morality. Virtue is such a\nbeing’s continually cultivated capacity to master her\ninclinations so as to fulfill her duties; a capacity whose cultivation\nand exercise is motivated by respect for the moral law (Denis 2006;\nBaxley 2010). Several related claims are integral to Kant’s\nview. First, virtue is a general disposition to do one’s duty\nout of respect for the moral law (CPrR 5:128, 160; C 27:300). Second,\nvirtue is a kind of strength. More specifically, virtue is “a\nmoral strength of the will” (MM 6:405) or “moral strength\nin adherence to one’s duty” (Ant 7:147). Third, virtue\npresupposes opposition and entails internal struggle. Kant often seems\nto identify our inclinations as the primary opponents of morality (G:\n4:405; V 27:450, 492; C 27:450). His considered view, however, is that\ninclinations are not the source of the problem. Virtue’s primary\nopponent is “radical evil in human nature”—a\npropensity to adopt maxims that prioritize self-love (and inclinations\ngenerally) over the moral law (Rel 6:29, 35–37, 57 n., 58). It\nis because of radical evil that virtue implies struggle and demands\nstrength. The fundamental task of the virtuous person is to achieve\nthe proper ordering of her incentives, giving the moral law undisputed\npriority over self-love. Finally, virtue is moral self-constraint\n“based on inner freedom” (MM 6:408), which is the capacity\nto act on the autonomously chosen principles of morality, even in the\nface of temptation (MM 6:394, 405). Virtue both expresses and promotes\ninner freedom. The greater one’s moral self-constraint, the more\none acts based on reason, and the less one acts based on inclination\nor impulse (MM 6:382 n). \nKant’s catalogue of virtues and vices is organized by his system\nof duties. These duties are grounded in the moral law, the supreme\nprinciple of morality, which impresses itself on imperfect, finite\nrational beings like us as a categorical imperative. Whatever duties\nwe have must ultimately derive from this supreme moral principle. But\nin the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant’s discussion of\nparticular duties of virtue is based more directly on what he calls\nthe “supreme principle of the doctrine of virtue”. This\nprinciple enjoins us to “act in accordance with a maxim of\nends that it can be a universal law for everyone to\nhave” (MM 6:395). As Kant explains,  \nIn accordance with this principle a human being is an end for himself\nas well as for others, and it is not enough that he is not authorized\nto use either himself or others merely as a means (since he could then\nstill be indifferent to them); it is in itself his duty to make the\nhuman being as such his end. (MM 6:395)  \nDuties of virtue have fundamentally to do with the ends, principles,\nand attitudes of agents; they aim to protect each agent’s inner\nfreedom; they can be compelled only by the agent herself. It is\nbecause duties of virtue alone are subject only to internal compulsion\nthat Kant calls them “directly ethical duties”. Among\nthese duties are the perfect duties to oneself to avoid vices of\nsuicide, self-mutilation, gluttony, drunkenness, sexual\nself-degradation (duties to oneself as an animal and moral being),\nlying, avarice, and servility (duties to oneself as a moral being\nonly); the imperfect duties to oneself concerning the promotion of the\nobligatory end of one’s own natural and moral perfection, along\nwith duties to foster self-knowledge, compassion for animals, and\nappreciation of the beautiful in nature; the perfect duties to others\nto avoid the vices of arrogance, defamation, and ridicule (duties of\nrespect), and the imperfect duties to promote the end of others\nhappiness by means of beneficence, sympathy, and gratitude, as well as\nby avoiding malice, envy, and ingratitude (duties of love and vices\nopposed to them). Kant does not claim to derive these duties from the\ncategorical imperative or the supreme principle of virtue alone.\nRather, in moving from general principles of morality to moral duties,\nhe draws on a variety of considerations regarding human nature and\nother aspects of the natural world. \nHume and Kant share a number of influences, so we should not be\nsurprised to see areas of overlap. First, like most eighteenth century\nphilosophers, both regard the pursuit of virtue as central to human\nmorality. Second, Kant shares Hume’s rejection of both\nHobbes’s psychological egoism and Hutcheson’s reduction of\nall virtues to the sentiment of benevolence. Third, Hume and Kant both\naccept of versions of Grotius’s distinction between perfect and\nimperfect duties, though they do not incorporate this distinction into\ntheir theories in the same way (see Schneewind 1990). Fourth, their\nrespective conceptions of virtue are secular by historical standards.\nNeither recognizes duties to God, for example, and neither counts\npiety or hope among the virtues. Kant also seems to agree with, and\nperhaps to have been influenced by, much of what Hume says about the\n“monkish virtues”. He follows Hume in rejecting fasting,\nself-flagellation, mortification of the flesh and other forms of\nphysical self-chastisement and self-abasement as false virtues. Kant\ncondemns such attempts at  \nweakening and removing all the body’s sensuality, to renounce\neverything that its sensuous enjoyment promotes, so that thereby the\nanimal nature of the body would be suppressed  \nas contrary to proper care for the body; such care requires\ndiscipline, but also  \ninvolves trying to promote its vigor, activity, strength, and courage.\n(C 27:379–80) \nYet there are striking and important differences between their views.\nHume defines virtue in terms of the moral sentiments of a properly\nsituated judicious spectator, and his definition makes virtue and vice\ndependent on such responses. Kant, by contrast, defines virtue in\nterms of duty, obligation, and law. Virtue is thought of as moral\nstrength, which is measured by an agent’s ability to defeat\nthose inclinations that oppose the demands of the moral law (MM\n6:405–407). Hume’s theory of virtue has a place for duty\nand law, but these are not the fundamental concepts in terms of which\neverything else must be explained or justified. Moreover, Hume\ncertainly recognizes individual virtues such as strength of mind,\nfortitude, and courage; but they are not central to his view of virtue\nas such, and their status as virtues depends on the moral sentiments\nof a judicious spectator, as well as the exigencies and social\nconventions of a particular age (EPM “A\nDialogue”.40)—both of which Kant takes to be irrelevant.\nVirtue for Kant is defined in terms of the law, and neither the\nlaw’s normative status nor its psychological weight rests on\nmoral sentiments or social convention. \nA few additional differences are worth noting. First, both\nphilosophers recognize and discuss a plurality of virtues and vices.\nBut, unlike Hume, Kant insists on the unitary nature of virtue:\n“in its Idea (objectively) there is only one virtue (as\nmoral strength of one’s maxims)” (MM 6:447; cf. MM 6:395\nand 406). Second, Hume casts a much wider net with regard to the\nqualities that count as virtues. The concepts of virtue and vice can\napply to things outside our control, such as traits and motives that\nspring involuntarily from our basic temperament. Kant, by contrast,\nrestricts the application of these concepts to traits, behaviors, and\nattitudes that are voluntarily adopted and cultivated as a matter of\nprinciple. For Kant each virtue and each vice has its own maxim (MM\n6:404). This would be true even of wit or good memory, for example.\nWit and good memory are certainly things that an agent might cultivate\nfor the sake of her natural perfection. But for these traits to be\nconsidered Kantian virtues would require at least an agent’s\nmorally grounded interest in and cultivation of them. But for Hume the\nagent’s reasons and her degree of voluntary control are\nirrelevant. Wit, good memory, and other “natural\nabilities” are virtues because of their power to please a\nproperly situated spectator, even if they spring directly from a\nnatural temperament over which the agent has no control (T\n3.3.4.1–5). A third important contrast concerns justice. Justice\nis an immensely significant virtue for Hume, but is not treated by\nKant as a virtue at all. For Kant, justice has primarily to do with\none’s external treatment of others. As long as one does not\nhinder their freedom in a way that violates universal law or\nlegitimate positive law, one complies with the demands of justice.\nOne’s motive or attitude is irrelevant from the standpoint of\njustice. It is a matter not of justice itself, but of ethics, if one\nrespects the rights of others not from fear of punishment but from\nrespect for persons or law. The moral worth adhering to acting rightly\nout of respect for right is not part of justice, but of ethics; it is\na matter of self-constraint or virtue. Hume’s treatment of\njustice reflects his distinction between artificial and natural\nvirtues, but Kant would reject this distinction altogether. None of\nthe virtues is either “artificial” or\n“natural” in Hume’s sense since none of them depends\non social convention and none of them springs directly from human\nnature. Finally, their conceptions of moral vice are quite different.\nFor Hume a vice is a mental quality that provokes disapproval from a\njudicious spectator. A person’s vices do not necessarily say\nanything about the quality of her will as a whole or her fundamental\nattitude toward the demands of morality. But Kant holds that vice is a\npropensity to act contrary to the moral law (Rel 6:37), and it implies\na principled “contempt for moral laws” (C\n27:463). As he puts it, “it is when an intentional transgression\nhas become a principle that it is properly called a\nvice” (MM 6:390). \nHume and Kant both believe that freedom is essential to morality.\nMoreover, both believe that a philosophical theory and vindication of\nhuman morality requires reconciling freedom with universal causal\nnecessity (determinism). However, they offer different conceptions of\nfreedom, different ways of reconciling it with necessity, and\ndifferent ways of understanding why this reconciliation matters for\nmorality. Scholars agree that Hume is a “compatibilist”,\nbut there is no consensus on the correct label for Kant’s\nposition. \nHume defends compatibilism in section eight of Enquiry concerning\nHuman Understanding and Book Two of the Treatise\n(2.3.1–2). In the Treatise, Hume distinguishes between\ntwo conceptions of freedom or liberty: “liberty of\nindifference” and “liberty of spontaneity”.\nAccording to the idea of indifference, liberty implies “a\nnegation of necessity and causes” (T 2.3.2.1). For illustration,\nconsider the Anglican bishop John Bramhall’s claim that genuine\nliberty is “a liberty from necessity, or rather from\nnecessitation, that is, a universal immunity from all inevitability\nand determination” (1645 [1999: 1]). On this view, a person is\nfree when, and only when, her action is not necessitated by\nany antecedent causes. Hume rejects this idea as\nunintelligible (T 2.3.1.18) and destructive to morality and religion\n(T 2.3.2.5). By contrast, he characterizes spontaneity as that idea of\nliberty “which is oppos’d to violence” (T 2.3.2.1).\nSo the liberty of spontaneity is freedom from violence, but not\nfreedom from necessity per se. “Violence” here\nrefers to various forms of unwanted interference with the execution of\none’s will, as when a person is forced to sign a document or\nlocked in a cell from which she wants to escape. These are cases where\nwe lack the liberty of spontaneity. But a person has such liberty\nwhenever she is able to do what she wants to do. In such cases, her\nactions are causally necessitated, just like any other event in\nnature; but they are caused by motives that spring from her own\ncharacter. According to Hume, this is the form of liberty at issue in\nreligion, morality, law, and common life. Hence, spontaneity is the\nonly form of liberty “which it concerns us to preserve” (T\n2.3.2.1). \nThe liberty of spontaneity, as just described, is perfectly compatible\nwith causal necessity. There are two main reasons people often believe\notherwise. First, we tend to conflate the two ideas of liberty. In\ncases where we enjoy the liberty of spontaneity, our experience\nsuggests that we also enjoy something more. We recognize, of course,\nthat “we were influenc’d by particular views and\nmotives”, yet we find it difficult to “perswade ourselves\nwe govern’d by necessity, and that ’twas utterly\nimpossible for us to have acted otherwise” (T 2.3.2.1). This is\nbecause “[w]e feel that our actions are subject to our will on\nmost occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to\nnothing” (T 2.3.2.2). Yet this is a mistake explained by the\nblind spots of introspection. An outside observer, whether a friend or\na scientist,  \ncan commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and\neven where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he\nperfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and\ntemper. (T 2.3.2.2)  \nThe second source of resistance to compatibilism stems from confusion\nabout necessity. People are prone to think that necessity rules out\nliberty because they conflate necessity with compulsion or force. They\nbelieve that when A causes B, A compels or forces B. Hume holds that\nthis is a mistake, however. Causal necessity is nothing more than the\n“constant conjunction” of similar objects and a customary\ninference of the mind from the one to the other (EHU 8.1.5). For\nexample, experience shows that the vibration of a particular string is\nconstantly conjoined with a particular sound. As a result, the mind\ndevelops the habit of immediately inferring the sound from the\nvibration (EHU 7.2.29). We believe that the sound is causally\nnecessitated by the vibration, but the necessity is a product of the\nimagination, which associates the idea of the sound with the\nperception of the vibration. This feeling that there is a\nnecessary connection between them is the whole of the matter (EHU\n7.2.28). So defined, causal necessity no longer poses an obvious\nthreat to liberty. It makes sense to follow Bramhall’s\ndefinition of liberty as “liberty from necessity” if one\nthinks that necessitation involves force or compulsion. But causes do\nnot force or compel their effects. If one can accept this point, then\na definition like Bramhall’s seems less tempting, and necessity\nper se no longer poses a threat to liberty. The only real\nthreat is necessitation by external forces, as when a person is forced\nto do something she does not want to do. \nBroadly speaking, the scholarship offers two ways of interpreting\nHume’s compatibilism. According to the most common approach,\nHume’s arguments concern the logic of the concepts at issue. On\nthis reading, Hume analyzes the concepts of liberty and necessity in\norder to show that, properly understood, they do not conflict. We can\nbe rationally justified in holding a person responsible for her action\neven though all human actions are caused. The only question is whether\nshe, rather than some other person or external force, is the\ncause of her action. According to Paul Russell’s naturalist\napproach, however, Hume’s view is not primarily a piece of a\npriori reasoning about the logic of our concepts or the rational\njustification of attributions of moral responsibility. Above all it is\nan empirical explanation for why we sometimes feel that people are\nresponsible for their conduct. Hume’s concern is with the\ncognitive processes that cause such attributions (Russell 1995: ch.\n4). He starts with the\noccasions in common life when we hold people responsible for their\nbehavior, and then asks, what happens in the mind on such occasions?\nOn the standard reading, Hume’s treatment of liberty is a fairly\nself-contained set of compatibilist arguments, easily detached from\nhis larger project. On the naturalist reading, it is deeply connected\nto his theory of the passions and moral judgment, which makes it an\nintegral part of his “science of man”. \nHume claims that liberty, understood properly, is “essential to\nmorality” (EHU 8.31). The above interpretations provide two\ndifferent explanations for why this is the case. The standard approach\nsays that Hume’s compatibilism is about the logic of our\nconcepts and the justification of our judgments. Our judgments about\nresponsibility entail judgments about the causal antecedents of\naction, and such judgments are consistent with determinism. On this\nview, the liberty of spontaneity is essential to morality because\nattributions of responsibility, which permeate morality (as well as\nlaw and religion), are unjust and unreasonable without it. According\nto the naturalist approach, liberty is essential for a different\nreason. The naturalist reading emphasizes that, on Hume’s view,\nattributions of responsibility are made via feelings of\napproval and disapproval, not judgments (T 2.3.2.6; Russell 1995:\n60–4). They are, in\nhis terminology, impressions or sentiments rather than ideas. These\nsentiments are partially caused by beliefs about the source of the\nbehavior to which we are responding. We would not feel approval or\ndisapproval unless we had been led to think of the person as the cause\nof the action. If we believed that her action was either compelled or\nuncaused, we would neither approve nor disapprove of her. Our\nresponses or thoughts would be about something else. Hume’s\nclaim, on the naturalist reading, is that in approving or disapproving\nof the agent—in feeling gratitude or resentment, for\nexample—we hold her responsible, and in holding her responsible\nwe believe that her conduct is free. Hume does not argue that the\nlatter justifies attributions of responsibility. His claim is that it\ncausally contributes to such attributions. They are made by means of\nfeelings of approval and disapproval, which are are a core feature of\nhuman morality as we know it. Therefore, the idea of liberty, properly\nreconciled with necessity, is essential to morality.  Like Hume, Kant seeks to reconcile freedom with a commitment to\ncausal determinism. Yet the two philosophers operate with different\nconceptions of causal necessity and very different ideas about the\nnature of freedom. For present purposes, it is important to focus on\nthe main difference between their conceptions of freedom. Hume\nconcentrates on the liberty of spontaneity, the only idea of freedom\n“which it concerns us to preserve”. His treatment looks\ndownstream from the will to its execution in action. A person has\nliberty when her action is caused by her will, which Hume equates with\nan occurrent motive or desire (T 2.3.1.2). The question of what\nultimately moves the will is irrelevant. Such causes are found in the\nperson’s character and circumstances, and they determine her\nwill with the same necessity that determines everything else in\nnature. Kant, by contrast, looks upstream to what determines the will:\n“It is here a question only of the determination of the will and\nof the determining ground of its maxims as a free will, not of its\nresult” in bodily action (CPrR 5:45). One way of putting it is\nto say that Hume’s account concerns the freedom of action, while\nKant’s concerns freedom of the will. Both are concerned with the\nfreedom of the person or agent, but Kant thinks the person is not\ntruly free unless her will is free. This is the first point about the\nmain difference between Kant and Hume. \nThe second point is that Kant, unlike Hume, believes that the will is\nnot free unless it can be determined by pure reason. This is why he\nrepeatedly insists that the main question concerning freedom is\nwhether pure reason “can be an immediate determining ground of\nthe will, that is, of the causality of a rational being with respect\nto the reality of objects” (CPrR 5:44–45). Furthermore,\nKant holds that this is a question of whether the will can be\ndetermined “independently of anything empirical” (CPrR\n5:42). For when pure reason determines the will, the latter’s\n“ground” must be found in “the intelligible order of\nthings” rather than in empirical order (CPrR 5:49). This is why\nKant thinks that “the concept of a being that has free\nwill” involves the concept of a “noumenal” cause\n(CPrR 5:55). Note that this is not obviously equivalent to what Hume\ncalls the liberty of indifference, which implies a complete absence of\ncauses or necessitation. Free will, on Kant’s view, is not quite\nwhat Bramhall calls “liberty from necessitation”. On the\ncontrary, Kant seems to think that the will is free if, and only if,\nit is necessitated. But it must be necessitated by the right\nsort of thing and in the right way: namely, by pure reason rather than\nby an antecedent event whose causal impact on the will could be\ndescribed by an empirical law. That is, the will is free if and only\nif can be determined by pure reason, which lies outside the realm\ngoverned by empirical laws. \nThis conception of freedom has profound implications for the task of\nreconciling freedom with causal determinism. Kant maintains that all\nevents, including human actions, are causally determined by antecedent\nevents in accordance with empirical laws. But he also seeks to show\nthat this does not rule out free will (A536–537/B564-565). On\nthe contrary, one and the same event can be both “a mere effect\nof nature” but also an “effect of freedom”\n(A543/B571). Kant demonstrates this possibility by distinguishing\nbetween two different “worlds” and arguing that we belong\nto both. On the one hand, we belong to the “phenomenal”\nworld, where all our actions can be explained in terms of antecedent\nevents (whether physical or psychological). On the other hand,\nconsidered as a “thing in itself”, each of us belongs to\nthe “noumenal” world, which is not subject to “the\ntemporal order in accord with empirical laws” (A534/B562). We\ncannot know whether we actually belong to the noumenal world,\nbut Kant’s theoretical philosophy secures room for this\npossibility, and his moral philosophy tries to show that when we\nbecome aware of morality’s categorical demands, we think of\nourselves as members of this noumenal or “intelligible\nworld” (G 4:457-58). With this line of thought, Kant seeks to\nreconcile freedom and natural necessity by means of his transcendental\nidealism. Indeed, the question of whether natural necessity rules out\nfreedom is a “transcendental problem” and only\ntranscendental philosophy can solve it (A535/B563, A557/B585). The\nappeal to transcendental idealism is controversial, of course. Some\nscholars of Kant’s ethics understand him to be making a\nmetaphysical (or ontological) claim when he distinguishes between\nnoumenal and phenomenal worlds (e.g. McCarty 2009). Others understand\nKant to be distinguishing between only different standpoints we take,\nidentifying the noumenal world with the practical standpoint that we\ntake when we think of ourselves as autonomous, responsible beings, and\nthe phenomenal world with the theoretical standpoint we take when we\nthink of ourselves as part of the natural, deterministic, empirical\nworld (see Beck 1960: 191–94; Korsgaard 1996a, esp. chs.\n6–7). There are concerns about both. Many find the notion of two\nworlds metaphysically cumbersome; but others question whether the two\nstandpoints approach is adequate for transcendental and practical\nfreedom. (See Irwin 1984, esp. 37–38; Allison 1990; Guyer 1992:\n103–107; and Wood 2005a: 99–100.) \nKant has a number of reasons for thinking that freedom is essential to\nmorality. First, freedom is necessary for moral responsibility. When\nwe hold a person responsible for blameworthy conduct, for example, we\n“impute” the ability to have refrained from such conduct\nand blame the person for her failure to exercise this ability\nproperly. The judgment of “blame is grounded on the law of\nreason, which regards reason as a cause that… could have and\nought to have determined the conduct of the person to be other than it\nis” (A555/B583). Second, Kant holds that “what is\nessential to any moral worth of actions is that the moral law\ndetermine the will immediately” (CPrR 5:71). If a\nperson’s will were necessitated by her circumstances and\nempirical character, as Hume maintains, it would be impossible to\nrespond properly to the moral law, which demands a kind of purity of\nthought and motive that Hume would not countenance. Third, freedom is\nessential to morality in that freedom is the ground of a special\nstatus or “dignity” that morality commands us to respect\nin ourselves and others. One important but unorthodox line of\ninterpretation suggests a fourth reason for thinking that freedom is\nessential to morality. According to this view, Kant holds (in at least\nsome places) that freedom is our most fundamental value, the source\nfrom which all other moral value derives. This is “the real\nbedrock of Kant’s moral thought” (Guyer 2000: 203). On\nthis view, in fact, we are commanded to obey the moral law because it\n“is the necessary means for the realization of human\nfreedom” (Guyer 2016: 38). \nWhen comparing Hume and Kant, it is a mistake to ask simply which\nphilosopher has the best account of freedom or does the best job of\nreconciling freedom and necessity. They disagree about both causal\nnecessity and the question of which idea of freedom “it concerns\nus to preserve”. As a result, they focus on somewhat different\ntopics. Hume concentrates on what happens downstream from the will,\nthat is, on how motives determine action. But Kant’s attention\nis focused on what happens upstream—on the question of what\ndetermines the will. It seems fair to say that from Kant’s\nperspective, Hume’s notion of liberty is thin gruel, no better\nthan “the freedom of a turnspit” (CPrR 5:97) or the\nfreedom exhibited by a self-moving clock (CPrR 5:96). It also seems\nfair to say that from Hume’s perspective, Kant’s notion of\nfree will looks, at best, like a misguided fiction. One important\nquestion is whether morality requires the sort of freedom Kant has in\nmind. Hume would deny that it does, but this is partly because his\nview of morality itself is so different from Kant’s. The issue\nhere is not just about free will. It is about which conception of\nmorality is most plausible. If Kant has convincing grounds for\ninsisting on the unique nature of moral obligation or judgments of\n“moral worth”, this puts some pressure on Hume to take\nKant’s notion of free will more seriously. Another important\nquestion is how to interpret Kant’s actual position, which is\nthe subject of controversy. Standard textbooks classify Kant as a\nlibertarian (incompatibilist) about free will, but those who study\nKant most intensively often disagree about the nature of his view.\nSome argue that Kant offers a form of incompatibilism (e.g., Pereboom\n2006; Allison 1990; Watkins 2005), while others maintain that he is some sort of\ncompatibilist, however unorthodox (e.g., Bennett 1984; Hudson 1994).\nAccording to one very influential interpretation, Kant endorses\n“not only the compatibility of freedom and determinism, but also\nthe compatibility of compatibilism and incompatibilism” (Wood\n1984: 74). These scholarly debates bear on the question of how\nKant’s view compares to Hume’s, as does the question of\nwhether the naturalist or traditional interpretation best captures\nHume’s own position. Finally, when comparing Kant and Hume on\nthe question of freedom, one must recognize that there is a modest and\nskeptical side to Kant’s view that Hume would applaud. For Kant,\nfree will is an “inscrutable faculty” (CPrR 5:47), whose\noperations lie beyond the reach of human cognition. It is impossible\nto know whether we actually have free will (CPrR 5:72; G\n4:459). Indeed, Kant’s significant debt to Hume is evident in\nhis claim that “all human insight is at an end as soon as we\nhave arrived at basic powers or basic faculties” (CPrR\n5:46). \nReflections on religion and concern with religious themes can be found\nin the majority of Hume’s and Kant’s major works. Their\ntreatments of the subject differ significantly, but they have a few\nimportant things in common, especially on the question of how religion\nrelates to morality. Above all, both philosophers advocate a\nsecularized approach to moral philosophy. That is, both argue for the\nindependence of morality from religion and the importance of keeping\nthe two distinct. They both express deep concern about the corrupting\ninfluence of false religion, including “enthusiasm” and\n“superstition”. And they both seek to undermine a good\ndeal of Christian theology, including traditional arguments for the\nexistence of God. There are also important areas of disagreement,\nhowever. Generally speaking, Hume is far more alert to\nreligion’s potential costs, such as intolerance, violence, and\ndistraction from whatever happiness is available in this life. Kant,\nby contrast, seems far more attuned to the benefits of religion,\nespecially its attempts to address the perhaps unavoidable need for\nultimate answers or consolation in the face of death and\nsuffering.  On Hume’s view, the foundation of morality has nothing to do\nwith God. This is evident from his distinctive version of\nsentimentalism. He argues that morality, much like our aesthetic\nresponses to beauty, is “founded entirely on the peculiar fabric\nand constitution of the human species” (EPM 1.3). This claim is\nmade in the context of arguing against a form of moral rationalism\nthat locates the foundation of morality in immutable truths\ndiscoverable by reason (Schneewind 2010). Against rationalists like\nSamuel Clarke, Hume claims that morality is a distinctly and entirely\nhuman phenomenon; there are no grounds for believing that human beings\nexist in any kind of moral community with God or that God is\nanswerable to the moral norms that bind us (Schneewind 2010). For\npresent purposes, there are two additional points to\nappreciate. First, Hume’s claim entails a rejection of the idea\nthat moral distinctions between good and evil are instituted by divine\ncommand, as argued by voluntarists such as Pufendorf, Luther, or\nCalvin. Second, Hume’s version of the above claim differs from\nthe version found in Hutcheson. On Hutcheson’s view, human\nnature is essentially good and its goodness reflects the wisdom and\nbenevolence of God. When we behave virtuously, we further the purposes\nfor which we were created. Hume, by contrast, rejects\nHutcheson’s equation of the natural with the good (T 3.1.2.10),\nand he rejects his predecessor’s underlying teleology (Gill\n2006: 194–208). \nHume frequently draws attention to the moral and political costs of\nreligion. He never argues that religion is inherently destructive, but\nhe consistently claims that it tends to distort and corrupt morality.\nWere it not for religion’s influence, Hume claims, we would\nnever approve of qualities such as “celibacy, fasting, penance,\nmortification, self-denial, humility, silence, solitude, and the whole\ntrain of monkish virtues” (EPM 9.1.3). The “delusive\nglosses of superstition and false religion” can cause us to\napprove of such qualities despite the fact that they are neither\nuseful nor agreeable (EPM 9.1.3). Similarly, Hume emphasizes the\ndifference between moral and religious sources of motivation. When a\nperson pays a debt or restores a loan, for example,  \nhis divinity is nowise beholden to him; because these acts of justice\nare what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed,\nwere there no god in the universe. But if he fast a day, or give\nhimself a sound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion,\nto the service of God. No other motive could engage him to such\nausterities. (NHR 14.6)  \nHume often blames these distortions of morality on particular\nforms of Christianity, such as Catholicism and sectarian\noffshoots of Calvinism and Lutheranism. But in some places Hume comes\nclose to faulting any religion that represents\nGod as “infinitely superior to mankind” (NHR 10.2),\narguing that, “[t]he more tremendous the divinity is\nrepresented, the more tame and submissive do men become to his\nministers” (NHR 14.8). He clearly believes that monotheistic\nreligions tend to focus human attention on the one God rather than on\nthe enjoyment of life on earth. Monotheism also tends to promote\nintolerance, factionalism, and even violence. \nLike Hume, Kant holds that the foundation of morality is independent\nof religion. The main difference between them is that Hume locates\nthat foundation in human nature, while Kant —depending on the\ninterpretation—locates it in the structure of practical reason,\nthe nature of rational beings, or the supreme value of freedom. On\nKant’s view, morality is not only independent of religion; it is\nalso more fundamental. One way that he gives priority to morality is\nby arguing that belief in God follows from a moral commitment, and\ndenying that recognition of the moral law follows from or must be\ngrounded in recognition of God’s authority. A second way in\nwhich Kant treats morality as fundamental is by denying that we have\nany duties to God. All that God commands us to do is what morality\nrequires: our duties to ourselves and others. A third point is that\nKant insists that children not be taught about religion until they are\nfamiliar with basic moral concepts and principles; otherwise, they may\nthink, for example, that the reason one should act rightly is to hope\nfor God’s favor and to avoid God’s punishment. He argues\nthat Christianity is superior to other ecclesiastical faiths because\nof the centrality of ethics within it from its inception (Rel 6:167).\nBut all ecclesiastical faiths are liable to corruption, and none is\nthe ideal form for religion to take. Ideally, we will dispense with\ndistinct ecclesiastical faiths, along with their revealed texts and\ndoctrinal statutes and observances, in favor of a universal, pure\nreligion of reason, dedicated to morality. \nWhile Kant holds that morality’s foundation is independent of\nreligion, the two are more closely connected for him than they are for\nHume. Compared with Hume, Kant is far less antagonistic to religion,\nand he consistently tries to preserve a place for religious belief\nwithin the strictures of his moral philosophy. Indeed, this is an\nimportant aspect of his approach to morality. Kant’s\n“moral theism” is one of his most significant\ncontributions to the philosophy of religion and the question of\nreligion’s relation to morality. Moral theism is belief in God\nfounded on morality. By belief (or faith) [Glaube], Kant\nmeans something different from knowledge [Wissen] (A 822/B\n850; WOT 8:140–41). Believing and knowing both involve holding\nsomething to be true. When one knows something, one holds it to be\ntrue on grounds that are “subjectively and objectively”\nsufficient, whereas when one believes something, one holds it to be\ntrue on grounds that are subjectively but not objectively sufficient\n(A 822/B 850). Here, Kant takes objective sufficiency to imply valid\ntheoretical grounds, such as evidence or theoretical argument; he\ntakes subjective sufficiency, by contrast, to imply valid practical\ngrounds. Thus, belief entails having valid practical reasons for\nholding something to be true, while lacking valid theoretical reasons\nfor doing so. Indeed, when it comes to belief in God, Kant does not\nthink that knowledge is possible (CPJ 5:471–72). \nKant’s position contains a distinctly moral conception of God.\nIn addition to the attributes of omniscience, omnipresence, and\nomnipotence, he ascribes to God the moral attributes of holiness,\nbenevolence, and justice (LPDR 28:1073–74). God is not only\nauthor and executor of the moral law, but also as its\n“personification” (C 27:322; V 27:530, 723; LPDR 28:1076,\n1091). Kant says that all moral requirements can be seen as divine\ncommands (CPrR 5:129; Rel 6:153). God knows and cares about our virtue\nand well-being. In particular, he cares about the realization of the\nhighest good, in which people attain maximal virtue and, consequently,\nmaximal happiness. This is a God who has created the world, has\nincorporated morality into the world, and has a moral plan for the\nworld (CPrR 5:125; CPJ 5:450). Belief in God allows us to retain our\nfaith that some of our moral actions will produce the intended good\nconsequences, and that if we strive our best to promote the highest\ngood, God will complete the task (C 27:310, 321–22; CPJ\n5:450–53; Rel 6:74–77, 192, 201–202). \nThe relation between God and the highest good is the basis of\nKant’s main argument for belief in God. (See Wood 1970.) The\nargument, most clearly articulated in the Critique of Practical\nReason, goes like this (CPrR 5:110–14, 124–46). The\nmoral law issues categorical demands through each agent’s own\nreason. If the moral law sets forth an end for us to promote, we must\npromote it. For our promotion of this end to be rational, the end must\nbe one that we can rationally view as possible for us to promote\nthrough our own agency. The moral law gives rise to the highest good\n(i.e., virtue and conditioned, proportionate happiness), as practical\nreason’s ultimate end. Thus, we must promote it. Yet it is not\nclear that we are capable of effecting the highest good, given the\nlimitations of our agency and the conditions and workings of the\nnatural world. If the realization of the highest good is not possible,\nhowever, then we cannot rationally promote it as an end; indeed, we\ncannot even make sense of it as an end. But if we do not promote the\nhighest good, we flout the moral law. Now, suppose that there were a\nsupreme, eternal, all powerful, all knowing ruler of the universe\n(i.e., God); he could bring to completion our imperfect strivings for\nthe highest good. Thus, if we postulate the existence of God, we can\nview the highest good as possible, and can rationally follow\nmorality’s command to promote it. There is no reason not to\npostulate God’s existence, since his non-existence cannot be\nproven, and since belief in him does not conflict with any necessary\nbeliefs (CPrR 5:135–43). In addition, since belief in God is\nnecessary for seeing the highest good as possible, we must believe in\nGod (CPrR 5:125–26, 142–46). Thus, belief in God is\ngrounded in the necessity of seeing the highest good as possible, and\nso for the rational compliance with morality. Thus, Kant says that\nbelief in God is morally necessary, and that morality leads\nineluctably to religion (CPrR 5:125). We do not, however, have a duty\nto believe in God. Postulating God’s existence is a theoretical\nexercise of reason, which cannot be morally commanded (CPrR 5:125,\n144). Rather, our duty to promote the highest good gives rise to\n“a need of reason” to assume the possibility of the\nhighest good. From this need emerges the necessity of postulating\nGod’s existence. \nKant’s practical argument differs profoundly from the\nspeculative arguments for God’s existence popular in\nKant’s day–i.e., ontological, cosmological, and\nphysiotheological proofs. His moral argument grounds the necessity of\nbelieving in God in each person’s practical reason, required to\n“orient ourselves in thinking” (WOT 8:136–37).\nAccording to Kant, belief in God is “a postulate of pure\npractical reason”: “a theoretical proposition which is not\nas such demonstrable, but which is an inseparable corollary of an a\npriori unconditionally valid practical law” (CPrR 5:122).\nAlthough practical arguments cannot provide knowledge of God’s\nexistence, they can provide “moral certainty” of\nGod’s existence (A 828–30/B 856–58; CPrR 5:134, 143;\nLPDR 28:1011–12). Such moral certainty is stronger than the sort\nof confidence one could obtain from any theoretical argument. \nHume’s influence on Kant regarding the intersection of religion\nand morality is evident, though difficult to measure. It is also hard\nto tell how much of the influence came directly from Hume’s\nwritings. Hume is not often cited regarding religion in Kant’s\nmajor works. Kant’s Lectures on the Philosophical Doctrine\nof Religion, however, suggest familiarity with Hume’s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion, a work which Kant\ncould have read in its entirety in 1781 (Wood 1978: 14–15), and\nperhaps in part when it first came out, since Hamann translated the\nfirst and last parts of it for him (Kuehn 2001: 121). Kant explicitly\ndiscusses Hume’s Dialogues in the section on the\nphysiotheological proof, which is what Kant calls the argument from\ndesign (see LPDR 28:1063–4). Furthermore, in the Danzig\nmanuscript of these lectures, Kant cites Hume within his argument\nagainst the cosmotheological proof (Ak 28:1266; Wood 1978: 83n31).\nKant was clearly also familiar with Hume’s The Natural\nHistory of Religion. In “A History of Natural Theology,\naccording to Meiners’ Historia doctrinae de uno vero\nDeo”, Kant refers briefly to Hume’s account of\npolytheists as tolerant in section 9 of The Natural History of\nReligion (LPDR 28:1125). \nFinally, it is interesting to note that many philosophers and other\nintellectuals in Königsberg in the late 1750s and early 1760s\nseem to have attributed to Hume a view of religion that has something\nsignificant in common with Kant’s mature view. Hamann and others\nsaw Hume’s skepticism as necessary for purging religion of its\npoor arguments and traditional associations, and clearing the way for\ntrue religion. One source for this view of Hume is the conclusion of\nbook I of the Treatise, which Hamann translated into German\n(with some alterations and excisions to hide its origin) and published\nanonymously in 1771 under the title “Night Thoughts of a\nSceptic” (Kuehn 2001: 198–201). Another source is the end\nof the Dialogues, where Philo says, “To be a\nphilosophical skeptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most\nessential step towards being a sound, believing Christian” (DR\n89). This statement is out of line with Philo’s previous\nassertions and arguments, and comes as a surprise at this point in the\nthe text. Some take Hume to be arguing here that once a person has\nrid themselves of philosophically suspect rational justifications for\nbelief in God, he is free to embrace religion based simply on faith.\nAt least this seems to be how Hamann interprets Hume. Kant, of course is no\nfideist, for he does not take a leap of faith based on revealed\nreligion to be the proper ground for belief in God. Still, Kant does\nendorse the notion that when one clears away the fallacious or at\nleast inadequate metaphysical arguments for the existence of God found\nin philosophical theology, one is able to see that morality itself\noffers an argument for God’s existence which both allows for\n(moral) certainty and addresses people in a moving, concrete way.","contact.mail":"ldenis@agnesscott.edu","contact.domain":"agnesscott.edu"}]
