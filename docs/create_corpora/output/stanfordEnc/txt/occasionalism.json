I\npush the keys on my keyboard, and letters appear on the screen.\nOutside the wind blows leaves across the patio. The ringing of the\nphone cuts short my idling thoughts.\n\n\nPhilosophers have long wondered about the nature of causality. Are\nthere true causes at work in the world, and, if so, what makes them\nthe causes they are? How do causes bring things about, and what kind\nof connection does a cause have to its effect? These questions took on\nanother level of complexity when various religious and theological\nconsiderations were brought to bear on these issues. For instance,\nphilosophers came to question how divine causal activity is to be\nunderstood, particularly, in relation to the natural causality of\ncreatures. It is from this context, in which questions about the\nnature of causation intermixed with questions about the relation\nbetween divine and natural causality, that occasionalism emerged.\nOccasionalism attempts to address these questions by presenting as its\ncore intuition the claim that, regardless of our common sense\ninclinations, God is the one and only true cause. In the words of the\nmost famous occasionalist of the Western philosophical tradition,\nNicolas Malebranche, “there is only one true cause because there\nis only one true God; … the nature or power of each thing is\nnothing but the will of God; … all natural causes are not\ntrue causes but only occasional causes”\n(OCM II, 312 / Search 448) A full-blown\noccasionalist, like Malebranche, then, might be described as one who\nsubscribes to the following two tenets: (1) the positive thesis that\nGod is the only genuine cause; (2) the negative thesis that no\ncreaturely cause is a genuine cause but at most an occasional cause.\nNot all philosophers who have been identified as occasionalists,\nhowever, were full-blown occasionalists in this sense, since some\nargued that only a limited subset of creatures lack causal powers, and\nthus affirmed the causal efficacy of other creatures. For these\noccasionalists, the two theses just stated above would be too strong,\nand they would subscribe instead to a weaker position along the\nfollowing lines: while God is the unique genuine cause in some\nrestricted domain, other genuine creaturely causes are operative in\nthe world, and not all creaturely causes are merely occasional\ncauses.\n\n\nGiven this diversity of positions, it might be helpful to characterize\noccasionalism as follows: one is an occasionalist for domain\nx iff one holds that God is the unique genuine cause within\ndomain x and other alleged causes within this domain are not\nreal causes but at most occasional causes. And by “domain”\nhere, we refer to the roughly defined set of alleged causal relations\nunder consideration, for instance, the domain of causal relations that\nhold between material or bodily substances. We will have more to say\nabout what an occasional cause is later on, but, at this point, on the\nbasis of the characterization of occasionalism just given, we might\nintroduce some terminology to refer to and differentiate the different\npossible positions among those who subscribe to some form of\noccasionalism. We will refer to the occasionalists who endorse the\nfull-blown version, along the lines of Malebranche, and take the\nnegative thesis that no creature cause is a genuine cause to apply\nacross the board to all finite substances as advocating “global\noccasionalism.” Global occasionalism, accordingly, holds that\nall creaturely causation is at most occasional, while divine causation\nis uniquely genuine. In contrast, those who are willing to endorse\nsome genuine causation on the part of creatures, hence restricting\noccasional causation to only a limited domain will be described as\nendorsing a form of “local occasionalism.” (Lee 2008) \n\n\nUnderstood in this manner, occasionalism can be understood as a\nmetaphysics of causation that suggests a more discriminating attitude\ntoward what are typically taken to be causal interactions operative in\nthis world. On this characterization, the occasionalist resists a\nunivocal understanding of these apparent causal interactions and\nidentifies two types of relations in the world, that of genuine\ncausation and that of occasional causation. In addition to this issue\nof the scope of occasionalism, we will, in the following sections,\nexamine how occasionalism addresses these issues aforementioned\nconcerning the relation between divine and natural causation, and what\narguments are presented in favor of occasionalism. We begin, however,\nwith a brief discussion about its history.\n\nThough the term “occasional cause” has been suggested as\noriginating with the French philosopher Louis de la Forge (Carraud\n2002, 347), the first philosophers to explicitly expound the position\nwere the Islamic occasionalists. Our brief discussion here will not be\nable to do justice to its complex and rich development, but Islamic\noccasionalism seems to have emerged when the theologians of the\nAsh‘arite school of kalām (Islamic doctrinal\ntheology) began to consider the implications of the systematic\nreinterpretation, development, and integration of Aristotelianism and\nNeo-Platonism that occurred within the Islamic intellectual world in\nthe tenth and eleventh centuries (cf. Adamson, P. & Taylor, R.C.\n2005, 4–6). Among these Islamic occasionalists, al-Ash‘ari\n(873–935), the founder of Ash‘arite school, appears to\nhave been particularly influential (Griffel 2007). \nIf al-Ash‘ari was the first of the Islamic occasionalists, it\nwas al-Ghazālī (c.1055–1111), the great philosopher and\ntheologian of the Ash‘arite school, who presented some of the\nmost significant and influential arguments for occasionalism in his\ninfluential work, The Incoherence of the Philosophers\n(Tahâfut al-falâsifa). This work has long been\nthe source of the interpretation that al-Ghazālī himself was\na committed global occasionalist, but recent interpretations have\nchallenged this view, arguing that al-Ghazālī’s goal\nsimply is to defend the possibility of miracles against the claims of\nthe falâsifa, and that he leaves open the possibility\nof some kind of genuine causality in creatures (Griffel 2007).\nNotwithstanding this issue of whether al-Ghazālī was an\noccasionalist or not, no one doubts that al-Ghazālī found\nsome key views of the falâsifa Avicenna (Ibn\nSīnā, 980–1037) problematic and worthy of criticism.\nIn particular, it seems to have been Avicenna’s\n“Aristotelian” approach to creaturely natures and powers\nthat was most problematic for al-Ghazālī in rendering\nconsistent with Ash‘arite\n kalām.[1]\n The main point of tension seems to stem from the Avicennan view that,\ngiven the natures or essences of creatures, there are causally\nnecessitating relations between creaturely causes and their effects\nsuch that the creaturely cause necessarily brings about the effect.\nAl-Ghazālī took this view to be in tension with the\ndoctrinal claim that theological orthodoxy requires the possibility of\nmiracles, which consist in the divine interruption of the ordinary\ncourse of events in nature. Thus, what worried al-Ghazālī\nmost is the idea that if creatures genuinely necessitate their\neffects, this would seem to imply that even in the face of divine\nmiraculous intervention, the natural effects would have to follow from\nthe cause. But such an implication was unacceptable for those holding\nthe standard understanding of divine omnipotence, which\nal-Ghazālī and other philosophers of the Ash‘arite\ntheological tradition thought to be essential to kalām.\nAny natural necessitating relation resistant to the exercise of divine\ncausal power was thought to be inappropriate, and thus causally\nnecessitating relations, properly understood (that is, in ways\nconsistent with divine omnipotence), are only instantiated in cases of\ndivine causation. In addition to this theologically motivated\nargument, al-Ghazālī’s criticism of causally\nnecessitating relations between creaturely causes and effects also\nincorporates his distinctive views on the modal relations between\ndistinct entities or facts, according to which “the connection\nbetween what is habitually believed to be a cause and what is\nhabitually believed to be an effect is not necessary”\n(TF 170) Al-Ghazālī’s central claim, as we\nwill examine in more detail later, was that “each of the two\nthings has its own individuality and is not the other, and neither the\naffirmation nor the negation, neither the existence nor the\nnon-existence of the one is implied in the affirmation, negation,\nexistence, and non-existence of the other” (Weinberg 1964,\n 123).[2] \nWe end this section with the observation that the main disagreement\nbetween those who regard al-Ghazālī as an occasionalist and\nthose who do not seems to rest on whether they take\nal-Ghazālī to have accepted the principle that a genuine\ncause must causally necessitate its effect. Those who argue for the\noccasionalist reading of al-Ghazālī appear to regard him as\ncommitted to this principle, while their opponents (such as Griffel)\nargue that al-Ghazālī is not fully committed to this\nprinciple. If al-Ghazālī is indeed committed to this\nprinciple, then given that al-Ghazālī only grants such\ncausally necessitating powers to God, he would be committed to denying\nany causal powers in creature. In contrast, if al-Ghazālī\ndoes not think that genuine causality implies that the cause causally\nnecessitates the effect, then he would in effect be making room for a\ndifferent conception of causation, one that is distinct from divine\ncausality, the unique causally necessitating power. This different\nconception of cause would allow for genuine secondary causality in\nthat creaturely causes would be real causes on this alternative\nconception, despite the fact that they do not causally necessitate\ntheir effects. Implicit in this disagreement over how to read\nal-Ghazālī are key questions that naturally arise in\ndisputes over the nature of causation: can something be a cause even\nif it does not necessitate its effect? Are not such antecedents at\nmost mere occasional causes? Moreover, what is the nature of the\nnecessitation involved? We will pursue these questions in the\nfollowing sections. \nThe criticism of positing “necessary connections” between\ncreaturely powers and their alleged effects also emerged in medieval\nChristian Europe, most notably, in the work of Nicholas of Autrecourt\n(1300–d. after 1350). Autrecourt was a precursor to the general\ncriticism of Scholasticism that swept through Europe in the early\nmodern period, and his critique of our alleged knowledge of causal\nconnections was part of his overall project of critically examining\nthe various knowledge claims within natural philosophy that were\ncentral to Aristotelian scholasticism. But his criticisms might have\nbeen too radical for his time, for he was summoned to the Curia at\nAvignon to answer charges of error and heresy, and in 1347 his\nwritings were publicly burned. He himself is said to have been banned\nfrom lecturing (Weinberg 1964, 267). \nSources suggest that Autrecourt was acquainted with the arguments set\nforth by al-Ghazālī (cf. Wolfson 1969, 234–8). Thus, it is\nno surprise that Autrecourt presents various arguments that are\nreminiscent of al-Ghazālī’s. For instance, like\nal-Ghazālī, Autrecourt in one formulation of his criticism\nof necessary connections relies on a dictum that the existence of one\nthing cannot be logically inferred from the existence of another thing\n(Weinburg 1964, 272). Hence Autrecourt held that, unless there were\noverwhelming reasons to the contrary, the default position should be\nto assume the lack of logically necessary connections between two\ndistinct entities. \nWe should note, however, that the overall focus of Autrecourt’s\nproject was to persuade us that our various judgments about the\nnatural world, including those concerning genuine causal connections,\nlack certainty, and that we thus ought to suspend judgment in such\nmatters. And it is with this goal in mind that he presented a variety\nof epistemological, metaphysical, and theological arguments to support\nthis skeptical stance toward affirming genuine causality among\ncreatures. Therefore, while Autrecourt’s arguments much resemble\nthe arguments deployed by occasionalists, it is far from clear that\nAutrecourt himself was an occasionalist. For his overall attitude\nseems to have been closer to that of a skeptic, in contrast to the\n“dogmatic” position of the occasionalists, who\nunequivocally denied creaturely causation and affirmed divine\ncausation. In this respect, the often quoted epithet that Autrecourt\nwas “the fourteenth-century Hume” seems rather appropriate\n(Nadler 1996, 458). If Autrecourt was indeed more skeptical than\ndogmatic about God’s role in nature, we might think that, in the\nWestern philosophical tradition, occasionalists in the proper sense of\nthe term emerge in earnest in the wake of René Descartes\n(1596–1650) in the form of “Cartesian\noccasionalists”.\n [3] \nThe issue of whether Descartes himself was an occasionalist has been\nthe subject of considerable debate. Given how many prominent\nCartesians were indeed occasionalists, it is not surprising that\nDescartes has been suggested as the source of this new wave of\noccasionalism that swept through the European continent in the second\nhalf of the seventeenth century. Some interpreters, accordingly, have\nheld that, while perhaps not fully endorsing occasionalism across the\nboard, Descartes did hold occasionalist views with regard to extended\nsubstances, or bodies. According to these interpreters, Descartes\ndenied that bodies acted on either other bodies or\n minds.[4]\n Others disagree and have argued, for instance, that in cases of\nbody-body interaction, Descartes affirmed the genuine causal powers of\nextended\n substances.[5]\n Note that, given the general framework of Cartesian dualism, four\ntypes of causal interaction among finite substances are usually\nconsidered: (1) body-body causation, where one extended substance\naffects another; (2) body-mind causation, where bodily changes bring\nabout changes in the mind; (3) mind-body causation, where the\ndirection of causation is reverse to that of body-mind causation, and\ncertain thoughts or volitions bring about changes in bodies; (4)\nintra-mental causation, where various forms of mental activity, such\nas producing ideas, are considered as typical cases. It is within this\nframework that the respective positions about causation, occasionalist\nor not, can be identified. \nCases (2) and (3) have received much attention from the general\nphilosophical audience. This phenomenon stems as far back as Princess\nElisabeth of Bohemia (see her astute exchange with Descartes in AT III\n663–8 (CSM III, 218)). As we can see in Elisabeth’s\ncorrespondence, from the beginning much of the focus has been directed\nat the issue of how or even whether two radically different substances\ncan causally interact. And this attention has at times led to the\ncaricature of occasionalism as an ad hoc solution to this problem for\nCartesian dualists. But, as we have already seen and will further see,\nthe scope and depth of the issues surrounding the emergence of\noccasionalism make it clear that this depiction is indeed a caricature\nat\n best.[6] \nIn contrast to the situation concerning Descartes’ alleged\ncommitment to occasionalism, there is no disagreement in the case of\nNicolas Malebranche, whose works provide some of the most extensive\nand important discussions of occasionalism. Thus, his arguments will\nbe the topic of further examination. But in addition to Malebranche,\nthere were a number of other Cartesians, prior to Malebranche, that\npresented a variety of views indicative of the occasionalist current\nin the 1660s. Among these Cartesians, the French physician and\nphilosopher Louis de la Forge (1632–66), the Parisian lawyer and\nphilosopher Géraud de Cordemoy (1614–83), the German\ntheologian and philosopher Johannes Clauberg (1622–55), and the\nDutch philosopher Arnold Geulincx (1624–69) are the most\nprominent. \nIn the case of La Forge, his credentials as an occasionalist about the\ncausal efficacy of extended substances or bodies has never been in\ndoubt. In fact, as noted earlier, it is La Forge who has been\nsuggested to have first employed the expression “occasional\ncause” in his Traité de l’esprit de\nl’homme (Carraud 2002, 347), where he argues that bodies\nare merely the “remote and occasional” causes of our ideas\nof them (TEH 132–4). Some interpreters have argued that\nLa Forge’s occasionalism extended to minds as well and thus was\na global occasionalist (Prost 1907, ch.6; Bouillier 1865, vol. 1, 503,\n513; cf. Nadler 1993b, 60, especially footnote 11), but others have\nargued against this view (Bardout 2002a, 145; Nadler 1993b,\n60–61). The case for restricting the scope of La Forge’s\noccasionalism to only extended substances seems well grounded, if we\ntake into consideration such texts as the following: “All of our\nideas considered in themselves in so far as they are only different\nways of thinking, need … no cause for their production other\nthan our mind” (TEH 177; cf. Nadler 1993b, 65). \nLa Forge’s work is also significant in that he seems to have\nbeen the first in this period to present an argument for occasionalism\non the basis of how God conserves an extended substance in existence.\nThis argument puts particular emphasis on the fact that God must not\nonly “continue to produce [a body], if he wants to preserve it\nin existence; but, in addition, because he cannot create it everywhere\nnor outside of any particular place, he must himself put it in a\nplace” (TEH 241; cf. Nadler 1993b, 63; Nadler 1998,\n219). As we shall see, this argument bears a strong resemblance to\nMalebranche’s most persuasive argument for global occasionalism,\nthe “conservation is but continuous creation”\nargument. \nGéraud de Cordemoy’s work appears to have had a direct\ninfluence on Malebranche, as Malebranche himself acknowledges in the\nSearch (OCM I 123/Search 49; Nadler 2005,\n38; cf. Gouhier 1926 95ff.; Battail 1973, 146ff.). Though there has\nbeen some disagreement about the scope of Cordemoy’s\noccasionalism, the consensus seems to be that he was a global\noccasionalist, denying causal efficacy to both minds and bodies. Thus,\nin this respect, he is a precursor to Malebranche. Cordemoy is also\nknown for a rather distinctive argument for why bodies are not real\ncauses, one that employs the controversial premise that the motion of\na body can be continued only by the causal agent that initiated it\n(Discernement 135–36; cf. Nadler 2005, 42). Based on\nthe observation that bodies do not self-initiate movement, Cordemoy\nargues that bodies thus need to be set into motion by a non-material\nfirst mover (Nadler 2005, 42). But given the aforementioned premise,\nany subsequent movement of bodies can only be continued by the causal\nagent that initially moved them, which leads to the occasionalist\nconclusion that God is the cause of all bodily motion. This argument\nseems to be related to a slightly different argument employed by\nMalebranche to argue for the same conclusion—that is, the lack\nof causal efficacy of extended substances. This latter argument, which\nemphasizes the passivity or passive nature of bodies, is one of\nMalebranche’s favorites and will be examined in more detail\nlater. \nJohannes Clauberg (1622–1655) has been identified by some as one of\nthe first philosophers influenced by Descartes to argue for\noccasionalism with regard to mind-body interaction on the basis of\ntheir radical heterogeneity (Bardout 2008b). With regard to other\ndomains, such as body-body causation, the majority consensus appears\nto be that he rejected occasionalism, and allowed bodily substances to\nbe causally efficacious (Nadler 2011). Even with regard to his\noccasionalism concerning mind-body interaction, his position has been\nsuggested to be rather nuanced. Schmaltz, for instance, has argued\nthat Clauberg’s occasionalism is restricted to the direction of\nbody to mind, such as in the case of sensations arising in accordance\nwith bodily changes, since there are textual grounds to think that\nClauberg endorsed some type of genuine causality on the part of our\nvolitions in the case of our voluntary control over our bodies\n(Schmaltz 2016, 180-1). Given our characterization of occasionalism at\nthe outset, however, even this restricted version might not qualify\nClauberg’s position as occasionalist, since most scholars agree\nthat Clauberg thinks that it is the soul itself that causes the\nrelevant sensations on the occasion of certain bodily changes. That\nis, Clauberg does not think that it is God that is unique genuine\ncause behind the occurrence of our sensations, a view he would have to\nhold were he to satisfy the requirements of occasionalism as we have\nspecified it (Schmaltz and others well acknowledge this point).\nClauberg’s significance then might best be thought of as\npresenting the explicit rejection of bodily changes being genuine\ncauses of changes in the mind (Bardout 2008b, Schmaltz 2016). The\ncomplexity of Clauberg’s views can be seen as an example\nrevealing how intricate and finely nuanced the diverse position came\nto be in the face of the complex considerations that were operative in\nthis period.  \nArnold Geulincx’s most distinctive contribution to the\ndevelopment of occasionalism comes in the form of a causal principle\nthat puts an epistemic restriction on the exercise of genuine\ncausality (see Nadler 1999, 268). In his Metaphysica vera,\nGeulincx states that “it is impossible to bring about something\nwhen one does not know how it is brought about … you are not the\ncause of that which you do not know how to bring about\n(impossibile est, ut is faciat, qui nescit quomodo fiat …\nquod nescis quomodo fiat, id non facis)” (MV\n150–1). If restricted to the causality of rational, intentional\nagents, the principle seems to have some intuitive appeal. But\nGeulincx, interestingly enough, does not restrict the principle in\nthis way. Rather, he takes it to be universally applicable, even to\nbodily causes, which has raised questions about the plausibility of\nthis overall argument. Malebranche appears to be taking up a version\nof this principle, which we will discuss later in the section on the\n“no representation” argument. \nGiven Malebranche’s influence on the development of\noccasionalism, a substantial portion of the section on the arguments\nfor occasionalism will be devoted Malebranche’s views. Here we\nsimply note that Malebranche appears to have been committed to\noccasionalism from early on in his philosophical career, since his\noccasionalism emerges clearly in his first major work, The Search\nfor Truth (De la recherche de la vérité,\n1674–75). In addition to the Search, Malebranche in the\nElucidations to the Search presents a long defense of his\noccasionalism against objections. And in the Dialogues we get\nMalebranche’s second major work to discuss the thesis of\noccasionalism centrally. Whether or in what way Malebranche’s\nviews were influenced by earlier occasionalists, as discussed earlier,\nwill not be centrally addressed here, given the limitations of\n space.[7]\n We will however compare some of Malebranche’s arguments with\nhis predecessors when relevant. \nThe extent of George Berkeley’s occasionalism is also a matter\nof some controversy. But there is general agreement among interpreters\nthat Berkeley was an occasionalist with regard to the causal powers of\nphysical objects. That is, physical objects for Berkeley are not\ncausally active in bringing about any events in the world. This denial\nis not surprising, if we consider the basic makeup of physical objects\nin Berkeley’s ontological scheme, along with his views about the\npassivity of ideas. For, according to Berkeley, physical objects,\nproperly understood, are but bundles or collections of ideas, and\nideas are manifestly passive—no power or activity is perceived\nin them (PHK\n 25).[8] \nIn De Motu, Berkeley also argues for the causal passivity of\nbodies in a more traditional manner, where he does not rely on his\nviews about the nature of physical objects as collections of\nideas: \nToday indeed Cartesian philosophers recognize God as the principle of\nnatural motions. And Newton everywhere frankly intimates that not only\ndid motion originate from God, but that still the mundane system is\nmoved by the same action. This is agreeable to Holy Scripture; this is\napproved by the opinion of the Schoolmen; for though the Peripatetics\ntell us that nature is the principle of motion and rest, yet they\ninterpret natura naturans to be God. They understand of\ncourse that all the bodies of this mundane system are moved by\nAlmighty Mind according to a settled and unchanging plan. (De\nMotu 32) \nModern thinkers consider motion and rest in bodies as two states of\nexistence in either of which every body, without pressure from\nexternal force, would naturally remain passive; whence one might\ngather that the cause of the existence of bodies is also the cause of\ntheir motion and rest. For no other cause of the successive existence\nof the body in different parts of space should be sought, it would\nseem, than that cause whence is derived the successive existence of\nthe same body in different parts of time. (De Motu 34) \nHere Berkeley seems to be arguing that the proper understanding of how\nGod relates to bodies and their motion would naturally lead us to\nconclude that all bodies are causally passive. The passive nature of\nbodies in this argument does not depend on their status as collections\nof ideas, but rather follows from the fact that the cause of the\nexistence of bodies is identical to the cause of the motion and rest\nof bodies, namely, God. In the background appears to be the widely\nheld theological principle that “conservation is but continuous\ncreation”, which, as we shall see, was most forcefully presented\nby Malebranche. \nHow then would Berkeley account for the apparent interaction between\nphysical objects we common experience, such as the stove in my kitchen\nboiling a pot of water? According to Berkeley, this phenomenon is to\nbe understood as God causing the relevant sensations in us in a\nregular fashion, and this regularity underwrites what we typically\ntake to be the laws of nature (PHK\n 30).[9]\n Thus, within the domain of physical objects, Berkeley appears to\nthink that God is the unique genuine cause, consistent with our\ncharacterization of occasionalism. There has been, however, some\ncontroversy in recent secondary literature as to whether one’s\nown body is to be included in this domain of physical objects. Some\n(such as McDonough 2008) have argued against this inclusion, while\nothers (such as Lee 2012) have argued that we, as finite spirits, have\nno genuine causal input in the movement of our own bodies, and such\nmovement is directly caused by God like any other physical object for\n Berkeley.[10] \nDespite this clear occasionalist stance toward physical objects,\nBerkeley, as has been pointed out, firmly maintains that spirits, both\ninfinite and finite, are causally active. The affirmation of the\ncausal efficacy of finite spirits or minds like us raises questions\nabout consistency, since the “conservation is but continuous\ncreation” principle, which seems to be doing the work in\nBerkeley’s occasionalist claims in De Motu, is\ntypically thought to be applicable universally, without discriminating\nbetween minds and bodies.\n [11] \nBefore examining the actual arguments for occasionalism, it might be\nhelpful to compare and contrast occasionalism with alternative,\ncompeting accounts of causation that aim to address similar issues and\nconcerns. The comparison can be done in two ways, since occasionalism\ncan be seen as dealing with two distinct sets of issues concerning\ncausation. \nOne way to view occasionalism is to see it as one of three possible\nresponses to the aforementioned problem of mind-body interaction. The\nother two responses would be “Cartesian interactionism”\nand Leibniz’s “pre-established harmony.” \nFaced with the issue of accounting for the apparent phenomena of\nmind-body interaction, those who subscribed to “Cartesian\ninteractionism” (following Williams 1978, 287; Williams actually\ndescribes the situation as a “scandal”) held that the\ncausal interaction is not merely apparent but real. In other words,\nchanges in the body and mind really bring about changes in each other.\nBut many found this position deeply unsatisfying. Some raised\nquestions about whether it was intelligible that such radically\ndistinct substances with nothing in common causally interacted, and\nothers questioned whether such a view was consistent with the view\nthat was gaining popularity, namely, that the material universe is\ncausally closed and governed solely by physical laws of nature.\nWhether or not Descartes actually held this interactionist position\nis, as discussed earlier, a matter of controversy, but even in\nDescartes’ time the list of the critics of interactionism was a\nlong one. \nOccasionalism and pre-established harmony emerged as alternatives to\nthe model of interactionism, in rejecting that there is genuine causal\ninteraction. In fact, their denial of real causal interaction among\ndistinct finite substances is not limited to mind-body interaction but\napplies across all board, be it body-body or mind-body causation. In\nother words, both views can be said to deny all\ninter-substantial causation, where by “substance”\nwe refer to finite substances or\n creatures.[12]\n However, occasionalism and pre-established parted ways when it came\nto the question of intra-substantial causation—that is,\nwhether or not there is causal activity going on within the\nsubstances such that finite substances are active in causing their own\nstates. Leibniz, the principal proponent of pre-established harmony,\nheld firm to the view that, while finite substances do not have the\ncausal power to bring about changes in other substances, they\nare causally active internally, that is, in causing their own\nstates. Each creature causally contributes to the occurrence of its\nown states, and the apparent interaction between distinct substances\nis due to how the states of distinct substances harmonize with each\nother. Following our characterization of occasionalism at the outset,\neven if the relevant domain of concern is restricted to the states of\na single, individual substance, an occasionalism would have to hold\nthat the creature itself is not playing a genuine causal role in the\noccurrence of those states. Leibniz, as a proponent of genuine\nintra-substantial causal forces, would reject this claim. Malebranche,\nin contrast, denied all causal powers to creatures, including the\nintra-substantial powers endorsed by Leibniz. For Malebranche, even\nthe internal states of a creature are mere occasions for God to bring\nabout the relevant subsequent states. \nThe other issue that occasionalism addresses is one that concerns how\ndivine causality relates to natural causality, or as Alfred Freddoso\nhas put it, “the general problem of divine action in\nnature” (Freddoso 1994, 131–5). The problem, as Freddoso\nnotes, consists of the following questions: if God ultimately is the\nfirst and direct cause of everything, including whatever occurs and\nexists in nature, can there be any causal activity on the part of\ncreatures?; and if there is secondary causation, how does this causal\nactivity fit in with God’s causal activity? In response to these\nquestions, historically, three positions have appeared:\n“conservationism,” “concurrentism,” and\n“occasionalism.” \nWe might distinguish the three positions by the degree of causal\nactivity assigned to God and the creature respectively, when a natural\nevent takes place. At one end is conservationism, which keeps divine\ncausal involvement to a minimum. According to conservationism, while\nGod conserves substances with their powers in existence, when\ncreatures are causally active in bringing about their natural effects,\nGod’s contribution is remote or indirect. In other words,\nGod’s causal contribution consists in merely conserving the\nbeing or esse of the creature in question along with its\npower, and the causal activity of the creature is in some\nstraightforward sense the creature’s own and not God’s\n(Freddoso 1991, 554). At the other end is occasionalism, where divine\ncausal activity is maximal and creaturely causal activity is\nnon-existent. For the occasionalist, divine causal activity is the\nonly type of genuine causality. Creatures provide at most an occasion\nfor God’s activity, which is uniquely direct and immediate in\nbringing about all effects in nature. Concurrentism (or “divine\nconcurrentism”) can then be seen as occupying the middle ground.\nConcurrentists hold that when a natural effect is produced, it is\nimmediately caused by both God and the creature. God\nand the creature are both directly involved and “concur”\nin bringing about the natural effects typically attributed to the\n creature.[13] \nIn this section, we will examine in more detail the main arguments in\nsupport of occasionalism. We will focus on the arguments provided by\nMalebranche and discuss relevant versions by other occasionalists when\n appropriate.[14] \nThe “passive nature” (hereafter “PN”) argument\naims to establish the occasionalist conclusion for bodies—that\nis, Cartesian extended substances—and only bodies, by focusing\non the characteristic features of these substances. In this respect,\nthe argument appears to be an instance of a “local”\nargument for occasionalism in that the scope of the argument is\nlimited to a particular type of substance. The argument aims to\nestablish the occasionalist conclusion for some finite\nsubstances, that is, bodies, and not all substances. \nThe first passages that stress the lack of activity of bodies as well\nas their lack of ability to initiate movement emerge in the\nSearch (OCM II 312–3/Search 448), soon after\nMalebranche’s first statement of his occasionalist thesis. In\nthe Elucidations, mixed together with the claim that the\n“motor force of bodies is but the will of God,” we are\npresented with the following description of bodies as being\n“purely passive substances”: \nBut why are bodies purely passive substances? The answer, according to\nMalebranche, lies in our idea of extension: \nThe central point seems as follows: given that all the properties of\nextension are exhausted by relations of distance, it would be a\ncategory mistake, as it were, to ascribe powers to bodies. Powers or\nforces are not properties that bodies can have at all, since powers do\nnot consist in relations of distance. That is, that something\npossesses a motive force and, thus, moves a body or affects a mind\nwould entail that the thing in question is not a body, since there\nwould be more to this thing than relations of distance. The key\npremise here is that causal powers or forces are not relations of\ndistance and, hence, not modes that bodies possess. This assumption\ngets expressed more explicitly in the following argument, which\nreinforces the understanding of bodily “passivity” as the\nbody’s being constituted by relations of distance alone: \nWith the help of the commonly accepted Scholastic assumption that any\nreal being must either be a substance or mode, Malebranche presents a\nrather clever argument that active powers have no place in bodies (see\nClatterbaugh 1999, 114–5). One might wonder what would be so bad\nwith the first option—that is, that of granting the existence of\na separate, distinct substance in bodies responsible for the\nbodies’ activity. But Malebranche’s response is clear:\neven if we bracket the worry of whether we could have a sufficiently\nclear idea of what kind of thing this substance would be, it is\nunlikely that this substance would be a Cartesian extended substance.\nFor it would possess modes or properties other than relations of\ndistance. And in discussing why the second option is going to fail, we\nsee the explicit statement that, though an active power perhaps could\nbe a mode of some other substance, it is not a mode that\nbelongs to bodies, since forces or powers are not relations\nof\n distance.[15] \nBut is it obvious that powers or forces are not relations of distance?\nThis question along with the questions about how powers or forces\nrelate to the more obvious properties of extension—for instance,\nsize and shape—raise interesting and important questions that go\nto the heart of the PN argument. The main intuitive\nthrust behind Malebranche’s PN argument is to convince the\nreader that, if we understand the Cartesian conception of matter or\nextension properly, we can see that motive force or power is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for being an extended\n substance.[16]\n This view seem rather close to Descartes’ original insight that\nhaving specific spatial features and standing in particular spatial\nrelations to other bodies are both necessary and sufficient conditions\nto be a bodily\n substance,[17]\n and Malebranche takes this to imply that whether these bodies further\npossess a motive force is an issue peripheral to the basic nature of\nbodies. Such a view seems to be expressed in his discussion of motion\nand rest in the Search: \nHere we get the impression that Malebranche is thinking that motive\nforce is something additional or added on, as it were, to bodies, and\nthat, in this respect, there is a fundamental difference between the\ntwo modes of motion and rest. In other words, whatever causal\ncontribution is needed on the part of God to bring bodies into\nexistence, there needs to be an additional causal contribution on the\npart of God in the form of a motive force to bring about changes in\nrelations of distance, which occur when bodies are moved. It is as if\nthe default mode of existence for extended substances is to be at\nrest, and motive force is added on through another divine volition,\none that is distinct from the volition that brings the body into\nexistence in the first\n place.[18]\n If so, this understanding of motion and rest fits well with the PN\nargument: motive force is not essential to extension because motive\nforce is not only not a relation of distance but rather some\nadditional feature that is added on to bodies, which are by default at\nrest and passive. \nWe end this section with the observation that Malebranche’s\nviews on motion and rest just discussed seems to be at odds with one\nof his global arguments for occasionalism, in particular, the\n“conservation is but continuous creation” argument\n(hereafter referred to the “CCC” argument). For the CCC\nargument strongly suggests a symmetry between God’s act of\ncontinuously creating a body at rest and continuously creating a body\nin motion, since the latter is described as differing from the former\nonly in that, in the latter case, God continuously creates the body in\ndifferent locations over time. \nThe “no knowledge” (hereafter “NK”) argument\naims to secure the occasionalist conclusion by presenting an\nintriguing, if controversial, epistemic condition on causal\n agency.[19]\n As noted earlier, Geulincx had argued that “you are not the\ncause of that which you do not know how to bring about”\n(MV 2 150–1). Malebranche presents his version of the\nargument in numerous places, including the following passage from the\nElucidations, where he denies that our minds are true causes,\nbased on our lack of knowledge of the intended effects: \nThough not explicitly stated, many commentators have read Malebranche\nas endorsing, in places such as this passage, the claim that the agent\nmust know how to bring about the effect in order to be its\ncause. \nThis “knowledge principle” (hereafter “KP”)\nraises a number of questions. One question concerns the scope of its\napplicability. For the principle to be plausible, it might be thought,\none ought to restrict it to intelligent, volitional agents. As long as\nwe accept the traditional conception of the will as being\n“blind” on its own and dependent on the guidance of the\nintellect, we might think that there is something to be said for the\nclaim that we can only bring about what we know. That is, bringing\nabout a volitional effect seems to presuppose our intending the\neffect, and we seem to intend only what we, through our intellect,\nactually represent or know. While most commentators seem to favor\nreading Malebranche as restricting the knowledge principle to minds,\nthere is, as Steven Nadler has argued, at least one passage that seems\nto suggest that Malebranche is endorsing the wide scope applicability\nof KP (Conversations Chrétiennes, OCM 4:15–6).\nAnd, as Nadler has also pointed out, Geulincx and some Islamic\noccasionalists indeed pressed the view that the principle applies\nubiquitously to all cases of genuine efficacy (Nadler 1999,\n263–74). \nIf Geulincx and Al-Ghazālī (and, arguably, even Malebranche)\ndid hold KP to be applicable to chairs and rocks as well as thinking\nsubstances, our next question then is why they would hold such a\ncounter-intuitive view. Nadler has made the interesting suggestion\nthat the wide-scope application of KP could have been motivated by the\nview that takes “volitional agency to be the paradigm\nof causality” (Nadler 1999, 270). Why take volitional agency to\nbe paradigmatic? According to Nadler, the critical link is divine\ncausal activity, which was the paradigmatic case of causality for the\noccasionalists in question. For if we take God’s causal activity\nto be fundamentally intentional and volitional in character, then it\nseems indeed a short step to taking volitional agency to be also\nparadigmatic of causality. \nThat the occasionalist would take divine causality to be the paradigm\ncase, of course, is no surprise, and this might indeed explain why\nGeulincx and Al-Ghazālī held the wide-scope view. For, if\nthey further assumed that all cases of genuine causation resemble the\nparadigmatic case of causation in this way, then insofar as KP is a\ncritical feature of divine causality, they would think that KP should\nbe satisfied in all cases of creaturely causation. This last\nassumption, however, is not trivial. For one wonders whether\ncreaturely causation ought to resemble divine causation in this\nrespect. Consider the fact that not all the features of the\nparadigmatic divine substance are replicated in created substances.\nFor instance, knowledge and intentionality are key divine features\nthat are not present in bodily substances. But this absence does not\nprevent extended substances from being the substances they are. But if\nknowledge and intentionality are not necessary for substancehood, as\nis the case for bodies, we might wonder whether they are necessary for\ncausal activity in bodies. \nThe second question about KP concerns the plausibility of the\nprinciple itself. Even if we just consider the best case\nscenarios—that is, when its application is restricted to\nthinking substances—it is not obvious that KP is without\nproblems. As mentioned earlier, on the assumption that volitional\npower is blind, the requirement that the intentional agent possess\nsome degree of knowledge of the effect does not seem completely\nimplausible in and of itself. The key issue, however, concerns the\nlevel of detail in the description of the intended outcome that is\nrequired for KP to be satisfied. For instance, returning to\nMalebranche’s example, when I intentionally will to raise my\narm, I do seem to represent the outcome of my arm going up, insofar as\nthe description of this outcome is left at a fairly general level. It\nis obvious, however, that I do not have knowledge of the outcome, if\nthe description of the outcome is at the level of detail that\nMalebranche wants it to be, such that it would involve the movements\nof the minute components of my arm, such as the minute organic matter\nmaking up the muscle, nerves, bones, etc. So depending on the level of\ndescription, one might think that I do satisfy KP. For the NK argument\nto work, then, Malebranche has to restrict the description of outcomes\nin KP to the highest level of detail. And it is not clear that\nMalebranche can provide non-question begging reasons to support this\nrestriction. \nAs noted earlier, the criticism of positing necessary \n connections[20]\n between creaturely powers and their effects first emerges in the work\nof al-Ghazālī. In the “Seventeenth Discussion”\nof The Incoherence of the Philosophers, al-Ghazālī\nwrites: \nAl-Ghazālī’s target is the “Aristotelian\nphilosopher”, exemplified by Avicenna, who affirms strict causal\nnecessitation relations between creaturely causes and their effects. A\ncentral motivation behind this criticism is to secure the possibility\nof miracles reported in the Qur’ân and the prophetic\ntraditions that were considered impossible by these philosophers\noriented towards “Aristotelianism” (TF 166; cf.\nMarmura 2005, 146). \nAccording to al-Ghazālī, the proper understanding of divine\nomnipotence dictates that no limitation on divine power is justified,\nunless the state of affairs impermeable to divine power is one that is\nlogically inconsistent. In other words, it is within divine power to\nbring about any state of affairs except for those that are logically\ninconsistent—for instance, where I both exist and not exist: \nGiven the examples in TF 170, we see that\nal-Ghazālī does not take the state of affairs in which, say,\na live fire does not burn a dry piece of cotton to be impossible. For,\naccording to al-Ghazālī, there is no logical entailment\nrelation between the cotton coming into contact with the fire and its\nburning. Hence, it is logically consistent to suppose that cotton not\nburn when it comes into contact with fire. \nThe interesting question is how the Aristotelian philosopher would\nrespond to this claim. Why couldn’t Avicenna simply deny that\nthis state of affairs is possible in that the suggestion of fire not\nburning cotton indeed is logically inconsistent, given their\nrespective natures or essences? In other words, why couldn’t the\nAristotelian philosopher contest the non-entailment claim and argue\nthat the essences of fire and cotton along with the event of their\ncoming into contact do entail the event of the cotton burning? \nAs we can see in the long quote from TF 170 and other\npassages in The Incoherence (e.g. TF 1), the\noperative conception of entailment for al-Ghazālī appears to\nthat of “conceptual” entailment, where the concepts of\n“fire” and “cotton” are rather sparse in terms\nof content. Whatever content is contained in these concepts, they are\nstill sparse enough to not entail such facts as “the burning of\nappropriately dry cotton that comes into contact with fire.” In\nother words, the causal powers typically identified as being part of\nthe essences of created substances, something the Aristotelian\nphilosophers would have found very hard to resist, are not built into\nthe concepts, as it were, for al-Ghazālī. \nIn this case, the main issue of contention between\nal-Ghazālī and the falâsifa would concern how\nrich the contents of the concepts of creatures are. What\nal-Ghazālī needs is a rather thin notion of what a concept\nor essence of a creature is, while the Aristotelian philosopher would\nobviously argue for a richer understanding of the contents of these\nconcepts, one that would include various causal powers as their\nessences. A key intuition driving al-Ghazālī’s view\nseems to be that if one takes the concepts of creatures to be rich in\nthis way, then there is no logical space for the miraculous\nintervention on the part of God. For on the Aristotelian scheme,\ndivine intervention such as God’s keeping the cotton from\nburning would imply that either God has to change the cotton into\nsomething else at the time of\n intervention,[21]\n or that God has to done something that is logically inconsistent, or\nimpossible. \nNeither option seems palatable to al-Ghazālī, and his\ninnovative proposal is to distinguish between logical connections and\ncausal connections. On al-Ghazālī’s scheme, the\nlogically necessary constitute a much narrower set of connections than\nthose that are causally necessary (Dutton 2001, 24–5; Schmaltz\n2008b, 299–301). This setup allows him to claim that when God\nintervenes to stop a piece of dry cotton from burning, which obviously\ndiverges from the natural course of events, God need not change the\ncotton fibers into some material that is fire-resistant, nor is he\ndoing something that is logically impossible. Rather, God is bringing\nabout a state of affairs that is perfectly consistent, hence,\npossible, but one that is an exception, when compared to the normal\ntype of causal connections we come to expect between fire and\ncotton. \nBut what then grounds these normal types of causal connections we\ntypically anticipate? If they are not grounded in the natures or\nessences of things, what is their source? As we saw in the long quote\nfrom TF 170, al-Ghazālī not surprisingly holds that\n“[t]heir connection is due to the prior decree of God, who\ncreates them side by side, not to its being necessary in itself,\nincapable of separation.” In other words, the law-like relations\nthat we typically think to hold between creaturely natures are\nactually grounded in divine decrees. \nThe question of whether al-Ghazālī himself is committed to\noccasionalism depends on whether al-Ghazālī regards this\nclaim that the “connection [between creatures] is due to the\nprior decree of God” to be incompatible with there being real\nsecondary causation—that is, genuine creaturely causation. As\nnoted earlier, interpreters disagree on this issue. Some, such as\nMarmura, argue that al-Ghazālī did find the two claims to be\ninconsistent, and rejects the latter claim that there are real\nsecondary causes. Marmura grants that the texts in the\nIncoherence are insufficient to support this claim, but\nargues that other texts well establish al-Ghazālī’s\ncommitment to occasionalism (Marmura 2005, 145–52). Other\ninterpreters, such as Griffel in addition to Perler and Rudolph, have\nargued that al-Ghazālī leaves open the possibility that\nGod’s causal activity is consistent with some form of genuine\nsecondary causality, on the condition that the secondary causation in\nquestion is not of the type espoused by the falâsifa\n(Griffel 2007; Perler & Rudolph 2000, 75–77). \nWe end our discussion of al-Ghazālī on necessary connections\nwith the following observation: if al-Ghazālī does consider\ngenuine secondary causation to be consistent with divine causal\nactivity, he would have to concede that there are distinct types of\ncausation. For al-Ghazālī would have granted that the causal\nconnection between the decree of God and its effect is substantially\ndifferent from the causal connection between a creaturely cause and\nits effect. The former type of connection would be the strongest of\nall possible causal connections, since divine omnipotence would\nrequire that for all events that are logically possible, should God\ndecree their occurrence, they would come about with causal necessity.\nIn contrast, creaturely causes obviously lack this omnipotent power,\nsuch that whatever causal connection they have to their effects, it\ncannot be, in principle, as strong as that of divine decree. So this\nsuggests that the strength of the causal connection would differ\nsubstantially between divine causation and secondary causation, and\nthis difference might lead one to wonder these two types of causation\ncan be brought under a single, univocal notion of causation. \nIn the work of Nicolas Malebranche, to whom we now turn, we are\npresented with an explicit argument denying secondary causation on the\ngrounds that (1) something is a true cause if and only if there is a\nnecessary connection between it and its effect and (2) there are\nnecessary connections only between the will of God and its effects.\nConsider the following passage from the Search: \nThough the argument clearly is couched in terms of perceiving\nnecessary connections, the overall context makes it clear the central\npoint is more metaphysical in nature. Malebranche’s key point\nhere is that there are no causally necessary connections between\nalleged creaturely causes and their effects, since creaturely causes\ncannot but fall short of the criterion of genuine causation, that is,\nnecessary\n efficaciousness.[22] \nWhy is it that creaturely causes cannot but fall short in this way?\nAccording to Malebranche, this is due to the fact that God could\nalways will some event contrary to what the creature allegedly brings\nabout. For instance, Malebranche invites us to consider the case of\ndemons, where God wills to bring about a state of affairs contrary to\nwhat demons will: \nSimilar to what we had seen in al-Ghazālī,\nMalebranche’s core intuition appears to be that it is plainly\npossible for a creature to fail to bring about some effect that is\ntypically thought to be within the purview of its causal powers. To\ndeny such a possibility would entail a problematic restriction on\ndivine omnipotence, or so Malebranche appears to be thinking. This is\nnot to say that Malebranche is willing to expand divine omnipotence\nlimitlessly, such that divine volition would have power over logical\ntruths, for instance. In contrast to Descartes, Malebranche was\nagainst the doctrine of the creation of eternal truths. Certain truths\nfor Malebranche hold of logical necessity: those truths whose denials\nare contradictory are independent of and insulated from divine\nvolitional intervention. In this respect, he is in agreement with\nal-Ghazālī. For both philosophers, divine power extends to\nall and only that which is possible, that is, logically\nconsistent. \nOnce again, the interesting question is how one should think of the\nnatures of things, and whether the natures of things are rich enough\nto have various conceptual entailments that are logically binding. An\nAristotelian realist about secondary causes would likely hold that the\nnatures of creatures are robustly rich such that the effects that even\nan omnipotent God can bring about are restricted to the possibilities\nallowed by these creaturely natures. Malebranche is denying this view\nof creaturely natures, in that the options for God, as it were, are\nmuch more diverse, and we wonder on what grounds Malebranche can argue\nfor this view. In the case of extended substances or bodies, a reason\nthat is independent of theological motivations might be available to\nMalebranche in the following way: armed with a Cartesian understanding\nof extended substances, Malebranche could say that given the sparse\nessence of bodies, consisting of merely size, shape, and motion, there\nare no conceptual entailments that follow from a concept of a given\nbody that are rich enough to support the typical causal connections\nAristotelians would like to affirm. That is, proper consideration of\nwhat bodily substances are, Malebranche could argue, clearly reveal\nthat there are no such entailments. And, perhaps, an analogous case\ncan be made for thinking substances, to the effect that that a\nthinking substance essentially has thoughts does not lead to any\nobvious conceptual connections that would dovetail nicely with the\ncausal powers traditionally identified as belonging to the mind. That\nis, the mere having of certain thoughts, which is the essence of the\nmind, carries no implications as to what other thoughts one must have\nsubsequently or what other states of mind one must be in. \nNot surprisingly, Malebranche also has some theologically motivated\nreasons for rejecting such rich conceptions of natures as well. He\nappears to find the idea that divine efficient causality is bound by\nnatures of creatures to be rather problematic: “when one thinks\nabout the idea of God, i.e., of an infinitely perfect and consequently\nall-powerful being, one knows that there is such a connection between\nHis will and the motion of all bodies, that it is impossible to\nconceive that He wills a body to be moved and that this body not be\nmoved” (OCM II 313/Search 448). In other\nwords, were there a conceptually necessary connection between body A\nmoving body B in a particular way, then even if God were to will body\nB to move in a different manner, given the assumed conceptually\nnecessary connection that holds between body A and body B, God’s\nvolition would fail. But this is impossible, Malebranche is arguing,\ngiven the proper understanding of divine omnipotence. So, for\nMalebranche, the proper understanding of divine omnipotence dictates\nthe absence of conceptual entailments that determine specific\nmovements.  \nInterestingly enough, from this claim concerning the necessary\nefficaciousness of divine volition, Malebranche immediately infers\n“[w]e must therefore say that only His will can move bodies if\nwe wish to state things as we conceive them and not as we sense\nthem” (OCM II 313/Search 448). This is a\nproblematic move, as we have already seen in our discussion of\nal-Ghazālī. For to accept that divine power is unique in its\nnecessary efficaciousness need not itself imply that God is the only\ncause. Many a theist would grant that creaturely causes lack necessary\nefficaciousness on the very grounds that Malebranche had presented,\nbut still argue that this does not mean that they lack causal powers.\nDivine concurrentists, for instance, typically argue that all\nsecondary causation requires divine concurrence, such that the\ncreature’s powers in themselves are never sufficient to bring\nabout an effect, and that God’s power is such that he could\nalways override the causal contribution of the creature and bring\nabout a contrary effect. Despite such concessions, divine\nconcurrentists nonetheless affirm the causal activity of the creature\nin producing the effect when the effect is concurrently produced. What\nMalebranche needs to establish, then, is the claim that causation just\nis necessary efficaciousness, and the pressing question for\nMalebranche is how he can defend this claim. \nIn the Search at least, Malebranche seems to be thinking that\nthe divine intervention cases provide us with a reason to think that\nit is God who does all the causal work. For when God intervenes to\nbring about an effect contrary to what the demon wills, it is clear\nthat God is the unique cause of the event. So parity of reasoning\nsuggests, or so Malebranche seems to be thinking, that in the normal\ncase in which I will my arm to go up and it does go up, it is also God\nwho alone brings about my arm going up. But this argument is far from\nconvincing, since it does not follow from the fact that my power can\nbe overridden in certain circumstances, that I am powerless\nsimpliciter. We still need to consider cases when my power is\nnot overridden, and it seems clear that the fact that I successfully\npushed the door shut when my five year old son pulled to open it does\nnot entail that when my son is successful in opening the door with my\nhelp, my son is causally ineffective. \nIn fairness to Malebranche, we might point out that, in identifying\nnecessary connections with genuine causality, Malebranche is\npresenting an attractive reductive analysis of causation, one that we,\nbenefitting from the exposure to David Hume’s work, are already\nfamiliar with. In fact, it does not seem far-fetched to say that it is\nin part due to Hume that we are accustomed to such a clear-cut\nunderstanding of causation as necessary connection. But note that the\nintellectual climate of Malebranche’s time period was rather\ndifferent: philosophers were trying to come to grips with the\ncomplicated task of understanding the nature of causality given the\nnew scientific developments of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies. Moreover, this endeavor took place against the backdrop of\nthe traditional approaches to causation, involving the confusing\nmyriad of the four Aristotelian causes. Compared to the Aristotelian\nconception, Malebranche’s conception of causation is remarkably\nsimple and unified, and does not face the question of how such diverse\nand distinct types of Aristotelian causes can come under a single\nconception of causation. Furthermore, there is some evidence that\nMalebranche might have responded to our challenge to produce a better\nargument for this conception of causation as necessary connections by\nnoting how difficult it is to imagine what causation would be if not\nnecessary connections, in much the same way that Hume did. That is,\ngiven his statement in the Search that “[a] true cause\nas I understand it [c’est ainsi que je\nl’etends] is one such that the mind perceives a necessary\nconnection between it and its effect” (Search 450, my\nemphasis), Malebranche might have had something close to the Humean\nidea in mind—though not developed as clearly and\nemphatically as in Hume—that we have no conception of\nwhat a causal connection would be, if it is not a necessary\nconnection. If so, this intuition could have provided a rationale for\nthe claim that an event is a true cause if and only if there is a\nnecessary connection between it and its effect. But given how\ncontroversial such a claim is within the context of considering divine\ncausation in nature, one wonders whether this central claim\nidentifying necessary connection with causation could have been\nfurther\n motivated.[23] \nThe main strategy of this argument is to establish the thesis of\noccasionalism by drawing out the implications of the commonly held\ntheological principle that “conservation is but continuous\n creation.”[24]\n If the main premise of the NNC argument—that is, the premise\nthat genuine causation just consists in necessary\nconnection—would have been resisted by many concurrentists, the\nstrategy behind the CCC argument holds more promise in that the CCC\nthesis was widely accepted by the majority of theists in our time\nperiod, including the concurrentists. The issue of how to interpret\nthe CCC thesis, however, is at the center of the dispute, since\noccasionalists like Malebranche deny creaturely causation\nbecause they accept the CCC thesis, while concurrentists like\nLeibniz affirm genuine creaturely causation despite upholding\nthe CCC thesis.  \nBefore proceeding further, we might briefly examine why the CCC thesis\nwas so broadly accepted as the orthodox view, by considering what\nimplications the rejection of the CCC thesis was thought to entail.\nThe most significant implication of rejecting the CCC thesis, from the\nperspective of the proponents of the CCC thesis, is the consequence\nthat divine causal activity at creation is markedly different from\ndivine causal activity in moments of conservation, such that the\ndifference is sufficient to deny the identity of the two acts. Hence,\nconservation is not continuous creation. An intuitive way of\ncashing out this difference, which indeed is how “mere\nconservationists” such as Durandus proceeded, is to think that\nwhile God does everything there is to be done, causally speaking, at\nthe moment of creation, God does less in subsequent moments of\nconservation such that God merely conserves the creatures in\nexistence. How is God doing less in conservation, according to the\nconservationist? In moments of conservation, if the event that is\ncaused is a non-miraculous natural event, the direct,\nimmediate cause of this event is a creaturely cause, and not\ndivine. God is involved, even for the conservationist, but only in a\nmediated, indirect manner—God works in the background,\nas it were, keeping the creaturely cause in existence, allowing the\ncreature to exercise its causal powers in a direct, immediate fashion.\nFor instance, if the fire of a gas range causes the water in the\ncoffee pot to boil, the boiling of the water is directly and\nimmediately caused by the fire, even if it is fully granted that the\nexistence of the fire must be directly conserved by God. Thus, God, in\nkeeping the fire in existence, which in turn allows the fire to boil\nthe water directly and immediately, is mediately and remotely involved\nin the boiling of the water, according to the mere conservationist.\nGod is merely conserving the fire (and water) and not\ndirectly causing the water to boil. From our contemporary perspective,\nthis indirect, mediated involvement on the part of God might seem\nsufficient to give divine causality its due place in nature. But the\ntheistic philosophers of the late Scholastic and early modern period\nfound this way of securing the role of divine causality theologically\ninsufficient and suspect. The main worry appears to have been that to\nthink that the dependence of creatures on God is somehow reduced, once\ncreation has past, fundamentally misrepresents the critical dependence\ncreatures have on God throughout their existence, be it\ncreation or conservation. Because in terms of creaturely dependence\nconservation and creation are fundamentally the same, these\nphilosophers seemed to have been thinking, what other differences\nthere might be between conservation and creation, these differences\nare negligible. It is from this perspective that the orthodox view was\nto affirm the identity between conservation and\n creation.[25] \nAn early version of something close to the core idea behind the CCC\nargument emerges in the views of al-Ash‘ari (873–935), the\nfounder of Ash‘arite school. As Perler and Rudolph have argued,\naccording to al-Ash‘ari, God rearranges the atoms that make up\nthis world anew at every instant, and in so doing God continuously\ncreates the accidents that inhere in these atomic substances (Perler\nand Rudolph 2000, 28–62). The view seems to have been one where\nthe accidents of a substance possess only a momentary existence.\nHence, at every instant, God brings about the accidents that inhere in\nthe substances by continuously recreating these modes. If God sustains\nthe existence of the atoms themselves, while continuously recreating\nall of their modes, then, barring causal overdetermination, the\noccasionalist conclusion that God is the only genuine cause does seem\nto follow from this interpretation of divine conservative\nactivity. \nOn the European continent, the most artful presentation of the CCC\nargument is found in Malebranche. But the argument is not thought to\nhave originated with Malebranche, and it has typically been traced\nback to Descartes, though whether he was himself indeed an\noccasionalist is some matter of controversy, as noted earlier. One of\nthe main texts surrounding this controversy comes from the Third\nMeditation: \nTaken in isolation, this passage does suggest that Descartes took our\nsouls to be continuously created by God in a way that would preclude\nany genuine causal activity on our part. For if, in initially creating\nof my soul—that is, in its creation ex nihilo—God\nbrings about both the existence of my soul and its modes or\nmodification, then, since the “same power and action” of\nGod is required in preserving my existence subsequent to creation\nab initio, God would be the sole causal agent that brings\nabout my preserved existence with the modes I possess. But to conclude\non the basis of this interpretation that Descartes was an\noccasionalist would be premature, since there is a good supply of\nother texts that suggest Descartes’ affirmation of our genuine\ncausal efficacy. \nIn contrast, Louis de la Forge’s commitment to the occasionalist\nthesis, at least with regard to bodies, seems unquestionable. For he\nmakes explicit the critical claim that God’s causal activity of\nproducing a body is inseparable from his producing the particular\nmodes of the body in question: \nThe central idea is that God’s causal activity with regard to\nthe production of a body is an “all or nothing” affair, in\nthe sense that if God produces the body, God produces it with all of\nits specific modes or properties. In other words, though God need not\ncreate a body, as long as he does create or conserve it, he cannot do\nso without bringing about its specific spatial properties or modes.\nWhy, we might ask, is this the case? Even if one grants that there can\nbe no abstract or general Cartesian body, as it were—that is, a\nbody that is extended in general without any specific spatial\nproperties or modes—such that even God could not create such a\nbody in the abstract, the concurrents could still wonder, why is it\nthe case that the cause that gives the esse to a given body\nmust also be the cause that produces its specific modes and properties\nas well? It is here that the CCC thesis provides the missing link. For\nif conservation is but continuous creation, in the sense that the\ncharacter and degree of dependence is identical in the two cases, then\ninsofar as there was total dependence at creation, there would have to\nbe total dependence in conservation. Occasionalism with regard to\nbodies would follow. Given that God has a monopoly over producing both\nthe body itself and its modes, no other cause is operative in bringing\nabout any aspect of the world. Conservation is but continuous\ncreation. \nAt this point, we might want to consider the possibility of\noverdetermination. Could we not think that some creaturely effects are\noverdetermined in conservation? That is, might we not grant that God\nis the total and direct cause of a creature’s modes but also\nhold that the creature causes its modes as well such that certain\neffects are causally overdetermined? Moreover, if it is only the modes\nof the creature that are overdetermined, then it seems as though there\nis no violation of the central tenet that God is the unique causal\nsource of the esse that creatures have. As we have discussed\nearlier, divine causal power importantly involves that of keeping the\nbeing or esse of the creature in existence, and even the\nconservationist grants that the role of a conserving cause—that\nis, the causal power of keeping the being of creatures in\nexistence—is the unique prerogative of God as the causa\nsecundum esse. That is, all parties in this dispute concerning\nthe issue of secondary causation in nature agree, regardless of their\nviews about the reality of creaturely causal powers, that the being or\nesse of a creature when the creature is conserved is just as\ndependent on God as when the creature is created ex nihilo.\nGod is the unique creative and conserving cause of any being or\nesse in this world. \nThe overdetermination of modes, thus, cannot be ruled out on the mere\ngrounds that such overdetermination involves a malignant type of\ncausal overreach on the part of creatures, overflowing into the\nexclusive divine realm of providing esse. For the proponents\nof overdetermination are taking the creaturely power to be restricted\nto that of bringing about a creature’s modes. The creature\ntherefore would not share in the power of the causa secundum\nesse, and what power the creature would have to produce modes or\nmodifications would be effective only insofar as the creature’s\nbeing or esse has been produced by God. Hence, the critical\ndependence of the creature’s esse or being on God is\nmaintained. It is in this sense that cases of overdetermination of\nmodes might present a noteworthy challenge to the advocates of\noccasionalism arguing on the basis of the CCC thesis. \nBut this is not to say that the occasionalist is left without possible\nresponses to this challenge. First of all, the occasionalists might\nsuggest that such overdetermination implies that God is engaging in\nneedlessly redundant causal behavior. Not only would God be producing\nthe modes himself but he would also be producing the causal power of\nthe creature that is an overdetermining cause of these modes. And the\noccasionalist could go on to argue that such redundancy is\nproblematic. Second, and more importantly, if a core intuition behind\nthe CCC thesis, as pointed out earlier, is the point that a\ncreature’s dependence on God when it is conserved is no less\nthan when it is initially created ex nihilo, then we might\nthink that the overdetermination of an effect in conservation\nconflicts with this symmetric dependency. For if some effects are\noverdetermined in conservation, then with regard to those effects of\nthe creature, the creature’s dependence is in some significant\nsense less than in creation, since the effects would come about even\nif the mode-producing causal activity of God were absent. The fact\nthat the occurrence of these effects is causally guaranteed through\noverdetermination—particularly in virtue of the creature’s\nproductive power—could be thought to be inconsistent with the\nradical dependence of creatures expressed in the doctrine of creation\nex nihilo. A different way to put the point would be to argue\nthat the view that allows for overdetermination in the production of\nmodes would come dangerously close to mere conservationism in that the\ncreaturely cause on the overdetermination view is capable of directly\nand immediately bringing about the mode in question. For the\noverdetermination scenario suggests that even if God were not to\nproduce the mode directly, the mode would come about from the\ncreature’s power in virtue of God conserving the creature with\nits power. Thus, insofar as the creature is an overdetermining cause,\nits causal power, in effect, is of a type that is typically endorsed\nby\n conservationists.[27]\n Though neither La Forge nor Malebranche directly address the\npossibility of overdetermination, the following passage from La Forge\nseems to support the view that this intuition about the symmetry of\ndependence is indeed part of his motivation behind his endorsement of\nthe CCC thesis: \nAs we have seen, the success of the CCC argument relies heavily on the\nclaim that the act of creation ex nihilo and the act of\nconservation are indistinguishable in terms of both the dependence of\nthe creature on God and the role and content of divine causal\nactivity. That is, the two acts are qualitatively identical in terms\nof what God is doing, causally speaking. Malebranche reinforces this\nclaim in his Dialogues by emphasizing that God’s causal\nactivity of sustaining the being or esse of a creature and\nhis causal activity of bringing about the modes of a creature cannot\ncome apart: \nMalebranche here is assuming that in the case of creation ex\nnihilo God is the cause of not only the being or esse of\na creature but also its modes—presumably because no other\npossible cause actually exists prior to the act of creation ex\nnihilo. So by taking God’s conserving activity to be\nqualitatively identical to his activity as creator ex nihilo,\nMalebranche appears to arguing that even in cases where the creatures\nare conserved, God is the unique cause of both their esse and\nmodes. Since the modes of a creature cannot in principle have been\ncausally overdetermined in the case of creation ex\nnihilo—for creation ex nihilo suggests that no\ncause exists prior to the act of creation—if the\ncreature’s dependence on God in instances of conservation is\nidentical to the instance of creation ex nihilo, then there\ncan be no overdetermination in the production of modes in cases of\nconservation. Now the concurrentist might reply at this point that\nconcurrentists deny overdetermining creaturely causes as well, since\ntheir point is that the creature is a concurring cause of the\nmodes of the creature: the causal contribution of neither God nor the\ncreature are redundant, since both are necessary in some manner. But\nnotice that if it is indeed the case that the act of creation ex\nnihilo should be understood to imply that God is the unique cause\nof both the esse and modes of the creature, and if\nconservation is qualitatively identical to continuous creation ex\nnihilo in causally relevant respects, then the concurrentist\nwould have to either reject the CCC thesis or suggest a different\naccount of what is going on at creation ex\n nihilo.[29]\n For if this way of understanding continuous creation rules out\noverdetermining causes, it also rules out concurring causes.  \nHowever, some have suggested that identifying conservation with\ncreation ex nihilo this closely effectively pushes us to\nregard conservation as continuous recreation, where the\ncreature that is supposedly “conserved” falls out of\nexistence instantaneously before it is repeatedly\n recreated.[30]\n Interestingly, this “continuous recreation” reading seems\nwell-motivated from the occasionalist perspective. If one wants to\nenforce a strict identity between conservation and creation, why not\ngo all out and take conservation to be recreation ex nihilo,\nin which case the absence of any cause other than God will be\nguaranteed, thereby automatically securing the occasionalist thesis?\nOn this reading as continuous recreation, conservation is in fact the\ncontinuous resuscitation of the creature from the void of\nnon-existence, into which the creature is thrust instantaneously after\nits momentary existence. Some, such as Winkler, have suggested that\nthe continuous recreation reading of the CCC thesis would indeed do\nthe work of establishing occasionalism, since at every moment of\nconservation, there would literally be no creature around, as it were,\nto cooperate as a concurring\n cause.”[31]\n Continuous creation as recreation, however, raises a number of\nconcerns, including the question of whether the transtemporal identity\nof creatures can be maintained. For, on the recreation model, the\nprevious creature ex hypothesi goes out of existence, and\nanother one is created anew and the two would then seem to be\nnumerically distinct.  \nPerhaps more serious is the following type of challenge by the\nconcurrentist. The concurrentist at this point might protest and\nquestion whether and why the identity of conservation and creation\nneed be taken in this manner. Given that the concurrentist wishes to\nmaintain theological orthodoxy and endorse the CCC thesis as well, the\nconcurrentist might suggest that an alternative understanding of the\nidentity between creation and conservation is available in the\nfollowing manner: to say that conservation is but continuous creation\njust is to say that the act of creation and conservation is but a\nnumerically single act on the part of God, and thus it need not be the\ncase that what God does, causally speaking, remains qualitatively the\nsame throughout this one, continuous act. For example, one might take\na single, continuous walk during which the pace is at times brisk, at\ntimes leisurely, but such difference in terms of exertion throughout\nthe walk does not split the walk into two distinct\n acts.[32]\n On such a model, the concurrentist could argue that she also agrees\nthat conservation is continuous with creation and thus conservation\nand creation comprise a single, identical act, but the affirmation of\nthe CCC thesis, cashed out in this way, need not imply that there is\nno creaturely contribution in moments of conservation. God, on this\n“continuous maintenance” reading (Winkler 2011, 301)\nmaintains the creature throughout its existence in a single, unified\nact, but what God does at the initial point of creation differs from\nwhat God does when he merely conserves the creature. Note that this\n“continuous maintenance” reading targets not only the\n“continuous recreation” reading but “qualitative\nidentity” reading as well. For the latter two readings share the\nintuition that the identity in question is one in which divine causal\ncontribution be thought to be qualitatively the same, regardless of\nwhether it be in the form of recreation or not.  \nThe dialectic then at this point can be understood as a debate between\ntwo fundamentally different readings of the CCC thesis. On the one\nhand, there are those, like Malebranche, who take the CCC thesis as a\npremise toward occasionalism in that the identity in question is one\nof qualitative identity in the sense that what God does causally\nspeaking at creation ex nihilo is the same as what God does\nin conservation—let’s call this the “qualitative\nidentity” reading. On the other hand, there are who read the\nidentity as a mere numerical identity, wherein God continuously\nmaintains the creature throughout its existence, but what God does\nqualitatively at creation is different from what God does in\nconservation. God does less in conservation than at creation, but the\nacts comprise one continuous whole—let’s call this the\n“numerical identity” reading. If the numerical identity\nreading was more comfortable to those divine concurrents who wanted to\nboth endorse the CCC thesis and allow for genuine causation\nat the creaturely level, one might think that the contribution of\noccasionalists like La Forge and Malebranche to the debate was to\npresenting a strong case as to why the qualitative identity reading\nought to be preferred as the correct interpretation of the CCC thesis.\nHere actually is Malebranche pressing precisely this case: \nNote in the last sentence that the identity of the volition is cashed\nout in terms of the identity of the effects, which supports the view\nthat for Malebranche, the proper reading of the CCC thesis is the\nqualitative identity reading. For the numerical identity reading\nentails that God’s effect in conservation ought to be\ndistinguished from God’s effect at creation in that God does\nless in conservation than creation. \nLastly, we note that, while La Forge appears to have limited his\noccasionalism to extended substances and held that we as minds are\ncausally active in producing our ideas (TEH 166), Malebranche\nextends his occasionalism to thinking substances. Consider the\nfollowing passage from the Treatise on Ethics (1684): \nHere we get something close to a generalized version of the key claim\nof the CCC argument in the Dialogues that God cannot will\nthat an extended substance exist, “without at the same time\nwilling that it exist either here or there and without His will\nplacing it somewhere” (OCM XII 156/Dialogues\n110): only he who gives being could be able to give the ways of being.\nAnd, importantly, this principle is said to be applicable to the\n“ways of being of\n minds.”[33]\n In effect, we are presented with an explicit denial of the\npossibility that God’s sustaining activity of the being or\nesse of a creature can be separated from his activity of\nbringing about the modes of the creature, regardless of whether the\ncreature is an extended or thinking substance. Hence, the CCC argument\nseems to be fully applicable to the modes or ways of the being of the\nminds, just like bodies. \nMalebranche’s extension of the thesis of occasionalism to\nthinking substances, as presented here in the Treatise on\nEthics, is not an aberration. In one of his most careful\nstatements about how minds relate to his occasionalism, Malebranche\nclaims as follows: \nHere, once again, we get an explicit statement that God is the sole\nauthor of all substances and their modes. Note, however, that\nMalebranche is careful to specify what he means by a\n“mode” of a substance. This clarification is motivated by\nthe attempt to make room for a kind of power within minds or thinking\nsubstances that will allow for the attribution of freedom and moral\nresponsibility to them. This power of consent or withholding of\nconsent is further developed in the following: \nInterestingly enough, this power of the soul is described as not being\na power that produces modifications, which is an expression\nof Malebranche’s attempt to reconcile the positing of such\npowers in minds with his occasionalism about minds. That is, insofar\nas all powers that bring about changes in modes are in God, and merely\nnon-modal powers are in the creature, then Malebranche seems to be\nthinking that such non-modal powers of creatures are consistent with\nhis occasionalism. This, however, raises the question of whether such\nnon-modal powers are robust enough to anchor the free will and moral\nresponsibility of thinking\n substances.[34] \nIf we bracket the issue of how to render a full-blown occasionalism\nwith a sufficiently robust account of free will, then, as we have\nhopefully seen, the CCC argument is a fairly powerful argument as an\nargument for global occasionalism. \nWe end with a brief look at what “ occasional causes” are\nand how occasionalists understand “occasional\n causation.”[35]\n As we saw at the beginning of this entry, an occasionalist is someone\nwho, within a relevant domain, denies that creaturely causes are\ngenuine causes and holds that the unique genuine cause is God. This\ndenial of the causal efficacy of creatures, however, is consistent\nwith the recognition that some creaturely events and their types stand\nin peculiar relations, noteworthy enough to deserve a special status\nin the causal story of the world. Most prominent, particularly to\nthose interested in causation, are the robust regularities found in\nthe world, the very regularities that initiated our interest in causal\nconnections in the first place. These regularities are of interest to\nthe occasionalist as well, and it is for these regularities that the\noccasionalist employs the notion of occasional causes. Here is how\nMalebranche describes them:  \nAn occasional cause here is described as determining God “to act\nin such and such a manner in such and such a situation.” The\ncentral idea is that when an event of a certain type occurs, a\ndistinct event of a different type is brought about by divine\nvolition, such that a regular, law-like relation holds between two\ntypes of events, each exemplified by the occasional cause and its\neffect respectively. A common misunderstanding about occasionalism is\nthat if it is divine causality that anchors what occurs in the world,\nsuch grounding of natural events will render their occurrences rather\nirregular and haphazard. Perhaps it is the unpredictability of our own\nvolitional activity that precipitates this assumption that volitions\ndo not provide stable foundations for regularity. As we seen above,\nhowever, occasionalists accept the regularity of natural events as\nmuch as any realist about creaturely powers. The link that allows\noccasionalists to endorse regularity while grounding such regularity\nin divine volitions is their view that the divine volitions in\nquestion have a stable, law-like structure, thus being general in\ncharacter. Here again is Malebranche: \nWhen my body is injured, I subsequently feel pain. This pain,\naccording to Malebranche, is due to the “general and efficacious\nlaw of the union of soul and body” that God has established,\nand, thus, this injury is the occasional cause of the pain I feel.\nOccasional causes, as noted earlier, are just those events of a\ncertain type on the occurrence of which God wills to be bring about an\ninstance of distinct, yet commonly conjoined, event type, such that\nthese two types of events are naturally correlated with robust\nregularity. In fact, on the occasionalist scheme almost every event\nthat occurs in our world will turn out to be both an occasional cause\nand effect in that it will be part of the vast network of regularities\nthat we observe. That is, any given effect that follows from an\noccasional cause will, in turn, most likely be the occasional cause\nfor the following, subsequent effect. Thus, even on the occasionalist\npicture, there are hardly any events that fail to be part of this\nnetwork of causal regularities, and such regularity is possible\nbecause the overwhelming majority of events in the world are guided by\nGod’s general volitions, which are determined by general laws that\nhave been established by God. Note that this last\nqualification—that the general laws themselves are established\nby God—marks a critical difference between an occasionalist like\nMalebranche and an Aristotelian essentialist about creaturely causal\npowers. For the latter holds that certain effects follow necessarily\nfrom the creature’s causal essence, while Malebranche rejects such\ncausal essences and denies any such necessary connection that holds\ndirectly between a creaturely cause and\n effect.[36] \nWhat events are exceptions and do not fall under general volitions?\nThese are what the occasionalists typically identify as miraculous\nevents, which, for Malebranche, would be those cases wherein God acts\nby particular volitions. If an event occurs without its typical\npreceding occasion and in violation of the general law known to us,\nthen such an event we are able to judge as occurring due to God\nexercising his particular volition. Returning to Malebranche’s\nown example, when “a body begins to move without being pushed by\nanother, or without changes in the will of some mind,” here God\ncan be said to move this body by a particular volition. However, even\nin such instances, it is important to note that we should not think\nthat God is rejecting or overpowering some built-in essences within\nthe creature and conjoining some event inherently foreign to them. In\nfact, as we have seen, one motivation behind the occasionalist project\nwas to avoid this picture of God having to act against natural\ntendencies in miraculous cases, a picture that occasionalist charged\nthe Aristotelian essentialists to be committed to. For the\noccasionalists, the general laws themselves are established by God\njust as the particular volitions are exercised by God, hence there is\nno struggle or conflict between divine volition and the results of\ndivine creation in either case. There is no need for God to overpower\nhis creation in cases of miraculous activity. Thus, on this\nunderstanding of occasional causes, we can see that any occasion in\nprinciple could be the antecedent event in God’s exercise of a\nparticular volition, resulting in a miracle, and any antecedent event\nin actual miraculous events could have been conjoined to a general\nvolition. Creaturely states are at most occasions in that they are\ndevoid of causal natures or essences.  \nGiven this understanding of occasional causation, occasionalism, as we\nnoted in the beginning, can be understood as a metaphysics of\ncausation that promotes a more discriminating attitude toward what are\ntypically taken to be causal interactions operative in this world. The\noccasionalist resists a blanket, univocal understanding of these\napparent causal interactions, and argues that we distinguish two types\nof relations in the world, that of genuine causation and that of\noccasional causation, wherein the latter relations are ultimately and\nfundamentally grounded in the former.
