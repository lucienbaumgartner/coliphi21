Gamete donation occupies an interesting position within\nbioethics, having something in common both with other forms of\ndonation (blood and organs, for example) and with\nreproductive technologies not involving donation (ranging\nfrom IVF through to more controversial areas like cloning, embryo\nselection, and genetic modification). It also shares some features\nwith adoption and surrogacy, practices which also\n(arguably at least) involve the transfer or delegation of parental\nduties and rights. (See entries on\n cloning,\n eugenics,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n the donation of human organs, and\n parenthood and procreation.)\n \n\nConceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable ‘lens’\nthrough which to re-examine questions such as:\n\nWhat grounds parental rights and responsibilities?\n\nWhat rights and obligations do parents have regarding their\nchildren (actual or future) and to what extent can these be\ntransferred or delegated?\n\nIt also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as:\n\nShould there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm\ndonor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the\nbasis for these?\n\nDo donor-conceived children have a right to know about their\norigins? Should donor anonymity be permitted?\n\nWhat ‘matching’ and selection decisions should the\nprospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about\ndonors should they be given?\n\nIs it acceptable to ‘buy and sell’ gametes? And is\nthat any different morally from arrangements in which women are\noffered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for\nsome of their eggs?\n\nSuch questions are the subject of this entry.\n\n\nBefore proceeding, however, two matters of definition and scope should\nbe noted.\n\n\nFirst, this entry focuses on the donation of human gametes for\nreproductive purposes, as opposed to for research. The rationale\nfor this is that most of the interesting ethical and philosophical\nissues here concern, in one way or another, the moral and social\nrelations between the donors, parents (recipients), and children\ncreated, and these do not generally arise in the research context. The\nmain exception to this is\n section 4 (Payment)\n where similar questions of consent, exploitation, and harm have been\nraised in both research and treatment contexts (Baylis & McLeod\n2007).\n\n\nSecond, there is the question of what counts as (reproductive) gamete\ndonation. At least for the purposes of this entry, we intend the term\n‘gamete donation’ to apply to those situations in which\n–\n\n A (the donor) voluntarily provides B (the recipient\nor recipients) with gametes (paid or otherwise); and\n\n A expects that and/or intends that B will use those\ngametes to create C (a child or some children);\nand\n\n Both A and B expect that and/or intend that\nA will not become a social or legal parent of\nC.\n\nSince the rights and responsibilities that attach to parenthood are\ngenerally thought to be very weighty, determining whether or not\ngamete donors are parents is a question that has attracted much\nattention. While there is considerable overlap here with the\nliterature on the ultimate basis of parenthood more generally (see\nentry on\n parenthood and procreation)\n questions about parenthood in the context of gamete donation have\ngarnered much specific attention. One important element that\ndistinguishes the gamete donation literature examining parenthood from\nmore general discussions of parental rights and responsibilities is\nthe debate over the transferability of parental\nresponsibilities. If transferring parental responsibility is easily\npossible, then determining whether gamete donors are included amongst\ntheir offspring’s initial parents might not be of great\npragmatic importance. In addition to the debate about parental\nresponsibilities, some others suggest that gamete donors have certain\nnon-parental responsibilities towards their offspring. \nA common starting point for the claim that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is the intuition that individuals who\nreproduce by accident, due to faulty contraception for example,\npossess parental responsibilities for their genetic children (Weinberg\n2008; Nelson 1999; Fuscaldo 2006; Blustein 1997). The strength of this\nintuition is used as motivation for adopting a view that ascribes\nparental responsibilities on the basis of causal involvement in the\ncreation of a child (causal views) rather than a view that ascribes\nparental responsibilities only to those who voluntarily assent to them\n(voluntarist views). Many authors who argue that gamete donors are\nparents proceed by offering a theoretical justification for this\nintuition, then apply this justification to gamete provision.  \nFor instance, Nelson argues that our common-sense understanding of\nmoral responsibility is what best explains our intuitions about\nparenthood in unintentional pregnancy.  On this common-sense view,\nindividuals are morally responsible for the consequences of their free\nactions when (1) their actions are sufficient to bring about those\nconsequences, and (2) their actions are causally proximate to the\nconsequence in question. Nelson further argues that gamete donors’\ncausal involvement in creating children does not significantly depart\nfrom that of unintentional parents (or at least not in morally\nrelevant respects) and therefore that donors are equally parents\n(Nelson 1999, 2014).  Fuscaldo similarly argues that parental\nresponsibility in cases of accidental pregnancy is best explained by\nappeal to our standard account of moral responsibility, but argues\nthat the standard account holds individuals morally responsible for\nthe foreseeable consequences of their free actions. Since bringing\nchildren into existence is a foreseeable consequence of donating\ngametes, gamete donors have a moral responsibility to care for the\nchildren they help create (Fuscaldo 2006).  \nAnother route is to argue that reproduction is an unusual kind of\ncase, and that special rules apply when determining what moral\nresponsibilities arise from involvement in it. An example is what\nBenatar calls ‘reproductive autonomy’. Benatar argues that\nindividuals’ reproductive autonomy both entitles them to make\nreproductive decisions, and requires them to take responsibility for\nthe consequences of those decisions. He argues that this is a special\nfeature of our ability to reproduce that is not reducible to genetics\nor causality, and results in a presumptive duty to parent the children\ncreated from our gametes. This, he argues, best explains why parental\nresponsibility arises in accidental pregnancy cases. Though in some\ncircumstances the presumptive duty to parent one’s genetic\nchildren may be overridden, this is not the case for most instances of\ngamete provision (Benatar 1999). \nOne worry about Benatar’s argument is that its approach relies\ntoo heavily on stipulating that unique moral features attach to\nreproduction, and so risks begging the question. However, Rivka\nWeinberg offers an argument for a similar conclusion, but on more\ngeneral grounds. Weinberg argues that when individuals exercise\ncontrol over materials that pose grave risks to others (what she calls\n‘hazardous materials’) they are liable for the\nconsequences that arise, regardless of the precautions they take. As\nan example, she argues that an owner of a pet lion is liable for\ndamage done by the lion, regardless of the precautions the owner takes\nto keep the lion contained. Calling this the “Hazmat\nTheory”, Weinberg argues that it applies to gametes because\ntheir use can have morally weighty consequences for third\nparties—namely the children that may result from the union of\ngametes. Consequently, Weinberg argues that gamete providers are\nobliged to care for the children that result from the voluntary use of\ntheir gametes (Weinberg 2008). \nImportantly, none of the preceding arguments in favour of including\ngamete donors amongst a child’s parents rely on genetic\nrelatedness. It is not the genetic similarity between gamete donors\nand their biological offspring that is doing the work, but rather\nconsiderations about the kind of thing gametes are (things that can\ncreate people) and the activity that gamete donors engage in with\nthem. \nVelleman (2005, 2008), however, has argued that being parented by\nclose genetic relations is of great importance to the wellbeing of\nchildren, and that for this reason we ought to be sceptical of the\nease with which society permits the separation of social from\nbiological parenthood.  \nBayne argues that gamete donors are not parents because both causal\nand genetic accounts of parental responsibility suffer from a problem\nof regress, and thus fail as plausible grounds for parenthood (Bayne\n2003). For instance, if a person is the parent of the individuals\nproduced via their gametes, as they are according to Benatar, then it\nis unclear why parenthood should stop at the gamete donor and not the\ndonor’s parents, or great grandparents etc. This because the\ndonor is the product of the gametes of these previous generations.\nSimilarly, on a causal account like the one offered by Nelson, if a\nchild was caused to exist by the actions of a sperm donor, then why\nnot think that the person whose actions are responsible for the\nexistence of the sperm donor is similarly a parent of the child. \nIt is however unclear whether Bayne’s criticism in fact applies\nto Nelson and Benatar’s views. Nelson does appeal to causal\nproximity, but explicitly rejects the view that merely being part of\nthe causal chain resulting in the creation of a child is sufficient\nfor parenthood (Nelson 1991, 53). Benatar’s view does not rest\non the genetic similarity between gamete donors and their children,\nbut rather the autonomy individuals exercise over reproductive\nmaterials. While Bayne highlights a problem that causal accounts must\nresolve—namely where to draw the line in the causal\nchain—he does not show that Nelson and Benatar’s view\nsuccumbs to this problem. \nA better route for challenging the view that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is to question whether\nresponsibilities of this kind arise from causal involvement in\nprocreation. For instance, Brake (2005, 2010) argues that while\ncertain obligations towards children might arise as a result of causal\ninvolvement in procreation, it is a mistake to think that this\nincludes the particularly intimate and weighty obligations subsumed in\nparenthood. More will be said about this argument in\n section 1.4. \nBayne (2003), Fuscaldo (2006), and Benatar (1999) all argue that even if gamete\ndonors have parental responsibilities for their offspring initially,\nthis does not mean that these cannot be transferred to others. In\nfact, there are circumstances where such transfers occur and we do not\nthink they are problematic at all—adoption being one example.\nFuscaldo (2006) argues that it is commonplace for parents to transfer\nsome of their responsibilities to others (like the responsibility to\neducate their children to teachers, for example) and so we should not\nthink it strange for individuals who are initially parents to transfer\nall their responsibilities to willing and competent others\n(see also O’Neill 1979). Though Benatar (1999) holds that gamete donors\noften fail to take sufficient care when transferring their\nresponsibilities to others, under the right conditions, transferring\nparental responsibilities is both permissible and possible.  \nBy contrast, some authors argue that such a transfer of responsibility\nis not possible, or at least not ethically permissible, at all\n(Velleman 2008; Weinberg 2008; Nelson 1991; Brandt forthcoming). For\ninstance, Velleman (2008) argues that while adoption is acceptable\nwhen there is no other means to provide a child with an adequate life,\nthis should not be confused with the intentional creation of children\nwhose social link to their genetic parents will be severed. Because\nVelleman believes that preserving the social connection between\nchildren and genetic parents is of great importance for the wellbeing\nof children, he argues that, unless there is pressing reason to do\notherwise, children ought to be parented by their genetic\nprogenitors. \nWeinberg (2008) argues that parental responsibilities cannot be\ntransferred in full because certain kinds of intimate responsibilities\ncan only be fulfilled by particular individuals: individuals in the\nright intimate relationship. For instance, a parent cannot transfer\nthe obligation to support her child by attending a music or dance\nrecital to a stranger. Since Weinberg thinks that gamete donors have a\nresponsibility to love their children and that, because responsibility\nto love a particular person is paradigmatic of the kind that cannot be\ntransferred, at least some donor responsibilities are not\ntransferable. \nTaking a slightly different approach, Brandt argues that much of the\ndebate regarding the transferability of parental responsibilities\nfailed to distinguish delegation from transfer. He argues that the\nimportant difference between the two is that in the former, delegators\nremain responsible for ensuring that the responsibilities get\nfulfilled, and thus are not fully alienated from them. He suggests\nthat, when re-examined with this distinction in mind, the main\nexamples offered in favour of the transfer of parental\nresponsibilities in fact only support the permissibility of their\ndelegation (Brandt forthcoming). For instance, parents have a duty to\nensure that their children are in fact receiving proper education from\ntheir teachers, and thus Fuscaldo’s example provides a case for\nthe delegation but not transfer of parental responsibilities. \nMany authors argue that responsibilities arise for gamete donors that\ndo not rest on their status as parents. Bayne (2003) suggests that,\nthough gamete donors are not parents, they may have the responsibility\nto prevent certain kinds of lives from coming about. For instance,\nthey may be obliged to refrain from creating children with severe\ncongenital diseases that would result in a ‘life not worth\nliving’. Many authors (Bayne 2003; Archard 2010; Porter 2014;\nFuscaldo 2006; O’Neill 1979) also think that gamete donors must\ntake steps to ensure that their offspring will be parented in at least\na minimally acceptable manner. \nWhile the responsibilities mentioned above can be fulfilled prior to\nproviding gametes, some authors think that certain non-parental\nresponsibilities continue to exist after a child has been created,\neven if appropriate precautionary steps (e.g. choosing intending\nparents carefully, screening gametes for congenital diseases, etc.)\nwere taken. For instance, Brake (2010) argues that gamete donors might\nhave an ongoing duty to ensure that their biological offspring receive\nat least a minimum level of care (she calls these ‘procreative\ncosts’) but that this should not be confused with parental\nresponsibilities, which are more intimate and more morally weighty in\nnature. However, Prusak (2011) argues that the gap between\nBrake’s ‘procreative costs’ and parental\nresponsibility is not as pronounced as it initially appears. Like\nBrake, Porter (2012, 2014) similarly argues that gamete donors must\ncontinue to take steps to ensure that their offspring have a decent\nlife, though they are not necessarily obligated to parent their\noffspring themselves.  \nAnother kind of non-parental obligation that gamete donors might have\nis to remain open to the possibility of forming relationships with\ntheir biological offspring, though this openness does not entail an\nobligation to in fact form such relationships (Little 1999). \nIn addition to obligations that focus on the health of potential\noffspring and the competence of intending parents, another question is\nwhether there ought to be limits on the number of offspring that can\nbe created from a single gamete provider. This question is most\nsignificant in sperm provision because of the relative ease of\ncreating large numbers of children from the gametes provided by a\nsingle individual. Three major justifications have been offered for\noffspring limits: the risk of accidental consanguineous relationships,\nthe likelihood of convoluted social relationships with kin, and\ngeneral social discomfort with large offspring numbers (Wright 2016).\nWhile the last might not be a plausible justification on its own, it\nis worth mentioning because in practice such concerns have had an\ninfluential role in the imposition of offspring limits (Deech 1998;\nWarnock Report 1984). \nLimiting offspring numbers in order to reduce the likelihood of\naccidental consanguineous relationships between offspring of the same\ndonor was initially proposed by individuals concerned about possible\nhealth risks to subsequent generations (Curie-Cohen 1980). Recent work\nhas been undertaken in an attempt to quantify these risks and the\nincreased risk of congenital disease that such relationships pose (De\nBoer et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2007). While the increased risk of\nunintentional consanguinity is dependent on the size of the population\nserved by a sperm bank, the risk is lower than might be initially\nthought. For instance, models developed by the Dutch suggest that an\noffspring limit of up to 25 would not result in any significant\nincreased risk, given their particular demographic makeup (De Boer et\nal. 1995). In addition to the increased risk of congenital disease,\nthere is a risk of psychological harm for individuals that discover\nthey have unwittingly entered into a consanguineous relationship,\ngiven the associated social taboos (Wright 2016). Furthermore, there\nmay be legal complications if an accidental consanguineous marriage is\ndiscovered after the fact (Cahn 2009a). One way to mitigate these\nrisks without imposing offspring limits would be to increase openness\nin gamete provision, including actively informing individuals about\nthe identity of their genetic siblings. However, even in the absence\nof such measures there is little agreement about how the risks\nassociated with consanguinity should be translated into offspring\nlimits, especially given the broad freedom individuals are generally\nafforded in their reproductive decisions (Wright 2016; HFEA 2011). \nThe main worry in relation to social relationships with kin is that\ninitiating and maintaining relationships with progenitors and/or\ngenetic siblings is made much more challenging if there are large\nnumbers to accommodate. The extent to which this justifies offspring\nlimits will depend on the importance placed on such relationships and,\nas noted previously, there is much disagreement about this.\nFurthermore, some empirical research into kin relationships following\ngamete provision has found that having large numbers of genetic\nsiblings is not necessarily an impediment to the formation of\nmeaningful relationships (Freeman, Jadva, & Slutsky 2016). \nThere is general agreement that prospective parents ought to be able\nto enter into arrangements with gamete donors that specify certain\nkinds of engagement between the donor and future child, such as the\nprovision of detailed biographical information or even ongoing\ncontact. However, gamete donation arrangements in which there is an\nexpectation that donors remain anonymous are more contentious. While\nsome intending parents and donors prefer anonymous donation, there has\nbeen much discussion about the ethical permissibility of such\narrangements.  \nAdvocates of children’s rights to access identifying information\nabout their donors generally defend their view by pointing to the\npossible harms that might arise in the absence of such information,\nand/or the purported fundamental right that individuals have to\ninformation about their origins (Ravitsky 2010, 2012; Velleman 2005,\n2008; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001; Blyth & Farrand\n2004). Possible harms considered include psychological distress,\ndamaged familial relationships, reduced self-knowledge, and incomplete\nor incorrect medical records. Those who favour permitting anonymous\ndonation argue that it is a mistake to place a great deal of\nimportance on genetic origins, and question both the severity of the\nharms caused by anonymous donation and whether the existence of such\nharms even constitute an argument against donor-anonymity\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). \nThe philosophical debate takes place within a background of changing\nlegal norms governing donor anonymity (Clark 2011; Frith 2001;\nBernstein 2010). While maintaining donor anonymity was once common\npractice (and is mandatory in certain jurisdictions, such as France)\nthere has been a strong trend towards enshrining in law\ndonor-conceived children’s rights to access identifying\ninformation about their donor, at least once they reach the age of\nmajority (Clark 2011; Frith 2001; Bernstein 2010; Brunet &\nKunstmann 2013).  \nOne reason for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is the distress\nthat advocates of disclosure claim many donor-conceived children\nsuffer as a consequence of the absence of identifying information\nabout their biological progenitors. This distress is sometimes\nreferred to as ‘genealogical bewilderment’, a term\noriginally coined in reference to the distress experienced by\nadoptees, and its symptoms are said to include difficulty developing a\npersonal identity that feels genuine, anguish about not knowing the\nidentity of one’s genetic relations, and an obsession with\ntrying to find out information about one’s genetic relations\n(Sants 1964; Cahn 2009b). Advocates of the right to know point to both\nscientific studies and general social observations, such as the rise\nof services to help donor-conceived individuals find their biological\nrelations, as evidence of the severity of this harm (McWhinnie 2001;\nFrith 2001; Ravitsky 2010). \nA related argument is that donor-conceived individuals are denied an\nimportant good if they are not given access to detailed information\nabout their biological relations. More than simply satisfying\ncuriosity, some argue that knowledge about one’s biological\nrelations (especially through contact) is important for self-knowledge\n(Velleman 2005, 2008). On this view, while a name and biographical\ndetails may not replace being reared by biological relations, they do\nat least provide donor-conceived individuals with some\ninformation, and make contact later in life possible.  \nHowever, both these arguments have been challenged on empirical and\nphilosophical grounds. While some studies do indeed show that a subset\nof donor-conceived individuals suffer psychological distress from not\nknowing the identity of their progenitors, others show that such\ndistress is not common, and generally not particularly severe\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Studies also show that early\ndisclosure helps children incorporate the fact that they were\ndonor-conceived into their identity and sense of self, thus helping\nthem avoid some of psychological harms associated with genealogical\nbewilderment (Golombok et. al. 2002). Advocates of the permissibility\nof donor anonymity thus argue that there is no clear evidence that\ndonor anonymity is likely to result in severe harm to offspring.  \nAdditionally, some argue that any psychological harm that does arise\nis likely socially constructed. They point to studies showing that\nindividuals who are unaware that they were donor-conceived do no worse\nthan their peers when it comes to psychological wellbeing\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Consequently, they argue that any\npsychological harms experienced by donor-conceived individuals arise\nin virtue of the social importance placed on biological ties rather\nthan any ‘necessary’ deficit arising from being reared by\nindividuals who are not genetic relations. Similar arguments have also\nbeen raised in response to Velleman’s views regarding the value\nof contact with genetic relations for self-knowledge (Haslanger\n2009). \nIf the psychological harms arising as a consequence of donor-anonymity\nare socially constructed, then prohibiting anonymous gamete donation\nmay exacerbate these harms. Such a prohibition could further reify the\nimportance of biological ties (sometimes referred to as\n‘biologism’), which is what gives rise to the harms in the\nfirst place (Melo-Martín 2014; Leighton 2014; Haslanger 2009). \nAnother reason offered for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is\nthat it prevents donor-conceived individuals from making health\ndecisions informed by family medical history. If individuals are not\ninformed about being donor-conceived, they risk making medical\ndecisions on the incorrect assumption that their social family’s\nmedical background reflects their own. And even if such individuals\nare informed that they are donor-conceived, they still suffer from an\nabsence of medical information that is generally available to others\n(Ravitsky 2012). While it is true that medical information could be\nprovided at the time of donation in a manner that preserves the\nanonymity of the donor, some argue that, as our understanding of\ncongenital disease changes, new information is likely to become\nrelevant (Leighton 2014; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001).\nAdditionally, certain relevant medical conditions might only become\napparent long after the donation. While a system could be put in place\nfor donors to update their medical information, some argue that such a\nsystem would likely be too cumbersome for donor-conceived individuals\nto receive the medical information they need in a timely fashion\n(McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001). \nHowever, those who defend the permissibility of donor anonymity argue\nthat the value of medical history is overstated, and will become less\nimportant as we move towards personalized medicine (Melo-Martín\n2014). In fact, in a report recommending against permitting\ndonor anonymity, the UK’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics stated\nthat medical interests alone were not sufficient grounds for\nprohibiting donor anonymity (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2013). \nAnother argument against donor anonymity is that secrecy about origins\nhas the potential to damage the relationships between donor-conceived\nchildren and their social parents, especially in cases where the\nsocial parent(s) know the identity of the gamete donor(s) Some argue\nthat the strain of having to ‘keep the secret’ is a cause\nof stress for social parents, and that this stress has a negative\nimpact on familial wellbeing (Landau 1998). A potentially more\nsignificant source of family tension is accidental disclosure,\nespecially when donor-conceived children are older. In this latter\ncase, several harms might arise, and may be greatly exacerbated if\nchildren were not aware that they were donor-conceived. Children might\ndevelop feelings of distrust towards their social parents, and may\nhave difficulty incorporating facts about their genetic history into\ntheir personal identity (Turner & Coyle 2000). \nWhile harms caused by both secrecy and accidental disclosure can be\nmitigated to some extent without making identifiable information\navailable, by simply disclosing to children at a young age that they\nare donor-conceived for example, some argue that more openness is\nbetter for familial unity, and that providing children with an\nopportunity to find out the identity of their donors (even if that is\ndelayed until they are older) is usually best (Nuffield Council on\nBioethics 2009). \nThose who favour permitting anonymous gamete donation argue that, at\nbest, the evidence suggests a slight improvement in familial wellbeing\nwhen information about a donor is provided along with disclosure about\nthe method of their conception. Families in which children do not have\naccess to identifying information about their donors still report good\nhome-life and have positive relationships with their parents\n(Melo-Martín 2014). Thus, while non-disclosure might not be optimal,\nit is probably not so harmful that it falls outside of the domain of\nparental discretion. Furthermore, if the harms are socially\nconstructed, as some have argued is the case in genealogical\nbewilderment, then we may have additional reasons for concluding that\nthe harms to family cohesion do not justify prohibiting anonymous\ndonation, since doing so would only further contribute to biologism\n(Melo-Martín 2014). \nThe arguments against donor anonymity considered thus far focus on\nharms that might arise as a result of the practice. Another kind of\nargument is that individuals have a fundamental right to knowledge\nabout their origins. In the legal literature, some have argued that\nthe UN’s Declaration on The Rights of The Child and the European\nConvention on Human Rights establishes individuals’ rights to\ninformation about the circumstances of their conception, including\ninformation about their progenitors (Blyth & Farrand 2004). Apart\nfrom appeals to such declarations of rights, some attempts have been\nmade to motivate recognition of a fundamental right to know via appeal\nto other fundamental goods. \nOne strategy is to tie the right to know to the right to an identity.\nHere the argument is that individuals require genuine facts about\ntheir biological history in order to develop a proper personal\nidentity (Ravitsky 2010). However, one response is that that while\nchildren have a right to an identity, they do not have a right to a\nparticular kind of identity, such as one based primarily on\nhistorical biological ties (Allen 1996). Another route is to argue\nthat children have a right to be respected, and that hiding facts\nabout their origins is a form of deception that we ought not permit\n(Freeman 1996). However, deception about origins is only a severe form\nof disrespect if we think that biological ties are important in the\nfirst place, and thus this argument risks begging the question. \nOffspring’s ability to access adoption records have oscillated\nquite substantially over the past century and a half, even within the\nsame jurisdiction (Samuels 2000). More recently, regulatory structures\nhave shifted in favour of providing adoptees with a legal right to\naccess identifying information about their progenitors (Besson 2007,\nHildebrand 1999). In such jurisdictions, some have argued that,\nbecause gamete donation is sufficiently similar to adoption,\nregulatory consistency demands that anonymous gamete donation be\nprohibited as well (Pratten v.  British Columbia (Attorney\nGeneral) 2012 BCCA 480; Chisholm 2012; Cahn 2009c – see\nOther Internet Resources). While this parity argument only goes so far\nin the absence of philosophical justification for prohibiting\nanonymous adoption (mere consistency could conversely be achieved by\npermitting anonymous adoption) it does give pause to examine the\nrelevant similarities between the two practices. \nThe core of the parity argument is that in both adoption and gamete\ndonation, children are reared by individuals other than their genetic\nprogenitors. If we think that access to information about genetic\nprogenitors is important enough to be elevated to the status of a\nright in adoption, then we ought to extend the same right to\ndonor-conceived individuals as well.  \nIn response, Leighton has argued that there are important disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation such that there may be no\ninconsistency in prohibiting anonymity in one case but not the other\n(Leighton 2014). For instance, adoptees are generally relinquished by\ntheir initial parent(s), and are often not raised by either of their\ngenetic parents. In the case of gamete donation there is no similar\nrelinquishing of parenthood, and often one of the genetic parents is\nalso a social parent. These differences may very well result in\ndivergences in the experiences of adoptees and donor-conceived\nindividuals. For instance, adoptees might feel abandoned by their\ninitial parents, and be curious about why they were relinquished,\nsomething that is unlikely to be the case in gamete donation.\nFurthermore, Leighton argues that since adoption has a history of\nstigmatization in the West while gamete donation has no such history,\nthere is good reason to think that the psychological impact of\nanonymous adoption on adoptees will be different from the\npsychological impact of anonymous gamete donation on donor-conceived\nindividuals (Leighton 2014).  \nWhile simply demonstrating that there are relevant disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation does not show that anonymity is\npermissible in the latter case but not the former, it does show that\nit is not outright inconsistent to have different policies governing\nanonymity for each.  \nRecipients of donated gametes often wish to have some say in what\ntheir donor is ‘like’. The characteristics made available\nto inform donor selection decisions differ greatly dependent on both\nthe countries and clinics in which such choices are made. However,\nsuch information tends to include medical, morphological, and\nbiographical information similar to that found on dating websites,\nsuch as hair colour, eye colour, ethnicity, educational attainment,\njob type, hobbies, and religion. \nFew commentators suggest that recipient-parents should be barred\ncompletely from accessing information about prospective donors, but\nneither is it generally assumed that they should be afforded\nunfettered liberty to choose their donors’ characteristics.\nThus, the debate in this area tends to focus on where the line between\nmorally acceptable and unacceptable selection practices lies. \nThree main categories of motivation underlie donor selection\ndecisions. \nThe first is selection against donors posing a threat to the physical\nwellbeing of pregnant women. This form of selection is ubiquitous such\nthat the barring of donors with sexually transmissible diseases such\nas HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis is mandated by national and\ninternational guidelines on gamete donation (see, for example HFE Act\n2008: s. T52 – see Other Internet Resources). This motivation for\nselection is widely seen as morally unproblematic and will, for this\nreason, be largely ignored here. \nThe second and third categories of motivation, termed here, selection\nfor ‘matching’ and selection for ‘design’ are,\nunlike the first, based on parental and/or societal preferences or\nvalues. In practice, most donor selection decisions will fall into\nboth categories, but a theoretical distinction is nonetheless made\nbetween the two in the philosophical literature.  \nSelection for ‘matching’ is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child who bears a similarity to the recipient parents.\nThus, gamete donors are selected (or deselected) by reference the\nextent to which their physical (and sometimes social and\npsychological) characteristics match those of recipient parents. As\nBraverman and Frith (2014) note, the aim of this practice is often:\n \nto enable secrecy and concealment of gamete donation. This practice\nincorporates a popular knowledge of genetics and enables the child to\n‘pass’ as a naturally conceived child. This is an attempt\nto avoid overt ‘difference’ between child and couple and\nwhen a good match is achieved the donor disappears from view.\n(Braverman & Frith 2014: 135) \nThere may however, be aims other than secrecy and concealment. These\nmay have their basis in concerns regarding compatibility (wanting our\nchildren to be ‘like us’ and to ‘fit in’)\n(Ruddick 2000), premised on physical or psychological desire (we often\nchoose our reproductive partners because they possess characteristics\nthat please us), or even with the aim of avoiding offence - a member\nof a couple may be offended if his/her partner prefers a donor with\ncharacteristics markedly different from his/her own (Pennings 2000).\nImportantly, matching motivations are distinguished from other\nmotivations for selection as they are limited only to desires to\nselect for donors with characteristics possessed by one/both intended\nsocial parents and should be based only in a desire to attain\nresemblance between parent and child. \nSelection motivated by design, however, is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child with characteristics which may or may not be\npossessed by the recipient parents but which are, nonetheless, deemed\nby them (and/or society) to be desirable (and often advantageous).\nSuch selection may thus be performed with several aims in mind. These\ninclude but are not limited to desires to increase the life prospects\nof one’s children by preventing the birth of children with\ndisadvantageous or without advantageous characteristics, to satisfy\npreferences for a particular ‘kind of child’, or with the\neugenic aim of improving the gene pool through the selection of donors\ndeemed to possess ‘superior’ heritable traits. \nOf these two categories, a desire for matching is generally\nthought to be less morally problematic than a desire for\ndesign, since desires for familial resemblance, secrecy\n(within limits), and to avoid offence are often considered relatively\nbenign. This is not, however, to say that no critical work has been\ndone on this topic as shall be seen in\n subsection 3.3 which looks to the\nquestion of whether race-based matching and selection practices are\nmorally permissible. \nDesign-based motivations for selection, however, have been the subject\nof a great deal more debate. This discussion largely mirrors (or is\nsubsumed by) many of the discussions had regarding the ethics of\nselective reproductive technologies, such as pre-implantation and\npre-natal genetic diagnosis, and such topics as sex selection and\nhuman enhancement (see entries on\n pregnancy, birth & medicine,\n and\n eugenics).\n For, although in the context of gamete donor selection there are no\nembryos or fetuses involved, nor genetic manipulation performed, there\nhas been much focus on questions of: \nWith this in mind, throughout the following subsections such debates\nwill be explored in turn. \nThe desire to have a child free from disability and disease is often\nconsidered the least contentious ground for gamete donor selection.\nParents and prospective parents, after-all, tend to want the best for\ntheir children and diseases and disabilities can make the attainment\nof a ‘good life’ life harder. Given this, and the fact\nthat donor selection, unlike other forms of selective reproduction,\nraises few thorny questions regarding women’s rights over their\nown bodies and the moral permissibility of abortion or the destruction\nof embryos, the dominant position among philosophers regarding gamete\nselection for the purpose of disability avoidance is one of\npermissiveness (see for example: Robertson 1994; Glover et\nal. 1989; Glover 2006; Strong 1997; Bennett 2001; Wilkinson\n2010). Robertson (1994) sums up this view well when he states: \nThe desire not to have a child with serious defects is not itself\nimmoral, and actions to avoid such a reproductive outcome should be\nrespected as an important aspect of procreative liberty. The question\nthen is what means to achieve that goal are acceptable…\nPreconception selection by voluntary selection of mates or gametes\nraises the fewest problems… Concern with the genetic fitness of\na mate may not be romantic but it is rational if one is concerned\nabout the health of spouse and offspring. Mate selection should thus\nbe left to the individual. Similarly, the selection of a gamete donor\nshould be left to the couple that needs this service. (Roberson 1994:\n154) \nSome go further, arguing that donor selection for the purpose of\ndisability-avoidance is not merely permissible but, in certain\ncircumstances, obligatory (see, for example: Savulescu 2001; Savulescu\n& Kahane 2009; Harris 1985, 2002; Buchanan et al 2000; Glover\n1989; Glover 2006). Discussions regarding this matter have tended to\nfocus less on gamete donor selection and more on the selection of\nembryos and fetuses through pre-implantation and pre-natal genetic\ndiagnosis. However, as Holm and Bennett (2014) and Williams (2017)\nnote, arguments suggesting a moral obligation to select against\ndisability in these contexts apply to gamete donor selection too. \nIndeed, that this is the case can be seen clearly in the negative\nmedia reaction and public outrage directed towards a deaf couple who,\nafter deliberately conceiving a deaf child in the early 2000s via the\nuse of a 5th generation deaf sperm donor, were vilified by\nthe tabloid media and condemned by the US National Association of the\nDeaf. (For interesting and insightful commentaries on this case see\nSavulescu 2002; Spriggs 2002; Fahmy 2011.) It can also be seen in\nthe fact that many countries require that clinics screen out\npotential donors for heritable diseases prior to their inclusion on\nthe donor register. A notable example of this is the UK’s Human\nFertilisation and Embryology Act which, since 2008, has included a\nclause prohibiting the selection of gamete donors and embryos  \nthat are known to have a gene, chromosome, or mitochondrion\nabnormality involving a significant risk that a person with the\nabnormality will have or develop: (a) a serious physical or mental\ndisability, (b) a serious illness, or (c) and other serious medical\ncondition. (HFE Act 2008, s. 14(4)(9) – see Other Internet\nResources) \nYet on what grounds might such an obligation be based? Some suggest\nthat a moral basis for such an obligation may be found by focusing\non the interests of and/or the rights of the children that will result\nfrom our procreative decisions (see Davis 2001 for a\nrights-focused approach). Arguments falling into this category thus\nfocus on person-affecting reasons, picking out the harms or limits to\nopportunity associated with certain disabilities as providing good\nreason to select against donors with traits liable to result in such\nharms and limits to opportunity. Such an approach is intuitive.\nHowever, given the conclusions of the Non-Identity Problem (see entry\non\n the non-identity problem),\n many question the logic of appeals to the interests of the child\ncreated in all but cases of the most severe disabilities. For, as it\nis generally held that a life with a disease or disability is better\nthan no life at all, and selection decisions alter who it is that\ncomes to exist rather than the prospects of determinate future\npersons, a focus on the interests of future children cannot ground\nsuch an obligation (Bennett 2009; Parfit 1984; Parker 2007; Robertson\n1994). \nOthers suggest that although the objects of our procreative efforts\nmay not be harmed by being born with a disability prospective parents\nmay nevertheless have good moral reason to select against disability\nin their offspring on the basis of other considerations. These include\nappeals to the interests of others whose interests may be affected by\nour reproductive decisions such as existing children and other\ndependents (Roberts 2009) and taxpayers in countries with socialized\nmedical and welfare systems (Heyd 1995; Fahmy 2011; Rakowski 2002;\nWilliams 2017); appeals\nto the claim that to fail to take reasonable steps to prevent\ndisability in one’s future children is contrary to common\nconceptions of the good parent (Steinbock & McClamrock 1994); and\nto the suggestion that that those who fail to avoid disability in\ntheir offspring act wrongly as they deliberately or negligently choose\nto create a state of affairs that is strictly worse (in terms of some\nparticular value such as happiness/preference satisfaction) than the\nstate of affairs that could have been created had they chosen\ndifferently (Harris 1985; Parfit 1984; Glover 1989; Glover 2006). (See entry on\n eugenics\n for a more detailed treatment and criticisms of different arguments\nin support of an obligation to select against disability.) \nSuch arguments have been criticized by many who suggest that parental\nobligations to their offspring cannot be so strong as to ground an\nobligation to select against disability (Williams 2017); that  \ncomplex concepts such as the good life, the best life, and human\nflourishing, are not reducible to simple elements or constituent parts\nwhich might be identified by the testing of embryos [and selection of\nsperm donors]; (Parker 2007: 281)  \nand that appealing to impersonal harms devalues those with\ndisabilities by suggesting that their lives are worth less than those\nwithout disabilities (Asch 2003; Bennett 2009). Yet, whilst such\nauthors tend to suggest that there cannot be an obligation to select\nagainst disability, they also suggest that prospective parents should\nbe at liberty to do so. Among a number of authors associated with the\ndisability rights movement however, a different claim is made. For,\nsuch authors suggest that not only can there be no moral obligation to\nselect against disability, parental preferences to screen out disabled\ndonors are morally problematic for two reasons. \nThe first regards the messages that such preferences send about and\ntowards persons living with disabilities, ones which may be seen as\ndiscriminatory and offensive: “express[ing] a hurtful attitude\nabout and a hurtful message to people who live with\n[disabilities]” (Parens & Asch 1999: S2). \nThe second is that the desire to select against disabling genetic\ntraits is based on misinformation regarding both the severity and true\nnature of disability. In terms of severity, for example, it has been\nwidely reported that persons with disabilities tend to report good\nquality of life despite the fact that most (non-disabled) observers\nsuggest the opposite (for work on the disability paradox see Albrecht\n& Devieger 1999). Regarding the true nature of disability, it is\nclaimed that contrary to the views of many, who hold that disability\nis inherently disadvantageous, many (and, for those who take an\nextreme approach, all) of the harms associated with disability are\nsocially constructed. That is, they are often not the result of\nfailures in functioning but society’s failing to account for\neveryone when designing physical, economic, and social institutions\n(Glackin 2010). Thus, it is suggested that as disability is often not\na feature intrinsic to those who suffer it, to attempt to prevent\ndisability by preventing the existence of persons with inabilities is\nvery much akin to attempts to prevent sexism or racism by preventing\nthe births of black people and women: an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem (Asch 2003). Taken to extremes, however, social\nconstructivism is often viewed as irredeemably flawed by the academic\ncommunity and a great number of able bodied and disabled persons\nalike. Robert Kitcher expresses this well when he notes that if we\ntake a wholly social constructivist view  \nattempts to decrease the incidence of Tay-Sachs will be no different\nfrom Northern Indian sex selection or from anticipated future efforts\nto cure lesbians. (Kitcher 1996: 215) \n(See entries on\n parenthood and procreation\n &\n eugenics\n for more in depth discussion of the suggestion that they may be a\nmoral obligation to select against disability in our offspring and the\nentry\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for more information on models of disability.) \nQuestions and concerns have also been raised regarding the\nappropriateness of selection on the basis of characteristics related\nto ‘race’, such as skin, eye, and hair colour. Had gamete\ndonor selection been well known in the 1980s when discussion raged\nconcerning whether trans-racial adoption practices constituted a step\nin the right direction towards the social ideal of colour-blindness, a\nform of racial and cultural genocide, or something in between the two,\none might have expected to see similar discussions regarding donor\nselection. This however has not been the case and instead, the\nphilosophical literature on race-based selection has tended to focus\non the question of whether selection of race-based characteristics is\nappropriate at all. \nFor the most part this focus is due to contemporary debates regarding\nthe question of whether the concept of race is philosophically and\nscientifically defensible. Thus, work suggesting the removal of racial\nidentifiers on donor catalogues seems to owe a great deal to authors\nsuch as K. Anthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) who both deny\nthat race is a coherent concept and recommend discarding it entirely\n(see entry on\n race). \nFogg-Davis (2001), for example, suggests that both the practice of\nreproducing race through assisted reproduction and selecting donors on\nthe basis of different race-linked characteristics are problematic as\nthey raise two major linked ethical issues:  \none is the harm that racial stereotyping causes to individuals, and\nthe second is the public awareness that racial stereotyping is an\naccepted feature of this largely unregulated market.  \nShe suggests that those who use racial classification to inform donor\nselection decisions are saying that  \nrace is heritable and relevant to their vision of family\nstructure… that a person’s gametes are transmitters of\nracial meaning that can and should be selectively transmitted to their\nchild through the use of reproductive technologies. (Fogg-Davis 2001:\n18) \nHarris (1998) too questions the legitimacy of the desire to match\ndonors to recipient parents on the basis of race-linked\ncharacteristics such as skin tone, and hair and eye colour. He\nnotes: \nWhy do so many people firmly believe that children should be like\ntheir parents, particularly in terms of their general colour and\nracial characteristics? It is difficult not to view this desire, and\nattempts to implement it, as a form of ‘ethnic cleansing.’\nIt smacks very much of the pressure that so many societies and\ncultures have put upon their members not to ‘marry out’ or\nto put it more bluntly, not to mate with somebody of another tribe or\nrace. (Harris 1998: 21) \nOthers however suggest that there is  \nno evidence to suggest that racial prejudice accounts for why sperm\nbanks sort sperm donors according to race or why many prospective\nparents hope for a child of a particular race. (Fox 2009: 1860)  \nSuch authors suggest instead that racial preferences in gamete\ndonation are more likely to stem from a desire to replicate the family\nstructure of the biological family, to avoid deficient access to\nracial culture and consciousness, to increase their children’s\nprospects in unjust social contexts, or premised on a desire “to\nmake the donor invisible and to conform the new-founded family to the\nideal of the natural family” (Pennings 2000: 508). With this in\nmind, Fox suggests that although race-based selection should not be\ncondemned in all cases it is important to “soften the prominence\nof race in donor selection by taking measures to frustrate wholesale\nfiltering of sperm donors on the basis of race” (Fox 2009:\n1893). \nOthers still note that those who desire to select for race-linked\ncharacteristics for these ‘less objectionable’ reasons\nmust still consider the wider consequences of doing so. Agar (2004),\nfor example, when considering the question of selection for race and\nsexual orientation in the context of genetic engineering, suggests\nthat whilst the aim of increasing the life prospects of one’s\nchildren in racist and homophobic societies by selecting for\nheterosexual and light skinned offspring is not objectionable, such\npractices should not be permitted. Not only would such selection\ncollude with prejudice, constituting an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem, but it would likely also undermine attempts to change\nracist and homophobic social attitudes and practices. \nGamete donor selection may also be motivated by a desire to parent a\n‘particular kind of child’ such as where a music lover\nseeks out a concert pianist in order to increase the likelihood that\nthe future child will possess such talents, or where a couple seek out\ngamete donors with genius level IQ in order to increase the likelihood\nof rearing an academically gifted child (as with the couples who\npurchased sperm in the 1990s from the ‘repository of germinal\nchoice’) (Plotz 2006) . \nSuch cases raise a different kind of concern about whether selection,\nwhen performed in order to satisfy these kinds of preferences,\nencourages and facilitates the development of ethically troubling\nattitudes on the part of prospective parents. \nThis concern has been expressed in various different ways. Some, for\nexample, suggest that selection motivated by such desires is\nincompatible with parental virtues such as ‘acceptingness’\n(McDougall 2007), ‘openness to the unbidden’ (Sandel\n2007), and ‘unconditional love’ (Herrisone-Kelly 2007).\nThose who take this view hold onto the traditional notion of the child\nas a gift and correspondingly suggest that parents ought to care, not\nabout the traits that their children possess, but about developing a\nloving relationship with and raising whatever child they receive.\nOthers take a more Kantian line, suggesting that such these parents\nare wrongfully instrumentalising their children: treating them as a\nmeans of fulfilling parental hopes and dreams rather than as entities\nwho, once born, exist for their own sake (Davis 1997). \nYet the suggestion that a selective mentality is incompatible with\nimportant parental virtues or problematically instrumentalises\none’s future children has been the subject of some debate.\nAuthors such as Ruddick (2000) and Green (2008), challenge the\n‘maternalist assumption’ that parents  \nwho want a child should accept and welcome any child they happen to\nreceive, prepared to appreciate the child’s developing\nindividuality, however different from their own. (Ruddick 2000: 102)\n \nThey hold instead that other conceptions of parenthood can, provided\nthey are not taken to extremes, be perfectly adaptive, and crucially,\ndo not require parents to refrain from all attempts to shape the\ncharacteristics of their prospective children. They suggest that\nparents should rightly be viewed as both guardians of the\nchildren’s future interests, and ‘gardeners’ who may\nshape and raise children in line with their own preferences and\npriorities. \nOthers question whether the virtues of the prospective parent are the\nsame as those of an existing parent. For, although some hold that a\ndesire to have a hand in the characteristics of one’s future\nchildren is part of a broader desire to parent and thus requires\n“committing oneself to acting and evaluating one’s actions\nand decisions in light of the project of parenthood” (Vehmas\n2001: 439), others argue that a desire to select is not incompatible\nwith such a commitment. Kamm argues, for example, that a distinction\ncan be made between ‘caring to have’ a particular child\nand ‘caring about’ one’s future children once born\nand suggests that there is little reason to assume that the desire to\nseek out certain attributes in one’s children is incompatible\nwith parental virtues or common conceptions of the good parent. She\nnotes  \none can know that one will care about someone just as much whether or\nnot she has certain traits and yet care to have someone that has,\nrather than lacks such traits. (Kamm 2009: 113)  \nThis is echoed by Wilkinson who, discussing a hypothetical example of\ntwo prospective parents who seek to ensure the birth of a blue eyed\nchild and agree that they will put it up for adoption after birth\nshould it not possess such characteristics, notes  \nit is not the desire to select that violates the principle of\nunconditional love [or other parental virtues], but rather the plan to\nreject the child if it does not live up to expectations… it is\nentirely possible to want to select characteristics while not having\nthis problematic attitude of rejection. (Wilkinson 2010: 29) \nSome suggest however that, although selection is not necessarily\nmorally problematic, we should still be concerned that a selective\nmentality may be a precursor of conditional, as opposed to\nunconditional, love once the child is born, or to unrealistic\nexpectations and feelings of entitlement. Thus, the suggestion here is\nthat people who go to great lengths and incur great expense in\nprocuring what are, for them, the ‘perfect’ gametes, may\nbe more likely to reject or otherwise mistreat their children should\nthey fail to develop the ‘right’ capacities and interests\n(see, for example: Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). Again, however, it is not\nat all clear that the link between a selective mentality in\nreproduction and overzealous and unforgiving parenting styles is a\nnecessary one, as the majority of parents are not liable to be so\nnaïve to “presume to know what they are getting simply\nbecause they had a hand in selecting some of their child’s\ngenetic features” (Fahmy 2011: 7), or indeed that gamete donor\nselection is as likely as other more expensive and\neffective forms of selective reproduction (such as genetic\nengineering) to produce such problematic expectations and\nattitudes. \nShould gamete providers be paid? If so, should such payments be\nlimited to compensation (possibly including compensation for time and\ninconvenience)? Or is incentivising or rewarding providers also\nmorally acceptable? \nIn favour of payment, the main reason cited is increased supply, thus\nenabling recipients to have children that they wouldn’t\notherwise have had—or, where scarcity per se is not an\nissue, giving recipients more choice. In addition, supporters of\npayment cite justice (gamete providers deserve to be rewarded) and\nautonomy (providers and recipients should be allowed to contract with\neach other as they see fit). Finally, pragmatic arguments are\nsometimes offered, such as the cost of prohibition or the possibility\nof its leading to an unregulated ‘black’ or\n‘grey’ market in gametes (Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004;\nWilkinson 2013) \nSome of the arguments and issues concerning payment for gametes\nclosely resemble ones arising in other areas such as organ sale, sex\nwork, and commercial surrogacy (see entries on\n exploitation,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n feminist perspectives on sex markets,\n parenthood and procreation, and\n the sale of human organs).\n We deal with these briefly here before moving on to consider in\ngreater detail some of the more distinctive issues raised by paying\ngamete providers. The focus here is on gametes for clinical use in\nhuman reproduction, rather than gametes for research purposes,\nalthough many of the same issues also arise in a research setting. \nOne of the most obvious issues is harm or risk to the providers\n(Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004). \nIn the case of sperm, the physical risks of donating are negligible,\nbut concerns have been raised about psychosocial risks, especially if\none man is permitted to generate numerous offspring. What happens, for\nexample, if a single sperm donor produces hundreds of children and a\nsignificant proportion of those contact him years later? That could\nhave a significant impact on the man’s life (and on the welfare\nof the children, discussed below). One way of containing this risk\nwould be to limit donor offspring numbers; another would be to allow\ndonor anonymity, although that may be objectionable on other grounds\n(see our earlier discussions of donor anonymity and donor offspring\nlimits). \nProducing hundreds of children is unlikely to be a problem for egg\ndonors but, unlike sperm donors, these women do face non-negligible\nphysical risks: notably OHSS (Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome). \nAs with the organ sale debate, though, it is not clear why the\nexistence of these risks constitutes an objection to payment,\nas opposed to an objection to the whole practice of gamete\ndonation (paid or otherwise) since the risks don’t increase\nas a result of payment (Wilkinson 2013). In response to this, in the\ncase of sperm donation, it could be argued that the scenario where one\nman produces hundreds of children is much more likely to happen if\npayment is allowed, as some men seek to become ‘professional\nsperm donors’. As has been noted however it should be possible\nto neutralise this risk by enforcing donor offspring limits. \nAnother set of issues is the negative effect that payments, or\npayments above a certain level, are supposed to have on the quality of\nconsent—a concern that is closely linked to worries about\nexploitation. Financial incentives, it is argued, encourage people to\ndo things that they would not otherwise do, encourage them to do\nthings that are harmful, and make their actions, consents, and\ndecisions less likely to be autonomous and voluntary (Resnick 2001;\nSteinbock 2004; Wilkinson 2013). These arguments are more often\ndirected at paid egg donation than paid sperm donation, because the\ndirect physical risks and the sums of money involved for eggs tend to\nbe much greater. Thus, people have been concerned that vulnerable\nyoung egg donors might be lured into the egg market and then exploited\nby clinics, egg banks, or recipients. These concerns structurally\nparallel ones that people often have about commercial surrogacy and\nsex work. \nArguments of this kind are dealt with in much more detail in the\nentries on\n Exploitation,\n Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets,\n Parenthood and Procreation,\n Informed Consent, and\n The Sale of Human Organs.\n For the present, we simply note that, while the possibility of\ndefective consent and exploitation must be taken seriously in any\nsystem of paid gamete donation, there seems no reason in principle why\npaying for gametes must be exploitative, nor why it cannot be validly\nconsented to. Provided that the payment-levels are fair, and that the\nprovider’s situation, mental capacities, and access to\ninformation are all sufficiently favourable, it is hard to see\nwhy—in common with other financial transactions—gamete\nprovision can’t be validly consensual and non-exploitative. \nFinally, we note here that there is a connection between remuneration\narrangements and selection practices (discussed above). In particular,\none objection to allowing payment—or at least to the unfettered\ncommercialisation of gametes—is that it may encourage a market\nin which particular traits can, for those willing to pay a high price,\nbe aggressively selected for. For example, in the USA, young\nattractive white female egg donors attending ‘Ivy League’\nuniversities can command a higher fee for their eggs than other\ndonors—and anyone who is willing to pay can have access to those\neggs. So, anyone who regards selection practices like this as\nproblematic may also regard the commercialisation of gametes as\nproblematic inasmuch as it underpins and enables fine-grained\nselection by ‘gamete consumers’ to take place. \nWe turn now to some of the more ‘distinctive’ issues\nrelating to paying gamete donors. The first of these is the welfare of\nthe child created. While this issue is ‘distinctive’\ninasmuch as it applies only in the reproductive sphere (and so not to,\nfor example, organ sale) it does arise in other reproductive areas,\nnotably commercial surrogacy (Harris 2000). \nThe main worry here is that when donor-conceived children find out\nthat money is what primarily motivated the donor then, in some cases,\nthis will have adverse psychological effects; in the most extreme,\nthey may come to feel that they were ‘bought’ (HFEA 2011).\nWhat follows from this possibility, however, is unclear. \nTo start with, there are empirical questions about how many\ndonor-conceived people will feel this way and about how severe their\nnegative feelings (if any) are. Not all donor-conceived people have\nnegative feelings about donor motives and financial reward; some may\nnot care what their donors’ motives were. So, if this concern is\ngoing to ground an ethical argument against paying donors, a solid\nevidence base will be needed to underpin its empirical premises. \nSimilarly, there is a set of questions not so much about donors’\nactual motives are, but about what they write on their\ndonation papers, and about how and when information is conveyed to\ntheir offspring. One view is that, for the sake of the welfare of the\nchild, it would be better for donors to ‘tell a story’\n(even if not wholly accurate) that donor-conceived children will find\nmore palatable than the bare truth that the donor simply needed money.\nAnother is that if donor-conceived children are communicated with\nappropriately, honestly, and sensitively, and at an early stage then\nany problems associated with donor motives will be minimal (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2013). \nStill, let’s allow (at least for the sake of argument) that\nthese problems are insurmountable: that—whatever we do—a\nsignificant number of donor-conceived children will be substantially\nharmed by the knowledge that their donors were paid. What follows from\nthis? \nFirst, we should note that this area is subject to the implications of\nthe Non-Identity Problem (Parfit 1984). In particular, given that\n(let’s assume) many paid sperm donors would not have donated\nbut for the money, it is plausible to supposed that children who\nsuffer psychological harm when they find out about their donors\nwould not have existed if there hadn’t been payments.\nTherefore, for standard reasons relating to the Non-identity Problem,\nthey may not be harmed by the practice of payment—or at\nleast not in the usual comparative harm-to-interests sense (worse off\nthan they would otherwise have been). (See entry on the\n non-identity problem.)\n So, while there may still be a child welfare argument against\npayment, it must rely not on harm-avoidance but rather on impersonal\nwelfare considerations. \nGiven this, a lot hinges on whether payment is required to ensure an\nadequate supply of donor gametes. If it is not (if, for example, the\nreasons for paying people are quite trivial ones, such as\nadministrative convenience, or even allowing recipients more choice)\nthen the fact that payment will adversely affect donor welfare does\nlooks like a good (albeit prima facie) reason to prefer\naltruistic donation. Imagine that we have a choice between creating a\npopulation of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a\ndifferent but equally large population using altruistic donors. If (as\nwe’re allowing) the latter will have a higher quality of life\nthen there is a strong ‘impersonal’ reason, other things\nbeing equal, to prefer the latter: altruistic donation. Things look\nrather different though if the choice is instead between a population\nof donor-conceived children using paid donors or a different and\nsignificantly smaller population, for then it would be necessary\nto ‘trade off’ a higher average quality of life against\nboth (a) the fact that there are fewer lives overall and (b) any harm\ndone to prospective parents who are denied the opportunity to raise a\ndonor-conceived child. Any such moral calculation will be complex and\nthis goes to show that, in cases where payment is required to secure\nan adequate supply of gametes, this is not obviously wrong (all things\nconsidered) even if there are detrimental effects on donor-conceived\npeople’s quality of life (Wilkinson 2016). \nSome countries (notably the United Kingdom) either prohibit or\nstrictly limit payments to egg donors but allow an exception whereby\n‘egg sharers’ (women who are themselves undergoing\ninfertility treatment and wish to donate in return for reduced fees)\ncan receive unlimited benefits-in-kind in the form of cut-price\ninfertility treatment services. The UK, for example, limits payments\nto egg donors to £750 (approx. US$900) and yet egg sharers can\nhave their own treatment costs reduced by many thousands of pounds\n(HFEA 2017: guidance note 13). \nThis raises the question of whether ethically egg sharing is\npreferable to egg selling and, if so, why—along with the closely\nrelated question of whether egg sharing should be treated more\nfavourably in law and professional regulation (Blyth & Golding\n2008). \nThe main reason offered in favour of egg sharing is that\n‘sharers’ are exposed to less additional harm and/or risk\nthan donors (paid or otherwise), since they are already\nundergoing most of the required interventions as part of ongoing\ntreatment. It is supposed to follow from this that incentivising egg\nsharing (other things being equal) is less morally problematic than\nincentivising egg donation: either because of the putative wrongness\nof encouraging people to take ‘excessive’ risks, or\nbecause financial incentives may vitiate consent to those risks\n(Wilkinson 2013). \nThis does seem like a sound prima facie reason to prefer egg\nsharing although several caveats must be noted. First, some special\ntypes of risk may apply to egg sharers: for example, older women who\ndon’t have many viable eggs left might reduce their chances of\nhaving a child by giving away ‘surplus’ eggs (Scott,\nWilliams, Ehrich, & Farsides 2012). Second, and similarly,\nconcerns about consent may apply just as forcefully to egg sharers as\nto egg sellers, especially if some of these are\n‘desperate’ to have a child and egg sharing is their only\nway of paying for infertility treatment services (Blyth & Golding\n2008). Thirdly, as already mentioned, this argument—if it\nworked—would show egg sharing to be superior not only to paid\ndonation but also to altruistic donation, since the additional risks\nare the same whether paid or not (Wilkinson 2013). \nA different kind of reason for treating egg sharing more favourably\nthan egg selling is based on the idea that egg sharers’ motives\nwill typically by morally preferable to those of egg sellers. In\nparticular, it has been claimed that whereas egg sellers are typically\nmotivated by the desire for money, egg sharers act partly out of a\nsense of solidarity with potential recipients—in particular\nbecause both the sharer and the recipient are in similar positions.\nBoth need, or want, infertility treatment services in order to have a\nchild (HFEA 2011; Prainsack & Buyx 2011). \nHowever, whether this really justifies the differential treatment of\nbenefits-in-kind (treatment services) and monetary reward is far from\nclear. One reason for doubt is that, as the HFEA notes: \nWhat is known about donor motivation … is that it is\nmultifaceted. People make decisions for a range of reasons, and\ncompetent adults are capable of assessing the relative benefits,\nburdens and likely impact of a range of options available to them. An\nincentive to donate does not necessarily mean people will do so purely\nbecause of that incentive. Indeed, the literature suggests that both\ndonors and sharers have mixed motives for donating. (HFEA 2011:\nsection 2, 4.4 [p. 8]) \nThis suggests that, in relation to solidarity, there is no categorical\ndifference between payment and benefits-in-kind. While some egg\nsharers may be motivated mainly by feelings of solidarity, others may\nbe more interested simply in saving money. Conversely, while some paid\ndonors would be ‘in it just for the money’, others\n(perhaps those whose close friends or relatives have fertility\nproblems, or who have experienced health problems of their own) could\nbe moved to donate because of feelings of solidarity (the fact that\nthey are financially rewarded notwithstanding). As such, it is by no\nmeans obvious that all egg sharers are motivated by feelings of\nsolidarity, or that all paid donors would fail to have this feeling.\nIndeed, it is by no means obvious even that most egg sharers\nare motivated by feelings of solidarity and there is empirical\nevidence suggesting that the number of sharers significantly decreases\nwhen state funded treatment is made widely available (Pennings\n2009). \nFinally, and more fundamentally, even if donations motivated\nby altruism or solidarity were morally preferable to more\nself-interested ones (donations motivated purely by the desire for\nmoney, for example) it would not necessarily follow that the latter\nare wrong or should be prohibited. For, it may just be that the former\nare supererogatory: that while paid donation is merely\npermissible, unpaid donation is an act of generosity or solidarity\ngoes beyond what is morally permitted or required (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).","contact.mail":"rabrandt@ucsd.edu","contact.domain":"ucsd.edu"},{"date.published":"2017-06-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gametes-donation-sale/","author1":"Reuven Brandt","author2":"Nicola Williams","author1.info":"http://www.reuvenbrandt.com/","author2.info":"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/about-us/people/stephen-wilkinson","entry":"gametes-donation-sale","body.text":"\n\n\nThe donation and transfer of human gametes (eggs and sperm) for\nreproductive purposes raises many important and difficult questions.\nSome of these relate directly to policy and practice; others are more\nconceptual. Gamete donation occupies an interesting position within\nbioethics, having something in common both with other forms of\ndonation (blood and organs, for example) and with\nreproductive technologies not involving donation (ranging\nfrom IVF through to more controversial areas like cloning, embryo\nselection, and genetic modification). It also shares some features\nwith adoption and surrogacy, practices which also\n(arguably at least) involve the transfer or delegation of parental\nduties and rights. (See entries on\n cloning,\n eugenics,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n the donation of human organs, and\n parenthood and procreation.)\n \n\nConceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable ‘lens’\nthrough which to re-examine questions such as:\n\nWhat grounds parental rights and responsibilities?\n\nWhat rights and obligations do parents have regarding their\nchildren (actual or future) and to what extent can these be\ntransferred or delegated?\n\nIt also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as:\n\nShould there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm\ndonor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the\nbasis for these?\n\nDo donor-conceived children have a right to know about their\norigins? Should donor anonymity be permitted?\n\nWhat ‘matching’ and selection decisions should the\nprospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about\ndonors should they be given?\n\nIs it acceptable to ‘buy and sell’ gametes? And is\nthat any different morally from arrangements in which women are\noffered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for\nsome of their eggs?\n\nSuch questions are the subject of this entry.\n\n\nBefore proceeding, however, two matters of definition and scope should\nbe noted.\n\n\nFirst, this entry focuses on the donation of human gametes for\nreproductive purposes, as opposed to for research. The rationale\nfor this is that most of the interesting ethical and philosophical\nissues here concern, in one way or another, the moral and social\nrelations between the donors, parents (recipients), and children\ncreated, and these do not generally arise in the research context. The\nmain exception to this is\n section 4 (Payment)\n where similar questions of consent, exploitation, and harm have been\nraised in both research and treatment contexts (Baylis & McLeod\n2007).\n\n\nSecond, there is the question of what counts as (reproductive) gamete\ndonation. At least for the purposes of this entry, we intend the term\n‘gamete donation’ to apply to those situations in which\n–\n\n A (the donor) voluntarily provides B (the recipient\nor recipients) with gametes (paid or otherwise); and\n\n A expects that and/or intends that B will use those\ngametes to create C (a child or some children);\nand\n\n Both A and B expect that and/or intend that\nA will not become a social or legal parent of\nC.\n\nSince the rights and responsibilities that attach to parenthood are\ngenerally thought to be very weighty, determining whether or not\ngamete donors are parents is a question that has attracted much\nattention. While there is considerable overlap here with the\nliterature on the ultimate basis of parenthood more generally (see\nentry on\n parenthood and procreation)\n questions about parenthood in the context of gamete donation have\ngarnered much specific attention. One important element that\ndistinguishes the gamete donation literature examining parenthood from\nmore general discussions of parental rights and responsibilities is\nthe debate over the transferability of parental\nresponsibilities. If transferring parental responsibility is easily\npossible, then determining whether gamete donors are included amongst\ntheir offspring’s initial parents might not be of great\npragmatic importance. In addition to the debate about parental\nresponsibilities, some others suggest that gamete donors have certain\nnon-parental responsibilities towards their offspring. \nA common starting point for the claim that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is the intuition that individuals who\nreproduce by accident, due to faulty contraception for example,\npossess parental responsibilities for their genetic children (Weinberg\n2008; Nelson 1999; Fuscaldo 2006; Blustein 1997). The strength of this\nintuition is used as motivation for adopting a view that ascribes\nparental responsibilities on the basis of causal involvement in the\ncreation of a child (causal views) rather than a view that ascribes\nparental responsibilities only to those who voluntarily assent to them\n(voluntarist views). Many authors who argue that gamete donors are\nparents proceed by offering a theoretical justification for this\nintuition, then apply this justification to gamete provision.  \nFor instance, Nelson argues that our common-sense understanding of\nmoral responsibility is what best explains our intuitions about\nparenthood in unintentional pregnancy.  On this common-sense view,\nindividuals are morally responsible for the consequences of their free\nactions when (1) their actions are sufficient to bring about those\nconsequences, and (2) their actions are causally proximate to the\nconsequence in question. Nelson further argues that gamete donors’\ncausal involvement in creating children does not significantly depart\nfrom that of unintentional parents (or at least not in morally\nrelevant respects) and therefore that donors are equally parents\n(Nelson 1999, 2014).  Fuscaldo similarly argues that parental\nresponsibility in cases of accidental pregnancy is best explained by\nappeal to our standard account of moral responsibility, but argues\nthat the standard account holds individuals morally responsible for\nthe foreseeable consequences of their free actions. Since bringing\nchildren into existence is a foreseeable consequence of donating\ngametes, gamete donors have a moral responsibility to care for the\nchildren they help create (Fuscaldo 2006).  \nAnother route is to argue that reproduction is an unusual kind of\ncase, and that special rules apply when determining what moral\nresponsibilities arise from involvement in it. An example is what\nBenatar calls ‘reproductive autonomy’. Benatar argues that\nindividuals’ reproductive autonomy both entitles them to make\nreproductive decisions, and requires them to take responsibility for\nthe consequences of those decisions. He argues that this is a special\nfeature of our ability to reproduce that is not reducible to genetics\nor causality, and results in a presumptive duty to parent the children\ncreated from our gametes. This, he argues, best explains why parental\nresponsibility arises in accidental pregnancy cases. Though in some\ncircumstances the presumptive duty to parent one’s genetic\nchildren may be overridden, this is not the case for most instances of\ngamete provision (Benatar 1999). \nOne worry about Benatar’s argument is that its approach relies\ntoo heavily on stipulating that unique moral features attach to\nreproduction, and so risks begging the question. However, Rivka\nWeinberg offers an argument for a similar conclusion, but on more\ngeneral grounds. Weinberg argues that when individuals exercise\ncontrol over materials that pose grave risks to others (what she calls\n‘hazardous materials’) they are liable for the\nconsequences that arise, regardless of the precautions they take. As\nan example, she argues that an owner of a pet lion is liable for\ndamage done by the lion, regardless of the precautions the owner takes\nto keep the lion contained. Calling this the “Hazmat\nTheory”, Weinberg argues that it applies to gametes because\ntheir use can have morally weighty consequences for third\nparties—namely the children that may result from the union of\ngametes. Consequently, Weinberg argues that gamete providers are\nobliged to care for the children that result from the voluntary use of\ntheir gametes (Weinberg 2008). \nImportantly, none of the preceding arguments in favour of including\ngamete donors amongst a child’s parents rely on genetic\nrelatedness. It is not the genetic similarity between gamete donors\nand their biological offspring that is doing the work, but rather\nconsiderations about the kind of thing gametes are (things that can\ncreate people) and the activity that gamete donors engage in with\nthem. \nVelleman (2005, 2008), however, has argued that being parented by\nclose genetic relations is of great importance to the wellbeing of\nchildren, and that for this reason we ought to be sceptical of the\nease with which society permits the separation of social from\nbiological parenthood.  \nBayne argues that gamete donors are not parents because both causal\nand genetic accounts of parental responsibility suffer from a problem\nof regress, and thus fail as plausible grounds for parenthood (Bayne\n2003). For instance, if a person is the parent of the individuals\nproduced via their gametes, as they are according to Benatar, then it\nis unclear why parenthood should stop at the gamete donor and not the\ndonor’s parents, or great grandparents etc. This because the\ndonor is the product of the gametes of these previous generations.\nSimilarly, on a causal account like the one offered by Nelson, if a\nchild was caused to exist by the actions of a sperm donor, then why\nnot think that the person whose actions are responsible for the\nexistence of the sperm donor is similarly a parent of the child. \nIt is however unclear whether Bayne’s criticism in fact applies\nto Nelson and Benatar’s views. Nelson does appeal to causal\nproximity, but explicitly rejects the view that merely being part of\nthe causal chain resulting in the creation of a child is sufficient\nfor parenthood (Nelson 1991, 53). Benatar’s view does not rest\non the genetic similarity between gamete donors and their children,\nbut rather the autonomy individuals exercise over reproductive\nmaterials. While Bayne highlights a problem that causal accounts must\nresolve—namely where to draw the line in the causal\nchain—he does not show that Nelson and Benatar’s view\nsuccumbs to this problem. \nA better route for challenging the view that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is to question whether\nresponsibilities of this kind arise from causal involvement in\nprocreation. For instance, Brake (2005, 2010) argues that while\ncertain obligations towards children might arise as a result of causal\ninvolvement in procreation, it is a mistake to think that this\nincludes the particularly intimate and weighty obligations subsumed in\nparenthood. More will be said about this argument in\n section 1.4. \nBayne (2003), Fuscaldo (2006), and Benatar (1999) all argue that even if gamete\ndonors have parental responsibilities for their offspring initially,\nthis does not mean that these cannot be transferred to others. In\nfact, there are circumstances where such transfers occur and we do not\nthink they are problematic at all—adoption being one example.\nFuscaldo (2006) argues that it is commonplace for parents to transfer\nsome of their responsibilities to others (like the responsibility to\neducate their children to teachers, for example) and so we should not\nthink it strange for individuals who are initially parents to transfer\nall their responsibilities to willing and competent others\n(see also O’Neill 1979). Though Benatar (1999) holds that gamete donors\noften fail to take sufficient care when transferring their\nresponsibilities to others, under the right conditions, transferring\nparental responsibilities is both permissible and possible.  \nBy contrast, some authors argue that such a transfer of responsibility\nis not possible, or at least not ethically permissible, at all\n(Velleman 2008; Weinberg 2008; Nelson 1991; Brandt forthcoming). For\ninstance, Velleman (2008) argues that while adoption is acceptable\nwhen there is no other means to provide a child with an adequate life,\nthis should not be confused with the intentional creation of children\nwhose social link to their genetic parents will be severed. Because\nVelleman believes that preserving the social connection between\nchildren and genetic parents is of great importance for the wellbeing\nof children, he argues that, unless there is pressing reason to do\notherwise, children ought to be parented by their genetic\nprogenitors. \nWeinberg (2008) argues that parental responsibilities cannot be\ntransferred in full because certain kinds of intimate responsibilities\ncan only be fulfilled by particular individuals: individuals in the\nright intimate relationship. For instance, a parent cannot transfer\nthe obligation to support her child by attending a music or dance\nrecital to a stranger. Since Weinberg thinks that gamete donors have a\nresponsibility to love their children and that, because responsibility\nto love a particular person is paradigmatic of the kind that cannot be\ntransferred, at least some donor responsibilities are not\ntransferable. \nTaking a slightly different approach, Brandt argues that much of the\ndebate regarding the transferability of parental responsibilities\nfailed to distinguish delegation from transfer. He argues that the\nimportant difference between the two is that in the former, delegators\nremain responsible for ensuring that the responsibilities get\nfulfilled, and thus are not fully alienated from them. He suggests\nthat, when re-examined with this distinction in mind, the main\nexamples offered in favour of the transfer of parental\nresponsibilities in fact only support the permissibility of their\ndelegation (Brandt forthcoming). For instance, parents have a duty to\nensure that their children are in fact receiving proper education from\ntheir teachers, and thus Fuscaldo’s example provides a case for\nthe delegation but not transfer of parental responsibilities. \nMany authors argue that responsibilities arise for gamete donors that\ndo not rest on their status as parents. Bayne (2003) suggests that,\nthough gamete donors are not parents, they may have the responsibility\nto prevent certain kinds of lives from coming about. For instance,\nthey may be obliged to refrain from creating children with severe\ncongenital diseases that would result in a ‘life not worth\nliving’. Many authors (Bayne 2003; Archard 2010; Porter 2014;\nFuscaldo 2006; O’Neill 1979) also think that gamete donors must\ntake steps to ensure that their offspring will be parented in at least\na minimally acceptable manner. \nWhile the responsibilities mentioned above can be fulfilled prior to\nproviding gametes, some authors think that certain non-parental\nresponsibilities continue to exist after a child has been created,\neven if appropriate precautionary steps (e.g. choosing intending\nparents carefully, screening gametes for congenital diseases, etc.)\nwere taken. For instance, Brake (2010) argues that gamete donors might\nhave an ongoing duty to ensure that their biological offspring receive\nat least a minimum level of care (she calls these ‘procreative\ncosts’) but that this should not be confused with parental\nresponsibilities, which are more intimate and more morally weighty in\nnature. However, Prusak (2011) argues that the gap between\nBrake’s ‘procreative costs’ and parental\nresponsibility is not as pronounced as it initially appears. Like\nBrake, Porter (2012, 2014) similarly argues that gamete donors must\ncontinue to take steps to ensure that their offspring have a decent\nlife, though they are not necessarily obligated to parent their\noffspring themselves.  \nAnother kind of non-parental obligation that gamete donors might have\nis to remain open to the possibility of forming relationships with\ntheir biological offspring, though this openness does not entail an\nobligation to in fact form such relationships (Little 1999). \nIn addition to obligations that focus on the health of potential\noffspring and the competence of intending parents, another question is\nwhether there ought to be limits on the number of offspring that can\nbe created from a single gamete provider. This question is most\nsignificant in sperm provision because of the relative ease of\ncreating large numbers of children from the gametes provided by a\nsingle individual. Three major justifications have been offered for\noffspring limits: the risk of accidental consanguineous relationships,\nthe likelihood of convoluted social relationships with kin, and\ngeneral social discomfort with large offspring numbers (Wright 2016).\nWhile the last might not be a plausible justification on its own, it\nis worth mentioning because in practice such concerns have had an\ninfluential role in the imposition of offspring limits (Deech 1998;\nWarnock Report 1984). \nLimiting offspring numbers in order to reduce the likelihood of\naccidental consanguineous relationships between offspring of the same\ndonor was initially proposed by individuals concerned about possible\nhealth risks to subsequent generations (Curie-Cohen 1980). Recent work\nhas been undertaken in an attempt to quantify these risks and the\nincreased risk of congenital disease that such relationships pose (De\nBoer et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2007). While the increased risk of\nunintentional consanguinity is dependent on the size of the population\nserved by a sperm bank, the risk is lower than might be initially\nthought. For instance, models developed by the Dutch suggest that an\noffspring limit of up to 25 would not result in any significant\nincreased risk, given their particular demographic makeup (De Boer et\nal. 1995). In addition to the increased risk of congenital disease,\nthere is a risk of psychological harm for individuals that discover\nthey have unwittingly entered into a consanguineous relationship,\ngiven the associated social taboos (Wright 2016). Furthermore, there\nmay be legal complications if an accidental consanguineous marriage is\ndiscovered after the fact (Cahn 2009a). One way to mitigate these\nrisks without imposing offspring limits would be to increase openness\nin gamete provision, including actively informing individuals about\nthe identity of their genetic siblings. However, even in the absence\nof such measures there is little agreement about how the risks\nassociated with consanguinity should be translated into offspring\nlimits, especially given the broad freedom individuals are generally\nafforded in their reproductive decisions (Wright 2016; HFEA 2011). \nThe main worry in relation to social relationships with kin is that\ninitiating and maintaining relationships with progenitors and/or\ngenetic siblings is made much more challenging if there are large\nnumbers to accommodate. The extent to which this justifies offspring\nlimits will depend on the importance placed on such relationships and,\nas noted previously, there is much disagreement about this.\nFurthermore, some empirical research into kin relationships following\ngamete provision has found that having large numbers of genetic\nsiblings is not necessarily an impediment to the formation of\nmeaningful relationships (Freeman, Jadva, & Slutsky 2016). \nThere is general agreement that prospective parents ought to be able\nto enter into arrangements with gamete donors that specify certain\nkinds of engagement between the donor and future child, such as the\nprovision of detailed biographical information or even ongoing\ncontact. However, gamete donation arrangements in which there is an\nexpectation that donors remain anonymous are more contentious. While\nsome intending parents and donors prefer anonymous donation, there has\nbeen much discussion about the ethical permissibility of such\narrangements.  \nAdvocates of children’s rights to access identifying information\nabout their donors generally defend their view by pointing to the\npossible harms that might arise in the absence of such information,\nand/or the purported fundamental right that individuals have to\ninformation about their origins (Ravitsky 2010, 2012; Velleman 2005,\n2008; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001; Blyth & Farrand\n2004). Possible harms considered include psychological distress,\ndamaged familial relationships, reduced self-knowledge, and incomplete\nor incorrect medical records. Those who favour permitting anonymous\ndonation argue that it is a mistake to place a great deal of\nimportance on genetic origins, and question both the severity of the\nharms caused by anonymous donation and whether the existence of such\nharms even constitute an argument against donor-anonymity\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). \nThe philosophical debate takes place within a background of changing\nlegal norms governing donor anonymity (Clark 2011; Frith 2001;\nBernstein 2010). While maintaining donor anonymity was once common\npractice (and is mandatory in certain jurisdictions, such as France)\nthere has been a strong trend towards enshrining in law\ndonor-conceived children’s rights to access identifying\ninformation about their donor, at least once they reach the age of\nmajority (Clark 2011; Frith 2001; Bernstein 2010; Brunet &\nKunstmann 2013).  \nOne reason for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is the distress\nthat advocates of disclosure claim many donor-conceived children\nsuffer as a consequence of the absence of identifying information\nabout their biological progenitors. This distress is sometimes\nreferred to as ‘genealogical bewilderment’, a term\noriginally coined in reference to the distress experienced by\nadoptees, and its symptoms are said to include difficulty developing a\npersonal identity that feels genuine, anguish about not knowing the\nidentity of one’s genetic relations, and an obsession with\ntrying to find out information about one’s genetic relations\n(Sants 1964; Cahn 2009b). Advocates of the right to know point to both\nscientific studies and general social observations, such as the rise\nof services to help donor-conceived individuals find their biological\nrelations, as evidence of the severity of this harm (McWhinnie 2001;\nFrith 2001; Ravitsky 2010). \nA related argument is that donor-conceived individuals are denied an\nimportant good if they are not given access to detailed information\nabout their biological relations. More than simply satisfying\ncuriosity, some argue that knowledge about one’s biological\nrelations (especially through contact) is important for self-knowledge\n(Velleman 2005, 2008). On this view, while a name and biographical\ndetails may not replace being reared by biological relations, they do\nat least provide donor-conceived individuals with some\ninformation, and make contact later in life possible.  \nHowever, both these arguments have been challenged on empirical and\nphilosophical grounds. While some studies do indeed show that a subset\nof donor-conceived individuals suffer psychological distress from not\nknowing the identity of their progenitors, others show that such\ndistress is not common, and generally not particularly severe\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Studies also show that early\ndisclosure helps children incorporate the fact that they were\ndonor-conceived into their identity and sense of self, thus helping\nthem avoid some of psychological harms associated with genealogical\nbewilderment (Golombok et. al. 2002). Advocates of the permissibility\nof donor anonymity thus argue that there is no clear evidence that\ndonor anonymity is likely to result in severe harm to offspring.  \nAdditionally, some argue that any psychological harm that does arise\nis likely socially constructed. They point to studies showing that\nindividuals who are unaware that they were donor-conceived do no worse\nthan their peers when it comes to psychological wellbeing\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Consequently, they argue that any\npsychological harms experienced by donor-conceived individuals arise\nin virtue of the social importance placed on biological ties rather\nthan any ‘necessary’ deficit arising from being reared by\nindividuals who are not genetic relations. Similar arguments have also\nbeen raised in response to Velleman’s views regarding the value\nof contact with genetic relations for self-knowledge (Haslanger\n2009). \nIf the psychological harms arising as a consequence of donor-anonymity\nare socially constructed, then prohibiting anonymous gamete donation\nmay exacerbate these harms. Such a prohibition could further reify the\nimportance of biological ties (sometimes referred to as\n‘biologism’), which is what gives rise to the harms in the\nfirst place (Melo-Martín 2014; Leighton 2014; Haslanger 2009). \nAnother reason offered for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is\nthat it prevents donor-conceived individuals from making health\ndecisions informed by family medical history. If individuals are not\ninformed about being donor-conceived, they risk making medical\ndecisions on the incorrect assumption that their social family’s\nmedical background reflects their own. And even if such individuals\nare informed that they are donor-conceived, they still suffer from an\nabsence of medical information that is generally available to others\n(Ravitsky 2012). While it is true that medical information could be\nprovided at the time of donation in a manner that preserves the\nanonymity of the donor, some argue that, as our understanding of\ncongenital disease changes, new information is likely to become\nrelevant (Leighton 2014; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001).\nAdditionally, certain relevant medical conditions might only become\napparent long after the donation. While a system could be put in place\nfor donors to update their medical information, some argue that such a\nsystem would likely be too cumbersome for donor-conceived individuals\nto receive the medical information they need in a timely fashion\n(McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001). \nHowever, those who defend the permissibility of donor anonymity argue\nthat the value of medical history is overstated, and will become less\nimportant as we move towards personalized medicine (Melo-Martín\n2014). In fact, in a report recommending against permitting\ndonor anonymity, the UK’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics stated\nthat medical interests alone were not sufficient grounds for\nprohibiting donor anonymity (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2013). \nAnother argument against donor anonymity is that secrecy about origins\nhas the potential to damage the relationships between donor-conceived\nchildren and their social parents, especially in cases where the\nsocial parent(s) know the identity of the gamete donor(s) Some argue\nthat the strain of having to ‘keep the secret’ is a cause\nof stress for social parents, and that this stress has a negative\nimpact on familial wellbeing (Landau 1998). A potentially more\nsignificant source of family tension is accidental disclosure,\nespecially when donor-conceived children are older. In this latter\ncase, several harms might arise, and may be greatly exacerbated if\nchildren were not aware that they were donor-conceived. Children might\ndevelop feelings of distrust towards their social parents, and may\nhave difficulty incorporating facts about their genetic history into\ntheir personal identity (Turner & Coyle 2000). \nWhile harms caused by both secrecy and accidental disclosure can be\nmitigated to some extent without making identifiable information\navailable, by simply disclosing to children at a young age that they\nare donor-conceived for example, some argue that more openness is\nbetter for familial unity, and that providing children with an\nopportunity to find out the identity of their donors (even if that is\ndelayed until they are older) is usually best (Nuffield Council on\nBioethics 2009). \nThose who favour permitting anonymous gamete donation argue that, at\nbest, the evidence suggests a slight improvement in familial wellbeing\nwhen information about a donor is provided along with disclosure about\nthe method of their conception. Families in which children do not have\naccess to identifying information about their donors still report good\nhome-life and have positive relationships with their parents\n(Melo-Martín 2014). Thus, while non-disclosure might not be optimal,\nit is probably not so harmful that it falls outside of the domain of\nparental discretion. Furthermore, if the harms are socially\nconstructed, as some have argued is the case in genealogical\nbewilderment, then we may have additional reasons for concluding that\nthe harms to family cohesion do not justify prohibiting anonymous\ndonation, since doing so would only further contribute to biologism\n(Melo-Martín 2014). \nThe arguments against donor anonymity considered thus far focus on\nharms that might arise as a result of the practice. Another kind of\nargument is that individuals have a fundamental right to knowledge\nabout their origins. In the legal literature, some have argued that\nthe UN’s Declaration on The Rights of The Child and the European\nConvention on Human Rights establishes individuals’ rights to\ninformation about the circumstances of their conception, including\ninformation about their progenitors (Blyth & Farrand 2004). Apart\nfrom appeals to such declarations of rights, some attempts have been\nmade to motivate recognition of a fundamental right to know via appeal\nto other fundamental goods. \nOne strategy is to tie the right to know to the right to an identity.\nHere the argument is that individuals require genuine facts about\ntheir biological history in order to develop a proper personal\nidentity (Ravitsky 2010). However, one response is that that while\nchildren have a right to an identity, they do not have a right to a\nparticular kind of identity, such as one based primarily on\nhistorical biological ties (Allen 1996). Another route is to argue\nthat children have a right to be respected, and that hiding facts\nabout their origins is a form of deception that we ought not permit\n(Freeman 1996). However, deception about origins is only a severe form\nof disrespect if we think that biological ties are important in the\nfirst place, and thus this argument risks begging the question. \nOffspring’s ability to access adoption records have oscillated\nquite substantially over the past century and a half, even within the\nsame jurisdiction (Samuels 2000). More recently, regulatory structures\nhave shifted in favour of providing adoptees with a legal right to\naccess identifying information about their progenitors (Besson 2007,\nHildebrand 1999). In such jurisdictions, some have argued that,\nbecause gamete donation is sufficiently similar to adoption,\nregulatory consistency demands that anonymous gamete donation be\nprohibited as well (Pratten v.  British Columbia (Attorney\nGeneral) 2012 BCCA 480; Chisholm 2012; Cahn 2009c – see\nOther Internet Resources). While this parity argument only goes so far\nin the absence of philosophical justification for prohibiting\nanonymous adoption (mere consistency could conversely be achieved by\npermitting anonymous adoption) it does give pause to examine the\nrelevant similarities between the two practices. \nThe core of the parity argument is that in both adoption and gamete\ndonation, children are reared by individuals other than their genetic\nprogenitors. If we think that access to information about genetic\nprogenitors is important enough to be elevated to the status of a\nright in adoption, then we ought to extend the same right to\ndonor-conceived individuals as well.  \nIn response, Leighton has argued that there are important disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation such that there may be no\ninconsistency in prohibiting anonymity in one case but not the other\n(Leighton 2014). For instance, adoptees are generally relinquished by\ntheir initial parent(s), and are often not raised by either of their\ngenetic parents. In the case of gamete donation there is no similar\nrelinquishing of parenthood, and often one of the genetic parents is\nalso a social parent. These differences may very well result in\ndivergences in the experiences of adoptees and donor-conceived\nindividuals. For instance, adoptees might feel abandoned by their\ninitial parents, and be curious about why they were relinquished,\nsomething that is unlikely to be the case in gamete donation.\nFurthermore, Leighton argues that since adoption has a history of\nstigmatization in the West while gamete donation has no such history,\nthere is good reason to think that the psychological impact of\nanonymous adoption on adoptees will be different from the\npsychological impact of anonymous gamete donation on donor-conceived\nindividuals (Leighton 2014).  \nWhile simply demonstrating that there are relevant disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation does not show that anonymity is\npermissible in the latter case but not the former, it does show that\nit is not outright inconsistent to have different policies governing\nanonymity for each.  \nRecipients of donated gametes often wish to have some say in what\ntheir donor is ‘like’. The characteristics made available\nto inform donor selection decisions differ greatly dependent on both\nthe countries and clinics in which such choices are made. However,\nsuch information tends to include medical, morphological, and\nbiographical information similar to that found on dating websites,\nsuch as hair colour, eye colour, ethnicity, educational attainment,\njob type, hobbies, and religion. \nFew commentators suggest that recipient-parents should be barred\ncompletely from accessing information about prospective donors, but\nneither is it generally assumed that they should be afforded\nunfettered liberty to choose their donors’ characteristics.\nThus, the debate in this area tends to focus on where the line between\nmorally acceptable and unacceptable selection practices lies. \nThree main categories of motivation underlie donor selection\ndecisions. \nThe first is selection against donors posing a threat to the physical\nwellbeing of pregnant women. This form of selection is ubiquitous such\nthat the barring of donors with sexually transmissible diseases such\nas HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis is mandated by national and\ninternational guidelines on gamete donation (see, for example HFE Act\n2008: s. T52 – see Other Internet Resources). This motivation for\nselection is widely seen as morally unproblematic and will, for this\nreason, be largely ignored here. \nThe second and third categories of motivation, termed here, selection\nfor ‘matching’ and selection for ‘design’ are,\nunlike the first, based on parental and/or societal preferences or\nvalues. In practice, most donor selection decisions will fall into\nboth categories, but a theoretical distinction is nonetheless made\nbetween the two in the philosophical literature.  \nSelection for ‘matching’ is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child who bears a similarity to the recipient parents.\nThus, gamete donors are selected (or deselected) by reference the\nextent to which their physical (and sometimes social and\npsychological) characteristics match those of recipient parents. As\nBraverman and Frith (2014) note, the aim of this practice is often:\n \nto enable secrecy and concealment of gamete donation. This practice\nincorporates a popular knowledge of genetics and enables the child to\n‘pass’ as a naturally conceived child. This is an attempt\nto avoid overt ‘difference’ between child and couple and\nwhen a good match is achieved the donor disappears from view.\n(Braverman & Frith 2014: 135) \nThere may however, be aims other than secrecy and concealment. These\nmay have their basis in concerns regarding compatibility (wanting our\nchildren to be ‘like us’ and to ‘fit in’)\n(Ruddick 2000), premised on physical or psychological desire (we often\nchoose our reproductive partners because they possess characteristics\nthat please us), or even with the aim of avoiding offence - a member\nof a couple may be offended if his/her partner prefers a donor with\ncharacteristics markedly different from his/her own (Pennings 2000).\nImportantly, matching motivations are distinguished from other\nmotivations for selection as they are limited only to desires to\nselect for donors with characteristics possessed by one/both intended\nsocial parents and should be based only in a desire to attain\nresemblance between parent and child. \nSelection motivated by design, however, is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child with characteristics which may or may not be\npossessed by the recipient parents but which are, nonetheless, deemed\nby them (and/or society) to be desirable (and often advantageous).\nSuch selection may thus be performed with several aims in mind. These\ninclude but are not limited to desires to increase the life prospects\nof one’s children by preventing the birth of children with\ndisadvantageous or without advantageous characteristics, to satisfy\npreferences for a particular ‘kind of child’, or with the\neugenic aim of improving the gene pool through the selection of donors\ndeemed to possess ‘superior’ heritable traits. \nOf these two categories, a desire for matching is generally\nthought to be less morally problematic than a desire for\ndesign, since desires for familial resemblance, secrecy\n(within limits), and to avoid offence are often considered relatively\nbenign. This is not, however, to say that no critical work has been\ndone on this topic as shall be seen in\n subsection 3.3 which looks to the\nquestion of whether race-based matching and selection practices are\nmorally permissible. \nDesign-based motivations for selection, however, have been the subject\nof a great deal more debate. This discussion largely mirrors (or is\nsubsumed by) many of the discussions had regarding the ethics of\nselective reproductive technologies, such as pre-implantation and\npre-natal genetic diagnosis, and such topics as sex selection and\nhuman enhancement (see entries on\n pregnancy, birth & medicine,\n and\n eugenics).\n For, although in the context of gamete donor selection there are no\nembryos or fetuses involved, nor genetic manipulation performed, there\nhas been much focus on questions of: \nWith this in mind, throughout the following subsections such debates\nwill be explored in turn. \nThe desire to have a child free from disability and disease is often\nconsidered the least contentious ground for gamete donor selection.\nParents and prospective parents, after-all, tend to want the best for\ntheir children and diseases and disabilities can make the attainment\nof a ‘good life’ life harder. Given this, and the fact\nthat donor selection, unlike other forms of selective reproduction,\nraises few thorny questions regarding women’s rights over their\nown bodies and the moral permissibility of abortion or the destruction\nof embryos, the dominant position among philosophers regarding gamete\nselection for the purpose of disability avoidance is one of\npermissiveness (see for example: Robertson 1994; Glover et\nal. 1989; Glover 2006; Strong 1997; Bennett 2001; Wilkinson\n2010). Robertson (1994) sums up this view well when he states: \nThe desire not to have a child with serious defects is not itself\nimmoral, and actions to avoid such a reproductive outcome should be\nrespected as an important aspect of procreative liberty. The question\nthen is what means to achieve that goal are acceptable…\nPreconception selection by voluntary selection of mates or gametes\nraises the fewest problems… Concern with the genetic fitness of\na mate may not be romantic but it is rational if one is concerned\nabout the health of spouse and offspring. Mate selection should thus\nbe left to the individual. Similarly, the selection of a gamete donor\nshould be left to the couple that needs this service. (Roberson 1994:\n154) \nSome go further, arguing that donor selection for the purpose of\ndisability-avoidance is not merely permissible but, in certain\ncircumstances, obligatory (see, for example: Savulescu 2001; Savulescu\n& Kahane 2009; Harris 1985, 2002; Buchanan et al 2000; Glover\n1989; Glover 2006). Discussions regarding this matter have tended to\nfocus less on gamete donor selection and more on the selection of\nembryos and fetuses through pre-implantation and pre-natal genetic\ndiagnosis. However, as Holm and Bennett (2014) and Williams (2017)\nnote, arguments suggesting a moral obligation to select against\ndisability in these contexts apply to gamete donor selection too. \nIndeed, that this is the case can be seen clearly in the negative\nmedia reaction and public outrage directed towards a deaf couple who,\nafter deliberately conceiving a deaf child in the early 2000s via the\nuse of a 5th generation deaf sperm donor, were vilified by\nthe tabloid media and condemned by the US National Association of the\nDeaf. (For interesting and insightful commentaries on this case see\nSavulescu 2002; Spriggs 2002; Fahmy 2011.) It can also be seen in\nthe fact that many countries require that clinics screen out\npotential donors for heritable diseases prior to their inclusion on\nthe donor register. A notable example of this is the UK’s Human\nFertilisation and Embryology Act which, since 2008, has included a\nclause prohibiting the selection of gamete donors and embryos  \nthat are known to have a gene, chromosome, or mitochondrion\nabnormality involving a significant risk that a person with the\nabnormality will have or develop: (a) a serious physical or mental\ndisability, (b) a serious illness, or (c) and other serious medical\ncondition. (HFE Act 2008, s. 14(4)(9) – see Other Internet\nResources) \nYet on what grounds might such an obligation be based? Some suggest\nthat a moral basis for such an obligation may be found by focusing\non the interests of and/or the rights of the children that will result\nfrom our procreative decisions (see Davis 2001 for a\nrights-focused approach). Arguments falling into this category thus\nfocus on person-affecting reasons, picking out the harms or limits to\nopportunity associated with certain disabilities as providing good\nreason to select against donors with traits liable to result in such\nharms and limits to opportunity. Such an approach is intuitive.\nHowever, given the conclusions of the Non-Identity Problem (see entry\non\n the non-identity problem),\n many question the logic of appeals to the interests of the child\ncreated in all but cases of the most severe disabilities. For, as it\nis generally held that a life with a disease or disability is better\nthan no life at all, and selection decisions alter who it is that\ncomes to exist rather than the prospects of determinate future\npersons, a focus on the interests of future children cannot ground\nsuch an obligation (Bennett 2009; Parfit 1984; Parker 2007; Robertson\n1994). \nOthers suggest that although the objects of our procreative efforts\nmay not be harmed by being born with a disability prospective parents\nmay nevertheless have good moral reason to select against disability\nin their offspring on the basis of other considerations. These include\nappeals to the interests of others whose interests may be affected by\nour reproductive decisions such as existing children and other\ndependents (Roberts 2009) and taxpayers in countries with socialized\nmedical and welfare systems (Heyd 1995; Fahmy 2011; Rakowski 2002;\nWilliams 2017); appeals\nto the claim that to fail to take reasonable steps to prevent\ndisability in one’s future children is contrary to common\nconceptions of the good parent (Steinbock & McClamrock 1994); and\nto the suggestion that that those who fail to avoid disability in\ntheir offspring act wrongly as they deliberately or negligently choose\nto create a state of affairs that is strictly worse (in terms of some\nparticular value such as happiness/preference satisfaction) than the\nstate of affairs that could have been created had they chosen\ndifferently (Harris 1985; Parfit 1984; Glover 1989; Glover 2006). (See entry on\n eugenics\n for a more detailed treatment and criticisms of different arguments\nin support of an obligation to select against disability.) \nSuch arguments have been criticized by many who suggest that parental\nobligations to their offspring cannot be so strong as to ground an\nobligation to select against disability (Williams 2017); that  \ncomplex concepts such as the good life, the best life, and human\nflourishing, are not reducible to simple elements or constituent parts\nwhich might be identified by the testing of embryos [and selection of\nsperm donors]; (Parker 2007: 281)  \nand that appealing to impersonal harms devalues those with\ndisabilities by suggesting that their lives are worth less than those\nwithout disabilities (Asch 2003; Bennett 2009). Yet, whilst such\nauthors tend to suggest that there cannot be an obligation to select\nagainst disability, they also suggest that prospective parents should\nbe at liberty to do so. Among a number of authors associated with the\ndisability rights movement however, a different claim is made. For,\nsuch authors suggest that not only can there be no moral obligation to\nselect against disability, parental preferences to screen out disabled\ndonors are morally problematic for two reasons. \nThe first regards the messages that such preferences send about and\ntowards persons living with disabilities, ones which may be seen as\ndiscriminatory and offensive: “express[ing] a hurtful attitude\nabout and a hurtful message to people who live with\n[disabilities]” (Parens & Asch 1999: S2). \nThe second is that the desire to select against disabling genetic\ntraits is based on misinformation regarding both the severity and true\nnature of disability. In terms of severity, for example, it has been\nwidely reported that persons with disabilities tend to report good\nquality of life despite the fact that most (non-disabled) observers\nsuggest the opposite (for work on the disability paradox see Albrecht\n& Devieger 1999). Regarding the true nature of disability, it is\nclaimed that contrary to the views of many, who hold that disability\nis inherently disadvantageous, many (and, for those who take an\nextreme approach, all) of the harms associated with disability are\nsocially constructed. That is, they are often not the result of\nfailures in functioning but society’s failing to account for\neveryone when designing physical, economic, and social institutions\n(Glackin 2010). Thus, it is suggested that as disability is often not\na feature intrinsic to those who suffer it, to attempt to prevent\ndisability by preventing the existence of persons with inabilities is\nvery much akin to attempts to prevent sexism or racism by preventing\nthe births of black people and women: an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem (Asch 2003). Taken to extremes, however, social\nconstructivism is often viewed as irredeemably flawed by the academic\ncommunity and a great number of able bodied and disabled persons\nalike. Robert Kitcher expresses this well when he notes that if we\ntake a wholly social constructivist view  \nattempts to decrease the incidence of Tay-Sachs will be no different\nfrom Northern Indian sex selection or from anticipated future efforts\nto cure lesbians. (Kitcher 1996: 215) \n(See entries on\n parenthood and procreation\n &\n eugenics\n for more in depth discussion of the suggestion that they may be a\nmoral obligation to select against disability in our offspring and the\nentry\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for more information on models of disability.) \nQuestions and concerns have also been raised regarding the\nappropriateness of selection on the basis of characteristics related\nto ‘race’, such as skin, eye, and hair colour. Had gamete\ndonor selection been well known in the 1980s when discussion raged\nconcerning whether trans-racial adoption practices constituted a step\nin the right direction towards the social ideal of colour-blindness, a\nform of racial and cultural genocide, or something in between the two,\none might have expected to see similar discussions regarding donor\nselection. This however has not been the case and instead, the\nphilosophical literature on race-based selection has tended to focus\non the question of whether selection of race-based characteristics is\nappropriate at all. \nFor the most part this focus is due to contemporary debates regarding\nthe question of whether the concept of race is philosophically and\nscientifically defensible. Thus, work suggesting the removal of racial\nidentifiers on donor catalogues seems to owe a great deal to authors\nsuch as K. Anthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) who both deny\nthat race is a coherent concept and recommend discarding it entirely\n(see entry on\n race). \nFogg-Davis (2001), for example, suggests that both the practice of\nreproducing race through assisted reproduction and selecting donors on\nthe basis of different race-linked characteristics are problematic as\nthey raise two major linked ethical issues:  \none is the harm that racial stereotyping causes to individuals, and\nthe second is the public awareness that racial stereotyping is an\naccepted feature of this largely unregulated market.  \nShe suggests that those who use racial classification to inform donor\nselection decisions are saying that  \nrace is heritable and relevant to their vision of family\nstructure… that a person’s gametes are transmitters of\nracial meaning that can and should be selectively transmitted to their\nchild through the use of reproductive technologies. (Fogg-Davis 2001:\n18) \nHarris (1998) too questions the legitimacy of the desire to match\ndonors to recipient parents on the basis of race-linked\ncharacteristics such as skin tone, and hair and eye colour. He\nnotes: \nWhy do so many people firmly believe that children should be like\ntheir parents, particularly in terms of their general colour and\nracial characteristics? It is difficult not to view this desire, and\nattempts to implement it, as a form of ‘ethnic cleansing.’\nIt smacks very much of the pressure that so many societies and\ncultures have put upon their members not to ‘marry out’ or\nto put it more bluntly, not to mate with somebody of another tribe or\nrace. (Harris 1998: 21) \nOthers however suggest that there is  \nno evidence to suggest that racial prejudice accounts for why sperm\nbanks sort sperm donors according to race or why many prospective\nparents hope for a child of a particular race. (Fox 2009: 1860)  \nSuch authors suggest instead that racial preferences in gamete\ndonation are more likely to stem from a desire to replicate the family\nstructure of the biological family, to avoid deficient access to\nracial culture and consciousness, to increase their children’s\nprospects in unjust social contexts, or premised on a desire “to\nmake the donor invisible and to conform the new-founded family to the\nideal of the natural family” (Pennings 2000: 508). With this in\nmind, Fox suggests that although race-based selection should not be\ncondemned in all cases it is important to “soften the prominence\nof race in donor selection by taking measures to frustrate wholesale\nfiltering of sperm donors on the basis of race” (Fox 2009:\n1893). \nOthers still note that those who desire to select for race-linked\ncharacteristics for these ‘less objectionable’ reasons\nmust still consider the wider consequences of doing so. Agar (2004),\nfor example, when considering the question of selection for race and\nsexual orientation in the context of genetic engineering, suggests\nthat whilst the aim of increasing the life prospects of one’s\nchildren in racist and homophobic societies by selecting for\nheterosexual and light skinned offspring is not objectionable, such\npractices should not be permitted. Not only would such selection\ncollude with prejudice, constituting an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem, but it would likely also undermine attempts to change\nracist and homophobic social attitudes and practices. \nGamete donor selection may also be motivated by a desire to parent a\n‘particular kind of child’ such as where a music lover\nseeks out a concert pianist in order to increase the likelihood that\nthe future child will possess such talents, or where a couple seek out\ngamete donors with genius level IQ in order to increase the likelihood\nof rearing an academically gifted child (as with the couples who\npurchased sperm in the 1990s from the ‘repository of germinal\nchoice’) (Plotz 2006) . \nSuch cases raise a different kind of concern about whether selection,\nwhen performed in order to satisfy these kinds of preferences,\nencourages and facilitates the development of ethically troubling\nattitudes on the part of prospective parents. \nThis concern has been expressed in various different ways. Some, for\nexample, suggest that selection motivated by such desires is\nincompatible with parental virtues such as ‘acceptingness’\n(McDougall 2007), ‘openness to the unbidden’ (Sandel\n2007), and ‘unconditional love’ (Herrisone-Kelly 2007).\nThose who take this view hold onto the traditional notion of the child\nas a gift and correspondingly suggest that parents ought to care, not\nabout the traits that their children possess, but about developing a\nloving relationship with and raising whatever child they receive.\nOthers take a more Kantian line, suggesting that such these parents\nare wrongfully instrumentalising their children: treating them as a\nmeans of fulfilling parental hopes and dreams rather than as entities\nwho, once born, exist for their own sake (Davis 1997). \nYet the suggestion that a selective mentality is incompatible with\nimportant parental virtues or problematically instrumentalises\none’s future children has been the subject of some debate.\nAuthors such as Ruddick (2000) and Green (2008), challenge the\n‘maternalist assumption’ that parents  \nwho want a child should accept and welcome any child they happen to\nreceive, prepared to appreciate the child’s developing\nindividuality, however different from their own. (Ruddick 2000: 102)\n \nThey hold instead that other conceptions of parenthood can, provided\nthey are not taken to extremes, be perfectly adaptive, and crucially,\ndo not require parents to refrain from all attempts to shape the\ncharacteristics of their prospective children. They suggest that\nparents should rightly be viewed as both guardians of the\nchildren’s future interests, and ‘gardeners’ who may\nshape and raise children in line with their own preferences and\npriorities. \nOthers question whether the virtues of the prospective parent are the\nsame as those of an existing parent. For, although some hold that a\ndesire to have a hand in the characteristics of one’s future\nchildren is part of a broader desire to parent and thus requires\n“committing oneself to acting and evaluating one’s actions\nand decisions in light of the project of parenthood” (Vehmas\n2001: 439), others argue that a desire to select is not incompatible\nwith such a commitment. Kamm argues, for example, that a distinction\ncan be made between ‘caring to have’ a particular child\nand ‘caring about’ one’s future children once born\nand suggests that there is little reason to assume that the desire to\nseek out certain attributes in one’s children is incompatible\nwith parental virtues or common conceptions of the good parent. She\nnotes  \none can know that one will care about someone just as much whether or\nnot she has certain traits and yet care to have someone that has,\nrather than lacks such traits. (Kamm 2009: 113)  \nThis is echoed by Wilkinson who, discussing a hypothetical example of\ntwo prospective parents who seek to ensure the birth of a blue eyed\nchild and agree that they will put it up for adoption after birth\nshould it not possess such characteristics, notes  \nit is not the desire to select that violates the principle of\nunconditional love [or other parental virtues], but rather the plan to\nreject the child if it does not live up to expectations… it is\nentirely possible to want to select characteristics while not having\nthis problematic attitude of rejection. (Wilkinson 2010: 29) \nSome suggest however that, although selection is not necessarily\nmorally problematic, we should still be concerned that a selective\nmentality may be a precursor of conditional, as opposed to\nunconditional, love once the child is born, or to unrealistic\nexpectations and feelings of entitlement. Thus, the suggestion here is\nthat people who go to great lengths and incur great expense in\nprocuring what are, for them, the ‘perfect’ gametes, may\nbe more likely to reject or otherwise mistreat their children should\nthey fail to develop the ‘right’ capacities and interests\n(see, for example: Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). Again, however, it is not\nat all clear that the link between a selective mentality in\nreproduction and overzealous and unforgiving parenting styles is a\nnecessary one, as the majority of parents are not liable to be so\nnaïve to “presume to know what they are getting simply\nbecause they had a hand in selecting some of their child’s\ngenetic features” (Fahmy 2011: 7), or indeed that gamete donor\nselection is as likely as other more expensive and\neffective forms of selective reproduction (such as genetic\nengineering) to produce such problematic expectations and\nattitudes. \nShould gamete providers be paid? If so, should such payments be\nlimited to compensation (possibly including compensation for time and\ninconvenience)? Or is incentivising or rewarding providers also\nmorally acceptable? \nIn favour of payment, the main reason cited is increased supply, thus\nenabling recipients to have children that they wouldn’t\notherwise have had—or, where scarcity per se is not an\nissue, giving recipients more choice. In addition, supporters of\npayment cite justice (gamete providers deserve to be rewarded) and\nautonomy (providers and recipients should be allowed to contract with\neach other as they see fit). Finally, pragmatic arguments are\nsometimes offered, such as the cost of prohibition or the possibility\nof its leading to an unregulated ‘black’ or\n‘grey’ market in gametes (Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004;\nWilkinson 2013) \nSome of the arguments and issues concerning payment for gametes\nclosely resemble ones arising in other areas such as organ sale, sex\nwork, and commercial surrogacy (see entries on\n exploitation,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n feminist perspectives on sex markets,\n parenthood and procreation, and\n the sale of human organs).\n We deal with these briefly here before moving on to consider in\ngreater detail some of the more distinctive issues raised by paying\ngamete providers. The focus here is on gametes for clinical use in\nhuman reproduction, rather than gametes for research purposes,\nalthough many of the same issues also arise in a research setting. \nOne of the most obvious issues is harm or risk to the providers\n(Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004). \nIn the case of sperm, the physical risks of donating are negligible,\nbut concerns have been raised about psychosocial risks, especially if\none man is permitted to generate numerous offspring. What happens, for\nexample, if a single sperm donor produces hundreds of children and a\nsignificant proportion of those contact him years later? That could\nhave a significant impact on the man’s life (and on the welfare\nof the children, discussed below). One way of containing this risk\nwould be to limit donor offspring numbers; another would be to allow\ndonor anonymity, although that may be objectionable on other grounds\n(see our earlier discussions of donor anonymity and donor offspring\nlimits). \nProducing hundreds of children is unlikely to be a problem for egg\ndonors but, unlike sperm donors, these women do face non-negligible\nphysical risks: notably OHSS (Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome). \nAs with the organ sale debate, though, it is not clear why the\nexistence of these risks constitutes an objection to payment,\nas opposed to an objection to the whole practice of gamete\ndonation (paid or otherwise) since the risks don’t increase\nas a result of payment (Wilkinson 2013). In response to this, in the\ncase of sperm donation, it could be argued that the scenario where one\nman produces hundreds of children is much more likely to happen if\npayment is allowed, as some men seek to become ‘professional\nsperm donors’. As has been noted however it should be possible\nto neutralise this risk by enforcing donor offspring limits. \nAnother set of issues is the negative effect that payments, or\npayments above a certain level, are supposed to have on the quality of\nconsent—a concern that is closely linked to worries about\nexploitation. Financial incentives, it is argued, encourage people to\ndo things that they would not otherwise do, encourage them to do\nthings that are harmful, and make their actions, consents, and\ndecisions less likely to be autonomous and voluntary (Resnick 2001;\nSteinbock 2004; Wilkinson 2013). These arguments are more often\ndirected at paid egg donation than paid sperm donation, because the\ndirect physical risks and the sums of money involved for eggs tend to\nbe much greater. Thus, people have been concerned that vulnerable\nyoung egg donors might be lured into the egg market and then exploited\nby clinics, egg banks, or recipients. These concerns structurally\nparallel ones that people often have about commercial surrogacy and\nsex work. \nArguments of this kind are dealt with in much more detail in the\nentries on\n Exploitation,\n Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets,\n Parenthood and Procreation,\n Informed Consent, and\n The Sale of Human Organs.\n For the present, we simply note that, while the possibility of\ndefective consent and exploitation must be taken seriously in any\nsystem of paid gamete donation, there seems no reason in principle why\npaying for gametes must be exploitative, nor why it cannot be validly\nconsented to. Provided that the payment-levels are fair, and that the\nprovider’s situation, mental capacities, and access to\ninformation are all sufficiently favourable, it is hard to see\nwhy—in common with other financial transactions—gamete\nprovision can’t be validly consensual and non-exploitative. \nFinally, we note here that there is a connection between remuneration\narrangements and selection practices (discussed above). In particular,\none objection to allowing payment—or at least to the unfettered\ncommercialisation of gametes—is that it may encourage a market\nin which particular traits can, for those willing to pay a high price,\nbe aggressively selected for. For example, in the USA, young\nattractive white female egg donors attending ‘Ivy League’\nuniversities can command a higher fee for their eggs than other\ndonors—and anyone who is willing to pay can have access to those\neggs. So, anyone who regards selection practices like this as\nproblematic may also regard the commercialisation of gametes as\nproblematic inasmuch as it underpins and enables fine-grained\nselection by ‘gamete consumers’ to take place. \nWe turn now to some of the more ‘distinctive’ issues\nrelating to paying gamete donors. The first of these is the welfare of\nthe child created. While this issue is ‘distinctive’\ninasmuch as it applies only in the reproductive sphere (and so not to,\nfor example, organ sale) it does arise in other reproductive areas,\nnotably commercial surrogacy (Harris 2000). \nThe main worry here is that when donor-conceived children find out\nthat money is what primarily motivated the donor then, in some cases,\nthis will have adverse psychological effects; in the most extreme,\nthey may come to feel that they were ‘bought’ (HFEA 2011).\nWhat follows from this possibility, however, is unclear. \nTo start with, there are empirical questions about how many\ndonor-conceived people will feel this way and about how severe their\nnegative feelings (if any) are. Not all donor-conceived people have\nnegative feelings about donor motives and financial reward; some may\nnot care what their donors’ motives were. So, if this concern is\ngoing to ground an ethical argument against paying donors, a solid\nevidence base will be needed to underpin its empirical premises. \nSimilarly, there is a set of questions not so much about donors’\nactual motives are, but about what they write on their\ndonation papers, and about how and when information is conveyed to\ntheir offspring. One view is that, for the sake of the welfare of the\nchild, it would be better for donors to ‘tell a story’\n(even if not wholly accurate) that donor-conceived children will find\nmore palatable than the bare truth that the donor simply needed money.\nAnother is that if donor-conceived children are communicated with\nappropriately, honestly, and sensitively, and at an early stage then\nany problems associated with donor motives will be minimal (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2013). \nStill, let’s allow (at least for the sake of argument) that\nthese problems are insurmountable: that—whatever we do—a\nsignificant number of donor-conceived children will be substantially\nharmed by the knowledge that their donors were paid. What follows from\nthis? \nFirst, we should note that this area is subject to the implications of\nthe Non-Identity Problem (Parfit 1984). In particular, given that\n(let’s assume) many paid sperm donors would not have donated\nbut for the money, it is plausible to supposed that children who\nsuffer psychological harm when they find out about their donors\nwould not have existed if there hadn’t been payments.\nTherefore, for standard reasons relating to the Non-identity Problem,\nthey may not be harmed by the practice of payment—or at\nleast not in the usual comparative harm-to-interests sense (worse off\nthan they would otherwise have been). (See entry on the\n non-identity problem.)\n So, while there may still be a child welfare argument against\npayment, it must rely not on harm-avoidance but rather on impersonal\nwelfare considerations. \nGiven this, a lot hinges on whether payment is required to ensure an\nadequate supply of donor gametes. If it is not (if, for example, the\nreasons for paying people are quite trivial ones, such as\nadministrative convenience, or even allowing recipients more choice)\nthen the fact that payment will adversely affect donor welfare does\nlooks like a good (albeit prima facie) reason to prefer\naltruistic donation. Imagine that we have a choice between creating a\npopulation of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a\ndifferent but equally large population using altruistic donors. If (as\nwe’re allowing) the latter will have a higher quality of life\nthen there is a strong ‘impersonal’ reason, other things\nbeing equal, to prefer the latter: altruistic donation. Things look\nrather different though if the choice is instead between a population\nof donor-conceived children using paid donors or a different and\nsignificantly smaller population, for then it would be necessary\nto ‘trade off’ a higher average quality of life against\nboth (a) the fact that there are fewer lives overall and (b) any harm\ndone to prospective parents who are denied the opportunity to raise a\ndonor-conceived child. Any such moral calculation will be complex and\nthis goes to show that, in cases where payment is required to secure\nan adequate supply of gametes, this is not obviously wrong (all things\nconsidered) even if there are detrimental effects on donor-conceived\npeople’s quality of life (Wilkinson 2016). \nSome countries (notably the United Kingdom) either prohibit or\nstrictly limit payments to egg donors but allow an exception whereby\n‘egg sharers’ (women who are themselves undergoing\ninfertility treatment and wish to donate in return for reduced fees)\ncan receive unlimited benefits-in-kind in the form of cut-price\ninfertility treatment services. The UK, for example, limits payments\nto egg donors to £750 (approx. US$900) and yet egg sharers can\nhave their own treatment costs reduced by many thousands of pounds\n(HFEA 2017: guidance note 13). \nThis raises the question of whether ethically egg sharing is\npreferable to egg selling and, if so, why—along with the closely\nrelated question of whether egg sharing should be treated more\nfavourably in law and professional regulation (Blyth & Golding\n2008). \nThe main reason offered in favour of egg sharing is that\n‘sharers’ are exposed to less additional harm and/or risk\nthan donors (paid or otherwise), since they are already\nundergoing most of the required interventions as part of ongoing\ntreatment. It is supposed to follow from this that incentivising egg\nsharing (other things being equal) is less morally problematic than\nincentivising egg donation: either because of the putative wrongness\nof encouraging people to take ‘excessive’ risks, or\nbecause financial incentives may vitiate consent to those risks\n(Wilkinson 2013). \nThis does seem like a sound prima facie reason to prefer egg\nsharing although several caveats must be noted. First, some special\ntypes of risk may apply to egg sharers: for example, older women who\ndon’t have many viable eggs left might reduce their chances of\nhaving a child by giving away ‘surplus’ eggs (Scott,\nWilliams, Ehrich, & Farsides 2012). Second, and similarly,\nconcerns about consent may apply just as forcefully to egg sharers as\nto egg sellers, especially if some of these are\n‘desperate’ to have a child and egg sharing is their only\nway of paying for infertility treatment services (Blyth & Golding\n2008). Thirdly, as already mentioned, this argument—if it\nworked—would show egg sharing to be superior not only to paid\ndonation but also to altruistic donation, since the additional risks\nare the same whether paid or not (Wilkinson 2013). \nA different kind of reason for treating egg sharing more favourably\nthan egg selling is based on the idea that egg sharers’ motives\nwill typically by morally preferable to those of egg sellers. In\nparticular, it has been claimed that whereas egg sellers are typically\nmotivated by the desire for money, egg sharers act partly out of a\nsense of solidarity with potential recipients—in particular\nbecause both the sharer and the recipient are in similar positions.\nBoth need, or want, infertility treatment services in order to have a\nchild (HFEA 2011; Prainsack & Buyx 2011). \nHowever, whether this really justifies the differential treatment of\nbenefits-in-kind (treatment services) and monetary reward is far from\nclear. One reason for doubt is that, as the HFEA notes: \nWhat is known about donor motivation … is that it is\nmultifaceted. People make decisions for a range of reasons, and\ncompetent adults are capable of assessing the relative benefits,\nburdens and likely impact of a range of options available to them. An\nincentive to donate does not necessarily mean people will do so purely\nbecause of that incentive. Indeed, the literature suggests that both\ndonors and sharers have mixed motives for donating. (HFEA 2011:\nsection 2, 4.4 [p. 8]) \nThis suggests that, in relation to solidarity, there is no categorical\ndifference between payment and benefits-in-kind. While some egg\nsharers may be motivated mainly by feelings of solidarity, others may\nbe more interested simply in saving money. Conversely, while some paid\ndonors would be ‘in it just for the money’, others\n(perhaps those whose close friends or relatives have fertility\nproblems, or who have experienced health problems of their own) could\nbe moved to donate because of feelings of solidarity (the fact that\nthey are financially rewarded notwithstanding). As such, it is by no\nmeans obvious that all egg sharers are motivated by feelings of\nsolidarity, or that all paid donors would fail to have this feeling.\nIndeed, it is by no means obvious even that most egg sharers\nare motivated by feelings of solidarity and there is empirical\nevidence suggesting that the number of sharers significantly decreases\nwhen state funded treatment is made widely available (Pennings\n2009). \nFinally, and more fundamentally, even if donations motivated\nby altruism or solidarity were morally preferable to more\nself-interested ones (donations motivated purely by the desire for\nmoney, for example) it would not necessarily follow that the latter\nare wrong or should be prohibited. For, it may just be that the former\nare supererogatory: that while paid donation is merely\npermissible, unpaid donation is an act of generosity or solidarity\ngoes beyond what is morally permitted or required (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).","contact.mail":"s.wilkinson2@lancaster.ac.uk","contact.domain":"lancaster.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2017-06-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gametes-donation-sale/","author1":"Reuven Brandt","author2":"Nicola Williams","author1.info":"http://www.reuvenbrandt.com/","author2.info":"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/about-us/people/stephen-wilkinson","entry":"gametes-donation-sale","body.text":"\n\n\nThe donation and transfer of human gametes (eggs and sperm) for\nreproductive purposes raises many important and difficult questions.\nSome of these relate directly to policy and practice; others are more\nconceptual. Gamete donation occupies an interesting position within\nbioethics, having something in common both with other forms of\ndonation (blood and organs, for example) and with\nreproductive technologies not involving donation (ranging\nfrom IVF through to more controversial areas like cloning, embryo\nselection, and genetic modification). It also shares some features\nwith adoption and surrogacy, practices which also\n(arguably at least) involve the transfer or delegation of parental\nduties and rights. (See entries on\n cloning,\n eugenics,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n the donation of human organs, and\n parenthood and procreation.)\n \n\nConceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable ‘lens’\nthrough which to re-examine questions such as:\n\nWhat grounds parental rights and responsibilities?\n\nWhat rights and obligations do parents have regarding their\nchildren (actual or future) and to what extent can these be\ntransferred or delegated?\n\nIt also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as:\n\nShould there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm\ndonor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the\nbasis for these?\n\nDo donor-conceived children have a right to know about their\norigins? Should donor anonymity be permitted?\n\nWhat ‘matching’ and selection decisions should the\nprospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about\ndonors should they be given?\n\nIs it acceptable to ‘buy and sell’ gametes? And is\nthat any different morally from arrangements in which women are\noffered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for\nsome of their eggs?\n\nSuch questions are the subject of this entry.\n\n\nBefore proceeding, however, two matters of definition and scope should\nbe noted.\n\n\nFirst, this entry focuses on the donation of human gametes for\nreproductive purposes, as opposed to for research. The rationale\nfor this is that most of the interesting ethical and philosophical\nissues here concern, in one way or another, the moral and social\nrelations between the donors, parents (recipients), and children\ncreated, and these do not generally arise in the research context. The\nmain exception to this is\n section 4 (Payment)\n where similar questions of consent, exploitation, and harm have been\nraised in both research and treatment contexts (Baylis & McLeod\n2007).\n\n\nSecond, there is the question of what counts as (reproductive) gamete\ndonation. At least for the purposes of this entry, we intend the term\n‘gamete donation’ to apply to those situations in which\n–\n\n A (the donor) voluntarily provides B (the recipient\nor recipients) with gametes (paid or otherwise); and\n\n A expects that and/or intends that B will use those\ngametes to create C (a child or some children);\nand\n\n Both A and B expect that and/or intend that\nA will not become a social or legal parent of\nC.\n\nSince the rights and responsibilities that attach to parenthood are\ngenerally thought to be very weighty, determining whether or not\ngamete donors are parents is a question that has attracted much\nattention. While there is considerable overlap here with the\nliterature on the ultimate basis of parenthood more generally (see\nentry on\n parenthood and procreation)\n questions about parenthood in the context of gamete donation have\ngarnered much specific attention. One important element that\ndistinguishes the gamete donation literature examining parenthood from\nmore general discussions of parental rights and responsibilities is\nthe debate over the transferability of parental\nresponsibilities. If transferring parental responsibility is easily\npossible, then determining whether gamete donors are included amongst\ntheir offspring’s initial parents might not be of great\npragmatic importance. In addition to the debate about parental\nresponsibilities, some others suggest that gamete donors have certain\nnon-parental responsibilities towards their offspring. \nA common starting point for the claim that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is the intuition that individuals who\nreproduce by accident, due to faulty contraception for example,\npossess parental responsibilities for their genetic children (Weinberg\n2008; Nelson 1999; Fuscaldo 2006; Blustein 1997). The strength of this\nintuition is used as motivation for adopting a view that ascribes\nparental responsibilities on the basis of causal involvement in the\ncreation of a child (causal views) rather than a view that ascribes\nparental responsibilities only to those who voluntarily assent to them\n(voluntarist views). Many authors who argue that gamete donors are\nparents proceed by offering a theoretical justification for this\nintuition, then apply this justification to gamete provision.  \nFor instance, Nelson argues that our common-sense understanding of\nmoral responsibility is what best explains our intuitions about\nparenthood in unintentional pregnancy.  On this common-sense view,\nindividuals are morally responsible for the consequences of their free\nactions when (1) their actions are sufficient to bring about those\nconsequences, and (2) their actions are causally proximate to the\nconsequence in question. Nelson further argues that gamete donors’\ncausal involvement in creating children does not significantly depart\nfrom that of unintentional parents (or at least not in morally\nrelevant respects) and therefore that donors are equally parents\n(Nelson 1999, 2014).  Fuscaldo similarly argues that parental\nresponsibility in cases of accidental pregnancy is best explained by\nappeal to our standard account of moral responsibility, but argues\nthat the standard account holds individuals morally responsible for\nthe foreseeable consequences of their free actions. Since bringing\nchildren into existence is a foreseeable consequence of donating\ngametes, gamete donors have a moral responsibility to care for the\nchildren they help create (Fuscaldo 2006).  \nAnother route is to argue that reproduction is an unusual kind of\ncase, and that special rules apply when determining what moral\nresponsibilities arise from involvement in it. An example is what\nBenatar calls ‘reproductive autonomy’. Benatar argues that\nindividuals’ reproductive autonomy both entitles them to make\nreproductive decisions, and requires them to take responsibility for\nthe consequences of those decisions. He argues that this is a special\nfeature of our ability to reproduce that is not reducible to genetics\nor causality, and results in a presumptive duty to parent the children\ncreated from our gametes. This, he argues, best explains why parental\nresponsibility arises in accidental pregnancy cases. Though in some\ncircumstances the presumptive duty to parent one’s genetic\nchildren may be overridden, this is not the case for most instances of\ngamete provision (Benatar 1999). \nOne worry about Benatar’s argument is that its approach relies\ntoo heavily on stipulating that unique moral features attach to\nreproduction, and so risks begging the question. However, Rivka\nWeinberg offers an argument for a similar conclusion, but on more\ngeneral grounds. Weinberg argues that when individuals exercise\ncontrol over materials that pose grave risks to others (what she calls\n‘hazardous materials’) they are liable for the\nconsequences that arise, regardless of the precautions they take. As\nan example, she argues that an owner of a pet lion is liable for\ndamage done by the lion, regardless of the precautions the owner takes\nto keep the lion contained. Calling this the “Hazmat\nTheory”, Weinberg argues that it applies to gametes because\ntheir use can have morally weighty consequences for third\nparties—namely the children that may result from the union of\ngametes. Consequently, Weinberg argues that gamete providers are\nobliged to care for the children that result from the voluntary use of\ntheir gametes (Weinberg 2008). \nImportantly, none of the preceding arguments in favour of including\ngamete donors amongst a child’s parents rely on genetic\nrelatedness. It is not the genetic similarity between gamete donors\nand their biological offspring that is doing the work, but rather\nconsiderations about the kind of thing gametes are (things that can\ncreate people) and the activity that gamete donors engage in with\nthem. \nVelleman (2005, 2008), however, has argued that being parented by\nclose genetic relations is of great importance to the wellbeing of\nchildren, and that for this reason we ought to be sceptical of the\nease with which society permits the separation of social from\nbiological parenthood.  \nBayne argues that gamete donors are not parents because both causal\nand genetic accounts of parental responsibility suffer from a problem\nof regress, and thus fail as plausible grounds for parenthood (Bayne\n2003). For instance, if a person is the parent of the individuals\nproduced via their gametes, as they are according to Benatar, then it\nis unclear why parenthood should stop at the gamete donor and not the\ndonor’s parents, or great grandparents etc. This because the\ndonor is the product of the gametes of these previous generations.\nSimilarly, on a causal account like the one offered by Nelson, if a\nchild was caused to exist by the actions of a sperm donor, then why\nnot think that the person whose actions are responsible for the\nexistence of the sperm donor is similarly a parent of the child. \nIt is however unclear whether Bayne’s criticism in fact applies\nto Nelson and Benatar’s views. Nelson does appeal to causal\nproximity, but explicitly rejects the view that merely being part of\nthe causal chain resulting in the creation of a child is sufficient\nfor parenthood (Nelson 1991, 53). Benatar’s view does not rest\non the genetic similarity between gamete donors and their children,\nbut rather the autonomy individuals exercise over reproductive\nmaterials. While Bayne highlights a problem that causal accounts must\nresolve—namely where to draw the line in the causal\nchain—he does not show that Nelson and Benatar’s view\nsuccumbs to this problem. \nA better route for challenging the view that gamete donors acquire\nparental responsibilities is to question whether\nresponsibilities of this kind arise from causal involvement in\nprocreation. For instance, Brake (2005, 2010) argues that while\ncertain obligations towards children might arise as a result of causal\ninvolvement in procreation, it is a mistake to think that this\nincludes the particularly intimate and weighty obligations subsumed in\nparenthood. More will be said about this argument in\n section 1.4. \nBayne (2003), Fuscaldo (2006), and Benatar (1999) all argue that even if gamete\ndonors have parental responsibilities for their offspring initially,\nthis does not mean that these cannot be transferred to others. In\nfact, there are circumstances where such transfers occur and we do not\nthink they are problematic at all—adoption being one example.\nFuscaldo (2006) argues that it is commonplace for parents to transfer\nsome of their responsibilities to others (like the responsibility to\neducate their children to teachers, for example) and so we should not\nthink it strange for individuals who are initially parents to transfer\nall their responsibilities to willing and competent others\n(see also O’Neill 1979). Though Benatar (1999) holds that gamete donors\noften fail to take sufficient care when transferring their\nresponsibilities to others, under the right conditions, transferring\nparental responsibilities is both permissible and possible.  \nBy contrast, some authors argue that such a transfer of responsibility\nis not possible, or at least not ethically permissible, at all\n(Velleman 2008; Weinberg 2008; Nelson 1991; Brandt forthcoming). For\ninstance, Velleman (2008) argues that while adoption is acceptable\nwhen there is no other means to provide a child with an adequate life,\nthis should not be confused with the intentional creation of children\nwhose social link to their genetic parents will be severed. Because\nVelleman believes that preserving the social connection between\nchildren and genetic parents is of great importance for the wellbeing\nof children, he argues that, unless there is pressing reason to do\notherwise, children ought to be parented by their genetic\nprogenitors. \nWeinberg (2008) argues that parental responsibilities cannot be\ntransferred in full because certain kinds of intimate responsibilities\ncan only be fulfilled by particular individuals: individuals in the\nright intimate relationship. For instance, a parent cannot transfer\nthe obligation to support her child by attending a music or dance\nrecital to a stranger. Since Weinberg thinks that gamete donors have a\nresponsibility to love their children and that, because responsibility\nto love a particular person is paradigmatic of the kind that cannot be\ntransferred, at least some donor responsibilities are not\ntransferable. \nTaking a slightly different approach, Brandt argues that much of the\ndebate regarding the transferability of parental responsibilities\nfailed to distinguish delegation from transfer. He argues that the\nimportant difference between the two is that in the former, delegators\nremain responsible for ensuring that the responsibilities get\nfulfilled, and thus are not fully alienated from them. He suggests\nthat, when re-examined with this distinction in mind, the main\nexamples offered in favour of the transfer of parental\nresponsibilities in fact only support the permissibility of their\ndelegation (Brandt forthcoming). For instance, parents have a duty to\nensure that their children are in fact receiving proper education from\ntheir teachers, and thus Fuscaldo’s example provides a case for\nthe delegation but not transfer of parental responsibilities. \nMany authors argue that responsibilities arise for gamete donors that\ndo not rest on their status as parents. Bayne (2003) suggests that,\nthough gamete donors are not parents, they may have the responsibility\nto prevent certain kinds of lives from coming about. For instance,\nthey may be obliged to refrain from creating children with severe\ncongenital diseases that would result in a ‘life not worth\nliving’. Many authors (Bayne 2003; Archard 2010; Porter 2014;\nFuscaldo 2006; O’Neill 1979) also think that gamete donors must\ntake steps to ensure that their offspring will be parented in at least\na minimally acceptable manner. \nWhile the responsibilities mentioned above can be fulfilled prior to\nproviding gametes, some authors think that certain non-parental\nresponsibilities continue to exist after a child has been created,\neven if appropriate precautionary steps (e.g. choosing intending\nparents carefully, screening gametes for congenital diseases, etc.)\nwere taken. For instance, Brake (2010) argues that gamete donors might\nhave an ongoing duty to ensure that their biological offspring receive\nat least a minimum level of care (she calls these ‘procreative\ncosts’) but that this should not be confused with parental\nresponsibilities, which are more intimate and more morally weighty in\nnature. However, Prusak (2011) argues that the gap between\nBrake’s ‘procreative costs’ and parental\nresponsibility is not as pronounced as it initially appears. Like\nBrake, Porter (2012, 2014) similarly argues that gamete donors must\ncontinue to take steps to ensure that their offspring have a decent\nlife, though they are not necessarily obligated to parent their\noffspring themselves.  \nAnother kind of non-parental obligation that gamete donors might have\nis to remain open to the possibility of forming relationships with\ntheir biological offspring, though this openness does not entail an\nobligation to in fact form such relationships (Little 1999). \nIn addition to obligations that focus on the health of potential\noffspring and the competence of intending parents, another question is\nwhether there ought to be limits on the number of offspring that can\nbe created from a single gamete provider. This question is most\nsignificant in sperm provision because of the relative ease of\ncreating large numbers of children from the gametes provided by a\nsingle individual. Three major justifications have been offered for\noffspring limits: the risk of accidental consanguineous relationships,\nthe likelihood of convoluted social relationships with kin, and\ngeneral social discomfort with large offspring numbers (Wright 2016).\nWhile the last might not be a plausible justification on its own, it\nis worth mentioning because in practice such concerns have had an\ninfluential role in the imposition of offspring limits (Deech 1998;\nWarnock Report 1984). \nLimiting offspring numbers in order to reduce the likelihood of\naccidental consanguineous relationships between offspring of the same\ndonor was initially proposed by individuals concerned about possible\nhealth risks to subsequent generations (Curie-Cohen 1980). Recent work\nhas been undertaken in an attempt to quantify these risks and the\nincreased risk of congenital disease that such relationships pose (De\nBoer et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2007). While the increased risk of\nunintentional consanguinity is dependent on the size of the population\nserved by a sperm bank, the risk is lower than might be initially\nthought. For instance, models developed by the Dutch suggest that an\noffspring limit of up to 25 would not result in any significant\nincreased risk, given their particular demographic makeup (De Boer et\nal. 1995). In addition to the increased risk of congenital disease,\nthere is a risk of psychological harm for individuals that discover\nthey have unwittingly entered into a consanguineous relationship,\ngiven the associated social taboos (Wright 2016). Furthermore, there\nmay be legal complications if an accidental consanguineous marriage is\ndiscovered after the fact (Cahn 2009a). One way to mitigate these\nrisks without imposing offspring limits would be to increase openness\nin gamete provision, including actively informing individuals about\nthe identity of their genetic siblings. However, even in the absence\nof such measures there is little agreement about how the risks\nassociated with consanguinity should be translated into offspring\nlimits, especially given the broad freedom individuals are generally\nafforded in their reproductive decisions (Wright 2016; HFEA 2011). \nThe main worry in relation to social relationships with kin is that\ninitiating and maintaining relationships with progenitors and/or\ngenetic siblings is made much more challenging if there are large\nnumbers to accommodate. The extent to which this justifies offspring\nlimits will depend on the importance placed on such relationships and,\nas noted previously, there is much disagreement about this.\nFurthermore, some empirical research into kin relationships following\ngamete provision has found that having large numbers of genetic\nsiblings is not necessarily an impediment to the formation of\nmeaningful relationships (Freeman, Jadva, & Slutsky 2016). \nThere is general agreement that prospective parents ought to be able\nto enter into arrangements with gamete donors that specify certain\nkinds of engagement between the donor and future child, such as the\nprovision of detailed biographical information or even ongoing\ncontact. However, gamete donation arrangements in which there is an\nexpectation that donors remain anonymous are more contentious. While\nsome intending parents and donors prefer anonymous donation, there has\nbeen much discussion about the ethical permissibility of such\narrangements.  \nAdvocates of children’s rights to access identifying information\nabout their donors generally defend their view by pointing to the\npossible harms that might arise in the absence of such information,\nand/or the purported fundamental right that individuals have to\ninformation about their origins (Ravitsky 2010, 2012; Velleman 2005,\n2008; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001; Blyth & Farrand\n2004). Possible harms considered include psychological distress,\ndamaged familial relationships, reduced self-knowledge, and incomplete\nor incorrect medical records. Those who favour permitting anonymous\ndonation argue that it is a mistake to place a great deal of\nimportance on genetic origins, and question both the severity of the\nharms caused by anonymous donation and whether the existence of such\nharms even constitute an argument against donor-anonymity\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). \nThe philosophical debate takes place within a background of changing\nlegal norms governing donor anonymity (Clark 2011; Frith 2001;\nBernstein 2010). While maintaining donor anonymity was once common\npractice (and is mandatory in certain jurisdictions, such as France)\nthere has been a strong trend towards enshrining in law\ndonor-conceived children’s rights to access identifying\ninformation about their donor, at least once they reach the age of\nmajority (Clark 2011; Frith 2001; Bernstein 2010; Brunet &\nKunstmann 2013).  \nOne reason for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is the distress\nthat advocates of disclosure claim many donor-conceived children\nsuffer as a consequence of the absence of identifying information\nabout their biological progenitors. This distress is sometimes\nreferred to as ‘genealogical bewilderment’, a term\noriginally coined in reference to the distress experienced by\nadoptees, and its symptoms are said to include difficulty developing a\npersonal identity that feels genuine, anguish about not knowing the\nidentity of one’s genetic relations, and an obsession with\ntrying to find out information about one’s genetic relations\n(Sants 1964; Cahn 2009b). Advocates of the right to know point to both\nscientific studies and general social observations, such as the rise\nof services to help donor-conceived individuals find their biological\nrelations, as evidence of the severity of this harm (McWhinnie 2001;\nFrith 2001; Ravitsky 2010). \nA related argument is that donor-conceived individuals are denied an\nimportant good if they are not given access to detailed information\nabout their biological relations. More than simply satisfying\ncuriosity, some argue that knowledge about one’s biological\nrelations (especially through contact) is important for self-knowledge\n(Velleman 2005, 2008). On this view, while a name and biographical\ndetails may not replace being reared by biological relations, they do\nat least provide donor-conceived individuals with some\ninformation, and make contact later in life possible.  \nHowever, both these arguments have been challenged on empirical and\nphilosophical grounds. While some studies do indeed show that a subset\nof donor-conceived individuals suffer psychological distress from not\nknowing the identity of their progenitors, others show that such\ndistress is not common, and generally not particularly severe\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Studies also show that early\ndisclosure helps children incorporate the fact that they were\ndonor-conceived into their identity and sense of self, thus helping\nthem avoid some of psychological harms associated with genealogical\nbewilderment (Golombok et. al. 2002). Advocates of the permissibility\nof donor anonymity thus argue that there is no clear evidence that\ndonor anonymity is likely to result in severe harm to offspring.  \nAdditionally, some argue that any psychological harm that does arise\nis likely socially constructed. They point to studies showing that\nindividuals who are unaware that they were donor-conceived do no worse\nthan their peers when it comes to psychological wellbeing\n(Melo-Martín 2014; Haslanger 2009). Consequently, they argue that any\npsychological harms experienced by donor-conceived individuals arise\nin virtue of the social importance placed on biological ties rather\nthan any ‘necessary’ deficit arising from being reared by\nindividuals who are not genetic relations. Similar arguments have also\nbeen raised in response to Velleman’s views regarding the value\nof contact with genetic relations for self-knowledge (Haslanger\n2009). \nIf the psychological harms arising as a consequence of donor-anonymity\nare socially constructed, then prohibiting anonymous gamete donation\nmay exacerbate these harms. Such a prohibition could further reify the\nimportance of biological ties (sometimes referred to as\n‘biologism’), which is what gives rise to the harms in the\nfirst place (Melo-Martín 2014; Leighton 2014; Haslanger 2009). \nAnother reason offered for prohibiting anonymous gamete donation is\nthat it prevents donor-conceived individuals from making health\ndecisions informed by family medical history. If individuals are not\ninformed about being donor-conceived, they risk making medical\ndecisions on the incorrect assumption that their social family’s\nmedical background reflects their own. And even if such individuals\nare informed that they are donor-conceived, they still suffer from an\nabsence of medical information that is generally available to others\n(Ravitsky 2012). While it is true that medical information could be\nprovided at the time of donation in a manner that preserves the\nanonymity of the donor, some argue that, as our understanding of\ncongenital disease changes, new information is likely to become\nrelevant (Leighton 2014; McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001).\nAdditionally, certain relevant medical conditions might only become\napparent long after the donation. While a system could be put in place\nfor donors to update their medical information, some argue that such a\nsystem would likely be too cumbersome for donor-conceived individuals\nto receive the medical information they need in a timely fashion\n(McGee, Brakeman, & Gurmankin 2001). \nHowever, those who defend the permissibility of donor anonymity argue\nthat the value of medical history is overstated, and will become less\nimportant as we move towards personalized medicine (Melo-Martín\n2014). In fact, in a report recommending against permitting\ndonor anonymity, the UK’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics stated\nthat medical interests alone were not sufficient grounds for\nprohibiting donor anonymity (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2013). \nAnother argument against donor anonymity is that secrecy about origins\nhas the potential to damage the relationships between donor-conceived\nchildren and their social parents, especially in cases where the\nsocial parent(s) know the identity of the gamete donor(s) Some argue\nthat the strain of having to ‘keep the secret’ is a cause\nof stress for social parents, and that this stress has a negative\nimpact on familial wellbeing (Landau 1998). A potentially more\nsignificant source of family tension is accidental disclosure,\nespecially when donor-conceived children are older. In this latter\ncase, several harms might arise, and may be greatly exacerbated if\nchildren were not aware that they were donor-conceived. Children might\ndevelop feelings of distrust towards their social parents, and may\nhave difficulty incorporating facts about their genetic history into\ntheir personal identity (Turner & Coyle 2000). \nWhile harms caused by both secrecy and accidental disclosure can be\nmitigated to some extent without making identifiable information\navailable, by simply disclosing to children at a young age that they\nare donor-conceived for example, some argue that more openness is\nbetter for familial unity, and that providing children with an\nopportunity to find out the identity of their donors (even if that is\ndelayed until they are older) is usually best (Nuffield Council on\nBioethics 2009). \nThose who favour permitting anonymous gamete donation argue that, at\nbest, the evidence suggests a slight improvement in familial wellbeing\nwhen information about a donor is provided along with disclosure about\nthe method of their conception. Families in which children do not have\naccess to identifying information about their donors still report good\nhome-life and have positive relationships with their parents\n(Melo-Martín 2014). Thus, while non-disclosure might not be optimal,\nit is probably not so harmful that it falls outside of the domain of\nparental discretion. Furthermore, if the harms are socially\nconstructed, as some have argued is the case in genealogical\nbewilderment, then we may have additional reasons for concluding that\nthe harms to family cohesion do not justify prohibiting anonymous\ndonation, since doing so would only further contribute to biologism\n(Melo-Martín 2014). \nThe arguments against donor anonymity considered thus far focus on\nharms that might arise as a result of the practice. Another kind of\nargument is that individuals have a fundamental right to knowledge\nabout their origins. In the legal literature, some have argued that\nthe UN’s Declaration on The Rights of The Child and the European\nConvention on Human Rights establishes individuals’ rights to\ninformation about the circumstances of their conception, including\ninformation about their progenitors (Blyth & Farrand 2004). Apart\nfrom appeals to such declarations of rights, some attempts have been\nmade to motivate recognition of a fundamental right to know via appeal\nto other fundamental goods. \nOne strategy is to tie the right to know to the right to an identity.\nHere the argument is that individuals require genuine facts about\ntheir biological history in order to develop a proper personal\nidentity (Ravitsky 2010). However, one response is that that while\nchildren have a right to an identity, they do not have a right to a\nparticular kind of identity, such as one based primarily on\nhistorical biological ties (Allen 1996). Another route is to argue\nthat children have a right to be respected, and that hiding facts\nabout their origins is a form of deception that we ought not permit\n(Freeman 1996). However, deception about origins is only a severe form\nof disrespect if we think that biological ties are important in the\nfirst place, and thus this argument risks begging the question. \nOffspring’s ability to access adoption records have oscillated\nquite substantially over the past century and a half, even within the\nsame jurisdiction (Samuels 2000). More recently, regulatory structures\nhave shifted in favour of providing adoptees with a legal right to\naccess identifying information about their progenitors (Besson 2007,\nHildebrand 1999). In such jurisdictions, some have argued that,\nbecause gamete donation is sufficiently similar to adoption,\nregulatory consistency demands that anonymous gamete donation be\nprohibited as well (Pratten v.  British Columbia (Attorney\nGeneral) 2012 BCCA 480; Chisholm 2012; Cahn 2009c – see\nOther Internet Resources). While this parity argument only goes so far\nin the absence of philosophical justification for prohibiting\nanonymous adoption (mere consistency could conversely be achieved by\npermitting anonymous adoption) it does give pause to examine the\nrelevant similarities between the two practices. \nThe core of the parity argument is that in both adoption and gamete\ndonation, children are reared by individuals other than their genetic\nprogenitors. If we think that access to information about genetic\nprogenitors is important enough to be elevated to the status of a\nright in adoption, then we ought to extend the same right to\ndonor-conceived individuals as well.  \nIn response, Leighton has argued that there are important disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation such that there may be no\ninconsistency in prohibiting anonymity in one case but not the other\n(Leighton 2014). For instance, adoptees are generally relinquished by\ntheir initial parent(s), and are often not raised by either of their\ngenetic parents. In the case of gamete donation there is no similar\nrelinquishing of parenthood, and often one of the genetic parents is\nalso a social parent. These differences may very well result in\ndivergences in the experiences of adoptees and donor-conceived\nindividuals. For instance, adoptees might feel abandoned by their\ninitial parents, and be curious about why they were relinquished,\nsomething that is unlikely to be the case in gamete donation.\nFurthermore, Leighton argues that since adoption has a history of\nstigmatization in the West while gamete donation has no such history,\nthere is good reason to think that the psychological impact of\nanonymous adoption on adoptees will be different from the\npsychological impact of anonymous gamete donation on donor-conceived\nindividuals (Leighton 2014).  \nWhile simply demonstrating that there are relevant disanalogies\nbetween adoption and gamete donation does not show that anonymity is\npermissible in the latter case but not the former, it does show that\nit is not outright inconsistent to have different policies governing\nanonymity for each.  \nRecipients of donated gametes often wish to have some say in what\ntheir donor is ‘like’. The characteristics made available\nto inform donor selection decisions differ greatly dependent on both\nthe countries and clinics in which such choices are made. However,\nsuch information tends to include medical, morphological, and\nbiographical information similar to that found on dating websites,\nsuch as hair colour, eye colour, ethnicity, educational attainment,\njob type, hobbies, and religion. \nFew commentators suggest that recipient-parents should be barred\ncompletely from accessing information about prospective donors, but\nneither is it generally assumed that they should be afforded\nunfettered liberty to choose their donors’ characteristics.\nThus, the debate in this area tends to focus on where the line between\nmorally acceptable and unacceptable selection practices lies. \nThree main categories of motivation underlie donor selection\ndecisions. \nThe first is selection against donors posing a threat to the physical\nwellbeing of pregnant women. This form of selection is ubiquitous such\nthat the barring of donors with sexually transmissible diseases such\nas HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis is mandated by national and\ninternational guidelines on gamete donation (see, for example HFE Act\n2008: s. T52 – see Other Internet Resources). This motivation for\nselection is widely seen as morally unproblematic and will, for this\nreason, be largely ignored here. \nThe second and third categories of motivation, termed here, selection\nfor ‘matching’ and selection for ‘design’ are,\nunlike the first, based on parental and/or societal preferences or\nvalues. In practice, most donor selection decisions will fall into\nboth categories, but a theoretical distinction is nonetheless made\nbetween the two in the philosophical literature.  \nSelection for ‘matching’ is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child who bears a similarity to the recipient parents.\nThus, gamete donors are selected (or deselected) by reference the\nextent to which their physical (and sometimes social and\npsychological) characteristics match those of recipient parents. As\nBraverman and Frith (2014) note, the aim of this practice is often:\n \nto enable secrecy and concealment of gamete donation. This practice\nincorporates a popular knowledge of genetics and enables the child to\n‘pass’ as a naturally conceived child. This is an attempt\nto avoid overt ‘difference’ between child and couple and\nwhen a good match is achieved the donor disappears from view.\n(Braverman & Frith 2014: 135) \nThere may however, be aims other than secrecy and concealment. These\nmay have their basis in concerns regarding compatibility (wanting our\nchildren to be ‘like us’ and to ‘fit in’)\n(Ruddick 2000), premised on physical or psychological desire (we often\nchoose our reproductive partners because they possess characteristics\nthat please us), or even with the aim of avoiding offence - a member\nof a couple may be offended if his/her partner prefers a donor with\ncharacteristics markedly different from his/her own (Pennings 2000).\nImportantly, matching motivations are distinguished from other\nmotivations for selection as they are limited only to desires to\nselect for donors with characteristics possessed by one/both intended\nsocial parents and should be based only in a desire to attain\nresemblance between parent and child. \nSelection motivated by design, however, is performed with the aim of\ncreating a child with characteristics which may or may not be\npossessed by the recipient parents but which are, nonetheless, deemed\nby them (and/or society) to be desirable (and often advantageous).\nSuch selection may thus be performed with several aims in mind. These\ninclude but are not limited to desires to increase the life prospects\nof one’s children by preventing the birth of children with\ndisadvantageous or without advantageous characteristics, to satisfy\npreferences for a particular ‘kind of child’, or with the\neugenic aim of improving the gene pool through the selection of donors\ndeemed to possess ‘superior’ heritable traits. \nOf these two categories, a desire for matching is generally\nthought to be less morally problematic than a desire for\ndesign, since desires for familial resemblance, secrecy\n(within limits), and to avoid offence are often considered relatively\nbenign. This is not, however, to say that no critical work has been\ndone on this topic as shall be seen in\n subsection 3.3 which looks to the\nquestion of whether race-based matching and selection practices are\nmorally permissible. \nDesign-based motivations for selection, however, have been the subject\nof a great deal more debate. This discussion largely mirrors (or is\nsubsumed by) many of the discussions had regarding the ethics of\nselective reproductive technologies, such as pre-implantation and\npre-natal genetic diagnosis, and such topics as sex selection and\nhuman enhancement (see entries on\n pregnancy, birth & medicine,\n and\n eugenics).\n For, although in the context of gamete donor selection there are no\nembryos or fetuses involved, nor genetic manipulation performed, there\nhas been much focus on questions of: \nWith this in mind, throughout the following subsections such debates\nwill be explored in turn. \nThe desire to have a child free from disability and disease is often\nconsidered the least contentious ground for gamete donor selection.\nParents and prospective parents, after-all, tend to want the best for\ntheir children and diseases and disabilities can make the attainment\nof a ‘good life’ life harder. Given this, and the fact\nthat donor selection, unlike other forms of selective reproduction,\nraises few thorny questions regarding women’s rights over their\nown bodies and the moral permissibility of abortion or the destruction\nof embryos, the dominant position among philosophers regarding gamete\nselection for the purpose of disability avoidance is one of\npermissiveness (see for example: Robertson 1994; Glover et\nal. 1989; Glover 2006; Strong 1997; Bennett 2001; Wilkinson\n2010). Robertson (1994) sums up this view well when he states: \nThe desire not to have a child with serious defects is not itself\nimmoral, and actions to avoid such a reproductive outcome should be\nrespected as an important aspect of procreative liberty. The question\nthen is what means to achieve that goal are acceptable…\nPreconception selection by voluntary selection of mates or gametes\nraises the fewest problems… Concern with the genetic fitness of\na mate may not be romantic but it is rational if one is concerned\nabout the health of spouse and offspring. Mate selection should thus\nbe left to the individual. Similarly, the selection of a gamete donor\nshould be left to the couple that needs this service. (Roberson 1994:\n154) \nSome go further, arguing that donor selection for the purpose of\ndisability-avoidance is not merely permissible but, in certain\ncircumstances, obligatory (see, for example: Savulescu 2001; Savulescu\n& Kahane 2009; Harris 1985, 2002; Buchanan et al 2000; Glover\n1989; Glover 2006). Discussions regarding this matter have tended to\nfocus less on gamete donor selection and more on the selection of\nembryos and fetuses through pre-implantation and pre-natal genetic\ndiagnosis. However, as Holm and Bennett (2014) and Williams (2017)\nnote, arguments suggesting a moral obligation to select against\ndisability in these contexts apply to gamete donor selection too. \nIndeed, that this is the case can be seen clearly in the negative\nmedia reaction and public outrage directed towards a deaf couple who,\nafter deliberately conceiving a deaf child in the early 2000s via the\nuse of a 5th generation deaf sperm donor, were vilified by\nthe tabloid media and condemned by the US National Association of the\nDeaf. (For interesting and insightful commentaries on this case see\nSavulescu 2002; Spriggs 2002; Fahmy 2011.) It can also be seen in\nthe fact that many countries require that clinics screen out\npotential donors for heritable diseases prior to their inclusion on\nthe donor register. A notable example of this is the UK’s Human\nFertilisation and Embryology Act which, since 2008, has included a\nclause prohibiting the selection of gamete donors and embryos  \nthat are known to have a gene, chromosome, or mitochondrion\nabnormality involving a significant risk that a person with the\nabnormality will have or develop: (a) a serious physical or mental\ndisability, (b) a serious illness, or (c) and other serious medical\ncondition. (HFE Act 2008, s. 14(4)(9) – see Other Internet\nResources) \nYet on what grounds might such an obligation be based? Some suggest\nthat a moral basis for such an obligation may be found by focusing\non the interests of and/or the rights of the children that will result\nfrom our procreative decisions (see Davis 2001 for a\nrights-focused approach). Arguments falling into this category thus\nfocus on person-affecting reasons, picking out the harms or limits to\nopportunity associated with certain disabilities as providing good\nreason to select against donors with traits liable to result in such\nharms and limits to opportunity. Such an approach is intuitive.\nHowever, given the conclusions of the Non-Identity Problem (see entry\non\n the non-identity problem),\n many question the logic of appeals to the interests of the child\ncreated in all but cases of the most severe disabilities. For, as it\nis generally held that a life with a disease or disability is better\nthan no life at all, and selection decisions alter who it is that\ncomes to exist rather than the prospects of determinate future\npersons, a focus on the interests of future children cannot ground\nsuch an obligation (Bennett 2009; Parfit 1984; Parker 2007; Robertson\n1994). \nOthers suggest that although the objects of our procreative efforts\nmay not be harmed by being born with a disability prospective parents\nmay nevertheless have good moral reason to select against disability\nin their offspring on the basis of other considerations. These include\nappeals to the interests of others whose interests may be affected by\nour reproductive decisions such as existing children and other\ndependents (Roberts 2009) and taxpayers in countries with socialized\nmedical and welfare systems (Heyd 1995; Fahmy 2011; Rakowski 2002;\nWilliams 2017); appeals\nto the claim that to fail to take reasonable steps to prevent\ndisability in one’s future children is contrary to common\nconceptions of the good parent (Steinbock & McClamrock 1994); and\nto the suggestion that that those who fail to avoid disability in\ntheir offspring act wrongly as they deliberately or negligently choose\nto create a state of affairs that is strictly worse (in terms of some\nparticular value such as happiness/preference satisfaction) than the\nstate of affairs that could have been created had they chosen\ndifferently (Harris 1985; Parfit 1984; Glover 1989; Glover 2006). (See entry on\n eugenics\n for a more detailed treatment and criticisms of different arguments\nin support of an obligation to select against disability.) \nSuch arguments have been criticized by many who suggest that parental\nobligations to their offspring cannot be so strong as to ground an\nobligation to select against disability (Williams 2017); that  \ncomplex concepts such as the good life, the best life, and human\nflourishing, are not reducible to simple elements or constituent parts\nwhich might be identified by the testing of embryos [and selection of\nsperm donors]; (Parker 2007: 281)  \nand that appealing to impersonal harms devalues those with\ndisabilities by suggesting that their lives are worth less than those\nwithout disabilities (Asch 2003; Bennett 2009). Yet, whilst such\nauthors tend to suggest that there cannot be an obligation to select\nagainst disability, they also suggest that prospective parents should\nbe at liberty to do so. Among a number of authors associated with the\ndisability rights movement however, a different claim is made. For,\nsuch authors suggest that not only can there be no moral obligation to\nselect against disability, parental preferences to screen out disabled\ndonors are morally problematic for two reasons. \nThe first regards the messages that such preferences send about and\ntowards persons living with disabilities, ones which may be seen as\ndiscriminatory and offensive: “express[ing] a hurtful attitude\nabout and a hurtful message to people who live with\n[disabilities]” (Parens & Asch 1999: S2). \nThe second is that the desire to select against disabling genetic\ntraits is based on misinformation regarding both the severity and true\nnature of disability. In terms of severity, for example, it has been\nwidely reported that persons with disabilities tend to report good\nquality of life despite the fact that most (non-disabled) observers\nsuggest the opposite (for work on the disability paradox see Albrecht\n& Devieger 1999). Regarding the true nature of disability, it is\nclaimed that contrary to the views of many, who hold that disability\nis inherently disadvantageous, many (and, for those who take an\nextreme approach, all) of the harms associated with disability are\nsocially constructed. That is, they are often not the result of\nfailures in functioning but society’s failing to account for\neveryone when designing physical, economic, and social institutions\n(Glackin 2010). Thus, it is suggested that as disability is often not\na feature intrinsic to those who suffer it, to attempt to prevent\ndisability by preventing the existence of persons with inabilities is\nvery much akin to attempts to prevent sexism or racism by preventing\nthe births of black people and women: an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem (Asch 2003). Taken to extremes, however, social\nconstructivism is often viewed as irredeemably flawed by the academic\ncommunity and a great number of able bodied and disabled persons\nalike. Robert Kitcher expresses this well when he notes that if we\ntake a wholly social constructivist view  \nattempts to decrease the incidence of Tay-Sachs will be no different\nfrom Northern Indian sex selection or from anticipated future efforts\nto cure lesbians. (Kitcher 1996: 215) \n(See entries on\n parenthood and procreation\n &\n eugenics\n for more in depth discussion of the suggestion that they may be a\nmoral obligation to select against disability in our offspring and the\nentry\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for more information on models of disability.) \nQuestions and concerns have also been raised regarding the\nappropriateness of selection on the basis of characteristics related\nto ‘race’, such as skin, eye, and hair colour. Had gamete\ndonor selection been well known in the 1980s when discussion raged\nconcerning whether trans-racial adoption practices constituted a step\nin the right direction towards the social ideal of colour-blindness, a\nform of racial and cultural genocide, or something in between the two,\none might have expected to see similar discussions regarding donor\nselection. This however has not been the case and instead, the\nphilosophical literature on race-based selection has tended to focus\non the question of whether selection of race-based characteristics is\nappropriate at all. \nFor the most part this focus is due to contemporary debates regarding\nthe question of whether the concept of race is philosophically and\nscientifically defensible. Thus, work suggesting the removal of racial\nidentifiers on donor catalogues seems to owe a great deal to authors\nsuch as K. Anthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) who both deny\nthat race is a coherent concept and recommend discarding it entirely\n(see entry on\n race). \nFogg-Davis (2001), for example, suggests that both the practice of\nreproducing race through assisted reproduction and selecting donors on\nthe basis of different race-linked characteristics are problematic as\nthey raise two major linked ethical issues:  \none is the harm that racial stereotyping causes to individuals, and\nthe second is the public awareness that racial stereotyping is an\naccepted feature of this largely unregulated market.  \nShe suggests that those who use racial classification to inform donor\nselection decisions are saying that  \nrace is heritable and relevant to their vision of family\nstructure… that a person’s gametes are transmitters of\nracial meaning that can and should be selectively transmitted to their\nchild through the use of reproductive technologies. (Fogg-Davis 2001:\n18) \nHarris (1998) too questions the legitimacy of the desire to match\ndonors to recipient parents on the basis of race-linked\ncharacteristics such as skin tone, and hair and eye colour. He\nnotes: \nWhy do so many people firmly believe that children should be like\ntheir parents, particularly in terms of their general colour and\nracial characteristics? It is difficult not to view this desire, and\nattempts to implement it, as a form of ‘ethnic cleansing.’\nIt smacks very much of the pressure that so many societies and\ncultures have put upon their members not to ‘marry out’ or\nto put it more bluntly, not to mate with somebody of another tribe or\nrace. (Harris 1998: 21) \nOthers however suggest that there is  \nno evidence to suggest that racial prejudice accounts for why sperm\nbanks sort sperm donors according to race or why many prospective\nparents hope for a child of a particular race. (Fox 2009: 1860)  \nSuch authors suggest instead that racial preferences in gamete\ndonation are more likely to stem from a desire to replicate the family\nstructure of the biological family, to avoid deficient access to\nracial culture and consciousness, to increase their children’s\nprospects in unjust social contexts, or premised on a desire “to\nmake the donor invisible and to conform the new-founded family to the\nideal of the natural family” (Pennings 2000: 508). With this in\nmind, Fox suggests that although race-based selection should not be\ncondemned in all cases it is important to “soften the prominence\nof race in donor selection by taking measures to frustrate wholesale\nfiltering of sperm donors on the basis of race” (Fox 2009:\n1893). \nOthers still note that those who desire to select for race-linked\ncharacteristics for these ‘less objectionable’ reasons\nmust still consider the wider consequences of doing so. Agar (2004),\nfor example, when considering the question of selection for race and\nsexual orientation in the context of genetic engineering, suggests\nthat whilst the aim of increasing the life prospects of one’s\nchildren in racist and homophobic societies by selecting for\nheterosexual and light skinned offspring is not objectionable, such\npractices should not be permitted. Not only would such selection\ncollude with prejudice, constituting an inappropriate response to a\nsocial problem, but it would likely also undermine attempts to change\nracist and homophobic social attitudes and practices. \nGamete donor selection may also be motivated by a desire to parent a\n‘particular kind of child’ such as where a music lover\nseeks out a concert pianist in order to increase the likelihood that\nthe future child will possess such talents, or where a couple seek out\ngamete donors with genius level IQ in order to increase the likelihood\nof rearing an academically gifted child (as with the couples who\npurchased sperm in the 1990s from the ‘repository of germinal\nchoice’) (Plotz 2006) . \nSuch cases raise a different kind of concern about whether selection,\nwhen performed in order to satisfy these kinds of preferences,\nencourages and facilitates the development of ethically troubling\nattitudes on the part of prospective parents. \nThis concern has been expressed in various different ways. Some, for\nexample, suggest that selection motivated by such desires is\nincompatible with parental virtues such as ‘acceptingness’\n(McDougall 2007), ‘openness to the unbidden’ (Sandel\n2007), and ‘unconditional love’ (Herrisone-Kelly 2007).\nThose who take this view hold onto the traditional notion of the child\nas a gift and correspondingly suggest that parents ought to care, not\nabout the traits that their children possess, but about developing a\nloving relationship with and raising whatever child they receive.\nOthers take a more Kantian line, suggesting that such these parents\nare wrongfully instrumentalising their children: treating them as a\nmeans of fulfilling parental hopes and dreams rather than as entities\nwho, once born, exist for their own sake (Davis 1997). \nYet the suggestion that a selective mentality is incompatible with\nimportant parental virtues or problematically instrumentalises\none’s future children has been the subject of some debate.\nAuthors such as Ruddick (2000) and Green (2008), challenge the\n‘maternalist assumption’ that parents  \nwho want a child should accept and welcome any child they happen to\nreceive, prepared to appreciate the child’s developing\nindividuality, however different from their own. (Ruddick 2000: 102)\n \nThey hold instead that other conceptions of parenthood can, provided\nthey are not taken to extremes, be perfectly adaptive, and crucially,\ndo not require parents to refrain from all attempts to shape the\ncharacteristics of their prospective children. They suggest that\nparents should rightly be viewed as both guardians of the\nchildren’s future interests, and ‘gardeners’ who may\nshape and raise children in line with their own preferences and\npriorities. \nOthers question whether the virtues of the prospective parent are the\nsame as those of an existing parent. For, although some hold that a\ndesire to have a hand in the characteristics of one’s future\nchildren is part of a broader desire to parent and thus requires\n“committing oneself to acting and evaluating one’s actions\nand decisions in light of the project of parenthood” (Vehmas\n2001: 439), others argue that a desire to select is not incompatible\nwith such a commitment. Kamm argues, for example, that a distinction\ncan be made between ‘caring to have’ a particular child\nand ‘caring about’ one’s future children once born\nand suggests that there is little reason to assume that the desire to\nseek out certain attributes in one’s children is incompatible\nwith parental virtues or common conceptions of the good parent. She\nnotes  \none can know that one will care about someone just as much whether or\nnot she has certain traits and yet care to have someone that has,\nrather than lacks such traits. (Kamm 2009: 113)  \nThis is echoed by Wilkinson who, discussing a hypothetical example of\ntwo prospective parents who seek to ensure the birth of a blue eyed\nchild and agree that they will put it up for adoption after birth\nshould it not possess such characteristics, notes  \nit is not the desire to select that violates the principle of\nunconditional love [or other parental virtues], but rather the plan to\nreject the child if it does not live up to expectations… it is\nentirely possible to want to select characteristics while not having\nthis problematic attitude of rejection. (Wilkinson 2010: 29) \nSome suggest however that, although selection is not necessarily\nmorally problematic, we should still be concerned that a selective\nmentality may be a precursor of conditional, as opposed to\nunconditional, love once the child is born, or to unrealistic\nexpectations and feelings of entitlement. Thus, the suggestion here is\nthat people who go to great lengths and incur great expense in\nprocuring what are, for them, the ‘perfect’ gametes, may\nbe more likely to reject or otherwise mistreat their children should\nthey fail to develop the ‘right’ capacities and interests\n(see, for example: Kass 2003; Sandel 2007). Again, however, it is not\nat all clear that the link between a selective mentality in\nreproduction and overzealous and unforgiving parenting styles is a\nnecessary one, as the majority of parents are not liable to be so\nnaïve to “presume to know what they are getting simply\nbecause they had a hand in selecting some of their child’s\ngenetic features” (Fahmy 2011: 7), or indeed that gamete donor\nselection is as likely as other more expensive and\neffective forms of selective reproduction (such as genetic\nengineering) to produce such problematic expectations and\nattitudes. \nShould gamete providers be paid? If so, should such payments be\nlimited to compensation (possibly including compensation for time and\ninconvenience)? Or is incentivising or rewarding providers also\nmorally acceptable? \nIn favour of payment, the main reason cited is increased supply, thus\nenabling recipients to have children that they wouldn’t\notherwise have had—or, where scarcity per se is not an\nissue, giving recipients more choice. In addition, supporters of\npayment cite justice (gamete providers deserve to be rewarded) and\nautonomy (providers and recipients should be allowed to contract with\neach other as they see fit). Finally, pragmatic arguments are\nsometimes offered, such as the cost of prohibition or the possibility\nof its leading to an unregulated ‘black’ or\n‘grey’ market in gametes (Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004;\nWilkinson 2013) \nSome of the arguments and issues concerning payment for gametes\nclosely resemble ones arising in other areas such as organ sale, sex\nwork, and commercial surrogacy (see entries on\n exploitation,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n feminist perspectives on sex markets,\n parenthood and procreation, and\n the sale of human organs).\n We deal with these briefly here before moving on to consider in\ngreater detail some of the more distinctive issues raised by paying\ngamete providers. The focus here is on gametes for clinical use in\nhuman reproduction, rather than gametes for research purposes,\nalthough many of the same issues also arise in a research setting. \nOne of the most obvious issues is harm or risk to the providers\n(Resnick 2001; Steinbock 2004). \nIn the case of sperm, the physical risks of donating are negligible,\nbut concerns have been raised about psychosocial risks, especially if\none man is permitted to generate numerous offspring. What happens, for\nexample, if a single sperm donor produces hundreds of children and a\nsignificant proportion of those contact him years later? That could\nhave a significant impact on the man’s life (and on the welfare\nof the children, discussed below). One way of containing this risk\nwould be to limit donor offspring numbers; another would be to allow\ndonor anonymity, although that may be objectionable on other grounds\n(see our earlier discussions of donor anonymity and donor offspring\nlimits). \nProducing hundreds of children is unlikely to be a problem for egg\ndonors but, unlike sperm donors, these women do face non-negligible\nphysical risks: notably OHSS (Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome). \nAs with the organ sale debate, though, it is not clear why the\nexistence of these risks constitutes an objection to payment,\nas opposed to an objection to the whole practice of gamete\ndonation (paid or otherwise) since the risks don’t increase\nas a result of payment (Wilkinson 2013). In response to this, in the\ncase of sperm donation, it could be argued that the scenario where one\nman produces hundreds of children is much more likely to happen if\npayment is allowed, as some men seek to become ‘professional\nsperm donors’. As has been noted however it should be possible\nto neutralise this risk by enforcing donor offspring limits. \nAnother set of issues is the negative effect that payments, or\npayments above a certain level, are supposed to have on the quality of\nconsent—a concern that is closely linked to worries about\nexploitation. Financial incentives, it is argued, encourage people to\ndo things that they would not otherwise do, encourage them to do\nthings that are harmful, and make their actions, consents, and\ndecisions less likely to be autonomous and voluntary (Resnick 2001;\nSteinbock 2004; Wilkinson 2013). These arguments are more often\ndirected at paid egg donation than paid sperm donation, because the\ndirect physical risks and the sums of money involved for eggs tend to\nbe much greater. Thus, people have been concerned that vulnerable\nyoung egg donors might be lured into the egg market and then exploited\nby clinics, egg banks, or recipients. These concerns structurally\nparallel ones that people often have about commercial surrogacy and\nsex work. \nArguments of this kind are dealt with in much more detail in the\nentries on\n Exploitation,\n Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets,\n Parenthood and Procreation,\n Informed Consent, and\n The Sale of Human Organs.\n For the present, we simply note that, while the possibility of\ndefective consent and exploitation must be taken seriously in any\nsystem of paid gamete donation, there seems no reason in principle why\npaying for gametes must be exploitative, nor why it cannot be validly\nconsented to. Provided that the payment-levels are fair, and that the\nprovider’s situation, mental capacities, and access to\ninformation are all sufficiently favourable, it is hard to see\nwhy—in common with other financial transactions—gamete\nprovision can’t be validly consensual and non-exploitative. \nFinally, we note here that there is a connection between remuneration\narrangements and selection practices (discussed above). In particular,\none objection to allowing payment—or at least to the unfettered\ncommercialisation of gametes—is that it may encourage a market\nin which particular traits can, for those willing to pay a high price,\nbe aggressively selected for. For example, in the USA, young\nattractive white female egg donors attending ‘Ivy League’\nuniversities can command a higher fee for their eggs than other\ndonors—and anyone who is willing to pay can have access to those\neggs. So, anyone who regards selection practices like this as\nproblematic may also regard the commercialisation of gametes as\nproblematic inasmuch as it underpins and enables fine-grained\nselection by ‘gamete consumers’ to take place. \nWe turn now to some of the more ‘distinctive’ issues\nrelating to paying gamete donors. The first of these is the welfare of\nthe child created. While this issue is ‘distinctive’\ninasmuch as it applies only in the reproductive sphere (and so not to,\nfor example, organ sale) it does arise in other reproductive areas,\nnotably commercial surrogacy (Harris 2000). \nThe main worry here is that when donor-conceived children find out\nthat money is what primarily motivated the donor then, in some cases,\nthis will have adverse psychological effects; in the most extreme,\nthey may come to feel that they were ‘bought’ (HFEA 2011).\nWhat follows from this possibility, however, is unclear. \nTo start with, there are empirical questions about how many\ndonor-conceived people will feel this way and about how severe their\nnegative feelings (if any) are. Not all donor-conceived people have\nnegative feelings about donor motives and financial reward; some may\nnot care what their donors’ motives were. So, if this concern is\ngoing to ground an ethical argument against paying donors, a solid\nevidence base will be needed to underpin its empirical premises. \nSimilarly, there is a set of questions not so much about donors’\nactual motives are, but about what they write on their\ndonation papers, and about how and when information is conveyed to\ntheir offspring. One view is that, for the sake of the welfare of the\nchild, it would be better for donors to ‘tell a story’\n(even if not wholly accurate) that donor-conceived children will find\nmore palatable than the bare truth that the donor simply needed money.\nAnother is that if donor-conceived children are communicated with\nappropriately, honestly, and sensitively, and at an early stage then\nany problems associated with donor motives will be minimal (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics 2013). \nStill, let’s allow (at least for the sake of argument) that\nthese problems are insurmountable: that—whatever we do—a\nsignificant number of donor-conceived children will be substantially\nharmed by the knowledge that their donors were paid. What follows from\nthis? \nFirst, we should note that this area is subject to the implications of\nthe Non-Identity Problem (Parfit 1984). In particular, given that\n(let’s assume) many paid sperm donors would not have donated\nbut for the money, it is plausible to supposed that children who\nsuffer psychological harm when they find out about their donors\nwould not have existed if there hadn’t been payments.\nTherefore, for standard reasons relating to the Non-identity Problem,\nthey may not be harmed by the practice of payment—or at\nleast not in the usual comparative harm-to-interests sense (worse off\nthan they would otherwise have been). (See entry on the\n non-identity problem.)\n So, while there may still be a child welfare argument against\npayment, it must rely not on harm-avoidance but rather on impersonal\nwelfare considerations. \nGiven this, a lot hinges on whether payment is required to ensure an\nadequate supply of donor gametes. If it is not (if, for example, the\nreasons for paying people are quite trivial ones, such as\nadministrative convenience, or even allowing recipients more choice)\nthen the fact that payment will adversely affect donor welfare does\nlooks like a good (albeit prima facie) reason to prefer\naltruistic donation. Imagine that we have a choice between creating a\npopulation of donor-conceived children using paid donors or a\ndifferent but equally large population using altruistic donors. If (as\nwe’re allowing) the latter will have a higher quality of life\nthen there is a strong ‘impersonal’ reason, other things\nbeing equal, to prefer the latter: altruistic donation. Things look\nrather different though if the choice is instead between a population\nof donor-conceived children using paid donors or a different and\nsignificantly smaller population, for then it would be necessary\nto ‘trade off’ a higher average quality of life against\nboth (a) the fact that there are fewer lives overall and (b) any harm\ndone to prospective parents who are denied the opportunity to raise a\ndonor-conceived child. Any such moral calculation will be complex and\nthis goes to show that, in cases where payment is required to secure\nan adequate supply of gametes, this is not obviously wrong (all things\nconsidered) even if there are detrimental effects on donor-conceived\npeople’s quality of life (Wilkinson 2016). \nSome countries (notably the United Kingdom) either prohibit or\nstrictly limit payments to egg donors but allow an exception whereby\n‘egg sharers’ (women who are themselves undergoing\ninfertility treatment and wish to donate in return for reduced fees)\ncan receive unlimited benefits-in-kind in the form of cut-price\ninfertility treatment services. The UK, for example, limits payments\nto egg donors to £750 (approx. US$900) and yet egg sharers can\nhave their own treatment costs reduced by many thousands of pounds\n(HFEA 2017: guidance note 13). \nThis raises the question of whether ethically egg sharing is\npreferable to egg selling and, if so, why—along with the closely\nrelated question of whether egg sharing should be treated more\nfavourably in law and professional regulation (Blyth & Golding\n2008). \nThe main reason offered in favour of egg sharing is that\n‘sharers’ are exposed to less additional harm and/or risk\nthan donors (paid or otherwise), since they are already\nundergoing most of the required interventions as part of ongoing\ntreatment. It is supposed to follow from this that incentivising egg\nsharing (other things being equal) is less morally problematic than\nincentivising egg donation: either because of the putative wrongness\nof encouraging people to take ‘excessive’ risks, or\nbecause financial incentives may vitiate consent to those risks\n(Wilkinson 2013). \nThis does seem like a sound prima facie reason to prefer egg\nsharing although several caveats must be noted. First, some special\ntypes of risk may apply to egg sharers: for example, older women who\ndon’t have many viable eggs left might reduce their chances of\nhaving a child by giving away ‘surplus’ eggs (Scott,\nWilliams, Ehrich, & Farsides 2012). Second, and similarly,\nconcerns about consent may apply just as forcefully to egg sharers as\nto egg sellers, especially if some of these are\n‘desperate’ to have a child and egg sharing is their only\nway of paying for infertility treatment services (Blyth & Golding\n2008). Thirdly, as already mentioned, this argument—if it\nworked—would show egg sharing to be superior not only to paid\ndonation but also to altruistic donation, since the additional risks\nare the same whether paid or not (Wilkinson 2013). \nA different kind of reason for treating egg sharing more favourably\nthan egg selling is based on the idea that egg sharers’ motives\nwill typically by morally preferable to those of egg sellers. In\nparticular, it has been claimed that whereas egg sellers are typically\nmotivated by the desire for money, egg sharers act partly out of a\nsense of solidarity with potential recipients—in particular\nbecause both the sharer and the recipient are in similar positions.\nBoth need, or want, infertility treatment services in order to have a\nchild (HFEA 2011; Prainsack & Buyx 2011). \nHowever, whether this really justifies the differential treatment of\nbenefits-in-kind (treatment services) and monetary reward is far from\nclear. One reason for doubt is that, as the HFEA notes: \nWhat is known about donor motivation … is that it is\nmultifaceted. People make decisions for a range of reasons, and\ncompetent adults are capable of assessing the relative benefits,\nburdens and likely impact of a range of options available to them. An\nincentive to donate does not necessarily mean people will do so purely\nbecause of that incentive. Indeed, the literature suggests that both\ndonors and sharers have mixed motives for donating. (HFEA 2011:\nsection 2, 4.4 [p. 8]) \nThis suggests that, in relation to solidarity, there is no categorical\ndifference between payment and benefits-in-kind. While some egg\nsharers may be motivated mainly by feelings of solidarity, others may\nbe more interested simply in saving money. Conversely, while some paid\ndonors would be ‘in it just for the money’, others\n(perhaps those whose close friends or relatives have fertility\nproblems, or who have experienced health problems of their own) could\nbe moved to donate because of feelings of solidarity (the fact that\nthey are financially rewarded notwithstanding). As such, it is by no\nmeans obvious that all egg sharers are motivated by feelings of\nsolidarity, or that all paid donors would fail to have this feeling.\nIndeed, it is by no means obvious even that most egg sharers\nare motivated by feelings of solidarity and there is empirical\nevidence suggesting that the number of sharers significantly decreases\nwhen state funded treatment is made widely available (Pennings\n2009). \nFinally, and more fundamentally, even if donations motivated\nby altruism or solidarity were morally preferable to more\nself-interested ones (donations motivated purely by the desire for\nmoney, for example) it would not necessarily follow that the latter\nare wrong or should be prohibited. For, it may just be that the former\nare supererogatory: that while paid donation is merely\npermissible, unpaid donation is an act of generosity or solidarity\ngoes beyond what is morally permitted or required (Wilkinson &\nGarrard 1996).","contact.mail":"n.williams2@lancaster.ac.uk","contact.domain":"lancaster.ac.uk"}]
