It was established by Kazimierz\nTwardowski at the end of the 19th century in Lvov (i.e.,\nthe Ukrainian city of Lviv, which at that time was part of the\nAustro-Hungarian Empire). The LWS flourished in the years\n1918–1939. Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, Tadeusz Kotarbiński,\nStanisław Leśniewski, Jan Łukasiewicz and Alfred Tarski\nare its most famous members. It was an analytical school similar to\nthe Vienna Circle in many respects. On the other hand, the attitude of\nthe LWS toward traditional philosophy was much more positive than that\nof logical empiricism. Although logic became the most important field\nin the activities of the LWS, its members were active in all spheres\nof philosophy. World War II and political changes in Poland after 1945\ncaused the end of the LWS as an organized philosophical\nenterprise. One can consider it to have later been continued\nindividually by its representatives.\n\n\n\nKazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) began his post as professor of\nphilosophy at Lvov University in 1895. He came to Lvov from Vienna,\nwhere he had studied philosophy under Franz Brentano and Robert\nZimmermann. Twardowski belonged to the last group of Brentano’s\nstudents. His Habilitationschrift (1894) concerned the\nconcepts of the content and the object of presentations; it \nclarified and sharpened this important distinction. This work strongly\ninfluenced Meinong and Husserl. \n\nTwardowski appeared in Lvov with the ambitious plan of creating a\nscientific philosophy (in Brentano’s spirit) in Poland (at that time,\nPoland was partitioned between Austro-Hungary, Germany and Russia; Lvov\nbelonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.) In fact, he subordinated all\nhis activities to achieving this task and considerably limited his own\nscientific work. Twardowski was an extraordinary and charismatic\nteacher. He very soon attracted many young people to philosophy. After\nten years of teaching he sometimes had about 200 candidates for\nseminars and 2000 attendants of his lectures. He propagated a clear\nstyle of writing and speaking about philosophical matters, insisted\nupon justification of philosophical theses and sharply distinguished\nphilosophy as a science from world-views. Following Brentano, he\nfavoured problems on the borderline of descriptive psychology, grammar\nand logic (he supplemented his object/content distinction by that of\nactions/products). A photo of Twardowski’ seminar participants\ntaken during the 1925–1926 academic year is available (see\nthe supplement), with \nmost of the participants identified. Although Twardowski was not a logician and did not\nconsider himself as such, his program formed a friendly environment for\nlogic in all its subdomains: formal logic, semantics and methodology of\nscience. Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1956) was the first of Twardowski’s\nstudents to be interested in logic. He began his lectures in logic in\nLvov in 1906. Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (1890–1963), Tadeusz Czeżowski\n(1889–1981), Tadeusz Kotarbiński (1886–1981) and Zygmunt Zawirski\n(1882–1948) studied mainly under Twardowski, but they also attended\ncourses conducted by Łukasiewicz. Stanisław Leśniewski\n(1886–1939) joined this circle in 1910. Warsaw appeared on the stage\nexactly in 1915, when the University of Warsaw was reopened. The\nacademic staff was mainly imported from Lvov; Łukasiewicz was\nappointed professor of philosophy. \n\nPoland recovered its independence in 1918 and Polish scholars began\nto build national academic life. The program for the development of\nmathematics elaborated by a mathematician Zygmunt Janiszewski (the\nJaniszewski program) had a great importance for the subsequent\ndevelopment of the LWS. According the Janiszewski program, Polish\nmathematicians should concentrate on set theory, topology and their\napplications to other branches of mathematics. In particular, the\nJaniszewski program attached great importance to mathematical logic and\nthe foundations of mathematics. Two philosophers, namely\nLeśniewski and Łukasiewicz, became professors of the\nUniversity of Warsaw at the Faculty of Mathematical and Natural\nSciences. Both began intensive teaching of mathematical logic, mostly\namong mathematicians but also among philosophers. Thus, logic in the\nLWS had two parents: mathematics and philosophy. \n\nAlfred Tarski (1901–1983) opened the list of young mathematicians\nand philosophers attracted by logic in Warsaw. The logical community in\nthis city included (in alphabetical order and covering the whole period\n1918–1939: Stanisław Jaśkowski (1906–1965), Adolf Lindenbaum\n(1904–1941?), Andrzej Mostowski (1913–1975), Moses Presburger\n(1904?-1943), Jerzy Słupecki (1904-1987), Bolesław\nSobociński (1904–1980; a philosopher by training)) and Mordechaj\nWajsberg (1902–1942?). The names of three other logicians who graduated\nshortly before 1939 or studied during War World II and began their\nacademic work after 1945 should be added, namely Jan Kalicki\n(1922–1953; a mathematician), Czesław Lejewski (1913–2001; a\nclassicist and philosopher) and Henryk Hiż (1917; a\nphilosopher). \n\nThe development of logic in Warsaw had two subperiods in 1918–1939,\nnamely 1918–1929 and 1929–1939. The first decade consisted in intensive\nteaching and scientific work at the seminars of Leśniewski and\nŁukasiewicz. Not many results were published at that time. The\nexplosion of publications took place in 1929 and later. There are\nseveral factors which caused the development of mathematical logic\nin Poland. The Warsaw school of logic appears to be model case, but the\npower of this circle influenced other places where the general\nenvironment was not so favourable to logic. The fruitful co-operation\nof mathematicians and philosophers in Warszawa had the utmost\nsignificance. The founders of the Polish mathematical school made a\nbrave experiment consisting in inviting two philosophers with a modest\nmathematical background as professors at the Faculty of Mathematics and\nNatural Sciences; this did not happen in any other country. The gifts\nof Leśniewski and Łukasiewicz as teachers and the abilities\nof the latter as an organizer attracted young mathematicians. In Poland\nmathematical logic was considered to be an autonomous science, not a\npart of mathematics or philosophy. From the present-day point of view\nthis might seem as an exaggeration, but this ideology contributed\nessentially to the strength of Polish logic. Their representatives were\nfairly conscious of the fact that the propagation and defence of the\nautonomy of this field had to be confirmed by important scientific\nresults and international recognition. Moreover, this view about logic\nmotivated various purely theoretical investigations on formal systems.\nOn the other hand, Polish logicians strongly insisted that logic should\nnot be restricted only to mathematics and required the co-operation of\nrepresentatives of all field in which logic might be used. Still\nanother factor played an important role, namely the conviction about\nthe social significance of logic as a weapon against all kinds of\nirrationalism. Tarski once said “Religion [you can also say\n‘ideology’ — JW] divides people, logic brings them\ntogether.” According to Łukasiewicz, “Logic is\nmorality of thought and speech”. Thus, Polish logicians doing\nlogic and teaching it were convinced that they were performing an\nimportant social service. \n\nKotarbiński was appointed professor of philosophy in Warsaw in\n1919. His teaching activity resulted in a group of scholars working\nmainly in the philosophy of science, including Janina Hosiasson (later\nMrs. Lindenbaum; 1899–1942), Edward Poznański (1901–1976), Dina\nSztejnbarg (later Mrs. Kotarbiński) (1901–1997) and Aleksander\nWundheiler (1902–1957). \n\nTwardowski and Ajdukiewicz (appointed professor in 1928) remained in\nLvov. They trained a group that included Izydora Dąmbska\n(1904–1983), Maria Kokoszyńska (1905–1981), Henryk Mehlberg\n(1904–1978) and Zygmunt Schmierer (?–1943). Although Twardowski’s\nstudents also taught at other Polish universities (Czeżowski in\nVilna, Zawirski in Poznań and Kraków), Lvov and Warsawa\nwere the main centres of the LWS. The school was also joined by a group\nof catholic philosophers, including Father Innocenty (Józef) M.\nBocheński (1902–1995) and Father Jan Salamucha (1904–1944). \n\nWorld War II had disastrous consequences for the LWS. Twardowski and\nLeśniewski died before September 1, 1939. Of the people mentioned\nabove who lost their lives (mostly Jews murdered by the Nazis): the\nLindenbaums, Presburger, Salamucha, Schmierer and Wajsberg. Zawirski\ndied in 1947. Many emigrated from Poland during World War II or shortly\nafter it: Łukasiewicz (Dublin), Tarski (Berkeley), Hiż\n(Philadelphia), Kalicki (Berkeley), Lejewski (Manchester), Mehlberg\n(Toronto, Chicago), Sobociński (Notre Dame) and Wundheiler (New\nYork); Bocheński (Fribourge) and Poznański (Jerusalem, before\n1939). \n\nThe situation in Poland in 1945–1948 was similar as before 1939. The\nMarxist ideological offensive against bourgeois philosophy started in\n1949. The policy became more liberal after 1956. Although many scholars\nof the LWS actively taught and worked in the new political reality, it\nwould be difficult to say that the school continued its former manner\nof existence. The tradition of the LWS was rather preserved in\nindividual hands, but not as an organized enterprise. \n\nNote: the present essay focuses on the logical wing of the LWS. In\n1939, the entire school comprised about 80 scholars actively working in\nall branches of philosophy as well as in other academic fields, like\npsychology, sociology, theoretical linguistics, history of art and\nliterary studies. \n\nMost philosophers of the LWS understood philosophy as a collection of\ndisciplines, including logic, ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, and\nepistemology. Philosophy is a science, like any other. All members of\nthe LWS inherited from Twardowski his main metaphilosophical claims\nconcerning clarity, justification and the separation of philosophy from\nworld-views. It also meant a radical rejection of all kinds of\nirrationalism. A view, called anti-irrationalism by Ajdukiewicz,\ndemanded that every rationally accepted proposition be\nintersubjectively communicable and testable. Although there was no\na priori list of meaningful questions subjected to\nphilosophical work, one should be sceptical about so-called great\nmetaphysical problems and their scientific status. Philosophical\nactivity must begin with a very careful linguistic analysis of\ninvestigated problems and their meaning.  \n\nTwardowski himself favoured descriptive psychology as basic, but\nmany of his students found logic to be the most important source of\nmethodological criteria for philosophy. Perhaps Łukasiewicz was\nthe most radical in this respect. According to him, a reform of\nphilosophy was needed in order to avoid errors of the past. Philosophy\nshould proceed as logic does, axiomatically starting from clear\nconcepts and evident principles. Other philosophers of the LWS were\nmore modest and did not demand that philosophy should be axiomatized.\nHowever, logical analysis of philosophical discourse became the\nstandard method of analysis. Yet the task of philosophy is not limited\nto the analysis of language. Thus, philosophy, according to\nmethodological claims of the LWS, was analytic but not purely\nlinguistic. Philosophy is concerned with the world but it mainly\n(though not ‘only’) performs its task also by the analysis\nof language, which is used in speaking about reality. This view about\nphilosophy is to be contrasted with that of the Vienna Circle. In\nparticular, the LWS was not interested in a general metaphilosophical\nscheme that sharply divided philosophy into good and bad, but rather\nwith an analysis of concrete problems. Thus, the LWS was united more by\na common methodological attitude and very general claims concerning\nrationality than by a commonly accepted philosophical theory. \n\nHowever, some general views were shared by most (‘most’\nis very important here) members of the LWS. These include:\nanti-scepticism, anti-naturalism in humanities and axiology, realism in\nepistemology and philosophy of science, absolutism in epistemology and\naxiology, and empiricism. These views were characteristic for Brentano\nand became implemented in Polish philosophy by Twardowski. \n\nŁukasiewicz invented a parenthesis-free logical notation. The\nidea consisted in writing logical constants before their arguments.\nŁukasiewicz replaced the usual signs for logical operations by\nletters: N (negation), K (conjunction), A\n(disjunction), C (implication) and E (equivalence).\nAny well-formed formula (the present explanations are restricted to\npropositional calculus) must begin with a capital letter (propositional\nvariables are symbolized by lower-case Latin letters) which is the main\nfunctor of the entire formula. The main connective has as its arguments\nvariables or formulas consisting of variables and constants. The\nfollowing are examples: Cpp for (p →\np), CCppNq for ((p → p) →\n¬q). The structure of a formula (and hence also its\nmeaning) in Polish notation is uniquely determined by the position of\nthe letters. The parenthesis-free notation is unambiguous in the sense\nthat any finite sequence of symbols for connectives and variables is\ninterpretable in a unique way. This implies that any wff coded in\nPolish notation has only one translation into the standard symbolism.\nThe main advantage of Polish notation is its economy, because it avoids\nspecial punctuation devices such as brackets or dots. When\nŁukasiewicz met Turing in 1949, the latter remarked that Polish\nnotation was much better for computers, because formulas with\nfunction-symbols in front could be better elaborated by mechanical\ndevices. \n\nThe parenthesis-free symbolism was closely associated with some\nideas of Polish logicians concerning the good properties of formal\nsystems. Of course, any correct logical system should be consistent\nand, if possible, syntactically and semantically complete. It should\nalso be based on independent sets of primitive terms and axioms. The\nWarsaw School of Logic strongly emphasized the last property, often\nconsidered secondary. Thus, the dependence of primitive terms or axioms\nwas regarded as an essential defect. Moreover, some additional\nstructural properties of logical systems were recommended: (a) a system\nwith fewer primitive concepts is better; (b) a system with fewer axioms\nis better; (c) if we define the length of an axiom system as the number\nof symbols occurring in all of its axioms, the shortest axiom system is\nthe best; (d) a system with fewer different symbols is better; (e) if\nwe define an organic theorem as one which has no other theorem inside\nit (for example, the formula CpCqq is not an organic theorem),\norganic axioms are better than non-organic ones. Thus, the ideal axiom\nsystem consists of a sole organic axiom of the shortest possible\nlength, provided that it is consistent. Requirements (a)-(f) apply\nparticularly well to propositional calculus. They became the guiding\nprinciples of many logical investigations in the Warsaw School of\nLogic. Logicians of this school also made precise many important\nmetalogical concepts, including those of the logical matrix,\nconsequence operation, deductive system and model. \n\nŁukasiewicz formulated several axiomatic bases for the\nfunctionally complete propositional calculus, that is PC in which all\n16 binary connectives can be defined. The most popular is the\nN-C system, having as axioms the formulas:\nCCpqCCqrCpr, CCNppp, CpCNpq, and the usual\nrules of inference (substitution, detachment). This system is\nconsistent, independent, Post-complete (= semantically complete):\nŁukasiewicz and his collaborators invented new methods for proving\nthese properties. According to the criteria mentioned in the preceding\nsection, one should look for the simplest axiom bases. \n\nThe discovery of many-valued logic is commonly considered to be one\nof the major achievements of Łukasiewicz. He did it in 1918, a\nlittle earlier than Post. However, although Post’s remarks were\nparenthetical and extremely condensed, Łukasiewicz explained his\nintuitions and motivations carefully and at length. He was guided by\nconsiderations about future contingents and the concept of\npossibility. \n\nŁukasiewicz observed that no functor of classical propositional\ncalculus could be read as “it is possible that” and\nprovided that the formula Mp (it is possible that p)\nis extensional (i.e., that its value depends solely on the value of\np). The difficulty can be solved if we admit a third value.\nSentences about future contingent states of affairs are natural\ncandidates for having the third value (½). For example, the\nsentence “I will visit Warszawa next year”, is neither true\nnor false, it is merely possible and has the value ½. Its\nnegation has the same value. This idea led to three-valued logic. The\nusual equalities for N, A, Kand C\nare supplemented by (I list only some cases) p = ½ =\nNp, K ½½ = ½,\nA½½ = ½. Easy calculations shows that\nApNp and NKpNp have the value ½ for p\n= ½. This means that the laws of contradiction and excluded\nmiddle do not hold in three-valued logic. Later, Łukasiewicz\ngeneralized it to logics with an arbitrary finite number of values and\nfinally to an countably infinite number of values. The sense of\nimplication is given by the equations: \n\nand the sense of negation by the equation: \n\nIf we have only two values, these equations determine the usual\ntruth-tables for C and N. \n\nThree problems arose after discovering many-valued logic. The first\nconcerned its axiomatization and metalogical properties, the second its\nphilosophical foundations and intuitive interpretation, and the third\nits applications. Due to the work of Łukasiewicz himself, Wajsberg\nand Słupecki, the first group of questions was largely solved.\nWajsberg showed that the formulas: CpCqp,\nCCpqCCqrCpr, CCNpNqCqp, CCCpNppp axiomatize\nŁ3 (three-valued propositional calculus). The same\nauthor proved that a finite Łn is axiomatizable if it\nincludes the theorems: CCpqCCqrCpr, CCCqrCCpqCpr,\nCCqqCpp, CCpqCNqNp, CNqCCpqNq. If n\n=\n ℵ0, Łn\ncan be axiomatized by (Łukasiewicz’s conjecture, proved by\nWajsberg): CpCqp, CCpqCCqrCpr, CCCpqqqCCqpp,\nCCCpqCqpCqp, CCNpNqCqp. However, all of the above\naxiom-sets are functionally incomplete. The problem was solved by\nSłupecki for Ł3. He introduced the new functor\nT defined by T1 = T½ = T0 =\n½ and added the formulas CTpNTp, CNTpTp to\nWajsberg’s axioms. All Łukasiewicz’s many-valued logics are\nconsistent. Słupecki proved that Ł3 is\nPost-complete. Every Łn (n>2) is contained\nin two-valued logic, although the converse does not hold; for example,\nthe formulas CCNpNp, CCNppp, CCpqCCpNqNp,\nCCpKNqNp, CcpEqNqNq are theorems in the two-valued\nsystem only. If n =\n ℵ0, Łn is contained in every\nfinite Łn. \n\nAt first, Łukasiewicz called his three-valued logic\n“Non-Aristotelian”, but later he preferred the\nqualification “Non-Chrysippean”. According to\nŁukasiewicz, the Stagirite himself doubted the validity of the\nprinciple of excluded middle in the domain of future contingents. On\nthe other hand, the Stoics believed that every proposition is true or\nfalse, independently of its temporal reference. Thus, the Stoics\naccepted the principle of bivalence in its unrestricted form. Now, the\nfoundation of two or many-valued logic lies not in this or that logical\ntheorem, but in metalogic; in particular, it is determined by accepting\nor rejecting the principle of bivalence. Whoever, as Chrisippus did,\naccepts the validity of the principle of bivalence, opts for two-valued\nlogic; whoever even partially rejects this principle, as Aristotle did,\nthereby opens the door to many-valued logic. Łukasiewicz took the\nside of Aristotle. However, this did not close the problem of the\ninterpretation of other logical values. Łukasiewicz tried to go\nthough indeterminism and causality. A typical difficulty is the\nfollowing. Take p as valued by ½. Its negation also has\nthe value ½. The same holds for KpNp, contrary to the\nfirm intuition that any pair of contradictory sentences is false.\nDifficulties with interpretation changed Łukasiewicz’s primary\nview concerning the relation of many-valued logic to reality. At first,\nguided by a realistic epistemology of logic, he maintained that one of\nthe rival logics could be proved to be the correct description of the\nphysical world. Later, he was rather inclined to look at logical\nsystems as formalisms having their own problems deserving research and\nas useful devices for solving various questions but not as something\nleading to the only “true” ontological scheme. Yet he\nbelieved that many-valued logic would play a considerable role in the\nfoundations of mathematics. \n\nLeśniewski intended to a formulate the full logical system that\nwould serve as the basis for the whole of science, and in particular\nfor mathematics. This system consists of three parts (a) protothetic (a\ngeneralized propositional calculus); (b) ontology (a logic of terms);\n(c) mereology (a theory of parts and wholes). Protothetic is a calculus\nin which quantifiers bind propositional variables and variables referr\nto arbitrary functors constructible over the usual functors: that is,\nfunctors of propositional variables, functors of functors, etc. In\ngeneral, if we start with the category of sentences alone,\nprotothetical quantifiers bind variables of all further definable\ncategories. The shortest axiom of protothetic (written in the\nRussell-like symbolism) is the formula \n\n(Sobociński). Protothetic is an absolute propositional calculus\nin the sense that the principle of bivalence is its theorem. In fact,\nprotothetic inspired Łukasiewicz’s system with variable functors,\nanother absolute propositional logic. \n\nIf we add the functor ε (read as “is”) forming\nsentences from two names, we obtain Leśniewski’s ontology (LO).\nThe meaning of the constant ε is perhaps the most important\nmatter for a proper understanding of LO. The epsilon corresponds well\nto the sense of the copula “est” in Latin\nsentences of the type “Socrates est homo”. The\nepsilon has no spatio-temporal connotations and does not indicate the\nmembership relation or identity. The rendering of the epsilon by the\nEnglish “is” may be misleading, because the latter is\nmodified by articles. The axiomatic characterization of the meaning of\nthe epsilon is given by \n\nIts simplified form (discovered by Sobociński) is: \n\nThe right sides of (O) and (O′) are conjunctions. The\nintuitive content of (O) is simple in spite of its formal complexity.\nIt establishes that the sentence “A is a”\nis equivalent to the following conditions (a) A is not an\nempty term; (b) there is only one A; (c) whatever is\nA, is also a. Thus, “A is\na” is a singular sentence which is true if and only if\n(a)-(c) hold. In particular, such a sentence is false if A is\na general or an empty term. On the other hand, (O) (or O′) is\nvalid for all terms, even general or empty ones. Thus, LO is valid in\nall domains, including the empty one and can be regarded as the first\nsystem of free logic. In LO we can define two important concepts,\nnamely that of existence and that of being an object. This is done by\n(I use non-symbolic forms): (1) for any A, A exists =\nfor some x, x is A; (2) for any A,\nA is an object = for some x, A is\nx. LO performs functions usually provided by predicate logic.\nThe meaning of the constant ε is sufficiently general to define\nidentity and the inclusion of classes. Since these concepts are\ndefinable in elementary ontology, it is stronger than first-order\nlogic. \n\nMereology, assumes protothetic and ontology as logically prior\ntheories, and has the term “part of” as its sole primitive\nconcept. Being a part is a non-reflexive and transitive relation. There\nare no empty classes. Moreover, the class consisting of a single\nelement is identical with it. In general, mereology is a theory of sets\nin the collective (mereological) sense, contrary to ordinary set\ntheory, which describes sets in the distributive sense. The main\ndifference between the two interpretations of the term\n“set” consists in the fact that the membership relation is\ntransitive under the mereological reading, but non-transitive under the\ndistributive one. Leśniewski believed that his theory classes\nwould perform all the tasks of ordinary set theory without generating\nparadoxes. In fact, he invented mereology when he tried to solved the\nRussell paradox. Since there are no mereological classes which are not\ntheir own elements, the question which led to the Russell paradox\nsimply makes no sense in Leśniewski’s systems. On the other hand,\nmereology is weaker than set theory. \n\nLeśniewski’s systems have some formal features, even very\npeculiar ones in some respects. All are axiomatic. According to his\nnominalistic preferences, they are concrete physical objects.\nExpressions are always understood as sequences of concrete\ninscriptions. There are as many expressions as have been written; no\nexpression exists merely potentially. This view is called constructive\nnominalism. According to it, two intuitively equivalent systems, for\nexample, protothetic based on equivalence and protothetic based on\nimplication, are different systems. Every logical system, on\nLeśniewski’s view, is not finished at any time because there is\nalways the possibility of adding new elements to it. Hence, the rules\nfor constructing and developing formal systems are of crucial\nimportance for Leśniewski’s logics. He understood this very well\nand devoted much attention to explaining the details of his\nformalization. Leśniewski formulated his procedural directives\npurely syntactically and completely. Due to the role of equivalence, he\nwas able to treat definitions as theorems. In general,\nLeśniewski’s systems are commonly considered to be perfect from\nthe point of view of the requirements of correct formalization. The\nLeśniewski project is a version of logicism. Leśniewski’s\nthree systems form a grand logic and provide a universal language to\ncapture the whole of knowledge. It is certainly not an orthodox system\nand lies on the margin of contemporary research in logic. Yet it\ncontinues to attract many logicians and philosophers. In spite of their\nmarginality, Leśniewski’s systems are investigated in all parts of\nthe world. \n\nLeśniewski suggested the theory of syntactic categories, later\ndeveloped by Ajdukiewicz in the early 1930s. This theory takes the\ncategories of sentences and names (for Ajdukiewicz, following\nLeśniewski, there is no syntactic difference between proper names\nand common nouns) as fundamental and assigns the pointer s to\nsentences and n to names. Now functors have fractions as\npointers. For example, “is” has s/nn as its\ncategorial index; it says that “is” is a two-placed functor\nof two nominal arguments which forms a sentence. The conjunction as a\npropositional connective forming sentences from two other sentences has\ns/ss as its index. Consider now the expression\n“p and q”. Write the categorial indexes\nof its parts. We thus obtain the sequence: s\ns/ss s. Perform simplifications by divisions\nsimilar to dividing algebraic fractions. The letter s is the\nresult. A simple algorithm says that an expression is syntactically\ncoherent if and only if s or n is its index after\nperforming all simplifications. Ajdukiewicz’s quasi-arithmetical\nnotation was the first system of categorial grammar. \n\nDue to semantic paradoxes, Hilbert’s formalistic metamathematics and\nthe syntacticism of the Vienna Circle, the concept of truth was\nexpelled from the domain of logic. It was Tarski who changed this\nattitude. He was inspired by the Aristotelian tradition in philosophy,\nas well as the non-constructive style of working on the foundations of\nmathematics that was prevailed in Poland. In 1933, he published a book\non the concept of truth (in Polish), translated into German in 1936 and\nEnglish in 1956. \n\nTarski’s theory of truth (the semantic conception of truth) has two\naspects: philosophical and formal. Philosophically, it is a version of\nAristotle’s idea that truth consists in saying that what is, is and\nwhat is not, is not (it is related to the idea of correspondence).\nHowever, the main problem was formal. Tarski had to offer a\nconstruction free of semantic paradoxes, in particular the Liar. He\nachieved this goal by postulating that the concept of truth must be\ndefined for a definite, well-constructed formalized language\nL. However, the definition itself should be formulated\nin the metalanguage ML. The definition is to be\nformally correct, that is, it cannot lead to contradictions and has to\nsatisfy the usual conditions of correctness (non-circularity, etc.). It\nshould also be materially adequate. According to Tarski, the basic\nintuition is captured by the T-scheme: s is true if and only\nif P, where the letter s represents the name of a\nsentence and P is a translation of this sentence into the\nmetalanguage ML. Now the condition of material\nadequacy (the Convention T) says that a truth definition\nTD is materially adequate if and only if all\nequivalences (that is, for all sentences in L)\nstemming from the T-scheme by appropriate replacements are\nprovable from the definition. The conditions are satisfied by the\nfollowing definition: \n\nA more refined version is model-theoretical: \n\nThis definition implies the metalogical principles of excluded\nmiddle and contradiction, which both are equivalent to the principle of\nbivalence. \n\nTarski’s truth-definition is one of the most debated contemporary\nphilosophical and logical ideas. It strongly influenced semantics,\nphilosophy of language, philosophy of science and epistemology. In\nparticular, it became the first step toward model-theory, a central\nbranch of mathematical logic. Two applications of this definition are\nworth mentioning. Firstly, Tarski succeeded in formulating an exact\ndefinition of “logical consequence” (“following\nfrom” or “logical entailment”): \n\nSecondly, Tarski proved the following limitative theorem: \n\nŁukasiewicz revolutionized the history of logic. He proposed to\nlook at the history of logical ideas through the glasses of\nmathematical logic. The reason was that he was convinced about the\ncontinuity of formal logic from Aristotle to modern mathematical logic,\nperhaps with a break from the 16th century to Boole and\nFrege (of course, with the exception of Leibniz). Thus, old sound\nlogical theories should be considered as anticipations of ideas\nadvanced in the 19th and the 20th centuries.\nGuided by this assumption, Łukasiewicz showed that the Stoics\ninvented propositional calculus, contrary to the prevailing view that\nStoic logic was a part of Aristotle’s logic. In particular,\nŁukasiewicz demonstrated that the Stoic logic of propositions was\na system of rules, not theorems. Another of Łukasiewicz’s\nhistorical discoveries consisted in the rehabilitation of medieval\nlogic, commonly neglected as fruitless scholasticism. He was joined in\nthese investigations by Bocheński and Salamucha. \n\nHistorical work inspired logicians of the LWS toward modern\ninterpretations of traditional logical doctrines. The most famous is\nŁukasiewicz’s formalization of the Aristotelian logic of\ncategorical sentences (the syllogistic plus conversion and other rules\nof so-called direct inference). Łukasiewicz interpreted this logic\nas a specific formal theory, not as a fragment of predicate logic, as\nit was usually done (for example by Frege or Russell). Yet the logic of\ncategorical sentences assumes propositional logic as prior. The logic\nof assertoric sentences (Łukasiewicz also considered its modal\nextension) has the following form. Let the formulas (lower-case letters\nare term variables) Uab, Iab, Yab,\nOab stand for the sentences “every a is\nb”, “some a are b”,\n“no a is b” and “some a\nare not b”. We can define Yab as NIab\nand Oab as NUab. The axioms are as follows: (a)\nUaa; (b) Iaa; (c) CKUmbUamUab (the Barbara\nmodus); (d) CKUmbImaIab (the Datisi mode); the rules are: all\nthe rules of propositional calculus, substitution for term variables,\nthe definitional replacement according to the definitions of\nYab and Oab. \n\nThere was no official philosophy of logic and mathematics in the\nLWS. Most Polish logicians treated logical studies as independent of\nphilosophical commitments. Only Leśniewski had explicit\nphilosophical views which influenced the form of his systems. This does\nnot mean that concrete works were not influenced by philosophical\nideas. Łukasiewicz’s many-valued logic and Tarski’s theory of\ntruth are perhaps model cases. The former had the problem of\ndeterminism as its background and the second was strongly inspired by\nthe Aristotelian tradition in thinking about truth. It was also the\ncase that Polish logicians had inclinations to empiricism as a general\nepistemological attitude and this philosophy often resulted in\nsympathies to nominalism (Tarski), constructivism (Mostowski) and\nscepticism concerning the sharp distinction between logical and\nextralogical truth (Tarski). However, the technical side of logical\nproblems decided about investigations and sometimes forced changes in\nphilosophical standpoints. The example of Łukasiewicz is\ninstructive once again. Although he at first thought of logic as a true\nor false description of reality, he later adopted a more\nconventionalist and instrumentalistic standpoint. This attitude allowed\nhim to accommodate various ideas coming from rival foundational\ndirections, that is, logicism, formalism and intuitionism. In fact,\nLeśniewski and Tarski contributed to the theory of logical types\nand combined it with the theory of syntactic categories; Tarski’s\nversion in his work on truth is particularly important. Tarski also\nshowed new perspectives for logicism by defining logical concepts as\ninvariants under one-to-one transformations. He also contributed to\ngeneral metamathematics (the theory of consequence operation) and\nintuitionistic logic. However, a very special feature of logical\ninvestigations performed in the LWS consisted in the free admission of\nall fruitful mathematical methods, including non-constructive ones.\nThis was the main point of the set theoretical approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics which replaced logicism. \n\nThe above survey does not do justice to many of the logical studies\ncarried out in the LWS. Let me only mention some of them: particular\nhistorical studies of Bocheński and Salamucha, several\ninterpretations of traditional logic (Ajdukiewicz, Czeżowski),\npartial propositional calculi (all Warsaw logicians), propositional\ncalculus with variable functors (Łukasiewicz), paraconsistency\n(Jaśkowski), Ł-modal systems (Łukasiewicz), rejection\nrules, natural deduction (Jaśkowski), intuitionistic logic\n(Jaśkowski, Tarski, Wajsberg), free logic (Jaśkowski,\nMostowski), the elimination of quantifiers (Tarski, Presburger),\nundecidability (Tarski, Mostowski), the foundations of geometry\n(Tarski), the elementary theory of real numbers, the calculus of\nsystems (Tarski), the Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy, generalized\nquantifiers (Mostowski), as well as several particular results: the\ndeduction theorem (Tarski), the upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem\n(Tarski), the separation theorem for intuitionistic logic (Wajsberg) or\nthe Lindenbaum maximalization lemma. \n\nThe philosophy of science was a favourite field of the LWS. Since\nscience is the most rational human activity, it was important to\nexplain its rationality and unity. Since most philosophers of the LWS\nrejected naturalism in the humanities and social sciences, the way\nthrough the unity of language (as in the case of the Vienna Circle) was\nexcluded. The answer was simple: science qua science is rational and is\nunified by its logical structure and by definite logical tools used in\nscientific justifications. Thus, the analysis of the inferential\nmachinery of science is the most fundamental task of philosophers\nscience. Inductivism was a prevailing view about justification in\nempirical science. Hosiasson formulated an axiomatic system of\ninductive logic, anticipating Carnap’s later work. Other attempts to\nestablish the foundations of inductive inference were undertaken by\nAjdukiewicz (via statistics, decision theory and game theory (he mainly\ninvestigated the problem of the rationality of modes of fallible\ninference), Czeżowski (via probability logic in the sense of\nReichenbach) and Zawirski (via a combination of many-valued logic and\nprobability theory). \n\nŁukasiewicz worked on problems of the methodology of the\nempirical sciences in 1902–1910. At first, he tried to develop the\ninverse theory of induction (induction as inversed deduction) proposed\nby Jevons and Sigwart. However, he abandoned this project very soon and\nadopted a radical deductionist standpoint. For him, induction plays no\nsignificant role in science. Deduction remains the only credible mode\nof reasoning in all spheres of science. As applied in empirical\nscience, it leads to negative results; that is, it can show that some\nhypotheses are false in the face of empirical data. Łukasiewicz\nalso offered a formal argument against induction derived from\nprobability theory. Assume that H is a universal hypothesis.\nIts a priori probability is equal (or close) to zero and no further\nempirical data can increase it. These ideas contain the main points of\nPopper’s philosophy of empirical science. \n\nTarski’s semantic ideas converted most members of the LWS to\nscientific realism. Formerly, under the influence of conventionalism,\ninstrumentalism concerning scientific theories had adherents\n(Ajdukiewicz, Łukasiewicz). A radical form of anti-realism was\ndeveloped by Poznański and Wundheiler in the 1930s. They pointed\nout that verification in empirical science is cyclic and principally\nanti-fundamentalistic. In particular, it is not possible to identify\nany data without a reference to theories. Hence, truth in science\ncannot consist in a correspondence with facts. \n\nOf many investigations concerning special problems, let me only\nmention Mehlberg’s version of the causal theory of time and some works\non the causality problem in quantum mechanics. He admitted a universal\ntime as a synthesis of physical (intersubjective) and psychical\n(subjective) time. The causal theory does not lead to the anisotropy of\ntime. It can be that universal time is symmetric, but locally asymmetry\nis possible. Mehlberg and Zawirski defended a moderate causalism in\nquantum mechanics. In particular, Zawirski argued that the\nunpredictability of the future (Heisenberg) does not entail that the\nprinciple of causality fails. \n\nKotarbiński developed a general doctrine, called reism. It has\ntwo aspects, ontological and semantic. Hence, we can speak about\nsemantic reism and ontological reism, although this distinction was\nclarified by Kotarbiński later. In general, reism goes against the\nacceptance of the existence of general (abstract) objects, that is,\nfacts, properties, states of affairs, relations, etc. The main\nontological thesis of reism is as follows (it is subdivided into two\nsubtheses): (R1) any object is a material, spatio-temporal, concrete\nthing; (R2) no object is a state of affairs, property of relation\n(according to Kotarbiński, these three categories exhaust the\ndomain of alleged abstract objects). Now (R1), that is, the positive\nthesis of reism has a rich content. Firstly, it marks a formal feature\nof existing objects, namely their concrete character. \n\nSecondly, it characterizes things as material and spatio-temporal\nentities, that is, as physical objects. Leibniz conceived monads as\nspiritual concreta. For the later Brentano, every object is concrete,\nbut there are souls and bodies. Thus, Leibniz’s reism was monistic and\nspiritualistic, Brentano’s was dualistic, and Kotarbiński’s\nmonistic and materialistic. Although the terminology varies (one can\nequivalently speak about reism, concretism or nominalism), two claims\nof any theory going against general (abstract) objects should be very\nsharply distinguished. The first is formal-ontological and points out\nthe formal feature of existents, namely that they are individuals; but\nthe second is material-ontological or metaphysical and focuses on their\nnature as physical or psychical entities. \n\nSemantic reism is parallel to the ontological aspect of this\ndoctrine. The key idea consists in the distinction of genuine names and\napparent names (onomatoids). A name is genuine if and only if refers to\nthings, that is, to concrete physical things. By contrast, onomatoids\nare words that allegedly refer to abstract entities,\n“allegedly” because their referents do not exist. At first\nglance, apparent names are similar to empty terms. However, this\nresemblance is merely apparent, because empty nouns are genuine names\nand can always be decomposed into non-empty genuine names (e.g., “round\nsquare”). This becomes evident when we try to formulate the conditions\nof meaningfulness for sentences. In general, a sentence is meaningful\nif and only if it consists (except for logical constants) only of\ngenuine names or is reducible to such sentences. For example, the\nsentence “all cats are animals” is reistically meaningful,\nbut “properties are abstract objects” is not. Furthermore,\n“a square triangle is rectangular” is good, but “sets\nexist outside of time and space” is not. The sentence\n“whiteness is a property of snow” can be reduced to\n“snow is white”. This example shows how to translate some\nsentences with apparent names into purely reistic statements. \n\nMatters become clearer if one remembers that Leśniewski’s\ncalculus of names is the underlying logic of reism. The copula\n“is” in “snow is white” functions with its\nmeaning defined by the axiom of LO (see above). Thus, this sentence is\ntrue if its subject refers to an individual object. The traditional\ninterpretation of common nouns and adjectives, consistent with LO, as\ngeneral terms referring to many objects, saves their reistic character.\nThus, one can say that the formal-ontological aspect of reism is\nadequately displayed by LO. Of course, reism as a metaphysical doctrine\nis an addition to LO. \n\nKotarbiński recommended reism as a sound view. In particular,\nit defends philosophy and ordinary thinking before hypostases, that is,\naccepting the existence of abstract objects on the basis of using\napparent names. Thus, reism defends us against idola fori in\nBacon’s sense. Kotarbiński’s reism is perhaps the most radical\nmaterialistic nominalism in the history of philosophy. Reism is\nexceptional to the main tendency in the LWS in that it proposes a\nuniform language, proper everywhere, including the humanities,\nsociology and psychology (Kotarbiński supplemented reism by\nradical realism, that is, the view that there are no mental contents).\nIn this respect, reism resembles physicalism. The troubles of reism are\ntypical those which are in the case of any reductive materialism and\nnominalism, and concern the interpretation of mathematics, semantics,\npsychology, the humanities and social sciences. \n\nRadical conventionalism is an epistemological theory developed by\nAjdukiewicz in the early 1930s. It is based on a conception of language\nand meaning. The concept of meaning is taken as a primitive. Now, the\nmeaning of expressions in a language L induces the\nrules for accepting its sentences. Ajdukiewicz lists three kinds of\nmeaning-rules (or sense-rules): (a) axiomatic (they demand the\nunconditional acceptance of sentences, for example, “A\nis A”; (b) deductive (they demand the acceptance of a\nsentence relatively to the prior acceptance of other sentences, for\nexample, ¬A follows from A → B and\n¬B), (c) empirical (they demand the acceptance of a\nsentence in a definite empirical situation, for example “it is\nraining” when it rains). \n\nThe special significance of meaning-rules and their relation to the\nmeanings of expressions appears when special languages are taken into\naccount, namely closed and connected. A language L is\nopen if it can be extended to a new language L′\nwithout changes in the meanings of other expressions; otherwise\nL is closed. A language is disconnected if there is a\nnon-empty subset X of L such that no\nelement of X is linked by the meaning-rules to other\nelements of L; otherwise, L is\nconnected. It follows from the above definitions that if\nL is closed and connected, it cannot be enriched\nwithout changing the meanings of the original expressions. \n\nAccording to Ajdukiewicz, natural languages are open and\ndisconnected. By contrast, scientific languages are closed and\ndisconnected. Let L be closed and connected. The set\nof meanings of L is its conceptual apparatus. If\nA and A′ are two conceptual\napparatuses, they are either identical or mutually non-translatable.\nSince the acceptance and rejection of sentences is always related to a\nlanguage L, empirical data do no force us to accept or\nreject any sentences, because there always remains the possibility of\nchanging a given conceptual apparatus. This is a considerable\nradicalization of the conventionalism of Poincaré. The\ndifference is the following. For Poincaré, since theoretical\nprinciples are conventions, we are free to modify them, but\nexperiential reports are perfectly stable. Ajdukiewicz extended\nconventionalism to all sentences, because any sentence, no matter\nwhether experiential or theoretical, depends on a conceptual apparatus.\nIt is why Ajdukiewicz called this conventionalism radical. \n\nIn the middle of the 1930s Ajdukiewicz changed his view. He came to\nthe conclusion that closed and connected languages are fictions. He was\ninfluenced by the semantic ideas of Tarski. Tarski also argued that,\ncontrary to Ajdukiewicz’s hopes, the invariance of meaning-rules over\npermutations of expressions influences their meaning-relations.\nGradually, Ajdukiewicz developed the program of semantic epistemology,\nmainly directed toward the defence of realism against various forms of\nidealism. In particular, he criticized Rickert’s transcendental\nidealism and Berkeley’s subjectivism. For Rickert, reality is only a\ncorrelate of the Transcendental Subject. Now the Transcendental Subject\ncan be identified with the set T of true propositions\nobtainable on the basis of axiomatic and deductive rules. However, due\nto incompleteness phenomena, T cannot be generated in\nthis way. For Ajdukiewicz, that was a justification that transcendental\nidealism fails. Ajdukiewicz compared the language used by Berkeley to\nthe language of syntax, because the former reduces relations of the\nmind to its objects to relations between thoughts. On the other hand,\nthe ordinary way of speaking about objects employs semantic relations.\nBerkeley’s claim esse = percipi is similar to an\nattempt to define semantics in a purely syntactic language. However,\ndue to Tarski’s results about the relation between syntax and\nsemantics, this is impossible. Finally, Ajdukiewicz argued that any\nidealistic language is understandable only if it is associated with a\nrealistic language. Hence, any attempt to consider idealistic language\nas self-sufficient cannot be successful. \n\nThe LWS acted in a country which never belonged to the philosophical\nsuperpowers. This circumstance is important for any assessment of the\nsignificance of the LWS. One can measure it on a national or an\ninternational scale. The importance of the LWS for Polish philosophical\nculture was enormous. Twardowski fully realized his task. He introduced\nscientific philosophy in his sense into Poland and created a powerful\nphilosophical school. It did very much for the subsequent development\nof philosophy in the country. In particular, it popularized very high\nstandards of doing philosophy. This was important in the difficult\ntimes after 1945, when Marxism started an ideological and political\noffensive against bourgeois philosophy. In fact, due to the strong\nmethodological tradition related to the LWS, Polish philosophy did not\nlose its academic quality in 1945–1989. \n\nAs far as the matter concerns international importance, one thing is\nclear. The logical achievements of the LWS became the most famous.\nDoubtless, the Warsaw school of logic contributed very much to the\ndevelopment of logic in the 20th century. Other\ncontributions are known but rather marginally. This is partially due to\nthe fact that most philosophical writings of the LWS appeared in\nPolish. However, this factor does not explain everything. Many writings\nof the LWS were originally published in English, French or German.\nHowever, their influence was very moderate, considerably lesser than\nthat of similar writings of philosophers from the leading countries.\nThis is a pity, because radical conventionalism, reism or semantic\nepistemology are the real philosophical pearls. But perhaps this is the\nfate of results achieved in cultural provinces.","contact.mail":"wolenski@if.uj.edu.pl","contact.domain":"if.uj.edu.pl"}]
