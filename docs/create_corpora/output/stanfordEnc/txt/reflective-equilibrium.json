In this everyday practice, we have sought\n“reflective equilibrium” among these various beliefs as a\nway of clarifying for ourselves just what we ought to do. In addition,\nwe may also have been persuading ourselves that our conclusions were\njustifiable and ultimately acceptable to us by seeking coherence among\nthem. Even though it is part of our everyday practice, is this\napproach to deliberating about what is right and finding justification\nfor our views defensible?\n\n\nViewed most generally, a “reflective equilibrium” is the\nend-point of a deliberative process in which we reflect on and revise\nour beliefs about an area of inquiry, moral or non-moral. The inquiry\nmight be as specific as the moral question, “What is the right\nthing to do in this case?” or the logical question, “Is\nthis the correct inference to make?” Alternatively, the inquiry\nmight be much more general, asking which theory or account of justice\nor right action we should accept, or which principles of inductive\nreasoning we should use. We can also refer to the process or method\nitself as the “method of reflective equilibrium.”\n\n\nThe method of reflective equilibrium can be carried out by individuals\nacting separately or together. In the latter case, the method is\ndialogical and agreement among participants may or may not be\naccompanied by a search for coherence. We shall be focused on the\nmethod when it seeks coherence among beliefs, for an avowal of\nagreement may well not include a real coherence of beliefs.\n\n\nIn what follows, we first give an overview of the method of reflective\nequilibrium and comment briefly on its history. We then discuss in\nmore detail the evolution of the method and its role in the work of\nJohn Rawls. Against that background, we then remark on some of the\ncontroversy surrounding the claim that coherence among our moral or\nour logical beliefs in reflective equilibrium counts as a\njustification for them, including the challenge to including moral\nintuitions or facts about the world in such a justification. Finally,\nwe discuss some implications the method has for work in ethics.\n\nThe method of reflective equilibrium consists in working back and\nforth among our considered judgments (some say our\n“intuitions,” though Rawls (1971), the namer of the\nmethod, avoided the term “intuitions” in this context)\nabout particular instances or cases, the principles or rules that we\nbelieve govern them, and the theoretical considerations that we\nbelieve bear on accepting these considered judgments, principles, or\nrules, revising any of these elements wherever necessary in order to\nachieve an acceptable coherence among them. The method succeeds and we\nachieve reflective equilibrium when we arrive at an acceptable\ncoherence among these beliefs. An acceptable coherence requires that\nour beliefs not only be consistent with each other (a weak\nrequirement), but that some of these beliefs provide support or\nprovide a best explanation for others. Moreover, in the process we may\nnot only modify prior beliefs but add new beliefs as well. There need\nbe no assurance the reflective equilibrium is stable—we may\nmodify it as new elements arise in our thinking (Schroeter 2004). In\npractical contexts, this deliberation may help us come to a conclusion\nabout what we ought to do when we had not at all been sure earlier.\n(Scanlon 2002). We arrive at an optimal equilibrium when the component\njudgments, principles, and theories are ones we are un-inclined to\nrevise any further because together they have the highest degree of\nacceptability or credibility for us. An alternative account retains\nthe importance of revisability and emphasizes the positive role of\nexamining our moral intuitions, but rejects the appeal to coherentism\nin favor a treating our intuitive moral judgments as the right sort to\ncount as foundational, even if they are still defeasible (McMahan\n2000, Nichols 2012).  \nThe method of reflective equilibrium has been advocated as a coherence\naccount of justification (as contrasted with an account of truth) in\nseveral areas of inquiry, including inductive and deductive logic as\nwell as both theoretical and applied philosophy. The key idea\nunderlying this view of justification is that we “test”\nvarious parts of our system of beliefs against the other beliefs we\nhold, looking for ways in which some of these beliefs support others,\nseeking coherence among the widest set of beliefs, and revising and\nrefining them at all levels when challenges to some arise from others.\nFor example, a moral principle or moral judgment about a particular\ncase (or, alternatively, a rule of inductive or deductive inference or\na particular inference) would be justified if it cohered with the rest\nof our beliefs about right action (or correct inferences) on due\nreflection and after appropriate revisions throughout our system of\nbeliefs. By extension of this account, a person who holds a principle\nor judgment in reflective equilibrium with other relevant beliefs can\nbe said to be justified in believing that principle or judgment. \nBecause we are expected to revise our beliefs at all levels as we work\nback and forth among them and subject them to various criticisms, this\ncoherence view contrasts sharply with a variety of many\nfoundationalist approaches to justification. In ethics, some\nfoundationalist approaches take some subset of our moral beliefs as\nfixed or unrevisable. Other foundationalists at least claim that some\nsubset of our moral beliefs are immediately or directly justified\n(perhaps even “self-evident”) or warranted (leaving aside\nthe issue of revisability) and serve as the basis on which all other\nbeliefs are justified. Still others take some subset of our beliefs as\nat least justifiable independently of any other moral beliefs, even if\nthey are justifiable in light of either necessary or contingent views\nof the person or human nature or through appeals to the logic of moral\ndiscourse (Timmons 1987). Reflective equilibrium is unlikely to single\nout any such group of privileged or directly justified beliefs,\ndistinguishing itself from all these forms of foundationalism. Rawls\n(1974) thought it highly unlikely, but not impossible, that moral\nprinciples could be formulated so compellingly (be\n“self-evident”) that we would favor them and their\nconsequences over all our previously held considered moral judgments;\nhe thus leaves foundationalism a slim possibility, a point seized on\nby some who are willing to ignore Rawls’s probability claim that\nsuch foundationalism is not probable at all. If we take this\nprobability judgment seriously, then the warrant for a belief lies\n(with high probability) in its coherence with other beliefs and not in\nits resting on beliefs for which foundationalist claims are made.  \nBecause it is not foundationalist in these ways, reflective\nequilibrium also avoids some other problematic distinctions or claims\nthat are part of an effort to show how some beliefs can be directly\njustified or warranted. For example, some foundationalists view\nparticular moral judgments as fixed; others might think it is our\nmoral principles or some deeper theoretical beliefs from which such\nprinciples might be derived that are fixed and unrevisable. Some\nproponents of both approaches have even claimed that a moral sense or\nfaculty reveals these directly justified beliefs to us. For others, we\ncan discover the foundational beliefs in some deep moral belief\nstructure that is revealed to us through a careful examination of\nmoral judgements and that is arguably a priori. A considerable part of\ncontemporary work in substantive ethics treats appeals to moral\nintuitions or considered judgments in this way (Thompson 1976, McMahan\n2000, G.A. Cohen 2007). Some who work in this fashion cite Rawls\n(1974) when they embrace reflective equilibrium. We return to the\ntopic of intuitionism again later in this entry. \nIn contrast, advocates of reflective equilibrium need tell no\ncontroversial stories about credentials for a special subset of\nbeliefs that is directly justifiable. Where such advocates credit some\ninitial beliefs with strong initial acceptance, as Rawls (Rawls 1971)\ndoes when he refers to some beliefs as initial “fixed\npoints,” the beliefs remain revisable; in any case, they are not\ntaken to be points we believe independently of other moral and\nnon-moral beliefs we hold, and so they have no special foundations\n(Harman 2003). This revisability of the initial beliefs and their\ndependence on other beliefs when reasons for them are requested means\nthat no such special epistemological story has to be told about\nthem. \nAs we shall see, however, an important point of controversy,\nespecially in ethics, is not that reflective equilibrium allows for\nthe revision of all moral judgments but, rather, that it involves\ngiving some initial justificatory weight to them at all. \nThis approach to the justification of rules of inductive\nlogic—without the label “reflective\nequilibrium”—was proposed by Nelson Goodman in his classic\nFact, Fiction, and Forecast (Goodman 1955). Goodman's idea\nwas that we justify rules of inference in inductive or deductive logic\nby bringing them into reflective equilibrium with what we judge to be\nacceptable inferences in a broad range of particular cases. No rule of\ninference would be acceptable as a logical principle if it was not\ncompatible with what we take to be acceptable instances of inferential\nreasoning. In this sense, our beliefs about acceptable rules of\ninference are constrained by the “evidence” provided by\nwhat we believe to be good or correct examples or instances of\ninferential reasoning. At the same time, we should correct or revise\nour views about particular inferences we initially might think are\nacceptable if we come to see them as incompatible with rules that we\ngenerally accept and refuse to reject because they, in turn, best\naccount for a broad range of other acceptable inferences. \nSome have criticized this account as giving too much weight to our\nactual inductive practices (Stich 1990, Kelly and McGrath 2010).\nObviously, not all elements of the everyday reasoning practices of all\nindividuals are justifiable. For example, many of us, to our chagrin,\nhave had to confess committing the error of the gamblers fallacy in\nour own betting on games or on the events of life. Quite generally,\npsychological studies reveal widespread errors in reasoning in a broad\nrange of contexts. More recently, others have suggested that\nreflective equilibrium is problematic as a form of justification of\ninductive reasoning because it is fragile as a method, allowing some\nfeatures of our beliefs to trigger significant changes in the\nequilibrium they reach, and it provides inadequate assurance about its\nreliability, as a way of telling us what beliefs to replace with other\nbeliefs (Harman and Kulkarni 2006). \nThough Goodman thinks justification of our reasoning practices depends\non what inferences we accept when we reason inductively and\ndeductively, he is not simply seeking to systematize whatever\ninferences we happen to find people\nsometimes—unreflectively—make. Instead, he insists that\npractice can and should be corrected as we work back and forth from\ntentative principles to practice, revising where appropriate,\npresumably eliminating the sorts of inconsistencies that some\npsychological studies, and our everyday experiences, reveal. But, some\ncritics ask (Siegel 1992), if practice should be revised, why should\nwe view “fit” with practice as at all justificatory? \nA more generous reading of Goodman's proposal would widen the\nreflective equilibrium he proposes to include some of the beliefs\nabout standards for acceptable inference that logicians develop\n(though some think that wide reflective equilibrium does not overcome\nthe reliability problem noted above). Such standards are themselves\nnot independent of all inferential practice. They have been developed\nto reflect views about what counts as good practice in light of the\nkinds of inferences that people abandon when they are made aware of\ntheir inconsistency with other inferences they will not give up. It is\nagainst this wider set of beliefs, including the articulation of such\nstandards, that we can identify some inferences as performance errors\nor otherwise deviant patterns and correct those practices. Some\nchanges in belief in dialogical contexts may well be best explained by\nnoting that some individuals grasp the insights of others. Individuals\nworking with the method of reflective equilibrium may thus see the\npoint of criticisms of previous views they had accepted. This is where\nsome dialogical and individual uses of the method coincide. (We turn\nto the distinction between wide and narrow reflective equilibrium\nshortly.) \nDespite the fact that the origins of reflective equilibrium (minus the\nname) lie in mid-twentieth century discussions about the justification\nof inductive logic, its principal development through the rest of the\ncentury lies primarily in ethics and political philosophy.\nSpecifically, the method was given prominence (and the name by which\nit is known) by John Rawls's description and use of it in A Theory\nof Justice (Rawls 1971). (Rawls 1951 had much earlier articulated\na slightly different version of the view.) Although accounts of the\njustification of empirical knowledge have been developed that share\nwith reflective equilibrium its coherentist approach, they generally\ndo not make explicit use of the terminology of reflective equilibrium,\nand we shall not discuss them here. Instead, we concentrate on the use\nof reflective equilibrium in ethics and political philosophy, where it\nhas been deployed and criticized. \nRawls (Rawls 1971) argues that the goal of a theory of justice is to\nestablish the terms of fair cooperation that should govern free and\nequal moral agents. On this view, the appropriate perspective from\nwhich to choose among competing conceptions or principles of justice\nis a hypothetical social contract or choice situation in which\ncontractors are constrained in their knowledge, motivations, and tasks\nin specific ways. Because this choice situation is fair to all\nparticipants, Rawls calls the conception of justice that emerges from\nthis choice “justice as fairness.” Under these\nconstraints, he argues, rational contractors would choose principles\nguaranteeing equal basic liberties and equality of opportunity, and a\nprinciple that permitted inequalities only if they made the people who\nare worst off as well off as possible. \nInstead of simply accepting whatever principles contractors would\nchoose under these constraints on choice, however, Rawls imposed a\nfurther condition of adequacy on them. The chosen principles must also\nmatch our considered judgments about justice in reflective\nequilibrium. If they do not, then we are to revise the constraints on\nchoice in the contract situation until we arrive at a contract that\nyields principles that are in reflective equilibrium with our\nconsidered judgments about justice. This restriction constitutes a\nfurther assurance that the outcomes of the deliberation about fair\nterms of cooperation in the choice situation (the Original Position)\nactually count as focusing on justice rather than on some other\ndomain. In effect, the device of the contract must itself be in\nreflective equilibrium with the rest of our beliefs about justice. The\ncontract helps us determine what principles we should choose from\namong competing views, but the justification for using it and\ndesigning it so that it serves that purpose must itself derive from\nthe reflective equilibrium that it helps us achieve. \nThe method of reflective equilibrium thus plays a role in both the\nconstruction and justification of Rawls's theory of justice (Daniels\n1996; Scanlon 2002). Its role in construction is an example of its use\nas a form of deliberation. Critics of Rawls's theory and his method of\nreflective equilibrium, especially utilitarians, challenge the\nprominence the method gives to moral judgments or intuitions. Building\na theory—constructing it—out of such initial judgments is\nbuilding it on easily discredited bases, for are not many of our\nbeliefs just the result of historical accident and bias, even\nsuperstition? Indeed, some argue that there is no justificatory force\nto the contract itself if we “rig” the contract so that it\nyields principles that match our intuitions (Hare 1973). Despite these\nand other criticisms, defenders of the method have elaborated it and\nextended its use in broad areas of ethics. Later in this article we\nshall consider some of the criticisms of this method and some of its\nextensions in more detail. Before doing so, however, it is necessary\nto describe it more fully. \nA reflective equilibrium may be narrow or wide (Rawls 1974). All of us\nare familiar with a process in moral deliberation in which we work\nback and forth between a judgment we are inclined to make about right\naction in a particular case and the reasons or principles we offer for\nthat judgment. Often we consider variations on the particular case,\n“testing” the principle against them, and then refining\nand specifying it to accommodate our judgments about these variations.\nWe might also revise what we say about certain cases if our initial\nviews do not fit with the principles we grow inclined to accept. \nSuch a revision may constitute a moral surprise or discovery (Daniels\n1996). Suppose, for example, that we are considering whether we should\nignore age in the distribution of medical treatments. Many initially\nbelieve that age is a “morally irrelevant trait,” just\nlike race, and they would insist that rationing medical services by\nage is just as unacceptable as rationing by race. On considering a\nvariety of cases, however, it might become apparent that we all age,\nalthough we do not change race. This difference means that the\ndifferent treatment of people at different ages, if systematically\napplied over the lifespan, does not create inequalities between\npersons, as it would in the case of race. We might be led by this\nrealization to think that age rationing might be acceptable under some\nconditions when race rationing would never be, and this would be a\nmoral surprise for many who changed their view. \nTo the extent that we focus solely on particular cases and a group of\nprinciples that apply to them, and to the extent that we are not\nsubjecting the views we encounter to extensive criticism from\nalternative moral perspectives, we are seeking only narrow\nreflective equilibrium. Presumably, the principles we arrive at in\nnarrow equilibrium best “account for” the cases examined.\nOthers, however, may arrive at different narrow reflective equilibria,\ncontaining different principles and judgments about justice. Indeed,\none such narrow equilibrium might be characterized as typically\nutilitarian, while another is, we may suppose, Kantian or perhaps\nLibertarian. As a result, we still face an important question about\njustification unanswered by the method of narrow reflective\nequilibrium: which set of beliefs about justice should we accept? \nBecause narrow reflective equilibrium does not answer this question,\nit may seem to be a descriptive method appropriate to moral\nanthropology, not a normative account of justification in\nethics. In fact, Rawls (Rawls 1971) at one point suggested that\narriving at the principles that match our moral judgments in\nreflective equilibrium might reveal our “moral grammar” in\na way that is analogous to uncovering the grammar that underlies our\nsyntactic ability as native speakers of a language to make judgments\nabout grammatical form. In support of the analogy, some contemporary\ntheorists who systematically examine our moral intuitions, often\nthrough hypothetical as opposed to real cases, believe they are\nuncovering an underlying moral structure of principles (see Kamm\n1993), perhaps one that is a priori. \nUncovering a syntax, however, is a descriptive and not a justificatory\ntask. Once we can identify the grammar or rules that best account for\na person's syntactic competency, we do not ask the question, Should\nthat person have this grammar? We are satisfied to have captured the\ngrammar underlying a person's idiolect. In ethics and political\nphilosophy, in contrast, we must answer that justificatory question,\nespecially since there is often disagreement among people about what\nis right, disagreement that is not resolved simply by pursuing narrow\nreflective equilibrium. \nIn A Theory of Justice (1971, revised edition 1999), Rawls\ndoes not use the terminology of narrow and wide reflective\nequilibrium, an omission he remarks about with regret in Justice\nas Fairness: A Restatement (2001, p. 31). Still, he comments that\nseeking a reflective equilibrium that merely irons out minor\nincoherence in a person's system of beliefs is not really the use of\nthe method that is of true philosophical interest in ethics, just as\nwe saw it might not be in the case of justifying logical inferences.\nRather, he says, to be of interest to moral philosophy, a reflective\nequilibrium should seek what results from challenging existing beliefs\nby arguments and implications that derive from the panoply of\ndeveloped positions in moral and political philosophy (Rawls A Theory\nof Justice 2nd Edition, 1999, p. 43). Such a reflective equilibrium\nwould be the response to considerable critical pressures on the\noriginal beliefs. This effort would have the character of searching\ndeliberation about what is right. It is this much broader form of\nchallenge that Rawls labels the method of wide reflective\nequilibrium. \nRawls's proposal is that we can determine what principles of justice\nwe ought to adopt, on full reflection, and be persuaded that our\nchoices are justifiable to ourselves and others, only if we broaden\nthe circle of beliefs that must cohere. Indeed, we should be willing\nto test our beliefs against developed moral theories of various types,\nobviously not all such views (as Arras 2007, Strong (2010) comment,\nKelly and McGrath 2010), or we would never arrive at a conclusion, but\nat least against some leading alternatives. (We often do so in\ndiscussion or deliberation with others. How conclusive an argument or\ndeliberation is may depend on what alternative views are considered or\non who is included in the deliberation.) In effect, Rawls's (Rawls\n1971) pair-wise comparison of justice as fairness with utilitarianism\nis just such an exercise at seeking wide reflective equilibrium. In a\nwide reflective equilibrium, for example, we broaden the\nfield of relevant moral and non-moral beliefs (including general\nsocial theory) to include an account of the conditions under which it\nwould be fair for reasonable people to choose among competing\nprinciples, as well as evidence that the resulting principles\nconstitute a feasible or stable conception of justice, that is, that\npeople could sustain their commitment to such principles. Rawls's\nargument is that justice as fairness, rather than utilitarianism, is\nwhat emerges in wide reflective equilibrium. \nFor example, the constraints on choice in Rawls's contract situation,\nsuch as the veil of ignorance that keeps us from knowing facts about\nourselves and our specific preferences, require justification. Rawls\nneeds to show that these constraints are “fair” to all\ncontractors (thus “justice as fairness” is his label for\nthis procedural account of how we find out what is just.) To provide\nsuch justification, Rawls appeals to beliefs about the fundamental\n“moral powers” of “free and equal” agents\n(they can form and revise their conceptions of what is good and they\nhave a sense of justice). He also appeals to the ideal of a\nwell-ordered society in which principles of justice play a particular\nrole as public principles for reconciling disputes. Rawls must even\nprovide us with an account of “primary social goods,”\nnecessary if agents who do not know their own actual preferences are\nto decide what principles would be better for them to choose. \nThe device of the contract is thus in reflective equilibrium with\ncertain background theories that themselves contain moral beliefs.\nThese are theories, or crucial beliefs, about the nature of persons,\nthe role of morality or justice in society, and beliefs about\nprocedural justice. The contract is not simply based on\nuncontroversial assumptions about human rationality, although it\ndescribes a rational choice problem within the constraints it imposes;\nnor is it based on formal considerations about practical reasoning or\nthe logic or semantics of moral discourse. If Rawls were trying to\njustify the structure of the contract by appeal to theories that\nthemselves were completely non-moral, then he would be offering the\nkind of independent justification for the principles that would\ncharacterize them as foundational (Daniels 1996, Timmons 1987), so the\nclaim that the background theories are themselves moral is part of the\nrationale for concluding that Rawls is clearly rejecting\nfoundationalism. (Some philosophers, as noted earlier, argue that\nreflective equilibrium is compatible with foundationalism, citing\nRawls in this regard though they ignore his probability judgment that\nsuch a compatibility exists in principle and is highly unlikely to be\nmet.) Without acceptance of that wider circle of moral beliefs,\nRawls's construction lacks support, and if that construction were\nmodified, some of his arguments against utilitarianism would be\nweakened. \nOur beliefs about justice are justified (and, by extension, we are\njustified in holding them) if they cohere in such a wide reflective\nequilibrium. Obviously, the method of wide reflective equilibrium is\nhere only illustrated by appeal to the detail of Rawls's use of it. If\nwe abstract from that detail, we see that there is a complex structure\nand interaction of beliefs, at many levels of generality, that bear on\nthe construction of an account of justice. We shall later return to\nthis point when we talk about some of the criticisms of method and\nabout implications of this method for work in ethics. \nIn A Theory of Justice, Rawls seemed to think that all people\nmight converge (but see Kelly and McGrath 2010) on a common or\nshared wide reflective equilibrium that included\n“justice as fairness,” the conception of justice for which\nhe argues. Wide reflective equilibrium thus played a role in the\nconstruction of the theory, helping “us”—any and all\nof us—to articulate its key features in ways that led to\nprinciples that matched “our” considered judgments. At the\nsame time, wide reflective equilibrium constituted an account of\njustification. Shared agreement on that wide equilibrium would produce\na well-ordered society governed by principles guaranteeing equal basic\nliberties, fair equality of opportunity, and the requirement that\ninequalities be arranged to make those who are worst off as well off\nas possible. \nIn his later work, Political Liberalism (Rawls 1993), Rawls\nabandons the suggestion that all people might converge in the same,\nshared wide reflective equilibrium that contains his conception of\njustice. This important change comes about because of what Rawls calls\n“the burdens of judgment.” Complexity, uncertainty, and\nvariation in experience lead human reason, when exercised under\nconditions of freedom, of the sort protected by the principles of\njustice as fairness, to an unavoidable pluralism of comprehensive\nmoral and philosophical views. (The need to find agreement in the form\nof an overlapping consensus of views arises domestically under\nconditions of liberty and the burdens of judgment and is evidenced\nfurther by the different perspectives that we might get from a global\nview of issues.) This unavoidable fact of reasonable pluralism makes\none key feature of justice as fairness untenable, namely the account\nRawls gave of the stability of his preferred conception of justice. A\nfurther feature of Rawls's late work is his clear eschewal of any\naccount of truth, so the fact that wide equilibrium is offered as an\naccount of justification, not truth, makes it compatible with the\nrefusal to discuss moral truth (see Little 1984). \nRawls had imposed three basic conditions on the principles of justice.\nFirst, they must be chosen over alternatives under conditions fair to\nall contractors. Second, what contractors choose must match\n“our” considered moral judgments and other beliefs in\n(wide) reflective equilibrium. But third, the principles must comprise\na feasible or stable conception of justice. The test for stability is\nto ask if people raised under this view would conform to it over time\nwith less strain of commitment than other conceptions would face. In\neffect, passing the test shows it is worth adopting this view because\nit will not prove so fragile that it is not worth the effort to\ninstitutionalize. \nThe problem facing Rawls because of reasonable pluralism is that his\nearlier efforts to show justice as fairness was stable depended on\nspecial views about the importance of autonomy that would be held only\nby some people and could not be assumed to be shared. His argument for\nstability had turned on appealing to the good of autonomy in ways that\nmight not be acceptable to people holding certain comprehensive views.\nStability was not demonstrated. \nTo address this problem, Rawls recasts justice as fairness as a\n“freestanding” political conception of justice on which\npeople with different comprehensive views may agree in an\n“overlapping consensus.” The public justification\nof such a political conception involves no appeal to the philosophical\nor religious views that appear in the comprehensive doctrines that\nform this overlapping consensus. Instead, we might think of this\nprocess of working back and forth among the key shared ideas in the\npublic, democratic culture and the articulated features of the\npolitical conception of justice as a political reflective equilibrium\n(Daniels 1996). (We can imagine the process being carried out by\nindividuals, for example, as citizens thinking about an issue of basic\njustice or judges about a matter of constitutional essentials, or as a\ncollective process, in public deliberation. As noted in Table 1 below,\npeople with different comprehensive world views may draw the boundary\nbetween public and private slightly differently and not all questions\nabout basic justice will be settled in a way that rules out ongoing\ndisagreement. Thus disagreements about some aspects of reproductive\nrights or the separation of church and state may remain contested\nfeatures within public reason.) The goal of this exercise of what\nRawls calls “public reason” is the articulation of such a\npolitical reflective equilibrium. \nStill, there is no convergence on a shared wide reflective equilibrium\nthat contains the political conception of justice. The political\nreflective equilibrium is not a shared wide reflective\nequilibrium, for it avoids appealing to the broad range of beliefs\nthat would be included in many wide reflective equilibria.\nNevertheless, wide reflective equilibrium still plays a critical role\nin justification even when justice is political in this way. \nFor individuals to be fully justified in adopting the\npolitical conception of justice, the conception articulated in the\npolitical reflective equilibrium, they must incorporate it within a\nwide reflective equilibrium that includes their own comprehensive\nmoral or religious doctrine. It will count as a reasonable view for\nthem only if the public conception of justice coheres with their other\n(religious and philosophical) beliefs in wide reflective equilibrium.\n(Individuals within a religion may find a religious basis for\naccommodating their religion to concerns of public reason, though this\noutcome is unusual unless the religious hierarchy in their religion\nhas found such accommodation as well.) Individuals, whatever groups\nand associations they belong to, must be able to embark on the\ndeliberative process called wide reflective equilibrium that leads\nthem to endorse, from their own perspective, the content of the\npolitical reflective equilibrium, including its injunctions about\nusing only public reason in thinking about certain basic features of\njustice or the constitution. \nWe can imagine use of wide reflective equilibrium if we modify\nslightly Rawls image of an overlapping consensus in which a shared\npolitical conception is a point of convergence among otherwise\ndifferent comprehensive world views. Convert each reasonable\ncomprehensive world view—for example, a Kantian, Millian, or a\nProtestant religious view that endorses a notion of free\nfaith—into a wide reflective equilibrium that is reached by all\nwho hold that view. These distinct wide equilibria now share a module,\nthe political reflective equilibrium, though each wide equilibrium\nwill justify the features of that module in light of beliefs that may\nnot be acceptable in other wide equilibria. \nTo help see what has happened to the content of the wide reflective\nequilibrium when we shift from the picture in A Theory of\nJustice to that in Political Liberalism, consider \nTable 1 below. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe first row of the table indicates the content of justice as\nfairness, including the background views that support the construction\nof the original position. This “module” is contained in\nboth versions of a wide reflective equilibrium that justifies justice\nas fairness. In Theory, as the second row indicates, shared\nphilosophical arguments justify key elements of the module, but in\nLiberalism, the rationale for each of these elements must\nderive from the distinctive features of the different comprehensive\nviews. Thus, as Cohen suggests (1994, p. 1527), a Kantian, a Millian,\nand a religious person who believed in free faith might all support,\nbut for quite different reasons, the idea that agents were free in the\nsense of being capable of forming and revising their conceptions of\nthe good life.  \nAs the third and fourth rows suggest, full justification of a\npolitical conception of justice requires acceptance of an account of\nthe burdens of judgment that explain why pluralism is a fact of life.\nA comprehensive view capable of reaching accommodation with that\npluralism and with the political reflective equilibrium it shares with\nother reasonable views must also develop a rationale for the specific\nway in which it draws a boundary between public and nonpublic spheres.\nDifferent comprehensive views, however, might vary in just how they\ndraw that public/private boundary and there may be persistent\ncontroversy about how permeable it is. Nevertheless, the freestanding\npublic conception of justice as fairness, for example, will be fully\njustified for anyone in any of these different wide reflective\nequilibria. \nIt would be natural to object that if we require that full\njustification for individuals includes appeal to the varied religious\nand philosophical beliefs they hold, then overlapping consensus is\nindeed harder to achieve. Remember, Rawls has abandoned a shared wide\nreflective equilibrium for just such reasons. Overlapping consensus is\npossible, however, because groups sharing comprehensive views modify\nthe content of their comprehensive views over time in order to\ncooperate within shared democratic institutions. This process, on\nRawls's view, involves philosophical reflection, which often draws on\nthe complex resources of a tradition of thought in which disagreements\nhad flourished. It also crucially depends on the moderating influence\nof living under democratic institutions that are governed by the\nshared conception of justice. The effect of both institutions and\nreflection about internal disagreements about doctrine is that\nreasonable comprehensive world views can find room, from within their\nown perspectives, for a wide reflective equilibrium that includes the\nelements of public reason (the political reflective equilibrium) and a\nwillingness to engage in public methods of justification for them. \nIn sum, even though pluralism requires that we refrain from appealing\nto comprehensive world views in certain areas of political\ndeliberation with others, wide reflective equilibrium remains at the\ncenter of Rawls account of individual moral deliberation about\njustice. It survives as the coherentist account of “full\njustification” he defends. \nKey criticisms of the method of reflective equilibrium have challenged\nthe role it ascribes to moral intuitions, Rawls's incorporation of\nempirical facts (e.g., about human nature, such as the role of\nincentives in motivation), and its coherentism. We take these up in\nturn.  \nRawls does not talk about moral intuitions as the starting material\nfor the method of reflective equilibrium; instead he talks about\nconsidered moral judgments. Some commentators think the whole issue of\nthe relation between the method of reflective equilibrium and moral\nintuitions is resolved by noting that Rawls does not identify\nconsidered moral judgments with an appeal to moral intuitions. But\nthis ignores the criticism that can be focused on considered moral\njudgments as well as on moral intuitions. Central to the method of\nreflective equilibrium in ethics and political philosophy is the claim\nthat our considered moral judgments about particular cases carry\nweight, if only initial weight, in seeking justification. This claim\nis controversial. Some of the most vigorous criticism of it has come\nfrom utilitarians, and it is instructive to see why. \nA traditional criticism of utilitarianism is that it leads us to moral\njudgments about what is right that conflict with our\n“ordinary” moral judgments. In response, some utilitarians\naccept the relevance of some of these judgments and argue that\nutilitarianism is compatible with them. Thus Mill argued for a\nutilitarian foundation for our beliefs about the importance of\nindividual liberty. Some utilitarians have even argued that key\nfeatures of our “common sense morality” approximates\nutilitarian requirements and we have acquired these beliefs just\nbecause they do, unconsciously, reflect what promotes utility; they\nreflect the wisdom of a heritage. \nAn alternative utilitarian response to the claim that utilitarianism\nconflicts with certain ordinary moral judgments is to dismiss these\njudgments as pre-theoretical views—whether they are referred to\nas “intuitions” or “considered judgments” that\nprobably result from cultural indoctrination and thus reflect\nsuperstition, bias, and mere historical accident. On this view,\nneither moral intuitions nor judgments should have evidentiary\ncredentials and should play no role in moral theory construction or\njustification. Indeed, the prominent 20th-Century utilitarians Richard\nBrandt (Brandt 1979) and Richard Hare (Hare 1973) argued against\nRawls, simply making “coherent” a set of beliefs that have\nno “initial credibility” cannot produce justification,\nsince coherent fictions are still only fictions. Indeed, the\nconditional that Rawls describes under the process that we solicit\nconsidered moral judgments, namely that people be calm and have\nadequate information about the cases, do not by themselves do anything\nto assuage the utilitarian worries. Brandt (Brandt 1990) reaffirms his\nearly criticism when he claims that considered judgments lack\n“evidential force” regarding a moral order and therefore\ncoherence in reflective equilibrium has only a kind of persuasiveness\nthat comes from coherence among many elements being more convincing\nthan the conviction that comes from any of its parts. \nThis criticism has some—but not decisive— force, since two\nstandard ways of supplying credentials for initial judgments are not\navailable. One traditional way to support the reliability of these\njudgments or intuitions is to claim, as 18th century theorists did,\nthat they are the result of a special moral faculty that allows us to\ngrasp particular moral facts or universal principles. Modern\nproponents of reflective equilibrium reject such mysterious faculties.\nIndeed, they claim moral judgments are revisable, not\nfoundational. \nA second way to support the initial credibility of considered\njudgments is to draw an analogy between them and observations in\nscience or everyday life. For example, what counts as observational\nevidence in science depends on theory, and theory may give us reasons\nto reject some observations as not constituting counter-evidence to a\nscientific law or theory. In this way we might see an analogy between\nthe revisability of moral judgments and observations. \nDeveloping this analogy, however, seems to require that we also tell\nsome story about why moral judgments are reliable\n“observations” about what is right. The foundationalist\nview of moral intuitions held by McMahan (2000) and perhaps other\nrecent theorists who draw extensively on moral intuitions in their\nwork in substantive ethics also demands some story about their\nreliability and so does not avoid this difficulty, even if the view\nalso allows for defeasibility of some of the foundational intuitions.\nPerhaps we might need something like the causal story that some\ntheorists of knowledge offer to explain the reliability of\nobservations. Since no such story is forthcoming, opponents argue,\nproponents of reflective equilibrium must reject the requirement or\ngive up the analogy. Proponents of reflective equilibrium might reject\nthe requirement by suggesting it is premature to ask for such a story\nin ethics or by claiming that we can provide no analogous causal story\nfor credible judgments we make in other areas, including mathematics\nor logic. So the utilitarian objection is not conclusive. \nIt might seem that the burden of argument has shifted to advocates of\nreflective equilibrium to show why “initial credibility”\nshould be ascribed to moral judgments or intuitions. Defenders of\nreflective equilibrium may nevertheless reject this burden, arguing\nthat critics, especially utilitarian critics, actually face the same\nproblem. For example, Richard Brandt argues that “facts and\nlogic” alone, and not moral intuitions, should play a role in\nmoral theory construction and justification. On Brandt's view, we\nshould choose moral principles when they are based on desires that\nhave been subjected to maximal criticism by facts and logic alone (he\ncalls it “cognitive psychotherapy”). We should avoid any\nappeal to moral intuitions that might infect this critique. \nThe desires that Brandt appeals to, however, are themselves shaped and\ninfluenced by the very same social structures that utilitarians\ncomplain have biased and corrupted our moral judgments. Nothing in the\nprocess of critique by facts and logic alone can eliminate this source\nof bias. If this utilitarian claim is right, it undercuts the\nsuggestion that we can step outside our beliefs to arrive at some more\nobjective form of justification. Instead, we may be better off\nrecognizing that our process of critique—in the method of wide\nreflective equilibrium—is explicit about exposing the sources of\nbias and historical accident to criticism and revision, rather than\nfooling ourselves into thinking that desires are some sort of\nmorally-uninfluenced layer of “facts.” \nRawls claims that his view of justice is constructivist, meaning that\nhe appeals to some general claims about the nature of persons as well\nas some empirical facts about human behavior or institutions as part\nof the justification for the principles of justice (or the choice\nsituation that leads us to pick them). G.A. Cohen (2008) criticizes\nconstructivism, so understood, as not being capable of articulating\nthe content of what justice itself requires and instead being suited\nonly for selecting rules of regulation for society. The problem, he\nargues, is that constructivism combines considerations of justice with\nother considerations (both empirical and moral). As a result, it does\nnot tell us what justice itself requires. Specifically, he argues that\nif considerations of justice plus other values and some empirical\nfacts suggest that we should adopt certain rules to regulate our\ninstitutions, those rules cannot be principles of justice, since other\nconsiderations than justice contribute to our thinking that we should\nadopt them. A possible reply to Cohen is that his view about\nconstructivism collapses into his controversial metaethical claim that\nprinciples of justice cannot rest on general facts about human\nbehavior or anything else, if the other values that we consider are\nappropriately focused on determining what we think about justice. Then\nthe other considerations that continue to play a role are appeals to\nempirical facts. \nTo understand why the objection to constructivism collapses into\nCohen's metaethical view, if any values relevant to choices in the\nOriginal Position are relevant to determining what justice requires,\nconsider the following. Cohen claims that, if we appeal to reflective\nequilibrium as a justification of what justice requires, we need to\nstrip away from it any appeal to empirical facts and include only\nmoral intuitions about justice itself (Cohen 2007: p. 243, n. 19).\nSpecifically, he is saying that we might choose the right account of\njustice itself through appeal to a narrow reflective equilibrium that\navoids any empirical considerations, and this is true even if the\naccount of justice that applies to our world does involve some\nrelevant facts. This restriction on reflective equilibrium implies\nthat we would have to revise the account of the role of wide\nreflective equilibrium that we earlier attributed to Rawls,\nspecifically that it, and not narrow reflective equilibrium, plays a\njustificatory role in supporting justice as fairness. For example, we\nwould have to abandon the argument made earlier that inadequate\ncritical considerations play a role in narrow reflective equilibrium\nas compared with wide reflective equilibrium. \nRawls insists that the principles that emerge from the Original\nPosition must fit with our considered judgments about justice in wide\nreflective equilibrium. This constraint on the outcome of the Original\nPosition is aimed at showing that these principles are really\nprinciples of justice. On Cohen's view this constraint could not show\nwhat Rawls intends--the outcome for him of the choices made in the\nOriginal Position are rules of regulation, not principles of justice.\nBut if Cohen is wrong (as the objection we are examining implies)\nabout a broader set of values than justice being in play in the\nchoices made in the Original Position, then his objection to\nconstructivism collapses into his metaethical view, for it is an\nobjection to appealing to the facts that are part of the wide\nreflective equilibrium to which Rawls does appeal. Similarly, Rawls's\noverall account of justification makes the relative stability of a\nconception of justice (given facts about human nature and behavior)\npart of the justification for his principles of justice as fairness,\nbut Cohen concludes that this role is inappropriate. \nIf Cohen is right, then wide reflective equilibrium is not relevant to\nchoosing between Rawls's account of justice and some other theory\n(such as luck egalitarianism), because we must restrict ourselves to a\ndifferent, much narrower, version of reflective equilibrium to justify\nprinciples of justice. It would be odd to make such a substantive\nissue depend on a metaethical claim that Cohen himself says is not a\nsubstantive claim about which principles of justice are to be believed\nor accepted. \nOther criticisms of reflective equilibrium in ethics have focused on\npoints familiar from discussions in epistemology more generally. One\nimportant complaint concerns the vagueness of the concept of\ncoherence. If we simply take logical consistency as the criterion for\ncoherence, we have much too weak a constraint. What account can we\ngive of a stronger notion? \nMore has to be said about how some parts of the system of beliefs\n“support or explain” others than is provided in the\naccount above. Critics of Rawls's requirement that the contract\nsituation be adjusted, if necessary, to yield principles that are in\nreflective equilibrium with our judgments about justice complained\nthat this was a “rigged” contract and that it did no\njustificatory work beyond reflective equilibrium. If, however, the\nmoral judgments that play a role in discussions of fair process, the\nwell-ordered society, and the moral powers of agents are somewhat\nindependent of the considered judgments about justice, then we get the\nkind of independent support for the principles that add justificatory\nforce. Little work has actually been done, however, to flesh out a\nstronger account of coherence in ethics as opposed to epistemology\nmore generally, where coherentism has been defended and\nelaborated. \nA second line of objection derives from anti-coherentist accounts of\njustification rooted in the theory of knowledge. Some insist, for\nexample, that coherence accounts of justification cannot be divorced\nfrom coherence accounts of truth. On the other hand, Rawls view fits\nwith the claim by some contemporary theorists of knowledge that a\ncoherence account of justification is distinguishable from a coherence\naccount of truth and defensible when so separated. \nThis separability of justification from claims about truth is\nimportant to Rawls, even more so in his later work than in A\nTheory of Justice. In his earlier work, Rawls never claimed that\nwhat emerged from his contract and other justificatory conditions were\n“truths” of justice. (Arras’s (2007) conclusions\nemphasize the point that the method of reflective equilibrium does not\nassure us of truth—but the point was made explicit by Rawls\nhimself decades earlier.) Rather, the method of reflective equilibrium\nsuggested ways in which convergence might be achieved among those who\nbegan with disagreements about justice (of course, as Arras (2007) and\nKelly and McGrath (2010) emphasize, the method of reflective\nequilibrium does not guarantee convergence either). By drawing\nattention to the many features of a comprehensive theory on which\nargument and evidence could be brought to bear, the method of wide\nreflective equilibrium held out promise that more convergence might\nresult than if people had only considered judgments and principles to\nagree and disagree about. Convergence did not imply that truth was\nreached. A proponent of moral truth might still hope, however, that\nconvergence could be taken as evidence for truth, just as it commonly\nclaimed in non-normative areas of inquiry, contrary to the phenomenon\nthat believing may yield seeing. \nOnce Rawls took the “burdens of judgment” and reasonable\npluralism seriously, that is once he “politicized” justice\nin his later work, it became much less plausible to talk about\nconvergence on a shared wide equilibrium that might contain moral\ntruth. Comprehensive philosophical views, including those about moral\ntruth, were barred from playing a role in seeking the political\nreflective equilibrium involved in overlapping consensus. Even if we\nconverged in an “overlapping consensus” on a conception of\njustice, individuals and groups would be able to claim they are fully\njustified in accepting that conception of justice only if it cohered\nwith the perspectives of their distinct wide reflective equilibria. It\nbecame more important for Rawls to suggest how claims about justice\ncould be “objective” without presupposing moral truth.\nThese developments in Rawls's account thus appear to move him farther\naway from those who would seek to give a realist account of moral\ntruth. Thus when Arras (2007) concludes that reflective equilibrium\ncannot be a theory of truth, he does not disagree with Rawls, as noted\nearlier. More challenging is his conclusion that reflective\nequilibrium fails to provide a basis for intersubjective agreement if\nwe take seriously the importance of giving reflective equilibrium a\nglobal scope, since starting points are so different.  \nArras’s point may be a version of a claim about human rationality. A\nstarting point for this line of argument is the complaint that people\nwho have different starting points as their initial set of beliefs,\nsay with different degrees of credence given to their beliefs, may\narrive at different reflective equilibria points—a specific\nversion of which is Arras's point about the global scope of claims of\nintersubjectivity. This possibility undercuts the suggestion that\ncritical pressures alone deriving can produce convergence. A more\ngeneral form of this worry is that the model of reflection involved in\nreflective equilibrium, in which we are to produce coherence among all\nour beliefs, overemphasizes and idealizes human rationality. The\nsuggestion is that we would be better off presupposing a more minimal\nform of rationality. A specific version of this complaint is that the\nmethod involves an information burden that cannot be met. Yet another\nversion of this criticism is that we should allow for much less\n“rationalist” forms of modification of our views,\nrecognizing “conversion” experiences like those involved\nin “paradigm shifts” may affect any account of coherence.\nAnother line of argument emphasizes the information burden of the\nmethod—how can we be sure all appropriate theoretical views have\nbeen addressed. The suggestion (Arras 2007) is that wide reflective\nequilibrium is not action guiding in that it does not tell us which\nviews to save and which to revise and so it does not lead to\njustification or truth. \nA full defense of reflective equilibrium as a method would require a\nmore developed response to many of these lines of criticism than\nexists in the literature. \nDespite these criticisms, some philosophers have argued for a broader\nunderstanding of the relevance of the method of reflective equilibrium\nto practical ethics. In thinking about the course of right action in a\nparticular case, we often appeal to reasons and principles that are\nnotoriously general and lack the kind of specificity that make them\nsuitable to govern the case at hand without committing us to\nimplications we cannot accept in other contexts. This requires that we\nrefine or specify the reasons and principles if we are to provide\nappropriate justifications for what we do and appropriate guidance for\nrelated cases. Philosophers who have focused attention on the\nimportance of specification have drawn on the method of reflective\nequilibrium for their insights into the problem. \nIn practical ethics, especially bioethics, there has been a vigorous\ndebate about methodology. Some argue that we must root all claims\nabout specific cases in specific ethical theories, and the hard work\nis showing how these theories apply to specific cases. Others argue\nthat we may disagree about many aspects of general theory but still\nagree on principles, and the hard work of practical ethics consists in\nfitting sometimes conflicting principles to particular cases. Still\nothers argue that we must begin our philosophical work with detailed\nunderstanding of the texture and specificity of a case, avoiding the\ntemptation to intrude general principles or theories into the\nanalysis. \nA grasp of the method of wide reflective equilibrium suggests a way\naround this exclusionary nature of this debate. Wide reflective\nequilibrium shows us the complex structure of justification in ethics\nand political philosophy, revealing many connections among our\ncomponent beliefs. At the same time, there are many different types of\nethical analysis and normative inquiry. \nThis suggests a more eclectic view of the debate about method. Work in\nethics requires all levels of inquiry proposed by the disputants, not\nalways all at once or in each case, but at some time or other.\nSometimes it is true that we cannot resolve disputes about how to\nweigh conflicts among principles unless we bring more theoretical\nconsiderations to bear (these considerations need not involve\ncomprehensive ethical theories). Sometimes we can agree on relevant\nprinciples and agree to disagree on other theoretical issues, still\narriving at agreement about the rightness of particular policies or\nactions and their justification in light of relevant reasons and\nprinciples. Sometimes we must see what is distinctive about particular\ncases and revise or refine our reasons and principles before we can\narrive at understanding of what to do. Finally, and of the greatest\nsignificance, the method of wide reflective equilibrium should make it\nclear that work in ethical theory cannot be divorced from work in\npractical ethics. We must test and revise theory in light of our\nconsidered judgments about moral practice. The condescending attitude\nof many who work in ethical theory toward work in practical ethics\nthus is incompatible with what wide reflective equilibrium establishes\nabout the relationship between these areas of ethical inquiry. \nThe method of wide reflective equilibrium makes it plausible that all\nsuch “methods” should be seen as appropriate to some tasks\nin ethics and are but parts of a more encompassing method.","contact.mail":"ndaniels@hsph.harvard.edu","contact.domain":"hsph.harvard.edu"}]
