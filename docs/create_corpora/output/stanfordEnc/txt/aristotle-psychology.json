His life in Athens\ndivides into two periods, first as a member of Plato’s Academy\n(367–347) and later as director of his own school, the Lyceum\n(334–323). The intervening years were spent mainly in Assos and Lesbos,\nand briefly back in Macedon. His years away from Athens were\npredominantly taken up with biological research and writing. Judged on\nthe basis of their content, Aristotle’s most important psychological\nwritings probably belong to his second residence in Athens, and so to\nhis most mature period. His principal work in psychology, De\nAnima, reflects in different ways his pervasive interest in\nbiological taxonomy and his most sophisticated physical and\nmetaphysical theory.\n\n\n\nBecause of the long tradition of exposition which has developed\naround Aristotle’s De Anima, the interpretation of even its\nmost central theses is sometimes disputed. Moreover, because of its\nevident affinities with some prominent approaches in contemporary\nphilosophy of mind, Aristotle’s psychology has received renewed\ninterest and has incited intense interpretative dispute in recent\ndecades. Consequently, this entry proceeds on two levels. The main\narticle recounts the principal and distinctive claims of Aristotle’s\npsychology, avoiding so far as possible exegetical controversy and\ncritical commentary. At the end of appropriate sections of the main\narticle, readers are invited to explore problematic or advanced\nfeatures of Aristotle’s theories by following the appropriate\nlinks.\n\n\n\nAristotle investigates psychological phenomena primarily in De\nAnima and a loosely related collection of short works called the\nParva Naturalia, whose most noteworthy pieces are De\nSensu and De Memoria. He also touches upon psychological\ntopics, often only incidentally, in his ethical, political, and\nmetaphysical treatises, as well as in his scientific writings,\nespecially De Motu Animalium. The works in the Parva\nNaturalia are, in comparison with De Anima, empirically\noriented, investigating, as Aristotle says, “the phenomena common\nto soul and body” (De Sensu 1, 436a6–8). This contrasts\nwith De Anima, which introduces as a question for\nconsideration “whether all affections are common to what has the\nsoul or whether there is some affection peculiar to the soul\nitself” (De Anima i 1, 402a3–5). That is, in De\nAnima Aristotle wants to know whether all psychological states are\nalso material states of the body. “This,” he remarks,\n“it is necessary to grasp, but not easy” (De Anima\ni 1, 402a5). In this way, De Anima proceeds at a higher level\nof abstraction than the Parva Naturalia. It is generally more\ntheoretical, more self-conscious about method, and more alert to\ngeneral philosophical questions about perception, thinking, and\nsoul-body relations. \n\nIn both De Anima and the Parva Naturalia,\nAristotle assumes something which may strike some of his modern readers\nas odd. He takes psychology to be the branch of science which\ninvestigates the soul and its properties, but he thinks of the soul as\na general principle of life, with the result that Aristotle’s\npsychology studies all living beings, and not merely those he regards\nas having minds, human beings. So, in De Anima, he takes it as\nhis task to provide an account of the life activities of plants and\nanimals, along side those of humans (De Anima ii 11, 423a20–6,\ncf. ii 1, 412a13; cf. De Generatione Animalium ii 3, 736b13;\nDe Partibus Animalium iv 5, 681a12). In comparison with the\nmodern discipline of Psychology, then, Aristotle’s psychology is broad\nin scope. He even devotes attention to the question of the nature of\nlife itself, a subject which falls outside the purview of psychology in\nmost contemporary contexts. On Aristotle’s approach, psychology studies\nthe soul (psuchê in Greek, or anima in Latin);\nso it naturally investigates all ensouled or animate beings. \n\nThere is, however, one telling point of contact between Aristotle’s\ninvestigations into the soul and the contemporary discipline of\nPsychology: in each case, different questions yield different\ndirections and methods of inquiry, with the result that it is sometimes\nhard to appreciate how so many variegated enterprises, though conducted\nunder one and the same rubric, could really belong to any one\ncoordinated discipline. Someone studying methods of Freudian\npsychoanalysis will not, after all, have any immediate overlap of\neither interest or method with a brain physiologist or a behavioral\ngeneticist. In a similar way, Aristotle seems reluctant to regard an\ninquiry into the soul as belonging exclusively to natural science,\nwhich is for him the branch of theoretical science devoted to\ninvestigating beings capable of undergoing change. (He contrasts\n“physics”, that is, natural science, with both mathematics and “first\nphilosophy” along these lines; Meta. vi 1 1025b27–30, 1026a18;\nxi 7 1064a16–19, b1–3.) On the one hand, he insists that because\nvarious psychological states, including anger, joy, courage, pity,\nloving, and hating, all involve the body in central and obvious ways,\nthe study of soul “is already in the province of the natural scientist”\n(De Anima i 1 403a16–28). At the same time, however, he\ninsists that the mind or intellect (nous) may not be enmeshed\nin the body in the same way as these sorts of states, and so denies\nthat the study of soul falls in its entirety to the natural scientist\n(Meta. vi 1 1026a4–6; De Partibus Animalium i 1\n645a33-b10). This is presumably why in the opening chapter of De\nAnima Aristotle reports a deep and authentic perplexity about the\nbest method for investigating psychological matters (De Anima\ni 1 402a16–22). If different sciences employ different methods and the\nstudy of soul is bifurcated so that it belongs to no one science, there\nwill indeed be a genuine difficulty about how best to proceed in any\ninquiry concerning it. It seems fair to say that these sorts of\nquandaries have not left us altogether. Although purely naturalistic\napproaches to philosophy of mind have found staunch champions in\ncontemporary times, it would nevertheless be safe to say that much of\nthe discipline continues to employ traditional a priori\nmethods; some branches of cognitive science seem an admixture of both.\nIn any case, in view of the difficulties concerning the soul he\nenumerates, Aristotle evinces an appropriate modesty when undertaking\nits investigation: “Grasping anything trustworthy concerning the soul\nis completely and in every way among the most difficult of affairs”\n(De Anima i 1 402a10–11). \n\nIn De Anima, Aristotle makes extensive use of technical\nterminology introduced and explained elsewhere in his writings. He\nclaims, for example, using vocabulary derived from his physical and\nmetaphysical theories, that the soul is a “first actuality of a\nnatural organic body” (De Anima ii 1, 412b5–6), that it\nis a “substance as form of a natural body which has life in\npotentiality” (De Anima ii 1, 412a20–1) and, similarly,\nthat it “is a first actuality of a natural body which has life in\npotentiality” (De Anima ii 1, 412a27–8), all claims\nwhich apply to plants, animals and humans alike. \n\nIn characterizing the soul and body in these ways, Aristotle applies\nconcepts drawn from his broader hylomorphism, a conceptual\nframework which underlies virtually all of his mature theorizing. It is\naccordingly necessary to begin with a brief overview of that framework.\nThereafter it will be possible to recount Aristotle’s general approach\nto soul-body relations, and then, finally, to consider his analyses of\nthe individual faculties of soul. \n\n‘Hylomorphism’ is simply a compound word composed of the\nGreek terms for matter (hulê) and form or shape\n(morphê); thus one could equally describe Aristotle’s\nview of body and soul as an instance of his\n“matter-formism.” That is, when he introduces the soul as\nthe form of the body, which in turn is said to be the\nmatter of the soul, Aristotle treats soul-body relations as a\nspecial case of a more general relationship which obtains between the\ncomponents of all generated compounds, natural or artifactual. \n\nThe notions of form and matter are themselves, however, developed\nwithin the context of a general theory of causation and explanation\nwhich appears in one guise or another in all of Aristotle’s mature\nworks. According to this theory, when we wish to explain what there is\nto know, for example, about a bronze statue, a complete account\nnecessarily alludes to at least the following four factors: the\nstatue’s matter, its form or structure, the agent responsible for that\nmatter manifesting its form or structure, and the purpose for which the\nmatter was made to realize that form or structure. These four factors\nhe terms the four causes (aitiai): \n\nFor a broad range of cases, Aristotle implicitly makes twin claims\nabout these four causes: (i) a complete explanation requires reference\nto all four; and (ii) once such reference is made, no further\nexplanation is required. Thus, when appropriate, appeal to the four\ncauses is both necessary and sufficient for completeness and adequacy\nin explanation. Although not all things which admit of explanation have\nall four causes, e.g., geometrical figures are not efficiently caused,\neven a brief overview of his psychological writings reveals that\nAristotle regards all four causes as in play in the explanation of\nliving beings. A monkey, for example, has matter, its body; form, its\nsoul; an efficient cause, its parent; and a final cause, its function.\nMoreover, he holds that the form is the actuality of the body\nwhich is its matter: an indeterminate lump of bronze becomes a statue\nonly when it realizes some particular statue-shape. So, Aristotle\nsuggests, matter is potentially some F until it\nacquires an actualizing form, when it becomes actually F.\nGiven his overarching explanatory schema, it is hardly surprising that\nAristotle should advance a hylomorphic account of soul and body; this\nis, for him, standard explanatory procedure. \n\nStill, it is noteworthy that this four-causal framework of\nexplanation was developed initially in response to some puzzles about\nchange and generation. Aristotle argues with some justification that\nall change and generation require the existence of something complex:\nwhen a statue comes to be from a lump of bronze, there is some\ncontinuing subject, the bronze, and something it comes to acquire, its\nnew form. Thus the statue is, and must be, a certain kind of compound,\none of form and matter. Without this type of complexity, generation\nwould be impossible; since generation in fact occurs, form and matter\nmust be genuine features of generated compounds. Similarly, but less\nobviously, qualitative change requires much the same apparatus: when a\nstatue is painted, there is some continuing subject, the statue, and a\nnew feature acquired, its new color. Here too there is complexity, and\ncomplexity which is readily articulated in terms of form and matter,\nbut now of form which is evidently inessential to the continued\nexistence of the entity whose form it is. The statue continues to\nexist, but receives a form which is accidental to it; it might lose\nthat form without going out of existence. By contrast, should the\nstatue lose its essential form, as would happen for example if the\nbronze which constitutes it were melted, divided, and recast as twelve\ndozen letter openers, it would cease to exist altogether. \n\nFor the purposes of understanding Aristotle’s psychology, the\norigin of Aristotle’s hylomorphism is significant for two\nreasons. First, from its inception, Aristotle’s hylomorphism\nexploits two distinct but related notions of form, one of which is\nessential to the compound whose form it is, and the other of which is\naccidental to its subject.  In advancing his view of the soul and its\ncapacities, Aristotle employs both of these notions: the soul is an\nessential form, whereas perception involves the acquisition of\naccidental forms. Second, because Aristotle’s hylomorphism was\ninitially developed to handle puzzles of change and generation, its\ndeployment in philosophical psychology is sometimes strained, insofar\nas Aristotle is not immediately willing to treat every instance of\nperception and thought as a straightforward instance of change in some\ncontinuing subject.  Moreover, as we shall see, it is sometimes\ndifficult to appreciate how Aristotle can justifiably regard the body\nas the matter of a human being in the way that the bronze is held to\nbe the matter of a statue.  Bronze can exist as an indeterminate lump,\nbeing potentially but not actually the statue of a great hero. There\nis no ready analogue in the case of the body: the body is not so much\nstuff lying about waiting to be enformed by a soul. Rather, in one\nimportant sense, human bodies become human bodies by being\nensouled. If so, then they seem ill-suited to play the role of matter\nin precisely those terms given by Aristotle’s hylomorphic theory\nof generation. \n\nIn applying his general hylomorphism to soul-body relations,\nAristotle contends that the following general analogy obtains: \n\nIf the soul bears the same relation to the body which the shape of a\nstatue bears to its material basis, then we should expect some general\nfeatures to be common to both; and we should be able to draw some\nimmediate consequences regarding the relationship between soul and\nbody. To begin, some questions about the unity of soul and body, an\nissue of concern to substance dualists and materialists alike, receive\na ready response. Materialists hold that all mental states are also\nphysical states; substance dualists deny this, because they hold that\nthe soul is a subject of mental states which can exist alone, when\nseparated from the body. In a certain way, the questions which give\nrise to this dispute simply fall by the wayside. If we do not think\nthere is an interesting or important question concerning whether the\nHermes-shape and its material basis are one, we should not suppose\nthere is a special or pressing question about whether the soul and body\nare one. So Aristotle contends: “It is not necessary to ask\nwhether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask\nwhether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter\nof each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if\none and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken\nof is the actuality” (De Anima ii 1, 412b6–9). Aristotle\ndoes not here eschew questions concerning the unity of soul and body as\nmeaningless; rather, he seems, in a deflationary vein, to suggest that\nthey are readily answered or somehow unimportant. If we do not spend\ntime worrying about whether the wax of a candle and its shape are one,\nthen we should not exercise ourselves over the question of whether the\nsoul and body are one. The effect, then, is to fit soul-body relations\ninto a larger hylomorphic pattern of explanation in terms of which\nquestions of unity do not normally arise. \n\nIt should be emphasized, however, that Aristotle does not here\ndecide the question by insisting that the soul and body are identical,\nor even that they are one in some weaker sense; indeed, this is\nsomething he evidently denies (De Anima ii 1, 412a17; ii 2,\n414a1–20). Instead, just as one might well insist that the wax of a\ncandle and its shape are distinct, on the grounds that the wax could\neasily exist when the particular shape is no more, or, less obviously,\nthat the particular shape could survive the replenishment of its\nmaterial basis, so one might equally deny that the soul and body are\nidentical. In a fairly direct way, though, the question of whether soul\nand body are one loses its force when it is allowed that it contains no\nimplications beyond those we establish for any other hylomorphic\ncompound, including houses and other ordinary artifacts. \n\nOne way of appreciating this is to consider a second general moral\nAristotle derives from hylomorphism. This concerns the question of the\nseparability of the soul from the body, a possibility embraced by\nsubstance dualists from the time of Plato onward. Aristotle’s\nhylomorphism commends the following attitude: if we do not think that\nthe Hermes-shape persists after the bronze is melted and recast, we\nshould not think that the soul survives the demise of the body. So,\nAristotle claims, “It’s clear that the soul is not separable\nfrom the body – or that certain parts of it, if it naturally has\nparts, are not separable from the body” (De Anima ii 1,\n413a3–5). So, unless we are prepared to treat forms in general\nas capable of existing without their material bases, we should not be\ninclined to treat souls as exceptional cases. Hylomorphism, by itself,\ngives us no reason to treat souls as separable from bodies, even if we\nthink of them as distinct from their material bases. At the same time,\nAristotle does not appear to think that his hylomorphism somehow\nrefutes all possible forms of dualism.  For he appends to his denial\nof the soul’s separability the observation that some parts of\nthe soul may in the end be separable after all, since they are not the\nactualities of any part of the body (De Anima ii 1,\n413a6–7). Aristotle here prefigures his complex attitude toward\nmind (nous), a faculty he repeatedly describes as exceptional\namong capacities of the soul. \n\nStill, in general, the soul is the form of the body in much the same\nway the form of a house structures the bricks and mortar from which it\nis built. When the bricks and mortar realize a certain shape, they\nmanifest the function definitive of houses, namely that of providing\nshelter. Thus, the presence of the form makes those bricks and that\nmortar a house, as opposed, e.g., to a wall or an oven. As we have\nseen, Aristotle will say that the bricks and mortar, as matter, are\npotentially a house, until they realize the form appropriate to houses,\nin which case the form and matter together make an actual house. So, in\nAristotle’s terms, the form is the actuality of the house, since its\npresence explains why this particular quantity of matter comes to be a\nhouse as opposed to some other kind of artifact. \n\nIn the same way, then, the presence of the soul explains why this\nmatter is the matter of a human being, as opposed to some other kind of\nthing. Now, this way of looking at soul-body relations as a special\ncase of form-matter relations treats reference to the soul as an\nintegral part of any complete explanation of a living being, of any\nkind. To this degree, Aristotle thinks that Plato and other dualists\nare right to stress the importance of the soul in explanations of\nliving beings. At the same time, he sees their commitment to the\nseparability of the soul from the body as unjustified merely by appeal\nto formal causation: he will allow that the soul is distinct from the\nbody, and is indeed the actuality of the body, but he sees that these\nconcessions by themselves provide no grounds for supposing that the\nsoul can exist without the body. His hylomorphism, then, embraces\nneither reductive materialism nor Platonic dualism. Instead, it seeks\nto steer a middle course between these alternatives by pointing out,\nimplicitly, and rightly, that these are not exhaustive options. \n\nFurther Discussion of Hylomorphism: \n\n Supplement: A Question about the Metaphysics of Souls \n\nAlthough willing to provide a common account of the soul in these\ngeneral terms, Aristotle devotes most of his energy in De\nAnima to detailed investigations of the soul’s individual\ncapacities or faculties, which he first lists as nutrition,\nperception, and mind, with perception receiving the lion’s share of\nattention. He later also introduces desire, evidently as a discrete\nfaculty on par with those initially introduced. The broadest is\nnutrition, which is shared by all natural living organisms; animals\nhave perception in addition; and among natural organisms humans alone\nhave mind. Aristotle maintains that various kinds of souls, nutritive,\nperceptual, and intellectual, form a kind of hierarchy. Any creature\nwith reason will also have perception; any creature with perception\nwill also have the ability to take on nutrition and to reproduce; but\nthe converse does not hold. Thus, plants show up with only the\nnutritive soul, animals have both perceptual and nutritive faculties,\nand humans have all three. The reasons why this should be so are\nbroadly teleological. In brief, every living creature as such grows,\nreaches maturity, and declines. Without a nutritive capacity, these\nactivities would be impossible (De Anima iii 12,\n434a22–434b18; cf. De Partibus Animalium iv 10, 687a24–690a10;\nMetaphysics xii 10, 1075a16–25). So, Aristotle concludes,\npsychology must investigate not only perceiving and thinking, but also\nnutrition. \n\nThere is some dispute about which of the psychic abilities mentioned\nby Aristotle in De Anima qualify as full-fledged or autonomous\nfaculties. He evidently accepts the three already mentioned as\ncentrally important. Indeed, he is willing to demarcate a hierarchy of\nlife in terms of them. Even so, he also discusses two other capacities,\nimagination (De Anima iii 3) and desire (De Anima iii\n9 and 10), and appeals to them in both his account of thinking and his\nphilosophy of action. He does little, however, to characterize either\nin any intrinsic way. He evidently regards imagination as a sort of\nsubordinate faculty, integrated in various ways with the faculties of\nnutrition, perception, and thought. Desire is still more complex.\nDespite its not occurring without the sensory faculty (De Anima\niii 7 412a12–14), desire seems in the end elevated to a full capacity,\nprimarily because of its role in the explanation of purposive behavior.\nHis discussions of imagination and desire raise interesting questions\nabout how Aristotle views the various capacities of soul as integrating\ninto unified forms. They also raise questions along with his\ndiscussions of the other faculties as to how Aristotle conceives the\nunity of the whole soul. Some scholars seem content to characterize an\nAristotelian soul as a set or sum of capacities, whereas Aristotle\nhimself evidently demands a non-aggregative form of unity (De\nAnima ii 3 414b28–32, cf. iii 9 432a–b6). \n\nWhen turning to these individual faculties of the soul, Aristotle\nconsiders nutrition first, for two related reasons. The first is\nstraightforward: psychology considers all animate entities, and the\nnutritive soul belongs to all naturally living things, since it is\n“the first and most common capacity of soul, in virtue of which\nlife belongs to all living things” (De Anima ii 4,\n415a24–25). The second is slightly more complex, being at root\nteleological. Given that the higher forms of soul presuppose nutrition,\nits explication is prior to them in the order of Aristotle’s\nexposition. \n\nAristotle approaches his account of the nutritive soul by relying on\na methodological precept which informs much of his psychological\ntheorizing, namely that a capacity is individuated by its objects, so\nthat, e.g., perception is distinguished from mind by being arrayed\ntoward sensible qualities rather than intelligible forms (De\nAnima ii 4, 415a20–21). This induces him to offer what may sound\ninitially like a pedestrian observation, that in nutrition there are\nthree components, “that which is nourished, that by which it is\nnourished, and what nourishes (i.e. that which engages in\nnutrition).” This, however, Aristotle unpacks by maintaining that\n“what nourishes is the primary soul; what is nourished is the\nbody which has this soul; and that by which it is nourished is\nnourishment (i.e. food)” (De Anima ii 4, 416b20–23). The\ninterest of this suggestion lies in the implication that all and only\nliving systems can be nourished, a consequence Aristotle makes more\nexplicit by claiming that “nothing is nourished which does not\nhave a share in life” (De Anima ii 4. 415b27–28) and\nthat “since nothing is nourished which does not partake of life,\nwhat is nourished will be the ensouled body insofar as it is ensouled,\nwith the result that nourishment (i.e. food) is related to the\nensouled, and not coincidentally” (De Anima ii 4,\n416b9–11). Here Aristotle means that food, as food, is definitionally\nrelated to life. Whatever is food is already such as to be necessarily\nrelated to living beings. \n\nThe significance of this observation resides in the thought that any\nadequate account of nutrition will make ineliminable reference to life\nas such. This in turn entails that it will not be possible to\ndefine life as the capacity for taking on nutrition. For then\nwe would have a vicious circularity: a living system is the sort of\nthing which can take on nutrition, while nutrition is whatever stuff is\nsuch as to sustain a living system. So, if living systems cannot be\nreductively defined in some other way, it will follow that no reductive\naccount of life will be forthcoming. Consequently, Aristotle’s\ndiscussion of nutrition provides some reason for thinking that he will\nresist any attempt to define life in terms which do not themselves\nimplicitly appeal to life itself. That is, he will resist any reductive\naccount of life. \n\nThis also seems to be the purport of Aristotle’s rejection of the\nsimple mechanistic accounts of growth which he considers when\ndiscussing the nutritive soul (De Anima ii 4, 415b27–416a20;\ncf. De Generatione et Corruptione i 5). Aristotle objects to\nthose who want to account for growth merely in terms of the natural\ntendencies of material elements. For growth is a constrained\npattern of development, the source of which Aristotle ascribes to the\nsoul. He takes it as evident that growth in organisms proceeds along\nstructured paths, in end-directed ways. These structures in turn\nmanifest capacities whose explication cannot be given in crude\nmaterialistic terms; for materialistic terms, as Aristotle understands\nthem, fail to account for the fact that mature members of species cease\ngrowing, having realized the structures characteristic of their kind.\nFire, for example, by contrast “grows” haphazardly, without\ndirectionality, flowing towards the combustible without end, until\nhindered by external impediments or lack of fuel. \n\nNow, the forms of materialist explanations Aristotle considers are\nprimitive. One critical question about his treatment of these\nexplanations concerns whether he is right to suggest that facts about\nconstrained patterns of development are incompatible with more\nexplanatorily advanced forms of materialism, and, if so, whether those\nforms of materialism will be reductive in the sense that they will\navoid all implicit or explicit reference to life. So far, there is\nlittle reason to think that Aristotle has been proven wrong; that is,\nthere is at present no reductive account of life which enjoys universal\nor even broad support. \n\nIn any case, Aristotle’s discussion of nutrition is characteristic\nof his general approach to the soul’s faculties. His discussions often\nproceed on two levels. On the one hand, he simply seeks to provide an\naccount of the relevant phenomena. At the same time, his interests in\ndefinition are conditioned by a host of broader methodological and\nmetaphysical concerns. Consequently, he attempts to capture the nature\nof the individual faculties while at the same time investigating\nwhether reductive accounts of them are plausible. In this way, at\nleast, Aristotle’s investigations reflect sensitivity to an array of\ninterlocking questions in definitional methodology, including most\nnotably questions about the plausibility of reductive approaches to\nlife’s most characteristic features. These same interests are apparent\nin his discussions of perception and mind. \n\nAristotle devotes a great deal of attention to perception,\ndiscussing both the general faculty and the individual senses. In both\ncases, his discussions are cast in hylomorphic terms. Perception is the\ncapacity of the soul which distinguishes animals from plants; indeed,\nhaving a perceptive faculty is definitive of being an animal (De\nSensu 1, 436b10–12); every animal has at least touch, whereas most\nhave the other sensory modalities as well (De Anima ii 2\n413b4–7). In broad terms at least, animals must have perception if they\nare to live. So, Aristotle supposes, there are defensible teleological\ngrounds for treating animals as essentially capable of perceiving\n(De Anima ii 3, 414b6–9, 434a30–b4; De Sensu 1,\n436b16–17). If an animal is to grow to maturity and propagate, it must\nbe able to take in nourishment and to navigate its way through the\nworld. Perception serves these ends. \n\nThis much, however, does not explain how perception occurs.\nAristotle claims that perception is best understood on the model of\nhylomorphic change generally: just as a house changes from blue to\nwhite when acted upon by the agency of a painter applying paint, so\n“perception comes about with <an organ’s> being changed and\naffected … for it seems to be a kind of alteration”\n(De Anima ii 5, 416b33–34). So in line with his general\naccount of alteration, Aristotle treats perception as a case of\ninteraction between two suitable agents: objects capable of acting and\ncapacities capable of being affected. That the agents and patients must\nboth be suitable is important, since we need to distinguish\nbetween two ways, e.g., an odor might affect something. By being placed\nin its vicinity, a clove of garlic might affect a block of tofu. The\ntofu might well come to take on the odor of the garlic. But we would\nnot want to say that the tofu perceives the garlic. By contrast, when\nan animal is affected by the same clove, it perceives the odor. Since\nthe garlic is the same in both cases, the difference in these cases\nmust reside in the character of the object affected. When animals\nreceive perceptual forms, perception results; when non-living entities\nare affected by what seem to be the same forms, only non-perceptual\nalteration occurs. \n\nIn both kinds of alterations, Aristotle is happy to speak of an\naffected thing as receiving the form of the agent which affects it and\nof the change consisting in the affected thing’s “becoming\nlike” the agent (De Anima ii 5, 418a3–6; ii 12,\n424a17–21). So there is in both cases a hylomorphic model of alteration\ninvolving enforming, that is, a model according to which\nchange is explained by the acquisition of a form by something capable\nof receiving it. Consequently, whatever is changed in a given way is\nnecessarily such that it is capable of being changed in that way. This\nis not the mere triviality that whatever becomes actually F\nmust already be possibly F. Instead, it is the recognition\nthat specific forms of change require suitable capacities in the\nchanging subjects, and that, consequently, analyses of specific forms\nof change will necessarily involve consideration of those capacities.\nNo marshmallow can receive the form of an actual automobile; and only\nentities capable of perceiving can receive the perceptible forms of\nobjects. This is Aristotle’s meaning when he claims: “the\nperceptive faculty is in potentiality such as the object of perception\nalready is in actuality” and that when something is affected by\nan object of perception, “it is made like it and is such as that\nthing is” (De Anima ii 5, 418a3–6). \n\nThis hylomorphic restriction on the suitability of subjects of\nchange has the effect of limiting cases of actual perception to those\ninstances of form-reception which involve living beings endowed with\nthe appropriate faculties. It does not, however, explain just what\nthose faculties are, nor even how they are “made like”\ntheir objects of perception. Minimally, though, Aristotle claims that\nfor some subject S and some sense object O: \n\nEach of these clauses requires unpacking. The plausibility of\nAristotle’s theory turns on their eventual explications. The first\nclause (i) is intended to distinguish the active capacities of animals\nfrom the merely passive capacities of lifeless material bodies,\nincluding the media through which sensible forms travel. (Just as we do\nnot want to say that the tofu in the refrigerator perceives the garlic\nnext to it, we do not want to say that air perceives the color blue\nwhen affected by the color of a car.) But it does not yet specify what\nis required for having the requisite active capacities. Also difficult\nis the notion of isomorphism appealed to in (iii). As stated, (iii)\ninvites, and has received, scrutiny. Interpretations range from\ntreating the form of isomorphism as direct and literal, so that, e.g.,\nthe eyes become speckled when viewing a robin’s egg, to attenuated,\nwhere the isomorphism is more akin to that enjoyed between a house and\nits blue-print. Here especially the plausibility of Aristotle’s\nhylomorphic analysis of perception hangs in the balance. \n\nFurther Discussion: Perception and Imagination \n\n Supplement: Imagination \n\nAristotle describes mind (nous, often also rendered as\n“intellect” or “reason”) as “the part of the soul by which it\nknows and understands” (De Anima iii 4, 429a9–10; cf.\niii 3, 428a5; iii 9, 432b26; iii 12, 434b3), thus characterizing it in\nbroadly functional terms. It is plain that humans can know and\nunderstand things; indeed, Aristotle supposes that it is our very\nnature to desire knowledge and understanding (Metaphysics i 1,\n980a21; De Anima ii 3, 414b18; iii 3, 429a6–8). In this way,\njust as the having of sensory faculties is essential to being an\nanimal, so the having of a mind is essential to being a human. Human\nminds do more than understand, however. It is equally essential to the\nhuman being to plan and deliberate, to ponder alternatives and\nstrategize, and generally to chart courses of action. Aristotle\nascribes these activities no less than understanding and contemplation\nto mind and consequently distinguishes the “practical mind” (or\n“practical intellect” or “practical reason”) from “theoretical mind”\n(or “theoretical intellect” or “theoretical reason”) ( Nicomachean\nEthics vi 8 1143a35-b5; see\n Aristotle: ethics).\n In all these ways,\ninvestigating this capacity of soul thus has a special significance for\nAristotle: in investigating mind, he is investigating what makes humans\nhuman. \n\nHis primary investigation of mind occurs in two chapters of De\nAnima, both of which are richly suggestive, but neither of which\nadmits of easy or uncontroversial exposition. In De Anima iii\n4 and 5, Aristotle approaches the nature of thinking by once again\ndeploying a hylomorphic analysis, given in terms of form reception.\nJust as perception involves the reception of a sensible form by a\nsuitably qualified sensory faculty, so thinking involves the reception\nof an intelligible form by a suitably qualified intellectual faculty\n(De Anima iii 4, 429a13–18). According to this model, thinking\nconsists in a mind’s becoming enformed by some object of thought, so\nthat actual thinking occurs whenever some suitably prepared mind is\n“made like” its object by being affected by it. \n\nThis hylomorphic analysis of thinking is evidently a simple\nextension of the general model of hylomorphic change exploited by\nAristotle in a host of similar contexts. Accordingly, Aristotle’s\ninitial account of thinking will directly parallel his analysis of\nperception (De Anima iii 4, 429a13–18). That is, at least in\nschematic outline, Aristotle will offer the following approach. For any\ngiven thinker S and an arbitrary object of thought\nO: \n\nUnsurprisingly, the same questions which arose in the case of\nperception also arise here. Most immediately, to understand Aristotle’s\napproach to thinking, it is necessary to determine what it means to say\nthat a thinker’s mind and its object become isomorphic. \n\nHere, at least, Aristotle points out what is obvious, that when a\nthinker’s soul is made like its cognitive object, it does not become\none with some hylomorphic compound, but with its form: “for it is\nnot the stone which is in the soul, but its form” (De\nAnima iii 8, 431b29–432a1; cf. iii 4, 429a27). The suggestion is,\nthen, that when S comes to think of a stone, as opposed to\nmerely perceiving some particular stone, S has a faculty which\nis such that it can become one in form with that stone. Aristotle\nsometimes infers from this sort of consideration that thought is of\nuniversals, whereas perception is of particulars (De Anima ii\n5, 417b23, Posterior Analytics i 31, 87b37–88a7),\nthough he elsewhere will allow that we also have knowledge of\nindividuals (De Anima ii 5, 417a29; Metaphysics xiii\n10, 1087a20). These passages are not contradictory, since Aristotle may\nsimply be emphasizing that thought tends to proceed at a higher level\nof generality than perception, because of its trading in comparatively\nabstract structural features of its objects. A person can think of what\nit is to be a stone, but cannot, in any direct and literal sense of the\nterm, perceive this. \n\nHowever that may be, Aristotle’s conception of thinking implicates\nhim in supposing that thought involves grasping the structural features\nof the objects of thought. To take an initially favorable case, when\nthinking that tree frogs are oviparous, S will be in\na psychic state whose internal structural states are, among other\nthings, one in form with tree frogs. Since S’s soul does not\nbecome a tree frog when thinking of tree frogs (De\nAnima iii 8, 431b24–30), this form of isomorphism cannot be\nmere instantiation of the form being a tree frog. Rather,\nS’s mind will evidently be one in form with the tree frog, to\nrevert to our earlier analogy, in something like the way a blueprint\nand the house of which it is the blueprint are one in form. There must\nbe a determinate and expressible structural isomorphism, even though\none could not say that the blueprint realizes the form of the house.\nHouses are, after all, necessarily three-dimensional. \n\nFor Aristotle, it is not a contingent state of affairs that\nS’s mind does not realize the form being a tree frog in the\nway that tree frogs themselves do. On the contrary, the mind\ncannot realize a broad range of forms: the mind is, according\nto Aristotle, not “mixed with the body”, insofar as it,\nunlike the perceptual faculty, lacks a bodily organ (De Anima\niii 4, 429a24–7). As such, it would not be possible for the mind to\nrealize the form of a house in the way bricks and mortar instantiate\nsuch a form: houses provide shelter, something a mind, so understood,\ncannot do. Consequently, when claiming that minds become isomorphic\nwith their objects, Aristotle must understand the way in which minds\nbecome enformed as somehow attenuated or non-literal. Perhaps, though,\nthis should be plain enough. If a mind thinks something by being made\nlike it, then the way it is likened to what it thinks must be somehow\nrepresentational. Consequently, Aristotle is reasonably understood as\nholding that S thinks some object of thought O\nwhenever S’s mind is made like that object by representing\nsalient structural features of O by being directly isomorphic\nwith them, without, that is, by simply realizing the form of O\nin the way O does. \n\nThis approach to the nature of thinking has some promising features.\nBoth in its own terms and in virtue of its fitting into a broader\npattern of explanation, Aristotle’s hylomorphic analysis merits serious\nconsideration. At the same time, one of its virtues may appear also as\na vice. We noted in discussing Aristotle’s hylomorphic analysis of\nchange generally that his account requires the existence of suitably\ndisposed subjects of change. Only surfaces can be affected so as to be\nchanged in color. An action, such as Socrates’ becoming unnerved by a\nglance of Alcibiades, cannot be made white; it is simply not the\nappropriate sort of subject. So, hylomorphic change requires at least\nthe following two components: (i) something pre-existing to be the\npatient of the change, and (ii) that thing’s being categorially suited\nto be changed in the way specified. \n\nAlready at the first stage, however, Aristotle’s application of this\nhylomorphic analysis of change to thinking may seem an over-extension.\nFor he maintains directly that mind is “none of the things\nexisting in actuality before thinking” (De Anima iii 4,\n429a24). His reasons for maintaining this thesis are complex, but\nderive ultimately from the forms of plasticity Aristotle believes the\nmind must manifest if it is to be capable of thinking all things\n(De Anima iii 4, 429a18). Now, if the mind is indeed nothing\nin actuality before thinking, it is hard to understand how the\nhylomorphic analysis of change and affection could be brought to bear\nin this arena. If some dough is made cookie-shaped, it is actually\ndough before being so enformed; even the sense organs, when made like\ntheir objects, are actually existing organs before being affected by\nthe objects of perception. So, given a conception of mind as not\nexisting in actuality before thinking, it is hard to appreciate how\nthinking lends itself to an analysis in terms of any recognizable\nhylomorphic approach to change. \n\nHow great a problem this will be depends in part upon how entrenched\nAristotle’s commitment to the mind’s being nothing in actuality before\nthinking turns out to be. It equally turns on how adaptable Aristotle’s\nhylomorphic account of change proves to be. On this latter point,\nAristotle notes that according to his account, there are various\ndifferent types of change and alteration, illustrated by the difference\nbetween a brown fence’s being painted white and a builder’s taking up\nhis tools and beginning to build. In the first case, there is a\ndestruction and a loss, of the fence’s original color; in the second\ncase, nothing is destroyed, but rather that which is already\ndispositionally F becomes occurrently F by engaging in\nsome F-ish activity. A builder is as such already able to\nbuild. When he begins building he becomes fully and actually a builder\nfor the duration of his working. In this way, he loses nothing, but\ninstead realizes an already established potential. \n\nThis second type of change, which Aristotle maintains is the\nappropriate model for many psychic activities, is either “not an\ninstance of alteration … or is a different kind of\nalteration,” where one “should not speak of being affected,\nunless <one allows that> there are two kinds of alteration”\n(De Anima ii 5, 417b6–16). Perhaps Aristotle’s position will\nthen be that the mind, at least insofar as its cognitive capacities for\nthought are concerned, is simply such as to be enformed by any of an\ninfinite range of objects of thought. This would involve its being\nnothing determinate in itself; and far from being anomalous for\nAristotle, the mind would be in the cognitive realm precisely what the\nmost basic stuff, if there is a most basic stuff, would be in the\nmaterial realm. Both would manifest unconstrained plasticity; and so\neach would be characterized essentially in terms of their range of\npotentialities. \n\nIn both perception and thinking, animal souls are in some ways\nactive and in some ways passive. Although both mind and the sensory\nfaculty receive their correlative forms when perceiving or thinking,\nneither is wholly passive in its defining activity. Perception involves\ndiscrimination, while thinking involves selective attending and\nabstraction, both activities, in the sense that each requires more than\nmere passive receptivity. Still, the sorts of activity required for\ncognition and perception do not explain in any obvious way another\ncentral fact about human beings and other animals: animals propel\nthemselves through space in pursuit of objects they desire. Even in his\nfirst characterizations of soul in De Anima, Aristotle is\nalive to the widely held conviction that the soul is implicated in\nmotion (De Animai 2, 405b11; i 5 409b19–24). Of course, this\nis a natural connection for him to make, given that every animate\nbeing, that is, every being with a soul, has within it a principle of\nmotion and rest. So, it seems deeply characteristic of living systems\nthat they are able to move themselves in ways likely to result in their\nsurvival and flourishing. Animals move themselves, however, in a\ndistinctive way: animals desire things, with the result that\ndesire is centrally implicated in all manner of animal action. Why did\nostrich run from the tiger? Because, one says easily, it desired to\nsurvive and so engaged in avoidance behavior. Why did the human being\ndrive to the opera and sit quietly in her seat? Because, it seems, she\ndesired to hear the music and to observe the spectacle. \n\nIn these, as in countless other cases, the explanation of animal\naction, human and non-human alike, easily and unreflectively appeals to\ndesire. This is why Aristotle does not end his De Anima with a\ndiscussion of mind. Instead, after discussing mind, he notes that all\nanimals are capable of locomotion, only to deny that any one of the\nfaculties of the soul so far considered (viz. nutrition, perception, or\nmind) can account for desire-initiated movement. Although he had\ninitially identified only these three faculties of soul (De\nAnima ii 2, 413b12), Aristotle now notes that something must\nexplain the fact that animals engage in goal-directed behavior in order\nto achieve their conscious and unconscious goals. The wanted\nexplanation cannot, he urges, be found somehow in the nutritive\nfaculty, since plants, as living beings, have that power of soul, but\ndo not move themselves around in pursuit of their goals; nor is it due\nto perception, since even some animals have this faculty without ever\nmoving themselves at all, in any way (Aristotle evidently has in mind\nsponges, oysters, and certain testacea, Historia Animalium i\n1, 487b6–9; viii 1 588b12; Partibus Animalium iv 5, 681b34,\n683c8); nor again can it be a product of mind, since insofar as it is\ncontemplative, mind does not focus upon objects likely to issue in\ndirectives for action, and insofar as it does commend action, mind is\nnot of itself sufficient to engender motion, but instead relies upon\nappetite (De Anima iii 9, 432b14–33a5). Indeed, using the same\nform of reasoning, that a faculty cannot account for purposive action\nif its activity is insufficient to initiate motion, Aristotle initially\nconcludes that even desire itself (orexis) cannot be\nresponsible for action. After all, continent people, unlike those who\nare completely and virtuously moderate, have depraved desires but do\nnot, precisely because they are continent, ever act upon them (De\nAnima iii 9 433a6–8; cf. Nicomachean Ethics i 13,\n1102b26). So their desires are insufficient for action. Consequently,\nhe concludes, desire alone, considered as a single faculty, cannot\nexplain purposive action, at least not completely. \n\nUltimately, though, Aristotle does come to the conclusion that there\nis a faculty of desire (orektikon) whose occupation it is to\ninitiate animal motion. (Perhaps his initial reservations pertained\nonly to one species of desire considered in isolation.) In any case, he\nsays plainly: “It is manifest, therefore, that what is called\ndesire is the sort of faculty in the soul which initiates\nmovement” (De Anima iii 10, 433a31–b1). He understands\nthis conclusion, however, in tandem with another which also serves as a\nqualification of his earlier finding that mind cannot be the source of\nmotion. He holds, in fact, that it is reasonable to posit two faculties\nimplicated in animal movement: desire and practical reason (De\nAnima iii 10, 433a17–19), though they do not work in isolation\nfrom one another. Rather, practical reason, broadly construed to\nincorporate the kind of image-processing present in non-human animals,\nis a source of movement when it focuses upon an object of desire as\nsomething desirable. So, practical reason and desire act corporately as\nthe sources of purposive motion in all animals, both human and\nnon-human (De Anima iii 10, 433a9–16), even though,\nultimately, it is desire whose objects prick practical intellect and\nset it in motion (De Anima iii 10, 433a17–2). For this reason,\nAristotle concludes, there is a faculty of desire whose activities and\nobjects are primarily, if not autonomously or discretely, responsible\nfor initiating end-directed motion in animals. What animals seek in\naction is some object of desire which is or seems to them to be\ngood. \n\nAristotle displays some hesitation in his discussion of desire and\nits relation to practical reason in the aetiology of animal action.\nSome have consequently concluded that his treatment can be regarded as\nat best inchoate or, worse, as positively befuddled. There seem to be\nno grounds for any such harsh assessment, however. Equally likely is\nthat Aristotle is simply sensitive to the complexities involved in any\napproach to the intertwining issues in the philosophy of action. Unlike\nsome later Humeans, he evidently appreciates that the data and\nphenomena in this domain are unstable, wobbling and retreating at the\napproach of taxonomizing theory. The antecedents of action, he rightly\nconcludes, involve some sort of faculty of desire; but he is reluctant\nto conclude that desire is the sole or sufficient faculty implicated in\nthe explanation of purposive behavior. In some way, he concludes,\npractical reason and imagination have indispensable roles to play as\nwell.","contact.mail":"Christopher.Shields@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
