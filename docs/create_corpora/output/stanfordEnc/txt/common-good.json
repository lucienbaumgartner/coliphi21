Some canonical\nexamples of the common good in a modern liberal democracy include: the\nroad system; public parks; police protection and public safety; courts\nand the judicial system; public schools; museums and cultural\ninstitutions; public transportation; civil liberties, such as the\nfreedom of speech and the freedom of association; the system of\nproperty; clean air and clean water; and national defense. The term\nitself may refer either to the interests that members have in common\nor to the facilities that serve common interests. For example, people\nmay say, “the new public library will serve the common\ngood” or “the public library is part of the common\ngood”.\n\n\nAs a philosophical concept, the common good is best understood as part\nof an encompassing model for practical reasoning among the members of\na political community. The model takes for granted that citizens stand\nin a “political” or “civic” relationship with\none another and that this relationship requires them to create and\nmaintain certain facilities on the grounds that these facilities serve\ncertain common interests. The relevant facilities and interests\ntogether constitute the common good and serve as a shared standpoint\nfor political\n deliberation.[1]\n When citizens face various questions about legislation, public policy\nor social responsibility, they resolve these questions by appeal to a\nconception of the relevant facilities and the relevant interests. That\nis, they argue about what facilities have a special claim on their\nattention, how they should expand, contract or maintain existing\nfacilities, and what facilities they should design and build in the\nfuture.\n\n\nThe common good is an important concept in political philosophy\nbecause it plays a central role in philosophical reflection about the\npublic and private dimensions of social life. Let’s say that\n“public life” in a political community consists of a\nshared effort among members to maintain certain facilities for the\nsake of common interests. “Private life” consists of each\nmember’s pursuit of a distinct set of personal projects. As\nmembers of a political community, we are each involved in our\ncommunity’s public life and in our own private lives, and this\nraises an array of questions about the nature and scope of each of\nthese enterprises. For example, when are we supposed to make decisions\nbased on the common good? Most of us would agree that we are required\nto do so when we act as legislators or civil servants. But what about\nas journalists, corporate executives or consumers? More fundamentally,\nwhy should we care about the common good? What would be wrong with a\ncommunity whose members withdraw from public life and focus\nexclusively on their own private lives? These are some of the\nquestions that motivate philosophical discussions of the common\ngood.\n\n\nThis article reviews the philosophical literature, covering various\npoints of agreement among traditional conceptions of the common good,\nsuch as those favored by Plato, Aristotle, John Locke,\nJ.J. Rousseau, Adam Smith, G.W.F. Hegel, John Rawls and Michael Walzer. It also\ncovers some important disagreements, especially the disagreement\nbetween “communal” and “distributive” views.\nIt concludes by considering three important topics in the literature:\ndemocracy, communal sharing, and competitive markets. In order to\nunderstand the issues, it is helpful to start by distinguishing the\ncommon good from various notions of the good that play a prominent\nrole in welfare economics and welfare consequentialist accounts of\npolitical morality.\n\n\n\n\nThe common good belongs to a family of concepts that relate to\ngoodness rather than rightness (Sidgwick 1874). What makes the common\ngood different from other concepts in this family is that it is a\nnotion of the good that is understood to be internal to the\nrequirements of a social relationship. In any community, the common\ngood consists of the facilities and interests that members have a\nspecial obligation to care about in virtue of the fact that they stand\nin a certain relationship with one another. In a family, for instance,\nthe family home is part of the common good because the familial bond\nrequires members to take care of the home as part of a shared effort\nto care for one another’s interests in shelter and safety. In a\nuniversity, the climate of academic freedom on campus is part of the\ncommon good because the special relationship among members of the\nuniversity community requires them to care for this climate as part of\na shared effort to care for one another’s interests in teaching,\nlearning and inquiring. \nThe common good differs from the various notions of the good that play\na foundational role in welfare consequentialist accounts of political\nmorality. Among the notions in the latter category, we can include:\nthe sum of pleasure over pain, total satisfaction of rational desire,\naggregate welfare adjusted for distributive considerations, welfare\nprioritarianism, equality of welfare (in certain formulations), Pareto\noptimality, and so on. Unlike the common good, these notions make no\nessential reference to the requirements of a social relationship. They\nset out fully independent standards for the goodness of actions,\nmotivations and states of affairs, and the independent character of\nthese standards allows them to serve as foundational elements in a\nnormative theory that has a consequentialist\n structure.[2] \nAccording to classical utilitarianism, for example, the correct course\nof action is the optimal course of action as judged from the\nstandpoint of an impartial concern for the pleasures and pains of all\nsentient creatures (Sidgwick 1874). Suppose that a relationship\nconsists of a set of requirements for how people who stand in the\nrelationship should act towards one another—e.g., parents should\nfeed their children, parents should clothe their children, children\nshould defer to their parents’ judgment, etc. According to\nclassical utilitarianism, an agent should perform the action that\nsatisfies the requirements of a relationship only when her doing so\nwould result in the greatest sum of pleasure over pain. The notion of\nthe good here—i.e., the sum of pleasure over pain—is\ndefined independently of the requirements of any relationship, so it\nsets out a criterion for goodness that can tell us, among other\nthings, when it would be good for people to comply with any particular\nrelational requirements. \nSome welfare consequentialist notions of the good incorporate a\ndistributive element—e.g., welfare prioritarianism—and\nthis feature may make it more plausible to see these notions as\ninternal to the requirements of a relationship. For example, some may\nthink that welfare prioritarianism could be internal to the family\nrelationship, where the relationship is understood to require family\nmembers to perform the action that is optimal from the standpoint of\nthe worst off member of the group. But keep in mind that even more\ndistributionally sensitive notions of the good, such as welfare\nprioritarianism, retain other features of a consequentialist\nunderstanding of goodness that make it difficult to see how these\nnotions could be internal to a relationship in the relevant sense. \nTake agent neutrality. Insofar as welfare prioritarianism is a\ngenuinely consequentialist notion, it says that the correct course of\naction is the course of action that is optimal as judged from a\nstandpoint that does not change with the position of the agent or the\nrelationships that the agent happens to stand in (Williams 1973; Nagel\n1986; cf. Sen 1993). Understood in this way, welfare prioritarianism\ndoes not require an agent to perform the action that is optimal from\nthe standpoint of the worst off member of her own\nfamily. Instead, it requires an agent to perform the action that is\noptimal from the agent neutral standpoint of, say, the welfare of the\nworst off person in the world or the average welfare of all those in\nthe class of people who are worst off in their respective families. If\npeople have reason to pay special attention to the worst off member of\ntheir own families, on this view, it is because a pattern of reasoning\nalong these lines leads to the highest level of welfare for the worst\noff person in the world or the highest average welfare for those in\nthe relevant class. \nBecause it is an agent neutral notion, welfare prioritarianism may\nrequire parents to harm their own children if circumstances arise such\nthat doing so would bring about the best result from the standpoint of\nthe welfare of the worst off person in the world or the average\nwelfare of those in the relevant class. A parent might be required to\nact this way, even when lowering the welfare of her own child would\nlead to only a slightly higher level of welfare for the other people\naffected. These implications are clearly at odds with our ordinary\nunderstanding of the agent relative character of relational\nrequirements. \nThe upshot is that welfare consequentialist accounts of political\nmorality are not based, at the most fundamental level, on conceptions\nof the common good. They are based instead on notions of the good that\nare understood to be prior to and independent of any social\nrelationship. Nonetheless, it is worth stressing that a welfare\nconsequentialist account of political morality may incorporate a\nconception of the common good as part of a more specific account of\nthe ethical obligations of citizens in public life. After all, a\ncertain pattern of agent relative motivation among citizens may be the\noptimal pattern as judged from the standpoint of aggregate welfare (or\nsome other suitably agent neutral perspective). John Stuart Mill sets\nout a theory along these lines in Considerations on Representative\nGovernment (1862). On his view, citizens should take an active\ninterest in the public affairs of their community and social\ninstitutions should be designed to generate this pattern of motivation\namong citizens. The reason for this is that an orientation among\ncitizens towards the common affairs of their community is part of\nthe best political arrangement overall, as judged from the standpoint\nof the principle of\n utility.[3] \nAnother important contrast to draw is between the common good and a\npublic good. In economic theory, a public good is a particular type of\ngood that members of a community would not possess if they were each\nmotivated only by their own\n self-interest.[4]\n Here is an example. Imagine that the residents in a town could enjoy\na mosquito free summer if most every resident treats her lawn with a\nbug spray. The spray costs money, but every resident would be better\noff having paid for the spray and enjoying life without mosquitoes. If\nmost every resident sprays her lawn, everyone in the town will enjoy\nthe benefit, even those residents who do not spray their lawns. But\nthere is no feasible way to exclude the nonsprayers from enjoying the\nbenefit. \nThe problem posed by a public good is that the optimal course of\naction for each individual, from the standpoint of her egoistic\nrationality, is for her not to contribute to the provision of the\ngood, even though everyone would be better off if they all did so (see\nOlson 1965). Take any resident in the town I just described. From the\nstandpoint of her own self-interest, she should not spray her lawn: If\nthe other residents spray their lawns, she would get the benefit\nwithout paying the cost. And if the other residents do not spray their\nlawns, she would save herself the cost of spraying her lawn. It\nfollows that as long as residents are moved only by their own\nself-interest, they will not produce the good of a mosquito free\nsummer. \nIn both academic and nonacademic discussions, people often confuse the\ncommon good with a public good or a set of public goods. But it is\nimportant to keep the two ideas distinct. The facilities that make up\nthe common good resemble public goods because they are often\nfacilities that are supposed to be open and available to everyone\n(e.g., a public library). This means that it is not possible to\nexclude those who do not contribute from enjoying the benefits.\nNonetheless, the facilities that make up the common good are\nconceptually different from public goods because these facilities may\nnot be a net benefit for each member of the community. The facilities\nthat make up the common good serve a special class of\ninterests that all citizens have in common, i.e., the interests that\nare the object of the civic relationship. But each citizen will have\nvarious private interests in addition to these common interests, so\nfor any particular citizen, the private interests affected by some\nfacility may be more important from the standpoint of her egoistic\nrationality than the interests that belong to the special class of\ncommon interests. As such, the facility may not be a net benefit to\nher. \nConsider the case of a public library. Suppose that a certain library\nis part of the common good in a political community because it serves\nan interest in the privileged class of common interests. Suppose the\nrelevant interest is an interest in guaranteed access to the\nstorehouse of human knowledge. Some individual X owns a\nbakery. Her bakery is profitable, but it would be even more profitable\nif people were not able to read certain cookbooks at the library and\nso could not make her carrot muffins at home. X has an interest\nin guaranteed access to the storehouse of human knowledge, but she\nalso has an interest in her bakery’s profitability. If her\nprivate interest in a muffin monopoly is more important from her\negoistic perspective than her interest in guaranteed access to the\nstorehouse of human knowledge, then she is actually worse off because\nof the public\n library.[5]\n In this case, the public library is part of\nthe common good, but it is not a public good because there is someone\nin the community who is worse off in virtue of the library’s\nexistence. \nBefore moving on, note that people sometimes use “the\npublic good” to refer to something other than the technical\nnotion of a public good in economic theory. In academic and\nnonacademic discussions, people sometimes use “the public\ngood” in a way that is more or less synonymous with “the\ncommon good”. This use of the term was especially prevalent\namong political philosophers, roughly from the 16th century\nto the 19th century. For example, in the Second Treatise of\nGovernment (1698), John Locke defines political\npower as the right to make binding laws and the right to mobilize the\ncommunity in defense of these laws, where both of these powers are\n \nto be directed to no other end, but the Peace,\nSafety, and publick good of the People. (1698 [1988:\n353]).  \nHere Locke uses the term “public good” to refer to\ninterests that are common to all members of a political community\n(e.g., the interest in bodily security and property), where members\nhave a relational obligation to care for these common interests. The\n“public good” in this sense basically refers to the common\ngood, though philosophers who use the term “public good”\ntypically favor a thinner conception of the political relationship and\na more limited view of the powers of government. \nWhy does political philosophy need the concept of the common good?\nWhat’s the rationale for having this concept in addition to\nother concepts, such as welfare, justice, or human rights? To\nunderstand the importance of the common good, it is helpful to think\nabout the moral defects in a private society. \nA private society is a society whose members care only about\ntheir lives as private individuals (Tocqueville 1835–1840; Hegel\n1821; Rawls 1971; see also Dewey 1927). Members are not necessarily\nrational egoists—they may care about their family and friends.\nWhat is central is that their motivational horizons do not extend\nbeyond the people and projects that are the focus of their personal\n lives.[6]\n As an individual in a private society, I might be interested in\nacquiring a better home for my family or improving the local school\nfor my children and the other children in my neighborhood. I might\neven vote in national elections insofar as the results could affect my\nhome or my local school. But I take no interest in national elections\ninsofar as the results affect citizens I don’t know, those in\nother states or provinces. And I take no interest in national\nelections insofar as the results affect the basic fairness of my\nsociety’s laws and institutions. Having withdrawn into private\nlife, I care about the common affairs of the community only insofar as\nthese touch my private world. \nMany philosophers believe that there is something morally defective\nabout a private society. One type of defect bears especially on the\ncase of a private society that consists of rational egoists. As I\nnoted in the last section, a community of rational egoists will not\nperform the actions necessary to generate public goods. Since these\ngoods are desirable, the absence of public goods may be suboptimal,\nboth from the standpoint of aggregate welfare and from the standpoint\nof each member’s egoistic\n rationality.[7]\n So there are good instrumental reasons for people to create a public\nagency—i.e., a state—that can use taxes, subsidies and\ncoercive threats to draw people into mutually beneficial patterns of\n cooperation.[8] \nThe common good, however, points to a different kind of defect in a\nprivate society. The defect in this case extends to all forms of\nprivate society, not just to a society of rational egoists, and the\ndefect is noninstrumental. The defect in this case is that the members\nof a political community have a relational obligation to care\nabout their common affairs, so the fact that they are exclusively\nconcerned with their private lives is itself a moral defect in the\ncommunity, whether or not this pattern of concern leads to a suboptimal outcome. \nTo appreciate the point, think about the various public roles that\npeople may occupy in a liberal democracy (see Hegel 1821; Dewey 1927;\nJ. Cohen 2010: 54–58). Most obviously, citizens act in a public\ncapacity when they occupy positions as legislators, civil servants,\njudges, prosecutors, jurors, police officers, soldiers, school\nteachers, and so on. They also act in a public capacity when they\nparticipate in the political process, voting in elections and taking\npart in policy discussions in the public sphere (Habermas 1992; Mill\n1862; Rawls 1993 [2005]). And\nmany philosophers argue that citizens act in a public\ncapacity—or at least in a partly public capacity—when they\nact as executives in large business enterprises (McMahon 2013;\nChristiano 2010); as high-ranking officials in colleges and\nuniversities (Scanlon 2003); as journalists, lawyers, and academics\n(Habermas 1992, e.g., [1996: 373–9]); as protesters engaged in\ncivil disobedience (Rawls 1971); and as socially conscious consumers\n(Hussain 2012). \nWhen citizens occupy public roles, political morality requires them to\nthink and act differently than they would if they were acting as\nprivate individuals. If you are a judge in a criminal trial, you might\nstand to benefit personally if the defendant were found guilty. But\npolitical morality does not allow you to decide cases as if you were a\nprivate individual, looking to advance your own private objectives. As\na judge, you are required to make decisions based on the evidence\npresented at trial and the standards set out in the law. These legal\nstandards themselves are supposed to answer to common interests. So,\nin effect, political morality directs you to think and act from the\nstandpoint of a shared concern for common interests. \nCitizens who occupy public roles may also be required to make personal\nsacrifices. Consider an historical example. During the Watergate\nscandal, President Richard Nixon ordered the Attorney General of the\nUnited States, Elliot Richardson, to fire the Watergate special\nprosecutor in order to stop an investigation into Nixon’s abuses\nof power. Rather than carry out Nixon’s order, Richardson\nresigned his position. Many would argue that Richardson did the right\nthing, and that, in fact, he had an obligation to refuse Nixon’s\norder, even if this resulted in a significant setback to his career.\nAs Attorney General, Richardson had an obligation to uphold the rule\nof law in the United States, a practice that serves common interests,\neven if this meant significant sacrifices in terms of his career\naspirations. \nNow consider the following possibility. Imagine that we are living in\na liberal democracy with a full array of social roles in which people\nact in a public capacity. But imagine that our society is a private\nsociety: citizens care only about their own private affairs. In order\nto ensure that various public roles are filled, our institutions\ncreate private incentives for people to take on these\nresponsibilities. High salaries draw people into positions as judges\nand legislators, and mutual surveillance gives these people private\nincentives to carry out their duties. Suppose that our institutions\nare well structured and private incentives are adequate to fill all of\nthe important public positions. Is there anything missing in our\nsociety? Does our society suffer from a moral defect of some kind? \nPhilosophers in the common good tradition believe that the answer is\nyes: there is something morally significant that is missing from our\nsociety. What is missing is a genuine concern for the common\ngood. No one in our society actually cares about shared\nfacilities, such as the rule of law, or the common interests that\nthese facilities serve. Citizens fill various public roles simply for\nthe sake of the private benefits that they get from doing so.\nAccording to a common good conception of political morality, this lack\nof concern for the common good is itself a moral defect in a political\ncommunity, even if private incentives lead people to fill all of the\nrelevant positions. \nA central challenge for theorists in the common good tradition is to\nexplain why a genuine commitment to the common good matters. Why\nshould it matter whether citizens actually care about the common good?\nSome philosophers in the tradition cite a practical problem. Even in a\nwell-designed arrangement, circumstances are likely to arise where\nsocial institutions do not provide people with an adequate private\nincentive to act in a publicly oriented way. For example, political\nmorality may require public officials to stand up for the rule of law,\neven in situations where this will damage their careers. Or political\nmorality may require citizens to protest against an unjust law, even\nif this means a private risk of being jailed or blacklisted. Political\nmorality may even require citizens to run the risk of losing their\nlives in order to defend the constitutional order against a foreign\nthreat (see Walzer 1970; Rousseau 1762b [1997: 63–4]). In each\nof these cases, no matter how well designed institutions are, citizens\nmay not have an adequate private incentive to do what political\nmorality requires, so a genuine concern for the common good may be\nessential. \nA different explanation—perhaps the most important one in the\ncommon good tradition—stresses the idea of a social\nrelationship. Think of the relationship between parents and their\nchildren. This relationship requires not only that the people involved\nact in certain ways towards one another, but also that they\ncare about one another in certain ways. For instance, parents\nare required not only to feed and clothe their children, perhaps to\navoid getting fined by the Department of Child and Family Services.\nParents are also required to care about their children: they must give\ntheir children’s interests a certain status in their practical\nreasoning. Many philosophers argue that our relation to our fellow\ncitizens has similar features. The political bond requires not only\nthat we act in certain ways, but also that we give the interests of\nour fellow citizens a certain status in our practical reasoning. It\nwould be unacceptable, on this view, for citizens to fulfill certain\npublic roles purely for the sake of private incentives. A Supreme\nCourt justice, for example, must care about the rule of law and the\ncommon interests that this practice serves. If she were making\nconsistent rulings just to cash her paycheck every two weeks, she\nwould not be responding in the right way to her fellow citizens, who\nact for the sake of common interests in doing things such as voting,\nfollowing the law, and standing ready to defend the constitutional\n order.[9] \nMany philosophers believe that there is something morally defective\nabout a private society, even one in which private incentives move\npeople to fill all of the important public roles. A conception of the\ncommon good provides us with an account of what is missing from the\npractical reasoning of citizens in a private society, and it connects\nthis with a wider view about the relational obligations that require\ncitizens to reason in these ways. \nAccording to a common good conception of political morality, members\nof a political community stand in a social relationship with one\nanother. This relationship is not as intimate as the relationship\namong family members or the members of a church. But it is a genuine\nsocial relationship nonetheless, and it requires members not only to\nact in certain ways, but also to give one another’s interests a\ncertain status in their practical reasoning. This basic outlook leads most\nconceptions of the common good to share certain features. \nThe first feature that most conceptions share is\nthat they describe a pattern of practical reasoning that is meant to\nbe realized in the actual thought processes of the members of a\npolitical community. A conception of the common good is not just a\ncriterion for correct action, such that citizens would satisfy the\nconception so long as they performed the correct action, regardless of\ntheir subjective reasons for doing so. The point of a conception of\nthe common good is to define a pattern of practical reasoning, a way\nof thinking and acting that constitutes the appropriate form of mutual\nconcern among members. In order to satisfy the conception, the\nactivities of the members of the community must be organized, at some\nlevel, by thought processes that embody the relevant\n pattern.[10] \nMost conceptions of the common good identify a set of facilities that\ncitizens have a special obligation to maintain in virtue of the fact\nthat these facilities serve certain common interests. The relevant\nfacilities may be part of the natural environment (e.g., the\natmosphere, a freshwater aquifer, etc.) or human artifacts (e.g.,\nhospitals, schools, etc.). But the most important facilities in the\nliterature are social institutions and practices. For example, a\nscheme of private property exists when members of a community conform\nto rules that assign individuals certain forms of authority over\nexternal objects. Private property, as a social institution, serves a\ncommon interest of citizens in being able to assert private control\nover their physical environment, and so many conceptions include this\ninstitution as part of the common good. \nA conception of the common good will define a privileged class of\nabstract interests. Citizens are understood to have a relational\nobligation to create and maintain certain facilities because these\nfacilities serve the relevant interests. The interests in the\nprivileged class are “common” in the sense that every\ncitizen is understood to have these interests to a similar\n degree.[11]\n The interests are “abstract” in the sense that they may\nbe served by a variety of material, cultural or institutional\nfacilities. A wide variety of interests figure prominently in the\nliterature, including: the interest in taking part in the most\nchoiceworthy way of life (Aristotle Pol.\n1323a14–1325b31); the interest in bodily security and property\n(e.g., Locke 1698; Rousseau 1762b); the interest in living a\nresponsible and industrious private life (Smith 1776); the\ninterest in a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties (Rawls\n1971 and 1993); the interest in a fair opportunity to reach the more\nattractive positions in society (Rawls 1971); and the interest in\nsecurity and welfare, where these interests are understood as socially\nrecognized needs that are subject to ongoing political determination\n(Walzer 1983). \nMost conceptions of the common good define a form of practical\nreasoning that fits the model of solidarity. Many social relationships\nrequire a form of solidarity among those who stand in the\nrelationship. Solidarity here basically involves one person giving a\ncertain subset of the interests of another person a status in her\nreasoning that is analogous to the status that she gives to her own\ninterests in her reasoning (see, e.g., Aristotle NE\n1166a1–33). For example, if my friend needs a place to sleep\ntonight, friendship requires that I should offer him my couch. I have\nto do this because friendship requires that I reason about events that\naffect my friend’s basic interests as if these events were\naffecting my own basic interests in a similar way. A conception of the\ncommon good typically requires citizens to maintain certain facilities\nbecause these facilities serve certain common interests. So when\ncitizens reason as the conception requires, they effectively give the\ninterests of their fellow citizens a status in their reasoning that is\nanalogous to the status that they give to their own interests in their\nreasoning. \nAn example will make the idea more intuitive. According to Rousseau, a\nproperly ordered political community is “a form of association\nthat will defend and protect the person and goods of each associate\nwith the full common force” (1762b [1997: 49]). Citizens in this\ncommunity are united by a solidaristic form of mutual concern that is\nfocused on (among other things) their common interests in physical security and property.\nThis form of mutual concern requires each citizen to respond to an\nattack on the body or property of a fellow citizen as if this were an\nattack on her own body and property. When extended over all members,\nthis form of mutual concern requires the whole community to respond to\nan attack on any individual member as if this were an attack on every\nmember. In this sense, “the full common force” stands\nbehind each person’s physical security and property. Or, as\nRousseau sometimes puts it, “one cannot injure one of the\nmembers without attacking the body, and still less can one injure the\nbody without the members being affected” (1762b [1997:\n 52]).[12] \nA closely related feature is that most conceptions of the common good\ndo not take an aggregative view of individual interests. The\naggregative view treats the satisfaction of individuals’\ninterests as commensurable values, and it directs citizens to maximize\nthe sum of these values. Because it focuses on the aggregate, the\naggregative view may require citizens to impose a debilitating\ncondition on some of their fellow citizens when this would generate\nsufficient gains for others. \nSolidarity rules out the aggregative view. Starting with an\nappropriate view of her own interests, solidarity requires each\ncitizen to give certain interests of her fellow citizens a status in\nher reasoning that is similar to the status that she gives to her own\ninterests. This way of thinking does not allow citizens to abandon the\ninterests of any of their fellow citizens for the sake of aggregate\ngains. For instance, solidarity would not allow citizens to subject\nsome of their fellow citizens to slavery, even if this might produce\nsubstantial benefits for others, because enslavement would involve a\nfailure on the part of each citizen to give the interests of each of\nher enslaved comrades the right status in her reasoning. \nLet’s turn now to some of the ways that conceptions of the\ncommon good differ from each other. One way has to do with how they\ndefine the privileged class of common interests that are the object of\nthe political relationship. We can divide the important views in the\nliterature into two main categories: (a) joint activity\nconceptions and (b) private individuality conceptions.\n \nA joint activity\nconception defines the privileged class of common interests as\ninterests that members have in taking part in a complex activity that\ninvolves all or most members of the community. Among those who endorse\nthis kind of view are ancient philosophers, such as Plato\n(Republic) and Aristotle (Politics), secular natural\nlaw theorists such as John Finnis (1980), and most natural law\ntheorists in the Catholic tradition. Aspects of the joint activity\nview are also important in the work of communitarian thinkers such as\nCharles Taylor (1984) and, to a lesser extent, Michael Sandel (2009).\nThe most important and influential view is Aristotle’s. \nAristotle holds that members of a political community are not just\ninvolved in a military alliance or an especially dense network of\ncontractual agreements (Pol. 1280b29–33). Members are\nalso involved in a relationship that he describes as a form of\nfriendship (NE 1159b25–35). This friendship consists in\ncitizens wishing one another well, their being aware of the fact that\ntheir fellow citizens wish them well, and their taking part in a\nshared life that answers to this mutual concern (Pol.\n1280b29–1281a3). In caring about one another and wishing one\nanother well, what citizens care about in particular is that they and\ntheir fellow citizens live well, that is, live the most choiceworthy\nlife.[13] \nThe most choiceworthy life, on Aristotle’s view, is a pattern of\nactivity that fully engages and expresses the rational parts of human\nnature. This pattern of activity is a pattern of joint\nactivity because, like a play, it has various interdependent\nparts that can only be realized by the members of a group together.\nThe pattern is centered on an array of leisured activities that are\nvaluable in themselves, including philosophy, mathematics, art and\nmusic. But the pattern also includes the activity of coordinating the\nsocial effort to engage in leisured activities (i.e., statesmanship)\nand various supporting activities, such as the education of citizens\nand the management of resources. \nOn Aristotle’s view, a properly ordered society will have an\narray of material, cultural and institutional facilities that answer\nto the common interest of citizens in living the most choiceworthy\nlife. These facilities form an environment in which citizens can\nengage in leisured activities and in which they can perform the\nvarious coordinating and supporting activities. Some facilities that\nfigure into Aristotle’s account include: common mess halls and\ncommunal meals, which provide occasions for leisured activities\n(Pol. 1330a1–10; 1331a19–25); a communal system\nof education (Pol. 1337a20–30); common land\n(Pol. 1330a9–14); commonly owned slaves to work the\nland (Pol. 1330a30–3); a shared set of political\noffices (Pol. 1276a40–3; 1321b12–a10) and\nadministrative buildings (Pol. 1331b5–11); shared\nweapons and fortifications (Pol. 1328b6–11;\n1331a9–18); and an official system priests, temples and public\nsacrifices (Pol. 1322b17–28). \nAristotle’s account may seem distant from modern sensibilities,\nbut a good analogy for what he has in mind is the form of community\nthat we associate today with certain universities. Think of a college\nlike Princeton or Harvard. Members of the university community are\nbound together in a social relationship marked by a certain form of\nmutual concern: members care that they and their fellow members live\nwell, where living well is understood in terms of taking part in a\nflourishing university life. This way of life is organized around\nintellectual, cultural and athletic activities, such as physics, art\nhistory, lacrosse, and so on. Members work together to maintain an\narray of facilities that serve their common interest in taking part in\nthis joint activity (e.g., libraries, computer labs, dorm rooms,\nfootball fields, etc.). And we can think of public life in the\nuniversity community in terms of a form of shared practical reasoning\nthat most members engage in, which focuses on maintaining common\nfacilities for the sake of their common\ninterest.[14] \nPrivate individuality conceptions offer a different account of the\nprivileged class of common interests. According to these views,\nmembers of a political community have a relational obligation to care\nabout their common interest in being able to lead lives as private\nindividuals. Citizens each have an interest in being able to shape\ntheir lives through their own private choices about what activities to\npursue and what associations to form. Choices are\n“private” in the relevant sense when citizens are not\nrequired to consult with anyone in making these choices and they are\nnot required to reach a decision through any form of shared\ndeliberation.[15] \nAmong the philosophers who endorse this kind\nof view are many important thinkers in the liberal tradition,\nincluding John Locke (1698), J.J. Rousseau (1762b), Adam Smith (1776),\nand G.W.F. Hegel (1821). More recent figures who endorse this kind of\nview include John Rawls (1971) and Michael Walzer (1983). \nA sophisticated example of a private individuality conception is\nRawls’s. On Rawls’s view, members of a political community\nhave a relational obligation to care for the interests attached to the\n“position of equal citizenship” which all citizens share\n(1971 [1999: 82–83]). These interests are (a) the interest in a\nfully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties and (b) the interest in\na fair opportunity to reach the more attractive positions in society.\nRawls uses the term “the common good” to refer to the sum\ntotal of social conditions that answer to the interests attached to\nthe position of equal citizenship (1971 [1999: 217]). Understood in\nthis way, the common good consists, inter alia, of: a legal\norder that provides citizens with the liberty of expression, the\nliberty of conscience and the other liberal freedoms; a democratic\nsystem of government that provides citizens with political liberties,\nsuch as the liberty to vote, hold office and participate in collective\nrule-making; a system of courts to enforce the rule of law; as well as\npolice protection and national defense to protect the basic liberties.\nThe common good also consists of legal protections for free choice of\noccupation; mass media mechanisms that gather and disperse information\nabout job possibilities; a transportation system to give people access\nto work; and a system of education (whether public or private) that\nensures conditions in which people with similar talents and\nmotivations have similar prospects, regardless of their class or\nfamily background. \nRawls’s conception has the core features of a private\nindividuality view. The facilities that answer to the common interest\nin equal liberty and fair opportunity put citizens in a position to\njoin or withdraw from various activities and associations as private\npersons who can make their own independent choices. For example, the\nliberty of conscience gives citizens the legal right to join or leave\na religious association based on their own private beliefs. They need\nnot consult with other citizens about these choices or make these\nchoices as part of a wider deliberative process that involves other\ncitizens. \nRawls’s view takes the common good to consist partly in a system\nof bodily security, private property and civil liberty. In this way,\nhis view resembles Rousseau’s, which also focuses on these\ncommon interests. Where Rawls’s view differs from\nRousseau’s is that it extends the privileged class of common\ninterests to include an interest in a wider set of basic liberties and\nan interest in a fair opportunity to reach the more attractive\npositions in society. These interests involve a more extensive array\nof institutions and social conditions, especially when it comes to\neducation, communication, and economic redistribution. But it is worth\nemphasizing that neither Rawls nor Rousseau incorporates a full\naccount of distributive justice into their conceptions of the common\ngood.[16] I\nwill say more about this in the next section. \nOne of the most important differences among different conceptions of\nthe common good has to do with how they take private and sectional\ninterests to factor into determining the relational obligations of\ncitizens. Here we can distinguish two main types of views:\n(a) communal conceptions of the common good and\n(b) distributive conceptions of the common good. \nMembers of a political community have a relational obligation to care\nfor certain interests that they have in common. A\n“communal” conception of the common good takes these\ninterests to be interests that citizens have as citizens,\nwhere the status of being a citizen and the interests attached to this\nstatus are both understood to be prior to the various\nstatuses and interests that make up each member’s identity as a\nprivate individual. When citizens engage in social deliberation about\ntheir laws and institutions, a communal conception typically directs\nthem to abstract away from their private interests and the sectional\ninterests they may have as members of one subgroup or another and to\nfocus instead on their common interests as citizens. \nFor example, imagine that citizens are considering changes to trade\nrules in their society. They may be inclined to assess proposals in\nterms of how attractive these are from the standpoint of their\nsectional interests as members of a certain profession or participants\nin a certain industry. But a communal conception of the common good\ndirects citizens to set these interests aside and assess proposals in\nterms of how well they answer to common civic interests, such as the\ninterest in national security or the interest in a productive\neconomy.[17] \nA “distributive” conception of the common good differs\nfrom a “communal” conception in that it does not direct\ncitizens to abstract away from their private and sectional interests\nin the same way. A distributive conception starts with the idea that\ncitizens belong to various groups with distinct sectional\ninterests. These interests make partly competing claims on the\nmaterial, cultural and institutional facilities in a community. The\ndistributive conception incorporates a distributive principle that\ndetermines how social facilities should answer to these sectional\ninterests, and the conception says that members have a relational\nobligation to maintain a set of facilities that answers to\neveryone’s sectional interests in the way that the distributive\nprinciple prescribes. \nAs an example of a distributive view, consider the view held by many\nphilosophers, which defines the common good in terms of Rawls’s\ndifference principle (see, e.g., J. Cohen 1996 [2009: 169–170];\nsee also  section 8 below). \nAccording to this view, we can think of citizens as belonging to\nvarious subgroups, each consisting of all those born into a certain\n“starting position” in social life. Citizens in each group\nshare certain choice-independent characteristics, such as their class\nposition at birth and their level of innate talent. Group members have\nsectional interests in better life prospects (as measured in terms of\nprimary goods), where these interests make partly competing claims on\nthe basic structure of society. The difference principle says that\nsocial institutions should answer to the interests of each group\nequally, with the caveat that institutions should incorporate whatever\ninequalities would serve to maximize the prospects of the least\nadvantaged group. Citizens are then understood to have a relational\nobligation to maintain a scheme of institutions that attends to\neveryone’s sectional interests in the way that the difference\nprinciple prescribes. \nThe disagreement between communal and distributive conceptions of the\ncommon good is perhaps the most important disagreement among different\nconceptions, and it raises some important questions about the nature\nof the political relationship. Let me make two general points. \nThe first has to do with the moral underpinnings of the communal\nview. It is helpful to think of communal accounts of the common good\nas appealing to a certain conception social life (e.g., Rousseau\n1762b; Hegel 1821; Walzer 1983). According to this conception,\ncitizens form their various private and sectional interests within the\nframework of a more fundamental effort to maintain certain social\nconditions together. The political bond is prior to their private\ninterests in a certain way, so the political relationship may\nsometimes require citizens to set their private interests aside in\norder to act collectively to maintain the relevant social conditions.\nPerhaps the clearest example of this is national\ndefense (see section 9\n below). When defending the constitutional order against a foreign\nthreat, political morality requires citizens to act collectively in\ndefense of common interests, without organizing their efforts in a way\nthat answers specifically to their competing private interests in\ndifferent levels of protection. \nAn analogy may help here. Members of a family each have distinct\ninterests as private individuals—e.g., in developing their\ntalents, pursuing relationships, cultivating career prospects, and so on. At some level,\nthe household must be organized in a way that answers to these\nprivate interests. But there are some matters where the familial\nrelationship requires members to act together in a way that sets their\ncompeting private interests aside. If the family home is on fire,\nmembers are required to save the home, without special regard for how\nresources are being deployed in ways that are more likely to save one\nmember’s room rather than another’s. In certain domains,\nmembers are supposed to act from a communal point of view that focuses\non common interests that are essential to their social bond, rather\nthan their distinct and potentially competing interests as private\nindividuals. Communal conceptions of the common good see the political\nrelationship as having a similar\n character.[18] \nThe second point is that—surprisingly—Rawls himself\nfavours a substantially communal rather than distributive conception\nof the common good. In A Theory of Justice, he does not\ndefine the common good in terms of his full conception of social\njustice. He defines it instead in terms of the “principle of\ncommon interest”. This principle assesses social institutions\nfrom the position of equal citizenship. As he says, “as far as\npossible, the basic structure should be appraised from the position of\nequal citizenship” where this position “is defined by the\nrights and liberties required by the principle of equal liberty and\nthe principle of fair equality of opportunity” (1971 [1999:\n82–83]). Rawls thinks that a wide variety of policy questions\ncan be settled by appeal to the principle of common interest,\nincluding “reasonable regulations to maintain public\norder”, “efficient measures for public health and\nsafety”, and “collective efforts for national defense in a\njust war” (1971 [1999: 83]).[19] \nSocial deliberation, on Rawls’s view, should unfold, as far as\npossible, within a framework of reasoning that focuses on interests\nthat are common to all citizens, where the difference principle enters\nthe discussion mainly when the appeal to common interests alone could\nnot properly decide an issue. But why should political deliberation\nunfold in this way? Why does Rawls think that, “as far as\npossible, the basic structure should be appraised from the position of\nequal citizenship”?  \nOne possible rationale has to do with the kind of solidarity that\ncitizens realize through their shared status as\n“citizens”. When members of a society reason in terms of\nthe principle of common interest, they set their private and sectional\ninterests aside whenever possible in order to focus on their common\ninterests as citizens. Setting their sectional interests aside (e.g.,\nas members of the least advantaged group, the second least advantaged\ngroup, the third least advantaged group, etc.), citizens treat their\nshared interests as “citizens” as being more fundamental\nthan their distinct and potentially competing interests as private\nindividuals. Each citizen effectively tells her fellow citizens,\n“What unites us is more important than what divides\nus”. Bringing the status of “citizen” to the center\nof how citizens relate to one another in public life is particularly\nimportant for Rawls because mutual recognition on the basis of this\nshared status is important to his account of how a just social order\nwill prevent envy and positional competition from undermining the\nbasic liberties (1971 [1999: 476–9]). \nA closely related idea has to do with mutuality (section\n 4.4\n and\n 4.5\nabove). When members of society reason in terms of their common\ninterests in liberty and opportunity, they assess policies from a\nstandpoint that does not distinguish between one citizen and\nanother. They each accord the interests of their fellow citizens the\nvery same status in their reasoning that they accord to their own\ninterests. When citizens do their parts in a social arrangement that\nanswers to common interests, and they do so on the grounds that the\narrangement serves common interests, citizens realize a form of\nsolidarity that is perfectly mutual: each citizen works for the\ninterests of each her fellow citizens in exactly the same way that\neach of her fellow citizens works for her interests. \nSocial cooperation on the basis of the difference principle does not\n embody the same kind of mutuality. Imagine that citizens are\nreasoning about their institutions. Starting with an arrangement that\ncreates equal prospects for those born into every starting position,\nthey consider different arrangements that would yield Pareto\nimprovements over the egalitarian\n scheme.[20]\n Citizens must now choose between different possibilities: one\narrangement would maximize the prospects for the least advantaged\ngroup; another would maximize the prospects for the second least\nadvantaged group; a third would maximize the prospects for the third\nleast advantaged group; and so on. Given these possibilities, the\ndifference principle requires citizens to choose the arrangement that\nis best from the standpoint of one group in particular—i.e.,\nthose in the least advantaged position. \nImagine now that we live in a social order that satisfies the\ndifference principle. There are certain facilities in\nsociety—say, certain educational facilities—that answer\ndistinctively to the interests of those in the least advantaged\ngroup. The resources involved could have been deployed in ways that\nwould have been better for those in the second least advantaged group,\nor the third least advantaged group, etc., so the arrangement as a\nwhole is tilted in favour of one group in particular. Because it is\ntilted in this way, the pattern of interaction lacks the property of\nperfect mutuality: each citizen does not work for the interests of\neach of her fellow citizens in exactly the same way each of her fellow\ncitizens works for her interests. Everyone works in a way that is\ndistinctively oriented towards the interests of the least\nadvantaged. \nOf course, citizens realize a form of solidarity insofar as social\ncooperation is organized in light of the difference principle; the\npoint is just that citizens realize a distinctive form of solidarity\ninsofar as social cooperation is organized in light of the principle\nof common interest. In the latter case, they realize a\nmore communal form of solidarity, as citizens set their\nprivate interests aside to focus on common interests and citizens\nattach no special significance to the distinctions between different\ngroups. A more communal form of solidarity answers better to the\nsocial dimension of the political relationship and this may be one\nreason why Rawls favors a form of public reasoning in which the\nprinciple of common interest governs “matters which concern the\ninterests of everyone and in regard to which distributive effects are\nimmaterial or irrelevant” (1971 [1999: 82–83]). \nIn the vast literature on the common good, several topics stand out as\nimportant subjects of concern. One important topic is democracy.\nDemocracy figures prominently in philosophical reflection about the\ncommon good because there is broad agreement among\nphilosophers—though by no means universal agreement!—that\na private society would be defective in terms of the way that members\nmake collective decisions. Collective decision-making in a political\ncommunity must unfold in its public life, that is, in the sphere of\ninteraction in which citizens transcend their own private concerns and\nreason from the standpoint of the common good. \nOn some accounts of democracy, citizens are not required to take up\nthe perspective of the common good. According to pluralism, for\nexample, democracy is best understood as a collective decision-making\nprocess that disperses power and influence among many different groups\nin society (see Dahl 1956 and 1989). Citizens each have their own\nprivate interests and groups of citizens with similar interests\nadvance these interests in various rule-making forums. The overall\nprocess is essentially a form of bargaining, where each group\nstrategically trades concessions with other groups in order to\nmaximize the satisfaction of their policy preferences. A properly\nordered democratic regime will maintain fair bargaining conditions,\nwhere all important groups are able to exercise a meaningful degree of\ninfluence on the collective decisions that affect their interests. But\non the pluralist view no one needs to take an interest in the common\naffairs of the community: each citizen may care only about her own\nprivate affairs, entering the public forum to advance her private\ninterests against the interests of others. \nMany philosophers criticize pluralism and other similarly privatized\nviews of democratic reasoning because these views fail to capture an\nimportant aspect of political life. As Jeremy Waldron notes, citizens\noften vote on the basis of something other than their own private\ninterests: \nPeople often vote on the basis of what they think is the general good\nof society. They are concerned about the deficit, or about abortion,\nor about Eastern Europe, in a way that reflects nothing more about\ntheir own personal interests than that they have a stake in the\nissues. Similarly, the way they vote will usually take into account\ntheir conception of the special importance of certain interests and\nliberties. (Waldron 1990 [1993: 408]) \nMany critics also contend that pluralism does not distinguish properly\nbetween the form of practical reasoning appropriate to democratic\ndecision-making and the form that is appropriate in market contexts.\nManagers in a firm may justify one business strategy over another on\nthe grounds that this strategy will improve the bottom line for the\nfirm, taking no account of how the strategy might harm competitors or\nother groups. But citizens in a democratic process are not supposed to\nreason this way: \n…it is a political convention of a democratic society to appeal\nto the common interest. No political party publicly admits to pressing\nfor legislation to the disadvantage of any recognized social group.\n(Rawls 1971 [1999: 280]) \nIf a privatized approach to democratic decision-making is morally\ndefective, what exactly is the problem? What is wrong with citizens\nassessing laws and voting on laws based on how well these will serve\ntheir private interests? \nOne prominent line of reasoning in democratic theory appeals to an epistemic\nconception of democracy (e.g., Rousseau 1762b; J. Cohen 1986).\nAccording to this view, there is an independent standard of\ncorrectness for legislation, which says that laws must serve common\ninterests. Democratic decision-making is a requirement of political\nmorality because the legislative process is more likely to generate\nlaws that meet the standard when the process is democratic. Moreover,\na democratic process is more likely to generate laws that meet the\nstandard when those taking part in the process are actually trying to\nidentify laws that meet the standard. So citizens taking part in the\ndemocratic process should assess legislative proposals in terms of how\nwell these proposals serve common interests because this is the\nbest way to identify and enact laws that are justified. \nThe other main line of reasoning in democratic theory appeals to a\ndeliberative conception of democracy (J. Cohen 1996, 2009;\nHabermas 1992; Gutman & Thompson 1996). According to Joshua\nCohen’s deliberative conception, political morality requires\ncitizens to make binding collective decisions through a process of\npublic reasoning in which citizens recognize one another as equal\nmembers of the political community (J. Cohen 1989, 1996). The process\nof public reasoning requires that each citizen should offer reasons to\nconvince others to adopt a legislative proposal, where these reasons\nare reasons that she could properly expect others to accept, given the\nfacts of reasonable pluralism. \nCohen argues that the ideal of deliberative democracy, as he\nunderstands it, provides a compelling account of the common good\norientation of democratic decision-making (1996 [2009:\n168–170]). No citizen could reasonably expect others to accept a\nlegislative proposal simply because it serves her own interests, so\nthere is a basic requirement that any legislative proposal must be\nresponsive to the interests of all citizens. Furthermore, the\nbackground idea that citizens are equal members of the political\ncommunity imposes an additional requirement. Citizens  \ncan reject, as a reason within [the] process, that some are worth less\nthan others or that the interests of one group are to count less than\nthe interests of other groups. (1996 [2009: 169])  \nThis constraint on acceptable reasons leads to a substantive\nrequirement that legislation must be consistent with a public\nunderstanding of the common good that treats people as equals in the\nrelevant sense. \nCohen cites Rawls’s difference principle as one example of a\npublic understanding of the common good that satisfies the relevant\nrequirement. \nTreating equality as a baseline, [the difference principle] requires\nthat inequalities established or sanctioned by state action must work\nto the maximal advantage of the least advantaged. That baseline [i.e.,\nequality] is a natural expression of the constraints on reasons that\nemerge from the background equal standing of citizens: it will not\ncount as a reason for a system of policy that that system benefits the\nmembers of a particular group singled out by social class or native\ntalent or any other feature that distinguishes among equal citizens.\n[…In addition, the principle] insists, roughly speaking, that\nno one be left less well off than anyone needs to be—which is\nitself a natural expression of the deliberative conception. (J. Cohen\n1996 [2009: 169–170]) \nNote that Cohen argues here for a “distributive” rather \nthan a “communal”\nconception of the common good (see\n section 7\n above). On Cohen’s view, members of a political community have a\nrelational obligation to provide one another with a set of facilities\nthat answers to everyone’s sectional interests in the way that a\ncertain distributive principle prescribes (i.e. the difference\nprinciple). This differs from a communal conception, which does not\nconceive of the relational obligation of citizens in terms of a\ndistributive principle. \nCohen is probably right that the difference principle is a natural\nexpression of the deliberative ideal against the background of an\nassumption that all citizens are equal members of the political\ncommunity. But defenders of a communal conception might argue that the\npolitical relationship among citizens has a social dimension that goes\nbeyond equal membership in the political community. Like the\nrelationship among friends or among members of a sports team, the\npolitical relationship must be understood to impose obligations on\npeople that embody relational ideals such as solidarity and\nmutuality. This means that the political relationship may require\ncitizens to reason with each other in ways that embody these\nvalues. For instance, the political relationship may require citizens\nto set their private and sectional interests aside in certain\ndeliberative contexts in order to focus on their common interests as\ncitizens. An implicit concern for social ideals such as solidarity and\nmutuality may be one reason why Rawls identifies the common good with\nthe principle of common interest and gives this principle a special\nrole to play in political reasoning. \nMany philosophers agree that citizens must transcend their private\nconcerns when they take part in the political process. But some\nphilosophers believe that there are other aspects of social life in\nwhich citizens have a relational obligation to transcend their private\nconcerns. Two especially prominent examples in the literature involve\nburden sharing and resource pooling. Michael Walzer’s discussion\nof conscription and national defense highlights several important\nissues (1983: 64–71, 78–91, 97–9, and 168–70;\nsee also Walzer 1970). \nWhen a foreign power threatens the constitutional order in a liberal\ndemocracy, political morality seems to direct citizens to defend the\norder in a particular way. Citizens must approach national defense as\na communal enterprise in which they organize themselves to achieve\na certain common level of security together through various forms of burden\nsharing and resource pooling. Burden sharing, in this case, requires\nevery member of the community to participate in some way in carrying\nthe collective burden of fighting the threat. Some citizens will do\nthe actual fighting, but others will contribute by treating the\nwounded, developing weapons, taking care of children, sending care\npackages to soldiers, rationing essential resources, and so on. \nThe moral importance of burden sharing comes out most clearly when we\nconsider certain highly privatized ways of organizing national\ndefense.  Consider, for example, a market based approach. A political\ncommunity might allow entrepreneurs to set up “protection\nagencies” that would act as firms, hiring mercenaries, buying\nweapons, and selling varying levels of protection to individual\ncitizens based on their preferences and their ability to pay (see\nNozick 1974). Even if it were possible to defend people’s\nconstitutional liberties through a mechanism of this\nkind,[21]\npolitical morality seems to rule it out. One reason is that the market\nscheme would allow citizens who are wealthy enough to buy protection\nservices for themselves, but then leave it to others to face the\nactual dangers of combat. This would violate the communal ideal that\nall citizens must share in some way in carrying the collective burden\nof defending the community (see Walzer 1983: 98–9 and 169). \nAnother problem with a highly privatized approach to national defence\nhas to do with the injured. When soldiers get injured in combat, their\ninjuries have a different moral status as compared to the injuries\nthat they might suffer if they decide to do things as private\nindividuals like ride a motorcycle or work in a circus. The difference\nis that combat injuries are not private injuries that\ncitizens must bear as private persons. Even in the case where soldiers\nvolunteer for combat, they perform a public service and we treat their\ninjuries as part of a collective burden that the community as a whole\nmust bear, e.g., by providing medical care and rehabilitation services\nto the wounded free of charge. \nThe communal ideal of public service and burden sharing might extend\nbeyond national defence to other forms of socially necessary work that\nis difficult or dangerous. \nMiners today are free citizens, but we might think of them…as\ncitizens in the service of the nation. And then we might treat them as\nif they were conscripts, not sharing their risks, but sharing the\ncosts of the remedy: research into mine safety, health care designed\nfor their immediate needs, early retirement, decent pensions, and so\non. (Walzer 1983: 170) \nA more extensive application of the communal ideal might require\ncitizens to treat the burdens associated with other occupations as\nparts of a shared social burden, including the burdens faced by police\nofficers, firefighters, teachers, day care workers, nurses, nursing\nhome workers, and so on (cf. Brennan & Jaworski 2015). \nBesides burden sharing, resource pooling is another way that citizens\nmay organize their activities in light of the common good. Many\nfacilities in a modern liberal democracy serve common interests,\nincluding the armed forces, public health services, and the education\nsystem. These facilities require material resources, and this raises\nan array of questions about how to generate these resources and\nincorporate them into the pool of assets that serve common\ninterests. \nAristotle favors an approach that works through private ownership. In\nPlato’s Republic, almost all of the resources held by\nthe guardians are held as collective assets that the guardians\nmay use for the sake of the common interest of the\n community.[22]\n Importantly, because the guardians hold almost nothing as private\nproperty, they do nothing that is analogous to the choices that a group of\nfriends might make on a camping trip to voluntarily pool their\nresources for the sake of common interests. In other words, the\nguardians do not express their concern for the members of the\ncommunity through gifts, donations or other forms of private\ncontribution. Partly for this reason, Aristotle favors an arrangement\nin which citizens have private ownership and control over assets and a\ncivic obligation to pool these assets for the sake of common interests\n(see Kraut 2002: 327–56). For example, if the community faces a\nnaval threat, wealthy citizens in Aristotle’s ideal community\nwould be responsible for building warships and contributing these\nships to the war effort. \nAristotle’s view draws attention to an important set of\nquestions in contemporary market societies. The civic obligation he\nhas in mind comes closest to our notion of private philanthropy. But\nis private philanthropy really the right way for a community to\nmaintain common facilities for the sake of common interests? In 2015,\nMark Zuckerberg, the billionaire founder of Facebook, announced that\nhe would donate 99% of his shares in the company to charitable causes,\nincluding public education (Kelly 2015). From Aristotle’s point\nof view, this reflects well on our society: our institutions put\nwealth in private hands, thereby allowing citizens to make meaningful\nchoices to pool their wealth for common interests. But many would\nargue that our arrangements are seriously defective insofar\nas they put some individuals in a position to control a private\nfortune worth over $45 billion, even if these individuals will\neventually devote these resources to common interests. Plato is on to\nsomething when he says that political solidarity requires that social\ninstitutions channel some wealth directly into the public domain. But\nPlato seems to go too far in the other direction, and this leaves us\nwith an important set of questions about when society should pool\nresources through the state and when society should pool resources\nthrough private philanthropy. \nA third important topic in philosophical reflection about the common\ngood is the market. Citizens have a relational obligation to care\nabout certain common interests, and social coordination through\nmarkets can draw citizens into a pattern of production activity and\nconsumption activity that answers to these interests. For example,\nmarkets can lead citizens to make better use of land and labor in\nsociety, thereby generating more resources for everyone to use in\npursuing their various ends. The problem is that market coordination\ninvolves a privatized form of reasoning, and the proper functioning of\nthe market may require citizens not to reason from the\nstandpoint of the common good. \nTo illustrate, suppose that a society uses markets to coordinate the\neducation of citizens (see Friedman 1962). A system of for-profit\nschools would operate as firms, hiring teachers, buying computers, and\nselling education services to the public. Parents, in turn, would act\nas consumers, buying the best education for their children at the\nlowest cost. Each citizen in this arrangement would reason from the\nstandpoint of her own private concerns: as school managers, citizens\nwould aim to maximize profits, and as parents, citizens would aim to\nget the best education for their children at the lowest cost. No one\nwould act out of a concern for the education system as a shared\nfacility that serves common interests. In fact, the market may require\ncitizens to avoid this perspective. After all, to lower costs\neffectively, school managers must not show too much concern for the\neducation of their students. And in order to improve the education of\ntheir own children, parents must not show too much concern for the\neducation of other people’s children. \nWe can divide the philosophical debate into two camps. The first camp\nsays that market society—i.e., a social order that relies\nextensively on markets to coordinate social life—is compatible\nwith the requirements of the political relationship. Theorists in this\ncamp include Adam Smith (1776), G.W.F. Hegel (1821), John Rawls\n(1971), Michael Sandel (2009) and perhaps Michael Walzer (1983). We\nmight also include deliberative democrats such as Jürgen Habermas\n(1992) and Joshua Cohen (Cohen & Sabel\n 1997).[23] \nAs an example of someone in the first camp, consider Hegel (1821) and\nhis view of the market. Hegel follows Adam Smith in thinking that the\nmarket draws citizens into a pattern of specialization that serves\ncommon interests. The market does this through prices. Each citizen\nfinds that she can do better for herself by developing her talents and\nselling her labor at the going rate, then buying the goods\nthat she needs from others. But following price signals\ninvolves a form of reasoning that is focused only on private\ninterests, not the common good. As a result, it is essential, on\nHegel’s view, that the realm of market activity must be\nintegrated into a wider political community. As members of a political\ncommunity, citizens (or at least some citizens) discuss their common\ninterests in the public sphere, vote in elections, and find their\nviews represented in legislative deliberations that shape an official\nconception of the common good. This official conception shapes the\nlaws and guides the government in managing the economy. So even if\ncitizens do not reason from the standpoint of the common good as\nmarket actors, their lives as a whole are organized by a form\nof reasoning that is focused on maintaining shared facilities\nfor the sake of common interests. \nThe other camp in the disagreement says that market society is not\ncompatible with the requirements of the political relationship.\nTheorists in this camp include Aristotle (see Pol.\n1256b39–1258a17), Rousseau (1762b), Marx (1844, 1867), and G.A.\nCohen (2009). Marx’s view provides an interesting contrast to\nHegel’s. \nMarx agrees with Hegel that members of a political community must\norganize their activities in light of a conception of the common\ngood. But he does not think that members live up to the ideal if most\nof them never actually reason from this standpoint. A political\ncommunity must be “radically democratic” in the sense that\nordinary citizens participate directly in the collective effort to\norganize social life by appeal to a conception of the common good\n(Marx 1844). What makes social coordination through markets\nproblematic is that market actors are drawn into certain patterns of\nactivity through prices, which means that they never actually reason\nwith each other in terms of the common good. On Marx’s view, a\nproperly ordered political community would move beyond this opaque\nform of social coordination: \nThe life-process of society, which is based on the process of material\nproduction, does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated\nas production by freely associated men, and is consciously regulated\nby them in accordance with a settled plan. (Marx 1867 [1967:84]). \nIn a properly ordered political community, members will transcend the\nauthoritarian mysticism of price coordination and organize their\nproduction and consumption activities through an open and transparent\nprocess of reasoning that makes explicit to everyone how their\nactivities serve common interests. \nMany contemporary issues in political philosophy revolve around\nquestions about the market and the standpoint of the common good. Most\ntheorists today hold views that fall somewhere between the two camps I\njust described: they argue for some more nuanced view about when\ncitizens are supposed to adopt a privatized perspective and when they\nmust reason from the standpoint of the common good. \nWhen it comes to corporations and corporate executives, for example,\nThomas Christiano (2010) argues for a certain kind of socially\nconscious orientation: corporate leaders must reason from the\nstandpoint of the common good at least in limiting their strategic\npursuit of private objectives in a way that is consistent with the\nbroader social objectives established by democratic\n majorities.[24]\n Joseph Heath (2014) argues for a more limited view, such that market\nactors must not take a purely privatized perspective in cases where\nexternalities and other market failures would prevent the market\nprocess from generating attractive results. A great deal of work\nremains to be done when it comes to other aspects of market life that\nmay require citizens to reason from a more socially conscious\nperspective, particularly when it comes to labor rights, political\nliberties and climate change. \nAnother important set of contemporary issues has to do with\ncompetition. Market coordination typically works through a process in\nwhich citizens compete with one another for important goods. In the\nUnited States, for instance, labor market participants compete for\njobs that substantially determine who gets access to different levels\nof income, and by extension, different levels of health care, police\nprotection, consideration in the justice system, and political\ninfluence. As citizens square off against each other, each one strives\nto secure important goods for herself, knowing that her activities\nwill—if successful—effectively deprive some other citizen\nof these same goods. In this way, labor market competition requires\ncitizens to act with an extreme form of disregard for how their\nactions affect one another’s basic interests. \nMany philosophers believe that the antagonistic structure of market\ncompetition is inconsistent with the relational obligation that\nmembers of a political community have to care about certain common\ninterests. G.A. Cohen (2009: 34–45) articulates the problem in\nterms of a “socialist principle of community” that rules\nout social arrangements that require people to view one another simply\nas obstacles that must be overcome. Hussain (forthcoming) takes a more\nmoderate view, arguing that there is a difference between a\n“friendly competition” and a “life or death\nstruggle”. The political relationship allows for a certain\ndegree of competition among citizens, but it limits how severely\ninstitutions can pit citizens against each other when it comes to\ngoods that are part of the common good, e.g., health care, education,\nand the social bases of self-respect. \nThis article has covered the main points of agreement and disagreement among\ndifferent conceptions of the common good, as well as a few central\ntopics of concern. Let me conclude by saying something about the\nrelation between the common good and social justice. \nConsider the case of friendship. Friendship is a social relationship\nthat requires those who stand in the relationship to think and act in\nways that embody a particular form of mutual concern. The relevant\nform of concern incorporates the basic requirements of\nmorality—i.e., what Scanlon (1998) calls “the morality of\nright and wrong”—as friends must not lie to each other,\nassault each other, or take unfair advantage of each other. But even\nstrangers are required to conform to these basic moral standards. What\ndistinguishes friendship is that the form of mutual concern it\ninvolves goes beyond basic morality and requires friends to maintain\ncertain patterns of conduct on the grounds that these patterns serve certain\ncommon interests. \nMembers of a political community stand in a social relationship, and\nthis relationship also requires them to think and act in ways that\nembody a certain form of mutual concern. The common good defines this\nform of concern. The common good incorporates certain basic\nrequirements of social justice, as citizens must provide one another\nwith basic rights and freedoms and they must not exploit each other.\nBut the common good goes beyond the basic requirements of justice\nbecause it requires citizens to maintain certain patterns of conduct\non the grounds that these patterns serve certain common interests. \nThe analogy with friendship should make it clear that the common good\nis distinct from, but still closely related to social justice.\nAccording to most of the major traditional views, the facilities and\ninterests that members of a political community have a relational\nobligation to care about are partly defined in terms of social\njustice. For instance, Rousseau (1762b), Hegel (1821) and Rawls (1971)\nall hold that a basic system of private property is both a requirement of\njustice and an element of the common good. Similarly, in Natural\nLaw and Natural Rights, Finnis holds that respect for human\nrights is a requirement of justice and that “the maintenance of\nhuman rights is a fundamental component of the common good”\n(1980: 218). But the common good goes beyond the requirements of\njustice because (1) it describes a pattern of inner motivation, not\njust a pattern of outer conduct and (2) it may incorporate facilities\nand interests that are not general requirements of justice. \nAll of this leaves us with some important questions. Many contemporary\nsocial issues turn on disagreements about when citizens may take up a\nprivatized perspective and when they must reason from the standpoint\nof the common good. Social justice is often silent on these issues\nbecause people could, in principle, act as justice requires, whether\nthey are moved by a scheme of private incentives or by a concern for\ncommon interests. These social issues are best understood as turning\non disagreements about the nature of the political relationship and\nthe form of mutual concern that it requires. Philosophical reflection\nhas an important role to play in shedding light on this relationship\nand what it requires of us beyond what we owe to each other as a\nmatter of justice.","contact.mail":"waheed.hussain@utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utoronto.ca"}]
