On the other face, it picks out\na kind of reason for why agents (coercees) sometimes do or refrain from\ndoing something. Coercion is typically thought to carry with it several\nimportant implications, including that it diminishes the targeted\nagent's freedom and responsibility, and that it is a (pro\ntanto) wrong and/or violation of right. Nonetheless, few believe\nthat it is always unjustified, since it seems that no society could\nfunction without some authorized uses of coercion. It helps keep the\nbloody minded and recalcitrant from harming others, and seems also to\nbe an indispensable technique in the rearing of children. A\nstate's legitimacy and sovereignty is sometimes thought to depend\non its ability to use coercion effectively and to monopolize its use\nwithin its territory against competitors, both internal and\nexternal.\n\n\n\nBecause of its usefulness and its sometimes devastating effects,\ncoercion is a matter of longstanding political and ethical concern.\nNonetheless, there has been little sustained scholarly attention to its\nnature until recently; historically, many seem to have been willing to\naccept the concept of coercion as a primitive. Since the 1970s,\nhowever, the nature and function of coercion has come in for\nsignificant philosophical discussion. This flourishing of interest may\nhave been sparked by social unrest (including efforts to suppress it)\nand the success of some mass non-violent resistance movements. Also of\nimport were tensions between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., centered on their\narsenals of nuclear weapons, by which each aimed to deter the other\nfrom disastrous behavior, including the launching of a nuclear\nfirst-strike. More recently, philosophical interest in globalization\nand terrorism have added to interest in coercion. The new found\ninterest in the topic coincides with a marked change in the way\nphilosophers have understood its nature. Though the pace of study has\nslowed somewhat since 1990, the nature of coercion and its effects\nremains a matter of dispute.\n\n\n\nSometimes the term “coercion” is used in popular speech\nwith a quite broad sense. For instance, one hears\n“coercion” used to describe social pressures (e.g., the\nneed to conform to peer expectations or to placate one's\nparents); or the constraining or manipulative effects of advertising,\none's upbringing, or the structuring of society more generally\n(e.g., the necessity of participating in a capitalist economy). It is\nalso sometimes treated as a quite general concept encompassing almost\nany sort of interpersonal infringement on one's rights. Such uses\nare not wholly foreign to philosophical discussions (see, e.g.,\nRipstein 2004). Nonetheless, the following discussion will focus on a\nnarrower sense of the term more in line with its use by major\nhistorical philosophical writers and contemporary theorists alike. This\nusage will rule out, by stipulation, such things as mere disapproval,\nemotional manipulation, or wheedling. (What is “ruled in”\nis subject to dispute, as is discussed below.) This minimal setting of\nboundaries still leaves considerable room for disagreement over how\nbest to understand coercion's workings, its preconditions, and\nits effects.\n\n\n\nHistorically, the use of coercion by powerful actors has been of great\nconcern to philosophers and legal theorists. Detailed attention to\nunderstanding the concept coercion, however, is a relatively\nrecent phenomenon. One effect of this discrepant attention is that it\nis sometimes difficult to determine what precise meaning earlier\nwriters intended in their discussions of “coercion,” as\nwell as to decide whether “coercion” captures something\ndifferent from or related to other frequently used terms, such as\nviolence, compulsion, punishment,\nforce, or interference. A brief survey of a few\nnotable thinkers suggests that coercion has commonly been understood\nas a use of a certain kind of power for the purpose of gaining\nadvantages over others (including self-protection), punishing\nnon-compliance with demands, and imposing one's will on the will of\nother agents. The kind of power needed for these functions is the sort\nthat states and other forceful or violent agents possess. One of the\nclearest, most important uses of coercion has been understood to be\nthe state's enforcement of law, either through direct uses of force or\nthrough punishments meted out to lawbreakers. The state's use of\ncoercion is thought to be licensed in particular for the sake of\npreventing private acts of violence or coercion, as well as for\npunishing the failure to keep agreements. These public uses of\ncoercion are thought justified because they make possible private\ncooperation and peaceable coexistence among people not linked by ties\nof affection or blood. \n\nAlthough one could start earlier, Aquinas offers a picture of what\nmight be regarded as the traditional, canonical understanding of\ncoercion, its importance, and consequences. Discussion of coercion\n(sometimes also described as “compulsion”) recurs in the\nSumma Theologica under several headings. In a discussion of\nnecessity and the will, he notes that when we speak of necessity, we\nmean “that which must be” (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q6\nA6). There are various ways something may be necessary. Coercion, he\nsays, is a kind of necessity in which the activities of one agent\n— the coercer — make something necessary for another\nagent.  The “necessity of coercion” is that in which\n“a thing must be, when someone is forced by some agent, so that\nhe is not able to do the contrary” (ibid.). Such\nnecessity is “altogether repugnant to the will,”\n(ibid.) meaning that what is done because of coercion is not\ndone voluntarily.  To say that something is voluntary, for Aquinas,\nimplies that it follows from or is in accord with one's inclinations;\nin contrast, coercion is linked with the notions of violence and the\ninvoluntary. \n\nFor Aquinas, the law and the government bear a special relationship to\nthe use of coercion/compulsion. In a discussion of the nature of\n(human) law, Aquinas claims that “the notion of law contains two\nthings: first, that it is a rule of human acts; secondly, that it has\ncoercive power” (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q96 A5). This power\nis identified with the ability of rulers to use force and violence\nagainst their subjects: “the governor of a city has perfect\ncoercive power: wherefore he can inflict irreparable punishments such\nas death and mutilation” (Aquinas ST, II.II Q65\nA2). The law, Aquinas suggests, must use “force and fear”\nin order to restrain those who are “found to be depraved, and\nprone to vice, and not easily amenable to words,” so that they\nwill “desist from evil-doing, and leave others in peace,”\nas well as become “habituated in this way,” and\n“virtuous” (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q95 A1). This power\nis not available for anyone to use: Aquinas argues that the coercive\nfunction should be “vested in the whole people or in some public\npersonage,” and not allowed to private parties (Aquinas,\nST, I.II Q90 A3). He does allow, however, that some parties,\nsuch as the head of a household (“an imperfect\ncommunity”), must be able to use an “imperfect coercive\npower, which is exercised by inflicting lesser punishments, for\ninstance by blows, which do not inflict irreparable harm”\n(ibid.). \n\nAquinas also supports the common view that at least some coercion\naffects the coercee's responsibility or blameworthiness for what he\ndoes as a result of coercion. He holds that one is not to be blamed\nfor things done non-voluntarily. Insofar as violence undercuts the\nvoluntariness of one's doings, as suggested above, one is not to be\nblamed for them. Violence appears able to coerce in two ways: when\nused directly against one's body (“a man may be dragged by\nforce: but it is contrary to the very notion of violence, that he be\ndragged of his own will” (Aquinas, ST, I.II Q6 A4));\nand when used in a way that disables one's will (“the will can\nsuffer violence, in so far as violence can prevent the exterior\nmembers from executing the will's command” (Aquinas,\nST, I.II Q6 A4)). Interestingly, however, the\n threat[1]\n of violence that causes one to act from fear, or to avoid that\nviolence, does not make an act involuntary, on Aquinas'\nunderstanding. So only some uses of violence to hinder another's\nactions have the effect of exempting the person targeted from blame\nfor things done as a result of\n violence.[2] \n\nThese three modern-era thinkers differ in innumerable ways in their\nphilosophical and ethical views, though they seem to hold surprisingly\nsimilar views of the nature of coercion and its role in the function\nof justice and the state. Hobbes's fame as a political theorist\nderives at least in part from the central role he gives to coercion as\na necessary part of a state's function. Noticing that many contracts\nrequire one party to perform one's obligations before the other party\nacts, Hobbes suggests that such first performance would be irrational\nif one has no means to secure the subsequent performance of one's\nbargaining partner. \n\nInterestingly, Hobbes seems to share Aquinas' view that acting\nfrom fear does not undercut the voluntariness of one's acts, as he\nfamously asserts that “covenants extorted by fear are\nvalid,” at least if it is a covenant needed to secure one's life\nand no sovereign authority prohibits the making of such a covenant\n(Hobbes 1651, Ch. 14). \n\nMore generally, the very possibility of establishing justice and\ninjustice depends on the possibility of coercing subjects to abide by\ntheir covenants. \n\nHobbes thus holds that coercion is essential to both the justification\nof and function of the state or commonwealth. In fact, it is a law of\nnature that we seek the protection of the Leviathan's coercive powers\nin order to exit the perilous conditions of the state of nature. \n\nIt is perhaps presumptuous to discuss Locke's views on\ncoercion, since he very rarely uses the term “coercion” or\nits\n variants.[3]\n But even though he seldom speaks of coercion, he believes like Hobbes\nthat the function of the state is intimately tied to its role in\nsecuring individuals against those who would kill, injure or rob\nthem. \n\nLocke, more so than Hobbes, is wary of the power of the sovereign,\nbut is less anxious about conditions in the state of nature. One reason\nfor this reversal of concern, he suggests, is that sovereigns are more\npotent oppressors than ordinary inhabitants of the state of nature, due\nto the ability of sovereigns to organize force and violence. \n\nBecause individuals cannot reasonably give up power to an unchecked\nsovereign, Locke also holds that an agent's ability to possess\nand use that power effectively depends in many ways on the rightness of\nthat agent's use of power. \n\nIn particular, Locke seems to suggest that a system of property\nrights cannot be enforced by the state if it renders others unable to\nsecure their own economic survival. One is entitled to the protection\nof what one has labored to create so long as, with respect to land and\nother natural resources, “there is enough, and as good, left in\ncommon for others” (Locke 1823 [1689], Sec. 27). This\n“Lockean proviso,” as Nozick called it (Nozick 1974, p.\n175 ff), creates a sort of baseline condition against which\nthe acceptability of any set of coercive arrangements can be judged. So\nfor Locke, more than for Hobbes, the power of the sovereign rests on\nthe consent of those governed — not only for its justification,\nbut also for its stability against revolution, about which Locke was\nclearly more sanguine than Hobbes. \n\nKant also gives considerable attention to the importance of coercion\nfor guaranteeing rights of citizens, though he says little that would\nexplain what he means by his use of the term. Kant's only\nprominent discussion of coercion occurs in his Doctrine of\n Right,[4]\n a treatise on the nature of law. Kant thinks there are two sorts of\n“incentives” to follow the law: ethical and\njuridical. The ethical (i.e., rational) incentive to follow\nthe law is the motive of duty. But since the wills of some people are\ndetermined pathologically — that is, by inclinations and\naversions, rather than by duty — there needs also to be a way to\nget such persons to follow the law as well, through such means as\naversion to punishment (Kant 1996 [1797], 20 [AK 6, 219]). Coercion\nis then a tool the law uses to get the lawless to respect the rights\nof others whether they want to or not. He associates it with the\nexecutive authority of the state's ruler, and the ruler's use of\npunishment in conformity with the law. Kant makes clear that coercion\ncounts as a hindrance to freedom, in which respect it is similar to\nall violations of a person's rights. But coercion can be used to\nprevent other rights violations, and thus may be justified on the\ngrounds that it counts as a hindrance to a hindrance to freedom.\n“Right and authorization to use coercion therefore mean one and\nthe same thing” (Kant 1996 [1797],  26 [AK 6, 232]).  \n\n Kant's views on the necessity of coercion for the existence of\nright differ from those of Hobbes and Locke, but he is in general\nsympathetic to the idea that states require the ability to use coercion\nin defense of the equal freedom of their subjects. Without such\ncoercive abilities, one can have “private right,” but that\nis no more than the rights one has in the state of nature, which are by\nno means secure. \n\nSo Kant, like Hobbes and Locke, sees it as a necessity for people to\nestablish a state with coercive powers in order to achieve justice. \n\nWith respect to his thinking about coercion, Mill is most famous for\nhis views, in On Liberty, about what coercion is not fit to\ndo: namely, be used to regulate people's behavior for their own\ngood. Like his predecessors and his mentor Jeremy Bentham, Mill\nassociates coercion with the state's powers to punish\nlawbreakers. But Mill seems in general to take a more expansive view of\nwhat coercion amounts to than did those surveyed above, appearing to\ntreat the terms “coercion” and “interference”\nas much the same thing in On Liberty. In stating the thesis of\nthat work, Mill writes, \n\nIn treating coercion expansively, Mill apparently intended to\ncapture a number of different ways in which powerful agents could\nexercise constraining power on others besides the use of force,\nviolence, and threats thereof. So, for instance, Mill suggests that the\npotency of legal penalties often resides more in the stigma they attach\nthan the actual punishments they apply. Concerning laws against\nunpopular views, Mill writes, \n\nThus Mill decries “the despotism of custom,” as a force\nseemingly more potent than that of governments, in that it is able to\nhold back whole civilizations for centuries (Mill 1909–14 [1859], Ch.\n2). \n\nBy contrast with Hobbes, Locke, or Kant, Mill recognizes that the\npower of civil institutions is frequently on a par with the power of\nthe state, and treats the potential for coercion by these other\ninstitutions as similarly a matter of concern. For instance, in\nthinking about the institution of marriage, Mill writes, \n\nAnd in looking at the circumstances of child labor in his day, he\nnoted, \n\nThus Mill's understanding of coercion appears to treat a wider\narray of powers as potential means of coercion than did earlier\nthinkers. \n\nWith the advent of analytic approaches to philosophy and law in the\n20th Century, philosophers and legal theorists began to give more\nexplicit elaboration to what “coercion” means, and how it\nrelates to other concepts. In the period prior to 1969, there were of\ncourse some differences among theorists, but there seems to be a\nmainstream view of coercion that is more or less continuous with the\nview found in Aquinas and Hobbes/Locke/Kant (and some of the views of\nBentham and Mill). This view identifies coercion with the use of force\nor violence, as well as to threats of the same. For instance, Hans\nKelsen explains the nature of law by saying, \n\nKelsen goes on to count as coercive acts such things as detaining\nthose suspected of crimes, detaining for protective custody, detaining\nof the insane, detaining in internment camps potential enemies of the\nstate, and the confiscation or destruction of property (Kelsen 1967\n[1934], 40–41). \n\nJ. R. Lucas puts a slightly different cast on a similar thought,\nemphasizing the importance of a technique by which one agent (e.g., the\nstate) can assure that its decisions are implemented. \n\n[I]mprisonment is the paradigm form of coercion.… Even if it\nwere not regarded as a penalty, it would still be effective in\nfrustrating the efforts of the recalcitrant to prevent a judicial\ndecision being implemented (Lucas 1966, 60). \n\nIf there is a single, continuous thread that runs through the\nvarious thoughts about coercion surveyed above, I believe it could be\nidentified as Lucas suggests with a concern for the ability of some\nagents to implement and enforce decisions about the activities of\nothers. With the possible exception of Mill, who allows for a greater\nrange of coercive methods than the others surveyed, this general idea\nseems to capture what one might have said was essential in the concept\nof coercion as pre-modern and modern political theorists employed it,\nby name or (in the case of Locke) by function. \n\nBeginning in 1969, a spate of short articles were published on\ncoercion. The earliest of significance was Robert Nozick's\n“Coercion.” It was followed shortly by a collection of\nessays by political philosophers published in a volume of the\nNomos series, focused on coercion (Pennock and Chapman 1972).\nThese articles were in turn followed by an outpouring of responses and\noriginal discussions of coercion that continued throughout the 1970s\nand 80s. The influence of these early discussions of coercion remains\nstrong. So it is useful to begin thinking about contemporary treatments\nof coercion by looking at how these early articles framed the\ntopic. \n\nNozick's essay was by far the most influential of these early\nworks. Besides being first, his essay established a framework for\nthinking about coercion which provided an intuitively compelling\npicture of how coercion works. Nozick analyzed coercion by offering a\nlist of necessary and sufficient conditions for judging the truth of\nthe claim that P coerces Q. Somewhat simplified, he\nargued that P coerces Q if and only if: \n\nMany theorists adopted this framework explicitly or implicitly, and\nit has influenced almost all subsequent analytic philosophical\ndiscussions of the topic. Subsequent sections will address the aspects\nof Nozick's analysis which have received the most attention and\ndebate. The remainder of this section will highlight more quickly some\nof the less noticed ways that Nozick's analysis framed subsequent\ndiscussions. In particular, it sketches out how this analysis differs\nfrom the more traditional understanding of coercion, as seen in the\nclassical political theorists above. In short, Nozick's account\ndiverges from the more traditional approach in that (1) it associates\ncoercion only with proposals (e.g., conditional\n threats[6]),\n and excludes direct uses of force or\n violence[7];\n (2) it insists that coercion takes place only\nwhen the coercee acquiesces to it; and (3) it makes coercion explicitly\ndependent on the coercee's choice to take or not take a specific\naction A, and mandates that a judgment about coercion must\nrefer to facts about the coercee's psychology, such as her\nassessment of the consequences A-ing in light of the\ncoercer's proposal. The overall effect of these differences is to\nfocus the analysis of coercion on how the coercee is affected by it,\nrather than on what the coercer does, and what is required for him to\ndo it successfully. (See Anderson 2008b.) \n\nOne significant departure from the traditional approach to coercion\nis that Nozick limits his discussion of coercion to techniques that\ninfluence or alter the will of the coercee, by altering the intentions\nor dispositions of the coercee. Such coercion usually takes the form of\na conditional threat (or sometimes a conditional offer). Though a few\nsubsequent writers, like Michael Bayles (Bayles 1972; and Gunderson\n1979, following Bayles) and Grant Lamond (Lamond 1996 and 2000), have\naccepted direct force as equally a means of\n coercion,[8]\n Nozick's restriction of the\ntopic to the use of threats — that is, coercion that operates\nthrough the will of the coercee — has been the much more\nfrequently accepted view, whether explicitly or implicitly. \n\nThere are good reasons to treat coercion via the will and direct force\nor constraint applied to the body as two methods of a single kind of\nactivity. First, though direct force is usually unsuited to get an\nagent to perform a specific action, both are well suited to preventing\nan agent from taking a variety of actions, with direct force or\nconstraint often being more decisive. Second, the two techniques are\noften used hand-in-hand. For instance, police officers will shackle\nand manhandle someone in custody who refuses to cooperate when given\ninstructions to move or stay still. Also, prison inmates are coerced\ninto remaining there by a combination of penalties for attempting\nescape along with physical obstacles that limit the feasibility of\ndoing so. So using both techniques is often part of one and the same\nactivity aimed at affecting or constraining what an agent will do\n(sometimes by affecting what she can do) (Anderson 2008a and\n2010). Of course, under direct force, it will usually be true that the\ncoercee does not act, but rather is acted upon, as H. J. McCloskey\nputs it (McCloskey 1980).  However, from the coercer's perspective,\nit may be just as well, in enforcing his decisions, to prevent the\ncoercee from acting at all as it would be to induce her to choose not\nto act. \n\nNozick's framing indicates that coercion is necessarily\nsuccessful: if the coercee does not act as demanded, then there is no\ninstance of coercion. At most, it seems, there is an instance of\nattempted coercion. One might say that Nozick builds a “success\ncondition” into his analysis of coercion. Others have disagreed\nwith the success condition, though Nozick's is apparently a\nmajority view. (Those who agree include McCloskey 1980; Gorr 1986;\nMurray and Dudrick 1995; Berman 2002; one who disagrees is Carr\n1988). The disagreement seems to be over whether to identify instances\nof coercion with one or the other of the two faces mentioned at the\noutset: that is, to identify it with a kind of behavior by the coercer\n(which may or may not be successful), or to identify it with specific\nevents in the life of the coercee (namely, those that alter or\nconstrain her activities). Several authors, picking up on the\ndisagreement, have suggested that we might distinguish coercion from\ncoerciveness, associating the former with completed, successful\nattempts, and the latter with qualities of the attempt itself (Lamond,\n2000). \n\nOf course, if the coercee defies the coercer, there is no coerced\naction to investigate, nor any question to answer about responsibility for\nsuch an action. There is also reason to doubt that what the coercer did\nin such cases rises to meet the bar at which we should consider it\ncoercive. (If a threat is trivial, we would likely resist saying that\nan agent was coerced by it even if she acts to prevent its execution.)\nOn the other hand, it may be unwise to make a categorical distinction\nbetween cases in which coercion succeeds and cases where it fails: the\ndifference between them on some occasions may be nothing more than what\nmood the coercee happened to be in at the time. Since the coercer has\nthe final and definitive say over whether he will engage in coercive\nactivity (and who will be engaged by it), it may make more sense to\nidentify our phenomenon of interest with a certain form of activity by\nthe coercer, admitting that such activity may or may not result in any\nfurther noticeable consequences. (The would-be coercer may of course be\nbluffing, and the prospective coercee may call the bluff; this would\nnot, by itself, give reason to deny that we have here an instance of\nthe technique under study.) \n\nFinally, Nozick frames his analysis with respect to some particular\naction A taken or not taken by the coercee. The connection of\ncoercion to a specific action taken or foregone has seemed natural to\nalmost all subsequent commentators, even though it raises some\nproblems of which at least Nozick himself seems to have been aware. In\nthe short detour that is the second section of his essay, Nozick poses\nquestions of the following sort: If P coerces Q into\ndoing A, and B and C are the only ways to\ndo A, does P coerce Q into doing B\n(assuming that is the means Q chose)?  Similarly, if\nP coerces Q into not doing A, and\nA is a necessary precursor to B, does P\ncoerce Q into not doing B? Does it matter whether\nQ was already aiming/hoping/expecting to do B? More\ngenerally, if as a result of prior acts of coercion by P, an\nact A is no longer possible for Q (perhaps\nQ doesn't think about it at all), has P coerced\nQ into not A-ing? Nozick broaches\nquestions of these sorts, but leaves them aside without much mention\nof their significance (See Nozick 1969, 445–47). Taken seriously,\nhowever, they would force some significant revisions to the way\ntheorists have analyzed coercion. They show that there may be\ndifficulties in identifying coercion strictly with actions taken or\nforegone, since it may be impossible to determine just what actions\nthis description includes. \n\nMore generally, Nozick's analysis emphasizes the alteration in\nthe coercee's choice of actions which results from the way the\ncoercer's proposal affects her reasons for acting. While this is\ncertainly a plausible approach for distinguishing coerced from\nuncoerced acts, it puts the focus on how the coercee perceives her\nsituation; it is only via this reflection that it takes into account\nhow the coercer is able to create this perception. That is, it leaves\nthe standard sorts of means (force, violence, perhaps even economic\ndeprivation) that coercers use out of the account, and instead treats\nall kinds of alterations to the coercee's costs and benefits to\nacting as possible indications of coercion. While this more ecumenical\napproach to coercion may succeed in encompassing ways of coercing that\nthe traditional theories would leave out, it creates a difficult\nchallenge for the theory to distinguish coercive from non-coercive\nproposals. It is not surprising, therefore, that these are the issues\nthat have been the focus of most subsequent theorizing on the\nsubject. \n\nSince Nozick's essay, theorists have frequently treated the\nmaking of a conditional threat as an essential factor in coercion. The\nlargest single effort expended in analyzing coercion has been devoted\nto making sense of such threats, and determining their relationship to\ncoercion. Some, however, have questioned the linking of coercion with\nthreats, and suggested that conditional offers too can be coercive.\nBoth conditional threats and conditional offers can be said to be\nproposals, where the distinction between them is their relationship to\nsome baseline representing the coercee's situation prior to the\nproposal: compared to the baseline, threats worsen the coercee's\nsituation, while offers do not. In this and the next two sections,\nwe'll examine some of the issues involved here. In Section 2.5\nwe'll consider some approaches to coercion that attempt to escape\nfrom a “baseline” analysis of threats and offers. \n\nMost will recognize the connection of coercion with threats as a\nmatter of common sense: armed robbers, mafias, the parents of young\nchildren, and the state all make conditional threats with the\nintention of reducing the eligibility of some actions, making other\nactions more attractive by comparison. Note, however, that offers may\nalso be made with the same general intention as coercive threats: that\nis, to make some actions more attractive, others less so. Consider the\nbasic structure of a conditional threat by P that attaches\nundesirable consequences C to some action A by\nQ: \n\nThis proposition has the same structure as an ordinary offer by\nP to do something Q desires if Q agrees to\npay for it, but not otherwise.  Conversely, any ordinary offer has the\nsame structure as a threat. This suggests that any proposal whatever\nmay be read as a threat or an offer, depending on the relationship\nbetween the proposal and some specifiable external\nfactors. (“Your money or your life” might equally be\nproposed by a back-alley robber or a pharmaceutical company; in one\ncase it's a robbery, in the other case it may be a life-saving offer.)\nThe idea that threats coerce while offers don't is frequently thought\nto be connected to the fact that threats propose to make their\nrecipient worse off than she would have been otherwise. If so, we are\nrequired to specify how we should pick out and assess the relata in\nthis comparison, which is trickier than it may at first\nappear. Consider first the question of what aspect of the proposal is\nrelevant for this comparison; and then second what relevant comparison\ncase (usually called the “baseline”) should be used. \n\nAny bi-conditional proposal can be analyzed into a conjunction of two\ncomponent simple conditionals, both of which must be true if the\nbi-conditional itself is true. However, only one of the two\nconditionals will have its antecedent satisfied (depending on what\nQ chooses to do), and will thus govern what comes about as a\nconsequence.  If the proposal is to have a motivational effect on its\nrecipient, it will be because the recipient prefers that one of the\ntwo possible consequents be realized — either that P\nbrings about C, or that P does not bring about\nC — so we may suppose that it is the difference in\nQ's valuation of these consequents that motivates (if\nanything does) Q to act in response to P's\nproposal. (If the agent is indifferent between the two states, we may\nconsider the proposal to be an offer, but too unattractive an offer to\ntempt one to accept it.) So we look to the conditional containing the\nless-preferred consequent, and compare it to the baseline in order to\nsee whether P's proposal makes Q worse off than she\nwould be in the relevant alternative state of affairs. (The following\nanalysis slightly modifies the analysis in Gorr 1986, 391–397;\nand Berman 2002, \n 55–59.[9]) \n\nSo, for instance, an armed robber issues a proposal to a passerby\nthat amounts to the following conditionals: \n\n(b) if she hands them over, he will not. \n\nThe passerby prefers the consequent in (b), so we compare the\nconditional (a) to the baseline. Normally, one faces no harm if one\nkeeps one's valuables. So the first conditional makes the\npasserby worse off than she would normally be, thus turning the\nrobber's proposal into a threat. \n\nBy contrast, consider the offer of a salesman who proposes to a\ncustomer the following: \n\n(d) if she does not pay X, he provides no vacation package. \n\nAssuming the customer would prefer having the vacation package to\nnot having the vacation package, the second conditional contains the\nless preferred consequent. But receiving no free vacation is quite\nnormal, so one is no worse off when the second conditional is operative\nthan under normal circumstances. Hence the salesman is making only an\noffer, not a threat. \n\n(Some have discussed “throffers,” which are proposals\nthat make one better off than normal under one conditional, worse off\nthan normal under the alternative conditional. On the above analysis,\nthroffers will be included among the threats because the conditional\ncontaining the less-preferred consequent makes one worse off than one\nnormally would be.) \n\nThis analysis works well enough for most purposes. Since we quite\noften know what's normal and what's not, threats and offers\nare usually easily distinguished. Difficulties arise, however, when\nthis is not the case. \n\nNozick explains the idea of the baseline by calling it the\n“normal or natural or expected course of events” (Nozick\n1969, 447). But all of these terms are ambiguous, in that they have\nnormative (or “moral”) and non-normative (e.g.,\n“predictive”) uses. Frequently, the normative and\npredictive uses will point to the same state of affairs as the course\nof events that is indicated. However, the extensions of the normative\nand non-normative uses will sometimes differ, thus requiring a theorist\nto choose one or the other in order to determine whether a particular\ncommunication counts as a threat or an offer, and is therefore coercive\nor not. \n\nNozick offers two of the best known cases in which the normative and\nnon-normative baselines would appear to diverge. Here's one of\nthem (Nozick 1969, \n 450–51):[10] \n\nQ prefers not to be beaten, so we look to the conditional \n\nSince P beats Q regularly, this conditional's\nbecoming operative makes Q no worse off than what Q\nfinds normal or expected (statistically speaking). So P's\nproposal amounts to an offer, not a threat, on this way of\nunderstanding of what's normal. Yet we would reasonably hold that if\nQ elects to escape a beating by doing A,\nQ's choice is made in response to a threat of a beating, and\nis thus coerced. \n\nThe slave case demonstrates an ambiguity in our thought about\n“what is normal” (or “what is expected”).\nAlthough the slave is typically beaten and predicts he'll be\nbeaten based on past history, we expect on moral grounds that people\nare not beaten for no reason. Given the moral sense of what is normal,\nthe slave owner's proposition amounts to a threat, thus\nvalidating our sense that the slave is coerced into doing A.\nEspecially in contexts of entrenched injustice, the “moral”\nand “predictive” baselines may diverge, forcing us to\nchoose between them. \n\nActually, any number of different possible baselines might be\nconstructed for judging whether a proposal makes one better or worse\noff than the baseline. There are different ways of making a prediction;\nthere are different “moral” standards; there are also ways\nof taking into consideration what the recipient of the proposal would\nwant. So divergences among the many possible baselines may be more\ncommon than we might at first suspect. This requires us to find a way\nto choose among the possibly diverging baselines. Nozick, for instance,\nproposes that when the “predictive” and the\n“moral” baselines diverge, we turn to the preferences of\nthe recipient of the proposal, and use the baseline he prefers. In the\nslave case above, Nozick reasonably supposes that the slave would\nprefer that “normal” meant “moral”; in which\ncase the slave would not be beaten even if he did not do A. By\ncomparison to this baseline, the slave-owner's proposal is a\nthreat, not an offer. \n\nSome theorists have noticed that what the proposal recipient wants\nto happen may differ from both the moral and predictive baselines.\nMichael Gorr, for instance, argues that if preferences are important\nwhen the baselines diverge, “it is unclear why they should be\nless so in cases where the two baselines coincide.” Hence he\nfavors an account that “makes the subject's preferences a\ncontrolling factor in all cases” (Gorr 1986,\n398–399; see also Rhodes 2000). The difficulty with this suggestion,\nhowever, is that it's very difficult to craft constraints on what\npreferences will count for how things go; people can want others to do\nor omit doing almost anything. Suppose we agree it is normal in both\nthe moral and predictive senses for workers who shirk to be fired, and\nfor customers who refuse to pay utility bills to have their electricity\ncut off. Of course, workers and customers would likely prefer to get\npaid for nothing, and to get their electricity for free. Compared to\nthese baselines, proposing to fire or to cut off electricity to someone\namounts to going out of one's way to attach undesirable\nconsequences to some (non‑)action A. On Gorr's\ncriteria, it would appear, both of these threats count as coercive\nthreats, yet both seem to be parts of ordinary, non-coercive commerce\nbased on offers and\n acceptances.[11]\n At any rate, it is difficult to see how a\nfully preference-based baseline account can avoid seeing coercion in a\nvast array of situations where our pre-theoretic views would deny\nit. \n\nThose who opt for a moralized baseline approach seem to offer a more\nplausible approach. The most prominent of these theorists has been Alan\nWertheimer, whose book Coercion sets the current standard and\nstarting point for continued scholarship in this\n area.[12]\n Since only threats coerce, but\nnot all threats do, he provides a two-pronged test for whether a\nproposal constitutes a coercive threat (Wertheimer 1987, especially\nchs. 2, 12, and 14). The proposal constitutes a threat if the\nproposer indicates that, if his demand is denied, he will make the\nrecipient worse off than the recipient ought to be. (In particular,\nWertheimer believes that this is frequently best understood as a\nquestion of whether the proposer proposes to violate the\nrecipient's rights (Wertheimer 1987,\n 217).)[13]\n Yet the mere\nfact that something threatens one is not sufficient to ground a claim\nthat it coerces anyone; the threat may be wrongful but also trivial. So\nWertheimer requires that the choice forced upon the coercee be such\nthat she has no reasonable choice but to succumb. This too requires a\ncontextually specific, moralized judgment, Wertheimer thinks. One\nmight, for instance, be supported in a claim that a threatened beating\nleft one “no choice” but to sign a contract; the same might\nnot be said about a choice to commit murder. \n\nWertheimer's approach is developed and defended by surveying\nlegal reasoning in the U.S. and its common-law tradition with respect\nto such matters as contracts, criminal responsibility, plea bargains,\nblackmail, and consent to searches and medical procedures. His work has\nbeen influential among many who have tried to determine what the law\nshould say about various coercive phenomena, and Wertheimer himself has\noffered further applications of his theories in subsequent work,\nincluding a book on consent to sexual relations (Wertheimer 2004).\nWertheimer's moralized account and moralized theories of coercion\nmore generally raise some difficulties for understanding how there\ncould be “justified coercion,” such as law enforcement, in\nthat they tend to associate uses of coercion with immoral action. Some\nof these difficulties are considered in Section 3.4 below. \n\nWhile the dominant strand in recent theory has associated coercion\nwith threats, and denied that offers can be used to coerce, this sharp\ndifferentiation of these two sorts of proposals has come in for some\ncriticism. The parallel structure of conditional threats and\nconditional offers has led some to deny that there is a deep\ndistinction to be made between them. Others have focused on the role of\nboth in the broader political and economic context, and found that\nthese broader conditions make coercive offers a live possibility.\nDealings in capitalist markets are often highly exploitative;\ngovernments often condition the provision of ordinary benefits on the\nsatisfaction of unrelated demands (such as making highway funding\nconditional on states' passing particular laws). Given the\npotency such offers possess, one might suspect that there are many\noffers that one cannot reasonably refuse, possibly reflecting great\nimbalances in power or prior historical injustices between the\nbargaining parties. (See, for instance, O'Neill 1991; and\nBerman 2001.) \n\nOf those who have argued that threats and offers can both be used\ncoercively, David Zimmerman has been most prominent (Zimmerman 1981;\nothers who have argued offers can coerce include Frankfurt 1988\n[1973]; Held 1972; Lyons 1975; Van De Veer 1979; Benditt 1979;\nFeinberg 1986; Stevens 1988; for criticism of Zimmerman, Held, and Stevens, see\nAlexander 1981; Bayles 1974; and Swanton 1989, respectively). Retaining\nthe baseline-approach to coercion found in Nozick, Zimmerman urges\nthat in setting a baseline for judging a proposal, we should take into\naccount the possibility that the proposal maker is actively hindering\nthe coercee from obtaining a situation for herself that would be\nbetter than the situation the coercer proposes. So, for instance, if a\nperson is destitute on an island, and someone proposes to employ this\nperson for a life-sustaining pittance, this proposal may count as an\noffer, since it is an improvement over the “pre-proposal”\nsituation. But if the person is destitute and unable to obtain better\nconditions only because the employer actively prevents the person from\nleaving the island (say, by preventing the building of boats),\nZimmerman suggests the offer should be regarded as coercive.  That's\nbecause the appropriate baseline for evaluating the proposal is the\nstate of affairs that the recipient would face in the absence of\nspecial interference by the proposal maker. (In the present case, this\nmight be the situation the island inhabitant would face were she able\nto build a boat and return to the mainland.) If relative to this\nbaseline the offer is less favored, then it should count as coercive,\nZimmerman thinks. \n\nDo such offers coerce? The dispute between those who say offers can\ncoerce, such as Zimmerman, and those who insist only threats coerce may\nbe more verbal than real. While Zimmerman, for instance, would label\nthe offer itself coercive, what appears to do the coercing here is\nwhatever means were or are being used to keep the recipient of the\noffer from reaching a better bargaining state. If the offering party\nhere has created the conditions that make even very unattractive offers\nstill the best available, then the coercion, if there is any, seems to\nbe vested in the offerer's actions that prevent the recipient\nfrom improving her situation or finding better offers elsewhere. \n\nZimmerman grants that even if the offering party does not cause the\nrecipient to be in the position she's in, we may still want to\ncriticize such offers. In these cases, the offer-maker may be guilty of\nengaging in exploitation, though not coercion. When one party\nis in a much stronger bargaining position than another, the stronger\nparty sometimes uses its advantage to keep for itself most or all of\nthe gains to be had from cooperative interaction between the parties.\nSo employers who are in a stronger bargaining position than their\nemployees may exploit them by paying them a small fraction of the value\ntheir labor contributes to the production of goods for the employer.\nThis is especially feasible when one party has a relative monopoly\nposition with respect to some valuable good (say, employment\nopportunities). So, reconfiguring Zimmerman's results somewhat,\nwe might retain the exclusive connection between threats and coercion\nby saying that offers made from a position of superior bargaining\nstrength are very likely to be exploitative; and that sometimes\ncoercion is used to create or maintain one's bargaining\nadvantages. \n\nNot all, however, would accept that the coerciveness of a large\ndifferential in bargaining power depends upon its causal origins. Joan\nMcGregor, for example, gives an analysis of such offers in an account\nthat eschews the baseline approach. She argues, “the\n‘better off’/‘worse off’ distinction ignores\nthe power relationships that occur when there are radically disparate\nbargaining strengths” (McGregor 1988–89, 24). To assess the\ncoerciveness of something like an economic transaction, one must\ninstead attend to the relative strengths of the bargaining positions\nbetween parties involved. “[C]oercion involves exercising power\nover another; in the market, it involves exercising superior bargaining\npower” (McGregor 1988–89, 25). At least two of the conditions\nfor having bargaining power sufficient to coerce another are that the\nweaker party is dependent in some way on the stronger party\n(e.g., there are no other options or potential exchange partners), and\nthe stronger party has influence over whether some significant\nevil occurs to the weaker party (such as loss of life, health,\nsecurity) (McGregor 1988–89, 34). If in addition the stronger party\ndecides to take advantage of these conditions, then this is not just\nexploitation but coercion. While the details of her account of\nbargaining strength may raise difficulties, her attempt to incorporate\na measure of the coercer's power into the account of coercion\nseems a useful if relatively under-explored approach. \n\nThe need to establish a baseline is generated by a need to\ndistinguish threats from offers as a central criterion of coercion.\nThreats and offers are both proposals put to the coercee, aiming to\ninfluence her behavior, and distinguished with respect to how they\naffect what is normal for the coercee. There are two main ways in which\nsome theorists have diverged from the baseline-style account that\nNozick proposed, each of these ways admitting of both moralized and\nnon-moralized versions. Instead of distinguishing threats and offers\nfrom what's normal for the agent, we might instead see threats as\napplying a special sort or degree of pressure on the coercee's\nwill. Or, we might move away from focusing on the coercee's will\nas the locus of coercion, and instead look at the powers, intentions,\nand activities of coercers. A “coercer-focused” account\nseeks to determine what is special about coercive actions, rather than\ntrying to distinguish coerced from non-coerced actions. \n\nOne way to identify coercive threats is by looking for a distinctive\nway that pressure can affect a coercee's will. Sometimes, a use\nof threats conditioned on the agent's activities may affect not\njust the coercee's choice but also her ability to choose at all.\nUnder severe psychological pressure, faced with grave dangers or\nsignificant evils, people sometimes react in ways that diverge from (or\nat least do not follow from) their more rational, considered desires.\nHarry Frankfurt seems to make this effect a requirement for something\nto count as coercive, saying “A coercive threat arouses in its\nvictim a desire — i.e. to avoid the penalty — so powerful\nthat it will move him to perform the required action whether he wants\nto perform it or considers that it would be reasonable for him to do\nso” (Frankfurt 1988 [1973], 78). Frankfurt has several reasons\nfor insisting on this strong requirement, but perhaps most central is\nhis view that coercion must have such an overbearing effect if it is to\noverride the coercee's moral responsibility for acting\n(Frankfurt 1988 [1973], 75–76). However, if one treats such\noverburdening as a sufficient condition for coercion, then this again\nlends support to the view that some offers — irresistible ones\n— will also turn out to be coercive. Though the fact that\nQ's will was overborne would seem compatible with the claim that\nQ has been coerced, few besides Frankfurt have taken such overburdening\nto be a necessary condition for coercion to take\n place.[14] \n\nShort of generating psychological compulsion, one might hold that\ncoercion involves the imposition of an option which no one could\nreasonably refuse to take. Several have tried to characterize such\nsituations in a way that neither reduces to a form of psychological\ndeterminism, nor implicitly invokes baseline comparisons. For instance,\nMark Fowler argues that “coercion generally involves the prima\nfacie immoral imposition of practical imperatives by use of\nthreats” (Fowler 1982, 330). While this approach must be\nsupplemented with further details (including, perhaps, a resort to a\nbaseline to distinguish threats from offers), its principal\ncontribution is its reliance on “practical imperatives.”\nFowler suggests that we need to see coercion in relation to our\nunderstanding of how practical reason works. When we say that the\ncoercer leaves the coercee “no choice,” we don't\nnecessarily mean that the coercee is literally unable to choose, but\nthat for the coercee to choose otherwise than the coercer demands would\nbe contrary to practical reason (Fowler 1982, 331). \n\nThe normative approach Fowler favors links this criterion to a\nKantian account of autonomy, and suggests that the test of a coercive\nthreat is that it violates the coercee's autonomy. This would\nappear to produce a mismatch between our pre-theoretic understanding of\ncoercion and the cases that will satisfy Fowler's conditions\n— for instance, giving someone a false “warning”\narguably violates her autonomy, but this seems different than coercion.\nYet if there is a way to make sense of the notion of imposing a\npractical imperative, this seems a useful element of an account of\ncoercion. \n\nJoel Feinberg identifies coercion with a special degree or kind of\npressure imposed on the coercee's will, but avoids connecting\npressure to a normative judgment. His account is tailored to cases\nwhere the coercer seeks to obtain a token of “consent” to\nsome harmful or dangerous activity from the coercee, but it could\neasily be generalized to cover other sorts of coerced activities. His\naccount starts by offering a helpful description of the role of the\ncoercer, stipulating that the coercer: \n\n“gives some evidence of the credibility of the threat”;\nand \n\n“has actively intervened in [the coercee's]\noption-network, to acquire control of the relevant option-switches; in\nparticular he can close tight the conjunctive option that consists of\n[the coercee's] noncompliance with the demand and [the\ncoercee's] avoidance of the threatened unwelcome\nconsequences” (Feinberg 1986, 198).\n [15] \n\nThese stipulations are useful supplements to the Nozickian-style\naccount, in that they require the coercer to demonstrate his power, and\nto actively use it to create the situation facing the coercee, in\nparticular by preventing the coercee from finding ways to avoid the\nforced\n choice.[16] \n\nThe bulk of Feinberg's account focuses, however, on how\ncoercive proposals can generate pressure on the coercee's will\nthat, if not irresistible, is sufficiently strong to make the\ncoercee's choice unfree. This account avoids a reliance on\nbaselines because it makes the coercee's judgment of the\nfrightfulness, unwelcomeness and pressure involved in the threat the\nkey criterion for determining whether it coerces. Feinberg goes on to\ngive a detailed discussion of how one might compare the pressures\ninvolved when coercers issue various sorts of demands coupled with\nvarious sorts of threats, suggesting ways of calculating the\n“total coercive burden” a threat creates for a coercee. \n\nFeinberg's account generates a number of apparently troubling\nresults. For one thing, it will allow that extremely tempting offers\nare coercive if they create pressure similar to that associated with\ncoercive threats; the only thing that seems to count is how much\npressure one feels to act. It will also treat people with non-standard\npreferences or fears (say, a dire fear of being patted on the back) as\nhaving been “coerced” by threats to do what are,\nobjectively speaking, trivial things (Feinberg 1986, 212). \n\nA different way of understanding coercion moves away from focusing\non its impact on the coercee. Some approaches, like McGregor's\nnoted above, look for coercion in the coercer's taking advantage\nof certain sorts of power differentials between coercer and coercee.\nOthers identify coercion with the making of threats, but seek to\ndistinguish threats from offers in ways that avoid reference to a\nbaseline, and instead look at the qualities of the coercer and his\nactivities. Mitchell Berman, following Vinit Haksar, has argued for an\napproach the crux of which holds that immoral coercive threats propose\nto do something that would be immoral to do if carried out. (See\nBerman 2002; Haksar 1976.) (Berman does not, it appears, offer a\ndefinition of coercion per se, but only of wrongful\ncoercion.) Grant Lamond focuses instead on the coercer's\nintentional attempt to use pressure to alter the activities of the\ncoercee, where that pressure comes from an intention to deliberately\nset back the interests of the coercee. (See Lamond 1996 and 2000.)\nBecause McGregor's, Berman's and Lamond's ways of\ncapturing coercion attend to the coercer's actions and\nintentions, they avoid the need to distinguish coercive from other\nproposals based on specific effects on the coercee. (For that reason,\nthey could also reject the “success” condition on coercion\nfound in Nozick's and most subsequent accounts of coercion.) \n\nScott Anderson, drawing upon some remarks of J. R. Lucas (1966), takes\na different tack, and associates coercion with the use of an ability\nsome agents have to enforce their decisions about what another will or\nwill not do, “where the sense of enforceability here is\nexemplified by the use of force, violence and the threats thereof to\nconstrain, disable, harm or undermine an agent's ability to act”\n(Anderson 2010,  6).  Anderson requires that the coercer engage in\nactivity either to create a power differential between himself and the\ncoercee (say, by taking up arms), or else draw upon some existing\ndifferential between agents of the sorts to which coercer and coercee\nbelong (say, policeman and citizen, respectively).  This\n“enforcement approach” suggests that uses of these sorts\nof powers are distinctive, and thus can be used to pick out\nlong-standing threats (such as the criminal law) as coercive, even if\nit is difficult to identify specific actions that they alter. \n\nAlthough some writings on coercion might appear to aim principally\nfor conceptual clarification, theorists of coercion more often aim to\nanswer questions that have practical import for ethics, judicial\ndecisions, political or legal theory, and social policy. Some of the\nmost common implications of claims about coercion are explored below.\nThe four subsections here (on responsibility under coercion, the\nwrongfulness of coercion, its effect on freedom, and its political\nimplications) overlap in a number of ways, so divisions among these\nsections are somewhat artificial. The divisions here foreground one or\nanother aspect of the topic at a time, but do not indicate that these\naspects are easily separable or can be usefully isolated from the other\naspects of the topic. \n\nThere is no single, widely agreed upon theory that explains when an\nagent is or is not responsible for something that happens in the world.\nJudgments of responsibility are normative, and may depend on other\nnormative facts specific to the particular sort of action or practice\nin question. For instance, facts that might limit one's\nresponsibility for signing or violating a contract might fail to limit\none's responsibility for killing someone. So the effect of\ncoercion or its kin (duress, extortion) may differ depending upon the\nsort of action for which one seeks to limit one's responsibility,\nor upon the moral context in which one acted. Nonetheless, a few\ncentral cases and some general tendencies can be given with some\nconfidence. \n\nThere are two traditional sorts of grounds on which an agent's\nresponsibility might be truncated or attenuated because he was coerced.\nThe first is by virtue of being excused for his action; the second is\nby virtue of his action's being justified. The exact\nunderstanding of this distinction is under continuing dispute, but here\nis one way of understanding its most salient points. One may be\nexcused, in whole or in part, for an action performed\nunder coercion if that action (or its consequences) was beyond\none's control or willpower to prevent, or if that action (or its\nconsequences) was unintentional. This latter condition might obtain if,\nfor instance, one acquiesces under coercion to do something\nintentionally (like driving a car), but in so doing one does something\nelse unintentionally (like helping a murderer escape). One is\njustified in acquiescing to coercion if one's action (or\nits consequences) is morally required, or is morally permissible under\nthe circumstances even if the action will foreseeably result in harm to\nothers. (One obvious category of actions that carry such justifications\nare those taken to disable an attacker in self-defense or the defense\nof others.) Inconveniently, neither sort of justification engages\nsmoothly with most recent theories of coercion that may be used to\ndetermine agent responsibility for acts performed under coercion. \n\nMost questions about coercion's effect on responsibility arise\nin cases of coercion via conditional threats. When an agent is\nconfronted by a threat, one ground on which her acquiescence may be\nexcused is if the threat causes a total breakdown in her will. Like\nother incapacities, this can affect her responsibility for actions\ntaken because she was truly unable to do otherwise. (This excuse may\nlead to questions about how the agent became vulnerable to suffering\nsuch a breakdown in agency; but in such cases she may be responsible\nfor her weakness of character, though perhaps not for her action.)\nExcuse may also be invoked when the coerced person acts in ignorance or\nif the harm she causes is unintentional (excuses which are available\nregardless of whether one is coerced). But many people are able to\nreact deliberately and rationally in response to coercive threats. So\nit seems that most cases of diminished responsibility under coercion\nwill appeal to justification rather than excuse. \n\nSome accounts of coercion apply a moralized test to the\ncoercee's situation, holding that one may avoid responsibility\nfor an act taken under coercion if the coercer's proposal is such\nthat one “is entitled to yield to [the coercer's] proposal\nand then be released from the normal moral and legal consequences of\n[one's] act” (Wertheimer 1987, 267). Such a moralized\ntest might be the best theorists can do, but it requires a theory\nseparate from that which explains the coerciveness of the proposal to\nbegin with. (For instance, Wertheimer's theory has two\n“prongs”: the first prong decides whether a particular\nproposal is coercive; it's the second prong which then determines\nwhether a coercive proposal, once made, does indeed coerce someone in\nthe sense that it affects her responsibility for acquiescing). Although\nthere are some specific moralized or normative tests one might use to\ndecide responsibility for action under coercion, it is unclear that any\nof them is robust enough to handle more than a fraction of the\n cases.[17] \n\nOne test of responsibility that might be proposed would limit the\nresponsibility of someone acting under coercion if she acts in a way\nthat minimizes the total amount of harm (invoking the\n“lesser-evil principle”). So, for instance, we might deny\nthat a person is responsible for choosing to injure another to avoid\nbeing killed, but hold her responsible if she chooses to kill someone\nto avoid being injured herself. Though this principle is intuitively\nplausible, we clearly do not accept it in other, non-coercive contexts.\nFor instance, we do not permit one to snatch a spare kidney from one\nindividual to save the life of another. Although we might add\nconditions to this test to make the limitation of one's\nresponsibility harder to obtain, and therefore more in line with our\nintuitions, it remains unclear that there is any well-formed moral\nprinciple of this sort that would cover all cases equally well. \n\nInstead of a moral test, one might propose a psychological test, on\nwhich acquiescing to a coercer's demands in a way that harms\nothers is justified if the net value of doing so is sufficiently great\nto the coercee. Roughly speaking, this is Feinberg's approach,\ntaken up by Murray and Dudrick as well. (See Feinberg 1986; and Murray\nand Dudrick 1995.) The point of such a standard is to recognize that\nsome pressures on the will are too much to bear, without implying that\nin such cases it is literally impossible for the coercee to make\nchoices because of an overborne will. The difficulty with this approach\nis that it lets the degree of inducement alone justify one's\nyielding to it. A number of causes other than coercion can create\nextreme inducements to do harm to others; consider what some have done\nfor fame, wealth, or love. Because most would be reluctant to accept\nthat even extraordinarily tempting offers limit one's\nresponsibility for yielding to them, the magnitude of the inducement by\nitself seems not to suffice to explain our judgments of responsibility.\nAlthough we might add other conditions to restrict the limiting effect\non responsibility exclusively to threats and not offers, if the\njustification lies in the pressure on the will, then it would seem one\nmight have the same justification for yielding to temptation that one\nhas for acquiescing to a mortal threat. (Note that some tempting offers\nhave life or death riding on them.) \n\nLaw is sometimes required to make judgments about actions performed\nunder necessity due to exigent circumstances. Sometimes persons harm\nthe interests of others in order to save themselves or others from\ndeath or serious injury from causes beyond their\n control.[18]\n Coercion,\nhowever, presents a more complicated set of issues for making judgments\nof responsibility than do cases of natural necessity. Coercion involves\na strategic and dynamic interaction between two agents — coercer\nand coercee — and the standard used to judge the coercee's\nresponsibility for acting under coercion can affect that strategic\nsituation. The principles by which we judge a coercee's\nresponsibility for acquiescing to coercion may affect whether it is\nrational or productive for a would-be coercer to attempt coercion in\nthe first place. (By comparison, in cases of bad luck and natural\ndisaster, the situation is simpler because the behavior of the weather,\nunlike the behavior of coercers, is unaffected by the incentives facing\nthose who might be pressured into acting under its power.) If we are\npermissive in limiting the responsibility of coercees, this will make\nacquiescing to coercion a more reasonable option; if instead we are\nstingy in limiting responsibility for harms caused under coercion,\ncoercees may be much less likely to acquiesce to a coercer's\nthreats. But if a (would-be) coercer knows that a potential victim will\nbe unyielding to his threats, then coercion becomes a less productive\nor reasonable means to use. So in choosing a principle that justifies\ncoercees in acquiescing under coercion, we need to take into account\nthat this principle may alter the dynamic between coercer and coercee\nin ways that may in turn affect the rationality and fruitfulness of\nusing coercion. \n\nThere are, however, some cases in which coercion may alter an agent's\nresponsibility for what happens as a result of coercion that don't\nraise the difficulties noted above. If, like some older ideas about\ncoercion, we count uses of direct physical interference among the\nmeans of coercion, then in some cases it is comparatively easy to see\nhow coercion can affect an individual's responsibility for things done\nor not done because of coercion. If one is restrained, incapacitated\nby violent means, or denied essential means to achieve a purpose, then\nit may be fairly obvious why one has an excuse for not doing otherwise\nthan one did (See Anderson 2010). Relying on the principle of “ought implies\ncan,” when one cannot do something, this provides a good excuse\nfor why one is not responsible for failing to do it. Related questions\nmay arise about how one came to be incapacitated; for instance, if one\nfails to care for one's children, and seeks to be excused for this\nneglect because one was incarcerated, we may want to know why one was\nincarcerated before crediting the excuse.  Nonetheless, there will be\nsome cases where the answers to these questions will show that the\ncoercee played no role in his own incapacitation, and is therefore not\nto be held responsible for things the coercer caused him to do or not\ndo. \n\nSimilarly, it is worth noting that there are some cases in which\ncoercees may be justified, and not just excused, for acquiescing to\nthreats, even if they do so calmly and deliberately. This sort of\njustification can be granted when the coercer has structured an\ncoercee's situation in such a way that the coercee's will\nbecomes essentially redundant to the outcome. If, for instance, a\nbouncer is able to remove a patron from the bar whether she likes it or\nnot, then if the bouncer threatens to do so, her walking out of the bar\nin response to such a threat may be regarded as no more voluntary than\nher being carried out by force. When a coercer has the power to enforce\nhis decision regardless of what the coercee chooses to do, this may\nprovide the coercee a justification for failing to engage in an\nexercise in\n futility.[19] \n\nIn the next section, we'll consider how coercion is thought to\nimpinge upon freedom, something that raises obvious ethical\nimplications in its own right. So consideration of these sorts of\nethical issues will be postponed until there. The present section looks\nat certain more basic questions about whether coercion is intrinsically\nwrong, and what else might be wrong with it besides its effect on\nfreedom or autonomy. \n\nThere has been considerable debate over the question of whether\ncoercion is intrinsically wrongful. There seem to be three categories\nin which answers to this question might fall: coercion is intrinsically\nwrongful; it is prima facie or pro tanto wrongful,\nthough it may be justified by further facts; and it is intrinsically\nmorally neutral, though some uses of it may be wrongful because of\nspecific facts about them. Differences in understanding what is\nwrongful about it may account for these different positions. \n\nOne is most likely to accept the first view, that coercion is\nintrinsically wrongful if one defines coercion as some sort of\nviolation or threatened violation of the coercee's rights.\nWertheimer's account seems to accept such a view, as does Cheyney\nRyan's arguments for a normative conception of coercion. (See\nWertheimer 1987; Ryan 1980.) This close tie between coercion and\nimmoral action captures a number of intuitions we have about coercion,\nreflecting also a lot of ordinary language. People often associate\nuses of coercion with injustices done to themselves or others. This\ntie also provides a sharper division between coercive and non-coercive\nactivity than might otherwise be found: if an activity is morally\nunobjectionable, then it is ipso facto not coercive. Of\ncourse, if identifying coercion requires a prior moral judgment, then\none will need to be able to make such judgments reliably in order to\nbe able to identify coercion reliably. But this suggests an objection\nto this view of coercion's wrongfulness: there are some situations in\nwhich the coerciveness of an action appears obvious even though it may\nbe difficult or impossible to ascertain its rightfulness or\nwrongfulness (this objection goes doubly for the next proposal,\nviz., that coercion is prima facie or pro\ntanto wrongful). Thus some (e.g., Zimmerman 2002) have resisted\nmaking judgments of coercion depend on prior moral judgments. The\nWertheimer/Ryan view also generates a categorical distinction between\ndifferent possible uses (and users) of the same technique: if the\nmafia threatens to destroy your property if you fail to pay protection\nmoney, this threat will count as coercive; but if the just,\nwell-regulated state threatens to confiscate your property unless you\npay taxes, this threat is arguably not coercive, on this view. Some\ndifficulties stemming from this implication will be noted in the next\nsection. \n\nThe second view, that coercion is prima facie or pro\ntanto immoral, is probably the most commonly held view. Yet it is\ndifficult to find and describe the immoral factor in coercion that will\nthen suffice to explain its wrongfulness when not rebutted, while\navoiding the miscategorization of cases. Here are two recent attempts\nat such a description. \n\nOne suggestion holds that it is the wrongness of the act threatened\nthat makes the use of such a threat a wrongful act itself. Mitchell\nBerman has argued that when a coercer threatens to do something, the\nrightness or wrongness of the use of such a threat to coerce depends on\nwhether it would be rightful or wrongful for that agent to carry\nthrough with that threat (Berman 2002). Berman's account of\nwrongful coercion thus apparently relies on a principle of inference\nthat holds that if it is wrong to do A, then it is wrong to\nthreaten to do A, and vice versa. While this\nprinciple would seem to get support from a lot of particular cases,\nit's not clear that it holds in all cases. At least sometimes it\nappears appropriate to threaten to do something which would be wrong to\ncarry out (nuclear deterrence is sometimes thought to be like this; see\nSection 4.1 below). And sometimes it may be wrongful to threaten what\nit would be right to carry out (blackmail and extortion are sometimes\nthought to include such cases). In general, making a\nconditional threat allows for considerable ethical complexity\nbecause a threat can amount to nothing more than a bit of\ncommunication, yet in some circumstances such communication is\ntantamount to an act of considerable violence, with similar\nconsequences. In fact, making a conditional threat is often a more\ntroublesome and ethically problematic act than making a plain,\nunconditional\n threat.[20]\n Unfortunately, the ethical complexities\ninvolved in the making of conditional threats have been little explored\nto date by those more centrally interested in\n coercion.[21]\n (For criticism of and an alternative to Berman's approach, see Anderson 2011.) \n\nA second suggestion holds that there's something special about\nthe coercer's intention vis-à-vis the coercee that makes\ncoercion frequently problematic. Grant Lamond suggests that the\nwrongness of wrongful coercion derives from the fact that it involves a\n“proposal deliberately to impose a disadvantage on another”\n(Lamond 2000, 49). “The distinctive wrong involved in\n[coercive conditional] threats is to propose to take an action\nbecause it is unwelcome to the recipient, i.e., because he\ndoes not want it done” (Lamond 1996, 228). It is thus the\ncoercer's intention to harm or disadvantage the coercee (or to\npropose to do so) that creates coercion's special burden of\njustification (though Lamond does not suppose such justifications are\nparticularly difficult to find). But it isn't clear either that\nwhen one proposes to harm another that one thereby intends to\nbring about any harm (one could be\n bluffing).[22]\n More importantly, it's\nalso unclear that all intentions to impose disadvantages are even\nprima facie in need of justification. Unless we accept that\nall activities are prima facie unjustified absent specific\njustifications, it requires an argument to show that disadvantaging\nanother person is itself something that always must clear a hurdle to\ncount as justified. Certainly some kinds of disadvantage require\nspecial justification, but some may not. One might, for instance,\nintend to disadvantage one's social rival by arranging to have\nhim seated between two dreary bores at a dinner party. While perhaps\nnot nice, it seems to require no special moral justification for this\naction (or the threat of this action) to be ethically permissible. We\nmight say that so long as one respects the rights of others (a set as\nrich as one likes), one needs no special justification to act towards\nthem as one likes. And surely no one has the right that no one else\nwill ever act for the sake of disadvantaging one. If this is the case,\nthen the mere intention to disadvantage someone, perhaps conditionally,\ndoes not suffice to violate her rights. \n\nThe ethics of coercion, when this is understood to be a morally\nneutral means to the coercer's purposes, have been little\nexplored in the contemporary literature, at least as a distinct\nsubject. It is of course true that many ways of coercing someone are\ndangerous, damaging, and (when used by private parties) unlawful. But\nthe fact that coercion is a necessary tool, even for just governments\nin well-ordered societies, gives some reason to suppose that the ethics\nof coercion depend principally on a set of discrete factors in its use,\nrather than on its intrinsic qualities. These factors include why and\nhow it is used, who uses it, against whom, in what circumstances, and\nwhat other means were possible instead. Coercion is no ordinary means.\nBut it's unclear why we should say that it is intrinsically (even\nprima facie or pro tanto) immoral, instead of simply\nnoting that it is a very potent means, prone to abuse, and something\nthat deserves ethical scrutiny whenever it is used. \n\nSome choices are said to be made freely, others unfreely, or\ninvoluntarily. More generally, people may be said to live more freely\nor less freely, depending on facts such as the range and quality of\nchoices open to them, the extent to which they are immune to\ninterference from outside powerful parties, or the extent to which\nthey can pursue options of deep significance to\nthem. Autonomy seems to be a special type of freedom which,\ninsofar as it differs from the above types, is used to refer to an\ninner state of orderly self-directedness. Coercion has been thought to\nbe inimical to at least some of these types of freedom, perhaps all,\nand also to have deleterious impacts on the special type we call\nautonomy. \n\nIf coercion includes uses of direct force against a person's\nbody, it is clear enough how it can constrain most kinds of freedom\n(though not necessarily how it can affect autonomy). But as Aquinas\nlong ago noted, it's unclear why coercion in the form of threats\nshould be thought to be in tension with freedom. As Craig Carr puts the\nworry, “if at least some instances of coercion involve making\nchoices, and if being able to make one's own choices is part of\nwhat it means to be free, in what sense (if any) is coercion\nantithetical to freedom?” (Carr 1988, 59). Certainly many\ninstances of coercion make one's choices less appealing than they\nwould be otherwise, or reduce the quality of the compossible options\none has available. But it does sound somewhat odd to say that one is\nless free just because one's choices have become less appealing,\nor some options for action have fallen off the menu of choices. Is\nthere a sense we can give to the claim that one is less free because of\ncoercion? \n\nLet us consider first a type of freedom associated with the range\nand quality of actions open to a person. One gets an intuitive idea of\nthis sort of freedom in comparing the situation of a prison inmate to\nthat of someone outside prison. Someone confined to a cell around the\nclock has less freedom than does someone who is able to move about as\nshe wills, interact with others in a variety of ways, and choose from a\nbroad variety of activities (at least if she has available sufficient\nmeans to pursue them). We might be tempted to say that the\nunincarcerated person has more and better choices of\nactions. But several difficulties get in the way of making such a\ncomparison precise. We lack a precise way to enumerate actions, which\nseems necessary if we are to count them or compare their number. The\nincarcerated and unincarcerated both have indeterminately many\ndifferent things they can do, each can do only perform some small range\nof those actions at any one time. (It's even likely that the\nincarcerated person can do some things the unincarcerated\n person\n can't.[23])\nSo it is probably more helpful to focus on the greater quality and\ndesirability of the actions open to the unincarcerated person. Being\nconfined to a jail cell takes away one's freedom at least in part\nbecause it denies one the necessary means to pursue many other\nactivities that would ordinarily be desirable. But we also have no good\nmeans for reckoning the value of different actions interpersonally. So\neven this comparison is hard to make in a robust, defensible\n fashion.[24] \n\nWith some threats, it seems an interpersonal comparison is\nunnecessary. When the gunman demands one's money or one's\nlife, one goes from being able to have both to being unable to have\nboth. What were compossible goods have now become incompossible, and a\nvaluable option (e.g., keeping one's money) has become\nessentially foreclosed. So freedom is decreased. \n\nFocusing locally on the coercee's situation, such analysis\nseems reasonable enough. However, it is possible that some general\nthreats, made against a group of people, may make the individuals in\nthe group more rather than less free. Consider the threats that are\npart of laws against stealing. The state may threaten to jail those who\nsteal, which (let us assume) makes it incompossible both to steal and\nto retain one's freedom. The possibility of a stable system of\nprivate property, however, would seem to depend on the existence of\nsuch laws which prohibit the wanton expropriation of the goods of\nothers. If such a regime is in fact valuable, then the threat to\nincarcerate thieves may both reduce people's freedom with respect\nto one sort of action (by making stealing incompossible with remaining\nunincarcerated), while enhancing it with respect to others (by making\nit possible to accumulate, use, and trade private property). For\nanother example, notice that the ability to make enforceable contracts\nwith others greatly enhances one's abilities to gain through\ncooperation, but that it relies precisely on the fact that contracting\nparties give up certain seemingly compossible benefits (say, gaining\nthe goods of another while failing to fulfill one's half of the\nbargain). \n\nCraig Carr suggests that we can grapple with the complexities here\nby noticing that many social interactions are regulated by conventions\nthat arise from particular sorts of interpersonal relationships. So,\nfor instance, a sports team is managed by a coach, who may\n“threaten” to pull a player out of the game unless he\nsticks to the game plan. But this threat does not, we may agree, lessen\nthe player's freedom in any interesting sense (Carr 1988,\n62). Given the nature of sports, the roles of players and coaches, and\nthe necessity of organization in making the team and sport possible,\nCarr suggests that when such threats are licensed by the appropriate\nconventions, then there is no reason to suppose that they impinge on\nfreedom. It may be difficult in many cases to decide just what\nconventions are appropriate and controlling in a situation, but it\nseems reasonable to suppose that something like Carr's analysis\nis helpful in understanding the relationship between threats and\nfreedom in conventional contexts. \n\nThere's a different way of thinking about freedom that is\npolitical in nature. This is the way of thinking that some (e.g.,\nPettit 1996) have associated with civic republicanism, in which\nfreedom amounts to being undominated by another agent. One is dominated\nby another if it is continually possible for another party to step in\nand impose his will on one's choices (even if the dominant party\nrarely finds it useful to do so). Freedom from domination differs from\nthe previous sort in that one who is subject to the domination of\nanother may in fact have a wide variety of valuable choices open to\nher. The sense in which she is unfree is that her choices must always\nbe made with an eye towards retaining the favor of those in a position\nto interfere with her choices. Conversely, one may be undominated by\nanyone else, yet lack (for various reasons) many of the different\nvaluable options that might be available to some who are highly subject\nto the power of others (e.g., adolescent children of wealthy parents,\nor prisoners in minimum-security facilities). \n\nCoercion is one method by which a powerful agent can exercise and\nmaintain his dominance over another. When one has the power needed to\ncredibly threaten another, one can use that power to impose one's will\non her regarding many choices (Anderson 2010). This power may give one\nthe ability to dominate another in Pettit's sense, since it can be\nused arbitrarily to alter or constrain another's activities, even if\nit is in fact used only rarely. If one's threats are sufficiently\ncredible, and if meeting one's demands is not devastating in itself,\none may be able to leverage one's powers to influence many of the\nactivities of others, while only rarely being required to expend one's\npowers in enforcement. Malignant governments and mafias are frequently\nable to maintain control over sizeable populations through threats and\nintimidation, though they may only infrequently interfere directly in\nthe activities of others. If one's powers and wishes are well enough\nknown through past demonstrations, one may even be able to avoid\nmaking many overt threats while still getting one's way. \n\nThis raises a question about whether the use of coercion requires or\nimplies that the coercer is in a position of dominance over the\ncoercee. While most would likely accept that one can coerce without\nhaving such dominance, this may be a rarer and more curious scenario\nthan it at first appears. It is true that virtually anyone can state a\nclaim that has the form of a threat against another, and it is also\ntrue that many agents can issue credible threats that are nonetheless\nbluffs — that is, can threaten without possessing the power that\nis advertised. Nonetheless, the possibility and usefulness of issuing\nthreats depends in general on the likelihood that such threats can be\nexecuted successfully, without the coercer suffering a cost comparable\nto that of the coercee. Also, it would seem that for coercion to be\npossible, one must be in a position to do more than trivial damage to\nthe coercee's interests; otherwise, one might be said to use\ncoercion when one threatens, e.g., to quit one's minimum-wage\nfast-food job if one's employer doesn't raise one's\nwage to match what one could make at the restaurant across the street.\nMoreover, coercers frequently need to craft and adapt their threats to\nthe specific vulnerabilities of the coercee. Gideon Yaffe has nicely\nexpressed this aspect of the relationship between the coercer's\npower and their ability to affect one's freedom: \n\nIf a coercer lacks the power needed to do these things, it may be\nirrational for the coercer to execute his threat if defied, and hence\nfrequently irrational for the coercee to accede to it. So unless the\ncoercer or coercee is irrational (and the other perceives him as such),\nor unless one is deceived about the other's relative power (or\nrationality), coercion requires some significant differential in power\nbetween coercer and coercee for it, in general, to be a rational,\nuseful technique. So even if a just state does not dominate its\ncitizens in Pettit's sense of exercising its power over them\narbitrarily, it still must be capable of such dominance if it is to be\nable to keep order against those who would otherwise defy its\ncommands. \n\nAs the historical section of this entry suggests, the relationship\nbetween states, law, and coercion has been a subject of vast discussion\nthroughout Western philosophical history. Many of the most pressing\nissues belong to a discussion of states and law rather than to a\ndiscussion of\n coercion.[25]\n However, some theorists have attempted to\ndraw some fairly revisionist lessons about politics and law from their\ntheoretical discussions of coercion. This work is worth consideration\nhere, since their conclusions may impact how we understand the nature\nof coercion, and its place in law and politics. \n\nAs noted above, there are a number of accounts of coercion that insist\nthat coercion is a violation of right, or otherwise normatively\ndefective, of which Alan Wertheimer's Coercion is the most\nprominent. But if coercion is necessarily immoral action, then it is\nhard to explain how an act of coercion could count as\njustified.[26]\nAmong other implications, this view is in apparent contradiction with\nthe traditional approach to coercion which treats states as\nparadigmatically, even necessarily users of coercion. As William\nEdmundson has pointed out (and as Nozick 1969, had noticed), if the\nstate is justified in punishing wrongdoers, then when it threatens to\ndo so, it does not threaten to make them worse off than they ought to\nbe (Edmundson 1995 and 1998, chs. 4–6). Hence on an approach to\ncoercion that insists it is immoral activity, the state's use of\npolice powers to enforce the law is not coercive. \n\nCould this be right? It hinges, first, on whether one accepts a\nmoralized analysis of coercion; if one can give a non-moralized account\nof coercion, then the grounds for the claim are much more tenuous. It\nwould also seem to depend on whether the moral evaluation of the\ncoercer's action is an “all things considered”\njudgment, or merely a pro tanto one. While the\ngovernment's use of coercion may be all-things-considered morally\nbenign, the threat of jailing someone may count as pro tanto\nwrong in a way that, say, paying a reward is not. If so, then even on a\nmoralized account we may suppose that government coercion requires\nspecial justification before it can be accepted. Wertheimer, Haksar,\nLamond, and Oberdiek, for instance, seem to find no problem accepting\nthat there is “justified coercion” — that is, acts\nwhich are coercive on a moralized theory of coercion (baseline or\notherwise), yet which are ultimately justified by other considerations\n(Oberdiek 1976; Haksar 1976; Wertheimer 1987; and Lamond 2000 and\n2001). Edmundson, however, argues that such a view is unmotivated and\nnot required by a moralized theory, properly understood. If he is\nright, then the uses of what are normally thought of as coercive\ntechniques do not call for special scrutiny if they are constrained to\nthe support of just, procedurally sound law. \n\nEdmundson's criticism of the canonical view of the state as\ncoercive reveals a deeper root to some disagreements over coercion. In\neffect, Edmundson provides a reason to question how special or\nimportant coercion really is. Coercion may make some actions necessary,\nbut human beings in any natural world will be constrained by\nnecessities of many sorts: the physical limits of our bodies in our\nenvironments, and our needs for things such as nourishment, shelter,\nprotection, and even perhaps community, recognition, and love. To be\ncoerced adds to or alters in some ways what it is necessary for one to\ndo. But being subject to a coercive set of laws might also provide one\ngreater opportunities or freedom from necessity, as arguably the\ncriminal law does, at least if well-drafted and\n enforced.[27]\n If just laws\nprovide us protection from wrong-doers while leaving us at liberty to\ntake any morally justifiable act (assuming here that the criminal law\nprohibits only unjust acts), then the law's threatened use of\nforce against lawbreakers may not merit any special scrutiny. We might\ninstead regard it as a shifting, regularization, and rationalization of\nthe necessities to which human beings are anyways subject. Edmundson\nand those he disputes with can all agree that coercion used for illicit\nends is a matter of moral significance and a cause for special scrutiny\nand opposition. What Edmundson shows is that moralized approaches to\ncoercion make it hard to see why the technique itself and the agents\nwho can use it are especially worthy of our attention. \n\nOne might thus object to moralized accounts on the grounds that we\nhave reason to track and scrutinize uses of this technique whether\nperformed well or badly, justly or unjustly. This is because when an\nagent has the power to coerce willy nilly, as the state does, it is up\nto such an agent to decide what purposes it will use its powers for.\nNatural necessities are typically predictable, stable requirements on\nour actions, persisting without regard to us as individuals. By\ncontrast, powerful agents are not necessarily predictable, stable, or\nindifferent to us as individuals. Rather, they can target and direct\ntheir powers to suit their purposes. Of course we hope that they are\nconstrained by justice, but even mostly just governments are likely to\nenact bad laws or have rogue elements within them. Hence there is value\nin having a concept to pick out the sort of technique used in law\nenforcement, forced migrations, mafia protection rackets, back-alley\nrobbery, and the training of some recalcitrant children, since one and\nthe same state might use the same tools and techniques to engage any or\nall of these sorts of activities, with only the whim of the leader or\nparliament to decide which it shall be. \n\nA slightly less radical, though still revisionist claim about the\ncoerciveness of law, holds that the coerciveness of law resides in its\nclaim to a right to use (or authorize the use of) enforcement power.\nDrawing a distinction between the state and its apparatuses on the one\nhand, and the law on the other, Grant Lamond argues that the\ncoerciveness of law should not be thought to depend on the fact that\nthe state has such things as police departments and prisons as its\nenforcement mechanisms. Rather, he argues that the coerciveness of law\nresides in its claim to a “right to authorize the\nenforcement of [its subjects duties, responsibilities,\netc.]… It is not that legal duties are sanction-based, nor that\nevery law must ultimately be linked to coercive measures, but that law\nclaims the right to back up its directives with force”\n(Lamond 2001, 55). He later clarifies this view to point out that\nthe law claims indeterminate authority to enforce its\ndictates. \n\nLamond's aim in making this distinction is to clarify what he\nsees to be several possible confusions. First, he argues that the\nlaw's coerciveness need not depend directly on the state's\nown enforcement apparatus; the state might use vigilantes, private\ncontractors, or other private means for this\n function.[28]\n Moreover, he aims to limit\nlaw's responsibility for coercive acts to just those that it in\nfact authorizes: extra-legal uses of coercion by the state should not\nbe chalked up to law's coerciveness. He also argues that some of\nthe coercive enforcements that law uses are not themselves uses of\nforce; instead, one might confiscate bank accounts or take away rights\nin non-tangible property (such as intellectual property protections) as\nmeans to pressure subjects to comply with the law. Lamond holds that if\nsuch interventions exert sufficient pressure on the will of those\nconsidering a particular option, such that they change course, then\nthey may be counted as coercive, even if they do not involve the threat\nor imposition of sanctions conditioned on the activities of the people\ngoverned (Lamond 2000, 56–57). Lastly, like Edmundson, he aims to\ndownplay the supposed role that coercion plays in our appreciation of\nthe law, holding that many of law's functions do not depend\nspecifically on its function of authorizing (or not authorizing)\nenforcements on the subjects. “It is easy to exaggerate the role\nof coercion in maintaining the efficacy of the legal system, and to\noverestimate its capacity to sustain efficacy” (Lamond 2001,\n57). \n\nLamond's claim about law's coerciveness stems from a\nnumber of considerations, but undoubtedly one is his understanding of\nthe nature of coercion itself, which was discussed in Section 2.5\nabove. Whether or not his account of coercion is tenable, what Lamond\nsays about why law is coercive generates independent difficulties. Even\nif the law claims to authorize the enforcement of its subjects'\nduties, it is not clear why the mere claiming of such\nauthorization would suffice to make the claiming coercive. The laws of\na state may well provide for and instruct agencies or mechanisms to\nserve as its enforcers (e.g., police, vigilantes, or robots); but if\nthese enforcers quit, or are bought/killed/shut off, the coerciveness\nof the law will quickly evaporate. If, for instance, the army decides\nto side with the protestors rather than the government, the law loses\nits force in a hurry, no matter how legitimate. Moreover, were a\nprivate association or other institution to “lay claim” to\nuse such indeterminately bounded enforcement powers, what would\ndetermine whether in fact they ended up being coercive is whether\nin fact they managed to engage in enforcement activities through\nagencies or mechanisms similar to those that states regularly use, or\nso Lucas points out. (Lucas 1966, 61–2) A church, for instance,\nmight even leverage its threats with claims about the final disposition\nof one's mortal soul. But this sort of claim to reward and punish\ndoes not give the church the ability to coerce, at least as this\nconcept is usually understood in political contexts. \n\nSome have argued directly that law does not require coercive backing\nin order to count as law (e.g., Raz 1975), holding that what is\ninstead important is that law is made by the appropriate authority\n(see also Oberdiek 1976).  Responding to Joseph Raz, Edmundson, and\nLamonde, inter alia, Ekow Yankah defends the traditional view\nconnecting law and coercion, contending that “Legal norms must\nbe ultimately enforceable by coercion to be included in the core\nconcept of the law” (Yankah 2008, 1198). After developing\nhis own non-moralized conception of coercion, Yankah argues that law\nrequires not only authority but the ability to compel obedience.\nThere are, after all, many different possible normative systems, for\nexample religious ones, that claim to have moral authority to command\nobedience, but law is distinctive among them because it has the\npossibility to compel compliance with the edicts of justified\nauthorities.  Countering Raz's view that coercion might be merely\ninstrumentally needed, Yankah asserts, “the inability of any\nstructure to even theoretically compel [a lawbreaker] to obey would\ncast serious doubt on the system's claim to be the law” (Yankah,\n2008, 1236). \n\nIf in fact law must be backed by coercion to be law, and if, as\nfollows from this, states will necessarily and legitimately use\ncoercion against their citizens, then this may place a particular\njustificatory burden on the state and its citizens. Christopher\nJ. Eberle sees that “justificatory liberalism” (which he\nassociates with the work of liberals such as Rawls, Charles Larmore,\nRobert Audi, and Gerald Gaus) rightly puts the justification of\ncoercion as its central mission. “The claim that respect\nrequires public justification provides a basis for the central\ncomponent of the justificatory liberal's ethic of citizenship: the\nnorm of respect imposes an obligation on each citizen to discipline\nherself in such a way that she resolutely refrains from supporting any\ncoercive law for which she cannot provide the requisite public\njustification” (Eberle 2002, 12, emphasis omitted; see also\nGaus 2010). But along with this obligation, the necessity of state\ncoercion is argued to put citizens of a single state in a kind of\nrelationship to one another that differs from their relationship to\nthose outside their state. Michael Blake argues along these lines to\nconclude that a duty to promote economic equality as a matter of\njustice “is a plausible interpretation of liberal principles\nonly when those principles are applied to individuals who share\nliability to the coercive network of state governance” (Blake,\n2002, 258). \n\nThomas Nagel reasons likewise to a similar conclusion, and extends it\nto justify the exclusion of immigrants from a\nstate. “Immigration policies are simply enforced against the\nnationals of other states; the laws are not imposed in their name, nor\nare they asked to accept and uphold those laws. Since no acceptance is\ndemanded of them, no justification is required that explains why they\nshould accept such discriminatory policies, or why their interests\nhave been given equal consideration. It is sufficient justification to\nclaim that the policies do not violate their prepolitical human\nrights” (Nagel 2005, 129–30). Against this view, the use of\ncoercion to exclude non-citizens from a state has been argued to\nviolate basic rights (Huemer 2010) and principles of democratic\ntheory (Abizadeh 2008; for objections and replies, see Miller 2009\nand 2010; and Abizadeh 2010). As the next section will further\nillustrate, the coercion beyond a state's borders is a contentious\nissue. \n\nTheories of coercion can have significant implications in a number\nof different particular ranges of application, falling roughly into two\ncategories: domestic and international. These categories may also be\nregarded as the sub-legal and super-legal uses of coercion. This\nsection gives a brief discussion of the questions in these areas, and\nwhat these areas add to thought about coercion. \n\nQuestions of coercion arise in numerous different judicial contexts,\nincluding judgments of responsibility and/or culpability for torts and\ncrimes. We may, for instance, want to know whether an illegal action\nhas been performed voluntarily, or whether one has been coerced by\nanother party into performing it. Many uses of coercion are also\ncriminal, and so judgments about coercion may come into deciding\nwhether, for instance, a rape, extortion, or blackmailing has occurred.\nContracts, marriages, waivers of responsibility, and evaluations of\nvarying sorts are considered void if made because of coercion.\nConfessions, “guilty” pleas, and testimony are to be\ndiscounted if given under coercion. \n\nOutside of specifically judicial contexts, questions about coercion\nmay arise, either with respect to shaping public policy, or for the\nsake of measuring social progress. For instance, we may want to know\nwhether and under what circumstances workers are coerced into working,\neither in particular jobs, or in general. It may also be of interest to\nknow whether sexual harassment in workplaces or schools is coercive,\nfor purposes of justifying a legal response to it. Those who design\nmedical and other human-subject-based experiments need to be able to\ndetermine whether their subjects participate freely or under coercion.\nMore generally, market economic transactions are thought to add to\noverall welfare (economic efficiency), but only if they are performed\nfreely, which includes their not being coerced. The possibility of\nrelying on ballots, survey data and other communications will also\ndepend on whether such responses are given free from coercion. \n\nThese questions are raised almost exclusively in contexts where\nthere is already in place a functioning legal authority possessing\ncoercive enforcement powers. The existence of such an ordering force\nhas a significant effect on the ability of other agents in society to\nuse and to detect specific uses of coercion, as well as other,\nnon-coercive means of getting people to do things. When a generalized\nmechanism for ensuring compliance with law is in place, other entities\n− legal, corporate, and informal − can establish rules\ngoverning the use of various sanctions, disabilities, and rewards, and\nexpect these to have certain effects. (For helpful discussion here, see\nLucas 1966, 61.) For instance, merchants and customers engage in\ncommerce, exchanging goods, because they are prevented from simply\ntaking those goods by force, fraud, theft, etc. Sometimes the\ninteractions between agents in a sub-legal context will overstep the\nboundaries between the voluntary and coercive, and thus render the\nactions of one party non-voluntary. But all such judgments here are\nmade within a background context of laws that govern quite generally\nhow persons may behave towards one another. And the coercive\nenforcement of those laws makes possible meaningful distinctions\nbetween coerced and uncoerced activity in all of the other parts of\nsocial life governed by the rule of law. \n\nCompared to the domestic context, the international context is\nusually a much less clearly or justly ordered place. Although it is\npossible to identify and analyze uses of coercion here, there are\ndifficulties in some of the main sorts of cases that both enrich and\ncomplicate thought about coercion. Several factors contribute to these\ndifficulties, including the typically much greater power of the agents\ninvolved; the much weaker epistemic position they typically occupy\nvis-à-vis the motives, abilities, and intentions of other\nactors; the complexity and (sometimes) irrationality of the actors\ninvolved; and the lack of any central coercive authority to provide the\nbasis for predictable, just, and enforceable rules for the conduct of\nsuch large, powerful agents. Given these difficulties, it can be hard\nto say much that is useful about international coercion. However a few\nspecific topics are worth discussing briefly to show the issues that\narise here. \n\nAlthough less prominent as a topic now than it was before the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, a large and useful philosophical\nliterature has developed around the questions of the justice and\nefficacy of various strategies for avoiding both nuclear war as well as\nsubjection to nuclear blackmail/extortion. The questions here are\ntremendously difficult to address sensibly, in part because the stakes\nof the policies and decisions at issue are so high and novel that they\nare almost beyond comprehension. Although nuclear threats appear\nsuperficially to be similar in structure to ordinary coercive threats,\nseveral facts set them apart. For one thing, the morality and\nrationality of such threats are significantly more complicated than in\nmost ordinary cases of coercion. As Gregory Kavka puts it,\nthere's a “paradox of deterrence” which holds that it\nis potentially morally proper to threaten to use MCWs even though it is\narguably immoral to actually use them for any reason (including in\nexecuting that threat) (Kavka 1978). This violates a plausible\nprinciple that holds that it is wrongful to intend to do what it would\nbe wrongful to do (the “wrongful intentions principle”).\nMoreover, even though it may be morally proper to threaten such use,\nKavka argues that no rational, morally motivated person could form the\nproper intention needed to make a credible threat of such use.\nSubsequent writers have argued over whether in fact these paradoxes\nhold as Kavka suggests. (See, e.g., Dworkin 1985; Wasserstrom 1985;\nKroon 1996.) The moral issues in deterring nuclear war and the use of\nMCWs more generally are of central importance, and depend little if at\nall on our understanding the nature or ethics of coercion, per\nse (Hardin 1986). But, looking in the other direction, issues\naround deterrent threats involving MCWs do tell us some things about\nthe nature of coercion. \n\nThere is a general and acknowledged difficulty in explaining how\ncoercion by threat is possible: if the coercee defies the demand backed\nby the threat, it is typically irrational, because futile, for the\ncoercer to go ahead and execute his threat. In some cases, this problem\nis solved by the fact that the coercer gains reputational benefits by\nexecuting the threat, or the coercer enjoys a sufficient advantage in\npower that executing the threat may be a relatively trivial matter for\nhim. But coercion is a different and much more complicated matter when\nexecuting a threat is much more costly to the coercer than is the mere\nmaking of the threat. The threat of massive retaliation in response to\na nuclear attack is a paradigmatic example of a kind of threat that\nwould be irrational to execute after the associated demand is defied\n— if, for instance, one has already been the victim of\none's opponent's first-strike. For this reason, the ability\nto make such a threat credibly requires more than a simple intention\nand ability to execute the threat, but rather a whole system that\neffectively removes decision from the process (by, say, building\nredundancy and automation into it). So, it would appear that nuclear\ndeterrence cannot be an ordinary species of coercion, since the coercer\ncannot remain at liberty with respect to whether or not it will execute\nthe threat. (For the difference this makes, see DeRose 1992.) \n\nNuclear deterrence thus pushes to the forefront consideration of two\nfacts that recent philosophy of coercion tends to obscure: one, the\ndeep connection between the credibility of one's threats and the\ndemonstrable ability and willingness to execute them; and two, the\ndynamic or strategic nature of coercive interactions. If execution of a\nthreat would be irrational, then the coercer must use some technique to\nprecommit to its execution, or else demonstrate irrationality (or\nsomething like it) so as to make the threat credible (see Schelling\n1956). The dynamic aspect of coercion comes out in the fact that the\nrationality and morality of one actor's choices depends on what\nthe other actor (would) choose to do in response to them; and\nconsequently the rationality/morality of the latter actor's\nchoices may depend on that of the former actor's choices. While\nit is difficult to see through to a satisfactory account of such\nmatters, it is important to keep these difficulties in mind in\ntheorizing about how coercion works. \n\nTerrorism is often associated with coercion, but of the reasons to\ndoubt the justifiability of terrorism, its coerciveness is perhaps one\nof the lesser ones. Much more important is the fact that terrorism\ntypically, though not always, targets innocents and non-combatants. So\nmost philosophical effort on terrorism has gone towards arguing about\nwhether such targeting of innocents is ever morally acceptable, and if\nso, under what conditions. \n\nIf thinking about the coerciveness of terrorism helps at all, it is\nperhaps by bringing out some ways in which terrorism differs from more\nstandard forms of coercion, and why these differences may make it more\nproblematic, rather than less. (For discussion of these matters, see\nWaldron 2004). Terrorism aims at affecting the psychological workings\nof one or more people (often, a large part of society), though not\nnecessarily in the way that coercion by threat does. There are\ndifferences of the aim, means, and powers involved. The aim of\nterrorism is often less specific than the aim of coercion. While those\nwho use terror tactics may have a specific policy change or end result\nin mind, sometimes the end is, at least initially, simply to create\nchaos, fear, and panic on the part of those terrorized. It may also be\nto provoke a retaliatory response, or to enact revenge on or to make a\nstatement about the worth of one's enemy. When terrorism is used\ninstrumentally, with a change in action desired, terror tactics often\ndiffer from ordinary coercion in that those targeted by the harms or\nviolence are typically distinct from those whose action the terror user\nhopes ultimately to influence. Terrorism works by generating a sort of\npsychological response among those who are targets or potential targets\nof the attacks, typically with the aim of putting pressure on their\npolitical leaders or representatives to quell the chaos or anxiety of\nthe affected public. As for the power involved, terrorism might be a\ntactic of an agent who possesses overwhelming power, but frequently\nthose who engage in terror tactics lack the sort of power that is\nneeded to genuinely overpower the resistance of their target (in\ncontrast to the way that police, say, can overpower the resistance of\nvirtually any criminals they manage to arrest). If not for such\nweakness, they could simply impose their will on their targets instead\nof using terrorism. \n\nIn fact, the comparative weakness of some who use terror means that\nthey frequently need to engage in repeated acts of violence in order to\nestablish their credibility with respect to any subsequent demands and\nthreats they might make. It is unlikely that a group will be able to\ngain acquiescence to its demands by threatening to use terror tactics\nif it has not already engaged in such activity. But while the use of\nterror often betrays a relative weakness, those who use it also often\nrely on stealth, geographic dispersion, and choices of soft targets,\nmaking their attacks both very difficult to prevent (at least in ways\nthat are consistent with significant openness in one's own\nsociety), as well as very difficult to retaliate against. \n\nAlthough relations between those with unequal economic power are\noften said to be coercive, this claim is more accurate in some cases\nthan in others. The claim may be accurate in referring to many\ninteractions between agents from the richer, developed world and agents\nfrom the poorer, less developed world. But in addition to the fact of\ndisparities in wealth, even if they are alterable, something further is\nrequired to show that these relations are indeed coercive. After all,\nmany interactions between rich and poor have at least the veneer of\nbeing freely agreed upon economic exchanges. Sometimes, the\ncoerciveness of these relationships resides not so much in the economic\nexchanges themselves as in the way these exchanges are premised on and\nsupported by more traditional forms of coercion. \n\nThomas Pogge's work can be mined for suggestions as to how we\nmight recognize coercion in the relations between richer and poorer\nparts of the world. (See Pogge 2002, esp. chs. 4 and 8.) Three general\nsuggestions emerge. First, Pogge holds that the historical uses of\npower, both economic and military, by developed nations, have given\nrise to a global institutional framework which imposes and enables the\nunjust exploitation of poorer peoples by the world's more\npowerful actors. Here, we can look to paradigmatic types of coercion,\nsuch as war and invasion, coupled with economic leverage created by\ncontrol over institutions such as the World Bank and International\nMonetary Fund, to see how this framework has been created and\nmaintained. Colonialism and military interventionism, past and present,\nhave continuing impacts on which countries have the power to dictate\nterms of trade and international relations to others. This\n“institutional order,” which is “implicated in the\nreproduction of radical inequality,” owes its existence to\n“the developed countries [who], thanks to their vastly superior\nmilitary and economic strength, control these rules and therefore share\nresponsibility for their foreseeable effects” (Pogge 2002,\n199–200). \n\nA second way coercion is active in creating global poverty and\ninequality is in the repressive means used by some autocrats to\nmaintain power over their own poor subjects in underdeveloped\ncountries. These autocrats benefit from the recognition of wealthier\ncountries as the arbiters of what happens to the natural resources in\nthe territories they govern. By suppressing the inhabitants of these\nterritories and keeping them pliant, rulers are able to trade and sign\nagreements on their behalf with the countries and corporations of the\nrich nations. These transactions frequently denude poorer countries of\nvaluable resources and dispossess people of their land and rights,\nwhile the autocrats rake in profits and commissions from these\nexchanges. They can then use this wealth to purchase the weapons and\narmies needed to maintain power. Richer countries and institutions play\na crucial role in this process by both recognizing these rulers as\nlegitimate bargaining authorities on behalf of their peoples, and also\nby seeking to enforce the bargains that these autocrats strike against\nsubsequent governments and against the people themselves. As Pogge\npoints out, when a multinational corporation buys the rights to\nsomething in one of these autocratically governed countries, “the\npurchaser acquires not merely possession, but all the rights and\nliberties of ownership which are … protected and enforced by all\nother states' courts and police forces” (Pogge 2002,\n113). \n\nA third respect in which global poverty may be seen as coercive is\nby comparing the actual conditions of the world's poorest\nresidents to a minimal moral baseline needed to make acceptable any\ninstitution of coercively enforced property rights. According to this\nmoral baseline, any institution is coercive if it leaves some destitute\nbecause of their uncompensated exclusion from the world's natural\nresources. This follows, as Locke seems to suggest, from the fact that\nno one would rationally and voluntarily agree to a bargain such as that\n(Pogge 2002, 202). “[T]he affluent states are therefore\nviolating a negative duty of justice when they, in collaboration with\nthe ruling elites of the poor countries, coercively exclude the poor\nfrom a proportional resource share” (Pogge 2002, 203). \n\nThe interest in linking the persistence of global poverty to\ncoercion is suggested in the preceding quotation. Pogge argues that\nsuch poverty is not merely a natural fact, but is something that the\nwealthier parties in the world, who reap rewards from their domination\nof the poorer parts of the world, have a negative duty to redress. That\nis, by showing that these arrangements are not just unfair but are\nunfairly and coercively imposed by one party against another, Pogge\nbelieves that a stronger case can be made for the richer countries and\ninstitutions to alter the institutional structure of global economic\nrelations. These grounds even justify paying compensation to the worst\noff for their involuntary exclusion from the natural resources that\nunderlie the prosperity of the rest of the world.","contact.mail":"scott.anderson@ubc.ca","contact.domain":"ubc.ca"}]
