An\negalitarian favors equality of some sort: People should get the same,\nor be treated the same, or be treated as equals, in some respect. An\nalternative view expands on this last-mentioned option: People should\nbe treated as equals, should treat one another as equals, should relate\nas equals, or enjoy an equality of social status of some sort.\nEgalitarian doctrines tend to rest on a background idea that all human\npersons are equal in fundamental worth or moral status. So far as the\nWestern European and Anglo-American philosophical tradition is\nconcerned, one significant source of this thought is the Christian\nnotion that God loves all human souls equally. Egalitarianism is a\nprotean doctrine, because there are several different types of\nequality, or ways in which people might be treated the same, or might\nrelate as equals, that might be thought desirable. In modern democratic\nsocieties, the term “egalitarian” is often used to refer to a position\nthat favors, for any of a wide array of reasons, a greater degree of\nequality of income and wealth across persons than currently exists.\n\n \n\nEgalitarianism is a contested concept in social and political\nthought. One might care about human equality in many ways, for many\nreasons. As currently used, the label “egalitarian” does not\nnecessarily indicate that the doctrine so called holds that it is\ndesirable that people's condition be made the same in any respect or\nthat people ought to be treated the same in any respect. An\negalitarian might rather be one who maintains that people ought to be\ntreated as equals—as possessing equal fundamental worth and\ndignity and as equally morally considerable. In this sense, a sample\nnon-egalitarian would be one who believes that people born into a\nhigher social caste, or a favored race or ethnicity, or with an\nabove-average stock of traits deemed desirable, ought somehow to count\nfor more than others in calculations that determine what morally ought\nto be done. (On the thought that the core egalitarian ideal is\ntreating people as equals, see Dworkin 2000.) Further norms of\nequality of condition or treatment might be viewed as free-standing or\nderived from the claim of equality of status. Controversy also swirls\naround attempts to specify the class of beings to whom egalitarian\nnorms apply. Some might count all and only human beings as entitled to\nequality of status. Some would hold that all and only persons have\nequal moral status, with the criteria of personhood excluding some\nhumans from qualifying (e.g., the unborn fetus or severely demented\nadult human) and including some nonhumans (e.g., intelligent beings\ninhabiting regions of outer space beyond Earth). Some would hold that\nsentient beings such as nonhuman primates that do not satisfy criteria\nof personhood are entitled to equal moral status along with\npersons. Some advance other views. \n\nEgalitarianism can be instrumental or non-instrumental. Given a\nspecification of some aspect of people's condition or mode of treating\nthem that should be equal, one might hold that the state of affairs in\nwhich the stated equality obtains is morally valuable either as an end\nor as a means. The instrumental egalitarian values equality as a means\nto some independently specifiable goal; the non-instrumental\negalitarian values equality for its own sake—as an end, or as\npartly constitutive of some end. For example, someone who believes that\nthe maintenance of equality across a group of people fosters relations\nof solidarity and community among them, and is desirable for that\nreason, qualifies as an instrumental egalitarian. Someone who believes\nthat equality of some sort is a component of justice, and morally\nrequired as such, would be a non-instrumental egalitarian. \n\nEquality of any sort might be valued conditionally or\nunconditionally. One values equality in the former way if equality is\ndeemed valuable only if some further condition is in place. One might\nhold that equality in the distribution of resources among a group of\npersons is valuable, but only on the condition that the individuals are\nequally deserving. \n\nEquality might be deemed to be desirable or undesirable. A separate\nand distinct range of questions concerns whether or not people ought to\nact to bring about equality or are obligated to bring about equality\n(see Nagel 1991). The discussion to come often merges these questions,\nthe assumption being that if equality is valuable, that is at least one\ngood reason for thinking one should bring it about. \n\nFor those who regard equality as a requirement of justice, the\nquestion arises, whether this is a timeless unchanging or instead a\nvariable requirement. Michael Walzer is one who appears to take the\nlatter view. According to Walzer, a society is just if and only if its\npractices and institutions are in accord with the shared values and\ncultural understandings of its people. Democratic egalitarianism\nbecomes a requirement of justice in modern societies, because this\negalitarianism is an underlying important element of people's\nshared values and cultural understandings (Walzer 1983). But this\nappearance may be misleading. Walzer may hold that everyone at all\ntimes and places has an equal moral entitlement to be treated according\nto the shared norms and cultural understandings of one's people\nor group. Walzer may also hold that everyone at all times and places\nhas equal rights against gratuitous assault by people just seeking fun,\nwhatever the local people's shared beliefs on this matter happen\nto be. At any rate, we can identify clear exemplars of theorists who\nregard equality of a certain sort as a timeless unchanging moral\nrequirement. John Locke holds that everyone at all times and places has\nequal natural moral rights that all of us ought always to respect\n(Locke 1690). The contemporary moral philosopher Thomas Scanlon holds\nthat all people everywhere equally have the moral right to be treated\naccording to the outcome of a procedure: what constitutes morally right\nand wrong action is set by the principles that no one could reasonably\nreject (Scanlon 1998). It is a further question, to what extent this\nprocedure issues in different non-rejectable principles in different\ntimes and places featuring different circumstances. \n\nEgalitarianism can be formulated with a variety of roles in mind.\nFor example, an egalitarian norm might be proposed as a fundamental\nmoral principle. As such, it would be intended as a statement of the\nultimate norm (or as a member of the set of ultimate norms) to which\nindividual conduct and institutional arrangements ought to conform. An\nultimate norm might or might not be suitable for the role of guiding\nindividual decision making or of serving as an explicitly recognized\nprinciple regulating institutions and public policy formation in a\nparticular society. If individual agents and public officials are\nliable through limited cognitive ability, limited knowledge, or limited\nallegiance to morality to misapply ultimate principles, it might well\nbe the case that these principles could be implemented to a greater\ndegree if they were not employed directly as decision-making guides for\nindividual and public policy choice. (On this issue, see Hare 1981).\nFollowing this train of thought, one might favor as guidelines for\nindividual and public choice simple, easily understood, readily\nimplementable rules that are to serve as proxies for the moral\nprinciples that are the ultimate norms. Or one might instead hold that\nthe ultimate moral principles that fix what is right and wrong are well\nsuited to be practical decision making guides. The point is merely that\nwe should distinguish these distinct roles that moral norms might play\nand avoid criticizing a norm in one role by standards appropriate only\nif the norm is understood to be playing a different role. \n\nEgalitarianism might be upheld as a moral requirement, a component\nof what we fundamentally owe one another, or as morally optional, a\ndesirable ideal that we might permissibly decline to pursue. When\naffirmed as morally required, egalitarianism typically figures in a\ntheory of justice. For the most part the discussion in this entry\nconcentrates on egalitarianism as a morally required component of\njustice, but in considering arguments against a version of\negalitarianism, it is worthwhile keeping in mind the possibility that\nthe norm in question is morally desirable but not morally\nmandatory. \n\nGiven some specification of the kind of equality that is under\nconsideration, it is clear what it means to say of a number of people\nthat they are equal in the stated respect. If we are concerned with\nequal utility, then a group has equal utility when all have exactly the\nsame. If we are concerned with equality of dollar holdings, then people\nare equal when all hold exactly the same number of dollars. But saying\nthis does not yet suggest a way of determining, in general, whether\ninequality is greater in one situation than in another, when different\npeople hold different amounts of the good that we are concerned to\nequalize in the two situations. Inequality can be measured in different\nways, and no measure seems to be strongly supported by common sense\nintuition about the meaning of equality. (See Sen 1997 and Temkin\n1993). This entry usually abstracts from this issue by supposing that\nwe can unequivocally determine, for any ideal of equality, how to\nmeasure degrees of inequality across the board. \n\nIn a hierarchical caste society, positions of advantage are assigned\nto people on a basis of birth lineage. If one is a legitimate offspring\nof parents who are aristocrats, one will also enjoy the privileges of\naristocratic rank. A historically important form of equality associated\nwith the rise of competitive market economies is the ideal of equality\nof opportunity. This ideal is also known as formal equality of\nopportunity or careers open to talents. \n\nEquality of opportunity requires that jobs in economic firms and\noptions to borrow money for investment purposes such as starting a\nbusiness should be open to all applicants, that applications be\nassessed by relevant criteria of merit, and that the top-ranked\napplicant should be offered the job or option to borrow. The relevant\ncriteria of merit are to be set so that those who score highest are\nthose whose selection would best further the morally innocent purposes\nof the enterprise. In competitive market settings, the presumption\ntypically is that the criteria should be related to profitability. The\nbest applicant for a job or a loan would then be the individual to whom\noffering the good in question produces the greatest increase in the\nfirm's expected profit. (If the firm's owners are risk averse or risk\nseeking, the pertinent criterion would be expected profit weighted by\ntheir risk preferences.) A further aspect of the ideal of equality of\nopportunity requires that economic firms offering goods and services\nfor sale should sell to all willing customers, treating all potential\ncustomers evenhandedly as potential sources of profit. Finally,\nequality of opportunity requires that purchasers of goods and services\nshould be responsive only to the price and quality of the goods offered\nto them for purchase (and not, for example, to the ethnicity or sex or\nsexual orientation of the maker or seller of the good). This\nlast-mentioned requirement of equality of opportunity might not be\nincluded within formulations of the norm that are intended to be\nenacted as law and enforced by criminal or civil law procedures. But to\nimplement equality of opportunity, an orientation of the hearts and\nminds of members of society is needed, not merely legal enactments.\nEquality of opportunity would be subverted if the laws effectively\nprohibited economic firms from basing decision making on factors other\nthan expected profitability but consumers would not purchase products\nthat embodied the skilled labor of women and blacks, so that their\nmarket opportunities are stunted. Moreover, the law might indeed\nrequire firms to hire the best qualified applicant, meaning the one\nbest able to perform the role being filled, even if hiring the best\nqualified in this sense would not be profit-maximizing, due to\nrecalcitrant consumer prejudice. \n\nTwo natural extensions of the equality of opportunity ideal deserve\nmention. One is the requirement that student slots in colleges and\nuniversities and competitive private schools should be open to all\napplicants with applicants ranked by their ability to learn and other\nacademic virtues and selected on these academic grounds (provided they\ncan pay the tuition and fees). A second extension requires that public\nsector jobs—other than those reserved for elected officials along\nwith their staffs—should be open to all applicants with selection\nof applicants being made on the basis of the merits of the\napplications. \n\nThe general idea of equality of opportunity is that the political\neconomy of a society distributes positions that confer special\nadvantages and these should be open to all applicants with applicants\nselected by merit. The merits of the applications for a position should\ntrack the degree to which the applicant's hiring or selection for\ninteraction would boost the fulfillment of the morally innocent\npurposes of the association as weighted by the association's bosses.\nThe more general formulation of the notion of merit allows that an\neconomic firm might legitimately base its decisions on nonmarket values\nwithout engaging in wrongful discrimination that violates equality of\nopportunity rightly construed. For example, a maker of fancy surfboards\nmight sell them by preference to more skilled surfers, and a\nmountaineering guide might select clients partly on the basis of their\nphysical fitness and their perceived enthusiasm for wilderness\nadventure. Also, members of the learned professions such as medicine\nand law might be bound by legal and cultural norms that require them to\ntailor their services to the aims of the profession rather than just to\nprofitability (e.g., norms that require a medical doctor to refuse to\nprovide a medical treatment to a potential client who is willing and\nable to pay but would not benefit from the treatment). \n\nThe ideal of equality of opportunity is the ideal of a political\neconomy in which each person's prospects as producer depend only on his\ninitial stock of resources plus his ability and willingness to provide\ngoods and services that others value plus luck as market fluctuations\nare encountered. Moreover, in the role of consumer, each individual\n(modulo his location) faces the same array of goods and services on\nsale to anyone who can pay the purchase price (and can satisfy the\nrelevant nonmarket conditions of the seller or maker). Such\ncharacteristics of persons as their supposed race, skin color,\nethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, and religion play no role in\ndetermining one's life prospects in this public sphere except insofar\nas these traits might happen to affect one's abilities and willingness\nto offer what others are willing to exchange for money. \n\nIn theory, equality of opportunity could be fully satisfied in a\nsociety in which wealth passed along by inheritance from generation to\ngeneration fundamentally determines everyone's competitive prospects.\nIn this society jobs and positions and so on would be open to all\napplicants, but the only applicants who have the skills that qualify\nthem for desirable posts are the children of the wealthy. They alone\nhave access to the training and acculturation that confer skills. \n\nA society that establishes and maintains a state educational system\nsustained by public funds already goes some way beyond equality of\nopportunity and toward provision to all of its members of some\nopportunity to develop skills that will enable them to succeed in\ncompetitions for desirable positions regulated by equality of\nopportunity. The same can be said of a society that enforces minimal\nstandards of child rearing to which parents must conform. One can\nimagine a society doing more in this same spirit. \n\nA society might institute policies that secure at least a minimally\nacceptable threshold of schooling and skill formation for all its\nmembers. An alternative aim is to eliminate entirely the advantages\nthat family wealth and social status confer on individuals in\ncompetitions regulated by formal equality of opportunity. The\nachievement of this aim would render a society classless, in a certain\nsense. John Rawls (1999, 63; 2001) has formulated this ideal as a\nprinciple of fair equality of opportunity (FEO). This principle holds\nthat any individuals in society with the same native talent and\nambition should have the same prospects of success in competition for\npositions that confer special benefits and advantages. FEO goes beyond\nequality of opportunity by requiring that all efforts by parents to\ngive their children a comparative advantage in competitions for\ndesirable positions and posts are somehow entirely offset. In a society\nregulated by FEO, socialization is adjusted so that among people\nequally willing to work to become qualified for a particular career and\nequally endowed by genetic inheritance with latent ability needed for\nthat career, all have the same chances of success in that career. \n\nFEO also opposes racial and sexual and similar prejudices that work\nto deprive disfavored individuals from enjoying opportunities to become\nqualified so that they would benefit from formal equality of\nopportunity. In some settings, affirmative action policies that aim to\nhelp members of historically disadvantaged groups such as\nAfrican-Americans in the U.S. gain desirable employment opportunities\nin proportion to their numbers in the population can be regarded as\npolicies intended to move society in the direction of satisfying\nFEO. \n\nFormal equality of opportunity, in so far as it imposes requirements\non firms, universities and colleges, and government as employer, is the\nlaw of the land in many modern democracies, and also entrenched in the\ncommon-sense morality most people embrace. By contrast, fair equality\nof opportunity is a controversial principle, which no existing nation\nseriously strives to achieve or comes close to achieving. \n\nFEO could not be fully achieved without conflict with other values.\nConsider that parents naturally want to help their children develop the\ntalents needed for competitive success. Some parents control a lot of\nresources useful for this purpose; some parents have few such\nresources. The ordinary interaction of parents with their children is\nthen an obstacle to the achievement of fair equality of opportunity. If\nsociety were fully to achieve FEO, then either parental freedom to help\ntheir children in ways that give them a competitive edge would have to\nbe curtailed or such help would have to be exactly offset by\ncompensating infusion of social resources toward the education and\nsocialization of children whose parents are less effective. (See\nFishkin 1983 and Brighouse and Swift 2009). \n\nA society that satisfied the ideal of formal equality of opportunity\nmight provide grim conditions of life for those who are unsuccessful in\ncompetitions for positions of advantage. Even a perfect meritocracy\nthat satisfies the stringent Rawlsian fair equality of opportunity\nprinciple might impose the same grim conditions of life on those who\nlack marketable merit and skill. The class of competitive losers might\ninclude some who have adequate native talents but fail to make good use\nof them, but some of the losers will be those with the bad luck to be\nborn without much by way of native talent. The question then arises\nwhether any further substantive ideals of equality, beyond meritocratic\nideals, should be affirmed. (See Schar 1967.) \n\nOne family of substantive equality ideals, equality of democratic\ncitizenship and civil liberties, is perhaps no more controversial than\nformal equality of opportunity. Democratic equality embraces the norm\nthat law-makers and top public officials should be selected in\ndemocratic elections. All mentally competent adult citizens should be\neligible to vote and run for office in free elections that operate\nagainst a backdrop of freedom of speech and association, and in which\nall votes count equally and majority rule prevails. All citizens should\nhave the same wide rights to freedom of speech, assembly, association,\nand religious practice. Criminal justice rules should be applied\nevenhandedly to all and should embody the procedural values of the rule\nof law. \n\nA controversial extension of democratic citizenship resembles\nRawlsian equality of fair opportunity applied to the political arena.\nCall this ideal “equal participation.” Equal participation requires\nthat any individuals in society with the same ambition to influence the\npolitical process and the same talents of political persuasion and\norganization should have equal prospects of influence on the democratic\npolitical process. (See Rawls 2005, Lecture VIII, Christiano 1996 and\n2008, Walzer 1983, for a criticism, Estlund, 1999, and for a related\nview, J. Cohen 1989a.) \n\nThe remainder of this section surveys several proposals as to what\n(beyond democratic citizenship and civil liberties) should be\ndistributed equally among the members of society and how equality and\ninequality in the distribution of these goods should be measured. The\nlatter issue can be posed in this way: When various amounts of\nheterogeneous goods are held by different individuals, how can one\nmeasure individuals' overall holdings of goods so that it can be\ndetermined when people's overall holdings are effectively equal? \n\nThe Lockean rights approach is so named because an early prominent\nexponent of the doctrine was John Locke (Locke 1690). It might just as\nwell be viewed as a rejection of egalitarianism rather than as a\nversion of it. Contemporary Lockeans are also known as libertarians\n(see Nozick 1974). \n\nThe Lockean view is that every person has equal basic moral\nrights—natural rights. Natural rights are rights that one has\nindependently of institutional arrangements, people's subjective\nopinions, and cultural understandings. A person's natural rights give\nher a set of claims against all other persons that each person\nabsolutely must respect. Our understanding of a particular rights claim\nor type or rights claim increases if we can determine whether or not it\nis forfeitable, waivable by the bearer, and transferable. \n\nThe traditional content of Lockean rights is roughly as follows:\nEach person has the right to do whatever she chooses with whatever she\nlegitimately owns so long as she does not violate the rights of others\nnot to be harmed in certain ways—by force, fraud, coercion,\ntheft, or infliction of damage on person or property. Each person has\nthe right not to be harmed by others in the mentioned ways, unless she\nvoluntarily waives any of her rights or voluntarily transfers them to\nanother or forfeits them by misconduct. Also, each adult person is the\nfull rightful owner of herself and each child person has the right to\nbe nurtured to adult status by those responsible for her creation. It\nis generally supposed in the Lockean tradition that starting from the\npremise of self-ownership, under actual conditions on earth one can\nvalidly derive strong rights of private appropriation and ownership of\nland and moveable parts of the earth (Nozick, 1974). \n\nProperty ownership of a thing comprises a bundle of rights, the\ncentral ones being the right to exclude others from the use of the\nthing and to control its use oneself. If I own my body, I can exclude\nothers from using it, and I have the right to decide its movements and\ncontrol what may be done to it. The Lockean supposes that in a world in\nwhich self-owning persons confront unowned material resources, moveable\nand immoveable parts of the Earth, all persons initially have an equal\nright to use the resources, taking turns if there is crowding. The\nLockean supposes this free use regime is provisional. Any individual is\npermitted to claim any part of the Earth as her private property\nprovided her doing so leaves “enough and as good” for\nothers. Nozick interprets this Lockean Proviso as follows: One's\nappropriation and continued holding of a part of the Earth as\none's private property is morally permissible provided that all\npersons affected by this claim of ownership are rendered no worse off\nby it than they would have been if instead the thing had remained under\nfree use (Nozick 1974, chapter 7; compare Simmons 1992, chapter 5). (A\ndifferent account will need to be given for intellectual property,\nproperty rights in ideas.) \n\nLockean rights do not single out a state of affairs, that in which\neveryone's rights are fully respected, and hold that all people are\nobligated to act in whatever ways are needed to bring about this state\nof affairs. Each person's right generates a duty to respect that right\non the part of every other person. Rights are constraints on what each\nindividual may do, and do not set goals that all are together obligated\nto fulfill (Nozick 1974, chapter 3). \n\nA more egalitarian variant of Lockean rights doctrine combines the\nright of self-ownership with skepticism about the Lockean account of\nthe moral basis of private ownership rights. Instead the left-wing\nLockean asserts that each person is the full rightful owner of herself\nand each adult person has a right to a per capita share of ownership of\nthe unimproved land and resources of the Earth. In short, this version\nof Lockeanism combines robust self-ownership with an egalitarian\naccount of world ownership. There are several variants to this\ndoctrine. Critics explore whether or not the doctrine is normatively\nstable: Do any plausible grounds there might be for denying Lockean\nprivate ownership of the world also generate grounds for denying\nindividual self-ownership? Do any grounds there might be for insisting\non individual self-ownership also generate reasons to insist on Lockean\nprivate ownership of the world? (See Steiner 1994, G. Cohen 1995,\nVallentyne and Steiner 2000a and 2000b, and Van Parijs 1995). \n\nThe nature of the dispute between the right-wing and left-wing\nLockeans emerges into view when we consider justice across generations.\nSuppose at one time the Earth is unowned and persons alive then\nappropriate all valuable land. On the next day, new people are born.\nWhat natural rights to land do they have? The left-libertarian holds\nthat the doctrine of ownership must provide for fair treatment of each\nsuccessive generation, and this requires that each new person has a\nright to an equal share of the value of unimproved resources or to some\nsimilar entitlement. The right-libertarian holds that the Lockean\nProviso fully accommodates the legitimate claims of new persons. On\nthis view, there is no fundamental right to an equal share in any\nsense. Luck plays a legitimate role in the operation of a natural\nrights regime. Granted, it is bad luck for me if I am born uncharming\nand lacking in good lucks and others are not voluntarily willing to\nenter into romance or friendship with me, but my distressed condition\ndoes not tend to show that my rights have been violated. And granted,\nit is bad luck for me if I come late on the scene and those who came\nfirst happen to be far better off in material wealth prospects than I,\nbut the fact that there are unequal prospects does not tend to show\nthat my rights have been violated. Provided the Lockean proviso is\ncontinuously satisfied and the appropriations by others leave me no\nworse off than I would have been under continued free use, my being\nworse off than others gives me no moral complaint against their\nproperty holdings. \n\nThe Marxian tradition in political and economic thought urges the\ndesirability of eliminating some of the inequalities associated with\nthe institutions of a capitalist market economy. Interpreting Karl\nMarx as an egalitarian normative theorist is a tricky undertaking,\nhowever, in view of the fact that he tends to eschew explicit\nnormative theorizing on moral principles and to regard assertions of\nmoral principles as so much ideological dust thrust in the eyes of the\nworkers by defenders of capitalism. Marx does, of course, have an\nelaborate empirical theory of the evolution of moral principles\ncorresponding to changes in the economic mode of production. \n\nIn “The Critique of the Gotha Program,” Marx asserts that in the first\nphase of communist society the economy will distribute goods according\nto the norm, to each according to his labor contribution.  This norm\ncan be regarded as defining an equal right, but like any such right,\nit is defective. One defect is that some individuals are naturally\nmore able than others, and so the amount of one's labor contribution\nwill vary depending on factors that vary by luck beyond one's power to\ncontrol. For this and other reasons Marx asserts it will be desirable\nto discard this norm when a higher phase of communist society is\nattained. Then society can move beyond the sphere of bourgeois right\naltogether and operate according to the norm, from each according to\nhis ability, to each according to his needs. Despite Marx's\ndisclaimer, he seems to be proposing a principle of equal right: Each\nhas the right to receive economic goods that satisfy her needs to the\nsame extent provided she contributes to the economy according to her\nability. But Marx would resist the description of this norm as a\nprinciple of justice or moral rights. One consideration in his mind\nmay be that moral rights ought to be enforced, but when it is feasible\nand desirable to implement higher-phase communist distribution, the\nimplementation can be carried out successfully without any legal or\ninformal coercion, and hence should not occur through any process of\nsocial enforcement. Or so Marx thinks. (See Marx 1978, Wood 1981,\nCohen, G., 1988 and 1995.) \n\nIn modern societies with market economies, an egalitarian is\ngenerally thought to be one who supports equality of income and wealth\n(income being a flow, wealth a stock). Respecting this usage, this\nentry considers an egalitarian in the broad sense to be someone who\nprefers in actual or at least non-exotic circumstances that people\nshould be more nearly equal in income and wealth and favors policies\nthat aim to bring about such equality. \n\nMoney is a conventional medium of exchange. Given an array of goods\nfor sale at various prices, with some money one has the option to\npurchase any combination of these goods, within the budget constraint\nset by the amount of money one has. What money can purchase in a given\nsociety depends on the state of its economy and also on legal and\ncultural norms that may limit in various ways what is allowed to be put\nup for sale. For example, the laws may forbid the sale of sexual\nactivity, human organs intended for transplant, the right to become a\nparent of a particular child by adoption, narcotic drugs, and so on.\nWhat money can purchase also obviously depends on what one is free to\ndo with whatever one purchases—one may catch fish with the\nfishing rod one purchases only with a license and in accordance with\nrules issued by the state agency that regulates fishing. \n\nLeaving these complications in the background, one can appreciate\nthat having money gives one effective freedom to engage in a wide\nvariety of activities and experiences. One has the option to purchase\nany of many commodities and do with them whatever is legally and\nconventionally allowed, up to the limit of one's budget. The ideal of\nequality of income and wealth is roughly the ideal that people should\nenjoy this effective freedom to the same extent. \n\nThis ideal is attractive to some and repulsive to others. One\nserious objection is that to bring about and sustain the condition in\nwhich all people have the same amount of money would require continuous\nand extensive violation of people's Lockean rights, which as standardly\nunderstood include the right to gain more property than others possess\nby gift or trade or hard work. Another, closely related objection is\nthat a regime of equal money could be maintained only by wrongful\ninterference with people's liberty, because if money is distributed\nequally at one time people will choose to act in ways that over time\nwill tend to result in unequal distribution of money at later times.\n(For the first objection, see Nozick 1974, chapter 7, for the second,\nsee Walzer 1983.) \n\nAnother objection to the ideal of monetary equality is that its\npursuit would inhibit people's engagement in wealth-creating and\nwealth-saving activity, and in the not very long run would reduce\nsociety's stock of wealth and make us all worse off in the terms of the\neffective freedom that was being equalized. Yet another objection is\nthat people behave in ways that render them more and less deserving,\nand monetary good fortune is among the types of things that people come\nto deserve differentially. \n\nThe advocate of egalitarianism in the broad sense has some replies.\nUnless some substantive argument is given as to why Lockean rights\nshould be accorded moral deference, the mere fact that equality\nconflicts with Lockean rights does not by itself impugn the ideal of\nequality. Maybe some purported “rights” should not be regarded as\nmomentous, and their sacrifice to secure equality might be acceptable\non balance. In the same vein, one might hold that the fact that\ncontinuous restriction of individual liberty is needed to satisfy some\nnorm does not by itself tell us whether the moral gain from satisfying\nthe ideal is worth the moral cost of lessened freedom. Some\nrestrictions of liberty are undeniably worth their cost, and some ideal\nof equality might be among the values that warrant some sacrifice of\nliberty. \n\nEquality might be upheld as one value among others, and increase in\nwealth or in wealth per capita may be included along with equality in a\npluralistic ethics. We may want more effective freedom (of the sort\nmoney combined with goods for sale provides), and we may also want this\nfreedom equally distributed, and then we would need to find an\nacceptable compromise of these values to deal with cases when they\nconflict in practice. Much the same might be said about the conflict\nbetween the achievement of equality of money and the distribution of\ngood fortune according to people's differential desert. \n\nMonetary equality can strike one as a misguided ideal for the\ndifferent reason that it does not deal in what is of fundamental\nimportance. The value of purchasing power, equal or unequal, depends on\nthe value of what is for sale. Imagine that the economy of a society is\norganized so it produces only trivial knick-knacks. Freedom to purchase\ntrivia is a trivial freedom, and rendering it equal does not\nsignificantly improve matters. (Critics of consumerism and consumer\nculture are moved by the idea that in actual modern societies, the\neconomy, responsive to consumer demand, is responsive to demands for\nwhat is not very worthwhile and ignores many truly important human\ngoods, that either happen to be not for sale or that by their nature\nare not suitable for sale on a market.) \n\nAnother concern about monetary equality is that purchasing power\ninteracts with individuals' personal powers and traits, and real\nfreedom reflects the interaction, which an emphasis on purchasing power\nalone conceals. Consider two persons, one of whom is blind, legless,\nand armless, while the other has good eyesight and full use of her\nlimbs. Given equal money, the first must spend his money on devices and\nservices to cope with his handicaps, while the second may purchase far\nmore of what she likes. Here equality of purchasing power seems to\nleave the two very unequal in real freedom to live their lives as they\nchoose. But the case of handicaps is just an extreme instance of what\nis always present, namely each individual has a set of traits and\nnatural powers bestowed by genetic inheritance and early socialization,\nand these differ greatly across persons and greatly affect people's\naccess to valuable ways to live. \n\nOne response to the problematic features of the monetary equality\nideal is to shift to the notion of real freedom as that which an\negalitarian morality should be concerned to equalize. Real or effective\nfreedom contrasts with formal freedom. You are formally free to go to\nCanada just in case no law or convention backed by penalties prevents\nyou from going and no one would coercively interfere if you attempted\nto travel there. In contrast, you are really or effectively free to go\nto Canada just in case this is an option that you may choose—if\nyou choose to go and seriously try to go, you will get there, and if\nyou do not choose to go and make a serious attempt to go, you do not\nget there. (One might lack formal freedom to do something yet be really\nfree to do it, if one was able to evade or overcome the legal and\nextralegal obstacles to doing that thing.) \n\nAnother response to the problematic features of the monetary\nequality ideal aims to cope with the thought that freedom of purchasing\npower may not be of great importance. The response is to characterize\nwhat we should be equalizing in terms that directly express what is\nreasonably regarded as truly important. \n\nBoth responses are present in a proposal made by Amartya Sen in\nseveral publications beginning in 1980 (see Sen 1980 and 1992 and the\nreferences cited in Sen 1992). Sen suggests that in so far as we should\nvalue equality of condition, what we should value is equal real\nfreedom, and more specifically basic functioning capability equality.\nPeople may function—do or be something—in any of a huge\nnumber of ways. Consider all of the different ways that one might\nfunction variously. Many of these are trivial or of little importance;\nset these to the side. Consider then basic functionings, functionings\nthat are essential or important for human flourishing or valuable\nagency. Consider all of the packages of functionings that an individual\nat a time is really free to choose all at once; these are one's\ncapabilities at a time. We may also consider an individual's basic\ncapabilities over the life course. The proposal is that society should\nsustain basic capability equality. (Care must be taken in identifying\nan individual's capability sets, since what others choose may affect\nthe freedom one has. One may have the option of choosing the\nfunctioning of attending college, but only if not too many persons in\none's high school cohort make the same choice.) \n\nWe might construe “basic capability” as picking out one of the\ncapabilities needed for a minimally decent life. For example, being\nable to obtain enjoyment in life and gain scientific knowledge that\nmeet threshold levels deemed “good enough” suffice to give one basic\nenjoyment and basic knowledge capabilities. Above that threshold level\nfor each capability, differences in the level of capability that people\ncan attain do not signify—they do not change the fact that\neveryone does or does not enjoy equal basic capabilities. To get equal\nbasic capability for everyone would be to get each person at or above\nthe threshold level for every one of the capabilities that are\nspecified to be necessary for a minimally decent or good enough life.\nSo understood, the basic capability proposal falls in the family of\nsufficientarian ideals; on which, see the section on “Sufficiency”\nbelow. \n\nThe capability approach to equality can be developed in different\nways depending on how basic capabilities are identified. \n\nSome theorists have explored the capability approach by tying it to\nan objective account of human well-being or flourishing. The aim is to\nidentify all of the functionings needed for human flourishing. For each\nof these functionings, the ideal is that each person should be\nsustained in the capability to engage in every one of these\nfunctionings at a satisfactory or good enough level. (See Nussbaum\n1990, 1992, and 1999.) \n\nAnother use of the capability approach ties it to the idea of what\nis needed for each person to function as a full participating member of\nmodern democratic society. Each person is to be sustained throughout\nher life, so far as this is feasible, in the capabilities to function\nat a satisfactory level in all of the ways necessary for full\nmembership and participation in democratic society. (See Anderson 1999\nand Walzer 1983.) \n\nIt should be noted that the capability approach as described so far\nmight seem to involve the assumption that anything whatever that\nreduces or expands an individual's real freedom to function in ways\nthat are valuable should trigger a response on the part of a society or\nagency that aims to establish and sustain capability equality. This\nappearance is misleading in at least two different ways. For one thing,\nSen clearly wants to allow that one's capabilities can increase\nby virtue of gaining opportunities to function even though one does not\nget real freedom to accept or decline the opportunities. Consider the\ncapability to be free of malaria, which opens many malaria-free life\noptions, when the capability is obtained by public health measures\nbeyond the power of the individual agent to control. Also, if what one\nembraces is basic capability equality for all, then by implication one\nis countenancing that there may be non-basic capabilities, providing\nwhich to all is not required. But even if we amend our conception of\ncapabilities to accommodate these points, one might still deny\nthat every reduction or threat to an individual's (basic)\ncapabilities poses a social justice issue while otherwise working\nwithin the capability framework. \n\nOne might distinguish aspects of a person's situation that are\nsocially caused from those that are naturally caused. This distinction\nis evidently rough and needs refinement, but one has some sense of what\nis intended. That I am unable to run fast or sing a tune on key may be\nlargely due to my genetic endowment, which in this context we may take\nto be naturally rather than socially caused. In contrast, the facts\nthat given the talents of others and their choices to use them in\nmarket interaction, my running ability is nonmarketable but my singing\nability enables me to have a career as a professional singer are deemed\nsocially caused. That I have a certain physical appearance is natural\n(any of a wide variety of childrearing regimens would have produced\npretty much this same physical appearance) but that my appearance\nrenders me ineligible for marriage or romantic liaisons is a social\nfact (social arrangements bring this about and different social\narrangements might undo it). Even if my natural physical appearance\nrepels any marital or romantic partners I might seek, society might\nprovide me charm lessons or cosmetic surgery or promulgate an\negalitarian norm that encourages the charming and the physically\nattractive not to shun my company (or institute some mix of these three\nstrategies or some others). \n\nHowever exactly the natural and social are distinguished, one might\nrestrict the scope of an equality ideal to the smoothing out of\nsocially caused inequalities. As Elizabeth Anderson remarks, “The\nproper negative aim of egalitarian justice is not to eliminate the\nimpact of brute luck from human affairs, but to end oppression, which\nby definition is socially imposed” (Anderson 1999, 288). What this\nrestriction amounts to depends on how one distinguishes socially caused\nfrom other inequalities. Suppose that society pursues policy A, and\nthat if it pursued policy B instead, a given inequality across people\nwould disappear. Does this fact suffice to qualify the inequality as\nsocially caused or not? \n\nCritics of the capability approach home in on three of its features. \n\nThe starting point of the capability approach is that the equality\nthat matters morality or that we are morally required to sustain is\nequality of freedom of some sort. This starting point is open to\nchallenge. Freedom is no doubt important as a means to many other\ngoods and as something everyone cares about to some considerable\nextent. But why confine the concern of equality to freedom rather than\nto achieved outcomes? Suppose that we could supply resources to Smith\nthat will expand her freedom to achieve outcomes she has good reason\nto value, but we happen to know that this freedom will do nobody any\ngood. She will neglect it and it will be wasted. In these\ncircumstances, why supply the resources? If provision of freedom for\nits own sake is morally of first-priority importance, then the fact\nthat freedom in this instance will do nobody any good would seem to be\nan irrelevant consideration. If this fact seems highly pertinent to\nwhat we should do, this indicates that freedom may not be the ultimate\nvalue the distribution of which is the proper concern of an equality\nideal. (A version of this objection can be lodged by advocates of any\ntype of doctrine of equality of outcome against any type of doctrine\nof equal opportunity for outcomes.) \n\nAnother feature of the capability approach as elaborated to this point\nis that it does not appear to register the significance of personal\nresponsibility as it might appropriately qualify the formulation of an\nequality ideal (Roemer 1996 and 1998). A simple example illustrates\nthe difficulty. Suppose society is dedicated to sustaining all of its\nmembers equally at some level of basic capability. Society provides\nresources fully adequate for sustaining an individual at this level of\nbasic capability, but he frivolously and negligently squanders the\nresources. The resources are re-supplied, and squandered again, and\nthe cycle continues. At some point in the cycle, many people would\nurge that the responsibility of society has been fulfilled, and that\nit is the individual's responsibility to use provided resources in\nreasonable ways, if his lack of adequate basic capability is to\nwarrant a claim to equality-restoring social intervention. The\ncapability approach could of course be modified to accommodate\nresponsibility concerns. But it will be useful to turn to\nconsideration of the resourcist approach, within which the aim of\nintegrating equality and responsibility has prompted various\nproposals.  \n\nA third feature of the capability approach that has elicited\ncriticism is the idea that knowledge of human flourishing and what\nfacilitates it must inform the identification of an adequate equality\nnorm. The worry in a nutshell is that in modern societies that secure\nwide freedoms, people will embrace many opposed conceptions of how to\nlive and of what is choiceworthy in human life. These are matters\nabout which we must agree to disagree. At least if an ideal of\nequality is being constructed to serve in a public conception of\njustice that establishes basic terms of morality for a modern\ndemocratic society, this ideal must eschew controversial claims about\nhuman good and human flourishing such as those in which the capability\napproach must become embroiled. Martha Nussbaum explores how the\ncapability approach to social equality might function appropriately as\na public conception of justice (Nussbaum 2000). Charles Larmore argues\nthat it is wrong for government to impose a policy that could only be\njustified by appeal to the claim that some controversial conception of\nthe good is superior to another (Larmore 1987 and 1996; for criticism\nof the neutrality requirement, see Raz 1986 and Sher 1997). In\nresponse it might be urged that a conception of human capabilities\nmight be controversial but true and, if known to be true,\nappropriately imposed by government policy. \n\nThe ideal of equality of resources can be understood by recognizing\nits primary enemies. These enemies comprise all manner of proposals\nthat suppose that in so far as we should care about equality of\ncondition across persons, what we should care about equalizing is some\nfunction of the utility or welfare or well-being or good that persons\nattain over the course of their lives. (There is a complication here,\nbecause the resource-oriented approach also opposes the capability\napproach, which so to speak stands midway between resources and\nwelfare. This raises the question whether the capability approach is\nan unstable compromise (see Dworkin 2000, chapter 7). This issue\nsurfaces for discussion eleven paragraphs down in this section.) John\nRawls offers an especially clear statement of the animating impulse of\nthe equality of resources ideal. He imagines someone proposing that\nthe relevant measure of people's condition for a theory of justice is\ntheir level of plan fulfillment or attained satisfaction, and responds\nthat his favored conception “takes a different view. For it does not\nlook behind the use which persons make of the rights and opportunities\navailable to them in order to measure, much less to maximize, the\nsatisfactions they achieve. Nor does it try to evaluate the relative\nmerits of different conceptions of the good. Instead, it is assumed\nthat the members of society are rational persons able to adjust their\nconceptions of the good to their situation.” (See Rawls 1971, section\n15.) Resourcist ideals of equality of condition are non-welfarist. \n\nSeveral thoughts are intertwined here. One is that equality of\ncondition must be developed as a component of an acceptable theory of\njustice, intended to be the basic charter of a democratic society and\nacceptable to all reasonable members of such a society, who are\npresumed to be disposed to disagree interminably about many ultimate\nissues concerning religion and the meaning and worth of human life\n(Rawls 2005). We must seek reasonable terms of cooperation that people\nwho disagree about much can nonetheless accept. If there is anything\nthat people cannot reasonably be expected to agree about, it is what\nconstitutes human good, so introducing a controversial conception of\nhuman good as part and parcel of the ideal of equality that is to be at\nthe core of the principles of justice is a bad mistake. \n\nAnother thought is that responsible individuals will consider\nthemselves to have a personal obligation, which cannot be shifted to\nthe government or any agency of society, to decide for themselves what\nis worthwhile in human life and what is worth seeking and to fashion\n(and refashion as changing circumstances warrant) a plan of life to\nachieve worthwhile ends. So even if the true theory of human good could\nbe discovered, it would offend the dignity and sense of responsibility\nof individual persons for some agency of society to preempt this\nindividual responsibility by arranging matters so that everyone\nachieves human good understood a certain way to a sufficiently high\ndegree. Individuals should take responsibility for their ends. (See\nRawls 1971, Rakowski 1992, Dworkin 2000, and for a different view,\nFleurbaey 2008). \n\nAnother thought that motivates the family of equality-of-resources\nideals is that society's obligations by way of providing for its\nmembers are limited. A just and egalitarian society is not plausibly\nheld to be obligated to do whatever turns out to be necessary to bring\nit about that their members attain any given level or share of quality\nof life. The reason for this is that the quality of life (the degree to\nwhich one attains valuable agency and well-being goals) that any\nindividual reaches over the course of her life depends on many choices\nand actions taken by that very individual, so to a considerable extent,\nthe quality of life one reaches must be up to oneself, not the job of\nsociety or some agency acting on behalf of society. Along these lines,\nthe actual course of an individual's life and the degree of fulfillment\nit reaches also depend on many chance factors for which nobody can\nreasonably be held accountable. Justice is a practical ideal, not a Don\nQuixote conception that aims to correct all bad luck of any sort that\nbefalls persons. A reasonable morality understands the social justice\nobligations of society as limited, not open-ended and unbounded. So if\nequality of condition is part of social justice, it too must reflect an\nappropriately limited conception of social responsibility. Equality of\nresources fills this bill. (See Daniels 1990 and chapters 3 and 4 of\nBuchanan et al. 2000.) \n\nThe trick then is to develop an appropriate conception of resources\nthat can serve in an ideal of equality of condition. \n\nResources can be external, material goods, such as land and moveable\nproperty. One can also extend the domain, and consider traits of\npersons that are latent talents or instruments that help them to\nachieve their ends as also included within the set of resources to be\nequalized. Extending the domain in this way will introduce complexity\ninto the account, because personal talents are attached to persons and\ncannot simply be transferred to others who lack talent. What one can do\nis take people's variously valuable personal talents into account\nin determining how material resources should be distributed so as to\nachieve an overall distribution that should register as (sufficiently)\nequal. If Smith lacks good legs, this personal resource deficit might\nbe offset by assigning Smith extra resources so he can buy a wheelchair\nor other mobility device. \n\nNotice that in elaborating equality of resources, it is assumed that\na population of individuals with given traits, generated by genetic\ninheritance and early socialization, is present, and equalization is to\nproceed by adjusting features of the individuals' environment or by\naltering features of the individuals, say by extra education. But of\ncourse, moral questions may also be raised about the processes by which\nindividuals come to be born and given early socialization so as to\nendow them with certain traits. With genetic information about an\nindividual made available to prospective parents before the individual\nis born, a decision can be made about whether to bring this child to\nterm. In the future, genetic enhancements may be available that can\nalter the genetic makeup of individuals, and again a morality must\nconsider when enhancements should be supplied and by whom. Raising\nthese questions makes it evident that just assuming an initial\npopulation of individuals with given traits takes for granted matters\nthat are very much morally up for grabs (see Buchanan et al. 2000). For\nthe purposes of this entry, this complication is noted only to be set\naside. \n\nHow can resources be identified and rated? We want to be able to\nsay, given two persons each with different amounts of resources, which\none has more resources overall. The literature to date reveals two ways\nof confronting the question. One has been developed by John Rawls\n(Rawls 1971), one by Ronald Dworkin (Dworkin, 2000). \n\nRawls suggests that the conception of resources to be deployed in a\nresourcist ideal of equality is primary social goods. These are defined\nas distributable goods that a rational person prefers to have more\nrather than less of, whatever else she wants. (A variant conception\nidentifies them as goods that any rational person would want who gives\npriority to her interests in (1) cooperating with others on fair terms\nand (2) selecting and if need be revising a conception of the good and\na set of life aims along with pursuing the conception and the aims.) On\nthis approach it is not so far clear how to measure a person's holding\nof social primary goods overall if there are various primary goods and\none has different amounts of the different kinds. The primary goods\napproach has yet to be developed in detail. Rawls has suggested that\nthe scope of this problem of devising an index of primary goods is\nlessened by giving some primary goods, the basic liberties, priority\nover the rest. For the remainder, Rawls suggests that the relative\nweight of primary goods can be set by considering what people (regarded\nas free and equal citizens) need. (See Rawls 2001, section 17.) \n\nRawls does not propose the primary goods approach as adequate to\nguide us in figuring out what egalitarianism requires by way of\ncompensation for those with serious personal talent deficits. His\naccount assumes that we are dealing with normal individuals who enjoy\ngood health and have the normal range of abilities. In his account, the\nproblem of deciding what an egalitarian approach requires by way of\nhelping (for example) the disabled is to be handled separately, as a\nsupplement to the primary goods account. \n\nThe problem of the handicapped is the tip of the iceberg according\nto the capabilities approach advocate. All people vary enormously in\ntheir personal traits, and these traits interact with their material\nresources and other features of their circumstances to determine what\neach one is able to do and be with a given resource share. Since we\ncare about what we can do and be with our resources, merely focusing\nattention on the resources as the primary goods advocate does is\ninherently fetishistic. The Rawlsian focuses on the distribution of\nstuff, but we do not care about the distribution of stuff except\ninsofar as the stuff distribution affects the distribution of\ncapability or real freedom. This is in a nutshell the capability\napproach criticism of primary goods forms of resourcism. \n\nTo some this critique of resourcism appears unstable. The capability\ntheorist criticizes the resourcist for tying the idea of just\ndistribution to the idea of fair shares of resources, but resources are\nnot what ultimately matter to us. But this criticism can be turned\nagainst the capability theorist. Ultimately each of us wants to lead a\ngood, choiceworthy life, one that is rich in fulfillment, and not\nmerely to lead a life that has as its backdrop lots of options or\ncapabilities among which one can choose. One wants a good life, not\njust good options. More options in some circumstances might predictably\nlead to a worse life. With a moderate level of resources (or\ncapabilities) I might live well, whereas with more resources (or\ncapabilities) I might choose heroin or methamphetamine and live badly.\nUltimately we are concerned with welfare (living well) and only\nsecondarily with capabilities (abilities and opportunities to live\nwell). In this light, from the welfarist standpoint, the capability\napproach looks fetishistic, just as from the capability standpoint, the\nprimary goods approach to the measure of people's condition for\npurposes of deciding what constitutes an equal (or more broadly, a\nfair) distribution looks to be fetishistic. (The worry that the\ncapabilities approach is an unstable compromise, without endorsement of\nthe welfarist alternative, is voiced in Dworkin 2000, chapter 7.) \n\nThe Rawlsian will reply that it is not the proper business of\ngovernment to be rating and assessing people's personal traits as\nthe capabilities approach and welfarist approaches require. Respect for\npersons dictates that the state must respect its citizens by not\nlooking beyond resource shares to assess what individuals can do with\nthem and actually do with them (Carter 2011). \n\nDworkin's approach begins with the idea that the measure of a\nresource that one person holds is what others would be willing to give\nup to get it. From this standpoint competitive market prices are the\nappropriate measure of the resources one possesses: In particular, the\ndivision of a lot of resources among a group of people is equal when\nall are given equal purchasing power for the occasion and all the\nresources are sold off in an auction in which no one's bids are final\nuntil no one wants to change her bids given the bids of the others. \n\nThis equal auction is just a first approximation to Dworkin's\nproposal. Two complications need to be introduced. One is that one\nought to extend the domain of resources to include personal talents as\nwell as external property. A second is that equality of resources as\nconceived in this construction supposes that the results of unchosen\nluck, but not chosen option luck, should be equalized. \n\nTake the second wrinkle first. If we start from an initial equality\nof resources brought about by the equal auction mechanism, individuals\nmight then go on to use and invest and spend their resource allotments\nin various ways. Assume the rules mediating their interaction are set\nand morally unproblematic. Roughly speaking, we say people are free to\ninteract with others on any mutually agreeable terms but not to impose\nthe costs of their activities on others without the mediation of\nvoluntary consent. Starting from an initial equality of resources, any\nresults that issue from voluntary interactions reiterated over time do\nnot offend against the equality ideal. Let voluntary choice and chosen\nluck prevail. \n\nThe first wrinkle is that individuals differ in their unchosen\nnatural talent resource allotments. These should somehow be equalized.\nBut how? The Dworkin proposal is that we can in thought establish an\ninsurance market, in which people who do not know whether they will be\nborn disabled (afflicted with negative talents) and do not know what\nmarket price their positive talents will fetch, can insure themselves\nin a variant of the equal purchasing power auction against the\npossibility of being handicapped or having talents that fetch low\nmarket price. In this way in thought unchosen luck is transformed into\nmorally inoffensive chosen luck (so far as this is thinkable). \n\nThe final Dworkin proposal then is that the thought experiment of\nthe equal auction modified as above is used to estimate in actual\ncircumstances in a rough and ready way who is worse off and who better\noff than others through no choice of her own. A tax and transfer policy\nis instituted then that tries to mimic the results of the imaginary\nequal auction and hypothetical insurance market. To the extent that we\nestablish and sustain such policies—voila!—we have equality\nof resources across the members of an actual society. (See Dworkin\n2000). \n\nThe Dworkin proposal is noteworthy for its integration of themes of\nequality and personal responsibility in a single conception. But the\nmoral appropriateness of linking these themes in the particular way\nthat he espouses is open to question. \n\nOne concern arises from the theoretical role that hypothetical\ninsurance markets are to play in the determination of what is to count\nas equality of resources. This role assumes increasing prominence in\nDworkin's later work (Dworkin 2000, chapters 8–13; also Dworkin\n20–11, Part 5, especially chapter 16). Dworkin eventually defines the\nequal distribution of privately held resources as the one that would\nissue from an initial auction in which all have equal bidding power to\npurchase materials resources, supplemented by hypothetical insurance\nmarkets against the possibility of suffering the bad brute luck of\nhandicap or low marketable talent. From then on, ordinary market\nrelations govern relations among individuals, and their upshot does not\nimpugn the equality of the initial staring point unless new forms of\nbrute luck intervene. For these Dworkin imagines further hypothetical\ninsurance markets, in which the appropriate compensation for\npost-initial-auction bad brute luck is set by the average level of\ninsurance that people would have purchased if they knew the incidence\nof the bad brute luck, its impact on people, and the available devices\nfor mitigating it, but not their personal chances of suffering the bad\nbrute luck. Given this background, just policies in actual societies\nshould aim to mimic the results of these hypothetical equal mechanisms.\nIn this exercise, we seek to undo the effect of brute luck but not\noption luck, that former being luck that falls on you in ways beyond\nyour power to control and the latter being luck that you can avoid, and\nmaybe reasonably avoid, by voluntary choice. \n\nNotice the transition from (1) the insurance decisions you actually\nmake to (2) the insurance decisions you would have made under imagined\nequal circumstances to (3) the insurance decisions the average member\nof society would have made under hypothetical equal circumstances. One\nmight wonder for a start why the last of these should be normative for\ndetermining what we owe to Sally, who was raised in poverty and became\nparaplegic after a ski accident. Counterfactuals about what the average\nperson would have done are arguably of doubtful relevance and\ncounterfactuals about what a particular individual would have done in\nwildly different circumstances may generally lack truth value. \n\nThe distinction between brute luck and option luck does not exhaust\nthe possibilities. Most luck is a bit of both. Option luck varies by\ndegree, but it is unclear how the determination of equality of\nresources should accommodate this fact. Moreover, the insurance\ndecisions on which Dworkin's procedures rely clearly mix together\nthe brute and option luck he wants to separate. In deciding on\nhypothetical insurance for health care one will take account of the\nlikelihood that one will engage in imprudent behavior that will affect\none's health status. \n\nOthers point out that what insurance you would have purchased\nagainst a brute luck calamity might not intuitively align with the\ndifferent notion, what compensation for suffering the calamity is\nappropriate. The simplest way to see this is that for many people,\nmoney will have more use if one is healthy and normal than if one is\nplagued with physical disability, so given a hypothetical choice to\ninsure for handicaps, one might prefer an insurance policy that gives\none less income if one is handicapped and more income if one is not.\nThe insurance decision may be reasonable but the idea that on this\nbasis we ought to be forcibly transferring wealth away from handicapped\npeople and distributing the resources to the non-handicapped is\narguably not reasonable (Roemer 2002, and for more far-reaching doubts\nabout hypothetical insurance, Fleurbaey 2008). \n\nSetting to the side the details of Dworkin's construction, we\ncan ask about the prospects of the general project he pursues. The\nstarting point, which some had considered prior to Dworkin's\ncontribution, is to consider what we should count as an equal\ndistribution when people have different goods and they have different\npreferences over these goods. The basic idea is to treat as an equal\ndistribution of resources one which no one prefers to alter—no\none prefers any other person's pile of resources to her own. This\nfairness test does not require interpersonal comparison of welfare,\nhence has an appeal if interpersonal comparison is incoherent or\nethically problematic. No-envy is not generally satisfiable, but there\nis a family of fairness norms that could be construed as egalitarian\ncriteria for assessing distributions and that is resourcist in the\nbasic sense of eschewing interpersonal welfare comparisons. Suppose we\ncan separate for each person her features for which she should be held\nresponsible and her features for which she should not be held\nresponsible. One fairness norm says that egalitarian transfers should\nnot vary depending on people's features for which they should be\nheld responsible. Another fairness norm says that people with the same\nfeatures for which they should be held responsible should be treated\nthe same. In the general case, we cannot fulfill both of these norms,\nbut a whole gamut of compromises between them can be identified and\nhave been studied (mainly by economists). The Dworkin view occupies\njust one point in a large space of possibilities. As is already\nevident, some of these criteria relax to some degree (or even entirely\ndispense with) the Dworkin insistence on personal\nresponsibility—the idea that each person is responsible for her\nchoices in the sense that no one is obligated to make good the\nshortfall in her condition if her choices turn out badly.\n(Dworkin's account has an extra wrinkle here: each person is\nresponsible for her ambitions and what flows from them, and one's\nambitions are one's desires that one is glad to have, does not\nrepudiate). The vision of personal responsibility that is integral to\nDworkin's approach does not characterize the broader family of\nresourcist distributive fairness doctrines that eschews interpersonal\nwelfare comparisons and investigates variants of the no-envy test (see\nFleurbaey 2008 for an accessible survey and somewhat skeptical\nexploration, and Varian 1974 for an early contribution). \n\nGo back to the idea that a viable account of equal distribution must\nbe appropriately sensitive to personal responsibility by dictating\ncompensation for unchosen endowments but not for ambition and choice.\nThe most far-reaching skepticism on this point denies that personal\nresponsibility can be more than instrumentally valuable, a tool for\nsecuring other values. One might hold that in a world in which human\nchoices are events and all events are caused by prior events according\nto physical laws, responsibility can make sense pragmatically and\ninstrumentally in various settings but does not really make good\nnormative sense under scrutiny. One might reach a similar result by\nnoting that even if persons are truly responsible for making some\nchoices rather than others, what we could reasonably be held\nresponsible for and what surely lies beyond our power to control run\ntogether to produce actual results and cannot be disentangled. On this\nview, if we care about equality, we should seek not\nresponsibility-modified equality but straight equality of condition,\nusing responsibility norms only as incentives and prods to bring about\nequality (or a close enough approximation to it) at a higher level of\nmaterial well-being. \n\nAnother sort of skepticism challenges whether the broad project of\nholding people responsible for their chosen luck but not for their\nunchosen luck really makes sense, because unchosen luck of genetic\ninheritance and early socialization fixes the individual's\nchoice-making and value-selecting abilities. What one chooses, bad or\ngood, may simply reflect the unchosen luck that gave one the ability to\nbe a good or a bad chooser. Suppose for example that Smith chooses to\nexperiment with cigarettes and heroin, and these gambles turn out badly\nin the form of contraction of lung cancer and long-term hard drug\naddiction. He is then far worse off than others, but his bad fortune\ncomes about through his own choice—hence is not compensable\naccording to Dworkinian equality of resources. But that Smith chooses\nthese bad gambles and Jones does not may simply reflect the unchosen\nbad luck that Smith had in his genetic inheritance and early\nsocialization. So holding him fully responsible for the fortune he\nencounters through chosen gambles may make no sense if we follow\nthrough the underlying logic of the Dworkin proposal itself. This takes\nus back to welfarist equality conceptions, which the resourcist\ntheorist wishes to steer away from at all cost (Roemer 1985 and\n1986). \n\nThe ideal of equality of welfare holds that it is desirable that the\namount of human good gained by each person for herself (and by others\nfor her) over the course of her life should be the same. Human good,\nalso known as welfare or well-being or utility, is what an individual\ngets insofar as her life goes well for herself (Parfit 1984, Appendix\nI).). This awkward phrase is meant to distinguish one's life going well\nfor oneself, as one would wish one's life to go from the standpoint of\nrational prudence, and its going well by way of producing good that\nenters the lives of other people or animals or fulfills some impersonal\ngood cause. Suppose my life in its entirety consists in sticking my\nfinger in a dike and slowly painfully freezing to death, like the\nlittle Dutch boy in the children's fable. So lived, this life produces\nlots of good for millions of people saved from flood and drowning, but\nfor me it produces no good, just slow misery. The life just imagined is\na good in the sense of morally admirable life but not a life that\ncontains much welfare or human good for the one living it. \n\nThe background thought is then that morality is concerned with the\nproduction and fair distribution of human good. Nothing else ultimately\nmatters (except animal and nonhuman person welfare, but leave these\nimportant qualifications aside). So to the extent we believe that fair\ndistribution is equal distribution, that morality requires that\neveryone get the same, what everyone should then have the same\nof is human good or welfare or well-being. \n\nTo work out this conception of equality of condition would involve\ndetermining what account of the nature of human good is most plausible.\nOne account is hedonism, which holds the good to be pleasure and\nabsence of pain. Pleasure and the absence of pain might be identified\nwith happiness, but there are alternative accounts of happiness. For\nexample, one might hold that a person is happy at a time just in case\nshe is satisfied with how her life is going at that time, and happy\nregarding her life as a whole up to now to the degree she is satisfied\nwith how her life has gone as a whole up to now. If one identifies the\ngood with happiness according to this or another construal of what it\nis to be happy, we have a non-hedonic happiness account of human good\n(Sumner 1996, Haybron 2008, and Feldman 2010). Another account\nidentifies the good with desire satisfaction or life aim fulfillment. A\nvariant of this last approach holds that the relevant aims and desires\nare those that would withstand ideal reflection with full information\nunmarred by cognitive error (such as adding two and two and getting\nfive). A quite different account supposes that the good is constituted\nby the items on a list of objectively valuable beings and doings. The\nmore the individual attains the items on the objective list over the\ncourse of her life, the better her life goes, whatever her subjective\nopinions and attitudes about such attainments might be. There are also\nhybrid views, such as that the good is valuable achievement that one\nenjoys, or that the good is getting what one wants for its own sake in\nso far as what one wants and gets is also objectively valuable (Parfit\n1984, Appendix I; Adams 1999, chapter 3). The most plausible conception\nof the ideal of equality of welfare incorporates whatever is the best\ntheory of human good or welfare. (In this connection see Griffin 1986\nand Hurka 1990.) \n\nAny such account bumps into problems concerning personal\nresponsibility and the sense that the obligations of society are\nlimited—problems already mentioned in this discussion. A society\nbent on sustaining equality of welfare would continue pouring resources\ndown the drain if worse off individuals insist on negligently\nsquandering whatever resources are expended on them in order to boost\ntheir welfare level up to the average level. One might respond to this\nresponsibility challenge by stipulating that equality is only desirable\non the condition that individuals are equally responsible or deserving:\nIt is bad if some are worse off than others through no fault or choice\nof their own. In a slogan, one might assert an ideal of equality of\nopportunity for welfare. (See Cohen 1989, Arneson 1989, and for\ncriticism Rakowski 1992, Fleurbaey 1995, Scanlon 1997, and Wolff\n1998). \n\nAnother criticism does not so much challenge the welfarist\ninterpretation of equality of condition but presses the issue, how much\nweight any such equality of condition ideal should have in competition\nwith other values. Imagine for example that some people, the severely\ndisabled, are far worse off than others, and are through no fault or\nchoice of their own extremely poor transformers of resources into\nwelfare. A society bent on sustaining equality of welfare or equal\nopportunity for welfare as a first priority would be obligated to\ncontinue transferring resources from better off to worse off no matter\nhow many better off people must then suffer any amount of welfare loss\njust so long as the pertinent welfare condition of a single still worse\noff individual can be improved even by a tiny amount. \n\nAnother criticism challenges the welfarist conceptions of equality\nof condition directly. One observes that in a diverse modern society,\nindividuals will reasonably disagree about what is ultimately good and\nworthwhile in human life. Hence no conception of welfare is available\nto serve as a consensus standard for a public morality acceptable to\nall reasonable persons. In a similar spirit, one might invoke the idea\nthat responsible individuals cannot acquiesce in the assumption of the\nresponsibility on the part of the government to determine what is\nworthwhile and choiceworthy for them, for this responsibility rests\nsquarely on each individual's shoulders and cannot legitimately be\ndislodged from that perch. (See especially Dworkin, 2000, chapter 7,\nalso Arneson 2000.) \n\nNotice that equality of welfare and equal opportunity for welfare do\nnot exhaust the welfarist egalitarian alternatives. Take the example of\na view that is oriented to equality of perfectionist achievement\n(achievement of objectively valuable achievements of a kind that make\none's life go better for oneself). One might hold that what is\nmorally valuable and ought to be promoted is equality of achievement,\nor equal opportunity for achievement, or another view along the lines\nof equal achievement of one's potential or equal opportunity to\nachieve one's potential. Say that each person has a native talent\nfor achievement. I have little native talent; you have a lot.\nEgalitarianism might be construed as requiring that so far as is\npossible, social arrangements be set so that each of us achieves, or\ncan achieve, the same percentage of his native potential over the\ncourse of her life. Everyone's ratio of actual achievement to\nnative potential for achievement should be the same. So my having the\nopportunity to achieve little, and my actually achieving little,\ncompared to you, on this conception would not necessarily offend\nagainst the egalitarian ideal (see McMahan 1996, and for the thought\nthat measurement of achievements on a single scale is chimerical, Raz\n1986). \n\nPhilosophical discussions of what should be equalized if we care\nabout equality of condition raise dust that has not yet settled in any\nsort of consensus. All the rival views canvassed encounter\ndifficulties, the seriousness of which is at present hard to\ndiscern. \n\nIt should be noted that the issue, how to measure people's condition\nfor purposes of a theory of equality, connects to a broader issue, how\nto measure people's condition for purposes of a theory of fair\ndistribution. Equality is just one of the possible views that might be\ntaken as to what fair treatment requires. (For example, the\nsufficientarian and prioritarian principles discussed in the text below\nboth admit of resourcist and welfarist and “capabilitist”\nvariants.) Any theory of distributive justice that says that sometimes\nbetter off persons should improve the situation of worse off persons\nrequires an account of the basis of interpersonal comparisons that\nenables us to determine who is better off and who is worse off. \n\nFinally, the reader might wish to test the merits of rival answers\nto the equality-of-what question by considering a social justice issue\ndifferent in character from the issues considered so far. Suppose a\nsociety is divided into two or more linguistic communities, one being\nby far the most populous. The language of the dominant community is the\nofficial language of public life, and a minority linguistic group\ndemands redress in the name of social equality. The minority group\nseeks government action to help sustain and promote the survival and\nflourishing of the minority linguistic community. For another example,\nsuppose a modern democratic society contains more or less intact\nremnants of hunter-gatherer bands who claim in the name of social\nequality the right to withdraw from the larger surrounding society and\npractice their traditional way of life and run their affairs\nautonomously. How should a society committed to an ideal of equality of\ncondition handle this type of issue? (See Kymlicka 1995, Young 1990,\nAnderson 1999, and Barry 2001.) \n\nThe discussion so far presupposes that an egalitarian holds that in\nsome respect people should get the same or be accorded the same\ntreatment. There are other possibilities. One is the idea that in an\negalitarian society people should relate to one another as equals or\nshould enjoy the same fundamental status (and also perhaps the same\nrank and power). \n\nRelational equality ideals are often coupled with the ideal of equal\ndemocratic citizenship. On this view, in an egalitarian society, all\npermanent adult members of society are equal citizens, equal in\npolitical rights and duties, including the right to an equal vote in\ndemocratic elections that determine who shall be top public officials\nand lawmakers responsible for enacting laws and public policies\nenforced on all. An ideal of social equality complements political\nequality norms. The idea is that citizens might be unequal in wealth,\nresources, welfare, and other dimensions of their condition, yet be\nequal in status in a way that enables all to relate as equals. On this\napproach, an egalitarian society contrasts sharply with a society of\ncaste or class hierarchy, in which the public culture singles out some\nas inferior and some as superior, and contrasts also with a society\nwith a dictatorial or authoritarian political system, accompanied by\nsocially required kowtowing of ordinary members of society toward\npolitical elites. \n\nFrom the standpoint of the relational equality versions of\negalitarianism, equality of condition doctrines get the moral\npriorities backward. These doctrines make a fetish of what should not\nmatter to us, or should not matter very much. A better approach is to\nlook at distributive justice issues by asking what social and\ndistributive arrangements are needed to establish and sustain a society\nof free, equal people, a society in which individuals all relate as\nequals. When the question is posed in this way, relational equality\nadvocates sometimes claim to discern a new strong case for embracing a\nsufficientarian approach to distributive justice. That some people have\nmore money than others is not an impediment to a society of equals, the\nargument goes. But if some are so poor they are effectively excluded\nfrom market society or pushed to its margins, they are in effect\nbranded as socially inferior, which offends against relational\nequality. Some philosophers argue for some restriction on the size of\nthe gap between richest and poorest that society tolerates, again as\nwhat is needed to sustain a society of equals. Others might see the\ndifference principle as required for the same purpose. Some also pleas\nfor institutional insulation of the political and some social spheres\nso as to protect these as realms of equality from the corrosive\ninfluence of economic inequality (Walzer 1983 and Rawls 2005, Lecture\nVIII). \n\nThe ideal of a just modern society as a democratic society in which\ncitizens relate as equals appears in writings by Michael Walzer on\nsocial justice (Walzer, 1983). Elizabeth Anderson and Samuel Scheffler\nboth affirm versions of relational equality and from this standpoint\ncriticize the family of views that Anderson calls “luck\negalitarian,” whose foremost exponents are perhaps G. A. Cohen\nand Ronald Dworkin (Cohen 1989, Anderson 1999, Scheffler 2010, chapters\n7 and 8, Dworkin 2000, and for responses to criticisms, Dworkin\n2003 and 2010 and Arneson 2004). According to Anderson, the luck\negalitarian holds that unchosen and uncourted inequalities ought to be\neliminated and that chosen and courted inequalities should be left\nstanding). She criticizes these views on several grounds. One is that\nthe luck egalitarian wrongly takes the aim of egalitarian justice to be\nachieving an equal distribution of stuff rather than egalitarian\nsolidarity and respect among members of society. Another is that the\npolicy recommendations implied by luck egalitarian principles are too\nharsh in their dealings with people who fare badly but are deemed\npersonally responsible for their plight (see also Fleurbaey 1995). A\nthird is that the luck egalitarian, in order to establish that people\nwho are badly off are owed equalizing compensation, must involve\ndistributive agencies in intrusive and disrespectful inquiries that\nissue in public negative assessments of people's traits as\ngrounding the conclusion that these unfortunate individuals are not\nproperly held personally responsible for their misfortune (see also\nWolff 1998). A related criticism is that luck egalitarianism adopts a\nmoralizing posture toward individual wayward choice that would make\nsense only if free will libertarianism were correct (Scheffler\n2010). \n\nA further criticism is that the luck egalitarian supposes that if we\naim to undo unchosen luck, this aim somehow provides an underlying\njustification for some form of equal distribution (Hurley 2003). It is\nnot clear that undoing the influence of unchosen luck has anything to\ndo with promoting equal distribution: consider that sometimes via\nunchosen luck people end up equally well off. A better strategy is for\nthe luck egalitarian to start with the intuitive idea that distribution\nshould be equal and then allow that this presumption for equality can\nbe taken away when people could sustain equal distribution and instead\nend up unequally well off via individual choices. Equality is deemed\nmorally valuable on the condition that inequality does not emerge from\nchoices for which people are reasonably held responsible. \n\nAnother criticism of luck egalitarianism, pressed by Scheffler and\nespecially Anderson, is that the doctrine engenders an inappropriate\nexpansion of what is deemed to be the legitimate business of the state.\nSuppose we distinguish roughly between misfortune that is imposed on\npeople by social action and social arrangements and misfortune that\njust falls on people without being imposed by anyone. The distinction\ndraws a line between inequality due to society and inequality due to\nnature. In the words of Anderson, “the proper negative aim of\negalitarian justice is not to eliminate the impact of brute luck from\nhuman affairs, but to end oppression, which by definition is socially\nimposed” (Anderson 1999). \n\nRelational equality ideals might be regarded either as required by\njustice or as not required by justice or other morally mandatory\nprinciples, rather as morally optional. Or a component of social\nequality might count as a justice requirement while another component\nis treated as a part of a broader social ideal that is desirable but\nnot mandatory. \n\nThe idea of relating as equals can be construed in different ways.\nSamuel Scheffler suggests one specification when he writes that\n“we believe that there is something valuable about human\nrelationships that are, in certain crucial respects at least,\nunstructured by differences of rank, power, or status” (Scheffler\n2010, 225). The idea is that equality of rank, power, and status is\nboth instrumentally valuable and valuable for its own sake. He\nimmediately notes that such differences are ubiquitous in the social\nlife of modern industrial democracies, so equality so understood is\npuzzling. If the ideal calls on us to tear down and completely\nrestructure the social life of modern industrial democracies, it looks\nproblematic. Why accept this demand? If one qualifies and hedges the\nideal, so it is less revisionary, then the question arises, what is the\nbasis for drawing these lines of qualification and hedge. \n\nAt this point the advocate of an equality of condition doctrine in\nthe luck egalitarian range may see an opening. The advocate may urge\nthat we should regard inequalities in rank, power, and status not as\ndesirable or undesirable in themselves but in purely instrumental\nterms, as means or impediments to fundamental justice goals, the ones\nidentified by the best version of luck egalitarianism. For example, a\nwelfarist luck egalitarian will say that the inequalities in rank,\npower, and status that we should accept are those that contribute\neffectively to promoting good lives for people, taking account of fair\ndistribution of good across individual persons. The inequalities that\nare impediments to promoting good lives for people, fairly distributed,\nwe should oppose. The luck egalitarian will add that we should\ndistinguish two different claims that might be asserted in holding that\nSchefflerian social equality is valuable. Social inequality might be\naffirmed either as morally wrong or as humanly bad, something a prudent\nperson would seek to avoid. The luck egalitarian critic of this\nrelational equality ideal is committed only to rejecting it as a\nproposal for the domain of moral right. If being on the lower rungs of\na status hierarchy were per se a way in which one's life might go\nbadly, like failing to attain significant achievement or to have\nhealthy friendships, it would register in a luck egalitarian\ncalculation of a person's situation that determines what we\nfundamentally owe one another—at least according to versions of\nluck egalitarianism that affirm a welfarist measure of people's\ncondition. \n\nScheffler makes a suggestion as to how one might incorporate into\nthe theory of justice a norm against certain inequalities of rank,\npower, and status and justify the selection of the “certain\ninequalities” that are singled out in this way. One might invoke\nthe Rawlsian political liberalism project (Rawls, 2005). In this\nproject what is rock-bottom is the idea of society as a system of fair\ncooperation among free and equal people. This idea is understood in\nphilosophically noncommittal ways so that it can plausibly command\nsupport from all of the reasonable comprehensive conceptions of the\nright and the good affirmed by members of society and also from\nreasonable individuals who affirm no such comprehensive conception. The\nprinciples of justice are the principles people committed to this idea\nof social cooperation would affirm as capturing the core of their\nintuitive pre-theoretical commitment. Norms of relational equality that\nfigure in this scheme would then qualify as principles of justice that\nall citizens of modern democracies can affirm, and to which we are\nalready implicitly committed. To evaluate this suggestion one would\nhave to examine and assess the Rawlsian political liberalism\nproject. \n\nAn alternative construal of the relational equality ideal proposes\nthat people in a society relate as equals when the society's\npolitical constitution is democratic and all members are enabled to be\nfully functioning members of democratic society (Walzer 1983, Anderson\n1999). All are fully functioning members of democratic society when all\nare able to participate to a “good enough” extent in all of\nits core institutions and practices. So understood, the relational\nequality ideal becomes a version of the sufficiency doctrine (on which,\nsee section 6.1 of this entry). \n\nRelational equality advocates usually advance their equality ideal\nas a rival to other understandings of equality including luck\negalitarianism. But these disparate equality ideals need not be\nopposed. For example, one could (1) affirm relational equality and hold\nthat in a just society people should relate as free and equal and also\n(2) affirm luck egalitarianism and hold that people should be equal in\ntheir condition (according to their holdings and attainments of\nresources, capabilities, or welfare or according to some other measure)\nexcept that people's being less well off than others is\nacceptable if the worse off could have avoided this fate by\nreasonable voluntary choice. One could uphold both ideals even if they\nsometimes conflict. One could also mix and match elements of these\ndifferent equality ideals. For example, one might hold that people\nshould have equal status and relate as equals but add that one can\nlegitimately be demoted to lesser status by being responsible for\nmaking bad choices or failing to make good choices. Along this line,\neven a staunch democratic equality advocate might allow that by virtue\nof committing a serious crime and being convicted of this offense one\nforfeits some citizenship rights at least for a time. Egregiously bad\nconduct might warrant exile. Along the same line, some benefits\ndisbursed by a democratic state might be made conditional on specified\nforms of responsible choice. These moves would all involve qualifying\nthe relational equality ideal by a luck egalitarian commitment to\nappropriate sensitivity to personal responsibility. On the other side,\na luck egalitarian view might allow that in certain domains entitlement\nto equal treatment might be forfeitable by one's irresponsible\nchoice but maintain that there is a floor of democratic equality status\nto which all members of society are unconditionally entitled. Taking\nthis stance would be to qualify commitment to luck egalitarianism by a\nconstraint of insistence on some democratic equality. \n\nLuck egalitarianism could be a module or component in either a\nconsequentialist or non-consequentialist moral doctrine. Luck\negalitarianism might specify one goal or even the sole goal to be\npromoted in the former, or might be understood as a deontically\nrequired form of treatment in the latter. The same is true of the\nrelational equality ideal. That people should relate as free and equal\nmight be taken to be a goal to be promoted or an entitlement to be\nrespected. \n\nThe discussion of relational equality versus luck egalitarianism has\nstressed the relational equality critique of the luck egalitarian way\nof integrating personal responsibility concerns into the ideal of\nequality. There are other lines of potential conflict. What these are\nwill turn on the particular versions of the ideals being considered.\nFor example, consider versions of luck egalitarianism that affirm the\nidea that all should have equal opportunity for welfare as assessed\nover the life course. The advocate of views in the welfarist equality\nof condition family will worry that relational equality could be fully\nachieved world-wide even if in each society some people lead avoidably\nmiserable and squalid lives and even if in some societies people on the\naverage are far more likely to lead avoidably miserable and squalid\nlives than in other societies. In other words, the concern is that the\nrelational equality ideal pays no heed to the moral imperative of\nbringing it about that people lead genuinely good lives, or have the\nopportunity to lead genuinely good lives, while ensuring that the\nopportunities for good are fairly distributed. \n\nSettling which aspect of people's condition (if any) should be the\nsame for all and fixing a measure of people's condition in this respect\nstill does not render an ideal of equality of condition fully\ndeterminate. So far the question remains open, among whom should\nequality of condition obtain? The same question arises if one dismisses\nor downgrades the equality of condition views and takes some relational\nequality ideal to capture the core morally required egalitarian\naspiration. Among whom should equality, of whatever type is deemed\nmorally required, obtain? \n\nAt some spots the discussion to this point has assumed an answer to\nthis question. The issue is posed, in what ways should the members of a\nsociety or nation state be made equal? Framing the issue in this way\npresumes that what is morally valuable is that equality prevails among\nthe members of each separate society. The idea then is that it is\ndesirable that the condition of the inhabitants of India should be\nrendered more equal and that the condition of inhabitants of Germany\nshould be rendered more equal but that equalizing the condition of\nGermans and Indians combined need not be desirable. But why not? (On\nthis issue, see Dworkin 2000 and Rawls, “The Law of Peoples,” in Rawls\n1999.) \n\nIf equality is prized as a means to other values, it may be the case\nthat only equality among individuals who interact in significant ways\nhas a tendency to promote the desired further goals. For example, if we\nprize equality of possessions to foster social solidarity, it may be\nthat producing equality among people who live in distant parts of the\nglobe and hardly interact will have no tendency to promote solidarity\nacross the combined population. For the instrumental egalitarian, one\nshould seek equality among those collections of people in which\nequality would produce the desired further results. \n\nIf equality is valued for its own sake, rather than as a means to\nfurther goals, it is less clear why the domain of persons among whom\nequality should obtain is limited in space or time or by political\nboundaries. Why not hold that it is desirable that equality should\nprevail to the degree this is feasible among all persons who shall ever\nlive? \n\nThis question may not be rhetorical. Many philosophers hold that\nrequirements of social justice including requirements of egalitarianism\nare triggered by social interaction. When people interact in certain\nways, then and only then do egalitarian justice requirements apply and\nbecome binding on them. Call egalitarian justice theories that adopt\nthis position “social interactionist.” \n\nPerhaps the dominant view among contemporary political theorists is\nthat when people set up a wide-ranging system of coercion on the scale\nof a political nation, special moral requirements come into play,\nincluding a requirement that all whose lives are ruled by this system\nof coercion should be treated equally or brought to an equal condition\nin some respects. (If a world government were established, the special\nrequirements would be global in scope.) \n\nThis idea comes in various versions. One idea is that it makes sense\nto deploy the concept of justice—not just egalitarian justice,\nbut any justice notion—only where there is a stable scheme of\nenforcement in place, or at least the potential for that, which only\nthe framework of a functioning state supplies (Nagel 2005; for\ncriticism see Cohen and Sabel 2006 and Julius 2006). The basic thought\nis that justice norms cease to be binding if the individual cannot be\nconfident that others will comply so that the goods the scheme of\njustice promises will in fact obtain. If a bus is stalled at the bottom\nof a hill, and the passengers can work together to push it to the top\nof the hill if all cooperate together, but pushing by less than all\nproduces no gain, and there is no expectation that all the rest will\ncooperate, one has no clear duty to cooperate by doing one's\n“fair share” of pushing. But the bus example is a special\ncase, which may not generalize to illuminate the run of global justice\nissues. If some of us insist that the products we buy not be produced\nby coerced or maltreated laborers, and the result of the insistence is\nthat some laborers suffer less coercion and maltreatment, whether\nconsumers generally follow our example may not diminish or offset the\neffects of what some do. Justice might require me to join the some who\nare insisting on fair play. If there is a justice duty falling on\neconomically advanced nations to open their doors more than they now do\nto needy would-be immigrants, one country's opening its doors as\nrequired by this duty does good for the people admitted independently\nof whether or not any other advanced nations follow suit. My behaving\nin a way that emits excessive greenhouse gases may result in harm in\nthe future to some determinate persons that is caused by me and would\nnot occur but for my actions, and these facts may bring into play a\nduty of justice to refrain from wrongfully harming non-consenting\nothers. \n\nAnother view is that the state massively coerces individuals\nresiding within its claimed jurisdiction and does not to the same\nextent massively coerce those outside its territorial borders. The\nimposition of this massive coercion on individuals inside a nation is a\npresumptive violation of their autonomy, which demands a strong\njustification if state coercion is to be rightly deemed legitimate,\nmorally permissible. It is plausible to suppose the required\njustification must include acknowledgement that the state must organize\nsociety so that egalitarian principles such as the Rawlsian difference\nprinciple are satisfied. The plausibility of this claim increases once\none notices that the state might enforce any of a wide range of\nconceptions of property and criminal law and tort, and selecting one\nrather than another conception to enforce will be to the advantage of\nsome citizens and the disadvantage of others. Hence the requirement is\ntriggered to the effect that the coercive scheme must be justifiable in\nparticular to the one who fares worst under the scheme. This in turn\npoints either to a strong insistence on equality or the difference\nprinciple (Blake 2001 and Miller 1998), but the case for the insistence\nis limited in scope by the jurisdiction of the coercive scheme. \n\nA difficulty with this view is that imposition of a massively\ncoercive scheme either need pose no threat to individual autonomy or if\nit does pose a threat, does so only in circumstances in which the\nautonomy that is downgraded is worth very little. The law issues\ncredible coercive threats that if, for example, I were to murder\nsomeone, I would be arrested, prosecuted, and subjected to capital\npunishment or a long prison sentence. If I have no desire whatsoever to\nmurder anyone, the coercion sits on me light as a feather and does not\nreduce my autonomy. Suppose I developed a desire to murder someone and\nwould act to satisfy the desire except that I am deterred by the\nlaw's coercive threats. Now arguably the law significantly\nimpinges on my autonomy, but this is clearly a better state of affairs\nthan would result if the criminal law penalties against murder were\nremoved. Suppose on the other hand the law piles criminal penalties on\na type of activity that is innocent and harmless such as walking on the\nbeach. Here the coercion wrongfully restricts autonomy. The solution is\nto repeal the law. The concern then is that either the coercion imposed\non individuals by the state is morally acceptable, in which case no\nspecial compensation is owed to those coerced, or it is morally\nunacceptable, in which case the coercion should be withdrawn. The\npicture of coercion constricting the autonomy of the coerced and thus\npresumptively wrong unless compensation is paid to the coerced appears\nto be fading away. And if this picture is not sustainable, then it\ncannot help explain why equality should be required within but not\nacross national borders. \n\nThis argument will not do as it stands because there might be cases\nin which imposition of coercion is neither unconditionally right nor\nunconditionally wrong but rather conditionally\nacceptable—acceptable provided adequate compensation is paid to\nthose whose autonomy is burdened by the coercion. Are there such cases?\nPerhaps conscription of youth for military service in a just war can be\nmorally permissible, but only if compensation is paid to those coerced\ninto this arduous and dangerous service. Coercion requires a\njustification, which might include compensation to the coerced, but\nneed not in all cases. What is necessary is adequate moral\njustification. The justification of having coercive states, and the\nreason all of us ought to support them, might appeal to the need to\nhave stable protection of certain important rights of insiders (those\nwho live inside the state's borders) and outsiders as well.\nNothing so far rules out the possibility that these rights include\negalitarian rights of global scope. The sheer fact that the particular\nstate of the land you inhabit coerces you arguably does not establish\nany sort of presumption that the state's scheme of coercion must\nbe specially tailored to your interests, that those coerced have\nspecial justice claims on the particular state that coerces them. \n\nAnother possible idea in this area is that the state both massively\ncoerces its members but not outsiders and also claims to speak in the\nname of the members who are coerced. By claiming to speak in our name,\nthe state involves the will of those in whose name it claims to act.\nThe state not only does but must claim to speak in the name of those it\ncoerces; rulers of a state could not avoid the moral implications that\nflow from this claim by explaining that they are just authoritarian\nrulers, bosses who command state power and plan to rule for their own\npersonal benefit. The state compels obedience to its commands and\naffirms that these commands reflect the legitimate will of the\ncommanded subjects. The argument then is that the combination of these\nconditions triggers the application of egalitarian principles of\njustice and these principles apply state by state, not across all\nstates (Dworkin 2000 and Nagel 2005). \n\nA concern regarding this line of thought is that whenever one acts,\nwhat one does should be justifiable to those who are affected or might\nbe affected by one's choice. If what one does is justifiable, in\nprinciple anyone who is impinged on or ignored can be provided a\njustification of what is being done to them (or not being done to\nthem), a justification they can accept and will accept if they sort\nthrough the relevant considerations and assess them rightly. In this\nsense, whenever individuals make choices, their choices involve the\nwill of all those who are impinged on or might have been impinged on by\none or another choice that might have been made. And for that matter,\nbystanders who could not have been affected in any way by what is done\nbut who are aware that some individual is choosing some act or omission\nshould also be able to discern a fully adequate justification for what\nis done. The involvement of the will of those one's action\nimpinges on turns out to encompass the entire community of rational\nagents, all of whom should be able to see that what one does is\nrationally justified. So it is still mysterious how the involvement of\nthe will of those coerced by the laws and public policies of a\nfunctioning state might be thought to trigger the application of\nspecial egalitarian justice obligations that do not apply except among\nthose caught in the particular web of coercion. \n\nAnother line of thought offered to support the claim that\negalitarian justice duties apply state by state among the members of\neach political community united by a state rather than among all\ninhabitants of a region of the Earth or all of the Earth's\ninhabitants or among all rational agents anywhere and everywhere\nappeals not to state coercion but to collective goods. The suggestion\nis that the members of any tolerably well-functioning political\ncommunity cooperate together through the state to provide crucial\nbenefits to all—basic goods of physical security, property, and\nthe rule of law. In the absence of these goods one would not have a\nreasonable opportunity to pursue any plan of life. People's\ncompliance with legal rules and basic norms of cooperation supplies\nthese crucial goods to all, and thus obligations of reciprocity are\ntriggered in all recipients. At this point a luck egalitarian\nconsideration enters the argument. Factors beyond anyone's\nindividual power to control importantly affect her good fortune or bad\nfortune under the existing scheme of cooperation in her political\ncommunity; hence what one owes to other fellow cooperators by way of\nreciprocity takes the form of egalitarian justice requirements along\nthe lines of the difference principle. These egalitarian justice\nrequirements are owed by the members of each distinct political\ncommunity to each other and not to outsiders (Sangiovanni 2007). \n\nThis line of thought prompts several questions. If stringent\negalitarian duties to needy people arise only because the needy\nparticipate in a scheme of cooperation with the non-needy, then\nstrategic action to avoid the duties seems permissible. If the rich\nseparate from the poor and form their own distinct political\ncommunities, the reciprocity argument will no longer support the claim\nthat the rich have substantial obligations to the poor. One might\nquestion whether genuine justice obligations are avoidable in this way\n(Cohen and Sabel 2006). Another question is whether reciprocity\nobligations formed by cooperative collective provision nicely divide\nstate by state as the argument supposes. In Southern California, the\nlaw abidingness of neighbors in Mexico is more crucial to\npeople's physical security than the law abidingness of fellow\ncitizens in Maine or Florida. Treaties and peaceful relations among\nmilitarily armed states, brought into being by peaceable desires of\npeople in all the states, are immensely important to people's\nphysical security in all of the potentially threatening nations. A\nthird question is why reciprocity obligations owed to fellow\ncooperators in basic security schemes amount to more than the\nrequirement to contribute a fair share to the burdens of supplying the\ngoods. It is not immediately clear why requirements of egalitarian\nredistribution arise in this way, since socially disadvantaged people\nmay benefit equally as much as socially advantaged folk from the goods\nthat such cooperation supplies. \n\nThe social interactionist arguments just canvassed purport to show\nthat special egalitarian justice requirements apply among members of a\nnation state and require equality only among those members. The\narguments do not attempt to show that no egalitarian justice\nrequirements hold across national borders. These cross-border\nrequirements are presumably triggered by a morally mandatory\nbeneficence requirement that gives special priority to helping people,\nthe worse off they are, or by a luck egalitarian principle such as the\nfollowing: It is morally bad—unjust and unfair—if some are\nworse off than others through no fault or choice of their own. The\nweightier the special egalitarian obligations that the social\ninteractionist sees holding country by country, and the less weighty\nthe general egalitarianism that is perceived to hold across countries,\nthe more the social interactionist approach will conflict with general\negalitarian equality of condition doctrines that are claimed to have\nglobal scope. \n\nAnother version of social interactionism does not seek to show that\nnational borders are morally important for determining what we owe each\nother by way of egalitarian justice. This approach holds that stricter\negalitarian justice duties are gradually triggered by social\ninteraction, and become more stringent and demanding as the density of\nsocial interaction increases (Cohen and Sabel 2006 and Julius 2006, see\nalso Julius 2003). On this view, egalitarian justice duties might be\nstrongest among the members of a political community, strong among\npeople involved in dense regional trade and other forms of association,\nless strong among more far-flung inhabitants of the globe whose social\ninteraction ties are slight. \n\nA related social interactionist approach holds that egalitarian\njustice requirements come into play among people where there is a\nframework of institutions and rules or a basic social structure\nregulating their interactions. Some see such a cooperative framework\nexisting only in each separate nation state; some see a global\ncooperative framework (Beitz 1979, Pogge 1989). The background idea is\nthat justice becomes relevant when people are cooperating together for\nmutual gain under common rules. \n\nThe question, whether the requirement of equalizing people's\ncondition applies within particular societies but not across societies\non a global scale, might be thought to raise a rough dilemma for the\nnormative attractiveness of any equality ideal. The dilemma arises in\nthe following train of thought. On the one hand, there is no good basis\nfor restricting the scope of equality. If equality matters, the group\nthat should be made equal is people everywhere. On the other hand, a\nglobal equality requirement will strike many as deeply counterintuitive\nbecause it seems to impose very demanding requirements on prosperous\nindividuals and nations to share their wealth with less prosperous\nstrangers in distant lands. The dilemma paints egalitarianism as either\n(1) parochial or (2) Quixotic and utopian. To remove this impression of\ndilemma, it would suffice either to defend the restriction of\negalitarian requirements to single societies or to show that the\nrequirements of demanding global egalitarianism are not really\ncounterintuitive. \n\nFurther issues may be raised about the nature of the individuals\namong whom equality should obtain. One might hold that across whatever\nkind of group is deemed to be the relevant domain of equality,\nindividuals in the domain should be made equal in condition over the\ncourse of their lives. This view would allow that people might fare\nunequally well at different stages of life so long as their lifetimes\ntaken as a whole are identical in faring well. Another possibility is\nthat the individual persons at the same stage of the life cycle should\nbe rendered equal in condition. On this latter view, a society in which\nover time the people who are old all enjoy the same condition, and\nlikewise the people who are young and those who are middle-aged, could\nperfectly conform to the ideal of stage-by-stage equality of condition\neven if the old are (say) far better off than the middle-aged and the\nmiddle-aged are always far better off than the young. From the\nwhole-lives perspective, stage-by-stage equality is unacceptable,\nbecause some people die young, and those who die young never get to\nenjoy the peak condition. One might uphold a stringent view that\nrequires, so far as possible, that all achieve the same lifetime level\nof good and that in addition at each separate stage of life\n(individuated how?) everyone achieves the same level of good. Another\npossible view is that equality should be formulated so it demands that\nfrom now, the condition of all those living should be equalized\n(regardless of what condition people enjoyed in the past). (See\nMcKerlie 1989 and 2001 and Temkin 1993, chapter 8). \n\nAnother issue emerges if one asks: why focus on individual persons\nrather than on groups? One might hold that it is not important that\nindividual persons have equal life prospects, but it is morally\nvaluable that men and women on the whole should have equal life\nprospects, that heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals should have the\nsame life prospects, that people of different supposed races should\nhave the same life prospects on the whole, and so on. To fill out this\nproposal one would need to develop a normative account that explains\nwhat sorts of group classifications matter for this purpose and on what\ngrounds. Notice that one might be troubled, for example, if it is found\nthat men have better life prospects on the average than women, because\nthat would be an indicator that perhaps equality of opportunity and\nfair equality of opportunity are not satisfied. To be moved by this\nconsideration is not to value equality of condition across groups per\nse. \n\nFinally, the discussion in this entry assumes that if equality is\nvaluable or morally required, the equality that matters is equality\namong human persons. Equality across individual humans and individual\nmembers of other animal species has not been envisaged. But why not? If\nhuman beings are picked out as morally special, some reasonable ground\nmust be adduced for this selection. In view of the fact that there\nmight be intelligent beings who qualify as persons but are nonhuman\n(angels, intelligent extraterrestrials, and so on), perhaps we should\nfocus on persons and consider whether equality of condition should\nprevail among persons and only among persons and if so, on what basis.\nNotice that the claim that human persons share a special equal status\nfrom which less intelligent animals are excluded still allows that\nthese animals, though not equal in status to humans, may nonetheless be\nmorally considerable. \n\nWhy should it matter that people have or get the same? In previous\nsections of this entry some attempt has been made to clarify some\nprinciples that prize equality of condition of some sort. No doubt in\nsome circumstances movement toward equality of some sort can be\nexpected to increase the extent to which other values worth caring\nabout are achieved. The question here is whether the achievement of\nequality of condition of any sort matters for its own sake,\nindependently of whether it hinders or promotes the attainment of other\nvalues. \n\nWhat has been called the “leveling-down objection”\nsuggests a reason to answer in the negative: everyone's being\nequal is not valuable for its own sake. Suppose the universe contains\ntwo persons, one of whom is far better off than the other. If we can\neffect a change, perhaps by transferring resources, that will make the\nworse off person better off and make the better off person worse off,\nprovided the change does not bring it about that the formerly better\noff person is now worse off, the change will bring the people closer to\nbeing equally well off. So equality recommends the change, at least if\nother things are equal. This seems plausible. But now suppose we can\neffect a change that will make the better off person worse off without\nmaking anyone else better off, and without making it the case that the\nformerly better off person is now worse off. Perhaps the better off\nperson has a nice house, and we can burn down the house costlessly,\nmaking him worse off, but without improving the condition of anyone\nelse. This is leveling down. If equality is non-instrumentally\nvaluable, then the situation that obtains after leveling down must be\nin at least one respect better than the preceding situation: the new\nsituation is more equal. The objection simply is that it is\ncounterintuitive to claim that in any respect increasing equality by\nmaking someone worse off and no one else better off is improving the\nsituation. Leveling down is pointless or worse. \n\nAs stated, the leveling down objection invites the reply by the\negalitarian that the situation after leveling down is indeed in one\nrespect better than the situation previously obtaining: after all, we\nnow have greater equality or a closer approximation to a condition of\nequality. We may have a standoff of conflicting moral intuitions. Those\nwho doubt that equality is non-instrumentally valuable offer this\ndiagnosis. When we envisage a more equal world, we tend to think of\nchanges that make some people better off—those who before got the\nshort end of the stick now are made better off so that equality across\npersons is approached. We also tend to envisage situations in which\nthose who are worse off than others are badly off in non-comparative\nterms. In this way we tend to run together (1) people being more equal\nand (2) the worse off (who are likely badly off) becoming better off.\nBy a halo effect, the goodness of 2 appears to shine on 1. Once we see\nclearly that having equality and making gains toward equality need have\nnothing to do with 2, we see that we had all along we had been\nmisjudging the value of 1, and so our considered judgment should be\nthat it is not the case that equality of any sort is non-instrumentally\nvaluable (Parfit 1991, Temkin 1993, and Holtug 2010, chapter 7). \n\nIn considering this question, one should beware of conflating\nequality per se with distinct and independent values that in some\ncircumstances will closely shadow it. The values that might be\nconfounded with equality include sufficiency, priority, and desert. \n\nSuppose one compares the grim conditions of life endured by the\npoorest inhabitants of the earth with the garishly opulent conditions\nof life enjoyed by the wealthiest people. A natural reaction is that it\nis morally outrageous that such inequalities in life prospects exist.\nAs George Orwell once wrote, “a fat man eating quails while children\nare begging for bread is a disgusting sight” (Orwell 1938, 115).\nBut one may wonder if what is troubling about the example is the gap\nbetween rich and poor or rather the deplorable condition of the poor,\nwhich might continue unabated even if the gap itself were eliminated.\nTo put the issue another way, if it is the inequality per se that is\nbad, then the gap between poor and rich would seem to be no worse than\na same-sized gap between the life prospects of the rich and super-rich.\nTalk here of a “same-sized gap” presupposes that we have an\nagreed standard for measuring the sizes of gaps. The claim then would\nbe that according to any plausible such standard, the gap between\nsomeone who is very badly off and someone who is much better off will\nbe far more morally significant and bad than an identical gap between\nsomeone who is extremely well off in non-comparative terms and someone\nwho is much better off than that. If the latter inequality strikes one\nas morally inconsequential, the question arises whether inequality is\nin and of itself really objectionable. Perhaps the problem is not that\nthe poor have less than the rich, but rather that the poor do not have\nenough—a sufficient level of resources to provide a good life or\na reasonable prospect of a good life. The suggestion then is that\nsufficiency not equality is what per se matters. How one's condition\ncompares to the situation of other people is not important in itself.\nWhat is morally important is that people have enough to bring them over\nthe threshold of decent life prospects. (For this line of thought, see\nFrankfurt 1987 and 2000, Nussbaum 1990 and 2000, Miller 1995, Wiggins\n1991, Anderson 2000, and for an earlier statement of the sufficiency\nideal, Walzer 1983). \n\nThe doctrine of sufficiency holds that it is morally valuable that\nas many as possible of all who shall ever live should enjoy conditions\nof life that place them above the threshold that marks the minimum\nrequired for a decent (good enough) quality of life. Sufficiency can\nrationalize egalitarian transfers of resources from better off to worse\noff persons when such transfers would increase the total number of\npeople who ever achieve sufficiency. \n\nA potential problem for the sufficiency doctrine is that it may not\nbe possible non-arbitrarily to specify a line of sufficiency such that\nmoving a person just across that line has great moral significance. If\nthe sufficiency doctrine were asserted either as a complete theory of\njustice or as a principle that trumps all competitors, it would\ndefinitely be problematic. Suppose a large number of people are\nunavoidably below sufficiency, leading hellish lives, and that transfer\nof resources could vastly improve their lives while leaving them below\nthe sufficient level. Instead we could use these same resources to\nboost a single person who is now just barely under sufficiency to just\nbarely over it. Sufficiency as a trumping doctrine says that we ought\nto do what will increase the total number of persons who ever achieve\nsufficiency no matter what the cost to other moral values. This\ninstruction is worse than dubious. A similar difficulty emerges when\none imagines cases in which many people are unavoidably over the\nsufficiency level, but with a resource infusion their lives will be\nvastly improved, and in which the same resources could instead be used\nto prevent a single person now just above sufficiency from falling a\nhair beneath this line. If we try to mitigate the first concern by\nlowering the sufficiency threshold, this exacerbates the second\nconcern. \n\nThe doctrine just criticized is not the only one that falls under\nthe general heading of sufficientarian views. Roger Crisp (2003)\nsuggests that justice requires giving priority to making people better\noff, and greater priority to helping a person, the worse off in\nnon-comparative terms she is—up to the point at which the person\nattains a good enough quality of life. Roughly speaking, the idea would\nbe priority for the worse off, up to sufficiency, and straight\nutilitarian maximization of aggregate well-being above that line. This\nis a doctrine of priority (see next section) qualified by a sufficiency\nline. The question arises, how non-arbitrarily to draw the line. The\nsufficiency skeptic might hold that the underlying moral reality is\nthat a person's well-being, in all its dimensions, varies by\ndegree, as does any overall index of well-being, and there is no\n“good enough” line that has the significance the Crisp-type\nsufficientarian must give to it. A further question is how much\npriority to give to helping people below the threshold when that\ncompetes with helping people above the threshold. If one says no\ntrade-offs are allowed, that a jot of gain for a below-threshold person\noutweighs any amount of good that can be gained for any number of\nabove-threshold individuals, many will object that this is an extreme\nand wildly implausible view. But this may be one of those cases in\nwhich one person's reductio is another's Q.E.D.\n(If the sufficiency line is truly arbitrary, then giving any weight to\nit at all in determining what should be done will be excessive.) \n\nOther formulations of views that emphasize the moral importance of\nthe sufficiency line are possible. One says that one should bring it\nabout that, as far as is possible, over the history of the universe,\nthe total sum of the gaps between the level of lifetime well-being each\nperson achieves and the sufficiency level, for all persons whose\nlifetime well-being is below sufficiency, is as small as possible. This\nimplausibly recommends preventing any future persons from being born\nand having any life at all, if unavoidably some will fall below\nsufficiency. We might try the idea that we should seek to make the\naggregate sum of the gaps just described per person as small as\npossible for the entire history of the world. If the sufficiency line\nis deemed to be above the line of a life worth living, then if\nunavoidably at some point in the future people can only have lives\nworth living not good enough lives, the minimization of gaps-per-person\nagain yields a recommendation to bring it about that no future persons\nlive, even though they would have lives worth living. Or consider an\nAdam and Eve scenario—Adam and Eve lead nice lives above the\nsufficiency line, but begetting any children and bringing it about that\nany further persons exist would be wrong to do, according to the view\nunder consideration, if it is the case that bringing about the\nexistence of future persons will unavoidably make things worse from the\nstandpoint of minimizing total gaps-per-person. \n\nNotice that we might deny that the sufficiency view is a rival to\negalitarianism. One might instead hold that sufficiency is a version of\negalitarianism. Sufficiency holds that all persons equally have a claim\nto live a sufficiently good life, and that people's condition is\nrelevantly and importantly equal when all equally live at or above the\nlevel of sufficiency. I assume there need be no more than verbal\ndisagreement between one who asserts and one who denies that the\nsufficiency advocate values a type of equality. (This purely verbal\ndisagreement can arise whenever someone asserts that the doctrine that\nall should equally have X or receive X treatment is an egalitarian and\nsomeone else denies that this X theory is genuinely egalitarian.) \n\nThere is another route to the conclusion that equality per se is not\nmorally valuable. Consider again the scenario in which the poorest\ninhabitants of the earth face grim and miserable conditions of\nexistence and the richest enjoy an enormously better quality of life.\nThe sufficientarian's diagnosis of this situation is that what is bad\nabout this scenario is not the inequality, the gap between rich and\npoor, but the fact that the poor do not have enough. An alternative\ndiagnosis can most easily be explained by supposing that we have a\ncardinal interpersonal measure of welfare or well-being. An\nindividual's level of well-being registers how well her life is going\nas it would be assessed from the standpoint of rational prudence. An\nindividual's level of well-being is the level of benefits or advantages\nfor herself that her life contains. From this perspective, when one\nspeaks of “better off” and “worse off” persons, one is speaking of\npersons whose lifetime level of well-being is high or low. \n\nWith this bit of background in place, the idea that transfers of\nresources from better off to worse off persons are sometimes morally\ndesirable can be understood without supposing either that equality of\nany sort is per se desirable or that there is some level of well-being\nthat marks the good enough level and that has a special status as\nspecified by the sufficiency doctrine. Suppose that for any person, the\nlower her lifetime well-being score—the amount of well-being she\ngains or is now expected to gain over the course of her life—the\nmore morally valuable it would be to secure an incremental gain of\nwell-being for her (or to avoid a small loss). This is the root idea of\nprioritarianism. \n\nThe prioritarian idea is to be sharply distinguished from the idea\nthat across some range, resources secured for a person have declining\nmarginal utility. To illustrate, suppose one person is leading a\nhellish existence and another is leading a life of sheer bliss. We\nmight think that a single unit of some generally useful resource such\nas water is likely to do more good, result in a greater aggregate of\nwell-being among all persons, if the unit is provided to the person\nsuffering in hell rather than the person enjoying heavenly bliss. This\nmay be so. The straight utilitarian of well-being will then favor\nprovision of the unit of water to the inhabitant of hell. Now suppose\ninstead that a unit of some resource would provide exactly the same\nincrease in well-being if it is provided either to the person leading\nthe hellish or the person leading the blissful life. (Perhaps the\nperson already in bliss is a very efficient transformer of resources\ninto personal well-being.) The prioritarian gives priority to getting\nbenefits to those whose well-being level is low, so will favor helping\nthe miserable rather than the lucky person even if the well-being\naggregate is thereby reduced a bit, compared to what it would have been\nif the resource had been channeled to the blissful person. \n\nPrioritarianism holds that the moral value of achieving a benefit\nfor an individual (or avoiding a loss) is greater, the greater the size\nof the benefit as measured by a well-being scale, and greater, the\nlower the person's level of well-being over the course of her life\napart from receipt of this benefit. Well-being weighted by priority as\njust specified is sometimes called “weighted well-being.” To this\naccount of value the prioritarian adds the position that one ought to\nact, and institutions should be arranged, so as to maximize moral value\nas defined. (See chapter 2 of Scheffler 1982, Weirich 1983, Parfit\n1997). \n\nPrioritarianism is not vulnerable to the leveling down objection, so\nif one finds that objection decisive against any position that takes\nequality of any sort to be non-instrumentally valuable, priority looks\nto be an ethically attractive alternative. Political conservatives\nsometimes conjecture that the rancorous emotion of envy fuels the\nimpulse to egalitarian movements. With respect to a possible good and\nyour having it or my having it or both of us or neither of us having\nit, if I am an envious person, I prefer my having it rather than your\nhaving it and also prefer neither of us having it to your having it.\nThe prioritarian judgments as to what ought to be done do not reflect\nthe preferences of the envious. (Clarification: Envy as just described\ncorresponds to the ordinary common-sense notion of envy as a vice,\nwhich should be sharply distinguished from the bland preference\nconstitutive of the No-envy fairness criterion. These are different\nideas.) \n\nAnother attractive feature of prioritarianism is that it promises to\ncombine in a single determinate principle the values of well-being\nmaximization and priority for the badly off. So elaborated, the\npriority doctrine would contain a solution to the problem of\nintegrating the values of efficiency and equality broadly understood.\nBut this advantage is just notional pending a determination of how to\nweight the competing values of well-being gains and priority in a\nsingle principle. As stated, the priority doctrine does not specify a\ndeterminate principle but a family of principles. At one extreme,\nhardly any weight is given to priority as it competes with maximizing\nwell-being, and the prioritarian doctrine is then barely\ndistinguishable from straight act utilitarianism with utility\nidentified with well-being. At the other extreme, hardly any weight is\ngiven to maximizing well-being as it competes with priority, and the\nprioritarian doctrine is then barely distinguishable from the maximin\nprinciple with well-being as the maximand. (Maximin holds that one\nshould choose that policy, among the alternatives, that brings about\nthe best position for the worst off individual affected by the policy\nchoice.) \n\nThe priority doctrine has been explicated as a version of welfarism.\nOne can see that the prioritarian idea itself is separable from any\ncommitment to welfarism. In general terms, the prioritarian holds that\nthe moral value of gaining a benefit for a person is greater, the lower\nthe benefit level of the person prior to receipt of the increment, and\ngreater, the greater the size of the benefit. So stated, the doctrine\nadmits of various interpretations that put different constructions on\nthe idea of “greater benefit.” For example, if benefit is identified\nwith the Rawlsian idea of a primary social good, and one takes\nprioritarianism beyond its limit to maximin, one then has the Rawlsian\nconception, that justice in most general terms is bringing about the\nbest possible outcome for the very worst off. (See Rawls 1971, chapter\n2, and for a defense of maximin, J. Cohen 1989.) \n\nAs characterized here, priority says one ought always to choose the\nact that maximizes the moral value that is brought about, with moral\nvalue being larger, the larger the benefit one brings about for a\nperson, and larger, the worse off the person would be absent this\nbenefit over the course of her life. A challenge to priority, raising a\ndoubt against the thought that morality should dispense with any\nrelational equality concern, points out that priority says that if\none's acts can affect only oneself, one morally must do the act\nthat maximizes one's lifetime benefit level. Here priority and\nprudence coincide in their dictates as to what one should do. But\nsuppose the acts one can choose are risky, they might produce better or\nworse outcomes. A natural extension of priority says that when\none's choices are risky and affect others, one should be risk\naverse, the degree of risk aversion that is called for depending on how\nmuch weight should be assigned to getting benefits to a person, the\nworse off the person is. So far, so good. But priority applies to the\nchoice of a single person whose acts affect only himself: Consider\nRobinson Crusoe alone on an island. He can choose to swim, which would\nbe fun but carries some risk of being eaten by a shark and dying\nimmediately, or instead climb coconut trees on the beach, less fun but\ncarrying no risk of harm as grave as a shark attack. Rational prudence,\nwe think, does not dictate that Crusoe be conservative in his choices\nby giving extra weight to the outcome in which he suffers low lifetime\nwell-being. Prudence permits Crusoe to be risk-loving, risk-averse, or\nrisk-neutral is deciding among options such as swim with the sharks or\nclimb on the safe beach. But the natural extension of priority makes it\na strict moral requirement that he be risk-averse, giving extra weight\n(above and beyond what his own preferences dictate) to avoiding the\noutcome in which death right away induces low lifetime well-being. That\nseems odd. We might respond by saying that egalitarian values only come\ninto play in dictating what we ought to do when our acts affect other\npeople, and thus affect how badly off or well off people are relative\nto each other. When choices affect only the self, following ordinary\nprudence is fine. That response abandons extended priority and\nchallenges the idea that priority captures our moral convictions\nregarding why there is extra moral reason to help those who are worse\noff than others (see Otsuka and Voorhoeve 2009). \n\nThe prioritarian can choose among several ways to stave off the\nOtsuka and Voorhoeve challenge. The most sensible response may be\nsimply to bite the bullet and, in effect, acknowledge that Crusoe has\nspecial reason to avoid the sharks. This does not mean that taking\nrisks that would bring it about that one's absolute well-being\nlevel is low is never or seldom rational. Dangerous sports, after all,\ncan provide sublime experience. In fact, accepting a slight risk of a\nfatal car crash by driving across town to get better quality bread,\nwhen one's available choices affect only oneself, may be\nperfectly rational. But priority tells us to put a thumb on the scale\nso as to favor avoiding very bad life outcomes. It is difficult to\nassess the acceptability of this implication of the doctrine pending\nsome specification of the priority weights as they bear on decision\nmaking. \n\nEgalitarian transfers will in some circumstances be recommended by\nyet another principle that cares nothing for equality per se (Kagan\n1999 and 2012). This is the principle of desert: It is desirable\nthat each person should gain good fortune corresponding to her virtue\n(deservingness). As construed here, the desert principle\npresupposes that individuals' virtue is cardinally interpersonally\nmeasureable. A number can then be assigned to each person indicating\nthat person's level of virtue; persons assigned higher numbers have\ngreater virtue. Suppose that for each number there is a specific amount\nof good fortune or well-being that an individual with that number\nindicating her amount of virtue deserves to have. This is the level of\ngood fortune that corresponds to one's virtue. This level is higher for\nthe more virtuous, lower for the less virtuous. (One might allow that\nvery non-virtuous persons deserve some level of bad fortune or negative\nwell-being.) \n\nSuppose one adds to the desert principle the further norm that when\na person has less than she deserves, it is morally more valuable to\ngain an increment of good fortune for that person, the greater the gap\nbetween what she has and what she deserves. Call the further norm the\ngreater gap principle. Just as the prioritarian regards it as morally\nmore valuable (a matter of greater moral urgency) to gain a benefit for\na person, the worse off in absolute terms she would otherwise be, the\ngreater-gap desertitarian as just characterized holds that it is\nmorally more valuable (a matter of greater moral urgency) to gain a\nbenefit for a person, the greater the shortfall (if any) between the\nbenefit level she has and the benefit level she deserves. Accepting the\ndesert principle and the greater gap principle, one will then sometimes\nfavor egalitarian transfers purely from considerations of desert. \n\nJust as someone might fail to notice that in some situations both\npriority and equality will both recommend equalizing transfers, and so\nwrongly think that she favors the transfer in these situations because\nshe values equality per se, someone might fail to notice that in some\nsituations desert and equality will both recommend equalizing\ntransfers, and so wrongly think that she favors the transfer in these\nsituations because she values equality per se. The situation is\nclarified when one considers examples in which priority and equality\ndisagree about what ought to be done, and examples in which desert and\nequality disagree about what ought to be done. Shelly Kagan presses the\nproposal that when we consider a wide range of views and examples, we\nshould conclude that bringing it about that people should get good\nfortune corresponding to their virtue rightly commands our allegiance\nand bringing it about that people get the same or have the same does\nnot rightly command our allegiance. \n\nKagan poses many examples and tests our responses to them (Kagan\n1999 and 2012). An important range of examples involves situations in\nwhich a person is badly off, but has more than he deserves, and another\nperson is well off, but has less than he deserves. Kagan suggests that\nfor each person at a given level of deservingness, there is some\nabsolute level of benefit or well-being that is exactly what the person\ndeserves. From the standpoint of desert, getting this amount is ideal,\nbetter than getting either more or less. Kagan calls this level of\nbenefit for a person with a specified deservingness score that\nperson's peak. Now consider a saint who is very well\noff, but is way below her peak, and consider a sinner who is very badly\noff, but still is far beyond her peak. The sinner enjoys more good\nfortune than she deserves, the saint less. Now we face a choice: we can\nhelp either the sinner or the saint but not both. An advocate of\nequality says, help the badly off person, the sinner. An advocate of\npriority will say the same. Kagan suggests to the contrary that we\nshould regard it as morally the better course of action to aid the\nsaint, who has less than she deserves, rather than to help the sinner,\nwho already has more than she deserves. Kagan suggests that rewarding\ndesert trumps any moral imperative to equalize (or\n“prioritize”). Kagan adds a further suggestion: that\ngetting what one deserves matters more, the more deserving one is. The\nsinner's getting less than she deserves is less of a big deal,\nmorally speaking, than the saint's getting less than she\ndeserves. \n\nIn reply: the advocate of equality (or priority) might stiff-arm the\nidea that people should get what they deserve. Maybe in a diverse\nmodern society any standard of virtue will be contestable, and so not a\ngood building block for constructing fundamental moral principles.\nMaybe we are all determined by prior conditions and causes to behave\njust as we do, and this fact properly understood should lead us to hold\neither that the idea of being deserving lacks clear sense or that\neveryone's deservingness score is the same. On either view,\nrewarding the deserving is not a moral imperative. At most doing this\nwill be a means to other goals, not desirable for its own sake. \n\nEven if we cannot endorse the flat denial that rewarding the\ndeserving has any moral value, we might give this norm decisively\nsubordinate status. One suggestion along this line denies the idea that\nthere are “peaks”—a level of benefit for each person\nsuch that his becoming better off is bad from the standpoint of desert.\nInstead we might say that desert only establishes a comparative ranking\namong individuals. Being deserving or undeserving enhances or dampens\nthe moral reason to bring it about that one gains further benefits or\navoids further losses, but never to the point that gaining further\nbenefits or avoiding further losses has negative value. So to speak,\nbeing more or less deserving puts one toward the front or rear of the\nline of people eligible for benefits, but does not ever make one\nmorally ineligible for a better life. Along the same line, one might\nallow that desert reasons compete with equality or priority reasons,\nbut give decisively less weight to desert reasons. \n\nJust about any moral principles might require moves toward equality\nof some sort across persons in some actual, likely, or conceivable\ncircumstances. Utilitarianism says that one ought always to do whatever\nwould maximize aggregate welfare. In some circumstances doing that\nwould require working especially hard to boost the welfare of the\ndisadvantaged, and so to bring about a state of affairs that is closer\nto equality of welfare than would otherwise have come about. Sometimes\nin order to maximize aggregate welfare one would need to transfer\nincome or wealth from rich to poor, and thus bring about a closer\napproximation to the state of affairs in which all persons have the\nsame income or wealth or both. A Lockean natural rights view holds that\none is always bound by a strict moral duty to respect everyone's\nnatural rights, come what may. It might be that in some circumstances\ndoing what brings about greater equality of some sort across persons\nwould be a good means to bringing it about that one respects the\nnatural rights of other people that morality says one ought to respect.\nIn other situations increasing equality might be a byproduct of the\ncourse of action that one is morally obliged to take, according to\nLockean morality, in order to respect people's natural\nrights. \n\nIt should be clear that even if some contingent connections of these\nsorts hold between promoting equality and acting in conformity with\nsome quite different moral view whose best articulation contains no\nessential reference to equality promotion, the quite different moral\nview is not thereby revealed to be egalitarian. At the outset of this\nsurvey broad and narrow egalitarianism were distinguished. The former\nsays equality is at least instrumentally valuable and should be\npromoted; the latter says equality is non-instrumentally valuable and\nshould on that ground be promoted. To show that some moral doctrine\nsupports broad egalitarianism one would need to show not just that the\nview might conceivably, given some logically possible circumstances,\nsupport the claim that equality of some sort should be promoted, but\nrather that given the world as it is and is likely to be, the doctrine\nin question is often or usually or always aligned with broad\negalitarianism. \n\nSufficiency, priority, and desert are rivals of narrow\negalitarianism. Advocates of each of these views have argued that the\nrival often supports equalization, and so one might mistakenly support\nequalization on the ground that equality of some sort is\nnon-instrumentally valuable. But once one examines a broader sample of\nexamples, and reviews situations in which the rival and narrow\negalitarianism yield opposed recommendations as to what should be done,\none should conclude that the rival, and not any version of narrow\negalitarianism, should be affirmed as non-instrumentally valuable and\nincorporated into the set of fundamental moral principles. Or so the\nadvocates of the rivals will say. \n\nTo defend the position that equality is per se morally desirable one\nwould need carefully to investigate the scenarios in which egalitarian\ntransfers are attractive and the variety of principles that would\nsupport egalitarian transfers in those scenarios. If the norm of\nequality does not match our considered judgments after wide reflection,\nwe should be content to be instrumental egalitarians if we are\ndetermined to be egalitarians at all. \n\n7. Egalitarian Standards for Institutions and Individual\nConduct \n\nEgalitarian principles might apply only to individual conduct, only\nto institutions, to both, or neither. The same principles might apply\nto individual conduct and institutions, or it could be that different\nprinciples apply in each domain. \n\nOne reason for supposing that more demanding egalitarian principles\napply to the enactment of laws and public policies and to the conduct\nof states than to individual conduct is that the reasons to insist that\nthe state choose its actions according to impartial standards, treating\nall citizens impartially, are stronger than the reasons to insist that\nindividuals in private life should choose actions according to\nimpartial standards, treating all fellow citizens who might be affected\nby one's choices impartially. In private life, an individual is\npermitted to favor herself over others. An individual is also permitted\nto favor her own friends and family members over other people in many\ncontexts (not when she is an employer selecting who among those who\nhave applied for a job should be selected for employment, nor is she\npermitted to offer goods and services for sale to some while refusing\nto sell these same commodities to others). Individuals are thought to have wide discretion\nto pursue their own projects in their own way. In contrast, the state\nis widely supposed to be entitled to favor the interests of its\ncitizens living with its jurisdiction over the interests of noncitizens\nliving outside its jurisdiction, but is required to be strictly\nimpartial in treating citizens. In the words of Ronald Dworkin, the\nstate is obliged to treat all citizens with equal concern and\nrespect. \n\nThe considerations advanced in the previous paragraph could be given\na stronger or a weaker interpretation. On the stronger reading, the\nprinciples that determine morally acceptable state actions have no\nimplications for what individuals should do in private life. The\nprinciples for state action might in principle be entirely separate and\ndistinct from the principles that determine morally acceptable\nindividual conduct. On the weaker reading, the principles that regulate\nstate action might have implications for what individuals should do in\ntheir private as well as public roles and might partially determine the\nstandards regulating individual conduct. Nonetheless individuals\ngenerally should have greater permission to deviate from strict\nimpartiality in deciding how to act when their actions could help\nothers than states should have. \n\nEven those sympathetic to the position just outlined are likely to\nacknowledge the position must be qualified and hedged in some ways.\nConsider racial discrimination. Suppose we hold that the state should\nnot engage in discriminatory conduct on the basis of racial\nclassifications even to advance morally worthy goals—imagine that\nin some circumstances guiding police behavior by racial profiling would\nbe a cost-effective measure to reduce crime. The reasons we hold it is\nwrong for the state to engage in racial discrimination would appear to\ncarry over to private discriminatory behavior by citizens. It would be\nwrongful racial discrimination to choose my friends according to their\nrace or skin color. Private action by individuals that expresses hatred\nof people on grounds of their race or skin color is wrong for pretty\nmuch the same reasons that it would be wrong for a state to pass and\nenforce laws and public policies that express hatred of people on\ngrounds of their race or skin color. \n\nTo illustrate some of the complexities of determining how\negalitarian principles regulating state action and egalitarian\nprinciples regulating individual conduct might be related, consider\nJohn Rawls's view that the primary subject of justice is the\nbasic structure of society—core institutions including the state,\nprivate ownership and the market economy, and the family as they\ninteract and affect people's fundamental life prospects. Rawls\ndevises a special argument designed to generate principles for the\nregulation of the basic structure of society that we, contemplating\nthis argument, should accept as principles that determine what must be\ntrue if the basic structure is to qualify as just. The special argument\ndevice, which Rawls calls the “original position,” is also\ndeployed to select principles of individual conduct associated with the\nprinciples of justice, but these principles merely state that\nindividuals should support just institutions. When the basic structure\nof society is just, individuals should support it and conform to its\nnorms and rules, and if the basic structure is not just individuals\nshould cooperate with others to bring about a just basic structure so\nlong as they can do so at moderate cost and risk to themselves (Rawls\n1999, chapters 2 and 3). \n\nFor purposes of examining the relationship between requirements on\nindividuals and requirements on institutions in a theory of justice, I\nshall simplify Rawls's theory and suppose it simply mandates that\nthe basic structure institutions should be arranged so that the primary\nsocial good holdings of the worst off sector of society are maximized.\n(As is well known, Rawls's theory also includes a principle of\nequal liberty that mandates that a fully adequate scheme of civil and\npolitical liberties be secured for all and a principle of fair equality\nof opportunity that requires that inequalities in primary social good\nholdings be attached to positions and offices open to all in such a way\nthat those with equal ambition and equal native talent have equal\nchances of being competitively successful. These principles take\nlexical priority over the difference principle [Rawls 1999, chapters\n2–4]). \n\nThere is undoubtedly a certain appeal to the strategy of holding the\nlegal, coercive structure of legal rules to be the entity that delivers\ndistributive justice according to the difference principle. The laws\nincluding laws regulating contract, property, torts, and family are set\nso that, as compared to any alternative set of rules that might be\nchosen, they work to maximize the long-run primary social good holdings\nof the people who have least of these. In private life, and carrying out\nprivate decisions within the institutions regulated by the coercive\nrules, the individual citizen has complete liberty to act according to\nher own values and preferences so long as she obeys the legal rules\nthat apply to her. The strategy reflects a balance of liberty and\nequality (Nagel 1991). \n\nThe adoption of the strategy also reflects the view that the\ncoercively imposed basic structure of society including its political\nconstitution must be acceptable to all reasonable persons in a diverse\nsociety in which reasonable people disagree widely in their\ncomprehensive conceptions of the right and the good. Since any attempt\nto impose egalitarian norms on individual economic choices would be\nunavoidably controversial and socially divisive, the just society\neschews the attempt, on principle (Scheffler 2010, chapter 5). \n\nIn several of his writings G. A. Cohen has mounted an attack on the\nRawlsian position that the basic structure is the primary subject of\njustice and that beyond supporting just institutions individuals are\nnot morally required to pursue justice goals including the difference\nprinciple in their choices of how to live (Cohen 2000 and 2008, see\nalso Murphy 1998). In a nutshell, Cohen objects that in a society in which\npeople and institutions are just according to Rawls's standards,\nthe people endorse the difference principle: they believe institutions\nshould be set to make the condition of the worst off in primary goods\nholdings as good as it can be made. However, their own actions,\nindividually and in the ensemble, will have an impact on the condition\nof the least advantaged members of society. Hence their acceptance of\nthe difference principle ought to have implications for the conduct of\ntheir lives. Grant that each person is free to live as she chooses, to\nsome extent, without being required in every action to do her utmost to\nbring about the fullest realization of social justice in the universe.\nEach person has a legitimate personal prerogative to do actions that\nproduce less than the best outcome within certain moral limits\n(Scheffler 1982). But the prerogative gives out, and where it does, if\none is committed to the difference principle, one will make decisions\nconcerning work and career that will aim to improve the condition of\nthe worst off. Suppose one holds instead that justice requires an equal\ndistribution of benefits and burdens among the members of society,\nexcept when inequality arises in a way for which the person who ends up\nwith less should properly be held responsible (Cohen 2008). Then also,\none will, to some considerable extent, shape one's economic\nbehavior with this egalitarian aim in view, if one is seriously\ncommitted to the idea that justice demands equality. \n\nIf justice is a fair distribution of benefits and burdens across\npeople, and if one's economic behavior affects the degree to\nwhich justice obtains, then if one is committed to justice, one must,\nto some degree, guide one's behavior by that commitment. So Cohen\nurges. He complains that Rawls countenances a split in the thinking and\naction of the just individual in an imagined fully just society that\ndoes not make sense. The Rawlsian just individual supports the\ndifference principle as the regulative standard for institutions, for\nthe basic structure of society, but does not regulate his own life\nchoices in daily economic affairs and career choices by the difference\nprinciple. Cohen objects that this split personality cannot be an\nideally just person, contrary to what Rawls claims (Rawls 1999).\nAccording to Cohen a fully just society regulated by egalitarian\nprinciples would include an egalitarian ethos that instructs\nindividuals that each should do her bit towards sustaining equality by\nher everyday choices. Individuals internalize the egalitarian ethos and\nare guided by it in their economic choices, and hence will not be\ndisposed to bargain hard for extra pay and benefits in exchange for\nmaking efficient contributions to the economy. They will rather be\ndisposed to cooperate with others efficiently in their economic\ninteractions without requiring the spur of economic incentives. In this\nway a thoroughly just Rawlsian society populated by just individuals\nachieves more egalitarian outcomes while maximizing the benefits that\ngo to the worst off than a Rawlsian society regulated in the split\npersonality fashion. (Cohen also challenges Rawls's argument for\nthe difference principle. Cohen claims that Rawls starts with a\nconsideration favoring equality that illicitly gets dropped as his\ndiscussion proceeds. Cohen then holds that Rawls, and we, should\nbelieve that justice requires equality, even if pragmatic nonjustice\ngrounds favor the difference principle, which does not incorporate the\nidea that equality is non-instrumentally morally valuable. (See Cohen\n2008, chapter 4). But in the argument being considered here, Cohen\naccepts the difference principle arguendo, and argues that Rawls does\nnot fully acknowledge the implications of his own commitment to\nit.) \n\nA Rawlsian rejoinder to Cohen might point out that the principles of\njustice including the difference principle are principles for the\nregulation of the basic structure of society. Accepting the difference\nprinciple as a standard for institutional arrangements is not\ntantamount to accepting the difference principle as a guide to\none's personal life. Cohen insists this position is unstable.\nRawls holds that the basic structure of society is the primary subject\nof justice because its effects on people's fundamental life\nprospects are so deep and widespread. But voluntary choices of\nindividuals within institutions such as the economy and the family also\nmassively shape people's fundamental life prospects. According to\nCohen, the rationale for taking the basic structure to be the primary\nsubject of justice is also a rationale for taking people's\nchoices within the basic structure to be incorporated in the primary\nsubject of justice. Perhaps the principles of justice in their\napplication to individuals take a somewhat different form than they do\nin their application to institutions. Recall here Cohen's\nacceptance of the idea that each individual has a Scheffler prerogative\nto pursue her own projects and aims, to some extent, and not always to\nbe acting with a view to promoting justice. But Cohen's bottom\nline is that if justice requires the promotion of a moral goal,\nacceptance of that moral goal as a requirement of justice by the\nindividual must commit her to acting in her own life with a view to\npromoting that goal. \n\nSeveral issues arise in considering Cohen versus Rawls. According to\nRawls, a just society is a fair scheme of cooperation among persons\nregarded as free and equal. Each is free in having the ability and the\nright to develop and pursue a conception of the good and also the\nability and the disposition to cooperate with others on fair terms. In\nany modern, diverse society that refrains from clearly unacceptable\nrestriction of freedom, individuals will develop allegiance to\ndifferent and opposed conceptions of the right and the good, and a\nconception of justice that can elicit everyone's reasonable\nacceptance must be acceptable to the different reasonable ethical views\nthat individuals espouse. The moral equality of persons generates this\nunanimity requirement. To satisfy this requirement, a justice doctrine\nmust be built up from ideas deeply embedded in the culture of modern\ndemocracies. To enable satisfaction of this requirement, reasonable\ncitizens do not press as justice norms controversial, sectarian\ndoctrines that some cannot reasonably accept. When we act together as\ncitizens through the state, we act on the basis of shared reasons, a\ncommon ideal of justice. But each of us has different ultimate ethical\nallegiances, and no single idea of what demands morality places on us\nto promote justice in our private conduct will make sense to all of us.\nMoreover, it would be a form of tyranny to require that we generally\nact only on the shared reasons of justice throughout our lives rather\nthan on the aims and ambitions that are uniquely our own. In a just\nsociety, individuals in their daily lives will decide from their own\nindividual ethical perspectives what goals to pursue, including justice\ngoals, within constraints set by the rights of others. There is no\nsocial consensus on this issue, so no particular view of the demands of\njustice promotion in ordinary life will be part of a conception of\njustice that all can accept (see generally Rawls 2005). \n\nThe defender of the Cohen side of this debate will insist that\nreasonable people can make mistakes, so the fact, if it is a fact, that\nany particular view of the positive duties to promote justice and\nequality in daily life that we should accept will fail to gain\nunanimous support does not necessarily impugn the particular view. Some\nsuch view may be correct though controversial. Also, the egalitarian\nethos with its demands on individual daily conduct is not supposed to\nbe legally enforceable, rather it is supposed to be a social norm\nbacked by informal sanctions and rational persuasion. Still, justice\ndemands an egalitarian ethos, and individual conduct in conformity with\nit. So the defender of the Cohen position will hold. This is a tricky\nissue. It may be difficult to determine to what extent Cohenites and\nRawlsians are in substantial disagreement, as opposed to arguing past\neach other. It may be still more difficult to determine which side (if\neither one) is right on the points that substantially divide them. \n\nStepping back from the Cohen versus Rawls polemic (on which, see\nWilliams 1998, Pogge 2000, Scheffler 2006, and Shiffrin 2010), we\nshould note that any theory of egalitarian justice must indicate how\nits requirements for institutions and practices mesh with its views\nconcerning what justice requires of individuals. For example, any\nordinary person seeking to fashion a fulfilling life for himself will\nform friendships and close family ties and other associations that will\ncommand his loyalty. Being a good friend, one will be partial to\none's friend over others in some contexts; being a good family\nmember, one will be partial to one's family members over others;\nbeing a good citizen, one will (perhaps, this case is more\ncontroversial) have a special loyalty to one's compatriots. These\nspecial-tie commitments appear to be unavoidably in tension with any\ncommitment to any impartial justice norms (Scheffler 2003). Suppose we\naccept the idea that the person committed to egalitarianism will not\nseek to expunge all personal commitments from her life but will seek to\naccommodate impartial ethical and partial concerns in some way that does\njustice to both. What way is that? Presumably the answer will vary\nacross the different types of personal commitments that might lead one\nto do what cuts against justice requirements. Relations to colleagues,\nfamily members, friends, lovers, parents, children, ethnic and social\ngroup comrades, and so on will pose different sorts of problems that\nwill require different sorts of accommodations and adjustments. A\ncomplete egalitarian theory includes principles that would properly\nguide these accommodations and adjustments. (For an attempt to work out\nthese issues for one domain, that of parents and children, from a\nperspective sympathetic to Cohen's line, see Brighouse and Swift\n2009). \n\nEgalitarian justice doctrines rest on the fundamental premise that\nall persons have the same fundamental worth and dignity, which commands\nrespect. An aristocratic doctrine that held that all lords are\ninherently superior to commoners and hence ought to have greater rights\nand privileges would reject the basic equal human worth premise.\nHowever, acceptance of this fundamental or background egalitarian\npremise need not per se commit one to any very substantive egalitarian\nethic. Accepting basic equal human worth, one might cheerfully maintain\nthat the correct ethic is egoism, that each person ought to strive to\nbring about her own advantage as best she can. Or one might hold that\nthere is no moral requirement that the inhabitants of a political\ncommunity should share equally in political power or political rights,\nand no moral requirement that people who happen to become better off\nshould help the worse off. \n\nThe gap between equal fundamental human worth and a substantive\negalitarian ethic is exposed in Utilitarianism, chapter 5,\nwhen Mill avers that utilitarianism incorporates the fundamental\nprinciple of equality, that in the determination of what to do, each\nperson's interests should count exactly the same as any other\nperson's exactly similar interest. On this basis he denies that\nutilitarianism, the doctrine that one ought always to do whatever\nmaximizes aggregate utility, comes into conflict with the\nrecommendations for conduct of a justice norm of equality (Mill 1979).\nThe utilitarian rule “everyone to count for one, nobody for more\nthan one” is already a substantive egalitarian norm, which goes\nbeyond the bare assertion of equal basic human worth. However, there\nare egalitarian doctrines that insist on equal treatment of persons in\nsome more robust sense, which neither equal basic moral worth nor\nutilitarian equal counting necessarily delivers. Some egalitarians\nmight hold that equal free speech rights or democratic rights for all\nshould be upheld even if denial of free speech or voting rights in\nparticular circumstances would lead to the greatest total of utility or\nhappiness. Some egalitarians might hold that it would be morally better\nto bring about a situation in which there is somewhat less aggregate\nutility (human good) dispersed equally among all people than an\nalternative situation in which the utility total is larger but its\ndistribution is extremely unequal across persons. \n\nThe assertion that all persons have equal basic moral worth is not\ntransparently clear. What is being asserted? I will try to elucidate\nthe idea by giving two examples of its application. A Lockean theory\nholds that all persons equally have certain natural moral rights. Just\nbeing a person confers on one the same package of rights that every\nother person possesses. One can perhaps forfeit some of these rights by\nbad conduct, but initially the protections the rights afford are the\nsame for all. If possession of rational agency capacity confers moral\nworth, and having this moral worth makes you a possessor of natural\nrights, equal worth gives everyone equal natural rights. For another\nexample, a utilitarian might also hold that being a person makes the\nfulfillment of your interests and the achievement of your good just as\nvaluable as the fulfillment and achievement of any other person's\nidentical welfare gains. Your good weighs the same as anyone\nelse's on the scale that determines what outcomes would be best\nand so what ought to be done (and a boost to any person's welfare\nmorally counts for more than an identical boost in welfare that instead\nmight be brought about for any lesser, nonperson sentient creature).\nWhat equal basic worth of persons implies regarding how persons should\nbe treated varies from moral theory to moral theory and depends on the\nstructure and content of the particular theory. \n\nThe assertion that all persons have equal basic moral worth and\ndignity calls out for justification or at least elucidation. What is it\nabout persons that renders them all morally equal in some fundamental\nsense? One proposal is that a being becomes morally considerable by\ngaining some capacity for rational agency, for thinking through what\nought to be done and setting one's will to do it, and that if one\nattains rational agency capacity at a certain threshold level, one\nbecomes a full person, and further increases in rational agency above\nthat threshold line that some might attain would not affect one's\nfundamental status of being a person with the same worth and dignity\npossessed by all other persons (Nozick 1974, chapter 3). \n\nThis proposal has the attractive feature that it treats evenhandedly\nmembers of the human species and members of any other species of being\nthere might be anywhere in the universe. If any beings possess rational\nagency capacity at a threshold level, they are persons and have the\nmoral worth and dignity that attaches to persons. The proposal also\nprovides an attractive approach to the issue of what rights and duties\nhumans and other animals have with respect to each other. The proposal\nsuggests that the more it is the case that an individual being attains\nsome degree of rational agency capacity, below the threshold of full\npersonhood, the more morally considerable that being is. \n\nThough attractive, the proposal faces difficulties that have not so\nfar been solved. One initial difficulty is to specify and justify the\nthreshold that marks the personhood boundary. There are evidently\ndifferent components of rational agency capacity, such as the ability\nto perceive features of one's environment, the ability to\nrecognize and assess reasons for choice, the ability to deliberate and\nchoose, the ability to form intentions and carry through what one has\ndecided, and so on. To speak of rational agency capacity as one\ncapacity presupposes some way of adding together an individual's\ncomponent ability levels into one overall capacity. Then there is a\nline drawing problem: What justifies identifying the level of capacity\nthat marks one as a person here rather than there? A perhaps more\ntroublesome difficulty is that it is not at all obvious why the fact\nthat people differ in their attainment of rational agency capacity\nabove the threshold of personhood does not bring about difference in\ntheir fundamental moral status. Why doesn't the fact that you\npossess more of the very capacities for reasoning, insight, choice, and\neffective volition that qualified us as persons than I do render it the\ncase that you are morally more considerable than I, have a higher\nfundamental moral worth? (see Carter 2011 and Waldron 2003). There is\nthe further question how to determine what degree of moral worth or\nmoral considerability attaches to beings who possess some rational\nagency capacities below the threshold level, or who possess capacities\nof some other sort such as bare sentience that should be regarded as\nmoral considerability qualifications. And finally, Peter Vallentyne\nposes yet another worry (Vallentyne 2007). Suppose that we take\nrational agency capacity to be the basis of personhood. What then do we\nsay about newborn human infants or normal young human children, who\nsurely lack rational agency capacity at any plausible threshold level.\nIf we say, the newborn human is a potential person, hence entitled to\nrights close to those of persons, the problem arises that in the\nfuture, when we have better genetic therapies available, and by\napplying expensive genetic treatment to a normal mouse, could endow it\nwith rational agency capacity, the normal mouse looks likely to qualify\nas a potential person if the newborn or young human does.","contact.mail":"rarneson@ucsd.edu","contact.domain":"ucsd.edu"}]
