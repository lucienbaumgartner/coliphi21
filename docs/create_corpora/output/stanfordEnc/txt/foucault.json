He has had strong influence not only (or even primarily) in\nphilosophy but also in a wide range of humanistic and social\nscientific disciplines.\n\nFoucault was born in Poitiers, France, on October 15, 1926. As a\nstudent he was brilliant but psychologically tormented. He became\nacademically established during the 1960s, holding a series of\npositions at French universities, before his election in 1969 to the\nultra-prestigious Collège de France, where he was Professor of\nthe History of Systems of Thought until his death. From the 1970s on,\nFoucault was very active politically. He was a founder of the\nGroupe d’information sur les prisons and often\nprotested on behalf of marginalized groups. He frequently lectured\noutside France, particularly in the United States, and in 1983 had\nagreed to teach annually at the University of California at Berkeley.\nAn early victim of AIDS, Foucault died in Paris on June 25, 1984. In\naddition to works published during his lifetime, his lectures at the\nCollège de France, published posthumously, contain important\nelucidations and extensions of his ideas. \nOne might question whether Foucault is in fact a philosopher. His\nacademic formation was in psychology and its history as well as in\nphilosophy, his books were mostly histories of medical and social\nsciences, his passions were literary and political. Nonetheless,\nalmost all of Foucault’s works can be fruitfully read as\nphilosophical in either or both of two ways: as carrying out\nphilosophy’s traditional critical project in a new (historical)\nmanner; and as a critical engagement with the thought of traditional\nphilosophers. This article will present him as a philosopher in these\ntwo dimensions. \nWe begin, however, with a sketch of the philosophical environment in\nwhich Foucault was educated. He entered the École Normale\nSupérieure (the standard launching pad for major French\nphilosophers) in 1946, during the heyday of existential phenomenology.\nMerleau-Ponty, whose lectures he attended, and Heidegger were\nparticularly important. Hegel and Marx were also major interests,\nHegel through the interpretation of his work offered by Jean Hyppolite\nand Marx through the structuralist reading of Louis\nAlthusser—both teachers who had a strong impact on Foucault at\nthe École Normale. It is not surprising that Foucault’s\nearliest works (his long “Introduction” to Jacqueline\nVerdeaux’ French translation of Traum und\nExistenz by Ludwig Binswanger, a Heideggerian psychiatrist,\nand Maladie mentale et personnalité, a short book on\nmental illness) were written in the grip of, respectively,\nexistentialism and Marxism. But he soon turned away from both. \nJean-Paul Sartre, working outside the University system, had no\npersonal influence on Foucault. But, as the French master-thinker of\nthe previous generation, he is always in the background. Like Sartre,\nFoucault began from a relentless hatred of bourgeois society and\nculture and with a spontaneous sympathy for marginal groups such as\nthe mad, homosexuals, and prisoners. They both also had strong\ninterests in literature and psychology as well as philosophy, and\nboth, after an early relative lack of political interest, became\ncommitted activists. But in the end, Foucault seemed to insist on\ndefining himself in contradiction to Sartre. Philosophically, he\nrejected what he saw as Sartre’s privileging of the subject\n(which he mocked as “transcendental narcissism”).\nPersonally and politically, he rejected Sartre’s role as what\nFoucault called a “universal intellectual”, judging\nsociety by appeals to universal moral principles, such as the\ninviolability of individual freedom. There is, however, more than a\nhint of protesting too much in Foucault’s rejection of Sartre,\nand the question of the relation of their work remains a fertile\none. \nThree other factors were of much more positive significance for the\nyoung Foucault. First, there was the French tradition of history and\nphilosophy of science, particularly as represented by Georges\nCanguilhem, a powerful figure in the French University establishment,\nwhose work in the history and philosophy of biology provided a model\nfor much of Foucault’s work in the history of the human\nsciences. Canguilhem sponsored Foucault’s doctoral thesis on the\nhistory of madness and, throughout Foucault’s career, remained\none of his most important and effective supporters. Canguilhem’s\napproach to the history of science (an approach developed from the\nwork of Gaston Bachelard), provided Foucault with a strong sense (in\nsome ways Kuhnian avant la lettre, see entry on\n scientific revolutions, section 5.3)\n of the discontinuities in scientific history, along with a\n“rationalist” understanding of the historical role of\nconcepts that made them independent of the phenomenologists’\ntranscendental consciousness. Foucault found this understanding\nreinforced in the structuralist linguistics and psychology developed,\nrespectively, by Ferdinand de Saussure and Jacques Lacan, as well as\nin Georges Dumézil’s proto-structuralist work on\ncomparative religion. These anti-subjective standpoints provide the\ncontext for Foucault’s marginalization of the subject in his\n“structuralist histories”, The Birth of the\nClinic (on the origins of modern medicine) and The Order of\nThings (on the origins of the modern human sciences). \nIn a quite different vein, Foucault was enthralled by French\navant-garde literature, especially the writings of Georges Bataille\nand Maurice Blanchot, where he found the experiential concreteness of\nexistential phenomenology without what he came to see as dubious\nphilosophical assumptions about subjectivity. Of particular interest\nwas this literature’s evocation of\n“limit-experiences”, which push us to extremes where\nconventional categories of intelligibility begin to break down. \nThis philosophical milieu provided materials for the critique of\nsubjectivity and the corresponding “archaeological” and\n“genealogical” methods of writing history that inform\nFoucault’s projects of historical critique, to which we now\nturn. \nSince its beginnings with Socrates, philosophy has typically involved\nthe project of questioning the accepted knowledge of the day. Later,\nLocke, Hume, and especially, Kant developed a distinctively modern\nidea of philosophy as the critique of knowledge. Kant’s great\nepistemological innovation was to maintain that the same critique that\nrevealed the limits of our knowing powers could also reveal necessary\nconditions for their exercise. What might have seemed just contingent\nfeatures of human cognition (for example, the spatial and temporal\ncharacter of its perceptual objects) turn out to be necessary truths.\nFoucault, however, suggests the need to invert this Kantian move.\nRather than asking what, in the apparently contingent, is actually\nnecessary, he suggests asking what, in the apparently necessary, might\nbe contingent. The focus of his questioning is the modern human\nsciences (biological, psychological, social). These purport to offer\nuniversal scientific truths about human nature that are, in fact,\noften mere expressions of ethical and political commitments of a\nparticular society. Foucault’s “critical philosophy”\nundermines such claims by exhibiting how they are the outcome of\ncontingent historical forces, not scientifically grounded truths. Each\nof his major books is a critique of historical reason. \nFoucault’s History of Madness in the Classical Age\n(1961) originated in his academic study of psychology (a licence\nde psychologie in 1949 and a diplome de\npsycho-pathologie in 1952), his work in a Parisian mental\nhospital, and his own personal psychological problems. It was mainly\nwritten during his post-graduate Wanderjahren (1955–59)\nthrough a succession of diplomatic/educational posts in Sweden,\nGermany, and Poland. A study of the emergence of the modern concept of\n“mental illness” in Europe, History of Madness is\nformed from both Foucault’s extensive archival work and his\nintense anger at what he saw as the moral hypocrisy of modern\npsychiatry.\nStandard histories saw the nineteenth-century medical\ntreatment of madness (developed from the reforms of Pinel in France\nand the Tuke brothers in England) as an enlightened liberation of the\nmad from the ignorance and brutality of preceding ages. But, according\nto Foucault, the new idea that the mad were merely sick\n(“mentally” ill) and in need of medical treatment was not\nat all a clear improvement on earlier conceptions (e.g., the\nRenaissance idea that the mad were in contact with the mysterious\nforces of cosmic tragedy or the seventeenth-eighteenth-century view of\nmadness as a renouncing of reason). Moreover, he argued that the\nalleged scientific neutrality of modern medical treatments of insanity\nare in fact covers for controlling challenges to conventional\nbourgeois morality. In short, Foucault argued that what was presented\nas an objective, incontrovertible scientific discovery (that madness\nis mental illness) was in fact the product of eminently questionable\nsocial and ethical commitments. \nFoucault’s next history, The Birth of the Clinic (1963)\nalso presents a critique of modern clinical medicine. But the\nsocio-ethical critique is muted (except for a few vehement passages),\npresumably because there is a substantial core of objective truth in\nmedicine (as opposed to psychiatry) and so less basis for criticism.\nAs a result The Birth of the Clinic is much closer to a\nstandard history of science, in the tradition of Canguilhem’s\nhistory of concepts. \nThe book that made Foucault famous, Les mots et les choses\n(translated into English under the title The Order of\nThings), is in many ways an odd interpolation into the\ndevelopment of his thought. Its subtitle, “An Archaeology of the\nHuman Sciences”, suggests an expansion of the earlier critical\nhistories of psychiatry and clinical medicine into other modern\ndisciplines such as economics, biology, and philology. And indeed\nthere is an extensive account of the various “empirical\ndisciplines” of the Renaissance and the Classical Age that\nprecede these modern human sciences. But there is little or nothing of\nthe implicit social critique found in the History of Madness\nor even The Birth of the Clinic. Instead, Foucault offers an\nanalysis of what knowledge meant—and how this meaning\nchanged—in Western thought from the Renaissance to the present.\nAt the heart of his account is the notion of representation. Here we\nfocus on his treatment of representation in philosophical thought,\nwhere we find Foucault’s most direct engagement with traditional\nphilosophical questions. \nFoucault argues that from Descartes up to Kant (during what he calls\nthe Classical Age) representation was simply assimilated to thought:\nto think just was to employ ideas to represent the object of thought.\nBut, he says, we need to be clear about what it meant for an idea to\nrepresent an object. This was not, first of all, any sort of relation\nof resemblance: there were no features (properties) of the idea that\nthemselves constituted the representation of the object. (Saying this,\nhowever, does not require that the idea itself have no properties or\neven that these properties are not relevant to the idea’s\nrepresentation of the object.) By contrast, during the Renaissance,\nknowledge was understood as a matter of resemblance between\nthings. \nThe map is a useful model of Classical representation. It consists,\nfor example, of a set of lines of varying widths, lengths, and colors,\nand thereby represents the roads in and around a city. This is not\nbecause the roads have the properties of the map (the widths, lengths,\nand colors of the lines) but because the abstract structure given in\nthe map (the relations among the lines) duplicates the abstract\nstructure of the roads. At the heart of Classical thought is the\nprinciple that we know in virtue of having ideas that, in this sense,\nrepresent what we know. Of course, in contrast to the map, we do not\nneed to know what the actual features of our ideas are in virtue of\nwhich they are able to represent. (In Descartes’ scholastic\nterminology, we do not need to know their “formal\nreality”.) We need to know only the abstract structure that they\nshare with the things they represent (the structure of what Descartes\ncalls their “objective reality”). We do, however, have\ndirect (introspective) access to the abstract structures of our ideas:\nwe can “see” what representational structure they have.\nFurther, we can alter an idea’s structure to make it a better\nrepresentation of an object, as we can alter a map to improve it. \nHow, on the Classical view, do we know that an idea is a\nrepresentation of an object—and an adequate representation? Not,\nFoucault argues, by comparing the idea with the object as it is apart\nfrom its representation. This is impossible, since it would require\nknowing the object without a representation (when, for Classical\nthought, to know is to represent). The only possibility is\nthat the idea itself must make it apparent that it is a\nrepresentation. The idea represents the very fact that it is a\nrepresentation. As to the question of whether an idea is a\nrepresentation, this “self-referential” feature is all\nthere is to it. As to adequacy, it must be that some subset of ideas\nlikewise bear witness to their own adequacy—as, for example,\nDescartes’ “clear and distinct perceptions” or\nHume’s simple impressions. In this sense, early modern\nphilosophy is based on “intuition” (intellectual or\nsensory). Note, however, that an “intuition” of an\nidea’s adequacy does not, of itself, establish the independent\nexistence of the object represented by the idea. As far as the early\nmodern view is concerned, there may be no such objects; or, if there\nare, this needs to be established by some other means (e.g., an\nargument or some other sort of intuition). \nWe see, then, that for Foucault the key to Classical knowing is the\nidea, that is, mental representation. Classical thinkers might\ndisagree about the actual ontological status of ideas (their formal\nreality); but they all agreed that as representations (epistemically,\nif not ontologically) they were “non-physical” and\n“non-historical”; that is, precisely as representing their\nobjects, they could not be conceived as having any role in the causal\nnetworks of the natural or the human worlds. From this it further\nfollowed that language—precisely as a physical and/or historical\nreality—could have no fundamental role in knowledge. Language\ncould be nothing more than a higher-order instrument of thought: a\nphysical representation of ideas, having no meaning except in relation\nto them. \nFoucault maintains that the great “turn” in modern\nphilosophy occurs with Kant (though presumably he is merely an example\nof something much broader and deeper). Kant raises the question of\nwhether ideas do in fact represent their objects and, if so, how (in\nvirtue of what) they do so. In other words, ideas are no longer taken\nas the unproblematic vehicles of knowledge; it is now possible to\nthink that knowledge might be (or have roots in) something other than\nrepresentation. This did not mean that representation had nothing at\nall to do with knowledge. Perhaps some (or even all) knowledge still\nessentially involved ideas’ representing objects. But, Foucault\ninsists, the thought that was only now (with Kant) possible was that\nrepresentation itself (and the ideas that represented) could have an\norigin in something other than representation. \nThis thought, according to Foucault, led to some important and\ndistinctively modern possibilities. The first was developed by Kant\nhimself, who thought that representations (thoughts or ideas) were\nthemselves the product of (“constituted” by) the mind.\nNot, however, produced by the mind as a natural or historical reality,\nbut as belonging to a special epistemic realm: transcendental\nsubjectivity. Kant thus maintained the Classical view that knowledge\ncannot be understood as a physical or historical reality, but he\nlocated the grounds of knowledge in a domain (the transcendental) more\nfundamental than the ideas it subtended. We must add, of course, that\nKant also did not think of this domain as possessing a reality beyond\nthe historical and the physical; it was not metaphysical.\nBut this metaphysical alternative was explored by the idealistic\nmetaphysics that followed Kant. Another—and in some ways more\ntypically modern—view was that ideas were themselves historical\nrealities.  This could be most plausibly developed, as Herder did, by\ntying ideas essentially to language, now regarded as the primary (and\nhistoricized) vehicle of knowledge. But such an approach was not\nviable in its pure form, since to make knowledge entirely historical\nwould deprive it of any normative character and so destroy its\ncharacter as knowledge. In other words, even when modern thought made\nknowledge essentially historical, it had to retain some functional\nequivalent of Kant’s transcendental realm to guarantee the\nnormative validity of knowledge. \nAt this point, The Order of Things introduces the two central\nfeatures of thought after Kant: the return of language and the\n“birth of man”. Our discussion above readily explains why\nFoucault talks of a return of language: it now has an independent and\nessential role that it did not have in the Classical view. But the\nreturn is not a monolithic phenomenon. Language is related to\nknowledge in diverse ways, each of which corresponds a distinctive\nsort of “return”. So, for example, the history of natural\nlanguages has introduced confusions and distortions that we can try to\neliminate through techniques of formalization. \nOn the other hand, this\nsame history may have deposited fundamental truths in our languages\nthat we can unearth only by the methods of hermeneutic interpretation.\n(So these two apparently opposed approaches—underlying \nthe division of analytic and continental philosophy—are in fact,\naccording to Foucault, complementary projects of modern thought.) But\nthere is yet another possibility: freed from its subordination to\nideas, language can function (as in the Renaissance) as an autonomous\nreality—indeed as even more deeply autonomous than Renaissance\nlanguage, since there is no system of resemblances binding it to the\nworld. Even more, Foucault suggests, language is a truth unto itself,\nspeaking nothing other than its own meaning. \nThis is the realm of\n“pure literature”, evoked by Mallarmé when he\nanswered Nietzsche’s (genealogical) question, “Who is\nspeaking?” with, “Language itself”. In contrast to\nthe Renaissance, however, there is no divine Word underlying and\ngiving unique truth to the words of language. Literature is literally\nnothing but language—or rather many languages, speaking for and\nof themselves. \nEven more important than language is the figure of man. The most\nimportant point about “man” is that it is an\nepistemological concept. Man, Foucault says, did not exist during the\nClassical age (or before). This is not because there was no idea of\nhuman beings as a species or of human nature as a psychological,\nmoral, or political reality. Rather, “there was no\nepistemological consciousness of man as such” (The Order of\nThings, [1973: 309]). But even “epistemological”\nneeds construal. There is no doubt that even in the Classical age\nhuman beings were conceived as the locus of knowledge (since humans\npossess the ideas that represent the world). The notion of man, on the\nother hand, is epistemological in the Kantian sense of a\ntranscendental subject that is also an empirical object. For the\nClassical age, human beings are the locus of representations but not,\nas for Kant, their source. There is, in Classical thought, no room for\nthe modern notion of “constitution”. \nFoucault illustrates his point through a striking discussion of\nDescartes’ cogito, showing why it is an indubitable certitude\nwithin the classical episteme, but not within the modern episteme.\nThere are two ways of questioning the force of the cogito. One is to\nsuggest that the subject (the thinking self, the I) that Descartes\nconcludes necessarily exists in the act of thinking is something more\nthan just the act of representing objects; so we can’t go from\nrepresentation to a thinker. But for the Classical Age this makes no\nsense, since thinking is representation. A second criticism would be\nthat the self as representer may not be “really real” but\nmerely the “product of” (constituted by) a mind that is\nreal in a fuller sense. But this objection has weight only if we can\nthink of this “more real” mind as having the self as an\nobject in some sense other than representing it. (Otherwise, there is\nno basis for saying that the self as representer is “less\nreal”.) But, once again, this is precisely what cannot be\nthought in Classical terms. \nAt the very heart of man is his finitude: the fact that, as described\nby the modern empirical sciences, he is limited by the various\nhistorical forces (organic, economic, linguistic) operating on him.\nThis finitude is a philosophical problem because man as a historically\nlimited empirical being must somehow also be the source of the\nrepresentations whereby we know the empirical world, including\nourselves as empirical beings. I (my consciousness) must, as Kant put\nit, be both an empirical object of representation and the\ntranscendental source of representations. How is this possible?\nFoucault’s view is that, in the end, it isn’t—and\nthat the impossibility (historically realized) means the collapse of\nthe modern episteme. What Foucault calls the “analytic of\nfinitude” sketches the historical case for this conclusion,\nexamining the major efforts (together making up the heart of modern\nphilosophy) to understand man as\n“empirico-transcendental”. \nThe question—and the basic strategy for answering it—go\nback, of course, to Kant, who put forward the following crucial idea:\nthat the very factors that make us finite (our subjection to space,\ntime, causality, etc.) are also conditions necessary for the\npossibility of empirical knowledge. Our finitude is, therefore,\nsimultaneously founded and founding (positive and fundamental, as\nFoucault puts it). The project of modern (Kantian and post-Kantian)\nphilosophy—the analytic of finitude—is to show how this is\npossible. \nSome modern philosophy tries to resolve the problem of man by, in\neffect, reducing the transcendental to the empirical. For example,\nnaturalism attempts to explain knowledge in terms of natural science\n(physics, biology), while Marxism appeals to historical social\nsciences. (The difference is that the first grounds knowledge in the\npast—e.g., an evolutionary history—whereas the second\ngrounds it in a revolutionary future that will transcend the\nlimitations of ideology.) Either approach simply ignores the terms of\nthe problem: that man must be regarded as irreducibly both empirical\nand transcendental. \n\nIt might seem that Husserl’s phenomenology has carried out the\nKantian project of synthesizing man as object and man as subject by\nradicalizing the Cartesian project; that is, by grounding our\nknowledge of empirical truths in the transcendental subject. The\nproblem, however, is that, as Foucault sees it, the modern notion of man excludes\nDescartes’ idea of the cogito as a “sovereign\ntransparency” of pure consciousness. Thought is no longer pure\nrepresentation and therefore cannot be separated from an\n“unthought” (i.e., the given empirical and historical\ntruths about who we are). I can no longer go from “I\nthink” to “I am” because the content of my reality\n(what I am) is always more than the content of any merely thinking\nself (I am, e.g., living, working, and speaking—and all these\ntake me beyond the realm of mere thought). Or, conversely, if we use\n“I” to denote me simply as a conscious being, then I\n“am not” much of what I (as a self in the world) am. As a\nresult, to the extent that Husserl has grounded everything in the\ntranscendental subject, this is not the subject (cogito) of Descartes\nbut the modern cogito, which includes the (empirical) unthought.\nPhenomenology, like all modern thought, must accept the unthought as\nthe ineliminable “other” of man. Nor are the existential\nphenomenologists (Sartre and Merleau-Ponty) able to solve the problem.\nUnlike Husserl, they avoid positing a transcendental ego and instead\nfocus on the concrete reality of man-in-the world. But this, Foucault\nclaims, is just a more subtle way of reducing the transcendental to\nthe empirical. \nFinally, some philosophers (Hegel and Marx in one way, Nietzsche and\nHeidegger in another) have tried to resolve the problem of man’s\ndual status by treating him as a historical reality. But this move\nencounters the difficulty that man has to be both a product of\nhistorical processes and the origin of history. If we treat man as a\nproduct, we find ourselves reducing his reality to something non-human\n(this is what Foucault calls the “retreat” from\nman’s origin). But if we insist on a “return” to man\nas his own proper origin, then we can no longer make sense of his\nplace in the empirical world. This paradox may explain the endless\nmodern obsession with origins, but there is never any way out of the\ncontradiction between man as originator and man as originated.\nNonetheless, Foucault thinks that the modern pursuit of the question\nof origins has provided us with a deeper sense of the ontological\nsignificance of time, particularly in the thought of Nietzsche and\nHeidegger, who reject Hegel’s and Marx’s view of the\nreturn to our origin as a redemptive fullness of being, and instead\nsee it as a confrontation with the nothingness of our existence.\n \nFoucault explicitly presents The Order of Things as an\n“archaeological” approach to the history of thought. Three\nyears later, in 1969, he published The Archaeology of\nKnowledge, a methodological treatise that explicitly formulates\nwhat he took to be the archaeological method that he used not only in\nThe Order of Things but also (at least implicitly) in\nHistory of Madness and The Birth of the Clinic. The\nkey idea of the archaeological method is that systems of thought and\nknowledge (epistemes or discursive formations, in Foucault’s\nterminology) are governed by rules, beyond those of grammar and logic,\nthat operate beneath the consciousness of individual subjects and\ndefine a system of conceptual possibilities that determines the\nboundaries of thought in a given domain and period. So, for example,\nHistory of Madness should, Foucault maintained, be read as an\nintellectual excavation of the radically different discursive\nformations that governed talk and thought about madness from the\nseventeenth through the nineteenth centuries. \nArchaeology was an essential method for Foucault because it supported\na historiography that did not rest on the primacy of the consciousness\nof individual subjects; it allowed the historian of thought to operate\nat an unconscious level that displaced the primacy of the subject\nfound in both phenomenology and in traditional historiography.\nHowever, archaeology’s critical force was restricted to the\ncomparison of the discursive formations of different periods. Such\ncomparisons could suggest the contingency of a given way of thinking\nby showing that the people living in previous ages had thought very\ndifferently (and, apparently, just as effectively). But mere\narchaeological analysis could say nothing about the causes of the\ntransition from one way of thinking to another and so had to ignore\nperhaps the most forceful case for the contingency of entrenched\ncontemporary positions. Genealogy, the new method first deployed in\nDiscipline and Punish, was intended to remedy this\ndeficiency. \nFoucault intended the term “genealogy” to evoke\nNietzsche’s genealogy of morals, particularly with its\nsuggestion of complex, mundane, inglorious origins—in no way\npart of any grand scheme of progressive history. The point of a\ngenealogical analysis is to show that a given system of thought\n(itself uncovered in its essential structures by archaeology, which\ntherefore remains part of Foucault’s historiography) was the\nresult of contingent turns of history, not the outcome of rationally\ninevitable trends. \nDiscipline and Punish, published in 1975, is a genealogical study of the\ndevelopment of the “gentler” modern way of imprisoning\ncriminals rather than torturing or killing them. While recognizing the\nelement of genuinely enlightened reform, Foucault particularly\nemphasizes how such reform also becomes a vehicle of more effective\ncontrol: “to punish less, perhaps; but certainly to punish\nbetter”. He further argues that the new mode of punishment\nbecomes the model for control of an entire society, with factories,\nhospitals, and schools modeled on the modern prison. We should not,\nhowever, think that the deployment of this model was due to the\nexplicit decisions of some central controlling agency.\nFoucault’s analysis shows how techniques and institutions,\ndeveloped for different and often quite innocuous purposes, converged\nto create the modern system of disciplinary power. \nAt the core of Foucault’s picture of modern disciplinary society\nare three primary techniques of control: hierarchical observation,\nnormalizing judgment, and the examination. To a great extent, control\nover people (power) can be achieved merely by observing them. So, for\nexample, the tiered rows of seats in a stadium not only makes it easy\nfor spectators to see but also for guards or security cameras to scan\nthe audience. A perfect system of observation would allow one\n“guard” to see everything (a situation approximated, as we\nshall see, in Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon). But since this is\nnot usually possible, there is a need for “relays” of\nobservers, hierarchically ordered, through whom observed data passes\nfrom lower to higher levels. \nA distinctive feature of modern power (disciplinary control) is its\nconcern with what people have not done (nonobservence), with, that is,\na person’s failure to reach required standards. This concern\nillustrates the primary function of modern disciplinary systems: to\ncorrect deviant behavior. The main goal is not revenge (as in the case\nof the tortures of premodern punishment) but reform, where reform\nmeans primarily coming to live by society’s standards or norms.\nDiscipline through imposing precise and detailed norms\n(“normalization”) is quite different from the older system\nof judicial punishment, which merely judges each action as allowed by\nthe law or not allowed by the law and does not say that those judged\nare “normal” or “abnormal”. This idea of\nnormalization is pervasive in our society: e.g., national standards\nfor educational programs, for medical practice, for industrial\nprocesses and products. \nThe examination (for example, of students in schools, of patients in\nhospitals) is a method of control that combines hierarchical\nobservation with normalizing judgment. It is a prime example of what\nFoucault calls power/knowledge, since it combines into a unified whole\n“the deployment of force and the establishment of truth”\n(1975 [1977: 184]). It both elicits the truth about those who undergo\nthe examination (tells what they know or what is the state of their\nhealth) and controls their behavior (by forcing them to study or\ndirecting them to a course of treatment). \nOn Foucault’s account, the relation of power and knowledge is\nfar closer than in the familiar Baconian engineering model, for which\n“knowledge is power” means that knowledge is an instrument\nof power, although the two exist quite independently. Foucault’s\npoint is rather that, at least for the study of human beings, the\ngoals of power and the goals of knowledge cannot be separated: in\nknowing we control and in controlling we know. \nThe examination also situates individuals in a “field of\ndocumentation”. The results of exams are recorded in documents\nthat provide detailed information about the individuals examined and\nallow power systems to control them (e.g., absentee records for\nschools, patients’ charts in hospitals). On the basis of these\nrecords, those in control can formulate categories, averages, and\nnorms that are in turn a basis for knowledge. The examination turns\nthe individual into a “case”—in both senses of the\nterm: a scientific example and an object of care. Caring is always\nalso an opportunity for control. \nBentham’s Panopticon is, for Foucault, a paradigmatic\narchitectural model of modern disciplinary power. It is a design for a\nprison, built so that each inmate is separated from and invisible to\nall the others (in separate “cells”) and each inmate is\nalways visible to a monitor situated in a central tower. Monitors do\nnot in fact always see each inmate; the point is that they\ncould at any time. Since inmates never know whether they are\nbeing observed, they must behave as if they are always seen and\nobserved. As a result, control is achieved more by the possibility of\ninternal monitoring of those controlled than by actual supervision or\nheavy physical constraints. \nThe principle of the Panopticon can be applied not only to prisons but\nalso to any system of disciplinary power (a factory, a hospital, a\nschool). And, in fact, although Bentham himself was never able to\nbuild it, its principle has come to pervade aspects of modern society.\nIt is the instrument through which modern discipline has been able to\nreplace pre-modern sovereignty (kings, judges) as the fundamental\npower relation. \nFoucault’s genealogy follows Nietzsche as well as existential\nphenomenology in that it aims to bring the body into the focus of\nhistory. Rather than histories of mentalities or ideas, genealogies\nare “histories of the body”. They examine the historical\npractices through which the body becomes an object of techniques and\ndeployments of power. In Discipline and Punish, Foucault\nshows how disciplinary techniques produce “docile bodies”:\nbodies of prisoners, soldiers, workers and schoolchildren were\nsubjected to disciplinary power in order to make them more useful and\nat the same time easier to control. The human body became a machine\nthe functioning of which could be optimized, calculated, and improved.\nIts functions, movements and capabilities were broken down into narrow\nsegments, analyzed in detail and recomposed in a maximally effective\nway. \nBy historicizing the body, Foucault’s genealogies also have\ndistinctive philosophical implications. They question the naturalistic\nexplanatory framework that understands human nature—uncovered by\nscience—as the basis for such complex areas of behavior as\nsexuality, insanity or criminality. A key idea in Foucault’s\nhistorical analysis of the modern penal institutions is that they\noperate with markedly different rationality than those that are aimed\nsolely at retribution through pain. He effectively reveals the double\nrole of the present system: it aims at both punishing and correcting,\nand therefore it mixes juridical and scientific practices. Foucault\nargued that the intervention of criminal psychiatry in the field of\nlaw that occurred at the beginning of the nineteenth century, for\nexample, was part of the gradual shift in penal practice from a focus\non the crime to a focus on the criminal, from the action to agency and\npersonality. The new idea of the “dangerous individual”\nreferred to the danger potentially inherent in the criminal person.\nThe new rationality could not function in an effective way in the\nexisting system without the emergence of new forms of scientific\nknowledge such as criminal psychiatry that enabled the\ncharacterization of criminals in themselves, beneath their acts.\nFoucault suggests that this shift resulted in the emergence of new,\ninsidious forms of domination and violence. The critical impact of\nDiscipline and Punish thus lies in its ability to reveal the\nprocesses of subject formation that operate in modern penal\ninstitutions. The modern prison does not just punish by depriving its\ninmates of liberty, it categorizes them as delinquent subjects, types\nof people with a dangerous, criminal nature. \nFoucault’s history of sexuality was originally projected as a\nfairly straightforward extension of the genealogical approach of\nDiscipline and Punish to the topic of sexuality.\nFoucault’s idea is that the various modern fields of knowledge\nabout sexuality (various “sciences of sexuality”,\nincluding psychoanalysis) have an intimate association with the power\nstructures of modern society and so are prime candidates for\ngenealogical analysis. The first volume of this project, published in\n1976, was intended as the introduction to a series of studies on\nparticular aspects of modern sexuality (children, women,\n“perverts”, population, etc.). It outlined the project of\nthe overall history, explaining the basic viewpoint and the methods to\nbe used. \nOn Foucault’s account, modern control of sexuality parallels\nmodern control of criminality by making sex (like crime) an object of\nallegedly scientific disciplines, which simultaneously offer knowledge\nand domination of their objects. However, it becomes apparent that\nthere is a further dimension in the power associated with the sciences\nof sexuality. Not only is there control exercised via other\npeople’s knowledge of individuals such as doctors’\nknowledge, for example; there is also control via individuals’\nknowledge of themselves. Individuals internalize the norms laid down\nby the sciences of sexuality and monitor themselves in an effort to\nconform to these norms. Thus, they are controlled not only as\nobjects of disciplines but also as self-scrutinizing and\nself-forming subjects. \nFoucault shows how sexuality becomes an essential construct in\ndetermining not only moral worth, but also health, desire, and\nidentity. Subjects are further obligated to tell the truth about\nthemselves by confessing the details of their sexuality. Foucault\nargued that modern sexuality was characterized by the secularization\nof religious techniques of confession: one no longer confesses the\ndetails of one’s sexual desire to a priest; one goes to a\ndoctor, a therapist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist. \nThe book begins with a repudiation of the “repressive\nhypothesis”, the idea that sexuality in the Victorian era was\nrepressed and discourse on it silenced. Foucault claims that it was\nnot repression that characterized the primary attitude of modern\nsociety towards sex; rather, sexuality became the object of new kinds\nof discourse—medical, juridical and psychological ­–\nand that discourse on it actually increased. Sexuality was\ninextricably linked to truth: these new discourses were able to tell\nus the scientific truth about ourselves through our sexuality. \nAlthough the book is a historical study of the emergence of modern\nsexuality in the nineteenth century, Foucault’s targets were\nalso contemporary ideas and practices. The prevalent views on\nsexuality in the 1960s and 1970s held that there was a natural and\nhealthy sexuality that all human beings shared simply in virtue of\nbeing human, and this sexuality was presently repressed by cultural\nprohibitions and conventions such as bourgeois morality and capitalist\nsocio-economic structures. Repressed sexuality was the cause of\nvarious neuroses and it was important to have an active and free\nsexuality. The popular discourse on sexuality thus fervently argued\nfor sexual liberation: we had to liberate our true sexuality from the\nrepressive mechanisms of power. \nFoucault challenged this view by showing how our conceptions and\nexperiences of sexuality are in fact always the result of specific\ncultural conventions and mechanisms of power and could not exist\nindependently of them. The mission to liberate our repressed sexuality\nwas thus fundamentally misguided because there was no authentic or\nnatural sexuality to liberate. To free oneself from one set of norms\nonly meant adopting different norms in their stead, and that could\nturn out to be just as controlling and normalizing. He wrote mockingly\nthat the irony of our endless preoccupation with sexuality was that we\nbelieved that it had something to do with our liberation. \nIn order to challenge the dominant view of the relationship between\nsexuality and repressive power, Foucault had to re-conceive the nature\nof power. His major claim is that power is not essentially repressive\nbut productive. It does not operate by repressing and prohibiting the\ntrue and authentic expressions of a natural sexuality. Instead it\nproduces, through cultural normative practices and scientific\ndiscourses, the ways in which we experience and conceive of our\nsexuality. Power relations are “the internal conditions”\nof our sexual identities. \nFoucault outlined what became one of the most influential contemporary\nunderstandings of power in a series of short propositions over three\npages of The History of Sexuality, Volume 1. He elucidated\nand developed this understanding of power in a number of essays,\nlectures and interviews throughout the rest of his life, but the basic\nidea was already present in these pages. We should not try to look for\nthe center of power, or for the individuals, institutions or classes\nthat rule, but should rather construct a “microphysics of\npower” that focuses on the multitude of loci of power spread\nthroughout a society: families, workplaces, everyday practices, and\nmarginal institutions. One has to analyze power relations from the\nbottom up and not from the top down, and to study the myriad ways in\nwhich the subjects themselves are constituted in these diverse but\nintersecting networks. \nAlthough dispersed among various interlacing networks throughout\nsociety, power nevertheless has a rationality, a series of aims and\nobjectives, and the means of attaining them. This does not imply that\nany individual has consciously formulated them. As the example of the\nPanopticon shows, power often functions according to a clear\nrationality irrespective of the intentions and motives of the\nindividual who guards the prison from the tower. Despite the\ncentrality of the Panopticon as a model for power, Foucault does not\nhold that power forms a deterministic system of overbearing\nconstraints. Power should rather be understood and analyzed as an\nunstable network of practices implying that where there is power,\nthere is always resistance too. Just as there is no center of power,\nthere is no center of resistance somewhere outside of it. Resistance\nis rather inherent in power relations and their dynamics, it is\n“the odd term in the relations of power” (1976 [1978:\n96]). While power relations permeate the whole body of society, they\nmay be denser in some regions and less dense in others. \nFoucault’s short but influential discussion of biopower also\nfirst appears at the end of The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1.\nFoucault contrasts it to what he calls sovereign power: a form of\npower that was historically founded on violence—the right to\nkill. It was exercised mainly by “deduction” (taking\nsomething away): it consisted of the right to appropriate a portion of\nthe nation’s wealth, for example by imposing a tax on products,\ngoods and services, or by demanding a portion of the subjects’\ntime, strength, and ultimately life itself. The obligation to wage war\non behalf of the sovereign and the imposition of death penalty for\ngoing against his will were the clearest forms of such power. But\nFoucault claims that the West has undergone a profound transformation\nin its mechanisms of power since the seventeenth century. Deductive\nand violent sovereign power has been gradually complemented and partly\nreplaced by biopower, a form of power that exerts a positive influence\non life, “that endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply\nit, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive\nregulations” (1976 [1978: 137]). This era of biopower is marked\nby the explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the\ncontrol of populations: techniques that, for example, coordinate\nmedical care, normalize behavior, rationalize mechanisms of insurance,\nand rethink urban planning. The aim is the effective administration of\nbodies and the calculated management of life through means that are\nscientific and continuous. Mechanisms of power and knowledge have\nassumed responsibility for the life process in order to optimize,\ncontrol, and modify it. The exercise of power over living beings no\nlonger carries the threat of death, but instead takes charge of their\nlives. \nThe rationality of biopower is markedly different from that of\nsovereign power in terms not just of its objectives, but also of its\ninstruments. A major consequence of its development is the growing\nimportance of norms at the expense of the juridical system of the law.\nFoucault claims that the dominance of biopower as the paradigmatic\nform of power means that we live in a society in which the power of\nthe law has subsided in favor of regulative and corrective mechanisms\nbased on scientific knowledge. Biopower penetrates traditional forms\nof political power, but it is essentially the power of experts and\nadministrators. \nThe genealogical attempt to historicize the body is prominent also in\nThe History of Sexuality, Vol. 1, but now Foucault’s\ntarget is the naturalist explanations of sex and sexuality. At the end\nof the book Foucault takes up the question of whether we can find a\nscientific truth about sex. He makes clear that his genealogical\ninvestigation of sexuality implies a challenge to a certain kind of\nexplanatory framework of sexuality and gender: the idea of sex as a\nnatural foundation or an unobserved cause, which supports the visible\neffects of gender and sexuality. He critically appraises the idea of a\nnatural, scientifically defined true sex by revealing the historical\ndevelopment of this form of thought. He does not claim that sex,\nunderstood as the categories of maleness and femaleness, was invented\nin a particular historical period. He rather analyses the ways in\nwhich these categories were founded and explained in discourses\nclaiming the status of scientific truth, and how this allegedly\n“pure” explanation in fact constituted these categories so\nthat they were understood as “natural”. This idea has had\nenormous influence on feminist philosophers and queer theorists.\nJudith Butler has appropriated this idea in her influential book\nGender Trouble to argue that allegedly scientific ideas of\nsex as a natural and necessary ground for sexual and gendered\nidentities in fact have a normative function: they constitute our\nconceptions of “normal” men and women and their\n“natural” sexual desire for each other. \nFoucault’s final engagement with traditional philosophy arises\nfrom the turn toward the ancient world he took in the last few years\nof his life. The History of Sexuality had been planned as a\nmulti-volume work on various themes in a study of modern sexuality.\nThe first volume, discussed above, was a general introduction.\nFoucault wrote a second volume (Les aveux de la chair) that\ndealt with the origins of the modern notion of the subject in the\npractices of Christian confession, but he never published it. (It was\npublished posthumously in 2018.) His concern was that a proper\nunderstanding of the Christian development required a comparison with\nancient conceptions of the ethical self, something he undertook in his\nlast two books (1984) on Greek and Roman sexuality: The Use of\nPleasure and The Care of the Self. \nThese treatments of ancient sexuality moved Foucault into ethical\nissues that had been implicit but seldom explicitly thematized in his\nearlier writings. What emerges out of his historical studies of\nancient sexuality is a particular conception of ethics that he traces\nto antiquity. In the ancient conception, ethics referred to the\npractice through which one forms oneself as an ethical subject\nfollowing the prescriptive elements of morality. It concerns the way\nin which moral rules can be adopted and problematized by the subjects\nthemselves. \nThe importance of a study of ethics becomes apparent when we try to\nmake visible the difference between the morality of antiquity and that\nof Christianity. Foucault’s specific goal was to compare ancient\npagan and Christian ethics through the test-case of sexuality and to\ntrace the development of Christian ideas about sex from the very\ndifferent ideas of the ancients. He argues that, contrary to what is\noften believed, on the level of moral codes of behavior, there are in\nfact striking similarities between antiquity and Christianity. Both\nshared, for example, a concern that sexual expenditure could harm an\nindividual’s health, and they both valued conjugal fidelity and\nsexual abstinence. But there was a strong contrast in the ways these\ntwo cultures understood and practiced these ideals and demands. \nIn the Christian view sexual acts were, on the whole, evil in\nthemselves and most forms of sexual activity were simply forbidden. A\nmain emphasis in Christian morality is therefore on the moral code,\nits systematicity, its richness, and its capacity to adjust to every\npossible case and to embrace every area of behavior. The rules in\nChristian monasteries, for example, were not only very severe, but\nalso extremely detailed. The morality of antiquity, on the other hand,\nis one in which the code and rules of behavior are rudimentary. The\nancient Greeks’ view was that sexual acts were natural and\nnecessary, but subject to abuse. They emphasized the proper use\n(chresis) of pleasures, where this involved engaging in a\nrange of sexual activities (heterosexual, homosexual, in marriage, out\nof marriage), but with proper moderation. Their texts discussing\nmorality therefore lay down very few explicit rules or guidelines on\nthe kinds of sexual acts that one should engage in. More important\nthan the moral rules was the relationship that one had with oneself,\nthe choice of the “style of existence” made by the\nindividual. Sexual austerity, for example, was not practiced as a\nresult of prohibitions, but because of a personal choice to live a\nbeautiful life and to leave to others memories of a beautiful\nexistence. Sex for the Greeks was a major part of what Foucault called\nan “aesthetics of existence”: the self’s creation of\na beautiful and enjoyable existence. \nFoucault’s last two books are an attempt to make a contribution\nto the task of rethinking ethics, but they are also a continuation of\nhis attempt to rethink the subject. Now the focus is on the forms of\nunderstanding that subjects create about themselves and the practices\nby which they transform their mode of being. In his study of ancient\nGreek ethics, Foucault continued to pursue his idea that there was no\ntrue self that could be deciphered and emancipated, but that the self\nwas something that had been—and must be—created. There is,\nhowever, a whole new axis of analysis present in his late studies of\nthe subject. While his earlier genealogical studies investigated the\nways in which power/knowledge networks constituted the subject, his\nlate work emphasizes the subject’s own role in this process. It\ntherefore offers a more complex understanding of the subject. Subjects\nare not simply constructed by power; they themselves partake in that\nconstruction and modify themselves through practices of the self. They\nare not just docile bodies, but actively refuse, adopt and alter forms\nof being a subject. One way of contesting normalizing power is by\nshaping oneself and one’s lifestyle creatively: by exploring\nopportunities for new ways of being, new fields of experience,\npleasures, relationships, modes of living and thinking.  \nFoucault left instructions that there should be no posthumous\npublication of his writings that he had not published in his lifetime.\nBut Foucault had allowed taping of his lectures, and his estate\ndecided that this amounted to permission to publish edited versions of\nhis public lectures based on his notes and tape recordings. This\ndecision has allowed print editions of the annual courses of lectures\nthat he delivered at the Collège de France from 1970–71\nthrough 1983–84 (except for a sabbatical year in 1976–77)\nas well as other lectures he gave in different universities around the\nworld. This has made an enormous body of important material available.\nSome of it covers work later published, but some presents ideas that\nappear nowhere else. \nThe lecture series Security, Territory, Population\n(1977–1978) and The Birth of Biopolitics\n(1978–1979) have been especially influential and introduce\nFoucault’s ideas on government and\ngovernmentality. “Government” becomes\nFoucault’s preferred term for power, while\n“governmentality” functions as his main theoretical tool\nfor analyzing its rationality, techniques, and procedures in the\nmodern world. \nFoucault shows that while government historically referred to a wide\nrange of practices, from religious guidance of the soul to ruling over\na territory and its inhabitants, in the context of the modern state it\nhas come to mean governing a population. Population as the object of\nmodern forms of government both required and encouraged the\ndevelopment of specific forms of knowledge such as statistical analysis\nas well as macro-economic and bio-scientific knowledge. The modern\nstate had to take care of the life and the wellbeing of its\npopulation, and Foucault therefore calls the politics of the modern\nstate biopolitics. \nIn Foucault’s original formulation, the term\n“governmentality” referred to the specific historical\ndevelopment of the essentially modern, complex techniques of power\nthat focused on the population. Later Foucault also gave the term a\nmore general meaning as “the way in which one conducts the\nconduct of men”. His key claim was that to understand the\npractice of government in this broad sense of controlling\npeople’s conduct, one had to study the specific technologies of\npower, but also the rationality underpinning them. The practices and\ninstitutions of government are always enabled, regulated, and\njustified by a specific form of reasoning or rationality that defines\ntheir ends and the suitable means of achieving them. To understand\npower as a set of relations, as Foucault repeatedly suggested, means\nunderstanding how such relations are rationalized. It means examining\nhow forms of rationality inscribe themselves in practices and systems\nof practices, and what role they play within them. \nThe exposition and analysis of the historically changing governmental\nrationalities was a pivotal goal of Foucault’s lectures. His\nanalysis makes clear that modern governmental rationality has two\nmajor features. On the one hand, the development of the modern state\nis characterized by the centralization of political power: a\ncentralized state with highly organized administration and bureaucracy\nhas emerged. While this feature is commonly analyzed and also\ncriticized in political thought, Foucault also identifies the\nevolution of a second feature that appears to be antagonistic to this\ndevelopment. He claims that the modern state is also characterized by\nindividualizing power—or “pastoral power” as he also\ncalls it. This is power that relies on individualizing knowledge about\na person’ life. The modern state required the\ndevelopment of power technologies oriented towards individuals in an\nattempt to govern their conduct in a continuous and permanent way. The\nresult is the intervention of the state in the everyday\nlife of individuals for example, their diet, mental health,\nand sexual practices. \nThe analysis of governmentality does not replace Foucault’s\nearlier understanding of power. His method of analysis is similar to\nthe one he used to study the techniques and practices of power in the\ncontext of particular, local institutions such as the prison. What had\nto be analyzed, but also questioned, were the historically specific\nrationalities intrinsic to practices. At the same time,\nFoucault’s analysis of governmentality adds new and important\ndimensions to his understanding of power. While his studies of\ndisciplinary power were restricted to specialized institutional\ncontexts, with the notion of government he was able to study larger,\nstrategic developments beyond the scope of his “microphysics of\npower”. He was able to transfer his understanding of power to\ndomains such as the state that were traditionally regarded as objects\nof political theory. With the idea of power as government, Foucault\nwas also able to clarify his understanding of resistance. Because\ngovernment refers to strategic, regulated and rationalized modes of\npower that have to be legitimized through forms of knowledge, the idea\nof critique as a form of resistance now becomes crucial. To govern is\nnot to physically determine the conduct of passive objects. Government\ninvolves offering reasons why those governed should do what they are\ntold, and this implies that they can also question these reasons.\nFoucault claims that this is why governmentality has historically\ndeveloped in tandem with the practice of political critique. The\npractice of critique must question the reasons for governing like\nthat: the legitimate principles, procedures and means of\ngoverning. \nIn the lecture series The Birth of Biopolitics, Foucault also\nengages in a lengthy examination of neoliberal governmentality. This\nanalysis has become seminal for contemporary political theory. Many\npolitical commentators now see the year 1979, when Foucault delivered\nhis lectures, as the inauguration of the dominance of neoliberal\neconomic policy in Europe and the United States. Almost forty years\nafter its expanding application, Foucault’s topic and his\ninsights appear farsighted. His analysis of neoliberalism is\ndistinctive in at least two significant ways. First, he analyzes\nneoliberalism as a historically novel form of governmentality—a\nrationality of governing connected with specific technologies of\npower. On Foucault’s account neoliberalism is not understood\njust as an economic doctrine, but as a governmental form that is\ndirected toward specific objectives, regulates itself through\ncontinuous reflection, and, essentially, aims to ensure that\ncapitalism works. It comprises a coherent political ontology, a set of\nphilosophical background beliefs about the nature of society, markets,\nand human beings. However, it is not an ideology in the sense of\nconsisting only of ideas or false beliefs. Its political ontology\nnecessitates and rationalizes a specific technology of\npower—specific practices of governing, as well as a particular\nway of reflecting on and problematizing these practices. \nFoucault also emphasizes that neoliberal governmentality should be\nviewed as a particular way of producing subjects: it produces an\neconomic subject structured by specific tendencies, preferences, and\nmotivations. It aims to create social conditions that not only\nencourage and necessitate competitiveness and self-interest, but also\nproduce them. Foucault discusses the work of the American neoliberal\neconomists, in particular Gary Becker and his theory of human capital,\nin order to show how neoliberal subjects are understood as navigating the\nsocial realm by constantly making rational choices based on economic\nknowledge and the strict calculation of the necessary costs and\ndesired benefits. Such subjects must make long-term and short-term\ninvestments in different aspects of their lives and acquire sufficient\neconomic knowledge to be able to calculate costs, risks, and possible\nreturns on the capital invested. \nFoucault never published any of the material developed in these two\nlecture series, and in the lectures in the 1980s he turned to examine\ntexts from ancient philosophy. Many of the ideas developed there were\nlater published as The Use of Pleasure and Care of the\nSelf. His studies of ancient sexuality, and, particularly, the\nidea of an aesthetics of existence also led him to the ancient idea of\nphilosophy as a way of life rather than a search for theoretical\ntruth. Although The Use of Pleasure has some discussion of\nPlato’s conception of philosophy, Foucault’s treatments of\nthe topic are primarily in lectures that he had no time to develop for\npublication. Some of these lectures discuss Socrates (in the\nApology and in Alcibiades I) as both a model and an\nexponent of a philosophical life focused on “care of the\nself” and follow the subsequent ancient discussions of this\ntopic in, for example, Epictetus, Seneca, and Plutarch. Other lectures\ndeal with the ancient ideal of “truthful speaking”\n(parrhesia), regarded as a central political and moral\nvirtue. Here Foucault discusses earlier formulations of the notion, in\nEuripides and Socrates, as well as its later transformations by the\nEpicureans, Stoics, and Cynics. This research project might have been\nthe most fruitful of all Foucault’s engagements with traditional\nphilosophy. But his early death in 1984 prevented him from completing\nit.","contact.mail":"Johanna.Oksala@helsinki.fi","contact.domain":"helsinki.fi"}]
