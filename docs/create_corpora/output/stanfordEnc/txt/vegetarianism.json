[{"date.published":"2018-09-14","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vegetarianism/","author1":"Tyler Doggett","entry":"vegetarianism","body.text":"\n\n\nBillions of humans eat meat. To provide it, we raise animals. We\ncontrol, hurt, and kill hundreds of millions of geese, nearly a\nbillion cattle, billions of pigs and ducks, and tens of billions of\nchickens each year.\n\n\nTo feed these animals, we raise crops. To raise crops, we deforest and\nuse huge quantities of water. To quench these animals, we use still\nmore water.\n\n\nIn turn, these animals produce staggering amounts of waste, waste that\npoisons water sources and soil. They produce staggering amounts of\ngreenhouse gasses.\n\n\nTo raise these animals and produce this meat, farmers and\nslaughterhouse workers labor in conditions from onerous to brutal.\n\n\nIf controlling, hurting, or killing animals is wrong or if the\nproduction of these environmental effects or effects on people is\nwrong or if consuming the meat produced is wrong, then a breathtaking\nlevel of wrong-doing goes on daily.\n\n\nMany fewer than a billion humans are vegetarian, have diets excluding\nmeat. They are vegetarian for various reasons: because it’s\nhealthy, because their parents make them be vegetarian, because they\ndon’t like meat. Some are vegetarian on moral grounds. Moral\nvegetarianism is the view that it is morally wrong—henceforth,\n“wrong”—to eat meat.\n\n\nThe topic of this entry is moral vegetarianism and the arguments for\nit. Strikingly, most contemporary arguments for moral vegetarianism\nstart with premises about the wrongness of producing meat and\nmove to conclusions about the wrongness of consuming it. They\ndo not fasten on some intrinsic feature of meat and insist that\nconsuming things with such a feature is wrong. They do not fasten on\nsome effect of meat-eating on the eater and insist that producing such\nan effect is wrong. Rather, they assert that the production of meat is\nwrong and that consumption bears a certain relation to production and\nthat bearing such a relation to wrongdoing is wrong. So this entry\ngives significant space to food production as well as the tricky\nbusiness of connecting production to consumption.\n\n\n§1 introduces relevant terminology and an overview of the main\npositions. §2 explains meat production,\nthe main moral arguments against it, and some responses to those arguments. That\nsection—like the rest of the entry—focuses on medium-sized\nland animals. Yet fish and insects are killed in a number that dwarfs\nthe number of land animals killed. Some issues these killings raise\nare covered in §3.\n\n\nNone of the foregoing is about consuming animals. §4 covers moral\narguments from premises about meat production to conclusions about\nmeat consumption. §5 considers some extensions of the arguments\nin §2. It wonders about which arguments against meat production\ncan, if sound, be extended to show that animal product production or\neven some plant production is morally wrong. This last idea is\nrelatively new. §6 briefly summarizes some other new issues in\nthe moral vegetarian literature.\n\nMoral vegetarianism is opposed by moral omnivorism, the view according\nto which it is permissible to consume meat (and also animal products,\nfungi, plants, etc.).  \nMoral veganism accepts moral vegetarianism and adds to it that\nconsuming animal products is wrong. Whereas in everyday life,\n“vegetarianism” and “veganism” include claims\nabout what one may eat, in this entry, the claims are simply\nabout what one may not eat. They agree that animals are among those\nthings. \nIn this entry, “animals” is used to refer to non-human\nanimals. For the most part, the animals discussed are the land animals\nfarmed for food in the West, especially cattle, chicken, and pigs.\nThere will be some discussion of insects and fish but none of dogs,\ndolphins, or whales. \nPrimarily, this entry concerns itself with whether moral vegetarians\nare correct that eating meat is wrong. Secondarily—but\nat greater length—it concerns itself with whether the\nproduction of meat is permissible. \nPrimarily, this entry concerns itself with eating in times of\nabundance and abundant choices. Moral vegans need not argue that it is\nwrong to eat an egg if that is the only way to save your life. Moral\nvegetarians need not argue it is wrong to eat seal meat if that is the\nonly food for miles. Moral omnivores need not argue it is permissible\nto eat the family dog. These cases raise important issues, but the\narguments in this entry are not about them. \nAlmost exclusively, the entry concerns itself with contemporary\n arguments.[1]\n Strikingly, many historical arguments and most contemporary arguments\nagainst the permissibility of eating meat start with premises about\nthe wrongness of producing meat and move to conclusions about\nthe wrongness of consuming it. That is, they argue that \nIt is wrong to eat meat \nBy first arguing that \nIt is wrong to produce meat. \nThe claim about production is the topic of §2. \nThe vast majority of animals humans eat come from industrial animal\nfarms that are distinguished by their holding large numbers of animals\nat high stocking density. We raise birds and mammals this way.\nIncreasingly, we raise fish this way, too.  \nRaising large numbers of animals enables farmers to take advantage of\neconomies of scale but also produces huge quantities of waste,\ngreenhouse gas, and, generally, environmental degradation (FAO 2006;\nHamerschlag 2011; Budolfson 2016). There is no question of whether to\nput so many animals on pasture—there is not enough of it. Plus,\nraising animals indoors, or with limited access to the outdoors,\nlowers costs and provides animals with protection from weather and\npredators. Yet when large numbers of animals live indoors, they are\ninvariably tightly packed, and raising them close together risks the\ndevelopment and quick spread of disease. To deal with this risk,\nfarmers intensively use prophylactic antibiotics. Tight-packing also\nrestricts species-typical behaviors, such as rooting (pigs) or\ndust-bathing (chickens), and makes it so that animals cannot escape\neach other, leading to stress and to antisocial behaviors like\ntail-biting in pigs or pecking in chickens. To deal with these,\nfarmers typically dock tails and trim beaks, and typically (in the\nU.S., at least) do so without anesthetic. Animals are bred to grow\nfast on a restricted amount of antibiotics, food, and hormones, and\nthe speed of growth saves farmers money, but this breeding causes\nhealth problems of its own. Chickens, for example, have been bred in\nsuch a way that their bodies become heavier than their bones can\nsupport. As a result, they “are in chronic pain for the last 20%\nof their lives” (John Webster, quoted in Erlichman 1991).\nAnimals are killed young—they taste better that way—and\nare killed in large-scale slaughterhouses operating at speed. Animal\nfarms have no use for, e.g., male chicks on egg-laying farms, are\nkilled at birth or soon\n after.[2] \nRaising animals in this way has produced low sticker prices (BLS\n2017). It enables us to feed our appetite for meat (OECD 2017). \nRaising animals in this way is also, in various ways, morally\nfraught. \nIt raises concerns about its effects on humans. Slaughterhouses,\nprocessing this huge number of animals at high speed, threaten injury\nand death to workers. Slaughterhouse work is exploitative. Its\ndistribution is classist, racist, and sexist with certain jobs being\nsegmented as paupers’ work or Latinx work or women’s\n(Pachirat 2011). \nIndustrial meat production poses a threat to public health through the\ncreation and spread of pathogens resulting from the overcrowding of\nanimals with weakened immune systems and the routine use of\nantibiotics and attendant creation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nAnomaly (2015) and Rossi & Garner (2014) argue that these risks\nare wrongful because unconsented to and because they are not justified\nby the benefits of assuming those risks. \nIndustrial meat production directly produces waste in the form of\ngreenhouse gas emissions from animals and staggering amounts of waste,\nwaste that, concentrated in those quantities, can contaminate water\nsupplies. The Böll Foundation (2014) estimates that farm animals\ncontribute between 6 and 32% of greenhouse gas emissions. The range is\ndue partly to different ideas about what to count as being farm\nanimals’ contributions: simply what comes out of their bodies?\nOr should we count, too, what comes from deforestation that’s\ndone to grow crops to feed them and other indirect emissions? \nIndustrial animal farming raises two concerns about wastefulness. One\nis that it uses too many resources and produces too much waste for the\namount of food it produces. The other is that feeding humans meat\ntypically requires producing crops, feeding them to animals, and then\neating the animals. So it typically requires more resources and makes\nfor more emissions than simply growing and feeding ourselves crops\n(PNAS 2013. \nIndustrial animal farming raises concerns about the treatment of\nanimals. Among others, we raise cattle, chickens, and pigs. Evidence\nfrom their behavior, their brains, and their evolutionary origins,\nadduced in Allen 2004, Andrews 2016, and Tye 2016, supports the view\nthat they have mental lives and, importantly, are sentient creatures\nwith likes and dislikes. Even chickens and other\n“birdbrains” have interesting mental lives. The exhaustive\nMarino 2017 collects evidence that chickens can adopt others’\nvisual perspectives, communicate deceptively, engage in arithmetic and\nsimple logical reasoning, and keep track of pecking orders and short\nincrements of time. Their personalities vary with respect to boldness,\nself-control, and vigilance. \nWe farm billions of these animals industrially each year (Böll\nFoundation 2014: 15). We also raise a much smaller number on freerange\nfarms. In this entry “freerange” is not used in its\ntightly-defined, misleading, legal sense according to which it applies\nonly to poultry and simply requires “access” to the\noutdoors. Instead, in the entry, freerange farms are farms that that,\nideally, let animals live natural lives while offering some protection\nfrom predators and the elements and some healthcare. These lives are\nin various ways more pleasant than lives on industrial farms but\ninvolve less protection while still involving control and early death.\nThese farms are designed, in part, to make animal lives go better for\nthem, and their design assumes that a natural life is better, other\nthings equal, than a non-natural life. The animal welfare literature\nconverges on this and also on other components of animal well-being.\nSummarizing some of that literature, David Fraser writes, \n[A]s people formulated and debated various proposals about what\nconstitutes a satisfactory life for animals in human care, three main\nconcerns emerged: (1) that animals should feel well by being spared\nnegative affect (pain, fear, hunger etc.) as much as possible, and by\nexperiencing positive affect in the form of contentment and normal\npleasures; (2) that animals should be able to lead reasonably natural\nlives by being able to perform important types of normal behavior and\nby having some natural elements in their environment such as fresh air\nand the ability to socialize with other animals in normal ways; and\n(3) that animals should function well in the sense of good health,\nnormal growth and development, and normal functioning of the body.\n(Fraser 2008: 70–71) \nIn this light, it is clear why industrial farming seems to do less for\nanimal welfare than freerange farming: The latter enables keeping\nanimals healthy. It enables happy states (“positive\naffect”) and puts up some safeguards against the infliction of\nsuffering. There is no need, for example, to dock freerange\npigs’ tails or to debeak freerange chickens, if they have enough\nspace to stay out of each other’s way. It enables animals to\nsocialize and to otherwise lead reasonably natural lives. A\nfreerange’s pig’s life is in those ways better than an\nindustrially-farmed pig’s. \nYet because freerange farming involves being outdoors, it involves\nvarious risks: predator- and weather-related risks, for example. These\ngo into the well-being calculus, too. \nAnimals in the wild are subjected to greater predator- and\nweather-related risks and have no health care. Yet they score very\nhighly with regard to expressing natural behavior and are under no\none’s control. How well they do with regard to positive and\nnegative affect and normal growth varies from case to case. Some meat\nis produced by hunting such animals. In practice, hunting involves\nmaking animals suffer from the pain of errant shots or the terror of\nbeing chased or wounded, but, ideally, it involves neither pain nor\nconfinement. Of course, either way, it involves\n death.[3] \nMoral vegetarian arguments about these practices follow a pattern.\nThey claim that certain actions—killing animals for food we do\nnot need, for example—are wrong and then add that some mode of\nmeat production—recreational hunting, for example—does so.\nIt follows that the mode of meat-production is wrong. \nSchematically \nX is wrong. \nY involves X. Hence, \nY is wrong. \nAmong the candidate values of X are: \nAnd among the candidate values of Y are: \nSpace is limited and cranking through many instances of the schema\nwould be tedious. This section focuses on causing animals pain,\nkilling them, and harming the environment in raising them. On control,\nsee Francione 2009, DeGrazia 2011, and Bok 2011. On treating animals\nas mere tools, see Kant’s Lectures on Ethics, Korsgaard\n2011 and 2015, and Zamir 2007. On ontologizing, see Diamond 1978,\nVialles 1987 [1994], and Gruen 2011, Chapter 3. On harming humans, see\nPachirat 2011, Anomaly 2015, and Doggett & Holmes 2018. \nSome moral vegetarians argue: \nCausing animals pain while raising them for food when there are\nreadily available alternatives is wrong. \nIndustrial animal farming involves causing animals pain while raising\nthem for food when there are readily available alternatives.\nHence, \nIndustrial animal farming is wrong. \nThe “while raising them for food when there are readily\navailable alternatives” is crucial. It is sometimes permissible\nto cause animals pain: You painfully give your cat a shot, inoculating\nher, or painfully tug your dog’s collar, stopping him from\nattacking a toddler. The first premise is asserting that causing pain\nis impermissible in certain other situations. The “when there\nare readily available alternatives” is getting at the point that\nthere are substitutes available. We could let the chickens be and eat\nrice and kale. The first premise asserts it is wrong to cause animals\npain while raising them for food when there are readily available\nsubstitutes. \nIt says nothing about why that is wrong. It could be that it is wrong\nbecause it would be wrong to make us suffer to raise us for\nfood and there are no differences between us and animals that would\njustify making them suffer (Singer 1975 and the enormous literature it\ngenerated). It could, instead, be that it is wrong because impious\n(Scruton 2004) or cruel (Hursthouse 2011). \nSo long as we accept that animals feel—for an up-to-date\nphilosophical defense of this, see Tye 2016—it is\nuncontroversial that industrial farms do make animals suffer. No one\nin the contemporary literature denies the second premise, and Norwood\nand Lusk go so far as to say that \nit is impossible to raise animals for food without some form of\ntemporary pain, and you must sometimes inflict this pain with your own\nhands. Animals need to be castrated, dehorned, branded, and have other\nminor surgeries. Such temporary pain is often required to produce\nlonger term benefits…All of this must be done knowing that\nanesthetics would have lessened the pain but are too expensive. (2011:\n113) \nThere is the physical suffering of tail-docking, de-beaking,\nde-horning, and castrating, all without anesthetic. Also, industrial\nfarms make animals suffer psychologically by crowding them and by\ndepriving them of interesting environments. Animals are bred to grow\nquickly on minimal food. Various poultry industry sources acknowledge\nthat this selective breeding has led to a significant percentage of\nmeat birds walking with painful impairments (see the extensive\ncitations in HSUS 2009). \nThis—and much more like it that is documented in Singer &\nMason 2006 and Stuart Rachels 2011—is the case for the second\npremise, namely, that industrial farming causes animals pain while\nraising them for food when there are readily available\nalternatives. \nThe argument can be adapted to apply to freerange farming and hunting.\nFreerange farms ideally do not hurt, but, as the Norwood and Lusk\nquotation implies, they actually do: For one thing, animals typically\ngo to the same slaughterhouses as industrially-produced animals do.\nBoth slaughter and transport can be painful and stressful. \nThe same goes for hunting: In the ideal, there is no pain, but,\nreally, hunters hit animals with non-lethal and painful shots. These\nanimals are often—but not always—killed for pleasure or\nfor food hunters do not\n need.[4] \nTaken together the arguments allege that all manners of meat\nproduction in fact produce suffering for low-cost food and typically\ndo so for food when we don’t need to do so and then allege that\nthat justification for producing suffering is insufficient. Against\nthe arguments, one might accept that farms hurt animals but deny that\nit is even pro tanto wrong to do so (Carruthers 1992 and\n2011; Hsiao 2015a and 2015b) on the grounds that animals lack moral\nstatus and, because of this, it is not intrinsically wrong to hurt\nthem (or kill or control them or treat them like mere tools). One\nchallenge for such views is to explain what, if anything, is wrong\nwith beating the life out of a pet. Like Kant, Carruthers and Hsiao\naccept that it might be wrong to hurt animals when and because doing\nso leads to hurting humans. This view is discussed in Regan 1983:\nChapter 5. It faces two distinct challenges. One is that if the only\nreason it is wrong to hurt animals is because of its effects on\nhumans, then the only reason it is wrong to hurt a pet is because of\nits effects on humans. So there is nothing wrong with beating pets\nwhen that will have no bad effects on humans. This is hard to believe.\nAnother challenge for such views, addressed at some length in\nCarruthers 1992 and 2011, is to explain whether and why humans with\nmental lives like the lives of, say, pigs have moral status and\nwhether and why it is wrong to make such humans suffer. \nConsider a different argument: \nKilling animals while raising them for food when there are readily\navailable alternatives is wrong. \nMost forms of animal farming and all recreational hunting involve\nkilling animals while raising them for food when there are readily\navailable alternatives. Hence, \nMost forms of animal farming and all recreational hunting are\nwrong. \nThe second premise is straightforward and uncontroversial. All forms\nof meat farming and hunting require killing animals. There is no form\nof farming that involves widespread harvesting of old bodies, dead\nfrom natural causes. Except in rare farming and hunting cases, the\nmeat produced in the industrialized world is meat for which there are\nready alternatives. \nThe first premise is more controversial. Amongst those who endorse it,\nthere is disagreement about why it is true. If it is true, it might be\ntrue because killing animals wrongfully violates their rights to life\n(Regan 1975). It might be true because killing animals deprives them\nof lives worth living (McPherson 2015). It might be true because it\ntreats animals as mere tools (Korsgaard 2011). \nThere is disagreement about whether the first premise is true. The\n“readily available alternatives” condition matters:\nEveryone agrees that it is sometimes all things considered permissible\nto kill animals, e.g., if doing so is the only way to save your\nchild’s life from a surprise attack by a grizzly bear or if\ndoing so is the only way to prevent your pet cat from a life of\nunremitting agony. (Whether it is permissible to kill animals in order\nto cull them or to preserve biodiversity is a tricky issue that is set\naside here. It—and its connection to the permissibility of\nhunting—is discussed in Scruton 2006b.) At any rate, animal\nfarms are in the business of killing animals simply on the grounds\nthat we want to eat them and are willing to pay for them even though\nwe could, instead, eat plants. \nThe main objection to the first premise is that animals lack the\nmental lives to make killing them wrong. In the moral vegetarian\nliterature, some argue that the wrongness of killing animals depends\non what sort of mental life they have and that while animals\nhave a mental life that suffices for hurting them being wrong, they\nlack a mental life that suffices for killing them being wrong (Belshaw\n2015 endorses this; McMahan 2008 and Harman 2011 accept the first and\nreject the second; Velleman 1991 endorses that animal mental lives are\nsuch that killing them does not harm them). Animals could lack a\nmental life that makes killing them wrong because it is a necessary\ncondition for killing a creature being wrong that that creature have\nlong-term goals and animals don’t or that it is a necessary\ncondition that that creature have the capacity to form such goals and\nanimals don’t or that it is a necessary condition that the\ncreature’s life have a narrative structure and animals’\nlives don’t\n or…[5] \nInstead, the first premise might be false and killing animals we raise\nfor food might be permissible because \n[t]he genesis of domestic animals is…a matter…of an\nimplicit social contract—what Stephen Budiansky…calls\n‘a covenant of the wild.’…Humans could protect such\nanimals as the wild ancestors of domestic cattle and swine from\npredation, shelter them from the elements, and feed them when\notherwise they might starve. The bargain from the animal’s point\nof view, would be a better life as the price of a shorter life…\n(Callicott 2015: 56–57) \nThe idea is that we have made a “bargain” with animals to\nraise them, to protect them from predators and the elements, and to\ntend to them, but then, in return, to kill them. Moreover, the\n“bargain” renders killing animals permissible (defended in\nHurst 2009, Other Internet Resources, and described in Midgley\n1983). Such an argument might render permissible hurting animals, too,\nor treating them merely as tools. \nRelatedly, even conceding that it is pro tanto wrong to kill animals,\nit might be all things considered permissible to kill farm animals for\nfood even when there are ready alternatives because and when their\nwell-being is replaced by the well-being of a new batch of farmed\nanimals (Tännsjö 2016). Farms kill one batch of chickens and\nthen bring in a batch of chicks to raise (and then kill) next. The\ntotal amount of well-being is fixed though the identities of the\nreceptacles of that well-being frequently changes. \nAnyone who endorses the views in the two paragraphs above needs to\nexplain whether and then why their reasoning applies to animals but\nnot humans. It would not be morally permissible to create humans on\norgan farms and harvest those organs, justifying this with the claim\nthat these humans wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the\nplan to take their organs and so part of the “deal” is\nthat those humans are killed for their organs. Neither would it be\nmorally permissible to organ-farm humans, justifying it with the claim\nthat they will be replaced by other happy\n humans.[6] \nFinally, consider: \nHarming the environment while producing food when there are readily\navailable alternatives is wrong. \nIndustrial animal farming involves harming the environment while\nproducing food when there are readily available alternatives.\nHence, \nIndustrial animal farming is wrong. \nA more plausible premise might be “egregiously harming the\nenvironment…” The harms, detailed in Budolfson 2018,\nHamerschlag 2011, Rossi & Garner 2014, and Ranganathan et al.\n2016, are egregious and include deforestation, greenhouse gas\nemission, soil degradation, water pollution, water and fossil fuel\ndepletion. \nThe argument commits to it being wrong to harm the environment.\nWhether this is because those harms are instrumental in harming\nsentient creatures or whether it is intrinsically wrong to harm the\nenvironment or ecosystems or species or living creatures regardless of\nsentience is left\n open.[7] \nThe argument does not commit to whether these harms to the environment\nare necessary consequences of industrial animal farming. There are\nimportant debates, discussed in PNAS 2013, about whether, and\nhow easily, these harms can be stripped off industrial animal\nproduction. \nThere is an additional important debate, discussed in Budolfson 2018,\nabout whether something like this argument applies to freerange animal\nfarming. \nFinally, there is a powerful objection to the first premise from the\nclaim that these harms are part of a package that leaves sentient\ncreatures better off than they would’ve been under any other\noption. \nNothing has been said so far about general moral theories and meat\nproduction. There is considerable controversy about what those\ntheories imply about meat production. So, for example, utilitarians\nagree that we are required to maximize happiness. They disagree about\nwhich agricultural practices do so. One possibility is that because it\nbrings into existence many trillions of animals that, in the main,\nhave lives worth living and otherwise would not exist, industrial\nfarming maximizes happiness (Tännsjö 2016). Another is that\nfreerange farming maximizes happiness (Hare 1999; Crisp 1988).\nInstead, it could be that no form of animal agriculture does (Singer\n1975 though Singer 1999 seems to agree with Hare). \nKantians agree it is wrong to treat ends in themselves merely as\nmeans. They disagree about which agricultural practices do so. Kant\n(Lectures on Ethics) himself claims that no farming practice\ndoes—animals are mere means and so treating them as mere means\nis fine. Some Kantians, by contrast, claim that animals are ends in\nthemselves and that typically animal farming treats them as mere means\nand, hence, is wrong (Korsgaard 2011 and 2015; Regan 1975 and\n1983). \nContractualists agree that it is wrong to do anything that a certain\ngroup of people would reasonably reject. (They disagree about who is\nin the group.) They disagree, too, about which agricultural practice\ncontractualism permits. Perhaps it permits any sort of animal farming\n(Carruthers 2011; Hsiao 2015a). Perhaps it permits none (Rowlands\n2009). Intermediate positions are possible. \nVirtue ethicists agree that it is wrong to do anything a virtuous\nperson would not do or would not advise. Perhaps this forbids hurting\nand killing animals, so any sort of animal farming is impermissible\nand so is hunting (Clark 1984; Hursthouse 2011). Instead, perhaps it\nmerely forbids hurting them, so freerange farming is permissible and\nso is expert, pain-free hunting (Scruton 2006b). \nDivine command ethicists agree that it is wrong to do anything\nforbidden by God. Perhaps industrial farming, at least, would be\n(Halteman 2010; Scully 2002). Lipscomb (2015) seems to endorse that\nfreerange farming would not be forbidden by God. A standard\nChristian view is that no form of farming would be forbidden, that\nbecause God gave humans dominion over animals, we may treat them in\nany old way. Islamic and Jewish arguments are stricter about what may\nbe eaten and about how animals may be treated though neither rules out\neven industrial animal farming (Regenstein, et al. 2003). \nRossian pluralists agree it is prima facie wrong to harm.\nThere is room for disagreement about which agricultural\npractices—controlling, hurting, killing—do harm and so\nroom for disagreement about which farming practices are prima\nfacie wrong. Curnutt (1997) argues that the prima facie\nwrongness of killing animals is not overridden by typical\njustifications for doing so. \nIn addition to pork and beef, there are salmon and crickets. In\naddition to lamb and chicken, there are mussels and shrimp. There is\nlittle in the philosophical literature about insects and sea creatures\nand their products, and this entry reflects\n that.[8]\n Yet the topics are important. The organization Fish Count estimates\nthat at least a trillion sea creatures are wild-caught or farmed each\nyear (Mood & Brooke 2010, 2012, in Other Internet Resources). \nGlobally, humans consume more\nthan 20 kg of fish per capita annually (FAO 2016). In the US, we\nconsume 1.5 lbs of honey per capita annually (Bee Culture 2016).\nEstimates of insect consumption are less sure. The UN FAO estimates\nthat insects are part of the traditional diets of two billion humans\nthough whether they are eaten—whether those diets are adhered\nto—and in what quantity is unclear (FAO 2013). \nSeafood is produced by farming and by fishing. Fishing techniques vary\nfrom a person using a line in a boat to large trawlers pulling nets\nacross the ocean floor. The arguments for and against seafood\nproduction are much like the arguments for and against meat\nproduction: Some worry about the effects on humans of these practices.\n(Some workers, for example, are enslaved on shrimpers.) Some worry\nabout the effects on the environment of these practices. (Some coral\nreefs, for example, are destroyed by trawlers.) Some worry about the\npermissibility of killing, hurting, or controlling sea creatures or\ntreating them merely as tools. This last worry should not be\nundersold: Again, Mood and Brooke (2010, 2012, in Other Internet\nResources) estimate that\nbetween 970 billion and 2.7 trillion fish are\nwild-caught yearly and between 37 and 120 billion farmed fish are\nkilled. If killing, hurting, or controlling these creatures or\ntreating them as mere tools is wrong, then the scale of our wrongdoing\nwith regard to sea creatures beggars belief. \nAre these actions wrong? Complicating the question is that there is\nsignificantly more doubt about which sea creatures have mental lives\nat all and what those mental lives are like. And while whether shrimp\nare sentient is clearly irrelevant to the permissibility of enslaving\nworkers who catch them, it does matter to the permissibility of\nkilling shrimp. This doubt is greater still with regard to insect\nmental lives. In conversation, people sometimes say that bee mental\nlife is such that nothing wrong is done to bees in raising them.\nNothing wrong is done to bees in killing them. Because they are not\nsentient, there is no hurting them. Because of these facts about bee\nmental life, the argument goes, “taking” their honey need\nbe no more morally problematic than “taking” apples from\nan apple tree. (There is little on the environmental impact of honey\nproduction or (human) workers and honey. So it is unclear how forceful\nenvironment- and human-based worries about honey are.) \nThis argument supporting honey production hinges on some empirical\nclaims about bee mental life. For an up-to-date assessment of bee\nmental life, see Tye 2016, which argues that bees “have a rich\nperceptual consciousness” and “can feel some\nemotions” and that “the most plausible hypothesis\noverall…is that bees feel pain” (2016: 158–159) and\nsee, too, Barron & Klein 2016, which argues that insects,\ngenerally, have a capacity for consciousness. The argument supporting\nhoney production might be objected to on those empirical grounds. It\nmight, instead, be objected to on the grounds that we are uncertain\nwhat the mental lives of bees are like. It could be that they are much\nricher than we realize. If so, killing them or taking excessive\nhoney—and thereby causing them significant harms—might\nwell be morally wrong. And, the objection continues, the costs of not\ndoing so, of just letting bees be, would be small. If so, caution\nrequires not taking any honey or killing bees or hurting them.\nArguments like this are sometimes put applied to larger creatures. For\ndiscussion of such arguments, see Guerrero 2007. \nNone of the foregoing is about consumption. The moral vegetarian\narguments thus far have, at most, established that it is wrong to\nproduce meat in various ways. Assuming that some such argument is\nsound, how to get from the wrongness of producing meat to the\nwrongness of consuming that meat? \nThis question is not always taken seriously. Classics of the moral\nvegetarian literature like Singer 1975, Regan 1975, Engel 2000, and\nDeGrazia 2009 do not give much space to it. (C. Adams 1990 is a rare\ncanonical vegetarian text that devotes considerable space to\nconsumption ethics.) James Rachels writes, \nSometimes philosophers explain that [my argument for vegetarianism] is\nunconvincing because it contains a logical gap. We are all opposed to\ncruelty, they say, but it does not follow that we must become\nvegetarians. It only follows that we should favor less cruel methods\nof meat production. This objection is so feeble it is hard to believe\nit explains resistance to the basic argument [for vegetarianism].\n(2004: 74) \nYet if the objection is that it does not follow from the\nwrongness of producing meat that consuming meat is wrong, then the\nobjection is not feeble and is clearly correct. In order to validly\nderive the vegetarian conclusion, additional premises are needed.\nRachels, it turns out, has some, so perhaps it is best to interpret\nhis complaint as that it is obvious what the premises\nare. \nMaybe so. But there is quite a bit of disagreement about what those\nadditional premises are and plausible candidates differ greatly from\none another. \nConsider a productivist idea about the connection between\nproduction and consumption according to which consumption of\nwrongfully-produced goods is wrong because it produces more wrongful\nproduction. The idea issues an argument that, in outline, is: \nConsuming some product P produces production of Q. \nProduction of Q is wrong. \nIt is wrong to produce wrongdoing. Hence, \nConsuming P is wrong. \nOr never mind actual production. A productivist might\nargue: \nConsuming some product P is reasonably expected to\nproduce production of Q. \nProduction of Q is wrong. \nIt is wrong to do something that is reasonably expected to produce\nwrongdoing. Hence, \nConsuming P is wrong. (Singer 1975; Norcross 2004; Kagan\n2011) \n(The main ideas about connecting consumption and production that\nfollow can—but won’t —be put in terms of\nexpectation, too.) \nThe moral vegetarian might then argue that meat is among the values of\nboth P and Q: consuming meat is reasonably expect to\nproduce production of meat. Or the moral vegetarian might argue that\nconsuming meat produces more normalization of bad attitudes towards\nanimals and that is wrong. There are various\npossibilities. \nJust consider the first, the one about meat consumption producing meat\nproduction. It is most plausible with regard to buying. It is\nbuying the wrongfully-produced good that produces more of it.\nEating meat produces more production, if it does, by\nproducing more buying. When Grandma buys the wrongfully produced\ndelicacy, the idea goes, she produces more wrongdoing. The company she\nbuys from produces more goods whether you eat the delicacy or throw it\nout. \nThese arguments hinge on an empirical claim about production and a\nmoral claim about the wrongfulness of producing wrongdoing. The moral\nclaim has far-reaching implications (DeGrazia 2009 and Warfield 2015).\nConsider this rent case: \nYou pay rent to a landlord. You know that he takes your rent and uses\nthe money to buy wrongfully-produced meat. \nIf buying wrongfully-produced meat is wrong because it produces more\nwrongfully-produced meat, is it wrong to pay rent in the rent case? Is\nit wrong to buy a vegetarian meal at a restaurant that then takes your\nmoney and uses it to buy wrongfully-produced steak? These are\nquestions for productivists’ moral claim. There are further,\nfamiliar questions about whether it is wrong to produce wrongdoing\nwhen one neither intends to nor foresees it and whether it is wrong to\nproduce wrongdoing when one does not intend it but does foresee it and\nthen about whether what is wrong is producing wrongdoing or,\nrather, simply producing a bad effect (see entries on the\n doctrine of double effect\n and\n doing vs. allowing harm). \nAn objection to productivist arguments denies the empirical claim and,\ninstead, accepting that because the food system is so enormous, fed by\nso many consumers, and so stuffed with money, our eating or buying\ntypically has no effect on production, neither directly nor\neven, through influencing others, indirectly (Budolfson 2015; Nefsky\n2018). The idea is that buying a burger at, say, McDonald’s\nproduces no new death nor any different treatment of live animals.\nMcDonald’s will produce the same amount of meat—and raise\nits animals in exactly the same way—regardless of whether one\nbuys a burger there. Moreover, the idea goes, one should reasonably\nexpect this. Whether or not this is a good account of how food\nconsumption typically works, it is an account of a possible system.\nConsider the Chef in Shackles case, a modification of a case in\nMcPherson 2015: \nAlma runs Chef in Shackles, a restaurant at which the chef is known to\nbe held against his will. It’s a vanity project, and Alma will\nrun the restaurant regardless of how many people come. In fact, Alma\njust burns the money that comes in. The enslaved chef is superb; the\nfood is delicious. \nThe productivist idea does not imply it is wrong to buy food from or\neat at Chef in Shackles. If that is wrong, a different idea needs to\nexplain its wrongness. \nSo consider instead an extractivist idea according to which\nconsumption of wrongful goods is wrong because it is a benefiting from\nwrongdoing (Barry & Wiens 2016). This idea can explain why it is\nwrong to eat at Chef in Shackles—when you enjoy a delicious meal\nthere, you benefit from the wrongful captivity of the chef. In\noutline, the extractivist argument is: \nConsuming some product P extracts benefit from the production\nof P. \nProduction of P is wrong. \nIt is wrong to extract benefit from wrongdoing. Hence, \nConsuming P is wrong. \nMoral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of\nP. Unlike the productivist argument, this one is more plausible\nwith regard to eating than buying. It’s the eating,\ntypically, that produces the benefit and not the buying. Unlike the\nproductivist argument, it does not seem to have any trouble explaining\nwhat is wrong in the Chef in Shackles case. Unlike the productivist\nargument, it doesn’t seem to imply that paying a landlord who\npays for wrongfully produced food is wrong—paying a landlord is\nnot benefiting from wrongdoing. \nLike the productivist argument, the extractivist argument hinges on an\nempirical claim about consumer benefits and a moral claim about the\nethics of so benefiting. \nThe notion of benefiting, however, is obscure. Imagine you go to Chef\nin Shackles, have a truly repulsive meal, and become violently ill\nafterwards. Have you benefit ted from wrongdoing? If not, the\nextractivist idea cannot explain what is wrong with going to the\nrestaurant. \nPut so plainly, the extractivist’s moral claim is hard to\nbelieve. Consider the terror-love case, a modification of a case Barry\n& Wiens 2016 credits to Garrett Cullity: \nA terrorist bomb grievously injures Bob and Cece. They attend a\nsupport group for victims, fall in love, and live happily ever after,\nleaving them significantly better off than they were before the\nattack. \nBob and Cece seem to benefit from wrongdoing but seem not to be doing\nanything wrong by being together. Whereas the productivist struggles\nto explain why it is wrong to patronize Chef in Shackles, the\nextractivist struggles to explain why it is permissible for Bob and\nCece to benefit from wrongdoing. \nA participatory idea has no trouble with the terror-love\ncase. According to it, consuming wrongfully-produced goods is wrong\nbecause it cooperates with or participates in or, in\nHursthouse’s phrase, is party to wrongdoing (2011). Bob and Cece\ndo not participate in terror, so the idea does not imply they do\nwrong. The idea issues an argument that, in outline, goes: \nConsuming some product P is participating in the production of\nP. \nProduction of P is wrong. \nIt is wrong to participate in the production of wrongful things.\nHence, \nConsuming P is wrong. (Kutz 2000; Lepora & Goodin 2013) \nMoral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of\nP. Unlike the productivist or extractivist ideas, the\nparticipatory idea seems to as easily cover buying and eating for each\nis plausibly a form of participating in wrongdoing. Unlike the\nproductivist idea, it has no trouble explaining why it is wrong to\npatronize Chef in Shackles and does not imply it is wrong to pay rent\nto a landlord who buys wrongfully-produced meat. Unlike the\nextractivist idea, whether or not you get food poisoning at Chef in\nShackles has no moral importance to it. Unlike the extractivist idea,\nthe participatory idea does not falsely imply that the Bob and Cece do\nwrong in benefiting from wrongdoing—after all, their failing in\nlove is not a way of participating in wrongdoing. \nYet it is not entirely clear what it is to participate in wrongdoing.\nConsider the Jains who commit themselves to lives without\nhimsa (violence). Food production causes himsa. So Jains try\nto avoid eating many plants, uprooted to be eaten, and even drinking\nuntreated water, filled with microorganisms, to minimize lives taken.\nYet Jaina monastics are supported by Jaina laypersons. The monastic\ncan’t boil his own water—that would be violent—but\nthe water needs boiling so he depends on a layperson to boil. He kills\nno animals but receives alms, including meat, from a layperson. Is the\nmonastic participating in violence? Is he participating because he is\ncomplicit in this violence (Kutz 2000; Lepora & Goodin 2013)? Is\nhe part of a group that together does wrong (Parfit 1984: Chapter 3)?\nWhen Darryl refuses to buy wrongfully-produced meat but does no\npolitical work with regard to ending its production is he party to the\nwrongful production? Does he participate in it or cooperate with its\nproduction? Is he a member of a group that does wrong? If so, what are\nthe principles of group selection? \nAs a matter of contingent fact, failing to politically protest meat\nexhibits no objectionable attitudes in contemporary US society. Yet it\nmight be that consuming certain foods insults or otherwise disrespects\ncreatures involved in that food’s production (R.M. Adams 2002;\nHill 1979). Hurka (2003) argues that virtue requires exhibiting the\nright attitude towards good or evil, and so if consuming\nexhibits an attitude towards production, it is plausible that eating\nwrongfully produced foods exhibits the wrong attitude towards them.\nThese are all attitudinal ideas about consumption. They might\nissue in an argument like this: \nConsuming some product P exhibits a certain attitude towards\nproduction of P. \nProduction of P is wrong. \nIt is wrong to exhibit that attitude towards wrongdoing. Hence, \nConsuming P is wrong. \nMoral vegetarians would then urge that meat is among the values of\nP. Like the participatory idea, the attitudinal idea explains\nthe wrongness of eating and buying various goods—both are ways\nof exhibiting attitudes. Like the participatory idea, it has no\ntrouble with Chef in Shackles, the rent case, the food poisoning case,\nor the terror-love case. It does hinge on an empirical claim about\nexhibition—consuming certain products exhibits a certain\nattitude—and then a moral claim about the impermissibility of\nthat exhibition. One might well wonder about both. One might well\nwonder why buying meat exhibits support for that enterprise but paying\nrent to someone who will buy that meat does not. One might well wonder\nwhether eating wrongfully-produced meat in secret exhibits support and\nwhether such an exhibition is wrong. Also, there are attitudes other\nthan attitudes towards production to consider. Failing to offer meat\nto a guest might exhibit a failure of reverence (Fan 2010). In\ncontemporary India, in light of the “meat murders”\ncommitted by Hindus against Muslims nominally for the latter\ngroup’s consumption of beef, refusing to eat meat might exhibit\nsupport for religious discrimination (Doniger 2017). \nThe productivist, extractivist, participatory, and attitudinal ideas\nare not mutually exclusive. Someone might make use of a number of\nthem. Driver, for example, writes, \n[E]ating [wrongfully produced] meat is supporting the\nindustry in a situation where there were plenty of other, better,\noptions open…What makes [the eater] complicit is that\nshe is a participant. What makes that participation morally\nproblematic…is that the eating of meat displays a\nwillingness to cooperate with the producers of a product that\nis produced via huge amounts of pain and suffering. (2015: 79; all\nitalics mine) \nThis seems to at least incorporate participatory and attitudinal\nideas. Lawford-Smith (2015) combines attitudinal and productivist\nideas. McPherson (2015) combines extractivist and participatory ideas.\nJames Rachels (2004) combines participatory and productivity ideas.\nAnd, of course, there are ideas not discussed here, e.g., that it is\nwrong to reward wrongdoers for wrongdoing and buying wrongfully\nproduced meat does so. The explanation of why it is wrong to consume\ncertain goods might be quite complex. \nDriver, Lawford-Smith, McPherson, and James Rachels argue that it is wrong to\nconsume wrongfully produced food and try to explain why this is. The\nproductivist, extractivist, participatory, and attitudinal ideas, too,\ntry to explain it. But it could be that there is nothing to\nexplain. \nIt could be that certain modes of production are wrong yet consuming\ntheir products is permissible. We might assume that if\nconsumption of certain goods is wrong, then that wrongness would have\nto be partly explained in terms of the wrongness of those goods’\nproduction and then argue that there are no sound routes from a\nrequirement not to produce a food to a requirement not to consume it\n(Frey 1983). This leaves open the possibility that consumers might be\nrequired to do something—for example, work for\npolitical changes that end the wrongful system—but permitted to\neat wrongfully-produced food. \nAs §4.1 discusses, Warfield raises a problem for productivist\naccounts that they seem to falsely imply that morally permissible\nactivities like paying rent to meat-eaters or buying salad at a\nrestaurant serving meat are morally wrong (2015). Add the assumption\nthat if consumption is wrong, it is wrong because some\nproductivist view is true, and it follows that consumption of wrongful\ngoods need not be wrongful. (Warfield does not assume this but instead\nsays that “the best discussion” of the connection between\nproduction and consumption is “broadly consequentialist”\n(ibid., 154).) \nInstead, we might assume that an extractivist or participatory or\nattitudinal view is correct if any is and then argue no such view is\ncorrect. We might, for example, argue that these anti-consumption\nviews threaten to forbid too much. If the wrongness of producing and\nwrongness of consuming are connected, what else is connected?\nIf buying meat is wrong because it exhibits the wrong attitude towards\nanimals, is it permissible to be friends with people who buy that\nmeat—or does this, too, evince the wrong attitudes towards\nanimals? If killing animals for food is wrong, is it permissible\nmerely to abstain from consuming them or must one do more work to stop\ntheir killing? The implications of various arguments against consuming\nanimals and animal products might be far-reaching. Some will see this\nas an acknowledgment that something is wrong with moral vegetarian\narguments. As Gruen and Jones (2015) note, the lifestyle some such\narguments point to might not be enactable by creatures like us. Yet\nthey see this not as grounds for rejection of the argument but,\nrather, as acknowledgment that the argument sets out an aspiration\nthat we can orient ourselves towards (cf. §4 of Curtin 1991 on\n“contextual vegetarianism”). \nA different sort of argument in favor of the all things considered\npermissibility of consuming meat comes from the idea that eating and\nbuying animals actually makes for a great cultural good (Lomasky\n2013). Even if we accept that the production of those animals is\nwrong, it could be that the great good of consuming justifies doing\nso. (Relatedly, it could be that the bad of refusing to\nconsume justifies consumption as in a case in which a host has labored\nover barbequed chicken for hours and your refusing to eat it would\ndevastate him.) Yet this seems to leave open the possibility that all\nsorts of awful practices might be permissible because they are\nessential parts of great cultural goods. It threatens to permit too\nmuch. \nMoral veganism accepts moral vegetarianism and adds to it that\nconsuming animal products is wrong. Mere moral vegetarians deny this\nand add to moral vegetarianism that it is permissible to consume\nanimal products. An additional issue that divides some moral vegans\nand moral vegetarians is whether animal product production is\nwrong. This raises a general question: If it is wrong to produce meat\non the grounds adduced in\n §2,\n what other foods are wrongfully produced? If it is wrong to hurt\nchickens for meat, isn’t it wrong to hurt them for eggs? If it\nis wrong to harm workers in the production of meat, isn’t it\nwrong to harm workers in the production of animal products? If it is\nwrong to produce huge quantities of methane for meat, isn’t it\nwrong to produce it for milk? These are challenges posed by moral\nveganism.  \nBut various vegan diets raise moral questions. If it is wrong to hurt\nchickens for meat, is it wrong to hurt mice and moles while harvesting\ncrops? If it is wrong to harm workers in the production of meat,\nisn’t it wrong to harm workers in the production of tomatoes? If\nit is wrong to use huge quantities of water for meat, isn’t it\nwrong to use huge quantities of water for almonds? \nAs it might be that meat farming wrong, it might be that animal\nproduct farming is wrong for similar reasons. These reasons stem from\nconcerns about plants, animals, humans, and the environment. This\nentry will focus on the first, second, and fourth and will consider\neggs and dairy. \nLike meat birds, egg layers on industrial farms are tightly confined,\ngiven on average a letter-sized page of space. Their beaks are seared\noff. They are given a cocktail of antibiotics. Males, useless as\nlayers, are killed right away: crushed, dehydrated, starved,\nsuffocated. As they age and their laying-rate slows, females are\nstarved so as to force them to shed feathers and induce more laying.\nThey are killed within a couple years (HSUS 2009; cf. Norwood &\nLusk 2011: 113–127, which rates layer hen lives as not worth\nliving). \nFreerange egg farming ideally avoids much of this. Yet it still\ninvolves killing off young but spent hens and also baby roosters. It\noften involves painful, stressful trips to industrial slaughterhouses.\nSo, as it is plausible that industrially and freerange farming\nchickens for meat makes them suffer, so too is it plausible that\nindustrially and freerange farming them for eggs does. The same goes\nfor killing. \nThe threat to the environment, too, arises from industrial farming\nitself rather than whether it produces meat or eggs. Chickens produce\ngreenhouse gas and waste regardless of whether they are farmed for\nmeat or eggs. Land is deforested to grow food for them and resources\nare depleted to care for them regardless of whether they are farmed\nfor meat or eggs. \nIn sum, arguments much like arguments against chicken production seem\nto apply as forcefully to egg production. Arguments from premises\nabout killing, hurting, and harming the environment seem to apply to\ntypical egg production as they do to typical chicken production. \nLike beef cattle, dairy cows on industrial farms are tightly confined\nand bereft of much stimulation. As dairy cows, however, they are\nroutinely impregnated and then constantly milked. Males, useless as\nmilkers, are typically turned to veal within a matter of months.\nFemales live for maybe five years. (HSUS 2009; cf. Norwood & Lusk\n2011: 145–150). \nFreerange milk production does not avoid very much of this. Ideally,\nit involves less pain and suffering but it typically involves forced\nimpregnation, separation of mother and calf, and an early death,\ntypically in an industrial slaughterhouse. So far as arguments against\nraising cows for meat on the basis that doing so kills them and makes\nthem suffer are plausible, so are analogous arguments against raising\ncows for dairy. \nThe threat to the environment is also similar regardless of whether\ncattle are raised for meat or milk. So far as arguments against\nraising cows for meat on the basis that doing so harms the environment\nare plausible, so are analogous arguments against raising cows for\nmilk. Raising cows for meat and for milk produces greenhouse gas and\nwaste; it deforests and depletes resources. In fact, to take just one\nexample, the greenhouse-gas-based case against dairy is stronger than\nthe greenhouse-gas-based case against poultry and pork (Hamerschlag\n2013). \nIn sum, arguments much like arguments against beef production seem to\napply as forcefully to dairy production. Arguments from premises about\nkilling, hurting, and harming the environment seem to apply to typical\ndairy production as they do to typical beef production. \nAs it might be that animal, dairy, and egg farming are wrong, it might\nbe that plant farming is wrong for similar reasons. These reasons stem\nfrom concerns about plants, animals, humans, and the environment. This\nentry will focus on the first, second, and fourth. \nEd drenches Fatima’s prized cactus in pesticides without\npermission. This is uncontroversially wrongful but only\nuncontroversial because the cactus is Fatima’s. If a cactus\ngrows in Ed’s yard and, purely for fun, she drenches it in\npesticides, killing it, is that wrong? There is a family of unorthodox\nbut increasingly common ideas about the treatment of plants according\nto which any killing of plants is at least pro tanto wrongful\nand that treating them as mere tools is too (Marder 2013; Stone 1972,\nGoodpaster 1978, and Varner 1998 are earlier discussions and Tinker\n2015 discusses much earlier discussions). One natural way to\ndevelop this thought is that it is wrong to treat plants this way\nsimply because of the effects on plants themselves. An alternative is\nwrong to treat the plants this way simply because of its effects on\nthe biosphere. In both cases, we can do intrinsic wrong to\nnon-sentient creatures. \nThe objection raises an important issue about interests. Singer,\nfollowing Porphyry and Bentham, assumes that all and only sentient\ncreatures have interests. The challenge that Marder, et al. raise is\nthat plants at least seem to do better or worse, to flourish or\nfounder, because they seem to have interests in a certain amount of\nlight, nutrients, and water. One way to interpret the position of\nPorphyry, et al. is that things are not as they seem here and, in\nfact, plants, lacking sentience, have no interests. This invites the\nquestion of why sentience is necessary for interests (Frey 1980 and\n1983). Another way to interpret the position of Porphyry, et al. is\nthat plants do have interests but they have no moral import. This\ninvites the questions of when and why is it permissible to deprive\nplants of what they have interests in. Marder’s view is that\nplants have interests and that these interests carry significantly\nmore moral weight than one might think. So, for example, as killing a\ndog for fun is wrong, so, too, is killing a dandelion. If killing a\nchicken for food we don’t need is wrong, so, too, is killing\nsome carrots. \nIf it is impermissible to kill plants to provide ourselves food we\ndon’t need, how far does the restriction on killing extend: To\nbacteria? Pressed about this by Gary Francione, Marder is open-minded:\n“We should not reject the possibility of respecting communities\nof bacteria without analyzing the issue seriously” (2016:\n179). \nMarder’s view rests on a controversial interpretation of plant\nscience and, in particular, on a controversial view that vegetal\nresponses to stimuli—for example that “roots…are\ncapable of altering their growth pattern in moving toward\nresource-rich soil or away from nearby roots of other members of the\nsame species” (2016: 176)—suffice to show that plants have\ninterests, are ends in themselves, and it is pro tanto wrong to kill\nthem and treat them as tools. \nUncontroversially, much actual plant production does have\nvarious bad consequences for animals. Actual plant production in the\nUS is largely large scale. Large-scale plant production\ninvolves—intentionally or otherwise—killing a great many\nsentient creatures. Animals are killed by tractors and pesticides.\nThey are killed or left to die by loss of habitat (Davis 2003; Archer\n2011). The scope of the killing is disputed in Lamey 2007 and Matheny\n2003 but all agree it is vast (cf. Saja 2013 on the moral imperative\nto kill large animals). \nThe “intentionally or otherwise” is important to some.\nWhile these harms are foreseen consequences of farming, they are\nunintended. To some, that animals are harmed but not intentionally\nharmed in producing corn in Iowa helps to make those harms permissible\n(see entry on\n doctrine of double effect).\n Pigs farmed in Iowa, by contrast, are intentionally killed. Chickens\nand cows, too. (Are any intentionally hurt? Not typically. Farming is\nnot sadistic.) \nThe scale is important, too. Davis (2003) and Archer (2011) argue that\nsome forms of meat production kill fewer animals than plant production\nand, because of that, are preferable to plant production. \nThe idea is that if animal farming is wrong because it kills animals\nsimply in the process of producing food we don’t need, then some\nforms of plant farming are wrong for the same reason. More weakly, if\nanimal farming is wrong because it kills very large numbers\nof animals in the process of producing food we don’t need, then\nsome forms of plant farming are wrong for the same reason. \nAn outstanding issue is whether these harms are necessary components\nof plant production or contingent. A further issue is how easy it\nwould be to strip these harms off of plant production while still\nproducing foods humans want to eat at prices they are willing to\npay. \nA final objection to the permissibility of plant production: There are\nclearly environmental costs of plant production. Indeed, the\nenvironmental costs of plant farming are large: topsoil loss; erosion;\ndeforestation; run-off; resource-depletion; greenhouse gas emissions.\nTo take just the last two examples, Budolfson (2016: 169) estimates that\nbroccoli produces more kilograms of CO2 per thousand\ncalories than pork and that almonds use two and a half times the water\nper thousand calories that chicken does. \nIf some forms of animal farming are wrong for those environmental\nreasons, then some forms of plant farming are wrong for those reasons\n(Budolfson 2018). \nAgain, an outstanding issue is whether these harms are necessary\ncomponents of plant production or contingent. A further issue is how\neasy it would be to strip these harms off of plant production while\nstill producing foods people want to eat at prices they are willing to\npay. \nMoral vegetarian arguments standardly oppose treating animals in\nvarious ways while raising them for food that we do not need to eat to\nsurvive. This standardly makes up part of the arguments that it is\nwrong to eat animals. \nThese arguments against meat production can be extended mutatis\nmutandis to animal product\n production.[9]\n They can be extended, too, to some forms of plant production. This\nsuggests: \nThe arguments against industrial plant production and animal product\nproduction are as strong as the arguments against meat production. \nThe arguments against meat production show that meat production is\nwrong. Hence, \nThe arguments against industrial plant production and animal product\nproduction show that those practices are wrong. \nOne possibility is that the first premise is false and that some of\nthe arguments are stronger than others. \nAnother possibility is that the first premise is true and all these\narguments are equally strong. We would then have to choose between\naccepting the second premise—and thereby accepting the\nconclusion—or denying that meat production is wrong. \nAnother possibility is that the argument is sound but of limited\nscope, there being few if any alternatives in the industrialized West\nto industrialized plant, animal product, and meat production. \nA final possibility is that the parity of these arguments and evident\nunsoundness of an argument against industrial plant production show\nthat the ideas behind those arguments are being misexpressed. Properly\nunderstood, they issue not in a directive about the wrongness of this\npractice or that. Rather, properly understood, they just show that\nvarious practices are bad in various ways. If so, we can then ask:\nWhich are worse? And in which ways? The literature typically ranks\nfactory farming as worse for animals than industrial plant farming if\nonly because the former requires the latter and produces various\nharms—the suffering of billions of chickens—that the\nlatter does not. Or consider the debate in the literature about the\nrelative harmfulness to animals of freerange farming and industrial\nplant farming. Which produces more animal death or more animal\nsuffering? Ought we minimize that suffering? Or consider the relative\nharmfulness of freerange and industrial animal farming. Some argue\nthat the former is worse for the environment but better for animals.\nIf so, there is a not-easy question about which, if either, to go in\nfor. \nGiven length requirements, this entry cannot convey the vastness of\nthe moral vegetarian literature. There is some excellent work in the\npopular press. Between the Species, Journal of\nAgricultural and Environmental Ethics, Journal of Animal\nEthics, Environmental Ethics, and Journal of Food\nEthics publish articles yearly. Dozens of good articles have been\nomitted from discussion. \nThis entry has omitted quite direct arguments against consuming meat,\narguments that do not derive from premises about the wrongness of\nproducing this or that. Judeo-Islamic prohibitions on pork,\nfor example, derive from the uncleanliness of the product rather than\nthe manner of its production. Rastafari prohibitions on eating meat,\nfor another example, derive in part from the view that meat\nconsumption is unnatural. Historically, such prohibitions and\njustifications for them have not been limited to prohibitions on\nconsuming meat. The Laws of Manu’s prohibition on\nonion-eating derives from what consuming onion will do to the consumer\nrather than the manner of onion-production (Doniger & Smith\n(trans.) 1991: 102). The Koran’s prohibition on alcohol-drinking\nderives from what consuming alcohol will do to the consumer rather\nthan the manner of alcohol-production (5:90–91). \nArguments like this, arguments against consumption that start from\npremises about intrinsic features of the consumed or about the\nconsumed’s effects on consumers, largely do not appear in the\ncontemporary philosophical literature. What we have now are arguments\naccording to which certain products are wrongfully produced and\nconsumption of such products bears a certain relation to that\nwrongdoing and, ipso facto, is wrong. Moral vegetarians then\nargue that meat is such a product: It is typically wrongfully produced\nand consuming it typically bears a certain relation to that\nwrongdoing. This then leaves the moral vegetarian open to two sorts of\nobjections: objections to the claims about\nproduction—is meat produced that way? Is such\nproduction wrongful?—and objections to the claims connecting\nconsumption to production—is consuming meat related to\nwrongful production in the relevant way? Is being so related wrong?\nExplaining moral vegetarian answers to these questions was the work of\n §2\n and\n §4. \nThere are further questions. If moral vegetarian arguments against\nmeat-consumption are sound, then are arguments against animal\nproduct consumption also sound? Might dairy, eggs, and honey\nbe wrongfully produced as moral vegetarians argue meat is? Might\nconsuming them wrongfully relate the consumer to that production?\nExplaining the case for “yes” was some of the work of\n §5. \nRelatedly, some plants, fruit, nuts, and other putatively vegetarian\nfoods might be wrongfully produced. Some tomatoes are picked by\nworkers working in conditions just short of slavery (Bowe 2007);\nindustrial production of apples sucks up much water (Budolfson 2016);\nindustrial production of corn crushes numerous small animals to death\n(Davis 2003). Are these food wrongfully produced? Might consuming them\nwrongfully relate the consumer to that production? Explaining the case\nfor “yes” here, too, was some of the work of\n §5. \nFischer (2018) suggests that the answers to some of the questions\nnoted in the previous two paragraphs support a requirement to\n“eat unusually” and, one might add, to produce unusually.\nIf meat, for example, is usually wrongfully produced, it must\nbe produced unusually for that production to stand a chance of being\npermissible, perhaps as faultless roadkill (Koelle 2012; Bruckner\n2015) or as the corpse of an animal dead from natural causes (Foer\n2009) or as a test-tube creation (Milburn 2016; Pluhar 2010; see the\nessays in Donaldson & Carter (eds.) 2016 for discussion of\nplant-based “meat”). \nIf consuming meat is usually wrong because it usually bears a certain\nrelation to production, it must be consumed unusually to stand a\nchance of being permissible. Some people eat only food they scavenge\nfrom dumpsters, food that would otherwise go to waste. Some people eat\nonly food that is given to them without asking for any food in\nparticular. If consuming is wrong only because it produces\nmore production, neither of these modes of consumption would be\nwrongful. \nAs some unusual consumption might, by lights of the arguments\nconsidered in this entry, turn out to be morally unobjectionable, some\nperfectly usual practices having nothing to do with consumption might\nturn out, by those same lights, to be morally objectionable. Have you\ndone all you are required to do by moral vegetarian lights if you stop\neating, for example, factory-farmed animals? Clearly not. If it is\nwrong to eat a factory-farmed cow, it is for very similar\nreasons wrong to wear the skin of that cow. Does the wrongful\nroad stop at consumption, broadly construed to include buying, eating,\nor otherwise using? Or need consumers do more than not consume\nwrongfully-produced goods? Need they be pickier in how they spend\ntheir money than simply not buying meat, e.g., not going to\nrestaurants that serve any meat? Need they protest or lobby? Need they\ntake more direct action against farms? Or more direct action against\nthe government? Need they refuse to pay rent to landlords who buy\nwrongfully-produced meat? Is it permissible for moral vegetarians to\nbefriend—or to stay friends with—meat-eaters? As there are\nquestions about whether the moral road gets from production to\nconsumption, there are questions about whether the road stops at\nconsumption or gets much farther. \nAs discussed in\n §5,\n the moral vegetarian case against killing, hurting, or raising\nanimals for food might well be extended to killing, hurting, or\nraising animals in other circumstances. What, if anything, do those\ncases show about the ethical treatment of pets (Bok 2011; Overall\n(ed.) 2017; Palmer 2010 and 2011)? Of zoo creatures (DeGrazia 2011;\nGruen 2011: Chapter 5; Gruen 2014)?  \nWhat, if anything, do they show about duties regarding wild animals?\nPalmer 2010 opens with two cases from 2007, one of which involved the\naccidental deaths of 10,000 wildebeest in Kenya, the other involving\nthe mistreatment and death of 150 horses in England. As Palmer notes,\nit is plausible that we are required to care for and help domesticated\nanimals—that’s why it is plausibly wrong to let horses\nunder our care suffer—but permissible to let similar harms\nbefall wild animals—that’s why it is plausibly permissible\nto let wildebeest suffer and die. And yet, Palmer continues, it is\nalso plausible that animals with similar capacities—animals like\nhorses and wildebeest—should be treated similarly. So is the\ntoleration of 10,000 wildebeest deaths permissible? Or do we make a\nmoral mistake in not intervening in such cases? Relatedly, moral\nvegetarians oppose chicken killing and consumption and yet some of\nthem aid and abet domestic cats in the killings of billions of birds\neach year in the United States alone (Loss, et al. 2013; Pressler\n2013). Is this permissible? If so, why (Cohen 2004; Milburn 2015;\nSittler-Adamczewski 2016)? McMahan (2015) argues that standard moral\nvegetarian arguments against killing and suffering lead (eventually)\nto the conclusion that we ought to reduce predation in the wild. \nWhat, if anything do moral vegetarian arguments show about duties\nregarding fetuses? There are forceful arguments that if abortion is\nwrong, then so is killing animals for food we don’t need (Scully\n2013). The converse is more widely discussed but less plausible\n(Abbate 2014; Colb & Dorf 2016; Nobis 2016). \nFinally, in the food ethics literature, questions of food justice are\namong the most common questions about food consumption. Sexism,\nracism, and classism, are unjust. Among the issues of food justice,\nthen, are how, if at all, the practices of vegetarianism and\nomnivorism or encouragement of them are sexist (C. Adams 1990) or\nracist (Alkon & Agyeman (eds.) 2011) or classist (Guthman 2011).\nIndustrial animal agriculture raises a pair of questions of justice:\nIt degrades the environment—is this unjust to future generations\nwho will inherit this degraded environment? Also, what makes it so\nenvironmentally harmful is the scale of it. That scale is driven, in\npart, by demand for meat among the increasingly affluent in developing\ncountries (Herrero & Thornton 2013). Is refusing to meet that\ndemand—after catering to wealthy Western palates for a long\nstretch—a form of classism or racism? \nThe animals we eat dominate the moral vegetarian literature and have\ndominated it ever since there has been a moral vegetarian literature.\nA way to think about these last few paragraphs is that questions about\nwhat we eat lead naturally to questions about other, quite different\ntopics: the animals we eat but also the animals we don’t; eating\nthose animals but also eating plants; refusing to eat those animals\nbut also raising pets and refusing to intervene with predators and\nprey in the wild; refusing to eat but also failing to protest or\nrectify various injustices. Whereas the questions about\nanimals—and the most popular arguments about them—are very\nold, these other questions are newer, and there is much progress to be\nmade in answering them.","contact.mail":"tyler.doggett@uvm.edu","contact.domain":"uvm.edu"}]
