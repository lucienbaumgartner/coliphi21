This passage suggests, first, that God is\nreally present at or located at various particular\nplaces. Second, it suggests that there is no place where God is not\npresent, that is, that God is present everywhere. This is the\nclaim that God is omnipresent. Divine omnipresence is thus\none of the traditional divine attributes, although it has attracted\nless philosophical attention than such attributes as\n omnipotence,\n omniscience, or\n being eternal.\n \n\nPhilosophers who have attempted to give an account of omnipresence\nhave identified several interesting philosophical questions that an\nadequate account of omnipresence must address: How can a being who is\nsupposed to be immaterial be present at or located in space?\nIf God is located in a particular place, can anything else be located\nthere, too? If God is present everywhere, does it follow that he has\nparts in each of the particular places in which he is located? Various\nphilosophers have proposed accounts of omnipresence in terms that are\nsupposed to apply to an immaterial being. This essay will examine some\nof these proposals.\n\nAccording to classical theism, God is omnipresent, that is, present\neverywhere. But classical theism also holds that God is immaterial.\nHow can something that is not, or does not have, a body be located in\nspace? Early discussions of divine presence typically began by\ndistinguishing God’s presence in space from that of material\nbodies.\n Augustine\n (354–430) writes,  \nElsewhere Augustine continues this theme and introduces a new element,\nnamely, the suggestion that divine presence might be understood by\nanalogy with the presence of the soul:  \nAugustine adds two further points: First, God “knows how to be\nwholly everywhere without being confined to any place”\n(Letter 137). In contrast to material objects, which, having\nparts in various parts of the space they occupy, are not wholly\npresent at any of those regions, God is wholly present\nwherever he is. Second, God is not contained in or confined\nby any of the places at which he exists. Augustine is thus explicit\nthat God is not present in the way corporeal substances are present,\nbut his positive proposal for divine presence is less well developed.\nHe notes that God’s light, strength, and wisdom reach everywhere\n(Letter 187, Ch. 7), and he holds that “God so\npermeates all things as to be not a quality of the world, but the very\ncreative substance of the world ruling the world without labor,\nsustaining it without effort.” Rather than going on to explain\nthese ideas, however, this passage simply ends with what became a\nfamiliar formula:  \n\n Anselm\n (1033–1109) also distinguishes God’s presence from the\nway in which material objects are contained in space, and he, too,\nappeals to the concept of being wholly present. In his\nMonologion Anselm discusses omnipresence in a series of\nchapters with paradoxical titles. In chapter 20 he states that\n“the Supreme Being exists in every place and at all\ntimes.” But in the following chapter, he argues that God\n“exists in no place and at no time.” Finally, he attempts\nto reconcile these “two conclusions—so contradictory\naccording to their utterance, so necessary according to their\nproof”, by distinguishing two senses of “being wholly in a\nplace.” In one sense those things are wholly in a place\n“whose magnitude place contains by circumscribing it, and\ncircumscribes by containing it.” In this sense, an ordinary\nmaterial object is contained in a place. God, however, is not thus\ncontained in space, for it is “a mark of shameless impudence to\nsay that place circumscribes the magnitude of Supreme Truth.”\nInstead, God is in every place in the sense that he is present at\nevery place. According to Anselm, “the Supreme Being must be\npresent as a whole in every different place at once.” Like\nAugustine, then, Anselm denies that God is contained in space. Also,\nlike Augustine, he seems to leave unexplained this second relation of\nbeing “present as a whole” in every place.  \nIn his (1988) Edward Wierenga attempts to supply the missing details.\nHe notes that Anselm holds that souls could be wholly present in more\nthan one place, provided that they sensed in more than one place, and\nthat Anselm (in his Proslogion) adds that perception for God\nis a matter of having direct or immediate knowledge. Combining these\ntwo ideas, Anselm could say that God is present everywhere in virtue\nof having immediate knowledge of what is happening everywhere. Brian\nLeftow (1989) objects to the details of this interpretation and\nproposes instead that, for Anselm, God is everywhere in virtue of his\npower. We will explore the combination of knowledge and power below.\nIt should be noted, however, as Christopher Conn (2011) emphasizes,\nthat Anselm himself discusses time in conjunction with space; perhaps\nan adequate interpretation of Anselm would exploit this idea and\ndevelop an account, as Conn suggests, according to which God\n“contains” all of space-time.  \nThe two ideas of knowledge and power figure prominently in the account\nof omnipresence given by\n Thomas Aquinas\n (1225–1274), which we will take up in the next section. Section\n3 will consider two 20th century proposals very much in the spirit of\nAquinas’s. Some treatments of the problem of omnipresence seem\nto have the consequence that God is related to the world as though it\nis his body. That will be the subject of Section 4. In the final\nsection we will consider several recent proposals that depart from the\ntraditional formula.  \nAccording to Thomas Aquinas, God’s presence is to be understood\nin terms of God’s power, knowledge and essence. (In this view he\nfollowed a formula put forth by Peter Lombard (late 11th C.–1160) in\nhis Sentences, I, xxxvii, 1.) He writes, “God is in all\nthings by his power, inasmuch as all things are subject to his power;\nhe is by his presence in all things, inasmuch as all things are bare\nand open to his eyes; he is in all things by his essence, inasmuch as\nhe is present to all as the cause of their being” (Summa\nTheologica I, 8, 3). Aquinas attempts to motivate this claim with\nsome illustrations: \nPerhaps there is a sense in which a king is present wherever his power\nextends. In any event, Aquinas seems to think so. He distinguishes two\nkinds of being in place: by “contact of dimensive quantity, as\nbodies are, [and] contact of power” (S.T. I, 8, 2, ad\n1). In Summa contra Gentiles he writes that “an\nincorporeal thing is related to its presence in something by its\npower, in the same way that a corporeal thing is related to its\npresence in something by dimensive quantity,” and he adds that\n“if there were any body possessed of infinite dimensive\nquantity, it would have to be everywhere. So if there were an\nincorporeal being possessed of infinite power, it must be\neverywhere” (SCG III, 68, 3). So the first aspect of\nGod’s presence in things is his having power over them. The\nsecond aspect is having every thing present to him, having\neverything “bare and open to his eyes” or being known to\nhim. The third feature, that God is present to things by his essence,\nis glossed as his being the cause of their being. \nThis way of understanding God’s presence by reference to his\npower and his knowledge treats the predicate ‘is present’\nas applied to God as analogical with its application to\nordinary physical things. (For a fuller explanation of analogical\npredication, see\n Medieval Theories of Analogy.)\n As applied to God, ‘is present’ is neither univocal (used\nwith the same meaning as in ordinary contexts) nor equivocal (used\nwith an unrelated meaning). Rather, its meaning can be explained by\nreference to its ordinary sense: God is present at a place just in\ncase there is a physical object that is at that place and God has\npower over that object, knows what is going on in that object, and God\nis the cause of that object’s existence. Nicholas Everitt (2010,\np. 86) objects to this analogical approach, stating that “if\nthis is how omnipresence is interpreted, one might well think that it\nwould be clearer to say straightforwardly that God is not omnipresent\nat all,” and he cites Joshua Hoffman and Gary Rosenkrantz (2002,\np. 41)) as agreeing with him. But Hoffman and Rosenkrantz in the cited\npassage merely say that “there is no literal sense in\nwhich [God] could be omnipresent,” which leaves it open that\nthere is an analogical sense in which God is omnipresent. Hud Hudson\n(2009) also denies that God’s presence is analogical, but that\nis because he thinks that there is a literal way in which God is\npresent everywhere. We will consider Hudson’s proposal in\nSection 5.  \nThis account of omnipresence has the consequence that, strictly\nspeaking, God is only present where some physical thing is located.\nPerhaps, however, this is exactly what the medievals had intended.\nAnselm says, for example, that “the supreme Nature is more\nappropriately said to be everywhere, in this sense, that it is in all\nexisting things, than in this sense, namely that it is merely in all\nplaces” (Monologion, 23). \nMore recent philosophers have agreed that God’s presence is to\nbe understood analogically.\n Charles Hartshorne\n (1897–2000), for example, claims that “the relation of\nGod to the world must necessarily be conceived, if at all, by analogy\nwith relations given in human experience” (1941). Rather than\ntaking the relations to be knowledge of and power over things,\nhowever, Hartshorne assumes that God’s relation to the world is\nanalogous to that of a human mind’s relation to its body. \nHartshorne develops this idea by making distinctions between kinds of\nknowledge and kinds of power. Some things that human beings know are\nknown immediately, by “vivid and direct intuition”, while\nother things are known only indirectly or through inference.\nHartshorne holds that the former kind of knowledge is infallible, and\nit is the kind of knowledge human beings have of their own thoughts\nand feelings. Since this kind of knowledge is the highest form of\nknowledge, it is the kind God has, and he has it with respect to the\nentire cosmos. \nSimilarly, some things human beings have power over they control\ndirectly; other things can be controlled only indirectly. Human beings\nhave direct control only over their own volitions and movements of\ntheir own bodies. Again, since this is the highest kind of power, it\nis the kind of power God has—and he has it over every part of\nthe universe. \nThus far Hartshorne may be seen as developing the medieval view of\ndivine presence. God is present everywhere by having\nimmediate knowledge and direct power throughout the\nuniverse (with the addition that his presence extends to unoccupied\nregions of space). But Hartshorne endorses a surprising addition. He\nadds that whatever part of the world a mind knows immediately and\ncontrols directly is, by definition, its body. The world, therefore,\nis God’s body. \nRichard Swinburne (1977) also begins his discussion of omnipresence by\nasking what it is for a person to have a body. Although he insists\nthat God is an immaterial spirit, he supposes this claim to be\ncompatible with a certain “limited embodiment.”\nSubsequently (2016) he withdraws this suggestion, saying that since\n“God is not supposed to be tied down to acting or learning\nthrough … [the universe] or any chunk of matter … it\nseems less misleading to say that he is not embodied.” Swinburne\ndevelops his account by appeal to the notions of a “basic\naction” (an action one performs, for example, moving ones limbs\nin the typical case, without having to perform another action in order\nto do it) and of “direct knowledge” (knowledge that is\nneither inferential nor dependent on causal interaction). He then\npresents the claim that God is omniscient as the claim that God\n“can cause effects at every place directly (as an instrumentally\nbasic action) and knows what is happening at every place without the\ninformation coming to him through some causal chain—for example,\nwithout needing light rays from a distant place to stimulate his\neyes” (2016, p. 113). Swinburne’s account is thus, as he\nnotes, in the spirit of that of Aquinas. \nAs we have seen, Hartshorne explicitly endorses as a consequence of\nthe doctrine of divine omnipresence that the world is God’s\nbody, and Swinburne is initially willing to accept a “limited\nembodiment.” But some philosophers have been loath to accept\ndivine embodiment as a consequence of omnipresence. Charles\nTaliaferro, for example, while endorsing this overall account of\nomnipresence, notes that the basic actions human beings perform\n“can involve highly complex physical factors…[including]\nmany neural events and muscle movements, whereas with God there is no\nsuch physical complexity” (Taliaferro, 1994). Taliaferro then\nadds that this immediacy in the case of God’s action is\nprecisely a reason to say that “the world does not function as\nGod’s body the way material bodies function as our own.”\nEdward Wierenga adds a second objection. He holds that as Hartshorne\nand Swinburne develop accounts of God’s power and knowledge, God\nwould have the same knowledge of and control over what happens in\nempty regions of space as he does with respect to those regions\noccupied by material objects (Wierenga, 2010). In other words,\nHartshorne’s and Swinburne’s accounts of omnipresence,\nunlike that of Aquinas, do not interpret God’s presence as\npresence in things. But it would be implausible to count a\nthing as part of God’s body on the basis of his knowledge of and\npower over the region of space that thing occupies, when God’s\nknowledge and power would extend in the same way to that region if it\nwere unoccupied. So it seems as though one could accept a version of\nthe traditional account of divine omnipresence without having to\nconclude that the world is God’s body. \nAlthough conceiving of omnipresence in terms of power, knowledge, and\nessence is the traditional approach, with continued adherents, in\nrecent years several philosophers have proposed quite different\naccounts of omnipresence.  \nRobert Oakes (2006) suggests that space is “constituted\nby” God’s omnipresence. He holds that things located in\nspace and the world itself are therefore distinct from God. Oakes then\ndraws on these claims to argue that divine omnipresence is\nincompatible with\n pantheism.\n  \nSome recent work appeals to esoteric concepts from metaphysics. Luco\nJohan van den Brom (1984; see also 1993) suggests that “God has\na spatial dimension of his own which he does not share with\nthe created cosmos.” Brom’s idea is that just as a\ntwo-dimensional surface “transcends” a line on that\nsurface but is present at every point on the line, and similarly for a\nthree-dimensional space and a two-dimensional plane in that space,\n“God, by existing in a higher dimensional system, is also\npresent in the places of all the objects in the three-dimensional\nspace of created cosmos without being contained by that\nthree-dimensional space” (1984, 654). Brom even conjectures that\nGod possesses at least two extra dimensions, making it impossible for\nour space to bisect his.  \nOther recent work draws on contemporary discussions on the metaphysics\nof material objects and their relation to spacetime. Hud Hudson (2009)\ndescribes several possible “occupation” relations. One of\nthese relations is “entension”, where an object\nentends a region r just in case it is wholly and\nentirely located at r and at every proper subregion of\nr. An object is entirely located at a region r just\nin case it is located at r and there is no region disjoint\nfrom r at which it is located. And an object is wholly\nlocated at r just in case it is located at r and no\nproper part of it is not located at r. The typical way in\nwhich an object is located at a region of space is by having various\nof its parts at different subregions of that region; that is,\ntypically material objects are “spread out” or distributed\nthrough a region they occupy (they “pertend”, to use a\ntechnical term). In contrast, if an object entends a region, then it\nis located as a whole throughout that region. Hudson then\nproposes a “literal occupation account of omnipresence as\nubiquitous entension” (2009, 209). Omnipresence is location at\n“the maximally inclusive region” plus being wholly located\nat every subregion there is. Alexander R. Pruss (2013) also endorses a\nversion of this account, with slightly different details to allow\nexplicitly for divine timelessness. In Hudson’s view, any object\nthat occupies a region is space is a material object. He is thus\nwilling to accept as a consequence of his account of omnipresence as\nubiquitous entension that God is a material object. Ross Inman (2017),\nwhile sympathetic to the appeal to ubiquitous entension, is unwilling\nto accept the conclusion that God is a material object. Accordingly he\nshows that careful attention to medieval discussions of the\ndistinction between material and immaterial objects yields at least\nthree ways of marking that distinction according to which God is not\nmaterial.  \nEleonore Stump (2010, see also 2008, 2011, 2013) defends adding\nadditional conditions to the traditional understanding of omnipresence\nin terms of knowledge and power. She writes, “I … think,\nhowever, that the attempt to capture personal presence in terms of\ndirect and unmediated cognitive and casual contact misses something\neven in the minimal sense of personal presence” (2010, 111). She\ncontinues, “what has to be added to the condition of direct and\nunmediated casual and cognitive contact … are two\nthings––namely, second-person experience and shared\nattention” (2010, 112). Second-person experience involves\nbeing aware of and attending to someone else as a person when that\nother person is conscious and functioning as a person. Shared\nattention requires that two persons be aware of each other and aware\nof their awareness, whether of each other or a third object.\nStump’s goal is to provide an understanding of the kind of union\nto be desired in love. It may be, then, that her real topic is the\nnature of God’s offer of love to people. But she explicitly\napplies her remarks about personal presence to omnipresence when she\nwrites, “in order for God to be omnipresent, that is, in order\nfor God to be always and everywhere present, it also needs to\nbe the case that God is always and everywhere in a position to share\nattention with any creature able and willing to share attention with\nGod” (2010, 117). Perhaps, then, Stump can be seen not only as\nattempting to analyze omnipresence but to identify what is required\nfor it to be of religious or theological importance.  \nGeorg Gasser (2019) also defends adding an additional condition\ninvolving agency to the traditional appeal to knowledge and power. He\nconsiders a variety of proposed accounts of omnipresence, giving\nspecial attention (and initial sympathy) to Hudson’s development\nof ubiquitous entension. But he concludes that this proposal has a\nhard time explaining “the biblical tradition and personal\nreligious experiences [according to which] God acts differently at\ndifferent places” (2019, 59). Perhaps he takes Stump’s\nsecond-person attention and shared experience, which he\nreferences, to provide the requisite agency, or perhaps he intends\nsuch actions as, for example, God’s speaking to Moses in the\nburning bush and also preventing the consumption of the bush by fire.\nIn any event, Gasser assumes that omnipresence includes, not only\nGod’s presence through his knowledge and power everywhere, but\nalso “acting from time to time … ‘specially’\nin miraculous ways” (2019, 60).
