These include the use of the notion\nof style in comparative cultural histories of mathematics, in\ncharacterizing national styles, and in describing mathematical\npractice. These developments are then related to the more familiar\ntreatment of style in history and philosophy of the natural sciences\nwhere one distinguishes ‘local’ and\n‘methodological’ styles. It is argued that the natural\nlocus of ‘style’ in mathematics falls between the\n‘local’ and the ‘methodological’ styles\ndescribed by historians and philosophers of science. Finally, the last\npart of the essay reviews some of the major accounts of style in\nmathematics, due to Hacking and Granger, and probes their\nepistemological and ontological implications.\n\nThe goal of this essay is to survey and analyze the literature on\nstyle in history and philosophy of mathematics. In particular, the\nproblem of how one can philosophically approach the notion of\n‘style’ in mathematics will be addressed towards the\nend. Although this is not one of the canonical topics in philosophy of\nmathematics, the presentation will avail itself of relevant\ndiscussions on style in the history and philosophy of science. \nSpeaking about mathematics in terms of style is a common enough\nphenomenon. One encounters such appeals to stylistic features in\nmathematics already early in the seventeenth century. Bonaventura\nCavalieri, for instance, as early as 1635 contrasts his indivisibilist\ntechniques with the Archimedean style: \nLater in the century it is easier to find examples. For instance\nLeibniz (1701, 270–71) writes: “Analysis does not differ\nfrom Archimedes’ style except for the expressions that are more\ndirect and more appropriate to the art of discovery” (French:\n“L’analyse ne diffère du style\nd’Archimède que dans les expressions, qui sont plus\ndirectes et plus conformes à l’art\nd’inventer”). It is an interesting fact that such\noccurrences predate the generalized use of the notion of style in\npainting, which only dates from the 1660s (sporadic occurrences, as\npointed out in Sauerländer 1983, are also found in the sixteenth\ncentury). Earlier in the seventeenth century the word of choice in\npainting was “manière” (see Panofsky 1924;\nEnglish translation (1968, 240)). Here are a couple of additional\nexamples from the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Chasles in\nhis Aperçu historique (1837) speaking about Monge\nsays: \nAnother example comes from Edward’s evaluation of\nDedekind’s approach to mathematics: \nObviously, one could pile up quotations of the same kind (see, among\nothers, Cohen 1992, de Gandt 1986, Dhombres 1993, Epple 1997,\nFleckenstein 1955, Granger 2003, Høyrup 2005, Laugwitz 1993,\nNovy 1981, Reck 2009, Tappenden 2005, Weiss 1939, Wisan 1981) but that\nwould not be very interesting. Even in mathematics style ranges from\n‘individual styles’ to ‘national styles’ to\n‘epistemic styles’, among others. What is needed is first\nof all an understanding of the major contexts in which appeal to\n‘style’ in mathematics occurs, although this essay will\nnot contain much discussion of ‘individual styles’\n(examples of such would include, to follow a suggestion by Enrico\nBombieri, the “very personal” styles of Euler,\nRamanujan, Riemann, Serre and A. Weil). \nIn many cases the appeal to the notion of style is conceived as\nborrowed from the fine arts and some cases will be discussed\nforthwith. Harwood 1993 claims that “the concept of style was\ndevised in order to classify cultural patterns observed in the study\nof fine arts”. Wessely 1991 talks about “transferring that\nconcept [of style] to the history of science” (265). While this\nmight perhaps be true for the twentieth century (see also Kwa 2012),\none should keep in mind, as was pointed out above, that this claim\nmust be qualified for the seventeenth century. \nNotwithstanding the previous caveats, it is a fact that some major\ntwentieth century appeals to the category of style in mathematics have\ndone so in reference to the arts. This is especially true of those\nauthors who were motivated by accounting in a unified way for the\ncultural production of mankind and who saw thus a uniformity in the\nprocesses of scientific and artistic production. It was in such\ncontext that Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West\n(1919, 1921) attempted a morphology of world history and claimed that\nthe history of mathematics was characterized by different stylistic\nepochs which depended on the culture that produced it: \nNot only are there parallels between mathematics and other artistic\nproductions of a culture. Relying on Goethe’s statement that the\ncomplete mathematician “feels within himself the beauty of the\ntrue” and on Weierstrass’s pronouncement that “who\nis not at the same time a bit of a poet will never be a true\nmathematician”, Spengler went on to characterize mathematics\nitself as an art: \nThe most extensive treatment that builds on the parallel between art\nand mathematics and exploits the notion of style as a central category\nfor an analysis of the history of mathematics is that of Max Bense. In\na book appropriately entitled Konturen einer Geistesgeschichte der\nMathematik (1946), Bense devoted a whole chapter (ch. 2) to\narticulating how the notion of style applies to mathematics. For Bense\nstyle is form: \nBense saw the history of art and the history of mathematics as aspects\nof the history of mind [Geistesgeschichte]. In fact\n“style is given wherever the human imagination and the capacity\nof expression arrive to creation”. Bense was certainly prone to\ndraw parallels between styles in the history of art and styles in\nmathematics (he especially treated the baroque and the romantic styles\nin his book) but he kept, in opposition to Spengler, the nature of art\nand mathematics separate. Indeed he recognized that a stylistic\nhistory of mathematics could not be reduced “to a coincidence\nbetween certain mathematical formal tendencies and the great\nartistic-worldviews-spiritual styles of single epochs such as the\nRenaissance, Classicism, the Baroque or Romanticism” (p.132; see\nFleckenstein 1955 and Wisan 1981 for more recent parallels between the\nbaroque in art and the mathematics of the seventeenth century). He\nreferred to Felix Klein’s “Elementarmathematik vom\nhöheren Standpunkte aus” to point out that certain\nlines of development characterized by Klein could be seen as pointing\nto styles in the history of the development of mathematics (see Klein\n1924, 91). \nAttempts such as Spengler’s and Bense’s appeal certainly\nto those theoreticians who would like to use the category of style as\na tool for describing, and perhaps accounting for, cultural patterns.\nHowever, they leave the reader who is knowledgeable in mathematics\nand/or history of art skeptical on account of the usually far-fetched\nparallels that are supposed to provide evidence for the account. Of\ncourse, this is not to reject ultimately the approach or the\nusefulness of the appropriateness of the category of style in\nmathematics but one would like its use to be more directly related to\naspects of mathematical practice. \nIn general, one can distinguish two types of theorizing that can be\nassociated with such attempts. The first is purely descriptive, or\ntaxonomic, and satisfies itself with showing certain common patterns\nbetween a certain area of thought, such as mathematics, and other\ncultural products of a certain society. The second approach\npresupposes the first but also enquires after the causes that account\nfor the presence of a certain style of thought or production and\nnormally tries to ascribe it to psychological or sociological factors.\nIn Spengler and Bense there are elements of both although the emphasis\nis more on the parallels than on the causes underlying or explaining\nthe parallels. \nAttempts to extend the use of the concept of style in art to other\ndomains of human endeavors abound in the early twentieth century. A\nwell-known case is Mannheim’s sociological attempt to\ncharacterize styles of thought within different social groups\n(Mannheim 1928). While Mannheim had not excluded scientific thought\nfrom the realm of sociological analysis of knowledge, he did not\nactively pursue such an analysis. By contrast, Ludwik Fleck practiced\na sociological analysis of science in which “styles of\nthought” played a central role. Fleck focused however on\nmedicine (Fleck 1935). \nHere it is important to point out that the notion of thought style has\nreceived, by and large, two different developments in contemporary\nresearch, which also affect mathematics. First, there is the notion\nencountered in Fleck. Depending on how generous one wants to be in\ndrawing connections, one could see this approach to styles of thought\nto be related to the later work by Kuhn, Foucault and Hacking (see\nbelow for a discussion of Hacking). There is however a different way\nof thinking about styles of thought, which usually goes under the name\nof cognitive styles. This is an area of interest to cognitive\npsychologists and mathematical educators (for an overview of the\npsychological research in this area see Riding 2000 and Stenberg and\nGrigorenko 2001). Here the focus is on the psychological make up of\nthe individual who displays preference for a certain cognitive style\neither in learning, understanding or thinking about mathematics (i.e.,\nprocessing and organizing mathematical information). The old\ndistinction between visual and analytic mathematicians emphasized by\nPoincaré (see Poincaré 1905) is still part of the\npicture although there are a great variety of models and\nclassifications. For an historical overview and a theoretical proposal\ncentered on mathematics see Borromeo Ferri 2005. \nIn the area of history and philosophy of mathematics there are no book\nlength accounts of mathematical styles that explain the emergence of a\ncertain style with sociological or psychological categories (although\nNetz 1999 has been of interest to theoreticians of style as an attempt\nat a cognitive history of an important segment of Greek mathematics).\nThis is in contrast to books in history of the natural sciences such\nas Harwood 1993, whose goal is to explain the emergence of the thought\nstyle of the German genetics community through sociological arguments.\nThe closest one comes to such an account is Bieberbach’s\nconception of style in mathematics as dependent on psychological and\nracial factors. He will be discussed in the next section on national\nstyles. \nSomething less ambitious than the previous attempts at a general\nhistory of human cultural productions or far-reaching parallels\nbetween art and mathematics consists in a use of the notion of style\nas an historiographical category in the history of mathematics without\nparticular reference to art or other human cultural activities. If one\ngoes back to the beginning of the twentieth century, one finds that\n“national styles” were often referred to for categorizing\ncertain features characterizing mathematical production that seemed to\nfall squarely within national lines. In the history of science such\ncases of “national styles” have often been studied. One\nshould recall here J. Harwood’s book Styles of Scientific\nThought (1993) and the contributions Nye 1986, Maienschein 1991,\nand Elwick 2007. A case of interest for mathematics is the opposition\nbetween French and German style in mathematics studied by Herbert\nMehrtens. \nMehrtens (1990a, 1990b, 1996) describes, in terms of styles, the\nconflict in mathematics between “formalists” and\n“logicists” on the one hand and\n“intuitionists” on the other hand as a battle between two\nconceptions of mathematics (see also Gray 2008 for a critical take on\nof Mehrtens’s approach while emphasizing the\n“modernist” transformation of mathematics). Hilbert and\nPoincaré are used as paradigms for the sources of the\nopposition that later led to the Hilbert-Brouwer foundational debate\nin the 1920s (on the history of the Brouwer-Hilbert debate see Mancosu\n1998). Mehrtens also points out that this opposition did not\nnecessarily run along national lines as, for instance, Klein could be\nseen as close to Poincaré. Indeed, a certain internationalism\nin mathematics was dominant at the end of the nineteenth century and\nthe early part of the twentieth century. However, WWI was to change\nthe situation and gave rise to strong nationalistic conflicts. A\ncentral player in ‘nationalizing’ the opposition was\nPierre Duhem who opposed the esprit de finesse of the French\nto the esprit de géométrie of the Germans: \nDuhem intended his model to apply to the natural sciences but also to\nmathematics. Kleinert 1978 showed that Duhem’s book was only\npart of a reaction by French scientists to the 1914 declaration\n“Aufruf an die Kulturwelt” signed by 93 prominent\nGerman intellectuals. This led to the so called “Krieg der\nGeister” in which the polarization between Germany and\nFrance reached the point not only of criticizing the specific ways of\nmaking use of science (say practicing science with military aims) but\nalso led to a characterization of scientific knowledge as essentially\ndetermined by national characteristics. In fact this strategy was\nbasically used by the French in criticizing “La Science\nAllemande” but it will, twenty years later, be used by the\nGermans with the replacement of “national” by\n“rassisch”. The best known case is that of\n“Deutsche Physik” but here the focus will be on\n“Deutsche Mathematik” (see also Segal 2003 and\nPeckhaus 2005). \nThe most extreme form of this ideological confrontation, which\nironically reversed the role of Germans and French in the comparison\nused by Duhem, is found in the writings of Ludwig Bieberbach, the\nfounder of the so-called “Deutsche Mathematik”.\nTaking his start from the dismissal of Landau from the mathematical\nFaculty in Göttingen, Bieberbach tried to rationalize why the\nstudents had forced Landau’s dismissal. In a\nKurzreferat for his talk he summarized his aims as\nfollows: \nIn his two papers 1934b and 1934c, he claimed that the mathematics\npracticed by Landau was foreign to the German spirit. He compared\nErhard Schmidt and Landau and claimed that in the first case \nOther important oppositions brought forward by Bieberbach as\n“evidence” for his claims were Gauss vs. Cauchy-Goursat on\ncomplex numbers; Poincaré vs. Maxwell in mathematical physics;\nLandau vs. Schmidt; and Jacobi vs. Klein. \nBy relying on the psychology of types by the notorious Marburg\npsychologist Jaensch he then went on to oppose Jewish/Latin and German\npsychological types. The fault line, so to speak, was between a\nmathematics driven by intuition, typical of German mathematics, and\nthe formalism allegedly espoused by the Jewish/Latin mathematicians.\nObviously, Bieberbach was forced to do a lot of gerrymandering to make\nsure that important German mathematicians did not end up on the wrong\nside of the equation (see what he says of Weierstrass, Euler and\nHilbert). The basis of these mathematical differences was to be found\nin racial characteristics: \nThe reason for discussing Bieberbach in this context is that his case\nexemplifies an attempt at rooting the notion of style in something\nmore fundamental, such as national characteristics interpreted in\nterms of psychology and racial features. Moreover, his case is also of\ninterest as his approach to style shows how such theorizing can be put\nin the service of a twisted political program. \nFortunately, talk of national styles in mathematics does not have to\ncarry with it all the implications that were found in Bieberbach.\nIndeed, when historians today refer to national styles they do so\nwithout the nationalism that motivated the older contributions.\nRather, they are concerned with describing how “local”\ncultures play a role in the constitution of knowledge (see also Larvor\n2016). While increased mobility and email communications make it\nharder for national styles to thrive, special political conditions\nmight also favor the persistence of such a style. This is the case,\nfor instance, of the Russian style in algebraic geometry and\nrepresentation theory. As Robert MacPherson has pointed out to the\nauthor, this case of national style would deserve a more extensive\ninvestigation and it would be interesting to study how the fall of the\nSoviet Union impacted this style. By contrast, an instance of a\nnational style that has been extensively studied is that of Italian\nstyle algebraic geometry. This case has been studied with care by a\nnumber of historians of mathematics and in particular by Aldo\nBrigaglia (see also Casnati et al. 2016). For instance in a recent\narticle, Brigaglia writes: \nThe scare quotes highlight the problem of trying to grasp the\ndifference between ‘schools’, ‘styles’,\n‘methodologies’ etc. (see Rowe 2003) There has been no\nattempt to discuss analytically the notion of ‘national\nstyle’ for the history of mathematics—in any case, nothing\ncomparable to what Harwood 1993 does in the first chapter of his book.\nThe situation is also complicated by the fact that different authors\nuse different terminologies while perhaps referring to the same issue.\nFor instance, there has been much talk recently of ‘images of\nmathematics’ (Corry 2004a, 2004b, Bottazzini and Dahan\nDalmedico, 2001). In the last section, we shall return to reflect on\nthese different usages of style in the historiographical literature on\nmathematics and how they compare with those in the natural\nsciences. \nSo far the discussion has focused on style as a tool for philosophers\nof culture and for historians of mathematics. But do mathematicians\nrecognize the existence of styles in mathematics? Once again, it would\nnot be difficult to give isolated quotes where mathematicians might\ntalk about the style of the ancients or the abstract algebraic style\nor categorial style. In logical work one finds occurrences of style in\nsuch denominations as ‘Bishop-style constructive\nmathematics’. What are difficult to find are systematic\ndiscussions by mathematicians of the notion of style. The case of\nBieberbach was mentioned above but no detailed discussion of the\nexamples he adduced as evidence of differences in style was given\nthere, partly because they are so twisted by his desire to provide\nsupport for his ideological point of view that there are reasons to\ndoubt that one would gain much by way of an analysis of his case\nstudies. \nAn interesting contribution is an article by Claude Chevalley from\n1935 titled “Variations du style\nmathématique”. Chevalley takes the existence of\nstyle for granted. He begins as follows: \nHowever, Chevalley did not try to reflect on the notion of style here\ninvolved. Rather he was concerned to show by means of an important\nexample the features of the transition between two styles of doing\nmathematics that had characterized the passage from nineteenth century\nmathematics to twentieth century approaches. The first style described\nby Chevalley is the Weierstrassian style, ‘the style of\nε’. It finds its ‘raison\nd’être’ in the need to rigorize the calculus\nmoving away from the unclarities related to such notions as\n“infinitely small quantity” etc. The development of\nanalysis in the nineteenth century (analytic functions, Fourier\nseries, Gauss’ theories of surfaces, Lagrangian equations in\nmechanics etc.) led to a critical analysis \nChevalley went on to single out the discovery of a continuous nowhere\ndifferentiable function, due to Weierstrass, as the most important\nelement of this revolution. As Weierstrass’ function can be\ngiven in terms of a Fourier expansion with a quite normal appearance,\nit became obvious that many demonstrations in mathematics assumed\nclosure condition that needed to be rigorously established. The\nconcept of limit, as defined by Weierstrass, was the powerful tool\nthat allowed such investigations. The reconstruction of analysis\npursued by Weierstrass and his followers turned out to be not only\nfoundationally successful but also mathematically fruitful. Here is\nhow close Chevalley comes to characterizing this style: \nOut of this approach one could also build the system of complex\nnumbers as pair of reals and the points of spaces in n\ndimensions as n-tuples of reals. This gave the impression\nthat mathematics could be unified by means of constructive definitions\nstarting from the real numbers. However, things went differently and\nChevalley tries to account for the reasons that led one to give up\nthis “constructive” approach in favor of an axiomatic\napproach. Various algebraic theories, such as group theory gave rise\nto relationships that could not be constructed starting from the real\nnumbers. Moreover, the constructive definition of complex numbers was\nequivalent to fixing an arbitrary reference system and thus endowing\nthese objects with properties that hid their real nature. On the other\nhand one was familiar with Hilbert’s axiomatization of geometry\nwhich, although rigorous, did not have the character of artificiality\nof the constructive theories. In this case the entities are not\nconstructed but rather defined through the axioms. This approach\ndeveloped to influence analysis itself. Chevalley mentioned the theory\nof Lebesgue integral that was obtained by first setting down what\nproperties the integral had to satisfy and then showing that a domain\nof objects satisfying those properties existed. The same idea was used\nby Frechet by setting down the properties that were to characterize\nthe operation of limit thereby arriving at a general theory of\ntopological spaces. Another example mentioned by Chevalley is the\naxiomatization of field theory given by Steinitz in 1910. Chevalley\nconcluded that \nMoreover, the constitution of domains that are perfectly suited to\ncertain operations allows one to establish general theorems on the\nobjects under consideration. In this way one can characterize the\noperations of infinitesimal analysis algebraically but without any of\nthe naïveté which had characterized the previous algebraic\napproaches. \nChevalley’s article is a precious source from a contemporary\nmathematician on the topic of style. He forcefully shows the\ndifference between the late nineteenth century arithmetization of\nanalysis and the early twentieth century axiomatic-algebraic approach.\nHowever, it has its limitations. The notion of style is not thematized\nas such and it is not clear that the features adduced to explain the\nparticular historical events might provide the general tools for\nanalyzing other transitions in mathematical style. But perhaps that\nshould, if anything, be the task of a philosopher of mathematics (for\na detailed analysis of Chevalley’s approach to style see Rabouin\n2017). \nIn a book entitled “Introducción al estilo\nmatematico” (1971) the Spanish philosopher Javier de Lorenzo\nattempted to write a history of mathematics (admittedly partial) in\nterms of style. Although by 1971 Granger’s work, to be discussed\nin section 5, had already appeared, de Lorenzo was not aware of it and\nthe only source on style he uses is Chevalley’s article. Indeed\nthis book is merely an extension of Chevalley’s study to include\nmany more ‘styles’ that have appeared in the history of\nmathematics. The list of mathematical styles studied by de Lorenzo is\nthe following: \nThe general set up reminds one much of Chevalley’s approach and\none would look in vain in de Lorenzo’s book for a satisfactory\naccount of what style is. It is true that there are some interesting\nobservations about the role of language in determining a style but a\ngeneral philosophical analysis is missing. There is however an\nimportant point to be emphasized concerning the treatment given by\nChevalley and de Lorenzo, which seems to point to an important feature\nof the use of ‘style’ in mathematics. \nIn his paper “De la catégorie de style en histoire\ndes sciences” (Gayon 1996), and in the later Gayon 1999,\nJean Gayon presents the different usages of ‘style’ in the\nhistoriography of science as falling between two camps (in a way he\nfollows Hacking 1992 here). First, there is the usage of\n‘scientific style’ on the part of those who pursue a\n‘local history of science’. Usually this type of analysis\nfocuses on ‘local groups or schools’ or on\n‘nations’. For instance, this type of history deemphasizes\nthe universal component of knowledge and stresses the difficulties\ninvolved in translating experiments from one setting to another. Such\ndifficulties are shown to depend on the ‘local’\ntraditions, which include specific technical and theoretical know-how\nwhich is “fundamental to setting-up, realizing, and analyzing\nthe outcome of those experiments” (Corry 2004b) Secondly, there\nis the use of ‘scientific style’ exemplified in works such\nas Crombie’s 1994 ‘Styles of Scientific Thinking in the\nEuropean Tradition’. Crombie enumerates the following scientific\nstyles: \nGayon remarks that this latter notion of ‘style’ could be\nreplaced by ‘method’ and that ‘the styles discussed\nhere have nothing to do with local styles’. He also remarks that\nwhen it comes to local styles the groups that act as sociological\nsupport for such analyses are either ‘research groups’ or\n‘nations’. There has been much emphasis in recent history\nof the experimental sciences on such local factors (see, for instance,\nGavroglu 1990 for the ‘styles of reasoning’ of two low\ntemperature laboratories, that of Dewar (London) and that of\nKamerlingh Onnes (Leiden)). \nHistorians of mathematics are now attempting to apply such\nhistoriographical approaches also to pure mathematics. A recent\nattempt in this direction is the work of Epple in terms of\n‘epistemic configurations’ such as his recent article on\nAlexander and Reidemeister’s early work in knot theory (Epple\n2004; but see also Rowe 2003 and 2004, and Epple 2011). The support\ngroups for such investigations are not referred to as\n‘schools’ but rather as ‘mathematical\ntraditions’ or ‘mathematical cultures’. \nWhat about the ‘methodological’ notion of style à\nla Crombie? Have historians of mathematics made much use of this?\nApart from numerous treatments of the first style (axiomatic method),\nthere is not much in this area but an interesting historical\ncontribution is Goldstein’s work on Frenicle de Bessy (2001).\nShe argues that the pure mathematics as practiced by Frenicle de Bessy\nhad much in common with the Baconian style of experimental science.\nPerhaps one should mention here that experimental mathematics is now a\nblossoming field which might soon find its historian (see Baker 2008\nfor a philosophical account of experimental mathematics and\nSørensen 2016 for an analysis in terms of mathematical\ncultures). This tends to be a topic of high interest for philosophers,\nas it impinges on issues of mathematical method. The problem can be\nsimply put as follows: in addition to what Crombie lists as\nmethodological style (a) [axiomatic], what other styles are pursued in\nmathematical practice? Corfield 2003 touches upon the problem in the\nintroduction to his book “Towards a philosophy of\n‘real’ mathematics” when he, referring to the\nCrombie list above, says: \nIn note 7 Corfield mentions John Thompson’s comment to the\neffect that the classification of finite simple groups is an exercise\nin taxonomy. \nIt is not the goal of this essay to address squarely the vast set of\nissues that emerge from the previous quotes. But it should be pointed\nout that these issues represent a fresh and stimulating territory for\na descriptive epistemology of mathematics and that some work has\nalready been carried out in this direction (see Etcheverría\n1996; van Bendegem 1998; Baker 2008). \nFinally, how to put together the ‘local’ and\n‘methodological’ styles with what is found in Chevalley\nand de Lorenzo? In the case of mathematics there is good evidence that\nthe most natural locus for ‘styles’ falls, so to speak, in\nbetween these two categories. Indeed, by and large, mathematical\nstyles go beyond any local community defined in simpler sociological\nterms (nationality, direct membership in a school etc.) and are such\nthat the support group can only be characterized by the specific\nmethod of enquiry pursued. On the other hand, the method is not so\nuniversal as to be identifiable as one of the six methods described by\nCrombie or in the extended list given by Hacking. Here are some\npossible examples, where the names attached to each position should\nnot mislead the reader into thinking that one is merely dealing with\n‘individual’ styles. \nOf course, it might just be the case that also in history and\nphilosophy of science there are ‘intermediate’ levels of\nstyle such as the ones being described here (one example that comes to\nmind is ‘Newtonian style’ in mathematical physics) but the\nfact that Jean Gayon did not detect them as central seems to point to\nthe fact that the situation in history and philosophy of mathematics\nis quite different, as these ‘intermediate’ styles are\nthose that have been more thoroughly discussed and that correspond to\nthe styles analyzed by Chevalley and de Lorenzo. Moreover, discussions\nof local mathematical cultures tend to do without the concept of\nstyle. \nThe problem of an epistemology of style can perhaps be roughly put as\nfollows. Are the stylistic elements present in mathematical discourse\ndevoid of cognitive value and so only part of the coloring of\nmathematical discourse or can they be seen as more intimately related\nto its cognitive content? The notion of coloring here comes from Frege\nwho distinguished in “The thought” between the truth\ncondition of a statement and those aspects of the statement which\nmight provide information about the state of mind of the speaker or\nhearer but do not contribute to its truth conditions. In natural\nlanguage, typical elements of coloring are expressions of regret such\nas “unfortunately”. “Unfortunately, it’s\nsnowing” has the same truth conditions as “it’s\nsnowing” and “unfortunately”, in the first sentence,\nis only part of the coloring. Jacques and Monique Dubucs have\ngeneralized this distinction to proofs in “La couleur des\npreuves” (Dubucs and Dubucs 1994) where they deal with the\nproblem of a ‘rhetoric of mathematics’, a problem quite\nclose to that of an analysis of style. Dubbing traditional rhetoric as\n‘residualist’, for it takes into account only phenomena of\nnon-cognitive significance such as ornamentation etc. of the\nmathematical text but leaves the object (such as the content of a\ndemonstration) untouched, they explored the options for a more\nambitious “rhetoric of mathematics”. \nOne can thus begin to articulate the first position that can be\ndefended with respect to the epistemological significance of style. It\nis a position that denies style any essential cognitive role and\nreduces it to a phenomenon of subjective coloring. According to this\nposition, stylistic variations would only reveal superficial\ndifferences of expression that leave the content of discourse\nuntouched. \nTwo more ambitious positions have been defended in the literature\nconcerning the cognitive content of style. The first seems to be\ncompatible with a form of Platonism or realism in mathematics whereas\nthe second is definitely opposed to it. What is being alluded to are\nthe two main proposals available in the literature, namely those of\nGranger 1968 and Hacking 1992, which will now be briefly\ndescribed. \nGranger’s Essay of a philosophy of style (Essai\nd’une philosophie du style 1968) is the most systematic and\nworked-out effort to develop a theory of style for mathematics.\nGranger’s program is so ambitious and rich that a thorough\ndiscussion of the structure of his book and of his detailed analyses\nwould need a paper by itself. Due to limitation of space, the aim here\nis to give just a rough idea of what the project consists in and to\nshow that the epistemological role of style defended by Ganger is\ncompatible with a realism about mathematical entities or structures.\n \nGranger’s aim is to provide an analysis of ‘scientific\npractice’. He defines practice as “an activity considered\nwith its complex context, and in particular the social conditions\nwhich give it meaning in a world effectively experienced\n(vécu)” (1968, 6). Science he defines as\n“construction of abstract models, consistent and effective, of\nthe phenomena” (13). Thus, a scientific practice has both\n‘universal’ or ‘general’ components and\n‘individual’ components. The analysis of scientific\npractice requires at least three types of investigations: \nAll three aspects would be necessary for an analysis of\n‘scientific practice’ but in his book Granger only focuses\non 1. Where do style and mathematics come in? Mathematics comes in as\none of the areas of investigation that can be subjected to a stylistic\nanalysis of science (Granger’s book provides applications not\nonly to mathematics but also to linguistics and the social sciences).\nWhat about style? Every social practice, according to Granger, can be\nstudied from the point of view of style. This includes political\naction, artistic creation and scientific activity. There is thus a\ngeneral stylistics that will try to capture the most general stylistic\nfeatures of such activities and then more ‘local’\nstylistic analyses such as the one provided by Granger for scientific\nactivities. Obviously, the concept of style here invoked must be one\nthat is much more encompassing than the one usually associated with\nthis term and indeed one that would make application to such areas as\npolitical activity or scientific activity not just metaphorical but\nrather ‘connaturate’ to such activities. \nGranger’s analysis of mathematical style takes up chapters 2, 3,\nand 4 of his book. Chapter 2 deals with Euclidean style and the notion\nof magnitude; chapter 3 with the opposition between ‘Cartesian\nstyle and Desarguian style’ (on the Cartesian style see also\nRabouin 2017); finally, chapter 4 concerns the ‘birth of\nvectorial style’. All of these analyses center around the\nconcept of “geometrical magnitude”. \nOne gets a good sense of what Granger is after by simply looking at an\nexample that he describes in his preface. This is an example\nconcerning the complex numbers. \nStyle, according to Granger, is a way of imposing structure to an\nexperience. Experience must be taken here to go beyond empirical\nexperience. In general the kind of experience the mathematician\nappeals to is not empirical. From this experience come the\n“intuitive” components that are structured in mathematical\nactivity. But one should not think that there is an\n“intuition” to which, as it were externally, one then\napplies a form. The mathematical activity gives rise at the same time\nto form and content within the background of a certain experience. \nAs an example Granger gives three ways of introducing the complex\nnumbers; all three ways account for the structural properties which\ncharacterize the algebraic structure in question. The first way\nintroduces the complex numbers by trigonometric representation using\nangles and directions. The second introduces them as operators applied\nto vectors. In the first case, one defines a complex number as a pair\nof real numbers and the additive properties are then immediate. By\ncontrast, in the second case, it is the multiplicative properties that\nare immediately seized. But, and this is the third way, one can also\nintroduce complex numbers by regular square matrices. This leads to\nseeing the complex numbers as a system of polynomials in x\nmodulo x2+1. \nThus, in Granger’s theory mathematical styles are modes of\npresentation, or modes of grasping the mathematical structures. At\nleast in some cases these effects of style leave the mathematical\nobjects or structures unaffected although they will affect the\ncognitive mode in which they are apprehended, therefore affecting how\nthey might be subjected to extension, applied in various areas etc.\nEven though Granger might have sympathized with a Kantianism without a\ntranscendental subject, and thus think of style as constitutive, it\nseems that his position is at least compatible with a form of realism\nabout mathematical entities. This does not seem to be the case for the\nthird and final epistemological position to be discussed, which is due\nto Ian Hacking. \nAs pointed out earlier, Hacking, following Crombie, has proposed\ninvestigating the notion of style as a “new analytical\ntool” for history and philosophy of science. His preference is\nto speak of styles of reasoning (see also Mancosu 2005) as opposed to\nFleck’s thought styles or Crombie’s styles of thinking\n(his most recent preference is to speak of ‘Styles of scientific\nthinking & doing’; for the most recent discussion of\nHacking’s program at the time of writing see Kusch 2010 and the\nspecial issue of Studies in History and Philosophy of Science\n(issue 43, 2012), including Hacking 2012 and several other\ncontributions). The reason is that Hacking wants to move away from the\npsychological level of reasoning and work with the more\n‘objective’ level of arguments. He explicitly defines his\nproject as a continuation of Kant’s project aimed at explaining\nhow objectivity is possible. And indeed, Hacking’s position\nrejects realism and embraces a strongly constitutive role for style.\nAccording to Hacking, styles are defined by a set of necessary\nconditions (he does not attempt, wisely, to provide sufficient\nconditions): \nIt should be clear that this notion of style, just like\nGranger’s, attributes a very important role to style as\ngrounding the objectivity of an entire area of scientific activity but\nthat, unlike Granger’s, it is committed ontologically to a\nrejection of realism. Styles are essential in the constitution of\nmathematical objects and the latter do not have a form of existence\nindependent of them. Hacking has not extensively discussed case\nstudies from the history of mathematics although one of his papers\n(Hacking 1995) deals with four constructionalist images of mathematics\n(the word “constructionalism” is borrowed from Nelson\nGoodman) and shows how well they fit with his picture of ‘styles\nof thinking’. By implication, it is also clear that more\nrobustly committed realistic positions will not fit well with\nHacking’s account of reasoning styles. \nThus, three possible models for explicating the epistemological role\nof ‘styles’ in mathematics have been considered. There are\nsurely many more possible positions waiting to be articulated but so\nfar this is all that can be found in the literature. \nAs pointed out at the outset, the topic of mathematical style is not\none of the canonical areas of investigation in philosophy of\nmathematics. Indeed, this entry is the first attempt to encompass in a\nsingle paper the multifarious contributions to this topic.\nNonetheless, it should be clear by now that reflection on mathematical\nstyle is present in contemporary philosophical activity and deserves\nto be taken seriously. But the work is just beginning. One needs many\nmore case studies of mathematical styles and a clearer articulation of\nthe epistemological and ontological consequences yielded by different\nconceptualizations of style. In addition, one would like to see a\nbetter integration of all this work with the work on cognitive styles\nthat is found in cognitive psychology and mathematical education.\nFinally, standard philosophical chestnuts, such as the relationship of\nform and content to style, and the relation of style to normativity\nand intentionality would also have to be addressed (for a very good\ndiscussion of such topics in aesthetics see Meskin 2005).","contact.mail":"mancosu@socrates.Berkeley.EDU","contact.domain":"socrates.Berkeley.EDU"}]
