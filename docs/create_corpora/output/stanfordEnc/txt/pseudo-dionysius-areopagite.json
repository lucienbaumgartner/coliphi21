Thus, these works\nmight be regarded as a successful ‘forgery’, providing\nPseudo-Dionysius with impeccable Christian credentials that\nconveniently antedated Plotinus by close to two hundred years.  So\nsuccessful was this stratagem that Dionysius acquired almost apostolic\nauthority, giving his writings enormous influence in the Middle Ages\nand the Renaissance, though his views on the Trinity and Christ (e.g.,\nhis emphasis upon the single theandric activity of Christ\n(see Letter 4) as opposed to the later orthodox view of two\nactivities) were not always accepted as orthodox since they required\nrepeated defenses, for example, by John of Scythopolis and by Maximus\nConfessor. Dionysius’ fictitious identity, doubted already in the\nsixth century by Hypatius of Ephesus and later by Nicholas of Cusa,\nwas first seriously called into question by Lorenzo Valla in 1457 and\nJohn Grocyn in 1501, a critical viewpoint later accepted and\npublicized by Erasmus from 1504 onward. But it has only become\ngenerally accepted in modern times that instead of being the disciple\nof St. Paul, Dionysius must have lived in the time of Proclus, most\nprobably being a pupil of Proclus, perhaps of Syrian origin, who knew\nenough of Platonism and the Christian tradition to transform them\nboth. Since Proclus died in 485 CE, and since the first clear citation\nof Dionysius’ works is by Severus of Antioch between 518 and 528, then\nwe can place Dionysius’ authorship between 485 and 518–28\nCE. These dates are confirmed by what we find in the Dionysian corpus:\na knowledge of Athenian Neoplatonism of the time, an appeal to\ndoctrinal formulas and parts of the Christian liturgy (e.g., the\nCreed) current in the late fifth century, and an adaptation of late\nfifth-century Neoplatonic religious rites, particularly theurgy, as we\nshall see below. \n\nIt must also be recognized that “forgery” is a modern\nnotion. Like Plotinus and the Cappadocians before him, Dionysius does\nnot claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a\ntradition.  Adopting the persona of an ancient figure was a long\nestablished rhetorical device (known as declamatio), and\nothers in Dionysius’ circle also adopted pseudonymous names from\nthe New Testament. Dionysius’ works, therefore, are much less a\nforgery in the modern sense than an acknowledgement of reception and\ntransmission, namely, a kind of coded recognition that the resonances\nof any sacred undertaking are intertextual, bringing the diachronic\nstructures of time and space together in a synchronic way, and that\nthis theological teaching, at least, is dialectically received from\nanother. Dionysius represents his own teaching as coming from a\ncertain Hierotheus and as being addressed to a certain Timotheus. He\nseems to conceive of himself, therefore, as an in-between figure, very\nlike a Dionysius the Areopagite, in fact. Finally, if Iamblichus and\nProclus can point to a primordial, pre-Platonic wisdom, namely, that\nof Pythagoras, and if Plotinus himself can claim not to be an\noriginator of a tradition (after all, the term Neoplatonism is just a\nconvenient modern tag), then why cannot Dionysius point to a\ndistinctly Christian theological and philosophical resonance in an\nearlier pre-Plotinian wisdom that instantaneously bridged the gap\nbetween Judaeo-Christianity (St. Paul) and Athenian paganism (the\nAreopagite)? [For a different view of Dionysius as crypto-pagan, see\nLankila, 2011, 14–40.]  \n\nReading Dionysius can be a difficult business for many reasons:\npartly because his frequent hyperbolic theological language is foreign\nto our own English-speaking practices; partly because almost\nevery word he employs resonates with the whole history of ancient\nthought, from the Christian Platonism of the Fathers, particularly,\nGregory of Nyssa and the Cappadocians, to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus,\nIamblichus, and Proclus, while his theology focuses predominantly upon\nthe Jewish and Christian scriptures (which Dionysius calls\n“divine oracles”); partly, again, because the order in\nwhich we are to read his works is unclear and because Dionysius\nmentions at least seven works that have been lost. So we are unsure how\nto read him since so much seems doubtful or potentially fictitious.\nThis picture is further complicated by the titles subdividing portions\nof his works, which appear, because of terminology peculiar to them, to\nhave been inserted by a later hand or hands. \n\nThe surviving writings are four treatises and ten letters. The four\ntreatises are: 1) On the divine names (DN) (Peri\ntheion onomaton, in Greek; De Divinis Nominibus, in\nLatin), the longest work of thirteen chapters that deals with\naffirmative or kataphatic theology, namely, the names attributed to God\nthe creator in scripture and also in pagan texts, but also exploring\nthe limits of language and therefore also involving negative or\napophatic theology. 2) On the celestial hierarchy\n(CH) (Peri tes ouranias hierarchias, in Greek; De\ncoelesti hierarchia, in Latin), a work that examines how the nine\nchoirs of angels (in scripture) are to be understood in lifting us up\nto God. 3) On the ecclesiastical hierarchy (EH)\n(Peri tes ekklestiastikes hierarchias, in Greek; De\necclesiastica hierarchia, in Latin) that examines the various\norders and liturgy of the church as relating us to God through a\ndivinely appointed but human hierarchy. And 4) On Mystical\ntheology (MT) (Peri mustikes theologias, in\nGreek; De mystica theologia, in Latin), a brief but powerful\nwork that deals with negative or apophatic theology and in which\ntheology becomes explicitly “mystical” for the first time\nin history (By mystical here we do not mean an extraordinary or private\nexperience of transcending one’s self in the modern sense of the term,\nbut simply “hidden”. On this see Bouyer, 1949; Vanneste,\n1959; McGinn 1994). There follow ten letters that provide helpful\ncomments upon topics in the above four treatises, especially letter 9\non what Dionysius calls symbolic theology of which works 2) and 3)\nabove (CH; EH) form a substantial part. The ten\nletters appear to be arranged in a roughly hierarchical order, letters\n1–4 being addressed to a monk (a certain Gaius, also the name of\none or more of St. Paul’s companions), letter 5 to a deacon, letter 6\nto a priest, and letters 7 and 9 to hierarchs or bishops. Letter 8\ndisrupts this order since it is addressed to a monk charged with\ndisrupting the hierarchical order itself! \n\nWhat order of the works are we to adopt? In the French translation\nof M. de Gandillac and the English translation of C. Luibheid and P.\nRorem (see bibliography), the order is DN, MT,\nCH and EH. In the manuscripts of the Areopagitic\ncorpus, the order is CH, EH, DN,\nMT, followed by the Letters. Dionysius himself provides an\nexplanatory outline that favors the order of Luibheid and Rorem, and\nthat gives a systematic organization to his body of work, including\nboth the treatises we presently possess and also the treatises which\neither no longer exist or, more likely, were never written. His outline\nis especially valuable for two of these latter treatises—the\nTheological Representations and the Symbolic\nTheology—since the order in which he claims to have written\nthem reveals both the relative worth of their contents and the\nsequence in which the reader should proceed. It thus helps the reader\nto divine the nature of their content, and to put them in their proper\nplace with the remaining two works written by Dionysius on the forms\nof theology. The first three—the Theological\nRepresentations, On the Divine Names, and\nthe Symbolic Theology—discuss ever more divided and\nsensuous forms of theology. The fourth theological work,\nthe Mystical Theology, reverses the sequence and restores the\nreader to the divine unity: \n\nIn this article we shall adopt a variant of this last order both\nbecause Dionysius himself seems to have favored it and because it\nclarifies the systematic structure of the theological works.  \n\nAlthough the Theological Representations is not extant, we\nare able to glean its content from Dionysius’ ample descriptions of it\nin his other works. It seems to have devoted itself to names for the\nthree persons within the godhead and their attributes. These names are\nthe representations mentioned in the work’s title. They describe two\nforms of differentiation within the godhead: the distinction into\npersons, and into attributes of the persons. Names for the persons\ninclude “Father,” “Son,” and “Holy\nSpirit.” Names for the attributes include “source,”\n“offshoot,” “flower,” and “light.”\nDionysius does not explain why he uses the term\n“representation” (hypotuposis) for these names,\nbut his fondness for puns may have led him to adopt it because of its\nsimilarity to “person” (hypostasis). \n\nSome of these names describe more than a person within the godhead.\nThe name “father,” for instance, may also be used of\nanimals, in which case it means the male parent. We seem to apply such\nnames literally to animals and only metaphorically to persons within\nthe godhead. But Dionysius uncovers a passage from Paul’s letter to the\nEphesians which leads him to claim otherwise. Paul says that God the\nFather is the one “from whom all fatherhood in the heavens and on\nearth is named.” On the basis of this scriptural authority,\nDionysius explains that we are able to use the terms\n“father” and “son” of animals only because the\ngodhead has already undergone the same relation. In other words, the\ninternal causality exercised within the godhead is the source of all\nother causality. This includes not only the causation of one animal by\nanother, but of one angel by another, since angels, too, receive the\nnames of “father” and “son.” \n\nStrictly speaking, all of the theological works except for the\nTheological Representations devote themselves to divine names\nor names for the godhead. But Dionysius devotes his second theological\ntreatise, entitled On the Divine Names only to a particular\nkind of divine name. This kind of name describes a third distinction\nwithin the godhead (in addition to the distinction of persons and of\npersonal attributes): the distinction into the multiple attributes of\nthe godhead as a whole. Though the names apply to the godhead as a\nwhole, and so refer to it as a unity, each name is different and so,\ntaken together, they differentiate the godhead. The implicit\ndistinction between the unity of the godhead and the multiplicity of\nthe names is reflected in the very structure of the names\nthemselves. Each name includes the same prefix: “over-”,\nor\nhyper- in Greek, which indicates the unity of the\ngodhead to whom the names are applied. But each name is different,\nindicating the self-multiplication of the godhead. The result is\na set of names like “over-good,”\n“over-being,” and “over-life.”\nOccasionally, Dionysius also makes use of a second, equivalent prefix:\n“pre-” or pro- in Greek. God is\n“pre-good,” and “pre-being,”\nmeaning that he has the attributes of creatures in a way that\ntranscends both creature and attribute. The “over-”\nand “pre-” prefixes must be applied strictly to the\nnames when they are used of God in himself. On the other hand, when the\nnames are used only of God as cause, the prefixes may be left off,\nsince the causality of God is already a procession into the\ndifferentiation properly signified by each of the different names. \n\nSome of Dionysius’ later medieval interpreters suggest that God\npossesses the attributes of creatures in their most proper and ideal\nform, but Dionysius himself does not suggest this. Instead, the most\nproper object of the names is the highest creature. The exemplary\ninstances of “goodness,” “being,” and\n“life,” for example, are the highest of the angels or\nintelligible minds, as Dionysius also calls them. For this reason,\nDionysius frequently refers to this type of name as an\n“intelligible name.” He incorporates into the number of\nintelligible names the traditional Neoplatonic intelligible categories:\nbeing, identity, difference, rest, and motion, as well as the\nNeoplatonic triad of being, life, and intellect. The fact that God\ntranscends the proper meaning of these names does not mean that he\nought to be called “non-being,”\n“non-life,” or “non-intellect.”\nDionysius prefers simply to say that God is “over being,”\n“over life,” and “over intellect.” \n\nThe intelligible names could form the ground of a theology\nindependent of any specific religious tradition or sacred text. Many of\nthem are central to Platonic sources outside the context of\nChristianity, and appear only incidentally and obscurely in the Hebrew\nand Christian scriptures. They also describe the intelligible structure\nof the cosmos, a structure that is accessible to all human inquiry,\nwhether assisted by scriptural texts or not. But Dionysius explicitly\ndenies that the names may be acquired from any source other than the\nHebrew and Christian scriptures. Even if the names could be derived\nfrom contemplation of the world’s intelligible structure, we apply them\nin theology to the cause of that structure and not to the structure\nitself. Since the cause of that structure is beyond the grasp of human\ninquiry, we cannot rely on our own powers for our description. We\ndepend instead on the revelation of the scriptures as our source for\nthe intelligible names. \n\nFew human beings have the ability to contemplate the intelligible\nnames in their purity. Most of us require the names to be incarnated in\nvisible things before we can understand them. Unable to see\n“being,” “life,” and “wisdom” in\nthemselves, we need a visible being who is living and wise. Such a\nperson can then become the means by which we contemplate the\nintelligible. Dionysius’ possibly fictional teacher Hierotheus is one\nsuch visible incarnation of the names. But Hierotheus may do more than\nincarnate the names. He can also unfold them in speech, taking the\nunitary name of “being” and describing it at length, as\nDionysius does in the fifth chapter of On the Divine Names. As\nhe describes it, the name unfolds itself into a form that is more\nmultiple, because of the many words used in his description. It thus\napproaches the multiple character of our ordinary human way of knowing,\nand becomes more easily understood. \n\nOther names directly refer to visible things, whose multiplicity and\naccessibility to sensation make them easy for us to understand. The\ndifficulty with these names, referred to by Dionysius and the\nNeoplatonic tradition generally as “symbols,” is that they\nhave no inherent relation to the godhead at all. Their literal\nsignification is restricted to the realm of the sensuous, and so they\nmust be turned into metaphors if they are to become useful for\ntheology. This is the task of Dionysius’ Symbolic Theology.\nThough the work itself is not extant, we find him undertaking the same\nproject in each of his extant works. \n\nOne of Dionysius’ favorite sources of symbols is a verse from the\n78th psalm: “the Lord awoke, like a strong man,\npowerful but reeling with wine.” Taken literally, the verse\nindicates that God sleeps and gets drunk on wine, two activities that\nproperly apply only to embodied, visible beings. Only an embodied being\ncan manifest the activities to which the names “sleep” and\n“drunkenness” literally refer. If we are to apply such\nterms to God, they must be attached to a foreign, intelligible content\nthat will be able to lead the interpreter of the symbolic name to the\ncontemplation of an intelligible name. In “sleep,” for\nexample, Dionysius finds a meaning common to both intelligible and\nvisible things: withdrawal from the world. He concludes that God’s\nsleep is his “removal from and lack of communication with the\nobjects of his providence.” In drunkenness, Dionysius sees a kind\nof over-filling, and so he explains that God’s drunkenness is\n“the overloaded measurelessness of all goods in the one who is\ntheir cause.” From the easily comprehended literal meaning of the\nterm, the reader rises to the more difficult intelligible terrain of\nimparticipability and measurelessness. \n\nDrunkenness and sleep are what Dionysius calls “dissimilar\nsimilarities.” They strike us as exceptionally unworthy of God,\nand so are “dissimilar,” yet they reveal an intelligible\ntruth capable of leading us to him, and so are “similar.”\nDionysius privileges such names over more appropriate names like\n“golden” and “luminous.” The more that the name\nseems appropriate, the more we are likely to be lulled into thinking\nthat we have adequately comprehended the godhead in our use of the\nname. The very materiality and ignobility of the dissimilar\nsimilarities cry out that the names do not literally describe the\ngodhead, and compel the reader to seek the intelligible truth behind\nthe name. \n\nWe may wonder whether the symbolic names are a necessary part of\ntheology at all, since their content belongs to the intelligible\ntheology and not to a “symbolic” theology. Dionysius\nrepeatedly affirms their necessity, not because of the character of\ntheir content, but because of the nature of the human soul. The soul\nmay be divided into two parts: one passionate and the other\npassionless. Passionate here means set in motion by things exterior to\nthe soul. The senses, for example, are passionate because they can\nonly function when an outside object gives them something to\nsense. Dionysius follows a longstanding Neoplatonic tradition when he\nsays that most of us are unable to engage our passionless part\ndirectly. Instead, our passionless part comes into play only\nindirectly, through the activity of the passionate part. By sensing\nthe world around us, we are led to contemplate its intelligible\nstructures through the sensations we receive. Even those few human\nbeings who can engage their passionless part directly find it helpful\nto shore up their contemplation with examples drawn from the senses.\nDionysius may understand the causality of God directly, and yet still\nfind it helpful to compare God’s causality to the emanation of light\nfrom the sun. \n\nSuch examples do not require the presence of a revealed scripture.\nSkilled teachers in any subject are characterized by their ability to\ncome up with helpful examples drawn from ordinary experience when\nexplaining a difficult intelligible truth. Dionysius himself frequently\nresorts to examples “at our level” in order to explain\nsomething intelligible. The scriptural symbol goes further, attempting\nto reveal the God who is before and beyond even the intelligible truth.\nThe highest human intellect has little ability to attain this truth\ndirectly, and so we cannot rely on intellectual teachers as guides to\nthat truth. We require the gift of symbols, which tie our ordinary\ncomprehension to the godhead beyond being. And so Dionysius does not\ndescribe the symbolic names as pedagogical tools developed by\ntheologians. The names appear instead in the ecstatic visions of the\nprophets. Though Dionysius explicitly asserts our dependence on the\nHebrew and Christian scriptures as the source of these symbols, he has\nno qualms about embellishing the list of names with symbols drawn from\nother traditions. For instance, he discusses at length the name of\n“mixing bowl,” which has no real source in the Christian or\nHebrew scriptures, but occurs centrally in the Platonic philosophy\nderiving from Plato’s Timaeus. \n\nWhen Dionysius praises “dissimilar similarities” over\nseemingly more appropriate symbolic names for God, he explains that at\nleast some dissimilar names are negations, and negations are more\nproper to God than affirmations. The Mystical Theology has\nthis last, most arcane form of theology as its subject. Negations are\nproperly applied not only to the names of the symbolic theology. Any\nand all of the divine names must be negated, beginning with those of\nthe symbolic theology, continuing with the intelligible names and\nconcluding with the theological representations. The godhead is no\nmore “spirit,” “sonship,” and\n“fatherhood” than it is “intellect” or\n“asleep.” These negations must be distinguished from\nprivations. A privation is simply the absence of a given predicate\nthat could just as easily be present. The absence of the predicate is\nopposed to its presence: “lifeless” is opposed to\n“living.” But when we say that the godhead is not\n“living,” we do not mean that it is\n“lifeless.” The godhead is beyond the lifeless as well as\nbeyond the living. For this reason, Dionysius says that our\naffirmations of the godhead are not opposed to our negations, but that\nboth must be transcended: even the negations must be negated. \n\nThe most controversial and arcane passages of the Mystical\nTheology revolve around the mystical as taken in itself and not as\nthe act of negating the other forms of theology. Dionysius says that\nafter all speaking, reading, and comprehending of the names ceases,\nthere follows a divine silence, darkness, and unknowing. All three of\nthese characteristics seem privative, as though they were simply being\nthe absence of speech, sight, and knowledge respectively. But Dionysius\ndoes not treat them as privative. Instead, he uses temporal and spatial\nlanguage to mark off a special place and time for them. Using as his\nexample the account of Moses’ ascent up Mount Sinai in the Hebrew\nscriptures, Dionysius says that after Moses ascends through the\nsensible and intelligible contemplation of God, he then enters the\ndarkness above the mountain’s peak. The darkness is located above the\nmountain, and Moses enters it after his contemplation of God in the\nvarious forms of theology. Dionysius leaves the relation between Moses\nand the darkness highly obscure. Some commentators reduce it to a form\nof knowing, albeit an extraordinary form of knowing. Others reduce it\nto a form of affective experience, in which Moses feels something that\nhe can never know or explain in words. Dionysius himself does not give\ndecisive evidence in favor of either interpretive move. He speaks only\nof Moses’ “union” with the ineffable, invisible, unknowable\ngodhead. \n\nPerhaps even more vexing than the nature of union in Dionysius is\nthe question of how the theological treatises relate to Dionysius’ two\ntreatises on hierarchy. The Mystical Theology suggests an\nascent from the lower sensuous realm of reality through the\nintelligible intermediate realm to the darkness of the godhead itself,\nall accomplished by a single person. The hierarchic treatises, on the\nother hand, suggest that the sensible and intelligible realms are not\nplaces reached by a single being, but different kinds of beings, and\nthat the vision of God is handed from being to being downward through\nthe levels of the hierarchy. On the Celestial Hierarchy\ndescribes the intelligible realm as divided into nine ranks of beings:\nthe seraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, powers, authorities,\nprincipalities, archangels, and angels. On the Ecclesiastical\nHierarchy describes the human beings within the church as divided\ninto eight ranks: the hierarchs or bishops, priests, deacons, monks,\nlaity, catechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed. Dionysius\ndoes not address human life outside the church, except for a few\nscattered references to the angels presiding over other religious\ntraditions and the earlier “legal hierarchy” of the Jewish\nrite, which precedes the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Christian\nrite. \n\nThe hierarchs, highest within the human hierarchy, contemplate the\nintelligible realm directly, though presumably they contemplate only\nits lowest level: the angels. The visible result of the hierarchs’\ncontemplation of the angels is the series of rites belonging to the\nChristian church. Since the hierarchs are able to contemplate the\nintelligible directly, they do not perform the rites for their own\nsake, but for the sake of the monks and laity, who have no capacity for\ndirect intelligible contemplation. The monks and laity are able to\nengage the passionless part of their souls only through the passionate\npart, and so they require a visible trigger—the symbol—to \nstimulate their intelligible contemplation. The ranks of hierarch,\npriest, and deacon are in charge of administering the rites, with a\nspecific set of initiates in their care and a specific action to\nperform. The deacons purify the catechumens, penitents, and possessed,\nprimarily by giving them ethical instruction. The priests illuminate\nthe laity, who are able to receive the intelligible truth. The\nhierarchs perfect, a task whose initiate seems ideally to be the monk,\nsince Dionysius identifies the monks as leading the more perfect life\nof those who are not explicitly consecrated as clergy. \n\nThe very structure of the church reflects the different roles of the\nclergy and the laity. The hierarch stands still at the altar, facing\naway from the multiplicity of the church’s interior. He enters the nave\nof the church only to bring sacred objects like incense, bread and\nwine, and holy oil into the realm of multiplicity, the spatially\nextended nave. When he brings the censer into the nave, for example,\nits fragrance is distributed to the laity there, just as the bread and\nwine are later distributed in the eucharistic rite. The hierarch then\nreturns to the altar, and takes up again his own proper object of\ncontemplation, the intelligible source of the rites. The laity, on the\nother hand, remain within the spatially extended nave, but orient\nthemselves toward the altar, where the sacred objects are raised for\ntheir contemplation. Before this contemplation can occur, the\ncatechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed must be removed\nfrom the church. Their orientation toward the material prevents them\nfrom adequately contemplating the intelligible truth through its\nvisible manifestation in the sacred objects. \n\nAlthough the rites have intelligible contemplation as their goal, it\ndoes not appear that non-ritual forms of contemplation, like\nreading, can substitute for participation in the rites. Dionysian\ncontemplation is public, so that it may unite us to each other; it\ninvolves prayer, so that it may unite us explicitly with the godhead;\nit also requires bodies, since only the interaction of bodies allows\nthe contemplative act to include both components of our nature: body\nand soul. The names used in Dionysius’ theological treatises acquire\ntheir salvific power in this liturgical context. Although the rites\ninvolve the performance of bodily actions, they clothe themselves in\nwords: the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, and the oral tradition of\nthe liturgical prayers. Only the silence and unknowing of the\nMystical Theology finds no clear place within the liturgical\nrites of the hierarchy, since it transcends both the visible rites of\nthe laity and the intelligible contemplation of the clergy. It may be\nthat, just as some points of the liturgy call for a literal silence,\nthe intelligible contemplation of the hierarch at the altar must engage\nin its own form of silence, so as to allow the appearance of the\ngodhead beyond naming. On this question, however, Dionysius is as\nsilent as the mystical theology which crowns his vision of the human\nascent to God. \n\nHaving examined the plan and content of these works let us now take\na brief look at some of the sources of Dionysius’ ideas (and associated\nproblems), and at the character of Dionysius’ writing in order to\ndetermine what in practice he is actually doing and to see if there is\nanything genuinely philosophical in his writing. \n\nThere is a major tension between Platonism and Christianity in\nDionysius’ writing. Luther expressed the negative side of this tension:\n“Dionysius is most pernicious; he platonizes more than he\nChristianizes” (Babylonian Captivity of the Church\n(Weimarer Ausgabe 6, 562)). Von Balthasar has been more\npositive, seeing Dionysius’ Christianization of Neoplatonism “as\na side-effect of his own properly theological endeavor”,\nnamely, “the clear realized synthesis of truth and beauty, of\ntheology and aesthetics” (The Glory of the Lord, vol. 2,\n148–9). Perhaps one may suggest that neither Christianity nor\nPlatonism are side shows in Dionysius’ thought; They are rather\nmutually important whole perspectives that do not get lost in the mix,\nno matter how subordinate Neoplatonism nonetheless may be to\nChristianity for Dionysius himself. Dionysius’ central concern is how a\ntriune God, that he calls—among other things—the\nthearchy (god-rule; god-beginning), who is utterly\nunknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond\neven goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of\ncreation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of\ntheir source. To this end Dionysius employs some major Neoplatonic\ninsights: (1) The abiding—procession—return or\nconversion of all things as the creative and receptive expression of\nwhat it means for anything created to be. In Proclus’ terms in the\nElements of Theology, prop. 35: “Every effect remains in\nits cause, proceeds from it, and converts to it”. This is a way\nof expressing the vertical connectedness of everything by identity,\ndifference, and the overcoming of difference by a return to identity\nthat constitutes the nature of anything that is caused. (2) The\nhierarchical ordering of beings as an expression of both their natural\nplacements and their freedoms as well as the simultaneous immediacy,\nwithout intermediary, of the unknown God’s presence (on hierarchy see\nCH 3). Each thing and order bears relation to the whole or\nmanifests the whole, but “according to its own capacity”,\nas the famous Neoplatonic saying puts it. A rock or a worm, for\ninstance, is a window upon the entire universe if you only know how to\nlook. \n\nIn the case of (1), the contrast between Dionysius and Neoplatonism\nshould not be taken to be a contrast between free divine creation, on\nthe one hand, and supposed emanation or illumination by necessity, on\nthe other, for divine/ human freedom and creation out of\n“nothing” are conspicuous facets of Neoplatonic thought as\nwell. What we see in Dionysius is rather a new way of understanding the\nabiding, outpouring, and return, not only concretely in relation to the\nvarious hierarchies, and structurally in relation to the various works\n(DN is more concerned with procession, for instance, while\nEH, CH, and MT deal with different levels of\nreturn), but also in relation to God’s providential love that, while\nremaining supereminently identical to itself, and precontaining\neverything within itself, nonetheless is the creative power overflowing\ninto its effects (procession) in order to bring them back into identity\n(return): “[The Cause of All] is ‘all in all‘, as\nscripture affirms, and certainly he is to be praised as being for all\nthings the creator and originator, the One who brings them to\ncompletion, their preserver, their protector, and their home, the power\nwhich returns them to itself, and all this in the one single,\nirrepressible, and supreme act” (DN 1, 7,\n596c–597a). \n\nIn the case of (2) (hierarchy and divine presence), Dionysius\nemphasizes, much more so than the impression often suggested by\nNeoplatonism, the directness of creation. Every being, no\nmatter where it is placed in the scale of beings and no matter how\ndependent it might be on beings ontologically higher than it (e.g., for\nhuman beings, angels) is directly and immediately dependent upon God in\nand for its existence. Again, the contrasts often drawn between\nNeoplatonism’s “flight of the alone to the alone” and\nDionysius’ community of hierarchy or between the supposed Neoplatonic\nview that the One causes the existence of lower beings only through the\nmediation of the higher, while Christianity sees creation as immediate\nare simply false or too simplistic. Plotinus’ mysticism is not\n“solitary” in the sense often supposed and, for Plotinus,\nPorphyry, and Proclus, the One causes existence immediately and most\nprofoundly, whatever other influences enter into the complexity of\nexistence. What we see in Dionysius, by contrast, is a retention of\none’s place in hierarchy and a very concrete return to identity—in \nthe case of human beings, for instance, through scripture, ritual,\nand practical performance to a deeper union with God rather than a\nsimple, spatially conceived movement “up” the hierarchy.\nMore broadly still, we see in Dionysius’ thought new possibilities for\nthinking about divine love, a love that combines beyond beingness and\nunrestricted being, transcendence and yet even a kind of hyperessential\nvulnerability in rather startling ways, new ways consequently of\nthinking about both divine and human eros, about affectivity\n(cf. Dionysius’ famous dictum about learning from sacred writers, or\ndiscovering the truth oneself, or not only learning but\n“experiencing the divine things” (pathein ta\ntheia) (DN 2, 9); and compare Aristotle, fr. 15 (Rose)\nand Hebrews 5:8), about the nature of signification and the\nlimits of language (see section 4 below), about the theory of evil as\nprivation and non-being, however dependent this is upon one of\nProclus’ opuscula (cf. DN 4, 18–35), about the\naesthetic richness of this world in the light of theology and the life\nof the Church, and even about the soul–body relation, though\nanthropology is not a part of Dionysius’ primary concern (but see his\ncomments at EH 404B, 433c, 437a–440a, 441b, 553a ff,\n565b–c). \n\nTwo examples will have to suffice here: (a) Dionysius’ remarkable\ndescription of the ecstatic love of God and (b) his radical\ntransformation of the Neoplatonic intelligible and sensible worlds. \n\n(a) First, Dionysius evidently cannot accept in any single\nstraightforward sense the Neoplatonic notion of a One that excludes the\npossibility of expressing trinity. He therefore links in a new way God\nas unrestricted being with God as utterly beyond being or any\ndeterminate predications. At the same time in the DN he argues\nthat the ecstasy of love, which moves as a unifying force through\ncreation without departing from itself, is the divine nature. Dionysius\nadmits, in a note from Plato’s Phaedrus, that it is\ncharacteristic of yearning not to allow “lovers to belong to\nthemselves but only to their loved ones” (DN 4, 13).\nThis is shown, he goes on to argue, by the providential care of the\ngreater for the lesser (a reference to Proclus’ divine providential\nlove (eros pronoetikos) from the Commentary on the First\nAlcibiades, #56), by the love of equals, and by that of the lesser\nfor those better than them (a reference both to Aristotle’s seminal\ntreatment of friendship in the Nicomachean Ethics and to\nProclus’ returning or converting love (eros epistreptikos) in the same\nCommentary above), as also in the case of St. Paul’s famous\ndictum “I live now, not I, but Christ lives in me”\n(Gal 2:20). Might then such a belonging to one’s beloved be\ncharacteristic of God, if perhaps in a different sense? \n\nDionysius continues as follows: \n\nThe very notion is, of course, remarkable, the notion, that is, of a\nkind of conjunction of opposites that strives to express the\ninexpressible magnitude of divine love and even to suggest power and\nvulnerability (or “almost” vulnerability: “as it\nwere, charmed (beguiled, enchanted)”), as well as the possibility\nof a genuine two-way relation between Creator and creatures more\nin tune with Biblical thought. Yet the expression remains Greek, for\nthe word thelgetai that Dionysius chooses is one that echoes\nthe conclusion of Agathon’s speech in the Symposium where\nAgathon praises a Love that everyone “should hymn fairly, sharing\nin the song he sings that enchants/charms/beguiles (thelgon)\nthe thought (phronema) of all gods and human beings”\n(197c). Dionysius changes the context but does not really reverse the\npolarity: it is God who still—like human beings—is\nbeguiled by love and affection for beings and “led down” to\ndwell in them. Is this small detail and transposition merely\naccidental? It may well be, but in this context, the use of such a verb\nand thought is not accidental. Dionysius does not write as a Christian\nwalled off from pagan thought or as if he were a Neoplatonic thinker in\nChristian disguise. Instead he provokes and delights in intertextuality\nat every point. \n\n(b) A second example is the precise nature of Dionysius’\ntransposition of Neoplatonic structure. Dionysius makes concrete and\naccessible the whole world of Neoplatonism in the human, but\nsacramental life of the Church, a world of ordinary people and things\nwhose significance can only be fully realized and perfected in the\ncelestial and supercelestial world. \n\nFor Classical Neoplatonism, especially in its Plotinian form, the\nreal truths that undergird or form the origins, beginnings\n(archai) of the world of ordinary experience are the three\nhypostases or realities of soul, intellect, and the One. The hypostases\nare necessary, above all, to account for our experience of degrees of\nunity and organization. The life-world accessible to our senses\nis an organized, animated world, and this needs a more intensive degree\nof unity to account for it, namely, the principle of life, that is,\nsoul and all souls. But even the world of soul is a “one and\nmany”, organized from within yet also requiring a principle of\nunity and organization beyond itself. And the same is true even to a\nhigher degree of intellect. Intellect is a “one-many”, an\norganized world of intellects, in each of which the whole of intellect\nis present. Each is a sort of holographic reality. And because\nintellect is still a world despite its more intensive unity than soul,\nit requires a unity beyond intellect and beyond being to organize it\nand to form the groundless ground of its own being from which it has\nemerged. \n\nSo (1) in Neoplatonism, there are 3 hypostases, on the one hand,\nnamely, soul, intellect, and the One, and four cosmic or hypercosmic\ndimensions, on the other: (i) the sensible world as a world of things;\n(ii) the sensible world linked by the soul to the intelligible world;\n(iii) the intelligible world itself composed of all intellects; and\nfinally (iv) the One or the Good, from which everything has come. And\n(2) while everything has its appropriate “place” in this\nhypostatic hierarchy, the presence of the Good is so immediate and so\naccessible, that the presence is closer to each thing even than\nintellect or soul. This is equally true in both Plotinus and Proclus.\nFurthermore, (3) in order to explicate the derivation of each entity\nfrom what comes before it, it is not sufficient as some scholars have\nsupposed that Neoplatonism should just have multiplied intermediaries\nand indulged in an absurd proclivity for triads, such as Life, Wisdom,\nMind; Neoplatonism should rather be seen as a form of thought that\nattempts to meditate upon, read the signs in, and represent how, as\nprecisely as possible, all beings are derived from and relate to the\nOne, to examine and explicate their dependence, open-endedness,\nand radical interconnectedness without losing sight of the\nmultidimensional ordering of the universe (sensible/intelligible) and\nof the fact that even the simplicity of things that have no intellect\nor life, but only bare existence, springs from the power of the\nOne. \n\nWhat Dionysius manages to do is both to capture this spirit\nprofoundly, and, therefore, transform it, as well as to make it\nconcrete and accessible in the scriptural, sacramental, and ordinary\nexperiences of Christian practitioners. Instead of the 4 dimensions of\nthe Neoplatonic universe, Dionysius has the following: (1) the sensible\nworld or Legal hierarchy, i.e., the world considered under the aspect\neither of objective “thinginess” or of law, namely, in the\ncase of law, a world in which we are dependent upon prescriptions\nrather than upon any deeper understanding, a world in which the\n“mysteries” or hidden things (such as Baptism and the\nEucharist) are mere mechanical ceremonies and the Scriptures are given\nonly a literal meaning. For Dionysius (as for Plato), law is necessary,\nbut still deficient. The law of Moses, for instance, “gave only a\nveiled contemplation as to enlighten without harm weak capacities for\nsight” (EH 501c). Then (2) there follows the\necclesiastical hierarchy, namely, the sensible world as the limbs of\nthe mystical body of Christ led by soul into the significance of the\nintelligible or celestial hierarchy, where the symbols can begin to be\nread. Its mysteries, both sensible and intelligible, are the Scriptures\nand the Sacraments, its initiators the priests, and its initiated the\nones who receive them. From this perspective, Dionysius transforms\nNeoplatonism radically but at the same time provokes entirely new\npossibilities in the structures he transforms. \n\nWhat is the general character of Dionysius’ writing and is there\nanything philosophical in it? Dionysius presents us with complex\naffirmative (kataphatic) and negative (apophatic)\nforms of theology, exploring what we can say about God, what we mean by\nour statements, discovering the necessity for us to talk too much about\nGod and to push language forms to their breaking points, and then to\nsee what we cannot say about God. Negation is important here at both\nlevels, in kataphatic theology as well as in\napophatic theology. This complex theory of signification and\nits subversion is often referred to as negative theology: affirming our\naffirmations, then negating them, and then negating the negations to\nensure that we do not make an idol out of a God about whom we know\nnothing. But it is also much more than this. \n\nDionysius is practising forms of theological meditation in\nthe sense that the earlier Church Fathers had understood this, not as a\ntype of objectified, academic knowledge, but rather as a more complex,\nintersubjective form of address, communion and contemplation. Dionysius\nadopts the word theurgy, “god-work”, together with\ntheology, “god-word”, to describe the inmost reality\nof this practice, adopting it from the later Neoplatonist understanding\nof a hidden sympathy or interconnectedness between material things and\nthe sacred, divine significances resident in them by virtue of divine\npower. Iamblichus, for instance, had denied that pure thought or\ncontemplation could bring about union with the divine. What was crucial\nwas the performance of certain ritual actions or theurgy,\n“god-work”, in the belief that one could attain to\nthe divine by the incarnation of divine forces in material objects,\nstatues, or human beings through the divine power mirrored everywhere\nin the universe and in the natural sympathy of all parts, and not just\nby talking about the gods (theo-logy) or by looking at\nthem (theoria). For some modern critics, Dionysius’ adaptation\nof pagan theurgy is analogous to calling the Christian sacraments\n“magical”, which also results in the subsumption of\neverything (morality as well as contemplation) to a form of magical\ncorrespondence. But Dionysius does not understand theurgy in this way.\nFor him, “theurgy is the consummation (sygkephalaiosis)\nof theology” (EH 432B), which is to say that God’s activity\nwithin all the orders of nature does not abolish nature, morality,\ncontemplation, or science but rather completes them and makes possible\nthe divinization of human nature. \n\nGod’s work in all things, therefore, turns the world into a\nreservoir of possibilities: at its lowest and most fragmented, it is\napparently a world of only individual, discrete things without\nsignificance, but in reality it is a world vested with signs, symbols,\nand hidden meanings as the multidimensional creation of a Triadic God.\nEven the lowest things cannot simply be despised, for even in their\ndissimilarity from the divine, they bear the capacity to signify the\ndivine more appropriately than supposedly worthier images. If we say\nGod is good, we run the risk of thinking we know entirely what we mean\nand consequently of closing off a thought that has to be radically\nopen-ended, if not altogether subverted. If we liken God to a\n“worm”, we subvert our own comfortable tendencies by being\nshocked into filling the image with enquiry. So the Psalmist who uses\nthe worm image hides the sacred from those who would defile it\nwith a lack of understanding and yet points to the sacred in a\nnew way. This constant tension or dialectic between hiddenness and\nopenness pervades the whole of Dionysius’ meditative practice of\ntheology; and from this perspective Dionysius’ practice of writing is a\ncomplex and necessarily deceptive or subversive process of reading the\nencoded insight (or contemplation) in created things in such a way that\nneither the perceptual beauty of the material thing nor the deeper\nhidden beauty of the sign becomes a trap, an idol, or a vanishing point\nbut, instead, an activity that opens up an irresistibly beautiful world\nin and to God. \n\nThere are several consequences of this. First, Dionysius’ writing is\na response, a preparing of the organs of reception for the love of God\nin praise and worship. In theology, we are learning how to praise, to\nhymn—not to catalogue—God. Second, such\nwriting is dialogic and intersubjective to its core in three ways: a)\nAs “in between” teacher and pupil, dialogical receptivity\nand transmission, open-ended in both directions, characterize its\nessential form; b) Even in the content of Dionysius’\nvarious works, replete as they are with triads (which can so easily be\nrelegated to a Neoplatonic obscure penchant for providing intermediate\nlinks), this open-ended in-betweenness, characteristic of\nconversation and cooperation, is fundamental to the ranks of the\nvarious hierarchies. In the EH, for instance, in the triad\ncatechumen (the one undergoing purification), sponsor or confirmed\nChristian (the one being illumined), and hierarch (the one being\nperfected and enlightening) (according to the traditional triadic form:\npurification—illumination—perfection), the sponsor\nfirst introduces the catechumen and both sponsor and catechumen are\nthen mediated by the work of the hierarch. For Dionysius at least (if\nnot in the actual operation of a “church”), hierarchy is\nhere not a question of domination, but rather of a genuine\nopen-endedness, testability through interlocutor and mediator,\ncommunity and responsibility. c) Finally, what completes both the form\nand the content above all is prayer, since, for Dionysius (as\nfor Anselm much later), prayer is the primary form of reverential\nphilosophical thought and receptivity, “stretching ourselves\nout”, as in Gregory of Nyssa, so as to be “lifted up”\n(cf. DN 3). The most famous example of such prayer is the very\nbeginning of the MT, where in the address/request\n“Triad, above substance, above god, above good” to\n“make our way straight to the topmost peak, beyond knowing and\nlight, of the mystical scriptures—there where the simple,\nabsolute and unchangeable, mysteries of God’s speaking lie wrapped in\nthe darkness beyond light of secret—hidden silence”,\nTimotheus, the disciple is also included, together with us the\nreaders. \n\nAll of this looks so alien to the spirit of modern philosophy that\nwe may well ask if there is anything really philosophical in Dionysius’\npractice? The answer has to be affirmative, for there is a perfectly\nreasonable pattern to the whole of Dionysius’ works. In addition,\nDionysius regards his own task as a kind of demonstration\n(apodeixis) or showing (deixai). In the Divine\nNames, such demonstration is given a Pauline resonance when\nDionysius states that we should hold to the scriptural revelation of\ndivine names “not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in\ndemonstration of the power granted by the Spirit” (DN\n585b; cf. Paul 1 Cor 2–4). In other words, Dionysius here sees\nscripture as providing the basis for a deeper understanding of\nattribution or predication that will lead us beyond our own merely\nhuman capacities. That such a demonstration involves the unpacking of\nthe symbolic, contemplative, and mystical significances of ordinary\nthings by the aid of scriptural testimony is clear in the\nEcclesiastical Hierarchy, which again starts from Dionysius’\npurpose of demonstrating what the hierarchy comprises; and that this\nincludes arguments, reasons, the possibility of debate and even\nimprovement upon Dionysius’ demonstrations by his interlocutor becomes\nclear too at the end of the work, when the literary humility that is\ncharacteristic of his writing (cf. EH 568a ff.; DN\n981c–984a; CH 340b) shows itself to be philosophically\njustified by Dionysius’ ability to set out both sides of the case for\nand against infant baptism in the understanding that he may not fully\nbe in possession of the most complete view of the situation and that\nhis interlocutor should “use” what he has said “as\nsteps (epanabathmois) to a higher ray of light”\n(EH 568d–569a). This is a thought couched in terms very\nreminiscent of Socrates’ wish in the Republic to subvert or\ndestroy hypotheses and use them as stepping stones to something better,\nand it is also a thought not unworthy of Wittgenstein’s similar view at\nthe end of the Tractatus. The words immediately following make\nclear the connection between charity of interpretation,\nopen-endedness and demonstration: “Be generous with me\nthen, my dear friend,… and show (deixon) to my eyes\nthat more beautiful and unified beauty which you may be able to\nsee”. Demonstration in this sense, then, includes much of what we\nmight consider to be properly philosophical, but at root it is also a\nform of “divine reading” (lectio divina, or\nmeditative, prayerful reading) of nature and word, a receptive\nrecognition as a kind of method or making one’s way “to hear the\nsacred words as receptively as possible, to be open to the divine\nworkings of God, to clear an uplifting path (hodopoiesis)\ntoward that inheritance that awaits us in heaven, and to accept our\nmost divine and sacred regeneration” (EH 392a). \n\nIn sum, Dionysius represents the instantaneous resonances, possible\nin unusual circumstances, between forms of thought and practice that\nmay at first sight appear entirely divergent. He is therefore in some\nrespects a dangerous thinker, yet at the same time a forger of new\npossibilities: \n\nFor the long commentary tradition, from John of Scythopolis to Aquinas\nand Ficino, see bibliography 2 below. St. Gregory the Great refers to\nDionysius in his own commentary on the angels and probably had the\ncomplete works at Rome. But the study of Dionysius did not take off in\nthe Latin West until the Byzantine emperor Michael the Stammerer sent\na copy of the Dionysian corpus as a gift to the Frankish king Louis\nthe Pious in 827. This copy served as the source of the first\ntranslations of Dionysius into Latin. The first translation, made\naround 838 by Hilduin, abbot of a monastery near Paris (who identified\nDionysius not only as St. Dionysius the Areopagite but also as the\nfirst bishop of Paris), was so unintelligible that Charles II asked\nthe great Irish philosopher, John Scottus Eriugena, to make a new\ntranslation that he completed in 862 and that was subsequently revised\nwith clarifications in 875. The influence of Dionysius is profound in\nEriugena’s own thought as it would be later in the Franciscan\ntradition (especially Grosseteste and Bonaventure) and also to a\nlesser extent in the Dominican (both Albert and Aquinas wrote\ncommentaries). In fact, the abiding-procession-return triad may be\nsaid to form the essential structure of Aquinas’ unfinished\nmasterpiece, the Summa Theologica. The influence of\nDionysius’ ideas pervades not only the Italian and English\nRenaissance, but also the Rhineland mystical writers, such as Meister\nEckhart (d. 1327), Tauler (d. 1361), Ruysbroeck (d. 1381), Gerson\n(d. 1429), and later Denis the Carthusian (d. 1471) and Nicholas of\nCusa (d. 1464) (whose work On Learned Ignorance owes a debt\nto Dionysius’ agnosia or unknowingness, as does also the\nanonymous author of the Cloud of Unknowing) and the great\nSpanish mystics, for example, St. John of the Cross (d. 1591). In the\nGreek East, Dionysius’ On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy\ninspired a series of liturgical commentaries, beginning with\nthe Mystagogy of Maximus the Confessor (d. 662) and\ncontinuing with works by Germanus of Constantinople (d. 733) and\nNicholas Cabasilas (d. 1390). Dionysius played a major role in the\nPalamite controversy of the 14th century, cited both by Gregory\nPalamas (d. 1359) and by his opponents. In the modern world, Dionysius\nhas received less attention, though he is of some importance for 19th\ncentury German Idealist thought and also to a lesser extent for\nEnglish and American Romanticism. In the so-called\n“postmodern” world, however, two thinkers who have written\nabout Dionysius with great insight are Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques\nDerrida. Derrida, in particular, has been one of the few contemporary\nphilosophical thinkers, if not the only one, to realize the importance\nof Dionysius in relation to deconstruction (a term he does not use\nhimself) and to explore the complex nature of prayer, address, and\ndenial in the context of the necessarily deceptive and open-ended\npossibilities of negative theology.","contact.mail":"kcorrig@emory.edu","contact.domain":"emory.edu"},{"date.published":"2004-09-06","date.changed":"2019-04-30","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/","author1":"Kevin Corrigan","author1.info":"http://www.emory.edu/COLLEGE/ILA/faculty/corrigan.html","author2.info":"http://www.duq.edu/academics/faculty/michael-harrington","entry":"pseudo-dionysius-areopagite","body.text":"\n\n\n\nDionysius, or Pseudo-Dionysius, as he has come to be known in the\ncontemporary world, was a Christian Neoplatonist who wrote in the late\nfifth or early sixth century CE and who transposed in a thoroughly\noriginal way the whole of Pagan Neoplatonism from Plotinus to Proclus,\nbut especially that of Proclus and the Platonic Academy in Athens, into\na distinctively new Christian context. \n\n\nThough Pseudo-Dionysius lived in the late fifth and early sixth\ncentury C.E., his works were written as if they were composed by\nSt. Dionysius the Areopagite, who was a member of the Athenian\njudicial council (known as ‘the Areopagus’) in the 1st\ncentury C.E. and who was converted by St. Paul. Thus, these works\nmight be regarded as a successful ‘forgery’, providing\nPseudo-Dionysius with impeccable Christian credentials that\nconveniently antedated Plotinus by close to two hundred years.  So\nsuccessful was this stratagem that Dionysius acquired almost apostolic\nauthority, giving his writings enormous influence in the Middle Ages\nand the Renaissance, though his views on the Trinity and Christ (e.g.,\nhis emphasis upon the single theandric activity of Christ\n(see Letter 4) as opposed to the later orthodox view of two\nactivities) were not always accepted as orthodox since they required\nrepeated defenses, for example, by John of Scythopolis and by Maximus\nConfessor. Dionysius’ fictitious identity, doubted already in the\nsixth century by Hypatius of Ephesus and later by Nicholas of Cusa,\nwas first seriously called into question by Lorenzo Valla in 1457 and\nJohn Grocyn in 1501, a critical viewpoint later accepted and\npublicized by Erasmus from 1504 onward. But it has only become\ngenerally accepted in modern times that instead of being the disciple\nof St. Paul, Dionysius must have lived in the time of Proclus, most\nprobably being a pupil of Proclus, perhaps of Syrian origin, who knew\nenough of Platonism and the Christian tradition to transform them\nboth. Since Proclus died in 485 CE, and since the first clear citation\nof Dionysius’ works is by Severus of Antioch between 518 and 528, then\nwe can place Dionysius’ authorship between 485 and 518–28\nCE. These dates are confirmed by what we find in the Dionysian corpus:\na knowledge of Athenian Neoplatonism of the time, an appeal to\ndoctrinal formulas and parts of the Christian liturgy (e.g., the\nCreed) current in the late fifth century, and an adaptation of late\nfifth-century Neoplatonic religious rites, particularly theurgy, as we\nshall see below. \n\nIt must also be recognized that “forgery” is a modern\nnotion. Like Plotinus and the Cappadocians before him, Dionysius does\nnot claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a\ntradition.  Adopting the persona of an ancient figure was a long\nestablished rhetorical device (known as declamatio), and\nothers in Dionysius’ circle also adopted pseudonymous names from\nthe New Testament. Dionysius’ works, therefore, are much less a\nforgery in the modern sense than an acknowledgement of reception and\ntransmission, namely, a kind of coded recognition that the resonances\nof any sacred undertaking are intertextual, bringing the diachronic\nstructures of time and space together in a synchronic way, and that\nthis theological teaching, at least, is dialectically received from\nanother. Dionysius represents his own teaching as coming from a\ncertain Hierotheus and as being addressed to a certain Timotheus. He\nseems to conceive of himself, therefore, as an in-between figure, very\nlike a Dionysius the Areopagite, in fact. Finally, if Iamblichus and\nProclus can point to a primordial, pre-Platonic wisdom, namely, that\nof Pythagoras, and if Plotinus himself can claim not to be an\noriginator of a tradition (after all, the term Neoplatonism is just a\nconvenient modern tag), then why cannot Dionysius point to a\ndistinctly Christian theological and philosophical resonance in an\nearlier pre-Plotinian wisdom that instantaneously bridged the gap\nbetween Judaeo-Christianity (St. Paul) and Athenian paganism (the\nAreopagite)? [For a different view of Dionysius as crypto-pagan, see\nLankila, 2011, 14–40.]  \n\nReading Dionysius can be a difficult business for many reasons:\npartly because his frequent hyperbolic theological language is foreign\nto our own English-speaking practices; partly because almost\nevery word he employs resonates with the whole history of ancient\nthought, from the Christian Platonism of the Fathers, particularly,\nGregory of Nyssa and the Cappadocians, to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus,\nIamblichus, and Proclus, while his theology focuses predominantly upon\nthe Jewish and Christian scriptures (which Dionysius calls\n“divine oracles”); partly, again, because the order in\nwhich we are to read his works is unclear and because Dionysius\nmentions at least seven works that have been lost. So we are unsure how\nto read him since so much seems doubtful or potentially fictitious.\nThis picture is further complicated by the titles subdividing portions\nof his works, which appear, because of terminology peculiar to them, to\nhave been inserted by a later hand or hands. \n\nThe surviving writings are four treatises and ten letters. The four\ntreatises are: 1) On the divine names (DN) (Peri\ntheion onomaton, in Greek; De Divinis Nominibus, in\nLatin), the longest work of thirteen chapters that deals with\naffirmative or kataphatic theology, namely, the names attributed to God\nthe creator in scripture and also in pagan texts, but also exploring\nthe limits of language and therefore also involving negative or\napophatic theology. 2) On the celestial hierarchy\n(CH) (Peri tes ouranias hierarchias, in Greek; De\ncoelesti hierarchia, in Latin), a work that examines how the nine\nchoirs of angels (in scripture) are to be understood in lifting us up\nto God. 3) On the ecclesiastical hierarchy (EH)\n(Peri tes ekklestiastikes hierarchias, in Greek; De\necclesiastica hierarchia, in Latin) that examines the various\norders and liturgy of the church as relating us to God through a\ndivinely appointed but human hierarchy. And 4) On Mystical\ntheology (MT) (Peri mustikes theologias, in\nGreek; De mystica theologia, in Latin), a brief but powerful\nwork that deals with negative or apophatic theology and in which\ntheology becomes explicitly “mystical” for the first time\nin history (By mystical here we do not mean an extraordinary or private\nexperience of transcending one’s self in the modern sense of the term,\nbut simply “hidden”. On this see Bouyer, 1949; Vanneste,\n1959; McGinn 1994). There follow ten letters that provide helpful\ncomments upon topics in the above four treatises, especially letter 9\non what Dionysius calls symbolic theology of which works 2) and 3)\nabove (CH; EH) form a substantial part. The ten\nletters appear to be arranged in a roughly hierarchical order, letters\n1–4 being addressed to a monk (a certain Gaius, also the name of\none or more of St. Paul’s companions), letter 5 to a deacon, letter 6\nto a priest, and letters 7 and 9 to hierarchs or bishops. Letter 8\ndisrupts this order since it is addressed to a monk charged with\ndisrupting the hierarchical order itself! \n\nWhat order of the works are we to adopt? In the French translation\nof M. de Gandillac and the English translation of C. Luibheid and P.\nRorem (see bibliography), the order is DN, MT,\nCH and EH. In the manuscripts of the Areopagitic\ncorpus, the order is CH, EH, DN,\nMT, followed by the Letters. Dionysius himself provides an\nexplanatory outline that favors the order of Luibheid and Rorem, and\nthat gives a systematic organization to his body of work, including\nboth the treatises we presently possess and also the treatises which\neither no longer exist or, more likely, were never written. His outline\nis especially valuable for two of these latter treatises—the\nTheological Representations and the Symbolic\nTheology—since the order in which he claims to have written\nthem reveals both the relative worth of their contents and the\nsequence in which the reader should proceed. It thus helps the reader\nto divine the nature of their content, and to put them in their proper\nplace with the remaining two works written by Dionysius on the forms\nof theology. The first three—the Theological\nRepresentations, On the Divine Names, and\nthe Symbolic Theology—discuss ever more divided and\nsensuous forms of theology. The fourth theological work,\nthe Mystical Theology, reverses the sequence and restores the\nreader to the divine unity: \n\nIn this article we shall adopt a variant of this last order both\nbecause Dionysius himself seems to have favored it and because it\nclarifies the systematic structure of the theological works.  \n\nAlthough the Theological Representations is not extant, we\nare able to glean its content from Dionysius’ ample descriptions of it\nin his other works. It seems to have devoted itself to names for the\nthree persons within the godhead and their attributes. These names are\nthe representations mentioned in the work’s title. They describe two\nforms of differentiation within the godhead: the distinction into\npersons, and into attributes of the persons. Names for the persons\ninclude “Father,” “Son,” and “Holy\nSpirit.” Names for the attributes include “source,”\n“offshoot,” “flower,” and “light.”\nDionysius does not explain why he uses the term\n“representation” (hypotuposis) for these names,\nbut his fondness for puns may have led him to adopt it because of its\nsimilarity to “person” (hypostasis). \n\nSome of these names describe more than a person within the godhead.\nThe name “father,” for instance, may also be used of\nanimals, in which case it means the male parent. We seem to apply such\nnames literally to animals and only metaphorically to persons within\nthe godhead. But Dionysius uncovers a passage from Paul’s letter to the\nEphesians which leads him to claim otherwise. Paul says that God the\nFather is the one “from whom all fatherhood in the heavens and on\nearth is named.” On the basis of this scriptural authority,\nDionysius explains that we are able to use the terms\n“father” and “son” of animals only because the\ngodhead has already undergone the same relation. In other words, the\ninternal causality exercised within the godhead is the source of all\nother causality. This includes not only the causation of one animal by\nanother, but of one angel by another, since angels, too, receive the\nnames of “father” and “son.” \n\nStrictly speaking, all of the theological works except for the\nTheological Representations devote themselves to divine names\nor names for the godhead. But Dionysius devotes his second theological\ntreatise, entitled On the Divine Names only to a particular\nkind of divine name. This kind of name describes a third distinction\nwithin the godhead (in addition to the distinction of persons and of\npersonal attributes): the distinction into the multiple attributes of\nthe godhead as a whole. Though the names apply to the godhead as a\nwhole, and so refer to it as a unity, each name is different and so,\ntaken together, they differentiate the godhead. The implicit\ndistinction between the unity of the godhead and the multiplicity of\nthe names is reflected in the very structure of the names\nthemselves. Each name includes the same prefix: “over-”,\nor\nhyper- in Greek, which indicates the unity of the\ngodhead to whom the names are applied. But each name is different,\nindicating the self-multiplication of the godhead. The result is\na set of names like “over-good,”\n“over-being,” and “over-life.”\nOccasionally, Dionysius also makes use of a second, equivalent prefix:\n“pre-” or pro- in Greek. God is\n“pre-good,” and “pre-being,”\nmeaning that he has the attributes of creatures in a way that\ntranscends both creature and attribute. The “over-”\nand “pre-” prefixes must be applied strictly to the\nnames when they are used of God in himself. On the other hand, when the\nnames are used only of God as cause, the prefixes may be left off,\nsince the causality of God is already a procession into the\ndifferentiation properly signified by each of the different names. \n\nSome of Dionysius’ later medieval interpreters suggest that God\npossesses the attributes of creatures in their most proper and ideal\nform, but Dionysius himself does not suggest this. Instead, the most\nproper object of the names is the highest creature. The exemplary\ninstances of “goodness,” “being,” and\n“life,” for example, are the highest of the angels or\nintelligible minds, as Dionysius also calls them. For this reason,\nDionysius frequently refers to this type of name as an\n“intelligible name.” He incorporates into the number of\nintelligible names the traditional Neoplatonic intelligible categories:\nbeing, identity, difference, rest, and motion, as well as the\nNeoplatonic triad of being, life, and intellect. The fact that God\ntranscends the proper meaning of these names does not mean that he\nought to be called “non-being,”\n“non-life,” or “non-intellect.”\nDionysius prefers simply to say that God is “over being,”\n“over life,” and “over intellect.” \n\nThe intelligible names could form the ground of a theology\nindependent of any specific religious tradition or sacred text. Many of\nthem are central to Platonic sources outside the context of\nChristianity, and appear only incidentally and obscurely in the Hebrew\nand Christian scriptures. They also describe the intelligible structure\nof the cosmos, a structure that is accessible to all human inquiry,\nwhether assisted by scriptural texts or not. But Dionysius explicitly\ndenies that the names may be acquired from any source other than the\nHebrew and Christian scriptures. Even if the names could be derived\nfrom contemplation of the world’s intelligible structure, we apply them\nin theology to the cause of that structure and not to the structure\nitself. Since the cause of that structure is beyond the grasp of human\ninquiry, we cannot rely on our own powers for our description. We\ndepend instead on the revelation of the scriptures as our source for\nthe intelligible names. \n\nFew human beings have the ability to contemplate the intelligible\nnames in their purity. Most of us require the names to be incarnated in\nvisible things before we can understand them. Unable to see\n“being,” “life,” and “wisdom” in\nthemselves, we need a visible being who is living and wise. Such a\nperson can then become the means by which we contemplate the\nintelligible. Dionysius’ possibly fictional teacher Hierotheus is one\nsuch visible incarnation of the names. But Hierotheus may do more than\nincarnate the names. He can also unfold them in speech, taking the\nunitary name of “being” and describing it at length, as\nDionysius does in the fifth chapter of On the Divine Names. As\nhe describes it, the name unfolds itself into a form that is more\nmultiple, because of the many words used in his description. It thus\napproaches the multiple character of our ordinary human way of knowing,\nand becomes more easily understood. \n\nOther names directly refer to visible things, whose multiplicity and\naccessibility to sensation make them easy for us to understand. The\ndifficulty with these names, referred to by Dionysius and the\nNeoplatonic tradition generally as “symbols,” is that they\nhave no inherent relation to the godhead at all. Their literal\nsignification is restricted to the realm of the sensuous, and so they\nmust be turned into metaphors if they are to become useful for\ntheology. This is the task of Dionysius’ Symbolic Theology.\nThough the work itself is not extant, we find him undertaking the same\nproject in each of his extant works. \n\nOne of Dionysius’ favorite sources of symbols is a verse from the\n78th psalm: “the Lord awoke, like a strong man,\npowerful but reeling with wine.” Taken literally, the verse\nindicates that God sleeps and gets drunk on wine, two activities that\nproperly apply only to embodied, visible beings. Only an embodied being\ncan manifest the activities to which the names “sleep” and\n“drunkenness” literally refer. If we are to apply such\nterms to God, they must be attached to a foreign, intelligible content\nthat will be able to lead the interpreter of the symbolic name to the\ncontemplation of an intelligible name. In “sleep,” for\nexample, Dionysius finds a meaning common to both intelligible and\nvisible things: withdrawal from the world. He concludes that God’s\nsleep is his “removal from and lack of communication with the\nobjects of his providence.” In drunkenness, Dionysius sees a kind\nof over-filling, and so he explains that God’s drunkenness is\n“the overloaded measurelessness of all goods in the one who is\ntheir cause.” From the easily comprehended literal meaning of the\nterm, the reader rises to the more difficult intelligible terrain of\nimparticipability and measurelessness. \n\nDrunkenness and sleep are what Dionysius calls “dissimilar\nsimilarities.” They strike us as exceptionally unworthy of God,\nand so are “dissimilar,” yet they reveal an intelligible\ntruth capable of leading us to him, and so are “similar.”\nDionysius privileges such names over more appropriate names like\n“golden” and “luminous.” The more that the name\nseems appropriate, the more we are likely to be lulled into thinking\nthat we have adequately comprehended the godhead in our use of the\nname. The very materiality and ignobility of the dissimilar\nsimilarities cry out that the names do not literally describe the\ngodhead, and compel the reader to seek the intelligible truth behind\nthe name. \n\nWe may wonder whether the symbolic names are a necessary part of\ntheology at all, since their content belongs to the intelligible\ntheology and not to a “symbolic” theology. Dionysius\nrepeatedly affirms their necessity, not because of the character of\ntheir content, but because of the nature of the human soul. The soul\nmay be divided into two parts: one passionate and the other\npassionless. Passionate here means set in motion by things exterior to\nthe soul. The senses, for example, are passionate because they can\nonly function when an outside object gives them something to\nsense. Dionysius follows a longstanding Neoplatonic tradition when he\nsays that most of us are unable to engage our passionless part\ndirectly. Instead, our passionless part comes into play only\nindirectly, through the activity of the passionate part. By sensing\nthe world around us, we are led to contemplate its intelligible\nstructures through the sensations we receive. Even those few human\nbeings who can engage their passionless part directly find it helpful\nto shore up their contemplation with examples drawn from the senses.\nDionysius may understand the causality of God directly, and yet still\nfind it helpful to compare God’s causality to the emanation of light\nfrom the sun. \n\nSuch examples do not require the presence of a revealed scripture.\nSkilled teachers in any subject are characterized by their ability to\ncome up with helpful examples drawn from ordinary experience when\nexplaining a difficult intelligible truth. Dionysius himself frequently\nresorts to examples “at our level” in order to explain\nsomething intelligible. The scriptural symbol goes further, attempting\nto reveal the God who is before and beyond even the intelligible truth.\nThe highest human intellect has little ability to attain this truth\ndirectly, and so we cannot rely on intellectual teachers as guides to\nthat truth. We require the gift of symbols, which tie our ordinary\ncomprehension to the godhead beyond being. And so Dionysius does not\ndescribe the symbolic names as pedagogical tools developed by\ntheologians. The names appear instead in the ecstatic visions of the\nprophets. Though Dionysius explicitly asserts our dependence on the\nHebrew and Christian scriptures as the source of these symbols, he has\nno qualms about embellishing the list of names with symbols drawn from\nother traditions. For instance, he discusses at length the name of\n“mixing bowl,” which has no real source in the Christian or\nHebrew scriptures, but occurs centrally in the Platonic philosophy\nderiving from Plato’s Timaeus. \n\nWhen Dionysius praises “dissimilar similarities” over\nseemingly more appropriate symbolic names for God, he explains that at\nleast some dissimilar names are negations, and negations are more\nproper to God than affirmations. The Mystical Theology has\nthis last, most arcane form of theology as its subject. Negations are\nproperly applied not only to the names of the symbolic theology. Any\nand all of the divine names must be negated, beginning with those of\nthe symbolic theology, continuing with the intelligible names and\nconcluding with the theological representations. The godhead is no\nmore “spirit,” “sonship,” and\n“fatherhood” than it is “intellect” or\n“asleep.” These negations must be distinguished from\nprivations. A privation is simply the absence of a given predicate\nthat could just as easily be present. The absence of the predicate is\nopposed to its presence: “lifeless” is opposed to\n“living.” But when we say that the godhead is not\n“living,” we do not mean that it is\n“lifeless.” The godhead is beyond the lifeless as well as\nbeyond the living. For this reason, Dionysius says that our\naffirmations of the godhead are not opposed to our negations, but that\nboth must be transcended: even the negations must be negated. \n\nThe most controversial and arcane passages of the Mystical\nTheology revolve around the mystical as taken in itself and not as\nthe act of negating the other forms of theology. Dionysius says that\nafter all speaking, reading, and comprehending of the names ceases,\nthere follows a divine silence, darkness, and unknowing. All three of\nthese characteristics seem privative, as though they were simply being\nthe absence of speech, sight, and knowledge respectively. But Dionysius\ndoes not treat them as privative. Instead, he uses temporal and spatial\nlanguage to mark off a special place and time for them. Using as his\nexample the account of Moses’ ascent up Mount Sinai in the Hebrew\nscriptures, Dionysius says that after Moses ascends through the\nsensible and intelligible contemplation of God, he then enters the\ndarkness above the mountain’s peak. The darkness is located above the\nmountain, and Moses enters it after his contemplation of God in the\nvarious forms of theology. Dionysius leaves the relation between Moses\nand the darkness highly obscure. Some commentators reduce it to a form\nof knowing, albeit an extraordinary form of knowing. Others reduce it\nto a form of affective experience, in which Moses feels something that\nhe can never know or explain in words. Dionysius himself does not give\ndecisive evidence in favor of either interpretive move. He speaks only\nof Moses’ “union” with the ineffable, invisible, unknowable\ngodhead. \n\nPerhaps even more vexing than the nature of union in Dionysius is\nthe question of how the theological treatises relate to Dionysius’ two\ntreatises on hierarchy. The Mystical Theology suggests an\nascent from the lower sensuous realm of reality through the\nintelligible intermediate realm to the darkness of the godhead itself,\nall accomplished by a single person. The hierarchic treatises, on the\nother hand, suggest that the sensible and intelligible realms are not\nplaces reached by a single being, but different kinds of beings, and\nthat the vision of God is handed from being to being downward through\nthe levels of the hierarchy. On the Celestial Hierarchy\ndescribes the intelligible realm as divided into nine ranks of beings:\nthe seraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, powers, authorities,\nprincipalities, archangels, and angels. On the Ecclesiastical\nHierarchy describes the human beings within the church as divided\ninto eight ranks: the hierarchs or bishops, priests, deacons, monks,\nlaity, catechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed. Dionysius\ndoes not address human life outside the church, except for a few\nscattered references to the angels presiding over other religious\ntraditions and the earlier “legal hierarchy” of the Jewish\nrite, which precedes the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Christian\nrite. \n\nThe hierarchs, highest within the human hierarchy, contemplate the\nintelligible realm directly, though presumably they contemplate only\nits lowest level: the angels. The visible result of the hierarchs’\ncontemplation of the angels is the series of rites belonging to the\nChristian church. Since the hierarchs are able to contemplate the\nintelligible directly, they do not perform the rites for their own\nsake, but for the sake of the monks and laity, who have no capacity for\ndirect intelligible contemplation. The monks and laity are able to\nengage the passionless part of their souls only through the passionate\npart, and so they require a visible trigger—the symbol—to \nstimulate their intelligible contemplation. The ranks of hierarch,\npriest, and deacon are in charge of administering the rites, with a\nspecific set of initiates in their care and a specific action to\nperform. The deacons purify the catechumens, penitents, and possessed,\nprimarily by giving them ethical instruction. The priests illuminate\nthe laity, who are able to receive the intelligible truth. The\nhierarchs perfect, a task whose initiate seems ideally to be the monk,\nsince Dionysius identifies the monks as leading the more perfect life\nof those who are not explicitly consecrated as clergy. \n\nThe very structure of the church reflects the different roles of the\nclergy and the laity. The hierarch stands still at the altar, facing\naway from the multiplicity of the church’s interior. He enters the nave\nof the church only to bring sacred objects like incense, bread and\nwine, and holy oil into the realm of multiplicity, the spatially\nextended nave. When he brings the censer into the nave, for example,\nits fragrance is distributed to the laity there, just as the bread and\nwine are later distributed in the eucharistic rite. The hierarch then\nreturns to the altar, and takes up again his own proper object of\ncontemplation, the intelligible source of the rites. The laity, on the\nother hand, remain within the spatially extended nave, but orient\nthemselves toward the altar, where the sacred objects are raised for\ntheir contemplation. Before this contemplation can occur, the\ncatechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed must be removed\nfrom the church. Their orientation toward the material prevents them\nfrom adequately contemplating the intelligible truth through its\nvisible manifestation in the sacred objects. \n\nAlthough the rites have intelligible contemplation as their goal, it\ndoes not appear that non-ritual forms of contemplation, like\nreading, can substitute for participation in the rites. Dionysian\ncontemplation is public, so that it may unite us to each other; it\ninvolves prayer, so that it may unite us explicitly with the godhead;\nit also requires bodies, since only the interaction of bodies allows\nthe contemplative act to include both components of our nature: body\nand soul. The names used in Dionysius’ theological treatises acquire\ntheir salvific power in this liturgical context. Although the rites\ninvolve the performance of bodily actions, they clothe themselves in\nwords: the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, and the oral tradition of\nthe liturgical prayers. Only the silence and unknowing of the\nMystical Theology finds no clear place within the liturgical\nrites of the hierarchy, since it transcends both the visible rites of\nthe laity and the intelligible contemplation of the clergy. It may be\nthat, just as some points of the liturgy call for a literal silence,\nthe intelligible contemplation of the hierarch at the altar must engage\nin its own form of silence, so as to allow the appearance of the\ngodhead beyond naming. On this question, however, Dionysius is as\nsilent as the mystical theology which crowns his vision of the human\nascent to God. \n\nHaving examined the plan and content of these works let us now take\na brief look at some of the sources of Dionysius’ ideas (and associated\nproblems), and at the character of Dionysius’ writing in order to\ndetermine what in practice he is actually doing and to see if there is\nanything genuinely philosophical in his writing. \n\nThere is a major tension between Platonism and Christianity in\nDionysius’ writing. Luther expressed the negative side of this tension:\n“Dionysius is most pernicious; he platonizes more than he\nChristianizes” (Babylonian Captivity of the Church\n(Weimarer Ausgabe 6, 562)). Von Balthasar has been more\npositive, seeing Dionysius’ Christianization of Neoplatonism “as\na side-effect of his own properly theological endeavor”,\nnamely, “the clear realized synthesis of truth and beauty, of\ntheology and aesthetics” (The Glory of the Lord, vol. 2,\n148–9). Perhaps one may suggest that neither Christianity nor\nPlatonism are side shows in Dionysius’ thought; They are rather\nmutually important whole perspectives that do not get lost in the mix,\nno matter how subordinate Neoplatonism nonetheless may be to\nChristianity for Dionysius himself. Dionysius’ central concern is how a\ntriune God, that he calls—among other things—the\nthearchy (god-rule; god-beginning), who is utterly\nunknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond\neven goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of\ncreation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of\ntheir source. To this end Dionysius employs some major Neoplatonic\ninsights: (1) The abiding—procession—return or\nconversion of all things as the creative and receptive expression of\nwhat it means for anything created to be. In Proclus’ terms in the\nElements of Theology, prop. 35: “Every effect remains in\nits cause, proceeds from it, and converts to it”. This is a way\nof expressing the vertical connectedness of everything by identity,\ndifference, and the overcoming of difference by a return to identity\nthat constitutes the nature of anything that is caused. (2) The\nhierarchical ordering of beings as an expression of both their natural\nplacements and their freedoms as well as the simultaneous immediacy,\nwithout intermediary, of the unknown God’s presence (on hierarchy see\nCH 3). Each thing and order bears relation to the whole or\nmanifests the whole, but “according to its own capacity”,\nas the famous Neoplatonic saying puts it. A rock or a worm, for\ninstance, is a window upon the entire universe if you only know how to\nlook. \n\nIn the case of (1), the contrast between Dionysius and Neoplatonism\nshould not be taken to be a contrast between free divine creation, on\nthe one hand, and supposed emanation or illumination by necessity, on\nthe other, for divine/ human freedom and creation out of\n“nothing” are conspicuous facets of Neoplatonic thought as\nwell. What we see in Dionysius is rather a new way of understanding the\nabiding, outpouring, and return, not only concretely in relation to the\nvarious hierarchies, and structurally in relation to the various works\n(DN is more concerned with procession, for instance, while\nEH, CH, and MT deal with different levels of\nreturn), but also in relation to God’s providential love that, while\nremaining supereminently identical to itself, and precontaining\neverything within itself, nonetheless is the creative power overflowing\ninto its effects (procession) in order to bring them back into identity\n(return): “[The Cause of All] is ‘all in all‘, as\nscripture affirms, and certainly he is to be praised as being for all\nthings the creator and originator, the One who brings them to\ncompletion, their preserver, their protector, and their home, the power\nwhich returns them to itself, and all this in the one single,\nirrepressible, and supreme act” (DN 1, 7,\n596c–597a). \n\nIn the case of (2) (hierarchy and divine presence), Dionysius\nemphasizes, much more so than the impression often suggested by\nNeoplatonism, the directness of creation. Every being, no\nmatter where it is placed in the scale of beings and no matter how\ndependent it might be on beings ontologically higher than it (e.g., for\nhuman beings, angels) is directly and immediately dependent upon God in\nand for its existence. Again, the contrasts often drawn between\nNeoplatonism’s “flight of the alone to the alone” and\nDionysius’ community of hierarchy or between the supposed Neoplatonic\nview that the One causes the existence of lower beings only through the\nmediation of the higher, while Christianity sees creation as immediate\nare simply false or too simplistic. Plotinus’ mysticism is not\n“solitary” in the sense often supposed and, for Plotinus,\nPorphyry, and Proclus, the One causes existence immediately and most\nprofoundly, whatever other influences enter into the complexity of\nexistence. What we see in Dionysius, by contrast, is a retention of\none’s place in hierarchy and a very concrete return to identity—in \nthe case of human beings, for instance, through scripture, ritual,\nand practical performance to a deeper union with God rather than a\nsimple, spatially conceived movement “up” the hierarchy.\nMore broadly still, we see in Dionysius’ thought new possibilities for\nthinking about divine love, a love that combines beyond beingness and\nunrestricted being, transcendence and yet even a kind of hyperessential\nvulnerability in rather startling ways, new ways consequently of\nthinking about both divine and human eros, about affectivity\n(cf. Dionysius’ famous dictum about learning from sacred writers, or\ndiscovering the truth oneself, or not only learning but\n“experiencing the divine things” (pathein ta\ntheia) (DN 2, 9); and compare Aristotle, fr. 15 (Rose)\nand Hebrews 5:8), about the nature of signification and the\nlimits of language (see section 4 below), about the theory of evil as\nprivation and non-being, however dependent this is upon one of\nProclus’ opuscula (cf. DN 4, 18–35), about the\naesthetic richness of this world in the light of theology and the life\nof the Church, and even about the soul–body relation, though\nanthropology is not a part of Dionysius’ primary concern (but see his\ncomments at EH 404B, 433c, 437a–440a, 441b, 553a ff,\n565b–c). \n\nTwo examples will have to suffice here: (a) Dionysius’ remarkable\ndescription of the ecstatic love of God and (b) his radical\ntransformation of the Neoplatonic intelligible and sensible worlds. \n\n(a) First, Dionysius evidently cannot accept in any single\nstraightforward sense the Neoplatonic notion of a One that excludes the\npossibility of expressing trinity. He therefore links in a new way God\nas unrestricted being with God as utterly beyond being or any\ndeterminate predications. At the same time in the DN he argues\nthat the ecstasy of love, which moves as a unifying force through\ncreation without departing from itself, is the divine nature. Dionysius\nadmits, in a note from Plato’s Phaedrus, that it is\ncharacteristic of yearning not to allow “lovers to belong to\nthemselves but only to their loved ones” (DN 4, 13).\nThis is shown, he goes on to argue, by the providential care of the\ngreater for the lesser (a reference to Proclus’ divine providential\nlove (eros pronoetikos) from the Commentary on the First\nAlcibiades, #56), by the love of equals, and by that of the lesser\nfor those better than them (a reference both to Aristotle’s seminal\ntreatment of friendship in the Nicomachean Ethics and to\nProclus’ returning or converting love (eros epistreptikos) in the same\nCommentary above), as also in the case of St. Paul’s famous\ndictum “I live now, not I, but Christ lives in me”\n(Gal 2:20). Might then such a belonging to one’s beloved be\ncharacteristic of God, if perhaps in a different sense? \n\nDionysius continues as follows: \n\nThe very notion is, of course, remarkable, the notion, that is, of a\nkind of conjunction of opposites that strives to express the\ninexpressible magnitude of divine love and even to suggest power and\nvulnerability (or “almost” vulnerability: “as it\nwere, charmed (beguiled, enchanted)”), as well as the possibility\nof a genuine two-way relation between Creator and creatures more\nin tune with Biblical thought. Yet the expression remains Greek, for\nthe word thelgetai that Dionysius chooses is one that echoes\nthe conclusion of Agathon’s speech in the Symposium where\nAgathon praises a Love that everyone “should hymn fairly, sharing\nin the song he sings that enchants/charms/beguiles (thelgon)\nthe thought (phronema) of all gods and human beings”\n(197c). Dionysius changes the context but does not really reverse the\npolarity: it is God who still—like human beings—is\nbeguiled by love and affection for beings and “led down” to\ndwell in them. Is this small detail and transposition merely\naccidental? It may well be, but in this context, the use of such a verb\nand thought is not accidental. Dionysius does not write as a Christian\nwalled off from pagan thought or as if he were a Neoplatonic thinker in\nChristian disguise. Instead he provokes and delights in intertextuality\nat every point. \n\n(b) A second example is the precise nature of Dionysius’\ntransposition of Neoplatonic structure. Dionysius makes concrete and\naccessible the whole world of Neoplatonism in the human, but\nsacramental life of the Church, a world of ordinary people and things\nwhose significance can only be fully realized and perfected in the\ncelestial and supercelestial world. \n\nFor Classical Neoplatonism, especially in its Plotinian form, the\nreal truths that undergird or form the origins, beginnings\n(archai) of the world of ordinary experience are the three\nhypostases or realities of soul, intellect, and the One. The hypostases\nare necessary, above all, to account for our experience of degrees of\nunity and organization. The life-world accessible to our senses\nis an organized, animated world, and this needs a more intensive degree\nof unity to account for it, namely, the principle of life, that is,\nsoul and all souls. But even the world of soul is a “one and\nmany”, organized from within yet also requiring a principle of\nunity and organization beyond itself. And the same is true even to a\nhigher degree of intellect. Intellect is a “one-many”, an\norganized world of intellects, in each of which the whole of intellect\nis present. Each is a sort of holographic reality. And because\nintellect is still a world despite its more intensive unity than soul,\nit requires a unity beyond intellect and beyond being to organize it\nand to form the groundless ground of its own being from which it has\nemerged. \n\nSo (1) in Neoplatonism, there are 3 hypostases, on the one hand,\nnamely, soul, intellect, and the One, and four cosmic or hypercosmic\ndimensions, on the other: (i) the sensible world as a world of things;\n(ii) the sensible world linked by the soul to the intelligible world;\n(iii) the intelligible world itself composed of all intellects; and\nfinally (iv) the One or the Good, from which everything has come. And\n(2) while everything has its appropriate “place” in this\nhypostatic hierarchy, the presence of the Good is so immediate and so\naccessible, that the presence is closer to each thing even than\nintellect or soul. This is equally true in both Plotinus and Proclus.\nFurthermore, (3) in order to explicate the derivation of each entity\nfrom what comes before it, it is not sufficient as some scholars have\nsupposed that Neoplatonism should just have multiplied intermediaries\nand indulged in an absurd proclivity for triads, such as Life, Wisdom,\nMind; Neoplatonism should rather be seen as a form of thought that\nattempts to meditate upon, read the signs in, and represent how, as\nprecisely as possible, all beings are derived from and relate to the\nOne, to examine and explicate their dependence, open-endedness,\nand radical interconnectedness without losing sight of the\nmultidimensional ordering of the universe (sensible/intelligible) and\nof the fact that even the simplicity of things that have no intellect\nor life, but only bare existence, springs from the power of the\nOne. \n\nWhat Dionysius manages to do is both to capture this spirit\nprofoundly, and, therefore, transform it, as well as to make it\nconcrete and accessible in the scriptural, sacramental, and ordinary\nexperiences of Christian practitioners. Instead of the 4 dimensions of\nthe Neoplatonic universe, Dionysius has the following: (1) the sensible\nworld or Legal hierarchy, i.e., the world considered under the aspect\neither of objective “thinginess” or of law, namely, in the\ncase of law, a world in which we are dependent upon prescriptions\nrather than upon any deeper understanding, a world in which the\n“mysteries” or hidden things (such as Baptism and the\nEucharist) are mere mechanical ceremonies and the Scriptures are given\nonly a literal meaning. For Dionysius (as for Plato), law is necessary,\nbut still deficient. The law of Moses, for instance, “gave only a\nveiled contemplation as to enlighten without harm weak capacities for\nsight” (EH 501c). Then (2) there follows the\necclesiastical hierarchy, namely, the sensible world as the limbs of\nthe mystical body of Christ led by soul into the significance of the\nintelligible or celestial hierarchy, where the symbols can begin to be\nread. Its mysteries, both sensible and intelligible, are the Scriptures\nand the Sacraments, its initiators the priests, and its initiated the\nones who receive them. From this perspective, Dionysius transforms\nNeoplatonism radically but at the same time provokes entirely new\npossibilities in the structures he transforms. \n\nWhat is the general character of Dionysius’ writing and is there\nanything philosophical in it? Dionysius presents us with complex\naffirmative (kataphatic) and negative (apophatic)\nforms of theology, exploring what we can say about God, what we mean by\nour statements, discovering the necessity for us to talk too much about\nGod and to push language forms to their breaking points, and then to\nsee what we cannot say about God. Negation is important here at both\nlevels, in kataphatic theology as well as in\napophatic theology. This complex theory of signification and\nits subversion is often referred to as negative theology: affirming our\naffirmations, then negating them, and then negating the negations to\nensure that we do not make an idol out of a God about whom we know\nnothing. But it is also much more than this. \n\nDionysius is practising forms of theological meditation in\nthe sense that the earlier Church Fathers had understood this, not as a\ntype of objectified, academic knowledge, but rather as a more complex,\nintersubjective form of address, communion and contemplation. Dionysius\nadopts the word theurgy, “god-work”, together with\ntheology, “god-word”, to describe the inmost reality\nof this practice, adopting it from the later Neoplatonist understanding\nof a hidden sympathy or interconnectedness between material things and\nthe sacred, divine significances resident in them by virtue of divine\npower. Iamblichus, for instance, had denied that pure thought or\ncontemplation could bring about union with the divine. What was crucial\nwas the performance of certain ritual actions or theurgy,\n“god-work”, in the belief that one could attain to\nthe divine by the incarnation of divine forces in material objects,\nstatues, or human beings through the divine power mirrored everywhere\nin the universe and in the natural sympathy of all parts, and not just\nby talking about the gods (theo-logy) or by looking at\nthem (theoria). For some modern critics, Dionysius’ adaptation\nof pagan theurgy is analogous to calling the Christian sacraments\n“magical”, which also results in the subsumption of\neverything (morality as well as contemplation) to a form of magical\ncorrespondence. But Dionysius does not understand theurgy in this way.\nFor him, “theurgy is the consummation (sygkephalaiosis)\nof theology” (EH 432B), which is to say that God’s activity\nwithin all the orders of nature does not abolish nature, morality,\ncontemplation, or science but rather completes them and makes possible\nthe divinization of human nature. \n\nGod’s work in all things, therefore, turns the world into a\nreservoir of possibilities: at its lowest and most fragmented, it is\napparently a world of only individual, discrete things without\nsignificance, but in reality it is a world vested with signs, symbols,\nand hidden meanings as the multidimensional creation of a Triadic God.\nEven the lowest things cannot simply be despised, for even in their\ndissimilarity from the divine, they bear the capacity to signify the\ndivine more appropriately than supposedly worthier images. If we say\nGod is good, we run the risk of thinking we know entirely what we mean\nand consequently of closing off a thought that has to be radically\nopen-ended, if not altogether subverted. If we liken God to a\n“worm”, we subvert our own comfortable tendencies by being\nshocked into filling the image with enquiry. So the Psalmist who uses\nthe worm image hides the sacred from those who would defile it\nwith a lack of understanding and yet points to the sacred in a\nnew way. This constant tension or dialectic between hiddenness and\nopenness pervades the whole of Dionysius’ meditative practice of\ntheology; and from this perspective Dionysius’ practice of writing is a\ncomplex and necessarily deceptive or subversive process of reading the\nencoded insight (or contemplation) in created things in such a way that\nneither the perceptual beauty of the material thing nor the deeper\nhidden beauty of the sign becomes a trap, an idol, or a vanishing point\nbut, instead, an activity that opens up an irresistibly beautiful world\nin and to God. \n\nThere are several consequences of this. First, Dionysius’ writing is\na response, a preparing of the organs of reception for the love of God\nin praise and worship. In theology, we are learning how to praise, to\nhymn—not to catalogue—God. Second, such\nwriting is dialogic and intersubjective to its core in three ways: a)\nAs “in between” teacher and pupil, dialogical receptivity\nand transmission, open-ended in both directions, characterize its\nessential form; b) Even in the content of Dionysius’\nvarious works, replete as they are with triads (which can so easily be\nrelegated to a Neoplatonic obscure penchant for providing intermediate\nlinks), this open-ended in-betweenness, characteristic of\nconversation and cooperation, is fundamental to the ranks of the\nvarious hierarchies. In the EH, for instance, in the triad\ncatechumen (the one undergoing purification), sponsor or confirmed\nChristian (the one being illumined), and hierarch (the one being\nperfected and enlightening) (according to the traditional triadic form:\npurification—illumination—perfection), the sponsor\nfirst introduces the catechumen and both sponsor and catechumen are\nthen mediated by the work of the hierarch. For Dionysius at least (if\nnot in the actual operation of a “church”), hierarchy is\nhere not a question of domination, but rather of a genuine\nopen-endedness, testability through interlocutor and mediator,\ncommunity and responsibility. c) Finally, what completes both the form\nand the content above all is prayer, since, for Dionysius (as\nfor Anselm much later), prayer is the primary form of reverential\nphilosophical thought and receptivity, “stretching ourselves\nout”, as in Gregory of Nyssa, so as to be “lifted up”\n(cf. DN 3). The most famous example of such prayer is the very\nbeginning of the MT, where in the address/request\n“Triad, above substance, above god, above good” to\n“make our way straight to the topmost peak, beyond knowing and\nlight, of the mystical scriptures—there where the simple,\nabsolute and unchangeable, mysteries of God’s speaking lie wrapped in\nthe darkness beyond light of secret—hidden silence”,\nTimotheus, the disciple is also included, together with us the\nreaders. \n\nAll of this looks so alien to the spirit of modern philosophy that\nwe may well ask if there is anything really philosophical in Dionysius’\npractice? The answer has to be affirmative, for there is a perfectly\nreasonable pattern to the whole of Dionysius’ works. In addition,\nDionysius regards his own task as a kind of demonstration\n(apodeixis) or showing (deixai). In the Divine\nNames, such demonstration is given a Pauline resonance when\nDionysius states that we should hold to the scriptural revelation of\ndivine names “not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in\ndemonstration of the power granted by the Spirit” (DN\n585b; cf. Paul 1 Cor 2–4). In other words, Dionysius here sees\nscripture as providing the basis for a deeper understanding of\nattribution or predication that will lead us beyond our own merely\nhuman capacities. That such a demonstration involves the unpacking of\nthe symbolic, contemplative, and mystical significances of ordinary\nthings by the aid of scriptural testimony is clear in the\nEcclesiastical Hierarchy, which again starts from Dionysius’\npurpose of demonstrating what the hierarchy comprises; and that this\nincludes arguments, reasons, the possibility of debate and even\nimprovement upon Dionysius’ demonstrations by his interlocutor becomes\nclear too at the end of the work, when the literary humility that is\ncharacteristic of his writing (cf. EH 568a ff.; DN\n981c–984a; CH 340b) shows itself to be philosophically\njustified by Dionysius’ ability to set out both sides of the case for\nand against infant baptism in the understanding that he may not fully\nbe in possession of the most complete view of the situation and that\nhis interlocutor should “use” what he has said “as\nsteps (epanabathmois) to a higher ray of light”\n(EH 568d–569a). This is a thought couched in terms very\nreminiscent of Socrates’ wish in the Republic to subvert or\ndestroy hypotheses and use them as stepping stones to something better,\nand it is also a thought not unworthy of Wittgenstein’s similar view at\nthe end of the Tractatus. The words immediately following make\nclear the connection between charity of interpretation,\nopen-endedness and demonstration: “Be generous with me\nthen, my dear friend,… and show (deixon) to my eyes\nthat more beautiful and unified beauty which you may be able to\nsee”. Demonstration in this sense, then, includes much of what we\nmight consider to be properly philosophical, but at root it is also a\nform of “divine reading” (lectio divina, or\nmeditative, prayerful reading) of nature and word, a receptive\nrecognition as a kind of method or making one’s way “to hear the\nsacred words as receptively as possible, to be open to the divine\nworkings of God, to clear an uplifting path (hodopoiesis)\ntoward that inheritance that awaits us in heaven, and to accept our\nmost divine and sacred regeneration” (EH 392a). \n\nIn sum, Dionysius represents the instantaneous resonances, possible\nin unusual circumstances, between forms of thought and practice that\nmay at first sight appear entirely divergent. He is therefore in some\nrespects a dangerous thinker, yet at the same time a forger of new\npossibilities: \n\nFor the long commentary tradition, from John of Scythopolis to Aquinas\nand Ficino, see bibliography 2 below. St. Gregory the Great refers to\nDionysius in his own commentary on the angels and probably had the\ncomplete works at Rome. But the study of Dionysius did not take off in\nthe Latin West until the Byzantine emperor Michael the Stammerer sent\na copy of the Dionysian corpus as a gift to the Frankish king Louis\nthe Pious in 827. This copy served as the source of the first\ntranslations of Dionysius into Latin. The first translation, made\naround 838 by Hilduin, abbot of a monastery near Paris (who identified\nDionysius not only as St. Dionysius the Areopagite but also as the\nfirst bishop of Paris), was so unintelligible that Charles II asked\nthe great Irish philosopher, John Scottus Eriugena, to make a new\ntranslation that he completed in 862 and that was subsequently revised\nwith clarifications in 875. The influence of Dionysius is profound in\nEriugena’s own thought as it would be later in the Franciscan\ntradition (especially Grosseteste and Bonaventure) and also to a\nlesser extent in the Dominican (both Albert and Aquinas wrote\ncommentaries). In fact, the abiding-procession-return triad may be\nsaid to form the essential structure of Aquinas’ unfinished\nmasterpiece, the Summa Theologica. The influence of\nDionysius’ ideas pervades not only the Italian and English\nRenaissance, but also the Rhineland mystical writers, such as Meister\nEckhart (d. 1327), Tauler (d. 1361), Ruysbroeck (d. 1381), Gerson\n(d. 1429), and later Denis the Carthusian (d. 1471) and Nicholas of\nCusa (d. 1464) (whose work On Learned Ignorance owes a debt\nto Dionysius’ agnosia or unknowingness, as does also the\nanonymous author of the Cloud of Unknowing) and the great\nSpanish mystics, for example, St. John of the Cross (d. 1591). In the\nGreek East, Dionysius’ On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy\ninspired a series of liturgical commentaries, beginning with\nthe Mystagogy of Maximus the Confessor (d. 662) and\ncontinuing with works by Germanus of Constantinople (d. 733) and\nNicholas Cabasilas (d. 1390). Dionysius played a major role in the\nPalamite controversy of the 14th century, cited both by Gregory\nPalamas (d. 1359) and by his opponents. In the modern world, Dionysius\nhas received less attention, though he is of some importance for 19th\ncentury German Idealist thought and also to a lesser extent for\nEnglish and American Romanticism. In the so-called\n“postmodern” world, however, two thinkers who have written\nabout Dionysius with great insight are Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques\nDerrida. Derrida, in particular, has been one of the few contemporary\nphilosophical thinkers, if not the only one, to realize the importance\nof Dionysius in relation to deconstruction (a term he does not use\nhimself) and to explore the complex nature of prayer, address, and\ndenial in the context of the necessarily deceptive and open-ended\npossibilities of negative theology.","contact.mail":"harringtonm@duq.edu","contact.domain":"duq.edu"}]
