In the realm of Jewish thought he is mostly remembered for\nBeḥinat ha-Dat (Examination of\nReligion)—a work which discusses the role and function of\nphilosophical discourse within the Jewish-religious sphere. Yet Del\nMedigo also played a central role in the development of the Averroist\ntradition in the Latin west: translating works by and composing\ncommentaries on the works of Averroes, at the request of his Christian\nassociates and patrons in the last quarter of the fifteenth century.\nIn order to fully appreciate the nature of Del Medigo’s\ncontribution it is therefore necessary to evaluate both aspects of his\nthought, within the context of its background: the Jewish community in\nCandia where Del Medigo received his initial formation, and the\nChristian intellectual circles of northern Italy, where Del Medigo\nspent most of his professional career. \n\n\n\n\n\nElijah Del Medigo was born in Candia (nowadays Heraklion), in the\nisland of Crete, in 1458 or shortly before that. Crete being a\nVenetian colony, Del Medigo traveled to Venice around 1480. The\nreasons for this move cannot be determined with certainty; one\nsuggestion is that Del Medigo moved to Padua in order to study\nmedicine (Cassuto 1918: 222; Ross 1984: 18). However and whatever were\nhis initial motives, Del Medigo’s activity while in Italy\nconcentrated around the instruction of philosophy and the composition\nof philosophical works. More specifically, during his long stay in the\nItalian peninsula Del Medigo earned his fame as translator of and\ncommentator on works by Averroes, and as the author of original\ntreatises aimed at clarifying Averroes’ doctrines in various\nfields. The target audience of these works were leading Christian\nfigures within the intellectual circles of Padua and Venice, among\nthem Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Domenico Grimani. During the\nacademic year 1480/81 Del Medigo composed his Quaestio de primo\nmotore and Quaestio de efficientia mundi following a\npublic discussion in Padua, which led scholars to speculate that Del\nMedigo held an official role in that university (Montada 2013:\n165). It seems however that while Del Medigo did play a major role in\nthe intellectual life in the Veneto in that period, he was not\nofficially affiliated with the university of Padua. Around 1482 Del\nMedigo moved to Venice, returned again to Padua, and in the years\n1484–85 stayed with Pico della Mirandola in Florence. During the\nacademic year 1485/86 we find Del Medigo again in Padua (Ross 1984:\n20), and it is around that time he composed his commentary on\nthe De substantia orbis.  Del Medigo then continued to travel\nthroughout the cities of Northern Italy, spending some time in Venice\nin 1488 under the patronage of Domenico Grimani. During his Italian\nsojourn Del Medigo composed four original works, wrote two\ncommentaries on works by Averroes, and translated about nine works by\nAverroes from Hebrew into Latin. \nAt around 1490 Del Medigo returned to Crete. As is often the case with\ndetails concerning Del Medigo’s life, the reasons for his return\nare not entirely clear. According to Ross, Del Medigo experienced\ngeneral discomfort with a growing intellectual trend of the Italian\nRenaissance, oriented more towards Neoplatonic and Kabbalistic\ntendencies than towards the rationalist speculation of the\nAristotelian schools of the Middle Ages (see Ross 1984: 24–25).\nBe it as it may, it was following his return to Crete and during the\nlast years of his life that Del Medigo composed what would become his\nmost famous work, Beḥinat ha-Dat, which will be\ndiscussed in detail below. Del Medigo died in Candia around 1492/1493\n(Ross 1984: 21–22; Licata 2013a: 48), \nA common trait of Del Medigo’s literary output is a clear taste\nfor Aristotelian philosophy in its Averroist guise. This is manifested\nboth in his translations and commentaries on Averroes, as well as in\nthe Beḥinat ha-Dat (although Averroes’ name is\nnot mentioned in that work, for reasons which will be discussed\nbelow). Despite this overarching feature, Del Medigo’s\noeuvre is also characterized by a dichotomy, geographical in\nas much as it is linguistic, religious and intellectual: Crete vs.\nItaly, Jewish thought vs. Paduan Aristotelianism, Hebrew vs. Latin. We\nwill examine Del Medigo’s activity as cohesive whole yet in\nlight of these different backgrounds and circumstances. \nAs mentioned above, the bulk of Del Medigo’s creative period was\nspent in Northern Italy, approximately between the years\n1480–1490. This fact is significant, as the Italian intellectual\nenvironment had a decisive impact on the shaping of Del Medigo’s\nphilosophical taste. Padua, in which Del Medigo lived, wrote, and\ntaught, was at that time a major center for the study of the works of\nAverroes, with his works being widely circulated, discussed and\ncommented upon. Averroes’ impact was so significant there that\nthat modern scholars later coined the term “Paduan\nAverroism”. While the validity of a robust notion of a Paduan\nAverroist school has been put into question, it is beyond doubt that\nDel Medigo’s Italian works reflect the intellectual climate of\nhis time and place (see Engel 2015: 496). What set Del Medigo\nadditionally apart from his fellow Christian scholars was his ability\nto read the works of Averroes which had survived in medieval Hebrew\ntranslations. Del Medigo therefore could bridge these philosophical\ntraditions, commenting upon Averroes’ works that circulated\namong the Latin readers in Christian Padua while also relying on works\nby Averroes which only survived in Hebrew. In addition, Del Medigo was\ntranslating these Hebrew versions into Latin, engaging in a\n“twofold exercise of translation and commentary” (Montada\n2013: 163). The full list of Averroes’ works translated by Del\nMedigo from Hebrew into Latin includes the following (source in\nbrackets): \nDel Medigo’s activity as a translator was part of a larger wave\nof Hebrew-into-Latin translations of Averroes during the fifteenth and\nthe sixteenth centuries (see Hasse 2006). In addition to the translations themselves, we also\nfind correspondences between Del Medigo and his patrons, in which the\ntranslations were discussed. \nApart from translating the works of Averroes, Del Medigo also wrote\noriginal compositions aimed at elucidating Averroes’ doctrines,\nas well as commentaries on works such as the Physics and\nDe substantia orbis. The aim of these works and commentaries\nwas to clarify and elucidate the views of Averroes on various themes,\nand to contextualise these views as widely as possible within the\ncontext of the Averroist corpus. Mirroring a common medieval practice,\nDel Medigo’s originality as philosopher rested not in the\nintroduction of a new metaphysical scheme, i.e., departing from the\nfoundations of Aristotelian physics and metaphysics, but in\ninterpreting and reinterpreting an existing body of works and\ndoctrines. From a methodological perspective, Del Medigo shared with\nhis fellow Paduan Averroists a polemical tendency, arguing that a true\nunderstanding of Averroes’ doctrines required the rejection of\nprevious interpretations. Such false interpretations, in Del\nMedigo’s view, were carried forward either by anti-Averroists\n(most notably Thomas Aquinas) as well as by followers of Averroes,\npast and present, who misunderstood and misconstrued the\nlatter’s doctrines. Among those, Del Medigo’s chief target\nwas the fourteenth century Averroist John of Jandun, whom Del Medigo\nrepeatedly attacks in his works and commentaries. John of Jandun was\none scholar frequently cited in the works of other Paduan Averroists,\nmost often to reject his interpretations (Hasse 2007:\n324–25; Mahoney\n1997: 140; Engel 2017: 20–23). Other scholastic authors\nmentioned by Del Medigo were Albert the Great, Giles of Rome, William\nof Ockham and Walter Burleigh (Montada 2013: 165–66, 169). Del Medigo’s reference\nto these authors, as well as his open critique of John of Jandun,\nportrays him as a prominent Jewish representative of the Latin\nscholastic tradition, and in particular of the Averroist Paduan school\nof the late fifteenth century (see Zonta 2006). \nThematically, Del Medigo’s Italian works concern Aristotelian\nphysics, metaphysics, and psychology. The works are mutually related,\nas metaphysical discussions rely on physical notions such as matter,\nform, and causality. Thus, for instance, in his physical works, in his\npsychological work the Two Investigations, and in Del\nMedigo’s personal correspondence with Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola, one comes across the denial of the possibility of creation\nex nihilo (Kieszkowski 1964: Licata 2013a: 63; 72;\nEngel 2017: 39). Therefore, and\ndespite their diverging thematic orientation, Del Medigo’s works\nought to be perceived as a cohesive whole, aimed at clarifying\nAverroes’ positions in a variety of fields. \nDel Medigo’s physical and metaphysical works are the De\nprimo motore, Quaestio de efficientia mundi, De esse\net essentia et uno as well as his Annotationes in librum De\nphisico auditu super quibusdam dictis Commentatoris. These works\nwere collected and printed during the sixteenth century (now available\nas a modern facsimile edition, see bibliography below). Another work\nby Del Medigo which concerns physical themes is his commentary on\nAverroes’ De substantia orbis. This work has survived\nin two manuscripts, a Latin autograph and a Hebrew translation of the\nLatin text, made by Del Medigo himself (a Hebrew-Latin bilingual\ncritical edition of this work is currently under preparation). \nA reoccurring theme in Del Medigo’s physical works is the nature\nof Divine causality. This is the main theme of both the Quaestio\nde efficientia mundi as well as the De primo motore.\nDivine causality was a popular theme throughout the Middle Ages and\nthe Renaissance, and by participating in this\ndiscussion—clarifying and endorsing Averroes’ view on the\nmatter—Del Medigo is again shown to be participating in what was\nessentially a Christian scholastic debate (Licata 2013a: 61;\nMontada 2013: 158). The Quaestio de\nefficientia mundi, composed in 1480 at the request of Girolamo\nDonato, asks whether God, the prime mover, is only the cause of the\ncelestial bodies’ movement, or of their essence and existence as\nwell (Licata 2013c: 59–60).\nIn his discussion Del Medigo is\nrelying, among other sources, on the short, middle and long\ncommentaries on the Metaphysics as well as on Averroes’\nDe substantia orbis. Del Medigo himself translated the\nintroduction of book XII of the Metaphysics from Hebrew into\nLatin (Montada 2013: 164), and his tendency to include in his original compositions\ncitations from treatises which he himself translated is characteristic\nof Del Medigo’s work in general (see Engel: 2017: 18). At Del\nMedigo’s own admission, the Quaestio de efficientia\nmundi consists of arguments collected from the works of Averroes,\nleading to the conclusion that God is not only the mover of the\ncelestial spheres, but their efficient cause as well. Here Del\nMedigo’s discussion is echoing an internal Averroist debate,\narguing against the interpretation of John of Jandun, who held that\nGod is only the final cause of the universe, not its efficient cause\n(Licata 2013a: 60). God is the\nefficient cause of the spheres, Del Medigo explains, not by creating\nthem ex nihilo, but by guaranteeing their movement, which in\nturn constitute their being. He therefore endorses a qualified sense\nof efficient causality, according to which whoever grants a thing its\nessence—as God eternally grants the spheres their\nmovement—may be considered an efficient cause in congruence with\nAverroes’ position as expounded in works such the Destructio\ndestructionum and De substantia orbis. (Del Medigo\n1480a: f. 140r; Licata 2013c: 62–63;\nLicata 2013a: 53–54).\nClosely related to the\nQuaestio de efficientia mundi is Del Medigo’s De\nprimo motore, written around the same time. In that work, Del\nMedigo arrives at the same conclusion, i.e., God as the efficient as\nwell as the formal and final cause of the universe. Creation is\ninterpreted as eternal act of creation, and the eternity of the world\nbecomes compatible with the existence of a creator (see Del Medigo\n1480a: f. 134r; Licata 2013a: 57, 62): \nThe being of the celestial bodies exists and endures because of\nmovement, and what gives movement, makes the movement, and since the\nbeing of these celestial bodies is not accomplished except by\nmovement, who gives movement accomplishes their being (Del Medigo\n1480a: f. 129, translation in Montada 2013: 178–79)  \nThe question concerning the nature of God’s agency also has\nbearing on the nature of matter and form in the translunar world.\nMatter and form are attributed to worldly beings and to the celestial\nbodies only equivocally—otherwise celestial beings would suffer\ngeneration and corruption as beings in the sublunar world. The\nimmaterial form of the celestial spheres guarantees their eternal\nmovement, and by eternally moving them God is constituted as their\nefficient cause (Montada 2013: 179). The nature of translunar matter and form was also\ndiscussed by Averroes in his De substantia orbis, a work on\nwhich Del Medigo wrote a lengthy commentary where he discusses the\nequivocal meaning of matter and form. Del Medigo references De\nsubstantia orbis throughout his works, again exemplifying the\nunified nature of his works, having at its focal point the works and\ndoctrines of Averroes (see Licata 2015: 94). \nOther contested physical themes which Del Medigo discusses are\nmovement and infinity. Del Medigo endorses Averroes’ position in\nthe long commentary on the Physics, where the latter argues\nthat, according to Aristotle, movement is predicated equivocally as it\nis found in different categories: substance (a thing moving from\nnon-being into being) or quality (a white thing becoming black), to\nmention two examples (Montada 2013: 170). Regarding infinity, Del Medigo’s starting point\nis Aristotle’s assertion that every magnitude is potentially\nsubject to infinite division, yet that this is not the case with\naddition, as yet every magnitude is not subject to infinite addition\n(Montada 2013: 172). In\nhis Annotationes in librum De phisico auditu, Del Medigo\nsides with Averroes and argues against Walter Burley’s\ninterpretation. Division, Del Medigo holds, is intrinsically related\nto matter. It thus follows that the type of potency associated with\ndivision is permanent, and hence can never be realized. In other\nwords, division entails permanent potency, yet the type of potency\nassociated with addition may be fully realized. Whereas division is\nassociated with matter, addition is associated with form, and whereas\ndivision is inherently potential, addition is a process which may\nachieve completion. Therefore one cannot construe infinite addition,\nnot even potentially (Del Medigo 1486: f. 140r-v; Montada 2013:\n174–75). \nDel Medigo’s most distinct metaphysical work is his De ente\net essentia et uno, composed following his conversations with\nPico on being, essence and unity, siding with Averroes against\nAvicenna (Montada 2013: 163–64). Yet the lengthiest of all Del Medigo’s original\ncomposition is the Two Investigations on the Nature of the Human\nSoul, a work on Aristotelian psychology which concentrates on the\nnature and destiny of the human intellect. \nAs the opening and closing lines of the Two Investigations\nindicate, Del Medigo composed the work at the request of his friend\nand Patron, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Apart from being Del\nMedigo’s lengthiest and most complex work, it also serves as the\nmost striking evidence for the latter’s affinity with Paduan\nphilosophical circles, as the nature of human intellect, and in\nparticular its ontological status, was among the most hotly debated\nthemes in Padua in Del Medigo’s time (see Hasse 2007, 2004: 115; Engel 2017: 20) \nThe unicity controversy was a philosophical and metaphysical as well\nas hermeneutical debate. The metaphysical aspect is reflected in the\ndiscussion concerning the nature of the human material\nintellect—i.e., our potential disposition for receiving\nthoughts—whether it is a single substance or multiple\nsubstances, and whether it is corporeal or separate from corporeal\nmatter. Hermeneutically, the work attempts to discern the correct\ninterpretation of certain passages from Averroes’ Long\nCommentary on the De anima and, more fundamentally, of certain\npassages in Aristotle’s De anima. In that work, it is\nnot quite clear what Aristotle’s own position concerning the\nontological status of the human intellect is. On the one hand, the\nmaterial intellect is described as our intellect, by virtue\nof which we think. On the other hand, some of\nAristotle’s remarks seem to indicate that the material intellect\nis separate in its existence from the individual human being.\nThroughout antiquity, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,\nAristotle’s interpreters debated this question, with\nAverroes’ discussion of it in his long commentary on the De\nanima the focal point of many of the later discussions. In\nchapter 3.5, commenting upon lines 429a21–24 in the De\nanima, Averroes in the long commentary stresses those aspects in\nAristotle’s text which suggest that the intellect, despite\npossessing a certain relation to human individuals, is nonetheless a\nseparate substance, shared by all humans. Once the long commentary on\nthe De anima was translated into Latin, this interpretation\nwas picked up by philosophers in the Latin west from the thirteenth\ncentury onwards, among them Elijah Del Medigo. \nDel Medigo’s first investigation thus concerns the question\nwhether the material intellect is a single substance, shared by all\nhuman beings, or whether each of us possesses her own intellect (Del\nMedigo 1482: f. 1r). Del Medigo’s method in discussing the\nquestion is a dialectical one, close to that of a Scholastic\nquaestio—considering the arguments for and against the\nproposed thesis (that the material intellect is one in number), before\narriving at his own (Del Medigo’s) conclusion, following\nAverroes’ lead in the long commentary on the De anima.\nDel Medigo’s Two Investigations is therefore, at its\ncore, an attempt to both clarify Averroes’ unicity thesis to\nPico as well as illustrating its validity, and Del Medigo does so\ninitially by a reductio ad absurdum of competing\ninterpretations. Del Medigo first argues against those who claimed the\nintellects are many in number, i.e., that each of us possesses her own\nintellect. This, in turn, can be interpreted in two ways, which Del\nMedigo identifies as two concrete positions in the history of\nphilosophy: \nHaving refuted these two positions, i.e., the two ways according to\nwhich the intellect can be individuated, Del Medigo arrives at the\nremaining logical option: that the intellect is a separate substance,\nshared by all humans. This was the conclusion of Averroes, and Del\nMedigo then moves to illustrate the validity and coherence of this\nposition. \nIn the second investigation, Del Medigo explores the nature of human\nconjunction with the agent intellect, again following Averroes’\ninterpretation of Aristotelian principles. \nBeḥinat ha-Dat is Del Medigo’s last and best\nknown work, which received more scholarly attention than all of his\nother works combined. Unlike his Italian works, Beḥinat\nha-Dat was composed in Hebrew at the request of Del\nMedigo’s pupil, Shaul Ashkenazi, following Del Medigo’s\nreturn to Crete. The overarching theme of the work is an attempt to\nlegitimise philosophical practice within the Jewish religious realm.\nThis attempt brings to mind Maimonides’ Guide of the\nPerplexed, though the most immediate source—which Del\nMedigo does not acknowledge for reasons which we will discuss\nbelow—is Averroes’ Decisive Treatise. The\nrelation between Beḥinat ha-Dat and Averroes’\nDecisive Treatise was discussed by various authors throughout\nthe generations (see Ivry 1983: 251; Montada 2013: 158). And most recently by\nGiovanni Licata, who has convincingly illustrated Del Medigo’s\nreliance on the Decisive Treatise by citing parallel passages\nfrom the two works (see Licata 2013a: 129–86). \nWhile the works composed during Del Medigo’s stay in Italy\nconcern themes in Aristotelian natural sciences and metaphysics,\nBeḥinat ha-Dat may be described as meta-philosophical,\nas it discusses the relation between rational discourse and revealed\nreligion. Del Medigo begins his discussion by presenting his main\nmotivation in composing the work: to determine whether the study of\nphilosophy is permissible, forbidden, or mandatory (Del Medigo 2013:\n292). His conclusion (2013: 292–93) is that while the study of\nphilosophy is not obligatory as such, it is mandatory for those who\nare capable of engaging in philosophical speculation. Such engagement\nwill strengthen the student’s belief, as the philosophical\nsciences concern created beings, and the knowledge of created beings\nleads to the knowledge of the creator (2013: 294). Del Medigo\nemphasises that philosophical speculation alone is insufficient from a\nreligious standpoint, as the Jewish philosopher still shares with the\nmasses a belief in the words and instructions of the Torah\n(2013: 294). The philosopher ought to supply the true interpretation\nof the biblical narrative, to be circulated only among those capable\nof philosophical reflection (2013: 294). Exceptions are the\nfundamental tenets of the Jewish belief, the validity of which ought\nnot be grounded in reason, let alone questioned. Such tenets, which\nare beyond the reach of philosophical speculation, are the possibility\nof prophecy, reward and punishment, and the possibility of miracles\n(2013: 310). \nThe investigation concerning valid modes of interpreting the\nTorah leads Del Medigo to discuss Kabbalistic\ninterpretations, and to present his general stand concerning the\nKabbalistic trend in Judaism (see Bland 1991). The majority of Jewish\nsages and Talmudists, Del Medigo argues (322–323), rejected the\nKabbalistic interpretations and were drawn instead to philosophy and\nrational speculation. Del Medigo rejects the traditional attribution\nof Sefer ha-Zohar, the authoritative Kabbalistic work, to\nShim’on Bar Yohay, and adds other arguments opposing the\nKabbalistic-mystical interpretation of the Torah. Del\nMedigo’s criticism of the Kabbalah appears in his other works as\nwell, for instance in his Hebrew version of the commentary on De\nsubstantia orbis (Del Medigo 1485: f. 41; Ross 1984: 20). Yet\naccording to Ross, more than the Kabbalah itself, it was the Christian\nKabbalah that Del Medigo was attacking in the Beḥinat\nha-Dat (Ross 1984: 13). \nAnother related theme discussed by Del Medigo concerns the reasons for\nthe commandments. Following Maimonides, Del Medigo argues that there\nis a rational foundation for prescribing the commandments to the\nJewish people, even if not all reasons are entirely known, and that\none major aspect is to “direct people to the Good, in so far as\nthey are able to” (Del Medigo 2013: 336–38). The theme of\nthe reasons for the commandments in fact encompasses all themes\nmentioned earlier: the place of philosophical reflection within the\nreligious realm, the application of rational/philosophical\ninterpretation of the biblical narrative, and Del Medigo’s\ncriticism of the Kabbalistic interpretation of the Torah.\nHere, Del Medigo’s anti-Kabbalistic stand is manifested in his\ncriticism of the Kabbalistic interpretation of the commandments:\n“for we humans can hardly improve ourselves, and how can we\nimprove the divine worlds” (Del Medigo 2013: 342). Lastly,\nBeḥinat ha-Dat also discusses the rational status of\nthe Christian creed, arguing that unlike the fundamental principles of\nJudaism, the Christian belief is fundamentally irrational (Lasker\n2007: 25–28; Ross 1984: 26). \nAccording to Del Medigo, his role model in composing Beḥinat\nha-Dat was Maimonides, who inspired him in defining the relation\nbetween philosophical speculation and religious belief. While the\ninfluence of Averroes’ Decisive Treatise is apparent,\nDel Medigo never mentions the latter in Beḥinat ha-Dat.\nThis is in sharp contrast to the Italian works, where Averroes was the\nultimate philosophical authority (besides Aristotle) and Maimonides is\nrarely mentioned. The discrepancy between Del Medigo’s\nphilosophical and meta-philosophical works is therefore manifested\nalso in the authorities on which he relies. While Averroes was a\nleading philosophical authority among Scholastic circles in fifteenth\ncentury Padua, Maimonides’ position concerning the function of\nphilosophical discourse within the religious realm had a profound\nimpact on Jewish sages all throughout the middle ages, and Maimonides\ntherefore serves Del Medigo in Beḥinat ha-Dat as his\nchief authoritative source (see Ross 1984: 11). \nConsidering all the above, it is not surprising that Beḥinat\nha-Dat caught the attention of Jewish readership and Jewish\nscholars throughout the generations, and the debates between these\nscholars summed up recently in an article by Carlos Fraenkel (Fraenkel\n2013). Certain scholars, starting with Adolph Hübsch, have argued\nthat for Del Medigo the religious and the philosophical truths were in\nfact identical. Others, beginning with Julius Guttmann, who responded\nto Hübsch, argued that Del Medigo was in act influenced by the\nChristian “double truth” theory. Fraenkel himself argues\nthat Del Medigo’s  \nstance on the relationship between philosophy and religion\nfundamentally agrees with that of Averroes, according to which\n“the truth does not contradict the truth”. (Fraenkel 2013:\n312; for Fraenkel’s discussion on Hübsch and Guttmann see\n2013: 219)  \nIt is a significant fact that these scholars, while debating Del\nMedigo’s position on the relation between philosophy and\nreligion, rely mostly on Del Medigo’s account in\nBeḥinat ha-Dat. The latter did, however, treat\nmeta-philosophical issues present in the Italian works as well. In his\nQuaestio de efficientia mundi, for instance, Del Medigo\nclearly differentiates the realm of religious belief—where one\nmay endorse the belief in creation ex nihilo—and the\nphilosophical truth which seems to contradict this view. Del Medigo\nspeaks in this context of two truths, one religious (“via\nlegis”) and one philosophical (“via\nphilosophica”) (Licata 2013a: 62). Yet this treatment, which\nappears as a formulation of the “double truth” theory, was\nbeing introduced in the form of a side remark, mainly to appease the\nmind of his Christian readers, and was nothing like the systematic\ntreatment of the theme in Beḥinat ha-Dat (Licata 2015:\n92). The question whether Del Medigo in fact held a coherent doctrine\nconcerning the relation between revealed and scientific doctrines, or\nwhether one should examine his statements on the subject on an ad\nhoc basis, still remains open and requires further study (Engel\n2016).  \nIn the Hebrew versions of his philosophical works, as well as in\nBeḥinat ha-Dat, Del Medigo explicitly refers to himself\nas a Jewish sage and disciple of Maimonides, and often downplays the\nimportance of his own Aristotelian compositions. Del Medigo would\ntherefore have been pleased to discover that in modern scholarship he\nis mainly remembered as a Jewish thinker. Yet by judging the content\nof his Italian works, which constitute the bulk of his literary\noutput, Del Medigo’s contribution to the history of philosophy\nis manifested in that he was among the first to merge, in his\ntranslations as well as in his original works, the Hebrew and Latin\nAverroist schools, which until his day existed as two separate\nphilosophical traditions. By doing so, Del Medigo contributed to the\ncreation of a unified corpus of Averroes’ works, which had a\ndecisive impact on the Aristotelian Renaissance tradition and up until\nthe early modern period. In other words, despite his religious\naffiliation, Del Medigo’s contribution lies clearly within the\nrealm of the Aristotelian tradition, which, qua philosophical\ntradition, transcends religious and linguistic boundaries.
