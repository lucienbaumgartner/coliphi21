The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, are\nthat it is a mentalist and representationalist theory of\ninterpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not only\nof individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respects\nDRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which during\nthe 1970s had emanated from Montague’s pioneering work (Thomason\n1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in its\nuse of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve\nas a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will\nconfine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense,\npresupposition, and propositional attitudes. For references to work on\nother topics, see the “Further reading” section.\n\n This article concerns Discourse Representation Theory narrowly\ndefined as work in the tradition descending from Kamp (1981). The same\nterm is sometimes used more broadly, occasionally embracing Heim’s\n(1982) work and the developments initiated by Groenendijk and Stokhof\n(1989, 1991). However, the more common common label for the extended\nDRT family is “dynamic semantics”, and that is the term we\nwill use, too. Two features that set DRT apart from other varieties of dynamic\nsemantics is that it is representational and non-compositional. In the\n1980s, the founding years of dynamic semantics, these features made\nDRT a controversial theory, though by now those controversies have\nabated. DRT’s main innovation, beyond the Montagovian paradigm which\nwas then considered orthodox, is that it introduced a level of mental\nrepresentations, called “discourse representation\nstructures” (DRSs). The basic idea is rather straightforward. It\nis that a hearer builds up a mental representation of the discourse as\nit unfolds, and that every incoming sentence prompts additions to that\nrepresentation. This picture has always been commonplace in the\npsychology of language. DRT’s principal tenet is that it should be the\nstarting point for semantic theory, too. A theory of the DRT family consists of the following\ningredients: Technically, this is very similar to earlier work in formal\nsemantics, with two exceptions: the interpretation process always\ntakes the previous discourse into account, and the level of semantic\nrepresentations is claimed to be essential. What has worried some\nsemanticists is not so much the fact that DRSs are mental\nrepresentations, but that an additional level is needed, and used in\nways that render the theory non-compositional; we will return to this\nissue in Section 7. The relationship between a pronoun and its antecedent is one that\nhas received a great deal of attention in linguistics and philosophy.\nWe say that a pronoun is anaphoric, as opposed to deictic, for\nexample, if it depends for its interpretation on an antecedent\nexpression elsewhere in the sentence or the discourse. In some cases\nthe nature of this dependency seems straightforward: (Here and henceforth we use underlining to highlight the anaphoric\nlinks we are currently interested in.) Since “Pedro” is a\nreferential expression, it makes sense, in this case, to say that\n“his” is a referential term, too, which derives its\nreference from its antecedent.  This construal is plausible enough,\nbut it doesn’t apply across the board: The term “no farmer” is not a referential expression,\nso “his” cannot be coreferential with it. Rather, it would\nseem that, in this case, the relationship between the pronoun and its\nantecedent is one of binding, in the logical sense of\nthe word: “no farmer” and “his” are\ninterpreted as a quantifier and a variable, respectively, and the\nformer binds the latter. It is fairly obvious that the bound-variable construal of pronouns\nis subject to syntactic constraints. Most importantly, this type of\ninterpretation requires that the pronoun\nbe c-commanded by its antecedent, where c-command is\ndefined as follows: The constituent structure of sentence [2] is [S\n[NP No farmer][VP beat [NP his\ndonkey]]]. Here the pronoun is contained in the sister of its\nantecedent, so the c-command constraint is met. In [3] “no\nfarmer” does not c-command “his”, and so we predict,\ncorrectly, that the pronoun cannot be bound. Since the syntactic structure of [1] is identical to that of [2],\nwe might wonder if the pronoun in [1] may not be bound by its\nantecedent, just as in [2]. If this were possible, there would be two\nways of construing the pronoun in [1]: it could function either as a\nreferential term or as a bound variable. There is evidence that this is\nindeed the case: [4a] is ambiguous in a way [4b] is not. Its second conjunct can be\nconstrued as saying either that Juan beats his own donkey or that Juan\nbeats Pedro’s donkey. The second conjunct of [4b], by contrast, can\nonly be interpreted as saying that Juan beats his own donkey. If the\npossessive pronoun in the first conjunct of [4a] can be either\nreferential or a bound variable, the contrast is readily\nexplained. In large part, the motivation for developing dynamic theories of\ninterpretation, beginning with DRT, was the realization that the\ndichotomy between referential and bound-variable (occurrences of)\npronouns is less natural than one might think—less natural in\nthe sense that some pronouns don’t fit comfortably in either\ncategory. What is the relationship between “it” in the second\nsentence and its antecedent expression in the first? On the one hand,\nit cannot be coreference. If the pronoun were coreferential with its\nantecedent, the indefinite “a donkey” would have to be a\nreferential term, which seems unlikely, e.g., because the negation of\n[5a] says not that there is a donkey that Pedro fails to own, but\nrather that he doesn’t own any donkey, and furthermore, if [5a] is\nnegated, the anaphoric link between the pronoun and its antecedent is\nsevered: (The asterisk indicates that the sentence is infelicitous if\n“a donkey” is to be interpreted as the antecedent of\n“it”.) Observations like these suggest rather strongly\nthat indefinites are quantifiers rather than referential\nterms. However, if we construe “a donkey” as an\nexistential quantifier, how does it manage to bind the pronoun across\na sentence boundary? The problem with [5] is related to the fact that the pronoun and\nits indefinite antecedent occur in different sentences. The following\nexamples show, however, that similar problems arise within\nsentences: These are the infamous “donkey sentences” that were\nalready discussed by scholastic philosophers, and in modern times were\nreintroduced into philosophy by Geach (1962). In these cases it is\nobvious that the pronouns don’t refer, so they can’t be coreferential\nwith their antecedents, either. Nor are the pronouns bound by their\nantecedents, for they aren’t c-commanded by them. The constituent\nstructure of [7b] is roughly as follows: Whatever the syntactical details, “a donkey” is too\ndeeply embedded for it to c-command “it”. The same goes\nfor [7a]. Hence, the neuter pronouns in [7a,b] cannot be construed as\nbound variables. Another way of showing that donkey pronouns are problematic is by\nconsidering how we might render these sentences in predicate\nlogic. The most obvious interpretation of [7a] is that Pedro beats\nevery donkey he owns, and [7b] is naturally interpreted as claiming\nthat every farmer beats every donkey he owns. (So, somewhat\nsurprisingly, it appears that the indefinites in these sentences have\nuniversal force.) These readings may be captured as follows: So the problem is not that predicate logic fails to capture the\nmeanings of [7a] and [7b]. The problem is, rather, how to derive [9a]\nand [9b] from [7a] and [7b] in a principled way. In order to derive\nthese logical forms, we have to assume not only that an indefinite\nexpression buried in a subordinate position ends up having wide scope,\nbut also that it acquires universal force in the process. A theory\nbased on such assumptions might capture the facts, but it would be\nclearly ad hoc, and would generate a host of false predictions, as\nwell. The upshot of the foregoing observations is that, apparently,\nindefinites are neither quantifiers nor referential terms, and this\nproblem entrains another one, for as long as it is unclear what\nindefinites mean, it will also remain obscure how they can serve as\nantecedents to pronouns. Later on we will see that very similar\nproblems arise in seemingly disparate domains, like the interpretation\nof tense and presuppositions. This section introduces DRT in fairly informal terms. We show how a\nhearer builds up a mental model of the ongoing discourse, dealing not\nonly with simple sentences, but also with conditionals,\nquantification, and anaphora, and we discuss DRT’s treatment of\nindefinites, and how they are set apart from quantifying\nexpressions. A discourse representation structure (DRS) is a mental\nrepresentation built up by the hearer as the discourse unfolds. A DRS\nconsists of two parts: a universe of so-called “discourse\nreferents”, which represent the objects under discussion, and a\nset of DRS-conditions which encode the information that has\naccumulated on these discourse referents. The following DRS represents\nthe information that there are two individuals, one of which is a\nfarmer, the other a donkey, and that the former chased the latter: The universe of this DRS contains two discourse\nreferents, x\nand y, and its condition set is\n{farmer(x),\ndonkey(y),\nchased(x,y)}. A DRS like the one in [1] can be given a straightforward\nmodel-theoretic interpretation. In DRT this is done by means\nof embedding functions, which are partial functions\nfrom discourse referents to individuals in a given model M;\nor put otherwise, an embedding function is a partial variable\nassignment. An embedding function f verifies\n[1] in M iff the domain of f includes at\nleast x\nand y, and according to M\nit is the case that f(x)\nis a farmer, f(y) is a\ndonkey, and f(x)\nchased f(y). Meanwhile it will have become clear that the DRS in [1] is designed\nto reflect the intuitive meaning of: Indeed, it is claimed that, in the absence of any information about\nthe context in which this sentence is uttered, [1] is the semantic\nrepresentation of [2]. So the indefinite expressions “a\nfarmer” and “a donkey” prompt the introduction of\ntwo new discourse referents, x\nand y, and contribute the\ninformation that x is a farmer\nand y a donkey, while the verb\ncontributes the information that the former chased the latter. If a discourse begins with an utterance of [2], the DRS in [1] is\nconstructed, and this DRS forms the background against which the next\nutterance is interpreted. Suppose now that [2] is followed by a token\nof [3a]: [3b] is the DRS that reflects the semantic content of [3a] before\nthe pronouns are resolved. In this DRS, the anaphoric pronouns\n“he” and “it” in [3a] are represented by the\ndiscourse referents v\nand w, respectively. These\ndiscourse referents are underlined to indicate that they require an\nantecedent. Since [3a] is uttered in the context of [1], the next step\nin the interpretation of this sentence is to merge the DRS in [3b]\nwith that in [1]. The result of this merging operation is [4a]: Since [3a] is immediately preceded by [2], the antecedent of\n“he” is probably (though not necessarily) “a\nfarmer”, while “it” is anaphorically dependent on\n“a donkey”. At the DRS level, this is represented by equating\nthe discourse referents v\nand w\nwith x\nand y, respectively. These\noperations yield [4b], which is equivalent to [4c].  Either DRS is\nverified in a model M iff M features a farmer who\nchased and caught a donkey. Thus far, we have only considered DRSs with simple conditions, but\nin order to account for negated and conditional sentences, say,\ncomplex conditions are required. [5b] is the sentence DRS corresponding to [5a]. This DRS contains a\ncondition that consists of a DRS prefixed by a negation sign. For ease\nof reference we will sometimes adorn DRSs with numerical labels, as we\nhave done in [5b], and use these in names like\n“[5b1]”, “[5b2]”, and so\non. In general, labeling of DRSs will be top-down and left-to-right,\nso the main (or principal) DRS will always be number one. A function f verifies [5b1] in a\nmodel M iff f\nmaps x onto an individual\nin M which “is a Pedro”, i.e., which is called\n“Pedro”, and f cannot be extended to a\nfunction g which verifies [5b2]. That is to say,\nno such g should map y\nonto a donkey that Pedro owns. [5b2] contains a token of the discourse\nreferent x which is introduced\nexternally, in the DRS in which [5b2] is embedded, i.e.,\n[5b1]. Apart from that, [5b2] also introduces a\ndiscourse referent of its own,\ni.e., y, which is associated with\nthe indefinite NP “a donkey”, and whose scope is delimited\nby [5b2]. Consequently, it doesn’t make sense to refer\nto y outside of [5b2].\nIn DRT, this is taken to explain why the “lifespan” of the\nindividual introduced by the indefinite NP in [5a] is delimited by the\nscope of the negation operator. If [5a] were followed by [6a], for\nexample, the pronoun could not be linked to the indefinite: If we merge [5b] and [6b], which is the sentence DRS corresponding\nwith [6a], we obtain [6c]. In this representation, the discourse\nreferent z does not have access\nto y,\nbecause y is introduced in a DRS\nthat is not accessible to the DRS in\nwhich z is introduced, and\ntherefore it is not possible to\nbind z\nto y.  In other words, if [6a] is\npreceded by [5a], the pronoun cannot be anaphorically linked to the\nindefinite. This prediction appears to be correct. Accessibility is in the first instance a relation between DRSs;\nderivatively, it is also a relation between discourse\nreferents. [6c1] is accessible to [6c2], but not\nthe other way round, and therefore the discourse referents introduced\nin [6c1], i.e., x\nand z, are accessible from\n[6c2], but conversely, if we are in [6c1] we\nhave no access to [6c2] and its discourse referents,\ni.e., y.  Thus in [6c] anaphora is\nnot possible because y is not\naccessible to z. In [4a], by\ncontrast, anaphora is possible,\nbecause x\nand y are accessible\nto v\nand w (the accessibility relation\nbeing reflexive). The notion of accessibility is crucial to DRT’s\naccount of anaphora, and it is important to note that it is not\nstipulated, but is entailed by the semantics of the DRS\nlanguage. [6c1] is accessible to [6c2] because\nevery embedding function that must be considered for [6c2]\nis an extension of an embedding function for [6c1], and it\nis for this reason that every discourse referent in [6c1]\nis also defined in [6c2]. The converse, however, does not\nhold. Like negated sentences, conditionals give rise to complex\nDRS-conditions, too. (7) gives an example: [7b] is the sentence DRS which corresponds to [7a], and assuming\nfor convenience that this sentence is uttered in an empty context, it\nis also the initial DRS of the discourse. The complex condition in\nthis structure is interpreted as follows: if f is to verify\n[7b1] in the current model,\nthen f(x) must be an\nindividual called “Pedro”, and every extension\nof f which verifies [7b2] must itself be extendable\nto a function that verifies [7b3]. It follows from this that\n[7b1] is accessible to [7b2], which in its turn is\naccessible to [7b3], and\ntherefore v may be linked up\nto x (accessibility being a\ntransitive relation) and w\nto y.  The result is [7c], which\nis equivalent to [7d], both DRSs saying that Pedro beats every donkey\nhe owns.\n The interpretation of quantified donkey sentences is very similar\nto what we have just seen: There are two ways of spelling out the interpretation of\nso-called duplex conditions of the\nform K(∀x)K′. On its\nweak interpretation, [8a] means that every farmer who owns a donkey\nbeats at least one of the donkeys he owns; on its strong\ninterpretation the sentence says that every farmer beats every donkey\nhe owns. While the strong reading is the most natural choice for [8a],\nother donkey sentences prefer a weak reading: The most likely interpretation for [9] to have is that every\ntractor-owning farmer uses one of their tractors to drive to church. The distinction between weak and strong interpretations is somewhat\nmysterious, because it doesn’t seem to be an ordinary ambiguity. For\nexample, donkey sentences with existential quantifiers don’t seem to\nlicense strong readings: This can only be construed as saying that some donkey-owning\nfarmers beat at least one of their donkeys. More generally, the\nuniversally quantified donkey sentences seem to be the only ones to\nlicense both interpretations. It is not entirely clear why this should\nbe the case (see Kanazawa 1994, Geurts 2002). Whether weak or strong, the interpretation of a condition of the\nform K(Qx)K′,\nwhere Q may be any quantifier,\nmakes K accessible\nto K′, and in this respect\n(which is the fulcrum of the DRT analysis) conditionals and quantified\nsentences are the same. Consequently, the discourse\nreferents x\nand y in [8b2] are\naccessible to v\nand w in [8b3], and the\nlatter may be equated to the former.  The resulting representation is\n[8c], which is equivalent to [8d]. The DRT analysis of quantified expressions like “all”\nor “most” is fairly standard. A quantifier binds a\nvariable and delivers the truth conditions one should\nexpect. Indefinites are different. An indefinite like “a\ndonkey” is treated not as a quantifier but simply as device for\nintroducing a discourse referent and one or more conditions; on the\nDRT account, indefinites have no quantifying force of their own. What\nquantifying force they seem to have is not theirs, but derives from\nthe environment in which they occur. If the semantic material\nassociated with “a donkey” is introduced in the main DRS,\nas in [4c], the quantifying effect will be existential, owing to the\nfact that this DRS is verified in a model M iff there\nis a way of verifying it in M. If the semantic\nmaterial associated with “a donkey” is introduced in the\nantecedent of a conditional, as in [7d], the quantifying effect will\nbe universal, owing to the fact that a\ncondition of the form K⇒K′ is\nverified in M iff every way of\nverifying K can be extended to a\nway of verifying K′. This\nview on indefinites lies at the heart of DRT. DRT was one of the first semantic theories to go beyond the\nsentence boundary, and take into account how the interpretation of an\nexpression may depend on the preceding discourse. Looking back at the\nexamples discussed in the foregoing, we see that, if the DRT approach\nis on the right track, sentence boundaries are not as important as the\nFregean (or Chomskyan) conception of language would have it. In particular, there is\nessentially no difference between the DRT analysis of cross-sentential\nanaphora, as exemplified by the mini-discourse [2]-[3a], and\nsentence-internal anaphora, as in [7a] or [9a]. In either case, the\npronoun simply serves to pick up an accessible discourse\nreferent. This raises the question of how DRT’s new-fangled notion of\nanaphora relates to the dichotomy between referential and\nbound-variable pronouns.  Curiously, this issue doesn’t seem to have\nreceived much attention yet. In the foregoing we assumed that the contribution of a sentence to\nthe discourse, as represented by a DRS, was obtained in two steps. In\nthe first one, a sentence DRS was constructed in a compositional way;\nthis part of the construction process we took for granted, but its\nimplementation wouldn’t be too difficult. In the second step, the\nsentence DRS was merged with the DRS representing the prior discourse,\nand anaphoric references were resolved. This two-stage procedure has\nbecome the industrial standard, but the original version of DRT (Kamp\n1981, Kamp and Reyle 1993) was monostratal in the sense that one set\nof rules took care of both tasks at once. In the meantime, Kamp and\nhis co-workers have adopted the two-step method, too (e.g., Kamp et\nal.  2011). In one-level versions of DRT, a single set of rules is used to\nobtain the semantic contribution of a sentence. To take a simple\nexample, if the sentence is “It is grey”, the first rule\nto apply will say that the semantic correlate of the subject is an\nargument to the predicate expressed by “is grey”. Then the\ntwo main parts of the sentence are analysed further, and the pronoun\n“it” triggers a rule which at once deals with the\npronoun’s lexical content and its context dependence; i.e., it says\nthat we must select a new discourse referent, link it to a discourse\nreferent made available by the preceding discourse, and update the DRS\nso as to record these changes. In two-level versions of DRT there is\nno such rule. Its duties are divided between two separate\nmechanisms. In the first stage, a separate DRS is constructed for the\nsentence, in which pronouns prompt the introduction of new discourse\nreferents that are marked as being anaphoric (we use underlining for\nthis purpose). In the second stage, there is a general mechanism for\ndealing with discourse referents thus marked. The distinction between one- and two-level versions of DRT is of\ninterest for at least two reasons. First, once we go beyond basic DRT,\nthe two-stage system may actually be more economical overall. For\nexample, if DRT is extended for dealing with presuppositions (see\nSection 5), the one-pass approach becomes unwieldy. Secondly, and\nperhaps more importantly, two-stage theories may be viewed as\nimplementing a distinction between semantics and pragmatics which has\nsome prima facie plausibility: in the first stage a representation is\ncomputed which is projected from the sentence’s lexico-grammatical\nstructure, while in the second stage, context-dependent aspects of\nmeaning are dealt with.  This division of labor is reminiscent of the\ntraditional dichotomy between compositional semantics and\nnon-compositional pragmatics, but it should be noted that the two do\nnot coincide. Usually, the “semantical” part of a\ntwo-stage version of DRT is not compositional in the Fregean sense,\nbecause its output is essentially incomplete; it may contain anaphoric\n“gaps”, for example. Therefore, even if a sentence DRS\nadmits of a truth-conditional interpretation, it will typically fall\nshort of capturing everything that is conventionally thought to belong\nto truth-conditional content. In this section we give a more precise description of the DRS\nlanguage than we have done so far. We define the syntax of the\nlanguage, present a model-theoretic interpretation, and discuss the\nnotion of accessibility, which figures so prominently in DRT’s account\nof anaphora. DRSs are set-theoretic objects built from discourse\nreferents and DRS-conditions.  A\nDRS-condition is either atomic, in which case it consists of a\npredicate and a suitable number of discourse referents, or complex, in\nwhich case it embeds one or two DRSs. Hence, the definition of the DRS\nlanguage is by simultaneous recursion: DRSs and DRS-conditions Note that there are no conditions corresponding to conjoined\nsentences. Such sentences are dealt with, rather, by merging the DRSs\nassociated with their parts, where the merge of two DRSs\nK and\nK′\nis defined as their pointwise union: DRS-merge The merge operation is also used for combining a sentence DRS with\nthe DRS representing the preceding discourse, so the idea is that\nthere is no principled distinction between (clausal) conjunction and\nsentence concatenation (see Muskens 1996 for discussion). Officially, DRSs are set-theoretical objects, but in this article\nwe use a linear notation. Many sources, including Kamp’s own work,\nemploy a graphical “box notation” which is sometimes\nclearer, but less parsimonious and more difficult to type. To\nillustrate the various schemes, here are three ways of representing\nthe content of a conditional donkey sentence: The choice between these formats is one of convenience, and does\nnot have any theoretical significance. Accessibility is a relation between DRSs that is transitive and\nreflexive, i.e., it is a preorder. More in particular, it is the\nsmallest preorder for which the following holds, for all\nDRSs K, K′,\nand K″:\nif ConK\ncontains a condition of the form … To illustrate, in the following schematic representations, every\nDRS is accessible to all and only those DRSs whose number doesn’t\nprecede its own (so every DRS is accessible to itself): The accessible domain of a\nDRS K, AK,\nis the set of discourse referents that occur in\nsome K′ that is accessible\nto K,\ni.e., AK =\n{x:  K′ is accessible\nto K\nand x\n∈ UK′}.\nThe main constraint which DRT imposes on the interpretation of\nanaphora is this: Accessibility constraint \nA pronoun is represented by a discourse\nreferent x which must be equated\nto some discourse referent y\n∈ AK,\nwhere K is the DRS in\nwhich x is introduced. It is important to note that neither the notion of accessibility\nnor the accessibility constraint need be stipulated. For, as we will\npresently see, both follow from the way the DRS language is\ninterpreted (cf. the notion of variable binding in standard predicate\nlogic).  Thus, we are not at liberty to modify the accessibility\nrelation, should we wish to do so, unless we simultaneously revise the\ntruth conditions associated with the DRS language. The accessibility\nconstraint is a semantic one. As discussed in Section 2, the main syntactic constraint on\nbound-variable pronouns is that they be c-commanded by their\nantecedents. The domain of the accessibility constraint overlaps with\nthat of the c-command constraint, but it is wider. For one thing,\nsentence boundaries don’t affect accessibility. For another, within\nthe confines of a sentence, the semantic correlate of an\nexpression E1 may be accessible to that\nof E2, even if E1 doesn’t\nc-command E2.  To illustrate this point, consider\nthe conditional donkey sentence in [1a] and its sentence DRS in\n[1b]: Syntactically speaking, neither “a farmer” nor “a\ndonkey” can bind (in the sense of Chomsky 1986) an expression\nbeyond the smallest clause in which they occur. In particular, neither\ncan bind any of the pronouns in the main clause of [1a]. But the\ndiscourse referents associated with these indefinites,\ni.e., x\nand y, are in the accessible\ndomain of [1b3], and therefore the anaphoric discourse\nreferents in this embedded DRS can be linked\nto x\nand y. Put otherwise, they are\nbindable at a semantic but not at a syntactic level. The truth-conditional semantics of the DRS language is given by\ndefining when an embedding function verifies a DRS in\na given model. An embedding function is a partial mapping from\ndiscourse referents to individuals. Given two embedding\nfunctions f and g and a\nDRS K, we say that g\nextends f with respect\nto K,\nor f[K]g for\nshort, iff Dom(g) = Dom(f)\n∪ UK, and\nfor all x\nin Dom(f): f(x)\n= g(x).  Viewing\nfunctions as set-theoretic objects, this can be formulated more\nsuccinctly as follows:\n In the following we define what it takes for an embedding function\nto verify a DRS or DRS-condition in a given model. As usual, a\nmodel M is a pair <D,I>, where D is a\nset of individuals, and I is an interpretation function that\nassigns sets of individuals to one-place predicates, sets of pairs to\ntwo-place predicates, and so on. To enhance the legibility of our\ndefinition somewhat we omit the qualifier “in M”\nthroughout: Verifying embeddings The last clause gives a strong interpretation to universal duplex\nconditions (cf. Section 3.2); the weak interpretation is obtainable as\nfollows: A DRS is true in a given model iff we can find a verifying\nembedding for it, as follows: Truth A DRS K is true in a\nmodel M iff there is an embedding function f such\nthat Dom(f) =\n UK\n and f verifies\nK in M. To see how accessibility follows from these definitions, the\ncritical junctures are the points at which extensions of embedding\nfunctions are called for. For example, consider a schematic DRS with a\nconditional in it: This DRS is true iff we can find an embedding\nfunction f, Dom(f) =\n{x}, which verifies all conditions\nin [2], which is to say\nthat f(x) must be\nan A, and f verifies the\ncomplex condition [y: B(x,y)] ⇒ [z:\nC(x,y,z)].  The latter requirement is met iff every\nextension g of f, Dom(g)\n= {x,y}, such that g\nverifies [y: B(x,y)] can be\nextended to a function h, Dom(h)\n= {x,y,z}, such that h\nverifies [z: C(x,y,z)]. Hence, no\nmatter how we\nchoose g, g(x)\nmust be the same individual\nas f(x), and for\nany g, no matter how we\nchoose h, h(x)\nand h(y) must be the same\nas g(x)\nand g(y),\nrespectively. This is why x is in\nthe accessible domain associated with the antecedent of the\nconditional, and why y is in the\naccessible domain associated with the consequent. Having focussed thus far on the interpretation of anaphoric\npronouns, the purpose of this section is to illustrate how the ideas\nlying at the heart of DRT have been applied to other phenomena. We\nwill restrict ourselves to three topics: tense, presupposition, and\npropositional attitudes. In the first two cases, we will encounter\ninterpretative dependencies reminiscent of the dependency relation\nbetween an anaphor and its antecedent, and we will describe, if only\nin outline, how basic DRT has been extended so as to capture the\nsimilarities. DRT’s representationalism comes into its own in its\ntreatment of attitudes and attitude ascriptions, which is the third\ntopic on our list. In section 6 we introduce SDRT, a significant extension of the DRT framework designed to model discourse structure more accurately. In the early 1970s, it was pointed out that there are systematic\nparallels between tenses and pronouns (Partee 1973), and DRT was\npartly born from the conviction that a theory of interpretation should\naccount for these parallels. Partee (1984) herself worked out some of\nthese ideas in the DRT framework. In the following we will briefly\ndiscuss some of Partee’s observations, and outline a DRT\ntreatment. Intuitively, the indefinite description “a donkey” in\nthe opening sentence of [1a] serves to introduce an entity that is\nsubsequently picked up by the pronoun “it” in the second\nsentence, and the DRT account of indefinites and pronouns seeks to\nformalize this intuitive picture. [1b] shows that a very similar\nphenomenon occurs in the temporal domain, for in this case it is\nnatural to construe the past tense of the second sentence as being\nanaphorically dependent on the content of the first: presumably,\nJuanita slapped Pedro right after he tried to kiss her. In order to\ncapture this idea, DRT adopts an event-based semantics, treating\nevents as semantic values of a designated class of discourse\nreferents. Sentences are now construed like indefinite descriptions in\nthat they, too, serve to introduce discourse referents. For example,\nthe first sentence in [1b] introduces a discourse referent of the\nevent type that represents Pedro’s attempting to kiss Juanita, and the\ntense morpheme in “slapped” is construed as referring\nback, very much like an anaphoric pronoun, to that event: by default,\nthe time of Juanita’s slapping Pedro will be taken to be immediately\nafter the time of him trying to kiss her. Our second example involves what one might call “donkey\ntense”: In an event-based semantics, it is natural to construe [2b] as\nquantifying over events, just like [2a] quantifies over\nindividuals. In conjunction with the DRT treatment of quantification,\nthis allows us to interpret the tense in “slapped” as\nreferring back to the event introduced in the subordinate clause,\nalong the following lines (where ⊃⊂ stands for\nthe “right after”\nrelation, e″ is the variable\nintroduced by the tense in “slapped”,\nand e″ indicates\nthat e″ requires an\nantecedent): In [3a] the tense introduces an anaphoric element, which can be\nbound in the restrictor of the quantifier, just as an ordinary donkey\npronoun might be bound. The result, after a minor simplification, is\n[3b], which says that every event e of Pedro trying to kiss Juanita is\nimmediately followed by an event e′ of her slapping him. Note\nthat, although this DRS captures the most natural interpretation of\nthe past tense in “slapped”, it leaves the past tense in\n“tried” unaccounted for. But this is as it should be, for\nif tense is anaphoric, then that tense, too, should be linked to a\nsalient time point, which seems to be right: in the absence of a\ncontext that furnishes such a time, [2b] is simply infelicitous; it is\nlike saying “He is handsome” when it is not clear whom the\npronoun is intended to refer to. Presuppositions are chunks of information associated with\nparticular lexical items or syntactic constructions. There are many\nsuch items and constructions, and the following is just a small\nselection:  Factive verbs It-clefts Definites Someone who utters any of the [a] sentences commits himself to the\ntruth of the respective [b] sentence. Of course, this does nothing to\ndistinguish presuppositions from ordinary entailments, but the\ndifference becomes apparent when we embed presuppositional expressions\nor constructions in non-entailing environments, as in: Here [5a] is embedded in the scope of a negation and a modal\noperator, respectively, and it appears that these sentences commit a\nspeaker to the truth of [5b] just as much as [5a] does. This behavior\nsets presuppositions apart from ordinary entailments. Generally speaking, presuppositions tend to escape\nfrom any embedded position in the sense that, if a\nsentence S contains a presupposition-inducing\nexpression P, an utterance of S will usually imply\nthat P holds. This is only generally speaking, because this\nrule, though correct in the majority of cases, does not hold without\nexceptions: While the [a] sentences would normally commit a speaker to the\nclaim that Pedro has a donkey, the same does not hold for the [b]\nsentences.  It appears, therefore, that presuppositions are typically\nthough not invariably inherited by the sentences in which they\noccur. This is the so-called “projection problem” for\npresuppositions. Considering that anaphora and presupposition were widely discussed\nfrom the late 1960s onwards, it took a remarkably long time before it\nwas discovered that, in some respects at least, the two phenomena are\nvery similar (van der Sandt 1992, Kripke 2009). To see how, consider\nthe following pairs: It is true that the variants with the\n“that”-complements are slightly odd, but actually the fact\nthat they are proves the point we want to make; for it is clear that,\nin these examples, the pronoun “it” and the clause\n“that he owns a donkey” perform the same duty, and if the\nlatter sounds somewhat off it is presumably because the former does\nthe job just as well. While the factive verb “know” triggers the\npresupposition that its clausal complement is true, this\npresupposition is neutralized in [10b] and [10c]. If presuppositions\nbehave similarly to anaphoric pronouns, it is clear why that should be\nso: in both cases, the presupposition is bound\nsentence-internally, just like the neuter pronoun is bound. Presupposed information is information that is presented as given,\nand according to the so-called “binding theory” of\npresupposition this means that presuppositions want to have discourse\nreferents to bind to (van der Sandt 1992, Geurts 1999).  However,\nwhereas anaphoric pronouns are rarely interpretable in the absence of\na suitable antecedent, the same does not hold for all\npresupposition-inducing expressions. For instance, a speaker may\nfelicitously assert that he met “Pedro’s sister” even if\nhe knows full well that his audience wasn’t aware that Pedro has a\nsister. In such cases, Karttunen (1974) and Stalnaker (1974)\nsuggested, presuppositions are\ngenerally accommodated, which is to say that the\nhearer accepts the information as given, and revises his\nrepresentation of the context accordingly. Accommodation, thus\nunderstood, is a form of exploitation in Grice’s sense: the purpose of\npresuppositional expressions is to signal that this or that\ninformation is given, and if some information is new but not\nparticularly interesting or controversial (like the fact that somebody\nhas a sister) the speaker may choose to “get it out of the\nway” by presuppositional means. The binding theory incorporates the notion of accommodation as\nfollows. Presuppositions, according to the theory, introduce\ninformation that prefers to be linked to discourse referents that are\nalready available in the DRS, and in this respect they are like\npronouns. However, if a suitable discourse referent is not available,\na new one will be accommodated, and the presupposition is linked to\nthat.  Generally speaking, accommodation is not an option in the\ninterpretation of pronouns, and a possible reason for this is that a\npronoun’s descriptive content is relatively poor. Being told that\n“she” is wonderful is not particularly helpful if it isn’t\nclear who the pronoun is meant to refer to. By contrast, if the\nspeaker refers to “Pedro’s sister” there is more to go on,\nand accommodation becomes feasible. Hence, the binding theory views\npronouns as a special class of presuppositional expressions. While all\npresupposition triggers prefer to be bound, pronouns almost always\nmust be bound. According to the binding theory, this is because\npronouns are descriptively attenuated, and therefore cannot be\nconstrued by way of accommodation. Propositional attitudes (mental states like belief, desire, or\nimagination) and attitude ascriptions (sentences like “John\nthinks/hopes that Mary likes him”) have been a rich source of\nphilosophical puzzles. DRT’s representationalism offers fresh\nsolutions to some of them. A central issue in the treatment of attitudes is that of logical\nomniscience: humans are cognitively limited agents, and are not aware\nof all the consequences of their beliefs and desires. On this basis,\nKamp (1990) argues that the objects of thought should not be seen as\npurely model-theoretic entities, for example a set of belief worlds,\nas is common in logics of belief from Hintikka (1962) onwards. Rather,\nthe logic of belief and other attitudes must involve structured mental\nrepresentations. The problem of logical omniscience is then resolved\nin terms of the failure of human agents to perform logically complete\ncomputations over these representations. Modeling the objects of\nattitudes in this way, as representational entities, allows us to make\nthe fine distinctions necessary to distinguish between believing that\nit is raining and believing that if it is not raining then 37 is not\nprime. However, traditional versions of such a sententialist or\nLanguage-of-Thought approach to omniscience typically run into the\nproblem of intentionality: to be useful to us, our attitudes must\nsomehow be about the external world we live in, so we still have to\nexplain how these syntactic representations connect with reality. In a\nHintikka-style possible worlds semantics the link between world and\nattitude is hardwired into the semantics: believing that John is happy\nmeans that the agent takes the actual world to be an element of the\nset of worlds where John is happy. The DRT approach combines these two\nstrategies: use the classic, model-theoretic semantics of the DRS\nlanguage to cash out intentionality in terms of possible worlds, but\nhold on to the representational level to model resource-bounded\ncomputations in practical reasoning.  A special type of intentionality is that of singular or de\nre attitudes: beliefs and desires that directly involve objects\nthe attitude holder is acquainted with. To capture such attitudes,\nKamp (1990) introduces anchors. An internal anchor is a descriptive\nmode of presentation, in the form of a DRS with a distinguished\ndiscourse referent, while an external anchor maps that discourse\n  referent to an actual individual. A full-fledged entity representation comprises an internal and an external anchor, and is a construct closely related to the Mental Files of Recanati (2012) and other neo-Fregean approaches to reference. A complete mental state\nrepresentation then consists of (i) a set of internal anchors and\nattitude descriptions, each consisting of a DRS paired with a mode\nindicator (e.g., ANCH, \nBEL, \nDES) and possibly sharing discourse\nreferents, and (ii) an external anchor mapping the internally anchored\ndiscourse referents to objects of acquaintance. By way of\nillustration, the mental state representation below describes\nmy de re belief that this cup c I’m holding now\ncontains coffee, along with the desire that it is still warm: Compartmentalized mental state representations like this have been\nturned into semantic theories of attitude ascriptions and used to\nsolve a variety of familiar puzzles, such as those involving Kripke’s\n(1979) Pierre who believes Londres is pretty but London is not (Asher\n1986, Kamp 2015), Geach’s (1967) Hob who believes a witch killed his\ncow while Nob believes she, the same witch, blighted his mare (Asher\n1987), specific indefinites (Kamp and Bende-Farkas 2019), presupposition projection out of\n(non-doxastic) attitude ascriptions (Maier 2015), and referring to fictional entities (Maier 2017). Not all DRT treatments of attitude reports rely on a\nrepresentational theory of the underlying mental states\nthemselves. For example, Geurts (1999) and Maier (2010) develop\nanalyses of attitude ascriptions in versions of DRT that use only a\nstandard Hintikka-style possible worlds semantics for attitudes. In\nthe same vein, Maier (2009) and Hunter (2013) explore extensions of\nDRT to deal with directly referential expressions like indexicals and\nproper names without resorting to anchors or mental state\nrepresentations. We’ve seen in sections 3 and 4 above how anaphora resolution\nis constrained by accessibility. But there are many other factors that play a role in\nthe resolution process, from local, grammatical factors like subject\nantecedents being generally more prominent than object antecedents in pronoun\nresolution, to more global, discourse structural factors. Focusing on the latter,\nHobbs (1979) argues that the interpreter’s desire to create a maximally coherent\ninterpretation will often play a decisive role in choosing between multiple\naccessible antecedents for a pronoun, as he illustrates with the following contrast: In [1a] the pronoun binds to John, because that delivers the most coherent\ninterpretation of the two-sentence discourse as a whole. In [1b], by contrast, the\npronoun is bound to Bill. This difference corresponds to a difference in the kind of\ncoherence relations exemplified by the two discourses: [1a] exemplifies a coherence\nrelation known as Elaboration, while [1b] is an instance of Result. That discourse\nrelations play an important role in discourse interpretation is shown by examples like\n  [2] (again from Hobbs 1979).  Reading [2] you might wonder if Turkish spinach is really that much better than\nwhat you can get in France, which shows to what lengths we go to accommodate a\nsuitable coherence relation, in this case Explanation, before we give up our quest for\n  a coherent interpretation.    Asher and Lascarides (2003) take the idea that pronoun resolution and the\ninference of coherence relations between discourse units are closely related processes\nas the starting point for their Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT),\ncombining DRT with insights from discourse coherence theories like Hobbs’s. SDRT\nassumes a set of discourse relations (Narration, Result, Contrast, Explanation,\nElaboration, Correction, to name a few) that we may infer to connect the\npropositions expressed by the individual sentences (or clauses), in order to create a\nmaximally coherent interpretation of the discourse as a whole. Different discourse\nrelations may impose different constraints on anaphora resolution over and\nabove DRT’s accessibility. Take the example in [3] (Asher and Lascarides\n  2003). In standard DRT the salmon introduced in [3c] would provide a suitable and\naccessible antecedent for the pronoun in [3f], but in fact this resolution appears to be\nunavailable. SDRT explains this observation in terms of a discourse structural\nconstraint known as the Right Frontier Constraint. This constraint is best illustrated\nby drawing a discourse structure graph like the one below. A horizontal arrow in this\ngraph indicates a coordinating discourse relation (where neither relatum dominates\nthe other), in this case Narration. A vertical arrow indicates a subordinating\ndiscourse relation (where a nucleus dominates a satellite), in this case Elaboration.\n SDRT’s version of the Right Frontier Constraint says that the pronoun in [3f] can\nonly find an antecedent introduced in the node that was just introduced ([3e]), or one\n  that dominates it ([3a]).    More formally, an SDRS consists of such a discourse structure graph, where each\nvertex corresponds to a discourse relation and each node to a DRS. A common SDRS\nnotation extends the familiar box notation of DRT (see section 4) with labels for\n  elementary and complex discourse units: Anaphora and presupposition resolution rely on a modified notion of\naccessibility that incorporates the Right Frontier Constraint. The\nmodel-theoretic interpretation of an SDRS is built around a set of\nspecial interpretation rules for the various discourse\nrelations. Narration for instance comes with a semantic interpretation\nrule that states that the both relata hold and moreover the main\nevents they introduce stand in a relation of temporal\nprogression. Some notational\nshortcuts: Kπ is the DRS\nassociated with label π (i.e. the K such\nthat π : K occurs somewhere in the\nSDRS); eπ is the unique event\ndiscourse referent that occurs\nin U(Kπ) (for readability\nwe left out event referents from the example SDRS above, but for the purpose of modelling narrative temporal progression in SDRT we should treat every verb phrase as introducing an event discourse referent). Note that conditions of the form πn : K are not interpreted directly as semantic conditions on their own, but instead serve to associate DRS contents with\n proposition labels. DRT is a representational theory of interpretation. In the DRT\nframework, sentences have meanings, if at all, only in a derivative\nsense: a sentence prompts the hearer to modify his DRS, and it is DRSs\nthat have a truth-conditional interpretation. Thus, a sentence causes\na DRS Ki to be\ntransformed into a\nDRS Ki+1 (usually,\nthough not invariably, the process will consist in adding information\nto Ki), and at a remove\nthere is an associated transition at the semantical level,\nfrom Ki’s\ninterpretation\nto Ki+1’s.  Hence, if\nwe could cut out the representational middleman, we would have a\ntheory that defines sentence meaning in dynamic terms, as a transition\nfrom one semantic object to another. Thus arises the question of\nwhether or not the representational level can be dispensed with. Kamp\n(1981) claimed that representations were essential to\nhis ur-version of DRT, which was a subset of our\nbasic DRT, but in the meantime he was proved wrong by a slew of\ndynamic theories that recast classical DRT in purely semantical terms:\nBarwise (1987), Rooth (1987), Groenendijk and Stokhof (1989, 1991),\nMuskens (1996), and many more. However, Kamp’s claim still holds for\nvarious extensions of classical DRT, like the theories of\npresupposition and attitude ascription discussed in the foregoing. These theories are allegedly “non-representational”,\nbut what exactly does that mean? Consider, for example, Groenendijk\nand Stokhof’s (1991) Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL), which provides a\ndynamic semantics for the language of classical predicate logic, in\nwhich “Pedro owns a donkey and beats it” may be rendered\nas follows: DPL’s semantics ensures that, unlike in classical logic, the last\noccurrence of x is bound by the existential quantifier. The\nway this works is that DPL analyzes sentence meanings in terms of\nvariable assignments, which are manipulated by the logical constants\nin such as way that [1] is true in a model M iff M’s\ndomain features an individual which, when assigned to the\nvariable x, makes each of the atomic sentences in [1] come\nout true in M. Formally, this is implemented by stipulating\nthat the meaning of a sentence is a relation between variable\nassignments. A variable assignment is a mapping from variables to individuals,\nand variables are linguistic expressions, so it can hardly be claimed\nthat assignments are non-representational entities. Therefore, it is a\nbit puzzling that, in contrast to DRT, DPL is widely seen as a\nnon-representational variety of dynamic semantics. True, DRT’s\nrepresentationalism goes quite a bit further than DPL’s, and the two\ntheories are obviously very different in this respect, but both\ntheories import representational elements into semantics, and this\nholds for dynamic theories of semantics generally (though see Dekker\n2012 for exceptions). Note, incidentally, that DRT’s representationalism is not\nparticularly troubling from a psychological point of view. For if we\nadopt a cognitivist perspective, and view DRT as a (somewhat abstract)\ntheory of the psychology of interpretation, then its\nrepresentationalism wouldn’t be particularly controversial, since for\nmost psychologists, the controversy is not over whether there exist\nmental representations, but over what they are like.  One way in which DRT’s representationalism manifests itself as\nbeing more radical than other theories’ is that it is a\nnon-compositional theory as well. These two features are intertwined.\nConsider, for instance, the way pronouns are interpreted in basic DRT,\nby first setting up a discourse referent, which is subsequently linked\nto another discourse referent. This is a non-deterministic process,\nbut even if it were not, it is clear that the anaphoric link is not\npart of the meaning of the pronoun. A standard statement of\ncompositionality would say that the meaning of a compound expression\nmust be a function of the meaning of their components and their mode\nof combination. But if some of the components, like pronouns, do not\nintroduce into the DRS any object that can naturally be described as\nthe meaning of that object, then it is clear that we do not have a\ncompositional system. How bad is it that we lose compositionality? It is generally agreed\nthat some of the standard arguments for compositionality are not\nparticularly compelling. In particular, we don’t need compositionality\nto explain why people can understand an indefinite number of\nsentences, and we don’t need it for explaining how languages can be\nlearned. To explain such facts, it suffices that there is some\nprocedure for establishing the meanings of sentences, but it is not\nstrictly necessary for this procedure to be compositional.\nCompositionality is often viewed as a methodological principle\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1989, 1991; Janssen 1997; Dever 1999), since\nany model of interpretation can be made compositional if we are\nsufficiently relaxed about the nature of lexical meanings and/or the\nsyntactic structures over which the compositional theory is\ndefined. In the case of DRT, the standard approaches to making the\nsystem compositional involve dispensing with Kamp’s construction\nalgorithm, and replacing it with a system in which DRSs can be\ncomposed either through suitable merge operations (Zeevat 1989b), or,\nin dynamic semantic systems like those of Groenendijk and Stokhof\n(1989) and Muskens (1996), through use of function application in a\nlambda calculus. But while most such systems capture meanings for\nsentences that are closely related to those of original DRT, they do\nnot capture every aspect of DRT. In particular, whereas anaphora\nresolution is an integral part of DRT, in compositional theories anaphora resolution is\nassumed to be performed by a separate component of the theory. Representationalism and compositionality are issues that have\nproduced great disagreement amongst semanticists and philosophers of\nlanguage, though less so nowadays than they did in the 1980s. The\nmethodological view of compositionality has reduced what appeared once\nto be a substantive argument to a matter of taste, and as regards DRT\nit has been shown that researchers who care about compositionality are\nfree to adopt a variant of the original system with many of its\nfeatures, but none of its non-compositionality. But\nrepresentationalism may be a more serious issue, for if it is true, as\nwe have suggested, that dynamic theories generally rely on a notion of\nmeaning that contains at least some form of representation, then that\nnotion could do with a bit more philosophical attention than it has\nreceived so far.

The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, are\nthat it is a mentalist and representationalist theory of\ninterpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not only\nof individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respects\nDRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which during\nthe 1970s had emanated from Montague’s pioneering work (Thomason\n1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in its\nuse of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve\nas a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will\nconfine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense,\npresupposition, and propositional attitudes. For references to work on\nother topics, see the “Further reading” section.\n\n This article concerns Discourse Representation Theory narrowly\ndefined as work in the tradition descending from Kamp (1981). The same\nterm is sometimes used more broadly, occasionally embracing Heim’s\n(1982) work and the developments initiated by Groenendijk and Stokhof\n(1989, 1991). However, the more common common label for the extended\nDRT family is “dynamic semantics”, and that is the term we\nwill use, too. Two features that set DRT apart from other varieties of dynamic\nsemantics is that it is representational and non-compositional. In the\n1980s, the founding years of dynamic semantics, these features made\nDRT a controversial theory, though by now those controversies have\nabated. DRT’s main innovation, beyond the Montagovian paradigm which\nwas then considered orthodox, is that it introduced a level of mental\nrepresentations, called “discourse representation\nstructures” (DRSs). The basic idea is rather straightforward. It\nis that a hearer builds up a mental representation of the discourse as\nit unfolds, and that every incoming sentence prompts additions to that\nrepresentation. This picture has always been commonplace in the\npsychology of language. DRT’s principal tenet is that it should be the\nstarting point for semantic theory, too. A theory of the DRT family consists of the following\ningredients: Technically, this is very similar to earlier work in formal\nsemantics, with two exceptions: the interpretation process always\ntakes the previous discourse into account, and the level of semantic\nrepresentations is claimed to be essential. What has worried some\nsemanticists is not so much the fact that DRSs are mental\nrepresentations, but that an additional level is needed, and used in\nways that render the theory non-compositional; we will return to this\nissue in Section 7. The relationship between a pronoun and its antecedent is one that\nhas received a great deal of attention in linguistics and philosophy.\nWe say that a pronoun is anaphoric, as opposed to deictic, for\nexample, if it depends for its interpretation on an antecedent\nexpression elsewhere in the sentence or the discourse. In some cases\nthe nature of this dependency seems straightforward: (Here and henceforth we use underlining to highlight the anaphoric\nlinks we are currently interested in.) Since “Pedro” is a\nreferential expression, it makes sense, in this case, to say that\n“his” is a referential term, too, which derives its\nreference from its antecedent.  This construal is plausible enough,\nbut it doesn’t apply across the board: The term “no farmer” is not a referential expression,\nso “his” cannot be coreferential with it. Rather, it would\nseem that, in this case, the relationship between the pronoun and its\nantecedent is one of binding, in the logical sense of\nthe word: “no farmer” and “his” are\ninterpreted as a quantifier and a variable, respectively, and the\nformer binds the latter. It is fairly obvious that the bound-variable construal of pronouns\nis subject to syntactic constraints. Most importantly, this type of\ninterpretation requires that the pronoun\nbe c-commanded by its antecedent, where c-command is\ndefined as follows: The constituent structure of sentence [2] is [S\n[NP No farmer][VP beat [NP his\ndonkey]]]. Here the pronoun is contained in the sister of its\nantecedent, so the c-command constraint is met. In [3] “no\nfarmer” does not c-command “his”, and so we predict,\ncorrectly, that the pronoun cannot be bound. Since the syntactic structure of [1] is identical to that of [2],\nwe might wonder if the pronoun in [1] may not be bound by its\nantecedent, just as in [2]. If this were possible, there would be two\nways of construing the pronoun in [1]: it could function either as a\nreferential term or as a bound variable. There is evidence that this is\nindeed the case: [4a] is ambiguous in a way [4b] is not. Its second conjunct can be\nconstrued as saying either that Juan beats his own donkey or that Juan\nbeats Pedro’s donkey. The second conjunct of [4b], by contrast, can\nonly be interpreted as saying that Juan beats his own donkey. If the\npossessive pronoun in the first conjunct of [4a] can be either\nreferential or a bound variable, the contrast is readily\nexplained. In large part, the motivation for developing dynamic theories of\ninterpretation, beginning with DRT, was the realization that the\ndichotomy between referential and bound-variable (occurrences of)\npronouns is less natural than one might think—less natural in\nthe sense that some pronouns don’t fit comfortably in either\ncategory. What is the relationship between “it” in the second\nsentence and its antecedent expression in the first? On the one hand,\nit cannot be coreference. If the pronoun were coreferential with its\nantecedent, the indefinite “a donkey” would have to be a\nreferential term, which seems unlikely, e.g., because the negation of\n[5a] says not that there is a donkey that Pedro fails to own, but\nrather that he doesn’t own any donkey, and furthermore, if [5a] is\nnegated, the anaphoric link between the pronoun and its antecedent is\nsevered: (The asterisk indicates that the sentence is infelicitous if\n“a donkey” is to be interpreted as the antecedent of\n“it”.) Observations like these suggest rather strongly\nthat indefinites are quantifiers rather than referential\nterms. However, if we construe “a donkey” as an\nexistential quantifier, how does it manage to bind the pronoun across\na sentence boundary? The problem with [5] is related to the fact that the pronoun and\nits indefinite antecedent occur in different sentences. The following\nexamples show, however, that similar problems arise within\nsentences: These are the infamous “donkey sentences” that were\nalready discussed by scholastic philosophers, and in modern times were\nreintroduced into philosophy by Geach (1962). In these cases it is\nobvious that the pronouns don’t refer, so they can’t be coreferential\nwith their antecedents, either. Nor are the pronouns bound by their\nantecedents, for they aren’t c-commanded by them. The constituent\nstructure of [7b] is roughly as follows: Whatever the syntactical details, “a donkey” is too\ndeeply embedded for it to c-command “it”. The same goes\nfor [7a]. Hence, the neuter pronouns in [7a,b] cannot be construed as\nbound variables. Another way of showing that donkey pronouns are problematic is by\nconsidering how we might render these sentences in predicate\nlogic. The most obvious interpretation of [7a] is that Pedro beats\nevery donkey he owns, and [7b] is naturally interpreted as claiming\nthat every farmer beats every donkey he owns. (So, somewhat\nsurprisingly, it appears that the indefinites in these sentences have\nuniversal force.) These readings may be captured as follows: So the problem is not that predicate logic fails to capture the\nmeanings of [7a] and [7b]. The problem is, rather, how to derive [9a]\nand [9b] from [7a] and [7b] in a principled way. In order to derive\nthese logical forms, we have to assume not only that an indefinite\nexpression buried in a subordinate position ends up having wide scope,\nbut also that it acquires universal force in the process. A theory\nbased on such assumptions might capture the facts, but it would be\nclearly ad hoc, and would generate a host of false predictions, as\nwell. The upshot of the foregoing observations is that, apparently,\nindefinites are neither quantifiers nor referential terms, and this\nproblem entrains another one, for as long as it is unclear what\nindefinites mean, it will also remain obscure how they can serve as\nantecedents to pronouns. Later on we will see that very similar\nproblems arise in seemingly disparate domains, like the interpretation\nof tense and presuppositions. This section introduces DRT in fairly informal terms. We show how a\nhearer builds up a mental model of the ongoing discourse, dealing not\nonly with simple sentences, but also with conditionals,\nquantification, and anaphora, and we discuss DRT’s treatment of\nindefinites, and how they are set apart from quantifying\nexpressions. A discourse representation structure (DRS) is a mental\nrepresentation built up by the hearer as the discourse unfolds. A DRS\nconsists of two parts: a universe of so-called “discourse\nreferents”, which represent the objects under discussion, and a\nset of DRS-conditions which encode the information that has\naccumulated on these discourse referents. The following DRS represents\nthe information that there are two individuals, one of which is a\nfarmer, the other a donkey, and that the former chased the latter: The universe of this DRS contains two discourse\nreferents, x\nand y, and its condition set is\n{farmer(x),\ndonkey(y),\nchased(x,y)}. A DRS like the one in [1] can be given a straightforward\nmodel-theoretic interpretation. In DRT this is done by means\nof embedding functions, which are partial functions\nfrom discourse referents to individuals in a given model M;\nor put otherwise, an embedding function is a partial variable\nassignment. An embedding function f verifies\n[1] in M iff the domain of f includes at\nleast x\nand y, and according to M\nit is the case that f(x)\nis a farmer, f(y) is a\ndonkey, and f(x)\nchased f(y). Meanwhile it will have become clear that the DRS in [1] is designed\nto reflect the intuitive meaning of: Indeed, it is claimed that, in the absence of any information about\nthe context in which this sentence is uttered, [1] is the semantic\nrepresentation of [2]. So the indefinite expressions “a\nfarmer” and “a donkey” prompt the introduction of\ntwo new discourse referents, x\nand y, and contribute the\ninformation that x is a farmer\nand y a donkey, while the verb\ncontributes the information that the former chased the latter. If a discourse begins with an utterance of [2], the DRS in [1] is\nconstructed, and this DRS forms the background against which the next\nutterance is interpreted. Suppose now that [2] is followed by a token\nof [3a]: [3b] is the DRS that reflects the semantic content of [3a] before\nthe pronouns are resolved. In this DRS, the anaphoric pronouns\n“he” and “it” in [3a] are represented by the\ndiscourse referents v\nand w, respectively. These\ndiscourse referents are underlined to indicate that they require an\nantecedent. Since [3a] is uttered in the context of [1], the next step\nin the interpretation of this sentence is to merge the DRS in [3b]\nwith that in [1]. The result of this merging operation is [4a]: Since [3a] is immediately preceded by [2], the antecedent of\n“he” is probably (though not necessarily) “a\nfarmer”, while “it” is anaphorically dependent on\n“a donkey”. At the DRS level, this is represented by equating\nthe discourse referents v\nand w\nwith x\nand y, respectively. These\noperations yield [4b], which is equivalent to [4c].  Either DRS is\nverified in a model M iff M features a farmer who\nchased and caught a donkey. Thus far, we have only considered DRSs with simple conditions, but\nin order to account for negated and conditional sentences, say,\ncomplex conditions are required. [5b] is the sentence DRS corresponding to [5a]. This DRS contains a\ncondition that consists of a DRS prefixed by a negation sign. For ease\nof reference we will sometimes adorn DRSs with numerical labels, as we\nhave done in [5b], and use these in names like\n“[5b1]”, “[5b2]”, and so\non. In general, labeling of DRSs will be top-down and left-to-right,\nso the main (or principal) DRS will always be number one. A function f verifies [5b1] in a\nmodel M iff f\nmaps x onto an individual\nin M which “is a Pedro”, i.e., which is called\n“Pedro”, and f cannot be extended to a\nfunction g which verifies [5b2]. That is to say,\nno such g should map y\nonto a donkey that Pedro owns. [5b2] contains a token of the discourse\nreferent x which is introduced\nexternally, in the DRS in which [5b2] is embedded, i.e.,\n[5b1]. Apart from that, [5b2] also introduces a\ndiscourse referent of its own,\ni.e., y, which is associated with\nthe indefinite NP “a donkey”, and whose scope is delimited\nby [5b2]. Consequently, it doesn’t make sense to refer\nto y outside of [5b2].\nIn DRT, this is taken to explain why the “lifespan” of the\nindividual introduced by the indefinite NP in [5a] is delimited by the\nscope of the negation operator. If [5a] were followed by [6a], for\nexample, the pronoun could not be linked to the indefinite: If we merge [5b] and [6b], which is the sentence DRS corresponding\nwith [6a], we obtain [6c]. In this representation, the discourse\nreferent z does not have access\nto y,\nbecause y is introduced in a DRS\nthat is not accessible to the DRS in\nwhich z is introduced, and\ntherefore it is not possible to\nbind z\nto y.  In other words, if [6a] is\npreceded by [5a], the pronoun cannot be anaphorically linked to the\nindefinite. This prediction appears to be correct. Accessibility is in the first instance a relation between DRSs;\nderivatively, it is also a relation between discourse\nreferents. [6c1] is accessible to [6c2], but not\nthe other way round, and therefore the discourse referents introduced\nin [6c1], i.e., x\nand z, are accessible from\n[6c2], but conversely, if we are in [6c1] we\nhave no access to [6c2] and its discourse referents,\ni.e., y.  Thus in [6c] anaphora is\nnot possible because y is not\naccessible to z. In [4a], by\ncontrast, anaphora is possible,\nbecause x\nand y are accessible\nto v\nand w (the accessibility relation\nbeing reflexive). The notion of accessibility is crucial to DRT’s\naccount of anaphora, and it is important to note that it is not\nstipulated, but is entailed by the semantics of the DRS\nlanguage. [6c1] is accessible to [6c2] because\nevery embedding function that must be considered for [6c2]\nis an extension of an embedding function for [6c1], and it\nis for this reason that every discourse referent in [6c1]\nis also defined in [6c2]. The converse, however, does not\nhold. Like negated sentences, conditionals give rise to complex\nDRS-conditions, too. (7) gives an example: [7b] is the sentence DRS which corresponds to [7a], and assuming\nfor convenience that this sentence is uttered in an empty context, it\nis also the initial DRS of the discourse. The complex condition in\nthis structure is interpreted as follows: if f is to verify\n[7b1] in the current model,\nthen f(x) must be an\nindividual called “Pedro”, and every extension\nof f which verifies [7b2] must itself be extendable\nto a function that verifies [7b3]. It follows from this that\n[7b1] is accessible to [7b2], which in its turn is\naccessible to [7b3], and\ntherefore v may be linked up\nto x (accessibility being a\ntransitive relation) and w\nto y.  The result is [7c], which\nis equivalent to [7d], both DRSs saying that Pedro beats every donkey\nhe owns.\n The interpretation of quantified donkey sentences is very similar\nto what we have just seen: There are two ways of spelling out the interpretation of\nso-called duplex conditions of the\nform K(∀x)K′. On its\nweak interpretation, [8a] means that every farmer who owns a donkey\nbeats at least one of the donkeys he owns; on its strong\ninterpretation the sentence says that every farmer beats every donkey\nhe owns. While the strong reading is the most natural choice for [8a],\nother donkey sentences prefer a weak reading: The most likely interpretation for [9] to have is that every\ntractor-owning farmer uses one of their tractors to drive to church. The distinction between weak and strong interpretations is somewhat\nmysterious, because it doesn’t seem to be an ordinary ambiguity. For\nexample, donkey sentences with existential quantifiers don’t seem to\nlicense strong readings: This can only be construed as saying that some donkey-owning\nfarmers beat at least one of their donkeys. More generally, the\nuniversally quantified donkey sentences seem to be the only ones to\nlicense both interpretations. It is not entirely clear why this should\nbe the case (see Kanazawa 1994, Geurts 2002). Whether weak or strong, the interpretation of a condition of the\nform K(Qx)K′,\nwhere Q may be any quantifier,\nmakes K accessible\nto K′, and in this respect\n(which is the fulcrum of the DRT analysis) conditionals and quantified\nsentences are the same. Consequently, the discourse\nreferents x\nand y in [8b2] are\naccessible to v\nand w in [8b3], and the\nlatter may be equated to the former.  The resulting representation is\n[8c], which is equivalent to [8d]. The DRT analysis of quantified expressions like “all”\nor “most” is fairly standard. A quantifier binds a\nvariable and delivers the truth conditions one should\nexpect. Indefinites are different. An indefinite like “a\ndonkey” is treated not as a quantifier but simply as device for\nintroducing a discourse referent and one or more conditions; on the\nDRT account, indefinites have no quantifying force of their own. What\nquantifying force they seem to have is not theirs, but derives from\nthe environment in which they occur. If the semantic material\nassociated with “a donkey” is introduced in the main DRS,\nas in [4c], the quantifying effect will be existential, owing to the\nfact that this DRS is verified in a model M iff there\nis a way of verifying it in M. If the semantic\nmaterial associated with “a donkey” is introduced in the\nantecedent of a conditional, as in [7d], the quantifying effect will\nbe universal, owing to the fact that a\ncondition of the form K⇒K′ is\nverified in M iff every way of\nverifying K can be extended to a\nway of verifying K′. This\nview on indefinites lies at the heart of DRT. DRT was one of the first semantic theories to go beyond the\nsentence boundary, and take into account how the interpretation of an\nexpression may depend on the preceding discourse. Looking back at the\nexamples discussed in the foregoing, we see that, if the DRT approach\nis on the right track, sentence boundaries are not as important as the\nFregean (or Chomskyan) conception of language would have it. In particular, there is\nessentially no difference between the DRT analysis of cross-sentential\nanaphora, as exemplified by the mini-discourse [2]-[3a], and\nsentence-internal anaphora, as in [7a] or [9a]. In either case, the\npronoun simply serves to pick up an accessible discourse\nreferent. This raises the question of how DRT’s new-fangled notion of\nanaphora relates to the dichotomy between referential and\nbound-variable pronouns.  Curiously, this issue doesn’t seem to have\nreceived much attention yet. In the foregoing we assumed that the contribution of a sentence to\nthe discourse, as represented by a DRS, was obtained in two steps. In\nthe first one, a sentence DRS was constructed in a compositional way;\nthis part of the construction process we took for granted, but its\nimplementation wouldn’t be too difficult. In the second step, the\nsentence DRS was merged with the DRS representing the prior discourse,\nand anaphoric references were resolved. This two-stage procedure has\nbecome the industrial standard, but the original version of DRT (Kamp\n1981, Kamp and Reyle 1993) was monostratal in the sense that one set\nof rules took care of both tasks at once. In the meantime, Kamp and\nhis co-workers have adopted the two-step method, too (e.g., Kamp et\nal.  2011). In one-level versions of DRT, a single set of rules is used to\nobtain the semantic contribution of a sentence. To take a simple\nexample, if the sentence is “It is grey”, the first rule\nto apply will say that the semantic correlate of the subject is an\nargument to the predicate expressed by “is grey”. Then the\ntwo main parts of the sentence are analysed further, and the pronoun\n“it” triggers a rule which at once deals with the\npronoun’s lexical content and its context dependence; i.e., it says\nthat we must select a new discourse referent, link it to a discourse\nreferent made available by the preceding discourse, and update the DRS\nso as to record these changes. In two-level versions of DRT there is\nno such rule. Its duties are divided between two separate\nmechanisms. In the first stage, a separate DRS is constructed for the\nsentence, in which pronouns prompt the introduction of new discourse\nreferents that are marked as being anaphoric (we use underlining for\nthis purpose). In the second stage, there is a general mechanism for\ndealing with discourse referents thus marked. The distinction between one- and two-level versions of DRT is of\ninterest for at least two reasons. First, once we go beyond basic DRT,\nthe two-stage system may actually be more economical overall. For\nexample, if DRT is extended for dealing with presuppositions (see\nSection 5), the one-pass approach becomes unwieldy. Secondly, and\nperhaps more importantly, two-stage theories may be viewed as\nimplementing a distinction between semantics and pragmatics which has\nsome prima facie plausibility: in the first stage a representation is\ncomputed which is projected from the sentence’s lexico-grammatical\nstructure, while in the second stage, context-dependent aspects of\nmeaning are dealt with.  This division of labor is reminiscent of the\ntraditional dichotomy between compositional semantics and\nnon-compositional pragmatics, but it should be noted that the two do\nnot coincide. Usually, the “semantical” part of a\ntwo-stage version of DRT is not compositional in the Fregean sense,\nbecause its output is essentially incomplete; it may contain anaphoric\n“gaps”, for example. Therefore, even if a sentence DRS\nadmits of a truth-conditional interpretation, it will typically fall\nshort of capturing everything that is conventionally thought to belong\nto truth-conditional content. In this section we give a more precise description of the DRS\nlanguage than we have done so far. We define the syntax of the\nlanguage, present a model-theoretic interpretation, and discuss the\nnotion of accessibility, which figures so prominently in DRT’s account\nof anaphora. DRSs are set-theoretic objects built from discourse\nreferents and DRS-conditions.  A\nDRS-condition is either atomic, in which case it consists of a\npredicate and a suitable number of discourse referents, or complex, in\nwhich case it embeds one or two DRSs. Hence, the definition of the DRS\nlanguage is by simultaneous recursion: DRSs and DRS-conditions Note that there are no conditions corresponding to conjoined\nsentences. Such sentences are dealt with, rather, by merging the DRSs\nassociated with their parts, where the merge of two DRSs\nK and\nK′\nis defined as their pointwise union: DRS-merge The merge operation is also used for combining a sentence DRS with\nthe DRS representing the preceding discourse, so the idea is that\nthere is no principled distinction between (clausal) conjunction and\nsentence concatenation (see Muskens 1996 for discussion). Officially, DRSs are set-theoretical objects, but in this article\nwe use a linear notation. Many sources, including Kamp’s own work,\nemploy a graphical “box notation” which is sometimes\nclearer, but less parsimonious and more difficult to type. To\nillustrate the various schemes, here are three ways of representing\nthe content of a conditional donkey sentence: The choice between these formats is one of convenience, and does\nnot have any theoretical significance. Accessibility is a relation between DRSs that is transitive and\nreflexive, i.e., it is a preorder. More in particular, it is the\nsmallest preorder for which the following holds, for all\nDRSs K, K′,\nand K″:\nif ConK\ncontains a condition of the form … To illustrate, in the following schematic representations, every\nDRS is accessible to all and only those DRSs whose number doesn’t\nprecede its own (so every DRS is accessible to itself): The accessible domain of a\nDRS K, AK,\nis the set of discourse referents that occur in\nsome K′ that is accessible\nto K,\ni.e., AK =\n{x:  K′ is accessible\nto K\nand x\n∈ UK′}.\nThe main constraint which DRT imposes on the interpretation of\nanaphora is this: Accessibility constraint \nA pronoun is represented by a discourse\nreferent x which must be equated\nto some discourse referent y\n∈ AK,\nwhere K is the DRS in\nwhich x is introduced. It is important to note that neither the notion of accessibility\nnor the accessibility constraint need be stipulated. For, as we will\npresently see, both follow from the way the DRS language is\ninterpreted (cf. the notion of variable binding in standard predicate\nlogic).  Thus, we are not at liberty to modify the accessibility\nrelation, should we wish to do so, unless we simultaneously revise the\ntruth conditions associated with the DRS language. The accessibility\nconstraint is a semantic one. As discussed in Section 2, the main syntactic constraint on\nbound-variable pronouns is that they be c-commanded by their\nantecedents. The domain of the accessibility constraint overlaps with\nthat of the c-command constraint, but it is wider. For one thing,\nsentence boundaries don’t affect accessibility. For another, within\nthe confines of a sentence, the semantic correlate of an\nexpression E1 may be accessible to that\nof E2, even if E1 doesn’t\nc-command E2.  To illustrate this point, consider\nthe conditional donkey sentence in [1a] and its sentence DRS in\n[1b]: Syntactically speaking, neither “a farmer” nor “a\ndonkey” can bind (in the sense of Chomsky 1986) an expression\nbeyond the smallest clause in which they occur. In particular, neither\ncan bind any of the pronouns in the main clause of [1a]. But the\ndiscourse referents associated with these indefinites,\ni.e., x\nand y, are in the accessible\ndomain of [1b3], and therefore the anaphoric discourse\nreferents in this embedded DRS can be linked\nto x\nand y. Put otherwise, they are\nbindable at a semantic but not at a syntactic level. The truth-conditional semantics of the DRS language is given by\ndefining when an embedding function verifies a DRS in\na given model. An embedding function is a partial mapping from\ndiscourse referents to individuals. Given two embedding\nfunctions f and g and a\nDRS K, we say that g\nextends f with respect\nto K,\nor f[K]g for\nshort, iff Dom(g) = Dom(f)\n∪ UK, and\nfor all x\nin Dom(f): f(x)\n= g(x).  Viewing\nfunctions as set-theoretic objects, this can be formulated more\nsuccinctly as follows:\n In the following we define what it takes for an embedding function\nto verify a DRS or DRS-condition in a given model. As usual, a\nmodel M is a pair <D,I>, where D is a\nset of individuals, and I is an interpretation function that\nassigns sets of individuals to one-place predicates, sets of pairs to\ntwo-place predicates, and so on. To enhance the legibility of our\ndefinition somewhat we omit the qualifier “in M”\nthroughout: Verifying embeddings The last clause gives a strong interpretation to universal duplex\nconditions (cf. Section 3.2); the weak interpretation is obtainable as\nfollows: A DRS is true in a given model iff we can find a verifying\nembedding for it, as follows: Truth A DRS K is true in a\nmodel M iff there is an embedding function f such\nthat Dom(f) =\n UK\n and f verifies\nK in M. To see how accessibility follows from these definitions, the\ncritical junctures are the points at which extensions of embedding\nfunctions are called for. For example, consider a schematic DRS with a\nconditional in it: This DRS is true iff we can find an embedding\nfunction f, Dom(f) =\n{x}, which verifies all conditions\nin [2], which is to say\nthat f(x) must be\nan A, and f verifies the\ncomplex condition [y: B(x,y)] ⇒ [z:\nC(x,y,z)].  The latter requirement is met iff every\nextension g of f, Dom(g)\n= {x,y}, such that g\nverifies [y: B(x,y)] can be\nextended to a function h, Dom(h)\n= {x,y,z}, such that h\nverifies [z: C(x,y,z)]. Hence, no\nmatter how we\nchoose g, g(x)\nmust be the same individual\nas f(x), and for\nany g, no matter how we\nchoose h, h(x)\nand h(y) must be the same\nas g(x)\nand g(y),\nrespectively. This is why x is in\nthe accessible domain associated with the antecedent of the\nconditional, and why y is in the\naccessible domain associated with the consequent. Having focussed thus far on the interpretation of anaphoric\npronouns, the purpose of this section is to illustrate how the ideas\nlying at the heart of DRT have been applied to other phenomena. We\nwill restrict ourselves to three topics: tense, presupposition, and\npropositional attitudes. In the first two cases, we will encounter\ninterpretative dependencies reminiscent of the dependency relation\nbetween an anaphor and its antecedent, and we will describe, if only\nin outline, how basic DRT has been extended so as to capture the\nsimilarities. DRT’s representationalism comes into its own in its\ntreatment of attitudes and attitude ascriptions, which is the third\ntopic on our list. In section 6 we introduce SDRT, a significant extension of the DRT framework designed to model discourse structure more accurately. In the early 1970s, it was pointed out that there are systematic\nparallels between tenses and pronouns (Partee 1973), and DRT was\npartly born from the conviction that a theory of interpretation should\naccount for these parallels. Partee (1984) herself worked out some of\nthese ideas in the DRT framework. In the following we will briefly\ndiscuss some of Partee’s observations, and outline a DRT\ntreatment. Intuitively, the indefinite description “a donkey” in\nthe opening sentence of [1a] serves to introduce an entity that is\nsubsequently picked up by the pronoun “it” in the second\nsentence, and the DRT account of indefinites and pronouns seeks to\nformalize this intuitive picture. [1b] shows that a very similar\nphenomenon occurs in the temporal domain, for in this case it is\nnatural to construe the past tense of the second sentence as being\nanaphorically dependent on the content of the first: presumably,\nJuanita slapped Pedro right after he tried to kiss her. In order to\ncapture this idea, DRT adopts an event-based semantics, treating\nevents as semantic values of a designated class of discourse\nreferents. Sentences are now construed like indefinite descriptions in\nthat they, too, serve to introduce discourse referents. For example,\nthe first sentence in [1b] introduces a discourse referent of the\nevent type that represents Pedro’s attempting to kiss Juanita, and the\ntense morpheme in “slapped” is construed as referring\nback, very much like an anaphoric pronoun, to that event: by default,\nthe time of Juanita’s slapping Pedro will be taken to be immediately\nafter the time of him trying to kiss her. Our second example involves what one might call “donkey\ntense”: In an event-based semantics, it is natural to construe [2b] as\nquantifying over events, just like [2a] quantifies over\nindividuals. In conjunction with the DRT treatment of quantification,\nthis allows us to interpret the tense in “slapped” as\nreferring back to the event introduced in the subordinate clause,\nalong the following lines (where ⊃⊂ stands for\nthe “right after”\nrelation, e″ is the variable\nintroduced by the tense in “slapped”,\nand e″ indicates\nthat e″ requires an\nantecedent): In [3a] the tense introduces an anaphoric element, which can be\nbound in the restrictor of the quantifier, just as an ordinary donkey\npronoun might be bound. The result, after a minor simplification, is\n[3b], which says that every event e of Pedro trying to kiss Juanita is\nimmediately followed by an event e′ of her slapping him. Note\nthat, although this DRS captures the most natural interpretation of\nthe past tense in “slapped”, it leaves the past tense in\n“tried” unaccounted for. But this is as it should be, for\nif tense is anaphoric, then that tense, too, should be linked to a\nsalient time point, which seems to be right: in the absence of a\ncontext that furnishes such a time, [2b] is simply infelicitous; it is\nlike saying “He is handsome” when it is not clear whom the\npronoun is intended to refer to. Presuppositions are chunks of information associated with\nparticular lexical items or syntactic constructions. There are many\nsuch items and constructions, and the following is just a small\nselection:  Factive verbs It-clefts Definites Someone who utters any of the [a] sentences commits himself to the\ntruth of the respective [b] sentence. Of course, this does nothing to\ndistinguish presuppositions from ordinary entailments, but the\ndifference becomes apparent when we embed presuppositional expressions\nor constructions in non-entailing environments, as in: Here [5a] is embedded in the scope of a negation and a modal\noperator, respectively, and it appears that these sentences commit a\nspeaker to the truth of [5b] just as much as [5a] does. This behavior\nsets presuppositions apart from ordinary entailments. Generally speaking, presuppositions tend to escape\nfrom any embedded position in the sense that, if a\nsentence S contains a presupposition-inducing\nexpression P, an utterance of S will usually imply\nthat P holds. This is only generally speaking, because this\nrule, though correct in the majority of cases, does not hold without\nexceptions: While the [a] sentences would normally commit a speaker to the\nclaim that Pedro has a donkey, the same does not hold for the [b]\nsentences.  It appears, therefore, that presuppositions are typically\nthough not invariably inherited by the sentences in which they\noccur. This is the so-called “projection problem” for\npresuppositions. Considering that anaphora and presupposition were widely discussed\nfrom the late 1960s onwards, it took a remarkably long time before it\nwas discovered that, in some respects at least, the two phenomena are\nvery similar (van der Sandt 1992, Kripke 2009). To see how, consider\nthe following pairs: It is true that the variants with the\n“that”-complements are slightly odd, but actually the fact\nthat they are proves the point we want to make; for it is clear that,\nin these examples, the pronoun “it” and the clause\n“that he owns a donkey” perform the same duty, and if the\nlatter sounds somewhat off it is presumably because the former does\nthe job just as well. While the factive verb “know” triggers the\npresupposition that its clausal complement is true, this\npresupposition is neutralized in [10b] and [10c]. If presuppositions\nbehave similarly to anaphoric pronouns, it is clear why that should be\nso: in both cases, the presupposition is bound\nsentence-internally, just like the neuter pronoun is bound. Presupposed information is information that is presented as given,\nand according to the so-called “binding theory” of\npresupposition this means that presuppositions want to have discourse\nreferents to bind to (van der Sandt 1992, Geurts 1999).  However,\nwhereas anaphoric pronouns are rarely interpretable in the absence of\na suitable antecedent, the same does not hold for all\npresupposition-inducing expressions. For instance, a speaker may\nfelicitously assert that he met “Pedro’s sister” even if\nhe knows full well that his audience wasn’t aware that Pedro has a\nsister. In such cases, Karttunen (1974) and Stalnaker (1974)\nsuggested, presuppositions are\ngenerally accommodated, which is to say that the\nhearer accepts the information as given, and revises his\nrepresentation of the context accordingly. Accommodation, thus\nunderstood, is a form of exploitation in Grice’s sense: the purpose of\npresuppositional expressions is to signal that this or that\ninformation is given, and if some information is new but not\nparticularly interesting or controversial (like the fact that somebody\nhas a sister) the speaker may choose to “get it out of the\nway” by presuppositional means. The binding theory incorporates the notion of accommodation as\nfollows. Presuppositions, according to the theory, introduce\ninformation that prefers to be linked to discourse referents that are\nalready available in the DRS, and in this respect they are like\npronouns. However, if a suitable discourse referent is not available,\na new one will be accommodated, and the presupposition is linked to\nthat.  Generally speaking, accommodation is not an option in the\ninterpretation of pronouns, and a possible reason for this is that a\npronoun’s descriptive content is relatively poor. Being told that\n“she” is wonderful is not particularly helpful if it isn’t\nclear who the pronoun is meant to refer to. By contrast, if the\nspeaker refers to “Pedro’s sister” there is more to go on,\nand accommodation becomes feasible. Hence, the binding theory views\npronouns as a special class of presuppositional expressions. While all\npresupposition triggers prefer to be bound, pronouns almost always\nmust be bound. According to the binding theory, this is because\npronouns are descriptively attenuated, and therefore cannot be\nconstrued by way of accommodation. Propositional attitudes (mental states like belief, desire, or\nimagination) and attitude ascriptions (sentences like “John\nthinks/hopes that Mary likes him”) have been a rich source of\nphilosophical puzzles. DRT’s representationalism offers fresh\nsolutions to some of them. A central issue in the treatment of attitudes is that of logical\nomniscience: humans are cognitively limited agents, and are not aware\nof all the consequences of their beliefs and desires. On this basis,\nKamp (1990) argues that the objects of thought should not be seen as\npurely model-theoretic entities, for example a set of belief worlds,\nas is common in logics of belief from Hintikka (1962) onwards. Rather,\nthe logic of belief and other attitudes must involve structured mental\nrepresentations. The problem of logical omniscience is then resolved\nin terms of the failure of human agents to perform logically complete\ncomputations over these representations. Modeling the objects of\nattitudes in this way, as representational entities, allows us to make\nthe fine distinctions necessary to distinguish between believing that\nit is raining and believing that if it is not raining then 37 is not\nprime. However, traditional versions of such a sententialist or\nLanguage-of-Thought approach to omniscience typically run into the\nproblem of intentionality: to be useful to us, our attitudes must\nsomehow be about the external world we live in, so we still have to\nexplain how these syntactic representations connect with reality. In a\nHintikka-style possible worlds semantics the link between world and\nattitude is hardwired into the semantics: believing that John is happy\nmeans that the agent takes the actual world to be an element of the\nset of worlds where John is happy. The DRT approach combines these two\nstrategies: use the classic, model-theoretic semantics of the DRS\nlanguage to cash out intentionality in terms of possible worlds, but\nhold on to the representational level to model resource-bounded\ncomputations in practical reasoning.  A special type of intentionality is that of singular or de\nre attitudes: beliefs and desires that directly involve objects\nthe attitude holder is acquainted with. To capture such attitudes,\nKamp (1990) introduces anchors. An internal anchor is a descriptive\nmode of presentation, in the form of a DRS with a distinguished\ndiscourse referent, while an external anchor maps that discourse\n  referent to an actual individual. A full-fledged entity representation comprises an internal and an external anchor, and is a construct closely related to the Mental Files of Recanati (2012) and other neo-Fregean approaches to reference. A complete mental state\nrepresentation then consists of (i) a set of internal anchors and\nattitude descriptions, each consisting of a DRS paired with a mode\nindicator (e.g., ANCH, \nBEL, \nDES) and possibly sharing discourse\nreferents, and (ii) an external anchor mapping the internally anchored\ndiscourse referents to objects of acquaintance. By way of\nillustration, the mental state representation below describes\nmy de re belief that this cup c I’m holding now\ncontains coffee, along with the desire that it is still warm: Compartmentalized mental state representations like this have been\nturned into semantic theories of attitude ascriptions and used to\nsolve a variety of familiar puzzles, such as those involving Kripke’s\n(1979) Pierre who believes Londres is pretty but London is not (Asher\n1986, Kamp 2015), Geach’s (1967) Hob who believes a witch killed his\ncow while Nob believes she, the same witch, blighted his mare (Asher\n1987), specific indefinites (Kamp and Bende-Farkas 2019), presupposition projection out of\n(non-doxastic) attitude ascriptions (Maier 2015), and referring to fictional entities (Maier 2017). Not all DRT treatments of attitude reports rely on a\nrepresentational theory of the underlying mental states\nthemselves. For example, Geurts (1999) and Maier (2010) develop\nanalyses of attitude ascriptions in versions of DRT that use only a\nstandard Hintikka-style possible worlds semantics for attitudes. In\nthe same vein, Maier (2009) and Hunter (2013) explore extensions of\nDRT to deal with directly referential expressions like indexicals and\nproper names without resorting to anchors or mental state\nrepresentations. We’ve seen in sections 3 and 4 above how anaphora resolution\nis constrained by accessibility. But there are many other factors that play a role in\nthe resolution process, from local, grammatical factors like subject\nantecedents being generally more prominent than object antecedents in pronoun\nresolution, to more global, discourse structural factors. Focusing on the latter,\nHobbs (1979) argues that the interpreter’s desire to create a maximally coherent\ninterpretation will often play a decisive role in choosing between multiple\naccessible antecedents for a pronoun, as he illustrates with the following contrast: In [1a] the pronoun binds to John, because that delivers the most coherent\ninterpretation of the two-sentence discourse as a whole. In [1b], by contrast, the\npronoun is bound to Bill. This difference corresponds to a difference in the kind of\ncoherence relations exemplified by the two discourses: [1a] exemplifies a coherence\nrelation known as Elaboration, while [1b] is an instance of Result. That discourse\nrelations play an important role in discourse interpretation is shown by examples like\n  [2] (again from Hobbs 1979).  Reading [2] you might wonder if Turkish spinach is really that much better than\nwhat you can get in France, which shows to what lengths we go to accommodate a\nsuitable coherence relation, in this case Explanation, before we give up our quest for\n  a coherent interpretation.    Asher and Lascarides (2003) take the idea that pronoun resolution and the\ninference of coherence relations between discourse units are closely related processes\nas the starting point for their Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT),\ncombining DRT with insights from discourse coherence theories like Hobbs’s. SDRT\nassumes a set of discourse relations (Narration, Result, Contrast, Explanation,\nElaboration, Correction, to name a few) that we may infer to connect the\npropositions expressed by the individual sentences (or clauses), in order to create a\nmaximally coherent interpretation of the discourse as a whole. Different discourse\nrelations may impose different constraints on anaphora resolution over and\nabove DRT’s accessibility. Take the example in [3] (Asher and Lascarides\n  2003). In standard DRT the salmon introduced in [3c] would provide a suitable and\naccessible antecedent for the pronoun in [3f], but in fact this resolution appears to be\nunavailable. SDRT explains this observation in terms of a discourse structural\nconstraint known as the Right Frontier Constraint. This constraint is best illustrated\nby drawing a discourse structure graph like the one below. A horizontal arrow in this\ngraph indicates a coordinating discourse relation (where neither relatum dominates\nthe other), in this case Narration. A vertical arrow indicates a subordinating\ndiscourse relation (where a nucleus dominates a satellite), in this case Elaboration.\n SDRT’s version of the Right Frontier Constraint says that the pronoun in [3f] can\nonly find an antecedent introduced in the node that was just introduced ([3e]), or one\n  that dominates it ([3a]).    More formally, an SDRS consists of such a discourse structure graph, where each\nvertex corresponds to a discourse relation and each node to a DRS. A common SDRS\nnotation extends the familiar box notation of DRT (see section 4) with labels for\n  elementary and complex discourse units: Anaphora and presupposition resolution rely on a modified notion of\naccessibility that incorporates the Right Frontier Constraint. The\nmodel-theoretic interpretation of an SDRS is built around a set of\nspecial interpretation rules for the various discourse\nrelations. Narration for instance comes with a semantic interpretation\nrule that states that the both relata hold and moreover the main\nevents they introduce stand in a relation of temporal\nprogression. Some notational\nshortcuts: Kπ is the DRS\nassociated with label π (i.e. the K such\nthat π : K occurs somewhere in the\nSDRS); eπ is the unique event\ndiscourse referent that occurs\nin U(Kπ) (for readability\nwe left out event referents from the example SDRS above, but for the purpose of modelling narrative temporal progression in SDRT we should treat every verb phrase as introducing an event discourse referent). Note that conditions of the form πn : K are not interpreted directly as semantic conditions on their own, but instead serve to associate DRS contents with\n proposition labels. DRT is a representational theory of interpretation. In the DRT\nframework, sentences have meanings, if at all, only in a derivative\nsense: a sentence prompts the hearer to modify his DRS, and it is DRSs\nthat have a truth-conditional interpretation. Thus, a sentence causes\na DRS Ki to be\ntransformed into a\nDRS Ki+1 (usually,\nthough not invariably, the process will consist in adding information\nto Ki), and at a remove\nthere is an associated transition at the semantical level,\nfrom Ki’s\ninterpretation\nto Ki+1’s.  Hence, if\nwe could cut out the representational middleman, we would have a\ntheory that defines sentence meaning in dynamic terms, as a transition\nfrom one semantic object to another. Thus arises the question of\nwhether or not the representational level can be dispensed with. Kamp\n(1981) claimed that representations were essential to\nhis ur-version of DRT, which was a subset of our\nbasic DRT, but in the meantime he was proved wrong by a slew of\ndynamic theories that recast classical DRT in purely semantical terms:\nBarwise (1987), Rooth (1987), Groenendijk and Stokhof (1989, 1991),\nMuskens (1996), and many more. However, Kamp’s claim still holds for\nvarious extensions of classical DRT, like the theories of\npresupposition and attitude ascription discussed in the foregoing. These theories are allegedly “non-representational”,\nbut what exactly does that mean? Consider, for example, Groenendijk\nand Stokhof’s (1991) Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL), which provides a\ndynamic semantics for the language of classical predicate logic, in\nwhich “Pedro owns a donkey and beats it” may be rendered\nas follows: DPL’s semantics ensures that, unlike in classical logic, the last\noccurrence of x is bound by the existential quantifier. The\nway this works is that DPL analyzes sentence meanings in terms of\nvariable assignments, which are manipulated by the logical constants\nin such as way that [1] is true in a model M iff M’s\ndomain features an individual which, when assigned to the\nvariable x, makes each of the atomic sentences in [1] come\nout true in M. Formally, this is implemented by stipulating\nthat the meaning of a sentence is a relation between variable\nassignments. A variable assignment is a mapping from variables to individuals,\nand variables are linguistic expressions, so it can hardly be claimed\nthat assignments are non-representational entities. Therefore, it is a\nbit puzzling that, in contrast to DRT, DPL is widely seen as a\nnon-representational variety of dynamic semantics. True, DRT’s\nrepresentationalism goes quite a bit further than DPL’s, and the two\ntheories are obviously very different in this respect, but both\ntheories import representational elements into semantics, and this\nholds for dynamic theories of semantics generally (though see Dekker\n2012 for exceptions). Note, incidentally, that DRT’s representationalism is not\nparticularly troubling from a psychological point of view. For if we\nadopt a cognitivist perspective, and view DRT as a (somewhat abstract)\ntheory of the psychology of interpretation, then its\nrepresentationalism wouldn’t be particularly controversial, since for\nmost psychologists, the controversy is not over whether there exist\nmental representations, but over what they are like.  One way in which DRT’s representationalism manifests itself as\nbeing more radical than other theories’ is that it is a\nnon-compositional theory as well. These two features are intertwined.\nConsider, for instance, the way pronouns are interpreted in basic DRT,\nby first setting up a discourse referent, which is subsequently linked\nto another discourse referent. This is a non-deterministic process,\nbut even if it were not, it is clear that the anaphoric link is not\npart of the meaning of the pronoun. A standard statement of\ncompositionality would say that the meaning of a compound expression\nmust be a function of the meaning of their components and their mode\nof combination. But if some of the components, like pronouns, do not\nintroduce into the DRS any object that can naturally be described as\nthe meaning of that object, then it is clear that we do not have a\ncompositional system. How bad is it that we lose compositionality? It is generally agreed\nthat some of the standard arguments for compositionality are not\nparticularly compelling. In particular, we don’t need compositionality\nto explain why people can understand an indefinite number of\nsentences, and we don’t need it for explaining how languages can be\nlearned. To explain such facts, it suffices that there is some\nprocedure for establishing the meanings of sentences, but it is not\nstrictly necessary for this procedure to be compositional.\nCompositionality is often viewed as a methodological principle\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1989, 1991; Janssen 1997; Dever 1999), since\nany model of interpretation can be made compositional if we are\nsufficiently relaxed about the nature of lexical meanings and/or the\nsyntactic structures over which the compositional theory is\ndefined. In the case of DRT, the standard approaches to making the\nsystem compositional involve dispensing with Kamp’s construction\nalgorithm, and replacing it with a system in which DRSs can be\ncomposed either through suitable merge operations (Zeevat 1989b), or,\nin dynamic semantic systems like those of Groenendijk and Stokhof\n(1989) and Muskens (1996), through use of function application in a\nlambda calculus. But while most such systems capture meanings for\nsentences that are closely related to those of original DRT, they do\nnot capture every aspect of DRT. In particular, whereas anaphora\nresolution is an integral part of DRT, in compositional theories anaphora resolution is\nassumed to be performed by a separate component of the theory. Representationalism and compositionality are issues that have\nproduced great disagreement amongst semanticists and philosophers of\nlanguage, though less so nowadays than they did in the 1980s. The\nmethodological view of compositionality has reduced what appeared once\nto be a substantive argument to a matter of taste, and as regards DRT\nit has been shown that researchers who care about compositionality are\nfree to adopt a variant of the original system with many of its\nfeatures, but none of its non-compositionality. But\nrepresentationalism may be a more serious issue, for if it is true, as\nwe have suggested, that dynamic theories generally rely on a notion of\nmeaning that contains at least some form of representation, then that\nnotion could do with a bit more philosophical attention than it has\nreceived so far.

The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, are\nthat it is a mentalist and representationalist theory of\ninterpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not only\nof individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respects\nDRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which during\nthe 1970s had emanated from Montague’s pioneering work (Thomason\n1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in its\nuse of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve\nas a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will\nconfine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense,\npresupposition, and propositional attitudes. For references to work on\nother topics, see the “Further reading” section.\n\n This article concerns Discourse Representation Theory narrowly\ndefined as work in the tradition descending from Kamp (1981). The same\nterm is sometimes used more broadly, occasionally embracing Heim’s\n(1982) work and the developments initiated by Groenendijk and Stokhof\n(1989, 1991). However, the more common common label for the extended\nDRT family is “dynamic semantics”, and that is the term we\nwill use, too. Two features that set DRT apart from other varieties of dynamic\nsemantics is that it is representational and non-compositional. In the\n1980s, the founding years of dynamic semantics, these features made\nDRT a controversial theory, though by now those controversies have\nabated. DRT’s main innovation, beyond the Montagovian paradigm which\nwas then considered orthodox, is that it introduced a level of mental\nrepresentations, called “discourse representation\nstructures” (DRSs). The basic idea is rather straightforward. It\nis that a hearer builds up a mental representation of the discourse as\nit unfolds, and that every incoming sentence prompts additions to that\nrepresentation. This picture has always been commonplace in the\npsychology of language. DRT’s principal tenet is that it should be the\nstarting point for semantic theory, too. A theory of the DRT family consists of the following\ningredients: Technically, this is very similar to earlier work in formal\nsemantics, with two exceptions: the interpretation process always\ntakes the previous discourse into account, and the level of semantic\nrepresentations is claimed to be essential. What has worried some\nsemanticists is not so much the fact that DRSs are mental\nrepresentations, but that an additional level is needed, and used in\nways that render the theory non-compositional; we will return to this\nissue in Section 7. The relationship between a pronoun and its antecedent is one that\nhas received a great deal of attention in linguistics and philosophy.\nWe say that a pronoun is anaphoric, as opposed to deictic, for\nexample, if it depends for its interpretation on an antecedent\nexpression elsewhere in the sentence or the discourse. In some cases\nthe nature of this dependency seems straightforward: (Here and henceforth we use underlining to highlight the anaphoric\nlinks we are currently interested in.) Since “Pedro” is a\nreferential expression, it makes sense, in this case, to say that\n“his” is a referential term, too, which derives its\nreference from its antecedent.  This construal is plausible enough,\nbut it doesn’t apply across the board: The term “no farmer” is not a referential expression,\nso “his” cannot be coreferential with it. Rather, it would\nseem that, in this case, the relationship between the pronoun and its\nantecedent is one of binding, in the logical sense of\nthe word: “no farmer” and “his” are\ninterpreted as a quantifier and a variable, respectively, and the\nformer binds the latter. It is fairly obvious that the bound-variable construal of pronouns\nis subject to syntactic constraints. Most importantly, this type of\ninterpretation requires that the pronoun\nbe c-commanded by its antecedent, where c-command is\ndefined as follows: The constituent structure of sentence [2] is [S\n[NP No farmer][VP beat [NP his\ndonkey]]]. Here the pronoun is contained in the sister of its\nantecedent, so the c-command constraint is met. In [3] “no\nfarmer” does not c-command “his”, and so we predict,\ncorrectly, that the pronoun cannot be bound. Since the syntactic structure of [1] is identical to that of [2],\nwe might wonder if the pronoun in [1] may not be bound by its\nantecedent, just as in [2]. If this were possible, there would be two\nways of construing the pronoun in [1]: it could function either as a\nreferential term or as a bound variable. There is evidence that this is\nindeed the case: [4a] is ambiguous in a way [4b] is not. Its second conjunct can be\nconstrued as saying either that Juan beats his own donkey or that Juan\nbeats Pedro’s donkey. The second conjunct of [4b], by contrast, can\nonly be interpreted as saying that Juan beats his own donkey. If the\npossessive pronoun in the first conjunct of [4a] can be either\nreferential or a bound variable, the contrast is readily\nexplained. In large part, the motivation for developing dynamic theories of\ninterpretation, beginning with DRT, was the realization that the\ndichotomy between referential and bound-variable (occurrences of)\npronouns is less natural than one might think—less natural in\nthe sense that some pronouns don’t fit comfortably in either\ncategory. What is the relationship between “it” in the second\nsentence and its antecedent expression in the first? On the one hand,\nit cannot be coreference. If the pronoun were coreferential with its\nantecedent, the indefinite “a donkey” would have to be a\nreferential term, which seems unlikely, e.g., because the negation of\n[5a] says not that there is a donkey that Pedro fails to own, but\nrather that he doesn’t own any donkey, and furthermore, if [5a] is\nnegated, the anaphoric link between the pronoun and its antecedent is\nsevered: (The asterisk indicates that the sentence is infelicitous if\n“a donkey” is to be interpreted as the antecedent of\n“it”.) Observations like these suggest rather strongly\nthat indefinites are quantifiers rather than referential\nterms. However, if we construe “a donkey” as an\nexistential quantifier, how does it manage to bind the pronoun across\na sentence boundary? The problem with [5] is related to the fact that the pronoun and\nits indefinite antecedent occur in different sentences. The following\nexamples show, however, that similar problems arise within\nsentences: These are the infamous “donkey sentences” that were\nalready discussed by scholastic philosophers, and in modern times were\nreintroduced into philosophy by Geach (1962). In these cases it is\nobvious that the pronouns don’t refer, so they can’t be coreferential\nwith their antecedents, either. Nor are the pronouns bound by their\nantecedents, for they aren’t c-commanded by them. The constituent\nstructure of [7b] is roughly as follows: Whatever the syntactical details, “a donkey” is too\ndeeply embedded for it to c-command “it”. The same goes\nfor [7a]. Hence, the neuter pronouns in [7a,b] cannot be construed as\nbound variables. Another way of showing that donkey pronouns are problematic is by\nconsidering how we might render these sentences in predicate\nlogic. The most obvious interpretation of [7a] is that Pedro beats\nevery donkey he owns, and [7b] is naturally interpreted as claiming\nthat every farmer beats every donkey he owns. (So, somewhat\nsurprisingly, it appears that the indefinites in these sentences have\nuniversal force.) These readings may be captured as follows: So the problem is not that predicate logic fails to capture the\nmeanings of [7a] and [7b]. The problem is, rather, how to derive [9a]\nand [9b] from [7a] and [7b] in a principled way. In order to derive\nthese logical forms, we have to assume not only that an indefinite\nexpression buried in a subordinate position ends up having wide scope,\nbut also that it acquires universal force in the process. A theory\nbased on such assumptions might capture the facts, but it would be\nclearly ad hoc, and would generate a host of false predictions, as\nwell. The upshot of the foregoing observations is that, apparently,\nindefinites are neither quantifiers nor referential terms, and this\nproblem entrains another one, for as long as it is unclear what\nindefinites mean, it will also remain obscure how they can serve as\nantecedents to pronouns. Later on we will see that very similar\nproblems arise in seemingly disparate domains, like the interpretation\nof tense and presuppositions. This section introduces DRT in fairly informal terms. We show how a\nhearer builds up a mental model of the ongoing discourse, dealing not\nonly with simple sentences, but also with conditionals,\nquantification, and anaphora, and we discuss DRT’s treatment of\nindefinites, and how they are set apart from quantifying\nexpressions. A discourse representation structure (DRS) is a mental\nrepresentation built up by the hearer as the discourse unfolds. A DRS\nconsists of two parts: a universe of so-called “discourse\nreferents”, which represent the objects under discussion, and a\nset of DRS-conditions which encode the information that has\naccumulated on these discourse referents. The following DRS represents\nthe information that there are two individuals, one of which is a\nfarmer, the other a donkey, and that the former chased the latter: The universe of this DRS contains two discourse\nreferents, x\nand y, and its condition set is\n{farmer(x),\ndonkey(y),\nchased(x,y)}. A DRS like the one in [1] can be given a straightforward\nmodel-theoretic interpretation. In DRT this is done by means\nof embedding functions, which are partial functions\nfrom discourse referents to individuals in a given model M;\nor put otherwise, an embedding function is a partial variable\nassignment. An embedding function f verifies\n[1] in M iff the domain of f includes at\nleast x\nand y, and according to M\nit is the case that f(x)\nis a farmer, f(y) is a\ndonkey, and f(x)\nchased f(y). Meanwhile it will have become clear that the DRS in [1] is designed\nto reflect the intuitive meaning of: Indeed, it is claimed that, in the absence of any information about\nthe context in which this sentence is uttered, [1] is the semantic\nrepresentation of [2]. So the indefinite expressions “a\nfarmer” and “a donkey” prompt the introduction of\ntwo new discourse referents, x\nand y, and contribute the\ninformation that x is a farmer\nand y a donkey, while the verb\ncontributes the information that the former chased the latter. If a discourse begins with an utterance of [2], the DRS in [1] is\nconstructed, and this DRS forms the background against which the next\nutterance is interpreted. Suppose now that [2] is followed by a token\nof [3a]: [3b] is the DRS that reflects the semantic content of [3a] before\nthe pronouns are resolved. In this DRS, the anaphoric pronouns\n“he” and “it” in [3a] are represented by the\ndiscourse referents v\nand w, respectively. These\ndiscourse referents are underlined to indicate that they require an\nantecedent. Since [3a] is uttered in the context of [1], the next step\nin the interpretation of this sentence is to merge the DRS in [3b]\nwith that in [1]. The result of this merging operation is [4a]: Since [3a] is immediately preceded by [2], the antecedent of\n“he” is probably (though not necessarily) “a\nfarmer”, while “it” is anaphorically dependent on\n“a donkey”. At the DRS level, this is represented by equating\nthe discourse referents v\nand w\nwith x\nand y, respectively. These\noperations yield [4b], which is equivalent to [4c].  Either DRS is\nverified in a model M iff M features a farmer who\nchased and caught a donkey. Thus far, we have only considered DRSs with simple conditions, but\nin order to account for negated and conditional sentences, say,\ncomplex conditions are required. [5b] is the sentence DRS corresponding to [5a]. This DRS contains a\ncondition that consists of a DRS prefixed by a negation sign. For ease\nof reference we will sometimes adorn DRSs with numerical labels, as we\nhave done in [5b], and use these in names like\n“[5b1]”, “[5b2]”, and so\non. In general, labeling of DRSs will be top-down and left-to-right,\nso the main (or principal) DRS will always be number one. A function f verifies [5b1] in a\nmodel M iff f\nmaps x onto an individual\nin M which “is a Pedro”, i.e., which is called\n“Pedro”, and f cannot be extended to a\nfunction g which verifies [5b2]. That is to say,\nno such g should map y\nonto a donkey that Pedro owns. [5b2] contains a token of the discourse\nreferent x which is introduced\nexternally, in the DRS in which [5b2] is embedded, i.e.,\n[5b1]. Apart from that, [5b2] also introduces a\ndiscourse referent of its own,\ni.e., y, which is associated with\nthe indefinite NP “a donkey”, and whose scope is delimited\nby [5b2]. Consequently, it doesn’t make sense to refer\nto y outside of [5b2].\nIn DRT, this is taken to explain why the “lifespan” of the\nindividual introduced by the indefinite NP in [5a] is delimited by the\nscope of the negation operator. If [5a] were followed by [6a], for\nexample, the pronoun could not be linked to the indefinite: If we merge [5b] and [6b], which is the sentence DRS corresponding\nwith [6a], we obtain [6c]. In this representation, the discourse\nreferent z does not have access\nto y,\nbecause y is introduced in a DRS\nthat is not accessible to the DRS in\nwhich z is introduced, and\ntherefore it is not possible to\nbind z\nto y.  In other words, if [6a] is\npreceded by [5a], the pronoun cannot be anaphorically linked to the\nindefinite. This prediction appears to be correct. Accessibility is in the first instance a relation between DRSs;\nderivatively, it is also a relation between discourse\nreferents. [6c1] is accessible to [6c2], but not\nthe other way round, and therefore the discourse referents introduced\nin [6c1], i.e., x\nand z, are accessible from\n[6c2], but conversely, if we are in [6c1] we\nhave no access to [6c2] and its discourse referents,\ni.e., y.  Thus in [6c] anaphora is\nnot possible because y is not\naccessible to z. In [4a], by\ncontrast, anaphora is possible,\nbecause x\nand y are accessible\nto v\nand w (the accessibility relation\nbeing reflexive). The notion of accessibility is crucial to DRT’s\naccount of anaphora, and it is important to note that it is not\nstipulated, but is entailed by the semantics of the DRS\nlanguage. [6c1] is accessible to [6c2] because\nevery embedding function that must be considered for [6c2]\nis an extension of an embedding function for [6c1], and it\nis for this reason that every discourse referent in [6c1]\nis also defined in [6c2]. The converse, however, does not\nhold. Like negated sentences, conditionals give rise to complex\nDRS-conditions, too. (7) gives an example: [7b] is the sentence DRS which corresponds to [7a], and assuming\nfor convenience that this sentence is uttered in an empty context, it\nis also the initial DRS of the discourse. The complex condition in\nthis structure is interpreted as follows: if f is to verify\n[7b1] in the current model,\nthen f(x) must be an\nindividual called “Pedro”, and every extension\nof f which verifies [7b2] must itself be extendable\nto a function that verifies [7b3]. It follows from this that\n[7b1] is accessible to [7b2], which in its turn is\naccessible to [7b3], and\ntherefore v may be linked up\nto x (accessibility being a\ntransitive relation) and w\nto y.  The result is [7c], which\nis equivalent to [7d], both DRSs saying that Pedro beats every donkey\nhe owns.\n The interpretation of quantified donkey sentences is very similar\nto what we have just seen: There are two ways of spelling out the interpretation of\nso-called duplex conditions of the\nform K(∀x)K′. On its\nweak interpretation, [8a] means that every farmer who owns a donkey\nbeats at least one of the donkeys he owns; on its strong\ninterpretation the sentence says that every farmer beats every donkey\nhe owns. While the strong reading is the most natural choice for [8a],\nother donkey sentences prefer a weak reading: The most likely interpretation for [9] to have is that every\ntractor-owning farmer uses one of their tractors to drive to church. The distinction between weak and strong interpretations is somewhat\nmysterious, because it doesn’t seem to be an ordinary ambiguity. For\nexample, donkey sentences with existential quantifiers don’t seem to\nlicense strong readings: This can only be construed as saying that some donkey-owning\nfarmers beat at least one of their donkeys. More generally, the\nuniversally quantified donkey sentences seem to be the only ones to\nlicense both interpretations. It is not entirely clear why this should\nbe the case (see Kanazawa 1994, Geurts 2002). Whether weak or strong, the interpretation of a condition of the\nform K(Qx)K′,\nwhere Q may be any quantifier,\nmakes K accessible\nto K′, and in this respect\n(which is the fulcrum of the DRT analysis) conditionals and quantified\nsentences are the same. Consequently, the discourse\nreferents x\nand y in [8b2] are\naccessible to v\nand w in [8b3], and the\nlatter may be equated to the former.  The resulting representation is\n[8c], which is equivalent to [8d]. The DRT analysis of quantified expressions like “all”\nor “most” is fairly standard. A quantifier binds a\nvariable and delivers the truth conditions one should\nexpect. Indefinites are different. An indefinite like “a\ndonkey” is treated not as a quantifier but simply as device for\nintroducing a discourse referent and one or more conditions; on the\nDRT account, indefinites have no quantifying force of their own. What\nquantifying force they seem to have is not theirs, but derives from\nthe environment in which they occur. If the semantic material\nassociated with “a donkey” is introduced in the main DRS,\nas in [4c], the quantifying effect will be existential, owing to the\nfact that this DRS is verified in a model M iff there\nis a way of verifying it in M. If the semantic\nmaterial associated with “a donkey” is introduced in the\nantecedent of a conditional, as in [7d], the quantifying effect will\nbe universal, owing to the fact that a\ncondition of the form K⇒K′ is\nverified in M iff every way of\nverifying K can be extended to a\nway of verifying K′. This\nview on indefinites lies at the heart of DRT. DRT was one of the first semantic theories to go beyond the\nsentence boundary, and take into account how the interpretation of an\nexpression may depend on the preceding discourse. Looking back at the\nexamples discussed in the foregoing, we see that, if the DRT approach\nis on the right track, sentence boundaries are not as important as the\nFregean (or Chomskyan) conception of language would have it. In particular, there is\nessentially no difference between the DRT analysis of cross-sentential\nanaphora, as exemplified by the mini-discourse [2]-[3a], and\nsentence-internal anaphora, as in [7a] or [9a]. In either case, the\npronoun simply serves to pick up an accessible discourse\nreferent. This raises the question of how DRT’s new-fangled notion of\nanaphora relates to the dichotomy between referential and\nbound-variable pronouns.  Curiously, this issue doesn’t seem to have\nreceived much attention yet. In the foregoing we assumed that the contribution of a sentence to\nthe discourse, as represented by a DRS, was obtained in two steps. In\nthe first one, a sentence DRS was constructed in a compositional way;\nthis part of the construction process we took for granted, but its\nimplementation wouldn’t be too difficult. In the second step, the\nsentence DRS was merged with the DRS representing the prior discourse,\nand anaphoric references were resolved. This two-stage procedure has\nbecome the industrial standard, but the original version of DRT (Kamp\n1981, Kamp and Reyle 1993) was monostratal in the sense that one set\nof rules took care of both tasks at once. In the meantime, Kamp and\nhis co-workers have adopted the two-step method, too (e.g., Kamp et\nal.  2011). In one-level versions of DRT, a single set of rules is used to\nobtain the semantic contribution of a sentence. To take a simple\nexample, if the sentence is “It is grey”, the first rule\nto apply will say that the semantic correlate of the subject is an\nargument to the predicate expressed by “is grey”. Then the\ntwo main parts of the sentence are analysed further, and the pronoun\n“it” triggers a rule which at once deals with the\npronoun’s lexical content and its context dependence; i.e., it says\nthat we must select a new discourse referent, link it to a discourse\nreferent made available by the preceding discourse, and update the DRS\nso as to record these changes. In two-level versions of DRT there is\nno such rule. Its duties are divided between two separate\nmechanisms. In the first stage, a separate DRS is constructed for the\nsentence, in which pronouns prompt the introduction of new discourse\nreferents that are marked as being anaphoric (we use underlining for\nthis purpose). In the second stage, there is a general mechanism for\ndealing with discourse referents thus marked. The distinction between one- and two-level versions of DRT is of\ninterest for at least two reasons. First, once we go beyond basic DRT,\nthe two-stage system may actually be more economical overall. For\nexample, if DRT is extended for dealing with presuppositions (see\nSection 5), the one-pass approach becomes unwieldy. Secondly, and\nperhaps more importantly, two-stage theories may be viewed as\nimplementing a distinction between semantics and pragmatics which has\nsome prima facie plausibility: in the first stage a representation is\ncomputed which is projected from the sentence’s lexico-grammatical\nstructure, while in the second stage, context-dependent aspects of\nmeaning are dealt with.  This division of labor is reminiscent of the\ntraditional dichotomy between compositional semantics and\nnon-compositional pragmatics, but it should be noted that the two do\nnot coincide. Usually, the “semantical” part of a\ntwo-stage version of DRT is not compositional in the Fregean sense,\nbecause its output is essentially incomplete; it may contain anaphoric\n“gaps”, for example. Therefore, even if a sentence DRS\nadmits of a truth-conditional interpretation, it will typically fall\nshort of capturing everything that is conventionally thought to belong\nto truth-conditional content. In this section we give a more precise description of the DRS\nlanguage than we have done so far. We define the syntax of the\nlanguage, present a model-theoretic interpretation, and discuss the\nnotion of accessibility, which figures so prominently in DRT’s account\nof anaphora. DRSs are set-theoretic objects built from discourse\nreferents and DRS-conditions.  A\nDRS-condition is either atomic, in which case it consists of a\npredicate and a suitable number of discourse referents, or complex, in\nwhich case it embeds one or two DRSs. Hence, the definition of the DRS\nlanguage is by simultaneous recursion: DRSs and DRS-conditions Note that there are no conditions corresponding to conjoined\nsentences. Such sentences are dealt with, rather, by merging the DRSs\nassociated with their parts, where the merge of two DRSs\nK and\nK′\nis defined as their pointwise union: DRS-merge The merge operation is also used for combining a sentence DRS with\nthe DRS representing the preceding discourse, so the idea is that\nthere is no principled distinction between (clausal) conjunction and\nsentence concatenation (see Muskens 1996 for discussion). Officially, DRSs are set-theoretical objects, but in this article\nwe use a linear notation. Many sources, including Kamp’s own work,\nemploy a graphical “box notation” which is sometimes\nclearer, but less parsimonious and more difficult to type. To\nillustrate the various schemes, here are three ways of representing\nthe content of a conditional donkey sentence: The choice between these formats is one of convenience, and does\nnot have any theoretical significance. Accessibility is a relation between DRSs that is transitive and\nreflexive, i.e., it is a preorder. More in particular, it is the\nsmallest preorder for which the following holds, for all\nDRSs K, K′,\nand K″:\nif ConK\ncontains a condition of the form … To illustrate, in the following schematic representations, every\nDRS is accessible to all and only those DRSs whose number doesn’t\nprecede its own (so every DRS is accessible to itself): The accessible domain of a\nDRS K, AK,\nis the set of discourse referents that occur in\nsome K′ that is accessible\nto K,\ni.e., AK =\n{x:  K′ is accessible\nto K\nand x\n∈ UK′}.\nThe main constraint which DRT imposes on the interpretation of\nanaphora is this: Accessibility constraint \nA pronoun is represented by a discourse\nreferent x which must be equated\nto some discourse referent y\n∈ AK,\nwhere K is the DRS in\nwhich x is introduced. It is important to note that neither the notion of accessibility\nnor the accessibility constraint need be stipulated. For, as we will\npresently see, both follow from the way the DRS language is\ninterpreted (cf. the notion of variable binding in standard predicate\nlogic).  Thus, we are not at liberty to modify the accessibility\nrelation, should we wish to do so, unless we simultaneously revise the\ntruth conditions associated with the DRS language. The accessibility\nconstraint is a semantic one. As discussed in Section 2, the main syntactic constraint on\nbound-variable pronouns is that they be c-commanded by their\nantecedents. The domain of the accessibility constraint overlaps with\nthat of the c-command constraint, but it is wider. For one thing,\nsentence boundaries don’t affect accessibility. For another, within\nthe confines of a sentence, the semantic correlate of an\nexpression E1 may be accessible to that\nof E2, even if E1 doesn’t\nc-command E2.  To illustrate this point, consider\nthe conditional donkey sentence in [1a] and its sentence DRS in\n[1b]: Syntactically speaking, neither “a farmer” nor “a\ndonkey” can bind (in the sense of Chomsky 1986) an expression\nbeyond the smallest clause in which they occur. In particular, neither\ncan bind any of the pronouns in the main clause of [1a]. But the\ndiscourse referents associated with these indefinites,\ni.e., x\nand y, are in the accessible\ndomain of [1b3], and therefore the anaphoric discourse\nreferents in this embedded DRS can be linked\nto x\nand y. Put otherwise, they are\nbindable at a semantic but not at a syntactic level. The truth-conditional semantics of the DRS language is given by\ndefining when an embedding function verifies a DRS in\na given model. An embedding function is a partial mapping from\ndiscourse referents to individuals. Given two embedding\nfunctions f and g and a\nDRS K, we say that g\nextends f with respect\nto K,\nor f[K]g for\nshort, iff Dom(g) = Dom(f)\n∪ UK, and\nfor all x\nin Dom(f): f(x)\n= g(x).  Viewing\nfunctions as set-theoretic objects, this can be formulated more\nsuccinctly as follows:\n In the following we define what it takes for an embedding function\nto verify a DRS or DRS-condition in a given model. As usual, a\nmodel M is a pair <D,I>, where D is a\nset of individuals, and I is an interpretation function that\nassigns sets of individuals to one-place predicates, sets of pairs to\ntwo-place predicates, and so on. To enhance the legibility of our\ndefinition somewhat we omit the qualifier “in M”\nthroughout: Verifying embeddings The last clause gives a strong interpretation to universal duplex\nconditions (cf. Section 3.2); the weak interpretation is obtainable as\nfollows: A DRS is true in a given model iff we can find a verifying\nembedding for it, as follows: Truth A DRS K is true in a\nmodel M iff there is an embedding function f such\nthat Dom(f) =\n UK\n and f verifies\nK in M. To see how accessibility follows from these definitions, the\ncritical junctures are the points at which extensions of embedding\nfunctions are called for. For example, consider a schematic DRS with a\nconditional in it: This DRS is true iff we can find an embedding\nfunction f, Dom(f) =\n{x}, which verifies all conditions\nin [2], which is to say\nthat f(x) must be\nan A, and f verifies the\ncomplex condition [y: B(x,y)] ⇒ [z:\nC(x,y,z)].  The latter requirement is met iff every\nextension g of f, Dom(g)\n= {x,y}, such that g\nverifies [y: B(x,y)] can be\nextended to a function h, Dom(h)\n= {x,y,z}, such that h\nverifies [z: C(x,y,z)]. Hence, no\nmatter how we\nchoose g, g(x)\nmust be the same individual\nas f(x), and for\nany g, no matter how we\nchoose h, h(x)\nand h(y) must be the same\nas g(x)\nand g(y),\nrespectively. This is why x is in\nthe accessible domain associated with the antecedent of the\nconditional, and why y is in the\naccessible domain associated with the consequent. Having focussed thus far on the interpretation of anaphoric\npronouns, the purpose of this section is to illustrate how the ideas\nlying at the heart of DRT have been applied to other phenomena. We\nwill restrict ourselves to three topics: tense, presupposition, and\npropositional attitudes. In the first two cases, we will encounter\ninterpretative dependencies reminiscent of the dependency relation\nbetween an anaphor and its antecedent, and we will describe, if only\nin outline, how basic DRT has been extended so as to capture the\nsimilarities. DRT’s representationalism comes into its own in its\ntreatment of attitudes and attitude ascriptions, which is the third\ntopic on our list. In section 6 we introduce SDRT, a significant extension of the DRT framework designed to model discourse structure more accurately. In the early 1970s, it was pointed out that there are systematic\nparallels between tenses and pronouns (Partee 1973), and DRT was\npartly born from the conviction that a theory of interpretation should\naccount for these parallels. Partee (1984) herself worked out some of\nthese ideas in the DRT framework. In the following we will briefly\ndiscuss some of Partee’s observations, and outline a DRT\ntreatment. Intuitively, the indefinite description “a donkey” in\nthe opening sentence of [1a] serves to introduce an entity that is\nsubsequently picked up by the pronoun “it” in the second\nsentence, and the DRT account of indefinites and pronouns seeks to\nformalize this intuitive picture. [1b] shows that a very similar\nphenomenon occurs in the temporal domain, for in this case it is\nnatural to construe the past tense of the second sentence as being\nanaphorically dependent on the content of the first: presumably,\nJuanita slapped Pedro right after he tried to kiss her. In order to\ncapture this idea, DRT adopts an event-based semantics, treating\nevents as semantic values of a designated class of discourse\nreferents. Sentences are now construed like indefinite descriptions in\nthat they, too, serve to introduce discourse referents. For example,\nthe first sentence in [1b] introduces a discourse referent of the\nevent type that represents Pedro’s attempting to kiss Juanita, and the\ntense morpheme in “slapped” is construed as referring\nback, very much like an anaphoric pronoun, to that event: by default,\nthe time of Juanita’s slapping Pedro will be taken to be immediately\nafter the time of him trying to kiss her. Our second example involves what one might call “donkey\ntense”: In an event-based semantics, it is natural to construe [2b] as\nquantifying over events, just like [2a] quantifies over\nindividuals. In conjunction with the DRT treatment of quantification,\nthis allows us to interpret the tense in “slapped” as\nreferring back to the event introduced in the subordinate clause,\nalong the following lines (where ⊃⊂ stands for\nthe “right after”\nrelation, e″ is the variable\nintroduced by the tense in “slapped”,\nand e″ indicates\nthat e″ requires an\nantecedent): In [3a] the tense introduces an anaphoric element, which can be\nbound in the restrictor of the quantifier, just as an ordinary donkey\npronoun might be bound. The result, after a minor simplification, is\n[3b], which says that every event e of Pedro trying to kiss Juanita is\nimmediately followed by an event e′ of her slapping him. Note\nthat, although this DRS captures the most natural interpretation of\nthe past tense in “slapped”, it leaves the past tense in\n“tried” unaccounted for. But this is as it should be, for\nif tense is anaphoric, then that tense, too, should be linked to a\nsalient time point, which seems to be right: in the absence of a\ncontext that furnishes such a time, [2b] is simply infelicitous; it is\nlike saying “He is handsome” when it is not clear whom the\npronoun is intended to refer to. Presuppositions are chunks of information associated with\nparticular lexical items or syntactic constructions. There are many\nsuch items and constructions, and the following is just a small\nselection:  Factive verbs It-clefts Definites Someone who utters any of the [a] sentences commits himself to the\ntruth of the respective [b] sentence. Of course, this does nothing to\ndistinguish presuppositions from ordinary entailments, but the\ndifference becomes apparent when we embed presuppositional expressions\nor constructions in non-entailing environments, as in: Here [5a] is embedded in the scope of a negation and a modal\noperator, respectively, and it appears that these sentences commit a\nspeaker to the truth of [5b] just as much as [5a] does. This behavior\nsets presuppositions apart from ordinary entailments. Generally speaking, presuppositions tend to escape\nfrom any embedded position in the sense that, if a\nsentence S contains a presupposition-inducing\nexpression P, an utterance of S will usually imply\nthat P holds. This is only generally speaking, because this\nrule, though correct in the majority of cases, does not hold without\nexceptions: While the [a] sentences would normally commit a speaker to the\nclaim that Pedro has a donkey, the same does not hold for the [b]\nsentences.  It appears, therefore, that presuppositions are typically\nthough not invariably inherited by the sentences in which they\noccur. This is the so-called “projection problem” for\npresuppositions. Considering that anaphora and presupposition were widely discussed\nfrom the late 1960s onwards, it took a remarkably long time before it\nwas discovered that, in some respects at least, the two phenomena are\nvery similar (van der Sandt 1992, Kripke 2009). To see how, consider\nthe following pairs: It is true that the variants with the\n“that”-complements are slightly odd, but actually the fact\nthat they are proves the point we want to make; for it is clear that,\nin these examples, the pronoun “it” and the clause\n“that he owns a donkey” perform the same duty, and if the\nlatter sounds somewhat off it is presumably because the former does\nthe job just as well. While the factive verb “know” triggers the\npresupposition that its clausal complement is true, this\npresupposition is neutralized in [10b] and [10c]. If presuppositions\nbehave similarly to anaphoric pronouns, it is clear why that should be\nso: in both cases, the presupposition is bound\nsentence-internally, just like the neuter pronoun is bound. Presupposed information is information that is presented as given,\nand according to the so-called “binding theory” of\npresupposition this means that presuppositions want to have discourse\nreferents to bind to (van der Sandt 1992, Geurts 1999).  However,\nwhereas anaphoric pronouns are rarely interpretable in the absence of\na suitable antecedent, the same does not hold for all\npresupposition-inducing expressions. For instance, a speaker may\nfelicitously assert that he met “Pedro’s sister” even if\nhe knows full well that his audience wasn’t aware that Pedro has a\nsister. In such cases, Karttunen (1974) and Stalnaker (1974)\nsuggested, presuppositions are\ngenerally accommodated, which is to say that the\nhearer accepts the information as given, and revises his\nrepresentation of the context accordingly. Accommodation, thus\nunderstood, is a form of exploitation in Grice’s sense: the purpose of\npresuppositional expressions is to signal that this or that\ninformation is given, and if some information is new but not\nparticularly interesting or controversial (like the fact that somebody\nhas a sister) the speaker may choose to “get it out of the\nway” by presuppositional means. The binding theory incorporates the notion of accommodation as\nfollows. Presuppositions, according to the theory, introduce\ninformation that prefers to be linked to discourse referents that are\nalready available in the DRS, and in this respect they are like\npronouns. However, if a suitable discourse referent is not available,\na new one will be accommodated, and the presupposition is linked to\nthat.  Generally speaking, accommodation is not an option in the\ninterpretation of pronouns, and a possible reason for this is that a\npronoun’s descriptive content is relatively poor. Being told that\n“she” is wonderful is not particularly helpful if it isn’t\nclear who the pronoun is meant to refer to. By contrast, if the\nspeaker refers to “Pedro’s sister” there is more to go on,\nand accommodation becomes feasible. Hence, the binding theory views\npronouns as a special class of presuppositional expressions. While all\npresupposition triggers prefer to be bound, pronouns almost always\nmust be bound. According to the binding theory, this is because\npronouns are descriptively attenuated, and therefore cannot be\nconstrued by way of accommodation. Propositional attitudes (mental states like belief, desire, or\nimagination) and attitude ascriptions (sentences like “John\nthinks/hopes that Mary likes him”) have been a rich source of\nphilosophical puzzles. DRT’s representationalism offers fresh\nsolutions to some of them. A central issue in the treatment of attitudes is that of logical\nomniscience: humans are cognitively limited agents, and are not aware\nof all the consequences of their beliefs and desires. On this basis,\nKamp (1990) argues that the objects of thought should not be seen as\npurely model-theoretic entities, for example a set of belief worlds,\nas is common in logics of belief from Hintikka (1962) onwards. Rather,\nthe logic of belief and other attitudes must involve structured mental\nrepresentations. The problem of logical omniscience is then resolved\nin terms of the failure of human agents to perform logically complete\ncomputations over these representations. Modeling the objects of\nattitudes in this way, as representational entities, allows us to make\nthe fine distinctions necessary to distinguish between believing that\nit is raining and believing that if it is not raining then 37 is not\nprime. However, traditional versions of such a sententialist or\nLanguage-of-Thought approach to omniscience typically run into the\nproblem of intentionality: to be useful to us, our attitudes must\nsomehow be about the external world we live in, so we still have to\nexplain how these syntactic representations connect with reality. In a\nHintikka-style possible worlds semantics the link between world and\nattitude is hardwired into the semantics: believing that John is happy\nmeans that the agent takes the actual world to be an element of the\nset of worlds where John is happy. The DRT approach combines these two\nstrategies: use the classic, model-theoretic semantics of the DRS\nlanguage to cash out intentionality in terms of possible worlds, but\nhold on to the representational level to model resource-bounded\ncomputations in practical reasoning.  A special type of intentionality is that of singular or de\nre attitudes: beliefs and desires that directly involve objects\nthe attitude holder is acquainted with. To capture such attitudes,\nKamp (1990) introduces anchors. An internal anchor is a descriptive\nmode of presentation, in the form of a DRS with a distinguished\ndiscourse referent, while an external anchor maps that discourse\n  referent to an actual individual. A full-fledged entity representation comprises an internal and an external anchor, and is a construct closely related to the Mental Files of Recanati (2012) and other neo-Fregean approaches to reference. A complete mental state\nrepresentation then consists of (i) a set of internal anchors and\nattitude descriptions, each consisting of a DRS paired with a mode\nindicator (e.g., ANCH, \nBEL, \nDES) and possibly sharing discourse\nreferents, and (ii) an external anchor mapping the internally anchored\ndiscourse referents to objects of acquaintance. By way of\nillustration, the mental state representation below describes\nmy de re belief that this cup c I’m holding now\ncontains coffee, along with the desire that it is still warm: Compartmentalized mental state representations like this have been\nturned into semantic theories of attitude ascriptions and used to\nsolve a variety of familiar puzzles, such as those involving Kripke’s\n(1979) Pierre who believes Londres is pretty but London is not (Asher\n1986, Kamp 2015), Geach’s (1967) Hob who believes a witch killed his\ncow while Nob believes she, the same witch, blighted his mare (Asher\n1987), specific indefinites (Kamp and Bende-Farkas 2019), presupposition projection out of\n(non-doxastic) attitude ascriptions (Maier 2015), and referring to fictional entities (Maier 2017). Not all DRT treatments of attitude reports rely on a\nrepresentational theory of the underlying mental states\nthemselves. For example, Geurts (1999) and Maier (2010) develop\nanalyses of attitude ascriptions in versions of DRT that use only a\nstandard Hintikka-style possible worlds semantics for attitudes. In\nthe same vein, Maier (2009) and Hunter (2013) explore extensions of\nDRT to deal with directly referential expressions like indexicals and\nproper names without resorting to anchors or mental state\nrepresentations. We’ve seen in sections 3 and 4 above how anaphora resolution\nis constrained by accessibility. But there are many other factors that play a role in\nthe resolution process, from local, grammatical factors like subject\nantecedents being generally more prominent than object antecedents in pronoun\nresolution, to more global, discourse structural factors. Focusing on the latter,\nHobbs (1979) argues that the interpreter’s desire to create a maximally coherent\ninterpretation will often play a decisive role in choosing between multiple\naccessible antecedents for a pronoun, as he illustrates with the following contrast: In [1a] the pronoun binds to John, because that delivers the most coherent\ninterpretation of the two-sentence discourse as a whole. In [1b], by contrast, the\npronoun is bound to Bill. This difference corresponds to a difference in the kind of\ncoherence relations exemplified by the two discourses: [1a] exemplifies a coherence\nrelation known as Elaboration, while [1b] is an instance of Result. That discourse\nrelations play an important role in discourse interpretation is shown by examples like\n  [2] (again from Hobbs 1979).  Reading [2] you might wonder if Turkish spinach is really that much better than\nwhat you can get in France, which shows to what lengths we go to accommodate a\nsuitable coherence relation, in this case Explanation, before we give up our quest for\n  a coherent interpretation.    Asher and Lascarides (2003) take the idea that pronoun resolution and the\ninference of coherence relations between discourse units are closely related processes\nas the starting point for their Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT),\ncombining DRT with insights from discourse coherence theories like Hobbs’s. SDRT\nassumes a set of discourse relations (Narration, Result, Contrast, Explanation,\nElaboration, Correction, to name a few) that we may infer to connect the\npropositions expressed by the individual sentences (or clauses), in order to create a\nmaximally coherent interpretation of the discourse as a whole. Different discourse\nrelations may impose different constraints on anaphora resolution over and\nabove DRT’s accessibility. Take the example in [3] (Asher and Lascarides\n  2003). In standard DRT the salmon introduced in [3c] would provide a suitable and\naccessible antecedent for the pronoun in [3f], but in fact this resolution appears to be\nunavailable. SDRT explains this observation in terms of a discourse structural\nconstraint known as the Right Frontier Constraint. This constraint is best illustrated\nby drawing a discourse structure graph like the one below. A horizontal arrow in this\ngraph indicates a coordinating discourse relation (where neither relatum dominates\nthe other), in this case Narration. A vertical arrow indicates a subordinating\ndiscourse relation (where a nucleus dominates a satellite), in this case Elaboration.\n SDRT’s version of the Right Frontier Constraint says that the pronoun in [3f] can\nonly find an antecedent introduced in the node that was just introduced ([3e]), or one\n  that dominates it ([3a]).    More formally, an SDRS consists of such a discourse structure graph, where each\nvertex corresponds to a discourse relation and each node to a DRS. A common SDRS\nnotation extends the familiar box notation of DRT (see section 4) with labels for\n  elementary and complex discourse units: Anaphora and presupposition resolution rely on a modified notion of\naccessibility that incorporates the Right Frontier Constraint. The\nmodel-theoretic interpretation of an SDRS is built around a set of\nspecial interpretation rules for the various discourse\nrelations. Narration for instance comes with a semantic interpretation\nrule that states that the both relata hold and moreover the main\nevents they introduce stand in a relation of temporal\nprogression. Some notational\nshortcuts: Kπ is the DRS\nassociated with label π (i.e. the K such\nthat π : K occurs somewhere in the\nSDRS); eπ is the unique event\ndiscourse referent that occurs\nin U(Kπ) (for readability\nwe left out event referents from the example SDRS above, but for the purpose of modelling narrative temporal progression in SDRT we should treat every verb phrase as introducing an event discourse referent). Note that conditions of the form πn : K are not interpreted directly as semantic conditions on their own, but instead serve to associate DRS contents with\n proposition labels. DRT is a representational theory of interpretation. In the DRT\nframework, sentences have meanings, if at all, only in a derivative\nsense: a sentence prompts the hearer to modify his DRS, and it is DRSs\nthat have a truth-conditional interpretation. Thus, a sentence causes\na DRS Ki to be\ntransformed into a\nDRS Ki+1 (usually,\nthough not invariably, the process will consist in adding information\nto Ki), and at a remove\nthere is an associated transition at the semantical level,\nfrom Ki’s\ninterpretation\nto Ki+1’s.  Hence, if\nwe could cut out the representational middleman, we would have a\ntheory that defines sentence meaning in dynamic terms, as a transition\nfrom one semantic object to another. Thus arises the question of\nwhether or not the representational level can be dispensed with. Kamp\n(1981) claimed that representations were essential to\nhis ur-version of DRT, which was a subset of our\nbasic DRT, but in the meantime he was proved wrong by a slew of\ndynamic theories that recast classical DRT in purely semantical terms:\nBarwise (1987), Rooth (1987), Groenendijk and Stokhof (1989, 1991),\nMuskens (1996), and many more. However, Kamp’s claim still holds for\nvarious extensions of classical DRT, like the theories of\npresupposition and attitude ascription discussed in the foregoing. These theories are allegedly “non-representational”,\nbut what exactly does that mean? Consider, for example, Groenendijk\nand Stokhof’s (1991) Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL), which provides a\ndynamic semantics for the language of classical predicate logic, in\nwhich “Pedro owns a donkey and beats it” may be rendered\nas follows: DPL’s semantics ensures that, unlike in classical logic, the last\noccurrence of x is bound by the existential quantifier. The\nway this works is that DPL analyzes sentence meanings in terms of\nvariable assignments, which are manipulated by the logical constants\nin such as way that [1] is true in a model M iff M’s\ndomain features an individual which, when assigned to the\nvariable x, makes each of the atomic sentences in [1] come\nout true in M. Formally, this is implemented by stipulating\nthat the meaning of a sentence is a relation between variable\nassignments. A variable assignment is a mapping from variables to individuals,\nand variables are linguistic expressions, so it can hardly be claimed\nthat assignments are non-representational entities. Therefore, it is a\nbit puzzling that, in contrast to DRT, DPL is widely seen as a\nnon-representational variety of dynamic semantics. True, DRT’s\nrepresentationalism goes quite a bit further than DPL’s, and the two\ntheories are obviously very different in this respect, but both\ntheories import representational elements into semantics, and this\nholds for dynamic theories of semantics generally (though see Dekker\n2012 for exceptions). Note, incidentally, that DRT’s representationalism is not\nparticularly troubling from a psychological point of view. For if we\nadopt a cognitivist perspective, and view DRT as a (somewhat abstract)\ntheory of the psychology of interpretation, then its\nrepresentationalism wouldn’t be particularly controversial, since for\nmost psychologists, the controversy is not over whether there exist\nmental representations, but over what they are like.  One way in which DRT’s representationalism manifests itself as\nbeing more radical than other theories’ is that it is a\nnon-compositional theory as well. These two features are intertwined.\nConsider, for instance, the way pronouns are interpreted in basic DRT,\nby first setting up a discourse referent, which is subsequently linked\nto another discourse referent. This is a non-deterministic process,\nbut even if it were not, it is clear that the anaphoric link is not\npart of the meaning of the pronoun. A standard statement of\ncompositionality would say that the meaning of a compound expression\nmust be a function of the meaning of their components and their mode\nof combination. But if some of the components, like pronouns, do not\nintroduce into the DRS any object that can naturally be described as\nthe meaning of that object, then it is clear that we do not have a\ncompositional system. How bad is it that we lose compositionality? It is generally agreed\nthat some of the standard arguments for compositionality are not\nparticularly compelling. In particular, we don’t need compositionality\nto explain why people can understand an indefinite number of\nsentences, and we don’t need it for explaining how languages can be\nlearned. To explain such facts, it suffices that there is some\nprocedure for establishing the meanings of sentences, but it is not\nstrictly necessary for this procedure to be compositional.\nCompositionality is often viewed as a methodological principle\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1989, 1991; Janssen 1997; Dever 1999), since\nany model of interpretation can be made compositional if we are\nsufficiently relaxed about the nature of lexical meanings and/or the\nsyntactic structures over which the compositional theory is\ndefined. In the case of DRT, the standard approaches to making the\nsystem compositional involve dispensing with Kamp’s construction\nalgorithm, and replacing it with a system in which DRSs can be\ncomposed either through suitable merge operations (Zeevat 1989b), or,\nin dynamic semantic systems like those of Groenendijk and Stokhof\n(1989) and Muskens (1996), through use of function application in a\nlambda calculus. But while most such systems capture meanings for\nsentences that are closely related to those of original DRT, they do\nnot capture every aspect of DRT. In particular, whereas anaphora\nresolution is an integral part of DRT, in compositional theories anaphora resolution is\nassumed to be performed by a separate component of the theory. Representationalism and compositionality are issues that have\nproduced great disagreement amongst semanticists and philosophers of\nlanguage, though less so nowadays than they did in the 1980s. The\nmethodological view of compositionality has reduced what appeared once\nto be a substantive argument to a matter of taste, and as regards DRT\nit has been shown that researchers who care about compositionality are\nfree to adopt a variant of the original system with many of its\nfeatures, but none of its non-compositionality. But\nrepresentationalism may be a more serious issue, for if it is true, as\nwe have suggested, that dynamic theories generally rely on a notion of\nmeaning that contains at least some form of representation, then that\nnotion could do with a bit more philosophical attention than it has\nreceived so far.
