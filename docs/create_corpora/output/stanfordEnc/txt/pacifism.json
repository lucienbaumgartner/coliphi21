Our\nordinary language allows a diverse set of beliefs and commitments to be\nheld together under the general rubric of pacifism. This article will\nexplain the family resemblance among the variety of pacifisms. It will\nlocate pacifism within deontological and consequentialist approaches to\nethics. And it will consider and reply to objections to pacifism.\n\n\n\nThe word “pacifism” is derived from the word\n“pacific,” which means “peace making” [Latin,\npaci- (from pax) meaning “peace”\nand -ficus meaning “making”]. Modern usage has\nbeen traced to 1901 and Émile Artaud’s usage of the French\nterm pacifisme.  But the basic commitment to peace is an old\nidea. Pacifist sentiment can be found, for example, in the West in\nearly Christianity. Perhaps the most famous use of the word pacifism\nis found in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5), where Jesus\nclaims that the “peacemakers” are blessed. In this\npassage, the Greek word\neirenopoios is translated into Latin as pacifici,\nwhich means those who work for peace. The Greek eirenopoios is\nderived from the Greek eirênê [peace] in\nconjunction with poiesis [to make].\n\n Philosophical discussions of pacifism have clarified the concept\nby distinguishing the more general commitment to nonviolence from a\nnarrower anti-war position. A related term, “nonviolentism,” has been\ncoined by Holmes (Holmes 2013: 157), to describe a position that goes\nbeyond anti-war pacifism in its opposition to violence in all of its\nforms. Pacifism has often been defined dialectically in relation to\nthe idea of justified violence that is found in the Western just war\n tradition.[1]\n Pacifism is often located on a continuum for assessing the morality\nof war that includes realism, just war theory, and pacifism. Indeed,\nthere is an ongoing debate about the proper relation between just war\ntheory and pacifism that focuses on the question of whether the just\nwar theory begins with a pacifist presumption against war. Some\nauthors have used the just war theory to derive a version of pacifism\ndescribed as “contingent pacifism” (May 2015, for example)\nor “just war pacifism” (Sterba 1998). Authors such as\nCheyney Ryan and Robert Holmes more strongly maintain that the just\nwar framework is flawed.  Holmes argues that the just war tradition\ntypically ignores the central moral issue in war, which is about the\npresumptive immorality of the “massive, systematic and deliberate\nkilling of human beings” that occurs in war (Holmes 2017a: xvii).\nRyan argues that although the just war tradition and pacifism\ndeveloped through “mutual critique” pacifism has often been\nmarginalized as an “outcast tradition” (Ryan 2017: 125). \n\n\n\nSome have tried to distinguish “pacific-ism” from\npacifism, where pacific-ism is a commitment to peace and peacefulness\nthat is not strictly opposed to war while pacifism is a more\nprincipled or absolute rejection of violence. But this distinction is\nnot widely accepted (although Dower 2009 employed it). William James\nused the term “pacific-ism” in 1910 to describe his\nrejection of militarism (James 1910). The shorter term,\n“pacifism,” has become more common in English usage to\ndescribe a variety of views that are critical of war. \n\n\n\nGenerally pacifism is thought to be a principled rejection of war and\nkilling. Oddly enough, terminology related to pacifism has\noccasionally been used to describe a pragmatic commitment to using war\nto create peace. Thus a term like “pacification” can be\nemployed in military usage to describe a violent process of\nsuppressing violence, as when an enemy territory is\n“pacified” by killing or disabling the enemy. While George\nOrwell (2002) complained about such euphemistic descriptions of\nviolence, the just war tradition does hold that war can be a suitable\nmeans to bring about peace.  Despite these complications, pacifism\ngenerally connotes a commitment to making peace that rejects violent\nmeans for obtaining this end. One reason to reject violent means is\nthe fact that might does not make right.  While violence can destroy\nan enemy, victory does not amount to justification.\n\n\n\nPacifism, as it is understood in ordinary discourse today, includes a\nvariety of commitments on a continuum from an absolute adherence to\nnonviolence in all actions to a more focused or minimal sort of\nanti-warism. In contrast to the just war tradition, pacifism rejects\nwar as an acceptable means for obtaining peace. Pacifists will often\nrefuse to serve in the military. And some refuse to support political\nand social systems that promote war by, for example, withholding their\ntaxes. Pacifists have been associated with quietistic withdrawal from\npolitical life and even outright anarchism. But pacifists need not be\n“passive”: many committed pacifists have been actively involved in\nnonviolent social protest. Pacifism can be used to describe a\ncommitment to nonviolence in one’s personal life that might include\nthe attempt to cultivate pacific virtues such as tolerance, patience,\nmercy, forgiveness, and love. It might also be extended to include\nnonviolence toward all sentient beings and thus result in a commitment\nto vegetarianism and what Albert Schweitzer (1967) called,\n“reverence for life.” Pacifism can be connected to a\nlarger project of spiritual transformation, as in Gandhi’s commitment\nto ahimsa or nonviolence. And as the author of the present entry has\nargued, pacifism can be understood as offering a comprehensive\nnormative framework (Fiala 2018).\n\n\n\nPacifism is the broad commitment to making peace. The idea is\ncomplicated by the fact that peace is a family resemblance term: there\nare many varieties of peace. Peace is easiest to define dialectically\nas the opposite of war or violence. Pacifism has thus been described\nsimply as anti-warism or as commitment to nonviolence. One conceptual\ndifficulty here is that when peace is defined negatively, pacifism\nappears as a reactionary response to war and violence. Discussions of\npeace thus often employ negative terms and creative neologisms to\nexpress the concept of peace: “nonviolence,”\n“nonwar,” “nonkilling,”\n“nonconflict,” or “nonwar.” Peace advocates\nwill however insist that peace should be understood as a primary\nconcept connected to cooperation, harmony, and positive human\nrelations and that it is a mistake to understand peace in merely\nnegative terms (see Fox 2014). At any rate, peace scholarship has long\nemphasized the distinction between negative peace\nand positive peace: negative peace is the absence of violence\nor war while positive peace encompasses cooperative, tranquil, and\nharmonious relations and the broader concerns of human flourishing and\nintegration (see Galtung 1969; Boersema 2017). \n\nWhen pacifism is defined as anti-warism, we encounter the difficulty\nof defining war. War is usually thought of as violence between states\nor, more broadly speaking, political communities. But the term\n“war” can also be applied to violent conflicts among\nindividuals, as in Hobbes’ idea that the state of nature is a\nstate of war. Similarly, although peace is usually thought of as\na political condition of amicable relations between states, terms like\n“peace” or “peaceful” can also be used to\ndescribe a relation between individuals or even a person’s state\nof mind. \n\nIf pacifism is defined as a commitment to nonviolence, we encounter\nthe same problem of definition.  Violence usually has a normative\nvalue and is defined as something like “an unjustified injury or\nharm.” But it is possible to speak of justified\nviolence—as in the just war ideal; so not all violence is\nunjustified. The concept of violence can also be extended\nmetaphorically and used as an\nadjective—“violent”—to mean something like\nunbridled, uncontrolled, rough, or intense. Thus we speak of\n“violent storms” or “violent emotions.” A\ncommitment to nonviolence is, at least, a commitment to avoiding\nunjustified intentional injury. Pacifists will tend to think that most\nintentionally caused harms are unjustifiable.  But the ideal of\nnonviolence might be extended to include the idea of controlling rough\nand intense emotions. In his essay, “Journey to\nNonviolence,” for example, Martin Luther King Jr. claimed that a\ncommitment to nonviolence required overcoming the “internal\nviolence” of hatred and anger by cultivating love and compassion\n(King 1986, 46). \n\nThere are a variety of possibilities for thinking about the nature\nof peace and thus for understanding what pacifism aims at creating. \n\nPeace can result from submission to power; and war can end with\nunconditional surrender. Rousseau maligned this sort of peace by\ncalling it the “peace of Ulysses and his comrades, imprisoned in\nthe cave of the Cyclops and waiting their turn to be devoured”\n(Rousseau 1917, 125). We might claim that absolute rule and absolute\nsubmission produce a sort of peace. But this is peace conjoined with\ninjustice. So it is clear that the sort of peace that is worth pursuing\nis peace that is also linked to justice. The idea of justice is\nat the heart of the just war tradition, which claims that we are\nentitled to fight back against injustice. As Patrick Henry asked in his\nfamous “Give me Liberty or Give me Death Speech”: “Is\nlife so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of\nchains and slavery?”  One might claim that the peace of the\nCyclops’ cave is not peace at all but a state of war. \n\nMost pacifists will claim that the peace of slavery is not what they\nhave in mind. Rather, for the majority of pacifists, pacifism is not\nsimply acquiescing passively to evil—pacifism is not passive-ism.\nRather, pacifism involves actively but nonviolently resisting evil.\nNonetheless, some pacifists, such as Tolstoy, do advocate\nnonresistance. Nonresistant pacifists in the Christian tradition\noften base the idea of submitting to evil on Jesus’ ideas as\nexpressed in the Sermon on the Mount. “Do not resist one who is\nevil” and “love your enemies and pray for those who\npersecute you” (Matthew 5.39 and 5.44; Luke 6.27–30). Some\nChristian martyrs take this ideal seriously and look to Jesus’\nlife and execution as a model of pacific virtue. \n\nThe dialectical definition of peace as the absence of war can\nencompass the idea of the armed peace of the Cold War. Peace as the\nabsence of war may be a mere modus vivendi in which armed\nopponents refrain from attacking one another out of fear. This sort of\npeace is the peace of a truce or stalemate. While it is true that in\nsuch conditions, there is no overt damage done, the opponents have not\nbeen reconciled and hostile intentions have not been eliminated. \nSome may claim that the best we can do to make peace is to reach a\nstate of detente that is made possible by mutual deterrent force. \nRelated to this is what might be called, following Raymond Aron,\n“peace by impotence” or peace by exhaustion (Aron 1966, 159\nff). In this sort of peace, the antagonistic parties are simply no\nlonger willing to fight. Hostile intentions may persist; but the will\nto fight can no longer be actualized. Kant rejected this sort of peace,\nclaiming that peace means “an end to all hostilities” (Kant\n1991, 93). This is why Kant maintains that the first principle of\nperpetual peace is that states should not make “secret\nreservation of the material for future war” (93). \n\nThose who call themselves “pacifists” will usually agree\nwith Kant that a mere modus vivendi produced by impotence or\nexhaustion is not actually peace, since hostile intent remains. \nAnd pacifists will argue that the peace of deterrence and detente are\nnot really peace either, because they are the result of an increase in\narmaments and the threat of escalating violence.  \n\nOpposed to peace as modus vivendi is what Aron calls,\n“peace by satisfaction” (Aron 1966, 160 ff). This is\na peace that results from a lack of grievances and hostility. In the\nhistory of the West, this sort of peace is often linked to what\nAugustine called the “tranquility of order” (Augustine\n1958, Book 19, Chapter 13)  In recent Western thought, this idea\noften follows Kant in claiming that liberal democracy is the key to\nsuch a tranquil order. \n\nFrancis Fukuyama’s Hegelian idea about the “end of\nhistory,” for example, hoped that the end of the Cold War would\nbring about the end of war in general, as liberal-democracy\nspread (Fukuyama 1992). Similarly, Michael Doyle has claimed that democracies do not\ngo to war with one another (Doyle 1997; see Gursozlu 2017). John Rawls has explained the stability of well-ordered democratic states as follows: “There is true peace\namong them because all societies are satisfied with the status quo for\nthe right reasons” (Rawls 1999, 47). More recently, this idea\nabout the stabilizing and peace-making power of democracy has\ninfluenced neo-conservative ideas in U.S. foreign policy, where the\nhope is that peace will occur as democracy is spread. \n\nThe idea that peace is founded in a just political order is connected\nto the ideas of the just war tradition. Defenders of the just war\ntradition—from Augustine to Walzer—argue that occasionally\nit is necessary to make war in order to establish such a tranquil and\njust social condition. More recent defenders of the just war idea have\nargued that interventionist wars should be fought in order to create\nstable conditions by defending human rights (see \n footnote 1).\n \n\nPacifists will disagree with those who claim that wars should be fought\nin pursuit of the ideal of a just and stable social order. \nProponents of humanitarian intervention maintain that war is a suitable\nmeans for attaining the goal of respect for human rights and\nsatisfaction of human needs; but pacifists will argue that only\nnonviolent means are coherent with the these intended ends. \n\nPositive definitions of peace go beyond merely dialectical definitions\nof peace as the opposite of war and instead focus on peace as a state\nof rest, wholeness, or completion. The peace of a just and tranquil\norder points toward something like a condition of wholeness in which\nthere is solidarity, mutual respect, and satisfaction of needs.  In\nthis vision of peace there is genuine community and human\nflourishing. One central concern from the standpoint of positive peace\nis the work of peace education, as well as work on nonviolent conflict\nresolution and mediation (see Fitz-Gibbon 2010). Related concerns\npoint toward the importance of justice, with a special focus on\nrestorative justice and community building.  However, recent work (Davenport, Melander, and Regan, 2018) in the field of peace studies has argued that positive peace is both too broad and too vague to be of use for empirical work in peace studies. The worry is that the notion of positive peace includes a broad range of social and political concerns (equality, economic justice, environmental sustainability, and so on) that stray far from the core idea of peace as the absence of direct violence.  Despite this criticism, the notion of positive peace remains in use. \n\nThe positive ideal of peace can point beyond the merely political\nrealm and aim toward spiritual transformation. In Christian contexts\nthis is related to the peace of God that surpasses all understanding\n(as in Philippians 4.7). In Buddhism, this is related to the idea\npropounded by Thich Nhat Hanh (1987) of “being peace” that is\nconnected to Buddhist practice. The Dalai Lama claims that peace is\nmore than the absence of war and he connects his vision of world peace\nto peacefulness as a state of mind: “peace is a state of\ntranquility founded on the deep sense of security that arises from\nmutual understanding, tolerance of others’ point of view, and\nrespect for their rights” (Dalai Lama, 202). This is closely\nrelated to the ideal of social stability; but the Dalai Lama also\nconnects it to the deeper process of personal transformation. Building\nupon these ideas, Michael Fox has described “peace as a way of life”:\n“a peaceful way of life will be such as to incorporate nonviolence\ntoward oneself and others, and will be guided by cooperation, mutual\nrespect, creative problem-solving, negotiation of differences, and\ncaring concern or compassion” (Fox 2014, 202). \n\nPositive peace can be best understood from the tradition of virtue\nethics, where peacefulness is understood as a virtue that is connected\nto other virtues such as modesty, tolerance, and mercy. It is important\nto note that peace is not mere quietism and the passivity of meditation\nor contemplation. Jay McDaniel (2005) has argued in favor of a notion\nof “creative peace” in which there is tension and activity\nas individuals and cultures must learn to listen to and interact with\none another. \n\nPacifism includes a wide variety of ideas and commitments. Pacifism has typically been understood as a critical or negative argument against war (or violence), even though the author of the present entry has argued that pacifism could be understood as a comprehensive normative theory that postulates peace as the highest good (Fiala 2018). Pacifism in its broadest sense can be distinguished from application of pacifist critique to particular issues such as: domestic violence (Hall Fitzgibbon 2017), environmental issues (Woods 2017), the death penalty (Steffen 2017), nonhuman animals (Chapple 2017), and so on.  This article will not focus on those applications. Rather, it organizes the variety of pacifisms in several ways according to interrelated conceptual distinctions: absolute and contingent pacifism; maximal and\nminimal pacifism; universal vs. particular pacifism. These\ndistinctions overlap, as we shall see here. \n  \n\nThis distinction organizes different answers to the question of how\nobligated we are to reject violence and war. Absolute pacifism is\nunderstood as a maximal and universal rejection of violence and war.\nAbsolutism in ethics (or moral absolutism) holds that moral principles\nare eternal and unchanging and that they admit no exceptions. So,\nabsolute pacifism holds that war and violence are always wrong. One\nrecent proponent of a version of absolute pacifism is Michael Allen\nFox.  Fox argues that war is inconsistent with morality and with human\nwell-being.  He concludes by asserting a “very strong form of\npacifism” and admits that this results in some uncomfortable\nconclusions, such as that “even military action aimed at protecting\npeople against acute and systematic human-rights violations cannot be\njustified” (Fox 2014, 126). Fox explains that pacifism results in a\ndifficult dilemma that is reminiscent of the question of whether two\nwrongs can make a right. Fox asks, “Should immoral actions be used to\nstop other (perhaps gravely more) immoral actions?”(Fox 2014, 127). He\nanswers “No,” and maintains that this shows us that we have to work to\nfind ways to move beyond our reliance on war as the solution to social\nand political problems.  A similar conclusion has been argued by Holmes who concludes that morality and warfare are “antithetical” (Holmes 2017a p.25). Non-absolute pacifism may be called contingent pacifism. While\nabsolute pacifism admits no exceptions to the rejection of war and\nviolence, contingent pacifism is usually understood as a principled\nrejection of a particular war. A different version of contingent\npacifism can also be understood to hold that pacifism is only an\nobligation for a particular group of individuals and not for\neveryone. Contingent pacifism can also be a principled rejection of a\nparticular military system or set of military policies. Contingent\npacifists may accept the permissibility or even necessity of war in\nsome circumstances and reject it in others, while absolute pacifists\nwill always and everywhere reject war and violence. \n\nAbsolute pacifism is often connected with a religious standpoint in\nwhich nonviolence is seen as a religious commandment. Thomas Merton\nexplains that Gandhi and most other absolute pacifists have a larger\nmetaphysical view: “as Gandhi saw, the fully consistent practice\nof nonviolence demands a solid metaphysical basis both in being and in\nGod” (Merton 1971, 209). In the West, absolute pacifism is often\nderived from the Christian ideal of nonresistance to evil as required\nby Jesus’ pronouncements about nonresistance in the Sermon on the\nMount (in Matthew) or the Sermon on the Plain (in Luke). In Indian\ntraditions, it is grounded in the commitment to ahimsa or nonviolence\nthat is derived from a larger metaphysical picture which emphasizes\nkarmic interdependence, ascetic self-abnegation, and compassion. The\nreligious foundation of absolute pacifism is often tied to the idea\nthat there is merit in suffering violence without retaliating. As\nMartin Luther King Jr. puts this, “unearned suffering is\nredemptive” (King 1986, 18).  \n\nAbsolute pacifism is an ideal.  Some versions of absolute\npacifism go so far as to abjure the idea of personal self-defense.\nOther absolute pacifists may allow for personal self-defense while\nrejecting the impersonal and political violence of war. Almost every\ndefender of absolute pacifism recognizes the difficulty of attaining to\nthe absolute idea. Gandhi writes the following in his autobiography:\n“Man cannot for a moment live without consciously or\nunconsciously committing outward himsa (violence)… A\nvotary of ahimsa (nonviolence) therefore remains true to this\nfaith if the spring of all his actions is compassion, if he shuns to\nthe best of his ability the destruction of the tiniest creature, tries\nto save it, and thus incessantly strives to be free from the deadly\ncoil of himsa. He will be constantly growing in self-restraint and\ncompassion, but he can never become entirely free from outward\nhimsa” (Gandhi 1993, 439). The absolute ideal is nearly\nimpossible to achieve because we must harm other beings in order to\nsurvive: we must kill in order to eat. And the world often presents us\nwith difficult “kill or be killed” choices as in the\nquestion of self-defense or war. Absolute pacifists may hold that it is\nbetter to be killed than to kill. But such a choice may be impossible\nfor many of us to make. Pacifists will often argue that this way of\ndescribing a situation—as one where the choice is “kill or\nbe killed”—usually presents us with a false dilemma: often\nthere are other nonviolent alternatives to either killing or being\nkilled. But when presented with such a stark choice, absolute pacifism\nmay require self-sacrifice. \n\nContingent or conditional pacifism qualifies such an uncompromising\ncondemnation of violence and warfare. Albert Einstein and Bertrand\nRussell, for example, were both supporters of the war against Nazi\nGermany, despite the fact that each considered himself to be a\npacifist. Russell identified his position as what he called\n“relative political pacifism” (Russell 1943). Russell\nuses the word “relative” to describe the contingent nature\nof the commitment to peace: one’s commitment to pacifism depends\nupon or is relative to the nature of the war. Relative pacifism means,\nfor Russell, “that very few wars are worth fighting, and\nthat the evils of war are almost always greater than they seem\nto excited populations at the moment when war breaks out”\n(Russell 1943, 8). Russell calls his position\n“political” because his emphasis is on war and political\ninstitutions, not on a personal commitment to nonviolence.  \nAlong these lines, David Cortright has described what he\ncalls “realistic pacifism.” Cortright claims that in the\nrealm of nuclear war, pacifism is absolute.  But in other sorts of\nconflict, pacifism is “conditional and pragmatic” and\n“predicated on a presumption against armed violence, but it\nacknowledges that the use of force, constrained by rigorous ethical\nstandards, may be necessary at times for self-defense and the\nprotection of the innocent” (Cortright 2008, 334). Such an idea\nis clearly related to just war theory. Indeed, some authors (such as\nLarry May) have derived contingent pacifism from just war\nthinking. \n\nThere are several varieties of contingent pacifism.  A basic distinction to be made here is whether one’s argument against a given war is is merely occasional or situational (what we might call a contingently pacifist argument against a given war); or whether one is offering a broader argument against wars of a certain type or wars that are generally fought under certain conditions (see Fiala 2014; Morrow 2017). \n\nFirst, pacifism may not be required of all moral agents. Thus\npacifism may only be required for members of particular professions.\nPacifism is often thought to be a professional obligation of certain\nreligious vocations. But such a vocation may be thought of as a choice\nof conscience that is not universally required. In this version of\ncontingent pacifism, the prohibition against violence only applies to\nthose who take a vow or make a pledge to renounce violence and war.\nWithin this two-tiered approach, the vow of peacefulness might be\nconsidered as a sort of supererogatory ideal that is not required of\nothers. But it is also possible for the two-tier approach to contain an\nimplicit condemnation of those who do not take up the higher calling of\npacifism. \n\nA second sort of contingent pacifism holds that if a particular war\nor military policy is prudentially unwise it should be resisted. \nSuch prudential pacifism is based upon cost-benefit analyses focused on\nthe facts of particular conflicts. A more principled sort of prudential\npacifism can be based upon the general claim that war usually causes\nmore harm than good.     \n\nA third sort of contingent pacifism will appeal to the just war\ntheory and claim that a given war is unjust according to this theory.\nAs John Rawls says of what he calls “contingent pacifism,”\n“the possibility of a just war is conceded but not under present\ncircumstances” (Rawls 1971, 382). This idea is closely related to\n“just war pacifism” as developed in the last couple of\ndecades by critics of the just war tradition: just war pacifism\nmaintains that modern wars are not fought according to the standards of\nthe just war theory because, for example, they make use of aerial\nbombardment and other means that do not adequately discriminate between\ncombatants and noncombatants. Such a claim may result in a nearly\nabsolute proscription against war under present circumstances. And it\nmay contain an absolute prohibition against certain sorts of war, such\nas nuclear war. Most so-called “just war pacifists” are\ncontingent pacifists in this sense: they object to the way modern wars\nare fought.    \n\nWith the just war theory in mind, contingent pacifism may focus\neither on the basis for war (as in the just war idea of jus ad\nbellum), on the way that the war is being fought (as in the just\nwar idea of jus in bello), or on the expected outcome of the\nwar (as in the idea of jus post bellum). With regard to\njus ad bellum, contingent pacifists may reject the legitimacy\nof the authority who is fighting, they may claim that war is not being\nfought as a last resort, or they may deny that the war is being fought\nfor a just cause. With regard to jus in bello, contingent\npacifist may worry that innocent noncombatants are being harmed or that\nsoldiers are employing means mala in se (such as rape or\ntorture). Finally, with regard to jus post bellum, contingent\npacifists may object to wars that will undermine long-term peace,\njustice, and stability.  \n\nA fourth form of contingent pacifism might be called\n“political pacifism.”  This approach adheres to\npacifism as a strategic political commitment within an adversarial\nsystem. In political discourse, the so-called “doves” are\nusually not absolute pacifists. Rather, they define themselves in\nopposition to the “hawks” who advocate war and funding for\nthe war-system. Political pacifists need not have an absolute\ncommitment to nonviolence; nor need they have a principled commitment\nto the ideas of the just war theory. Rather, they can reject\nmilitaristic policies for strategic political purposes that have to do\nwith budget priorities or other issues. Political pacifism may seem to\nbe merely opportunistic; but opposition parties who offer critical\nperspectives on militarism are an important component of adversarial\ndemocracy. Moreover, political pacifists can end up forming useful\ncoalitions with other more principled pacifists and absolute\npacifists.    \n\nFinally, another version of contingent pacifism can be called,\nfollowing Robert Holmes, “liberal-democratic” or\n“liberal pacifism.”  Holmes argues that modern warfare\nruns counter to the values of liberal-democracy. Thus those who are\ncommitted to liberal values should not support war. Essential for\nthis claim is the idea that “no one has a right to command others\nto kill, and no one is justified in killing on command” (Holmes\n1999, 398). The sort of pacifism that is derived from this claim is\ncontingent upon the fact that modern warfare involves a hierarchically\norganized military system and mass conscription. It is possible that\nwar could be fought without conscription or without military hierarchy;\nbut Holmes argues that this is unlikely in the modern world. Moreover,\nthis sort of pacifism is contingent upon our social and political\ncommitments. Those who are committed to other social and political\nideologies may find that war and the war system are morally and\npolitically acceptable. \n\nContingent pacifism is often based upon empirical and historical\njudgments about the way wars are fought. Such judgments will vary\ndepending upon changing circumstances. And these judgments are also\ncontingent upon the availability of information about why and how wars\nare fought. It is possible, then, that contingent pacifists can admit\nthat there may be conflicting judgments about the justice of a\nparticular war. Unlike contingent pacifism, absolute pacifism rejects\nwar in an a priori fashion: one of the first principles of absolute\npacifism is that war (or violence more generally) is always wrong. Thus\nabsolute pacifism will claim that any judgment that leads to the\njustification of war is wrong. \n\nThe difference between maximal (or broad) and minimal (or narrow)\npacifism has to do with the extent of the commitment to nonviolence.\nThis difference can be explained with reference to the questions of\nwhat sorts of violence are rejected, and who is the recipient or\nbeneficiary of nonviolent concern. Pacifists reject violence and\nwar. But there is an open question about how war and violence are\ndefined and thus about what sorts of actions are rejected by\npacifists. There is, of course, a continuum between maximal and\nminimal pacifism, with maximal pacifism rejecting all forms of war and\nviolence. Minimal versions of pacifism fall away from this in various\ndirections. Maximal pacifism is closely related to absolute and\nuniversal formulations of pacifism; minimal pacifism has more in common\nwith contingent and particular versions of pacifism. \n\nThere are a variety of actions that can be described as\n“war”: terrorism, insurgency, civil war, humanitarian\nintervention, full-fledged inter-state conflict, and world war that\nincludes the possible employment of nuclear weapons. Most pacifists\nwill reject nuclear war and full-fledged inter-state conflict. But\nthere are differences about whether, for example, civil war or\nhumanitarian intervention can be justified. For example, some who\ncould be described as pacifists supported the use of military force\nduring the American Civil War (William Lloyd Garrison, for example,\ncompromised his pacifist beliefs to support the cause of emancipating\nthe slaves). At issue in thinking about these differences are\nquestions about the importance of key values such as sovereignty and\nhuman rights, as well as the question of how best to create stability\nin the face of social unrest. One difficult issue for some pacifists\nis the question of using violence in defense of human rights or in\nopposition to tyranny. Maximal pacifists will reject all use of\nmilitary force, even in defense against dictators or in response to\nhuman rights violations.   \n\nMaximal versions of pacifism will condemn all taking of life. \nPacifists may also extend their rejection of violence to include a\nrejection of the death penalty, meat-eating, and abortion. More narrow\nversions of pacifism may take into account the distinction between the\ninnocent and the guilty, holding only that the innocent may not be\nharmed. This distinction is important for thinking about the question\nof noncombatant immunity in war, with many pacifists arguing that war\nis wrong because it puts the innocent at risk. Some opponents of the\ndeath penalty will make a similar argument about the death penalty and\nthe risk of executing the innocent. And opponents of abortion will also\nclaim that it harms the innocent. The connection between war, the\ndeath penalty, and abortion is made in the Catholic “seamless\ngarment” approach to the problem of developing a\n“consistent ethic of life.”  This approach condemns\nall actions that harm innocent persons; and it is often extended toward\na rejection of all harm, without regard for the distinction between\ninnocence and guilt. Such a view has been defended most famously by\nPope John Paul II, who rejected (or was skeptical toward) all sorts of\nviolence including war, the death penalty, suicide, euthanasia, and\nabortion. Pacifists may also extend moral concern to include concern\nfor all sentient beings; and thus pacifists may also condemn\nmeat-eating and animal cruelty. Gandhi, for example, extended\nahimsa maximally to include avoiding harm to sentient beings. \n\nThis distinction has to do with the issue of whether everyone is\nrequired to be a pacifist or whether pacifism can be a moral choice of\nsome particular individuals. This is related to the question of whether\npacifism is a duty for all or whether it supererogatory. While the\ndistinction between universal and particular pacifism is related to the\ndistinction between absolute and contingent pacifism, it is primarily\nfocused on the question of who is obligated by pacifism. \nUniversalism in thinking about pacifism will hold that if war is wrong,\nit is wrong for everyone and thus that soldiers who fight are wrong, as\nare those who support the war system that encourages them to fight.\nParticular pacifists articulate their position as merely personal and\ndo not condemn the war system or soldiers who choose to fight.\nUniversal pacifism is closely connected with absolute and maximal\nversions of pacifism; particular pacifism is related to contingent and\nminimal pacifisms. \n\nOne way that this distinction between universal and particular\npacifism has been enacted in history is through the idea of vocational\npacifism discussed above   Vocational pacifism holds that\npacifism is a special obligation of a particular vocational service;\nbut that it is not required of all. In this sense, pacifism is a\nsupererogatory obligation. Religious clerics may thus be required to\nrenounce violence, while ordinary members of their congregations may\nnot be so obliged. Particular pacifism is thus connected to contingent\npacifism: the moral demand of pacifism may be contingent upon\none’s social position. \n\nThis distinction can be understood by considering whether pacifism is\nmorally necessary or whether it is merely morally permitted. The\nuniversalist answer to this question is: if war and violence are\nwrong, then pacifism is morally necessary and those who fight are\nwrong. But some pacifist appear to hold that it is not wrong\nto fight (or that some persons are permitted to fight), even\nthough the pacifists herself may choose (or is obliged by some\nvocational commitment) not to fight. A conscientious objector may thus\nchoose not to fight while not condemning those who do. Conscientious\nrefusal may be articulated as a personal belief about pacifism that\ndoes not apply to others. This is one way pacifists who refuse to\nfight may avoid the charge that they are traitors who are opposed to\ntheir compatriots who fight: they may deny that their refusal has any\nuniversal moral significance or application.  Eric Reitan has argued\nthat one may adopt a sort of “personal pacifism” that need\nnot be universally applied.  One way of understanding this is to\nconnect it with the idea of tolerance. A personal pacifist may believe\nthat pacifism is the right choice; but she may choose to tolerate\nothers who do not make the same choice. A personal pacifist may also\nespouse a sort of relativism that holds that a commitment to pacifism\nis merely a personal commitment that cannot be used to condemn others\nwho make different commitments. \n\nThis idea of particular pacifism is a subtle one. And critics will\nargue that it is incoherent, especially if it is understood as a sort\nof relativism. Those who claim that conscientious objectors are\ntraitors may argue that pacifism cannot be a particular or personal\nchoice. Critics of pacifism will argue that pacifism is morally\nwrong because they think that patriotism or justice requires fighting\nor at least supporting the war effort. This objection would hold that\nif a war is justified, then conscientious objectors are wrong to reject\nit. Particularists may reply by claiming that their rejection of war\nis a personal choice without universal significance. \n\nArguments in defense of pacifism are usually based on assertions\nabout the immorality of violence and war. Thus pacifism is usually\nderived by negation. Pacifism, primarily, tells us what not to do. As\nCheyney Ryan has argued, pacifism is a “skeptical\nposition.”  As Ryan puts this: “its general claim is\nthat the proponent of killing cannot produce a single compelling\nargument for why killing another person is permissible” (Ryan\n1983, 509). One of the skeptical problems that Ryan addresses is the\nproblem that occurs in killing in self-defense. When a Victim kills an\nAggressor in self-defense, this killing occurs before the Aggressor has\nactualized his malicious intention. In this case, killing in\nself-defense is out of proportion to the harm done, since the Victim\nwho kills in self-defense was not himself killed. A skeptical version\nof pacifism can thus develop from the worry that when we choose to kill\nin self-defense, we never know whether this killing is in fact\njustifiable.   \n\nThis sort of skeptical position can be linked to the just war\ntradition’s concern with the question of “last\nresort” in thinking about jus ad bellum. Skeptical\npacifists wonder how we would know that we ever reach the stage of last\nresort, when violence becomes necessary. One way that pacifists\narticulate this concern is to focus on the variety of nonviolent\nmeasures that could be employed before it becomes necessary to resort\nto force. Indeed, it may be argued that to resort to violence is to\nadmit to a failure of imagination and to give up hope that more humane\nforms of problem solving and conflict resolution can be effective.\nMoreover, pacifists will note that it is not sufficient to try\nnonviolent methods once and then disregard them. Rather, one must\nengage in a variety of nonviolent actions; and one must try these\nnonviolent alternatives more than once. \n\nA somewhat different version of skeptical pacifism can be found in\ncritiques of militarism and the ideology and propaganda that lead\npeople to support war. This skeptical stance has been defended by the\nauthor of the present entry (Fiala 2008 and 2010). In this approach,\nskepticism produces a practical political pacifism that is based upon\nthe fact that citizens have no good reason to trust that their\ngovernments are telling them the truth about war and its\njustification. This skepticism is derived from historical judgments\nabout the tendency of governments to manipulate information in order\nto provoke the citizenry toward war. In light of such skepticism, the\nburden of proof for the justification of war is placed upon the\ngovernment, who must prove that the dangerous and presumptively\nimmoral activity of war can in fact be justified. \n\nThis sort of skepticism might also be called “prima facie\npacifism”: this is the idea that war is usually wrong except in\ncertain extraordinary circumstances when it is compellingly shown that\nthe evil of war is a sort of lesser evil that is necessary for some\ngreater good. Prima facie pacifism presumes that war is wrong but\nallows for exceptions. Prima facie pacifism places the burden of proof\nupon the proponent of war: it is up to the proponent of war to prove,\nin a given circumstance, that war is in fact morally\nnecessary.   \n\nTransformational pacifism is understood as aiming at a transformation\nof psychological, cultural, social, and moral sensibility away from\nacceptance of violence and war.  Transformational pacifism articulates\na broad framework of cultural criticism and includes an effort to\nreform educational and cultural practices that tend to support\nviolence and war.  The goal of transformational pacifism is a world in\nwhich war and violence appear to be archaic remnants of less civilized\npast. The author of the present entry has contributed to the idea of “transformative pacifism” as a critical theory of society that critiques militarism and the assumptions of warrior culture while offering a more peaceful ethical alternative (Fiala 2018). \n\nOne traditional version of transformational pacifism can be found in\npacifist religious traditions.  For example, Jesus articulated a\nrevaluation of values from the standpoint of a more pacific\nunderstanding of God’s commandments.  Instead of retaliation and the\nlogic of “an eye for eye,” Jesus claimed that we must evolve a new\nidea—of not returning evil for evil.  Transformational pacifism\nis often connected to a progressive interpretation of history that\npoints toward a pacifist goal for human evolution. Gandhi thought that\nsuch progress was already underway and that history “has been steadily\nprogressing towards ahimsa (nonviolence)” (Gandhi 1972, 310–11). \n\nTransformational pacifism has been described by Joseph\nJ. Fahey—who also calls it “reconstructionist” pacifism—as\nfollows: “transformational pacifists stress the spiritual unity of all\npeople… they seek not only the abolition of war, but also the\ncreation of an international juridical, political, and economic order\nthat will promote the rights of all species” (Fahey 1997, 393).  War\nresistance can be located under this general rubric—insofar as\nwar resistance is linked to a general criticism of those structures of\nauthority, economic and political choices, and institutional\nframeworks that support what is often called “the war system” (see\nAtack 2001). \n\nTransformational pacifism can also be linked to feminism and feminist\ncritiques of the masculine values found in warrior cultures and the\nwar system (see Poe 2017.  Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams is a prominent\nfigure here. Addams connected her pragmatic hope for peace to\ndemocracy and the empowerment of women and the oppressed masses, who\nhad in the past silently suffered from the horrors of war.  During\nWorld War I, Addams and her Women’s Peace Party worked to end the war\nand eventually ended up creating the Women’s International League for\nPeace and Freedom.  More recently authors such as Sara Ruddick and Nel\nNoddings have connected feminist criticism with pacifism and the\nethics of care.  Ruddick notes that military thinking utilizes a\nvariety of conceptual strategies that create a myth of “the manly just\nwarrior, which interlocks myths of masculinity, sacrifice, and heroic\ndeath” (Ruddick 1995, 202).  Noddings has noted that “care\nethics” does not support absolute pacifism, since care-givers may in\nrare circumstances kill in order to defend those they love.\nNonetheless, Noddings argues that care ethics and feminism are\nconcerned with a general critique of the militaristic and violent\nassumptions of male-dominant culture.  Noddings contends that our\nculture “puts a high value on the aggressive tendencies of males”\n(Noddings 2010, 215).  Her solution is to re-create culture and\neducation in such as way as to devalue aggression and provide support\nfor love, nurturance, solidarity, and care. \n\nDeontological prohibitions against war are usually absolute, while\nconsequentialist prohibitions against war are for the most part\ncontingent. \n\nConsequentialist pacifism is usually grounded in some sort of\nrule-utilitarianism. A utilitarian pacifist may argue that a rule\nagainst war or other sorts of violence will tend to promote the\ngreatest happiness for the greatest number. A broader prohibition\nagainst violence other than war can extend the “greatest\nhappiness” concept to take into account the happiness of sentient\nbeings other than humans. \n\nUtilitarian pacifists must appeal to empirical and historical data\nto support this rule. A utilitarian argument for pacifism could be\ngrounded in the claim that history shows us that wars tend to produce\nmore harm than good. As Bentham put it, “The happiest of\nmankind are sufferers by war; and the wisest, nay, even the least wise,\nare wise enough to ascribe the chief of their sufferings to that\ncause” (Bentham 1789, Fourth Essay)  One of the problems for\nconsequentialist arguments against war is that judgments vary about\nwhether war always causes more suffering than it\nprevents. Utilitarian defenders of the just war theory will argue\nthat some wars help alleviate suffering, as for example, in the case of\nhumanitarian wars in defense of human rights.  \n\nUtilitarian pacifists may articulate a rule-based argument that\nholds that a general rule against war will, in the long run, produce\nmore happiness. A utilitarian might support such an argument by\nalso arguing that economic and other resources that are spent on war\nand preparation for war could produce more happiness if spent on\npeaceful goods such as education, hunger relief, and so on. And a\nrule-utilitarian might argue that a rule against humanitarian\nintervention would produce more happiness in the long run by protecting\ninternational stability and preserving important values like national\nsovereignty. \n\nIt is important to note that, unlike deontological pacifism,\nconsequentialist pacifism is not opposed to killing per se. Nor is the\nconsequentialist approach especially concerned with the distinction\nbetween combatants and noncombatants, since the “greatest\nhappiness” principle adopts a perspective that includes both\ncombatants and noncombatants. Indeed, the combatant/noncombatant\ndistinction is better understood as a deontological principle, as\ndiscussed below. It is difficult to see how absolute pacifism can\ndevelop from act-utilitarianism that is devoid of side-constraints\nagainst killing. The rule-utilitarian approach can, however, allow for\ngeneral rules that allow killing in certain circumstances, say in\nself-defense. The idea of proportionality in just war theory is an\nexample of such a rule: killing in war is justifiable if it promotes\ngeneral long-term happiness. \n\nThe claim that war produces more harm than good is disputable; at\nleast, it requires empirical research to decide if it is\ntrue. Empirical research into the consequences of war provides mixed\nresults depending upon contexts and circumstances in which wars are\nfought and the range of consequences considered (whether short-term or\nlong-term). Some authors (Pinker and Goldstein) suggest that the use\nof judicious military power during the last several decades has\nproduced good results. But other authors reach different\nconclusions. Ian Bickerton concludes that the wars of the past 200\nyears have produced ambiguous results: “victory did not achieve its\ndesired results and war sacrifices were largely in vain. The reality\nis that the costs of war are rarely, if ever, worthwhile” (Bickerton\n2011, xi). Given the difficulty of assessing the empirical data,\nconsequentialist pacifism will usually be a sort of contingent\npacifism. But this is not always true, since absolute pacifism might\nbe justifiable on consequentialist grounds as a rule that will in the\nlong run produce good consequences. There may be variable judgments\namong consequentialists about whether some wars produce more harm than\ngood. Thus pacifists such as Einstein and Russell could agree that the\nFirst World War was wrong, while admitting that the Second World War\ncould be justified. The Second World War is in fact often used as an\nexample of a war that can be justified in consequentialist terms: the\ngood produced by the war—the defeat of Nazism in Europe, for\nexample—is thought to outweigh its negative consequences,\nespecially the massive numbers of persons killed in the war. In\nresponse, consequentialist pacifists might emphasize the negative\nutility of the deaths caused by the war while also arguing that the\nSecond World War produced long-term negative consequences with the\nintroduction of nuclear weapons, the partition of Europe, and the\nmadness of the Cold War. Consequentialist defenders of pacifism will\nalso argue that creative and coordinated nonviolent action can produce\ngood consequences that are at least as good as the consequences of\nwar. \n\nOne of the issues that consequentialists must consider is the\ntemporal and spatial scope of our concern for consequences. It is\npossible that wars may produce short-term benefits for some and\nlong-term disadvantages for others. Judgments about benefits and harms\nare thus complex and we must clarify our understanding of what matters\nin thinking about consequences. Often consequentialist arguments for\npacifism emphasize the short-term damage of war. It is obviously true\nthat wars kill people. But the further question to be asked from the\nstandpoint of consequentialism is whether the harms that occur in the\nnear-term are outweighed by the long-term benefits of the war. Just war\ntheorists believe that some wars do have positive long-term\nconsequences. Pacifists do not think that long-term benefits outweigh\nsuch near-term harms. Consequentialist pacifists often also\nconsider the broad and long-term negative effects of war on the\neconomy, on culture, on political life, and on the environment. \nMoreover, pacifists worry that war contributes to long-term\ninternational instability.  \n\nWhen thinking about the negative consequences of war it is important\nto recognize that we are engaged in comparative cost-benefit analysis.\nCritics of consequentialist pacifism often skew the results of such\ncost-benefit analysis by comparing war to passivity or inaction. But\nmost forms of pacifism do not advocate complete passivity. It is a\nmistake to compare the consequences of going to war to the consequences\nof doing nothing. Rather, the cost-benefit analysis must compare the\ncosts and benefits of going to war against those of creative,\norganized, and sustained nonviolent action.  \n\nA further consequentialist argument claims that cultures and states\nthat fight wars tend to become militaristic and expansionist. \nThis argument focuses on the long-term negative consequences of a\nsocial and political system that is committed to militarism. One of\nthese negative consequences is the rise of the so-called\n“military-industrial complex” in which social capital is\nexpended on military infrastructure at the expense of other social\nprojects. A negative consequence of militarism is the tendency of\nmilitarist states to become centralized, secretive, and imperial. This\ncritique of military expansionism can be connected to a general\ncritique of the potential negative consequences of imperial power. One\nsuch negative consequence is found in the illiberal tendencies of\nmilitary power. Another negative consequence can be found in the\npossibility of “blow-back” or retaliation in which those\nwho are subjugated turn against the colonial power. And other negative\nconsequences include the danger of an arms races and the wasted money\nand energy that are spent on preparing for war.   \n\nEmpirical research is required to say whether it is true that what\npacifists often call “the war system” does produce these\nnegative political consequences. Judgment about these empirical facts\nwill likely vary in accord with historical, geographical, and\npolitical differences, as well as in light of which consequences we\nchose to emphasize. Thus while pacifists argue that resources are\nsquandered in war and environmentalists will point out the military is\none of the largest polluters on the planet, proponents of war argue\nthat war and the military produces goods and technologies, such as\nairplanes, satellites, and so on, that are useful for civilians\n(Ruttan 2006). \n\nAnother consequentialist argument can be located in the idea of the\nsort of “just war pacifism” that developed during the late\n20th Century (see Sterba 1998 and Neu 2011). One significant worry of just war pacifism is that modern\nwars fought with weapons of mass destruction can never be justified.\nThere are deontological concerns behind this sort of\npacifism—with regard to concern for noncombatants. But there are\nalso consequentialist reasons to be skeptical of wars fought with\nweapons of mass destruction, most notably the problem of escalation.\nNuclear deterrent strategy relies upon the threat of escalation to\nkeep antagonists in check. The idea of deterrent strategy is to make\nthe negative consequences of war for the enemy so horrifying that war\nwill not occur. But if the threat of escalation is real and the\nresults of war are really so atrocious, then there are good\nconsequentialist reasons to be opposed to war: wars fought with\nweapons of mass destruction will tend to produce horrifying\nconsequences including the potentially total devastation of what was\ncalled during the Cold War, “mutually assured\ndestruction.” During the Cold War, this concern was located in\nthe worry about “nuclear winter,” which was the\ncatastrophic destruction of the earth’s climate and biosphere that\nwould occur if an all out nuclear war had erupted. Even more limited\nconflicts that occur among states that possess weapons of mass\ndestruction could produce horrible consequences. Nuclear proliferation\nremains a concern along with the general threat of terrorists in\npossession of weapons of mass destruction. \n\nJust war pacifists generally claim that the negative consequences of\nmodern war make war unjustifiable. Just war pacifism might be more\nnarrowly focused on the immorality of nuclear war and nuclear\ndeterrence strategy. But those who reject nuclear warfare might still\nallow that limited defensive or even humanitarian wars can be fought\nprovided we could be sure that just war principles were respected.\nPerhaps the most important conclusion of just war pacifism is that the\nburden of proof rests on the proponent of war: for just war pacifists\nwho base their conclusions on consequentialist reasoning, war is\npresumed to produce negative consequences until is proved\notherwise. \n\nRelated to these consequentialist arguments against war is a more\npositive consequentialist argument about the positive power of\nnonviolence as a social force. This is grounded in a consequentialist\nargument that active nonviolence can produce social goods like respect\nfor human rights as well as peace and reconciliation. \n\nThe basic theory and strategy of nonviolent action were worked out\nby Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Gene Sharp,\nand others who were engaged in nonviolent social protest in the\n20th Century. Although the roots of this approach can be\nfound in the long history of pacifism from Jesus onward, the\nGandhi-King approach both clarified the basic principles of nonviolent\nresistance and successfully put these principles into action in the\nIndian struggle for self-determination and in the American civil rights\nmovement. One of the important contributions of this approach is the idea that\nthere should be a coordination between means and ends. Peaceful means\nshould be employed in pursuit of the end of peace and\njustice.  \n\nFor peaceful means of social change to be effective, they must be\ncoordinated and organized. Gandhi and King thought that the\npower of nonviolence was linked to its ability to motivate and move\nlarge numbers of people. Pacifism as a personal stance will not be\neffective at creating social change: it requires a coordinated social\neffort. \n\nProponents of active nonviolence will claim that coordinated\nnonviolence can be successful even in the face of\naggression. Advocates of this position will point to the successes of\nGandhi and King. They will also point to the “velvet\nrevolutions” that occurred in Eastern Europe in the late 1980’s\nand early 1990’s. And they will point to the example of Lithuania in\n1990–91, when unarmed civilians succeeded in turning back Soviet\ntroops. Some initially viewed the so-called “Arab Spring” that began\nin late 2010 as an example of the power of nonviolence.  However,\nsubsequent oppression by military and police forces remind us of the\nfragility of nonviolent social movements. Proponents of nonviolent\naction argue that nonviolence could be even more effective if society\nfocused its resources on training citizens for nonviolent resistance\nand on coordinating nonviolent action. The ideal here would be a sort\nof nonviolent “army” that is funded, trained, and\ncoordinated for national self-defense in a way that mimics military\ntraining. For pacifism to be effective, the social\nresources—money, technology, and investment of labor and\ncreative power—that are currently used for military training\nwould have to be converted to nonviolent applications. This idea draws\non what James called “the moral equivalent of war” and\nwhat Gandhi called the “nonviolent army.” \n\nDeontological pacifism is closely related to absolute\npacifism. Deontological approaches to morality focus on duty and\nright. One typical idea for deontological pacifism is that there is a\nbasic law or principle that prohibits killing, such as “thou shall not\nkill.” \n\nThe most famous theory of deontological ethics is Kant’s.\nKant’s categorical imperative is formulated as follows:\n“Act according to that maxim by which you can at the same time\nwill that it should become a universal law” (Kant 1990,\n38). It is difficult to supply content to this imperative. Thus,\nit is not clear that the Kantian imperative can be used to rule out\nwar. Indeed, Kant is a defender of a version of the just war\ntheory, in part because he believes that states have a duty to defend\ntheir citizens. Although Kant is not himself a pacifist, one might be\nable to ground pacifism in Kant’s alternative version of the\nmoral law: “Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own\nperson or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means\nonly” (Kant 1990, 46). Some pacifists use the second\nformulation of the categorical imperative to support their position by\nclaiming that war treats persons as means and does not respect them as\nends in themselves. One version of this idea has been defended by\nSoran Reader, who argues that the basic presumption of the “moral\nstatus of persons” leads to pacifism. Although Reader argues that\none can arrive at this perspective from both a consequentialist\napproach and a Kantian one, she relies on the basic intuition that\nrespect for persons as ends in themselves requires us not to kill them.\nIt is possible to use this deontological principle to support a maximal\nextension of pacifism such that the prohibition against killing might\nbe extended to include a prohibition against killing non-human persons.\nThis interpretation would obviously require a further analysis of the\nnotion of personhood. Another version of deontological pacifism has been defended by Robert Holmes who claims that morality, properly speaking, focuses on individuals, while war focuses on defending collectives, which are not the proper focal point of morality (Holmes 2017b).  \n\nIn addition to killing human persons, war violates the moral status\nof persons when, for example, soldiers are viewed as interchangeable\ncogs in the war machine. One might then criticize the apparent\n“herd mentality” of militarism, as Albert Einstein did when\nhe called the militaristic patriotism of the masses a sort of\n“loathsome nonsense” (Einstein 1954, 8)  The idea of\nconscription seems to run counter to the idea of respect for persons.\nAnd pacifists may argue that it is somehow disrespectful to require\nsoldiers to conform to military virtues such as obedience to\nauthority. Arguments against militarism along these lines were\nmade famous by Thoreau who claimed that in military service “the\nmass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as machines,\nwith their bodies” (Thoreau 2000, 669) \n\nThe more important critique of the way that war betrays human\ndignity can be found in the pacifist critique of the killing that\nhappens in war. Pacifists might claim that war is a violation of human\nrights. More concretely the pacifist may claim that all human beings\nhave a right to life and that killing in war violates this right. \n\nThis idea has been rejected by Anscombe, Narveson, and others who\nargue that the idea of human dignity or human rights can necessitate\nthe use of violence in defense of these rights. This sort of objection\nholds that it is both inconsistent and immoral for pacifists to reject\nthe use of violence in defense of human rights. As David Luban puts\nthis: “Such rights are worth fighting for. They are worth\nfighting for not only by those to whom they are denied but, if we take\nseriously the obligation which is indicated when we speak of human\nrights, by the rest of us as well” (Luban 1980, 170). \n\nOne of the ways that pacifists can reply to this objection is to emphasize\nthe difference between personal nonviolence and war. Pacifists may\naccept that personal self-defense is acceptable; and they may accept\nthe idea of using violence in defense of the innocent in concrete\npersonal encounters. (Of course, absolute pacifists who\nemphasized complete nonresistance will not accept such violence at\nall). But pacifism as anti-warism will argue that the violence of war\nis of a different kind. War is dehumanizing violence that kills masses\nof persons without any concern for them as persons. Along these\nlines, Thomas Nagel claims that we should be able to justify to the\nvictim what is being done to them, in light of morally relevant facts\nabout them. At the level of personal violence, it is possible to say\nthat an aggressor deserves the violence that is inflicted upon him. But\nat the level of war, this personal element is lost and instead we have\nkilling en masse, which is an assault on human dignity. \n\nOne aspect of the deontological condemnation of war focuses on the\nkilling of combatants, although the killing of combatants has also been connected to contingent pacifism by way of just war theory’s proportionality constraint (Bazargan 2014). A pacifist might argue that it is wrong to kill\nenemy combatants because killing is always wrong. Such an argument runs\ncounter to the just war ideal that combatants can be killed. Critics\nwill argue that pacifism thus fails to distinguish between\n“innocence” and “guilt.” As Anscombe puts\nthis, “pacifism teaches people to make no distinction between the\nshedding of innocent blood and the shedding of any human blood”\n(Anscombe 1981a, 58) The just war tradition holds that it is\npermissible to kill enemy combatants because these combatants are, in\nsome sense, no longer innocent. Those who claim that it is acceptable\nto kill enemy combatants claim that enemy soldiers deserve to die; or\nat least that it is not wrong to kill them. There are open questions in\njust war theory about how this notion of desert functions. One of the\nproblems is that young conscripted soldiers may not fully support the\nwar into which they are drafted; and thus it may seem odd to claim that\nsuch soldiers are guilty for or deserve to be killed in a war for which\nthey hold no personal responsibility (see McMahan 2009). But the most obvious way to\njustify killing combatants is to link such killing to the notion of\nself-defense. In war, soldiers are confronted with enemy combatants who\nwill kill them and their comrades, if they aren’t killed first.\nIn the language of just war theory, an enemy combatant is guilty of the\ncrime of aggression; and in the context of war, this crime is\npunishable by death. \n\nThis notion of killing as punishment can easily be connected to the\nissue of the death penalty. For deontological proponents of the death\npenalty, murderers can be executed because the nature of their crime\nmerits death. While consequentialists add in other considerations such\nas the deterrent value of the death penalty, the deontological approach\nfocuses on the moral desert that is connected to the guilt of the\nmurderer. This notion of guilt—as a moral quality that adheres to\nan individual in light of his past actions—is also found in the\nidea that enemy combatants may be killed. Those individuals who are\nengaged in fighting have done something (or have adopted some\ncharacteristic) that makes it permissible to kill them. \n\nAbsolute and maximal versions of deontological pacifism maintain that\nkilling is never permitted, even the killing of enemy\nsoldiers. They may also claim that the death penalty is wrong; and\nthey may deny that killing in self-defense is ever justifiable.\nOpponents of war may also deny that international aggression is\npunishable by death.  \n\nA more subtle argument along these lines will claim that it is wrong\nto kill enemy combatants because enemy combatants are occasionally (or\nusually—depending on the strength of this particular claim) not\nresponsible for their participation in war. This is especially true of\nconscript armies who are forced to fight. A pacifist might want to make\nan exception for killing soldiers who have malicious intent; but they\nmay argue that it is immoral to kill soldiers who are forced to\nfight. \n\nAlthough some maximal versions of deontological pacifism will claim\nthat it is wrong even to kill combatants in war, other versions will\nargue that war is wrong primarily because of the risk to\nnoncombatants.  A cherished principle of the just war tradition is the\nidea of noncombatant immunity. This idea holds that those not actually\nengaged in the fighting should not be put at risk and should not be\ndeliberately targeted. This idea is often connected to the idea that\nthe innocent should not be killed. Noncombatants are presumed to be\ninnocent and thus immune from being killed. There is an open question\nas to whether all noncombatants are really innocent.  But the just war\ntradition stipulates that noncombatants should be immune from\nintentional harm.  A version of pacifism can thus be derived from this\nprinciple of the just war tradition by arguing against wars that do in\nfact end up killing innocent noncombatants. Just war pacifists will\nargue that this is especially true given the nature of modern warfare,\nwhich includes the use of mechanized weapons, aerial bombardment, and\nweapons of mass destruction. Such weaponry does not adequately\ndiscriminate between combatants and noncombatants. Thus modern war\ncannot be just, according to the pacifist interpretation of the just\nwar tradition. \n\nThe just war tradition, however, allows that innocent noncombatants\nmay be killed according to the principle of double effect. This idea\nis derived in the Christian tradition from Aquinas, who holds that a\nsingle act may have two effects. Aquinas uses an example of killing in\nself-defense: the act has one effect of saving a life but another\neffect of killing the aggressor.  Killing an aggressor in self-defense\nmay be permitted, if the death of the aggressor is not the primary\nintention of the defensive act.  It is significant that Aquinas does\nnot expand this discussion to make it permissible to kill an innocent\nthird party. But the just war tradition has employed this idea in a\nway that makes it permissible to kill innocent third parties (i.e.,\nnoncombatants) in war, so long as the primary intention is to\naccomplish a legitimate war aim and so long as the killing of\ninnocents is merely a foreseen but unintended secondary\neffect. Absolute pacifists will argue against this employment of the\ndoctrine of double effect and will claim that the killing of the\ninnocent in war is always wrong, even if it is an unintended\neffect. \n\nIndeed, some pacifists may also claim that since we know that war\nwill kill noncombatants, it is disingenuous to claim that the deaths of\ninnocent noncombatants are not intended. The pacifist may claim that\nthe real problem of war is that noncombatants are killed intentionally\nas a means of warfare. Although Anscombe argued against pacifism,\nshe made a similar argument in her criticism of the attacks on\nHiroshima and Nagasaki, “it is nonsense to pretend that you do\nnot intend to do what is the means you take to your chosen end”\n(1981a). Anscombe thought that war could be justified—if it\ndid not directly intend to kill noncombatants. And Anscombe\nthought that pacifists were wrong to ignore the distinction between\nshedding innocent blood and shedding blood in just warfare. But\npacifist might argue in response that war is wrong because innocent\nnoncombatants are killed—whether intentionally or not.  \n\nPacifism that is absolutist and deontological is often grounded in\nreligious belief. Christian philosopher Stanley Hauerwas has claimed\nthat pacifism is a theological position because it is as much about\neschatological faith as it is about ethics and politics (Hauerwas\n2006). A variety of religions have supported pacifist positions. Hindus,\nJains, and Buddhists share a concern for ahimsa or nonviolence\nas a basic moral virtue. Likewise, Christians also find a commitment to\nnonviolence at the heart of their tradition. One reason that absolutist\nand deontological pacifism appears to require a religious foundation is\nthat the commitment to peace can lead to suffering in the\n‘real’ world of political life. But for some religious\nbelievers the world of political life is only an apparent world and not\nthe real world at all. In the Buddhist tradition, the world of\ndependent arising is a world of appearances in which suffering is\nubiquitous. One of the ways to overcome this suffering is to see\nthrough the veil of maya and the illusions of this world. Ahimsa or\nnonviolence is a virtue that renounces the ubiquitous violence of the\n‘real’ world. In a different way, the Christian tradition\nholds that the ‘city of God’ or divine providence is a\nmysterious reality that is infinitely more important than the reality\nof the ‘city of Man.’  \n\nThe structure of this sort of religious belief is closely related to\nthe absolute, deontological, and transformational nature of religious\npacifism. In Christian pacifism, it is God’s commandments as\narticulated by Jesus that necessitate a commitment to pacifism.  Of\ncourse, this is a contentious point; and some deny that Christianity\nrequires pacifism (see Fiala 2007). But Christian pacifists maintain\nthat Christians should refuse to kill regardless of the consequences\nin the ‘real’ world. Related to this is the faith that God\nwill provide both the strength to endure suffering and a final reward\nfor those who remain committed to principles of nonviolence. Even\nthough pacifism may seem imprudent or even idiotic from the standpoint\nof consequentialism or political realism, these consequences have no\nlasting significance from the standpoint of Providence. Indeed,\nreligious pacifists are not averse to the pain that they might suffer\nas a result of their refusal to take part in violence because they\nbelieve that this suffering will be redeemed in the larger structure\nof divine justice.  \n\n\nA further variety of religious pacifism is closely connected with\nthe ideas of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics emphasizes the cultivation of\nvirtues over the course of a lifetime. Virtue ethicists are reluctant\nto judge actions in isolation from the total context of an\nindividual’s life. Religious pacifism has a virtue ethics\ncomponent when the commitment to peace is conceived as a lifelong\nproject of personal transformation. In the Christian tradition this is\nunderstood as a project in which human beings learn to imitate Jesus in\norder to become closer to God. The Christian model of virtue is Jesus,\nand Jesus’ practice of nonviolence culminated in his crucifixion.\nChristian martyrs have looked to this paradigm for millennia.   \nHowever, it is important to note that virtue ethics need not be reduced to a merely religious idea: there are important non-religious articulations of virtue ethics.  And there are authors who defend versions of pacifism based upon claims grounded in humanistic virtue ethics.  David K. Chan has argued, for example, that while virtuous individuals would generally be averse to killing, they would not be absolute pacifists (Chan 2017 and 2012).  A different argument for pacifism, based in virtue ethics, has been made by Trivigno (2013), who argues that training soldiers to kill turns them into bad persons. \n\nA similar idea about the practical impact of violence or nonviolence is found in the\nIndian traditions. Gandhi’s practice of self-renunciation\n(brahmacharya) including his vow of poverty and his fasts were\nclosely tied to his commitment to ahimsa. For Gandhi,\nnonviolence is part of a total practice of virtue. In the Buddhist\ntradition this is developed for example, in Thich Nhat Hanh’s (1987)\nidea of “being peace.”  The virtue approach emphasizes\nthat pacifism is a lifelong project that requires discipline and\npractice. This is true because we are not born virtuous. Rather, we\nlearn to cultivate the virtue of peacefulness by gradually learning\nhabits that help us control and resist anger, hatred, pride,\ncompetitiveness and the other emotions that lead to violence. In the\nChristian tradition this is linked to the idea of original sin: we are\nborn in violence and have to learn to overcome violence. Theological\nquestions arise in Christianity about whether human beings can overcome\nviolence by themselves or whether grace is needed in order to cultivate\nthe virtue of peace.  \n\nIt is possible to develop a version of virtue-pacifism from a\nnon-religious standpoint. In the ancient world, some versions of\nStoicism and Epicureanism come close to this. Stoics, for example,\nemphasize the virtue of tranquility or undisturbedness. One\nattains this state by learning proper discipline and by cultivating the\nother virtues that are essential for reigning in hubris. Hubris\nis wanton violence or pride run amok. Since Plato, the Greek tradition\nhas claimed that justice, courage, moderation, and wisdom were needed\nto overcome hubris. It is conceivable that these virtues would conjoin\nin a sort of peacefulness. Indeed, one can see the roots of nonviolent\nsocial protest in Socrates’ nonresistance to the Athenian state.\nIt should be noted, however, that although Socrates refused to carry\nout unjust orders, he did serve the state in battle.  \n\nA non-religious version of virtue-pacifism can be found in the ideas\nof 20th Century humanists such as William James. At the\nbeginning of the 20th Century, James acknowledged that war\nand military service did produce certain virtues, such as courage and\ndiscipline. But James hoped that there could be a non-military way of\nproducing these virtues. This was the basic idea behind his proposal\nfor a “moral equivalent to war,” which was an attempt to\nfind a way to produce virtues without connecting them to\nmilitarism (James 1910). \n\nThe general rejection of war has a long history that parallels the\njust war tradition and its idea that wars should be fought for the sake\nof peace and justice. In the West, pacifism and the just war tradition\nhave roots in both Christian and non-Christian sources. For Christian\nthinkers, one of the primary problems is trying to reconcile the\npacific commandments of Jesus with the apparent moral necessity of\nusing war to defend the innocent. This problem is acute for Christians\nsince Jesus seems to advocate an ethic of nonviolence both in the\nSermon on the Mount and in his submission to violence, while Augustine\nand others use both Biblical sources (such as Paul’s letter to\nthe Romans) and natural law to argue in favor of the just war idea. In\nthe European tradition, pacifism is an ideal that develops alongside of\nand in contrast to the just war tradition, with adherents of pacifism\nincluding the Mennonites and Quakers, as well as Christian humanists\nsuch as Erasmus. \n\nThe problem of justifying war is also found in Greek thinkers, such\nas Plato, who argued in the Laws that war should only be waged\nfor the sake of peace and that “it is peace in which each of us\nshould spend most of his life and spend it best” (803d). \nAnd in the Crito, Socrates considers the problem of whether it\nis ever justified to return evil for evil. Socrates begins with the\nassumption that we must do no harm; and he and Crito agree at one point\nthat one “ought not retaliate or render evil for evil to anyone,\nwhatever evil we may have suffered from him” (49d). It\nseems that this idea is behind Socrates decision to remain in prison\nand allow himself to be executed. \n\nPacifism shows up in non-European traditions as well. Jains,\nBuddhists, and others in the Indian tradition share a commitment to\nahimsa or nonviolence as a cardinal virtue (see Howard 2017). The ideal in these\ntraditions is a sort of selflessness in which, through the dissolution\nof the self, a larger truth emerges. For Buddhists this is based upon\nthe idea of nonattachment: war, violence, anger, and hatred result from\nour attachment to material things. Ahimsa is also linked to the idea\nthat all sentient beings are interdependent. Thus nonviolence is\nextended toward a rejection of violence toward sentient beings in\ngeneral and a commitment to vegetarianism. Mohandas Gandhi is perhaps\nthe most famous adherent of ahimsa of the last century. Gandhi\nbased his commitment to nonviolence on a spiritual foundation that\nemphasized self-renunciation (brahmacharya) and the positive\naction of the force of love or force of truth that he called\nsatyagraha.  \nWhile Indian traditions are often cited as sources of pacifism, it is also important to note that pacifism and nonviolence can be found in Islamic traditions and in African religious and philosophical traditions.  Ramin Jahanbegloo (2017) argues, for example, that Islam (whose root is salaam, which means peace) includes a rich conversation about violence and peace.  In the South Asian context of the 20th Century, Muslims such as Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and\nKhan Abdul Ghaffar Khan joined Gandhi in affirming the power of nonviolence.  African thought includes the influence of Christianity and Islam; and Gandhi was also at work in South Africa, where we might also note the work of Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  While Tutu works in the Christian tradition, we also see an emphasis on nonviolence in indigenous African contexts.  Gail Presbey has traced out numerous examples of this, including the way that nonviolence is related to concepts such as ubuntu (Presbey 2017). \n\nIt is to note that the distinction between European and\nnon-European traditions breaks down in the 20th Century:\nGandhi was inspired by Thoreau and by Tolstoy; and Gandhi in turn\ninspired Western pacifists such as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell,\nand Martin Luther King Jr. Gandhi and King both claim that one of the\nmost important ideas underlying this sort of pacifism is love,\nespecially the disinterested brotherly love that is described in the\nGreek New Testament using the word agape. King explains it\nthis way: “In the final analysis, agape means recognition of the\nfact that all life is interrelated. All humanity is involved in a\nsingle process, and all men are brothers. To the degree that I harm my\nbrother, no matter what he is doing to me, to that extent I am harming\nmyself” (King 1986, 20)  This idea represents the extension\nof Christian pacifism in light of Gandhian principles.    Further discussions should more systematically consider how such ideas have spread to\nLatin America, East Asia, and the Muslim world, as well as the ways\nthat nonviolence shows up in the religious and philosophical\ntraditions of the rest of the world. Research projects in pacifism and\npeace studies should continue to explore ideas found in the variety of\nworld traditions including Taoism, African thought, and indigenous\nAmerican philosophies. \n\nHere we will summarize briefly several objections to pacifism and\npacifist replies to these objections. These objections and replies\nwill, of course, vary according to the different sorts of pacifism\nbeing attacked or defended. \n\nObjection: This objection holds that the reason\npacifists advocate nonviolence is that they are afraid of suffering\nfrom violence; or that they are too lazy or self-interested to take up\narms to fight. This objection focuses on the motivation and psychology\nof pacifists and accuses pacifists of the vice of cowardice. Moreover,\nsuch an objection may also argue that pacifists are egoists who are\ntoo selfish to do what is required to serve justice, protect the\ninnocent, and defend the nation. The free rider objection adds that\npacifists benefit from social goods that are produced through military\npower, while they contribute nothing substantial to the production of\nthese goods. This objection thus claims that pacifism is unjust since\npacifists share in social benefits, without also taking up the burdens\nand obligations that are tied to these benefits. Related to this is\nthe charge that pacifism is unpatriotic and even treasonous. The\nconcern here is that if pacifists are unwilling to fight to defend the\nnation, then they effectively betray the nation and help the enemy. As\nJan Narveson once put this, pacifists have “too many\nfriends” (Narveson 2003; also Narveson 2017) since they are unwilling to take up\narms against their enemies. A more forceful ad hominem argument\nagainst pacifism can be found in Ward Churchill’s idea that pacifism\nis a pathology of the privileged, a point that has been reiterated by\nDerek Jensen. This objection holds that it is easy for those who are\nnot oppressed to advocate nonviolence and indeed, that the powerful\ncan use the ideology of pacifism as a tool with which to further\noppress those who are unwilling to take up arms in defense of human\nrights. This idea can be traced back to ideas found in Marcuse, who\nargued that the weaker parties in social conflict are forced by the\nstronger party to employ nonviolence and thus that resort to\nnonviolence is both ineffective and an admission of weakness. \n\nReply: One way that a pacifist might reply to this\nobjection is to argue that pacifism results from noble motives and not\nvicious ones. To support this reply, pacifists might show examples of\nthe virtuous individuals who have advocated pacifism, while also\nemphasizing the ethical basis on which pacifism is grounded.  Indeed,\npacifists can avoid the cowardice objection by stressing that\npacifists are willing to suffer violence even though they refuse to\nparticipate in it. With regard to the free rider problem, a principled\npacifist can argue that her moral principles require that she be a\npacifist and that these principles also require that she work to\ntransform society. Moreover, pacifists can engage in productive social\nendeavors that do not necessitate the use of violence or war. This\nsort of compromise occurs when military states find ways to employ the\ntalents of conscientious objectors. Pacifists who refuse to fight can\nvolunteer their talents and energies in nonviolent activities that\nsupport the common good. With regard to the accusation of treason, a\npacifist might claim that there are higher goods than the\nstate. Indeed some pacifists—such as Tolstoy or\nHauerwas—are also anarchists who claim that Christian faith\nrequires that one overcome one’s attachment to the state as well as\none’s hatred of enemies. A similar argument can be made against\nChurchill’s “pacifism as pathology” objection, with\nprincipled pacifists claiming that nonviolence is a moral requirement\nthat transcends class and national ideology. Finally, a\nconsequentialist pacifist can reply that she is concerned with the\nlong-term interests of the community and not with the short-term\nquestion of winning a war or staging a revolution. While violence may\ncreate short term benefits, the long term project of creating a stable\npeace will require nonviolent means and projects focused on\nreconciliation and restorative justice. Contra the\nChurchill/Jensen objection, pacifists will emphasize the moral and\npolitical importance of unifying means and end. And, as José-Antonio Orosco has argued, nonviolent activism can be an effective means of countering oppression (Orosco 2017). \n\nObjection: The clean hands objection holds that\npacifists are so committed to keeping their hands clean that they fail\nto act on other requirements of life. The clean hands objection holds\nthat pacifists are disconnected from the world of concrete human\nreality. As Anscombe puts this in her critique of pacifism, the\npacifist holds “withdrawal from the world as man’s only\nsalvation” (Anscombe 1981a, 52). This is tied to a\ntheological objection that holds that pacifists incorrectly believe\nthat they can overcome the limits of human nature. A version of this\nobjection that is often directed against Christian pacifism holds that\nwar will remain necessary because of the fallen and sinful nature of\nhuman beings. This objection also reminds Christian pacifists that\nthere is explicit advocacy for war in the Old Testament and that\nPaul’s letter to the Romans allows the sovereign to use\nthe sword to execute God’s wrath. The objection holds that since\nwe are not perfect, we must employ the imperfect means of war and\nviolence to attain moral ends. From this standpoint, defenders of the\nidea of a just war argue that love of the neighbor and the need for a\njust social order will occasionally necessitate just wars. \n\nReply: Pacifists might reply to this sort of\nobjection by delving deeper into the requirements of both religious\nfaith and ethics. This objection is tied to a much larger problem of\ncoordinating the demands of ordinary political life with the\nrequirements of morality and religion. Christian pacifists will reply\nto the “bad theology” objection by focusing on the message\nof Jesus in the Gospels; and they will argue, as John Howard Yoder\ndoes, that just war theory is a later development of a lapsed sort of\n“Constantinian” (or Augustinian) Christianity. Moreover,\nChristian pacifists will argue that pacifism is part of a religious\nworldview that looks beyond a materialistic defense of the finite goods\nof this world. For religiously oriented pacifists in many traditions, a\ncommitment to nonviolence is tied to the attempt to see through the\nvanity of temporal things. Nonreligious pacifists will reply to this\nobjection by clarifying the importance of clean hands in morality.\nAbsolutists will claim that we have an obligation to uphold the\nrequirements of morality and keep our hands as clean as possible. They\nwill also claim that the world would be a better place if everyone took\nthis obligation seriously and refused to compromise with evil. \n\nObjection: This objection claims that pacifism\nresults in a performative contradiction because an absolute pacifist\nwho is unwilling to defend himself simply ends up dead. A more subtle\nversion of this argument has been articulated by Jan Narveson\n(Narveson 1965) who argued that pacifism involves an internal\ncontradiction that is related to the idea of justice and human\nrights. Pacifists are unwilling to use violence to defend against\naggression because they respect life or respect persons. But a\ncontradiction occurs when the pacifist who claims that life is an\nabsolute good is unwilling to take the necessary steps to defend lives\nthat are threatened by aggression.  This objection shares something\nwith those defenders of the just war idea who, like George Weigel, are\ninspired by the Augustinian ideal of using war to defend a tranquil\nand just social order. The objection holds that it is immoral to avoid\nwar, when war could be used to defend the innocent, protect\nsovereignty, and uphold a just international order. This objection can\nbe applied both to defensive wars, in which the state has an\nobligation to protect its own citizens, and to wars of humanitarian\nintervention, in which military power is used to defend the human\nrights and to establish domestic tranquility and social order in\npursuit of peace. Related to this is the claim that nonviolent means\nof producing social change are ineffective.  Critics will claim, for\nexample, that although there appear to be cases of successful\nnonviolent action in India or in the American civil rights movements,\nthese movements were successful because of unique set of historical\ncircumstances. Critics will argue that Gandhi’s success was made\npossible by British exhaustion from the World Wars; and they will\nargue that the success of Martin Luther King Jr. was made possible by the\nthreat of violence from radicals such as the Black Panthers. Moreover,\ncritics will argue that Gandhi and King were successful because their\nopponents were for the most part sympathetic to their cause from the\nbeginning. But such critics will argue that non-violence will simply\nnot work against Nazis or terrorists; and that those who think so are\ndangerously deluded.  President Barack Obama articulated this sort of\nobjection to pacifism in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech (Obama 2009).\nObama expressed respect for pacifists such as Gandhi and King.  He\nsaid, “there is nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing naive in\nthe creed and lives of Gandhi and King.” But he claimed that a\nhead of state cannot be guided by pacifism.  And he concluded:\n“A nonviolent movement could not have halted Hitler’s armies.\nNegotiations cannot convince al-Qaeda’s leaders to lay down their\narms.” A similar argument about the efficacy of violence has\nbeen made by defenders of insurrectionary violence such as Marcuse,\nFanon, and Sartre. \n\nReply: One way that a pacifist may reply to this\nobjection is to focus on pacifism as a skeptical political stance\nabout war. Some political pacifists do allow for personal self-defense\nand defense of loved-ones while remaining skeptical of war as a social\nmovement. Another way that a pacifist may reply is to focus on\nconsequences and argue that war produces more negative consequences\nthan nonviolence.  Against Narveson, the pacifist might argue that\npacifism is no more contradictory than the idea that we might kill in\norder to defend life. Deontological pacifists will also reply that\nwhile they do value a just and tranquil social order, and may even be\nwilling to die in defense of such as just order, their basic\nprinciples prohibit them from killing in its defense. A pacifist might\nfurther reply to this objection by arguing that the idea that war can\nbe used to defend the innocent is also imprudent and unwise. Pacifists\nwill argue that nonviolent means of defending the just political order\nare the best means to be employed in practice because they remain\nconsistent with the ideals of justice and order that are to be\ndefended. This claim about the unity of means and ends can be used to\nargue against the Fanon/Marcuse justification of violence in\ninsurrection by noting a contradiction in revolutionaries using\nviolence to oppose the violence of oppressive states. A pacifist might\nadd that history shows that violent revolution often either escalates\nor provokes more oppression. With regard to humanitarian intervention,\nsome deontological pacifists will worry that interventions by\noutsiders will run counter to the national right to\nself-determination. And more prudentially minded pacifists will worry\nthat humanitarian intervention will produce resistance and an\nescalation of violence that will undermine the long-term goals of\npolitical stabilization, justice, and reconciliation. Finally, the\npacifist might also appeal to the tragic element in human life: that\nwe often have to make tragic choices in which there is no genuinely\ngood alternative. When confronted with such tragic conflicts, the\npacifist will argue that we should err on the side of peace and take\ncare that we do no harm. The examples of King and Gandhi may in fact\nrequire careful historical analysis; and different historical\ncircumstances will require different sorts of nonviolent action. But,\nfor the pacifist, history shows us the horror of war; and the success\nof Gandhi and King reminds us that there is an alternative.  Finally,\na pacifist might also point out that the long term goal of a\ntransformation beyond war is shared by a variety of people, including\nthose who are reluctant to call themselves pacifists.  As Obama\npointed out in his Nobel Peace Prize speech, even if war may be\nnecessary, it is also “at some level an expression of human\nfolly.” Pacifists usually deny that war is necessary.  But they\nagree that war is usually an expression of human folly.","contact.mail":"afiala@csufresno.edu","contact.domain":"csufresno.edu"}]
