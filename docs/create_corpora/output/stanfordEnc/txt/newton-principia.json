The reasons for this, however,\nand consequently the focus of the attention have changed significantly\nfrom one century to the next. During the 20th Century\nphilosophers have viewed the Principia in the context of\nEinstein's new theory of gravity in his theory of general\nrelativity. The main issues have concerned the relation between\nNewton's and Einstein's theories of gravity and what the\nneed to replace the former with the latter says about the nature,\nscope, and limits of scientific knowledge. During most of the\n18th Century, by contrast, Newton's theory of gravity\nremained under dispute, especially because of the absence of a\nmechanism — in particular, a contact mechanism — producing\ngravitational forces. The philosophic literature correspondingly\nendeavored to clarify and to resolve, one way or the other, the dispute\nover whether the Principia should or should not be viewed as\nmethodologically well founded. By the 1790s Newton's theory\nof gravity had become established among those engaged in research in\norbital mechanics and physical geodesy, leading to the\nPrincipia becoming the exemplar of science at its\nmost successful. Philosophic interest in the Principia\nduring the 19th Century therefore came to focus on how\nNewton had achieved this success, in part to characterize the knowledge\nthat had been achieved and in part to pursue comparable knowledge in\nother areas of research. Unfortunately, a very large fraction of\nthe philosophic literature in all three centuries has suffered from a\nquite simplistic picture of the Principia itself. The\nmain goal of this entry is to replace that simplistic picture with one\nthat does more justice to the richness of both the content and the\nmethodology of the Principia.\n\n\n\nViewed retrospectively, no work was more seminal in the development\nof modern physics and astronomy than Newton's\nPrincipia. Its conclusion that the force retaining the\nplanets in their orbits is one in kind with terrestrial gravity ended\nforever the view dating back at least to Aristotle that the celestial\nrealm calls for one science and the sublunar realm, another. Just\nas the Preface to its first edition had proposed, the ultimate success\nof Newton's theory of gravity made the identification of the\nfundamental forces of nature and their characterization in laws the\nprimary pursuit of physics. The success of the theory led as well\nto a new conception of exact science under which every\nsystematic discrepancy between observation and theory, no matter how\nsmall, is taken as telling us something important about the\nworld. And, once it became clear that the theory of gravity\nprovided a far more effective means than observation for precisely\ncharacterizing complex orbital motions — just as Newton had proposed\nin the Principia in the case of the orbit of the Moon —\nphysical theory gained primacy over observation for purposes of\nanswering specific questions about the world. \n\n The retrospective view of the Principia has been\ndifferent in the aftermath of Einstein's special and general theories\nof relativity from what it was throughout the nineteenth century.\nNewtonian theory is now seen to hold only to high approximation in\nlimited circumstances in much the way that Galileo's and Huygens's\nresults for motion under uniform gravity came to be seen as holding\nonly to high approximation in the aftermath of Newtonian inverse-square\ngravity. In the middle of the nineteenth century, however, when\nthere was no reason to think that any confuting discrepancy between\nNewtonian theory and observation was ever going to emerge, the\nPrincipia was viewed as the exemplar of perfection in\nempirical science in much the way that Euclid's Elements had\nbeen viewed as the exemplar of perfection in mathematics at the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century. Because of the extent to\nwhich Einsteinian theory was grounded historically on Newtonian\nscience, the Principia has retained its unique seminal\nposition in the history of physics in our post-Newtonian era.\nPerhaps more strikingly, because of the logical relationship between\nNewtonian and Einsteinian theory — Einstein showed that Newtonian\ngravity holds as a limit-case of general relativity in just the way\nNewton showed (in Book 1, Section 10) that Galilean uniform gravity\nholds as a limit-case of inverse-square gravity — even though the\nPrincipia can no longer be regarded as an exemplar of\nperfection, it is still widely regarded by physicists as an exemplar of\nempirical science at its best. \n\nIn spite of extravagant claims made about the Principia by\nsome in the years after it first appeared — “… he seems to have\nexhausted his Argument, and left little to be done by those that shall\nsucceed\n him”[1]\n—\nthe most positive view of it that anyone could have substantiated\nduring the first half of the eighteenth century would have emphasized\nits promise more than its achievements. The theory of gravity had\ntoo many loose ends, the most glaring of which was a factor of 2\ndiscrepancy in the mean motion of the lunar apogee, a discrepancy that\nundercut the claim that the Moon is held in orbit by an inverse-square\nforce. No one knew these loose ends better than Newton himself,\nyet no one had a greater sense of the potential of the theory of\ngravity to resolve a whole host of questions in planetary astronomy —\nwhich may well explain why he made these loose ends difficult to see\nexcept by the most technically skilled, careful readers. Between\nthe late 1730s and the early 1750s the situation changed dramatically\nwhen several of the loose ends were tied up, in some cases yielding\nsuch extraordinary results as the first truly successful descriptive\naccount of the motion of the Moon in the history of astronomy.\nDuring the second half of the eighteenth century the promise of the\nPrincipia was not only universally recognized by those active\nin empirical research, but a large fraction of this promise was\nrealized. What we now call “Newtonian mechanics” emerged in this\nprocess, as did the gravity-based accounts of the often substantial\ndivergences of the planets from Keplerian motion, the achievement of\nNewton's theory of gravity that ultimately ended all opposition to\nit. \n\nDuring the eighteenth century the Principia was also seen as\nputting forward a world view directly in opposition to the broadly\nCartesian world view that in many circles had taken over from the\nScholastic world view during the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury. Newton clearly intended the work to be viewed in this\nway when in 1686 he changed its title to Philosophiae Naturalis\nPrincipia Mathematica, in allusion to Descartes's most prominent\nwork at the time, Principia Philosophiae. (The title\npage of Newton's first edition underscored this allusion by placing the\nfirst and third words of the title in larger type.) The main\ndifference in the world view in Newton's Principia was to rid\nthe celestial spaces of vortices carrying the planets. Newtonians\nsubsequently went beyond Newton in enhancing this world view in various\nways, including forces everywhere expressly acting at a distance.\nThe “clockwork universe” aspect of the Newtonian world view, for\nexample, is not to be found in the Principia; it was added by\nLaplace late in the eighteenth century, after the success of the theory\nof gravity in accounting for complex deviations from Keplerian motion\nbecame fully evident. \n\nIn addition to viewing the theory of gravity as potentially\ntransforming orbital astronomy, Newton saw the Principia as\nillustrating a new way of doing natural philosophy. One aspect of\nthis new way, announced in the Preface to the first edition, was the\nfocus on forces: \n\nA second aspect of the new method concerns the use of mathematical\ntheory not to derive testable conclusions from hypotheses, as Galileo\nand Huygens had done, but to cover a full range of alternative\ntheoretical possibilities, enabling the empirical world then to select\namong them. This new approach is spelled out most forcefully at the\nend of Book 1, Section 11: \n\n A third aspect of the new method, which proved most controversial at\nthe time, was the willingness to hold questions about the mechanism\nthrough which forces effect their changes in motion in abeyance, even\nwhen the mathematical theory of the species and proportions of the\nforces seemed to leave no alternative but action at a distance. This\naspect remained somewhat tacit in the first edition, but then, in\nresponse to criticisms it received, was made polemically explicit in\nthe General Scholium added at the end of the second edition: \n\nDuring most of the eighteenth century the primary challenge the\nPrincipia presented to philosophers revolved around what to\nmake of a mathematical theory of forces in the absence of a mechanism,\nother than action at a distance, through which these forces work.  By\nthe last decades of the century, however, little room remained for\nquestioning whether gravity does act according to the laws that Newton\nhad set forth and does suffice for all the motions of the heavenly\nbodies and of our sea. No one could deny that a science had emerged\nthat, at least in certain respects, so far exceeded anything that had\never gone before that it stood alone as the ultimate exemplar of\nscience generally. The challenge to philosophers then became one of\nspelling out first the precise nature and limits of the knowledge\nattained in this science and then how, methodologically, this\nextraordinary advance had been achieved, with a view to enabling other\nareas of inquiry to follow suit. \n\nThe view is commonplace that what Newton did was to put forward his\ntheory of gravity to explain Kepler's already established “laws” of\norbital motion; and the universality of the law of gravity then ended\nup explaining the deviations from Keplerian motion by attributing them\nto gravitational interaction of the planets. This is wrong on\nseveral counts, the most immediate of which is that Kepler's “laws”\nwere by no means established before the Principia. The\nrules for calculating orbital motion that Kepler put forward in the\nfirst two decades of the seventeenth century had indeed achieved a\nspectacular gain in accuracy over anything that had come before.\nKepler's rules, however, did not yield comparable accuracy for the\nmotion of the Moon, and even in the case of the planets the calculated\nlocations were sometimes off by as much as a fourth of the width of the\nMoon. More importantly, by 1680 several other approaches to\ncalculating the orbits had been put forward that achieved the same\nlevel of not quite adequate accuracy as Kepler's. In particular,\nNewton was familiar with seven different approaches to calculating\nplanetary orbits, all at roughly the same accuracy. Only two of\nthese, Kepler's and Jeremiah Horrocks's, used Kepler's area rule —\nplanets sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the Sun —\nto locate planets along their trajectories. Ismaël Boulliau\nand, following him, Thomas Streete (from whose Astronomia\nCarolina Newton first learned orbital astronomy) replaced the area\nrule with a geometric construction. Vincent Wing had adopted\nstill another geometric construction in the late 1660s after having\nearlier used a point of equal angular motion oscillating about the\nempty focus of the ellipse; and Nicolaus Mercator in 1676 added still a\nfurther geometric\n construction.[4]\nOf these six alternative approaches, only\nHorrocks and, following him, Streete, took Kepler's 3/2 power rule —\nthe periods of the planets vary as the square root of the cube of their\nmean distances from the Sun — seriously enough to use the periods\nrather than positional observations to determine their\nmean\n distances.[5] \n\nAll these approaches followed Kepler in using an ellipse to represent\nthe trajectory. (The primary historical reason for this was\nKepler's success in predicting the 1631 transit of Mercury across the\nSun.) This, however, does not mean that the ellipse was\nestablished as anything more than a mathematically tractable close\napproximation to the true orbit. In fact, the planetary orbits\nknown then are not all that elliptical. The minor axis of Mercury\nis only 2 percent shorter than the major axis, the minor axis of Mars,\nonly 0.4 percent shorter, and in all other cases the difference between\nan ellipse and an eccentric circle was beyond detection. Newton\nhad real grounds for claiming in a letter to Halley in June 1686 a\n“right” to the ellipse, remarking that “Kepler knew the Orb to be not\ncircular but oval, and guest it to be Elliptical” [C,\nII, 436]. Entirely independently, the most judicious reader of the\nfirst edition of the Principia, Christiaan Huygens, wrote the\nfollowing summary of the Principia‘s achievement in his\nnotebook upon reading the complimentary copy Newton had sent him: \n\nSo, all three of Kepler's rules that came to be called “laws” after\nthe Principia were known to be nothing more than holding to\nhigh approximation when Newton started on the project in 1684.\nAnd the leading issue in orbital astronomy at the time was not why\nKepler's rules hold, but rather which, if any, of the comparably\naccurate different approaches to calculating orbits was to be\npreferred. \n\nThe distinct possibility of the ellipse being only an approximation to\nthe true trajectory explains the appropriateness of the question Hooke\nput to Newton in 1679 and Halley put to him again in 1684 — what\ntrajectory does a body describe when moving under an inverse-square\nforce directed toward a central body? The inverse-square part of\nthis question came from combining the mathematical theory of uniform\ncircular motion, which Huygens had published in his Horologium\nOscillatorium of 1673, with Kepler's 3/2 power rule: the force in\na string retaining a body in a uniform circular orbit varies directly\nas the radius of the circle and inversely as the square of the period;\nbut the squares of the periods of the planets vary as the cubes of\ntheir mean distances; and hence, at least to a first approximation, the\nforces retaining the planets in their orbits vary inversely with the\nsquare of the radii of their nearly circular orbits. But now\nallow the distance of the orbiting body from the center to vary rather\nthan remaining constant, as in a circle. What trajectory would\nresult if the force toward the center varies as the inverse-square of\nthe distance from the center toward which the force is always\ndirected? The answer in the nine page tract “De Motu Corporum in\nGyrum” that Newton sent to Halley in November 1684 is, an ellipse,\nprovided the velocity is not too high (and if it is, then instead a\nparabola or a hyperbola, depending on the velocity). The key step\nin developing this answer is a generalization of uniform circular\nmotion to the case of motion under a “centripetal” force — a term\nNewton coined from Huygens's “centrifugal” force, by which he meant the\ntension in the string keeping the body in a circle; and a key to this\nstep was the discovery that a body moving under any form of centripetal\nforce always sweeps out equal areas in equal times with respect to that\ncenter, so that the appropriate geometrical representation of time for\ngeneralizing uniform circular motion is area swept out rather than\nangle or arc length. The tract also confirms that Kepler's 3/2\npower rule continues to hold for bodies orbiting in confocal ellipses\ngoverned by inverse-square centripetal forces. \n\nThese were remarkable steps forward at the time, but they and the\nquestions behind them form only an initial part of the context in which\nNewton went on to write the Principia. Shortly after the\n“De Motu” tract went off to London, Newton revised the tract and added\ntwo further passages. The question precipitating this revision\nappears to have been about the effect the inverse-square centripetal\nforces directed toward Jupiter, as implied by its satellites, have on\nthe Sun. Newton first added two principles that he first called\n“hypotheses” and then changed to “laws”: \n\n Law 3: The relative motions of\nbodies enclosed in a given space are the same whether that space is at\nrest or moves perpetually and uniformly in a straight line without\ncircular motion. \n\n Law 4: The common center of\ngravity does not alter its state of motion or rest through the mutual\nactions of bodies. [U, 267] \n\nThe second of the two added passages concerns motion in resisting\nmedia; it provides a context in which to read Book 2 of the\nPrincipia. \n\nThe first added passage, which has become known as the “Copernican\nscholium,” we here quote in full because it, better than anything else,\nexplains what led Newton into the further research that turned the\nnine-page tract into the five hundred page Principia. It\noccurs as a single long paragraph, but is here broken into three\nsegments in order to facilitate commenting on it: \n\n \nMoreover, the whole space of the\nplanetary heavens is either at rest (as is commonly believed) or\nuniformly moved in a straight line, and similarly the common\ncentre of gravity of the planets (by Law 4) is either at rest or is\nmoved at the same time. In either case the motions of the planets\namong themselves (by Law 3) take place in the same manner and\ntheir common centre of gravity is at rest with respect to the\nwhole space, and so it ought to be considered the immobile\ncenter of the whole planetary system. Thence indeed the\nCopernican system is proved a priori. For if a common\ncentre of gravity is computed for any position of the planets, this\neither lies in the body of the Sun or will always be very near\nit. \n \nBy reason of this deviation of the Sun\nfrom the center of gravity the centripetal force does not always tend\nto that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in\nellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit. Each time a planet\nrevolves it traces a fresh orbit, as happens also with the motion of\nthe Moon, and each orbit depends upon the combined motions of all the\nplanets, not to mention their actions upon each other. Unless I\nam much mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to\nconsider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to define\nthe motions by exact laws which would allow of an easy\ncalculation. \n \nLeaving aside these fine points, the simple\norbit that is the mean between all vagaries will be the ellipse that I\nhave discussed already. If any one shall attempt to\ndetermine this ellipse by trigonometrical computation from three\nobservations (as is usual) he will be proceeding without due\ncaution. For these observations will share in the very small\nirregular motions here neglected and so cause the ellipse to deviate\nsomewhat from its actual magnitude and position (which ought to be the\nmean among all errors), and so there will be as many ellipses differing\nfrom each other as there are trios of observations employed. Very\nmany observations must therefore be joined together and assigned to a\nsingle operation which mutually moderate each other and display the\nmean ellipse both as regards position and magnitude.\n[U, 280] \n\nThe first segment highlights a further component of the historical\ncontext in which the Principia was written and read.\nGalileo's discovery of the phases of Venus in 1613 had provided\ndecisive evidence against the Ptolemaic\n system,[6]\nbut it could not provide grounds\nfavoring the Copernican over the Tychonic system. In the latter,\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn circumnavigate the Sun, and\nthe Sun circumnavigates the Earth, with the consequence that these\nseven bodies are at all times in the same position in relation to one\nanother as they are in the Copernican system. Whether any\ndecisive empirical grounds could be found favoring the Copernican over\nthe Tychonic system became one of the most celebrated issues of the\nseventeenth century. Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes all published\nmajor books in the first half of the century purporting to resolve\nthis\n issue,[7]\nKepler and\nDescartes basing their arguments on the physical mechanism each had\nproposed as governing the orbital motion. Nevertheless, the\nleading observational astronomer of the second half of the century, G.\nD. Cassini, was a Tychonist. In the first segment of the\n“Copernican Scholium” Newton identifies the center of gravity of the\nplanetary system as the appropriate point to which all the motion\nshould be referred — the technical issue behind the issue over the two\nsystems — and then announces that the centripetal forces identified in\nthe text of “De Motu” as governing the orbital motion open the way to\nestablishing a slightly qualified form of the Copernican\n system.[8]\nNewton's\ndiscovery of this line of reasoning was surely a major factor urging\nhim on to the Principia. \n\nThe second segment of the “Copernican Scholium” addresses an issue in\norbital astronomy that forms a still further component in the\nhistorical context of the Principia. Separate from the\nquestion whether Kepler's or some other approach was to be preferred\nwas the question whether the true motions are significantly more\nirregular and complicated than the calculated motions in any of these\napproaches. The complexity of the lunar orbit and the continuing\nfailure to describe it within the accuracy Kepler had achieved for the\nplanets was one consideration lying behind this question. Another\ncame from Kepler's own finding, noted in the Preface to his\n Rudolphine Tables[9]\nand subsequently supported by others, that the\ntrue motions may involve further vagaries, as evidenced by apparent\nchanges in the values of orbital elements over time. The most\nimportant consideration behind this question, however, came from\nDescartes' claim that, in keeping with the changing motions of his\nvortices over long periods of time, the orbits are not mathematically\nperfect and “they are continuously changed by the passing of the ages”\n[D, 3, 34]. In the second segment of the quoted\nScholium, Newton concludes that, in contrast to the ellipse that\nanswered the mathematical question put to him by Hooke and Halley, the\ntrue orbits are not ellipses, but are indeed indefinitely\ncomplex. This conclusion is nowhere so forcefully stated in the\npublished Principia, but knowledgeable readers nonetheless saw\nthe work as answering the question whether the true motions are\nmathematically perfect in the negative. \n\nFinally, the second and third segments together not only point out that\nKeplerian motion is only an approximation to the true motions, but they\ncall attention to the potential pitfalls in using the orbits published\nby Kepler and others as evidence for claims about the planetary\nsystem. For example, if the true motions are so complicated, then\nit is not surprising that all the different calculational approaches\nwere achieving comparable accuracy, for all of them at best hold only\napproximately. Equally, the success in calculating the orbits\ncould not serve as a basis to argue against Cartesian vortices, for the\nirregularities entailed by them could not simply be dismissed.\nThe spectre raised was the very one Newton had objected to during the\ncontroversy over his earlier light and color papers: too many\nhypotheses could be made to fit the same\n data.[10]\nWorse, the multiplicity\nof tenable hypotheses was a spectre haunting mathematical astronomy as\na discipline from the end of the sixteenth century\n forward.[11]\nSo, the\nconclusion that calculated orbits can at most be mere approximations\nwould have been seen as raising the possibility that truth and\nexactness were beyond the reach of mathematical astronomy. The\nmain reason why the Principia includes so much beyond the “De\nMotu” tract is Newton's endeavor to reach conclusions that had claim to\nbeing exact and true in spite of the inordinate complexities of the\nactual motions. \n\nThe historical context in which Newton wrote the Principia\ninvolved a set of issues that readers of the first edition saw it as\naddressing: Was Kepler's approach to calculating the orbits, or some\nother, to be preferred? Was there some empirical basis for\nresolving the issue of the Copernican versus the Tychonic system?\nWere the true motions complicated and irregular versus the calculated\nmotions? Can mathematical astronomy be an exact science? No\nreader of the Principia at the time had the benefit of seeing\nhow Newton had these questions tied together in the “Copernican\nScholium” because it did not appear in print until two hundred\nyears\n later.[12]\nNothing, however, brings out more clearly the extent to which the\nexpanded scope of the Principia stemmed from Newton's\npreoccupation with the problem of reaching conclusions that had claim\nto being exact from evidence that, by his reckoning, held at best to\nhigh approximation. This is why the “Copernican scholium”\nprovides the most illuminating context for reading the\nPrincipia. Equally, its being unknown for so long helps\nto explain why the Principia has generally been read so\nsimplistically. \n\nNewton originally planned a two-book work, with the first book\nconsisting of propositions mathematically derived from the laws of\nmotion, including a handful concerning motion under resistance forces,\nand the second book, written and even formatted in the manner of\nDescartes's Principia, applying these propositions to lay out\nthe system of the world. By the middle of 1686 Newton had\nswitched to a three-book structure, with the second book devoted to\nmotion in resisting media. What appears to have convinced him\nthat this topic required a separate book was the promise of\npendulum-decay experiments to allow him to measure the variation of\nresistance forces with\n velocity.[14]\nWhen Hooke raised a priority issue on\ninverse-square forces, Newton dropped the original version of the last\nbook, switching to presenting the system of the world in a sequence of\nmathematically argued propositions, many of which demand far more of\nthe reader than anything in the original version. The original\n“System of the World” did appear in print the year after Newton died.\nNo complete text for the original version of Book 1 has ever been\nfound. \n\nNewton was disappointed in the critical response to the first\nedition. The response in England was adulatory, but the failure\nto note loose ends must have led Newton to doubt how much anyone had\nmastered technical details. The leading scientific figure on the\nContinent, Christiaan Huygens, offered a mixed response to the book in\nhis Discourse on the Cause of Gravity (1690). On the one\nhand, he was convinced by Newton's argument that inverse-square\nterrestrial gravity not only extends to the Moon, but is one in kind\nwith the centripetal force holding the planets in orbit; on the other\nhand, \n\nOthers on the Continent pressed this complaint even more\nforcefully. The response that may well have bothered Newton most\nwas the review in Journal des Sçavants: \n\nThe work of M. Newton is a mechanics, the most perfect that one could\nimagine, as it is not possible to make demonstrations more precise or\nmore exact than those he gives in the first two books…. But one\nhas to confess that one cannot regard these demonstrations otherwise\nthan as only mechanical; indeed the author recognizes himself at the\nend of page four and the beginning of page five that he has not\nconsidered their Principles as a Physicist, but as a mere\nGeometer…. \n \nIn order to make an opus as perfect as\npossible, M. Newton has only to give us a Physics as exact as his\nMechanics. He will give it when he substitutes true motions for\nthose that he has\n supposed.[15] \n\nComplicating the matter further was the publication in 1689 of\nLeibniz's “Essay on the causes of celestial motions,” which offered a\nvortex theory in which “a planet moves with a double motion\ncomposed of the harmonic circulation of its fluid deferent orb, and the\nparacentric motion, as if it had a certain gravity of attraction,\nnamely an impulsion towards the Sun” [L,\n 132].[16]\nLeibniz further concluded that when the body “is carried in an\nellipse (or another conic section) with a harmonic\ncirculation, and the centre both of attraction and of circulation is at\nthe focus of the ellipse, then the attractions or solicitations of\ngravity will be directly as the squares of the circulations, or\ninversely as the squares of the radii or distances from the focus”\n[L, 137]. So, within a year and a half of the\npublication of the Principia a competing vortex theory of\nKeplerian motion had appeared that was consistent with Newton's\nconclusion that the centripetal forces in Keplerian motion are\ninverse-square. This gave Newton reason to sharpen the argument\nin the Principia against vortices. \n\nThe second edition appeared in 1713, twenty six years after the\nfirst. It had five substantive changes of note. First, the\nstructure of the argument for universal gravity at the beginning of\nBook 3 was made more evident, and the word ‘hypothesis’ was dropped\nfrom it. Second, because of disappointment with pendulum-decay\nexperiments and an erroneous claim about the rate a liquid flows\nvertically through a hole in the bottom of a container, the second half\nof Section 7 of Book 2 was entirely replaced, ending with new\nvertical-fall experiments to measure resistance forces versus velocity\nand a forcefully stated rejection of all vortex\n theories.[17]\nThird,\nthe treatment of the variation of surface gravity with latitude (Book\n3, Proposition 20) was significantly extended, partly in response to\nHuygens's alternative treatment of this variation, but also because of\nmore recent data from near the Equator. Fourth, the treatment of\nthe wobble of the Earth producing the precession of the equinoxes was\nrevised in order to accommodate a much reduced gravitational force of\nthe Moon on the Earth than in the first edition. Fifth, several\nfurther examples of comets were added at the end of Book 3, taking\nadvantage of Halley's efforts on the topic during the intervening\nyears. In addition to these, two changes were made that were more\npolemical than substantive: Newton added the General Scholium following\nBook 3 in the second edition, and his editor Roger Cotes provided a\nlong anti-Cartesian (and anti-Leibnizian) Preface. \n\nThe third edition appeared in 1726, thirty nine years after the\nfirst. Most changes in it involved either refinements or new\ndata. The most significant revision of substance was to the\nvariation of surface gravity with latitude, where Newton now concluded\nthat the data showed that the Earth has a uniform density.\nSubsequent editions and translations have been based on the third\nedition. Of particular note is the edition published by two\nJesuits, Le Seur and Jacquier, in 1739-42, for it contains\nproposition-by-proposition commentary, much of it employing the\nLeibnizian calculus, that extends to roughly the same length as\nNewton's text. \n\nThe Principia opens with a section called “Definitions”\nthat includes Newton's discussion of absolute space, time, and\nmotion. No part of the Principia has received more\ndiscussion by philosophers over the three centuries since it was\npublished. Unfortunately, however, a tendency not to pay close\nattention to the text has caused much of this discussion to produce\nunnecessary\n confusion.[18] \n\nThe definitions inform the reader of how key technical terms, all of\nthem designating quantities, are going to be used throughout the\nPrincipia. In the process Newton introduces terms that\nhave remained a part of physics ever since, such as mass,\ninertia, and centripetal force. The emphasis in\nevery one of the definitions is on how the designated quantity is to be\nmeasured, as illustrated by the opening definition: “Quantity of matter\n[or mass] is a measure of matter that arises from its density and\nvolume jointly.” (Because a primary measure of density was then\nspecific gravity, no circularity arises here.) Newton\ndistinguishes among three ways of quantifying centripetal forces: the\nabsolute quantity, which corresponds to what we would call the field\nstrength of a central force field; the accelerative quantity, which “is\nthe measure of this force that is proportional to the acceleration\ngenerated in a given time;” and the motive quantity, which is the\nmeasure of the force proportional to what we would call the change in\nlinear momentum in a given time. \n\nIt is important to recognize that, in calling the referents of the\ndefined terms “quantities,” Newton is assigning them to the ontological\ncategory of quantity in Aristotle's sense. Thus force and motion\nare quantities that have direction as well as magnitude, and it makes\nno sense to talk of forces as individuated entities or\nsubstances. Newton's laws of motion and the propositions derived\nfrom them involve relations among quantities, not among objects.\nIn place of “no entity without identity,” we have “no quantity without\ndefinite\n proportions;”[19]\nand the demand on measurement is to supply\nvalues that unequivocally yield an adequate approximation to these\ndefinite proportions. \n\nImmediately following the eight definitions is a Scholium on space,\ntime, and motion. One source of confusion in the literature on\nthis scholium is not paying attention to the primary distinction Newton\nis drawing, which is between “absolute, true, mathematical” motion\nversus “relative, apparent, common” motion. The naive distinction\nbetween true and apparent motion was, of course, entirely\ncommonplace. Moreover, Newton is scarcely introducing it into\nastronomy. Ptolemy's principal innovation in orbital astronomy —\nthe so-called bi-section of eccentricity — entailed that half of the\nobserved first inequality in the motion of the planets arises from a\ntrue variation in speed, and half from an only apparent variation\nassociated with the observer being off center. Similarly,\nCopernicus's main point was that the second inequality — that is, the\nobserved retrograde motions of the planets — involved not true, but\nonly apparent motions. And the subsequent issue between the\nCopernican and Tychonic system concerned whether the observed annual\nmotion of the Sun through the zodiac is a true or only an apparent\nmotion of the Sun. So, what Newton is doing in the scholium on\nspace and time is not to introduce a new distinction, but to explicate\nwith more care a distinction that had been fundamental to astronomy for\ncenturies. \n\nThe distinctions between “absolute, true, and mathematical” and\n“relative, apparent, and common” time and space are the conceptual\nbasis Newton employs in laying out the corresponding distinction for\nmotion. He says, “relative, apparent, and common time is any\nsensible and external measure (precise or imprecise) of duration by\nmotion,” adding a parallel point about absolute space. He points\nout that the distinction between absolute and relative time has long\nbeen part of astronomy insofar as astronomers have long introduced\ncorrections (via the equation of time) to the natural day “in order to\nmeasure celestial motions on the basis of a truer time,” and he raises\nthe possibility of there being “no uniform motion by which time may\nhave an exact measure.” Absolute motion is defined as change from\none place in absolute space to another. “But since these parts of\nspace cannot be seen and cannot be distinguished from one another by\nour senses, we use sensible measures in their stead,” adding “it is\npossible that there is no body truly at rest to which places and\nmotions may be referred” [P, 410]. In short,\nboth absolute time and absolute location are quantities that cannot\nthemselves be observed, but instead have to be inferred from measures\nof relative time and location, and these measures are always only\nprovisional; that is, they are always open to the possibility of being\nreplaced by some new (still relative) measure that is deemed to be\nbetter behaved across a variety of phenomena in parallel with the way\nin which sidereal time was deemed to be preferable to solar\ntime. \n\nNotice here the expressed concern with measuring absolute, true,\nmathematical time, space, and motion, all of which are identified at\nthe beginning of the scholium as quantities. The scholium that\nfollows the eight definitions thus continues their concern with\nmeasures that will enable values to be assigned to the quantities in\nquestion. Newton expressly acknowledges that these measures are\nwhat we would now call theory-mediated and provisional.\nMeasurement is at the very heart of the Principia. It\npervades the definitions and scholium on space and time precisely\nbecause the primary point of this section is to spell out (in Howard\nStein's words) “the empirical content of a set of theoretical\nnotions” [Stein, 1967, 281]. \n\nAccordingly, while Newton's distinctions between absolute and relative\ntime and space provide a conceptual basis for his explicating his\ndistinction between absolute and relative motion, absolute time and\nspace cannot enter directly into empirical reasoning insofar as they\nare not themselves empirically accessible. In other words, the\nPrincipia presupposes absolute time and space for purposes of\nconceptualizing the aim of measurement, but the measurements themselves\nare always of relative time and space, and the preferred measures are\nthose deemed to be providing the best approximations to the absolute\nquantities. Newton never presupposes absolute time and space in\nhis empirical reasoning. Motion in the planetary system is\nreferred to the fixed stars, which are provisionally being taken as an\nappropriate reference for measurement, and sidereal time is\nprovisionally taken as the preferred approximation to absolute\ntime. Moreover, in the corollaries to the laws of motion Newton\nspecifically renounces the need to worry about absolute versus relative\nmotion in two cases: \n\n Corollary 5. When bodies are\nenclosed in a given space, their motions in relation to one another are\nthe same whether the space is at rest or whether it is moving uniformly\nstraight forward without circular motion. \n\n Corollary 6. If bodies are\nmoving in any way whatsoever with respect to one another and are urged\nby equal accelerative forces along parallel lines, they will all\ncontinue to move with respect to one another in the same way as they\nwould if they were not acted on by those forces. \n\nSo, while the Principia presupposes absolute time and space\nfor purposes of conceptualizing absolute motion, the presuppositions\nunderlying all the empirical reasoning about actual motions are\nphilosophically more modest. \n\nIf absolute time and space cannot serve to distinguish absolute from\nrelative motions — more precisely, absolute from relative\nchanges of motion — empirically, then what can? Newton\nanswers, “The causes which distinguish true motions from relative\nmotions are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion.\nTrue motion is neither generated nor changed except by forces impressed\nupon the moving body itself.” The problem then becomes one of\ndistinguishing the forces impressed on bodies, where forces are\nquantities; and hence the key issue is whether there are\ntheory-mediated measures of them that yield unequivocal values — in\ncontrast to different measures of the same force that yield different\nvalues, the hallmark of relative motion. The famous bucket\nexample that follows is offered as illustrating how forces can be\ndistinguished that will then distinguish between true and apparent\nmotion. The final paragraph of the scholium begins and ends as\nfollows: \n\nWhat does follow are two books of propositions that provide means\nfor inferring forces from motions and motions from forces and a final\nbook that illustrates how these propositions can be applied to the\nsystem of the world first to identify the forces governing motion in\nour planetary system and then to use them to differentiate between\ncertain true and apparent motions of particular interest. In this\nrespect, the empirical content of the theoretical concepts that Newton\nhas explicated in the section called “Definitions” is inextricably\nlinked with the physical theory presented in the rest of the\nPrincipia. \n\nThe contention that the empirical reasoning in the Principia\ndoes not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute time and space should\nnot be taken as suggesting that Newton's theory is free of fundamental\nassumptions about time and space that have subsequently proved to be\nproblematic. For example, in the case of space, Newton\npresupposes that the geometric structure governing which lines are\nparallel and what the distances are between two points is\nthree-dimensional and Euclidean. In the case of time Newton\npresupposes that, with suitable corrections for such factors as the\nspeed of light, questions about whether two celestial events happened\nat the same time can in principle always have a definite answer.\nAnd the appeal to forces to distinguish real from apparent non-inertial\nmotions presupposes that free-fall under gravity can always, at least\nin principle, be distinguished from inertial\n motion.[20] \n\nEqually, the contention that the empirical reasoning in the\nPrincipia does not presuppose an unbridled form of absolute\nspace should not be taken as denying that Newton invoked absolute space\nas his means for conceptualizing true deviations from inertial\nmotion. Corollary 5 to the Laws of Motion, quoted above, put him\nin a position to introduce the notion of an inertial frame, but he did\nnot do so, perhaps in part because Corollary 6 showed that even using\nan inertial frame to define deviations from inertial motion would not\nsuffice. Empirically, nevertheless, the Principia\nfollows astronomical practice in treating celestial motions relative to\nthe fixed stars, and one of its key empirical conclusions (Book 3,\nProp. 14, Corol. 1) is that the fixed stars are at rest with respect to\nthe center of gravity of our planetary system. \n\nThe designation “laws of motion” had been used in the\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in the late\n1660s for principles governing motion under impact put forward by\nChristopher Wren, John Wallis, and Christiaan Huygens. Only the\nfirst of the three laws Newton gives in the Principia\ncorresponds to any of these principles, and even the statement of it is\ndistinctly different: Every body perseveres in its state of being\nat rest or of moving uniformly straight forward except insofar as it is\ncompelled to change its state by forces impressed. This\ngeneral principle, which following the lead of Newton came to be called\nthe principle or law of inertia, had been in print since Pierre\nGassendi's De motu impresso a motore translato of 1641.\nNewton probably first encountered it in print when he read Descartes'\nPrincipia, where it is comprised by his first two “laws of\nnature” and is used immediately to assert “that any body which is\nmoving in a circle constantly tends to move away from the center of the\ncircle which it is describing.” This is the basis for Descartes\nconcluding that some form of unseen matter (namely the vortices) must\nbe in contact with the planets, for otherwise they would go off in a\nstraight line. It is the first of the three hypotheses from which\nHuygens develops his theory of “falling heavy bodies and their motion\nin a cycloid” in his Horologium Oscillatorium of 1673: If\nthere were no gravity, and if the air did not impede the motion of\nbodies, then any body will continue its given motion with uniform\nvelocity in a straight line. Newton had adopted it as a\n“hypothesis” in the registered version of “De Motu,” though stated\nwithout reference to impressed forces: Every body under the sole\naction of its innate force moves uniformly in a straight line\nindefinitely unless something extraneous hinders it. The\nstriking difference in the formulation in the Principia versus\nthe one in “De Motu” — and, for that matter, versus all earlier\nformulations in print — is the reference to impressed forces. In\nall earlier formulations, any departure from uniform motion in a\nstraight line implied the existence of a material impediment to the\nmotion; in the more abstract formulation in the Principia, the\nexistence of an impressed force is implied, with the question of how\nthis force is effected left open. \n\nThe modern F=ma form of Newton's second law nowhere occurs in\nany edition of the Principia even though he had seen his\nsecond law formulated in this way in print during the interval between\nthe second and third editions in Jacob Hermann's Phoronomia of\n1716. Instead, it has the following formulation in all three\neditions: A change in motion is proportional to the motive force\nimpressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force\nis impressed. In the body of the Principia this law\nis applied both to discrete cases, in which an instantaneous impulse\nsuch as from impact is effecting the change in motion, and to\ncontinuously acting cases, such as the change in motion in the\ncontinuous deceleration of a body moving in a resisting medium.\nNewton thus appears to have intended his second law to be neutral\nbetween discrete forces (that is, what we now call impulses) and\ncontinuous forces. (His stating the law in terms of proportions\nrather than equality bypasses what seems to us an inconsistency of\nunits in treating the law as neutral between these two.) \n\nThe obvious question with the second law is what Newton means by “a\nchange in motion.” If he had meant a change in what we call\nmomentum — that is, if he had meant, in modern notation,\nΔmv — the proper phrasing would have been “a\nchange in the quantity of motion.” In a passage composed in the\nearly 1690s when Newton was intending to restructure the\nPrincipia, he explained what he meant: \n\nIf the body A should [see Fig. 1], at its place A\nwhere a force is impressed upon it, have a motion by which, when\nuniformly continued, it would describe the straight line Aa,\nbut shall by the impressed force be \n\n Figure 1 \n\ndeflected from this line into another one Ab and, when it\nought to be located at the place a, be found at the place\nb, then because the body, free of the impressed force, would\nhave occupied the place a and is thrust out from this place by\nthat force and transferred therefrom to the place b, the\ntranslation of the body from the place a to the place\nb will, in the meaning of this Law, be proportional to this\nforce and directed to the same goal towards which this force is\nimpressed. Whence, if the same body deprived of all motion and\nimpressed by the same force with the same direction, could in the same\ntime be transported from the place A to the place B,\nthe two straight lines AB and ab will be parallel and\nequal. For the same force, by acting with the same direction and\nin the same time on the same body whether at rest or carried on with\nany motion whatever, will in the meaning of this Law achieve an\nidentical translation towards the same goal; and in the present case\nthe translation is AB where the body was at rest before the\nforce was impressed, and ab where it was there in a state of\nmotion. [M, 541] \n\nIn other words, the measure of the change in motion is the distance\nbetween the place where the body would have been after a given time had\nit not been acted on by the force and the place it is after that\ntime. This is in keeping with the measure universally used at the\ntime for the strength of the acceleration of surface gravity, namely\nthe distance a body starting from rest falls vertically in the first\nsecond. The only special provision that Newton has to make is for\nnon-uniform continuously acting forces, for which, in accord with Lemma\n10, he takes the distance AB to vary “at the very\nbeginning of the motion in the squared ratio of the\n times.”[21] \n\nIf this way of interpreting the second law seems perverse, keep in\nmind that the geometric mathematics Newton used in\nthe Principia — and others were using before him\n— had no way of representing acceleration as a quantity in its\nown right. Newton, of course, could have conceptualized acceleration\nas the second derivative of distance with respect to time within the\nframework of the symbolic calculus. This indeed is the form in which\nJacob Hermann presented the second law in his Phoronomia of\n1716 (and Euler in the 1740s). But the geometric mathematics used in\nthe Principia offered no way of representing second\nderivatives. (Newton employed curvature — that is, the circle\n“touching a curve” — in place of the second\nderivative with respect to distance throughout\nthe Principia). Hence, it was natural for Newton to stay with\nthe established tradition of using a length as the measure of the\nchange of motion produced by a force, even independently of the\nadvantage this measure had of allowing the law to cover both discrete\nand continuously acting forces (with the given time taken in the limit\nin the continuous case). \n\nUnder this interpretation, Newton's second law would not have seemed\nnovel at the time. The consequences of impact were also being\ninterpreted in terms of the distance between where the body would have\nbeen after a given time, had it not suffered the impact, and where it\nwas after this time, following the impact, with the magnitude of this\ndistance depending on the relative bulks of the impacting bodies.\nMoreover, Huygens's account of the centrifugal force (that is, the\ntension in the string) in uniform circular motion in his Horologium\nOscillatorium used as the measure for the force the distance\nbetween where the body would have been had it continued in a straight\nline and its location on the circle in a limiting small increment of\ntime; and he then added that the tension in the string would also be\nproportional to the weight of the body. So, construed in the\nindicated way, Newton's second law was novel only in its replacing bulk\nand weight with\n mass.[22] \n\nIn the early stages of his work on the Principia Newton had\nidentified three logically equivalent alternatives for the third law:\nthe action-reaction principle he ultimately chose, the principle we\ncall conservation of linear momentum (Corollary 3 in the\nPrincipia), and the principle that “the common center of\ngravity of two or more bodies does not change its state whether of\nmotion or of rest as a result of the actions of the bodies upon one\nanother” (Corollary 4). Huygens had stated that both of these\nprinciples follow from his solution for spheres in collision, and the\ncenter of gravity principle, as Newton emphasizes, amounts to nothing\nmore than a generalization of the principle of inertia. Even\nthough his third law was novel in comparison with these other\n two,[23]\nNewton\nnevertheless chose it and relegated the other two to corollaries.\nTwo things can be said about this choice. First, the third law is\na local principle, while the two alternatives to it are global\nprinciples, and Newton, unlike those working in mechanics on the\nContinent at the time, generally preferred fundamental principles to be\nlocal, perhaps because they pose less of an evidence burden.\nSecond, with the choice of the third law, the three laws all expressly\nconcern impressed forces: the first law authorizes inferences to the\npresence of an impressed force on a body, the second, to its magnitude\nand direction, and the third to the correlative force on the body\nproducing it. In this regard, Newton's three laws of motion are\nindeed axioms characterizing impressed force. Real forces, in\ncontrast to such apparent forces as Coriolis forces (of which Newton\nwas entirely aware, though of course not under this name), are forces\nfor which the third law, as well as the first two, hold, for only by\nmeans of this law can real forces and hence changes of motion be\ndistinguished from apparent ones. \n\nNewton presents his first two laws as already “accepted by\nmathematicians and confirmed by experiments of many kinds”\n[P,\n 424].[24]\nFor the third law, by contrast, he\noffers a variety of forms of support, including experiments on\nimpact. One important element that becomes clear in his\ndiscussion of evidence for the third law — and also in Corollary 2 —\nis that Newton's impressed force is the same as static force that had\nbeen employed in the theory of equilibrium of devices like the level\nand balance for some time. Newton is not introducing a novel\nnotion of force, but only extending a familiar notion of force.\nIndeed, Huygens too had employed this notion of static force in his\nHorologium Oscillatorium when he identified his centrifugal\nforce with the tension in the string (or the pressure on a wall)\nretaining an object in circular motion, in explicit analogy with the\ntension exerted by a heavy body on a string from which it is\ndangling. Huygens's theory of centrifugal force was going beyond\nthe standard treatment of static forces only in its inferring the\nmagnitude of the force from the motion of the body in a circle.\nNewton's innovation beyond Huygens was first to focus not on the force\non the string, but on the correlative force on the moving body, and\nsecond to abstract this force away from the mechanism by which it acts\non the body. Three steps were thus involved in passing from the\nalready familiar static forces to the more abstract Newtonian “dynamic”\nforces, one by Huygens and two by\n Newton.[25] \n\nThe continuity with Huygens's theory of centrifugal force is important\nin another respect. In his brief defense of the first two laws of\nmotion Newton remarks, “What has been demonstrated concerning the times\nof oscillating pendulums depends on the same first two laws and first\ntwo corollaries, and this is supported by daily experience with clocks”\n[P, 424]. In Huygens's Horologium\nOscillatorium, the only place any counterpart to the second law\nsurfaces is in the theory of centrifugal force and uniform circular\nmotion. The theory Huygens presents extends to conical pendulums,\nincluding a conical pendulum clock that he indicates has advantages\nover simple pendulum clocks. In the 1670s Newton had used a\nconical pendulum to confirm Huygens's announced value of the strength\nof surface gravity as measured by simple cycloidal and small-arc\ncircular\n pendulums.[26]\n(Huygens himself had measured the\nstrength of surface gravity with a conical pendulum, obtaining the same\nvalue to four significant figures as he had obtained with\nsimple\n pendulums.[27])\nThe precise agreement between these\ntwo theory-mediated measures of surface gravity, one of them predicated\non Newton's first two laws of motion and the other not, in fact\nconstituted the strongest evidence for the first two laws at the time\nthe Principia was first published. For, the simple\npendulum measure was known to be stable and accurate into the fourth\nsignificant figure. The evidence in hand for the first two laws, taken\nas a basis for measuring forces, was thus much stronger than has often\nbeen appreciated. \n\nSave perhaps for the attribution of the F=ma form of the\nsecond law to the Principia, the most widespread mistake about\nNewton's three laws of motion is that they alone sufficed for all\nproblems in classical mechanics. Those who developed what we now\ncall Newtonian mechanics during the eighteenth century at all times\nappreciated how far from the truth this is. Newton's three laws\nof motion suffice for problems involving what Euler dubbed\n“point-masses.” Indeed, once given the forces acting on a point\nmass, the three laws hold for all point-masses, including those that\nlie within bodies. But the three laws must be supplemented by\nfurther principles for a whole host of celebrated problems involving\nbodies, rigid or otherwise, that are not mere point-masses.\nPerhaps the simplest prominent example at the time was the problem of a\nsmall arc circular pendulum with two (or more) point-mass bobs along\nthe string. Huygens had solved this problem in the part of his\nHorologium Oscillatorium entitled “The Center of Oscillation,”\nin the process providing the theoretical basis for using added masses\nto tune pendulum\n clocks.[28]\nThe reason why Newton's three laws of\nmotion have to be supplemented to solve this problem is easy to\nsee. Consider the case of a pendulum with two point-masses along\nthe length of a rigid string. The outer point-mass has the effect\nof reducing the speed of the inner one, versus what it would have had\nwithout the outer one, and the inner point-mass increases the speed of\nthe outer one. In other words, motion is transferred from the\ninner one to the outer one along the segment of the string joining\nthem. Once the force transmitted to each point-mass along the\nstring is known, Newton's three laws of motion are sufficient to\ndetermine the motion. But his three laws are not sufficient to\ndetermine what this force transmitted along the string is. Some\nother principle beyond them is needed to solve the problem. Which\nprinciple is to be preferred in solving this problem became a\ncelebrated issue extending across most of the eighteenth\n century.[29] \n\nBook 1 develops a mathematical theory of motion under centripetal\nforces. In keeping with the Euclidean tradition, the propositions\nmathematically derived from the laws of motion are labeled either as\ntheorems or as problems. The theorems all have an “if-then” form,\nenabling them to authorize inferences of their consequents, given\ntheir\n antecedents.[30]\nBut then so too do the problems in\neffect have an “if-then” logical form, for the (geometric style)\nsolutions they provide authorize inferences from given information to\nunknowns. The best way to think of the derived propositions,\ntherefore, is as “inference-tickets.” As such, the propositions\nfall into three categories: (1) ones that license conclusions about\nforces from information about motions, (2) ones that license conclusions\nabout motions from information about forces, and (3) ones that license\nconclusions about (net) forces directed toward whole bodies from\ninformation about (contributing) forces directed toward the individual\nparts of the bodies. \n\nA fundamental contrast between Newton's mathematical theory of motion\nunder centripetal forces and the mathematical theories of motion\ndeveloped by Galileo and Huygens is that Newton's is generic.  Galileo\nand Huygens examined one kind of force, uniform gravity, with a goal\nof deriving testable consequences. Newton's theory covers not only\nforces that vary as 1/r2, for which the\nPrincipia is famous, but also forces that vary as r,\nas 1/r3, and even as any arbitrary function of\nr. At the end of Section 11 he gives a reason, quoted\nearlier: \n\nHe had other reasons as well. The theory of gravity entails\nthat gravity below the surface of a uniformly dense sphere varies\nlinearly with the distance from the center, and hence, at least to a\nfirst approximation, this is how gravity varies below the surface of\nthe Earth. Centripetal forces that vary as\n1/r3 hold if and only if the trajectory is\na\n spiral;[31]\nand,\ngiven any stationary orbit governed by centripetal forces,\nsuperposition of a 1/r3 centripetal force will\ncause that orbit to precess, as in the case of the lunar\n orbit.[32]\nStill,\nNewton's main reason appears to have been the one given in the\nquotation. \n\nIn one curious respect that Newton mentions only once in passing, the\ntheory does not cover all “conditions that may be supposed.”\nNewton's theory treats centripetal forces that vary only with the\ndistance from the force center, that is, ones for which the force on\ntwo bodies equally distant from that center is always the same.\nIt does not treat centripetal forces that vary with θ\nand φ, the two angular components of (r,\nθ, φ) spherical coordinates. This is\nnotable for two reasons. First, the central forces arising in\nCartesian vortices would almost certainly have varied with both of\nthese angular components, and hence Newton is tacitly begging a\nquestion. Second, as Newton himself realized and noted in Section\n13 of Book 1, gravity around a spheroid does not vary simply as\n1/r2, but must also vary with\n latitude.[33]\nFrom\nNewton's point of view, therefore, gravity around Jupiter and the\nEarth, and surely the Sun as well, does not vary simply as\n1/r2. This is one of many often ignored cues\npointing to the extent to which the evidential reasoning in the\nPrincipia has to be more intricate and subtle than was\nappreciated at the time, or for that matter even now. \n\nUp to the end of Section 10, Book 1 considers forces that are directed\ntoward geometric centers rather than bodies. As a consequence, only\nthe first two laws of motion enter into any of the proofs until late\nin Book 1. Even further, as Newton develops the theory to that point,\nonly the accelerative measure of force is employed, and hence even\nmass plays no role. Included in this segment are by far the\nmost widely read parts of Book 1, then and now: Section 2, which deals\nwith centripetal forces generally, and Section 3, which develops\nNewton's fundamental discovery that a body moves in a conic section,\nsweeping out equal areas in equal times about a focus, if and only if\nthe motion is governed by an inverse-square centripetal force directed\ntoward this focus. The stick-figure picture of Book 1 that results\nfrom viewing these two sections as its high point blinds the reader\nnot only to the richness of the theory developed in it, but also to\nseveral no less important results derived in the rest of it. \n\nThe paragraph that opens Section 11 announces, “Up to this point I have\nbeen setting forth the motions of bodies attracted toward an immovable\ncenter, such as, however, hardly exists in the natural world…. I\nnow go on to set forth the motion of bodies that attract one another”\n[P, 561] The section first successfully solves\nthe problem of the motion of two bodies under inverse-square mutual\nattraction. It then turns to the case of more than two bodies,\nfor which Newton can solve only the case of mutual attraction that\nvaries linearly with the distance between bodies. For the\ninverse-square case, Newton gives only qualitative results, most of\nthem in 22 corollaries to Proposition 66 that Newton calls “imperfect”\nin the Preface to the first edition. All of these corollaries\nidentify qualitative tendencies in the motions of a body orbiting a\nsecond body and attracted to a third, with the majority of the results\ndirected specifically to the perturbing effects of the Sun on the\nmotion of our Moon. It is with Section 11, then, that the\nPrincipia departs from the realm of the “De Motu” tract and\nbegins to consider the complexities of the true motions. \n\nSections 12 and 13 treat attractive forces between bodies that result\nfrom — are composed out of — centripetal forces between each of the\nindividual microphysical particles forming them. Section 12\ntreats spherical bodies, and Section 13, non-spherical bodies. As\nNewton anticipated, this was the part of Book 1 that would arouse the\nstrongest complaints from readers committed to the view that all forces\ninvolve contact between bodies. On top of this, nowhere in Book 1\ndid the mathematics become more demanding than here. These two\nsections give primary attention to inverse-square forces and forces\nthat vary linearly with distance, but, just as earlier in Book 1, some\nresults pertain to forces that vary in other ways, included among which\nare results pointing to experiments that might differentiate between\ninverse-square and any alternative to it. In the Scholium to\nProposition 78 Newton singles out the result of this inquiry that he\nregarded as most notable: \n\nThis is one of the few places in the Principia where Newton\nsingles out a result in an aside in this way. That an attracting\nsphere can be treated as if the mass were concentrated at its center in\nthe case of attractive forces that vary linearly with the distance was\nnot so notable, for as Newton shows in Section 13, in this case of\nattractive forces an attracting body always can be treated as if the\nmass were located at its center of gravity, regardless of shape.\nThe truly notable finding is that it is also true of spheres in the\ncase of inverse-square forces. The subsequent results in Sections\n12 and 13 indicate that, in the case of all other kinds of centripetal\nforce, the attraction toward a sphere is not the same as attraction\ntoward all its mass concentrated in the center; and even in the\ninverse-square case, the result does not hold for other shapes or for\nspheres that do not have spherically symmetric density. \n\nAlthough Newton does not so expressly single out other results of Book\n1, a few deserve comment here. The key that opened the way to\nNewton's theory of motion under centripetal forces was his discovery of\nhow to generalize to non-circular trajectories the solution that he and\nHuygens had obtained for the central force in uniform circular\nmotion. Figure 2 shows Newton's diagram for this generalization\nfrom the first edition. Suppose first that the trajectory APQ is\npart of a circle of radius SP along which the body at P is moving\nuniformly. Both Newton and Huygens had reasoned that the\ndisplacement QR from the tangent is proportional to the product of the\nforce retaining the body in its circular orbit and the square of the\ntime t for the body to Figure 2 \n\nmove from P to Q, and hence the force varies as\nQR/t2. But the time is proportional to PQ\ndivided by the velocity v, and in the limit as Q approaches P,\nPQ approaches PR, so that t2 becomes equal to\nPR2/v2. Proposition 36 of Book 3\nof Euclid entails that in this limit PR2 is equal to the\nproduct of QR and twice the radius SP, and hence the force for uniform\nmotion in a circle varies as v2/SP or\n v2/r.[35] \n\nNewton's Proposition 6 generalizes this result to not necessarily\nuniform motion under centripetal forces along an arbitrary\ntrajectory in which equal areas are swept out in equal times with\nrespect to S, in accord with Proposition 1 of Book 1. The central\nforce at P is again proportional to the displacement from the tangent\nQR over a short increment of time divided by the square of this time;\nbut now the time is proportional not to the arc PQ, but to the area\nswept out, which in the limit as Q approaches P, is the triangular area\nSPxQT/2. Therefore, to keep a body moving along a given\nnon-circular trajectory, the centripetal force must vary along the\ntrajectory as (1/SP2) — that is, 1/r2\n— times the limit of (QR/QT2) as Q approaches P. In\nthe second edition Newton adds a corollary that displays another way of\nseeing the result as a generalization of uniform circular motion: the\ncentripetal force along the trajectory must everywhere vary as\nv2/(ρsinSPR), where ρ is\nthe radius of curvature of the trajectory at P. With this, the\nbody can be viewed as driven from one instantaneous circle to the next\nby the component of force tangential to the motion, a component that\ndisappears in the case of uniform circular motion. \n\nNewton illustrates the value of Proposition 6 with a series of\nexamples, the two most important of which involve motion in an\nellipse. If the force center is at a focus S of the ellipse, then\nthe limit of (QR/QT2) is everywhere equal to half the\nconstant latus rectum of the ellipse, and hence the force varies as\n1/SP2, or 1/r2. But if the force\ncenter is at the center C of the ellipse, the force turns out to vary\nas PC, that is, linearly with r. This contrast raises an\ninteresting question. What conclusion can be drawn in the case of\nmotion in an ellipse for which the foci are very near the center, and\nthe center of force is not known to be exactly at the focus?\nNewton clearly noticed this question and supplied the means for\nanswering it in the Scholium that ends Section 2. \n\nSection 10 includes a philosophically important result that has gone\nlargely unnoticed in the literature on the Principia.\nNewton's argument that terrestrial gravity extends to the Moon depends\ncrucially on Huygens's precise measurement of the strength of surface\ngravity. This theory-mediated measurement was based on\nthe\n isochronism[36]\nof the cycloidal pendulum under uniform gravity directed in parallel\nlines toward a flat Earth. But gravity is directed toward the\ncenter of the (nearly) spherical Earth along lines that are not\nparallel to one another, and according to Newton's theory it is not\nuniform. So, does Huygens's measurement cease to be valid in the\ncontext of the Principia? Newton recognized this concern\nand addressed it in Propositions 48 through 52 by extending Huygens's\ntheory of the cycloidal pendulum to cover the hypocycloidal pendulum —\nthat is, a cycloidal path produced when the generating circle rolls\nalong the inside of a sphere instead of along a flat surface.\nProposition 52 then shows that such a pendulum, although not\nisochronous under inverse-square centripetal forces, is isochronous\nunder centripetal forces that vary linearly with the distance to the\ncenter. Insofar as gravity varies thus linearly below the surface\nin a uniformly dense sphere, the hypocycloidal pendulum is isochronous\nup to the surface, and hence it can in principle be used to measure the\nstrength of gravity. A corollary to this proposition goes further\nby pointing out that, as the radius of the sphere is increased\nindefinitely, its surface approaches a plane surface and the law of the\nhypocycloidal asymptotically approaches Huygens's law of the cycloidal\npendulum. This not only validates Huygens's measurement of\nsurface gravity, but also provides a formula that can be used to\ndetermine the error associated with using Huygens's theory rather than\nthe theory of the hypocycloidal pendulum. \n\nThus, what Newton has taken the trouble to do in Section 10 is to show\nthat Huygens's theory of pendulums under uniform parallel gravity is a\nlimit-case of Newton's theory of pendulums under universal\ngravity. At the end of Section 2 he points out in passing that\nthis limit strategy also captures Galileo's theory of projectile\nmotion. In other words, Newton took the trouble to show that the\nGalilean-Huygensian theory of local motion under their uniform gravity\nis a particular limit-case of his theory of universal gravity, just as\nEinstein took the trouble to show that Newtonian gravity is a\nlimit-case of the theory of gravity of general relativity.\nNewton's main reason for doing this appears to have been the need to\nvalidate a measurement pivotal to the evidential reasoning for\nuniversal gravity in Book 3. From a philosophic standpoint,\nhowever, what is striking is not merely his recognizing this need, but\nmore so the trouble he went to to fulfill it. Section 10 may thus\nillustrate best of all that Newton had a clear reason for including\neverything he chose to include in the Principia. \n\nSection 9 includes another often overlooked result that is pivotal to\nthe evidential reasoning for universal gravity in Book 3.\nProposition 45 applies the result on precessing orbits mentioned\nearlier to the special case of nearly circular orbits, that is, orbits\nlike those of the then known planets and their satellites. This\nproposition establishes that such orbits, under purely centripetal\nforces, are stationary — that is, do not precess — if and only if the\ncentripetal force governing them is exactly\ninverse-square. It does this by deriving a formula relating the\nexponent n in the force law to the angle θ\nbetween the point where the orbiting body is furthest from the force\ncenter to the point where it is nearest, that is, the apsidal angle:\nn = (180/θ)2-3. (To\nillustrate, if the apsidal angle is 180 degrees, as in a Keplerian\nellipse, then the exponent in the force law is -2, and if the apsidal\nangle is 90 degrees, as in an ellipse for which the force center is in\nthe center, the exponent is +1.) This result is striking in three\nways. First, insofar as the cumulative effect of even a very\nsmall precession is detectable after several revolutions, this formula\nturns the rate of precession (2θ per revolution) into a\nsensitive measure of the exponent in the force law. Second, it\nyields a conditional beyond “If the orbit is stationary, then the\ncentripetal force is inverse-square,” namely, “If the orbit is\nnearly stationary, then the centripetal force is nearly\ninverse-square.” Using Newton's preferred phrasing, quam\nproxime (literally, “most nearly as possible”), this latter\nconditional has an “If…quam proxime,\nthen…quam proxime” form. Newton illustrates this\nby taking the mean precession rate of the lunar orbit, 3 degrees per\nrevolution, to conclude that the exponent for the net centrifugal force\nacting on the Moon is -2 and 4/243. Third, even when an orbit does\nprecess, once such a fractional departure of the exponent from -2 is\nshown to result from the perturbing effect of outside bodies, then one\ncan still conclude that the force toward the central body is exactly\n-2. This is precisely the strategy Newton follows in concluding\nthat the centripetal force on the Moon, once a correction is made for\nthe perturbing effects of the Sun, is inverse-square. \n\nThis is not the only place in Book 1 where Newton takes the trouble to\nderive an “If…quam proxime, then…quam\nproxime” version of an exact “If…, then…”\nproposition. Propositions 1 and 2 establish that a motion is\ngoverned purely by centripetal forces if and only if equal areas are\nswept out in equal times. The second and third corollaries of\nProposition 3 then yield the conclusion that a motion is quam\nproxime governed purely by centripetal forces if and only if equal\nareas are quam proxime swept out in equal times. Again,\nafter establishing that Kepler's 3/2 power rule holds exactly for\nconcentric uniform circular motions if and only if an exact\ninverse-square centripetal force holds across all the orbits, he adds\nthe generalization, “And universally, if the periodic time is as any\npower Rn of the radius R, … the\ncentripetal force will be inversely as the power\nR2n-1 of the radius,\nand\n conversely.”[37]\nThis result holds for non-integer\nvalues of n, and hence it yields the further result that the\n3/2 power rule holds quam proxime for uniform circular orbits\nif and only if the centripetal force is quam proxime\ninverse-square. These propositions— which Newton has taken the\ntrouble to show still hold in a quam proxime form — are the\nvery ones he invokes in Book 3 to conclude that the forces retaining\nbodies in their orbits in our planetary system are all centripetal and\ninverse-square. (By contrast, as noted earlier, while the\nproposition, “if a Keplerian ellipse exactly, then inverse-square\nexactly,” is true, the proposition, “if a Keplerian ellipse quam\nproxime, then inverse-square quam proxime,” is not true\nwhen the eccentricity of the ellipse is not large, as explained in\nSmith, 2002.) A failure to notice these quam proxime\nforms in Book 1 blinds one to the subtlety of the approximative\nreasoning Newton employs in Book 3. \n\nThe purpose of Book 2 is to provide a conclusive refutation of the\nCartesian idea, adopted as well by Leibniz, that the planets are\ncarried around their orbits by fluid vortices. Newton's main\nargument, which extends from the beginning of Section 1 until the end\nof Section 7, occupies 80 percent of the Book. Section 9, which\nends the Book, offers a further, parting argument. We best\ndispense with this second argument before turning to the first. \n\nThe thrust of the argument in Section 9 is that fluid vortices are\nincompatible with Kepler's area and 3/2 power rules. The argument\nhas two shortcomings, both of them recognized by Newton's opponents at\nthe time. First, the entire argument is predicated on a\nhypothesis: “The resistance that arises from want of slipperiness of\nthe parts of the fluid is, ceteris paribus, proportional to\nthe velocity with which the parts of the fluid are separated from one\nanother.” Fluids of this sort are now called “Newtonian.”\nThe absence of evidence for the hypothesis left Newton's opponents free\nto adopt other rules for the velocity gradient in a vortex generated\naround a rotating cylinder or sphere, rules that could undercut his\nconclusions. Second, his analysis of the vortex generated around\na rotating cylinder or sphere involves fundamentally wrong physics: it\ndefines steady state in terms of a balance of forces instead of torques\nacross each shell element comprising the vortex. To use Johann\nBernoulli's words from 1730, Newton “completely neglects to take into\naccount the action of the lever, the consideration of which however is\nabsolutely necessary here, it being obvious that the same force,\napplied along the tangent to the circumference of a large wheel, has a\ngreater efficacity for making it turn than it has when applied to the\ncircumference of a smaller\n radius.”[38]\n(This is not the only place in the\nPrincipia where it is clear that Newton had not thought\nthrough the mechanics of angular motion.) \n\nThe argument that carried much more weight at the time — it convinced\nHuygens, for example — is the one that extends across the first seven\nsections of the Book. The thrust of this argument is clear from\nits conclusion, as stated more forcefully in the second and third\neditions than in the first: \n\nTo reach this conclusion Newton had to show that (1) the inertia of\nthe fluid does indeed produce a resistance force proportional to its\ndensity, a force that (2) is independent of the tenacity (that is,\nsurface friction) and the friction of the parts (that is, viscosity) of\nthe fluid. Perhaps in part in emulation of the approach to\ncentripetal forces that appeared to have succeeded so well in Books 1\nand 3, the approach Newton takes in Book 2 is to develop, so far as he\ncan, a generic mathematical theory of motion under resistance forces\nand then turn to experimental phenomena so that, in the words of Book\n1, “it may be found out which conditions of forces apply” to different\nkinds of fluids. The theory in Book 1 is generic in that it\nexamines centripetal forces that vary as different functions of the\ndistance from the force center. The theory in Book 2 is generic\nin that it examines motion under resistance forces that vary as the\nvelocity, the velocity squared, the sum of these two, and ultimately\neven the sum of two or three independent contributions, each of which\nis allowed to vary as any power of velocity whatever. Because\nNewton's goal was to reach a conclusion about the contribution to the\ntotal resistance made by the inertia of the fluid, and he recognized\nthat surface friction and viscosity can contribute to the resistance as\nwell, his empirical problem became one of disaggregating the\ninertial contribution from the total resistance, that is, the\ncontribution that alone varies with the density of the fluid.\nFortunately, because gravitational forces so totally dominate celestial\nmotions, this need to disaggregate different sorts of forces did not\narise in Book 3. \n\nFrom Newton's point of view, then, the basic problem — assuming that\nthree independent mechanisms contribute to the total resistance forces,\nonly one of which is proportional to the fluid density\nρf — was to find an experimental\nphenomenon that would allow him to determine (1) the three exponents in\nthe following schema, and (2) laws defining the three coefficients —\nor, more minimally, at least the variation of the coefficient of the\nlast term for the specific case of spheres: \n\nSome preliminary pendulum-decay experiments showed promise for doing\nthis, leading him in the first edition to rely solely on this\nphenomenon. The idea was to start a pendulum from several\ndifferent heights in order to cover a range of velocities and then to\nuse simultaneous algebraic equations to fit a two or three term\npolynomial to two or three lost-arc data-points, changing the exponents\nuntil the polynomial achieved good agreement with the other lost-arc\ndata points. The theoretical solutions for pendulum motion under\nresistance forces in Section 6 would then allow him to infer the forces\nfrom the rate of decay of the pendulum. These theoretical\nsolutions covered resistance forces that vary not only as velocity to\nthe powers 0, 1, and 2, but also as any power at all of velocity.\nIn principle, therefore, he saw himself in a position to infer laws for\nresistance forces on spheres from the phenomenon of pendulum decay in\nfull parallel with his deduction of the law of universal gravity from\nthe phenomena of orbital motion in Book 3. And he could then\nconclude from the total absence of signs of resistance forces acting on\nthe planets and, most especially, comets that the density of any fluid\nin the celestial regions must be exactly or very nearly zero. \n\nUnfortunately, pendulum-decay turned out not to be as well behaved a\nphenomenon as Newton anticipated it was going to be while he was\nworking on the first edition. The problem, as he later realized,\nwas that he had to let the pendulum swing many times in order to\nmeasure the rate of decay, and in the process it gave rise to a “to and\nfro” motion in the surrounding fluid, so that the relative\nvelocity between the bob and the fluid, which is the velocity that\nmatters in resistance, could not be determined or controlled. The\nGeneral Scholium following Section\n 6[39]\nreports detailed decay-rate data for an\nimpressive range of experiments, including different size bobs in air\nand bobs moving as well in water and mercury. The reader is also\nshown in detail how to proceed from the data in each case to a\npolynomial as above defining the resistance force. Any reader who\nworked through the data discovered what Newton knew, but was less than\ncandid about: no polynomial fit the data. The experiments did\nclearly indicate that resistance forces involve no power of velocity\ngreater than 2, and they provided good evidence that a velocity squared\neffect was dominant, even to the extent of masking any effect involving\nsome other power. Newton also managed to extract some highly\nqualified evidence that the velocity squared effect varies as the\ndensity of the fluid and the frontal area (that is, the square of the\ndiameter) of spheres. \n\nThe approach to resistance in the first edition relied entirely on\npendulum-decay experiments. The disappointing evidence they\nyielded led to a far weaker statement of the conclusion about the\nabsence of fluid in the celestial regions in the first edition than the\nconclusion in the subsequent editions quoted above. Not long\nafter the first edition was published, Newton initiated some\nvertical-fall experiments in water that persuaded him that the\nphenomenon of vertical-fall in resisting media would yield much better\nbehaved data. In the second and third editions, therefore, even\nthough the pendulum-decay experiments are still fully reported, the\ncentral argument in Book 2 relies on vertical-fall experiments\n(including ones from the top of the dome of the newly completed St.\nPaul's Cathedral) to establish a resistance effect on spheres that is\nproportional to the density of the fluid, the square of the diameter,\nand the square of the velocity. The data from these experiments\nwere very good — indeed, even better than Newton realized, for small\nvagaries in them that he dismissed as experimental error were in fact\nnot vagaries at all, but evidence that no polynomial of the sort he was\nseeking is adequate for resistance forces. \n\nWhile the vertical-fall experiments put Newton in a position to make\nhis concluding rejection of vortex theories more forceful, they also\nposed a methodological complication. The vertical-fall\nexperiments offered no way of disaggregating the contribution to\nresistance made by the inertia of the medium from the total\nresistance. But the argument against vortices required him to\nshow that, no matter how perfectly free of friction and viscosity the\ncelestial fluid might be, its inertia would still give rise to\nresistance forces that would affect the motions of comets, if not\nplanets as well. From the resistance measured in the\npendulum-decay experiments, Newton could conclude that the forces in\nair and water are dominated by a contribution that varies as the\nvelocity squared. In the vertical-fall experiments in air and\nwater the measured forces varied to first approximation as the product\nof the density and the velocity squared, but only to a first\napproximation, leaving room to question whether a purely inertial\ncontribution had been isolated. Newton dealt with this problem by\noffering a rather ad hoc theoretical derivation for the purely\ninertial contribution, showing how closely it agreed with the\nvertical-fall results, and proposing that the differences between the\ntheoretical and the measured resistances could be used to investigate\nother contributions. Success of such a program in characterizing\nthe contributions made by surface friction and the viscosity would have\nprovided compelling support for Newton's theory of the inertial\ncontribution. Still, the approach left Newton with not so\nstraightforward a derivation of the laws of resistance forces from\nphenomena as he had hoped for in the first\n edition.[40] \n\nIn fact, there is a deep mistake in Newton's approach to resistance\nforces that came to be understood only at the beginning of the\ntwentieth century. Resistance forces do not arise from\nindependent contributions made by such factors as the viscosity and\ninertia of the fluid. Consequently, no polynomial consisting of a\nfew always positive terms in powers of velocity can ever be adequate\nfor resistance forces. The first indication of this came when\nd'Alembert, unhappy with Newton's ad hoc theory for the\ninertial contribution, analyzed the flow of what we now call a perfect\nfluid about spheres and bodies of other shapes, discovering in all\ncases that the net force of the fluid is exactly zero.\nConsequently, contrary to Newton, there is no such thing as\nthe contribution made to resistance purely by the inertia of\nthe fluid. Resistance forces always arise from a combination of\nviscous and inertial effects, however low the viscosity of the fluid\nmay be. Newton's assumption that resistance forces can be\nrepresented as a sum, one term of which gives the contribution made\npurely by the inertia of the fluid, was wrong empirically, much as his\nassumptions about simultaneity and space being Euclidean turned out to\nbe wrong. Unlike the latter assumptions, however, the\nassumption about resistance amounted to a dead end. All Newton\nachieved in Book 2 with resistance forces was merely a curve-fit. \n\nSave for the short opening sections, “Regulae\nPhilosophandi” and “Phenomena,” Book 3, in contrast to\nBooks 1 and 2, is not marked off into sections. Nevertheless, the\nmain body of it does consist of four clearly separate parts: (1) the\nderivation of the law of gravity (Props. 1-8); (2) implications of this\nlaw for orbital and rotating bodies (from the corollaries to Prop. 8\nthrough Prop. 24); (3) a quantitative derivation of select lunar\ninequalities and the precession of the equinoxes from the law of\ngravity (Props. 25-39); and (4) a solution for comet trajectories, with\nexamples and comments (Props. 40-42). These parts will be\ndiscussed in sequence below. \n\nNewton's first two rules of reasoning appeared in the first edition\n(there labeled as\n hypotheses[41]),\nthe third rule was added in the second\nedition, and the fourth rule, in the third edition. These are\nrules intended to govern evidential reasoning in natural philosophy,\nakin to rules of deductive reasoning except for their very much not\nguaranteeing true conclusions from true premises. In particular,\nRule 2 authorizes the inference from same effect to same cause, a\nnotoriously invalid inference, and Rule 3 authorizes inductive\ngeneralization to all bodies universally of those qualities of bodies\n“that belong to all bodies on which experiments can be made.”\nNewton's phrasing carries no suggestion that these rules yield truths\nor even a high probability of truth. The operative phrase in both\nRules 3 and 4, for example, is properly translated “should be taken,”\nand Rule 4 makes the provisional character of the authorized inferences\nexplicit: \n\nThe philosophic question why Newton's rules are appropriate is best\naddressed not by asking how they increase the probability of truth, but\nby asking whether there is some strategy in ongoing research for which\nthese rules will both promote further discoveries and safeguard against\ndead-end garden paths that ultimately require all the supposed\ndiscoveries to be discarded. \n\nSix astronomical phenomena are listed and discussed in the section\ncalled “Phenomena” — most importantly, that\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the satellites of the\nlatter two sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the\ncentral bodies of their respective orbits, and their periods vary as\nthe 3/2 power of their mean distances from these bodies.  The ellipse,\nby the way, is not one of the phenomena. In Phenomenon 3 Newton rules\nout the Ptolemaic system, just as Galileo had in his Dialogue\nConcerning the Two Chief World Systems, by appealing to the\nphases of Mercury and Venus and their absence in the case of Mars,\nJupiter, and Saturn to conclude that these five orbits encircle the\nSun. But this Phenomenon and all the others are carefully formulated\nto remain neutral between the Copernican and Tychonic systems. In\nPhenomenon 4 Boulliau's calculated orbits are treated on a par with\nKepler's, indicating that the phenomena do not rule out the\npossibility that Boulliau's alternative to the area rule is correct.\nPhenomenon 6 explicitly grants that the area rule holds only\napproximately for the Moon, with a further remark indicating that none\nof the phenomena are being put forward as holding exactly. This points\nthe way to the most reasonable reading of all of the phenomena: they\ndescribe to reasonably high approximation, but not more than that, the\nobservations of the planets and their satellites made by Tycho and\nothers over a finite period of time — roughly from 1570 to the\ntime of Newton's writing. On this way of viewing the Phenomena, they\nare in no way contentious or problematic. They leave entirely open not\nonly questions about whether any claims concerning the orbits made by\nKepler and his contemporaries hold exactly, but also questions about\nwhether any of these claims hold even remotely in other eras, past or\nfuture. The Phenomena are thus not inconsistent with Descartes'\ninsistence that the motions are constantly changing. \n\nThe “deduction” of the law of universal gravity from the phenomena in\nthe first eight propositions of Book 3 has provoked a great deal of\ncontroversy in the philosophical literature over the last century\nor\n so.[42]\nAt\nthe heart of this controversy is the challenge posed by Pierre Duhem:\nhow can a deduction proceed from premises (the planets sweep out equal\nareas in equal times and their orbits are stationary) to a conclusion,\nthe law of gravity, that then implies that the premises are false (the\nplanets do not sweep out equal areas in equal times and the orbits are\nnot stationary, but instead\n precess)?[43]\nThe answer is simple: Newton's\nreasoning is approximative. He is using “if, then” statements\nthat have been shown in Book 1 to hold in “if … quam\nproxime, then … quam proxime” form to infer\nconclusions from premises that hold at least quam proxime over\na restricted period of time. Of course, this means that the\ndeduction shows only that the conclusions, most notably the law of\ngravity, hold quam proxime over the restricted period of time\nfor which the premises hold. The Rules of Reasoning then license\nthe conclusion to be taken exactly, without restriction of space or\ntime. The conclusions, so taken, do indeed then show that the\npremises hold only quam proxime, and not exactly. This\nconclusion in no way contradicts the premises. \n\nRecognizing that Newton's reasoning is approximative answers another\ncomplaint about the “deduction” of universal gravity: Newton invokes\nthe proposition, if bodies move uniformly in concentric circular\norbits whose periods vary as the 3/2 power of the radii, then the\ncentripetal forces acting on these bodies vary as the inverse-square of\nthe radii of the orbits, knowing full well that observation had\nestablished for centuries that the planets do not move uniformly in\ncircular\n orbits.[44]\nNewton does indeed invoke this\nproposition first to conclude (in Prop. 1) that, in modern parlance,\nthere is an inverse-square centripetal acceleration field around\nJupiter and Saturn and next to conclude (in Prop. 2) that there is an\ninverse-square centripetal acceleration field around the\n Sun.[45]\nThe\norbits of the satellites of Jupiter were then considered to be\ncircular, and hence Newton's inference from their motion was not so\nproblematic. While, however, the orbits of Venus, Jupiter, and\nSaturn were considered to be very nearly circular, the motion in them\nhad been known from before Ptolemy not to be uniform. Newton\nexpressly concedes that his inference of the inverse-square from the\n3/2 power rule for the planets is only approximate when, in the very\nnext sentence, he remarks, “But this second part of the proposition is\nproved with the greatest exactness from the fact that the aphelia are\nat rest.” The absence of precession, however, can be used to\ninfer the inverse-square only for each orbit individually, not a\nsingle, unified inverse-square centripetal acceleration field\nencompassing all of the orbits. Newton is accordingly using the\n3/2 rule for circular orbits to establish that an inverse-square field\nholds around the Sun to at least a first approximation, and then using\nthe absence of precession of the individual orbits to tighten the\napproximation. \n\nInterpreting Newton's deduction of universal gravity as an exercise in\napproximative reasoning answers a further complaint of Duhem's: insofar\nas the area rule holds only to high approximation, so too do any number\nof alternatives to it, such as Boulliau's geometric construction, and\nhence Newton's “deduction” begs the question of why the area rule is to\nbe preferred to these\n alternatives.[46]\nThis question, however, is irrelevant\nso long as the conclusion remains in the weak form, the law of gravity\nholds quam proxime for the planets and their satellites over\nthe time period for which observations have shown the phenomena to hold\nquam proxime. The phenomena really are sufficient to\nreach the conclusion in this weak form. So, the complaint has\nbite only when the law of gravity is taken to be exact. But\nthere, however, Newton does provide a response to it when he concludes\nin Propositions 13 and 14 that the planets would describe\nareas exactly proportional to the times in stationary orbits if “the\nSun were at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon\none\n another.”[47]\n The reason, then, why the phenomena from which Newton proceeded in\nthe deduction have claim to being preferred to alternatives to them is\nthat the theory deduced from them, when taken to hold exactly,\nidentifies circumstances under which the phenomena would hold exactly,\nas well. That this be the case amounts to a requirement on the\ndeduction from phenomena: the leap to taking the law of gravity as\nexact is justified only if it yields circumstances in which the\nphenomena from which it was inferred would hold\n exactly.[48] \n\nThis analysis of the “deduction” of universal gravity does\nnot answer two further complaints lodged against it. First, in\nconcluding that the centripetal force acting on the Moon is\ninverse-square, Newton grants that the precession of the lunar orbit\nimplies an exponent of -2 and 4/243 for the force rather than exactly\n-2, but then claims that the small fraction can be accounted for by\nthe perturbing action of the Sun's gravity. But the magnitude for the\naction of the Sun that he gives in Proposition\n 3[49]\nis twice the value he later in Book 3\nindicates is the correct value. This lacuna was not resolved by\nAlexis-Claude Clairaut until two decades after Newton died.\nSecond, when Newton invokes the third law of motion in the corollaries\nto Proposition 5, he is tacitly assuming that, for example, Jupiter and\nthe Sun are, in effect, directly interacting. In other words, he\nis ignoring the alternative favored by Huygens that some unseen medium\nis effecting the centripetal force on Jupiter, a medium that can in\nprinciple absorb the linear momentum which Newton is assuming is being\ntransferred to the Sun. Huygens may well have perceived this\nlacuna, to which Cotes explicitly called Newton's attention while he\nwas preparing the second\n edition.[50] \n\nThe group of propositions following the deduction of universal gravity\ngives indications of the evidential strategy that lies behind the leap\nto taking this law to be exact. Immediately upon concluding first\nthat the planets would sweep out equal areas in equal times in exact\nellipses and then that the orbits would be exactly stationary were it\nnot for the gravitational interactions among the planets, Newton calls\nattention to the easiest to observe deviations from this idealization,\nthe then still mysterious vagaries in the motions of Jupiter and Saturn\nwhich Newton attributes to their gravitational interaction.\nBecause, according to the theory, the idealization would hold exactly\nin the specified circumstances, these and all other deviations must\nresult from further forces not taken into account in the idealized\ncase. Identifying these forces and showing that, according to the\ntheory, they do produce the deviations is a way for ongoing research to\nmarshal continuing evidence to bear on the theory of gravity. To\nput the point differently, the initial idealizations that Newton\nidentifies can serve as the starting point for a process of successive\napproximations that should yield increasingly close agreement with the\ncomplex true motions. These idealizations are especially well\nsuited for this purpose precisely because, according to the theory,\nthey would hold exactly were no other forces at work, and hence every\ndeviation from them should be physically telling, and not just, for\nexample, an accidental feature of a curve-fit. Pursuit of such a\nresearch program of successive approximations promises to yield either\nfurther evidence for the theory of gravity when the program is\nsuccessful or the exceptions Newton speaks of in Rule 4 that require\nthe theory to be revised. \n\nOf the other results developed in the group of propositions following\nthe deduction of universal gravity, the most heralded at the time were\nthe defense of Copernicanism in Proposition 12 and the identification\nof the cause of the tides in Proposition 24 — two topics that Kepler,\nGalileo, and Descartes had all addressed. Nevertheless, the two\nPropositions that proved most important were 19 and 20, which\nrespectively derive the non-spheroidal figure of the Earth and the\nvariation of surface gravity with latitude under the assumption that\nthe density of the Earth is uniform. This is the only passage in\nthe Principia that Newton reworked extensively in both the\nsecond and then again in the third edition. As Newton was fully\naware, and Huygens and a few others realized, these are the only\nresults in the Principia that depend on universal\ngravity — that is, inverse-square gravity directed toward every\nparticle of matter forming the Earth — and not merely macroscopic\ncelestial gravity — inverse-square gravity directed toward\ncelestial bodies. In his Discourse on the Cause of\nGravity, Huygens offered an alternative theoretical account of the\nfigure of the Earth and the variation of surface gravity, and he\nclaimed to have evidence confirming it and hence refuting Newton's\nuniversal\n gravity.[51]\nIn part because evidence on the figure\nof the Earth and the variation of gravity with latitude were accessible\nin expeditions to the equator, these were the results in the\nPrincipia that were the first to receive concerted critical\nattention during the 1730s and 1740s. There was a complication in\nall this, however. The extremely precise results for both the\nfigure of the Earth and the variation of gravity that Newton tabulated\nin the second and third editions were based on uniform density, and\nhence, just like Keplerian motion, represented an idealization,\ndepartures from which would point to non-uniformities of density.\nNot until Clairaut's Theory of the Figure of the Earth did\nmeans become available to calculate the effects of non-uniformities in\nthe\n density.[52] \n\nPropositions 25 through 35 derive quantitative results for three lunar\ninequalities — the systematic departure from the area rule called the\n“the variation,” the 18 year motion of the line of nodes, and the\nfluctuating inclination of the orbit — from the perturbing action of\nthe Sun. For all three Newton starts with a circular orbit, so\nthese too involve departures from an idealization. The values he\nobtained for the different components of the solar perturbing force in\nProposition 25 and subsequently, as needed, were accurate to several\nsignificant figures. All three derivations, which are\nmathematically demanding, were successful in obtaining agreement with\nthe values of the inequalities obtained from observation, especially so\nthe derivation for the recession of the lunar nodes, for which he\nachieves agreement with the known value to better than 98\npercent. (Newton must have been mystified by the failure of his\nseemingly parallel derivation of the 9 year precession of the line of\napsides to achieve better than 50 percent agreement.) \n\nThe Scholium following Proposition 35 opens with the explanation for\nthe preceding efforts on the lunar inequalities: “I wished to show by\nthese computations of the lunar motions that the lunar motions can be\ncomputed from their causes by the theory of gravity”\n[P, 869]. Newton never found a way of deriving\nthe precession of the lunar apogee from the theory of gravity, and\nconsequently he never succeeded with a complete, gravity-derived\naccount of the lunar\n orbit.[53]\nThe mathematical treatment of the three\nlunar inequalities nevertheless did provide added support for his\ntheory of gravity. It also introduced the idea of attacking the\nproblem of the true orbit in a sequence of successive approximations by\ncalculating perturbations in motion in an assumed orbit caused by the\ngravitational action of the Sun. This was not only an entirely\nnew approach to the then unsolved problem of simply describing the\nmotion of the Moon, an approach that proceeded from the physical cause\nto the motion; it was also the beginnings of the perturbational\napproach that dominated all of celestial mechanics from the middle of\nthe eighteenth century until late in the\n twentieth.[54]\nAs difficult as\nPropositions 25 through 35 were for readers at the time — and still\nare for readers now — they crucially promoted the further research on\nthe complicated orbital motions that ultimately supplied overwhelming\nsupport for Newton's theory of gravity. \n\nIt was a real breakthrough when Newton discovered that the\ngravitational forces of the Sun and Moon acting on an oblately\nspheroidal Earth would produce a wobble of the Earth that, at least\nqualitatively, could account for the precession of the Equinoxes.  No\nphysical explanation for this phenomenon had been proposed\nbefore. Newton faced a problem, however, in trying to carry out a\nquantitative derivation of the precession: he knew the magnitude of\nthe gravitational action of the Sun on the Earth but not that of the\nMoon, for he could not obtain the mass of the Moon in the way he had\nfor the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn insofar as no bodies orbit the Moon.\nPropositions 36 and 37 endeavor to infer the force of the Moon on the\nEarth from the difference in the heights of the tides when the Sun and\nMoon are in conjunction and in opposition. In the first edition Newton\nmanaged to derive a value for the rate of the precession in good\nagreement with the known value, but during the quarter century between\nthe first and second editions he concluded that the value he had used\nfor the Moon's force (6 and 1/3 times the Sun's force) was much too\nlarge. The derivation of the precession was therefore extensively\nrevised in the second edition, using a new value for the Moon's force\n(4.4815 times the Sun's force, still more than a factor of 2 greater\nthan the correct value). In all editions the derivation in Proposition\n39 treated the wobble not directly as the motion of a rigid body, but\nby analogy with the motion of the lunar nodes. By the standards of our\npresent physics, no part of Book 3 is further off-base than Newton's\nsolution for the precession. The phenomenon, however, subsequently\nprovided important evidence for Newton's theory of gravity when\nd'Alembert in 1749 carried out a successful derivation based on rigid\nbody motion and a correct value of the Moon's force derived from the\nthen recently discovered phenomenon of the nutation of the Earth. \n\nNewton's account of the tides in Propositions 24, 36, and 37 was\nmuch heralded not only at the time, but still today. He is\nnevertheless receiving more credit for this than he is due. He\ndid identify solar and lunar gravity as the forces driving the tides,\nbut this is all he did. He ignored the rotation of the Earth, and\nworse he considered only the radial component of the solar and lunar\ngravitational forces in these three propositions. In fact, the\nradial component of these forces has a very small effect compared with\nthe transradial component, that is, the component perpendicular to the\nradial component. All of this became clear in the 1770s when\nLaplace developed the mathematical theory of tidal motion from which all\nsubsequent work has proceeded. \n\nBook 3 ends with a revolutionary analysis of comet trajectories that\noccupies roughly one-third of the total length of the Book in all three\neditions. This analysis was slow in coming. As late as June\n1686, Newton wrote: “the third [book] wants the Theory of Comets”\n[C, II, 437]. What made the problem difficult,\nas compared to planet trajectories, was the need to work from a small\nnumber of imprecise one-shot observations made from a moving\nEarth. The method presented in the Principia fits a\nparabola iteratively to the observations, employing novel\nfinite-difference methods that Newton later expanded into a full tract\nin mathematics, “Methodis Differentialis.” The method presupposes\nthe theory of gravity first in opting for a parabola and second in\nassuming that the inverse-square centripetal forces known from the\nplanets act on comets along their entire trajectory. The text\nnotes that the trajectories may well be ellipses, but the period of\nreturn in that case would be the best way of determining the\nellipse. (The parabola approximates the high-curvature end of\nellipses with high eccentricity.) The proposal that comets may\nreturn was novel, but even more revolutionary at the time was the claim\nthat they button-hook around the Sun, implying that what had sometimes\nin the past been taken for two distinct comets were really one comet\nbefore and after perihelion. \n\nIn the first edition the method was applied only to the comet of\n1680-81. The results are presented in a one-foot long diagram on\nthe only fold-out page in the edition. Nothing like this diagram,\nshown in Figure 3, had ever appeared in print before. The\ndiagram continued to appear in the next two editions, though in reduced\nform not requiring a fold-out in the third. In the second edition\nthe method was refined and applied as well to the comets of 1664-65,\n1683, and 1682 reflecting research Halley had carried out and published\nin his Astronomiae Cometicae Synopsis of 1705. The comet\nof 1682, now known as Halley's comet, was singled out as being\nsufficiently similar in trajectory to the comet of 1607 to warrant the\nproposal that it returns every 75 years. \n\n\nFigure 3  \n\nAdded in the third edition was the retrograde comet of 1723, for which\nBradley had supplied comparatively accurate observations and the\nmethod correspondingly displayed its most impressive success, with no\ndiscrepancies between the calculated and observed positions exceeding\n1 minute of arc in either longitude or latitude. This suggested that\nthe more exacting the observations entering into the calculation, the\nmore accurate was the method. \n\nBecause Newton's theory of comet trajectories depended only on that\npart of the theory of gravity that was least controversial —\ninverse-square centripetal accelerations everywhere around the Sun\n— it did not provoke much philosophical resistance. The success\nof the method provided evidence that these centripetal forces act\nequally on comets, contrary to Hooke's proposal in his Cometa\nof 1678 that comets must consist of a fundamentally different kind of\nmaterial from the planets insofar as they do not respond to the forces\ndirected toward the Sun in the same way. The success of the method\nalso provided strong evidence that inverse-square forces toward the\nSun hold throughout the space surrounding it, for not only do comets\ntraverse the spaces between the planet orbits, but also their\ntrajectories, in contrast to those of the then known planets, are\noften highly inclined with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. Most\nof all, however, the success of the method provided the most\ncompelling evidence against not only Cartesian vortices, but all\ntheories claiming that the planets are carried around the Sun by fluid\nvortices. Corollary 3 to Proposition 39 in all three editions\nsummarizes the argument: \n\nThis was the argument that convinced Huygens when he read the first\nedition, and it became all the more compelling thereafter as the method\nwas so successful with further\n comets.[55] \n\nThe added evidence supplied by the theory of comets highlights a\nsometimes overlooked aspect of Book 3. The development of\nevidence for the theory of gravity in it does not end with the\n“deduction” of the law of universal gravity at the beginning, but\ncontinues all the way through the Book. During the eighteenth\ncentury attention focused overwhelmingly on the evidence supplied by\nNewton's theory of the figure of the Earth and the variation of surface\ngravity, the theory of the tides, the quantitative derivations of\nselect lunar inequalities, the derivation of the precession of the\nequinoxes, and the theory of comets. This suggests that, both\nthen and now, the “deduction” of universal gravity should not be read\nin isolation from the rest of Book 3, but instead the entire Book\nshould be seen as offering a sustained evidential argument for the\ntheory. Read this way in the context of the rest of the Book, the\n“deduction” is most appropriately viewed as intended to establish\nuniversal gravity, but only provisionally, as a theory on which further\nresearch is to be predicated, research that will continue to bring\nevidence to bear on the theory. \n\nFrom Halley's anonymous review of the first edition of the\nPrincipia forward, there has been a marked tendency to\noverstate what the Principia achieved, glossing over the many\nloose ends it left for others to recognize and address. A\nconsequence of this is an equal tendency to distort the context of the\nenormous advances made in both mechanics and orbital astronomy during\nthe eighteenth century, diminishing the difficulties those following\nNewton faced and their accomplishments in resolving them. The\nPrincipia is peculiar in this regard, for a list of its\nachievements without mentioning their loose ends overstates what it\naccomplished, but a list of its loose ends risks understating its\nextraordinary achievements. In an effort to strike a balance we\nhere list eleven major scientific issues of the time to which Book 3\nsupplied answers in the sequence listed, the answers, and the most\nimportant loose ends in the reasoning offered in the evidential\narguments for those answers. \n\n1. What physically retains the planets in\norbits around the Sun and their satellites in orbit around\nthem? Newton's answer — inverse-square gravity, one in\nkind with everyday terrestrial gravity — turned on a largely\nsuppressed failure to account for more than half of the precession of\nthe lunar orbit, it tacitly assumed interaction between the Sun and\nJupiter and the other individual planets, and it raised unanswered\nquestions about whether the perihelia of the planetary orbits do or do\nnot precess. \n\n2. How does gravity vary, both below and\nabove the surface of the Earth? In the absence of confirming\ndata, Newton's answer — to a first approximation, linearly with\ndistance to the center below the surface, and inversely with the square\nof the distance above it — presupposed uniform density in the\nfirst part and a spherical Earth with spherically symmetric density in\nthe second, and therefore left open the possibility that gravity is\nconstant near the surface of the Earth, just as Huygens continued to\nclaim in his response to the Principia [HD, 153],\nciting supporting evidence. \n\n3. What are the relative densities of the\nplanets, with respect to one another and to the Sun? Newton\ngives theory-dependent answers for Jupiter, Saturn, and the Earth in\nthe corollaries to Proposition 8, but the one for the Earth, even in\nthe third edition, depended on a still questionable value for the\nhorizontal solar parallax (required to determine the distance of the\nMoon from the Earth in astronomical units), and no corroborating\nevidence for these answers had emerged, such as from the actions of\nJupiter and Saturn on one another. \n\n4. Is there some principled way to\nresolve the dispute between the Copernican and Tychonic systems and\nthereby settle the question of the proper center to which all the\nmotions in our planetary system should be referred? Newton's\nanswer — the center of gravity of the system, about which the Sun\ncirculates at comparatively small distances — depended on the\nassumed applicability of the third law of motion in claiming that the\nSun is in motion, and the precise location of the center of gravity\nremained open in the absence of values for the relative masses of\nMercury, Venus, and Mars. \n\n5. What are the true motions of the\nplanets, and which, if any, of the schemes for calculating planet\nlocations is to be preferred, Kepler's or one of the alternatives to\nit? Newton's answer was not simple: “If the sun\nwere at rest and the remaining planets did not act upon one another,\ntheir orbits would be elliptical, having the sun in their common focus,\nand they would describe areas proportional to the times;” and the\naphelia and nodes would be stationary. The Keplerian system,\namended in the manner of Horrocks to infer mean distances from the\nperiods, is therefore the preferred approximation to the true\nmotions. The main loose-end in this answer was whether the\nactual motions do deviate from the Keplerian ideal, and if so, whether\nall the deviations could be attributed to specific forces,\ngravitational or otherwise. A further loose-end, addressed in\npart in Book 3, was whether the non-Keplerian motion of the Moon can be\nshown not to be a counterexample to Newton's argument in the case of\nthe planets. \n\n6. Is the motion of Jupiter and Saturn\naberrant and, if so, what are the inequalities in it and what causes\nthem? Newton answered yes, because they interact\ngravitationally, and the dominant inequality has a period corresponding\nto the 19 years between their consecutive conjunctions. (The\nsecond part of this answer did not appear in the first edition.)\nBy the early 1720s it had become clear that the dominant period in the\nanomalies of motion of these two planets is not that of the time\nbetween conjunctions, but something of much longer duration, giving\nrise to the questions of what the vagaries actually are and whether\nthey can truly be derived from Jupiter's and Saturn's gravitational\nforces. \n\n7. How, if at all, does the Earth's\nsurface gravity vary with latitude, and how, if at all, does the\nEarth's figure differ from a sphere? Newton's answer changes\nfrom the first to the second to the third edition, but in all cases\nvagaries in the cited data raise the question of what the actual\nvariations are. Also, because his idealized theoretical\ncalculation assumes uniform density, his answer raises the questions\nwhether the density of the Earth is uniform and whether the true figure\nof the Earth and variation of surface gravity can be reconciled with\nnon-uniformities in density. \n\n8. What precisely is the motion of the\nMoon, and what gives rise to the inequalities in it, inequalities not\nobserved in the motions of the satellites of Jupiter and\nSaturn? Newton's answer to the second part is the perturbing\neffect of the Sun's gravity, leaving the answer to the first in the\nform of a promissory note: work out all the perturbations from solar\ngravity, and you will have the answer. The major open question\nwas whether the complex motion of the line of apsides and the\ninequality known as the evection — the two features for which the\nHorrocksian cinematic model that Newton had employed in the Scholium to\nBook 3, Proposition 35 had resorted to an old-fashoined epicycle — can\nbe derived from the action of solar gravity. \n\n9. What causes the tides, and why do they\nvary in time as well as from place to place in the way they\ndo? Because Newton's answer — the gravitational action\nof the Sun and the Moon — was merely qualitative, it left room to\nquestion whether the Moon attracts the Earth and, if so, by how strong\na force. Also left open was the question of how the inertia and\nviscosity of the seas and the rotation of the Earth affect the tides, a\nquestion requiring a dynamic analysis of the motions of the seas in\nresponse to solar and lunar gravity. \n\n10. What physically produces the\nprecession of the equinoxes? Newton's derivation of the\nprecession from the gravitational action of the Moon and Sun raised\nthree unresolved questions: What are the correct values for the mass of\nthe Moon and the oblateness of the Earth? Is the resulting motion\nof the Earth really analogous to that of the lunar nodes? How\ndoes the varying inclination of the Moon affect the calculated\nmotion? \n\n11. What trajectories do comets\ndescribe? Newton's answer — conic-sections that can at\nleast be approximated by parabolas in the region in which they are\nobservable — gave weight to the question whether the parabolic\ntrajectory works for all comets, and not just the comet of 1680-81 in\nthe case of the first edition, the three others analyzed in the second,\nand the additional one in the third. The Principia also\nleft open questions about how the gravity of Jupiter and Saturn might\naffect comet motions, whether any significance should be attached to\nthe residual discrepancies between theory and observation in Newton's\nresults, and which, if any, comets do return in some regular\nfashion. \n\nCareful reading of the Principia makes clear that, although\nunforthcoming about any of the loose ends, Newton was perfectly aware\nof them all, in one way or another flagging each for the benefit of the\nhighly astute reader. An instructive way to present the history\nof eighteenth century research in the wake of the Principia is\nto trace how each of the loose ends became a prominent matter of\nconcern and was then resolved, at least to the point of being removed\nas in any way a threat to Newton's theory of gravity. This\nprocess of addressing the loose ends in Book 3 did not get underway\nuntil the 1730s, after Newton had died. During his lifetime the\nmost pressing complaint against the Principia was the absence\nof a mechanism to account for its action save for action at a distance,\nwhich Newton himself regarded as “so great an absurdity, that I\nbelieve no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of\nthinking can ever fall into\n it.”[56]\nThe absence of a mechanism, however,\nwas not something that Newton himself regarded as a loose-end in the\nPrincipia, for he insisted that all the conclusions listed\nabove could be established, and any loose ends in them resolved,\nthrough the law of universal gravity alone, independently of the\nmechanism responsible for it. Over the decades after he died,\nthose engaged in research predicated on his theory of gravity came\nincreasingly to this same view of the question of mechanism. \n\nIn two passages that remained word for word the same in all three\neditions Newton announced that the Principia was meant to\nillustrate a new approach to empirical inquiry. Neither the\nremark about deriving forces from phenomena of motion and then motions\nfrom these forces in the Preface to the first edition nor the remark\nabout comparing a generic mathematical theory of centripetal forces\nwith the phenomena in order to find out which conditions of force\nactually hold at the end of Book 1, Section 11, however, shed much\nlight on just what this new approach is supposed to be. Other\nthan these two passages, the only notable remark about methodology is\nthe famous passage, quoted earlier, from the General Scholium added in\nthe second edition as a final, parting statement: \n\nMuch of the discussion of the methodology of the Principia\nin the philosophical literature, from the eighteenth century down to\nthe present time, has taken this clearly polemical passage as the\nstarting point, generating unfortunately more heat than\n light.[57]\nThis is\nnot the place to grapple with all the controversies surrounding this\npassage. Some guarded comments about the methodology of the\nPrincipia may nevertheless prove helpful. \n\nIt is scarcely surprising that the unprecedented success of Newton's\ntheory of gravity stimulated interest in the methodology of the\nPrincipia. The obvious thought was to emulate this\nsuccess in other areas by following the same method. But then,\neven independently of questions about what the method was, one has to\nconsider exactly how it contributed to the success. Viewed in\nretrospect, Book 2 makes clear that this question has no simple\nanswer. If Newton followed the same method in Book 2, then the\nfailure of his effort on resistance forces — even worse, the failure\nthat he did not recognize — shows that the method was no guarantee of\nsuccess. The empirical world must cooperate for it to\nsucceed. \n\nTwo aspects of the general thrust of the method are perfectly\nclear. First, Newton viewed it as contrasting with what was then\ncalled the method of hypotheses — that is, the method of putting\nforward hypotheses that reached far beyond the available data and then\nmarshalling evidence for them by deducing testable conclusions\nfrom\n them.[58]\nSecond, Newton viewed the method as requiring that questions be\nregarded as open when empirical considerations had not yet yielded\nanswers to them. Whatever may have been required for empirical\nconsideration to establish a theoretical conclusion, and whatever the\nstatus, provisional or otherwise, any such established conclusion was\nsupposed to have, Newton viewed the method as allowing — even\nmandating — that theoretical answers to some questions could be\nestablished even while other closely related questions remained in\nabeyance. In particular, to use Newton's phrasing from the\nScholium that ends Section 11, the physical species and physical\nproportions of forces could, in the appropriate sense, be established\neven though the question of their physical causes remained open.\nThe clear aim of the method was accordingly to limit theoretical claims\nto “inductive generalizations,” as specified by the Rules of Reasoning,\nof conclusions dictated by experiment and observation. \n\nNewton's eschewing the method of hypotheses produced no controversy at\nthe time. In a manuscript revision of his “Essay on the causes of\ncelestial motions” Leibniz even adopted Newtonian phrasing: “What\nfollows is not based on hypotheses but is deduced from phenomena by the\nlaws of motion” [Aiton, 1972, 132]. A large fraction of those who had\nread at most small portions of the Principia and depended on\nothers for their knowledge of it most likely saw Newton as having\nhypothesized inverse-square attraction and hence as in fact following\nthe method of hypotheses. In the years after Newton died, the\nmost celebrated issues receiving concentrated research arose not from\nhow Newton had arrived at universal gravity, but from the claims he had\nderived from it concerning the figure of the Earth, the vagaries in the\nmotions of Jupiter and Saturn, and the motion of the Moon. The\nindividuals at the center of this research certainly saw these issues\nas a test of Newton's theory of gravity, but the distinction between\ntaking the theory as a hypothesis and taking it as a provisionally\nestablished conclusion was a distinction without much difference for\nthem. Still, it is worth noting that the conclusion Clairaut\nfirst drew from the factor of 2 discrepancy in the motion of the lunar\napogee was not that Newton's theory of gravity was false, but that the\ninverse-square needed to be supplemented by a 1/r4\nterm — a response fully in keeping with Newton's fourth rule of\nreasoning. \n\nThe aspect of Newton's method that did produce controversy at the time\nwas his insisting that he had established conclusions about the\nphysical species and physical proportions of celestial forces while\nholding questions about their physical causes in abeyance. This\nwas the core of the complaint by Cartesians that the Principia\nwas a work of mathematics, not physics. For Newton's two most\nimportant critics, however, Huygens and Leibniz, the objection was not\nto holding the question of physical causes open, but to accepting\ncertain conclusions that in their mind ruled out the very possibility\nof a proper answer to the question of physical cause. The defect\nin Newton's method lay in its not imposing the constraint on theory\nthat all action be through contact, and not at a distance. The\nviolation of this constraint lay behind Huygens's remarking, \n\nThis, then, was the truly controversial aspect of Newton's method in\nthe Principia with which the next generation had to come to\nsome accommodation before research on its loose ends could\nbecome\n respectable.[59] \n\nThe idea of developing a mathematical theory in order to enable\nexperiment and observation to provide theory-mediated answers to\nquestions did not originate with the Principia. In his\nHorologium Oscillatorium, the work the Principia most\nemulates, Huygens had developed a mathematical theory of pendulum\nmotion that enabled measurement of the length and period of pendulums\nto provide a robust precise answer to the question, how far does an\nobject fall in the absence of air resistance in the first second? —\nthe measure then of the strength of surface gravity; and he had\ndeveloped a mathematical theory of uniform circular motion that enabled\nmeasurement of the height and period of conical pendulums to provide a\nsecond answer to this question. By the time Newton started on the\nPrincipia pendulums had been used for more than a decade to\nanswer questions about how surface gravity varies between Paris and\nother locations. The special problem Newton saw himself as having\nto face in using mathematical theory to a comparable end in the\nPrincipia stemmed from his realization, expressed in the\n“Copernican scholium,” that the phenomena of orbital motions are\ninordinately complicated and hence open to multiple competing\ndescriptions. The problem thus became one of finding a way to use\nmathematical theory to draw definite robust answers to questions about\nthe physical species and proportions of forces from these\nphenomena. These answers opened the way to pursing the true\nmotions in a sequence of successive approximations, in the process of\nwhich continuing evidence could be brought to bear on the theory,\npotentially delimiting its exactness and its universal applicability in\nthe manner Newton had noted in his fourth rule of reasoning.\nBecause the “Copernican scholium” was unknown at the time, the\nsubtleties of the new method Newton followed to get around\nthis problem went largely unnoticed. \n\nNeedless to say, these comments do not answer the philosophically most\ninteresting question of how the method of the Principia\ncontributed to the unprecedented success of its theory of\ngravity. Hopefully, however, they do remove some sources of\nconfusion that have distorted so much of the philosophical discussion\nof the Principia.","contact.mail":"george.smith@tufts.edu","contact.domain":"tufts.edu"}]
