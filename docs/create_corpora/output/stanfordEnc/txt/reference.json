For instance, when I assert that\n“Barack Obama is a Democrat,” I use a particular sort of\nrepresentational token—i.e. the name ‘Barack\nObama’—which refers to a particular individual—i.e. \nBarack Obama. While names and other referential terms are\nhardly the only type of representational token capable of referring\n(consider, for instance, concepts, mental maps, and pictures),\nlinguistic tokens like these have long stood at the center of\nphilosophical inquiries into the nature of reference. Accordingly,\nthis entry will focus primarily on linguistic\n reference.[1]\n\n\nAssuming that at least some token linguistic expressions really do\nrefer, a number of interesting questions arise. How, for example, does\nlinguistic reference relate to the act of referring—something\nthat we as speakers do with referential terms? How exactly do\nreferential terms come to refer? That is, in virtue of what do they\nrefer to what they do? Is there a single answer to this question, a\nsingle mechanism of reference, or different answers depending on the\nsort of term in question? And what what exactly is the relationship\nbetween reference and meaning? Answers to these various questions will\nturn out to be closely related; the task of this entry will be to\ntrace out some of the main clusters of answers.\n\nWe use language to talk about the world. Much of what we say about the\nworld appears to be meaningful; some of it, presumably, is even true.\nFor instance, I seem to be saying something true when, in the\nappropriate sort of setting, I assertively utter: \nHow do we manage to do such things? How, for instance, do I manage to\ntalk about Barack Obama and thereby say meaningful and true things\nabout him? In a word: how do I refer to Barack Obama by means\nof the name ‘Barack Obama’? Metaphorically, we seem to be\ncapable of using language to talk about the world because some of our\nwords are themselves capable of ‘hooking onto’ things in\nthe world, things like Barack Obama. Proper names—that is,\nexpressions like ‘Barack Obama’ and ‘David\nCameron’—are widely regarded as paradigmatic referring\nexpressions. Although it may seem implausible to suppose that\nall words refer, that all words somehow ‘hook\nonto’ bits of reality, certain types of words are arguably of\nthe referring sort. These include: proper names, pronouns, indexicals,\ndemonstratives, plurals, natural kind terms, and various other sorts\nof property terms. Definite descriptions are another, though highly\ncontroversial, candidate. Here, we’ll focus on just a subset of \nthese—namely, what are often called ‘singular’\nreferential terms. These are terms that, supposing they refer, refer\nto particular objects and individuals as opposed to groups or\nproperties. Since singular referential terms have been subjected to\nintensive philosophical scrutiny over the past hundred years, this \nwill still leave us with plenty to discuss. \nThis article will focus on five central, related questions regarding\nreference: (i) How does the reference relation that obtains between\ntoken uses of terms and objects relate to the act of reference, the\nthing that speakers do with these terms? In other words, do\nterms refer to what they do in virtue of our using them to do so, or\ndo we use them to refer in virtue of their already doing so? \n(ii) What are the meanings of referential terms? Are they\njust referents, or rather something more? (iii) What is the\nmechanism of reference? In other words, in virtue of what\ndoes a token referential term attach to a particular\nobject/individual? (iv) Is there a single mechanism of reference\ncommon to all referring terms, or do different sorts of terms hook\nonto their referents in virtue of different sorts of things? And (v)\nto what extent, if at all, can reference depend on relatively private\nfeatures of the speaker, such as her intentions or other mental\nstates? \nOur goal here will be to map out how answers to these various\nquestions naturally cluster together into several distinct outlooks on\nreference, outlooks which drive a great deal of theorizing about\nparticular referential terms and phrases. To get there, we’ll start in\nSection 2 by looking at two of the main approaches to proper names.\nThen, in Section 3, we’ll turn to indexicals and demonstratives, which\nput pressure on the thought that these two approaches represent an\nexhaustive set of options. Section 4 will focus on definite\ndescriptions, which will serve to bring to the fore the question of\nhow the reference relation itself relates to the act of \nreference—a question which serves to highlight some potential\ndeficiencies in earlier models of linguistic reference. Section 5 will\nstep back to outline the main clusters of positions we will have\ndeveloped by that point. Finally, Section 6 wraps up by looking at the\nreasons that have been offered for doubting whether there is really\nany such thing as the reference relation at all. \nFor the sake of both clarity and brevity, this entry will refrain from\nventuring too deeply into the detailed debates regarding the meaning,\nsyntactic form, or function of the various terms we’ll be looking at.\nRather, we’ll focus instead on what, if anything, can be said about\nthe nature of linguistic reference in general. For a more detailed look\nat the idiosyncrasies of these various terms, please see the entries\non\n names,\n descriptions, and\n indexicals.\n See also the related entry on\n natural kinds, \nProper names have long taken center stage in debates about linguistic\nreference. For present purposes, we’ll treat these as roughly\nco-extensive with what ordinary (non-philosophically trained) speakers\nstandardly call ‘names’. So expressions like ‘Barack\nObama’, ‘Kyoto’, and ‘Mount Kilimanjaro’\nwill all count as proper names for our purposes. What do these\nexpressions have in common? In virtue of what do they constitute a\ngenuine class of linguistic expressions? At least at first\nglance, these would appear to be syntactically simple\nexpressions that refer, or at least purport to refer, to\nparticular objects or individuals. Thus, ‘Barack\nObama’ refers to a particular man, ‘Kyoto’ refers to\na particular city, and ‘Mount Kilimanjaro’ refers to a\nparticular mountain. And, even though it is questionable whether\nexpressions such as ‘Santa Claus’ and ‘Sherlock\nHolmes’ actually refer to anything, there can be no\ndoubt that they at least purport to refer: to Santa Claus and\nSherlock Holmes, respectively. They are thus to be counted as proper\nnames as well for present purposes. \nWith respect to proper names, there are two basic orientations that\nhave long captured philosophers’ attention: one that views names on\nthe model of tags, and another that views them on the model of\ndescriptions. We’ll briefly survey these two views, along with some\ncomplications that arise for each. Then we’ll turn to a problem that\narises for both sorts of view: explaining how reference works for\nnames with more than one bearer. \nAccording to descriptivist theories of proper names, a particular use\nof a proper name refers when the descriptive content somehow\nassociated with that use suffices to pick out a specific object or\nindividual. On one standard way of working out this sort of view, one\nassociated with both Gottlob Frege (1892) and Bertrand Russell (1911),\nsome particular descriptive content is associated with a given use of\na name because the speaker associates this content, in her\nmind, with the name in question. For the use of the name to refer,\nthis descriptive content must uniquely determine the name’s\nreferent. So when a speaker uses the name ‘N’\nand, in so doing, successfully refers to a particular object or\nindividual x, this sort of descriptivist claims (i) that the\nspeaker must be thinking of N as the (unique) F and\n(ii) that x must in fact be the (unique) F. In other\nwords, this sort of ‘classical’ descriptivist posits that\nreferential success hinges on speakers attaching to each name in their\nrepertoire some descriptive content F which uniquely singles\nout a specific object in the world. Conversely, when speakers fail\nto associate a sufficiently precise description with a name, this sort\nof descriptivist predicts that reference fails. \nClassical descriptivists, like Frege and Russell, were perfectly\nwilling to acknowledge that the descriptive content in question might\nvary—sometimes quite markedly—from one speaker to the\nnext. Indeed, according to Russell, such contents may vary across time\nfor one and the same speaker. Thus, while I might associate the name\n‘Obama’ with the descriptive content the previous U.S.\npresident, Michelle Obama might associate the same name with the\ndescriptive content my husband. If Trump were to assume\ndictatorial powers, my identifying content associated with Obama might\nwell change—perhaps to something like the last legitimate\npresident of the United States. If Barack and Michelle were to\ndivorce, Michelle’s identifying descriptive content would no doubt\nchange as well—perhaps to my ex-husband. In all of\nthese cases, the individual referred to by means of the name is\ndetermined (or, as it is often put, is ‘picked out’ or\n‘fixed’) by the particular descriptive content the speaker\nassociates with that name. Because the descriptive content in question\nis typically characterized by means of a definite description (an\nexpression of the form the F), such theories are often (even\nif somewhat\n misleadingly[2])\n known as ‘descriptivist theories’ of proper names. \nTo get the intuitive appeal of descriptivism more clearly in view,\nconsider a case where we know two individuals named ‘David\nCameron’—one of whom is a mutual friend and has never\nheld any elected office, the other of whom is the former Prime\nMinister of the United Kingdom. Suppose now that I assertively\nutter: \nIf for some reason you are confused about who I am talking about, the\nnatural thing for you to do is to ask me “Which David Cameron do\nyou mean?” I might then respond “The former Prime Minister\nof the U.K.,” and this seems to be dispositive of the facts\nhere. That is, supposing that this is the description I had in mind,\nthen it would seem that my utterance of (2) is genuinely\nabout David Cameron the former Prime Minister and not our\nmutual friend, the non-politician. Likewise, the truth or falsity of\n(2) would seem to hinge on how things are with the former Prime\nMinister and not on how things are with our mutual friend of the same\nname.  \nSome other appealing aspects of descriptivism become evident when we\npair the thesis considered above, a thesis about what determines\nreference, with a natural companion thesis to the effect that the\ndescriptive contents associated with uses of names also provide their\ntoken meanings. In other words, proper names may well refer, but they\nonly do so via their meanings—which are more like\ndefinite descriptions. By adopting this thesis, the descriptivist now\nhas ready explanations available for a range of philosophically\ninteresting cases. So, consider: \n(3) is true, but not knowable apriori. That said, if the\nmeanings of these two names is just whatever they refer to, we lack\nany obvious explanation for why (3) isn’t knowable apriori.\nAfter all, it just turns out to be an instance of the law of\nself-identify—something which very plausibly is\nknowable apriori. The meaning descriptivist, however, can say\nthat what (3) asserts is that two distinct descriptions are satisfied\nby the same object. Given what the relevant descriptions are likely to\nbe here, this won’t be something that can plausibly be known\napriori. (4) presents a different sort of challenge: if the\nname ‘Santa Claus’ fails to refer, then how can an\nutterance of this sentence count as meaningful? What, in other words,\nis such an utterance about? Again, the meaning descriptivist\nhas an easy answer here. What (4) means is something like there is\nsome unique bearded, jolly elf who lives at the North Pole.\nFinally, one might worry that if ‘Cicero’ and\n‘Tully’ just refer, and refer to the same thing, then it\nbecomes rather difficult to see how Fred could believe something about\nthe one but not about the other. But if Fred associates each name with\na different description, and if those descriptions are crucial to the\nmeaning of (5), then the problem simply dissolves. \nThe central challenge to the descriptivist theory is that there is\nreason to suspect that proper names are not semantically equivalent to\ndefinite descriptions. Saul Kripke (1972) argues, for example, that\nnames pick out the same object even when embedded under modal terms\nlike ‘might’, whereas definite descriptions typically\ndon’t do this. Returning to our earlier example of ‘David\nCameron’ and supposing that the description I associate with\nCameron is the British Prime Minister who called for a referendum\non Brexit, it seems that I can still truly assert: \nIf descriptivism is right about both meaning and reference, however,\nthen (6) should be equivalent to: \nGranted, (7) is not really a claim of ordinary English. Still, holding\nfixed that we are talking about metaphysical rather than\nepistemic possibility here, it should be clear enough that (7)\nis false: if there is someone who satisfies the description ‘the\nBritish Prime Minister who called for a referendum on Brexit’ in\nwhatever possible situation we are considering, then that individual\ncalled for a Brexit referendum in that possible situation. \nNow, in more ordinary English, there is a way of hearing something\nalong the lines of (7) as true: assuming that we are talking about the\nPrime Minister who  actually called for a referendum, of\ncourse he might not have. But that is not how definite descriptions\nare typically assumed to function; rather, they are typically\nunderstood to be flexible, or  non-rigid across the space of\npossibility, picking out whatever happens to satisfy them in whatever\npossible situation we are considering. So, if the descriptivist is to\navail herself of this sort of defensive maneuver, as some have been\ntempted to, then she will have to motivate the claim that names are\nsemantically equivalent not to definite descriptions per se,\nbut rather to ‘actualized’ or ‘rigidified’\nversions\n thereof.[3] \nThis challenge can be avoided by a descriptivist who is willing to\ngive up on the claim that what a proper name means, on a given occasion,\nis equivalent to a definite description. In that case, an associated\ndescription will fix reference relative to the actual world, and then\nthat referent is what relevant to determining the truth of modal\nstatements. This response, however, entails giving up on the nice\nexplanations of (3)–(5) that the more committal meaning\ndescriptivist was able to provide. What’s more, even this more minimal\nversion of descriptivism will run into another problem raised by\nKripke, what is often called the ‘semantic’ problem. \nThis problem runs as follows: often, we don’t associate enough\ninformation with a name to pick out any particular individual.\nNonetheless, we seem to be capable of using that name to refer to a\nspecific individual. Kripke offers as an example the name\n‘Feynman’. Most people, Kripke claims, will at best know\nthat Feynman was a physicist; they will not know anything, aside from\nthe name, that would serve to differentiate Feynman from any other\nphysicist they have heard of. The problem is that an indefinite\ndescription like a physicist will not suffice to pick out any\nparticular individual in the world. Even  a physicist named\n‘Feynman’ won’t do, at least in a world where two\nphysicists bear this name. At best, this sort of description\nwill pick out an arbitrary member of a class of individuals, not a\nparticular one. And yet, as Kripke points out, it seems perfectly\ncoherent for someone who knows nothing about Feynman, who has only\noverheard someone using the name, to say to herself “I wonder\nwho Feynman is,” or to ask her friend “Who is\nFeynman?” In each of these cases, the natural thing to say is\nthat the speaker is using the name ‘Feynman’ to wonder or\nask about Feynman. How she can manage to do so, however, looks to be\nsomething that is going to be very difficult for the descriptivist to\nexplain—assuming (i) that she  wants to maintain\nthe link between associated descriptions and the information available\nto an individual speaker, and (ii) that she is unwilling\nto rely on descriptions like whoever the person I overheard this\nname from was using it to talk about. \nBefore moving on to the Millian alternative, it is worth noting that\nsome descriptivists have indeed been tempted to defend the theory by \ngiving up on the link mentioned in (i). P.F. Strawson (1959), for instance,\nsuggests that speakers may rely on others to provide the relevant\ndescriptive content, the content that serves to hook a given use of a\nname onto an object or individual in the world. In fact, Strawson\nallows that groups can effectively use names to refer so long as there\nis a at least one expert among them for whom for whom the following holds:\nwhen we pool expert opinion, a plurality of the the descriptions\nthey associate with the relevant name are true of a single object. This\nwill effectively deal with Kripke’s Feynman case, but at an intuitive\ncost. For now the descriptivist has not only forfeited her ability to\nexplain (3)–(5), she has also risked making it the case that\nspeakers will have no special access to who they are talking about\nwhen using a name. If speakers regularly lack sufficient information\nto identify the referent of their use of a proper name, then it is\nhighly unclear why we would be justified in relying on them to answer\nquestions like “Which N were you talking about?”\nSome may be tempted to pay this price. Others may be tempted to try to\nintegrate bits and pieces of descriptivism even into theories which\nare otherwise anti-descriptivist. In fact, this latter option has\nproven a popular one, and much of what follows can be viewed as a study\nin how this strategy has played out with respect to different sorts of\nreferential terms. \nThe primary alternative to the descriptivist theory of names has\ntypically gone by the name of ‘Millianism’. According to\nthis view, which dates back to John Stuart Mill (1867), a name’s\nmeaning is simply its referent. In its modern form, the view was\nintroduced by Ruth Barcan Marcus (1961), who proposed that we ought to\nconceive of proper names as ‘tags’. To say that proper\nnames are tags is, for Marcus, to say that they have no linguistic\nmeaning beyond their reference. Proper\nnames do not, on this sort of view, refer by way of the descriptions\nthey allegedly stand for. Rather, they refer directly, as it\nis sometimes put, to their bearers. Important consequences of this\ntheory include, as Marcus notes, the necessity of identity statements\nbetween co-referring proper names—something which, though\nhighly intuitive, is not guaranteed by many descriptivist theories of\nproper\n names.[4]\n Other important consequences include the dissolution of puzzles\ninvolving substitutivity in modal contexts (Marcus 1993). \nOf course, saying that names function as tags—or that they are\n‘directly referential’—is not to provide a full\ntheory of names. That will require, at the very least, an explanation\nof what makes a name the particular tag that it is. In other words, we\nneed to specify what it is, if not an associated description,\nthat fixes what a name refers to in context. Put slightly differently,\nthe claim that names function as tags effectively furnishes us with a\nsemantics for names. What remains, is to provide a\nmetasemantics for names, a theory that tells us which\nsemantic value should be associated with each name, and why. \nThe most popular option has been to pair a Millian semantics with a\nmetasemantic picture adumbrated at roughly the same time by Peter\nGeach (1969), Keith Donnellan (1970), and the aforementioned Kripke\n(1972). Typically called the ‘causal theory of reference’,\nthe central idea developed in these works is that (the use of) a name\nrefers to whatever is linked to it in the appropriate way—a\nway that does not require speakers to associate any identifying\ndescriptive content whatsoever with the name. The causal theory is\ngenerally presented as having two components: one dealing with\nreference fixing, the other dealing with reference borrowing.\nReference, on this sort of view, is initially fixed via a dubbing. In\nother words, a language user gives a name to an object, by\nsaying something like “You’re to be called\n‘N’.” The standard case is supposed to be\none where the dubber is occurrently perceiving the target object when\nshe utters this. Then, after this initial act of reference-fixing, the\nname is passed on from speaker to speaker through communicative\nexchanges. Speakers succeed in referring to something by means of its\nname, on this sort of view, because underlying their uses of the name\nare links in a causal chain stretching back to the initial dubbing of\nthe object with that name. Subsequent speakers thus effectively\n‘borrow’ their reference from speakers earlier in the\nchain, though borrowers needn’t be able to identify any of the lenders\nthey are in fact relying on. All that is required is that borrowers\nare appropriately linked to their lenders through chains of\ncommunication, chains of passing on the name. \nAs Kripke points out, complications arise due to the fact that we can\napparently re-use names. So, I may have come across the name\n‘Napoleon’ via a chain of use leading back to the most\nfamous of French generals. Having heard the name, I may now decide to\ncall my cat, who likes to imperiously survey the domain of my\napartment, ‘Napoleon’. When I use the name in this way, my\nintentions make it the case, Kripke claims, that I have introduced a\nnew name, or at least a new use of the name. This is in spite of the\nfact that there is a very real sense in which I inherited the name\nfrom a historical tradition that traces back to 18th century France.\nThe take-home is this: not every sort of causal connection to previous\nuse is equal, according to the causal theorist. Some will help to fix\nreference, whereas others are irrelevant. And while it would certainly\nbe nice to have a complete theory of which of these is which, a\ndetailed account of all this has proven remarkably difficult to\n offer.[5] \nSo far, we’ve generally proceeded as though names were \nunivocal—that is, as if only one person or thing can bear a given name.\nBut that hardly seems right. As we already saw, a name like\n‘David Cameron’ would seem to apply equally well to the\nformer British Prime Minister and to anyone else who’s parents decided\nto call them this, regardless of their politics; likewise, once I’ve\nnamed my cat ‘Napoleon’, it would seem that the name\n‘Napoleon’ can be used equally well to talk about either\nthe greatest of French generals or, alternatively, my cat. Classical\ndescriptivists have no real trouble accounting for this, since each\ntime a name is used, its reference is essentially fixed anew by\nwhatever description the speaker happens to have in mind. In other\nwords, according to the descriptivist, it is really only a matter of\nhappenstance that uses of names ever co-refer. That might seem a\nrather large bullet to bite. On the other hand, once we move away from\nclassical descriptivism, explaining how names can refer to different\nindividuals in different circumstances becomes far more\nchallenging. \nConsider a descriptivist in the Strawsonian mold, one for whom an\nutterance of the name ‘N’ refers in accord with\nthe plurality of the beliefs of the relevant experts. What are we to\ndo with a name like ‘David Cameron’ then, which sometimes\nrefers to the former British Prime Minister and sometimes to our\nmutual friend? We cannot simply aggregate all the relevant beliefs\nassociated with this name, considered as an orthographic or\nphonological form, and then see who or what the plurality of those\nbeliefs picks out. For that would leave us only ever able to use the\nname to refer to one or the other of these David Camerons, and that\nhardly seems like the right thing to say. It seems, therefore, that a\ndescriptivist of this sort will have to think about names in some more\nfine-grained manner. Yet this will not prove easy. She cannot simply\ngo back to appealing to the information the speaker happens to have to\ndo the job—for we can easily imagine someone who has names for\nboth David Camerons in her vocabulary, and yet lacks sufficient\ninformation to distinguish the one from the other. \nSimilar issues arise for the Millian. Here, however, some concrete\nproposals have been floated. For instance, David Kaplan (1990) has\nargued that, against all appearances, names really do only have one\nreferent apiece. In fact, Kaplan suggests that we should think of\nnames as individuated, in part, by their referents. In other words, on\nKaplan’s view, one cannot simply ‘read off’ which name has\nbeen used from its overt phonological or orthographic form. Rather,\nKaplan posits that there are any number of names all written and\npronounced ‘David Cameron’. While each of these names is\nwritten and pronounced identically, each refers to a different person.\nThe question now becomes: what determines which name a\nspeaker has used in a given context? Kaplan suggests that the answer\nto this question has to do with the speaker’s mental states, and in\nparticular with the speaker’s intention to talk about one or another\nindividual. In effect, Kaplan takes it that hearing a name leaves us\nwith a mental trace, a mental analogue of a linguistic name, that\ndirectly refers to some particular individual. By looking to see who\nor what that trace refers to, we come to know the referential\nproperties of the utterance or inscription being used to express this\nmental trace. In a word, on Kaplan’s theory, names are first and\nforemost a mental phenomenon. We do, of course, use certain marks and\nsounds to externalize the mental traces, or mental names, that we\nacquire from each other in the course of things; linguistic names, in\nthe sense of something that will bear referential features, are\ntypes of uses of a particular phonological or orthographic\nform to externalize the use of a mental name to refer in thought. \nKaplan’s theory has some rather odd consequences, however. For\ninstance, it turns out that no two people actually ever share a \nname—for a name comes complete with its referential features.\nKaplan suggests that what people share are not names but rather some\ncommon aspects of how their names tend to be externalized. In other\nwords, for Kaplan, what it is to share a name with someone else is for\nboth of your names to belong to the same class of phonological and\northographic forms. Kaplan calls these ‘generic names’, as\nopposed to the ‘common currency names’ which, for him, are\nthe bearers of semantic properties like reference. \nFinding themselves dissatisfied with Kaplan’s proposal here, other\ndirect reference theorists have opted for different responses\nto the problem of names with multiple bearers. For instance, both\nFrancois Recanati (1997) and Michael Pelczar and Joe Rainsbury (1998)\nhave suggested that names ought to be treated on the model of\nindexicals, a sort of term that we will consider in more detail\nshortly. Briefly though, the suggestion runs: there is one and only\none name ‘David Cameron’, but context makes clear to which\nindividual a particular utterance of this name refers. In effect, the\nproposal preserves something of the causal theory—by allowing\nthat baptisms and passings-on of names are the right sort of thing to\ndetermine the set of possible referents associated with a name at any\ngiven time—while appealing to some further feature of the\ncontext to do the work of selecting an individual from this set. One\nlingering problem is that, in contrast to the pure indexicals like\n‘I’ or ‘here’, it is less than clear what\naspect of the context might serve to make this selection. Things get\nworse still once we consider contexts in which multiple people bearing\nthe same name are all present and being talked about in the course of\na single utterance (e.g. “David was Prime Minister, now retired\nin disgrace, whereas David is a plumber in good\n standing.”).[6]\n One possibility would be to posit that proper names function more\nlike the demonstratives ‘this’ and ‘that’ than\nthey do any of the pure indexicals. Alternatively, one might posit\nthat proper names themselves denote only the property of bearing the\nrelevant name, but that singular reference emerges when proper names\nare supplemented with a determiner like ‘that’ or\n‘the’ to form a determiner phrase like ‘that\nDavid’ or ‘the Michelle’ (see Burge (1973) and Graff\nFara (2015), respectively; see also the entry on\n names\n for more on such ‘predicativist’ views). In languages\nlike English, of course, these determiners would turn out to be mostly\nsilent. Still, one might take it that positing silent determiners is a\nprice worth paying for coherent story about the reference of names (or\ndefinite noun phrases containing names, as the case may be) that is\ncompatible with the claim that two individuals can genuinely share a\nname. \nAs should be clear, to better understand these last few proposals\nwe’ll first need to get clearer on how reference is supposed to work\nfor each of the various terms and phrases just appealed to: pure\nindexicals, impure indexicals, complex demonstratives, and definite\ndescriptions. Over the next few sections, we’ll work to fill in these\ngaps. \nWe’ve now seen two basic models of how words refer to things. On the\ndescriptivist model, words refer by being associated, somehow, with a\ndescription that serves to isolate a particular object as the\nreferent. Different versions of this model derive from different ways\nof associating the relevant descriptions with particular uses of\nwords. On the causal model, in contrast, words are associated with\nchains of use that lead back to some original act of dubbing. That act\nitself then serves to bridge the gap between word and world. While\nboth these models were developed with names in mind, we should ask\nourselves “Can either serve to explain linguistic reference\nin general? That is, can either model plausibly extend to\nother sorts of referential terms, beyond just names?” \nTo answer this question, and ultimately to introduce a third distinct\nmodel of linguistic reference, we turn now to the indexicals. That is,\nwe turn to terms like ‘I’, ‘you’,\n‘here’, ‘now’, ‘he’,\n‘she’, ‘this’, and ‘that’. As\nwe’ll soon see, it is hardly clear that all indexicals refer\nin the same way. In particular, a distinction has often been drawn\nbetween what are called ‘pure’ and ‘impure’\nindexicals, with rather different theories of reference being offered\nfor each. The challenges that arise in trying to offer accounts of the\nimpure indexicals will bring us full circle to one of the questions\nwith which we began: namely, do words refer because we use them to do\nso, or rather do we use them to do so because they already refer? \nWhat are pure indexicals? Roughly, they are expressions the reference\nof which appears to co-vary with certain very regular aspects of the\ncontexts in which they are used. Here, ‘context’ should be\nunderstood as incorporating, inter alia, a speaker, hearer,\ntime, and place. In contrast, the reference of ‘impure’\nindexicals is supposed to be more difficult to characterize in terms\nof picking out some distinct, repeatable feature of a context. While\nboth the existence and the significance of this distinction are\ncontroversial (see the entry on\n indexicals\n for further discussion; see also Radulescu (2018)), examples of each\nsort of term—should the distinction prove both real and\nsignificant—typically are not. Standard examples of pure\nindexicals include ‘I’, ‘here’,\n‘now’, and arguably ‘you’. The list of impure\nindexicals, on the other hand, is generally agreed to include\n‘this’, ‘that’, ‘he’,\n‘she’, and ‘it’. \nThe traditional approach to indexicals, dating back once more to Frege\nand Russell, has it that the reference of such expressions is fixed by\nsome sort of descriptive content associated by the speaker with the\nexpression. This reference-fixing description is the meaning of a\ngiven utterance of the expression. The motivation for such a view is\nlargely intuitive. Indexicals certainly do appear to mean something,\nand their meanings presumably have something to do with how these\nexpressions refer. For instance, the meaning of ‘I’ is\narguably the speaker of this utterance and refers to that\nindividual; the meaning of ‘now’ is arguably the time\nof this utterance and refers to that time. And so on.  \nOne obvious objection to this view is that what the term\n‘I’ refers to does not appear to be sensitive to whatever\nsort of descriptive content a speaker might happen to associate with\nthat term. For instance, the fact that I might happen to associate the\ndescription the previous U.S. president with the term\n‘I’ does not mean that I can somehow succeed in using the\nterm ‘I’ to refer to Barack Obama. Another problem with\nthis view, discussed extensively in Kaplan (1989b), is that taking\nthese reference-determining descriptions to be part of what we assert\nwhen we use indexicals can lead to our making some rather odd\npredictions. Consider an assertive utterance of:  \nSuppose, first, that I am the speaker. I utter (8). Now, suppose that\nyou are the speaker. You utter (8). While there may be a sense in\nwhich we ‘said the same thing’—that is, the sense\nin which we uttered the same sentence-type—there is another\nsense in which we clearly did not. We could also put this as: we\nasserted very different things. And yet, according to the classical\ndescriptivist, we’ve both asserted the very same thing. Namely, we’ve\nboth asserted that the speaker is hungry. All that differs is the\ncontext in which we asserted this. \nNow, to be clear, there are ways of tinkering with the view to avoid\nboth these objections. Some, like Hans Reichenbach (1947) or more\nrecently Manuel Garcia-Carpintero (1998) and John Perry (2001), have\nargued that indexicals are ‘token reflexives’, meaning\nthat the descriptions that should be associated with them will need to\ninvolve explicit reference to the utterance of that very token use of\nthe term. So, for instance, the description for ‘I’ might\nbe: the speaker of this very token of ‘I’. Since different\ntokens will be involved when each of us utters (8), we’ll no longer be\nasserting the very same thing. If we add that, for token indexicals at\nleast, the relevant descriptions aren’t under the speaker’s control,\nbut are rather associated with particular terms via the rules of\nlanguage, then we can avoid the former objection as well. \nA different sort of approach was developed by Reichenbach’s student,\nDavid Kaplan. Kaplan (1989b) took many of the same elements that\nReichenbach was working with, but put them into a direct reference\nframework where the meaning of an indexical in context—its\ncontribution to what is said or asserted—is just an object.\nAccording to Kaplan, we need to distinguish between two types of\nmeaning, which he called ‘character’ and\n‘content’. Content is basically what we have been calling\nmeaning to this point; it is what the utterance of an individual term\ncontributes to what is said or asserted by the utterance of a complete\nsentence of which it is a part. On direct reference theories, this is\nan object, thereby making the truth or falsity of what is said or\nasserted object-dependent. Character, on the other hand, is more akin\nto a rule of use; a character tells us, for any given context, what\nthe content of a given expression is. Names, on Kaplan’s way of\nthinking about them, have constant characters: in any two arbitrary\ncontexts, uses of the same name will be mapped to the same referent\n(recall that Kaplan thinks of names in a fine-grained way, such that they\nare never shared). The rule for any name ‘N’ thus\nturns out to be: in any context whatsoever, return N as the\nreferent. Not so for terms like ‘I’ or ‘here’,\nwhich Kaplan takes to be associated with rules like return the\nspeaker and  return the location of the utterance. So in\na context where I am speaking in Foyle’s, utterances of these\nindexicals will refer to me and to Foyle’s, respectively. When you are\nspeaking at the American Bar, they will refer to you and to the\nAmerican Bar. \nImportantly, the characters of the pure indexicals are supposed to be\ninsensitive to speakers’ mental states. That rules out any possibility\nof my using the term ‘I’ to refer to Barack Obama. Nor are\nyour and my utterances of (8) predicted to assert the same thing.\nWhat’s more, as Kaplan points out, the view allows us to productively\ndistinguish between ‘metaphysical’ necessity and what\nKaplan calls ‘logical’ necessity. The sentence “I am\nhere now,” Kaplan claims, represents a logical necessity: in\nvirtue of what the indexicals ‘I’, ‘here’, and\n‘now’ all mean, this sentence cannot be uttered falsely.\nYet clearly it is not necessary in any sort of metaphysical sense that\na particular speaker must be wherever she happens to be at the time of\nutterance; she could just as easily have been somewhere\n else.[7] \nNow we have three basic models of reference, of the metasemantics of\nreferential terms, on the table: the descriptivist model, the causal\nchain model, and the character model. With the last of these in view,\nwe can clarify an important aspect of the indexical theory of names\nthat was discussed at the end of the last section. Essentially, that\ntheory proposed to hybridize our second and third models. Instead of\nnames having constant characters, as Kaplan would have it, the\nproposal is to assign them more interesting ones. For instance, we\nmight try stipulating that the context, in addition to containing a\nspeaker, place, time, etc., must also include a most salient\nindividual bearing a given name. Names, the idea runs, always refer to\ntheir most salient bearer at a context. Since names no longer have\nconstant characters, they are more like indexicals than we might\ninitially have thought. On the other hand, we can preserve a good\namount of the causal theory by re-characterizing it as a theory about\nwho counts as a name-bearer in a given\n context.[8] \nThis way of developing the indexical theory is not without its\ndownsides, however. For instance, it hardly seems to be true that we\nalways use names to refer to the most salient bearer of that name in a\ncontext, particularly once we consider utterances of names prefixed\nwith phrases like ‘the other’ (e.g. “The other David\nis not here yet, though I can hear him down the hall.”). What’s\nmore, there is reason to worry that embracing this sort of indexical\ntheory entails giving up on one of the purported advantages of the\ncausal theory: its ability to explain how it is that we can pass on\nthe capacity to think about objects merely by passing on names for\nthose objects. Since names are causally anchored to the objects they\nname, according to the causal theory, acquiring a new name should\nsuffice to put us in causal contact with the object named. On the\nindexical theory of names, on the other hand, we do not pass on names\nfor things; rather, we use names to refer to the most salient bearer\nof that name in a given context. Perhaps this suffices to pass on a\nuse of a name—loaded, as it were, with a \nreferent—where the listener doesn’t already have that use in her\nrepertoire. But if the listener fails to have this use in her\nrepertoire, then it becomes hard to see how the referent of that use\ncould count as the most salient bearer of the relevant name in the\ncontext.  \nIn contrast to the pure indexicals, the reference of impure indexicals\nlike ‘he’, ‘she’, and ‘it’ or the\n‘true demonstratives’ like ‘this’ and\n‘that’ looks to be far less amenable to an analysis in\nterms of character. After all, what regular feature of a speech\ncontext might any of these terms serve to pick out? One option would\nbe to say that tokens of each of these simply refer to the\ndemonstratum of the context. But not only does that threaten to\nforce us to say that all of these terms effectively mean the same\nthing—something which seems rather counterintuitive—now \nwe also need to know what exactly serves to make something the\ndemonstratum in a context. And what are we to do when multiple such\nterms, or multiple instances of the same term, are used within the\nspan of a single utterance? Are we really to believe that contexts\ninvolve not just a demonstratum role, but also a first\ndemonstratum role, a second demonstratum role,\netc.? \nSeveral possible responses arise at this point. First, we might try to\ntake advantage of the fact that many uses of these terms are\naccompanied by ostensive gestures. So perhaps, as Kaplan (1978) and\nMcGinn (1981) both suggest, it is such gestures that serve to make\nobjects the demonstrata of contexts—one per use of an impure\nindexical. This suggestion also gives us a rather natural way of\nunderstanding what makes something the first demonstratum as opposed\nto the second, and so on. On the other hand, this approach faces a\nrather obvious objection: many perfectly good uses of impure\nindexicals and demonstratives simply aren’t accompanied by any sort of\nostensive gesture. That observation leads to a second possible\nresponse, one which is in many ways a generalization of this first:\nperhaps it is not the ostensive gesture itself that makes an object\nthe demonstratum, but rather what that gesture does. Gestures, we\nmight take it, serve to make objects salient in a context. So perhaps\nwhat matters is just that an object be particularly salient in a\ncontext; perhaps this is what serves to make it the demonstratum,\nwhether or not that salience is the direct result of an ostensive\ngesture. \nHoward Wettstein (1984) develops a view along these lines, and this\nsame sort of view has more recently been fleshed-out and defended by\nAllyson Mount (2008). The basic idea is that a term like\n‘she’ refers to whoever counts as the most salient\nfemale in the context. Similar rules will apply to the other\nimpure indexicals. Problems start to arise, however, once we consider\nbare uses of ‘this’ and ‘that’—which\ndon’t seem to contain any substantial information about the relevant\nsortal. While it might seem plausible enough that some object will\ncount as the maximally salient female in a context, it seems far less\nplausible that contexts will contain maximally salient objects\nsimpliciter, or without further qualification. What might\nserve to make an object maximally salient simpliciter? The\nnatural suggestion would seem to be: our interests. If anything is\ngoing to make an object maximally salient simpliciter, it’s\npresumably going to be that we, as agents, have brought a certain set\nof interests to the conversational exchange.  \nDialectically though,\nthis suggestion is problematic. For one thing, the interests of the\nspeaker and listener can easily diverge. So we need to know whose\ninterests, if either, trumps when those interests fail to align.\nOtherwise, all that we can say is that a certain object is maximally\nsalient relative to both a context and a particular agent—but\nnot relative to a context itself, without further qualification. Mount\nspecifies that what we are interested in is mutual maximal\nsalience. But this threatens to make a great many uses of the\nimpure indexicals fail to refer when the speaker and listener’s\ninterests diverge. What’s more, as Mount herself notes, the view\nentails that reference fails in almost any instance where the listener\nhappens not to be paying attention to the speaker’s utterance. Other\nways of precisifying the view face analogous worries, seemingly\nhanding too much control to either the speaker or the listener. \nThis brings us to a third possibility for how the impure indexicals\nrefer: perhaps, as Kaplan (1989a) suggests, token uses of the impure\nindexicals, like demonstratives and deictic uses of pronouns, refer to\nwhoever or whatever the speaker intends for them to refer to. Kaplan\nsees some continuity here with his earlier pointing-based approach,\nsince he takes it that such intentions (what he calls ‘directing\nintentions’) might well be thought of as the internal analogue\nof an externalized pointing. Still, the suggestion is more durable\nthan this earlier one; no explicit gesture is necessary for reference\nto succeed. Indeed, not only can we now account for uses of impure\nindexicals with no accompanying ostensive gesture, this sort of\nintentionalist theory can also allow for uses of impure indexicals to\nrefer to objects that aren’t physically present in the context—as \nthere is no block to speakers having intentions directed at such\nobjects. Since we do indeed use impure indexicals to refer to\nphysically and temporally distant objects, this looks like a\nsignificant advantage for Kaplan’s ‘intentionalist’ theory\nof reference. \nNone of this is to say that Kaplan’s view has been universally\nembraced. On the contrary, the view has often been thought to face a\nrather serious problem. We noted above that terms like the bare\ndemonstratives ‘this’ and ‘that’ look to be\nrather flexible in their application. Yet even these terms are not\ninfinitely flexible. Presumably, you cannot point directly\nand deliberately at a picture of David Cameron, utter (9), and succeed\nin referring to the picture of David Kaplan that you have tucked away\nin your desk drawer for just such occasions: \nThis is an instance of what has sometimes been called the\n‘Humpty Dumpty\n Problem’.[9]\n Basically, any time we might be tempted to suggest that what token\nuses of some particular term mean or refer to depends on the speaker’s\nintentions, the following sort of problem inevitably arises: unless we\nimpose some constraints on what those intentions can look like, then\nwe’ll end up with seemingly absurd results, results like that the\ntoken use of ‘that’ in (9) really does refer to the\npicture of Kaplan you have tucked away in your desk. \nA slightly more complicated case, confusingly from an earlier\ntime-slice of Kaplan (i.e. Kaplan 1978) and used to help motivate the\npointing theory, can be used to make much the same point. Kaplan asks\nus to imagine a scenario where the speaker is sitting at her desk and\nher prized picture of Rudolf Carnap, which typically hangs on the wall\nbehind her, has been switched for a picture of Spiro Agnew. Failing to\nnotice the switch, and intending to use the term ‘that’ to\nrefer to her picture of Carnap, the speaker points behind herself,\ndirectly at the picture of Agnew, and utters (10): \nOn Kaplan’s telling of things, (10) is false not in virtue of\nreference failing here. Rather, it is false in virtue of the speaker’s\nhaving asserted something false of the actual picture hanging behind\nher, the picture of Agnew. Most philosophers have been inclined to\nagree about this (see King (2013) for an exception, however).\nImportantly, this case is slightly different from our (9) in that it\ndoesn’t seem altogether implausible that the speaker here might\nalso intend for her use of ‘that’ to refer to\nwhatever picture is hanging behind her. After all, she is somehow\nconfused about what picture that is. This confusion might, therefore,\ngive the intentionalist some additional room to maneuver. \nOne possibility would be for the intentionalist to dispute the\nabove judgments and embrace the claim that the token uses of\n‘that’ in (9) and (10) do in fact refer to the pictures of\nKaplan and Carnap, respectively (see Radulescu (forthcoming) for a\nresponse along these\n lines).\n Most intentionalists have not gone down this route, however. Instead,\nthey have either tried to restrict the range of intentions that count\nas properly ‘referential’, or else they have tried to\nimpose certain limitations on when speakers’ intentions in fact\ndetermine reference. This first strategy has generally proceeded by\nappealing to certain considerations drawn from Paul Grice’s (1957)\ntheory of meaning. The second, in contrast, has tended to try to\nderive the relevant constraints from the standing meanings of, or\nrules of use for, the impure indexicals and demonstratives. More\nrecently, some philosophers have also tried combining these two\napproaches. \nThe Gricean approach to reference was first clearly articulated by\nGail Stine (1978)—though it had been alluded to by both Grice\nhimself and Keith Donnellan\n (1968).[10]\n The basic idea is that the relevant sorts of intentions for fixing\nthe reference of impure indexicals are, properly speaking, intentions\naimed at getting the listener to identify a particular object as the\nreferent. In keeping with Grice’s broader theory of meaning, these\nintentions are posited to be even more complicated than just this: not\nonly are they aimed at getting the listener to identify some object as\nthe referent, they are also meant to be fulfilled in part on the basis\nof the listener’s recognizing that this is how she is intended to\nact. \nHaving followed the Gricean line this far, now we need to ask: can the\nGricean thesis regarding the complexity of referential intentions\nsomehow cut off the threat of a collapse into Humpty Dumpty-ism? The\nanswer, according to the Gricean, is “Yes.” More\nprecisely, the Gricean will claim that the speaker lacks a\ngenuinely referential intention in a case like (9), since she\nshould have no expectation that her listener will be in a position to\nrecover her intended referent. In a case like (10), however, she\ndoes look to have an intention for her listener to recover\nthe picture of Carnap as the referent. So how is the Gricean in any\nposition to help here? As Bach (1992) helpfully clarifies, the Gricean\nline really ought to run as follows: while genuinely referential, the\nspeaker’s intention to refer to the picture of Carnap runs\nvia an intention to refer to whatever picture happens to be\nbehind her. That latter intention is meant to be recognized directly,\nwhereas the former can only be recognized indirectly, via the\nrecognition of both this latter intention and (in the good case) the\nfact that the picture behind the speaker actually is the picture of\nCarnap. So a better way of formulating the Gricean thesis when it\ncomes to reference is in terms of a primary/secondary distinction that\nreflects this sort of asymmetry: when there is a conflict between a\nprimary and secondary referential intention, and both are genuinely\nreferential, it is the primary one that serves to fix\n reference.[11] \nSo far, so good for the Gricean. But just how general is her solution\nto the Humpty Dumpty Problem? Can she, for instance, account for a\nspeaker who appears to be fully competent in a language like English,\nbut who mistakenly believes that everyone else can simply read off \nher referential intentions, directly? In other\nwords, consider a speaker who believes that her listener can read her\nmind regarding her referential intentions, though nothing else, and\nonly when she actually utters a demonstrative. Unless we rule out such\na speaker as broadly incompetent in speaking English, it would seem\nthat she can now succeed, according to the Gricean, in making a token\nof ‘this’ or ‘that’ refer to whatever she\nlikes, on any occasion whatsoever. For this speaker can coherently\nintend for her listener to recover that object as the referent of her\nuse of the demonstrative, partly in virtue of recognizing this very\nintention, and regardless of what that object is. In other words,\ngiven some strange enough background beliefs, the Gricean predicts that a\nspeaker really can make a use of ‘that’ in an\nutterance like (9) refer to her picture of David Kaplan—regardless \nof whether anyone short of a real clairvoyant would ever be\ncapable of recovering this referent. So the Gricean strategy to block\nintentionalism’s collapse into Humpty Dumpty-ism won’t fully\ngeneralize. \nPartly in response to worries like these, we might think that the\nright sort of response to the Humpty Dumpty Problem is not to up the\ncomplexity of referential intentions themselves, but rather to impose\nlimits on how particular sorts of terms—even the true\ndemonstratives—can be used to refer. Marga Reimer (1991, 1992)\noffers a suggestion along just these lines: when uses of the demonstratives\n‘this’ and ‘that’ are accompanied by ostensive\ngestures, then the referent itself must lie in the general direction\nindicated by that\n gesture.[12]\n When there is no gesture, then there is no such constraint. In other\nwords, Reimer re-emphasizes the apparently special connection between\ndemonstratives and gestures that earlier theorists tried to leverage\ninto a full theory of demonstrative-reference. This time, however,\nReimer suggests that we use this connection not to generate a complete\ntheory of demonstrative reference, but rather to impose some\nconstraints on the intentionalist theory. Those constraints, in turn,\nare what allows Reimer to make the intuitively correct predictions\nregarding (9) and (10): with respect to (9), she will say that one\ncannot succeed at pointing to one picture and referring to another\npicture, unless perhaps the first is a photograph of the second; with\n(10), she will say that the speaker intends both to refer to\nthe picture behind herself and to that of Carnap, but only one of\nthese satisfies the constraint associated with the gesture. Thus, only\none of these intentions is in a position to determine reference. \nTo be clear, Reimer’s position is by no means incompatible with the\nGricean theory of referential intentions. One might, in fact, accept\nboth that there are substantive constraints on reference that derive\nfrom the meanings of the impure indexicals themselves, and also that\nreferential intentions are as the Gricean describes them to be. Bach\n(2017) has recently embraced such a view, for instance. That said, one\nshould demand an independent reason for adopting the Gricean thesis.\nFor it would seem that one can prevent a collapse into Humpty\nDumpty-ism simply by accepting that there are constraints on reference\nconventionally associated with particular impure indexicals; one thus\nno longer needs the Gricean thesis to rein in the scope of referential\nintentions. Still, it is perfectly reasonable to think that there are\ngoing to be plenty of more general theoretical reasons to prefer the\ncombination of these theories to a pure constraint-type approach like\nReimer’s. \nIn contrast to the sorts of terms we have considered so far, the\nprimary question regarding definite descriptions—complex\nexpressions like ‘the biscuit’ or ‘the\noff-license’—is not how they refer, but whether they\nrefer at all. \nBoth Meinong (1904) and Frege (1892) thought that they did. That left\nthem with a problem, however, since the overt descriptive material\nfound in definite descriptions is typically insufficient to identify a\nsingle object as the referent. For Frege, at least, there was a fairly\nobvious solution: treat that overt descriptive material as just a part\nof the sense of the definite description, allowing more material to be\nadded by whatever fuller description the speaker happens to have in\nmind. Faced with this same set of issues, Russell (1905) took the\nopposite tack: he posited that descriptions simply do not refer.\nRather, what he offered was a translation procedure for sentences of\nthe form ‘The A is B’, which he posited to mean: there is\none and only one A, and that A is also\n B.[13] \nThis dispute becomes even more interesting when one considers that\nboth Russell and Frege agreed that names were to be\nunderstood as, in some sense, akin to definite descriptions. Now we\nare in a better position to see the deep differences between them, in\nspite of this superficial agreement. For Frege, that claim in no way\nprevented names from being genuine devices of reference. For Russell,\nit did. For Frege, a name’s contribution to the truth or falsity of a\nsentence was (intensional contexts to the side) its referent. For\nRussell, it was the associated description. \nWhy suppose that definite descriptions fail to refer? After all, we\ncertainly seem to use them to talk about particular objects;\nwhen I say “I want the sloop to the right of that one,” I\nseem to be expressing a desire to possess a particular sloop, not just\na desire to be relieved from slooplessness in some complicated\nfashion. What’s more, we can substitute definite descriptions for\nnames and indexicals in most linguistic contexts. Naively then, it\nmight seem reasonable to posit that, if names and indexicals refer,\nthen so too do token definite descriptions. Russell, however, did not\nlack for motivation in his claim that definite descriptions fail to\nrefer. Consider assertive utterances of the following sentences: \n(11) is meaningful, and certainly not true. Russell takes it to be\nplainly false, though that is controversial (see Strawson (1950) and,\nmore recently, Von Fintel (2004)). Regardless, if one thinks that\ndefinite descriptions are devices of reference, then it’s unclear how\none will be justified in claiming that sentences like (11) are\nmeaningful. After all, the description clearly doesn’t refer. With\n(12), the problem facing the referentialist is different: since both\nthese descriptions should refer to the same individual, Mary Ann Evans\n(or ‘George Eliot’), it becomes highly unclear why (12)\nshouldn’t be knowable apriori. As with identity statements\ninvolving co-referring names, this looks to be merely an instance of\nthe law of self-identity. \nNote that Russell’s theory, in contrast, has no difficulty explaining\nany of this. (11) just makes a claim about there being a unique king\nof France, a claim which is both perfectly meaningful and\nstraightforwardly false. (12), on the other hand, makes a claim about\nthe unique satisfier of one set of properties also uniquely satisfying\nanother set of properties. That should hardly ever count as knowable\napriori. \nStill, there are also reasons to question Russell’s claim that\ndefinite descriptions fail to refer. For instance, as Strawson (1950)\npointed out, many assertive utterances involving definite descriptions\nwill seem true even when the relevant description fails to have a\nunique satisfier. So, consider: \nAssertively uttered in a context where there is a single table stacked\nhigh with books, (13) would seem to be true. Yet Russell predicts the\nopposite, so long as there is at least one additional table somewhere\nor other in the universe. Strawson’s alternative was to claim that\nthere are genuinely referential uses of definite\ndescriptions. Used in this way, definite descriptions will, like names\nand indexicals, contribute an object or individual to the content\nasserted by the utterance—so long, that is, as that object\nsatisfies the relevant descriptive material. Otherwise, such tokens\nwill still count as meaningful in virtue of being associated with\ncoherent rules of use, but they will fail to refer. That, Strawson\nclaims, means that the assertive utterances of which they are a part\nwill fail to be either true or false. The contrasting category here is\nof a attributive use of a definite description, which is\nsupposed to function more or less as Russell suggested. \nKeith Donnellan (1966) went even further than Strawson, claiming that\ndefinite descriptions can be used to refer even when the putative\nreferent fails to satisfy the descriptive material explicit in the\ndescription itself. In what is probably his most famous example,\nDonnellan asks us to consider an utterance of the following: \nSuppose that we are both looking at a man who appears to be drinking a\nmartini, but is in fact drinking water, when you utter (14). On\nDonnellan’s telling, this is irrelevant; the token description\n‘the man drinking the martini’ can refer to this man in\nour visual field regardless of whether he is in fact drinking a\nmartini. What matters, according to Donnellan, is just that you\nhave this man ‘in mind’ when using the relevant\ndescription, that you use the description with this man as your\nintended target. \nOne might worry, as did Alfred MacKay (1968), that this means that\nDonnellan is open to the charge of offering a Humpty Dumpty view of\ndefinite descriptions—one on which there are no substantive\nconstraints on what token descriptions can be used to refer to.\nInterestingly, Donnellan (1968)’s response was to appeal to the\nGricean theory of meaning, thus raising the possibility that what he\nmeant by ‘having in mind’ is something akin to the\nGricean’s notion of having a referential intention. As we saw above,\nhowever, there is reason to think that even this sort of move won’t\nsuffice to head off the collapse of intentionalism into Humpty\nDumpty-ism in a fully general sense. So there is still reason to be\nconcerned that Donnellan’s willingness to jettison the explicit\ndescriptive material as a constraint on referential success is perhaps\na bridge too far. \nBut what of the intuitions behind Donnellan’s example? For, even if we\nreject his claim that a description like ‘the F’\ncan be used to refer to something that isn’t an F, it still\nseems as though communication is possible in a case like (14). That\nis, I should be able to tell who you’re asking about regardless of\nwhether I know that this man is drinking a water rather than a\nmartini. Kripke (1977) suggested that the way to deal with cases like\nthese is to view the sort of reference involved as merely pragmatic,\nas having to do with communicative efficacy rather than with the sort\nof strict aboutness relevant to determining truth or falsity in a\ncontext. According to Kripke, there is no need to posit that definite\ndescriptions ever refer; instead, we can explain away their\napparent referential properties by noting that, even if they do not\nrefer, speakers will typically have targets in mind for them to latch\nonto nonetheless. So long as we are reasonably good at recovering\nthose targets, we can use them to direct each other’s thought to\nparticular objects without needing to posit that token instances of\nthese expressions themselves ever manage to lock onto those objects\nand individuals. In other words, we are free to accept the Russellian\ntheory of descriptions, supplemented with this claim that descriptions\nare very often used to direct listeners’ attention to the\n‘speaker’s referent’, as Kripke called what he took to be\nthe referential analogue of Gricean ‘speaker’s meaning’\n(or, roughly, whatever the speaker is trying to get across to the\nlistener, literally or otherwise). \nKripke seems to have in mind that genuine linguistic reference—or\nwhat he calls ‘semantic reference’—needs to run\npurely via convention. His paradigm example is names, which he takes\nto be associated with a convention to the effect that their reference\nis fixed via an appeal to causal chains. Alternatively, he might have\npointed to Kaplan’s character-based approach to the pure indexicals, a\nview which is equally reliant on conventions to establish reference.\nAs we saw above, however, there are plausibly limits to\nthis sort of approach: a conventionalist approach to the reference of\nimpure indexicals, like demonstratives and pronouns, has not been\nforthcoming. Likewise, once we take seriously the problem of names\nwith multiple bearers, it becomes far less clear that the reference of\ntoken uses of names can be fixed by anything so simple as a linguistic\nconvention. Rather, in both cases, it looks like it is going to be\nrather tempting to appeal to facts about the speaker in order to fix\nlinguistic reference. But if that is acceptable there, the case for\nruling out definite descriptions as non-referring starts to look much\nweaker.  \nIf, unlike Kripke, we start with the idea that linguistic\nreference is, at root, the result of an act, of something that\nwe do rather than something that words themselves do, then\ndefinite descriptions start to look more like the normal case and\nindexicals like the outlier. This is, in fact, an old idea, one that\ndates back to Susan Stebbing (1943) and the later work of Ludwig\nWittgenstein (1958), and which we already saw running through the\nideas of Grice, Strawson, and\n Donnellan.[14]\n The enduring worry, of course, is that without some restrictions on\nhow we can use terms to successfully refer, we will divorce the theory\nof reference from both our intuitions on cases and from any role in an\noverall theory of communication. But if we embrace certain limits on\nreferential success—to be imposed by either Gricean\nreflexivity, conventionalized constraints, or both—these\nworries can plausibly be avoided. And, indeed, with respect to\ndefinite descriptions the case for there being a conventionalized\nconstraint on referential success, as Strawson took there to be, can\nlook particularly appealing. \nMore recently, a different sort of challenge has emerged for those\nclaiming that token definite descriptions sometimes refer: namely, the\ndifference in meaning which is standardly assumed to mark definite\ndescriptions off from their indefinite cousins (that is, descriptions\nlike ‘a philosopher’ as opposed to ‘the\nphilosopher’) has itself been called into question. Two main\nreasons have been offered for rejecting a difference in meaning\nbetween these sorts of phrases. First, pinning down exactly what this\ndistinction is supposed to amount to has proven remarkably difficult;\nevery aspect of Russell’s original analysis, for instance, has\nsubsequently been cast into doubt. Second, a great many\nlanguages turn out to lack anything like the definite/indefinite distinction. This\nraises the possibility that this distinction is a far less\nsignificant, and less well-defined, feature of meaning, even in a\nlanguage like English, than it is usually taken to be (see Ludlow and\nSegal (2004); see also Abbott (2008) for counterarguments and the\nentry on\n descriptions\n for extensive discussion along with further references). \nHow would rejecting the definite/indefinite distinction affect debates\non whether token definite descriptions sometimes refer? Well, if it\nwere clear that indefinite descriptions could not be used to refer,\nand if these were indeed semantically equivalent to definite\ndescriptions, then we would have additional reason to think that\ndefinite descriptions cannot be used to refer either. On the other\nhand, some have argued that indefinite descriptions can refer,\nthough these arguments are highly controversial (see Chastain (1975)\nand Fodor and Sag (1982); again, see the entry on\n descriptions\n for further discussion and references). Even if we were to reject\nsuch a view, advocates of the unitary theory still typically grant\nthat there is a pragmatic difference marked by the use of\n‘the’ as opposed to ‘a’. So it would be open\nto the stalwart defender of the view that token definite descriptions\nsometimes refer to try to argue that such pragmatic markers can play a\nsignificant role in regulating the use of descriptions to \nrefer—despite these markers being nowhere reflected in meaning at\nthe level of what is said or asserted. Obviously, none of this will be\nsettled here. \nBy looking at how philosophers have attempted to account for the\nreferential features of various sorts of linguistic terms, we have\neffectively introduced four distinct ways of conceiving of how\nreferential terms might come to refer to particular objects and\nindividuals in the world. In other words, we have introduced four\ndistinct models for the metasemantics of referential terms:  \n1. On the descriptivist model, words refer in virtue of being\nassociated with a specific descriptive content that serves to identify\na particular object or individual as the referent. \n2. On the causal model, words refer in virtue of being associated with\nchains of use leading back to an initiating use or\n‘baptism’ of the referent. \n3. On the character model, words refer in virtue of being associated\nwith regular rules of reference. Paradigm rules of this sort will\nthemselves allude to repeatable elements of the context,\nidentifying which of these elements is the referent for which sort of\nterm. \n4. On the intentionalist model, words refer in virtue of being used,\nintentionally, to refer to particular objects. In other words, words\nrefer in virtue of their being uttered as part of complex intentional\nacts which somehow target particular objects or individuals. \nAs should be clear by now, these four models aren’t strictly exclusive\nof each other. One might, for instance, think of the classical\ndescriptivism—which appeals to the speaker’s mental state in\norder to associate a particular description with a particular token\nreferential term—as a particular version of intentionalism.\nPresumably, speakers will only manifest the right sort of mental state\nwhen they are intentionally using a referential term to refer.\nLikewise, one might view the causal theory as a special case of the\ncharacter theory: in the case of terms like names, the invariant rule\nof use associated with a particular name is itself to be explained in\nterms of a chain of uses leading back to a specific object or\nindividual. In fact, if one is willing to allow the characters of\ncertain sorts of terms, like the demonstratives, to allude to the\nspeaker’s referential intentions, then character theorists can\ncountenance a certain sort of intentionalism within the scope of their\ntheory as well. In doing so, however, it is unclear what remains of\nthe original character model, with its reliance on \npublicly-identifiable aspects of the context as the primary driver of\nthe rules of reference. \nIt’s worth noting some clear divisions among these options. First,\nthere is a divide between views according to which referential terms\nthemselves refer, and that we thus use them to refer because they\nalready do so, and views according to which it is us who do\nthe referring, with token linguistic reference following only\nderivatively. The causal theory and certain non-classical versions of\ndescriptivism are paradigm instances of the former sort of view,\nwhereas the intentionalist model is a paradigm instance of the \nlatter—along with the classical descriptivism of Frege and Russell.\nDue to its inherent flexibility, the character model is harder to\nplace along this spectrum. Kaplan’s rules for the true indexicals seem\nto straddle this divide: indexical tokens acquire their reference\nbecause they are uttered in a particular context, presumably\nintentionally. But they acquire their reference independently of\nanything having to do with the speaker’s mental state. If we extend the character\ntheory to include both intention-dependent characters for\ndemonstratives and constant, context-invariant characters for names,\nthen things become more complicated still. In that case, the character\ntheory starts to look pluralistic with respect to this division; some\nreferential terms acquire their reference in virtue of our using them\nto refer, whereas we use other such terms to refer in virtue of their\nantecedently referring. \nA second important divide has to do with the extent to which reference\nis allowed to depend on potentially idiosyncratic and relatively\ninaccessible aspects of the speaker’s mental state. As we saw above,\nboth classical descriptivists and intentionalists allow for a strong\ndependence on the speaker’s mental states, and this can lead to some\nodd predictions regarding reference. Griceans and constraint-type\ntheorists like Reimer have offered ways of trying to minimize these\nresults, but one might also worry that allowing reference to depend on\nthe speaker’s mental state at all undercuts our ability to explain how\nwe use referential terms to coordinate our object-directed thoughts\nwith each other—in other words, to communicate. On the causal\nmodel, for instance, we literally give each other ways of thinking\nabout the same object by passing on a name. That makes explaining\ncommunication rather straightforward, supposing, that is, that we are\nconsistently able to recognize which name has been uttered on a given\noccasion. The problem of names with multiple bearers means that this\nmight turn out to be non-trivial; but at least the payoff looks\nsignificant. Alternatively, on the Kaplanian theory of true\nindexicals, we can explain our ability to coordinate our thought on\nparticular places, times, and individuals in virtue of the fact that\nthe place, time, and speaker of the utterance are things that are\ntypically public knowledge, equally available to every member of the\nconversation. The question is whether such an analysis is available\nfor terms like the impure indexicals. \nThird, and finally, there is an important divide between models of\nreference which are expansive as opposed to narrow.\nIn their broadest forms, both intentionalism and descriptivism are\nexpansive; they purport to apply equally well to any sort of\nreferential term whatsoever. The causal model is a narrow model of\nreference; it has only ever been purported to apply to the reference\nof names. Once more, the character model proves difficult to place;\njust how broad or narrow it proves will depend on just how far we are\nwilling to stray in our theorizing from the paradigm case of the true\nindexicals. Expansive theories hold out the promise of offering a\nsubstantive account of the reference relation. That is, expansive\ntheorists can claim that the reason that token uses of referential\nterms play a certain sort of role in explaining the the truth or \nfalsity of an utterance is that a\ncertain sort of substantive relation obtains between that token use\nand some object in the world. Narrow theorists, in contrast, will have\nto allow that there are different sorts of relations that serve to fix\nreference for different sorts of referential terms, and even perhaps\ndifferent uses of the same term. Thus, they will have to say that what\nunifies referential terms is not that, when they succeed in referring,\na particular sort of relation obtains between that token use and some\nobject or individual, but rather that they play some particular\nfunctional role in determining the truth-conditions or assertive\ncontent of an utterance. In other words, standing behind debates over\nwhich of these models we should adopt is a much larger, and as yet\nunresolved, question: just what are our explanatory ambitions in\noffering a theory of reference in the first place? \nSo far, this article has been concerned with what might be called\n‘positive’ views of reference. Reference, construed as a\nrelation between bits of language and bits of reality, is assumed to\nbe a genuine, substantive relation worthy of philosophical \nscrutiny—or perhaps a family of such relations. Accounts are then\noffered of what constitutes this link. Some philosophers have even\ntried to work up from this link to more substantive conclusions\nabout the nature of knowledge and reality (see, in particular, Putnam\n(1981); see also the entry on\n skepticism and content externalism).\n But not all philosophers are so sanguine about the theoretical\nsignificance of reference, or even the thesis that there is either one\nor a family of substantive relations to be explained. In closing, we\nwill briefly discuss several ‘negative’ views of\nreference.  \nW.V.O. Quine is probably the most famous reference skeptic. In\nhis (1960), he argued that reference is inherently indeterminate or\n‘inscrutable’. By this, Quine means that there is no fact\nof the matter about what our words refer to. This is not to say that\nour words refer to something but we are unable to determine what that\nis. Rather, there is simply no such thing as that to which our words\nrefer. Nevertheless, Quine does not go so far as to say that our words\nfail to refer in any sense. His view is rather that it makes sense to\nspeak of what our words refer to only relative to some purpose we\nmight have in assigning referents to those words. Quine’s argument for\nthe inscrutability thesis involves an application of the thesis that\nempirical theories are underdetermined by their supporting evidence.\nFor any body of empirical evidence we might have about speakers of a\ngiven language, there will be a number of competing theories regarding\nwhat their words refer to. Such theories will be empirically\nequivalent, equally consistent with the empirical data. One theory\nmight say that, in the language in question,\n‘gavagai’ refers to rabbits; another might say\nthat it refers to undetached rabbit parts; a third might say that it\nrefers to time-slices of rabbits. Quine’s views on underdetermination\ncan be applied to one’s own language as well. The result is that the\navailable evidence no more forces the speaker to the conclusion that\nby ‘rabbit’ she means rabbits than it forces her to\nconclude that by ‘rabbit’ she means undetached rabbit\nparts or time-slices of rabbits. If a speaker observes herself using\nthe word ‘rabbit,’ the evidence she amasses will give\nequal support to all three theories, as well as to many others. So,\naccording to Quine, for any given body of empirical evidence, there\nwill be numerous competing theories as to what the words one uses\nrefer to. And there will be no principled way of adjudicating between\nthese\n theories.[15] \nA related and much-discussed problem, the problem of the many, was\nraised by Peter Unger (1980) and Geach (1980). Basically, the idea is\nthat with many, probably even most, physical objects, there are any\nnumber of equally compelling candidates for their borders, and hence\ntheir physical constitution. In the terms we’ve been dealing with\nhere, there are any number of equally compelling candidates for being\nthe referent of a singular referential term, like ‘that’,\nwhen that term is being used to target a physical object. Without some\nway of selecting one of these as somehow privileged, we might wonder\nwhether we should really think of such terms as referring—unless, \nthat is, we are happy to accept that apparently-singular\nreferential terms in fact refer to sets of objects, vague objects, or\nthe\n like.[16] \nDonald Davidson’s instrumentalist views on reference are in some sense\nmore radical still. Davidson (1984) claims that reference\nis a theoretically vacuous notion: it is of absolutely no use in a\nsemantic theory, or a theory of strict and literal meaning. His basis\nfor endorsing this position is his conviction that no\nsubstantive explanation of reference is possible. The problem\nis that any such explanation would have to be given in\nnon-linguistic terms, but no such explanation can be given,\nDavidson claims. As Davidson puts it: if the name\n‘Kilimanjaro’ refers to Kilimanjaro, then no doubt there\nis some relation between English (or Swahili) speakers, the word, and\nthe mountain. But it is inconceivable that one should be able to\nexplain this relation without first explaining the role of the words\nin the sentences; and if this is so, there is no chance of explaining\nreference directly in non-linguistic terms. However, this does not\nmean that there is no hope for semantics. On the contrary, on\nDavidson’s view, a theory of truth for a language is at the same time\na theory of meaning for that language. The point here is that a\nDavidsonian theory of meaning has no place for the notion of reference\nper se; instead, it assimilates what we might be tempted to call\n‘reference’ into the theory of linguistic truth. That might, however,\nprove compatible with the sorts of pluralist approaches to reference\nwe canvassed above. \nSimilar in spirit to Davidson’s view are deflationist theories of\nreference—not to be confused with deflationism about truth,\nthough often motivated by a desire to endorse that latter theory.\nDeflationists about truth typically claim that to assert that a\nstatement is true is just to assert the statement itself.\nDeflationists about reference, on the other hand, claim that there is\nnothing more to the notion of reference than what is captured by\ninstances of a schema like: ‘a’ refers to\na. Such a schema generates claims like ‘Frege’\nrefers to Frege, claims which can seem perfectly plausible until we\nconsider the problem of names with multiple bearers or indexicals,\nboth pure and impure. In such cases, the deflationist might then reach\nfor a slightly more complex schema incorporating the notion of a use\nof a term. But then we need to ask what is meant by a\n‘use’ in these circumstances, and once we start to answer\nthis question it becomes increasingly unclear whether a truly\ndeflationist approach to reference can in fact be\n preserved.[17] \nIn spite of the myriad concerns which motivate these\n‘negative’ views of reference, concerns which might well\nmake us rethink the idea that there is any one relation which deserves\nto be called ‘reference’, the nature of the relation\nbetween language and reality continues to be one of the most talked\nabout and vigorously debated issues in the philosophy of language.\nWhat remains to be seen is whether and to what extent this work might\nprove useful for understanding a broader notion of reference, or a\nbroader notion of the relationship between representational tokens and\nthe world around us, which is equally at home in aesthetics, ethics,\nand the philosophy of mind as it is in the philosophy of language.","contact.mail":"eliot.michaelson@kcl.ac.uk","contact.domain":"kcl.ac.uk"}]
