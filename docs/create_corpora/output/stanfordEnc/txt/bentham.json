Crimmins","entry":"bentham","body.text":"\n\n\n\nJeremy Bentham, jurist and political reformer, is the philosopher\nwhose name is most closely associated with the foundational era of the\nmodern utilitarian tradition. Earlier moralists had enunciated several\nof the core ideas and characteristic terminology of utilitarian\nphilosophy, most notably John Gay, Francis Hutcheson, David Hume,\nClaude-Adrien Helvétius and Cesare Beccaria, but it was Bentham\nwho rendered the theory in its recognisably secular and systematic\nform and made it a critical tool of moral and legal philosophy and\npolitical and social improvement. In 1776, he first announced himself\nto the world as a proponent of utility as the guiding principle of\nconduct and law in\nA Fragment on Government. In An Introduction to the\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation (printed 1780, published\n1789), as a preliminary to developing a theory of penal law he\ndetailed the basic elements of classical utilitarian theory. The penal\ncode was to be the first in a collection of codes that would\nconstitute the utilitarian pannomion, a complete body of law\nbased on the utility principle, the development of which was to engage\nBentham in a lifetime’s work and was to include civil,\nprocedural, and constitutional law. As a by-product, and in the\ninterstices between the sub-codes of this vast legislative edifice,\nBentham’s writings ranged across ethics, ontology, logic,\npolitical economy, judicial administration, poor law, prison reform,\ninternational law, education, religious beliefs and institutions,\ndemocratic theory, government, and administration. In all these areas\nhe made major contributions that continue to feature in discussions of\nutilitarianism, notably its moral, legal, economic and political\nforms. Upon this rests Bentham’s reputation as one of the great\nthinkers in modern philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Bentham was born on 15 February 1748 and died on 6 June 1832 in\nLondon. He was the elder son of an attorney, Jeremiah Bentham\n(1712–92) and his first wife, Alicia Whitehorn (d. 1759), and\nbrother to Samuel (1757–1831), a naval architect and diplomat.\nBentham’s later interest in educational reform was stimulated by\nhis unhappy experiences at Westminster School (1755–60) and\nQueen’s College, Oxford (BA 1763, MA 1766). He described\nWestminster as “a wretched place for instruction”\n(1838–43, X, 30), while his three years at Queen’s, which\nhe entered at the age of twelve, were no more stimulating. He viewed\nthe Oxbridge colleges as seats of privilege, prejudice and idleness,\nand his Oxford experience left him with a deep distrust of oaths and\nsparked a general antipathy toward the Anglican establishment (2011,\n35–40). In the early 1770s, he jotted down notes for a critical\nwork on “Subscriptions [to articles of faith]” (UC v,\n1–32; xcvi, 263–341), and returned to the same theme in\nthe controversial tract Swear Not at All (1817). \n\nFollowing Oxford Bentham attended the Court of King’s Bench,\nWestminster Hall as part of his preparation for a law career. There he\nheard cases argued before Lord Mansfield, including the proceedings\nagainst the radical journalist and politician John Wilkes. He returned\nbriefly to Oxford in 1763–64 to attend lectures given by William\nBlackstone, the first Vinerian Professor of English Law, which were\npublished in four celebrated volumes as Commentaries on the Laws\nof England (1765–69). Bentham was not impressed, detecting\nglaring fallacies in Blackstone’s natural law reasoning. In the\nyears following other aspects of Blackstone’s theory received\nhis critical attention, notably his defence of England’s\n“mixed and balanced” government and English common\nlaw. Thereafter Blackstone was associated in Bentham’s mind with\nthe “every-thing-as-it-should-be” school of legal and\npolitical apologetics. \n\nBentham was called to the Bar in 1769, but his legal career lasted\nonly one brief. In that year he discovered the utility principle and\nrelated ideas in the writings of Hume, Helvétius and Beccaria\nand chose instead a career dedicated to analytic jurisprudence, law\nreform, and social and political improvement. Unaware of\nHutcheson’s version of the utilitarian formula in An Inquiry\ninto the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1729),\nBentham was occasionally deceived by faulty memory into thinking he\nhad discovered it in Priestley’s Essay on the First\nPrinciples of Government (1768). More plausible, however, are his\nclaims to have found it in Beccaria’s Dei Delitti e delle\nPene (1764), where the Italian law reformer announced that the\nonly valid criterion for evaluating the merits of a law is “la\nmessima felicità divisa nel maggior numero”—the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number. In reading Hume’s\nTreatise of Human Nature (1739–40)—which declared\nthat all social inquiry should be based on the “experimental\nMethod of Reasoning”—Bentham found virtue equated with\nutility, at which he “felt as if scales had fallen from my\neyes” (1977, 440n). Having borrowed the nomenclature of utility\nfrom Hume, Bentham then turned to De l’esprit\n(1758), in which Helvétius delineated the potential for utility\nto act as a guide to human conduct by making a connection\n“between the idea attached to the word …\n‘happiness’ … and the ideas attached to the words\n‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’”. This meant, as\nhe recalled in the “Article on Utilitarianism” (1829),\nthat “attached to the words ‘utility’ and\n‘principle of utility’ were now ideas in abundance”,\nfrom which “a commencement was made of the application of the\nprinciple of utility to practical uses” (1983a, 290). \n\nBentham’s writings present distinct challenges for the\nhistorian of ideas: the dates of publication are not always consistent\nwith the time of composition, in some instances with many intervening\nyears; a good number were published posthumously, and some have still\nto appear in authoritative editions; many were produced, edited or\ntranslated by other hands from original manuscripts with little\nauthorial control. \n\nBentham launched his career as a legal theorist in 1776 with the\nanonymously published A Fragment on Government. This slim\nvolume is an offshoot of a larger critique of Blackstone that was not\npublished until the twentieth century, and is now known as A\nComment on the Commentaries. In the Fragment Bentham\nstated the “fundamental axiom” that “it is the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right\nand wrong”, and “the obligation to minister to general\nhappiness, was an obligation paramount to and inclusive of every\nother” (1977, 393, 440n). In An Introduction to the\nPrinciples of Morals and Legislation (IPML), his major\nwork of this early period, he described utility as “that\nproperty in any object” which “tends to produce benefit,\nadvantage, good or happiness” (all commensurate terms in\nBentham’s moral vocabulary), and the utility principle as\n“that principle which approves or disapproves of every action\nwhatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to\naugment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in\nquestion” (1970, 12). Bentham would give these basic postulates\nexposition, argumentative support, and further refinement in the\ndecades following, but it was the operationalization of the utility\nprinciple that absorbed most of his energy and time during a long and\nhighly productive working life. \n\nIn 1781, Bentham—who delighted in inventing new terminology to\ndescribe philosophical concepts—coined the name\n“utilitarian” in recording a dream he had while a guest at\nthe country estate of his patron, the Whig politician William Petty,\n2nd Earl of Shelburne (1737–1805). In this dream he\nimagined himself “a founder of a sect; of course a personage of\ngreat sanctity and importance. It was called the sect of the\nutilitarians” (text of the dream in Crimmins 1990,\n314). It was through Shelburne that he became acquainted with the\nGenevan exile Étienne Dumont (1759–1829), who was to play\na critical role in making Bentham’s name and philosophy known in\ncontinental Europe and elsewhere through the publication of a number\nof translations and redactions of his early writings (1829–30;\nsee Blamires 2008). The most important of these were the three volumes\nof Traités de législation civil et\npénale (1802) assembled from early manuscript drafts,\nparts of IPML and other works. The first two volumes on civil\nand penal law were later re-translated into English by the American\nutilitarian Richard Hildreth and published as The Theory of\nLegislation (1840), a text that remained at the centre of\nutilitarian studies in the English-speaking world through to the\nmiddle of the twentieth century. \n\nIn 1786–87 Bentham visited Russia, where his brother Samuel was\nin the pay of Prince Potemkin, the favourite of Empress\nCatherine. There he wrote A Defence of Usury (1787), his\nfirst contribution to economic affairs, in which he rejected Adam\nSmith’s defence of a legal maximum for interest rates. Bentham\nargued that Smith’s position was inconsistent with his general\nadvocacy of freedom of trade and would restrict economic growth and\nnational prosperity by deterring investment and innovation. The volume\nlater received high praise from J.S. Mill, who thought it “the\nbest extant writing on the subject” (1963–91, II, 923). It\nreceived its widest audience in America, where it was reprinted on\nmany occasions and frequently cited in the debates over the usury\nlaws. It was in Russia, too, that Bentham took an idea of\nSamuel’s and developed it into the “panopticon”, the\nfull dimensions of which he explained in Panopticon; Or, The\nInspection House (1791). The panopticon is a building of circular\ndesign intended for any institutional arrangement where the\n“inmates” required constant supervision—such as\nhospitals, schools, workhouses and poor houses—but the\npanopticon became most well-known as a prison for “grinding\nrogues honest and idle men industrious” (1838–43, IV,\n342). Appalled by the inefficiency and inhumane conditions in\nBritain’s penal regime, Bentham developed the idea of the\npanopticon penitentiary as a substitute penal system, in which\nconvicted criminals would be subject to a disciplinary regime based on\nthe maxim that “the more strictly we are watched, the better we\nbehave” (2001, 277). \n\nUpon his return from Russia, Bentham was encouraged by Shelburne to\nturn his attentions to foreign policy and international law. Indeed,\n“international” was a term coined by Bentham. He\ndrafted short papers on several topics that were later published under\nthe general title Principles of International Law. This work\nincluded as was then in philosophical vogue, “A Plan for\nPerpetual Peace” and, uniquely, a proposal for an international\ncourt of arbitration (1838–43, II, 535–71).\n Sympathetic to both Russia and France at this time, in 1789 he\nissued a critique of Prime Minister William Pitt’s war-like\nstance towards these countries in a series of letters in the Public\nAdvertiser under the nom-de-plume “Anti-Machiavel”\n(1838–43, X, 201–11). \n\nThe political upheaval in France provided Bentham with an\nopportunity to put certain of his ideas into practice and also the\ncontext in which he first developed the utilitarian logic of democracy\nbased on the identification of interests between the ruler and the\nruled. He nevertheless stopped short of publicly advocating\nparliamentary reform in Britain and at this stage was very far from the\nrepublicanism he adopted in later life (Dinwiddy 1975; Crimmins 1994;\nSchofield 2006). With Dumont’s assistance, in 1788 Bentham\nbegan sending pamphlets of suggestions to the Comte de Mirabeau. \nIn 1790 he wrote a Draught of a New Plan for the Organisation of a\nJudicial Establishment in France which, together with\nDumont’s translation of parts of Panopticon and parts of\nAn Essay on Political Tactics dealing with the\norganisation of legislative proceedings, was also placed before the\nFrench National Assembly. The bloody excesses of the Terror\nreinforced his criticism of the abstract and slippery nature of natural\nand imprescriptible rights, which he famously dismissed as\n“nonsense on stilts” (2002, 330)—an epithet first\nconceived while listening to Blackstone’s lectures and adumbrated\nin his contribution to John Lind’s An Answer to the\nDeclaration [of Independence] of the American Congress (1776).\nNevertheless, Bentham’s efforts to stimulate reform in France\nwere recognised in the granting of honorary citizenship in September\n1792. \n\nWhen war broke out between England and revolutionary France,\nPitt’s security measures made it precarious to engage in reform\nactivities at home, but Bentham’s caution also stemmed from the\nneed to curry favour in official circles for the panopticon\npenitentiary (Semple 1993, 187–90). The building of a new\nprison in London had been authorised by the Penitentiary Act 1794 and\nBentham’s plan initially received the support of the Pitt\nadministration. Over the years he devoted considerable sums of\nhis own money to the project, and published further material comparing\nthe merits of the panopticon with the disadvantages of the system of\ntransporting convicts to penal colonies (1838–43, IV,\n173–284). In 1802, however, he admitted defeat, and in 1812\nthe government officially closed the books on the whole sorry affair,\npaying Bentham £23,000 in compensation. \n\nIn the intervening years Bentham turned his attentions to poor law\nreform, the reform of policing, economic and financial questions,\njudicial administration and the rules of evidence—the last of\nthese being a product of his critique of the archaisms and confusions\nof common law and the arbitrary character of “judge-made\nlaw” (Postema 1989). \n\nThe essays on poor law reform from 1796–98 (2001, 2010a) were\npartly stimulated by rising food prices and the resultant debate about\nthe treatment of the poor. The essays contained a plan for a system of\n“industry houses” run by a joint-stock company (named the\nNational Charity Company) to house the indigent, provide them with\nemployment, and provide welfare services for the working poor, the\nshort-term unemployed and disabled or unwell (Bahmueller 1981).\n Bentham’s writings on political economy include A\nManual of Political Economy (1790–95), A Protest Against\nLaw Taxes (1795), Supply without Burthen; or Escheat Vice\nTaxation (1795), “Circulating Annuities”\n(1799–1800), “Paper Mischief” (1800–1),\nThe True Alarm (1801), Institute of Political\nEconomy (1800–4), and Defence of a Maximum (1801).\nFew of these were published during Bentham’s lifetime, and some\nonly became known in the mid-twentieth century (Stark 1952–54),\nwhich explains their relative neglect compared to the attention given\nthe writings of other political economists of the period. New editions\nare now in progress (2016a, 2019) which will provide abundant material for a\nreassessment of Bentham’s contributions to this field.  The writings\non monetary matters, in particular, contain original and innovative\nsolutions to practical financial and currency difficulties. While many\nof the economic policies recommended and defended in these writings\nderive from Bentham’s reading of Adam Smith—with the\nnotable exception of the prescriptions contained in Defence of a\nMaximum—they are also expressly based on the subordinate\nends of his theory of civil law (Kelly 1989), as were his ideas for\npoor law reform (Quinn 2008). \n\nAfter ruminating on the subject for several years, Bentham took up the\nreform of judicial administration in Scotch Reform (1808),\nwhile the voluminous manuscripts on evidence from this time were later\nedited and published by J.S. Mill as Rationale of Judicial\nEvidence (1827). In the latter, Bentham laid down practical\nguidelines on the forms and admissibility of evidence, favouring\n“natural” over “technical” procedures as most\napt to produce truth in court proceedings and to rid the system of\nvexation, expense, and delay, which he attributed to the vested\ninterest of lawyers in maintaining an arrangement designed to maximize\nlegal fees. In courts open to the public, judges were to be charged\nwith following basic principles that would allow for the most complete\nand accurate testimony available (Twining 1985, 42, 70; Schofield\n2006, 119–31; Resnick 2011). Adjudication in Bentham’s\nreformed courts would require the strict application of the\nutilitarian codes of law. The overriding consideration was the\nsubordination of the judge to the lawmaker, though the judge may (if\nempowered) suspend the execution of the law where utility demanded,\npending a final decision by the legislature (Dinwiddy 1989a). \n\nDespite these wide and varied interests, the government’s\nbetrayal over the panopticon continued to anger Bentham for many\nyears, generating a deep-seated scepticism of the motives of those in\npositions of power and influence. Added to his own first-hand\nexperience of the maneuvers of aristocratic landowners determined to\nprevent the erection of a panopticon in the vicinity of their London\nestates, there was also a suggestion that the King himself, outraged\nby Bentham’s “Anti-Machiavel” letters and disturbed\nby rumours of his Jacobinism, may have directly intervened to thwart\nthe project (1838–43, XI, 96–105). In Bentham’s mind\nsuch actions were representative of the “sinister\ninterests” typically ranged against beneficial schemes of\nreform. This insight served to draw Bentham into an open engagement\nwith parliamentary reform. A further catalyst came from his\nassociation with James Mill, whom he met in late 1808, and who for\nmany years thereafter acted as his philosophical and political\naide-de-camp. \n\nWith Mill’s encouragement, Bentham returned to his earlier\nmanuscripts on political reform and refined and significantly expanded\nhis critique to encompass the forms of “influence” at work\nin British political institutions. The drafts he wrote in\n1809–10 provided the outlines for his first public statement in\nsupport of representative democracy in Plan of Parliamentary\nReform in the Form of a Catechism with Reasons for Each Article\n(1817). Based on the arithmetic of interests, aimed at limiting the\nsinister interests of those in positions of power while promoting the\ninterests of those without power, Bentham’s scheme advocated a\ncomprehensive set of reforms. These included: the elimination of royal\npatronage, a substantial extension of the franchise, annual elections\nby secret ballot, the election of intellectually qualified and\nindependent members of parliament with a system of fines to ensure\nregular attendance, and the accurate and regular publication of\nparliamentary debates. Without these reforms Bentham believed Britain\nrisked revolution. From this point on he became widely recognised as\nthe foremost philosophical voice of political radicalism. \n\nOther political writings from this time include Defence of\nEconomy against the Right Honourable Edmund Burke and Defence\nof Economy against the Right Honourable George Rose, both written\nin 1810 but not published until 1817 (1993, 39–155). These essays\nattacked waste and corruption in government and were later reissued,\nwith other previously published essays, in Official Aptitude\nMaximized, Expense Minimized (1830), the overall aim of which was\nto optimize the competence of public servants while reducing government\nexpenditure. In 1824, his Book of Fallacies appeared, in\nwhich he employed a humorous vein of barbs to lay bare the fallacious\nreasoning frequently used to bolster sinister interests and stymie\nproposals for reform (2015). \n\nBentham’s position on female suffrage at this time was nuanced\n(Boralevi 1984, Ch.2): he objected to the exclusion of women from the\nvote in James Mill’s 1820 essay “On Government” (UC\nxxxiv, 303), an exclusion he had long ago condemned as founded on\nnothing but prejudice (2002, 247; 1838–43, III, 463),\nNevertheless, in public he argued that women were to be excluded until\nsuch time as universal male suffrage had been achieved (1838–43,\nIX, 108). \n\nClosely related to Bentham’s critique of the political\nestablishment were his substantial criticisms of religious\ninstitutions, practices and beliefs in\nChurch–of–Englandism and its Catechism Examined\n(1818), An Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the\nTemporal Happiness of Mankind (1822), and Not Paul, but\nJesus (1823). In these works he brought to bear with telling\nscepticism his reasoning on logic, language and ontology from the same\nperiod (1838–43, VIII, 193–338; Crimmins 1990). At\nabout the same time, he also wrote at length on private ethics in\nDeontology, published posthumously in two volumes in\n1834. Education was another topic that held Bentham’s\nattention. In Church–of–Englandism he was\nhighly critical of the education offered in the schools run by the\nNational Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the\nPrinciples of the Established Church. When Mill, Francis Place and\nothers became involved in a scheme to establish a non-sectarian school\nin London, Bentham busied himself with ideas for its curriculum,\nstressing science and vocational subjects over the classics, the first\npart of which (printed in 1815) appeared in 1816 in\nChrestomathia (meaning “conducive to useful\nlearning”) and a second part in 1817 (Itzkin 1978). While the\nChrestomathic school was never built, in 1826 the same reformers, with\nsupport from a number of Evangelicals and Nonconformists, formed the\nnucleus of a group that succeeded in founding University College\nLondon, England’s first secular university. An important\nsupplement to Bentham’s educational theorizing is contained in a\nlong appendix to the Chrestomathia on logic and\nclassification, later translated and edited by his nephew George\nBentham and published as Essai sur la nomenclature et la\nclassification des principles branches d’art-et-science\n(1823). \n\nIn his final years Bentham revisited aspects of his utilitarian\nphilosophy and sought to define his place in the utilitarian tradition\nin the “Article on Utilitarianism”. However, more often\nthan not his thoughts were focused on constitutional questions,\nincluding the administrative structures and the formal and informal\narrangements of a viable representative democracy—in short, the\nways and means of limiting and controlling political authority or, as\nBentham termed them, “securities against misrule”.\nCodification Proposal, Addressed … to all Nations\nProfessing Liberal Opinions (1822) was intended to advertise his\ncredentials as a codifier of law to politicians and statesmen around\nthe world, first by setting down the utilitarian principles of an\n“all-comprehensive” code, and second by providing\ntestimonials to his aptitude for the task of codification (1998,\n241–384; see also Lieberman 2011). The testimonials came from\nfar and wide in the years 1814–22, in the form of extracts from\nspeeches, requests for information, and letters of support, from the\nlikes of Francis Burdett and Henry Brougham in England, government\nministers and representatives of the Cortes in Spain and Portugal,\nItalian and French liberals, state governors and other political\nrepresentatives in the “Anglo-American States”, the\nRussian Emperor Alexander, and the influential Polish statesman Prince\nCzartoriski. In the years following, Bentham produced draft upon draft\nof elements of the Constitutional Code, only the first of\nthree volumes of which was published during his lifetime. In these\nwritings he unequivocally pinned his colors to the republican cause,\nbut also demonstrated an acute sense of the growing importance of the\nadministrative functions of the modern state (Rosenblum 1978; Hume\n1981; Rosen 1983). \n\nIn old age Bentham liked to style himself “the hermit of\nQueen’s Square Place” (the location of his home in London),\nbut he was anything but a hermit. In December 1823 he provided funds to\nstart the Westminster Review, a periodical dedicated to\nradical views. He also assumed a leadership role in the movement for\nlaw reform and political reform, maintained regular contact with\nsimilarly inclined reformers, publishers and intellectuals at home and\nabroad, and was surrounded by disciples who acted as secretaries,\ncollaborators, and editorial assistants. The Mills, Place, George\nGrote, Richard Smith, Peregrine Bingham, Thomas Southwood Smith, Edwin\nChadwick, and John Bowring all worked with Bentham in this way. \nTogether with others, such as Thomas Perronet Thompson, Charles Buller,\nJohn Roebuck and Joseph Hume, these later came to be known as the\n“philosophic radicals” (a coinage of J.S. Mill’s),\nthough in reality the group was far less cohesive than is sometimes\nthought (Thomas 1979). Bentham had a telling influence on the\nIrish socialist utilitarian William Thompson and for a time he\nmaintained close ties with the Irish “Liberator” Daniel\nO’Connell, whom he sought to bind to the radical cause in\nparliament (Crimmins 2011a, Ch.7). Burdett and Brougham were also\ntreasured acquaintances, though this did not prevent Bentham from\nexpressing scepticism about the dedication to radical reform of the\nformer, or from criticising the latter’s proposals to reform the\nChancery Court in Lord Brougham Displayed (1832). \n\nBentham never married, and died in the company of friends on the eve\nof the signing of the Great Reform Act. Convinced that even the dead\nshould serve a utilitarian purpose, in his last will he directed that\nhis body be publicly “anatomised” in order to publicize\nthe benefits of donating bodies for medical research (Richardson\n1986). The sanitary reformer and physician Thomas Southwood Smith\n(1832) delivered the eulogy over Bentham’s dissected remains. In\npreparation for this final act, in an unpublished pamphlet written in\nthe year before his death, Auto-Icon; or Farther Uses of the Dead\nto the Living (printed 1842, but not then published), he proposed\nthe display of auto-iconized bodies and heads as a means to public\ninstruction. He requested that his own mummified head and skeleton,\ndressed in his habitual garments, be displayed, and it can still be\nviewed today at University College London. Bentham’s (admittedly\neccentric and somewhat humorous) ideas about\n“auto-iconism” can also be understood as an attempt to\nfind a secular substitute for the rituals and practices of\nconventional religion. \n\nPreliminary to the analysis of existing legal systems and the\nconstruction of the utilitarian pannomion, in 1776 Bentham\nbegan drafting “Preparatory Principles” (of censorial\njurisprudence or what the law ought to be). In these over 600 pages of\nmanuscript, now published in authoritative form in the\nCollected Works (2016b), he offered a series of disquisitions on the\ndefinitions, distinctions, axioms, and aphorisms intended as tools for\ndemystifying the “fictions” of English law and legal\npractice, fictions which he found uncritically reiterated in\nBlackstone’s Commentaries. In these and other early\nwritings we see Bentham striving to emulate in the moral world the\ngreat advances made in physical science. In the process he consciously\nallied himself with the more progressive elements of the Enlightenment\nand made plain the intellectual influences that shaped his thought,\nnotably Bacon, Locke, Hume, and the French philosophes. \n\nInfluenced by the empiricism of Bacon and Locke, Bentham held that\nall knowledge is derived from sensation: the intellect has no material\nto work with apart from that obtained by the senses. In the\nsecond half of the 17th century, the Royal Society had\nemphasized the role of experiment and generally empiricist epistemology\nin the development of the natural sciences. Suitably impressed by\nthe progress made in this department of knowledge, Bentham carried over\ninto moral science the basic principle that people can only know, in\nany certain or scientific sense of that term, that which can be\nobserved and verified. He argued that legal science ought to be\nbuilt on the same immovable basis of sensation and experience as that\nof medicine, declaring “what the physician is to the natural\nbody, the legislator is to the political: legislation is the art of\nmedicine exercised upon a grand scale” (UC xxxii, 168). \n\nThis was the core of the “experimental method” for\nBentham; it was an approach implicitly associated in his mind with a\nmaterialist ontology and a representational theory of meaning. He\nrejected all forms of idealism in philosophy and insisted that in\nprinciple all matter is quantifiable in mathematical terms, and this\nextends to the pains and pleasures that we experience—the\nultimate phenomena to which all human activity (and social concepts,\nsuch as rights, obligation, and duty) could be reduced and explained.  \n\nIn Bentham’s theory of language general terms have no\ncorresponding reality: words, ideas and propositions must represent or\ndescribe “real entities”, which may be either\n“perceptions” or “substances” (UC lxix,\n62–63), or they are “fictitious entities”. This was\na distinction Bentham learnt from d’Alembert (1838–43,\nIII, 286), though he turned it to a more radical ontological\npurpose. He defined a fictitious entity as “a mere\nnothing” and “no proposition by which any property is\nascribed to it can therefore be in itself and of itself a true one,\nnor therefore an instructive one”. If there is any truth\nassociated with a fictitious entity it “can not belong to it in\nany other character than that of the intended and supposed equivalent\nof … some proposition having for its subject some real\nentity” (1838–43, VIII, 246). The technique of\n“paraphrasis” was the key instrument Bentham employed to\ndemystify fictitious entities. Some fictitious entities are necessary\nfor human discourse, but their meaning can only be revealed through\ntheir connection to real entities (1977, 495n; 2010b, 287–88,\n317–18); if a fictitious entity proves impervious to this\nparaphrastic technique it is shown to be a meaningless abstraction\nunrelated to demonstrable reality. Moral terminology such as\n“right” and “obligation”, for example, can be\nrendered meaningful only in terms of the perceptible pains and\npleasures experienced by specific individuals. On the other hand,\ntheological propositions, having no correlation with material reality,\ndeal not with the facts of ordinary experience but with a supposed\n“reality” that transcends the physical world, and just as\nthe language of opinion ought to have no place in the discourse of\nphysical science, so the untestable and unverifiable propositions of\ntheology have no place in moral science. \n\nIn\nIPML, Bentham directed this\nanalysis against a host of ethical propositions he sought to eliminate\nas competing alternatives to the utility principle, such as\n“moral sense”, “common sense”, “law of\nreason”, “natural justice”, and “natural\nequity”. All are dismissed on the grounds that they are\nmerely empty phrases that express nothing beyond the sentiment of the\nperson who advocates them. Not representing verifiable reality,\nsuch phrases could not be considered useful. Indeed, they were\nsurely pernicious, serving as a “pretense, and aliment, to\ndespotism; if not … in practice, a despotism however in\ndisposition” (1970, 28n). By comparison,\n“utility” was a principle rooted in the empirical and\nverifiable facts of the felt experience of pains and pleasures. \n\nAt the beginning of IPML Bentham offered the famous\ndeclamation that underscores the primacy of pains and pleasures in\nutilitarian theory: \n\nThere are two forms of hedonism expressed in this seminal passage:\n(1) psychological hedonism, which states that all motives of action are\ngrounded in the apprehension of pain or the desire for pleasure; and\n(2) ethical hedonism, which holds that pleasure is the only good and\nactions are right in so far as they tend to produce pleasure or avoid\npain. As Bentham went on to explain, allowing for “immunity from\npain”, pleasure is “the only good”, and pain\n“without exception, the only evil” (1970, 100). As\nsuch, pain and pleasure are the final cause of individual\naction and the efficient cause and means to individual\nhappiness. \n\nNor were these observations restricted to humankind in\nBentham’s view—the proposed penal code was to include a\nsection on cruelty to animals. As he explained, “the\nquestion is not, Can they reason? Nor, can they\ntalk? But, can they suffer?” (1970, 283n)—a\nproposition that lies at the beginnings of utilitarian arguments for\nthe ethical treatment of animals (see Singer 1975). \n\nSince each person’s happiness is constituted of the aggregate\nbalance of pleasures over pains, this is “the sole end which the\nlegislator ought to have in view: the sole standard in conformity to\nwhich each individual ought, as far as depends upon the legislator, to\nbe made to fashion his behaviour” (1970, 34). But how is\nthe legislator to influence individual actions and gain conformity to\nhis decisions? Bentham delineated four “sanctions” or\nsources of pain and pleasure, which he may have learnt from Gay’s\nessay Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or\nMorality (1731): physical, political, moral, and religious. These\nsanctions (he later added sympathy to the list) are available to the\nmoralist and to the legislator in guiding and determining an\nindividual’s moral conduct, and they explain how an essentially\nself-interested individual may be encouraged and, where necessary,\ndirected to perform actions that promote the greatest happiness of both\nhimself and others. It is incumbent on the utilitarian legislator,\ntherefore, to understand the “value” of the pains and\npleasures he must employ to achieve this objective. \n\nWhile the consequences of an act often depend on the motives which\ngive rise to the act (and partly on the agent’s intentions and\nthe circumstances in which the act is performed), in Bentham’s\ntheory the utility of an act is independent of its originating\nmotive(s). In effect, there is no such thing as a good or bad\nmotive. The utility of an act—its goodness or\nbadness—is determined solely by its consequences: the benefits\nand/or costs that result. When deciding whether to act or which\nact to undertake, a person must calculate as best as he can the pains\nand pleasures that may reasonably be expected to accrue to the persons\n(including himself) affected by the acts under consideration. A\nsimilar calculation should guide the legislator in formulating\nlaws. However, Bentham recognised that it was not normally\nfeasible for an individual to engage in such a calculation as a\npreliminary to undertaking every act. For this reason he spoke of\nthe general tendencies of actions to enhance happiness (suggested by\npast experience) as a sufficient guide in most situations. On the\nother hand, the implicit consequentialism of utilitarian theory is\ncentral to Bentham’s theory of punishment, in which the objective\nwas to ensure that a punishment is in proportion to the mischief\nproduced by a crime and sufficient to deter others from committing the\nsame offence. To this end he developed rules to guide the\nlawmaker in the construction of a penal code, including the elements\ninvolved in the calculation of the mischief caused by offences and the\nappropriate punishments. \n\nIn Helvétius’ account “interest” lies at\nthe epicentre of moral science, but Bentham recognised that the concept\nonly had meaning, like other fictitious entities in ethics such as\n“desire” and “motive”, when redefined in terms\nof the avoidance of pains and acquisition of pleasures (1970, 12;\n1838–43, VIII, 290). In general he followed Adam Smith in\nbelieving the individual to be the best judge of his or her own\ninterests, but the simplicity of this proposition is deceptive (see\nEngelmann 2001). \n\nFirst, a person’s consideration of her interest involves\nexpectations or mental projections of the future, not actually\nexisting material interests. This involves the individual in\nimagining what will occur if she were to act in a certain\nmanner. The specific expectations that attend the consideration\nof an action may be shaped by a myriad of external considerations, as\nwell as the agent’s own predilections and preferences. For\nBentham, the most important elements of the external environment in\nwhich a person imagines outcomes are the penalties and rewards laid\ndown by law and those deriving from other educative and moral\ninstitutional arrangements and practices, including the sanction\nexercised by public opinion. In this sense, law and other\nagencies may be used to construct interests by providing individuals\nwith the motives to pursue courses of action beneficial to the\ncommunity. It is the individual who then must correctly perceive\nwhere her interests lie; she must imagine the expected outcomes the\nlegislator has determined. The result is that Bentham’s material\nview of pains and pleasures as the factors which define\n“interest” tends to evaporate in favour of interests\ncomposed of imagined (though not imaginary) apprehensions and\nexpectations about the future. \n\nSecond, Bentham recognised that explaining action in terms of\ninterest is potentially circular. If we mean by acting according\nto interest, acting selfishly, then the statement “Agents act in\naccordance with their self-interest”, is false. If we mean,\nacting to pursue our interest in the widest sense, then the statement\nis tautological (2010b, 93n). In this respect, the validity\nof the “self-preference principle”—the assumption\nthat self-interest is the motivation of all human action—is\nquestionable. Bentham recognised the possibility of altruistic\nactions, and frequently alluded to his own philanthropy when\nrecommending schemes to further the public good. Moreover, in\nIPML he held that sympathy was a “primeval and constant\nsource” of pleasure and action (1970, 61), and later, in\nDeontology, elevated it to his list of sanctions as a source\nof pain and pleasure (1983a, 84, 183, 201, 203–4). However,\nif not all action is motivated by self-interest in the narrow or strict\nmeaning of the term, then how far can the self-preference principle be\nconsidered a reliable guide for the legislator in constructing motives?\nBentham’s answer, probably influenced by Hume’s view of the\nmatter, is that the self-preference principle is a sound\ngeneralisation. While it is not true that everyone always acts in\nhis or her self-interest, it is best that the legislator design\ninstitutions and law as if this were in fact true. \nSelf-interested acts are the norm; altruism is the exception. As he\nexplained it in the Constitutional Code, even if the\nself-preference principle “held good in no more than a bare\nmajority, of the whole number of instances, it would suffice for every\npractical purpose, in the character of a ground for all political\narrangements” (1838–43, IX, 6). \n\nThird, although individuals may in general be the best judges of\ntheir own interests, they may not always judge wisely. This creates a\ndisjunction between the perception of their interest and their\n“real” interest. Since the “public interest” is\nnothing more than the aggregate of individual interests (1970, 12), an\neffective legislator must have a fairly accurate understanding of the\ninterests of those individuals that constitute the community, of what\nwill motivate them to act in the desired ways (especially in criminal\nlaw). But if people incorrectly perceive their interests, then\nthe legislator may be misled in constructing the appropriate\nmotivation. Clearly, the knowledge needed by the legislator (in\norder to be effective in constructing adequate motives to direct\nindividual actions) is of people’s apparent interests, while the\nlegislator’s objective is to further their “real”\ninterests, that is, what they would choose if they were fully rational\nand informed. This means that assessing the value of the\nconstituent elements of interest (pains and pleasures) is a tricky\nbusiness for the legislator; he must accurately observe the ways people\nbehave, deduce the motives behind their actions, and encompass this\nknowledge in the sanctions of law. Yet these same observations of\nhuman behaviour may not also be reliable guides to the\n“real” interests of individuals, which must be determined\non other grounds. This is why some modern day utilitarians focus\non “preferences”, that is on the subjectively expressed\nopinion of the individual as to what she thinks will be\npleasurable or painful to her (see Bykvist 2013). \n\nBentham addressed the potential disjunction between an agent’s\nperception of her interest and her real interest in his writings on\nindirect law, which he described as “a secret plan of connected\nand long-concerted operations to be executed in the way of a stratagem\nor petite guerre” (2010b, 233). The aim is to tell\nindividuals what they should not do, but also to provide them with\nmotives (pains and pleasures in prospect) sufficient to divert their\ndesires into channels best designed to serve the public interest. Codes\nof behaviour and other “implements of moral instruction”,\nsuch as texts of “history, biography, novels and dramatic\ncompositions” (UC lxxxvii, 18–19), could be utilised to\ndivert people from inclinations damaging to themselves and others and\nto teach them to derive pleasure from benevolence. In this way\ngovernment could educate its citizens to make more effective choices,\nor at least guide them into more appropriate paths to achieve their\nreal interests (1838–43, I, 161). \n\nThough Bentham did not use this terminology, the calculus he\ndevised—commonly known as the “felicific\ncalculus”—describes the elements or dimensions of the value\nof a pain or pleasure. To an individual the value of a pain or\npleasure will be more or less according to its “intensity”,\n“duration”, “certainty or uncertainty”, and its\n“propinquity or remoteness”. Where the object is to\nmeasure the value of a pleasure or pain in terms of the tendency of an\nact, there are two additional circumstances to be taken into account:\n“fecundity” or “the chance it has of being followed\nby sensations of the same kind”, and\n“purity” or “the chance it has of not being\nfollowed by sensations of the opposite kind”. \nWhere there are a number of persons, with reference to whom the value\nof a pleasure or a pain is considered, a further circumstance must be\nfactored into the calculus, that is the “extent” or the\nnumber of persons who are affected by the pleasure or pain (1970,\n38–39). Although Bentham believed there was nothing in what\nhe had proposed “but what the practice of mankind, wheresoever\nthey have a clear view of their own interest, is perfectly conformable\nto”, it has often been said that applying the felicific calculus\nis impractical. Bentham recognised that neither the individual nor the\nlegislator could strictly follow the process he described. \nRather, he presented it as a model of the ideal calculation, and\n“as near as the process actually pursued on these occasions\napproaches to it, so near will such process approach to the character\nof an exact one” (1970, 40). \n\nAs is well known, while adhering to the basic Benthamic analysis of\nmotives, in Utilitarianism (1861) J. S. Mill introduced the\nconcept of“higher pleasures”, by which he meant the\npleasures of the intellect, which he claimed were intrinsically more\ndesirable than other pleasures. This tended to undermine the\naggregative dimension of the theory laid down by Bentham. Recent\ncommentators, however, have questioned whether the distance between\nBentham and Mill is as large as commonly supposed, arguing that\n“intensity” and “purity” are qualities of pains\nand pleasures that, in principle, are still subject to measurement, at\nleast when comparing alternative actions on the same index (Warke 2000;\nRosen 2003, Ch. 10).  \n\nBentham occasionally suggested that pains and pleasures might be\nevaluated in relation to income or wealth, but he was aware of the\nlimitations of this approach. While we might plausibly assume that, of\ntwo individuals with unequal fortunes, the richer of the two would be\nthe happier, it does not follow that adding increments to that\nperson’s wealth will continue to make him happier in the same\nproportion. It is in the nature of the case that the amount of\nincrease in happiness will not be as great as the increase in wealth;\nthe addition of equal increments of money will eventually bring\nsuccessively less of an increase in happiness. Modern economists know\nthis analysis as the law of “diminishing marginal\nutility”. One of its practical consequences for a utilitarian\nsuch as Bentham is that, where choices present themselves between\ngiving an additional increment to a rich man or to a poor man, more\nhappiness will result from giving it to the poorer of the two. Also,\nthe analysis underscores why money cannot be a direct measure of\nutility, since the utility represented by a particular sum of money\nwill vary depending on the relative wealth of the person who receives\nit. Moreover, it is evident that diminishing marginal utility is also\na feature of the additional increments of pleasure a person may\nexperience beyond a certain point; equal increments of pleasure will\nnot necessarily add to the stockpile of happiness if a person has\nreached a saturation point.  \n\nIn the 1829 “Article on Utilitarianism” Bentham\npointed to two later “improvements” to his understanding\nof the utility principle—the “disappointment-prevention\nprinciple” and the “greatest happiness principle” (a\nsubstitute for the “greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber” formula).  \n\nFor Bentham, the unhappiness created by the loss of something will\nusually have a greater impact on a person than the happiness brought\nabout by its gain to someone else (1838–43, I, 304–7). All\nother things being equal, the reduction of utility to one person\ncaused by theft will have a greater bearing on that person’s\nhappiness than the gain in utility to another person from a lottery\nwin of the same monetary value. Of course, if the loser is a wealthy\nperson and the gainer a poor man, this will not hold. But in the\nnormal run of things, this is why Bentham gave a higher priority to\nthe protection of property by law and why he held that the alleviation\nof suffering demands more immediate attention than plans to produce\nwealth (1952–54, III, 324, 342). It is also the rationale for\nwhat Bentham later called the “disappointment-prevention\nprinciple” (1838–43, V, 416), which requires that the\nsecurity of legitimate expectations take precedence over other ends,\nsave where the public interest manifestly justifies government\nintervention. Raising public funds through taxation for vital services\nwould be justified by the principle, as would emergency expropriation\nof property in times of war or famine, usually with compensation paid\nto the property owner.  \n\nFor Bentham, the significance of this principle as a practical\nguide could hardly be overstated. It is, he says, the “one\nall-comprehensive rule” upon which all property arrangements\nought to be based (1983a, 308), and by this, “the first\napplication, or say emanation, of the greatest happiness\nprinciple”, all the arrangements of the law of property\n“in its most extensive sense”, meaning “all objects\nof general desire”, ought to be ordered (295–96; see also\n1838–43, III, 312). \n\nBentham detected a serious and potentially debilitating defect in\nrendering the utility principle as the “greatest happiness of the\ngreatest number”. He came to see that such a principle could\njustify inordinate sacrifices by a minority, however that minority\nmight be composed, in the interest of enhancing the happiness of a\nmajority. He considered this a false conclusion, but one that\nneeded to be addressed. “Be the community in question what\nit may”, he writes, “divide it into two unequal parts, call\none of them the majority, the other the minority, lay out of the\naccount the feelings of the minority, include in the account no\nfeelings but those of the majority, the result you will find is that to\nthe aggregate stock of the happiness of the community, loss, not\nprofit, is the result of the operation”. The less the\nnumerical difference between the minority and majority, the more\nobvious the deficiency in aggregate happiness will be (1983a, 309).\nLogically, then, the closer we approximate the happiness of\nall the members of the community, the greater the aggregate of\nhappiness. \n\nAs an additional improvement in the manner in which Bentham conceived\nthe utility principle, he might have included the “universal\ninterest”, an idea initially stated in Plan of Parliamentary\nReform where it appears as a more particular conception of the\ngreatest happiness principle aimed at the “maximum\n… of comfort and security” for all (1838–43, III,\n452). The universal interest relates to interests that are shared by\neveryone, and only when it is impossible for government to contrive\npolicies to achieve this end is a distribution of happiness less than\nuniversal or less than equal justified (1983b, 136). However, the\nnumber of decisions made by governments that are genuinely of\nuniversal reach are relatively few and may be limited to national\ndefence and the framework of individual rights (securities). Beyond\nthat, redistributive policies invariably involve unequal sacrifices\nand benefits. This means that the legislator must employ a utilitarian\ncalculation in which the pain experienced by the few is reduced to the\nminimum necessary to produce benefits for the many; only on this basis\nmay pleasures be summed and pains subtracted in order to produce the\nrationale to justify the best policy. \n\nRelated to this conception of the universal interest is the\negalitarian commitment that in arriving at the appropriate law or\npolicy the interests of each and all must count, and count equally\n(1840, I, 144). This does not mean that optimal utility is not the\ngoal, but simply stresses that optimal utility will be more likely\nachieved where there is an approximate equality in the distribution of\nthe basic requirements of happiness (Postema 1998).   \n\nThis aspect of Bentham’s theory has often been ignored or\ndismissed as irrelevant by critics who, from T. H. Green forward,\nargue that calculations of total utility fail to respect the\ndistinctiveness of persons and thereby place their interests at\nperpetual risk (Rawls 1971, 22–27; Nozick 1974, 28–35; see\nthe discussions in Ten 1987, 13–37; Rosen 2003,\nChs. 12–13; and Bykvist 2010, Ch. 5). If deterrence can be\nachieved by punishing an innocent bystander when the real culprit\ncannot be caught or brought to justice, then why should the bystander\nnot be punished? Because public utility would be maximised by making\nan example of an innocent bystander just as much as by punishing the\nperson who was actually guilty of the offence but who has not been\napprehended, it seems the utilitarian ought to support the\npunishment. But this is not only intuitively wrong, it is also wrong\nbecause there is a real danger that violations of security would lead\nto other such violations, with no principled basis to cease inflicting\nthem. Bentham was emphatic on this score: “If it is a good thing\nto sacrifice the fortune of one individual to augment that of others,\nit will be yet better to sacrifice a second, a third, a hundred, a\nthousand, …; for whatever may be the number of those you have\nsacrificed, you will always have the same reason to add one more. In\none word, the interest of everybody is sacred, or the interest of\nnobody” (1840, I, 144). Basic securities must be afforded to\neach and every member of the community, and violations of these vital\ninterests are not justified, whether they be perpetrated by other\nindividuals or government, since they contravene the distributive\nelements of utilitarian theory. To this extent, at the very least,\neach person’s happiness must count.  \n\nFrom early on in his utilitarian theorizing, Bentham understood\nthat the achievement of utilitarian objectives in practice required\nthe translation of the utility principle into elements amenable to\nimplementation in ways that the philosophically abstract principle\nitself could not be. Concrete manifestations of happiness, for\nexample, could be found in personal security and reduced crime rates,\nenhanced health and declining death rates, broader opportunities for\neducation, the reduction of diseases caused by sewage pollution, and\nso on. The statistical measurement of these and other issues would\nprovide a solid basis for the dissection of existing law and the\ndevelopment of new law, but Bentham’s thirst for such\ninformation was always well in advance of the available data. This\ndeficiency did not, however, prevent him from developing the\ntheoretical apparatus to direct the formulation of such laws. \n\nIn founding a system of law upon the principle of utility, Bentham\nannounced near the beginning of his career, “I do no more than\nfound it upon a set of rules” (UC lxix, 38). This was more\nthan the Humean observation that utility is embedded in customary rules\nthat have evolved over time. The maximization of utility required\nthat the jurist cast a “censorial” eye on existing\npractices to test their capacity to enhance the greatest happiness.\nWhere the jurist detects deficiencies, new rules and precepts must be\ndeveloped that demonstrably accord with the utility principle. In\nBentham’s hands this took the form of a multitude of subordinate\nor secondary ends, principles and maxims designed to give practical\ndirection to the utility principle in each and every aspect of the law.\nThe greatest happiness principle sets the over-arching objective and is\nthe critical standard against which existing practices are to be\njudged. As such, it stands ever ready to be summoned forth whenever new\nguidelines are needed, subordinate ends conflict, or existing laws\nrequire amendment, refinement, or further elaboration. However,\nin practice it is the secondary elements of the theory that do the work\nof producing beneficial outcomes. In this way, they give practical\nconcreteness to the philosophically abstract end of the greatest\nhappiness. \n\nThe subordinate ends of civil law are security, subsistence,\nabundance, and equality, in this order of priority. “The more\nperfect enjoyment is in all these respects”, Bentham wrote,\n“the greater is the sum of social happiness: and especially of\nthat happiness which depends upon the laws” (1840, I, 96). Where\nthere is abundance and legislative intervention is conducted in\naccordance with the “disappointment-prevention\nprinciple”—such as when the state takes ownership of an\nestate for which there is no legitimate heir (122–23), or when a\ntax on property can be introduced without materially detracting from a\nperson’s expectations—then a degree of equalization may be\nachieved by the redistribution of wealth (Kelly 1990, 191–97).\nThis is entirely consistent with the view that, properly understood,\nthe utility principle entails a presumption in favour of an equal\ndistribution, unless there is compelling empirical evidence that\nutility would not be served by such a policy. As Bentham put it in\nLeading Principles of a Constitutional Code,\n“the more remote from equality are the shares … the less\nis the sum of felicity produced by the sum of those shares”\n(1838–43, II, 276). \n\nThe theory of “diminishing marginal utility” also lends\nsupport to equalization policies, dictating that decreases to the\nwealth of a rich man cause less pain than similar decreases to a poor\nman, while additions to the wealth of the poor man bring happiness in\na greater amount than they would to a rich man (1840, I,\n103–9). In First Principles Preparatory to Constitutional\nCode Bentham went further, to postulate that the greatest\nhappiness of the people “requires that the external instruments\nof felicity, whatsoever they may be, be shared by the whole number in\na proportion so near to equality as is consistent with universal\nsecurity” (1989,16; see also 1840, I, 104). However, he refused\nto countenance the idea that policies to redistribute wealth at\nthe cost of security would be beneficial either to social\nprosperity or individual wellbeing. Proposals to alter the\ndistribution of wealth in line with diminishing marginal utility must,\ntherefore, be conducted in accordance with the\n“disappointment-prevention principle”.  \n\nOn the other hand, Bentham believed that a system of laws based on\nthe utility principle would gradually and “indirectly”\nevolve towards greater equality in the distribution of goods, and\npointed to the historical evidence of post-feudal Europe in support of\nhis position. In the long run the key to achieving a more equal\ndistribution of property lay in abundance: “in a nation\nprosperous in its agriculture, its manufactures and its commerce,\nthere is a continual progress towards equality” (1840, I,\n123). The important caveat Bentham introduced to justify this optimism\nis the proviso that government must not impede this tendency by\nallowing monopolies, putting “shackles” on trade and\nindustry, or placing obstacles in the path of the division of property\non inheritance. \n\nBentham believed that facilitating individuals in the pursuit of\ntheir interests in a free market is what government should do, because\nthis is the proven best way to maximise the public good. Where\nlaissez-faire does not produce the best result, however, the\nlegislator must act in other direct and indirect ways to produce the\noptimal outcome. The question, as Bentham explained in Manual\nof Political Economy, “is to know what ought and what ought\nnot to be done by government. It is in this view, and in this\nview only that the knowledge of what is done and takes place without\nthe interference of government can be of any practical use”\n(1952–54, I, 224). In the Institute of Political\nEconomy, he argued that past experience provided sufficient\nevidence to convince us that governments should not act in the economic\nrealm as much as they often do, hence the motto “Be quiet”\nand the lists of “Non-agenda” items. Where departures\nfrom this general rule are required—such as when vital\nsubsistence goods would be priced beyond the reach of many—they\nbecome “Agenda” items for government (1952–54, III,\n333; see also 247–302). But radical schemes for property\nre-distribution are ruled out; the axiomatic requirement that each be\ntreated equally, that the happiness of each be counted, justified\npolicies to equalize the distribution of goods only where this could be\nachieved without disappointing legitimate expectations.  \n\nCivil and penal law are inextricably connected in Bentham’s\nlegal theory. Just as the primary purpose of civil law is economic\nsecurity and national prosperity, so it draws powerful support from\nthe protection afforded persons, property and expectations by the\nthreat of punishment (1838–43, III, 203). To this end,\nutilitarian penal law is framed in terms of the principal objective of\ndeterrence, but it also embraces the secondary ends of disablement,\nmoral reformation, and compensation (see Crimmins 2011b). The\neffectiveness of the theory in practice depends on two additional\nfeatures: offences must be classified solely on the basis of the harm\nperpetrated, and there must be an appropriate proportion between\ncrimes and punishments. It is because of its failure to satisfy the\nfirst feature that Bentham (2014) rejected the prevailing\ncriminalization of consensual sexual acts, and developed the first\nsystematic defence of sexual liberty in the English language. \n\nIn settling the required proportions of punishment, Bentham\nrecognised he had burdened the legislator with a vastly complex\ntask—the calculation of the correct quantity and type of pain\nneeded to achieve the desired ends, in particular the objective of\ndeterrence. To guide the legislator in proportioning punishments\nto offences he stipulated thirteen rules or “canons”, such\nas that the punishment must outweigh the profit of the offence, venture\nmore against a great offence than a small one, punish for each particle\nof the mischief, and the like (1970, 167–71; see also Bedau,\n2004; Draper, 2009). The delineation of such guidelines to protect\nagainst “unfrugal” or excessive punishments is indicative\nof his attempt to be as comprehensive and as exact as possible while\nattending to practicalities. This is nowhere more apparent than\nin Bentham’s critical analysis of the death penalty. \n\nBentham first examined the utility of the death penalty in the 1770s\nwhen he delineated the principles of penal law (1838–43, I,\n441–50; see also 1970, Ch. XV), and followed this with an\nunpublished essay in 1809 in which he presented a critique of William\nPaley’s defence of the death penalty in his Principles of\nMoral and Political Philosophy (1785), and in particular the use\nof discretionary pardons (UC cvii, 193–277; Crimmins 1987).  A\nfurther short essay “On Death-Punishment”, published in\n1830, repeats many of the arguments from the first essay\n(1838–43, I, 525–32). Arguably, Bentham’s\nutilitarian analysis of the issues raised by the death penalty in the\nfirst of these essays stands as the most thoroughgoing examination of\nthe question up to this time (Bedau 1983). In sum, it is a special\napplication of his utilitarian theory of punishment. The framework of\nanalysis is presented as an objective, neutral exercise, by which the\nbenefits and costs of the death penalty in cases of murder are\nassessed in comparison with life imprisonment with hard labour. All\nthings considered, Bentham believed the weight of the calculation\nworked against the death penalty on the grounds of deterrence, the\nfact that it is inequable in its application, falling mainly on the\nshoulders of the poor, and because it is a form of punishment that is\nirremissible in the face of judicial error.  Nevertheless, at that\ntime he thought the death penalty might reasonably be maintained for\nmurder with aggravating circumstances and for cases of treason\n“in which the name of the offender, so long as he lives, may be\nsufficient to keep a whole nation in a flame” (1970 183). By\n1809, however, he abandoned the exceptions and argued that no offence\nwarranted capital punishment (UC cvii. 201).  \n\nSubordinate ends are also evident in the design and management of\nthe panopticon prison: security and economy are foremost, but tempered\nby humanity and accountability. Impressed by the dynamic of its\ncircular architecture which allowed the warden, obscured from view in\nthe shuttered watchtower, to observe the activities of prisoners day\nand night, Michel Foucault took the perspective that\n“panopticism” defined a “new physics of\npower”, an experimental “laboratory of power” in\nwhich behaviour could be modified, and he viewed the\npanopticon—that “cruel, ingenious cage”—as a\nsymbol of the repressive, disciplinary society, the modern\n“society of surveillance” (Foucault 208). This view of the\npanopticon has opened up some interesting lines of discourse on the\nencroaching methods of control and surveillance in contemporary\nliberal societies (Brunon-Ernst 2012). However, as a critique of\nBentham’s proposals it hardly does justice to the intricacies of\nthe project, as Semple (1993) has shown. \n\nThe end of economy determined that the panopticon prison should be a\nprivate self-sustaining operation not requiring financial assistance\nfrom the public purse. Security determined that the community be\nprotected from convicted criminals, and severity in punishment was to\nserve the ends of deterrence and reformation. But security also\nrequired that the inmate be protected from cruel treatment, and\nhumanity determined that prisoners should be deprived only of liberty\nnot health or life. Prisoners were to be kept clean and their labour\nmade productive and profitable, including the development of skills\nthat might be useful to them when released. In support of these\nobjectives, Bentham invoked several devices to effect transparency and\naccountability in prison government. The chief mechanism intended to\nbring the interest of the prison owner/administrator in line with his\nduty to be humane is publicity, described as “the most effectual\nmeans of applying the force of moral motives, in a direction tending\nto strengthen the union between his interest and the humane\nbranch of his duty; by bringing to light, and thus exposing to the\ncensure of the law and of public opinion … every instance of\ncontravention” (1838–43, VIII, 380). To the seemingly\n“constant” but unseen surveillance of the inmates by the\nwarden, Bentham added the observation of the warden and his\nsubordinates by the public. Interested members of the public and\nmembers of parliament were to be guaranteed free access to the prison,\nmaking the panopticon subject to “the great open\ncommittee of the tribunal of the world” (1838–43, IV,\n46). This was the prototype for Bentham’s later ruminations on\nthe benefits of the Public Opinion Tribunal in a system of\nrepresentative democracy.  \n\nAs with the panopticon, economy, transparency and accountability\nwere equally important in Bentham’s innovative account of\nadministration, as were devices to ensure the maximization of\n“intellectual”, “moral”, and\n“active” aptitude in public officials. In government\nutilitarian outcomes required various democratic procedures that\nfunction as “securities against misrule”. These procedures\ninclude: “virtual” universal suffrage, annual parliaments,\nthe secret ballot, and provisions for transparency, publicity and\nunconstrained public debate. \n\nMuch of what Bentham recommended in relation to administrative and\npolitical institutions is governed by “the\ninterest-junction-prescribing principle”, designed to\nensure that the interests of those with power would be reconciled with\nthe public interest. This idea was prominent in A Fragment on\nGovernment, where he argued that effective government was not to\nbe had on the foundation of abstract formulas such as “mixed and\nbalanced” institutions, but required “the frequent and\neasy changes of condition between governors and\ngoverned; whereby the interests of one class are more or less\nindistinguishably blended with those of the other” (1977,\n485). In the later constitutional writings Bentham added many more\nadministrative devices to ensure aptitude, transparency and\naccountability, none more important than the “Public Opinion\nTribunal”, or the open court of public opinion founded on the\nfreedom of the press, by which government actions could be held up to\npublic scrutiny (1983b, 36). And, just as the panopticon was to be\nmonitored by the publication of regular reports, so reports of\ngovernment activity were required to keep the democratic polity\ninformed and facilitate the accountability of public officials. \nWhen Bentham turned his thoughts to constitutional law in earnest in\nthe 1820s, partly inspired by constitution-making in parts of southern\nEurope, it was with the conviction that all states in which the\ninstitutions of representative democracy already existed or in which\nthey could be introduced were fertile soil for the utilitarian\npannomion. “Of this constitution”, he announced\nnear the beginning of the Constitutional Code, “the\nall-comprehensive object, or end in view, is, from first to last, the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number; namely, of the individuals,\nof whom, the political community, or state, of which it is the\nconstitution, is composed” (1983b, 18). The administrative,\nelectoral and legislative details of this project occupied much of the\nlast decade of his life, with its core ideas discussed in the pages of\na variety of works in addition to the Code, such as\nSecurities Against Misrule, First Principles Preparatory\nto Constitutional Code, and Official Aptitude Maximized;\nExpense Minimized. The subsidiary principles of accountability,\nefficiency, and economy underpinned the institutional design and\nprocedural operations elaborated in these writings. In essence, these\nprinciples provided the grounding for the “securities against\nmisrule” that Bentham thought essential to ensure that the\ngreatest happiness would be the governing objective of government in a\nrepublican representative democracy. \n\nBentham held that those who hold the “operative power” in\ngovernment, administration, and judiciary are, like everyone else,\nmotivated by personal interest. It is imperative, therefore, to devise\nmechanisms that will ensure that only by acting in the public interest\ncould they promote their own interests. So, for example, under\nrepresentative democracy the members of the legislature, as the\nrepresentatives of the “constitutive power” of the people,\ncould be counted on to promote the greatest happiness and hold other\nfunctionaries to account, since elected legislators only serve at the\nwill of their constituents and risk not being re-elected if they fail\nto do their duty (Schofield 1996, 226–28; see also Lieberman\n2008). Given the extensive powers Bentham envisaged the thirteen\nministries of the reformed government would possess—far more\npower in the areas of public health, education, and relief of the poor\nand indigent than existed at the time—further safeguards would\nbe required. Refining and expanding the suggestions contained in his\nPlan of Parliamentary Reform, he stipulated that public\nofficials must possess the required “moral aptitude” (the\ndisposition to promote the greatest happiness), “intellectual\naptitude” (divided into scientific aptitude or knowledge, and\njudicial aptitude or judgement), and “active aptitude”\n(the conscientious performance of assigned responsibilities) (1990,\n272). Intellectual and active aptitude were to be tested through an\nexamination process, though this would come to naught if the appointed\nofficial did not possess the appropriate moral aptitude\n(1838–43, IX, 128). Other devices designed to ensure, encourage,\nand test the required aptitude of public officials include: (1) the\nprecise definition of responsibilities attached to each office,\nagainst which the actions of officials could be judged by either a\nsuperordinate official or the public; (2) the principle of\nsubordination, according to which every official was subordinate to\nanother who could punish him for inefficiency in the performance of\nhis tasks; (3) complete exposure to legal prosecution of all officials\nfor wrong-doing; (4) the elimination of the practice of handing out\nunwarranted titles of honour to party supporters and other favourites;\n(5) complete publicity of government business and the elimination of\nsecrecy; and (6) freedom of the press, speech and association (see\nRosen 1983, Ch. 8). \n\nThe popular dimensions of the constitutional code appear to run\ncontrary to the legal positivism commonly associated with\nBentham’s utilitarianism, which implies a theory of sovereignty\nthat requires that power be located in the hands of the legislator,\nhowever constituted, and stipulates that all laws are imperative and\ndepend for their enforcement on coercive sanctions. Rosen has argued\nthat as early as A Fragment on Government, Bentham rejected\nthe Hobbesian idea of sovereignty based on simple command and\nobedience, in which the sovereign is necessarily a single, unified\nsupreme power, in favour of “the notions of the legal limitation\nand division of sovereign power” (Rosen 1983, 41, 44). \n\nGenerally, by the term “sovereignty” Bentham meant the\npower to legislate (legal sovereignty), but he also employed it in\nrelation to the power of the people to limit or control government and\npublic officials (political or popular sovereignty). In the first\nsense of the term it is seemingly impossible for there to be a law\nthat deliberately functions contrary to the will of the legislature.\nAll law emanates from the will of the sovereign and the will of the\nsovereign “cannot be illegal” (2010b, 38). However,\nBentham also held that all political authority, no matter what form it\ntakes, is necessarily limited by its capacity to compel obedience from\nthe people. As he put it in A Fragment on Government,\n“By a sovereign I mean any person or assemblage of persons to\nwhose will a whole political community are (no matter on what account)\nsupposed to be in a disposition to pay obedience” (1977, 18).\nAnd in Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence he\nexplained that this implies two volitions, both of which are necessary\ncomponents of a complete theory of sovereignty: on the one hand, the\nenactments of a legislature and, on the other, the will of the people\nto obey those enactments. In effect, the will of the people to disobey\namounts to a permanent constitutional check on the authority of the\nsovereign, and in this sense “the submission and obedience of\nthe people” acts as the “constituent cause” of\nsovereignty (2010b 150n). The legislature may be “supreme”\nbut it “can never of itself be absolute and unlimited” or\n“amount to the entire power of imperation” (113). The\nresult is a “split concept” of sovereignty defined by a\ndynamic interaction between the legislature and the people, subject to\nchanging times and the reflection of this in the public’s\nattitude to law, to what is admissible and inadmissible (see Ben-Dor\n2000, Ch. 2). The process of public deliberation and accountability\nthis requires is greatly facilitated by the communicative freedoms of\nthe “liberty of the press” and the “liberty of\npublic association” (1977, 485)—crystalized in\nBentham’s conception of the “Public Opinion\nTribunal” (POT). \n\nBased on his earlier enunciation of “the motto of the good\ncitizen”—“To obey punctually, to\ncensure freely” (1977, 399)—Bentham conceived the POT\nas a “fictitious tribunal” or public court of opinion,\nargument, and debate. “Able rulers lead it”, he advised,\n“prudent rulers use or follow it; foolish rulers disregard\nit”. The POT would scrutinize the actions of elected\nrepresentatives, public and judicial officials, prosecuting charges\nwhere they are found remiss in their responsibilities, censoring\nmisrule and imposing penalties when applicable. Penalties would\ngenerally take the form of the “moral sanction”—the\nbroadcasting of the shame and disgrace of conduct, and the imputation\nof the reputation of the person responsible (1983b,35–39; 1989,\n283). In these terms, the POT would be the leading security against\nthe misuse and abuse of power (1989, 125). Operating on a continuing\nbasis, and therefore not constrained as a check in the same limited\nway as periodic elections, it would act as “the only force\n… [by] which … government when operating in a sinister\ndirection can experience any the least impediment to its course”\n(1990, 121). \n\nVital to the functioning of the POT is the dissemination of\ninformation. In the first instance this would require the\nestablishment of a public archive of government actions and activities\ncontaining records of law, policy, legislative debate, and statistics,\nwhich the government would be constitutionally required to make\navailable to the public by a freedom of information provision in the\nconstitutional code to ensure transparency. Secondly, it would require\nan unshackled press to ensure widespread publicity and the freedom to\ncriticize unimpeded by censorship or gagging orders. Here Bentham\ndrew upon his essay On the Liberty of the Press, and Public\nDiscussion (1821) to point out the dangers of laws designed to\nlimit these liberties. The liberty of the press is an indispensable\ncheck on arbitrary government, and therefore “necessary to the\nmaintenance of good government” (1838–43, II, 277, 279).\nPublicity is vital in this process, since “the greater the\nnumber of the members of the whole community to whom the existence of\nan act of oppression has been made known, the greater is the number of\nthose by whom … not only may obedience be withholden, but\nresistance opposed” (1990, 30). \n\nBentham did not consider that the effectiveness of the POT as a check\non misrule could be undermined by secret government methods to limit\nthe flow of information, nor did it occur to him that a press\ndominated by the views of one class could subvert the veracity of the\ninformation it disseminated. He pinned his faith on transparency and\npublicity (Postema 2014, 49). Ideally, the public would be adequately\ninformed, and the POT would be constituted by those among the public\nwho were both knowledgeable and concerned about the issues before\nit. Its judgements could change as new evidence came to light or as\nnew arguments were enunciated, and it could be fragmented or unified\nin its view in proportion to the variety of individual opinions\nexpressed. \n\nBefore the publication of Dumont’s edition of the\nTraités de législation in 1802, Bentham’s\nwritings had a very limited distribution. During the revolutionary years in France, Dumont fed his ideas into the debates over judicial, legal, penal and legislative reform, and if his proposals had little impact on the social and political improvements undertaken they yet contributed to the direction of French liberalism (Champs 2015).  With the publication of the Traités de législation Bentham’s stock as a legal philosopher increased dramatically.  3000 copies of the\nTraités were sold almost immediately (1838–43,\nI, 388), the Emperor Alexander ordered a Russian translation, and this\nwas followed by translations (or partial translations) into Spanish,\nGerman, Polish, Portuguese and Hungarian, with\nparticularly impressive sales in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America\n(1838–43, XI, 33, 88; see Avila-Martel 1981; McKennon 1981;\nLuño 1981). The 1820 edition of the Traités\nlists nineteen booksellers in eleven European countries from whom the\nbook could be purchased. It was from this platform that Bentham was\nable to promote himself as a potential codifier of the laws in\ncountries near and far.  Despite the herculean efforts of Dumont, however, his ideas received a mixed reception in France (see Champs 2015, Ch.15).  The aging André Morellet was keen to see the principles of utilitarian legal philosophy implemented in French law and administration, and  Marc-Antoine Jullien and Jean-Baptiste Say among others appealed to Bentham in their attempt to ground political economy on scientific principles.  On the other hand, self-interest and the utility principle was rejected by Germaine de Stael as an impoverished grounding for moral duty, and rejected by other reformers such as Benjamin Constant who grounded their liberalism on natural rights. \n\nBentham’s ideas began circulating in Spain in 1810 through\nthe London-based El Español (Dinwiddy 1984, 20), but\ninterest increased during the liberal triennium of 1820–23. In\n1820, Toribio Núñez published a two-volume account of\nutilitarian legal philosophy based on the\nTraités—titled Espiritu de Bentham\nó sistéma de la ciencia social, ideado por\nJeremías Bentham—and his own writings on moral and\npolitical philosophy were greatly influenced by Bentham’s ideas.\nIn 1821–22, Ramón de Salas produced the first Spanish\ntranslation of the Traités in five volumes, which\nreceived a scathing critique by José Vidal, a Dominican\ntheologian at the University of Valencia, who condemned the work as an\nencouragement to revolution (Orígen de los errores\nrevolucionarios de Europe, y su remedio 1827). Earlier, in 1793,\nBentham had counselled the French National Convention to divest itself\nof its colonies on the grounds of their disutility (though the text\nEmancipate Your Colonies! was only published in 1830; Bentham\n2002, 289–315). In the 1820s he directed his arguments towards\nSpain in “Rid Yourselves of Ultramaria” and\n“Emancipation Spanish” (1995, 3–276), and was\ngratified to see his ideas gaining traction in its former colonies in\nLatin America.  \n\nAndrés Bello used Salas’ translation as the basic\ntext for his law lectures at the Colegio de Santiago in Chile, as did\nPedro Alcántra de Somellera, Professor of Civil Law at the\nUniversity of Buenos Aires. In 1825 Francisco de Paula Santander, the\nVice-President of Gran Colombia, decreed that the work be required\nreading for all law students in the vast territories of the new\nrepublic, but in 1828 its President Simón Bolívar, the\nlegendary “Liberator”, after previously embracing the\nprinciples and purpose of Bentham’s legal philosophy, bowed to\nclerical pressure and banned its teaching as detrimental to religion,\nmorality, and social order (1838–43, X,\n552–54). Santander, who was more inclined to resist the\ninfluence of the Catholic Church, restored it to the curriculum of the\nuniversities when he became President of the newly constituted state\nof Colombia in 1832. \n\nFollowing the Greek revolution against Ottoman rule, the historian\nand legal scholar Anastasios Polyzoides, who had a hand in drafting its\nnew constitution in 1822, translated an extract on\n“publicity” from Dumont’s Tactiques des\nassemblée legislatives for a Missolonghi newspaper in 1824,\npromoting transparency in legislative proceedings and in government\nmore broadly. A year later he published in Greek A General\nTheory of Administrative Systems and especially of the Parliamentary\nOne, Accompanied by a Short Treatise on Justices of the Peace and\nJuries in England (1825), containing a defense of representative\ngovernment and advocating a judicial system based on utilitarian\nprinciples, replete with references to Bentham (Peonidis 2009). \n\nIn the United States, the dissemination of utilitarianism was\ninitially hampered by the absence of an English translation of the\nTraités, but there too Bentham’s influence was\nnot long in being felt. David Hoffman first introduced utilitarian\nideas into legal education in America at the University of Maryland in\nthe early 1820s. John Neal, who studied law under Hoffman’s\nguidance, described Hoffman as one of Bentham’s “most\nenthusiastic admirers” (Neal 1830, 300). In his\nbibliographic A Course of Legal Study (1817), Hoffman\nrecommended students read parts of Dumont’s edition of\nThéorie des peines et des récompenses (2 vols.,\n1811), and it was Hoffman who encouraged Neal to translate the\nTraités into English, a task he began during the\neighteen months he stayed with Bentham in London in\n1825–26. In the event, only the introductory sections of\nthe Traités appeared in Neal’s Principles of\nLegislation (1830), which had first appeared in a series of\narticles in The Yankee, a journal he edited under the banner\nheading “the greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber”. \n\nIt was Richard Smith, a government tax officer and one of\nBentham’s young London disciples, who eventually translated the\ncivil and penal law parts of the Traités into English\nfor the The Works of Jeremy Bentham in 1838 (1838–43,\nI, 297–580). While Smith was at work in England, the historian\nand anti-slave propagandist Richard Hildreth, Bentham’s foremost\nAmerican disciple, was busy translating the same material on the other\nside of the Atlantic, convinced that the widespread interest in legal\nreform in the United States would benefit greatly from utilitarian\nideas. The reviews of Hildreth’s translation praised\nBentham’s legal philosophy while objecting to its underlying\nmoral assumptions and disdain for religion, a position frequently\nadopted by early critics—even Hildreth took this less than\nconsistent view (1840, I, iii). The reviews paid particular attention\nto the systematic presentation of the theory of civil law, which also\nimpressed itself on the teaching of law in the newly independent\nstates of South America, where property rights were a matter of\nconsiderable importance in the aftermath of the collapse of the\nSpanish and Portuguese empires. \n\nHildreth, whose own Theory of Morals (1844) drew\nsubstantially on the Traités, was correct in thinking\nthat law reformers in the United States would find sustenance in\nBentham’s critical jurisprudence. Thomas Cooper, who left\nEngland for the United States in 1794 with Joseph Priestley, from whom\nhe initially derived his utilitarianism, was a confirmed Benthamite by\nthe 1820s and the intended recipient of writings Bentham entrusted to\nJohn Quincy Adams. Thereafter Cooper employed utilitarian principles\nin his writings on law and political economy, most notably in\nLectures on the Elements of Political Economy (1826). Edward\nLivingston, the famous author of codes of law for Louisiana,\ncorresponded with Bentham, who sent him books for his research.\nLivingston acknowledged it was his reading of the\nTraités which “fortified me in a design to\nprosecute the subject” of a code of penal law (1838–43,\nXI, 51). In its final comprehensive and systematic version,\nLivingston’s System of Penal Law (1833) was celebrated\nby many continental jurists and became the centrepiece of the\ncodification campaign in the United States—a campaign Bentham\nhad attempted to launch himself some years earlier by directing copies\nof his Papers Relative to Codification and Public Instruction\n(1817) to a number of well-placed American politicians. The freethinker\nGilbert Vale used his position as editor of the radical periodical\nThe Diamond (1840–42)—like The Yankee,\npublished with the banner heading “the greatest happiness of the\ngreatest number”—to disseminate Bentham’s criticisms\nof the vagaries, chicanery, and technicalities of the law. Inspired by\nBentham, Vale was in favour of humane penal laws that proportioned\npenalties to the objective of deterrence and an advocate of state\nintervention to alter the social circumstances that fostered\ncrime. John O’Sullivan, the quixotic editor of the United\nStates Magazine and Democratic Review, wrote sympathetic reviews\nof Bentham, Livingston, and Hildreth, and followed them in advocating\nutilitarian law reform, particularly the abolition of the death\npenalty. \n\nBentham’s influence continued throughout the century in America,\nwhere the Traités paved the way for the reception of\nother editions and versions of his writings, which in turn led to\nsympathetic responses to the more amenable forms of utilitarian moral\nand legal theory offered by John Austin, J. S. Mill, and Henry\nSidgwick. On the other hand,\nBentham’s political prescriptions made little impact in\nthe United States, which was, by comparison to aristocratic England,\nalready an advanced democracy. If the utilitarian Constitutional\nCode was directed “for the use of all nations and all\ngovernments professing liberal opinions”, as its title page\ndeclared, the political positions it embraced were recommended, in the\nfirst instance, for adoption at home. \n\nFor all Bentham’s success abroad, in the early years of the\n19th century he was little known in his own country. The\nApril 1804 issue of the Edinburgh Review announced his\narrival on the British stage in a substantial critical review of\nDumont’s Traités, though his main appeal was\ninitially confined to a small band of law reformers determined to\ntackle the antiquated and notoriously harsh punishments meted out by\nEnglish penal law. In the years following the defeat of Napoleon in\n1815, however, when calls for legal, social, and political reform were\nbecoming commonplace, Bentham’s reputation in Britain was\ntransformed from that of an eccentric and often misunderstood oracle\non the periphery of the intellectual and political world to that of a\nvenerable sage situated at the center of a broad reform movement.\nThroughout the following century his influence continued to be felt,\nparticular in discussions of moral and legal philosophy and economic\ntheory and practice. \n\nJohn Austin became acquainted with Bentham’s utilitarian legal\nphilosophy during his undergraduate years at Cambridge. In 1821 he was\nhired to tutor J.S. Mill in Roman law, began attending meetings of the\nUtilitarian Society established by the younger Mill in 1823, and in\n1826 was appointed to the Chair of Jurisprudence at the newly founded\nUniversity of London, where he was the first in England to introduce\nutilitarian ideas into legal education. Building on Bentham’s\nscience of legislation, Austin imported its leading ideas into his own\njurisprudence, none more so than Bentham’s distinction between\nthe law as it is and the law as it ought to be, an\nidea that stands at the foundation of the doctrine of legal positivism\n(1977, 397). With the posthumous publication of Lectures on\nJurisprudence or The Philosophy of Positive Law (1863),\nAustin’s legal philosophy was to have a major impact on English\nand American jurisprudence—in the latter context his\nconceptualization of the nature of sovereignty proved especially\ninfluential. \n\nBentham’s most important influence was on John Stuart Mill. In\nhis Autobiography (1873) Mill relates that when he first\nencountered Bentham’s ideas in the Traités\n“I now had opinions, a creed, a doctrine, a philosophy; in one\namong the best senses of the word, a religion; the inculcation and\ndiffusion of which could be made the principal outward purpose of a\nlife” (1963–91, I, 67–68). It was in the flush of\nhis early commitment to utilitarianism that Mill edited the five\nvolumes of Bentham’s writings on evidence, Rationale of\nJudicial Evidence (1838–43, VI, 189–585, VII\n1–644). Around this time, however, partly in response to the\nchallenge of T. B. Macaulay’s criticism of his father’s\n“On Government” and partly the result of his own\nreflections on his intellectual inheritance, Mill developed a revised\nversion of utilitarian theory. This revisionism was first announced to\nthe world in the essay “Bentham” (1838) and received\ndefinitive expression in Utilitarianism (1861), in which he\nintroduced the notion of higher pleasures. Though, like Bentham, an\nadvocate of representative democracy based on universal suffrage, Mill\nalso made several proposals to temper the potential excesses of\nunconstrained majoritarian institutions. In other respects, including\nhis defence of individual freedom and individuality in On\nLiberty (1859), Mill’s utilitarianism remained within the\nBenthamic framework.  \n\nBentham’s influence has been felt to a considerable extent\nin the field of economics, in which the felicific calculus provided\nthe groundwork for the development of policy based on cost-benefit\nanalysis. As we have seen, he shared Adam Smith’s view that the\nroute to a nation’s prosperity is by individuals pursuing their\ninterests in ways of their own choosing, with government intervention\nlimited accordingly. However, he also developed the theory of\ndiminishing marginal utility, furnishing the legislator with a\nconceptual tool by which to address the uneven distribution of social\nhappiness. The collectivist conclusions Bentham drew from this\nprinciple were modest in scope, but later reformist economists like W.\nS. Jevons (1871), impressed by the idea that social utility could be\ncalculated based on the aggregate of individual interests, developed\nthe theory in the direction of modern welfare economics. F. Y.\nEdgeworth (1881) thought Bentham’s formula of the\n“greatest happiness of the greatest number” a mathematical\nabsurdity, and reformulated the goal in terms of the greatest total\nhappiness (or greatest average happiness for a fixed number of\npeople). The Fabian socialist Sidney Webb also applied utilitarian\nideas to maximize and better distribute “total\nutility”—Webb’s wife Beatrice once described Bentham\nas her husband’s “intellectual godfather” (Mack\n1955). Graham Wallas, another of the Fabians, was deeply impressed by\nBentham’s legal, political and administrative innovations and\nhailed him as “Britain’s greatest political\ninventor” (Wallas 1926). \n\nOn the other side of the ledger we find the libertarian Herbert\nSpencer who deployed the utility principle in Man versus the\nState (1884) and other writings to underwrite the liberty of the\nindividual, defend the existing social order, and attack the drift\ntowards socialism and “slavery”. James Fitzjames Stephen,\nHenry Sidgwick, and A.V. Dicey all advocated versions of utilitarian\nindividualism, although Sidgwick occasionally gave voice to\n“socialist” sentiments in developing his\nintuitional utilitarian theory in The Methods of\nEthics (1874). Reform-minded liberals such as J.A. Hobson and\nL.T. Hobhouse viewed themselves as “new” utilitarians,\nfinding in the protean nature of utilitarianism a justification for\ndistinctly non-individualist policies. Thus Hobhouse in\nLiberalism (1911) incorporated utilitarianism into a new\nliberal discourse that, in addition to laissez-faire\neconomics (and notwithstanding Herbert Samuel’s quasi-Benthamic\nmotto “the greatest liberty of the greatest number”) also\nincluded elements of socialism, social Darwinianism, and the reformist\nidealism of T. H. Green. \n\nOnce Bentham’s ideas began to take hold in the early nineteenth\ncentury, critics were not hard to find. In his Principles of\nPolitics Applicable to All Governments (1810), Benjamin Constant, who admired Bentham’s originality\nand praised his contributions to political economy and penal law,\nquestioned the vagueness of the concept of utility, which he thought\nsusceptible to many different definitions and pregnant with danger as\na principle of policy. Constant preferred the prescriptions of natural law as the philosophical basis for government.  William Hazlitt, who was for a time\nBentham’s tenant, satirised him as a venerable anchorite in the\nquiet of his cell reducing law to a system and the mind of man to a\nmachine, divorced from the life of spirit, imagination, passion and\nsentiments of love, a philosophy “fit neither for man nor\nbeast” (1826, 184). Thomas Carlyle summed up the general\nperception of the crassness of “Benthamee utility” as the\n“pig-philosophy”, nothing more than “virtue by\nProfit and Loss” (1840, 65). Other critics, like the Whig\nreformers James Mackintosh and T.B. Macaulay, ready to follow\nBentham’s lead in law reform, were also highly critical of the\ndiminished view of human nature that underpinned his philosophy and\nattacked the radical proposals for political reform that emanated from\nthe utilitarian camp (Lively and Rees 1978). The Anglican divine John\nColls, for a time Bentham’s secretary before he took holy\norders, published an intemperate exposé of his former employer\nas a selfish and bigoted subversive in Utilitarianism\nUnmasked (1844), a work which proved popular among his fellow\nclergymen. \n\nAs the 19th century wore on assailants came forth from all\npoints across the philosophical spectrum. Marx considered Bentham an\n“arch-philistine” and utilitarianism a superficial and\nephemeral bourgeois ideology (Capital I, Ch. XXIV,\nsect. 5). Sundry religionists, including those of a philosophical bent\nlike the classicist J.B. Mayor, intuitionists like William Whewell,\nand idealists like Green, F.H. Bradley, Bernard Bosanquet and\nD.G. Ritchie combined to attack its atomism, crude materialism,\nnarrowly construed theory of motivation, and lack of appreciation of\nthe spiritual dimension of the human condition. The legal scholar\nHenry Maine could admire the bravado and ambition of Bentham’s\nscience of jurisprudence, but also deplored his failure to appreciate\nthe historical and evolutionary nature of law; he further objected to\nBentham’s faith that the ignorant masses could truly know what\nis in their best interest. As we have seen, on the other side of the\nAtlantic, Bentham’s legal philosophy made some headway but the\nunderlying moral ideas met stiff resistance, and his supposed atheism\nadded fuel to the fire of outrage bellowing from evangelical\ncritics. In a different vein, the Pragmatists, notably William James\nand John Dewey, may have shared Bentham’s ontological misgivings\nabout fictitious entities (Quinn 2012) and recognised the critical\nvalue of the utility principle to the development of Liberalism as a\nphilosophy of action (Dewey 1935, 13–17), but they rejected the\nclaim that all motivation may be reduced to a drive to seek pleasure\nand avoid pain, which they viewed as a self-defeating commitment to\nmaterialist individualism (Dewey and Tufts 1908, 271–74). Like\nJ. S. Mill, the Pragmatists also dismissed the idea that any single\nform of the summum bonum could account for the many goods\nthat people seek (James 1891, 186–200). There have been many\ncritics of Bentham since. \n\nNumerous commentaries on Bentham’s philosophy have also\nappeared, from the early general accounts of Leslie Stephen (1900) and\nElie Halévy (1901–4), to more recent introductions to his\nideas (Harrison 1983; Dinwiddy 1989b; Crimmins 2004; Schofield 2009)\nand a wide range of revisionist disquisitions on discrete aspects of\nhis thought. In addition to the themes and issues already addressed in\nthis article, Hart (1982) and Postema (1989) have penned important\nstudies of Bentham’s jurisprudence, while topics that have\nengaged contemporary commentators include his critical views on race\nand slavery (Jones 2005; Rosen 2005), colonialism and empire (Pitts\n2005; Cain 2011), marriage, divorce, adultery, desertion and\nwife-beating (Sokol 2011), and sexual liberty (Dabhoiwala 2010,\n168–74; Schofield 2014). Schofield (2013) provides an overview\nof some new directions in Bentham studies, to which may be added essays on the global Bentham (Armitage 2011; Zhai and Palmer 2019) and essays on Bentham and the arts (Julius, Quinn and Schofield 2020). Many of these commentaries have been inspired by the\npublication of the authoritative volumes in The Collected Works of\nJeremy Bentham that began appearing in 1968 to replace the poorly\nedited and incomplete Bowring edition (1838–43). The\nCollected Works continues to bring to light new and more\ncomplete versions of Bentham’s writings and previously\nunpublished material. At the time of writing, 34 of the projected 80\nvolumes have been published. As new volumes appear the topics of\ndiscussion and debate will continue to increase, burnishing the\nreputation of a philosopher whose ideas remain relevant in a great\nnumber of areas of interest to moralists, psychologists, economists,\nhistorians, legal and political philosophers.","contact.mail":"jcrimmin@uwo.ca","contact.domain":"uwo.ca"}]
