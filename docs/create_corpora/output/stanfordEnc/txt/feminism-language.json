Initially, most work in the area was critical, calling\nfor changes either to language itself or to philosophy of language.\nMore recently, however, the dynamic has changed, with the advent of\nseveral major positive research programmes within philosophy of\nlanguage. In this entry, we first discuss the critiques that\nconstitute the first phase of feminist work in this area, before\nmoving onto the positive research programmes that have recently come\nto the fore. Our focus in this entry will generally be on the analytic\ntradition. For continental approaches, see the entries on\n feminist approaches to the intersection of analytic and continental philosophy,\n feminist approaches to the intersection of pragmatism and continental philosophy.\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a great deal of feminist concern over the supposedly\ngender-neutral use of terms like ‘he’ and\n‘man’. It is commonly said that these terms have both\ngender-specific meanings, as in sentences (1) and (2), and\ngender-neutral ones, as in sentences (3) and (4). \nFeminists, however, have pointed out that even the supposed\ngender-neutral meanings of these terms are not really gender-neutral.\nJanice Moulton (1981a) and Adele Mercier (1995) provide examples in\nwhich there is no doubt that a gender-neutral meaning is intended, but\nthis meaning seems unavailable. As a result, the sentences seem\nill-formed: \nWe are, then, making a classificatory error if we claim that\n‘man’ and ‘he’ are gender-neutral terms. In\norder to avoid such a classificatory error, we need to do more careful\nwork on what the meanings of these terms actually are. Perhaps the\nmeaning of ‘he’ that has been called\n‘gender-neutral’ is not really gender-neutral, but\nsomething much more complex. Mercier suggests, for example, that we\nshould understand the ‘gender-neutral’ use of\n‘man’ as referring to either (a) a person or persons of\nunknown sex; or (b) males or a combination of males and females. This\nexplains why ‘men’ in (5) and ‘man’ in (6) are\nanomalous: these terms are being used to refer exclusively to persons\nknown to be female. \nThe supposed ‘gender-neutral’ meaning of these terms,\nthen, is not truly gender neutral. But, on its own, this does not show\nthat there is a problem with those uses that have traditionally been\nclassified as gender-neutral, as in sentences (3) and (4).\n(Discovering that we have misclassified an adjective as an adverb\nwould not show anything wrong with actual uses of the term in\nquestion.) Further reasons are needed in order to object to the use\nthat is made of these terms. \nFeminist concerns, however, go beyond mere classificatory ones.\nFeminists have also argued that terms like ‘he’ and\n‘man’ contribute to making women invisible—that is,\nto obscuring women’s importance, and distracting attention from\ntheir existence. Fighting the invisibility of women is an important\nfeminist project in many\n areas,[1]\n and language that makes one less likely to think of women clearly\ncontributes to this invisibility. There is good psycholinguistic\nevidence that those who encounter sentences (like\n (3)\n and\n (4))\n using the terms ‘he’ and ‘man’ think more\nreadily of males than of\n females.[2]\n If this is right, then the use of these words can be seen as\ncontributing to the invisibility of women. This gives feminists a good\nreason to object to the ‘gender-neutral’ use of these\nterms. \nIf one’s only worry concerned the obscuring of women’s\npresence, however, it would be difficult to object to certain other\nterms to which feminists do commonly object: gender-specific\noccupational terms like ‘manageress’ (still common in the\nUK, though not in the US) or ‘lady doctor’. These terms\ncertainly do not contribute to the invisibility of women. Instead,\nthey call attention to the presence of women. Moreover, they call\nattention to women’s presence in positions of\nauthority—doctor and manager. Nonetheless, most feminists who\nthink about language find these terms objectionable. \nThe clearest reason for objecting to ‘manageress’ and\n‘lady doctor’ is that the use of these terms seems\npremised on the idea that maleness is the norm, and that women filling\nthese jobs are somehow deviant versions of doctors and managers. This\nis also a key objection to the use of ‘he’ and\n‘man’. Moulton (1981a) understands these terms on the\nmodel of brand names, like ‘Hoover’ or ‘Scotch\ntape’ that become generic terms for a product type. The message\nof such terms, she suggests, is that the brand in question is the\nbest, or at least the norm. According to Moulton, terms like\n‘he’ and ‘man’ work in the same manner: they\nare gender-specific terms for men whose use has been extended to cover\nboth men and women. This, Moulton argues, carries the message that\nmaleness is the norm. As a result, the use of these terms as if they\nwere gender neutral constitutes a sort of symbolic insult to women.\nLaurence Horn and Steven R. Kleinedler (2000) have disputed the\ndetails of this, noting that ‘man’ did not begin its life\nas gender-specific and then get extended to cover both women and men.\nRather, ‘man’ actually began its life as\n‘mann’, a gender-neutral term, which only later acquired a\ngender-specific meaning. The temporal sequence, then, cannot support\nthe claim that a gender-specific term has been extended to cover both\ngenders. Nonetheless, Horn and Kleinedler agree that the use of terms\nlike ‘he’ and ‘man’ as if they were\ngender-neutral perpetuates the objectionable idea that men are the\nnorm for humanity. \nEnglish, like most—but not all—languages, requires a great\ndeal of what Marilyn Frye calls ‘sex marking’ (Frye 1983).  For example, one cannot use pronouns to refer to a particular\nindividual without knowing their sex. (Frye, in common with most feminists of the early 1980s, does not consider trans issues.  She also does not consider the possibility that pronouns like ‘he’ and ‘she’ might be a matter of gender, not sex.) Frye notes the absurdity of this. \nIf I am writing a book review, the use of personal pronouns to refer\nto the author creates the need to know whether that person’s\nreproductive cells are the sort which produce ova or the sort which\nproduce sperm. (Frye 1983: 22) \nSingular personal pronoun usage, Frye argues, is impossible without\nknowing the sex of the person one is discussing, and in many cases sex\nwould otherwise be utterly irrelevant. Frye takes this to be an\ninstance of a general tendency to make sex relevant where it need not\nbe, which she takes to be a key feature of sexism. In addition, she\nsuggests, the constant need to know and indicate sex helps to\nperpetuate the conviction that sex is a tremendously important matter\nin all areas. For Frye, this is a key factor in perpetuating male\ndominance: male dominance requires the belief that men and women are\nimportantly different from each other, so anything that contributes to\nthe impression that sex differences are important is therefore a\ncontributor to male dominance. \nThe idea that some terms encode a male worldview is initially a\npuzzling one. One thing that is meant by it is, roughly, that the\nmeanings of certain terms seem to divide the world up in a way that is\nmore natural for men than for women. Good examples of this come from\nthe terms ‘foreplay’ and ‘sex’.\n‘Sex’ is generally taken to refer to an act that is\ndefined in terms of male orgasm, while the sexual activities during\nwhich many women have their orgasms are relegated to secondary status,\nreferred to by terms like ‘foreplay’. These terms, then,\ncan be seen as based in a male perspective on sex. (It is worth noting\nthat the ‘male perspective’ claim need not rest on the\n(implausible) idea that this perspective is shared by all men. Rather,\nit can rest on claims about what is typical for men, or on the claim\nthat the only perspective from which certain understandings make sense\nis a male one.) As a result, these terms may serve as a barrier to\naccurate communication or even thought about women’s experiences\nof sex (Cameron 1985; Moulton 1981b; Spender 1980 [1985]). Catharine\nMacKinnon and Sally Haslanger also discuss legal definitions of\n‘rape’ as (among other things) involving more than\n‘the normal level of force’, an understanding that seems\ncommitted to the idea that some level of force is acceptable in sexual\nrelations (Haslanger 1995: 109; MacKinnon 1989: 173). \nLanguages may also lack words for things that matter a great deal to\nwomen. This sort of gap is another way that a language can be seen as\nencoding a male worldview. The term ‘sexual harassment’,\nfor example, is a recent feminist innovation. Women’s discussion\nof their experiences led them to see a certain common element to many\nof their problems, and as a result they invented the term\n‘sexual harassment’. Once the problem was named, it became\nmuch easier to fight sexual harassment, both legally and by educating\npeople about it (Farley 1978; Spender 1985). \nMiranda Fricker (2007) calls gaps such as that before the invention of\nthe term ‘sexual harassment’ a form of hermeneutical\ninjustice. Roughly speaking, this is what occurs when “some\nsignificant area of one’s social experience [is] obscured from\ncollective understanding owing to” (2007: 155) a gap in communal\nlinguistic/conceptual resources that is more damaging to those from a\nsocially disadvantaged group (to which one belongs). In her\nEpistemic Injustice, Fricker connects this up with issues in\nboth ethics and epistemology, especially epistemology of\ntestimony.  We discuss this more fully in 2.4, below.  \nProblems like those we have seen so far are relatively easy to\ndiscern. Moreover, it may seem that they would be relatively easy to\ncorrect—new terms can be invented, or alternative words can be\nused. Much feminist effort has been devoted to this endeavour, and a\nhuge variety of reforms have been proposed (see, for example, Miller\nand Swift 1976, 1980, and the papers in part two of Cameron\n1998a). \nOne especially successful reform effort has been the increasingly\naccepted singular use of the third-person gender-neutral pronoun\n‘they’ (in place of ‘he’) as in the sentence\nbelow: \nSomebody left their sweater behind. \nA key reason for the success of this reform is perhaps the history of\nthe singular ‘they’. As Ann Bodine has noted (1975 [1998]), the\nsingular use of ‘they’ has a long history. It did not\nbegin to be criticized until the 19th century, and despite\nall the efforts of prescriptive grammarians it has remained very\npopular in speech. Due to feminist work on the effects of\n‘gender-neutral’ use of ‘he’, even\nprescriptive grammarians are now becoming more accepting of\n‘they’. In very recent years, it is also becoming\nincreasingly widespread to use ‘they’ as one’s\nchosen personal pronoun, or, less frequently, to use another\ngender-neutral option such as ‘ze’ (Bennett 2016; Dembroff and Wodak 2017). \nOther reform efforts have met with greater difficulties. Even some\nthat have caught on seem to have backfired. Susan Erlich and Ruth King\n(1992 [1998]), for example, discuss the case of ‘chairperson’,\nintended to serve as a gender-neutral replacement for\n‘chairman’. Instead, in many places it is often used to\nindicate women who fill the post of chair, while men are referred to\nas ‘chairman’. They take this to show that reforms cannot\nsucceed unless attitudes change as well. \nMoreover, feminist work on language has also indicated that there may\nbe problems which are simply not amenable to piecemeal linguistic\nreforms. Some difficulties that have been raised go well beyond a\nhandful of problematic terms or gaps. Deborah Cameron offers striking\nexamples of writing that take males as the norm without using any\nparticular terms to which one might object, such as the following,\nfrom The Sunday Times: \nThe lack of vitality is aggravated by the fact that there are so few\nable-bodied young adults about. They have all gone off to work or look\nfor work, leaving behind the old, the disabled, the women and the\nchildren. (Cameron 1985: 85) \nClearly, in the above example, ‘able-bodied young adult’\nis being used in such a way as to exclude women. Moreover, examples\nlike this (and others Cameron provides) pass unnoticed by newspaper\neditors and many readers. There is clearly a problem, but it is not a\nproblem that can be pinpointed by picking out some particular term as\nobjectionable and in need of reform. Eliminating language use that\ntakes males as the norm, then, must involve more than changing a few\nterms or usage rules. \nSome feminists (e.g., Penelope 1990; Spender 1985) argue that English\nis, in some quite general sense, male. (Corresponding arguments are\nalso put forward about other languages.) One thing that is meant by\nthis is that English can be said to be male in a manner similar to\nthat in which particular terms can be said to be male—by\nencoding a male worldview, by helping to subordinate women or to\nrender them invisible, or by taking males as the norm. One sort of\nargument for this begins from the examination of large quantities of\nspecific terms, and the identification of patterns of male bias, and\nproceeds from this to the conclusion that the male bias of English is\nso widespread that it is a mistake to locate the problem in a\ncollection of words, rather than in the language as a whole. The first\nstage of this sort of argument is, obviously, a lengthy and complex\none. The sorts of claims (in addition to those we have already seen)\ncited include (a) that there are more words for males than for females\nin English, and that more of these words are positive (Spender 1985:\n15, citing Julia Stanley 1977); (b) that a “word for women\nassume[s] negative connotations even where it designated the same\nstate or condition as it did for men” (Spender 1985: 17), as\nwith ‘spinster’ and ‘bachelor’; (c) that words\nfor women are far more frequently sexualized than words for men, and\nthat this holds true even for neutral words, when they are applied to\nwomen. Dale Spender, citing Lakoff (1975), discusses the example of\n‘professional’, comparing ‘he’s a\nprofessional’ and ‘she’s a professional’, and\nnoting that the latter is far more likely than the former to be taken\nto mean that the person in question is a prostitute. The sexualisation\nof words for women is considered especially significant by the many\nfeminists who take sexual objectification to be a crucial element, if\nnot the root, of inequalities between women and men. (For more on such\nexamples, see also Baker 1992.) \nThis widespread encoding of male bias in language is, according to\ntheorists like Spender, just what we should expect. Males (though not,\nas she notes, all of them) have had far more power in society, and\nthis, she claims has included the power to enforce, through language,\ntheir view of the world. Moreover, she argues, this has served to\nenhance their power. \nThere is sexism in language, it does enhance the\nposition of males, and males have had control over the\nproduction of cultural forms. (Spender 1985: 144) \nThis, Spender claims, provides circumstantial evidence that\n“males have encoded sexism into language to consolidate their\nclaims of male supremacy” (Spender 1985: 144). Spender takes the\nevidence for this claim to be far more than circumstantial, however,\nand to support it she discusses the efforts of prescriptive\ngrammarians. These include, for example, the claim that males should\nbe listed before females because “the male gender was the\nworthier gender” (Spender 1985: 147, emphasis hers),\nand the efforts (noted earlier) to establish ‘he’ as the\ngender-neutral third-person English pronoun. \nAccording to theorists like Spender, men’s ability to control\nlanguage gives them great power indeed. We have already seen ways in\nwhich what one might call the maleness of language contributes to the\ninvisibility of women (with respect to words like ‘he’ and\n‘man’). If one takes the maleness of language to go beyond\na few specific terms, one will take language’s power to make\nwomen invisible to be even stronger. We have also seen ways that what\nmight be called maleness can make it more difficult for women to\nexpress themselves. Where we lack words for important female\nexperiences, like sexual harassment, women will find it more difficult\nto describe key elements of their existence. Similarly, where the\nwords we have—like ‘foreplay’—systematically\ndistort women’s experiences, women will have a difficult time\naccurately conveying the realities of their lives. If one takes such\nproblems to go beyond selected particular terms, and to infect\nlanguage as a whole, it is natural to suppose that women are to a\nlarge degree silenced—unable to accurately articulate\nkey elements of their lives, and unable to communicate important\naspects of their thoughts. Spender and others also suggest that the\nmaleness of language constrains thought, imposing a male\nworldview on all of us, and making alternative visions of reality\nimpossible, or at least very difficult to articulate. These arguments\noften draw upon the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Sapir 1921; Whorf 1956). \nIt is generally formulated very vaguely, but seems to amount to roughly the hypothesis that “our\nworldview is determined by the structures of the particular language\nthat we happen to speak” (Cameron 1998b: 150). \nSome suggest that male power over language allows men to shape not\njust thought, but also reality. For example, Spender claims that men\n“created language, thought, and reality” (1985: 143). This\nis a very strong version of what Haslanger has called discursive\n constructivism.[3]\n She defines this view as follows: \nSomething is discursively constructed just in case it is the way it\nis, to some substantial extent, because of what is attributed (and/or\nself-attributed) to it. (Haslanger 1995: 99) \nFeminists like Spender and Catherine MacKinnon (1989) argue that male\npower over language has allowed them to create reality. This is partly\ndue to the fact that our categorizations of reality inevitably depend\non our social perspective: “there is no ungendered reality or\nungendered perspective” (MacKinnon 1989: 114). Haslanger (1995)\ndiscusses this argument in detail. \nIn general, the solution suggested is not to attempt to create a\nneutral language that can accurately capture reality in itself, a goal\nthey would take to be nonsense. Instead, we must aim to create a new\nreality more congenial to women. Some feminists have argued that the\nonly way to achieve this is for women to create their own language,\neither by redefining terms already in use, or by inventing a new\nlanguage, with new words and new rules. Only in this way, they\nsuggest, will women be able to break free from the constraints of male\nlanguage and male thought, to articulate a competing vision for the\nworld, and to work toward it (Daly and Caputi 1987; Elgin 1985;\nMacKinnon 1989; Penelope 1990; Spender 1985). Lynne Tirrell (1993)\noffers an especially sophisticated and complex discussion of this\nidea. \nThe claims discussed above concerning the maleness of\nEnglish, its causes, and its effects, are far from uncontentious.\nFirst, the extent of male bias in language is debatable. Although it\nis right that there is much to worry feminists about a wide variety of\nspecific terms and usages, it is far from clear that it is appropriate\nto claim that English is male-biased in some sweeping sense. It is\nalso unclear exactly what the claim being made is. If this claim is\ntaken to be that every term is male-biased, then it is highly implausible: it is very unlikely that there is a male bias present in\n‘piano’ or ‘isotope’. If the claim is simply\nthat there is much for feminists to object to, then it is almost\ncertainly right—but it is far from obvious that it is useful to\nfocus on such a general claim rather than on specific problems, their\ncomplexities and their possible solutions (Cameron 1998b). \nNext, the power that men have undeniably exercised in society (though, importantly, some groups of men have been vastly less powerful than others) by no\nmeans translates to a general power over language. Language is a\ndifficult thing to control, as those who have attempted to create\nlanguages have learned. The main power men have had has concerned\ndictionaries, usage guides, and laws. While these are enormously\nimportant in shaping reality, and in shaping our thoughts, it is quite\na leap to move from this power to the claim that men ‘created\nlanguage, thought, and reality’. \nThe claimed effects of the maleness of language are also problematic.\nWe have already seen problems for the idea that men control language.\nThe idea that men also control or create thought and reality faces\nfurther problems. The ability of feminists to successfully point out\nways in which elements of language have obscured women’s\nexperiences counts strongly against the claim that men control thought\n(Cameron 1998b); and, as Haslanger (1995) has argued in detail,\ndiscursive constructivism about reality is unsustainable. Nonetheless,\nit does seem right to notice that problems with specific terms can\nrender it more difficult for women to communicate about important\nelements of their lives, and probably also more difficult to reflect\nupon these elements (Hornsby 1995). These difficulties could perhaps\nbe described as partial silencing, partial constraint of thought, or\nhermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007), which we discuss more fully in\n2.4. \nIf the criticisms above are right, then women certainly do not need to\ncreate their own language. Many welcome this conclusion, worried that\na women’s language would doom women’s thoughts to\nmarginality and impede feminist progress. Moreover, the idea that\nwomen could craft a common language that allowed the articulation of\nall their experiences seems to ignore the fact that women differ\nenormously from one another (Crenshaw 1991; Lugones and Spelman 1983; Spelman 1988;\nsee the section on\n feminism and the diversity of women\n in the entry on\n feminist philosophy).\n If women cannot use the same language as men, why should we suppose\nthat women can successfully share a language? \nFeminists have also devoted attention to another aspect of\nlanguage—the use of metaphor (see the section Feminist Critiques\nand Conceptions of Objectivity in the entry on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science;\n and the entry on\n feminist approaches to the intersection of pragmatism and continental philosophy).\n In particular, feminists have discussed the use of gendered metaphors\nin philosophy and in\n science.[4]\n Emily Martin (1991 [1996]) offers particularly vivid examples in her\ndiscussion of the use of gendered metaphors in discussions of human\nreproduction. \nAt its extreme, the age-old relationship of the egg and the sperm\ntakes on a royal or religious patina. The egg coat, its protective\nbarrier, is sometimes called its ‘vestments’, a term\nusually reserved for sacred, religious dress. The egg is said to have\na ‘corona’, a crown, and to be accompanied by\n‘attendant cells’. It is holy, set apart and above, the\nqueen to the sperm’s king. The egg is also passive, which means\nit must depend on the sperm for rescue. Gerald Schatten and Helen\nSchatten liken the egg’s role to that of Sleeping Beauty:\n‘a dormant bride awaiting her mate’s magic kiss, which\ninstills the spirit that brings her to life’. Sperm, by\ncontrast, have a ‘mission’ which is to ‘move through\nthe female genital tract in quest of the ovum’. One popular\naccount has it that the sperm carry out a ‘perilous\njourney’ into the ‘warm darkness’, where some fall\naway ‘exhausted’. ‘Survivors’\n‘assault’ the egg, the successful candidates\n‘surrounding the prize’… (Martin 1996: 106) \nThe vision of reproduction suggested above is an inaccurate one. The\nsperm fails to behave in the single-minded manner suggested. Instead,\nthe  \nsideways motion of the sperm’s tail makes the head move sideways\nwith a force that is ten times stronger than its forward\nmovement…in fact, its strongest tendency, by tenfold, is to\nescape by attempting to pry itself off the egg. (Martin 1996: 108)\n \nNor is the egg passive: adhesive molecules on its surface play a\ncrucial role in overcoming the sperm’s tendency to pry itself\naway (Martin 1996: 108). Martin argues that scientists have been slow\nto discover these facts, partly due to the metaphors they employed;\nand that even as they have learned these facts they have been slow to\nupdate their metaphors. Gendered stereotypes, Martin suggests, can\nimpair our understanding of reproduction—by leading scientists\nto employ misleading metaphors that conceal the truth. The use of\ngendered stereotypes in scientific imagery can also help to perpetuate\ndamaging stereotypes, for example by reinforcing the tendency to see\nfemales as passive. Martin’s account has, however, been\nchallenged by Paul Gross (1998), who argues that scientists were not\nnearly so slow to these discoveries as Martin claimed. If Gross is\nright, then the problematic metaphors did not affect scientists’\nwork in the ways suggested by Martin (though they do seem to have\naffected popular writing on the subject.) \nGendered metaphors have been used at many levels of discussion,\nincluding the most general. An important topic of feminist concern has\nbeen the historical tendency to conceive of the scientific endeavour\nin gendered ways. A particularly clear example comes from Francis\nBacon, discussed by both Evelyn Fox Keller and Genevieve Lloyd: \nFor Bacon, the promise of science is expressed as ‘leading you\nto Nature with all her children to bind her to your service and make\nher your slave’. (Keller 1996: 36.) \nThe tendency to describe nature in feminine terms is a long-standing\nand widespread one, well-documented in Lloyd (1984). Lloyd links this\nto a tendency to describe reason and the mind as male, and to contrast\nthese with supposedly feminine emotions and bodies. She argues that\nthese metaphors play a powerful role in the history of philosophy,\nshaping and often distorting our views both of reason, mind, emotion,\nand body and of men and women. Other important discussions of gendered\nmetaphors in philosophy include Irigaray (1974 [1985a], 1977 [1985b]),\nLe Dœuff (1980 [1990]), and Nye (1990, 1992). \nIn the early days of feminist philosophy of language, much attention\nwas devoted to ways that philosophy of language was problematic from a\nfeminist point of view. One sort of criticism was that philosophy of\nlanguage, like English, displays a male bias. Another was simply that\nphilosophy of language is ill-equipped to further feminist aims. Those\nmaking these criticisms did not suggest that philosophy of language be\nabandoned, but rather that it should be reformed—purged of male\nbias and turned into a discipline that can help in the attainment of\nfeminist ends. \nWhat reasons were given for supposing that philosophy of language is\nill suited to achieving feminist ends? There were a variety of reasons\n(Hintikka and Hintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000; Nye 1996, 1998), but one\ncommon thread involves the idea that philosophy of language is\nexcessively individualistic. Criticism of individualism in philosophy\nis widespread in many areas of feminism. Exactly what\n‘individualism’ comes to varies depending upon the area of\nphilosophy under discussion, and depending also on the concerns of the\nparticular critic. (For more on what feminists mean by\n‘individualism’, see Antony 1995.) Because of this, we\nwill not attempt a general definition of ‘individualism’,\nas used by those raising these concerns. However, we will sketch what\nseems to be at issue in concerns over philosophy of language. Some\nclaim that philosophy of language focuses excessively on the states of\nmind of individual speakers—in particular on their intentions\n(Hornsby 2000). Jennifer Hornsby’s central example of this\ntendency is the work of H. P. Grice, which does indeed analyse speaker\nmeaning in terms of speaker intentions. (Although it is worth noting\nthat that Grice’s analysis of sentence meaning incorporates\nsocial elements, and that both speaker and audience are essential to\nhis notion of conversational implicature. For more on this, see Saul\n2002.) Others suggest that semantics assigns too important a role to\nthe notion of reference to discrete individuals (Hintikka and Hintikka\n1983). Their focus is on Alfred Tarski’s truth definitions\n(Tarski 1956; see also entry on\n Tarski’s truth definitions)\n and Richard Montague’s work (Thomason 1974). \nIndividualism of this sort is said to be problematic for several\nreasons. One common claim is that this sort of individualism is\ncharacteristic of male thinking. Men tend, according to this line of\nthought, to be interested in separate, discrete individuals; while\nwomen are interested in connections and relationships. Thus, it is\nsuggested, an individualistic philosophy of language is one that\nrepresents a male way of thinking about the world. For philosophy of\nlanguage to be true to the experiences and language use of both men\nand women, then, the individualistic philosophy of language which is\ncharacteristic of male thinking will need to be supplemented or\nreplaced by a version more suited to female thinking (Hintikka and\nHintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000). As Haslanger (2000a) and others have\nnoted, however, the claims regarding male and female thinking on which\nthis line of thought depends are not well supported. Moreover,\ndifferences among women give us reason to doubt the prospects for any\nsupportable generalizations about ‘women’s’ thinking\n(Ang 1995, Lorde 1983, Lugones and Spelman 1983; Moody-Adams 1991). \nOther objections to individualism do not depend upon contentious\npsychological claims about differences between women and men. Instead,\nthey suggest that the real problem with individualism is its failure\nto appreciate the importance of the social. The social world is,\nnaturally, an important area of concern when discussing politics and\npower relations. Understanding how people come to dominate one\nanother, and exactly how this domination functions, are important\nprojects for feminists. Language is an important part of the social\nworld, and understanding the roles that language plays in\ncommunicating, manipulating, and controlling (to cite just a few\nexamples) is surely vital to understanding the workings of power (see,\nfor example, MacKinnon’s views on speech in MacKinnon 1993). So,\nmany feminists suggest, a philosophy of language that is appropriate\nto understanding communicative interactions in the social world could\nbe a valuable tool for feminists. However, they insist that the\nindividualism of philosophy of language (as it is now) prevents it\nfrom serving this function (Hornsby 2000). \nThe general charge that philosophy of language pays little attention\nto the social world is not one that all feminists would agree with.\nIndeed, it is a difficult one to sustain in light of the prominence\nof—to give a few examples—Saul Kripke’s causal\ntheory of reference (1972; see also Section 2 of the entry on\n reference),\n Hilary Putnam’s arguments for a social element (the division of\nlinguistic labor) in the working of kind terms (1975; see also Section\n3 of the entry on\n reference),\n H.P. Grice’s theory of conversation (1975 [1989]), David\nLewis’s work on convention (1969), and J.L. Austin’s\nspeech act theory (1962 [1975]). Nonetheless, one might well suggest\nthat philosophers of language have generally attended only to aspects\nof the social world that are not of particular interest to feminists.\nWhile causal theories of reference undeniably involve social elements,\nthese social elements don’t seem to be of the sort that concern\nfeminists; while Putnam’s division of linguistic labour arguably\ninvolves some power relations (experts have a special sort of\nlinguistic power that non-experts lack), the political aspects of\nthese power relations—if any—have been ignored. Andrea Nye\ncriticizes mainstream philosophy of language on roughly these grounds,\narguing that work on radical translation has not been sufficiently\nsensitive to political concerns (for the notion of radical\ntranslation, see the section on Meaning and Truth in the entry on\n Donald Davidson). \n…a highly technical and professionalized English-speaking\nphilosophy of language was addressing problems of the possibility of\n‘radical’ translation from one language community to\nanother, of alternate and incommensurable conceptual schemes, of the\ndifficulty of establishing singular reference across ‘different\nworlds’, but with virtually no reference to actual failures of\ncommunication or problems of gender. (Nye 1998: 266) \nMore recently, Louise Antony has argued that it is a mistake to\nsuppose that there is any particular approach to philosophy of\nlanguage that is distinctly feminist or anti-feminist, taking as her\nparticular target Hornsby’s work—but her arguments apply\nmore broadly. She argues that such strategies are “disrespectful\nto and exclusionary of feminists who support alternative views”\n(2012: 277). \nThings have changed a great deal in recent years, and it is now widely\naccepted that philosophy of language has something to offer feminists,\nand even (though less widely) that feminists have something to offer\nphilosophy of language. Feminist philosophy of language is now\nbecoming a well-established area of the larger field, with several\nsubstantial positive research programmes. \nThe first substantial analytic research programme in feminist\nphilosophy of language began with Rae Langton’s and\nHornsby’s use of speech act theory to make sense of Catharine\nMacKinnon’s suggestion that pornography silences and\nsubordinates women. It has now, however, evolved well beyond those\nbeginnings. To give some flavour of this initial work, we\nbriefly summarise Langton’s discussion of silencing. \nAccording to Langton (1993), pornography helps to bring about rape by\nperlocutionarily and illocutionarily silencing women. Following\nAustin, Langton distinguishes between locutionary, illocutionary, and\nperlocutionary acts. A locutionary act is, roughly, the act of\nuttering words that have particular meanings; a perlocutionary act is,\nroughly, the act of uttering words that have a particular effect; and\nan illocutionary act is the act done in uttering the words. Consider,\nfor example, Jennifer Saul’s utterance one day of the sentence\n‘I pledge my allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen and all her\nheirs’. The locutionary act she performed was simply the\nutterance of a sentence with a particular meaning. This act had many\nperlocutionary effects: it made it possible for her to get a British\npassport, it made her feel slightly disturbed at having expressed such\nmonarchist sentiments, and it made her wonder whether a republic,\nshould it succeed the Queen, would count as an heir. The illocutionary\nact she performed was that of becoming a British citizen. \nLangton proposes that there are forms of silencing corresponding to\neach of these sorts of speech act. A person is locutionarily silenced\nif she is prevented from speaking, or intimidated into not speaking. A\nperson is illocutionarily silenced if she is unable to carry out the\nacts that she intends to carry out in speaking. A person is\nperlocutionarily silenced when her speech cannot have its intended\neffects. Langton is particularly concerned with the role that\nperlocutionary and illocutionary silencing may play in rape. A\nwoman’s refusal to have sex is perlocutionarily silenced\nif—even though she is recognized as refusing—she is forced\nto have sex. Her (attempted) refusal to have sex is illocutionarily\nsilenced if it is not even recognized as a refusal. (For an\nexploration of the role of conventions in this illocutionary\nsilencing, see Wyatt 2009.) In such a case, according to Langton, it\nisn’t a refusal. She suggests that pornography plays a\nkey role in making men less able to recognise women’s refusals\nas refusals and more willing to rape women even when they recognise\nwomen’s refusals. This means, she argues, that pornography\nillocutionarily and perlocutionarily silences women. And this\nsilencing is an important one, as it results in rape. \nThis example can also help us to see that some elements of\nindividualism may be indispensable to feminism (for more arguments to\nthis effect, see Antony 1995). Assuming that Langton’s arguments\nare sound, we can see an important role for individualistic philosophy\nof language in feminism. Although it is right that focusing\nexclusively on individual speakers’ intentions would prevent us\nfrom seeing some important facts (as Hornsby 2000 argues), it also\nvital to recognise the importance of paying some attention to an\nindividual speaker’s intentions. In order to understand what has\ngone wrong in the illocutionary silencing described above, one needs\nto understand that the woman intended to be refusing sex. In\norder to understand what has gone wrong in the perlocutionary\nsilencing example, one needs to understand that the woman\nintended her refusal to bring it about that she did not have\nsex. More generally, not being understood properly is an important\nelement of life in a subordinate position, as many feminists have\nnoted. In order to make sense of not being understood properly, one\nneeds to attend to what the speaker intended and how the\naudience understood the speaker, and how these things differ. To\ndo this, one needs to look at individual states of mind. \nThese discussions have inspired a now substantial literature. Below, we\ngive some very non-comprehensive pointers to this literature. \nThis use of speech act theory was one of the first developments of\nfeminist philosophy of language to gain mainstream currency, and it\nhas become widely taught and studied. Recently, however, sharply\ncritical feminist voices have started to emerge. Separately, and for\ndifferent reasons, Nancy Bauer (2015) and Lorna Finlayson (2014), have\nboth argued that the feminist literature on speech acts and\npornography is deeply misguided. Bauer objects on several grounds. She\nthinks it is misguided to treat pornography as speech, and she (like\nother critics noted above) argues that pornography should not be seen\nas authoritative. Her more fundamental critique, though, is that this\nliterature fails to take seriously the realities of both pornography\nand women’s subordination—by not engaging sufficiently\nwith the phenomenology of pornography use; by not attending to all the\nways that the broader culture is involved in subordinating women; and\nby focusing on just women’s verbal acts of refusal, thereby\nfailing to appreciate the fuller dehumanization involved in sexual\nassault. This is part of a broader critique, for Bauer, of both\nanalytic philosophy in general, and widespread understandings of\nAustin. Finlayson goes even further, arguing not that Austin’s\nwork was misused by feminists but that it never should have been used\nat all. She suggests that the feminist foray into speech act theory\nwas entirely unnecessary, and also that the focus on pornography was\nmisguided. \nBut there have also been very substantial developments broadening and\nbuilding upon the feminist use of speech theory—extending it to\nissues like racist speech, and hate speech more generally. McGowan\n(2009a) argues for the existence of a different sort of silencing due\nto pornography; and in her 2009b she argues that speech may be counted\nnot just as silencing or subordinating, but also as oppressing.\nMoreover, she suggests that oppressive speech is likely to be a very\nwidespread phenomenon. These ideas are developed further in McGowan\n(2012), which takes as its focus racist speech, and in Simpson (2013).\nMaitra (2012) also applies ideas from feminist work on subordinating\nspeech to racist speech. Langton also turns her attention to hate\nspeech more broadly, including in her 2012. This paper is also notable\nfor its focus on the role of pragmatics in shaping attitudes other\nthan belief. Rachel McKinney (2016), “Extracted Speech”,\nbuilds on this literature by exploring the ways that speech may be\nunjustly extracted rather than silenced (as in, for example, the\nparadigm case of the Central Park Five’s false confessions).\nRebecca Kukla introduces the notion of discursive injustice, in order\nto discuss a broader range of ways that “members of a\ndisadvantaged group face a systematic inability to produce a specific\nkind of speech act they are entitled to perform” (2014: 440),\nwhich often takes the form of performing a different speech act from\nthe one that they intend. Although she draws on Langton and Hornsby,\nshe abandons their focus on illocution and perlocution, focussing\ninstead simply on performative force. Also considering the role of\npragmatics in politics (though developed independently from Langton\nand Hornsby), Marina Sbisà (1999) explores the role of\npresuppositions in political persuasion. Finally, Jason Stanley (2015)\ndraws heavily on Langton and Hornsby’s work in developing his\naccount of propaganda (focused, but not exclusively, on racist\npropaganda). \nIn her ground-breaking paper “Gender and Race: (What) Are They?\n(What) Do We Want Them To Be?” (2000b), Haslanger aims to\nprovide an account of the nature of gender, as well as an account of\nthe meaning of ‘woman’. She assumes the classical\ndistinction between sex and gender, where sex is supposed to\nrefer to biological or anatomical properties distinguishing males from\nfemales (although as she argues, this distinction is flexible and\npermeated by social and political factors too), and gender is\nsupposed to refer to social or cultural factors distinguishing men\nfrom women (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender).\n One of the main virtues of Haslanger’s article is that she\nmakes explicit the methodological approach that she endorses, to wit:\nshe famously distinguishes between a descriptive project,\nwhich aims to reveal the concept that we actually use or the property\nthat we actually track with our usage of the term, and an\nanalytical project (or an ameliorative project, as\nshe calls it in Haslanger 2006), which aims to reveal the concept that\nwe should use or the meaning that we should associate to the\ncorresponding term, given our purposes and aims in that inquiry. As\nshe makes clear, she is following the analytical or ameliorative\napproach, with the explicit aim of providing an account of the meaning\nof ‘gender’ and ‘woman’ that could be a useful\ntool in order to fight sexism and help to achieve social justice. With\nthis purpose in mind, she comes up with the following definition of\nthe term ‘woman’, as one particular type of gender: \nS is a woman iffdefS is\nsystematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political,\nlegal, social, etc.) and S is “marked” as a target\nfor this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to\nbe evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.\n(2000b: 39) \nAs we can see, the main idea of Haslanger’s account is that\ngender is a hierarchical social structure, where some members are\nsituated in a position of privilege and some other members are\nsituated in a position of subordination along social, economic,\npolitical, legal, or cultural dimensions, in virtue of their real or\nimagined biological role in reproduction. And more particularly, being\na woman corresponds to occupying a specific position of subordination\nwith respect to this social structure, due to one’s perceived or\nimagined biologically female bodily features.  \nHaslanger’s proposal gave rise to a rich debate about the\nvirtues of an ameliorative approach, and the advantages and problems\nof this particular account. For instance, Saul (2006b) argued that\nthis proposed usage of the term ‘woman’ could have some\nproblematic consequences, such as feminists having to advocate for the\neradication of women, since feminists advocate for the eradication of\nthe subordination of people in terms of their biological role in\nreproduction. For this reason, Saul argued, this might not be the most\nadvantageous way of using the term ‘woman’. In addition,\nSaul argued that the folk or ordinary concept of ‘woman’\ndoes not really distinguish between sex as a biological feature and\ngender as a social or cultural feature. Following up on this, Mikkola\n(2011b) argued that it might be very costly to revise the ordinary\nmeaning of ‘woman’ in considerable ways as Haslanger\nsuggests, since this might jeopardize communication, in addition to\nthe fact that gender identity and the label ‘woman’ might\nbe a source of identity and pride for many women. Therefore, to\ncharacterize being a woman in terms of being subordinated, as\nHaslanger does, might not be politically useful for the aims of\nfeminism. Mikkola (2011b) put forward an alternative account of\n‘woman’ that does not endorse the sex/gender distinction:\nrather, she proposed a trait/norm covariance model, according\nto which there are different traits that are assigned to men or women\n(or males or females) at a certain context, and that are expected to\nbe followed and instantiated. However, the different traits that are\nassigned to men or to women are heavily context-dependent and\nflexible, and it is possible to revise both the assignment of traits\nand the norms and expectations involving them, in virtue of many kinds\nof factors, including moral and political considerations. \nMore recently, several feminists have argued that an account of\n‘woman’ along the lines of Haslanger’s proposal\nmight fail to do justice to the aims of trans women, which should be\ncentral for the purposes of feminism. For example, Saul (2012) argues\nthat neither standard sex-based accounts nor standard gender-based\naccounts are automatically going to be inclusive of trans women, since\n(at least some) trans women could arguably turn out to be excluded\nfrom the extension of the term ‘woman’ when defined in\nterms of biological features, or in terms of certain social and\ncultural factors that are usually attributed to biologically female\nindividuals. Saul put forward a possible alternative view, namely, a\ncontextualist view of the meaning of ‘woman’, as\nfollows: \nX is a woman is true in a context C iff\nX is human and relevantly similar (according to the standards\nat work in C) to most of those possessing all of the biological\nmarkers of female sex. (2012: 201) \nAccording to this account, an individual will fall under the extension\nof ‘woman’ in a certain context when she is sufficiently\nsimilar to those who are biologically female, given the standards of\nsimilarity that are relevant in such context, where these standards\ncan vary from context to context. Saul argues that at first sight,\nthis view seems to give the right results, since it would classify\ntrans women as women in most contexts where, say, self-identifying as\na woman is what is deemed relevant, but on further reflection, she\nargues, the view can give unwanted results. For example, in a\nconservative community where most speakers take for granted that trans\nwomen should not be allowed to use women’s toilets, their usage\nof ‘woman’ would be such that trans women would not fall\nunder the term, since the relevant criterion of similarity in that\ncontext that those conservative speakers have in mind seems to be\nsomething like having certain chromosomes or certain anatomical\nfeatures, which some trans women lack. In response to this worry, E.\nDiaz-Leon (2016) has argued that we can understand the contextualist\nview in a way that avoids this objection. In particular, she argues,\nwe can understand the relevant standards of similarity at work in each\ncontext as those criteria that are the most politically useful, given\nthe aims and purposes that are morally salient in that context. For\nexample, in the context of a conservative community where trans women\nare not allowed to use women’s toilets, there are moral reasons\nfor focusing on criteria such as self-identifying as a woman, rather\nthan having certain biological features, and this is what makes this\ncriterion the relevant one in that context, and hence what fixes the\nextension of ‘woman’ in that context, as required. \nTalia Bettcher (2013) has also argued that ameliorative accounts of\nthe meaning of ‘woman’ should take into account the aims\nof trans women. She argues that “single-meaning” views, according to which ‘woman’ has a unique meaning that is shared by all speakers, cannot do justice to those aims. Instead, she puts forward a “multiple-meaning” account, according to which there are several co-existing meanings of the term ‘woman’ in our society, but where some of those meanings embed world-views that are not only morally and politically problematic, but also factually misguided, such as using ‘woman’ in a trans-exclusionary way. Because of this, we have good reasons for using the term ‘woman’ in our speech with the trans-inclusive meaning that trans-friendly communities already associate with the term. She also argues that although it is methodologically useful to rely on intuitions, “it is inappropriate to dismiss alternative ways in which those terms are actually used in trans subcultures; such usage needs to be taken into consideration as part of the analysis” (2013: 235). \nMore recently, Katharine\nJenkins (2016) has argued that Haslanger’s original proposal\nexcluded trans women from the extension of the term\n‘woman’, which is morally and politically problematic. As\nJenkins argues, trans women who do not pass as cis women\n(that is, those women who were assigned female at birth) do not occupy\na position of subordination in virtue of their perceived or\nimagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female\nbiological role in reproduction, since they are not presumed to have a\nfemale biological role in reproduction (given that they do not pass as\ncis women). For this reason, Haslanger’s account cannot capture\nthe self-identity of those trans women as women, and the ways in which\nthey are subordinated in virtue of their gender identity. In order to\nsolve this problem, Jenkins proposes an ingenious account of gender in\nterms of two elements, namely, gender as a social class, and gender as\nsocial identity, where the former is similar to Haslanger’s\nnotion of gender as social structures, and the latter has to do with\nour own perceptions of our own positioning within those social\nstructures. Following Haslanger’s (2005) account of racial\nidentity, Jenkins suggests an account of gender identity in terms of\nmental maps that serve to guide our own behavior, norms and\nexpectations within the social niches that we live in. (For criticism of Jenkins’ account as insufficiently inclusive of trans women, see Andler 2017.) \nIn this section we have focused on semantic accounts of the\nmeaning of ‘woman’, although recently there has also been\nan explosion of work about the related questions of the\nmetaphysics of gender as a social class, and biological sex\nas a contested category. Some of these discussions have implications\nfor the meanings of the corresponding terms of ‘woman’ and\n‘female’. For example, Saray Ayala and Nadya Vasilyeva\n(2015) provide an account of biological sex in terms of extended,\nflexible biological features, where which features count for being\nmale or female can change from context to context, depending on our\naims and purposes, and where those extended biological features can be\ntaken to incorporate features of the environment, artificial bodily\nfeatures, and so on. On the other hand, Helen Daly (2015) has argued\nthat we should favour accounts of ‘female’ and\n‘woman’ that do not assume a sharp cut-off point between\nthose who fall under the term and those who do not, since this is\nmorally and politically problematic. In addition, Jennifer McKitrick\n(2015) has argued that an account of gender in terms of dispositions\nto behave in certain ways can be politically useful, and can capture\nthe aims of trans women. Finally, Haslanger (2016) has defended a\ncontext-sensitive account of ‘sex’, where the term can\nhave different meanings, depending on the aims and purposes of the\ninquiry in that context. \nAs we saw in the previous section, Haslanger (2000b) brought attention\nto the need for revisionary or ameliorative approaches in feminist\nphilosophy, as opposed to purely conceptual or descriptive approaches,\nwhich focus on the concept we have or the objective type that we\nactually track. The idea of a revisionary or ameliorative approach to\nthe analysis of our concepts has been a very influential one in\nphilosophy, but Haslanger’s work has served as a kind of\nreminder of the significance of aiming for the concepts that would\nbest serve our purposes and aims, rather than merely revealing the\nordinary concepts that we happen to have, which is the task that many\nprojects in recent mainstream analytic philosophy seem to have paid\nattention to. Haslanger’s work has inspired a lot of interesting\nameliorative projects in philosophy of gender and race and social\nphilosophy more in general (see for instance Glasgow 2006, 2009 and\nMallon 2006 on ‘race’, Barnes 2016 on\n‘disability’, Dembroff 2016 on ‘sexual\norientation’, as well as many of the papers on\n‘woman’, ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ cited\nin the previous section). As suggested above, the notion of an\nameliorative project in philosophy is not new, but in our view the\nimpetus that this methodological approach in philosophy has\nexperienced recently owes much to the centrality that this notion has\nplayed in recent developments in philosophy of gender and race over\nthe last two decades. \nAs ameliorative projects are becoming more common in mainstream\nanalytic philosophy, they have given rise to a careful examination of\nthe methodological foundations and the metaphysical, semantic and\nepistemic aspects of the ameliorative approach, as well as its moral\nand political implications. Alexis Burgess and David Plunkett\n(2013a,b) have usefully surveyed these and related issues pertaining\nto ameliorative projects in philosophy, and have coined a new label:\nconceptual ethics. They intend this new term to refer to the\nphilosophical reflection about the terms and concepts that we ought to\nuse in different areas, given our best normative reasoning, as well as\nthe methodological and philosophical issues to which these projects\ngive rise. Examples include the nature of the values and normative\nconsiderations that should guide our choice of terms and concepts, as\nwell as semantic questions about the nature and possibility of\nconceptual change and conceptual revision, among many others. One of\nthe advantages of having this new label is that discussions on these\nnormative issues about our talk and thought that were formerly\nscattered can now be more unified and more systematic. \nAnother term that is becoming prominent in this area is that of\nconceptual engineering, which is supposed to refer to\nameliorative projects that aim to revise our current concepts and\nengineer new concepts that can better serve our main purposes. This\nterm originates from discussions about Carnap’s methodological\ninsights (see for instance French 2015 for a useful overview), but is\nnow being used in a more general, encompassing sense. Several\nphilosophers have recently argued that we could understand many\ntraditional debates in philosophy as debates in conceptual ethics or\nconceptual engineering (see for instance Floridi 2011 and Plunkett\n2015). \nAs we saw above, Fricker (2007) argues that there is a distinctive\nkind of injustice that has to do with the inability to properly\nunderstand and communicate important aspects of one’s social\nexperience: she calls this hermeneutical injustice. According\nto Fricker, people in a position of marginalization are prevented from\ncreating concepts, terms and other representational resources that\ncould be used in order to conceptualize and understand their own\nexperiences, especially those having to do with being in that position\nof marginalization. People in a position of power will tend to create\nconcepts and linguistic representations that help to conceptualize the\nexperiences and phenomena that matter to them, rather than\nthe experiences and phenomena that matter the most to people in a\nposition of marginalization. Because of this, members of marginalized\ngroups might suffer from a lacuna in the representational resources\nthat are available to them, and in particular might lack the concepts\nand terms that would allow them to understand and communicate their\nexperiences. In order to illustrate this phenomenon, Fricker (2007)\nfocuses on several examples, such as the articulation of the term\n‘sexual harassment’: before the term was coined, victims\nof sexual harassment lacked the language to explain their experiences\nof receiving unwanted sexual advances at work in a way that would make\nclear why those interactions wronged them. \nIn the growing literature on hermeneutical injustice, philosophers\nhave mainly focused on the following two central questions: first, how\nto properly understand the phenomenon of hermeneutical injustice\n(namely, what is distinctively epistemic about it, and what\nmakes it unjust); and secondly, how to resist this kind of\ninjustice and how to fill in the corresponding conceptual and\nlinguistic gaps in our collective understanding of situations of\nmarginalization. \nRegarding the first question, Laura Beeby (2011) has argued that the\nrelevant notion of hermeneutical injustice is one that focuses on the\nepistemic situation of lacking the relevant concepts and terms, rather\nthan on one’s position within the background social conditions\nthat give rise to it. She argues that, for example, in the case of\nsexual harassment both the victim and the harasser suffer from\nhermeneutical injustice since they both have similar epistemic\nsituations, that is, they both have similar gaps in their collective\nunderstanding of what is going on. As Beeby argues, if we offer a\ncharacterization of hermeneutical injustice in terms of the\nepistemic situation of the subject, and in particular in\nterms of their conceptual gaps, then both the harasser and that\nharassee will be in a situation of hermeneutical injustice, but this\nseems to be in tension with Fricker’s claim that only the victim\nsuffers from hermeneutical injustice. However, as Beeby also\nemphasizes, one could respond, following Fricker, that people in a\nposition of power are epistemically advantaged in another sense,\nnamely, they do have the ability to create concepts and terms that are\nuseful in order to understand and communicate their own experiences\nand the social interactions that matter the most to them. This\ncontrasts with the situation of the marginalized, who lack this\nability. \nHowever, the idea that the marginalized lack the ability to\nconceptualize and communicate their own experiences has also been\ncontested by philosophers such as Rebecca Mason (2011), Kristie Dotson\n(2012), Gaile Pohlhaus (2012) and José Medina (2013). For\nexample, Mason (2011) and Medina (2013) have both argued that although\nFricker is right that people in a situation of marginalization might\nnot have access to publicly shared terms in order to communicate their\nexperiences to those in a position of power, they might nonetheless be\nable to make sense of their own experiences in a useful way, even\nbefore those public concepts are introduced in the dominant language.\nFor example, in the case of sexual harassment, some victims of sexual\nharassment were able to attend women’s consciousness-raising\nmeetings and talk to each other about their similar experiences, that\nis to say, they were able to understand their experiences and\ncommunicate them to people in the same predicament, even before they\nhad a term like ‘sexual harassment’. Therefore, Mason\n(2011) argues, it seems plausible to say that members of marginalized\ngroups already have some conceptual resources that enable them to\nunderstand their own social experiences, and what they actually lack\nis the power to introduce these meanings into the collective\nunderstanding, which is unjust, and which results in the fact that\ndominant groups have a distorted understanding of the social\nexperiences of non-dominant groups. Relatedly, Pohlhaus (2012) has\nargued that marginalized subjects are in a better position to notice\ngaps in our collective epistemic resources in order to properly\ndescribe and conceptualize the experiences of those who are socially\noppressed. Moreover, these subjects could work cooperatively with\nother subjects in the same predicament so as to develop new epistemic\nresources that can deal with those spheres of the social world that\npeople in a position of domination do not usually pay attention to.\nHowever, as Pohlhaus argues, it will be difficult to convince the\nprivileged to employ those new epistemic resources developed by the\nmarginalized. She calls this phenomenon of dismissive ignorance\nwillful hermeneutical ignorance. \nFurthermore, Dotson (2012)\nhas introduced a new kind of epistemic injustice, in addition to\ntestimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice, namely, what she\ncalls contributory injustice. This kind of epistemic\ninjustice has to do not only with the phenomenon of willfully ignoring\nthe epistemic resources developed by the marginalized, but also with\nthe continuous use of distorted epistemic resources developed by those\nin a position of power, without paying attention to the experiences of\nthe marginalized. This use of faulty conceptual resources acts to\nblock the uptake of the new conceptual resources developed by the\nmarginalized, which leads to further misunderstandings. In addition,\nMedina (2013) has argued that the fact that members of non-dominant\ngroups have the ability to understand their own experiences and\ncommunicate them to each other is a prior and necessary step in order\nto bring new, more sophisticated concepts and terms into our shared\nlanguage. According to Medina, this can also help with our second\nquestion above, namely, how to resist hermeneutical injustice: he\nsuggests that members of dominant groups should be more sensitive to\ninchoate attempts at communication by people in a position of\nsubordination, even before they have access to shared concepts to\nproperly conceptualize those aspects of our social interactions. Finally, Derek E. Anderson (2017) distinguishes a new kind of epistemic injustice, namely, conceptual competence injustice, which occurs when a marginalized subject is not considered to be a competent user of a concept, because of a lack of linguistic or conceptual credibility, when in fact they are perfectly competent. This is different from hermeneutical injustice, Anderson argues, since in cases of hermeneutical injustice marginalized subjects lack access to some important concepts due to structural reasons, whereas in cases of conceptual competence injustice they fully possess the concepts but are regarded as incompetent speakers. However, this kind of injustice is closely related to Dotson’s notion of contributory injustice, since in cases where privileged subjects use distorted or biased hermeneutical resources, they will be more likely to doubt the conceptual competence of marginalized subjects (even if these are in fact more fully competent), which amounts to conceptual competence injustice, and hence the conceptual resources of the marginalized will in turn be less likely to get uptake, which amounts to contributory injustice. \nFinally, regarding the question of what kinds of conceptual resources might be\nneeded in order to fill in the hermeneutical gaps in our collective\nunderstandings, Komarine Romdenh-Romluc (2016) argues that what is\nneeded are new terms and concepts that have the correct\nevaluative component, in addition to the right descriptive\ncomponent. For instance, introducing the term ‘sexual\nharassment’ was very useful because the new term somehow implies\nthat sexual harassment is wrong, whereas previous terms such as\n‘harmless flirting’ did not connote the appropriate\nnegative evaluative component. Likewise, as Medina (2013) argues, the\nappropriation of terms such as ‘gay’ and\n‘queer’ by the LGBT community can be seen as a strategy\nfor overcoming a situation of hermeneutical injustice, since these\nterms came to express new, positive conceptions of same-sex desire, in\ncontrast to old conceptions of it as something pathological or\nperverse. In addition, George Hull (forthcoming) argues that\nconsciousness-raising is very important, not only as a means to\novercoming hermeneutical injustice, but it “can itself\nconstitute the overcoming of hermeneutical injustice” (2016:\n13). He focuses on the case of black South Africans during apartheid,\nand he argues, drawing on the work of Black Consciousness theorists\nsuch as B.S. Biko and N.B. Pityana, that they were liable to\nexperience a mismatch between their experiences of racism and\noppression, and the collective hermeneutical resources available to\nthem. Because of this, consciousness-raising can help to correct false\nor distorted conceptions and images of themselves, and to develop new\nconceptual tools in order to make sense of those aspects of their\nlives. Furthermore, Charlie Crerar (2016) has argued that the\ninjustice associated with lack of hermeneutical resources does not\noccur only in cases of conceptual absence (i.e. conceptual lacunas) or\nconceptual inadequacy (i.e. lack of concepts with the appropriate\nconnotations), but also in cases where there is a rich conceptual\nrepertoire but taboos or other social practices prevent marginalized\nsubjects from discussing some matters of interest to them. Therefore,\nhe argues, “we require access to an expressively free\nenvironment in which to put these concepts to work: an open and\nreceptive social context in which a particular experience that\nindividuals or groups have a significant interest in coming to\nunderstand can be discussed in hermeneutically conducive ways”\n(2016: 205). \nGeneric statements are ones such as “cats are furry”, or\n“a cat has fur”, which are neither universal\ngeneralizations (there are furless cats) nor existential\ngeneralization (the claim being made is clearly stronger). They give\nrise to many puzzles, which have for some time interested both\nlinguists and philosophers. For a fuller discussion of generics, see\n the entry on generics.\n Our focus here is the social and political import that has recently\nbeen suggested for generic statements about social groups, on which\nthere is a growing literature. This literature takes as its starting\npoint Sarah-Jane Leslie’s work (Leslie 2015; Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes 2015). Of key interest here are examples such as “boys\ndon’t cry” or “women place their families before\ntheir careers”. These sentences can be used to express merely\ndescriptive claims—describing, for example, crying as something\nnot that many boys do. But they can also be used to make normative\nclaims about what boys or women should do. Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes (2015) suggest that “we can understand the difference\nbetween normative and descriptive generics in terms of the different\nconcepts picked out by the noun phrase in the generics\nthemselves” (Wodak et. al. 2015: 629). ‘Woman’ may\npick out a normative concept—an ideal, which might include such\nthings as a focus on family over career; or, alternatively, it may\npick out a descriptive concept, and refer to women regardless of\nwhether they focus on family over career. Leslie uses this as a\nfoundation for explaining utterances like “Hillary Clinton is\nthe only man in the Obama White House”, suggesting that\n‘man’ here refers to the ideal of manliness. It is also a\npart of a more general project of arguing that generic utterances have\nharmful effects on social cognition. Leslie (forthcoming) also\ndiscusses what she calls “striking property generics”,\nstatements that attribute dangerous properties to groups generically\nspecified—like “black people are dangerous” or\n“Muslims are terrorists”. She argues that striking\nproperty generic claims may not require many instances to be accepted\nas true (assuming some other conditions are also met) allowing them to\nserve as a key mechanism in perpetuating and exacerbating prejudice.\n(For some criticisms of Leslie on striking property generics, see Saul\nforthcoming and Sterken 2015a,b.) \nHaslanger (2011) has built on Leslie’s work, arguing that\ngeneric claims often carry conversational implicatures about natures,\nand that these help them to serve as a key mechanism for perpetuating\nthe ideologies that hold unjust social structures in place. She\nsuggests that—whatever their truth conditions (one understanding\nof Leslie’s view would make striking property generic claims\nvery easily true)—one should deny them via the mechanism of\nmeta-linguistic negation (Horn 1985) which allows the denial of a\nclaim because it carries a false implicature. By this method, we can\nstart to disrupt the ideologies that have us in their grip. (For\ncriticism of this, see Saul forthcoming).","contact.mail":"j.saul@shef.ac.uk","contact.domain":"shef.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2004-09-03","date.changed":"2017-08-21","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/","author1":"Jennifer Saul","author1.info":"http://www.shef.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/profiles/saul.html","author2.info":"https://sites.google.com/site/esadiazleon/home","entry":"feminism-language","body.text":"\n\n\nFeminist philosophy of language has come a long way in a very short\ntime period. Initially, most work in the area was critical, calling\nfor changes either to language itself or to philosophy of language.\nMore recently, however, the dynamic has changed, with the advent of\nseveral major positive research programmes within philosophy of\nlanguage. In this entry, we first discuss the critiques that\nconstitute the first phase of feminist work in this area, before\nmoving onto the positive research programmes that have recently come\nto the fore. Our focus in this entry will generally be on the analytic\ntradition. For continental approaches, see the entries on\n feminist approaches to the intersection of analytic and continental philosophy,\n feminist approaches to the intersection of pragmatism and continental philosophy.\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a great deal of feminist concern over the supposedly\ngender-neutral use of terms like ‘he’ and\n‘man’. It is commonly said that these terms have both\ngender-specific meanings, as in sentences (1) and (2), and\ngender-neutral ones, as in sentences (3) and (4). \nFeminists, however, have pointed out that even the supposed\ngender-neutral meanings of these terms are not really gender-neutral.\nJanice Moulton (1981a) and Adele Mercier (1995) provide examples in\nwhich there is no doubt that a gender-neutral meaning is intended, but\nthis meaning seems unavailable. As a result, the sentences seem\nill-formed: \nWe are, then, making a classificatory error if we claim that\n‘man’ and ‘he’ are gender-neutral terms. In\norder to avoid such a classificatory error, we need to do more careful\nwork on what the meanings of these terms actually are. Perhaps the\nmeaning of ‘he’ that has been called\n‘gender-neutral’ is not really gender-neutral, but\nsomething much more complex. Mercier suggests, for example, that we\nshould understand the ‘gender-neutral’ use of\n‘man’ as referring to either (a) a person or persons of\nunknown sex; or (b) males or a combination of males and females. This\nexplains why ‘men’ in (5) and ‘man’ in (6) are\nanomalous: these terms are being used to refer exclusively to persons\nknown to be female. \nThe supposed ‘gender-neutral’ meaning of these terms,\nthen, is not truly gender neutral. But, on its own, this does not show\nthat there is a problem with those uses that have traditionally been\nclassified as gender-neutral, as in sentences (3) and (4).\n(Discovering that we have misclassified an adjective as an adverb\nwould not show anything wrong with actual uses of the term in\nquestion.) Further reasons are needed in order to object to the use\nthat is made of these terms. \nFeminist concerns, however, go beyond mere classificatory ones.\nFeminists have also argued that terms like ‘he’ and\n‘man’ contribute to making women invisible—that is,\nto obscuring women’s importance, and distracting attention from\ntheir existence. Fighting the invisibility of women is an important\nfeminist project in many\n areas,[1]\n and language that makes one less likely to think of women clearly\ncontributes to this invisibility. There is good psycholinguistic\nevidence that those who encounter sentences (like\n (3)\n and\n (4))\n using the terms ‘he’ and ‘man’ think more\nreadily of males than of\n females.[2]\n If this is right, then the use of these words can be seen as\ncontributing to the invisibility of women. This gives feminists a good\nreason to object to the ‘gender-neutral’ use of these\nterms. \nIf one’s only worry concerned the obscuring of women’s\npresence, however, it would be difficult to object to certain other\nterms to which feminists do commonly object: gender-specific\noccupational terms like ‘manageress’ (still common in the\nUK, though not in the US) or ‘lady doctor’. These terms\ncertainly do not contribute to the invisibility of women. Instead,\nthey call attention to the presence of women. Moreover, they call\nattention to women’s presence in positions of\nauthority—doctor and manager. Nonetheless, most feminists who\nthink about language find these terms objectionable. \nThe clearest reason for objecting to ‘manageress’ and\n‘lady doctor’ is that the use of these terms seems\npremised on the idea that maleness is the norm, and that women filling\nthese jobs are somehow deviant versions of doctors and managers. This\nis also a key objection to the use of ‘he’ and\n‘man’. Moulton (1981a) understands these terms on the\nmodel of brand names, like ‘Hoover’ or ‘Scotch\ntape’ that become generic terms for a product type. The message\nof such terms, she suggests, is that the brand in question is the\nbest, or at least the norm. According to Moulton, terms like\n‘he’ and ‘man’ work in the same manner: they\nare gender-specific terms for men whose use has been extended to cover\nboth men and women. This, Moulton argues, carries the message that\nmaleness is the norm. As a result, the use of these terms as if they\nwere gender neutral constitutes a sort of symbolic insult to women.\nLaurence Horn and Steven R. Kleinedler (2000) have disputed the\ndetails of this, noting that ‘man’ did not begin its life\nas gender-specific and then get extended to cover both women and men.\nRather, ‘man’ actually began its life as\n‘mann’, a gender-neutral term, which only later acquired a\ngender-specific meaning. The temporal sequence, then, cannot support\nthe claim that a gender-specific term has been extended to cover both\ngenders. Nonetheless, Horn and Kleinedler agree that the use of terms\nlike ‘he’ and ‘man’ as if they were\ngender-neutral perpetuates the objectionable idea that men are the\nnorm for humanity. \nEnglish, like most—but not all—languages, requires a great\ndeal of what Marilyn Frye calls ‘sex marking’ (Frye 1983).  For example, one cannot use pronouns to refer to a particular\nindividual without knowing their sex. (Frye, in common with most feminists of the early 1980s, does not consider trans issues.  She also does not consider the possibility that pronouns like ‘he’ and ‘she’ might be a matter of gender, not sex.) Frye notes the absurdity of this. \nIf I am writing a book review, the use of personal pronouns to refer\nto the author creates the need to know whether that person’s\nreproductive cells are the sort which produce ova or the sort which\nproduce sperm. (Frye 1983: 22) \nSingular personal pronoun usage, Frye argues, is impossible without\nknowing the sex of the person one is discussing, and in many cases sex\nwould otherwise be utterly irrelevant. Frye takes this to be an\ninstance of a general tendency to make sex relevant where it need not\nbe, which she takes to be a key feature of sexism. In addition, she\nsuggests, the constant need to know and indicate sex helps to\nperpetuate the conviction that sex is a tremendously important matter\nin all areas. For Frye, this is a key factor in perpetuating male\ndominance: male dominance requires the belief that men and women are\nimportantly different from each other, so anything that contributes to\nthe impression that sex differences are important is therefore a\ncontributor to male dominance. \nThe idea that some terms encode a male worldview is initially a\npuzzling one. One thing that is meant by it is, roughly, that the\nmeanings of certain terms seem to divide the world up in a way that is\nmore natural for men than for women. Good examples of this come from\nthe terms ‘foreplay’ and ‘sex’.\n‘Sex’ is generally taken to refer to an act that is\ndefined in terms of male orgasm, while the sexual activities during\nwhich many women have their orgasms are relegated to secondary status,\nreferred to by terms like ‘foreplay’. These terms, then,\ncan be seen as based in a male perspective on sex. (It is worth noting\nthat the ‘male perspective’ claim need not rest on the\n(implausible) idea that this perspective is shared by all men. Rather,\nit can rest on claims about what is typical for men, or on the claim\nthat the only perspective from which certain understandings make sense\nis a male one.) As a result, these terms may serve as a barrier to\naccurate communication or even thought about women’s experiences\nof sex (Cameron 1985; Moulton 1981b; Spender 1980 [1985]). Catharine\nMacKinnon and Sally Haslanger also discuss legal definitions of\n‘rape’ as (among other things) involving more than\n‘the normal level of force’, an understanding that seems\ncommitted to the idea that some level of force is acceptable in sexual\nrelations (Haslanger 1995: 109; MacKinnon 1989: 173). \nLanguages may also lack words for things that matter a great deal to\nwomen. This sort of gap is another way that a language can be seen as\nencoding a male worldview. The term ‘sexual harassment’,\nfor example, is a recent feminist innovation. Women’s discussion\nof their experiences led them to see a certain common element to many\nof their problems, and as a result they invented the term\n‘sexual harassment’. Once the problem was named, it became\nmuch easier to fight sexual harassment, both legally and by educating\npeople about it (Farley 1978; Spender 1985). \nMiranda Fricker (2007) calls gaps such as that before the invention of\nthe term ‘sexual harassment’ a form of hermeneutical\ninjustice. Roughly speaking, this is what occurs when “some\nsignificant area of one’s social experience [is] obscured from\ncollective understanding owing to” (2007: 155) a gap in communal\nlinguistic/conceptual resources that is more damaging to those from a\nsocially disadvantaged group (to which one belongs). In her\nEpistemic Injustice, Fricker connects this up with issues in\nboth ethics and epistemology, especially epistemology of\ntestimony.  We discuss this more fully in 2.4, below.  \nProblems like those we have seen so far are relatively easy to\ndiscern. Moreover, it may seem that they would be relatively easy to\ncorrect—new terms can be invented, or alternative words can be\nused. Much feminist effort has been devoted to this endeavour, and a\nhuge variety of reforms have been proposed (see, for example, Miller\nand Swift 1976, 1980, and the papers in part two of Cameron\n1998a). \nOne especially successful reform effort has been the increasingly\naccepted singular use of the third-person gender-neutral pronoun\n‘they’ (in place of ‘he’) as in the sentence\nbelow: \nSomebody left their sweater behind. \nA key reason for the success of this reform is perhaps the history of\nthe singular ‘they’. As Ann Bodine has noted (1975 [1998]), the\nsingular use of ‘they’ has a long history. It did not\nbegin to be criticized until the 19th century, and despite\nall the efforts of prescriptive grammarians it has remained very\npopular in speech. Due to feminist work on the effects of\n‘gender-neutral’ use of ‘he’, even\nprescriptive grammarians are now becoming more accepting of\n‘they’. In very recent years, it is also becoming\nincreasingly widespread to use ‘they’ as one’s\nchosen personal pronoun, or, less frequently, to use another\ngender-neutral option such as ‘ze’ (Bennett 2016; Dembroff and Wodak 2017). \nOther reform efforts have met with greater difficulties. Even some\nthat have caught on seem to have backfired. Susan Erlich and Ruth King\n(1992 [1998]), for example, discuss the case of ‘chairperson’,\nintended to serve as a gender-neutral replacement for\n‘chairman’. Instead, in many places it is often used to\nindicate women who fill the post of chair, while men are referred to\nas ‘chairman’. They take this to show that reforms cannot\nsucceed unless attitudes change as well. \nMoreover, feminist work on language has also indicated that there may\nbe problems which are simply not amenable to piecemeal linguistic\nreforms. Some difficulties that have been raised go well beyond a\nhandful of problematic terms or gaps. Deborah Cameron offers striking\nexamples of writing that take males as the norm without using any\nparticular terms to which one might object, such as the following,\nfrom The Sunday Times: \nThe lack of vitality is aggravated by the fact that there are so few\nable-bodied young adults about. They have all gone off to work or look\nfor work, leaving behind the old, the disabled, the women and the\nchildren. (Cameron 1985: 85) \nClearly, in the above example, ‘able-bodied young adult’\nis being used in such a way as to exclude women. Moreover, examples\nlike this (and others Cameron provides) pass unnoticed by newspaper\neditors and many readers. There is clearly a problem, but it is not a\nproblem that can be pinpointed by picking out some particular term as\nobjectionable and in need of reform. Eliminating language use that\ntakes males as the norm, then, must involve more than changing a few\nterms or usage rules. \nSome feminists (e.g., Penelope 1990; Spender 1985) argue that English\nis, in some quite general sense, male. (Corresponding arguments are\nalso put forward about other languages.) One thing that is meant by\nthis is that English can be said to be male in a manner similar to\nthat in which particular terms can be said to be male—by\nencoding a male worldview, by helping to subordinate women or to\nrender them invisible, or by taking males as the norm. One sort of\nargument for this begins from the examination of large quantities of\nspecific terms, and the identification of patterns of male bias, and\nproceeds from this to the conclusion that the male bias of English is\nso widespread that it is a mistake to locate the problem in a\ncollection of words, rather than in the language as a whole. The first\nstage of this sort of argument is, obviously, a lengthy and complex\none. The sorts of claims (in addition to those we have already seen)\ncited include (a) that there are more words for males than for females\nin English, and that more of these words are positive (Spender 1985:\n15, citing Julia Stanley 1977); (b) that a “word for women\nassume[s] negative connotations even where it designated the same\nstate or condition as it did for men” (Spender 1985: 17), as\nwith ‘spinster’ and ‘bachelor’; (c) that words\nfor women are far more frequently sexualized than words for men, and\nthat this holds true even for neutral words, when they are applied to\nwomen. Dale Spender, citing Lakoff (1975), discusses the example of\n‘professional’, comparing ‘he’s a\nprofessional’ and ‘she’s a professional’, and\nnoting that the latter is far more likely than the former to be taken\nto mean that the person in question is a prostitute. The sexualisation\nof words for women is considered especially significant by the many\nfeminists who take sexual objectification to be a crucial element, if\nnot the root, of inequalities between women and men. (For more on such\nexamples, see also Baker 1992.) \nThis widespread encoding of male bias in language is, according to\ntheorists like Spender, just what we should expect. Males (though not,\nas she notes, all of them) have had far more power in society, and\nthis, she claims has included the power to enforce, through language,\ntheir view of the world. Moreover, she argues, this has served to\nenhance their power. \nThere is sexism in language, it does enhance the\nposition of males, and males have had control over the\nproduction of cultural forms. (Spender 1985: 144) \nThis, Spender claims, provides circumstantial evidence that\n“males have encoded sexism into language to consolidate their\nclaims of male supremacy” (Spender 1985: 144). Spender takes the\nevidence for this claim to be far more than circumstantial, however,\nand to support it she discusses the efforts of prescriptive\ngrammarians. These include, for example, the claim that males should\nbe listed before females because “the male gender was the\nworthier gender” (Spender 1985: 147, emphasis hers),\nand the efforts (noted earlier) to establish ‘he’ as the\ngender-neutral third-person English pronoun. \nAccording to theorists like Spender, men’s ability to control\nlanguage gives them great power indeed. We have already seen ways in\nwhich what one might call the maleness of language contributes to the\ninvisibility of women (with respect to words like ‘he’ and\n‘man’). If one takes the maleness of language to go beyond\na few specific terms, one will take language’s power to make\nwomen invisible to be even stronger. We have also seen ways that what\nmight be called maleness can make it more difficult for women to\nexpress themselves. Where we lack words for important female\nexperiences, like sexual harassment, women will find it more difficult\nto describe key elements of their existence. Similarly, where the\nwords we have—like ‘foreplay’—systematically\ndistort women’s experiences, women will have a difficult time\naccurately conveying the realities of their lives. If one takes such\nproblems to go beyond selected particular terms, and to infect\nlanguage as a whole, it is natural to suppose that women are to a\nlarge degree silenced—unable to accurately articulate\nkey elements of their lives, and unable to communicate important\naspects of their thoughts. Spender and others also suggest that the\nmaleness of language constrains thought, imposing a male\nworldview on all of us, and making alternative visions of reality\nimpossible, or at least very difficult to articulate. These arguments\noften draw upon the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Sapir 1921; Whorf 1956). \nIt is generally formulated very vaguely, but seems to amount to roughly the hypothesis that “our\nworldview is determined by the structures of the particular language\nthat we happen to speak” (Cameron 1998b: 150). \nSome suggest that male power over language allows men to shape not\njust thought, but also reality. For example, Spender claims that men\n“created language, thought, and reality” (1985: 143). This\nis a very strong version of what Haslanger has called discursive\n constructivism.[3]\n She defines this view as follows: \nSomething is discursively constructed just in case it is the way it\nis, to some substantial extent, because of what is attributed (and/or\nself-attributed) to it. (Haslanger 1995: 99) \nFeminists like Spender and Catherine MacKinnon (1989) argue that male\npower over language has allowed them to create reality. This is partly\ndue to the fact that our categorizations of reality inevitably depend\non our social perspective: “there is no ungendered reality or\nungendered perspective” (MacKinnon 1989: 114). Haslanger (1995)\ndiscusses this argument in detail. \nIn general, the solution suggested is not to attempt to create a\nneutral language that can accurately capture reality in itself, a goal\nthey would take to be nonsense. Instead, we must aim to create a new\nreality more congenial to women. Some feminists have argued that the\nonly way to achieve this is for women to create their own language,\neither by redefining terms already in use, or by inventing a new\nlanguage, with new words and new rules. Only in this way, they\nsuggest, will women be able to break free from the constraints of male\nlanguage and male thought, to articulate a competing vision for the\nworld, and to work toward it (Daly and Caputi 1987; Elgin 1985;\nMacKinnon 1989; Penelope 1990; Spender 1985). Lynne Tirrell (1993)\noffers an especially sophisticated and complex discussion of this\nidea. \nThe claims discussed above concerning the maleness of\nEnglish, its causes, and its effects, are far from uncontentious.\nFirst, the extent of male bias in language is debatable. Although it\nis right that there is much to worry feminists about a wide variety of\nspecific terms and usages, it is far from clear that it is appropriate\nto claim that English is male-biased in some sweeping sense. It is\nalso unclear exactly what the claim being made is. If this claim is\ntaken to be that every term is male-biased, then it is highly implausible: it is very unlikely that there is a male bias present in\n‘piano’ or ‘isotope’. If the claim is simply\nthat there is much for feminists to object to, then it is almost\ncertainly right—but it is far from obvious that it is useful to\nfocus on such a general claim rather than on specific problems, their\ncomplexities and their possible solutions (Cameron 1998b). \nNext, the power that men have undeniably exercised in society (though, importantly, some groups of men have been vastly less powerful than others) by no\nmeans translates to a general power over language. Language is a\ndifficult thing to control, as those who have attempted to create\nlanguages have learned. The main power men have had has concerned\ndictionaries, usage guides, and laws. While these are enormously\nimportant in shaping reality, and in shaping our thoughts, it is quite\na leap to move from this power to the claim that men ‘created\nlanguage, thought, and reality’. \nThe claimed effects of the maleness of language are also problematic.\nWe have already seen problems for the idea that men control language.\nThe idea that men also control or create thought and reality faces\nfurther problems. The ability of feminists to successfully point out\nways in which elements of language have obscured women’s\nexperiences counts strongly against the claim that men control thought\n(Cameron 1998b); and, as Haslanger (1995) has argued in detail,\ndiscursive constructivism about reality is unsustainable. Nonetheless,\nit does seem right to notice that problems with specific terms can\nrender it more difficult for women to communicate about important\nelements of their lives, and probably also more difficult to reflect\nupon these elements (Hornsby 1995). These difficulties could perhaps\nbe described as partial silencing, partial constraint of thought, or\nhermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007), which we discuss more fully in\n2.4. \nIf the criticisms above are right, then women certainly do not need to\ncreate their own language. Many welcome this conclusion, worried that\na women’s language would doom women’s thoughts to\nmarginality and impede feminist progress. Moreover, the idea that\nwomen could craft a common language that allowed the articulation of\nall their experiences seems to ignore the fact that women differ\nenormously from one another (Crenshaw 1991; Lugones and Spelman 1983; Spelman 1988;\nsee the section on\n feminism and the diversity of women\n in the entry on\n feminist philosophy).\n If women cannot use the same language as men, why should we suppose\nthat women can successfully share a language? \nFeminists have also devoted attention to another aspect of\nlanguage—the use of metaphor (see the section Feminist Critiques\nand Conceptions of Objectivity in the entry on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science;\n and the entry on\n feminist approaches to the intersection of pragmatism and continental philosophy).\n In particular, feminists have discussed the use of gendered metaphors\nin philosophy and in\n science.[4]\n Emily Martin (1991 [1996]) offers particularly vivid examples in her\ndiscussion of the use of gendered metaphors in discussions of human\nreproduction. \nAt its extreme, the age-old relationship of the egg and the sperm\ntakes on a royal or religious patina. The egg coat, its protective\nbarrier, is sometimes called its ‘vestments’, a term\nusually reserved for sacred, religious dress. The egg is said to have\na ‘corona’, a crown, and to be accompanied by\n‘attendant cells’. It is holy, set apart and above, the\nqueen to the sperm’s king. The egg is also passive, which means\nit must depend on the sperm for rescue. Gerald Schatten and Helen\nSchatten liken the egg’s role to that of Sleeping Beauty:\n‘a dormant bride awaiting her mate’s magic kiss, which\ninstills the spirit that brings her to life’. Sperm, by\ncontrast, have a ‘mission’ which is to ‘move through\nthe female genital tract in quest of the ovum’. One popular\naccount has it that the sperm carry out a ‘perilous\njourney’ into the ‘warm darkness’, where some fall\naway ‘exhausted’. ‘Survivors’\n‘assault’ the egg, the successful candidates\n‘surrounding the prize’… (Martin 1996: 106) \nThe vision of reproduction suggested above is an inaccurate one. The\nsperm fails to behave in the single-minded manner suggested. Instead,\nthe  \nsideways motion of the sperm’s tail makes the head move sideways\nwith a force that is ten times stronger than its forward\nmovement…in fact, its strongest tendency, by tenfold, is to\nescape by attempting to pry itself off the egg. (Martin 1996: 108)\n \nNor is the egg passive: adhesive molecules on its surface play a\ncrucial role in overcoming the sperm’s tendency to pry itself\naway (Martin 1996: 108). Martin argues that scientists have been slow\nto discover these facts, partly due to the metaphors they employed;\nand that even as they have learned these facts they have been slow to\nupdate their metaphors. Gendered stereotypes, Martin suggests, can\nimpair our understanding of reproduction—by leading scientists\nto employ misleading metaphors that conceal the truth. The use of\ngendered stereotypes in scientific imagery can also help to perpetuate\ndamaging stereotypes, for example by reinforcing the tendency to see\nfemales as passive. Martin’s account has, however, been\nchallenged by Paul Gross (1998), who argues that scientists were not\nnearly so slow to these discoveries as Martin claimed. If Gross is\nright, then the problematic metaphors did not affect scientists’\nwork in the ways suggested by Martin (though they do seem to have\naffected popular writing on the subject.) \nGendered metaphors have been used at many levels of discussion,\nincluding the most general. An important topic of feminist concern has\nbeen the historical tendency to conceive of the scientific endeavour\nin gendered ways. A particularly clear example comes from Francis\nBacon, discussed by both Evelyn Fox Keller and Genevieve Lloyd: \nFor Bacon, the promise of science is expressed as ‘leading you\nto Nature with all her children to bind her to your service and make\nher your slave’. (Keller 1996: 36.) \nThe tendency to describe nature in feminine terms is a long-standing\nand widespread one, well-documented in Lloyd (1984). Lloyd links this\nto a tendency to describe reason and the mind as male, and to contrast\nthese with supposedly feminine emotions and bodies. She argues that\nthese metaphors play a powerful role in the history of philosophy,\nshaping and often distorting our views both of reason, mind, emotion,\nand body and of men and women. Other important discussions of gendered\nmetaphors in philosophy include Irigaray (1974 [1985a], 1977 [1985b]),\nLe Dœuff (1980 [1990]), and Nye (1990, 1992). \nIn the early days of feminist philosophy of language, much attention\nwas devoted to ways that philosophy of language was problematic from a\nfeminist point of view. One sort of criticism was that philosophy of\nlanguage, like English, displays a male bias. Another was simply that\nphilosophy of language is ill-equipped to further feminist aims. Those\nmaking these criticisms did not suggest that philosophy of language be\nabandoned, but rather that it should be reformed—purged of male\nbias and turned into a discipline that can help in the attainment of\nfeminist ends. \nWhat reasons were given for supposing that philosophy of language is\nill suited to achieving feminist ends? There were a variety of reasons\n(Hintikka and Hintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000; Nye 1996, 1998), but one\ncommon thread involves the idea that philosophy of language is\nexcessively individualistic. Criticism of individualism in philosophy\nis widespread in many areas of feminism. Exactly what\n‘individualism’ comes to varies depending upon the area of\nphilosophy under discussion, and depending also on the concerns of the\nparticular critic. (For more on what feminists mean by\n‘individualism’, see Antony 1995.) Because of this, we\nwill not attempt a general definition of ‘individualism’,\nas used by those raising these concerns. However, we will sketch what\nseems to be at issue in concerns over philosophy of language. Some\nclaim that philosophy of language focuses excessively on the states of\nmind of individual speakers—in particular on their intentions\n(Hornsby 2000). Jennifer Hornsby’s central example of this\ntendency is the work of H. P. Grice, which does indeed analyse speaker\nmeaning in terms of speaker intentions. (Although it is worth noting\nthat that Grice’s analysis of sentence meaning incorporates\nsocial elements, and that both speaker and audience are essential to\nhis notion of conversational implicature. For more on this, see Saul\n2002.) Others suggest that semantics assigns too important a role to\nthe notion of reference to discrete individuals (Hintikka and Hintikka\n1983). Their focus is on Alfred Tarski’s truth definitions\n(Tarski 1956; see also entry on\n Tarski’s truth definitions)\n and Richard Montague’s work (Thomason 1974). \nIndividualism of this sort is said to be problematic for several\nreasons. One common claim is that this sort of individualism is\ncharacteristic of male thinking. Men tend, according to this line of\nthought, to be interested in separate, discrete individuals; while\nwomen are interested in connections and relationships. Thus, it is\nsuggested, an individualistic philosophy of language is one that\nrepresents a male way of thinking about the world. For philosophy of\nlanguage to be true to the experiences and language use of both men\nand women, then, the individualistic philosophy of language which is\ncharacteristic of male thinking will need to be supplemented or\nreplaced by a version more suited to female thinking (Hintikka and\nHintikka 1983; Hornsby 2000). As Haslanger (2000a) and others have\nnoted, however, the claims regarding male and female thinking on which\nthis line of thought depends are not well supported. Moreover,\ndifferences among women give us reason to doubt the prospects for any\nsupportable generalizations about ‘women’s’ thinking\n(Ang 1995, Lorde 1983, Lugones and Spelman 1983; Moody-Adams 1991). \nOther objections to individualism do not depend upon contentious\npsychological claims about differences between women and men. Instead,\nthey suggest that the real problem with individualism is its failure\nto appreciate the importance of the social. The social world is,\nnaturally, an important area of concern when discussing politics and\npower relations. Understanding how people come to dominate one\nanother, and exactly how this domination functions, are important\nprojects for feminists. Language is an important part of the social\nworld, and understanding the roles that language plays in\ncommunicating, manipulating, and controlling (to cite just a few\nexamples) is surely vital to understanding the workings of power (see,\nfor example, MacKinnon’s views on speech in MacKinnon 1993). So,\nmany feminists suggest, a philosophy of language that is appropriate\nto understanding communicative interactions in the social world could\nbe a valuable tool for feminists. However, they insist that the\nindividualism of philosophy of language (as it is now) prevents it\nfrom serving this function (Hornsby 2000). \nThe general charge that philosophy of language pays little attention\nto the social world is not one that all feminists would agree with.\nIndeed, it is a difficult one to sustain in light of the prominence\nof—to give a few examples—Saul Kripke’s causal\ntheory of reference (1972; see also Section 2 of the entry on\n reference),\n Hilary Putnam’s arguments for a social element (the division of\nlinguistic labor) in the working of kind terms (1975; see also Section\n3 of the entry on\n reference),\n H.P. Grice’s theory of conversation (1975 [1989]), David\nLewis’s work on convention (1969), and J.L. Austin’s\nspeech act theory (1962 [1975]). Nonetheless, one might well suggest\nthat philosophers of language have generally attended only to aspects\nof the social world that are not of particular interest to feminists.\nWhile causal theories of reference undeniably involve social elements,\nthese social elements don’t seem to be of the sort that concern\nfeminists; while Putnam’s division of linguistic labour arguably\ninvolves some power relations (experts have a special sort of\nlinguistic power that non-experts lack), the political aspects of\nthese power relations—if any—have been ignored. Andrea Nye\ncriticizes mainstream philosophy of language on roughly these grounds,\narguing that work on radical translation has not been sufficiently\nsensitive to political concerns (for the notion of radical\ntranslation, see the section on Meaning and Truth in the entry on\n Donald Davidson). \n…a highly technical and professionalized English-speaking\nphilosophy of language was addressing problems of the possibility of\n‘radical’ translation from one language community to\nanother, of alternate and incommensurable conceptual schemes, of the\ndifficulty of establishing singular reference across ‘different\nworlds’, but with virtually no reference to actual failures of\ncommunication or problems of gender. (Nye 1998: 266) \nMore recently, Louise Antony has argued that it is a mistake to\nsuppose that there is any particular approach to philosophy of\nlanguage that is distinctly feminist or anti-feminist, taking as her\nparticular target Hornsby’s work—but her arguments apply\nmore broadly. She argues that such strategies are “disrespectful\nto and exclusionary of feminists who support alternative views”\n(2012: 277). \nThings have changed a great deal in recent years, and it is now widely\naccepted that philosophy of language has something to offer feminists,\nand even (though less widely) that feminists have something to offer\nphilosophy of language. Feminist philosophy of language is now\nbecoming a well-established area of the larger field, with several\nsubstantial positive research programmes. \nThe first substantial analytic research programme in feminist\nphilosophy of language began with Rae Langton’s and\nHornsby’s use of speech act theory to make sense of Catharine\nMacKinnon’s suggestion that pornography silences and\nsubordinates women. It has now, however, evolved well beyond those\nbeginnings. To give some flavour of this initial work, we\nbriefly summarise Langton’s discussion of silencing. \nAccording to Langton (1993), pornography helps to bring about rape by\nperlocutionarily and illocutionarily silencing women. Following\nAustin, Langton distinguishes between locutionary, illocutionary, and\nperlocutionary acts. A locutionary act is, roughly, the act of\nuttering words that have particular meanings; a perlocutionary act is,\nroughly, the act of uttering words that have a particular effect; and\nan illocutionary act is the act done in uttering the words. Consider,\nfor example, Jennifer Saul’s utterance one day of the sentence\n‘I pledge my allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen and all her\nheirs’. The locutionary act she performed was simply the\nutterance of a sentence with a particular meaning. This act had many\nperlocutionary effects: it made it possible for her to get a British\npassport, it made her feel slightly disturbed at having expressed such\nmonarchist sentiments, and it made her wonder whether a republic,\nshould it succeed the Queen, would count as an heir. The illocutionary\nact she performed was that of becoming a British citizen. \nLangton proposes that there are forms of silencing corresponding to\neach of these sorts of speech act. A person is locutionarily silenced\nif she is prevented from speaking, or intimidated into not speaking. A\nperson is illocutionarily silenced if she is unable to carry out the\nacts that she intends to carry out in speaking. A person is\nperlocutionarily silenced when her speech cannot have its intended\neffects. Langton is particularly concerned with the role that\nperlocutionary and illocutionary silencing may play in rape. A\nwoman’s refusal to have sex is perlocutionarily silenced\nif—even though she is recognized as refusing—she is forced\nto have sex. Her (attempted) refusal to have sex is illocutionarily\nsilenced if it is not even recognized as a refusal. (For an\nexploration of the role of conventions in this illocutionary\nsilencing, see Wyatt 2009.) In such a case, according to Langton, it\nisn’t a refusal. She suggests that pornography plays a\nkey role in making men less able to recognise women’s refusals\nas refusals and more willing to rape women even when they recognise\nwomen’s refusals. This means, she argues, that pornography\nillocutionarily and perlocutionarily silences women. And this\nsilencing is an important one, as it results in rape. \nThis example can also help us to see that some elements of\nindividualism may be indispensable to feminism (for more arguments to\nthis effect, see Antony 1995). Assuming that Langton’s arguments\nare sound, we can see an important role for individualistic philosophy\nof language in feminism. Although it is right that focusing\nexclusively on individual speakers’ intentions would prevent us\nfrom seeing some important facts (as Hornsby 2000 argues), it also\nvital to recognise the importance of paying some attention to an\nindividual speaker’s intentions. In order to understand what has\ngone wrong in the illocutionary silencing described above, one needs\nto understand that the woman intended to be refusing sex. In\norder to understand what has gone wrong in the perlocutionary\nsilencing example, one needs to understand that the woman\nintended her refusal to bring it about that she did not have\nsex. More generally, not being understood properly is an important\nelement of life in a subordinate position, as many feminists have\nnoted. In order to make sense of not being understood properly, one\nneeds to attend to what the speaker intended and how the\naudience understood the speaker, and how these things differ. To\ndo this, one needs to look at individual states of mind. \nThese discussions have inspired a now substantial literature. Below, we\ngive some very non-comprehensive pointers to this literature. \nThis use of speech act theory was one of the first developments of\nfeminist philosophy of language to gain mainstream currency, and it\nhas become widely taught and studied. Recently, however, sharply\ncritical feminist voices have started to emerge. Separately, and for\ndifferent reasons, Nancy Bauer (2015) and Lorna Finlayson (2014), have\nboth argued that the feminist literature on speech acts and\npornography is deeply misguided. Bauer objects on several grounds. She\nthinks it is misguided to treat pornography as speech, and she (like\nother critics noted above) argues that pornography should not be seen\nas authoritative. Her more fundamental critique, though, is that this\nliterature fails to take seriously the realities of both pornography\nand women’s subordination—by not engaging sufficiently\nwith the phenomenology of pornography use; by not attending to all the\nways that the broader culture is involved in subordinating women; and\nby focusing on just women’s verbal acts of refusal, thereby\nfailing to appreciate the fuller dehumanization involved in sexual\nassault. This is part of a broader critique, for Bauer, of both\nanalytic philosophy in general, and widespread understandings of\nAustin. Finlayson goes even further, arguing not that Austin’s\nwork was misused by feminists but that it never should have been used\nat all. She suggests that the feminist foray into speech act theory\nwas entirely unnecessary, and also that the focus on pornography was\nmisguided. \nBut there have also been very substantial developments broadening and\nbuilding upon the feminist use of speech theory—extending it to\nissues like racist speech, and hate speech more generally. McGowan\n(2009a) argues for the existence of a different sort of silencing due\nto pornography; and in her 2009b she argues that speech may be counted\nnot just as silencing or subordinating, but also as oppressing.\nMoreover, she suggests that oppressive speech is likely to be a very\nwidespread phenomenon. These ideas are developed further in McGowan\n(2012), which takes as its focus racist speech, and in Simpson (2013).\nMaitra (2012) also applies ideas from feminist work on subordinating\nspeech to racist speech. Langton also turns her attention to hate\nspeech more broadly, including in her 2012. This paper is also notable\nfor its focus on the role of pragmatics in shaping attitudes other\nthan belief. Rachel McKinney (2016), “Extracted Speech”,\nbuilds on this literature by exploring the ways that speech may be\nunjustly extracted rather than silenced (as in, for example, the\nparadigm case of the Central Park Five’s false confessions).\nRebecca Kukla introduces the notion of discursive injustice, in order\nto discuss a broader range of ways that “members of a\ndisadvantaged group face a systematic inability to produce a specific\nkind of speech act they are entitled to perform” (2014: 440),\nwhich often takes the form of performing a different speech act from\nthe one that they intend. Although she draws on Langton and Hornsby,\nshe abandons their focus on illocution and perlocution, focussing\ninstead simply on performative force. Also considering the role of\npragmatics in politics (though developed independently from Langton\nand Hornsby), Marina Sbisà (1999) explores the role of\npresuppositions in political persuasion. Finally, Jason Stanley (2015)\ndraws heavily on Langton and Hornsby’s work in developing his\naccount of propaganda (focused, but not exclusively, on racist\npropaganda). \nIn her ground-breaking paper “Gender and Race: (What) Are They?\n(What) Do We Want Them To Be?” (2000b), Haslanger aims to\nprovide an account of the nature of gender, as well as an account of\nthe meaning of ‘woman’. She assumes the classical\ndistinction between sex and gender, where sex is supposed to\nrefer to biological or anatomical properties distinguishing males from\nfemales (although as she argues, this distinction is flexible and\npermeated by social and political factors too), and gender is\nsupposed to refer to social or cultural factors distinguishing men\nfrom women (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender).\n One of the main virtues of Haslanger’s article is that she\nmakes explicit the methodological approach that she endorses, to wit:\nshe famously distinguishes between a descriptive project,\nwhich aims to reveal the concept that we actually use or the property\nthat we actually track with our usage of the term, and an\nanalytical project (or an ameliorative project, as\nshe calls it in Haslanger 2006), which aims to reveal the concept that\nwe should use or the meaning that we should associate to the\ncorresponding term, given our purposes and aims in that inquiry. As\nshe makes clear, she is following the analytical or ameliorative\napproach, with the explicit aim of providing an account of the meaning\nof ‘gender’ and ‘woman’ that could be a useful\ntool in order to fight sexism and help to achieve social justice. With\nthis purpose in mind, she comes up with the following definition of\nthe term ‘woman’, as one particular type of gender: \nS is a woman iffdefS is\nsystematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political,\nlegal, social, etc.) and S is “marked” as a target\nfor this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to\nbe evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.\n(2000b: 39) \nAs we can see, the main idea of Haslanger’s account is that\ngender is a hierarchical social structure, where some members are\nsituated in a position of privilege and some other members are\nsituated in a position of subordination along social, economic,\npolitical, legal, or cultural dimensions, in virtue of their real or\nimagined biological role in reproduction. And more particularly, being\na woman corresponds to occupying a specific position of subordination\nwith respect to this social structure, due to one’s perceived or\nimagined biologically female bodily features.  \nHaslanger’s proposal gave rise to a rich debate about the\nvirtues of an ameliorative approach, and the advantages and problems\nof this particular account. For instance, Saul (2006b) argued that\nthis proposed usage of the term ‘woman’ could have some\nproblematic consequences, such as feminists having to advocate for the\neradication of women, since feminists advocate for the eradication of\nthe subordination of people in terms of their biological role in\nreproduction. For this reason, Saul argued, this might not be the most\nadvantageous way of using the term ‘woman’. In addition,\nSaul argued that the folk or ordinary concept of ‘woman’\ndoes not really distinguish between sex as a biological feature and\ngender as a social or cultural feature. Following up on this, Mikkola\n(2011b) argued that it might be very costly to revise the ordinary\nmeaning of ‘woman’ in considerable ways as Haslanger\nsuggests, since this might jeopardize communication, in addition to\nthe fact that gender identity and the label ‘woman’ might\nbe a source of identity and pride for many women. Therefore, to\ncharacterize being a woman in terms of being subordinated, as\nHaslanger does, might not be politically useful for the aims of\nfeminism. Mikkola (2011b) put forward an alternative account of\n‘woman’ that does not endorse the sex/gender distinction:\nrather, she proposed a trait/norm covariance model, according\nto which there are different traits that are assigned to men or women\n(or males or females) at a certain context, and that are expected to\nbe followed and instantiated. However, the different traits that are\nassigned to men or to women are heavily context-dependent and\nflexible, and it is possible to revise both the assignment of traits\nand the norms and expectations involving them, in virtue of many kinds\nof factors, including moral and political considerations. \nMore recently, several feminists have argued that an account of\n‘woman’ along the lines of Haslanger’s proposal\nmight fail to do justice to the aims of trans women, which should be\ncentral for the purposes of feminism. For example, Saul (2012) argues\nthat neither standard sex-based accounts nor standard gender-based\naccounts are automatically going to be inclusive of trans women, since\n(at least some) trans women could arguably turn out to be excluded\nfrom the extension of the term ‘woman’ when defined in\nterms of biological features, or in terms of certain social and\ncultural factors that are usually attributed to biologically female\nindividuals. Saul put forward a possible alternative view, namely, a\ncontextualist view of the meaning of ‘woman’, as\nfollows: \nX is a woman is true in a context C iff\nX is human and relevantly similar (according to the standards\nat work in C) to most of those possessing all of the biological\nmarkers of female sex. (2012: 201) \nAccording to this account, an individual will fall under the extension\nof ‘woman’ in a certain context when she is sufficiently\nsimilar to those who are biologically female, given the standards of\nsimilarity that are relevant in such context, where these standards\ncan vary from context to context. Saul argues that at first sight,\nthis view seems to give the right results, since it would classify\ntrans women as women in most contexts where, say, self-identifying as\na woman is what is deemed relevant, but on further reflection, she\nargues, the view can give unwanted results. For example, in a\nconservative community where most speakers take for granted that trans\nwomen should not be allowed to use women’s toilets, their usage\nof ‘woman’ would be such that trans women would not fall\nunder the term, since the relevant criterion of similarity in that\ncontext that those conservative speakers have in mind seems to be\nsomething like having certain chromosomes or certain anatomical\nfeatures, which some trans women lack. In response to this worry, E.\nDiaz-Leon (2016) has argued that we can understand the contextualist\nview in a way that avoids this objection. In particular, she argues,\nwe can understand the relevant standards of similarity at work in each\ncontext as those criteria that are the most politically useful, given\nthe aims and purposes that are morally salient in that context. For\nexample, in the context of a conservative community where trans women\nare not allowed to use women’s toilets, there are moral reasons\nfor focusing on criteria such as self-identifying as a woman, rather\nthan having certain biological features, and this is what makes this\ncriterion the relevant one in that context, and hence what fixes the\nextension of ‘woman’ in that context, as required. \nTalia Bettcher (2013) has also argued that ameliorative accounts of\nthe meaning of ‘woman’ should take into account the aims\nof trans women. She argues that “single-meaning” views, according to which ‘woman’ has a unique meaning that is shared by all speakers, cannot do justice to those aims. Instead, she puts forward a “multiple-meaning” account, according to which there are several co-existing meanings of the term ‘woman’ in our society, but where some of those meanings embed world-views that are not only morally and politically problematic, but also factually misguided, such as using ‘woman’ in a trans-exclusionary way. Because of this, we have good reasons for using the term ‘woman’ in our speech with the trans-inclusive meaning that trans-friendly communities already associate with the term. She also argues that although it is methodologically useful to rely on intuitions, “it is inappropriate to dismiss alternative ways in which those terms are actually used in trans subcultures; such usage needs to be taken into consideration as part of the analysis” (2013: 235). \nMore recently, Katharine\nJenkins (2016) has argued that Haslanger’s original proposal\nexcluded trans women from the extension of the term\n‘woman’, which is morally and politically problematic. As\nJenkins argues, trans women who do not pass as cis women\n(that is, those women who were assigned female at birth) do not occupy\na position of subordination in virtue of their perceived or\nimagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female\nbiological role in reproduction, since they are not presumed to have a\nfemale biological role in reproduction (given that they do not pass as\ncis women). For this reason, Haslanger’s account cannot capture\nthe self-identity of those trans women as women, and the ways in which\nthey are subordinated in virtue of their gender identity. In order to\nsolve this problem, Jenkins proposes an ingenious account of gender in\nterms of two elements, namely, gender as a social class, and gender as\nsocial identity, where the former is similar to Haslanger’s\nnotion of gender as social structures, and the latter has to do with\nour own perceptions of our own positioning within those social\nstructures. Following Haslanger’s (2005) account of racial\nidentity, Jenkins suggests an account of gender identity in terms of\nmental maps that serve to guide our own behavior, norms and\nexpectations within the social niches that we live in. (For criticism of Jenkins’ account as insufficiently inclusive of trans women, see Andler 2017.) \nIn this section we have focused on semantic accounts of the\nmeaning of ‘woman’, although recently there has also been\nan explosion of work about the related questions of the\nmetaphysics of gender as a social class, and biological sex\nas a contested category. Some of these discussions have implications\nfor the meanings of the corresponding terms of ‘woman’ and\n‘female’. For example, Saray Ayala and Nadya Vasilyeva\n(2015) provide an account of biological sex in terms of extended,\nflexible biological features, where which features count for being\nmale or female can change from context to context, depending on our\naims and purposes, and where those extended biological features can be\ntaken to incorporate features of the environment, artificial bodily\nfeatures, and so on. On the other hand, Helen Daly (2015) has argued\nthat we should favour accounts of ‘female’ and\n‘woman’ that do not assume a sharp cut-off point between\nthose who fall under the term and those who do not, since this is\nmorally and politically problematic. In addition, Jennifer McKitrick\n(2015) has argued that an account of gender in terms of dispositions\nto behave in certain ways can be politically useful, and can capture\nthe aims of trans women. Finally, Haslanger (2016) has defended a\ncontext-sensitive account of ‘sex’, where the term can\nhave different meanings, depending on the aims and purposes of the\ninquiry in that context. \nAs we saw in the previous section, Haslanger (2000b) brought attention\nto the need for revisionary or ameliorative approaches in feminist\nphilosophy, as opposed to purely conceptual or descriptive approaches,\nwhich focus on the concept we have or the objective type that we\nactually track. The idea of a revisionary or ameliorative approach to\nthe analysis of our concepts has been a very influential one in\nphilosophy, but Haslanger’s work has served as a kind of\nreminder of the significance of aiming for the concepts that would\nbest serve our purposes and aims, rather than merely revealing the\nordinary concepts that we happen to have, which is the task that many\nprojects in recent mainstream analytic philosophy seem to have paid\nattention to. Haslanger’s work has inspired a lot of interesting\nameliorative projects in philosophy of gender and race and social\nphilosophy more in general (see for instance Glasgow 2006, 2009 and\nMallon 2006 on ‘race’, Barnes 2016 on\n‘disability’, Dembroff 2016 on ‘sexual\norientation’, as well as many of the papers on\n‘woman’, ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ cited\nin the previous section). As suggested above, the notion of an\nameliorative project in philosophy is not new, but in our view the\nimpetus that this methodological approach in philosophy has\nexperienced recently owes much to the centrality that this notion has\nplayed in recent developments in philosophy of gender and race over\nthe last two decades. \nAs ameliorative projects are becoming more common in mainstream\nanalytic philosophy, they have given rise to a careful examination of\nthe methodological foundations and the metaphysical, semantic and\nepistemic aspects of the ameliorative approach, as well as its moral\nand political implications. Alexis Burgess and David Plunkett\n(2013a,b) have usefully surveyed these and related issues pertaining\nto ameliorative projects in philosophy, and have coined a new label:\nconceptual ethics. They intend this new term to refer to the\nphilosophical reflection about the terms and concepts that we ought to\nuse in different areas, given our best normative reasoning, as well as\nthe methodological and philosophical issues to which these projects\ngive rise. Examples include the nature of the values and normative\nconsiderations that should guide our choice of terms and concepts, as\nwell as semantic questions about the nature and possibility of\nconceptual change and conceptual revision, among many others. One of\nthe advantages of having this new label is that discussions on these\nnormative issues about our talk and thought that were formerly\nscattered can now be more unified and more systematic. \nAnother term that is becoming prominent in this area is that of\nconceptual engineering, which is supposed to refer to\nameliorative projects that aim to revise our current concepts and\nengineer new concepts that can better serve our main purposes. This\nterm originates from discussions about Carnap’s methodological\ninsights (see for instance French 2015 for a useful overview), but is\nnow being used in a more general, encompassing sense. Several\nphilosophers have recently argued that we could understand many\ntraditional debates in philosophy as debates in conceptual ethics or\nconceptual engineering (see for instance Floridi 2011 and Plunkett\n2015). \nAs we saw above, Fricker (2007) argues that there is a distinctive\nkind of injustice that has to do with the inability to properly\nunderstand and communicate important aspects of one’s social\nexperience: she calls this hermeneutical injustice. According\nto Fricker, people in a position of marginalization are prevented from\ncreating concepts, terms and other representational resources that\ncould be used in order to conceptualize and understand their own\nexperiences, especially those having to do with being in that position\nof marginalization. People in a position of power will tend to create\nconcepts and linguistic representations that help to conceptualize the\nexperiences and phenomena that matter to them, rather than\nthe experiences and phenomena that matter the most to people in a\nposition of marginalization. Because of this, members of marginalized\ngroups might suffer from a lacuna in the representational resources\nthat are available to them, and in particular might lack the concepts\nand terms that would allow them to understand and communicate their\nexperiences. In order to illustrate this phenomenon, Fricker (2007)\nfocuses on several examples, such as the articulation of the term\n‘sexual harassment’: before the term was coined, victims\nof sexual harassment lacked the language to explain their experiences\nof receiving unwanted sexual advances at work in a way that would make\nclear why those interactions wronged them. \nIn the growing literature on hermeneutical injustice, philosophers\nhave mainly focused on the following two central questions: first, how\nto properly understand the phenomenon of hermeneutical injustice\n(namely, what is distinctively epistemic about it, and what\nmakes it unjust); and secondly, how to resist this kind of\ninjustice and how to fill in the corresponding conceptual and\nlinguistic gaps in our collective understanding of situations of\nmarginalization. \nRegarding the first question, Laura Beeby (2011) has argued that the\nrelevant notion of hermeneutical injustice is one that focuses on the\nepistemic situation of lacking the relevant concepts and terms, rather\nthan on one’s position within the background social conditions\nthat give rise to it. She argues that, for example, in the case of\nsexual harassment both the victim and the harasser suffer from\nhermeneutical injustice since they both have similar epistemic\nsituations, that is, they both have similar gaps in their collective\nunderstanding of what is going on. As Beeby argues, if we offer a\ncharacterization of hermeneutical injustice in terms of the\nepistemic situation of the subject, and in particular in\nterms of their conceptual gaps, then both the harasser and that\nharassee will be in a situation of hermeneutical injustice, but this\nseems to be in tension with Fricker’s claim that only the victim\nsuffers from hermeneutical injustice. However, as Beeby also\nemphasizes, one could respond, following Fricker, that people in a\nposition of power are epistemically advantaged in another sense,\nnamely, they do have the ability to create concepts and terms that are\nuseful in order to understand and communicate their own experiences\nand the social interactions that matter the most to them. This\ncontrasts with the situation of the marginalized, who lack this\nability. \nHowever, the idea that the marginalized lack the ability to\nconceptualize and communicate their own experiences has also been\ncontested by philosophers such as Rebecca Mason (2011), Kristie Dotson\n(2012), Gaile Pohlhaus (2012) and José Medina (2013). For\nexample, Mason (2011) and Medina (2013) have both argued that although\nFricker is right that people in a situation of marginalization might\nnot have access to publicly shared terms in order to communicate their\nexperiences to those in a position of power, they might nonetheless be\nable to make sense of their own experiences in a useful way, even\nbefore those public concepts are introduced in the dominant language.\nFor example, in the case of sexual harassment, some victims of sexual\nharassment were able to attend women’s consciousness-raising\nmeetings and talk to each other about their similar experiences, that\nis to say, they were able to understand their experiences and\ncommunicate them to people in the same predicament, even before they\nhad a term like ‘sexual harassment’. Therefore, Mason\n(2011) argues, it seems plausible to say that members of marginalized\ngroups already have some conceptual resources that enable them to\nunderstand their own social experiences, and what they actually lack\nis the power to introduce these meanings into the collective\nunderstanding, which is unjust, and which results in the fact that\ndominant groups have a distorted understanding of the social\nexperiences of non-dominant groups. Relatedly, Pohlhaus (2012) has\nargued that marginalized subjects are in a better position to notice\ngaps in our collective epistemic resources in order to properly\ndescribe and conceptualize the experiences of those who are socially\noppressed. Moreover, these subjects could work cooperatively with\nother subjects in the same predicament so as to develop new epistemic\nresources that can deal with those spheres of the social world that\npeople in a position of domination do not usually pay attention to.\nHowever, as Pohlhaus argues, it will be difficult to convince the\nprivileged to employ those new epistemic resources developed by the\nmarginalized. She calls this phenomenon of dismissive ignorance\nwillful hermeneutical ignorance. \nFurthermore, Dotson (2012)\nhas introduced a new kind of epistemic injustice, in addition to\ntestimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice, namely, what she\ncalls contributory injustice. This kind of epistemic\ninjustice has to do not only with the phenomenon of willfully ignoring\nthe epistemic resources developed by the marginalized, but also with\nthe continuous use of distorted epistemic resources developed by those\nin a position of power, without paying attention to the experiences of\nthe marginalized. This use of faulty conceptual resources acts to\nblock the uptake of the new conceptual resources developed by the\nmarginalized, which leads to further misunderstandings. In addition,\nMedina (2013) has argued that the fact that members of non-dominant\ngroups have the ability to understand their own experiences and\ncommunicate them to each other is a prior and necessary step in order\nto bring new, more sophisticated concepts and terms into our shared\nlanguage. According to Medina, this can also help with our second\nquestion above, namely, how to resist hermeneutical injustice: he\nsuggests that members of dominant groups should be more sensitive to\ninchoate attempts at communication by people in a position of\nsubordination, even before they have access to shared concepts to\nproperly conceptualize those aspects of our social interactions. Finally, Derek E. Anderson (2017) distinguishes a new kind of epistemic injustice, namely, conceptual competence injustice, which occurs when a marginalized subject is not considered to be a competent user of a concept, because of a lack of linguistic or conceptual credibility, when in fact they are perfectly competent. This is different from hermeneutical injustice, Anderson argues, since in cases of hermeneutical injustice marginalized subjects lack access to some important concepts due to structural reasons, whereas in cases of conceptual competence injustice they fully possess the concepts but are regarded as incompetent speakers. However, this kind of injustice is closely related to Dotson’s notion of contributory injustice, since in cases where privileged subjects use distorted or biased hermeneutical resources, they will be more likely to doubt the conceptual competence of marginalized subjects (even if these are in fact more fully competent), which amounts to conceptual competence injustice, and hence the conceptual resources of the marginalized will in turn be less likely to get uptake, which amounts to contributory injustice. \nFinally, regarding the question of what kinds of conceptual resources might be\nneeded in order to fill in the hermeneutical gaps in our collective\nunderstandings, Komarine Romdenh-Romluc (2016) argues that what is\nneeded are new terms and concepts that have the correct\nevaluative component, in addition to the right descriptive\ncomponent. For instance, introducing the term ‘sexual\nharassment’ was very useful because the new term somehow implies\nthat sexual harassment is wrong, whereas previous terms such as\n‘harmless flirting’ did not connote the appropriate\nnegative evaluative component. Likewise, as Medina (2013) argues, the\nappropriation of terms such as ‘gay’ and\n‘queer’ by the LGBT community can be seen as a strategy\nfor overcoming a situation of hermeneutical injustice, since these\nterms came to express new, positive conceptions of same-sex desire, in\ncontrast to old conceptions of it as something pathological or\nperverse. In addition, George Hull (forthcoming) argues that\nconsciousness-raising is very important, not only as a means to\novercoming hermeneutical injustice, but it “can itself\nconstitute the overcoming of hermeneutical injustice” (2016:\n13). He focuses on the case of black South Africans during apartheid,\nand he argues, drawing on the work of Black Consciousness theorists\nsuch as B.S. Biko and N.B. Pityana, that they were liable to\nexperience a mismatch between their experiences of racism and\noppression, and the collective hermeneutical resources available to\nthem. Because of this, consciousness-raising can help to correct false\nor distorted conceptions and images of themselves, and to develop new\nconceptual tools in order to make sense of those aspects of their\nlives. Furthermore, Charlie Crerar (2016) has argued that the\ninjustice associated with lack of hermeneutical resources does not\noccur only in cases of conceptual absence (i.e. conceptual lacunas) or\nconceptual inadequacy (i.e. lack of concepts with the appropriate\nconnotations), but also in cases where there is a rich conceptual\nrepertoire but taboos or other social practices prevent marginalized\nsubjects from discussing some matters of interest to them. Therefore,\nhe argues, “we require access to an expressively free\nenvironment in which to put these concepts to work: an open and\nreceptive social context in which a particular experience that\nindividuals or groups have a significant interest in coming to\nunderstand can be discussed in hermeneutically conducive ways”\n(2016: 205). \nGeneric statements are ones such as “cats are furry”, or\n“a cat has fur”, which are neither universal\ngeneralizations (there are furless cats) nor existential\ngeneralization (the claim being made is clearly stronger). They give\nrise to many puzzles, which have for some time interested both\nlinguists and philosophers. For a fuller discussion of generics, see\n the entry on generics.\n Our focus here is the social and political import that has recently\nbeen suggested for generic statements about social groups, on which\nthere is a growing literature. This literature takes as its starting\npoint Sarah-Jane Leslie’s work (Leslie 2015; Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes 2015). Of key interest here are examples such as “boys\ndon’t cry” or “women place their families before\ntheir careers”. These sentences can be used to express merely\ndescriptive claims—describing, for example, crying as something\nnot that many boys do. But they can also be used to make normative\nclaims about what boys or women should do. Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes (2015) suggest that “we can understand the difference\nbetween normative and descriptive generics in terms of the different\nconcepts picked out by the noun phrase in the generics\nthemselves” (Wodak et. al. 2015: 629). ‘Woman’ may\npick out a normative concept—an ideal, which might include such\nthings as a focus on family over career; or, alternatively, it may\npick out a descriptive concept, and refer to women regardless of\nwhether they focus on family over career. Leslie uses this as a\nfoundation for explaining utterances like “Hillary Clinton is\nthe only man in the Obama White House”, suggesting that\n‘man’ here refers to the ideal of manliness. It is also a\npart of a more general project of arguing that generic utterances have\nharmful effects on social cognition. Leslie (forthcoming) also\ndiscusses what she calls “striking property generics”,\nstatements that attribute dangerous properties to groups generically\nspecified—like “black people are dangerous” or\n“Muslims are terrorists”. She argues that striking\nproperty generic claims may not require many instances to be accepted\nas true (assuming some other conditions are also met) allowing them to\nserve as a key mechanism in perpetuating and exacerbating prejudice.\n(For some criticisms of Leslie on striking property generics, see Saul\nforthcoming and Sterken 2015a,b.) \nHaslanger (2011) has built on Leslie’s work, arguing that\ngeneric claims often carry conversational implicatures about natures,\nand that these help them to serve as a key mechanism for perpetuating\nthe ideologies that hold unjust social structures in place. She\nsuggests that—whatever their truth conditions (one understanding\nof Leslie’s view would make striking property generic claims\nvery easily true)—one should deny them via the mechanism of\nmeta-linguistic negation (Horn 1985) which allows the denial of a\nclaim because it carries a false implicature. By this method, we can\nstart to disrupt the ideologies that have us in their grip. (For\ncriticism of this, see Saul forthcoming).","contact.mail":"esadiazleon@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
