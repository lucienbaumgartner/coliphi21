He ignored or opposed systematic\nphilosophy, had little faith in rationalism, asserted rather than\nargued many of his main ideas, presented others in metaphors, was\npreoccupied with immediate and personal experience, and brooded over\nsuch questions as the meaning of life in the face of death. Although\nhe forcefully separated himself from existentialism, Camus posed one\nof the twentieth century’s best-known existentialist questions, which\nlaunches The Myth of Sisyphus: “There is only one\nreally serious philosophical question, and that is suicide”\n(MS, 3). And his philosophy of the absurd has left us with a\nstriking image of the human fate: Sisyphus endlessly pushing his rock\nup the mountain only to see it roll back down each time he gains the\ntop. Camus’s philosophy found political expression in\nThe Rebel, which along with his newspaper editorials, \npolitical essays, plays, and fiction earned him a reputation as a \ngreat moralist. It also embroiled him in conflict with his friend,\nJean-Paul Sartre, provoking the major political-intellectual divide of\nthe Cold-War era as Camus and Sartre became, respectively, the leading\nintellectual voices of the anti-Communist and pro-Communist left.\nFurthermore, in posing and answering urgent philosophical questions of\nthe day, Camus articulated a critique of religion and of the\nEnlightenment and all its projects, including Marxism. In 1957 he won \nthe Nobel Prize for literature. He died in a car accident in January, \n1960, at the age of 46.\n\n\n\nThere are various paradoxical elements in Camus’s approach to\nphilosophy. In his book-length essay, The Myth of Sisyphus,\nCamus presents a philosophy that contests philosophy itself. This\nessay belongs squarely in the philosophical tradition of\nexistentialism but Camus denied being an existentialist. Both The\nMyth of Sisyphus and his other philosophical work, The\nRebel, are systematically skeptical of conclusions about the\nmeaning of life, yet both works assert objectively valid answers to\nkey questions about how to live. Though Camus seemed modest when\ndescribing his intellectual ambitions, he was confident enough as a\nphilosopher to articulate not only his own philosophy but also a\ncritique of religion and a fundamental critique of modernity. While\nrejecting the very idea of a philosophical system, Camus constructed\nhis own original edifice of ideas around the key terms of absurdity\nand rebellion, aiming to resolve the life-or-death issues that\nmotivated him. \n\nThe essential paradox arising in Camus’s philosophy concerns\nhis central notion of absurdity. Accepting the Aristotelian idea\nthat philosophy begins in wonder, Camus argues that human beings \ncannot escape asking the question, “What is the meaning of\nexistence?” Camus, however, denies that there is an answer to\nthis question, and rejects every scientific, teleological,\nmetaphysical, or human-created end that would provide an adequate\nanswer. Thus, while accepting that human beings inevitably seek to \nunderstand life’s purpose, Camus takes the skeptical position that the \nnatural world, the universe, and the human enterprise remain silent \nabout any such purpose. Since existence itself has no meaning, we must \nlearn to bear an irresolvable emptiness. This paradoxical situation, \nthen, between our impulse to ask ultimate questions and the \nimpossibility of achieving any adequate answer, is what Camus calls \nthe absurd. Camus’s philosophy of the absurd explores the \nconsequences arising from this basic paradox. \n\nCamus’s understanding of absurdity is best captured in an image, not \nan argument: of Sisyphus straining to push his rock up the mountain, \nwatching it roll down, then descending after the rock to begin all \nover, in an endless cycle. Like Sisyphus, humans cannot help but \ncontinue to ask after the meaning of life, only to see our answers\ntumble back down. If we accept this thesis about life’s essential\nabsurdity, and Camus’s anti-philosophical approach to philosophical \nquestions, we cannot help but ask: What role is left for rational \nanalysis and argument? Doesn’t Camus the philosopher preside over the \ndeath of philosophy in answering the question whether to commit \nsuicide by abandoning the terrain of argument and analysis and turning \nto metaphor to answer it? If life has no fundamental purpose or \nmeaning that reason can articulate, we cannot help asking about why we \ncontinue to live and to reason. Might not Silenus be right in \ndeclaring that it would have been better not to have been born, or to \ndie as soon as\n possible?[1]\n And, as Francis Jeanson wrote long before his famous criticism of \nThe Rebel that precipitated the rupture between Camus and \nSartre, isn’t absurdist philosophy a contradiction in terms, strictly \nspeaking no philosophy at all but an anti-rational posture that ends \nin silence (Jeanson 1947)? \n\nWas Camus actually a philosopher? He himself said no, in a famous\ninterview with Jeanine Delpech in Les Nouvelles\nLittéraires in November of 1945, insisting that he did\n“not believe sufficiently in reason to believe in a\nsystem” (Camus 1965, 1427). This was not merely a public\nposture, since we find the same thought in his notebooks of this\nperiod: he describes himself as an artist and not a philosopher\nbecause “I think according to words and not according to\nideas” (Camus 1995, 113). Still, Jean-Paul Sartre saw\nimmediately that Camus was undertaking important philosophical work,\nand in his review of The Stranger in relation\nto Sisyphus, had no trouble connecting Camus with Pascal,\nRousseau, and Nietzsche (Sartre 1962). After they became friends\nSartre spoke publicly of his friend’s “philosophy of the\nabsurd,” which he distinguished from his own thought for which\nhe accepted the “existentialist” label that Camus\nrejected. In the years since, the apparent unsystematic, indeed,\nanti-systematic, character of his philosophy, has meant that\nrelatively few scholars have appreciated its full depth and\ncomplexity. They have more often praised his towering literary\nachievements and standing as a political moralist while pointing out\nhis dubious claims and problematic arguments (see Sherman 2008). A\nsignificant recent exception to this is Ronald Srigley’s Albert\nCamus’ Critique of Modernity (Srigley 2011). \n\nThis entry will negotiate Camus’s deliberate ambivalence as a \nphilosopher while discussing his philosophy. It is not just a\nmatter of giving a philosophical reading of this playwright,\njournalist, essayist, and novelist but of taking his philosophical\nwritings seriously—exploring their premises, their evolution,\ntheir structure, and their coherence. To do so is to see that his\nwriting contains more than a mood and more than images and sweeping,\nunsupported assertions, although it contains many of both. Camus\ntakes his skepticism as far as possible as a form of methodical \ndoubt—that is, he begins from a presumption of \nskepticism—until he finds the basis for a non-skeptical \nconclusion. And he builds a unique philosophical construction, whose \npremises are often left unstated and which is not always argued \nclearly, but which develops in distinct stages over the course of his \nbrief lifetime. Camus’s philosophy can be thus read as a sustained \neffort to demonstrate and not just assert what is entailed by the \nabsurdity of human existence. In the process Camus answers the \nquestions posed by The Myth of Sisyphus, “Why should I \nnot kill myself?”, and by The Rebel, “Why should \nI not kill others?” \n\nCamus’s graduate thesis at the University of Algiers sympathetically \nexplored the relationship between Greek philosophy and Christianity,\nspecifically the relationship of Plotinus to Augustine (Camus 1992). Nevertheless,\nhis philosophy explicitly rejects religion as one of its foundations. \nNot always taking an openly hostile posture towards religious \nbelief—though he certainly does in the novels The \nStranger and The Plague—Camus centers his work on\nchoosing to live without God. Another way to understand Camus’s \nphilosophy is that it is an effort to explore the issues and pitfalls \nof a post-religious world. \n\nCamus’s earliest published writing containing philosophical thinking, \nNuptials, appeared in Algeria in 1938, and remain the basis \nof his later work. These lyrical essays and sketches describe a \nconsciousness reveling in the world, a body delighting in nature, and \nthe individual’s immersion in sheer physicality. Yet these experiences \nare presented as the solution to a philosophical problem, namely \nfinding the meaning of life in the face of death. They appear \nalongside, and reveal themselves to be rooted in, his first extended \nmeditation on ultimate questions. \n\nIn these essays, Camus sets two attitudes in opposition. The first\nis what he regards as religion-based fears. He cites religious\nwarnings about pride, concern for one’s immortal soul, hope for\nan afterlife, resignation about the present and preoccupation with \nGod. Against this conventional Christian perspective Camus asserts \nwhat he regards as self-evident facts: that we must die and there is \nnothing beyond this life. Without mentioning it, Camus draws a \nconclusion from these facts, namely that the soul is not immortal. \nHere, as elsewhere in his philosophical writing, he commends to his \nreaders to face a discomforting reality squarely and without \nflinching, but he does not feel compelled to present reasons or \nevidence. If not with religion, where then does wisdom lie? His answer \nis: with the “conscious certainty of a death without hope” \nand in refusing to hide from the fact that we are going to die. For\nCamus “there is no superhuman happiness, no eternity outside of\nthe curve of the days…. I can see no point in the happiness of\nangels” (N, 90). There is nothing but this\nworld, this life, the immediacy of the present. \n\nCamus is sometimes mistakenly called a “pagan” because he \nrejects Christianity as based on a hope for a life beyond this life. \nHope is the error Camus wishes to avoid. Rejecting “the \ndelusions of hope” (N, 74), Nuptials contains \nan evocation of an alternative. Camus relies for this line of thought \non Nietzsche’s discussion of Pandora’s Box in Human, All Too \nHuman: all the evils of humankind, including plagues and disease, \nhave been let loose on the world by Zeus, but the remaining evil, \nhope, is kept hidden away in the box and treasured. But why, we may \nask, is hope an evil? Nietzsche explains that humans have come to see \nhope as their greatest good, while Zeus, knowing better, has meant it \nas the greatest source of trouble. It is, after all, the reason why \nhumans let themselves be tormented—because they anticipate an \nultimate reward (Nietzsche 1878/1996, 58). For Camus, following this \nreading of Nietzsche closely, the conventional solution is in fact the \nproblem: hope is disastrous for humans inasmuch as it leads them to \nminimize the value of this life except as preparation for a life \nbeyond. \n\nIf religious hope is based on the mistaken belief that death, in the \nsense of utter and total extinction body and soul, is not inevitable, \nit leads us down a blind alley. Worse, because it teaches us to look \naway from life toward something to come afterwards, such religious \nhope kills a part of us, for example, the realistic attitude we need \nto confront the vicissitudes of life. But what then is the appropriate\npath? The young Camus is neither a skeptic nor a relativist here. His \ndiscussion rests on the self-evidence of sensuous experience. He \nadvocates precisely what he takes Christianity to abjure: living a \nlife of the senses, intensely, here and now, in the present. This \nentails, first, abandoning all hope for an afterlife, indeed rejecting \nthinking about it. “I do not want to believe that death is \nthe gateway to another life. For me it is a closed door” \n(N, 76). \n\nWe might think that facing our total annihilation would be bitter,\nbut for Camus this leads us in a positive direction: “Between\nthis sky and the faces turned toward it there is nothing on which to\nhang a mythology, a literature, an ethic, or a religion—only\nstones, flesh, stars, and those truths the hand can touch”\n(N, 90). This insight entails obstinately refusing\n“all the ‘later on’s of this world,” in\norder to lay claim to “my present wealth” (N,\n103), namely the intense here-and-now life of the senses. The\n“wealth” is precisely what hope cheats us out of by\nteaching us to look away from it and towards an afterlife. Only by \nyielding to the fact that our “longing to endure” will be \nfrustrated and accepting our “awareness of death” are we \nable to open ourselves to the riches of life, which are physical above \nall. \n\nCamus puts both sides of his argument into a single statement:\n“The world is beautiful, and outside there is no\nsalvation” (N, 103). Only in accepting death and in\nbeing “stripped of all hope” does one most intensely\nappreciate not only the physical side of life, but also, he now\nsuggests, its affective and interpersonal side. Taken together, and\ncontrary to an unverifiable faith in God and afterlife, these are what\none has and one knows: “To feel one’s\nties to a land, one’s love for certain men, to know there is\nalways a place where the heart can find rest—these are already\nmany certainties for one man’s life” (N, 90). \n\nOnly if we accept that Nietzsche is right, that God is dead and\nthere is only nothingness after we die, will we then fully\nexperience—feel, taste, touch, see, and smell—the joys of\nour bodies and the physical world. Thus the sensuous and lyrical\nside of these essays, their evocative character, is central to the\nargument. Or rather, because Camus is promoting intense, joyous,\nphysical experience as opposed to a self-abnegating religious life,\nrather than developing an argument he asserts that these experiences\nare the right response. His writing aims to demonstrate what life\nmeans and feels like once we give up hope of an\nafterlife, so that in reading we will be led to “see” his\npoint. These essays may be taken as containing highly personal\nthoughts, a young man’s musings about his Mediterranean\nenvironment, and they scarcely seem to have any system. But they\nsuggest what philosophy is for Camus and how he conceives its\nrelationship to literary expression. \n\nHis early philosophy, then, may be conveyed, if not summed up, in\nthis passage from “Nuptials at Tipasa”: \n\nThe intense and glistening present tells us that we can fully\nexperience and appreciate life only on the condition that we no longer\ntry to avoid our ultimate and absolute death. \n\nAfter completing Nuptials, Camus began to work on a planned\ntriptych on the Absurd: a novel, which became The Stranger, a\nphilosophical essay, eventually titled The Myth of Sisyphus,\nand a play, Caligula. These were completed and sent off from\nAlgeria to the Paris publisher in September 1941. Although Camus would\nhave preferred to see them appear together, even in a single volume,\nthe publisher for both commercial reasons and because of the paper\nshortage caused by war and occupation, released The Stranger\nin June 1942 and The Myth of Sisyphus in October. Camus kept\nworking on the play, which finally appeared in book form two years\nlater (Lottman, 264–67).  \n\n“There is only one really serious philosophical\nproblem,” Camus says, “and that is suicide. Deciding\nwhether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental\nquestion in philosophy. All other questions follow from that”\n(MS, 3). One might object that suicide is neither a\n“problem” nor a “question,” but an act. A\nproper, philosophical question might rather be: “Under what\nconditions is suicide warranted?” And a philosophical answer\nmight explore the question, “What does it mean to ask whether\nlife is worth living?” as William James did in The Will to\nBelieve. For the Camus of The Myth of Sisyphus,\nhowever, “Should I kill myself?” is the essential\nphilosophical question. For him, it seems clear that the primary\nresult of philosophy is action, not comprehension. His concern about\n“the most urgent of questions” is less a theoretical one\nthan it is the life-and-death problem of whether and how to\nlive. \n\nCamus sees this question of suicide as a natural response to\nan underlying premise, namely that life is absurd in a variety of\nways. As we have seen, both the presence and absence of life\n(i.e., death) give rise to the condition: it is absurd to continually\nseek meaning in life when there is none, and it is absurd to hope for\nsome form of continued existence after death given that the latter\nresults in our extinction. But Camus also thinks it absurd to try\nto know, understand, or explain the world, for he sees the attempt to\ngain rational knowledge as futile. Here Camus pits himself\nagainst science and philosophy, dismissing the claims of all forms of\nrational analysis: “That universal reason, practical or ethical,\nthat determinism, those categories that explain everything are enough\nto make a decent man laugh” (MS, 21). \n\nThese kinds of absurdity are driving Camus’s question about\nsuicide, but his way of proceeding evokes another kind of absurdity,\none less well-defined, namely, the “absurd sensibility”\n(MS, 2, tr. changed). This sensibility, vaguely described, seems\nto be “an intellectual malady” (MS, 2) rather \nthan a philosophy. He regards thinking about it as\n“provisional” and insists that the mood of absurdity, so\n“widespread in our age” does not arise from, but lies \nprior to, philosophy. Camus’s diagnosis of the essential human problem\nrests on a series of “truisms” (MS, 18) and\n“obvious themes” (MS, 16). But he\ndoesn’t argue for life’s absurdity or attempt to\nexplain it—he is not interested in either\nproject, nor would such projects engage his strength as a\nthinker. “I am interested … not so much in absurd\ndiscoveries as in their consequences” (MS, 16).\nAccepting absurdity as the mood of the times, he asks above all \nwhether and how to live in the face of it. “Does the absurd \ndictate death” (MS, 9)? But he does not argue this\nquestion either, and rather chooses to demonstrate the attitude \ntowards life that would deter suicide. In other words, the main \nconcern of the book is to sketch ways of living our lives so as \nto make them worth living despite their being meaningless. \n\nAccording to Camus, people commit suicide “because they judge\nlife is not worth living” (MS, 4). But if this\ntemptation precedes what is usually considered philosophical\nreasoning, how to answer it? In order to get to the bottom of things\nwhile avoiding arguing for the truth of his statements, he\ndepicts, enumerates, and illustrates. As he says in The\nRebel, “the absurd is an experience that must be lived\nthrough, a point of departure, the equivalent, in existence, of\nDescartes’s methodical doubt” (R, 4). The Myth of\nSisyphus seeks to describe “the elusive feeling of\nabsurdity” in our lives, rapidly pointing out themes that\n“run through all literatures and all philosophies”\n(MS, 12). Appealing to common experience, he tries to render\nthe flavor of the absurd with images, metaphors, and anecdotes that\ncapture the experiential level he regards as lying prior to\nphilosophy. \n\nHe begins doing so with an implicit reference to Sartre’s novel, \nNausea, which echoes the protagonist Antoine Roquentin’s \ndiscovery of absurdity. Camus had earlier written that this novel’s\ntheories of absurdity and its images are not in balance. The\ndescriptive and the philosophical aspects of the novel\n“don’t add up to a work of art: the passage from one to the\nother is too rapid, too unmotivated, to evoke in the reader the deep\nconviction that makes art of the novel” (Camus 1968, 200). But \nin this 1938 review Camus praises Sartre’s descriptions of\nabsurdity, the sense of anguish and nausea that arises as the ordinary\nstructures imposed on existence collapse in Antoine Roquentin’s\nlife. As Camus now presents his own version of the experience,\n“the stage sets collapse. Rising, streetcar, four hours in\nthe office or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal,\nsleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and \nSunday according to the same rhythm …” (MS, \n12–3). As this continues, one slowly becomes fully conscious and\nsenses the absurd. \n\nCamus goes on to sketch other experiences of absurdity, until he\narrives at death. But although Camus seeks to\navoid arguing for the truth of his claims, he nevertheless concludes\nthis “absurd reasoning” with a series of categorical\nassertions addressed to “the intelligence” about the\ninevitable frustration of the human desire to know the world and to be\nat home in it. Despite his intentions, Camus cannot avoid\nasserting what he believes to be an objective truth: “We must\ndespair of ever reconstructing the familiar, calm surface which would\ngive us peace of heart” (MS, 18). Turning to experiences\nthat are seemingly obvious to large numbers of people who share the\nabsurd sensibility, he declares sweepingly: “This world in \nitself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said” \n(MS, 21). Our efforts to know are driven by a nostalgia for \nunity, and there is an inescapable “hiatus between what we fancy\nwe know and what we really know” (MS, 18). \n\n“With the exception of professional rationalists, people today \ndespair of true knowledge” (MS, 18). Camus asserts that \nthe history of human thought is characterized by “its successive\nregrets and its impotences” (MS, 18), and that \n“the impossibility of knowledge is established” \n(MS, 25). When writing more carefully, he claims only to be \ndescribing a certain “climate,” but in any case his  \nbedrock assumptions appear again and again: the world is unknowable \nand life is without meaning. Our efforts to understand them lead \nnowhere. \n\nAvi Sagi suggests that in claiming this Camus is not speaking as an \nirrationalist—which is, after all, how he regards the\nexistentialists—but as someone trying to rationally understand\nthe limits of reason (Sagi 2002, 59–65). For Camus the problem \nis that by demanding meaning, order, and unity, we seek to go beyond \nthose limits and pursue the impossible. We will never understand, and we will\ndie despite all our efforts. There are two obvious responses to\nour frustrations: suicide and hope. By hope Camus means just what\nhe described in Nuptials, the religion-inspired effort to\nimagine and live for a life beyond this life. Or, second, as taken up\nat length in The Rebel, bending one’s energies to living\nfor a great cause beyond oneself: “Hope of another life one must\n‘deserve’ or trickery of those who live not for life itself\nbut for some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a\nmeaning, and betray it” (MS, 8). \nWhat is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The\nanswer is to live without escape and with integrity, in\n“revolt” and defiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic \nto human life. Since “the most obvious absurdity”\n(MS, 59) is death, Camus urges us to “die unreconciled\nand not of one’s own free will” (MS, 55). In\nshort, he recommends a life without consolation, but instead one\ncharacterized by lucidity and by acute consciousness of and rebellion \nagainst its mortality and its limits. \n\nIn his statement of the problem and its solution, Camus’s\ntone, ideas, and style are reminiscent of Nietzsche. “God\nis dead” is of course their common starting point, as is the\ndetermination to confront unpleasant truths and write against received\nwisdom. At the same time Camus argues against the specific\nphilosophical current with which Nietzsche is often linked as a\nprecursor, and to which he himself is closest—existentialism.\nThe Myth of Sisyphus is explicitly written against\nexistentialists such as Shestov, Kierkegaard, Jaspers, and Heidegger,\nas well as against the phenomenology of Husserl. Camus shares\ntheir starting point, which he regards as the fact that they all\nsomehow testify to the absurdity of the human condition. But he rejects\nwhat he sees as their ultimate escapism and irrationality, claiming\nthat “they deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in\nwhat impoverishes them. That forced hope is religious in all of\nthem” (MS, 24). \nSartre, too, is subject to Camus’s criticisms—and not\njust politically as will be described in the following section.\nAlthough some of the ideas in The Myth of Sisyphus drew on\nSartre’s Nausea (as noted above), in 1942 Sartre was not\nyet regarded as an “existentialist”. But as Sartre’s\nphilosophy developed, he went on to explore how human activity\nconstitutes a meaningful world from the brute, meaningless existence\nunveiled in his\n novel[2]\n(Aronson 1980, 71–88). In the process, the absurdity of Nausea\nbecomes the contingency of Being and Nothingness, the fact\nthat humans and things are simply there with no explanation or\nreason. As Sartre described it, the absurd is “the\nuniversal contingency of being which is, but which is not the basis of\nits being; the absurd is the given, the unjustifiable, primordial\nquality of existence” (quoted in Sagi 2002, 57). Having rooted\nhuman existence in such contingency, Sartre goes on to describe other\nfundamental structures of existence, core human projects, and\ncharacteristic patterns of behavior, including freedom and bad faith,\nall of which arise on this basis. The original contingency leads\nto our desire to undo it, to the futile project to “found\nbeing,” in other words the “useless passion” of the\nproject to become God. \nFor Sartre absurdity is obviously a fundamental ontological property\nof existence itself, frustrating us but not restricting our\nunderstanding. For Camus, on the other hand, absurdity is not a\nproperty of existence as such, but is an essential feature of our\nrelationship with the world. It might be argued that\nSartre and Camus are really quite similar, and that the core futility\nof Sartre’s philosophy parallels the “despair” Camus\ndescribes. After all, if Sisyphus’s labor is ultimately\nfutile, so is the project to become God. But Sartre rejects the\n“classical pessimism” and “disillusionment” he\nfinds in Camus and instead possesses an unCamusean confidence in his\nability to understand and explain this project and the rest of the\nhuman world. Camus, on the contrary, builds an entire worldview on his\ncentral assumption that absurdity is an unsurpassable relationship\nbetween humans and their world (Aronson 2013). He postulates an inevitable\ndivorce between human consciousness, with its “wild longing for\nclarity” (MS, 21) and the “unreasonable silence of\nthe world” (MS, 28). As discussed above,\nCamus views the world as irrational, which means that it is not\nunderstandable through reason. \n\nAccording to Camus, each existentialist writer betrayed his initial\ninsight by seeking to appeal to something beyond the limits of the\nhuman condition, by turning to the transcendent. And yet even if we\navoid what Camus describes as such escapist efforts and continue to\nlive without irrational appeals, the desire to do so is built into our\nconsciousness and thus our humanity. We are unable to free ourselves\nfrom “this desire for unity, this longing to solve, this need\nfor clarity and cohesion” (MS, 51). But it is urgent to\nnot succumb to these impulses and to instead accept absurdity. In\ncontrast with existentialism, “The absurd is lucid reason noting\nits limits” (MS, 49). \nCamus clearly believes that the existentialist philosophers are\nmistaken but does not argue against them, because he believes that\n“there is no truth but merely truths” (MS,\n43). His disagreement rather takes the subtler and less assertive form\nof an immanent critique, pointing out that each thinker’s\nexistentialist philosophy ends up being inconsistent with its own\nstarting point: “starting from a philosophy of the world’s lack\nof meaning, it ends up by finding a meaning and depth in it”\n(MS, 42). These philosophers, he insists, refuse to accept\nthe conclusions that follow from their own premises.  Kierkegaard, for\nexample, strongly senses the absurd. But rather than respecting it as\nthe inevitable human ailment, he seeks to be cured of it by making it\nan attribute of a God who he then embraces. \nCamus’s most sustained analysis is of Husserl’s\nphenomenology. Along with Sartre, Camus praises the early\nHusserlian notion of intentionality. Sartre saw this notion as\nrevealing a dynamic consciousness without contents—the basis for\nhis conception of freedom—while Camus is pleased that\nintentionality follows the absurd spirit in its “apparent modesty\nof thought that limits itself to describing what it declines to\nexplain” (MS, 43). However, Camus criticizes\nHusserl’s later search in Ideas for Platonic\nextra-temporal essences as a quasi-religious leap inconsistent with his\noriginal insight. \n\nHow then to remain consistent with absurd reasoning and avoid\nfalling victim to the “spirit of nostalgia”? The\nMyth of Sisyphus finds the answer by abandoning the terrain of\nphilosophy altogether. Camus describes a number of absurdist fictional\ncharacters and activities, including Don Juan and Dostoevsky’s\nKirolov (The Possessed), theater, and literary creation.\nAnd then he concludes with the story of Sisyphus, who fully incarnates\na sense of life’s absurdity, its “futility and hopeless\nlabor” (MS, 119). Camus sees Sisyphus’s\nendless effort and intense consciousness of futility as a\ntriumph. “His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death,\nand his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the\nwhole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing”\n(MS, 120). After the dense and highly self-conscious\nearlier chapters, these pages condense the entire line of thought into\na vivid image. Sisyphus demonstrates that we can live with\n“the certainty of a crushing fate, without the resignation that\nought to accompany it” (MS, 54). For Camus,\nSisyphus reminds us that we cannot help seeking to understand the\nreality that transcends our intelligence, striving to grasp more than\nour limited and practical scientific understanding allows, and wishing\nto live without dying. Like Sisyphus, we are our fate, and our\nfrustration is our very life: we can never escape it. \nBut there is more. After the rock comes tumbling down,\nconfirming the ultimate futility of his project, Sisyphus trudges after\nit once again. This “is the hour of consciousness. At each\nof those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks towards\nthe lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger\nthan his rock” (MS, 121). Why use the words\n“superior” and “stronger” when he has no hope\nof succeeding the next time? Paradoxically, it is because a sense\nof tragedy “crowns his victory.” “Sisyphus,\nproletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole\nextent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his\ndescent” (MS, 121). Tragic consciousness is the\nconclusion of “absurd reasoning”: living fully aware of the\nbitterness of our being and consciously facing our fate. \n What then is\nCamus’s reply to his question about whether or not to commit\nsuicide? Full consciousness, avoiding false solutions such as\nreligion, refusing to submit, and carrying on with vitality and\nintensity: these are Camus’s answers. This is how a life without\nultimate meaning can be made worth living. As he said in\nNuptials, life’s pleasures are inseparable from a keen\nawareness of these limits. Sisyphus accepts and embraces living\nwith death without the possibility of appealing to God. “All\nSisyphus’s silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to\nhim. His rock is his thing” (MS, 123). \n\nLucidly living the human condition, Sisyphus “knows himself to\nbe the master of his days.” By becoming conscious of it,\nCamus is saying, he takes ownership of it. In this sense Sisyphus\nreshapes his fate into a condition of “wholly human\norigin.” “Wholly” may be an exaggeration,\nbecause after all, death is “inevitable and despicable,”\nbut by acknowledging this, Sisyphus consciously lives out what has been\nimposed on him, thus making it into his own end. In the same way,\nMeursault, protagonist of The Stranger, comes to consciousness\nin that book’s second part after committing the inexplicable\nmurder that ends the book’s first part. He has lived his\nexistence from one moment to the next and without much awareness, but\nat his trial and while awaiting execution he becomes like Sisyphus,\nfully conscious of himself and his terrible fate. He will die\ntriumphant as the absurd man. \n The Myth of\nSisyphus is far from having a skeptical conclusion. In response to\nthe lure of suicide, Camus counsels an intensely conscious and active\nnon-resolution. Rejecting any hope of resolving the strain is\nalso to reject despair. Indeed, it is possible, within and\nagainst these limits, to speak of happiness. “Happiness and\nthe absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable”\n(MS, 122). It is not that discovering the\nabsurd leads necessarily to happiness, but rather that acknowledging\nthe absurd means also accepting human frailty, an awareness of our\nlimitations, and the fact that we cannot help wishing to go beyond what\nis possible. These are all tokens of being fully alive.\n“The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a\nman’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”\n(MS, 123). \n\nWe can compare his\nconclusion with Pyrrho’s skepticism and Descartes’s\nmethodical doubt. First of all, like Pyrrho, Camus has solved his\npressing existential issue, namely, avoiding despair, by a kind of\nresolution entailed in accepting our mortality and ultimate\nignorance. But there are two critical differences with Pyrrho:\nfor Camus we never can abandon the desire to know, and realizing this\nleads to a quickening of our life-impulses. This last point was already\ncontained in Nuptials, but here is expanded to link\nconsciousness with happiness. For Camus, happiness includes\nliving intensely and sensuously in the present coupled with\nSisyphus’s tragic, lucid, and defiant consciousness, his sense of\nlimits, his bitterness, his determination to keep on, and his refusal\nof any form of consolation. \n\nObviously, Camus’s sense of happiness is not a conventional\none but Sagi argues it may place him closer to Aristotle than to any\nother thinker insofar as he is championing the full realization of\nhuman capacities (Sagi 2002, 79–80) Camus is also similar in this\nto Nietzsche, who called upon his readers to “say yes to\nlife,” and live as completely as possible at every moment.\nNietzsche’s point was that to be wholly alive means being as\naware of the negative as of the positive, feeling pain, not shunning\nany experience, and embracing life “even in its strangest and\nhardest problems” (Nietzsche 1888/1954, 562). But how is it\npossible that, by the end of The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus has\nmoved from skepticism (about finding the truth) and nihilism (about\nwhether life has meaning) to advocating an approach to\nlife that is clearly judged to be better than others? How does he\njustify embracing a normative stance, affirming specific values?\nThis contradiction reveals a certain sleight of hand, as the\nphilosopher gives way to the artist. It is as an artist that\nCamus now makes his case for acceptance of tragedy, the consciousness\nof absurdity, and a life of sensuous vitality. He advocates this\nwith the image of Sisyphus straining, fully alive, and happy. \nThis meditation on absurdity and suicide follows closely on the\npublication of Camus’s first novel, The Stranger, which\nalso centered on individual experience and revolves around its\nprotagonist’s senseless murder of an Arab on a beach in Algiers and\nconcludes with his execution by guillotine. And it is often forgotten\nthat this absurdist novelist and philosopher was also a political\nactivist—he had been a member of the Algerian branch of the\nFrench Communist Party in the mid-1930s and was organizer of an\nAlgiers theater company that performed avant-garde and political\nplays—as well as a crusading journalist. From October 1938 until\nJanuary 1940 he worked on Alger républicain and a sister\nnewspaper. In June 1939 he wrote a series of reports on famine and\npoverty in the mountainous coastal region of Kabylie, among the first\ndetailed articles ever written by a European Algerian describing the\nwretched living conditions of the native population. \n\nAfter the start of World War II, Camus became editor of Le Soir\nrépublicain and opposed French entry into the war. The\nspectacle of Camus and his mentor Pascal Pia running their left-wing\ndaily into the ground because they rejected the urgency of fighting\nNazism is one of the most striking but least commented-on periods of\nhis life. Misunderstanding Nazism at the beginning of the war, he\nadvocated negotiations with Hitler that would in part reverse the\nhumiliations of the Treaty of Versailles. His pacifism was in keeping\nwith a time-honored French tradition, and Camus reported for military\nservice out of solidarity with those young men, like his brother, who\nhad become soldiers. Intending to serve loyally and to advocate a\nnegotiated peace in the barracks, he was angered that his tuberculosis\ndisqualified him (Lottman, 201–31; Aronson 2004,\n25–28). \n\nThese biographical facts are relevant to Camus’s philosophical\ndevelopment after The Myth of Sisyphus. Moving to France and\nbecoming engaged in the resistance to the German occupation, in two\n“Letters to a German Friend” published clandestinely in\n1943 and 1944, Camus pondered the question whether violence against\nthe occupiers was justified. He spoke of the “loathing we\n[French] had for all war,” and the need “to find out if we\nhad the right to kill men, if we were allowed to add to the frightful\nmisery of this world” (RRD, 8). Despising war, suspicious\nof heroism, he claimed that the occupied French paid dearly for this\ndetour “with prison sentences and executions at dawn, with\ndesertions and separations, with daily pangs of hunger, with emaciated\nchildren, and above all, with humiliation of our human dignity”\n(RRD, 8). Only when we were “at death’s door,” and\n“far behind” the Germans, did we understand the reasons\nfor fighting, so that henceforth we would struggle with a clear\nconscience and “clean hands.” Our moral strength was\nrooted in the fact that we were fighting for justice and national\nsurvival. The subsequent letters continued to contrast the French with\nthe Germans on moral grounds drawn directly from Camus’s\nphilosophy, and suggested the transition from The Myth of\nSisyphus to The Rebel: if both adversaries began with a\nsense of the world’s absurdity, Camus claimed that the French\nacknowledged and lived within this awareness, while the Germans sought\nto overcome it by dominating the world. \nCamus’s anti-Nazi commitment and newspaper experience led to him\nsucceeding Pia in March 1944 as editor of Combat, the main\nunderground newspaper of the non-Communist left.  However, after the\nLiberation the question of violence continued to occupy him both\npolitically and philosophically. His allegory of the war years, The\nPlague, depicts a nonviolent resistance to an unexplained\npestilence, and in 1945 his was one of the few voices raised in\nprotest against the American use of nuclear weapons to defeat Japan\n(Aronson 2004, 61-63). After the Liberation he opposed the death\npenalty for collaborators, turned against Marxism and Communism for\nembracing revolution, rejected the looming cold war and its\nthreatening violence, and then in The Rebel began to spell\nout his deeper understanding of violence.   \n\nAt the beginning of The Rebel, Camus picks up where he left\noff in The Myth of Sisyphus. Writing as a philosopher again, he\nreturns to the terrain of argument by explaining what absurdist\nreasoning entails. Its “final conclusion” is “the\nrepudiation of suicide and the acceptance of the desperate encounter\nbetween human inquiry and the silence of the universe”\n(R, 6). Since to conclude otherwise would negate its very\npremise, namely the existence of the questioner, absurdism must\nlogically accept life as the one necessary good. “To say that\nlife is absurd, consciousness must be alive” (R, 6,\ntr. changed). Living and eating “are themselves value\njudgments” (Camus 1968, 160).  “To breathe is to\njudge” (R, 8). As in his criticism of the\nexistentialists, Camus advocates a single standpoint from which to\nargue for objective validity, that of consistency.  \nAt first blush, however, the book’s subject seems to have more\nof a historical theme than a philosophical one. “The\npurpose of this essay is … to face the reality of the present,\nwhich is logical crime, and to examine meticulously the arguments by\nwhich it is justified; it is an attempt to understand the times in\nwhich we live. One might think that a period which, in a space of\nfifty years, uproots, enslaves, or kills seventy million human beings\nshould be condemned out of hand. But its culpability must still\nbe understood” (R, 3). \nDo such questions represent an entirely new philosophy or are they\ncontinuous with The Myth of Sisyphus?. The issue is not\nresolved by the explanations that Camus gives for his shift in the\nfirst pages of The Rebel—by referring to the mass\nmurders of the middle third of the twentieth century. “The age\nof negation,” he says, once fostered a concern for suicide, but\nnow in “the age of ideologies, we must examine our position in\nrelation to murder” (R, 4). Have the “ages”\nchanged in the less than ten years between the two books? He may be\nright to say that whether murder has rational foundations is\n“the question implicit in the blood and strife of this\ncentury,” but in changing his focus from suicide to murder, it\nis also clear that Camus is shifting his philosophical optic from the\nindividual to our social belonging. \nIn so doing Camus applies the philosophy of the absurd in new, social\ndirections, and seeks to answer new, historical questions. But as we\nsee him setting this up at the beginning of The Rebel the\ncontinuity with a philosophical reading of The Stranger is also\nstrikingly clear.  Novelist Kamel Daoud, retelling The Stranger\nfrom the point of view of the victim, correctly calls the murder of\nhis Arab “kinsman” a “philosophical crime”\n(Daoud, 19). At the beginning of The Rebel Camus explains: \nIf historically “murder is the problem today” (R,\n5), the encounter with absurdity tells us that the same is true\nphilosophically. Having ruled out suicide, what is there to say about\nmurder?  \n\nStarting from the absence of God, the key theme of Nuptials,\nand the inevitability of absurdity, the key theme of The Myth of\nSisyphus, Camus incorporates both of these into The\nRebel, but alongside them he now stresses revolt. The act of\nrebellion assumes the status of a primary datum of human experience,\nlike the Cartesian cogito taken by Sartre as his point of departure.\nCamus first expressed this directly under the inspiration of his\nencounter with Being and Nothingness.  But in calling it\n“revolt” he takes it in a direction sharply different than\nSartre, who built from the cogito an “essay in phenomenological\nontology.” Ignoring completely the ontological dimension, Camus\nis now concerned with immediate issues of human social\nexperience. Revolt, to be sure, still includes the rebellion against\nabsurdity that Camus described in The Myth of Sisyphus, and\nonce again he will speak of rebelling against our own mortality and\nthe universe’s meaninglessness and incoherence. But The Rebel\nbegins with the kind of revolt that rejects oppression and slavery,\nand protests against the world’s injustice. \n\nIt is at first, like The Myth of Sisyphus, a single\nindividual’s rebellion, but now Camus stresses that revolt\ncreates values, dignity, and solidarity. “I revolt,\ntherefore we are” (R, 22) is his paradoxical\nstatement. But how can an I lead to a we? How\ndoes “we are” follow from “I revolt”? How can\nthe individual’s experience of absurdity, and the rebellion\nagainst it, stem from, produce, imply, or entail the wider social sense\nof injustice and solidarity? The we in fact is the subject of\nThe Rebel, although the title L’Homme\nrevolté suggests that one’s original\nmotivation may be individual. Acting against oppression entails\nhaving recourse to social values, and at the same time joining with\nothers in struggle. On both levels solidarity is our common condition. \n\nIn The Rebel Camus takes the further step, which occupies\nmost of the book, of developing his notion of metaphysical and\nhistorical rebellion in opposition to the concept of revolution.\nApplying his philosophical themes directly to politics in the years\nimmediately after the Liberation of France in 1944, Camus had already\nconcluded that Marxists, and especially the Communists, were guilty of\nevading life’s absurdity by aiming at a wholesale transformation\nof society, which must necessarily be violent. And now, in\nThe Rebel, he describes this as a major trend of modern\nhistory, using similar terms to those he had used in The Myth of\nSisyphus to describe the religious and philosophical\nevasions. \n\nWhat sort of work is this? In a book so charged with political\nmeaning, Camus makes no explicitly political arguments or revelations,\nand presents little in the way of actual social analysis or concrete\nhistorical study. The Rebel is, rather, a historically framed\nphilosophical essay about underlying ideas and attitudes of\ncivilization. David Sprintzen suggests these taken-for-granted\nattitudes operate implicitly and in the background of human projects\nand very rarely become conscious (Sprintzen 1988, 123). \n\nCamus felt that it was urgent to critically examine these attitudes\nin a world in which calculated murder had become common. Applying his\nabsurdist ideas and insights to politics, in The Rebel Camus\nexplains what he regards as the modern world’s increasingly\norganized and catastrophic refusal to face, accept, and live with\nabsurdity. The book provides a unique perspective—presenting a\ncoherent and original structure of premise, mood, description,\nphilosophy, history, and even prejudice. \n\nCamus’s hostility to Communism had its personal, political, and\nphilosophical reasons. These certainly reached back to his expulsion\nfrom the Communist Party in the mid-1930s for refusing to adhere to\nits Popular Front strategy of playing down French colonialism in\nAlgeria in order to win support from the white working class. Then,\nmaking no mention of Marxism, The Myth of Sisyphus is\neloquently silent on its claims to present a coherent understanding of\nhuman history and a meaningful path to the future. His mutually\nrespectful relations with Communists during the Resistance and the\nimmediate postwar period turned bitter after he was attacked in the\nCommunist press and repaid the attack in a series of newspaper\narticles in 1946 entitled “Neither Victims nor\nExecutioners” (Aronson, 2004, 66-93). \nIn The Rebel Camus insisted that both Communism’s appeal and\nits negative features sprang from the same irrepressible human\nimpulse: faced with absurdity and injustice, humans refuse to accept\ntheir existence and instead seek to remake the world. Validating\nrevolt as a necessary starting point, Camus criticizes politics aimed\nat building a utopian future, affirming once more that life should be\nlived in the present and in the sensuous world. He explores the\nhistory of post-religious and nihilistic intellectual and literary\nmovements; he attacks political violence with his views on limits and\nsolidarity; and he ends by articulating the metaphysical role of art\nas well as a self-limiting radical politics. In place of striving to\ntransform the world, he speaks\nof mésure—“measure”, in the sense of\nproportion or balance—and of living in the tension of the human\ncondition. He labels this outlook “Mediterranean” in an\nattempt to anchor his views to the place he grew up and to evoke in\nhis readers its sense of harmony and appreciation of physical\nlife. There is no substantive argument for the label, nor is one\npossible given his method of simply selecting who and what counts as\nrepresentative of the “Mediterranean” view while excluding\nothers—e.g., some Greek writers, not many Romans. In place of\nargument, he paints a concluding vision of Mediterranean harmony that\nhe hopes will be stirring and lyrical, binding the reader to his\ninsights. \n\nAs a political tract The Rebel asserts that Communism leads\ninexorably to murder, and then explains how revolutions arise from\ncertain ideas and states of spirit. But he makes no close analysis of\nmovements or events, gives no role to material needs or oppression, and\nregards the quest for social justice as a metaphysically inspired\nattempt to replace “the reign of grace by the reign of\njustice” (R, 56).  \n\nFurthermore, Camus insists that these attitudes are built into\nMarxism. In “Neither Victims nor Executioners” he declared\nhimself a socialist but not a Marxist. He rejected the Marxist\nacceptance of violent revolution and the consequentialist maxim that\n“the end justifies the\n means.”[3]\n “In the Marxian perspective,” he wrote sweepingly,\n“a hundred thousand deaths is a small price to pay for the\nhappiness of hundreds of millions” (Camus 1991, 130). Marxists\nthink this, Camus asserted, because they believe that history has a\nnecessary logic leading to human happiness, and thus they accept\nviolence to bring it about. \n\nIn The Rebel Camus takes this assertion a further step:\nMarxism is not primarily about social change but is rather a revolt\nthat “attempts to annex all creation.” Revolution\nemerges when revolt seeks to ignore the limits built into human\nlife. By an “inevitable logic of nihilism” Communism\nclimaxes the modern trend to deify man and to transform and unify the\nworld. Today’s revolutions yield to the blind impulse, originally\ndescribed in The Myth of Sisyphus, “to demand order in\nthe midst of chaos, and unity in the very heart of the ephemeral”\n(MS, 10). As does the rebel who becomes a revolutionary who\nkills and then justifies murder as legitimate. \n\nAccording to Camus, the execution of King Louis XVI during the\nFrench Revolution was the decisive step demonstrating the pursuit of\njustice without regard to limits. It contradicted the original\nlife-affirming, self-affirming, and unifying purpose of revolt. This\ndiscussion belongs to Camus’s “history of European\npride,” which is prefaced by certain ideas from the Greeks and\ncertain aspects of early Christianity, but begins in earnest with the\nadvent of modernity. Camus focuses on a variety of major figures,\nmovements, and literary works: the Marquis de Sade, romanticism,\ndandyism, The Brothers Karamazov, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche,\nsurrealism, the Nazis, and above all the Bolsheviks. Camus describes\nrevolt as increasing its force over time and turning into an ever more\ndesperate nihilism, overthrowing God and putting man in his place,\nwielding power more and more brutally. Historical revolt, rooted in\nmetaphysical revolt, leads to revolutions seeking to eliminate\nabsurdity by using murder as their central tool to take total control\nover the world. Communism is the contemporary expression of this\nWestern sickness. \n\nIn the twentieth century, Camus claims, murder has become\n“reasonable,” “theoretically defensible,” and\njustified by doctrine. People have grown accustomed to “logical\ncrimes”—that is, mass death either planned or foreseen, and\nrationally justified. Thus Camus calls “logical crime” the\ncentral issue of the time, seeks to “examine meticulously the\narguments by which it is justified” (R, 3), and sets out to\nexplore how the twentieth century became a century of slaughter. \n\nWe might justly expect an analysis of the arguments he speaks of,\nbut The Rebel changes focus. Human reason is confused by\n“slave camps under the flag of freedom, massacres justified by\nphilanthropy or by a taste for the superhuman” (R,\n4)—the first two refer to Communism, the third to Nazism. In the\nbody of the text, Nazism virtually drops out (it was, he says, a\nsystem of “irrational terror”—not at all what\ninterested Camus), sharply narrowing the inquiry. His shift is\nrevealed by his question: How can murder be committed with\npremeditation and be justified by philosophy? It turns out that the\n“rational murder” Camus was concerned with is not\ncommitted by capitalists or democrats, colonialists or imperialists,\nor by Nazis—but only by Communists. \n\nHe does not address the Holocaust, and although his had been a voice\nof protest against Hiroshima in 1945, he does not now ask how it\nhappened. As a journalist he had been one of the few to indict French\ncolonialism, but he does not mention it, except in a footnote. How was\nit possible for Camus to focus solely on the violence of Communism,\ngiven the history he had lived, in the very midst of the French\ncolonial war in Vietnam, and when he knew that a bitter struggle over\nAlgeria lay ahead? It seems he became blinded by ideology, separating\nCommunism from the other evils of the century and directing his animus\nthere.  Camus’s ideas, of course, had developed and matured over the\nyears since he first began writing about revolt. But something else\nhad happened: his agenda had changed. Absurdity and revolt, his\noriginal themes, had been harnessed as an alternative to Communism,\nwhich had become the archenemy. The philosophy of revolt became\nCold-War ideology. \n\nBecause The Rebel claimed to describe the attitude that lay\nbehind the evil features of contemporary revolutionary politics, it\nbecame a major political event. Readers could hardly miss his\ndescription of how the impulse for emancipation turned into organized,\nrational murder as the rebel-become-revolutionary attempted to order an\nabsurd universe. In presenting this message, Camus sought not so much\nto critique Stalinism as its apologists. His specific targets\nwere intellectuals attracted to Communism—as he himself had been\nin the 1930s. \n\nOne of these targets was Jean-Paul Sartre, and toward the end of\nThe Rebel Camus now took aim at his friend’s evolving \npolitics. Camus focuses on “the cult of history”\nagainst which the entire book is directed and his belief that\n“the existentialists,” led by Sartre, had fallen victim to\nthe idea that revolt should lead to revolution. Within Camus’s\nframework, Sartre is challenged as trying, like the predecessors\ncriticized in The Myth of Sisyphus, to escape the absurdity\nwith which his own thinking began by turning to Marxism. This is a bit\nof a stretch because Sartre was still several years from declaring\nhimself a Marxist, and it shows Camus’s tendency towards sweeping\ngeneralization rather than close analysis. But it also reflects his\ncapacity for interpreting a specific disagreement in the broadest\npossible terms—as a fundamental conflict of philosophies. \n\nThe concluding chapters of The Rebel are punctuated with\nemphatic words of conclusion (alors, donc, ainsi,\nc’est pourquoi), which are rarely followed by\nconsequences of what comes before and often introduce further\nassertions, without any evidence or analysis. They are studded with\ncarefully composed topic sentences for major ideas—which one\nexpects to be followed by paragraphs, pages, and chapters of\ndevelopment but, instead, merely follow one another and wait\nuntil the next equally well-wrought topic sentence.  \nAs often in the book, the reader must be prepared to follow an\nabstract dance of concepts, as “rebellion,”\n“revolution,” “history,”\n“nihilism,” and other substantives stand on their own,\nwithout reference to human agents. The going gets even muddier as we\nnear the end and the text verges on incoherence. How then is it\npossible that Foley judges The Rebel philosophically as\nCamus’s “most important book” (Foley, 55)? \nIn these pages Camus is going back over familiar ground, contrasting\nthe implicit religiosity of a future-oriented outlook that claims to\nunderstand and promote the logic of history, and justifying violence\nto implement it, with his more tentative “philosophy of limits,” with\nits sense of risk, “calculated ignorance,” and living in the\npresent. However the strain stems from the fact that he is doing so\nmuch more. As he tries to bring the book to a conclusion he is\nwrestling with its most difficult theme—that the resort to\nviolence is both inevitable and “impossible.” The rebel lives in\ncontradiction. He or she cannot abandon the possibility of lying,\ninjustice, and violence, for they are part of the rebel’s condition,\nand will of necessity enter into the struggle against oppression. “He\ncannot, therefore, absolutely claim not to kill or lie, without\nrenouncing his rebellion and accepting, once and for all, evil and\nmurder.” In other words, to not rebel is to become an accomplice of\noppression. Rebellion, Camus has insisted, will entail murder. Yet\nrebellion, “in principle,” is a protest against death, just as it is a\nsource of the solidarity that binds the human community. He has said\nthat death is the most fundamental of absurdities, and that at root\nrebellion is a protest against absurdity. Thus to kill any other human\nbeing, even an oppressor, is to disrupt our solidarity, in a sense to\ncontradict our very being. It is impossible, then, to embrace\nrebellion while rejecting violence.  \n\nThere are those, however, who ignore the dilemma: these are the\nbelievers in history, heirs of Hegel and Marx who imagine a time when\ninequality and oppression will cease and humans will finally be\nhappy. For Camus this resembles the paradise beyond this life promised\nby religions, and he speaks of living for, and sacrificing humans for,\na supposedly better future as, very simply, another\nreligion. Moreover, his sharpest hostility is reserved for\nintellectuals who theorize and justify such movements. Accepting the\ndilemma, Camus is unable to spell out how a successful revolution can\nremain committed to the solidaristic and life-affirming principle of\nrebellion with which it began. He does however suggest two actions\nwhich, if implemented, would be signs of a revolution’s commitment to\nremain rebellious: it would abolish the death penalty and it would\nencourage rather than restrict freedom of speech.  \nIn addition, as Foley points out, Camus attempts to think through the\nquestion of political violence on a small-group and individual\nlevel. Both in The Rebel and in his plays Caligula\nand The Just Assassins, Camus brings his philosophy to bear\ndirectly on the question of the exceptional conditions under which an\nact of political murder can considered legitimate. (1) The target must\nbe a tyrant; (2) the killing must not involve innocent civilians; (3)\nthe killer must be in direct physical proximity to the victim; (4) and\nthere must be no alternative to killing (Foley 93). Furthermore,\nbecause the killer has violated the moral order on which human society\nis based, Camus makes the demand that he or she must be prepared to\nsacrifice his or her own life in return. But if he accepts killing in\ncertain circumstances, Camus rules out mass killing, indirect murder,\nkilling civilians, and killing without an urgent need to remove\nmurderous and tyrannical individuals. These demands turn on the core\nidea of The Rebel, that to rebel is to assert and respect a\nmoral order, and this must be sustained by the murderer’s willingness\nto die. \n\nIn The Rebel, a complex and sprawling essay in philosophy,\nthe history of ideas and literary movements, political philosophy, and\neven aesthetics, Camus extends the ideas he asserted in\nNuptials and developed in The Myth of Sisyphus: the\nhuman condition is inherently frustrating, but we betray ourselves and\nsolicit catastrophe by seeking religious solutions to its limitations.\n“The rebel obstinately confronts a world condemned to death and\nthe impenetrable obscurity of the human condition with his demand for\nlife and absolute clarity. He is seeking, without knowing it, a\nmoral philosophy or a religion” (R, 101). Our\nalternatives are to accept the fact that we are living in a Godless\nuniverse—or to become a revolutionary, who, like the religious\nbeliever committed to the abstract triumph of justice in the future,\nrefuses to live in the present. \n\nHaving critiqued religion in Nuptials, Camus is\nself-consciously exploring the starting points, projects, weaknesses,\nillusions, and political temptations of a post-religious universe. He\ndescribes how traditional religion has lost its force, and how younger\ngenerations have been growing up amid an increasing emptiness and a\nsense that anything is possible. He further claims that modern\nsecularism stumbles into a nihilistic state of mind because it does\nnot really free itself from religion. “Then the only kingdom\nthat is opposed to the kingdom of grace must be founded—namely,\nthe kingdom of justice—and the human community must be reunited\namong the debris of the fallen City of God. To kill God and to build a\nchurch are the constant and contradictory purpose of rebellion”\n(R, 103). Our modern need to create kingdoms and our\ncontinuing search for salvation is the path of catastrophe. This is\nthe path of the metaphysical rebel, who does not see that “human\ninsurrection, in its exalted and tragic forms, is only, and can only\nbe, a prolonged protest against death” (R, 100). \n\nAlthough it is much more than that, Camus’s work can be seen as a\nprecursor to postmodernism. The postmodernists never wholly embraced\nCamus as their predecessor, no doubt because of his central\nmetaphysical concern with absurdity and revolt, and his penchant for\nsweeping judgments and reductive analyses—which\ndifferentiates The Rebel from far less ambitious and more\ndescriptive books like Adorno and Horkheimer’s Dialectic of\nEnlightenment. But in many ways The Rebel was a model\n“genealogy” describing the appearance of intrinsic\ncontradictions of the modern spirit, and Camus’s vision of\nself-limiting revolt is a prescient articulation of a post-Marxist and\npostmodern leftist politics. \n\nAs Ronald Srigley describes it, Camus’s is a complex and profound\nphilosophical project, one that is both neglected and\nmisunderstood—seeking not only to critique modernity but reach\nback to the ancient world to lay the basis for alternative ways of\nthinking and living. Thus in the twenty-first century Camus remains\nrelevant for having looked askance at Western civilization since\nclassical times, at progress, and at the modern world. At the heart of\nhis analyses lie his ambivalent exploration of what it is like to live\nin a Godless universe. “When the throne of God is overturned,\nthe rebel realizes that it is now his own responsibility to create the\njustice, the order, and the unity that he sought in vain within his\nown condition, and in this way to justify the fall of God. Then begins\nthe desperate effort to create, at the price of crime and murder if\nnecessary, the dominion of man” (R, 25). But to\nrestrain oneself from this effort is to feel bereft of justice, order,\nand unity. Camus recognizes that hope and the revolutionary drive are\nessential directions of the post-classical Western spirit, stemming\nfrom its entire world of culture, thought, and feeling. \n\nThis leads to one of the most interesting and perplexing aspects of\nCamus’s thought: his determination to criticize attitudes that he\nfinds to be natural and inevitable. The possibility of suicide haunts\nhumans, as does the fact that we seek an impossible order and an\nunachievable permanence. Camus never directly attacks existentialist\nwriters, but largely confines himself to describing their inability to\nremain consistent with their initial insight.  Similarly, he is clear\nthroughout The Rebel that the metaphysical need that leads to\nCommunism’s terror and Gulag is universal: he describes it and its\nconsequences so that we can better resist it in ourselves as well as\nothers. His reflexive anti-Communism notwithstanding, an underlying\nsympathy unites Camus to those revolutionaries he opposes, because he\nfreely acknowledges that he and they share the same starting points,\noutlook, stresses, temptations, and pitfalls.  Although in political\nargument he frequently took refuge in a tone of moral superiority,\nCamus makes clear through his skepticism that those he disagrees with\nare no less and no more than fellow creatures who give in to the same\nfundamental drive to escape the absurdity that we all share. \n\nThis sense of moral complexity is most eloquent in his short novel\nThe Fall, whose single character, Clamence, has been variously\nidentified as everyman, a Camus-character, and a\nSartre-character. He was all of these. Clamence is clearly\nevil, guilty of standing by as a young woman commits suicide. In\nhim Camus seeks to describe and indict his generation, including both\nhis enemies and himself. Clamence’s life is filled with good\nworks, but he is a hypocrite and knows it. His monologue is filled with\nself-justification as well as the confession of someone torn apart by\nhis guilt but unable to fully acknowledge it. Sitting at a bar in\nAmsterdam, he descends into his own personal hell, inviting the reader\nto follow him. In telling Clamence’s story, Camus was clearly\nseeking to empathize as well as describe, to understand as well as\ncondemn. Clamence is a monster, but Clamence is also just another human\nbeing (Aronson 2004, 192-200). \n\nCamus won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1957, after The\nFall was published. The story, a literary masterpiece,\ndemonstrates a unique capacity at the heart of his philosophical\nwriting. Life is no one single, simple thing, but a series of tensions\nand dilemmas. The most seemingly straightforward features of life are\nin fact ambiguous and even contradictory. Camus recommends that we\navoid trying to resolve them. We need to face the fact that we can\nnever successfully purge ourselves of the impulses that threaten to\nwreak havoc with our lives. Camus’s philosophy, if it has a single\nmessage, is that we should learn to tolerate, indeed embrace the\nfrustration and ambivalence that humans cannot escape.","contact.mail":"ac7159@wayne.edu","contact.domain":"wayne.edu"}]
