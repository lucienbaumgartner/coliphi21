The discussion distinguishes various\nperspectives on the subjective character of religious experience, and\nexamines the relation between religious experience and experience of\nthe material world. It also considers the interaction between\nexperience, conceptual framework (including religious doctrine) and\npractice, and the contribution, if any, of emotional feelings to the\nepistemic significance of religious experience. In all of these ways,\nan appreciation of the “phenomenology of religion” proves\ncentral to an understanding of what is involved practically,\ncognitively and affectively in a religious way of life. \n\nCommentators on religious experience disagree on the significance of\nphenomenological considerations. Is there a phenomenology that is\ndistinctive of religious experience? And if there is, do we have a\nreliable vocabulary to describe it? Is there a phenomenology of\nmystical experience which crosses faith boundaries? Or are such\nexperiences saturated with tradition-specific doctrinal assumptions?\nAre reports of religious experiences in central cases best read as\ndoctrine-inspired interpretations of the subjective character of the\nexperience, rather than as accounts of their phenomenology? And does\nthe affective phenomenology of religious experience do any epistemic\nwork? Let's consider some of these issues. \nWilliam Alston (1991, Chapter 1) has noted that we don't have a\nwell-developed vocabulary for the description of the phenomenal qualia\nof “mystical” experience. (Compare William James's\nsuggestion that “mystical” experiences are\n“ineffable”: 1902, p. 380.) If someone takes God's\ngoodness to be displayed in, say, a mountain landscape, then the\nphenomenology of their experience can perhaps be set down easily\nenough, at least in some central respects; but what about the case\nwhere an experience is said to be more directly of God (the case that\nAlston intends to pick out by the expression “mystical\nperception”)? Alston suggests that our inability to describe the\nelements of such experiences from a phenomenological point of view\ndoes not imply that they lack a distinctive phenomenology, or that\nthey fail to be directed at some mind-independent reality, in rather\nthe way that sense experiences are. \nWe lack a relevant vocabulary, he argues, because we cannot construct\nany simple correlation between a range of “stimulus\nconditions” for mystical perception and the kinds of experience\nthat are likely to arise under those conditions. And therefore we\ncannot refine a vocabulary for the description of mystical experience\nby replication of relevant conditions and renewed attention to the\nphenomenology of the experiences that occur under those conditions. By\ncontrast, there is in general no difficulty in specifying the\nphenomenology of an experience of, say, turning one's face into a\nbreeze, because it is easy to recreate the stimulus conditions for\nsuch an experience, and we can therefore attend repeatedly to the\ncharacter of the experience. And since others can also do this, we can\nestablish a public language for the description of such\nexperiences. \nThis difficulty in identifying the stimulus conditions for mystical\nperception in no way impugns its epistemic worth, Alston thinks,\nbecause God is said to be a personal reality, and an experience of\nGod's presence cannot be brought about, therefore, in some relatively\nmechanical way, simply by creating an appropriate set of sensory or\nother conditions. (Compare O'Hear 1984, Chapter 2.) So given what we\nmean by “God,” it is only to be expected that mystical\nperception will fail to yield a vocabulary that will allow us to\nspecify at all precisely a correlative phenomenology. In other words,\neven if (perhaps especially if) mystical perception is veridical, we\nshould not expect to have such a vocabulary. Accordingly, the absence\nof the vocabulary cannot be thought to constitute an objection to the\ngood epistemic standing of such experiences. \nNotwithstanding these considerations, Alston and other commentators\nhave noted that in the Christian mystical tradition anyway there is,\nin fact, quite a well developed vocabulary for describing the\nsubjective quality of such experiences. This vocabulary is modelled on\nthat of ordinary sense perception. So there are “spiritual\nsensations” of touch, sight, taste, smell and hearing that are\ntaken to be in some way analogous to their counterparts in ordinary\nsense perception. As Nelson Pike (1992) notes, this tradition has\ncommonly distinguished three varieties of experience of God: those\nassociated with the “prayer of quiet,” the “prayer\nof union,” and “rapture,” in order of increasing\nintimacy of acquaintance with God. And each of these phases of the\nspiritual life, it has been said, is to be associated with its own\ndistinctive phenomenology. \nFor example, speaking of the “prayer of quiet,” Pike\ncomments that in such experiences \nOf course, even this vocabulary can only carry a person so far towards\nan understanding of the phenomenology of the experiences that are here\nbeing described, because the vocabulary is, after all, only patterned\non that which applies in ordinary sense experience. So to ascertain\nmore exactly the nature of these “spiritual sensations” it\nwould be necessary to experience them firsthand (Pike 1992, p. 161).\nNonetheless, the convergence of mystical testimony upon some such set\nof descriptions gives us a reason to think that these experiences,\nlike ordinary sense experiences, can be ordered in ways that admit of\na degree of inter-personal confirmation — and that there is a\nkind of correlation between the “angle of view” one takes\nup in relation to the purported object of the experience\n(corresponding to one's progression through the spiritual life, and\none's degree of closeness to God) and the phenomenology of the\nassociated experience. \nThese observations suggest another response to the objection that\nmystical perception is epistemically defective because we lack a\nreliable vocabulary for the description of the phenomenology of such\nexperiences. On the contrary, it may be said, there is such a\nvocabulary, albeit that it is not as developed or its full meaning as\ngenerally accessible as the vocabulary that we use for the description\nof the phenomenology of ordinary sensory experience. \nSome commentators have sought to distinguish between the component of\na report of a religious experience that is a record of its\nphenomenology and the component that involves an interpretation of the\nexperience according to some favoured doctrinal scheme (Stace 1961).\nAs Pike notes, it is possible in principle that whole traditions of\nmystical experience have been more concerned to communicate the\ndoctrinal implications of such experience rather than its\nphenomenological content (1992, p. 174), and that they have adopted a\nvocabulary for talking about the experiences that will suit this\npurpose. But in light of the language of “spiritual\nsensations” we may (with Pike) doubt that this is the right way\nto understand the Christian mystical tradition. At least some strands\nof this tradition seem to display a keen interest in recording the\nphenomenology of various experiences. (See Turner 1995 for a\ncontrasting, non-experientialist reading of Christian mystical\nwriting.) \nAnd there is a ready “spiritual” explanation of why there\nshould be such an interest: so that the believer can track their\nprogress through the spiritual life. Where the “ordinary\nbeliever” is concerned, such progress is not likely to involve\nsome abstractly intellectual kind of achievement, and on some\napproaches anyway, it is not likely to involve some new proximity to\nGod that can be specified independently of changes in the\nphenomenology of one's experience. So in these cases, the\nphenomenology serves to reassure the believer of their growing\ncloseness to God. \nSuch an approach can admit of corruptions, as when the believer seeks\nout certain exalted experiences, and takes pride in them because they\nare thought to signify intimacy with God, or perhaps takes pleasure in\nthem simply because of their thrilling or in other ways pleasing\nphenomenological feel. David Pugmire (1998) speaks of\n“dramaturgical” and “narcissistic” cases of\nemotional experience where, respectively, the emotion is taken to\nsignify one's superior status in some respect, or where it is valued\nbecause of its pleasant phenomenological feel. And we might think of\nsome religious experiences in similar terms. However, these cases are\npresumably corruptions, and the tradition that has evolved the\nlanguage of “spiritual sensations” need not as such have\nany tendency to value religious experience for these reasons. \nIndeed, in so far as spiritual sensations are prized for these reasons\n— because of their phenomenological feel or as a way of\nunderwriting a person's sense of their own importance — then\nthey will be religiously defective (given the religious importance of\nthe virtue of humility for example); and they are also likely to be\nepistemically defective, because of the suspicion that the believer,\nwhether consciously or not, is engineering the production of such\nexperiences for the advantages that they confer in these respects. It\nis in part for these reasons that there exists a very broadly based\ntradition of testing religious experiences by their fruits in\npractice. An experience that fails to issue in a livelier regard for\nthe interests of one's neighbour, for example, is to that extent\ndisconfirmed on religious grounds (Alston 1991, pp.\n250–254). \nIt is worth noting, with Pike, that even if a description of a\nreligious experience employs a relatively theoretical or\nmetaphysically loaded vocabulary, rather than simply using the\nlanguage of sensation, it does not follow that this is an\ninterpretation of the experience rather than an attempt to communicate\nits phenomenological content: it may be, for example, that one's\nexperience is as of being appeared to by a very powerful spiritual\nbeing, rather than simply a matter of certain sensations of heat,\ntouch or whatever being undergone, which are then interpreted on the\nbasis of some doctrinal scheme. \nSome commentators have argued on the contrary that the theistic\nmeaning of an experience cannot be given directly in its\nphenomenology, since “it's God” or “it's\nomnipotent” can never be part of the phenomenology of an\nexperience but must involve some interpretation of the phenomenology\n(Forgie 1984 and Zangwill 2004). Whatever stance one takes here, it\nwill be necessary to acknowledge that in ordinary sense experience we\ncommonly recognise someone without reliance upon inference, rather\nthan starting from some set of minimally interpreted sensations\n(patches of colour and so on) and inferring that the presence of this\nperson in particular would best explain these phenomena. \nSome scholars have sought to apply the distinction between experience\nand interpretation to theistic mysticism in particular, arguing that\ntheistic mystical experiences have the same content as non-theistic\nmystical experiences, and are just differently interpreted and\nreported, because in all cases mystical experience is experience of\n“undifferentiated unity” (Stace 1961, p. 236). (The\nthought is that mystics who are orthodox theists have had to reckon\nwith the teaching that there is an ineradicable ontological\ndistinction between creature and creator, and this requirement has\nshaped their reports.) And some have wondered whether\n“introvertive” mystical experiences in all traditions (as\ndistinct from “extrovertive” mystical experiences, where\nmaterial objects are experienced as one) are devoid of any\nphenomenological content, in so far as “what emerges is a state\nof pure consciousness: ‘pure’ in the sense that it is not\nthe consciousness of any empirical content. It has no content except\nitself” (Stace, p. 86). It is tempting to represent such\nexperiences in these terms in part, no doubt, because any attribution\nof a phenomenological content to an experience is likely to imply a\nsubject-object structure (to imply some account of how something\nseemed to the subject of the experience), so contradicting the\npurported, non-dualistic content of an introvertive mystical\nexperience. (Compare Plotinus on union with the One in\nEnneads VI.9.11.) \nOther commentators have rejected the idea that mystics across\ntraditions have experiences that are subjectively the same, but just\ndifferently reported. On the contrary, they say, the categories of a\nfaith tradition will make a difference not simply to the ways in which\nexperiences are reported, but to the character of the experience\nitself (Katz 1978). \nJohn Hick's (1989) study is a particularly influential application of\nthis Kantian sort of perspective within the domain of religious\nexperience. Hick argues that religious experiences are structured\naccording to tradition-specific sets of religious concepts. On this\nview, all the major faiths offer a way of encountering one and the\nsame ultimate religious reality — but Christians encounter this\nreality, in their religious experience, in Trinitarian mode, while\nHindus encounter it as Brahman, and so on. \nHick is clear that this is not a matter of the advocates of the\nvarious faiths having an experience whose phenomenological content is\nmuch the same across the traditions, but just differently interpreted\nand differently reported; rather, tradition-specific concepts (such as\nthose of the Trinity and Brahman) enter into the content of the\nexperience. Analogously, we might say that there is a sense in which a\nnewborn infant and I have the same experience when we look out upon a\nroom of tables and chairs, in so far as the same image is imprinted on\nour retinas; but we would presumably wish to say that the\nphenomenology of these experiences remains quite different even so,\nand that only I have an experience that seems to be of tables and\nchairs, and in which my visual field is organised accordingly (so that\nregions of colour are sorted into table- and chair-like\nconfigurations). \nThis account of religious experience and the contribution of doctrine\nin shaping its phenomenology sits very well with Hick's pluralistic\nreading of the major faiths. On this view, these traditions are all\nvalid in so far as all provide a vehicle for the experience of\nultimate religious reality or what Hick terms “the Real”\n(an expression that is intended to be neutral between the various\ndesignations for this reality that are favoured by the different\ntraditions). And the traditions are indeed all equally valid in so far\nas there can be no question of the doctrinal content of any one\ntradition's experience of the Real corresponding more closely to the\ncharacter of the Real “in itself”; rather, the doctrinal\ncontent of such experiences derives in every case from the side of\nculture or a person's religious formation, rather than mapping the\ncharacter of the Real in itself. Identifying the intrinsic character\nof the Real is beyond the scope of any human enquiry. Instead, we have\nto make do with appearances of the Real, where these appearances vary\nwith the culturally constituted ways of being religious that are made\navailable in the various faiths. \nOf course, this picture invites the objection that a culturally\nreductionist account of religious experience is surely then to be\npreferred: if the phenomenological content of religious experience is\nfixed in all its detail by a person's socio-religious context, then\nwhy not think of such experience as simply a cultural product, rather\nthan as having some culture-transcendent reference (Stoeber 1992)? To\nshore up the claim of religious experience to connect the believer to\na mind-independent reality we require, rather, some sort of\nconvergence across traditions concerning the nature of the reality\nthat is revealed in such experiences — instead of Hick's\nrigorously agnostic (and therefore tradition-neutral) affirmation that\nthe Real in itself eludes all our categories, and so cannot be\nconsidered as personal or impersonal, one or many, or even good or\nevil. (Compare Byrne 1995.) \nHick's approach might also seem to be in trouble for more\nstraightforwardly religious reasons: as he notes, most believers\nprivilege the picture of the sacred that is favoured in their own\ntradition (rather than thinking of that picture as simply another way\nof representing an appearance of the Real). And perhaps this is\nreligiously necessary. If believers thought that their religious\nsymbols, and in turn the content of their religious experience, lacked\nany ultimate reference (since these symbols are concerned simply with\nthe realm of appearances), then it may be doubted whether they would\nbe adequately motivated to live religiously: if religious symbols are\ninterpreted in this agnostic way, and if the phenomenology of\nreligious experience fails therefore to track in any respect the\ncharacter of the Real in itself, then how is the Real to be\nintelligibly the object of a response of, say, love and faith, rather\nthan simply of bafflement or perhaps indifference? \nSo philosophical treatments of the phenomenology of religious\nexperience draw quite diverse conclusions: religious experience (in at\nleast some central cases) is said variously to have no\nphenomenological content (not to be like anything), or to have a\ncontent that at any rate cannot be communicated readily in verbal\nterms, or to have a phenomenological content that can be described\nbecause it is analogous to the “sensational” quality of\nordinary sensory experience, where this content can then be\ninterpreted in doctrinal terms, or to have a phenomenological content\nthat is given in the doctrinal scheme of the relevant faith tradition,\nwhere this scheme functions rather like a lens through which religious\nreality is viewed, or to have a phenomenological content that never\ncomes clearly into view in public discourse, since reports of such\nexperiences typically focus upon the implied doctrinal meaning of the\nexperience which is, on this account, to be sharply distinguished from\nits phenomenological content. \nThese disputes sometimes have a relatively conceptual character, and\nsometimes are rooted more clearly in questions about how to read\nvarious bodies of documentary evidence. As we have seen, a person's\nstance on these matters may well make a difference to their approach\nto other issues: including the question of whether religious\nexperience is discredited by the difficulties in describing its\nphenomenological content, and the questions of whether we should\nfavour a pluralist account of the faiths or a reductionist reading of\nreligious experience. \nSo far we have been concentrating upon religious experience understood\nas experience of God or the sacred otherwise understood. Some\ncommentators have argued that the philosophy of religion literature\nhas paid insufficient attention to the fact that, in the first\ninstance, religious experience is commonly experience of a material\ncontext, a building or landscape for example. And the phenomenology of\nthe experience is therefore given, at least in significant part, in\nour experience of a set of physical objects (Brown 2004). \nOn this sort of approach, religious experience is sometimes conceived\nnot so much as an encounter with God considered as a particular item\nof experience, but more as a matter of seeing “in depth”\nthe religious significance of a material context. If we take up this\nsuggestion, then a new range of possibilities for developing a\nphenomenology of religion comes into view. \nSome scholars have argued that spaces reserved for religious activity\nhave a distinctive character, which sets them apart from merely\nprofane spaces (Eliade 1958). For instance, an approach to a sacred\nspace may require the believer to cross various thresholds, and\nperhaps to undertake a relatively arduous journey on account of the\ntopography of the place, as when it is set on a mountain or\nisland. \nExpounding this tradition of thought, Thomas Barrie notes that: \nSimilarly Barrie writes of how: “The pilgrim's route along the\npath underlines the gravity of the journey being undertaken and gives\nopportunities for the initiate to turn back” (p. 60). Implied in\nthis sort of structuring of sacred space is a correlative\nphenomenology: one that requires of the devotee an appropriate\nseriousness and focussed attention, if they are to grasp aright the\nsacred reality that is to be encountered in the sanctuary. (Compare\nJones 2000 on the various strategies of “ritual-architectural\nallurement.”) \nSome Christian commentators have taken exception to this sort of\npicture, arguing that what makes a place religiously special for a\nChristian is simply the presence there of a Christian community,\nengaged in a life of other-regarding love (White 1995). Acknowledging\nthis difference of view, Harold Turner (1979) distinguishes between\nthe domus dei and domus ecclesiae approaches to sacred architecture.\nOn the first perspective, a holy building is conceived as a house of\nGod, and it should therefore be a suitably imposing space, displaying\nsuperior craftsmanship and adorned with the finest materials —\nall of which will imply a correlative phenomenology, whereby the mind\nis lifted up towards God. (Compare Abbot Suger's account of the abbey\nof Saint Denis.) By contrast, on the domus ecclesiae perspective, the\nchurch building functions primarily as a meeting place, and its\nconstruction should therefore serve the needs of the community which\ngathers there, and facilitate their interaction and fellowship. \nTurner gives as an example of the domus dei approach the meditation\nroom at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. This space\nfeatures a block of iron ore illuminated by a shaft of natural light\nthat descends from a skylight. Accordingly, the place speaks of a\nmeeting of heaven and earth, of light and dark, and of the ambiguous\nhistory of human beings in their relationship to the earth, in so far\nas iron ore has been used for the making both of weapons and of\nploughshares. And by virtue of the conditions of stillness and dimmed\nlight that obtain here, the room invites a response of quiet,\nreverential seriousness. In all of these respects there is implied,\nonce more, a correlative phenomenology. \nIn fact, the relationship between the conception of sacred\narchitecture that Barrie describes and Turner's domus ecclesiae\ntradition need not be flatly antithetical. For Turner acknowledges\nthat even within a Christian context it will be appropriate to make\nsome use of “temple” elements, not least for those members\nof the community who have not yet fully assimilated a Christian\nunderstanding of these matters. And more importantly, even a building\nthat adheres uncompromisingly to domus ecclesiae principles will over\ntime take on some of the characteristics of the domus dei ideal\n— because even when it is not in use for worship, the fact that\nit has been organically caught up in the life of the Christian\ncommunity will quite properly condition our sense of its significance,\nand the sort of use to which it can be put. \nHere Turner notes the experience of a young Quaker who contrary to his\nprofessed principles admits to feeling that he ought not to smoke\nwithin the meeting house when he is taking his turn on the cleaning\nrota. This response is fitting, Turner notes, in so far as the history\nof the building as a site of Christian gathering rightly shapes our\nsense of its meaning in the present (pp. 327–328). And this\nsense of the building's significance will imply a correlative\nphenomenology: the space will be experienced as inviting a respectful\nor dignified kind of appropriation. \nOn the other side, Barrie notes that while the sacred place is set\napart as a zone where the gods may be encountered, this is not to say\nthat such places have no part to play in the life of a community. On\nthe contrary, sacred spaces will typically serve as an important focus\nfor a community's profession of the values that bind it together\n(1996, p. 52). \nSome Christian commentators have sought to identify a similar middle\nground by acknowledging that Christian categories, and the Christian\nliturgy, are likely to be experienced as strange or even alien by many\nin modern western societies. The evangelisation of such people may\nwell depend then, in the first instance, not so much upon exposure to\nspecifically Christian concepts as upon experiences of transcendence\nmediated through encounters with the beauty or majesty of the natural\nworld, or of church or other buildings. These experiences serve then\nas a propaedeutic for Christian teaching. (Compare Brown 2004, pp.\n407–408.) \nIt is reasonable to suppose, for example, that the religious\nsignificance of the great cathedrals of the medieval period was not\njust a matter of the Christian stories with which they were\nassociated, in so far as they were connected with, say, the deeds of\nparticular holy figures or their relics. Their meaning is also given\nin their sheer sensory impact: through their monumental scale and\ncontrolled use of light, and through the interplay between the\nsolidity of stone and the diaphanous qualities of glass, these\nstructures can speak of the sacred by inducing a response of hushed\nwonderment. \nOf course natural spaces are also able to evoke a sense of the sacred,\nfor the same sorts of reason. And Erazim Kohák has argued that\nsome of the key concepts of western philosophical theology have their\noriginal life setting in experiences of nature. On this basis he\noffers a kind of phenomenological rendering of the cosmological and\ndesign arguments. \nHe writes for example that: \nHere, Kohák is giving a phenomenological counterpart for the\nconcept of contingency. Of course, he does not think that what results\nis a newly cogent form of the cosmological argument: he is not giving\nan argument at all. What he is doing, we might say, is to bring out\nthe religious resonance of the concept of contingency: the role of the\nconcept is not simply to signify the possibility of not-being but,\nwhen appropriated in the way he describes, to draw us into a life of\n“thanksgiving”. As he says, solitude, and being free from\nthe feeling of technological mastery that is characteristic of urban\nlife, “teaches thanks” (p. 188). \nSimilarly Kohák comments that \nStandard versions of the argument from design, when they appeal to the\nworld's lawlikeness, do not require any reference to the phenomenology\nof human experience. But, here, Kohák is giving a\nphenomenological rendering of the concept of order, and seeking to\nroot our sense of the divine presence in this more\n“intimate,” phenomenologically informed understanding of\nthe world's regularity. \nAgain, as with the concept of contingency, his concern is to bring out\nthe existential import of the concept of order. When grounded in the\nkind of experience he describes here, order does not just signify\nlawlikeness, a notion that has no particular phenomenological content,\nbut a realm of belonging, a place that has been set in order by\nsomeone, so that it can be inhabited and constitute a home. This way\nof developing the concept points once more to its relevance for\nreligious life: to experience order in these terms is to experience\nGod as present in the world, and as caring for it. \nSo we could take Kohák to be providing a phenomenological\nrendering of the concept of divine presence. He offers this\ncomparison: \nIt might be said: the content of the concept of divine presence is\nreally given, surely, in standard philosophical and theological\nanalyses of it. To say that God is omnipresent, for example, is to say\nthat God is directly active in all places, or that God has unmediated\nknowledge of, and power over, everything that happens wherever it\nhappens. (See Aquinas, Summa Theologiae 1a. 8. 3 and Swinburne 1993.)\nOn this view, Kohák's observations constitute a kind of\npsychological gloss on the concept: we human beings sometimes register\nthe divine presence in such experiences of “mineness,” but\nthese experiences form no part of the concept. \nIt is implied in Kohák's discussion that the experience of\nmineness enters more deeply into our understanding of divine presence\nthan this account would suggest. Analogously we might say that if we\nare to have a full understanding of what it is for something to be\nblue, then we require firsthand experience of blueness, since someone\nwho has not had this experience will not know this truth about blue:\nthat it is manifest in human experience in this way. (Compare the\nexample of Mary, developed in Jackson 1982.) \nKohák is suggesting, I think, that our understanding of divine\npresence, or equally of contingency and order, also has some\nphenomenological content: to see in full what it is for God to be\npresent, one needs to have some experiential knowledge of the contexts\nin which the concept of divine presence originates. Or to put the\nmatter otherwise, he is saying that to see in full the religious\nimport of the concepts of order, contingency and divine presence, to\nsee what role they might play in a religious life, it is necessary to\nhave some appreciation of the relevant phenomenology. (This sort of\npoint is often made in the phenomenological literature by saying that\n“empathy” is required if we are to understand the defining\nconcepts of a faith tradition: see Dupre 1998, pp. 36–37.) \nThere are parallels here with discussion in ethics, where some\ncommentators have supposed, likewise, that a full appreciation of\ncertain cardinal moral concepts depends upon being able to grasp,\nthrough first hand experience, the relevant phenomenology. Raimond\nGaita, for example, argues that our concept of the individuality of\nother persons (in the sense that is relevant when we speak of them as\nbeing from a moral point of view irreplaceable) is not fully\nexpressible independently of reference to the phenomenology of our\nmoral experience. The sense of this concept is given in, for instance,\nthe experience of being haunted by the victim of your wrong-doing,\nwhere it this particular individual who haunts you, rather than some\nrepresentative of humanity in general, or someone whose individuality\ncan be adequately specified simply by reference to, for example, their\ndistinguishing empirical properties (of hair colour, height, or\nwhatever it may be) (1991, p. 51). \nIn the same sort of way, Kohák is taking the notion of divine\npresence, when it functions in religiously resonant ways, to be rooted\nin certain experiences of the world, so that someone who lacks those\nexperiences will not have the same idea of divine presence. This\nthought might seem to offend against the public character of our\nconcepts. But it is perhaps more a matter of the public meaning of\ncertain concepts being open to deepening relative to experience. Iris\nMurdoch remarks similarly on how a person's concept of courage at the\nage of twenty is not the same as their concept of courage at the age\nof forty: life experience contributes to a deepening of the concept\n(1985, p. 29). \nWe have been considering various understandings of the phenomenology\nof religious experience, where religious experience may be construed\nas an encounter with God as a particular entity, or as, in the first\ninstance, an encounter with a material context, given by our built or\nnatural environment or some combination of these. In this latter case,\nit may be that God is manifest not so much as a particular item in the\nperceptual field, but by way of the significance that attaches to a\nmaterial context, rather as, on Kohák‘s view, our sense\nof the divine presence is grounded in a recognition of the\nsignificance that attaches to the forest as a realm of\n“mineness.” In this way, different emphases in the\nphenomenology of religion are likely to correlate with different\nconceptions of God: not only in so far as a given conception of God\nhas a distinctive phenomenal content, but also in so far as different\nphenomenologies are likely to be associated with different conceptions\nof the sense in which God may be regarded as\n“individual.” \nMany commentators have thought that the phenomenology of religious\nexperience depends in significant part on its affective tone. When God\nis made known in the experience of guilt, as someone to whom we are\naccountable and who summons us to newness of life, or when God is\nrevealed in the feeling of wonderment at the vastness or beauty of the\ncosmos, or when God is manifest in the experience of encountering some\nthrilling and awe-inspiring “other,” or in many other\ncases too, the religious import of the experience is given in large\npart in our affective responses. It is noteworthy too how often the\nlanguage of “spiritual sensations” involves reference to\nstates of feeling. And perhaps this is a conceptual requirement: what\nsense would there be in the idea of a religiously authentic encounter\nwith God, the supreme good and maker of all, which left the subject of\nthe experience unmoved? \nI say “emotional feelings” in the heading here to\ndistinguish this case from various other uses of feeling language: as\nfor example when we say that we felt something was missing, a usage\nthat may imply no particular phenomenology but only some intuitive\nregistering of an absence, or when we say that we felt a stab of pain,\nwhich will imply some sort of phenomenology but need not suggest the\nkind of directedness that is typical of emotional feelings, as I shall\nsuggest shortly. (Compare Ryle 1971.) \nAs with the question of its phenomenology more generally, so there is\ncontroversy surrounding the contribution of emotional feelings, in\nparticular, to the character of religious experience. William Alston\nhas asked: if the phenomenological content of a religious experience\nwere to be purely affective, would that be a reason for doubting that\nit is directed at anything? In that case, he notes, we might well\nsuspect that the experience consists in a felt response to a believed\npresence (1991, pp. 49–50), rather than in some presentation of\nGod to the believer. \nThis sort of scepticism about the contribution of the emotions to the\nintentionality or God-directedness of religious experience reflects a\ncertain model of their structure, according to which they are\ncomprised of a thought component and a feeling component, where the\nfirst gives rise to the second (as the thought of God's presence is\nsaid, in this case, to cause a certain feeling). For example,\nembarrassment on this account will involve the thought (which may be\nsimply entertained rather than asserted) that I have done something\nthat will lower the regard in which I am held by others — where\nthis thought gives rise to a feeling of a broadly negative nature,\ninvolving some sort of pain, discomfort or distress (and depending on\nthe model, the particular character of this feeling may be taken to be\nrelative to embarrassment or kindred emotions, or understood in more\ngeneric terms) (see Budd 1985, Chapter 1). \nSo on this standard account, emotion types can be differentiated by\nreference to the thoughts of which they are comprised. Or where two\nemotions have the same thought content, they can be differentiated by\nreference to the state of feeling that is engendered by the thought,\nas when we treat pity and schadenfreude as distinct emotion types,\nsince they involve different felt responses to the thought of someone\nelse's misfortune. \nThis account of the emotions allows that they are directed at the\nworld. So they are not, on this view, to be assimilated to mere\nstomach churnings or twinges or throbbings: they have some sort of\nintellectual content, and they involve more, therefore, than simply a\nregistering in feeling of some physiological disturbance. (Compare\nagain the case of embarrassment: this is not just a matter of feeling\nflushed, and so on.) On this point then, this account locates\nemotional experience more firmly within our intellectual life than did\nthe late nineteenth century and early twentieth century account,\nassociated with William James and others, which treated the emotions\nsimply as ways of recording changes in physiological condition (James\n1884). However, it remains true on this perspective that the\ndirectedness of the emotions is a function of their thought content,\nwhich is understood in distinction from their feeling content. \nSome more recent theories have wanted to challenge this distinction,\nand to regard emotional feelings as themselves forms of thought, or as\nhaving in their own right an intellectual content. This much is often\nimplied in our description of such feelings, as, for example, when we\ncharacterise schadenfreude as a matter of taking pleasure in someone's\nmisfortune. This is to represent the pleasure that arises here as\ndirected at some state of affairs of which it is cognisant, rather\nthan supposing simply that the thought of someone's misfortune gives\nrise to a feeling of pleasure. \nIf we allow that emotional feelings can have some intellectual content\nin their own right, then we have a powerful tool for understanding how\nthe affective phenomenology of religious experience may turn out to be\nintegral to its God-directedness. For example, returning to Alston's\nconcerns regarding the contribution of emotional feelings to the\nphenomenal content of religious experience, if we take emotional\nfeelings to be intrinsically contentful, then we may wish to say that\nthe phenomenology of a religious experience could be purely affective\nwithout this posing any difficulty for the thought that the experience\nis directed at some mind-independent reality — rather than being\nsimply a sensation-like feeling that is caused by the thought that God\nis present. \nThe idea that emotional feelings may constitute a mode of perception\nis a familiar theme in recent work in moral philosophy, in the\nwritings of John McDowell (1981) and others. It has also been defended\nby various philosophers of emotion. For example, John Deigh (1994)\nwrites of how our perception of certain qualities may be realised in\nour felt response to them: I may register the scariness of something\nin my feeling of being scared, rather than say in an affect-neutral\nperception of the thing as scary, which then engenders a felt\nresponse. And analogously we might suppose that on occasions anyway,\nGod is made manifest in certain felt responses, rather than being\nknown in some other fashion, which then gives rise to a correlative\nfeeling (as on the thought-plus-feeling model of emotion). \nAt least some elements of Rudolf Otto's The Idea of the Holy\n(1959) lend themselves to an interpretation of this kind. Here, Otto\nspeaks of how God is made known primordially as the mysterium\ntremendum et fascinans, as a reality that is at once attractive but\nalso inspires a kind of fear or dread. This sort of dread, Otto\ninsists, is sui generis: it is a distinctively religious kind of fear\nthat befits our relation to God, and while it is akin to the fear we\nassociate with the “weird,” it is not to be simply\nconflated with this or any other kind of non-religious fear. \nOtto distinguishes this approach from Schleiermacher's discussion of\nthe “feeling of absolute dependence.” He writes: \nSo on Schleiermacher's account, as read by Otto, the divine reality is\nnot disclosed directly in feeling, but is instead inferred from\nfeeling. By contrast, Otto gives this view of the matter:\n“Rather, the ‘creature-feeling’ is itself a first\nsubjective concomitant and effect of another feeling-element, which\ncasts it like a shadow, but which in itself indubitably has immediate\nand primary reference to an object outside the self” (p. 10).\nHere, Otto commits himself to the thought that the divine reality is\ndisclosed directly in states of feeling, where those states can in\nturn give rise to other states of feeling, including the feeling of\ndependence. \nOf course, there is a further question about how exactly\n“Gefühl” is to be read in this context, but at least some\nof the “feelings” that, according to Otto,\nnon-inferentially disclose the divine reality seem to be affectively\ncharged. For instance, when discussing the “awefulness”\nthat belongs to the “tremendum” dimension of the\nexperience, Otto notes the connection between this feeling and\n“shuddering” or “feeling horror in the real sense of\nthe word,” and he adds that “‘shuddering’ is\nsomething more than ‘natural’, ordinary fear.”\n(Chapter IV, p. 15) Moreover, he begins this chapter by remarking that\n“the nature of the numinous can only be suggested by means of\nthe special way in which it is reflected in the mind in terms of\nfeeling.” (p. 13) In these respects, there is at least some\nbasis for the idea that, in Otto's judgement, God is presented,\ndirectly and non-inferentially, in our affective responses. And these\nresponses, we might suppose, can play this sort of role because of\ntheir distinctive phenomenological character, which marks them out\nfrom the kinds of feeling that arise in other domains of life.\n(Contrast the dialectical model of the relationship between perception\nand feeling that is envisaged in Alvin Plantinga's discussion of\nJonathan Edwards: Plantinga 2000, pp. 301–303.) \nOtto extends this account to provide a theory of religious language\n— doctrinal claims are, he thinks, an attempt to convey in\nrational, conceptually articulate terms the content of a\n“numinous” experience that is itself conceptually\ninarticulate. So here, far from thought generating a correlative\nfeeling, it is feeling and its implicit reckoning with the nature of\nsome transcendent reality that comes first, and discursive thought\nthat follows on behind, trying to stammer out what is known in full\nonly in the relevant experience. One implication of this account is,\nclearly, that the idea of God has some phenomenological content. (See\nSchlamm 1992 for a defence of Otto's stance on this point, in response\nto the criticisms of Katz and others.)  \nThis understanding of emotional feelings can also be brought into\nfruitful dialogue with the second of our models of religious\nexperience, according to which religious experience is not so much a\nmatter of encountering God directly, but is rather concerned with\nfinding a relevant meaning or significance in the ordering of a\nmaterial context. \nPeter Goldie notes that when a person falls on ice for the first time,\nthey may come to a new understanding of the dangers presented by ice,\nwhere this additional increment of understanding is in some way\nembedded in their new fearfulness of ice, and may resist formulation\nin linguistic terms. As he puts the point: “Coming to think of\nit [ice] in this new way is not to be understood as consisting of\nthinking of it in the old way, plus some added-on phenomenal\ningredient — feeling perhaps; rather, the whole way of\nexperiencing, or being conscious of, the world is new…”\n(Goldie 2000, pp. 59–60). We might suppose in particular that\nwhat has changed is that ice has come to assume a new salience in the\nperson's experience of the world, with the result that their\nperceptual field is differently structured when they are in the\npresence of ice, so as to give particular prominence to ice. \nAgain, there are parallels here with the literature in ethics, which\nhas treated moral perception as not so much a matter of identifying\nsome new fact in a situation of moral choice, as of understanding the\nrelative importance of various facts, and grasping which in particular\ndeserve attention or call for some practical response. For example,\nthe virtuous person may not be able to list some further fact\nconcerning the circumstances of various people in a crowded railway\ncarriage, but the fact that a particular passenger is over-burdened by\ntheir bags, and in some discomfort because they have to stand, may\nweigh with this person. This fact may become salient in their\nperception of the scene, and salience here may be a matter, at least\nin part, of their felt response to the passenger and their\npredicament. (Compare Blum 1994, pp. 31–33.) \nIn the same sort of way, we might suppose that the religious believer\nwho is approaching a sacred site of the kind that Barrie describes\nwill need to have their attention focussed appropriately. And we might\nthink that this is the role of the various thresholds and their\nassociated challenges for the body. It is because they engender and\ngive expression to the right kind of emotional responsiveness, broadly\none of reverential seriousness, that these preparatory behaviours\nenable a proper appreciation of the sacred space itself. Here, then,\nrather as with the train example, religious experience takes the form\nof viewing some material context with appropriate salience. (Compare\nJonathan Z. Smith's (1987) proposal that it is the quality of\nattention accorded to sacred objects, in a given context, rather than\nsomething intrinsic to those objects, that marks them out from other\nkinds of object.) \nWe have been exploring various ways in which the phenomenology of\nreligious experience may be construed, in affective and other terms.\nIt is reasonable to suppose, in addition, that the quality of the\nbeliever's strictly mundane experience will be in some respects\nconditioned by their religious commitments, or will need to show some\nsort of consonance with those commitments. \nFor instance, the emotions may be religiously important even if they\nare not bound up with an experience of God or a sacred space, because\nof their role in signalling that certain matters are properly the\nobject of attention. Evolutionary accounts of emotional experience\ncommonly emphasise the significance of the emotions in constituting\npatterns of salience. For instance, it is obviously of adaptive value\nif a large, fast-approaching dog is afforded a certain salience in my\nperceptual field, while the colour of the linoleum floor on which I am\nstanding is consigned to the periphery of my awareness. And in\nstandard cases, to feel fear of a dog is, in part, to view the\nrelevant scene with such salience. (Compare Oatley and Jenkins, 1996.)\nHere, emotional responses help to frame rational thought, by\ndetermining what it is appropriate to attend to and in turn to reason\nabout. And, arguably, similar connections hold in religious\ncontexts. \nFor instance, speaking of revelation, John Henry Newman comments: \nIn this way, a person's emotional experience can mark out certain\nmatters as deserving of closer attention, and thereby this experience\ncan prepare the way for a deepening of religious understanding. Here,\nthe phenomenology of the experience has, once again, a crucial part to\nplay in constituting the relevant pattern of salience. But in this\ncase, the experience is not directly or indirectly of God, but in the\nfirst instance of the condition of one's soul. William James takes a\nsimilar line when he says of “dogmatic or idealistic\ntheology” that “these speculations must … be\nclassed as over-beliefs, buildings-out performed by the intellect into\ndirections of which feelings originally supplied the hint,”\ngiving as an example of such feelings “inner unhappiness and the\nneed of deliverance.” (1902, p. 431) (For the importance of\nemotional responses in framing rational thought, see also Damasio\n1995, pp. 193–194.) \nThis example is a matter of moving from a way of experiencing the\nworld to a doctrinal commitment. We might suppose that it is also\npossible to move in the other direction, since doctrinal commitments\nmay carry implications for how the world is to be experienced in\nsubjective terms. Nicholas Wolterstorff notes, for example, how this\nworld \nFollowing this suggestion, we should suppose that the doctrine of\ncreation implies a correlative affectively toned phenomenology, one\nwhich is open to taking delight in the world, in its materiality. \nReports of conversion experience provide a particularly striking\nexample of how religious commitments may be connected to experience of\nthe everyday world. It is notable that such reports commonly testify\nnot simply to the convert's new-found closeness to God, in prayer for\nexample, but to a generalized shift in the appearance of the physical\nworld. For instance, William James notes how: \nAs one of James's sources remarks: “Natural objects were\nglorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw beauty in\nevery material object in the universe...” (1902, p. 250) Here,\nfollowing conversion, the natural world appears brighter or more\nvivid, so that it seems to be newly transparent to the divine glory.\n(For another account of how a whole domain of experience may take on a\nparticular subjective character and significance, see Cooper 2002 on\n“existential” experience, p. 340.)  \nThere are various ways of understanding the significance of this sort\nof shift in the world's appearance. One potentially helpful category\nis Matthew Ratcliffe's notion of “existential feelings.”\nRatcliffe introduces the category in these terms: \nAs an analogy (or perhaps more than an analogy) we could take the case\nof jet lag. When I am in a jet lagged state, the world in general can\nappear differently to me, and this is in part, no doubt, because of\nthe associated change in my bodily condition. I may feel groggy (here\nis the bodily feeling to which Ratcliffe refers), and at the same time\nthe world in general may take on a new appearance, so that it seems,\nfor instance, out of focus. And we might speculate that, similarly,\nthe convert has undergone a change in bodily condition, and that it is\nthis change that accounts both for their feelings of elation, and also\nfor the shift that they report in the world's appearance. It may be\nthat, in some cases, whether by design or not, this bodily change is\nthe product of a spiritual discipline. So here is another way in which\nfeelings, including feelings of bodily condition, may be caught up\ninto the phenomenology of the religious or spiritual life. \nWe may wonder what phenomenological categories to use for the\ndescription of this sort of experience, whereby the world in general\nappears brighter and newly vivid. It may be that the category of\nsalience is, once again, of some help here. James notes how in the\nexperience of the depressed person, the world can appear\n“flat.” And this is what we should expect: in central\ncases, the person who is depressed is suffering from a lack of\nemotional engagement with the world, and in turn, therefore, from a\nblunted sense of the differentiated significance of things, so that\nthe patterns of salience that normally inform the perceptual field are\nflattened out. Hence James writes of Tolstoy's experience of a period\nof existential crisis that: “Life had been enchanting. It was\nnow flat sober, more than sober, dead.” (1902, p. 152) And\nspeaking more generally he comments that: \nHere again, we are concerned with a generalized shift in the\nappearance of the world, but in this example, the change is evidently\ninduced not simply by a change in bodily condition, though that may be\npart of the story, but by the person's new assessment of their\ncircumstances. This case too is religiously suggestive, since the\nreligions standardly offer, of course, far-reaching diagnoses of our\npresent circumstances and our prospects. So perhaps, in some cases,\nconversion experience is a matter of the person coming to subscribe to\na new conception of their circumstances, of this far-reaching variety,\nand acquiring thereby a new sense of their “background of\npossibilities,” with the result that their experience of the\neveryday world is then renewed. \nSo salience is one category that is relevant to the description of the\nchange in the appearance of the everyday world that is commonly\nassociated with conversion. In brief, before conversion, the world may\nappear relatively “flat,” and after it may be that objects\nare more clearly delineated relative to one another, so that they\nstand out in the perceptual field, where this standing out records the\nperson's new appreciation of their significance in themselves and\nrelative to one another. It it notable that James's converts seem to\nbe talking not only about a deepening of patterns of salience in the\nperceptual field, but also of the world appearing brighter or more\nvivid, where this change seems to imply a change in the\n“colouring,” and not simply in the structure, of the\nperceptual field. An example will help us to pin down this further\ndimension of the change that converts seem to be describing. \nSuppose that I am chewing some meat that, unknown to me, derives from\nShuttlecock, the pet rabbit. And suppose that I am now told that the\nmeat does indeed derive from Shuttlecock. In these circumstances\n– granted standard assumptions – the meat will, of course,\nbecome newly salient for me: I will now be focally aware of it. But\nthat is not all that will happen. The meat will also change in its\nintrinsic phenomenal feel: it will now be experienced as disgusting.\nWe can call this second element of the change in the appearance of the\nmeat a change in “hue.” Commonly, changes in salience and\nin hue will arise together: if an object acquires a new hue, for\nexample, then it is natural to suppose that it will stand out relative\nto other objects in a new way. But as the example of Shuttlecock\nindicates, these changes are conceptually distinguishable. And we\nmight suppose, then, that James's converts are reporting not only a\nchange in salience, but also a change in hue: the perceptual field is\nnow more boldly contoured, and it is at the same time brighter or more\nvivid than before conversion. \nSo far in this section, we have been interested in the correlation\nbetween mundane experience and religious teaching, where this\ncorrelation is “external”: that is, it is a matter of the\ndoctrine upholding some idea about the nature of the world – for\ninstance, the idea that the world as created is good – and the\nappearance of the world then conforming to that idea, by virtue of,\nsay, the patterns of salience that are inscribed in the perceptual\nfield, and the colouring or “hue” of the world as\nexperienced. And as we have seen, we can understand these shifts in\nthe appearance of the world as, fundamentally, the product of changes\nin bodily condition, or as shaped by way of religious teaching about\nhuman beings' “background of possibilities.” But another\ncase is also possible: here, the religious teaching enters into the\nappearance of the world. Something like this case is perhaps implied\nin Jonathan Edwards' report of his religious conversion, which is also\nrecorded by William James. Edwards writes: \nIn this report, it is not simply that things look different following,\nor in the course of, conversion, but the divine nature is now somehow\nmade manifest in the appearance of the world. This sort of report at\nleast raises the possibility, however puzzling it may be, that\nconcepts of the divine can enter into our experience of the world, so\nthat the content of the concept comes to be embodied in the world as\nit appears. A related case is reported by Roger Scruton when he\nrepresents the intentions of the designers of the Gothic church in\nthese terms: \nHere, the concept of the heavenly city has a phenomenal counterpart in\nthe appearance of the Gothic church, once the perceptual field has\nbeen appropriately organised. We could put the point by saying that\nthe concept of the heavenly city can be inscribed in the perceptual\nfield, so that the Gothic church comes to present an image of that\ncity, by virtue of appearing as an “assembled” entity,\nrather than as a single thing divided. As Scruton notes, this is not a\nquestion of the idea of the heavenly city being used to interpret the\nappearances; the connection is more integral than that: the\nappearances themselves take on a certain character once they are\nordered according to that idea. Perhaps, similarly, it is possible for\na particular concept of God to be inscribed in the perceptual field,\nso that the sensory world in some relevant respect comes to image God?\nSomething like this possibility seems to be implied in Edwards'\naccount of his conversion experience, where the world – the sun\nand stars, trees and flowers – is said to body forth the various\ndivine attributes. Edwards' insistent use of the words\n“appear” and “appearance” in his report\nindicates that his intention is to communicate the phenomenology of\nhis experience, where that phenomenology is one of the divine nature\nbeing manifest in the world. \nOf course, the case of the Gothic church may seem relatively\nstraightforward, and rather unrepresentative of religious thought more\ngenerally. For, here, we are dealing with the capacity of one\nspatio-temporal entity (the Gothic church) to image another (the\nheavenly city), and it is only to be expected that one such entity can\nimage another once its appearance is structured appropriately.\n(Compare the capacity of small children to take clouds as images of\njust about anything, once the relevant isomorphism has been\nintroduced.) But if a religious thought concerns, say, the divine\nnature, then it is not of a spatio-temporal entity, and in this case,\ntherefore, it is harder to see how the appearance of the world might\npresent an image of the content of the thought. It may be that another\nof Scruton's examples bears on this issue. In the following passage,\nhe is considering the capacity of a cloister to represent an ideal of\nlife. He writes: \nThis case is rather different from the example of the Gothic church.\nHere, what we “see” in the building is not a\nspatio-temporal entity (the heavenly city) but an ideal of life. Of\ncourse, it is true that it was the monks' leading of that life that\naccounts for the construction of the building; but Scruton is clear\nthat the association here, between the way of life and the character\nof the building, is not just causal: when the cloister is viewed in\nthe right way, that way of life enters into its appearance. In general\nterms, it seems clear enough how, on Scruton's account, this is\nsupposed to happen: what is required is that when we view the\nbuilding, we hold in tension the “energy” and\n“abundant observation” of the columns, arcade and other\nfeatures of the structure, on the one side, and the impression of\n“restfulness” and measure that is communicated by the\noverall design of the cloister, on the other. When we allow these two\nimpressions of the building to coexist in our perception of it, then\nthe building can image the relevant ideal of life. Here again, what is\nneeded, presumably, is that we order the scene according to the\nappropriate pattern of salience. But this is, it seems, a relatively\ncomplex example of salient viewing, since it requires one set of\nqualities, identified in one instance of salient viewing, to be laid\nalongside another, identified in another instance of salient viewing,\nwithin a single, cohesive act of perception. \nThis case is closer to the experience that Edwards reports than is the\nexample of the heavenly city, and it suggests one way of making sense\nof his account. Perhaps just as the ideal of life, and the associated\nvirtues, of the monks can be imaged in the cloister, so the divine\ncharacter, and the divine “virtues,” can be imaged in the\nworld, once it is viewed aright. If so, that would be a significant\ntruth: for in that case, we would be able to reckon with various\nconceptions of the divine nature not only abstractly, but also in\nsensory terms, in so far as those conceptions can be used to order the\nappearance of the everyday world, so that the relevant understanding\nof God comes to be imaged by the world as experienced. And if this is\nso, then we have reason to think that the goods of the spiritual life\nare not only behavioural, intellectual, emotional and attitudinal, as\nwidely supposed, but also perceptual. (For further discussion, see\nWynn 2013.) On this view, the way the sensory world appears can be\ndeemed more or less appropriate relative to various truths concerning\nthe divine nature; and accordingly, some ways in which the world\nappears may turn out to realize significant spiritual goods. \nWe have been examining some of the ways in which the phenomenology of\nhuman experience may be relevant to the content of religious belief\n(e.g., to a religiously resonant understanding of divine presence) and\nto its epistemic standing (e.g., to the intentionality of religious\nexperience). When such considerations are squeezed out of an account\nof the religious or spiritual life, that is likely to be because of a\npreference for doctrine or practice as the central category in terms\nof which religion is to be understood. So we can think of two\ncorrelative challenges for any approach that makes some appeal to\nphenomenology: perhaps such an account fails to reckon with the\ndoctrinal content of religious belief, and perhaps it overlooks the\nrole of practice in defining religious traditions. \nThe first objection makes most sense if we are working with a\nrelatively simple distinction between doctrines (creedal items derived\nfrom, say, the Bible or later theological reflection) and experience.\nBut as we have seen, doctrine and experience are likely to be mutually\ninforming, and it is reasonable to suppose that in some cases\nreligious understanding involves a kind of amalgam of doctrinal scheme\nand body of experience, where these elements cannot in any simple way\nbe separated out. \nNewman makes a related point when he distinguishes a\n“notion” from a “real image” of God (1979, p.\n108). A notion of God is an abstract conception of God, while a real\nimage of God, he tends to think, presupposes the notion, but deepens\nit by way of affectively toned, first hand experience of God. So for\nexample, to have encountered God in the call of conscience, in the\nexperience of remorse, is thereby to have a new understanding of the\nsense in which God is properly called judge, although the additional\nincrement of understanding may not be readily verbalisable. (Compare\nGoldie on our knowledge of the dangerousness of ice.) \nOther commentators have thought that phenomenological treatments of\nreligion risk overlooking the central role of practices in\nconstituting religious traditions. For example, in his study Beyond\nPhenomenology, Gavin Flood remarks that: “It is ritual\nstructures and performed narratives which have primacy in the\ntransmission of traditions through the generations and not any\nindividual experience or state of consciousness” (1999, p. 107).\nAgain, as with doctrine, so here we might wish to avoid any overly\nsharp disjunction of phenomenology and practice. \nThis point can be made particularly succinctly by considering again\nthe case of emotional feelings. Such feelings involve patterns of\nsalient viewing, we have seen; but they can also be connected to the\nposture of the body. For example, in standard cases, to feel fear is\nin part to register the tensing of the body, and in turn therefore its\ntaking stock of a particular environment, and its making ready to act\nin that environment (Solomon 2003 and Pickard 2003). So the\nintellectual content of an emotional feeling, concerning what is\ndeserving of attention in a given context of choice, is we might\nsuppose realised both in a correlative structuring of the perceptual\nfield, and in a kinaesthetic appreciation of the body's readiness to\nact in that context. \nDepending on the details of the case, we might want to see the\nexpressive posture of the body as coming first, and giving rise to a\ncertain ordering of the perceptual field, or vice versa. But, here, we\nseem to have two ways of grasping a certain content; and these two\nways seem to be held together by the relevant emotional feeling, since\nsuch feelings are realised both in a certain pattern of salient\nviewing and in the feeling of a correlative posture of the body. \nSo here “practice,” or the readiness of the body to act in\ncertain ways in the world, is not straightforwardly separable from\n“doctrine” (a conceptually organised appreciation of the\nworld) or emotional feeling. Instead these three make up a unitary\nstate of mind. And similarly, we might suppose, certain religious\npractices are reciprocally implicated in correlative ways of seeing,\nand in turn in correlative doctrines, in ways that resist any easy\ndisaggregation or prioritisation. Max Scheler makes something like\nthis point when he suggests that different postures of the body in\nprayer reciprocally define different conceptions of God (1960, p.\n266); and, once again, we might suppose that similar connections are\ndisplayed in the responses of the body on the approach to a sacred\nsite. \nTaking another route into these questions, we might think that\nprogress in the spiritual life can be described in terms of different\nvocabularies: sometimes, a religious tradition may use a relatively\nexperiential or phenomenological idiom to mark the distinction between\ndifferent phases of the spiritual life; sometimes, it may use a\nbehavioural idiom, by citing, for instance, the enacted example of the\nsaints; and sometimes it may use a more metaphysical idiom, by noting,\nsay, how the relationship between divine and human agency may take\ndifferent forms at different stages of the spiritual life.\nAccordingly, to take just one example, we might suppose that the\nchange that concerns Thomas Aquinas when he speaks of how the infused\nmoral virtues extend the acquired moral virtues must in some way\ncorrelate with the change that John of the Cross records when he\nspeaks of the descent into the “dark night,” and of the\ntransition from there into a renewed appreciation of the everyday\nsensory world. In this way, we can see phenomenological\ncharacterisations of the religious or spiritual life as integrally\nconnected to characterisations that make use of a more behavioural or\nmetaphysical vocabulary (Wynn 2017). \nIn sum, then, rather than giving precedence to doctrine- or\npractice-based accounts of religion, we might suppose that these\naccounts will themselves come fully into focus only when they are\ncombined with an appreciation of the phenomenology of religion.","contact.mail":"m.wynn@leeds.ac.uk","contact.domain":"leeds.ac.uk"}]
