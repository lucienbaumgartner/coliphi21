For them a\nmuthos was a true story, a story that unveils the true origin\nof the world and human beings. For us a myth is something to be\n“debunked”: a widespread, popular belief that is in fact\nfalse. In archaic Greece the memorable was transmitted orally through\npoetry, which often relied on myth. However, starting with the\nbeginning of the seventh century BC two types of discourse emerged\nthat were set in opposition to poetry: history (as shaped by, most\nnotably, Thucydides) and philosophy (as shaped by the peri\nphuseōs tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries\nBC). These two types of discourse were naturalistic alternatives to\nthe poetic accounts of things. Plato broke to some extent from the\nphilosophical tradition of the sixth and fifth centuries in that he\nuses both traditional myths and myths he invents and gives them some\nrole to play in his philosophical endeavor. He thus seems to attempt\nto overcome the traditional opposition between muthos\nand logos.\n\n\n\nThere are many myths in Plato’s dialogues: traditional myths, which he\nsometimes modifies, as well as myths that he invents, although many of\nthese contain mythical elements from various traditions. Plato is both\na myth teller and a myth maker. In general, he uses myth to inculcate\nin his less philosophical readers noble beliefs and/or teach them\nvarious philosophical matters that may be too difficult for them to\nfollow if expounded in a blunt, philosophical discourse. More and more\nscholars have argued in recent years that in Plato myth and philosophy\nare tightly bound together, in spite of his occasional claim that they\nare opposed modes of discourse.\n\n\n\nFor whom did Plato write? Who was his readership? A very good survey\nof this topic is Yunis 2007 from which I would like to quote the\nfollowing illuminating passage: “before Plato, philosophers\ntreated arcane subjects in technical treatises that had no appeal\noutside small circles of experts. These writings, ‘on\nnature’, ‘on truth’, ‘on being’ and so\non, mostly in prose, some in verse, were demonstrative, not protreptic.\nPlato, on the other hand, broke away from the experts and sought to\ntreat ethical problems of universal relevance and to make philosophy\naccessible to the public” (13). Other scholars, such as Morgan\n(2003), have also argued that Plato addressed in his writings both\nphilosophical and non-philosophical audiences. \n\nIt is true that in the Republic Plato has the following\nadvice for philosophers: “like someone who takes refuge under a\nlittle wall from a storm of dust or hail driven by the wind, the\nphilosopher—seeing others filled with lawlessness—is\nsatisfied if he can somehow lead his present life free from injustice\nand impious acts and depart from it with good hope, blameless and\ncontent” (496d–e). He was certainly very bitter about\nSocrates’ fate. In his controversial interpretation Strauss (1964)\nargues that in Plato’s view the philosopher should stay\ndisconnected from society. This interpretation is too extreme. Plato\ndid not abandon Socrates’ credo, that the philosopher has a duty towards\nhis fellow-citizens who do not devote their lives to philosophy. For\nhim philosophy has a civic dimension. The one who makes it outside the\ncave should not forget about those who are still down there and believe\nthat the shadows they see there are real beings. The philosopher should\ntry to transmit his knowledge and his wisdom to the others, and he\nknows that he has a difficult mission. But Plato was not willing to go\nas far as Socrates did. He preferred to address the public at large\nthrough his written dialogues rather than conducting dialogues in the\nagora. He did not write abstruse philosophical treatises but engaging\nphilosophical dialogues meant to appeal to a less philosophically\ninclined audience. The dialogues are, most of the time, prefaced by a\nsort of mise en scène in which the reader learns who\nthe participants to the dialogue are, when, where and how they\npresently met, and what made them start their dialogue. The\nparticipants are historical and fictional characters. Whether\nhistorical or fictional, they meet in historical or plausible settings,\nand the prefatory mises en scène contain only some\nincidental anachronisms. Plato wanted his dialogues to look like\ngenuine, spontaneous dialogues accurately preserved. How much of these\nstories and dialogues is fictional? It is hard to tell, but he surely\ninvented a great deal of them. References to traditional myths and\nmythical characters occur throughout the dialogues. However, starting\nwith the Protagoras and Gorgias, which are usually\nregarded as the last of his early writings, Plato begins to season his\ndialogues with self-contained, fantastical narratives that we usually\nlabel his ‘myths’. His myths are meant, among other things,\nto make philosophy more accessible. \n\nThere are in Plato identifiable traditional myths, such as the story\nof Gyges (Republic 359d–360b), the myth of Phaethon\n(Timaeus 22c7) or that of the Amazons (Laws 804e4).\nSometimes he modifies them, to a greater or lesser extent, while other\ntimes he combines them—this is the case, for instance, of the\nNoble Lie (Republic 414b–415d), which is a combination\nof the Cadmeian myth of autochthony and the Hesiodic myth of\nages. There are also in Plato myths that are his own, such as the myth\nof Er (Republic 621b8) or the myth of Atlantis\n(Timaeus 26e4). Many of the myths Plato invented feature\ncharacters and motifs taken from traditional mythology (such as the\nIsles of the Blessed or the judgment after death), and sometimes it is\ndifficult to distinguish his own mythological motifs from the\ntraditional ones. The majority of the myths he invents preface or\nfollow a philosophical argument: the\nGorgias myth (523a–527a), the myth of the androgyne\n(Symposium 189d–193d), the Phaedo myth\n(107c–115a), the myth of Er (Republic 614a–621d),\nthe myth of the winged soul (Phaedrus 246a–249d), the\nmyth of Theuth (Phaedrus 274c–275e), the cosmological\nmyth of the Statesman (268–274e), the Atlantis myth\n(Timaeus 21e–26d, Critias), the Laws\nmyth (903b–905b). \n\nPlato refers sometimes to the myths he uses, whether traditional or\nhis own, as muthoi (for an overview of all the loci\nwhere the word muthos occurs in Plato see Brisson 1998\n(141ff.)). However, muthos is not an exclusive label. For\ninstance: the myth of Theuth in the Phaedrus (274c1) is called\nan akoē (a “thing heard”,\n“report”, “story”); the myth of Cronus is\ncalled a phēmē (“oracle”,\n“tradition”, “rumour”) in the Laws\n(713c2) and a muthos in the Statesman (272d5, 274e1,\n275b1); and the myth of Boreas at the beginning of the\nPhaedrus is called both muthologēma (229c5) and\nlogos (d2). \n\nThe myths Plato invents, as well as the traditional myths he uses, are\nnarratives that are non-falsifiable, for they depict particular\nbeings, deeds, places or events that are beyond our experience: the\ngods, the daemons, the heroes, the life of soul after death, the\ndistant past, etc. Myths are also fantastical, but they are not\ninherently irrational and they are not targeted at the irrational\nparts of the soul. Kahn (1996, 66–7) argues that between\nPlato’s “otherworldly vision” and “the values\nof Greek society in the fifth and fourth centuries BC” was a\n“radical discrepancy”. In that society, Plato’s\nmetaphysical vision seemed “almost grotesquely out of\nplace”. This discrepancy, claims Kahn, “is one explanation\nfor Plato’s use of myth: myth provides the necessary literary\ndistancing that permits Plato to articulate his\nout–of–place vision of meaning and truth.” \n\nThe Cave, the narrative that occurs in the Republic\n(514a–517a), is a fantastical story, but it does not deal\nexplicitly with the beyond (the distant past, life after death etc.),\nand is thus different from the traditional myths Plato uses and the\nmyths he invents. Strictly speaking, the Cave is an analogy, not a\nmyth. Also in the Republic, Socrates says that until\nphilosophers take control of a city “the politeia whose story we\nare telling in words (muthologein) will not achieve its\nfulfillment in practice” (501e2–5; translated by Rowe (1999,\n268)). The construction of the ideal city may be called a\n“myth” in the sense that it depicts an imaginary polis (cf.\n420c2: “We imagine the happy state”). In the\nPhaedrus (237a9, 241e8) the word muthos is used to\nname “the rhetorical exercise which Socrates carries out”\n(Brisson 1998, 144), but this seems to be a loose usage of the\nword. \n\nMost (2012) argues that there are eight main features of the Platonic\nmyth. (a) Myths are a monologue, which those listening do not\ninterrupt; (b) they are told by an older speaker to younger listeners;\n(c) they “go back to older, explicitly indicated or implied,\nreal or fictional oral sources” (17); (d) they cannot be\nempirically verified; (e) their authority derive from tradition, and\n“for this reason they are not subject to rational examination by\nthe audience” (18); (f) they have a psychologic effect:\npleasure, or a motivating impulse to perform an action “capable\nof surpassing any form of rational persuasion” (18); (g) they\nare descriptive or narrative; (h) they precede or follow a dialectical\nexposition. Most acknowledges that these eight features are not\ncompletely uncontroversial, and that there are occasional exceptions;\nbut applied flexibly, they allow us to establish a corpus of at least\nfourteen Platonic myths in the Phaedo, Gorgias,\nProtagoras, Meno, Phaedrus,\nSymposium, Republic X, Statesman,\nTimaeus, Critias and Laws IV. The first\nseven features “are thoroughly typical of the traditional myths\nwhich were found in the oral culture of ancient Greece and which Plato\nhimself often describes and indeed vigorously criticizes”\n(19). \n\nDorion (2012) argues that the Oracle story in Plato’s Apology\nhas all these eight features of the Platonic myth discussed by Most\n(2012). Dorion concludes that the Oracle story is not only a Platonic\nfiction, but also a Platonic myth, more specifically: a myth of\norigin. Who invented the examination of the opinions of others by the\nmeans of elenchus? Aristotle (see Sophistical\nRefutations 172a30–35 and Rhetoric 1354a3–7) thought\nthat the practice of refutation is, as Dorion puts it, “lost in\nthe mists of time and that it is hence vain to seek an exact origin of\nit” (433). Plato, however, attempts to convince us that the\ndialectical elenchus “were a form of argumentation that\nSocrates began to practice spontaneously as soon as he learned of the\nOracle” (433); thus, Plato confers to it a divine origin; in the\nCharmides he does the same when he makes Socrates say that he\nlearned an incantation (a metaphor for the elenchus) from\nZalmoxis; see also the Philebus 16c (on\nSocrates mythologikos see also Miller (2011)). \n\nWe have a comprehensive book about the people of Plato: Nails (2002);\nnow we also have one about the animals of Plato: Bell and Naas\n(2015). Anyone interested in myth, metaphor, and on how people and\nanimals are intertwined in Plato would be rewarded by consulting\nit. Here is a quotation from the editors’ introduction,\n“Plato’s Menagerie”: “Animal images, examples,\nanalogies, myths, or fables are used in almost every one of\nPlato’s dialogues to help characterize, delimit, and define many\nof the dialogues’ most important figures and themes. They are used to\nportray not just Socrates [compared to a gadfly, horse, swan, snake,\nstork, fawn, and torpedo ray] but many other characters in the\ndialogues, from the wolfish Thrasymachus of the Republic to\nthe venerable racehorse Parmenides of the Parmenides. Even\nmore, animals are used throughout the dialogues to develop some of\nPlato’s most important political or philosophical ideas. […] By\nour reckoning, there is but a single dialogue (the Crito)\nthat does not contain any obvious reference to animals, while most\ndialogues have many. What is more, throughout Plato’s dialogues\nthe activity or enterprise of philosophy itself is often compared to a\nhunt, where the interlocutors are the hunters and the object of the\ndialogue’s search—ideas of justice, beauty, courage, piety, or\nfriendship—their elusive animal prey” (Bell and Naas\n(2015, 1–2)). \n\nFor Plato we should live according to what reason is able to deduce\nfrom what we regard as reliable evidence. This is what real\nphilosophers, like Socrates, do. But the non-philosophers are reluctant\nto ground their lives on logic and arguments. They have to be\npersuaded. One means of persuasion is myth. Myth inculcates beliefs. It\nis efficient in making the less philosophically inclined, as well as\nchildren (cf. Republic 377a ff.), believe noble things. \n\nIn the Republic the Noble Lie is supposed to make the\ncitizens of Callipolis care more for their city. Schofield (2009)\nargues that the guards, having to do philosophy from their youth, may\neventually find philosophizing “more attractive than doing their\npatriotic duty” (115). Philosophy, claims Schofield, provides the\nguards with knowledge, not with love and devotion for their city. The\nNoble Lie is supposed to engender in them devotion for their city and\ninstill in them the belief that they should “invest their best\nenergies into promoting what they judge to be the city’s best\ninterests” (113). The preambles to a number of laws in the\nLaws that are meant to be taken as exhortations to the laws in\nquestion and that contain elements of traditional mythology (see 790c3,\n812a2, 841c6) may also be taken as “noble lies”. \n\nPlato’s eschatological myths are not complete lies. There is\nsome truth in them. In the Phaedo the statement “The\nsoul is immortal” is presented as following logically from\nvarious premises Socrates and his interlocutors consider acceptable\n(cf. 106b–107a). After the final argument for immortality\n(102a–107b), Cebes admits that he has no further objections to,\nnor doubts about, Socrates’ arguments. But Simmias confesses\nthat he still retains some doubt (107a–b), and then Socrates\ntells them an eschatological myth. The myth does not provide evidence\nthat the soul is immortal. It assumes that the soul is immortal and so\nit may be said that it is not entirely false. The myth also claims\nthat there is justice in the afterlife and Socrates hopes that the\nmyth will convince one to believe that the soul is immortal and that\nthere is justice in the afterlife. “I think”, says\nSocrates, that “it is fitting for a man to risk the\nbelief—for the risk is a noble one—that this, or something\nlike this, is true about our souls and their dwelling places”\n(114d–e). (Edmonds (2004) offers a interesting analysis of the\nfinal myth of Phaedo, Aristophanes’ Frogs and the\nfunerary gold leaves, or “tablets”, that have been found\nin Greek tombs). At the end of the myth of Er (the eschatological myth\nof the Republic) Socrates says that the myth “would\nsave us, if we were persuaded by it” (621b). Myth represents a\nsort of back-up: if one fails to be persuaded by arguments to change\none’s life, one may still be persuaded by a good myth. Myth, as\nit is claimed in the Laws, may be needed to\n“charm” one “into agreement” (903b) when\nphilosophy fails to do so. \n\nSedley (2009) argues that the eschatological myth of the\nGorgias is best taken as an allegory of “moral malaise\nand reform in our present life” (68) and Halliwell (2007) that\nthe myth of Er may be read as an allegory of life in this\nworld. Gonzales (2012) claims that the myth of Er offers a\n“spectacle [that] is, in the words of the myth itself, pitiful,\ncomic and bewildering” (259). Thus, he argues, “what\ngenerally characterizes human life according to the myth is a\nfundamental opacity” (272); which means that the myth\nis not actually a dramatization of the philosophical reasoning that\nunfolds in the Republic, as one might have expected, but of\neverything that “such reasoning cannot penetrate and master,\neverything that stubbornly remains dark and irrational: embodiment,\nchance, character, carelessness, and forgetfulness, as well as the\ninherent complexity and diversity of the factors that define a life\nand that must be balanced in order to achieve a good life”\n(272). The myth blurs the boundary between this world and the other.\nTo believe that soul is immortal and that we should practice justice\nin all circumstances, Gonzales argues, we have to be persuaded by what\nSocrates says, not by the myth of Er. Unlike the eschatological myths\nof the Gorgias and Phaedo, the final myth of the\nRepublic illustrates rather “everything in this world\nthat opposes the realization of the philosophical ideal. If the other\nmyths offer the philosopher a form of escapism, the myth of Er is his\nnightmare” (277, n. 36). \n\nThe philosopher should share his philosophy with others. But since\nothers may sometimes not follow his arguments, Plato is ready to\nprovide whatever it takes—an image, a simile, or a\nmyth—that will help them grasp what the argument failed to tell\nthem. The myth—just like an image, or analogy—may be a good\nteaching tool. Myth can embody in its narrative an abstract\nphilosophical doctrine. In the Phaedo, Plato develops the\nso-called theory of recollection (72e–78b). The theory is there\nexpounded in rather abstract terms. The eschatological myth of the\nPhaedo depicts the fate of souls in the other world, but it\ndoes not “dramatize” the theory of recollection. The\nPhaedrus myth of the winged soul, however, does. In it we are\ntold how the soul travels in the heavens before reincarnation, attempts\nto gaze on true reality, forgets what it saw in the heavens once\nreincarnated, and then recalls the eternal forms it saw in the heavens\nwhen looking at their perceptible embodiments. The Phaedrus\nmyth does not provide any proofs or evidence to support the theory of\nrecollection. It simply assumes this theory to be true and provides\n(among other things) an “adaptation” of it. Since this\ntheory the myth embodies is, for Plato, true, the myth has (pace Plato)\na measure of truth in it, although its many fantastical details may\nlead one astray if taken literally. Among other things, the fantastical\nnarrative of the myth helps the less philosophically inclined grasp the\nmain point of Plato’s theory of recollection, namely that\n“knowledge is recollection”. \n\nThe cosmology of the Timaeus is a complex and ample\nconstruction, involving a divine maker (assisted by a group of less\npowerful gods), who creates the cosmos out of a given material\n(dominated by an inner impulse towards disorder) and according to an\nintelligible model. The cosmology as a whole is called both an\neikōs muthos (29d, 59c, 68d) and an eikōs\nlogos (30b, 48d, 53d, 55d, 56a, 57d, 90e). The expression\neikōs muthos has been translated as ‘probable\ntale’ (Jowett), ‘likely story’ (Cornford),\n‘likely tale’ (Zeyl). The standard interpretation is\npromoted by, among others, Cornford (1937, 31ff.). The Timaeus\ncosmology, Cornford argues, is a muthos because it is cast in\nthe form of a narration, not as a piece-by-piece analysis. But also,\nand mainly, because its object, namely the universe, is always in a\nprocess of becoming and cannot be really known. Brisson (1998, ch. 13)\noffers a different solution, but along the same lines. The cosmology,\nBrisson argues, is a non-verifiable discourse about the perceptible\nuniverse before and during its creation. In other words: the cosmology\nis an eikōs muthos because it is about what happens to an\neikōn before, and during, its creation, when everything\nis so fluid that it cannot be really known. The standard alternative is\nto say that the problem lies in the cosmologist, not in the object of\nhis cosmology. It is not that the universe is so unstable so that it\ncannot be really known. It is that we fail to provide an exact and\nconsistent description of it. A proponent of this view is Taylor (1928,\n59). Rowe (2003) has argued that the emphasis at 29d2 is on the word\neikōs, not muthos, and that here muthos\nis used primarily as a substitute for logos without its\ntypical opposition to that term (a view also held by Vlastos (1939,\n380–3)). Burnyeat (2009) argues that this cosmology is an attempt to\ndisclose the rationality of the cosmos, namely the Demiurge’s\nreasons for making it thus and so. The word eikōs (a\nparticipial form of the verb eoika, “to be like”)\nis, argues Burnyeat, usually translated as “probable”;\nbut—as textual evidence from Homer to Plato proves—it also\nmeans “appropriate”, “fitting”,\n“fair”, “natural”, “reasonable”.\nSince the cosmology reveals what is reasonable in the\neikōn made by the Demiurge, it may rightly be called\neikōs, “reasonable”. The Demiurge’s\nreasoning, however, is practical, not theoretical. The Demiurge,\nBurnyeat claims, works with given materials, and when he creates the\ncosmos, he does not have a free choice, but has to adjust his plans to\nthem. Although we know that the Demiurge is supremely benevolent\ntowards his creation, none of us could be certain of his practical\nreasons for framing the cosmos the way he did. That is why anyone\naiming at disclosing them cannot but come up with\n“probable” answers. Plato’s cosmology is then\neikōs in the two senses of the word, for it is both\n“reasonable” and “probable”. But why does Plato\ncall it a muthos? Because, Burnyeat argues, the\nTimaeus cosmology is also a theogony (for the created cosmos\nis for Plato a god), and this shows Plato’s intention to overcome\nthe traditional opposition between muthos and\nlogos. \n\nTimaeus speaks about the Demiurge’s practical reasoning for\ncreating the cosmos as he did. No cosmologist can deduce these reasons\nfrom various premises commonly accepted. He has to imagine them, but\nthey are neither fantastical, nor sophistic. The cosmologist exercises\nhis imagination under some constraints. He has to come up with\nreasonable and coherent conjectures. And in good Socratic and Platonic\ntradition, he has to test them with others. This is what Timaeus does.\nHe expounds his cosmology in front of other philosophers, whom he calls\nkritai, “judges” (29d1). They are highly skilled\nand experienced philosophers: Socrates, Critias and Hermocrates and at\nthe beginning of the Critias, the sequel to the\nTimaeus, they express their admiration for Timaeus’\ncosmological account (107a). One may say that Timaeus’ account\nhas been peer-reviewed. The judges, however, says Plato, have to be\ntolerant, for in this field one cannot provide more than conjectures.\nTimaeus’ cosmological discourse is not aimed at persuading a less\nphilosophically inclined audience to change their lives. It may be\nargued that its creationist scenario was meant to make the difficult\ntopic of the genesis of the realm of becoming more accessible. In the\nPhilebus, in a tight dialectical conversation, the genesis of\nthe realm of becoming is explained in abstract terms (the unlimited,\nlimit, being that is mixed and generated out of those two; and the\ncause of this mixture and generation, 27b–c). But the\nTimaeus aims at encompassing more than the Philebus.\nIt aims not only at revealing the ultimate ontological principles\n(accessible to human reason, cf. 53d), and at explaining how their\ninteraction brings forth the world of becoming, but also at disclosing,\nwithin a teleological framework, the reasons for which the cosmos was\ncreated the way it is. These reasons are to be imagined because\nimagination has to fill in the gaps that reason leaves in this attempt\nto disclose the reasons for which the cosmos was created the way it\nis. \n\nIn the Protagoras (324d) a distinction is made between\nmuthos and logos, where muthos appears to\nrefer to a story and logos to an argument. This distinction\nseems to be echoed in the Theaetetus and the\nSophist. In the Theaetetus Socrates discusses\nProtagoras’ main doctrine and refers to it as “the\nmuthos of Protagoras” (164d9) (in the same line\nSocrates also calls Theaetetus’ defence of the identity of knowledge\nand perception a muthos). And later on, at 156c4, Socrates\ncalls a muthos the teaching according to which active and\npassive motions generate perception and perceived objects. In the\nSophist, the Visitor from Elea tells his interlocutors that\nXenophanes, Parmenides and other Eleatic, Ionian (Heraclitus included)\nand Sicilian philosophers “appear to me to tell us a myth, as if\nwe were children” (242c8; see also c–e). By calling all\nthose philosophical doctrines muthoi Plato does not claim\nthat they are myths proper, but that they are, or appear to be,\nnon-argumentative. In the Republic Plato is fairly hostile to\nparticular traditional myths (but he claims that there are two kinds\nof logoi, one true and the other false, and that\nthe muthoi we tell children “are false, on the whole,\nthough they have some truth in them”, 377a; for a discussion of\nallegory and myth in Plato’s Republic see Lear\n(2006)). Halliwell (2011) claims that Book X of the Republic\n“offers not a simple repudiation of the best poets but a\ncomplicated counterpoint in which resistance and attraction to their\nwork are intertwined, a counterpoint which (among other things)\nexplores the problem of whether, and in what sense, it might be\npossible to be a ‘philosophical lover’ of poetry”\n(244). \n\nIn many dialogues he condemns the use of images in knowing things and\nclaims that true philosophical knowledge should avoid images. He would\nhave had strong reasons for avoiding the use of myths: they are not\nargumentative and they are extremely visual (especially those he\ninvented, which contain so many visual details as if he would have\ngiven instructions to an illustrator). But he didn’t. He wanted\nto persuade and/or teach a wider audience, so he had to make a\ncompromise. Sometimes, however, he seems to interweave philosophy with\nmyth to a degree that was not required by persuading and/or teaching a\nnon-philosophical audience. The eschatological myths of\nthe Gorgias, Phaedo and Republic, for\ninstance, are tightly bound with the philosophical arguments of those\ndialogues (cf. Annas 1982); and the eschatological myth of the\nPhaedo “picks one by one the programmatic remarks about\nteleological science from earlier on in the dialogue, and sketches ways\nin which their proposals can be fulfilled” (Sedley 1990, 381).\nSome other times he uses myth as a supplement to philosophical\ndiscourse (cf. Kahn (2009) who argues that in the myth of the\nStatesman Plato makes a doctrinal contribution to his\npolitical philosophy; Naas (2018, Chapter 2) offers an interesting\ninterpretation of this myth, and (Chapter 3) discusses Michel\nFoucault’s reading of it)). One time, in the Timaeus, Plato\nappears to overcome the opposition between muthos and\nlogos: human reason has limits, and when it reaches them it\nhas to rely on myth (arguably, that also happen in\nthe Symposium; for a very close reading of how\nDiotima’s speech interacts with Aristophanes’ myth of the\nandrogyne see Hyland (2015)). \n\n“On the less radical version, the idea will be that\nthe telling of stories is a necessary adjunct to, or extension of,\nphilosophical argument, one which recognizes our human limitations,\nand—perhaps—the fact that our natures combine irrational\nelements with the rational” (Rowe 1999, 265). On a more radical\ninterpretation, “the distinction between ‘the\nphilosophical’ and ‘the mythical’ will—at one\nlevel—virtually disappear” (265). If we take into\naccount that Plato chose to express his thoughts through a narrative\nform, namely that of the dialogue (further enveloped in fictional\nmises en scène), we may say that the “use of a\nfictional narrative form (the dialogue) will mean that any conclusions\nreached, by whatever method (including ‘rational\nargument’), may themselves be treated as having the status of a\nkind of ‘myth’” (265). If so, “a sense of the\n‘fictionality’ of human utterance, as provisional,\ninadequate, and at best approximating to the truth, will infect\nPlatonic writing at its deepest level, below other and more ordinary\napplications of the distinction between mythical and nonmythical forms\nof discourse” (265); if so, it is not only “that\n‘myth’ will fill in the gaps that reason leaves (though it\nmight do that too, as well as serving special purposes for particular\naudiences), but that human reason itself ineradicably displays some of\nthe features we characteristically associate with story-telling”\n(265–6) (cf. also Fowler (2011, 64): “Just as the\nimmortal, purely rational soul is tainted by the irrational body,\nso logos is tainted by mythos”). It is\ndifficult to say which one of these two readings is a better\napproximation of what Plato thought about the interplay between myth\nand philosophy. The interpreter seems bound to furnish only probable\naccounts about this matter. \n\nFowler (2011) surveys the muthos–logos dichotomy from\nHerodotus and the pre–Socratic philosophers to Plato, the\nSophists, and the Hellenistic and Imperial writers, and provides many\nvaluable references to works dealing with the notion\nof muthos, the Archaic uses of myth– words,\nand ancient Greek mythology; for the muthos–logos\ndichotomy in Plato see also Miller (2011, 76–77). \n\nAristotle admits that the lover of myths is in a sense a lover of\nwisdom (Metaphysics 982b18; cf. also 995a4 and\n1074b1–10). He might have used a myth or two in his early\ndialogues, now lost. But in general he seems to have distanced himself\nfrom myth (cf. Metaphysics 1000a18–9). \n\nOn the philosophical use of myth before Plato there are a number of\ngood studies, notably Morgan 2000. There is, however, little on the\nphilosophical use of myth in the Platonist tradition. Of Plato’s\nimmediate successors in the Academy, Speusippus, Xenocrates and\nHeraclides of Pontus composed both dialogues and philosophical\ntreatises. But, with one exception, none of these seems to have used\nmyths as Plato did. The exception is Heraclides, who wrote various\ndialogues—such as On the Things in Hades,\nZoroastres and Abaris—involving mythical\nstories and mythical, or semi-mythical, figures. In the later Platonist\ntradition—with the exception of Cicero and Plutarch—there\nis not much evidence that Plato’s philosophical use of myths was\nan accepted practice. In the Neoplatonic tradition various Platonic\nmyths became the subject of elaborate allegorization. Porphyry,\nProclus, Damascius and Olympiodorus gave allegorical interpretations of\na number of Platonic myths, such as the Phaedo and\nGorgias eschatological myths, or the myth of Atlantis. \n\nPlato was a celebrated figure in the Renaissance but only a few\nillustrations of Platonic mythical motifs can be found. Perhaps\nPlato’s attitude to visual representation—claiming so often\nthat the highest philosophical knowledge is devoid of it, and attacking\npoets and artists in general more than once—inhibited and\ndiscouraged attempts to capture in painting, sculpture or prints, the\nmythical scenes Plato himself depicted so vividly in words. Perhaps\nartists simply felt themselves unequal to the task. McGrath (2009)\nreviews and analyzes the rare illustrations of Platonic mythical\nfigures and landscapes in Renaissance iconography: the androgyne of the\nSymposium, the charioteer of the Phaedrus, the\nCave, and the spindle of the universe handled by Necessity and\nthe Fates of the Republic.","contact.mail":"cdpartenie@politice.ro","contact.domain":"politice.ro"}]
