In his\nphilosophical writings Holbach developed a deterministic and\nmaterialistic metaphysics, which grounded his polemics against\norganized religion as well as his utilitarian ethical and political\ntheory. As a translator, Holbach made significant contributions to the\nEuropean Enlightenment in science and religion. He translated German\nworks on chemistry and geology into French, summarizing many of the\nGerman advances in these areas in his entries in Diderot’s\nEncyclopedia.  Holbach also translated important English works on\nreligion and political philosophy into French. Holbach remains best\nknown, however, for his role in Parisian society. The close circle of\nintellectuals that Holbach hosted and, in various ways, sponsored\nproduced the Encyclopedia and a number of revisionary religious,\nethical, and political works that contributed to the ideological basis\nfor the French Revolution. Despite the radical views of many members\nof his coterie, however, Holbach’s broader visiting guest list\nincluded many of the most prominent intellectual and political figures\nin Europe. His salon, then, was at once a shelter for radical thought\nand a hub of mainstream culture.\n\n\n\nHolbach was born in 1723 in Edesheim. He was raised in Paris,\nprincipally by his uncle, Franciscus Adam d’Holbach, and\nattended the University of Leiden from 1744 to 1748 or 1749. Holbach\nparticularly enjoyed the parties there. It is likely that, at least at\nfirst, the dinners Holbach gave in Paris were modelled on the parties\nhe attended at Leiden. In 1749, Holbach married his second cousin,\nBasile-Geneviève d’Aine. About 1753 or 1754 both his\nuncle, Franciscus, and his father in law died, leaving Holbach a\nconsiderable fortune.  \n\nHolbach used his great wealth to throw the dinner parties for which he\nis famous. He owned a house in Paris in rue Royale, Butte Saint-Roch,\nwhich, generally, had a guest list restricted to serious\nintellectuals, and a chateau at Grandval where, in addition to his\ncoterie, Holbach also hosted social friends and\nrelatives. Holbach’s coterie included intellectuals who,\nalthough their positions varied on many issues, shared at least a\nwillingness to entertain views that many would have thought too\nradical to be discussed in social settings. The coterie met from the\n1750s into the 1780s. The group evolved over time, but its core\nmembers, Alan Kors has argued, were Denis Diderot, the encyclopedist;\nthe diplomat and cultural critic Friedrich-Melchior Grimm; the\nnaturalist Charles-Georges Le Roy; the writer and critic\nJean-François Marmontel; the historian and priest abbé\nGuillame-Thomas-François Raynal; the doctor Augustin Roux; the\npoet and philosopher Jean-François de Saint-Lambert; the writer\nJean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard; the pamphleteer François-Jean,\nchevalier de Chastellux, the pamphleteer abbé André\nMorellet; and the philosopher Jacques-André Naigeon. Many of\nthese men were, like Holbach, avowed atheists and many also pushed\nradical, even revolutionary political agendas. So the general\ncharacter of his coterie might suggest that Holbach was a figure on\nthe fringe of Parisian society, a kind of eccentric parvenu with a\ntaste for scandal. \n\nHowever, Holbach managed, despite what one might expect, to keep his\ncoterie firmly in the mainstream of European society. French nobles,\nas well as ambassadors from countries across Europe—Denmark,\nEngland, Naples, Saxe-Gotha, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Wurtemburg, and\nSweden—attended his dinners. So did prominent intellectuals of\nall kinds, including, at different times and with different degrees of\nenthusiasm, the philosopher and novelist Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the\nmathematician Jean Le Rond d’Alembert, the historian Edward\nGibbon, the writer Horace Walpole, the chemist Joseph Priestley, the\nsocial critic Cesare Beccaria, the philosopher Nicolas-Antoine\nBoulanger, the statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin, the actor\nDavid Garrick, the philosopher Claude-Adrien Helvétius, the\nphilosopher David Hume, the economist Adam Smith, and the novelist\nLaurence Sterne. Holbach was known in France not primarily as a\npolitical radical but as le premier maître\nd’hôtel de la philosophie. Many in Paris coveted\ninvitations to rue Royale, and Holbach’s house was the first\nstop for many prominent international visitors. \n\nHolbach’s character must have been remarkable to have maintained\na salon in which the espousers of political and religious reform met\nso freely and so often with visitors who either cannot have been\naccustomed to such open dialogue or who were themselves parts of the\nestablishment under attack. Indeed Rousseau, who himself came to feel\nunwelcome by the coterie, nevertheless memorializes Holbach in La\nnouvelle Heloïse, as the paradoxical figure, Wolmar, an\natheist who nonetheless embodies all of the Christian virtues. In\naddition to his good character, Holbach’s generosity at table\n(his dinners and especially his wine were famously good) and in\nsupporting many of his acquaintances may explain his success at being\nboth a pillar and a critic of society. Perhaps, also, Holbach was not\nin the eyes of many of his contemporaries as clearly a radical as some\nother members of his coterie. He did publish some of the most\nnotorious works of the French Enlightenment, including Le\nChristianisme dévoilé (Christianity\nUnveiled),\nSystème de la nature (System of Nature) and\nLe Bon Sens (Common Sense). These books evoked long\nand heated responses from such notable figures as Voltaire, abbé\nBergier, and Frederick the Great; System of Nature and\nCommon Sense were condemned by the parliament of Paris and\npublicly burned. Holbach, however, was not in his own time as notorious\nas his books. He was careful always to publish anonymously, so that\nthose who did not know him or who did not care to think of him in that\nway, might have remained at least partially ignorant of his religious\nand political views. \n\nHolbach’s coterie met for thirty years, from the early 1750s until\nabout 1780. During that time his first wife died and he married her\nyounger sister, Charlotte Suzanne d’Aine, with whom he had four\nchildren. Holbach wrote prolifically throughout this time. According to\nVercruysse, Holbach authored or coauthored over fifty books and over\nfour hundred articles. He died in 1789. \n\nThe metaphysical position with which Holbach is most often associated\nis a negative one: atheism. Although indeed Holbach devotes the entire\nsecond volume of Système de la nature and all\nof Le Bon Sens to the defense of atheism and the criticism of\nparticular claims about God, his views do not hold great philosophical\ninterest. They emphasize well worn topics such as the problem of evil,\nthe impossibility of discussing intelligibly what is unknowable, the\nsuspect psychological origins of religious belief, and the confusion\nof traditional descriptions of God in terms that are simply the\nnegation of genuine descriptive terms: for example, to say that God is\ninfinite is just to deny that God is finite. None of these arguments\nis unique to Holbach or especially well presented by him. His positive\nmetaphysics, on the other hand, has been somewhat overshadowed by his\nlong and loud expressions of atheism, and it will be the focus of this\ndiscussion. \n\nHolbach takes nature to consist in matter and motion and nothing else.\nNature is known to us, when it can be known, as a sequence of causes\nand effects:  \n\nHolbach’s metaphysics, then, is mechanistic, in that any correct\nexplanation of an event will refer only to matter, motion, and the\nlaws which describe their combination. Holbach’s ambitious attempt to\ndraw from this sparse metaphysics answers to questions often thought\nto involve something more than this, his Système de la\nnature, is badly marred, in some places, by over-simplification\nand, in others, by dogmatism. Indeed Goethe in his memoirs\n(Dichtung und Wahrheit vol. 9, 490–492) credits the\naccount of nature in this work with forever turning him away from\nFrench philosophy. Nevertheless, Holbach’s metaphysics does form the\nbasis for his engaging religious, ethical, and political views, and it\ndoes so by means of an innovative recasting of a traditional account\nof the properties of matter.  \n\nHolbach’s account of matter may best be understood against the\nbackground of the Lockean account, which is more familiar and from\nwhich in large part it is developed. (Israel 2006 traces the sources\nof the views of Holbach and the coterie in detail.) On Locke’s\naccount of bodies (Book 2, Chapter 8 of his Essay), all\nbodies possess “real” or “primary” qualities\n(solidity, extension, figure, number, and motion). Real qualities are\nthose which are “inseparable” from the bodies\nthemselves. To take Locke’s example (Essay 2.8.9), a\ngrain of wheat will have solidity, extension, figure and so on when it\nis intact, and it will retain these properties whatever happens to\nit. Locke distinguishes primary qualities from powers in bodies to\nproduce sensations in observers, which he calls secondary\nqualities. Secondary qualities, for example, are color, sound, taste,\nand so on. Because he hesitates to call secondary qualities real\nqualities, it is clear that Locke takes them to have a metaphysical\nstatus different from that he gives primary qualities. \n\nThere may be several different ways of accounting for Locke’s\ndistinction between primary and secondary qualities. The important\naspect of the distinction for the present discussion is that on\nLocke’s view we ought always to explain a secondary quality in terms of\na primary quality by which it produces the relevant sensation in us.\nColors, sounds, smells and so on are on Locke’s account powers that a\nbody has as a result of its particular shape, motion, and so on which\nproduce the relevant sensations in observers: “[Secondary\nqualities] are only Powers to act differently upon other things, which\nPowers result from the different Modifications of those primary\nqualities” (Essay 2.8.23). For example, in arguing that some,\napparently more genuine properties of fire, such as heat, are really on\nthe same footing with qualities such as the tendency to melt wax that\nare more obviously relational, Locke holds that each of these qualities\nalike are powers that a body has in virtue of its primary qualities to\nproduce certain effects[my emphasis added]: “…the power in fire to\nproduce a new color, or consistency in wax or clay by its primary\nqualities is as much a quality in fire, as the power it has to\nproduce in me a new idea or sensation of warmth or burning”\n(Essay 2.8.10). For Locke, then, all bodies have primary\nqualities, and any secondary qualities that they have are to be\nunderstood in terms of the primary qualities that produce them. \n\nHolbach maintains something like Locke’s distinction between primary\nand secondary qualities, but he does not insist that the properties of\nbodies that Locke calls secondary qualities, are properties that bodies\npossess in virtue of particular primary qualities. Matter, for Holbach,\nis whatever makes up bodies and causes the sense impressions that we\nhave of them. Matter, in general, may be said to have properties in the\nsense that there are some properties that anything which is matter will\npossess. These properties are roughly the Lockean primary qualities\n(with the important exception of motion, of which more below). However,\nHolbach holds that matter is a class, rather than a particular thing,\nsince different objects may possess different properties as well: \n\nSo we may say that both a fire and a building have extent,\ndivisibility and so on, but that a building has some properties, such\nas grayness, that fire lacks and that fire has some properties, such as\nluminance, that the building lacks. It may be that some of the\nproperties that some but not all particular bodies have are to be\nunderstood in terms of primary qualities, but Holbach does not insist\non this point. The properties which Locke called secondary qualities\nare not distinguished from primary qualities by the fact that they are\nrightly understood in terms of them. Rather, the only distinction\nbetween these properties and primary qualities is that primary\nqualities are in all matter alike and secondary qualities are in only\nsome bodies. Of fire, for example, Holbach writes: \n\nFire, in other words, besides having figure, extension and the other\nproperties of matter in general, has also the “peculiar”\nproperties of heat and luminance. These further properties are,\nmetaphysically, no different from the properties common to all matter,\non Holbach’s view, and they belong to fire in just as basic and\njust as mysterious a way as its extent and figure.  \n\nHolbach’s choice of example reflects a likely familiarity with\ncriticisms of the Lockean basis for the distinction between primary and\nsecondary qualities found in the writings of Berkeley and Holbach’s\nfriend and correspondent, Hume. Both of these authors use the example\nof the feeling of pain in heat (Berkeley, Three Dialogues I;\nHume Treatise 1.4.4, 3) as a first step in demonstrating the\nmind-dependence of all properties of body alike and so of casting into\ndoubt any supposed difference in kind between primary and secondary\nqualities. \n\nHolbach’s recasting of the distinction between primary and secondary\nqualities in terms of properties that matter possesses universally and\nproperties that only some bodies possess helps him to avoid the\nBerkeleyan criticism of the distinction. Holbach never claims, as Locke\ndoes, that properties such as color and sound have a metaphysical\nstatus different from that of the primary qualities. Lockean secondary\nqualities are, for Holbach, basic, inexplicable qualities of matter on\na par with extension and solidity and distinguished from them only on\nthe grounds that they are possessed by some bodies and not others.\nBecause Holbach allows that some matter possesses qualities that other\nmatter does not possess, his notion of matter is more varied than\nLocke’s. For Locke, all matter is homogenous, in the sense that it\npossesses all of the primary qualities and no other real qualities\nbesides. For Holbach, matter is heterogenous. It is a \n\nThe heterogeneity of matter in Holbach’s metaphysics puts him at a\ndisadvantage to the traditional Lockean view, in a sense. Locke’s\naccount of matter, if true, is simpler and has great explanatory power:\nthe full panoply of sensations that we encounter are to be explained by\nan account of our sensory organs, a short list of primary qualities,\nand the laws which govern their interaction. Holbach, on the other\nhand, requires separate explanations for each perceived property. He\npromises an explanation of all phenomena in terms of matter and motion,\nbut delivers not even a framework for such an explanation. \n\nIn another sense, though, the heterogeneity of matter is helpful to\nHolbach’s project. Materialistic accounts of human nature are often\nthought to fail just because human beings seem to have properties, such\nas thought and freedom, that matter does not have. In making matter a\ngenus of varied beings, Holbach creates a view flexible enough to\naccommodate an account of human nature more robust than that of many\nother materialists: \n\nHolbach’s naturalism requires that human nature be understood in terms\nof laws and that human action be comprehended under universal\ndeterminism. But it allows that, in many ways, human beings may differ\nin kind from other bodies, even animals, and it allows that human\nbeings may have many properties, notably thought, that have\ntraditionally been denied to matter.  \n\nThe heterogeneity of matter in Holbach’s account contributes to the\nvagueness of that designation. Matter can to some extent be understood in\nthe ordinary sense of anything that has extention, figure, and so on.\nHowever, because matter also may or may not have any number of\nproperties not ordinarily understood to belong to matter, such as\nthought, it is not entirely clear what may not be matter. Motion is\nlikewise and for similar reasons a vague term in Holbach. Where matter\nis understood simply as extension and some other very simple\nproperties, motion may be thought of in similarly simple terms, as a\nvelocity, acceleration or, perhaps, as an impulse with a certain\ndirection. Once matter is thought of, after the manner of Holbach, as\nsomething with properties which are perhaps best not understood in\nspatial terms, its motion may be much more difficult to define.\nAlthough he sometimes speaks of matter and motion in narrower senses,\nHolbach’s tendency is simply to identify matter and motion with the\ngeneral terms cause and effect. Holbach typically identifies bodies\nwith causes and motions with effects, but he also allows that motions\nmay be causes: \n\nTo understand human beings and human society in terms of matter and\nmotion, then, is simply to understand them in terms of causes and\neffects. Holbach’s naturalism in ethics and political theory\nextends to a commitment to ground those disciplines in an account of\nhuman nature understood in terms of lawlike regularities, most\nimportantly, psychological laws. But Holbach is not a naturalist in\nthe stricter sense of attempting to understand human beings in terms\nof the same laws that explain the rest of nature. Determinism is\nuniversal, in Holbach’s view, but different sorts of bodies may\nhave peculiar properties that require peculiar explanations. Despite\nhis avowed materialism, Holbach does not demand the sorts of reductive\nexplanations of mental events that materialism might ordinarily seem\nto require.  \n\nHolbach’s ethics is naturalistic in the sense described. Like\nhis major influence in this area, Spinoza, he undertakes to explain\nhuman beings with the same clarity and rigor that others explain\ngeometry (Eléments de la morale universelle,\nPreface). The laws that Holbach depends upon in accounting for human\nnature are primarily psychological laws and may be peculiar to human\nbeings. For Holbach, like Spinoza and Hobbes, holds that each person\nseeks his own preservation (System of Nature, 40; cf,\nSpinoza’s Ethics IIIp9 and Hobbes’s De\nHomine, Chap. 11—Holbach’s is still the most widely\navailable French translation of the latter). As both of these authors\ndo, Holbach associates the ends of action also with happiness, so that\nhappiness and self-preservation are, in his ethics, generally speaking\nrelated, and an individual’s interest is understood by Holbach\nin terms of either (and where he distinguishes between them, both) of\nthese.  \n\nEthics on Holbach’s account, then, amounts to enlightened\nself-interest, vice to a failure to recognize the means to one’s\ninterest, and moral rules to hypothetical imperatives which dictate the\nmeans to happiness or self-preservation: \n\nBecause people desire what morality provides, they will as a matter of\ncourse be motivated to do what is moral, provided they know what that\nis. The ignorance that Holbach describes here, however, is what causes\npeople to fail to act rightly. So what ethics requires is an\ninvestigation into ignorance: In what respects are people ignorant?\nWhat are the most dangerous forms of ignorance? How is ignorance to be\novercome?  \n\nOne of the most dangerous kinds of ignorance, on Holbach’s analysis,\nis an ignorance of nature and, in particular, of the causes of good and\nevil in it. Like Spinoza, Holbach argues that we tend to personify\nnature, projecting our interests and purposes onto matter that is, in\nfact, different from us (System of Nature, App. 17; cf,\nSpinoza’s Ethics I, App.). This produces, on Holbach’s\naccount, the belief in God and other religious beliefs (such as the\nbelief in heaven and hell and immortality) which in turn cause us to\npursue self-preservation in misguided ways: \n\nHolbach was notorious in the 18th century for his atheism and for his\ncriticisms of Christianity. Indeed today these topics most frequently\nengage philosophers and historians who study Holbach (see Kors 2005\nand Fonnesu 2006, for example), and Holbach continues to be a hero of\ndefenders of atheism, including the popular philosopher Michel\nOnfrey. There is no doubt that a great deal of what Holbach wrote was\ninflammatory and intended to be so. However, the fact that at least\nsome of his polemics, furious though they may have been, arose in the\ncontext of developing an account of virtue should mitigate the\nimpression of Holbach as a purely destructive thinker or (merely) a\nlover of scandal. His criticism of religion, and of Catholicism in\nparticular, is founded at least in part in the conviction that\nreligion is the source of vice and unhappiness and that virtue can\nonly be fostered in people who seek to preserve themselves in the world\nof their immediate acquaintance: \n\nHolbach’s ethics, as Rousseau recognized, is not nearly as\nrevisionary as his theology. As this passage makes clear, his\nconception of human virtue is quite traditional. Preservation and\nhappiness, as Holbach conceives them, involve most of the same\npractices that the religious views Holbach denounces require for\neternal preservation and felicity. Perhaps the principal practical\ndifference between morality as Holbach conceives it and the Christian\nmorality as Holbach understands it lies in the self-abnegation Holbach\nfinds valued in Christian morality. For Holbach, temperance, moderation\nand so on are virtues that one acquires out of a love for pleasure and\nlife. On the other hand, he takes these virtues, as they are understood\ntraditionally, to involve an unhealthy denial of one’s love for wine,\nfood and other familiar pleasures. Temperance and moderation, for\nHolbach are the best means to the enjoyment of wine and food, whereas\nin the views he criticizes they are virtues by which we deny the value\nof such enjoyment. \n\nHolbach’s political theory, which he developed for the most part after\nhis metaphysics and ethics, extends his ethical views to the state.\nHaving described human interest as happiness and preservation in the\nSystem of Nature and Common Sense in 1770 and 1772,\nHolbach went on to develop a notion of the just state or, to use his\nown term, “ethocracy,” founded for the purposes of securing the general\nwelfare. This theory is presented in several works published during the\n1770s, La politique naturelle (Natural Politics,\n1773), Système social (The Social System,\n1773), La morale universelle (Universal Morality,\n1776), and Ethocratie (Ethocracy, 1776). Holbach’s\nfoundational view is that the most valuable thing a person seeking\nself-preservation can do is to unite with another person: “Man is of\nall beings the most necessary to man” (Système social,\n76; cf. Spinoza’s Ethics IVP35C1, C2, and S). Society, when it\nis just, unites for the common purpose of preservation and the securing\nof welfare, and society contracts with government for this purpose.  \n\nHolbach’s theory of social contract has two stages. The first is\nsocial. When individuals realize that others are the greatest helps to\ntheir own welfare, they make a pact with one another, uniting in order\nto obtain personal and proprietary security and other benefits of\nsociety (Universal Morality 1.86; Politique\nNaturelle, 1.1). To strike such a pact is part of each person’s\nreason: \n\nThis social contract, the contract between individuals in society, is\nnever broken.  \n\nThe second stage of the social contract is more narrowly political.\nIt is a contract that society, in order to secure the general welfare,\nstrikes with a sovereign power, usually understood by Holbach to be a\nking limited, or at least informed by, a body of elected\nrepresentatives (La politique naturelle 3.17). This second\nsocial contract for Holbach, as for Locke, may be broken. Holbach is a\nthoroughgoing utilitarian: where the government fails to secure the\ngeneral welfare, which consists principally in securing property and\nbasic freedoms such as the freedoms of speech and religion, society has\na right to revolution (La politique naturelle, 4.5). \n\nPerhaps because of the less cautious advocacy of right to revolution\namong other members of his coterie, particularly Naigeon, or perhaps\nbecause he criticized the kings of his time so fiercely, Holbach is\nsometimes regarded as an advocate of revolution. Holbach’s\ndiscussion is tentative, however. He describes the right in La\npolitique naturelle (4.5 ff.) as a product of the natural\ninstinct for self-preservation. Like Hobbes (Leviathan, XXIX,\n23), Holbach expects that obedience to a sovereign will break down\nwhere individuals feel the need to secure their own lives. This is\nalso why sovereigns need to take care to look after citizens’\nwelfare and education. Where they fail to do these things, citizens\ncome to be ruled not by reason but by passion, and revolution\nresults. Holbach’s right to revolution, then, is less an\nadvocacy of revolution than a warning to avoid the conditions that\nlead to it.","contact.mail":"michael.lebuffe@otago.ac.nz","contact.domain":"otago.ac.nz"}]
