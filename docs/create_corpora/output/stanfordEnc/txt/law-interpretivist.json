Its core claim is that the way in which institutional\npractice affects the law is determined by certain principles that\nexplain why the practice should have that role. Interpretation of the\npractice purports to identify the principles in question and thereby\nthe normative impact of the practice on citizens’ rights and\nresponsibilities.\n\n\n\nInterpretivism is famously associated with Ronald Dworkin, who\ndeveloped the position in a number of publications spanning 45 years\n(see the works of Dworkin cited in the Bibliography). Dworkin’s\nwritings have stimulated a great deal of debate (the following are\nsome examples from the vast secondary literature: Mitchell 1983; Cohen\n1984; Hart 1994 (Postscript); Raz 1972, 1986, 1994: Chapters 10 and\n13, 2001; Finnis 1992; Coleman 2001b; Brink 2001; Burley\n2004; Hershovitz\n2006a; Ripstein 2007; Shapiro 2007; Smith 2010; Gardner 2012; Greenberg 2014; Hershovitz 2015). In this entry, we shall focus on the explanation\nof the position that was developed and defended by Dworkin (though not\nnecessarily on his way of presenting or defending it).\n\n\n\nInterpretivism is a thesis about the fundamental or constitutive\nexplanation of legal rights and obligations (powers, privileges, and\nrelated notions) or, for short, about the grounds of law. In\nthe relevant sense, some fact grounds another when the latter obtains\nin virtue of the former; and the relation between the two facts is\nexplanatory in a non-causal, metaphysical sense of constitutive\ndetermination. (See Fine 2012 and other essays in Correia and\nSchnieder 2012). Consider the fact that, if you buy a mobile phone at\na store in London and it turns out to be defective, you have a right,\nwhich is enforceable through the courts, to have it replaced or\nrepaired by the seller, provided the defect existed when the phone was delivered and became apparent not later than two years from delivery. In virtue of what does the right obtain? What\nmakes it the case, more abstractly, that any legal right or obligation\nobtains?  What makes the proposition that some right or obligation\nexists true, if it is true? (Dworkin 1986; Stavropoulos 2017.)  What sorts of nonlegal\nfacts do legal rights and obligations depend upon in this fundamental\nway, and what is the character of the relation of dependence that\nholds between legal rights and obligations and the nonlegal facts in\nvirtue of which they obtain?  What is the order in which the relevant\nfactors appear within the fundamental explanation? \n\nLegal rights and obligations vary when certain institutional and other nonmoral social facts vary; and cannot vary as long as such facts remain the same. The class of relevant facts most prominently includes institutional practice, the actions or practices of political institutions and ultimately the actions and psychology of the agents that operate within such institutions. You came to have the right to have the defective phone replaced or repaired by the seller and under the conditions mentioned when certain facts of this kind obtained: most directly, when the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted a certain Directive and the UK Parliament adapted its own legislation to give effect to it. You did’t have that specific right under the specific conditions before these actions were taken, and there is no guarantee you will retain the right now that the UK has completed its withdrawal from the EU and may take unilateral action to modify or abolish it. You couldn’t have come to have the right or, once you did, to lose it, unless some facts of that character obtained. Your right is therefore contingent upon and varies with the actions and practices of political institutions. The task for theories of law is to offer an account of legal rights and obligations that explains these relations. Legal positivism is an account of legal rights and obligations that appeals, at the fundamental level, exclusively to institutional and other nonmoral social considerations. Interpretivism is a kind of natural law or “nonpositivist” theory since it claims that, in addition to institutional practice (and perhaps other nonmoral social factors), certain moral facts necessarily play some role in the explanation. It makes a number of related distinctive claims within that approach. \n\nFirst, interpretivism says that the explanation of rights and\nobligations in which both moral principles and institutional practice\nplay some role is a kind of interpretation.  Interpretation\nin the relevant sense is the study of normatively significant objects\nor of the actions of producing such objects and the practices within\nsuch production takes place. It is a familiar point from literary and\nother kinds of interpretation in the arts that an interpretation may\nimpute to its object a certain content that consists in or reflects\nits normative significance or impact, without thereby imputing the\ncontent to the psychology of the agent who produced the object; it is also a familiar point that an interpretation’s success does not depend on such \nendorsement. In the case of law, an interpretation so understood may\ncorrectly identify, say, the change in rights and obligations that\nobtained in virtue of some enactment, even though the enactment’s having\nthat impact was not considered and endorsed, in some specified sense,\nby the enacting institution. \n\nSecond, interpretivism says that interpretation identifies\nsome moral principles which justify, in some specified sense,\nthe enactment’s having the impact in question. The point\ngeneralizes. For institutional practice as a whole, or for any individual\naction or attitude or other aspect of the practice, certain moral principles\njustify its having the impact on the law that it does have. The\nprinciples thereby make it the case that it has it. \n\nThird, for interpretivism, the justifying role of principles\nis fundamental: for any legal right or obligation, some moral\nprinciples ultimately explain how it is that institutional and other\nnonmoral considerations have roles as determinants of the right or\nobligation. In the order of explanation, morality comes first. \n\nThe relevant notion of justification has two aspects. First, the\nprinciples and therefore the moral facts that they reflect give\nreasons why any aspect of institutional practice or other\nnonmoral consideration bears on legal rights and obligations. The principles therefore explain why any such consideration is\nlegally relevant. Second, the principles thereby determine how any such consideration bears on rights and obligations. An interpretivist might say that certain principles of fairness or\nprocedural justice give enactments some role in determining rights and\nobligations. The precise role depends on the precise reasons why\nenactments should have it. An appeal to principles of fair notice\nmight give, other things equal, a central role specifically to the plain meaning of\nthe text of enactments. But on the hypothesis that democratically\nconstituted assemblies have justified power to shape rights and\nobligations as they choose, some conception of such assemblies’\nlinguistic intentions, or of their intention to affect the law in some\nparticular way by the relevant enactment, might be given priority. There may be\nspecial cases. An interpretivist might say that, because fair notice\nis essential to the permissibility of criminal punishment, criminal\nstatutes affect the law only as narrowly construed. An interpretivist\nmight further say that, in all cases, certain more specific moral\nprinciples control “the operation and effect” of all laws\n(as the Riggs v. Palmer court famously said, 115 NY 506\n(1889)). \n\nSimilar hypotheses would be germane to cases or institutional practice\nin general. For example that, because government ought to treat\nmorally like alike when it exercises its coercive power, judicial\ndecisions should stand; such that past decisions partly determine what\nrights and duties now obtain in circumstances similar to those of precedent cases in their morally relevant respects. Or, more abstractly,\nthat, because government has a duty to bring its action under a\ncoherent scheme of principle when it recognizes and enforces claims\nagainst some person, its institutional practice affects rights and\nobligations as certain principles dictate: namely the principles which\ntogether justify the practice’s having that role. In\nthese examples, the moral facts that the principles express explain\nwhy and how the institutional action in question affects legal rights\nand duties and therefore the principles’ role is to assign to\ninstitutional practice, or any of its aspects, their own role\nin the explanation. \n\nFourth, since in these explanations the mechanism, through\nwhich institutional practice determines rights and obligations,\nfollows from some moral principles that give the practice that very\nrole, the rights and obligations so determined have genuine moral\nforce.  For other conceptions of law, the question of the moral force\nof rights and obligations in law is separate from and must come after\nthe question of how institutional practice constitutes them\n(Stavropoulos 2012). We first ask how the practice determines rights\nand obligations, which is a conceptual or otherwise nonmoral question\nthat aims to identify the legally relevant aspects of institutional\npractice. Since our investigation is nonmoral, these must be\nunderstood as the factors that determine the content of legal rights\nand obligations, though not their force. We then ask the moral\nquestion, left open by the initial investigation, whether rights and\nobligations so determined truly bind. (Typically, the\nquestion takes the form of whether we have an obligation to obey the\nlaw.) The appropriate moral question is therefore severely constrained\nby the answer to the first, nonmoral one. We should ask what would\nhave to be true if the institutional factors already identified as\nlegally relevant were to constitute genuine moral rights and\nobligations. And of course there is no guarantee that what would have\nto be true would be true as often as one might suppose, or that it\ncould be true at all. Perhaps legal rights and obligations are rarely\nor never morally ratified. \n\nThis approach separates the metaphysical investigation of grounds from\nthe moral investigation of force. Considered from this perspective, a\nmoral explanation of how institutional practice determines rights and\nobligations of the sort offered by interpretivism may seem to belong\nin the second part of a complete account of the phenomenon of law, the\npart that concerns whether legal rights and obligations, nonmorally\nidentified, have genuine moral force. \n\nHowever, interpretivism is a thesis about the grounds of legal\nobligation which purports to compete with the two-stage and other\nsuch theses, not a thesis merely about the force of the obligations\nthat institutional practice constitutes in some nonmoral way. Rather,\ninterpretivism builds moral investigation into the metaphysical one.\nThe moral explanation that it offers assumes no nonmoral prior account\nof grounds and leaves no residual question whether legal\nobligations have moral force. \n\nThat said, there is an important distinction between two ways of\nunderstanding the interpretivist claim that institutional practice and\nmoral facts both play roles in the explanation of legal rights and\nobligations. \n\nOn the first way of understanding the claim, institutional practice\nconstitutes by itself part of the law; moral facts constitute by\nthemselves another part; and the final content of the law is some\nfunction of the two parts. On the second, institutional practice is\none factor in the explanation but does not constitute any part of the\nlaw. Rather, morality and institutional practice both figure in the\nconstitutive explanation of the law in the sense that the practice\ndetermines the content of the law as certain moral facts dictate and\nin virtue of those facts. \n\nAs we will see, a different version of interpretivism corresponds to\neach way of reading the claim that institutional practice and morality\ntogether ground legal rights and obligations. The first\nversion, hybrid interpretivism, which understands\ninstitutional practice as an independent ground, may give rise to a\nconcern of moral bias in the approach to the metaphysical problem. For\nit is reasonable to suspect that this kind of interpretivist sets out\nwith the goal of finding moral force in the law, and\nthe purpose of combining the institutional base with a moral overlay\nis to secure such force. On the second version, pure\nor nonhybrid interpretivism, which reflects the\nsecond reading of the distinction, there is no scope for such\nbias. For according to that version morality mandates the constitutive\nrole that the theory assigns to institutional practice; while there is\nno nonmorally predefined route through which the practice is supposed\nto determine any obligations. \n\nIt will help to develop these claims in comparison to the orthodox\nview about how institutional practice affects legal rights and obligations. \n\nOn the orthodox view (reflected in Hart 1994, and developed in its strongest form in Raz 1994), questions about the existence and content of legal rights and obligations are questions purely of institutional history. Legal rights and obligations are creatures of institutional action. Institutions that count as authoritative in a legal system create, modify, or extinguish a legal right or obligation primarily through communication (see e.g. Hart 1994 at 124). Institutional communication has its own logic. When an institution passes a statute or adopts a regulation, it must be understood to be conveying a norm (a standard that mandates or permits some action) or, more precisely, to be conveying the institution’s intention to create, by the act of conveying the intention, a norm with the stipulated content. From the perspective of the institution, such an act of communication always has the force of a binding order that subjects are meant to obey and brings into existence a binding norm, namely that subjects ought to take the stipulated action. The norms produced by institutional communication so understood (and possibly also the norms that institutions consider and tacitly endorse in their customary practices) are valid norms of the system and make up the entire content of the law. A legal right or obligation exists when and in virtue of the fact that a norm that is part of the law so understood confers or imposes it, therefore ultimately in virtue of the fact that some institution said so. On the orthodox view, it is a basic, conceptual truth about law that institutional action determines legal rights and obligations in this way. \n\nThese considerations describe the mechanism through which\nauthoritative institutional action constitutes rights and obligations. Further\nquestions arise. What makes for authoritativeness in the relevant\nsense (which institutions count as authoritative in the system)? How\nis legal validity related to moral force? \n\nThe question which institutions count as authoritative in the system is to be settled in the first instance by other norms constituted by authoritative directive that count as more fundamental. But this kind of explanation can only go so far. To avoid regress, the question must be settled ultimately by some factor other than an authoritatively created norm. A prominent suggestion is that the factor that ultimately explains legal authority is the settled official practice of recognition of the action of certain agents or institutions as a source of norms (a practice that may be considered itself as constituting a customary norm that is tacitly endorsed in and regulates official practice and from which legal institutions ultimately derive their authority to create valid norms; Hart 1994). \n\nOn the other hand, the considerations in discussion settle the\nlegal relevance of institutional decisions: the decisions\nmatter to the law as institutionally valid norms that impose\nobligations, which are genuine moral obligations from the point of\nview of the system (Raz 1990; contra Hart 1982). They settle,\nat the same time, the terms in which the further question of\nthe decisions’ genuine normative relevance must be posed. This becomes\nthe question whether institutional communications work as advertised, such that they\ntruly create norms (norms that are valid outright, not merely\nin the eyes of the institution that produced them) and therefore whether subjects do acquire an\nobligation to take some action because the relevant institution said\nso. In sum, the question of the genuine normative relevance of\ninstitutional action becomes the question of whether the institutions\nhave legitimate authority so understood (Raz 1990). Finally, these considerations leave open the question of what moral conditions must be met for the institutions to have legitimate authority. This is the business of theories of justification of authority, which include theories that appeal to consent, political association, democracy, or the ability of legal authority to secure cooperation or help subjects\nbetter conform to right reason. (For an overview,\nsee the entry on authority; see further Finnis\n1980, 1989; Raz 1986; Dworkin 1986. Notice that on Dworkin’s view\npolitical obligation is grounded in political association. Association\ngenerates obligations that associates owe one another, rather than an\nobligation to obey authoritative directives.) \n\nSome writers defend a less austere version of this model, by weakening\nthe notion of legal validity. They say that the validity of a\nnorm needn’t depend solely on whether an\ninstitution has conveyed the norm but may further depend on certain moral conditions, provided such conditions are laid down by more fundamental institutionally created norms. For example, if the Constitution entrenches some values, the conditions of validity of norms created by ordinary legislation would include those values. In such a case, the values\nwould play the crucial role only because some institution—a\nconstitutional assembly—said so. In another variant, values may\nbe made relevant to legal validity by the customary norm that governs\njudicial practice, which is the most fundamental norm, constitutive of\na legal system. In that\ncase, the nonnormative social fact of custom that constitutes the\nfundamental norm would make the values relevant to the validity of\nordinary norms (Coleman 2001a). In all these cases, rights and\nobligations in law are explained ultimately by nonnormative social\nfacts, but moral facts occupy some place further up in the order of\nexplanation. \n\nHybrid interpretivism represents another possibility along\nthat spectrum. It begins at the austere norm-based explanation of law\nbut defends an even more inclusive conception.  \n\nFor hybrid interpretivism, the set of institutionally valid\nnorms—the norms determined by what the institutions\nsaid—forms the interpretive baseline. Interpretation is a kind\nof moral processing of these norms. To interpret is to assess the\nnorms constituted by institutional communication and adjust the set in\norder to make it more attractive in some way—to make it better\nconform to the abstract point of legal practice against which it is\ninterpreted. Hybrid interpretivism is therefore the thesis that the\ninstitutional input to the interpretive process—what the\ninstitutions said—does not alone yield the final, complete set\nof legally valid norms. Rather, the final set of valid norms is the\noutput of the process. The final set takes as an additional input\ncertain moral facts. Yet the contribution of each kind of input\nremains distinct. Each episode of institutional communication, by\nitself, creates an institutionally valid norm which it makes available\nfor interpretive scrutiny. The hybrid interpretivist considers as\nsettled, without reference to any moral or other substantive normative\nfacts, how the contingencies of institutional practice contribute to\nthe law: he relies on the orthodox explanation of that mechanism\n(cf. Raz 1986, attributing the hybrid view to Dworkin). But he thinks\nthat there are additional conditions of validity. Substantive\nnormative facts may filter, supplement, or otherwise modify the\noriginal norms, as dictated by the interpretive goals in play. Legal\nvalidity of a norm now entails that the norm was either created by\nofficial communication and survived interpretive scrutiny or that it\nbears a certain relation, defined by the general point of legal\npractice, to such survivor norms. \n\nOne variant of hybrid interpretivism is the conception of law as\nconsisting of both rules and principles. This is typically attributed\nto Dworkin’s early work (Dworkin 1978; notice that Dworkin actually\ndisowns this view: 1978, at 76). Institutions convey rules, as Hart\nclaimed. These are screened and rejected or modified to the extent\nthat they conflict with certain basic moral principles of fairness or\njustice, as they did in Riggs.  Rules are also supplemented\nwith non-conflicting principles in hard cases, where the rules alone\nyield no determinate results. In such cases, the principles fill the\ngaps. The law is the hybrid of the two sets of standards generated by\nthe filtering and gap-filling operation. \n\nA sophisticated variant of this view can be built around the notion of\nprincipled consistency (“integrity”) which, according to\nDworkin’s later work, is a distinct political virtue that forms the\nfoundation of law (Dworkin 1986). Taking principled consistency in the\nlaw as an interpretive target, the interpreter identifies a set of\nprinciples that together justify the given set of norms. The\ninterpreter works therefore with two sets of norms, one composed of\nnorms conveyed by institutions, the other composed of uncreated,\ngenuine moral norms—general moral principles. He is to compare\nthe two sets, and adjust the first in light of the second. He may then\nsay that the law now includes both the original norms and the\nprinciples (or perhaps some further norms determined by the\nprinciples). Like its older, rules-and-principles cousin, the law is a\nhybrid, a creature of the two separate sets of standards, one grounded\nin social facts, the other in moral facts, that interpretation blends\ntogether (cf. Raz 1986). (A closely related variant says that the law is simply the set of principles that best justifies the institutionally given norms or, more loosely, the legal and political practices that generate them; Greenberg 2014).  \n\nIn this operation, the principles (and the further norms that they\ndetermine) are valid in virtue of the relation of justification they\nbear to the original norms. In the presently relevant sense of\njustification, an eligible principle is one that reflects an ideal\narrangement, prescinding from institutional practice, against which\nnorms that the practice produced are measured, provided the principle\nis at least logically consistent with the norms. Consider principles\nthat set out the morally right way to identify and deal with private\nwrongs, setting aside the actual practice of institutions in that\narea. Such principles would be germane to the project of designing\ninstitutions of tort from scratch or of reforming existing ones. But\nfor some principles to be said to justify some actual, institutionally\ncreated, norms of tort, as the hybrid interpretivist says his favoured\nprinciples do, it wouldn’t be enough that the principles captured the\nrelevant ideals. They would further need to be at least consistent, in\nsome specified sense, with the norms. A principle wouldn’t count as\njustifying an institutionally created norm in any sense, when it\nprohibited what the norm required or permitted. For any putative set of justifying principles, it’s a condition of eligibility additional to and independent of merit that the principles be consistent, in some\nspecified sense, with the set of the original norms. \n\nThe understanding of principled consistency used in this conception of\ninterpretivism corresponds to one understanding of Dworkin’s famous\ndistinction between fit and justification as dimensions of\ninterpretation (Dworkin 1986). Dworkin said that correct\ninterpretation must both fit and justify its object. On the\nunderstanding in discussion, fit operates as a threshold constraint on\neligibility of interpretations. Independent moral appeal governs the\nchoice among alternatives that pass the threshold (cf. Raz\n1994: 223). Fit, on this conception, is meant to ensure that a candidate interpretation\nis indeed an interpretation of some object rather than an\ninvention. It is a nonmoral constraint, in two ways. First, it is\nmeant to secure consistency with a set of norms that are grounded in\nnonmoral considerations—in the action and psychology of agents\nand institutions. Second, the relevant notion of consistency itself is\nmeant to be nonmoral, a constraint of formal consistency between norms\nand principles. (See Greenberg 2004 on fit as a matter of formal\nconsistency with practice. Greenberg argues that a constraint of\nformal consistency is empty.) The thought is that the original set of\nnorms could not really constrain interpretation if substantive, moral\nconsiderations played some role in determining what it is to fit the\nnorms. If the notion of fit were tainted by the very kind of\nconsideration that defines the ideals against which the actual norms\nare to be measured, the distinction between interpreting the actual\npractice of institutions and inventing a new, better practice would be\nerased. \n\nIn order to pursue principled consistency in the law while taking the\nset of institutionally created norms as the baseline, the interpreter\nwill have to aim at a composite objective, which can be analysed\ninto its components. He will have to strive for principle and for\nconsistency. \n\nSome of the time, the interpreter may be able to pursue both objectives\nsimultaneously without difficulty. Given some principles that justify\nnorms in this sense, the interpreter might add to the set certain\nfurther norms such as those implied by the explicit communication that\nconstitutes the original norms, if adding those norms would give better effect\nto the principles and thereby improve principled consistency (on the\ncurrent understanding of that notion) in the way government treats its\ncitizens. Or he may add certain norms that correspond to the relevant\nprinciples so do not conflict with the prior, institutionally\ncommunicated norms with which by hypothesis the principles are\nconsistent, whether or not the new norms are implied by the\nprior norms. Or (if this is different) he may add the norms that\njudges are morally required to rely on in order to resolve residual\nmatters in domains that are only partially regulated by the original\nset. In his view, the expanded rather than the original set of\nstandards would be valid law. \n\nBut the interpreter can’t reasonably hope that his work will always be\nso easy. Even assuming a fairly decent institutional history, the set\nof norms that would form the baseline would be the product of\npolitical action taken by different agents at different times, with a\nvariety of motives and facing different political and other\nconstraints in their choices (Raz 1994). The norms produced might\nconflict in their justification, some consistent with one scheme but\nindefensible under another. There might be no scheme of independently\nappealing principles—certainly not a perfectly just and\notherwise compelling scheme—consistent with all the norms\nwithout exception. If the baseline included a norm that couldn’t be\njustified by his favored scheme of principle, the interpreter might\nhave to try a different, less than perfect scheme, under which the\nproblematic norm might be subsumed, and trade merit for\nconsistency. But even if he were willing to accept a measure of\nimperfection in a scheme’s appeal, he might fail to find any eligible\nscheme, in which case he would have to reject the norm. Of course, if\nthe communicated norms were to function as a fundamental,\npre-interpretive constraint, rejection would have to be rare and\nsubject to special justification. Only something about the remaining\ninstitutional norms—that they all cohered with a given set of\nprinciples—could allow the interpreter to reject the\noutlier.  On the other hand, there might be several mutually inconsistent\nschemes of principle, each consistent with the original set of\nnorms. The interpreter would therefore have to choose from among these\nschemes on grounds other than consistency with institutional\npractice. Normally it would not be permissible, on this model, to add\na principle to the original set of norms (or to rely upon it to\ngenerate more norms) just because it was attractive. Rather, the\nprinciple would have to bear a relation at least of consistency with\nsome norm in the original set. But, in case that relation did not\nuniquely determine the principles in a scheme, the interpreter would\nhave to choose without being able to ground the choice by appeal to\nthe original set. He would have to choose on merit alone. (This is a\nconsequence of the model that has attracted a lot of criticism. See\nRaz 1994: 223–6; Finnis 1987, 1992. For Dworkin’s protests that\nthe distinction is merely heuristic, and should not be understood to\nmark two different dimensions of interpretation, see Dworkin 1982,\n1986, 2006.) \n\nA harder problem would arise where there are multiple candidate\nschemes of principle that are unequal in both independent appeal and\nconsistency, and imperfect in each dimension. Should the interpreter\nreject more of the original norms in return for an improvement in appeal, or accept a\nlarger compromise in appeal for a gain in consistency? At least in\nsome cases, where the relative gains and losses would not be\ndisproportionate on some conception of their magnitude, the\ninterpreter could not appeal to either merit or consistency to justify\na choice and it is unclear to what else he might appeal. \n\nThere are further difficulties. Hybrid interpretivism gives us no\nreason to abandon a sharp distinction between the pre-interpretively\ngiven corpus of institutionally valid norms constituted by\ncommunication alone, on which interpretation operates, and the final\nset of norms that interpretation yields. It therefore makes it seem\nthat the question whether the law is limited to the unprocessed input\nor extends to the processed output is merely verbal (Hart\n1994, Postscript;\nSchauer 1996; Greenberg 2011a). \n\nGiven these problems, hybrid interpretivism makes interpretation too\nclose to cooking the books to make them reflect some ideal which, if left\nalone, they fail. It is reasonable to take it, not as a doctrine about\nwhat determines the content of the law, but instead as an argument\nabout how best to decide hard cases given the law (now understood to\nbe restricted to the institutionally communicated norms). It becomes a\ntheory of adjudication, which builds upon the orthodox explanation of\nhow institutional action creates rights and obligations, namely by conveying norms, and recommends some way of resolving disputes given\nthose norms. Even so reinterpreted, problems remain. For hybrid\ninterpretivism now seems to recommend that judges extend the effect of\nany norms they find (or at least the ones not bad enough to fail the\ntest of consistency with even the least acceptable scheme of\nprinciple) into situations the norms don’t explicitly or clearly\nregulate, and it’s doubtful that some political ideal should support\nthis conservative policy (Raz 1986: 1111,\n1994: 224). \n\nThe immediate source of the difficulties lies in the composite\ncharacter of the ideal of principled consistency deployed by hybrid\ninterpretivism, which entails that the interpreter must simultaneously\naim at consistency and merit, understood as separate targets which\nneedn’t coincide. Given the difficulties, it is unclear that\ninterpretation could secure completeness, understood as the potential to\nresolve all possible disputes (which is often understood to be\ninterpretation’s further, perhaps basic objective; see Raz 1994;\nFinnis 1987; see also Leiter 2007, who claims that the thesis that\nthere is a right answer to all legal questions is at the core of\nDworkin’s project). The composite conception of principled consistency\nis forced upon hybrid interpretivism by its fundamental\ncommitment, to which the difficulties are ultimately traced: that the\nstarting point of interpretation must be some norms constituted by the\ncontingencies of institutional communication, and that\ninterpretation’s purpose is to compare and somehow to reconcile those\nnorms with ideals. \n\nThe hybrid interpretivist may claim that it is a deep constitutive\nfact about law that the institutional input to the law must be\ninterpreted in the relevant sense. Still, his view is hybrid in that\nit takes as the fundamental, pre-interpretive constituent of the law\nsome norm-creating acts of communication. So the basic explanation of the\nlegal relevance of political decisions—that the\ndecisions matter to legal rights and obligations and indeed that they\nmatter as such communications—is not itself interpretive in\ncharacter. The fact that, other things equal, an institution’s say-so\nmakes law, is a primitive legal fact, or at least a legal fact that is\nnot to be explained by either the nature of interpretation or some\nsubstantive interpretive conclusion in the legal domain. Hybrid\ninterpretivism is not therefore faithful to the basic interpretivist\nidea that the legal relevance of institutional practice is\nfundamentally explained by some political ideals. For example, that the fact that it’s\nthe duty of government to treat its citizens in a manner consistent in\nprinciple makes institutional decisions relevant to their legal\nobligations, rather than supplement the decisions or filter their\nresults. \n\nBefore we turn to that alternative, it is worth noting that hybrid\ninterpretivism differs from the view, not similarly\nunfaithful to the basic interpretivist idea, that some political ideal\n(perhaps involving fair notice) makes it the case that institutional\ndecisions contribute to the law the norms that the decisions are widely understood to express or endorse. (An example is the doctrine Dworkin\ncalls “conventionalism”, an interpretive conception of law\nthat he rejects as inferior to the conception he calls\n“integrity”.) For such a view, political ideals and\ninstitutional history would together constitute the content of the law\nin the right way. As a result, interpretation would be over at the\nstage of identification of the norms. Hybrid interpretivism, by\ncontrast, takes the norms as the object of interpretation and so its\nstarting point, not its end. \n\nPure interpretivism is nonhybrid. It understands principles,\ninstitutional practice, and their relation differently. \n\nInterpretivism begins at the question how institutional practice bears\non rights and obligations. For hybrid interpretivism, this question\nis, at least in part, pre-empted by the orthodox view on which it\nbuilds. Recall that according to the orthodox view, the practice itself (and\nultimately the very idea of law as that is commonly understood;\ncf. Raz 1986: 1114, 1994: 235 ff.) determines how the practice bears on rights\nand obligations. This is so because the practice consists in\ncommunication or tacit endorsement of norms which is meant to place subjects\nunder obligations just by virtue of communicating or endorsing the\nnorms. By taking all this as given, hybrid interpretivism\nbegs in some considerable part the fundamental question at which\ninterpretivism says one must begin. \n\nIn doing so, hybrid interpretivism commits itself to the existence of\nsome normative content—the norms and the obligations that follow\nfrom them—that is constituted by institutional practice\nalone. Moral principles contribute some more normative content, and\nthe final content imputed to the law is some combination of the\ntwo. \n\nBy shedding the orthodox base layer of its hybrid counterpart, pure,\nnonhybrid interpretivism takes no part of the basic question as\nsettled in that way. It therefore does not take the practice already\nto contribute norms, obligations, or any other kind of normative\ncontent, whether outright or from a point of view, or to consist in\ncommunication that conveys or is intended to constitute normative\ncontent. It understands the idea that the practice, nonnormatively\nspecified, plays a role in the fundamental explanation of the content\nof the law differently: the practice is a factor in the explanation,\nbut does not alone constitute any content. Nonhybrid interpretivism says that moral\nprinciples determine how the practice may determine such content. \n\nThere are several important implications. Institutional practice is\nconceived in terms of actions and attitudes, not norms or communication of norms. We start at what people do and say and think. Assemblies draft, debate, amend, and\nenact statutes. Agencies develop and adopt regulations. Courts\nconsider disputes, resolve them and issue opinions, including\ndissents, which offer reasons that support resolving the disputes in\none or another way. In short, institutions and agents operating within\nthem take actions, including the action of producing certain texts or\nutterances, and hold a variety of attitudes, whose role as\ndeterminants of legal rights and obligations is itself determined by\nthe moral principles in play. The principles may assign a\ncertain legal significance to the fact that some assembly produced a\ntext with some linguistic content. It does not follow from the fact that the action of producing the text is legally relevant that the action constituted a norm with the same content. Nonhybrid interpretivism does not assume that institutional practice consists in communication of norms with its own logic that is logic of the law. It does not assume that the practice contains in itself the\nparticular way in which enactments or decisions “are\nmeant” to constitute obligations. How institutional actions\nconstitute obligations (the metaphysical mechanism) a matter for\ntheory. There is no special, privileged institutional perspective so\nno internal, perspectival notion of obligation. \n\nA further implication is that legal obligations are not constituted by\nthe say-so of institutions, nor are their contents determined by what\ninstitutions said. A legal obligation need not match the content of\nofficial language (though a variety of moral factors will often see to it that it does)\nand needn’t be an obligation to take action for the reason that some institution\nsaid so. If that’s obedience, legal obligation needn’t be obligation\nto obey. \n\nIt follows that the purpose of moral explanation is not to assess the moral force of\nobligations whose content (and perspectival existence) is given in\nadvance of the explanation. It is to explain how obligations come to\nobtain, and therefore what their content is. No prior question of\ncontent is taken as settled, and no further question of force is left\nopen. \n\nSince it competes, rather than build upon, the orthodox view that institutions communicate or\ntacitly endorse norms (which thereby become legally valid), pure interpretivism has no use for\nthe orthodox notion of norms understood to play substantial\nexplanatory roles (or for a metaphysically important notion of a law,\nas distinct from the informal notion that picks out statutes or other\nlegislation). It is not a doctrine about the conditions of validity of norms. Legal\nnorms (or other standards) may figure in conclusions of\nreasoning that summarize the legal effect of institutional practice\nand are useful for exposition. Since standards so understood\nare derived from the explanation of the legal effect\nof practice, their existence is\nnot constitutively responsible for the\neffect. Standards may also play an epistemic role: we may draw inferences\nabout what rights and obligations exist from tried and tested\nformulations of standards, but the inferences are always subject to\nindependent confirmation and the formulations are subject to revision\n(Dworkin 1978: 76; Greenberg 2007; Stavropoulos 2013). \n\nA related point concerns the structure of the explanation. On the\northodox explanation of law, institutions issue directives each of which conveys and thereby creates a valid norm.  The\nimpact of each individual institutional action is therefore distinct:\nit is the addition of a valid norm to the law. Norms so constituted\nare then weaved together to form the complete content of the\nlaw. (This is not to deny that, on this view, some of the norms may concern precisely\nhow to weave norms together, for example by stipulating that lex\nposterior derogat legi priori.) The explanation is in that sense\natomistic (Greenberg 2007). Nonhybrid interpretivism is not so\ncommitted. Since it holds that morality determines how institutional\npractice affects rights and obligations, it inherits the holistic\nstructure of morality: the whole of morality confronts the whole of\ninstitutional practice and determines its effect, which interpretation\npurports to identify. Particular episodes of institutional practice,\nsay the enactment of a new statute, change rights and obligations by\nchanging the content of the practice and therefore its moral effect\n(Greenberg 2007, 2011a). \n\nThe notion of justification is very different on this view.  Moral\nfacts fix the relevance of other factors. The moral principles that\nreflect those facts do not add content to the law, which needs to be combined with \ncontent otherwise contributed by institutions. They determine which precise aspect of institutional practice is relevant to the practice’s contribution to the law. The moral facts are therefore fundamental to the constitutive explanation of law, but do not directly determine its content. They determine how institutional practice determines the law. \n\nA familiar hypothesis of that kind involves the principle that\ndisputes that are similar in morally relevant respects should be treated\nalike. This hypothesis dictates identifying morally relevant respects\nin cases, which introduces a role for further hypotheses involving\nmore specific principles that pick out those respects. Consider an\nimaginary case, Roe v Doe, where Doe is ordered to compensate Roe for\nthe damage that she incurred, which was caused by Doe’s action. In the\ncurrently relevant sense, a principle, e.g., that one is responsible\nfor damage caused by one’s carelessness on some conception of due\ncare, would be germane in case it identified the factor that was\nrelevant to Doe’s liability. If it did, it would normatively explain\nwhy Doe was ordered to pay—it would show how it’s right that he\nwas. At the same time, the principle would determine how this decision\nwould bear on other cases, given the duty to treat like alike. It\nwould reflect the facts that ground the duty of due care and the\nliability that due care entails that is articulated by the\nprinciple. A principle that figures in such a hypothesis must, first,\njustify resolving an actual or hypothetical contested case in a\nparticular way; and, second, justify resolving past actual or\nhypothetical settled cases, i.e., cases the outcome of which is not in\ndispute in the instant case, in the way they were or would have been\nresolved. Hypotheses of this character have similar functions, whether\nthey concern the action of institutions or of litigants. By picking\nout the morally relevant features of some aspect of institutional\npractice, hypotheses of principle function as explanations of the\nlegal relevance of that aspect of the practice today. \n\nCandidate factors are not restricted to what institutions said; nor\nare they restricted to what settled legal opinion considers\nrelevant. Perhaps the court said that the fact that the damage was\ncaused by Doe’s carelessness was what made him liable to pay compensation. But the court might not have said so—it might have\nmentioned something else, or said some conflicting things. Or it might\nhave mentioned carelessness and damage, but might have failed to say whether the\nmagnitude and likelihood of the damage compared to the burden of\nprecaution were germane to the standard of care that Doe failed. Would\nthe fact that the court failed to mention these considerations rule\nout their relevance to future cases? The answer would depend on some\nfurther principles that explained why and how past decisions as a kind\nare relevant, if they are, to instant cases. If courts should respect\ntheir past decisions because doing so reduces uncertainty or mitigates other\ncosts of economic transactions, a principle that the court failed to\narticulate might be irrelevant to the bearing of a case on future\ncases. But if courts’ responsibility is to engage with their past\ndecisions because they must act with integrity, such principles may be\ndecisive (Hershovitz 2006b). \n\nThese complications are not special to case law. A number of candidate\nfactors might plausibly determine a statute’s effect on legal rights and\nobligations. The plain meaning of the text of the statute; the actual\n(linguistic) intentions of certain members or the assembly as a whole\n(on some conception of corporate linguistic intention) to say or\nstate something by producing the text; their intentions to change\nlegal rights and obligations in a certain way, i.e., to secure some\nlegal effect by using the specific language of the statute; the effect\nthey would have intended to achieve if they had considered some\ncircumstances they did not; the effect they wanted the statute to be\nregarded by the courts to have; the effect they expected it to be\nregarded to have; their second-order intention that a certain\nfirst-order intention, e.g., their linguistic intention, control the\neffect of the statute; the political practices that existed before the\nrelevant statute was enacted and were not thought at the time and ever\nsince to have been affected by its enactment (Scalia\n1998); the purposes the statute was formally announced to serve in its preamble\nor in its sponsors’ reports; the reasons given in its defense during\ndebates; and so on. Often all of these considerations will pull in the\nsame direction, so the choice among them would make no perceptible\ndifference. But they needn’t, and we can always construct\nhypotheticals to test their relative contribution to the impact that\nsome decision has on the law. \n\nFor pure interpretivism, interpretive hypotheses are such tests and\nare designed to support the relevant theoretical choices. The\nhypotheses appeal to principles of political morality that justify\nsome particular aspect of the institutions’ action having a role as a\ndeterminant of rights and obligations. By doing so, they aim to\nestablish, for each candidate determinant of law, its precise impact\non the law, including its impact when some other candidate pulls in a\ndifferent direction (cf. Dworkin 1985, 1986,\n1998; Greenberg 2004; Stavropoulos 2013). \n\nCandidate relevant factors include considerations—texts,\npractices, or attitudes—that concern the very question how\ncandidate determinants bear on the law. Intentions about which\nintentions count, mentioned above (discussed in Dworkin 1985 and 1986)\nare such factors and canons or conventions of interpretation and\nprocedural provisions are familiar further examples. These are not\nexempt from the question why and so how they should bear on the\nlaw. Something other than the factors must determine their relevance\nto the law, even when it is pre-theoretically plausible that they are\nindeed relevant. For example, an interpretive convention tends to have\na significant effect on expectations about how the relevance of the\nother institutional factors that the convention concerns would be\nassessed in court, such that considerations of fairness favour\nconforming to the convention. If so, the convention is vindicated by\nconsiderations other than itself, and this holds for any similar\nfactor (see Dworkin 1985, 1986 regarding legislative intentions;\nGreenberg 2004 regarding any aspect of the practice that concerns the\nrelevance of other aspects). \n\nIn this conception, the difficulties of hybrid interpretivism do not\narise. Principles have the role of identifying the legally relevant\naspects of institutional practice. Principled consistency in this\nconception therefore consists in consistency in the morally relevant\nrespects of the practice. Principled consistency so understood has no\nroom for prior or residual concern about fidelity to the practice. The\npure interpretivist would say that, since it is not the case that we\ncompare moral ideals with some nonmoral code of norms constituted by\nthe content of institutional communication, the question does not\narise whether we ought to trade merit for consistency, to weaken our\nmorality to make it compatible with our history. Or whether we should\ntreat some ideal as a ground of obligation just because our\ninstitutions have not clearly said anything inconsistent with\nit. Since we ask in what ways institutional history is morally\nrelevant, the correct answer is determined by moral fact, not a moral\napproximation or an ideal diluted by history.  Yet the answer does not\ndescribe ideal arrangements—those we should want to have,\nprescinding from institutional history—but the normative\nsignificance of the arrangements we do have. So we shouldn’t worry\nabout our morality being too perfect for our history, or not as\nperfect as our history might let us get away with, or about how to\nchoose between the two. We deploy morality, as is, not to compare it\nwith history but to find what difference history made. \n\nWe have been discussing the question which aspect of institutional\npractice is relevant to legal rights and obligations. But how is it\nthat some or other aspect of institutional practice is so relevant?\nThe pure interpretivist case would be severely undercut if at that\nabstract level morality played no role in the explanation of\nrelevance. \n\nPure interpretivism offers a thoroughly moral explanation of the\nnormative relevance of institutional practice, by identifying a moral\nconcern that gives the practice in the abstract such relevance. It characteristically\nbegins at some familiar, structural features of legal practice, whose\nexistence is usually tacitly assumed. The first concerns the\ninstitutional character of law.  It’s an unspoken fundamental\nassumption in law that claims of legal right or obligation are claims\ngrounded, in some appropriate way, in past institutional decisions and\nstanding practices of government—in actual not ideal\ninstitutional arrangements—and that only claims so grounded\nshall be recognized and enforced. Call that kind of grounding\nthe legality of a claim. The second concerns the\nrole that the legality of a claim is supposed to play in relation to\nsome moral concern. It is not merely uncharacteristic but also\nimpermissible for legal institutions to enforce some claim against a\nperson, unless the claim meets the conditions of legality by being\nappropriately grounded in institutional practice. \n\nThis is not the discredited claim that what it is for a legal\nobligation to take some action to exist is for some sanction to be\nattached to not taking the action, or that a coercive clause must of\nnecessity be attached to every law. Rather, it is the claim that\nputative rights and obligations may be enforced through the\ninstitutions of government only when and because they bear a certain relation to\nthe institutions’ practice. This is a normative constraint that is not\ndependent on whether occasion for enforcement ever arises. It is\ncloser to Kelsen’s view that legality is at bottom a boundary\nseparating permissible coercion exercised in the name of the community\nand impermissible coercion not so exercised (though of course for\nKelsen this would be a moral boundary that only need exist in the eyes\nof the law, whether or not it exists outright; see Kelsen 1952). \n\nA familiar hypothesis is that the moral concern in play is raised by\ninstitutions’ effective power to use force or otherwise coercively to\ndirect citizens’ action. Legality is supposed to constrain or regulate\nthat power, by constituting a necessary condition that demands against\npersons must meet if they are to be permissibly enforced. Notice that\nin this role, legality is not a moral filter, a moral constraint on the\nvalidity of norms. In the hypothesis in discussion, there is no pool\nof candidate norms, identified by nonmoral tests, to be put through a\nfurther, moral test, before they are pronounced finally valid. Rather,\nlegality is a condition of permissible enforcement of demands against\na person, a special moral test that applies to any such demand,\nincluding those that are entirely unfounded as well as those that may\npass other moral tests. (This is the moral concern, and corresponding\nrole of legality, developed in Dworkin 1986, see also Dworkin\n2011. Alternative interpretivist hypotheses might assign to legality a\nsimilarly distinctive role in relation to some other moral\nconcern.) \n\nOn this view, it is essential to law that the legality of a\ndemand—its being grounded in institutional history in the right\nway—is a condition of its permissible enforcement. This is a\nclaim that is at once metaphysical—a claim about the nature of\nlaw—and normative—a claim about the morality of\ncoercion. It says that the correct explanation of why\ninstitutional history should have the role of constraint on coercive\nenforcement (a substantive normative explanation of a political ideal\nthat makes history morally relevant to the permissible enforcement of\nclaims) determines the correct explanation of how\ninstitutional history determines legal rights and obligations (the\nconstitutive explanation of what it is, more precisely, for a claim of\nright and obligation to be grounded in institutional history in the\nlegally appropriate way). \n\nThis general explanatory template can be filled out in a number of\nways. The best known (Dworkin 1986, also 2006, 2011) begins at the\nclaim that what explains the role of institutional history in the\nidentification and enforcement of rights and obligations is that government’s\naction should be consistent in principle—some version of the\nvirtue of treating what’s morally like alike, perhaps ultimately to be\nexplained by some combination of reasons of fairness and government’s\nspecial duty to treat citizens as equals. \n\nThis approach is based on the view that, emergencies aside, it is\nwrong for government to exercise its power to coerce if such an\nexercise is not allowed by law. Here, the law is meant to work as a\nconstraint on government’s action, and its role as a constraint is\nclaimed to be grounded in reasons of political morality. (Recall that the constraint follows from moral\nfact, not the logic of institutional action.) If government is to\nstand behind my request coercively to enforce my demand against you,\nit must justify its action by appeal to its institutional\npractice. The explanation of the role of legality in the exercise of\ncoercive power is that government is under a standing obligation\nalways to act in line with an honest conception of justice. It cannot\nbegin to meet this obligation unless it takes what it has said and\ndone on pertinent issues as relevant to what it may do now. Justice is\negalitarian in character. The familiar requirement of treating morally\nlike alike would bind government to use force on a given occasion in\nthe way it has used or would use it in any other actual or\nhypothetical circumstances relevantly similar to the instant one. \n\nPrincipled consistency in the use of force does not mean, in this,\nnonhybrid conception, that government is bound punctiliously to apply\nall norms promulgated by authorities or to repeat past mistakes. The claim is rather that the\nmorality of coercive interaction makes institutional practice relevant\nto what may or must be done now. Government must take its other action\n(legislation, cases, etc.) seriously and act now in a way that’s\nconsistent in principle with that action, taken together.  Any past\naction that cannot be justified under the scheme that justifies the\nrest is action that is not after all relevant to what is to be done\nnow, and is to be set aside as mistake. We must revise our\nunderstanding of principles on which we acted in the past, which may\nhave led us to such mistakes. \n\nSince government must make its action consistent in principle (rather\nthan formally), the conclusion we should derive from this normative\nexplanation, suitably elaborated, is that certain moral principles\nthat together justify institutional decisions and settled practice\ndetermine legal rights and obligations. These are moral rights and\nobligations that bear the right relation to institutional practice,\nwhich therefore government may enforce, and must do so on demand,\nthrough its institutions (Dworkin 1986, 2011). \n\nOn this view, the morality of coercion fundamentally explains the\nnormative relevance of actual institutions (Stavropoulos 2009). A\nrelated familiar hypothesis in political philosophy assigns to the\nmorality of coercion a fundamental role in the explanation of duties\nof socioeconomic justice. On this hypothesis, duties of justice\n(whether egalitarian, as many philosophers suppose, or not) obtain in\nvirtue of the political relation that holds among those who are placed\nunder the coercive control of some government, and are discharged by\ndesigning institutions in a way that meets certain constraints (Nagel\n2005). Whether or not coercion matters in that way is a topic much\ndiscussed in political philosophy, where writers are concerned with\nideal arrangements. The question is underexplored in relation to law,\nwhere we are concerned with the normative effect of actual\narrangements. \n\nAs indicated above, nonhybrid interpretivism is not committed as such\nto appeal to egalitarian concerns related to coercive\nenforcement. Alternative explanations that vindicate the assumed role\nof institutional practice in grounding obligations might be built on\nthe basis of considerations of fair notice (cf. the doctrine Dworkin\ncalls “conventionalism”, Dworkin 1986) or other principles of political morality, perhaps including considerations\nrelated to authority. \n\nA further question concerns boundaries. This is a matter of the first\nimportance for the orthodox view, which purports to organize\nobligations by institutional source, but seems less urgent for pure\ninterpretivism, on which no obligations are explained by institutional\ncontingencies alone. \n\nRecall that, on the current approach, some moral\nconcern makes institutional practice relevant to rights and\nobligations, and the rights and obligations in question have genuine\nmoral force. But it doesn’t follow that just any action of government\nthat has moral consequences, or even action that changes rights and\nobligations, and any change in rights or obligations that obtains in\nconsequence of such action, is to be regarded as falling within the\nlegal domain. The interpretivist says that the justifying connection\nbetween institutional practice and legal rights and obligations must\nbe such as to serve as an adequate response to the moral concern that\nis characteristic of legal practice. On the hypothesis we have been\ndiscussing, the concern is raised by coercive enforcement. A\nconception of law must therefore articulate the relation that must\nhold between some right or obligation and institutional practice if\nthe right or obligation is to be permissibly enforced. (Recall that\nthat moral relation is, on this hypothesis, the relation of legality,\nand rights and duties are legal when and because they bear that\nrelation to institutional practice). The requirement of legality so\nunderstood plausibly imposes procedural and other constraints on the\nkind of institutional action or other aspect of institutional practice\nthat may ground legal rights and obligations. Officials often make\npublic announcements about their future behavior designed to shape the\nexpectations and thereby the action of their intended audience (as did\nthe President of the European Central Bank when he announced, at a\nmajor investment conference organized by the British government, that\nthe ECB will “do whatever it takes to preserve” the\ncurrency, Draghi 2012). Normally when we give assurances designed to\nraise expectations, we thereby change what we owe to those that we\nassure, often coming to have a duty to perform. But there is no reason\nto expect that action of this kind, taken by officials outside normal\nprocedures, should in itself affect any legal right or\nduty. Equally, there is no reason to rule out its playing\nsome role in the determination of the impact of other, procedurally\nproper institutional action or other aspect of the practice.  For similar substantive reasons, it does not follow from its\nconception of legal rights and duties as moral consequences of\ninstitutional action, that interpretivism cannot distinguish between\nenforceable rights and duties that obtain in consequence of the kind\nof institutional action whose role as shaper of such rights and duties\nserves the value of legality, on the appropriate conception, on the\none hand; and further moral consequences, downstream of these rights\nand duties, on the other. On the hypothesis in discussion, the\ndetermination relation between rights or duties and institutional practice\nallays the relevant moral concern if it makes for principled\nconsistency in the practice (in the way discussed in more detail in\nthis Section and Section 4). On this basis, we can distinguish between\nthe legal duty of Albert, who owns a small business, to purchase a\nnew, more costly health insurance program for his employees following\nthe enactment of some new health care legislation that specifies a\ncertain minimum coverage, and his further, derivative duty, owed to\nhis family, to reduce his personal spending to make ends meet given\nthe increase in his business expenditure. By hypothesis, Albert comes\nto have the legal duty to purchase the new, more costly program\nbecause, once the new legislation is factored into institutional\npractice, that is what principled consistency in the practice now\ndictates. On this basis, we can say that the duty obtains because of\nthe difference that the legislation properly made to the law. On the\nother hand, Albert comes to have some duty of financial prudence\nbecause of the effect of these developments on Albert’s finances,\ntogether with certain personal circumstances and standing obligations\nthat seem unrelated to the subject matter of legislation and to the\nprinciples that govern it. On these facts, there is no reason to\nsuppose that this duty bears the right relation to institutional\npractice, as that was changed by the legislation, which would qualify\nit is as genuine legal duty whose recognition and enforcement would\nserve principled consistency. We have no basis, in this case, to say\nthat the duty was due to the difference that the legislation properly\nmade to the law—though it remains possible that the effect of\nthe difference the legislation did make on Albert’s finances might\nbear on some aspect of antecedent legal rights or duties that he might\nhave, e.g. a duty of child maintenance.  The fundamental assumption that ties enforcing rights and\nobligations to institutional practice serves to fix the subject matter\nof inquiry by setting the interpretive problem. Notice however that\nit does not rise to a conceptual constraint as these are normally\nunderstood. For the theory treats it as a commonly held moral\nhypothesis about the normative relevance of institutional practice. As\na substantive hypothesis it is not immune to doubt but is subject to\ncritical scrutiny. It would remain possible coherently to reject the\nassumption as mistaken, as long as an alternative hypothesis could\nmake intelligible other common pre-theoretical commitments. The\ndoctrine that Dworkin (1986) calls “pragmatism”\nillustrates this possibility, since it rejects the dependence of\npermissible enforcement on legality as defined above, and recommends\ninstead that claims of obligation be enforced when doing so is\njustified by forward looking considerations. For the pragmatist, the\nclaims’ relation to institutional practice is to be invoked merely for\nstrategic purposes. We might say that the assumption that connects\nenforcement to institutional practice fixes but does not determine the\nsubject matter of legal theory.  Moreover, the basic assumption does\nnot by itself entail an answer to the interpretive problem that it\nsets. That is the problem of constitutive explanation with which we\nbegan: how institutional practice figures in the constitutive\ndetermination of legal rights and obligations. \n\nThis picture requires that it be possible to share a subject matter\nwithout sharing truths that define it. Interpretivism about law\nimplies the possibility of disagreement about the grounds of law,\nbecause it makes law’s constitutive explanation a matter of\nsubstance—specifically, a matter of the moral justification of\nthe role of institutional history in the determination of rights and\nobligations. Notice that the possibility of disagreement about grounds\nis implied not only by the controversial nature of morality, but\nalready by the substantive (therefore potentially controversial)\ncharacter of the grounds. If the question of grounds is substantive,\nwe can disagree about what they are without changing the\nsubject. Unsurprisingly, this is the issue with which Dworkin\nbegins Law’s Empire (1986).  \n\nOne way to make out the possibility of disagreement about grounds that\ninterpretivism implies is to show that disagreement of that character\nobtains. Dworkin said that disagreement about the grounds of law is\npervasive. Many of his critics objected that the kinds of disagreement\nthat Dworkin seemed to have in mind can be explained in a way other\nthan as disagreements about grounds: for example, disagreements about\nthe social facts that constitute legal norms, or about how to apply\nthe norms, or about how to decide cases where the norms run out\n(therefore how to extend the law), against a background of agreement\non the grounds of law (Leiter 2003; Shapiro 2007, though not a\ndefender of interpretivism, finds such responses unsatisfactory). \n\nAnother strategy is to show the possibility of such disagreement\ndirectly, by offering arguments against the view that it must be\nimpossible. \n\nThe first strategy is unlikely to be productive. (Notice that some\ntheorists nonetheless think the strategy important to the defense of\ninterpretivism; see Smith 2010.) The interpretivist might begin by\nconsidering judgments about the existence of some legal\nobligation. His critics will say that disagreement in such judgments\nconceals agreement on grounds. The interpretivist will say that\nagreement in such judgments conceals disagreement on grounds. Absent\nsome demonstration that actual agreements and disagreements are of one\nor the other kind, it will be hard to resolve the issue. It is\npossible instead to construct an inference to the best explanation of\nthe phenomena, and the interpretivist may press that line. However, as I\nwill suggest, the success of his thesis does not depend on the\noutcome. \n\nThe second strategy addresses what really matters for\ninterpretivism. It may be that all lawyers agree on some question about the grounds of\nlaw. That would be consistent with it being a matter of substance what\nthe grounds are: perhaps lawyers just happen to concur in their\njudgments. What the interpretivist needs to show is that to challenge\nthe consensus would not be to change the subject. He needs to show\nthat disagreement about grounds is on the cards. \n\nTo defend the claim that disagreement about grounds is indeed\npossible, one would have to resist the assumption that, as a general\nmatter, we can only share a subject matter by sharing truths that\ndefine it. Indeed Dworkin, anticipating that his examples of disagreement\nthat appears to be about grounds would be reinterpreted by his critics\nas disagreement about social facts or about how to change the law,\ninvited his critics not to rule out the possibility that disagreement\nmight be more fundamental. He said that to think that disagreement\nabout grounds is never possible, for the reason that to share a\nsubject matter we must share criteria that define it, is a\nphilosophical prejudice: he called the prejudice “the semantic\nsting” (see Dworkin 1986). \n\nIt is now a familiar claim in general philosophy that, in the case of\ncertain objects and phenomena, an account of their nature is not built\ninto the understanding that is\nsufficient for competent use of the words that refer to them (or into the understanding\nof the relevant concepts that is sufficient for competent thinking). Such understanding, captured in criteria of\napplication and truths shared among competent users, does not provide\nsufficient metaphysical guidance. In many cases, such understanding\nincludes an open-ended clause that allows for the existence of a\ncertain kind of explanation of the nature of the objects, or, at\nleast, that understanding does not rule out some such explanation, yet\ncertainly falls short of picking out any particular explanation from\namong the eligible ones. In such cases, substantive investigation is\nindispensable to a complete explanation of the nature of the relevant\nobject, and often must come first, before we realize that it is indeed\ngermane to the nature of the object (Kripke 1980; Burge 1986; Rey\n1998; Williamson 2007; Stavropoulos 1996, 2012).  \n\nNow if it is granted that, at least in some cases, the explanation of the nature of some\nobjects may turn on matters of substance, the interpretivist may\ndefend the view that judgments about the grounds of law are open to\nchallenge. For he can simply construct such a challenge explicitly as\none that disputes that the considerations that are generally regarded\nto be the grounds of law are indeed such grounds (cf. Burge’s strategy\nin Burge 1986). \n\nIt is easy for the interpretivist to pursue that strategy. He can show\nthat there exist different eligible and mutually inconsistent\ncandidates for legal relevance. Do achievement intentions of\nlegislatures (intentions to change the law in a certain way) play any\nrole in the explanation of the impact of a statute? If so, do they\nplay a constitutive or merely an evidentiary role? Do expectations\nthat some arrangement introduced by statute will persist ever play\nsome role in the explanation of the statute’s impact? If so, do such\nexpectations, even if formed in the face of explicit notice to the\ncontrary, prevent later legislation from radically changing the\noriginal arrangement (cf. National Federation of Independent\nBusiness v. Sebelius 567 US 519 (2012) (11-393), opinion of the\ncourt), or is their legal relevance extinguished by the explicit\nnotice (cf. National Federation of Independent Business\nv. Sebelius, Ginsburg, dissenting)?  As we already saw in section\n4, institutional practice includes countless examples of such\ninconsistent eligible candidates, each eminently defensible as legally\nrelevant. But suppose that almost all lawyers agree on the relevance\nof one of a pair of inconsistent candidates. The fact that they do is\nyet another aspect of the practice, which is not privileged. For the\ninterpretivist, substantive—moral—considerations serve the\npurpose of determining the relevance of any factor. On the basis of\nsuch considerations, he can argue that the unpopular candidate is in\nfact relevant so the lawyers’ consensus is mistaken. \n\nThis view traces the intelligibility of fundamental challenges about\nthe grounds of law to unusual moral views about the legal relevance of\nsome factor. If this is correct, we should expect that such challenges\nmay occur with some regularity, and that arguments once widely\nconsidered not colorable may come to be taken seriously and finally to\nbecome dominant. The quick transition, from nonstarter to endorsement\nby the US Supreme Court, of the view that the Constitution limits\nlegislative authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms\n(District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 US 570 (2008) (07–290)),\nor of the view that the regulatory powers of the federal government do\nnot extend to mandating the purchase of health insurance (National\nFederation of Independent Business v.  Sebelius, cited above),\nare recent illustrations. \nInterpretivism offers a moral explanation of how institutional practice shapes legal rights and obligations. It is possible to offer an alternative explanation that is moral in character, without embracing certain other claims characteristic of interpretivism. Focusing on the mechanism through which institutions can change people’s normative situation, Greenberg (2014) and Hershovitz (2015) claim that legal rights and obligations are a subset of the moral rights and obligations that obtain in virtue of the actions of legal institutions. Greenberg claims that the subset is composed of those moral rights and obligations that obtain in the ‘legally proper way’. Which way is legally proper is to be understood in light of a normative constraint constitutive of law: that law is supposed to improve the moral situation. When legal institutions improve the moral situation, e.g. by taking action that secures coordination, the resulting moral obligations are legal obligations. But when the actions of legal institutions give rise to obligations to resist or undo or otherwise mitigate what the institutions did (an obligation to repeal legislation, shelter the persecuted, and so on), the resulting obligations do not trace to the action of institutions in the proper way (Greenberg 2014, Schaus 2015). By contrast, Hershovitz argues that we should not be overly concerned with the boundaries of the legal. As we saw, the question about the boundaries is a matter of the first importance for theories on which legal rights and obligations are created through some special nonmnoral mechanism but need not be consequential for theories that appeal to no such mechanism (see  section 5). Developing a point from Dworkin, Hershovitz argues that the idea that there is an existing body of law, which comprises all and only those rights and obligations in force in a given system, plays no role in legal practice (Hershovitz 2015, crediting Dworkin 1978). He argues that the better view is that the practice of legal institutions has a variety of normative consequences, moral and prudential. We might use ‘legal’ as a label for some of those, depending on our purposes: for example, to mark the source of an obligation or the institution that gets to enforce the obligation (Hershovitz 2015). \nIt is common ground between these views and interpretivism that, like other contingencies, the practice of legal institutions may change rights and obligations because and to the extent that it is morally relevant. This implies that the rights and obligations so produced are ordinary, genuine moral rights and obligations. Moreover, it implies that legal institutions can exploit the fact that their action is generally morally relevant in order reliably and systematically to change what we owe to each other. While the views in discussion focus on these implications, interpretivism concentrates on the problem of identifying the content and operation of the principles that in fact make legal practice morally relevant and govern its effects on rights and obligations.","contact.mail":"nicos.stavropoulos@law.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"law.ox.ac.uk"}]
