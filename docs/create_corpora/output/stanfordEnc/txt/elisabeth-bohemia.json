They also correspond on Descartes's physics, on the\npassions and their regulation, on the nature of virtue and the greatest\ngood, on the nature of human freedom of the will and its compatibility\nwith divine causal determination, and on political philosophy.\nDescartes dedicated his Principles of Philosophy to Elisabeth,\nand wrote his Passions of the Soul at her request. While there\nis much to be learned about Descartes's views by reading this exchange,\nmy concern in this entry is not to focus on its import for\nunderstanding Descartes's philosophical position, but rather to\nsummarize Elisabeth's own philosophical views. Elisabeth seems to have\nbeen involved in negotiations around the Treaty of Westphalia and in\nefforts to restore the English monarchy after the English civil war. As\nAbbess of Herford (Germany) convent, she managed the rebuilding of that\nwar-impacted community and also provided refuge to marginalized\nProtestant religious sects, including Labadists and Quakers.\n\n\n\nElisabeth Simmern van Pallandt, born on 26 December 1618, was the third of thirteen children and eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I of England and sister of Charles I. She died on 8 February 1680, in Herford, Germany, where she was abbess of the convent there. \n\nIn 1620, Frederick V, having been installed as King of Bohemia,\npromptly lost his throne in events usually taken to have precipitated\nthe Thirty Years War. In the 1620s, Elisabeth lived in Brandenburg with\nher grandmother and aunt until the children joined their parents,\nliving in exile, in The Hague, where they were sheltered by Maurice of\nNassau, Frederick's maternal uncle. Although all the details of\nElisabeth's education are unknown, it is clear that she and her\nsiblings were tutored in languages, including Greek, Latin, French,\nEnglish and German and perhaps others. We can infer that Elisabeth was\ntaught logic, mathematics, politics, philosophy and the sciences, and\nit is reported that her intellectual accomplishments earned her the\nnickname ‘La Greque’ from her siblings. She also was schooled in\npainting, music and dancing, and might well have been tutored by\nConstantijn Huygens. Pal (2012) provides more detail of the\nintellectual environment of the court in The Hague. \n\nWhile her correspondence with Descartes comprises the only\nsubstantive extant philosophical writings of Elisabeth, we are also\naware of a correspondence concerning Descartes's Geometry with\nJohn Pell, exchanges with Quakers, including Robert Barclay and William\nPenn, and letters written both by and to her concerning political and\nfinancial matters in the English Calendar of State Papers. The\ncorrespondence with Descartes reveals her to have been involved with an\nappointment in mathematics to the University of Leiden and in\nnegotiations on a number of matters, including the imprisonment of her\nbrother Rupert in conjunction with his efforts around the English Civil\nWar, negotiations of the marriage of her sister Henrietta, negotiations\nof the Treaty of Westphalia, and the finances of her family after the\nend of the Thirty Years War. There is also record of a brief exchange\nwith Nicholas Malebranche. She is also known to have been connected to\nFrancis Mercury van Helmont, who is reported to have been at her\ndeathbed. \n\nIn 1660 Elisabeth entered the Lutheran convent at Herford, and in\n1667 she became abbess of the convent. She seems to have been an\neffective manager of the convent lands, but also she welcomed more\nmarginal religious sects, including the Labadists, at the request of\nAnna Maria van Schurman, and Quakers, including Penn and Barclay. \n\nIt is worth mentioning the accomplishments of some of her siblings.\nHer older brother Charles Louis was responsible for restoring the\nUniversity of Heidelberg after the Thirty Years War. Rupert, the\nbrother born next after her, gained fame for his chemical experiments\nas well as for his military and entrepreneurial exploits, including the\nfounding of the Hudson's Bay Company. Louise Hollandine, a younger\nsister, was an accomplished painter and student of Gerritt van\nHonthorst. Sophie, her youngest sister, became the electress of Hanover\nand was renowned for her intellectual patronage, particularly that of\nLeibniz. Sophie's daughter, Sophie-Charlotte, was tutored by Leibniz,\nand both women carried on substantive philosophical correspondence with\nLeibniz in which he clarified his philosophical views. See Strickland\n(2011). \n\nElisabeth seems to have taken an early interest in the passions, as Edward Reynolds dedicated his Treatise on the passions and the faculties of the soule of man (1640) to her. While there is little information about its context, the dedication suggests that Elisabeth had seen a draft of the work, and so one can infer that they had some discussion or correspondence. Reynolds's work, while distinctive in the period as a self-standing treatment of the passions, draws largely on Aristotelian-Scholastic discussions. It does, however, focus on the sensitivity of the passions to reason, and so our capacity to correct our errant passions through reflection. \n\nElisabeth's correspondence with Descartes begins at her initiative\nin 1643 and continues until Descartes's death in early\n1650. Elisabeth does not seem to have produced any systematic\nphilosophical work, and her extant philosophical writings consist\nalmost entirely of her correspondence with Descartes. While we have\nDescartes's works, and centuries of interpretation to contextualize his\nside of the exchange, we do not have this larger picture in which to\nsituate Elisabeth's thoughts. Thus, any account of her proper\nphilosophical position must be gleaned through interpretation. It is\nevident from the correspondence that Elisabeth has a remarkable and\nwide-ranging critical philosophical acumen. Careful reading of her side\nof the correspondence does suggest she has some positive philosophical\ncommitments of her own, on matters including the nature of causation,\nthe nature of the mind, explanations of natural phenomena, virtue, and\ngood governance. \n\nWhile many of Descartes's letters to Elisabeth were published in the volumes of his correspondence edited by Clerselier after his death, Elisabeth refused Pierre Chanut's request to publish her side of the exchange. Elisabeth's side of the correspondence was first published in a volume by A. Foucher de Careil, after he was alerted to its existence by an antiquarian bookseller, Frederick Müller, who had found a packet of letters in Rosendael, outside Arnhem. These same letters are what appear in the Oeuvres of Descartes, edited by Charles Adam and Paul Tannery. The letters from Rosendael are not originals, but rather copies that date from the early 18th century. The consistency of their content with that of Descartes's letters, along with allusions to events in Elisabeth's family and private life, argues strongly in favor of the authenticity of the copy. \n\nThe correspondence between Elisabeth and Descartes begins with\nElisabeth's asking probing questions about how Descartes can explain the\nability of an immaterial substance to act on a material substance. At\nissue in this initial query is the kind of causation operating between\nmind and body. As Elisabeth frames the issues, existing accounts tie\ncausal efficacy to extension, and in this regard it is significant that\nshe poses her question about the mind's ability to act on the body, and\nnot the body's ability to affect the mind. To account for the causal\nefficacy of an immaterial mind, Elisabeth suggests that Descartes can\narticulate either the account of causation proper to mind-body\ninteraction or the substantial nature of the mind such that existing\naccounts could explain its actions. Descartes's response is not only\nevasive but opens up further issues, in particular about whether the\nmind-body union is a third substance, insofar as he appeals to the\nScholastic notion of heaviness to address Elisabeth's concerns (Garber\n1983), and intimates there is a contradiction in thinking of mind and\nbody as both two distinct substances and as united (Mattern 1978). In\naddition, in his responses, Descartes jumps between the two separate\nissues of mind-body and body-mind interaction (Rozemond 1999).\nMy concern in this entry is not, however, to articulate the views\nexpressed in Descartes's side of the correspondence. \n\nThis exchange reveals that Elisabeth is committed to a mechanist\naccount of causation—that is, one limited to efficient causation.\nElisabeth rejects Descartes's appeal to the Scholastic conception of\nheaviness as a model through which to explain mind-body interaction, on\nthe grounds that, as Descartes himself previously argued, it is\nunintelligible and inconsistent with a mechanist conception of nature.\nThat is, she squarely rejects the formal causal explanatory model\nunderlying the Scholastic notion of a real quality, insofar as she\nrefuses to consider that model appropriate in some contexts. She is\nnonetheless open-minded about which account of efficient causation\nought to be adopted. This openness reveals that she is apprised of\ndebates about the nature of causation in the period (Gabbey 1990,\nClatterbaugh 1999, Nadler 1993). Elisabeth's investment in the new\nscience emerging in the seventeenth century is reflected in what she\nwrites regarding mathematics and natural philosophy, discussed briefly\nin the next subsection. \n\nElisabeth's remarks to Descartes also suggest that she is willing to\nrevisit Descartes's substance dualism. She presses Descartes to further\narticulate his account of substance, pointing not only to the problem\nof mind-body interaction, but also to cases where the poor condition of\nthe body—the vapours, for instance—affects capacity for thought.\nThese cases, she intimates, would be more straightforwardly explained\nby considering the mind to be material and extended. The issue of the\nrole of the condition of the body in our capacity for thought also\nfigures in the correspondence of 1645, concerning the regulation of the\npassions, both from a theoretical and a personal perspective. Elisabeth\nseems to maintain the autonomy of thought—that we have control over\nwhat we think and can turn our attention from one object to another,\nand so that the order of thought does not depend on the causal order of\nmaterial things. However, at the same time she acknowledges that the\ncapacity for thought, and the free will essential to it, is dependent\non the overall condition of the body. Elisabeth thus rejects an account\nof mind that reduces thinking to bodily states, but at the same time\nshe calls into question the idea that the capacity of thinking exists\nwholly independently of body, that is, that a thinking thing is\nsubstance properly speaking. The force of her early question to\nDescartes, to further explain what he means by substance becomes clear,\nbut she herself does not offer a developed answer to the question.\nInterestingly, Elisabeth introduces her own nature as female as one\nbodily ‘condition’ that can impact reason. While Descartes concedes\nthat a certain threshold of bodily health is necessary for the freedom\nthat characterizes rational thought, he disregards Elisabeth's appeal\nto the “weakness of my sex” (Shapiro 1999). \n\nIn letters of November 1643, shortly after the initial exchange\nconcerning the union of mind and body, Descartes sets Elisabeth the\nclassic geometrical problem of the three circles or Apollonius's problem: to find a circle that touches each of three given circles on a\nplane. While Elisabeth's solution is no longer available,\nDescartes's comments indicate that Elisabeth had already mastered\ntechniques of algebraic geometry. She is thought to have learned them\nfrom Johan Stampioen's textbook. Elisabeth's approach to the problem\nseems to have differed from Descartes's own, and Descartes\nremarks on her solution having a symmetry and transparency in virtue of its using only a single variable that his\nlacked. Elisabeth's\nrecognized mathematical acumen is also evidenced by her involvement in\nthe hiring of Frans van Schooten to the mathematical faculty at Leiden\nand John Pell's effort to enlist her help in understanding Descartes's\nGeometry. \n\nIn 1644, Descartes dedicated his Principles of Philosophy\nto Elisabeth. In that work, Descartes not only presents his metaphysics\nin textbook form, he also lays out his physics in some detail.\nElisabeth responds to the dedication with gratitude, but also by\noffering criticisms of Descartes's accounts of magnetic attraction and\nthe heaviness of mercury. \n\nAlso in the correspondence, Elisabeth shows herself to have a keen\ninterest in the workings of the physical world: she criticizes Kenelm\nDigby's reading of Descartes; she requests the works of Hogelande and\nRegius; she reports on various natural phenomena, and in particular on\ndiseases and cures, while seeking an efficient causal explanation of\nthese phenomena. \n\nIn his letters to Elisabeth of 1645 and 1646, Descartes develops his\nmoral philosophy, and in particular, his account of virtue as being\nresolved to do that which we judge to be the best. His letters begin\nas an effort to address a persistent illness of Elisabeth, which\nDescartes diagnoses as the manifestation of a sadness, no doubt due to\nthe events of the English Civil War. As Elisabeth herself puts it, he\n\"has the kindness to want to cure [her] body with [her] soul\" (AT\n4:208, 24 May 1645). While they begin by reading Seneca's De Vita\nBeata, they both agree that the work is not sufficiently systematic, and\ndiscussion turns to Descartes's own views. Once again, Elisabeth, in\nher letters, plays a principally critical role. \n\nHer criticisms of Descartes take up three distinct philosophical\npositions. First, she takes up the position of Aristotelian virtue\nethics, in objecting that Descartes's very liberal account of virtue,\nwhich requires only the intention to do good, does not require that\none's good intentions are realized in actions that are actually good.\nThat is, she notes that Descartes makes virtue impervious to fortune\nor moral luck. She, however, goes beyond the canonical Aristotelian\nposition to maintain that even our ability to reason is subject to\nluck. (This position helps to illuminate her view on the nature of the\nhuman mind. See the discussion in section 3.2 above.) Elisabeth also\ntakes up a classically Stoic position, insofar as she objects to the\nway in which Descartes's account of virtue separates virtue from\ncontentment. She objects that Descartes's account of virtue allows for\nthe virtuous agent to make mistakes, and she does not see how an agent\ncan avoid regret in the face of those mistakes. Insofar we regret when\neven our best intentions go awry, we can be virtuous and fail to be\ncontent. While it is unclear whether her objection is a psychological\none or a normative one, she does maintain that achieving contentment\nrequires an ‘infinite science’ (4:289) so that we might\nknow all of the impact of our actions, and so properly evaluate\nthem. Without a faculty of reason that is already perfected, on her\nview, we cannot only not achieve virtue, we also cannot rest\ncontent. (See Shapiro 2013 for an interpretation of these remarks.) In\nthe context of this exchange, in the same letter of 13 September 1645,\nElisabeth asks Descartes to \"define the passions, in order to know\nthem better\" (AT 4: 289). It is this request that leads Descartes to\ndraft a treatise on the passions, on which Elisabeth comments in her\nletter of 25 April 1646, and which is ultimately published in 1649 as\nThe Passions of the Soul.  Elisabeth's concerns about our\nability to properly evaluate our actions lead her to express a further\nconcern, this time about the possibility of measuring value\nobjectively, given that we each have personal biases, whether by\ntemperament or by matters of self-interest. Without a proper measure\nof value, she implies, Descartes's account of virtue cannot even get\noff the ground, for it is not clear what should constitute our best\njudgement of what is the best course of action.  Behind Elisabeth's\nobjection here is a view of ethics akin to that of Hobbes and other\ncontractarians, which takes the good to be a matter of balancing of\ncompeting self-interests.  In his letter of 15 September 1645\nDescartes aims to answer some of her concerns by outlining a set of\nmetaphysical truths knowledge of which will suffice in guiding our\npractical judgements, including that all things depend on God (who\nexists), the nature of the human mind and its immortality, and the\nvast extent of the universe (15 September 1645; AT 4:292). Elisabeth\nresponds by asserting that these considerations just open more\nproblems—of explaining human free will, of how understanding the\nimmortality of the soul can make us seek death, and of\ndistinguishing particular providence from the idea of\nGod—without providing any guidance for evaluating things\nproperly. (See Schmaltz (forthcoming) for an interpretation of\nElisabeth's view on free will and divine providence.) \n\nElisabeth's interest in properly evaluating actions and their\noutcomes is clearly related to her position as an exiled Princess, one\nwith hopes that her family will regain some of their political power.\nShe is particularly concerned with the problems that rulers face making\ndecisions that stand to impact a large group of people with incomplete\ninformation. To this end, she asks Descartes to present the central\nmaxims \"concerning civil life\" (AT 4:406, 25 April 1646), and for his\nthoughts on Machiavelli's The Prince. Descartes politely\nrefuses the former, but offers his thoughts on the latter in his letter\nof September 1646. Elisabeth offers her own reading in her letter of 10\nOctober 1646. In her view Machiavelli's focus on a state that is the\nmost difficult to govern does provide useful guidance for achieving\nstability, but affords little for how to proceed in governing a stable\nstate. It is reasonable to assume that further consideration on these\nissues informed her management of the convent at Herford. \n\nElisabeth also corresponded with a number of prominent Quakers,\nincluding Robert Barclay and William Penn, who visited her at the\nconvent in Herford. Though both Barclay and Penn attempt to gain\nElisabeth as a convert, she does not seem interested in engaging them\nphilosophically or theologically. Insofar as the Scottish Quakers\nplayed a strategic role in the efforts to restore the English throne, one can\nwonder whether her engagement with them was simply political. On the\nother hand, Elisabeth's long-standing interest in emerging alternative\ntheories, along with her interest in divine providence, makes it just\na plausible that she took a more intellectual interest in their world\nview.","contact.mail":"lshapiro@sfu.ca","contact.domain":"sfu.ca"}]
