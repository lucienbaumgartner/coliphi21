He adopted the logico-semantic approach of\nWilliam of Ockham and John Buridan while at the same time defending\nthe traditional views of Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. His thinking\nsheds light on the discussion between nominalists and realists and\nallows insight into the changing interests of philosophy and theology,\nfrom the critical attitude of many fourteenth-century authors to the\nsearch for tradition which was characteristic of the fifteenth\ncentury.  \n\n\n Marsilius of Inghen was born around 1340 in Nijmegen, a city in the\neastern part of the Low Countries\n (Netherlands).[1] In the older\nliterature it is often said that he came from one of the villages in\nthe vicinity of Nijmegen (Inghen), but this view is mistaken. It was\nbased on a confused reading of the Oratio Funebris held in\n1396 by Nicholas Prowin at the funeral of Marsilius and published in\n1499 at Mainz.[2]\n From 1362 on, Marsilius was master at the Faculty of\nArts at the University of Paris, where he was also rector (1367 and\n1371), and a student of theology. As a teacher at Paris, Marsilius was\nmuch esteemed and his lectures drew large audiences. Among his\nstudents were many compatriots, some of whom came from Nijmegen and\nsurrounding villages. In 1378, Marsilius found himself the\nUniversity’s delegate at the court of Pope Urban VI in Tivoli. In\n1379, he instructed one of his colleagues, Hugh of Hervort, to look\nafter his interests in Paris.  After 1379, Marsilius’s name is no\nlonger mentioned in the acts of the University of Paris. He probably\nturned away from Paris because of the imbroglio surrounding the Great\nSchism of 1378. Meanwhile, he kept in touch with his native city. In\n1382 the town council of Nijmegen treated him to a banquet. From 1386\non, Marsilius was master at the University of Heidelberg. There, as in\nParis, he held a number of administrative offices. He was one of the\nfounders of the University of Heidelberg, of which he was rector no\nfewer than nine times, from 1386–1392 and also in 1396. In 1389–1390,\nas the University’s nuncio together with Conrad of Soltau, he\nwas responsible for transferring the University register to Rome\n(Boniface IX). At the beginning of the 1390s, Marsilius again took up\nthe study of theology.  The masters who taught theology were by then\nConrad of Soltau (since 1387) and Matthew of Krakow (since 1394), both\nfrom the University of Prague. In 1395/1396 Marsilius finished his\nlectures on the Sentences and so became the first theologian\nto obtain the doctorate at Heidelberg. He died a short time later, on\nAugust 20, 1396.  \n\nMarsilius was a prolific writer. His work was the fruit of his\nteachings in Paris and Heidelberg. Many of his writings have been\npreserved in manuscripts or early printed editions, although recently\nsome have appeared in modern critical editions. His most important\nwritings include:[3] \n In his logic and epistemology, Marsilius followed the nominalist\ntradition of the fourteenth century as exemplified by William of\nOckham and John Buridan. Yet Marsilius never qualified himself as a\nnominalist or follower of Ockham. He was an independent thinker who\nsometimes went back to the older tradition of the thirteenth century\n(e.g., in Peter of Spain), or advocated theories which were more in\nline with ordinary speech, as against the highly specialized views of\nhis contemporaries. Marsilius employed logical methods and discussed\nlogical and epistemological issues in almost all of his writings,\nincluding his commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, which, in\naddition to his works specifically dedicated to logic, were also used\nas a source for late medieval and early modern treatises on logic. \n\nMarsilius’s nominalism comes to the fore in his views on the object of\nscientific knowledge, the nature of universals, and the logical\ndoctrine of supposition. His basic assumption is that there are only\nindividuals and no universals outside the human mind. \n According to the Aristotelian standard accepted by Marsilius, the\nobject of scientific knowledge must be universal and necessarily true.\nThis is not the case with individual things in the external world,\nsince they are subject to change. Only the conclusion of a true and\nnecessary syllogism can meet the standard. Hence, for Marsilius, the\nobject of scientific knowledge is not anything outside the mind, but\nthe mental proposition which refers to individual things and their\nqualities. More specifically, the proper object of scientific knowledge\nis a proposition in the form of a conclusion that has been deduced from\nnecessary premises.[4] \n Marsilius argued that universal concepts such as\n‘humanity’ do not refer to real universals outside the\nhuman mind. Accordingly, there is no universal essence in singular\nindividuals. Individuals of one genus or species do resemble each\nother, however, and this resemblance is the foundation of universal\nconcepts in the human mind. The generation of universal concepts is a\nnatural process, which Marsilius described as follows: suppose\nindividual A of species S evokes concept X\nin the human mind. This concept is similar to concept Y which\nhas been evoked by B of the same species S. By\nabstracting from all the differences between X and\nY, the human mind is able to produce another concept,\nZ, which stands for both A and\nB. Universality is then taken to be a quality of concept\nZ, the product of the epistemological operation of\nabstraction on concepts X and Y by the human\nmind.[5] \n In line with his account of the nature of universals, Marsilius\nrejected simple supposition. Logicians such as Peter of Spain had used\nthe notion to indicate that a term stood not for an individual but for\na universal or common nature in the external world, like the term\n‘man’ in the proposition, ‘Man is a species’.\nSince Marsilius rejected the idea of universals existing outside the\nmind, he eliminated simple supposition from the list of different\ntypes of supposition. He was critical of some of his contemporaries\n(e.g., Albert of Saxony) who likewise dismissed the concept of real\nuniversals, yet kept on using the notion of simple supposition. They\nhad changed the meaning of the term, he said, by claiming that a\nwritten or spoken term had simple supposition if it was used to refer\nto a concept in the human mind. Marsilius wondered whether young\nstudents would be able to understand this new meaning of simple\nsupposition, since they would hardly know what concepts are. To avoid\nconfusion, Marsilius decided not to deal with simple supposition at\nall in his logic.[6] \n\nAccording to Marsilius, the ten Aristotelian categories refer to things in reality which themselves are not signs of other things. These categories are names or concepts of primary intention, as he calls them. However, since there are also names which are used to refer to signs or to names of things and not to things themselves - such as the terms ‘genus’ and ‘species’, which are called names of secondary intention - there needs to be an additional category of secondary intention, beside the ten Aristotelian categories of primary intention. This category may be called the ‘category of signs’ (praedicamentum signi) or the ‘category of terms’ (praedicamentum termini), Marsilius says.[10] The existence of such a category does not refute the traditional number of ten categories, since the traditional categories, even though they are names or concepts themselves, do not refer to names or concepts, but to things in reality. In claiming such a category, Marsilius goes beyond John Buridan, who does not recognize it, and further elaborates a position already mentioned by Duns Scotus. Accordingly, for the metaphysician who considers ‘being as being’ (ens inquantum ens) there are only ten categories, whereas for the logician who deals with ‘concepts as concepts’ (intentiones per se )  there are more than ten. In the late Middle Ages, philosophers like John Eck attributed the view that there is an additional category called praedicamentum signi to Marsilius of Inghen and his followers, among whom was the Nominalist John Parreut.[11] \n Marsilius was his own person when it came to assessing the views of\nothers. In his analysis of the proposition ‘Socrates is not a\nchimera’ he followed what he called ‘the Parisian\nmethod’, according to which the proposition is false because the\nterm ‘chimera’ supposits for nothing, there being no real\nchimeras to which it can refer. Others, however, considered the\nproposition to be true.[12] \n\nElsewhere, he departed from the opinions of the Parisian School\n(scola Parisiensis) and opted for the perspective of ordinary\nlanguage or common way of speaking (communis modus loquendi).\nThis was the case with his analysis of the proposition ‘The\nAntichrist is not, but he will be’. According to the Parisian\nSchool, the term ‘he’ refers to the thing referred to by\nthe term ‘Antichrist’. Since there is no Antichrist,\nneither term has reference. But in ordinary language it is different,\nfor there the term ‘he’ is meant to refer to the future\nAntichrist. Marsilius accepted the latter analysis as sound, despite\nthe authority of the former.[13] \n\nFinally, in the definition of ampliation, Marsilius went back to\nlogicians of the thirteenth century such as Peter of Spain, who had\ndefined ampliation as an extension of supposition, whereas\nfourteenth-century logicians such as Albert of Saxony did not consider\nampliation to be a kind of supposition. Marsilius reinterpreted their\ndefinition so that it fit better with the older tradition. Such efforts\nto harmonize older and newer positions were typical of the late\nfourteenth century.[14] \n In natural philosophy and metaphysics Marsilius was an empiricist,\nmeaning that he thought all scientific knowledge must be based on\neither sense data or self-evident propositions, i.e., propositions in\nwhich the meaning of the predicate is included in the\nsubject. Everyone who knows the meaning of the terms of such\npropositions judges them to be evidently\n true.[15] This has far-reaching\nconsequences for the relationship between philosophy and\ntheology. Since the philosopher uses only sense data and self-evident\npropositions, his inquiry may come to different conclusion than that\nof the theologian, who has additional knowledge from Scripture. The\nphilosopher makes judgments about the world from a limited human\nperspective, whereas the theologian is helped by divine\nrevelation.[16] \nYet Marsilius took the task of the philosopher seriously\nbecause he thought the human mind has a natural tendency to search for\ntruth, which is satisfied (although not ultimately satisfied) in\nnatural philosophy and\n metaphysics.[17] \n According to the principles of natural philosophy, creation from\nnothing is impossible. The senses show that things always come from\nother things. Because there is no serious reason to doubt the\ninformation given by the senses, the human mind legitimately jumps to\nthe universal principle that nothing can come from nothing, driven by\nthe natural tendency to search for truth. Consequently, for the human\nmind creation from nothing is impossible. It contradicts the universal\nprinciple that nothing comes from nothing. That God has created the\nworld from nothing is therefore only a matter of faith (sola fide\nest creditum). Revelation shows that human knowledge of creation\nis limited, but it cannot be aided by natural philosophy at this\npoint.[18] \n In the later Middle Ages the study of the soul was part of natural\nphilosophy. Marsilius treated the human soul in his commentary on\nAristotle’s De anima, in which he followed the Parisian\ntradition of Buridan and Oresme concerning the particular questions\naddressed. Following Buridan, he argued that there is no natural proof\nof the immortality of the human soul. For the human natural mind,\nunaided by revelation, the theory of Alexander of Aphrodisias that the\nhuman soul is corruptible is the most probable. That Alexander of\nAphrodisias is mistaken and that the soul continues to exist after the\ndeath of the body is known through revelation alone. Faith has more\nauthority than human reason and must be accepted in all cases where\nthe two conflict since the things we believe on faith come from God,\nwho cannot err.[19] \n Although metaphysics cannot surpass the limits of human knowledge,\nMarsilius considered it to be the entry point to theology. Natural\nreason is capable of forming some adequate and true concepts of God,\nand also of forming true propositions about God. It is able to prove\nthat God exists and possesses knowledge and will. But it cannot\ndemonstrate that God has free will or infinite power. This, Marsilius\nclaimed, was also true for philosophers such as Aristotle, whose\nteachings equal those of natural reason\n itself.[20] \n\nFrom Buridan, Marsilius took the idea that God according to Aristotle\nand Averroes is not only the final cause of the heavens and separate\nsubstances, but also their efficient cause. On this point Buridan and\nMarsilius were following the view of Scotus and Ockham against that of\nJohn of Jandun, Johannes Baconis, and Gregory of Rimini. It is worth\nnoting in this connection that in the Puncta super libros Metaphysicae\n(i.e., brief abstracts of Aristotle’s Metaphysics for teaching\npurposes) attributed to Johannes de Slupcza and written in Krakow in\n1433, some of the views that Marsilius adopted from Buridan, including\nthe one just mentioned, are attributed to Marsilius instead of Buridan\n-- notwithstanding the fact that the author was familiar with both\nMarsilius’s and Buridan’s commentaries. This illustrates the strong\ninfluence Marsilius’s work exerted on fifteenth-century students and\ncommentators.[21] \n\nOn other points, however, Marsilius was critical of Buridan. For\nexample, Marsilius considered Buridan’s solution to the problem of the\npossible separation of accidents from their substance as not in\naccordance with the teachings of Aristotle, and therefore not truly\nmetaphysical (metaphysicaliter), but rather in line with theological\nconcerns. Only miraculously could God take over the supporting power\nof the substance, thus separating the accident from its natural\nbearer. According to Marsilius, however, such possible divine\nintervention should not be taken into account in metaphysics, where\nthe philosopher must use natural reason\n alone.[22] \n\nMarsilius was the first rector of the University of\nHeidelberg. According to the oldest Statutes of the Arts Faculty of\nthis university, every master must inform the students that whenever\nAristotle contradicts faith, e.g. in his claim that the world is\neternal, he is following natural reason and although his arguments in\nthese cases are wrong and faith must be accepted, natural reason\ncannot help but follow Aristotle and therefore cannot prove the\nconclusions of\n faith.[23] \n This paragraph clearly echos\nMarsilius’s view on the issue. Other contemporary universities, like\nthat of Vienna, were less rigorous and prescribed a more harmonious\nprocedure, stipulating that whenever there was a conflict with faith,\nthe masters had to argue in favor of faith against Aristotle to the\nbest of their\n possibilities.[24] \n Marsilius expressed his theological views in a voluminous commentary on\nthe Sentences. He quoted and often adopted views that were put\nforward by fourteenth-century theologians such as Adam Wodeham and\nGregory of Rimini, but was also influenced by earlier thinkers such as\nThomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. He has serious reservations about the\nuse of logic in theology.  \n In his discussion of the divine attributes he followed mainly the\nteachings of Adam Wodeham. God is perfectly one. Divine wisdom and all\nother perfections attributed to God are in reality as identical to the\ndivine essence as the divine essence is identical to itself. In the\ndivine essence itself there is no distinction or non-identity\nwhatsoever between the attributes of God. Any distinctions between\ndivine attributes are necessarily of a rational (rather than real)\nnature and are made by\n us.[25] \n\nA similarly radical stance on the unity of God was assumed in his\ntreatment of divine ideas. Ideas are not formally distinct in God, as\nsome Scotists would argue, but only extrinsically and objectively\ndistinct. Their distinction is a consequence of the differences\nbetween the creatures produced by God (which is why Marsilius spoke of\nextrinsic distinction), and of the fact that they are known by God as\ndifferent (which accounts for their objective distinction). God knows\nthat he is the cause of infinitely many differences between creatures.\nThat is why his mind contains infinitely many different\n ideas.[26] \n\nMarsilius criticized Ockham’s view that God’s idea coincides with\ncreation. If this were true, Marsilius argued, the idea of producing a\nstone must be identical with either the stone itself, or the stone\ninsofar as it is known by God. If the former, then God must look\noutside of himself in his idea, which contradicts the position of\nAugustine, who is quoted by Ockham. If the latter, then the idea of its\nproduction is not the stone itself, but rather God’s foreknowledge of\nthe stone.[27] \nMarsilius advanced his criticism of the use of logic in theology in\nhis discussion of the position of Robert Holcot. Holcot had argued\nthat logically, God can be called the cause of evil. If God is the\ncause of every thing (entitas) and moral evil (malum\nculpae) is a thing, then God is the cause of evil. Marsilius\nacknowledged that the argument is based on true premises, yet the\nconclusion should not be defended as true because it contradicts faith\nand therefore might cause confusion among believers. Theologians\nshould not flaunt their personal skills in logic, but always write out\nof reverence for the divine. Their writings should not erode the\nbeliefs of ordinary people, who are not skilled in logic, but rather\naim to strengthen them\n spiritually.[28] \n\nMarsilius was anxious, however, to avoid the implication that God’s\nforeknowledge is somehow dependent upon human beings. In his\ndiscussion of Adam Wodeham on the causality of the human will, he\ncomplained that Adam had not been emphatic enough on this point, since\nhe allowed the following argument: if an event E will happen\nin the future, then God knows E from eternity; but if\nnot-E will happen, then God knows not-E form\neternity; since man is free, he can choose between E and\nnot-E; therefore, he can change God’s foreknowledge. This\nargument is logically sound, Marsilius argued, but it easily leads to\nthe false conclusion that God’s knowledge depends on the free will of\nman, which is absurd. The eternal cannot fall under the power of that\nwhich is created by it. Therefore, this argument should not be\nused. It is better to remain on the safe side by maintaining what has\nalways been maintained, namely that God through his absolute\nomniscience knows the future activities of human beings, but without\nbeing dependent on\n them.[29] \nAlso in his discussion of trinitarian and Christological issues he\nwarns theologians not to naively follow the rules of logic without\nbearing possible misunderstandings in mind. Although the sentence\n‘Christ is only God’ is logically true because Christ is\nGod and no other person born on earth but Christ is God, it is\ndangerous to accept this sentence without further qualifications,\nMarsilius argues, because it seems to confirm the view of those\nheretics who claim that Christ was without a human nature, as the word\n‘only’ can be understood to exclude humanity when added to\nthe word\n ‘God’.[30] \n In his treatment of the sacraments at the end of his commentary on\nthe Sentences, Marsilius drew heavily on the writings of\nThomas Aquinas and Bonaventure. He defended Thomas’s view that the\nword ‘this’ pronounced by Christ at the Last Supper in\nuttering ‘This is my body’ (Mk. 14:22) refers to what the\nbread and body have in common. Thomas of Strasbourg had attacked this\nview, but Marsilius showed that the earlier Thomas was right and the\nlater wrong.[31] \n\nIn his discussion of the causality of the sacraments, Marsilius\nfollowed the exposition of Bonaventure, according to whom the\nsacraments have no causality of their own. It is God who acts whenever\nthe sacraments are administered correctly. Only in a broad sense is it\ntrue to say that the sacraments have the power\n to act.[32] \n The influence of Marsilius has been considerable, particularly\nthrough his logical works and commentaries on Aristotle. This may be\ngathered not only from the large number of manuscripts that have been\npreserved, but also from several other\n considerations.[33] Marsilius’s\ncommentary on Aristotle’s Prior analytics was used in Prague\nin the 1380s.  His logical works, including the Obligationes\nand the Consequentiae, were used as textbooks in Vienna in\nthe 1390s.  His commentaries on Aristotle’s Metaphysics and\nPhysics were read in Krakow during the first sixty years of\nthe fifteenth century. At the universities of Heidelberg, Erfurt,\nBasle, and Freiburg, his works were studied throughout the fifteenth\ncentury, in particular as part of the university curriculum. In 1499,\nthe doctors and masters of the Via Moderna at the University\nof Heidelberg published a volume that included epigrams on Marsilius\nby well-known humanists such as Jacob Wimpfeling, as well as a defense\nof Nominalism in the style of Marsilius (Via\nMarsiliana). Praise in the form of epigrams can also be found in\nthe 1501 Strasbourg edition of Marsilius’s commentary on the\nSentences. The Obligationes, printed in 1489 under\nthe name of Peter of Ailly, were used by Thomas Bricot, John Major,\nand Domingo de Soto. The commentary on the Prior Analytics\nwas quoted by Agostino Nifo.  Jodocus Trutvetter and Bartholomew of\nUsingen, who consolidated nominalism in Erfurt, repeatedly mentioned\nMarsilius in their works.  Both Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei\nreferred to Marsilius’s commentary on De Generatione et\nCorruptione.  \n\nThe theological views of Marsilius appear to have had some circulation\nas well. His commentary on the Sentences was known in Krakow\nin the first half of the fifteenth century, and was used by Thomas de\nStrampino in his Principia (1441–1442). The University of\nSalamanca had a theological chair (Cátedra de Nominales) for\ncommentary on the works of Marsilius of Inghen and Gabriel Biel. His\ncommentary on the Sentences was quoted by Spanish theologians\nsuch as Francisco de Vitoria, Domingo de Soto, Luis de Molina, and\nFrancisco Suárez, usually in connection with questions about\ndivine foreknowledge and grace. \n\nThere are nine extant manuscripts of Marsilius’s commentary on the\nSentences. Among the former owners of these manuscripts were\ntwo libraries for preachers (Ansbach and Isny), and two libraries of\nfaculties of arts (Erfurt and Leipzig). The education in Erfurt and\nLeipzig included the reading of nominalist authors. In all probability,\nthe artists became interested in Marsilius’s theological work after\nstudying his writings on logic and physics. The presence of Marsilius’s\ncommentary on the Sentences in preachers’ libraries bears\nwitness to the fact that the impact of his work was felt beyond\nuniversity circles.[34]","contact.mail":"maarten.hoenen@unibas.ch","contact.domain":"unibas.ch"}]
