Many commentators have observed that in\nEinstein’s first derivation of this famous result, he did not\nexpress it with the equation \\(E = mc^2\\). Instead, Einstein concluded\nthat if an object, which is at rest relative to an inertial frame,\neither absorbs or emits an amount of energy \\(L\\), its inertial mass\nwill correspondingly either increase or decrease by an amount\n\\(L/c^2\\). In Newtonian physics, inertial mass is construed as an\nintrinsic property of an object that measures the extent to which an\nobject resists changes to its state of motion. So, Einstein’s\nconclusion that the inertial mass of an object changes if the object\nabsorbs or emits energy was revolutionary and transformative. For as\nEinstein concluded “If the theory agrees with the facts, then\nradiation transmits inertia between emitting and absorbing\nbodies” (Einstein, 1905b). Yet, in Newtonian physics, inertia is\nnot the kind of thing that can be transmitted between bodies. \n\n\nOver a century after Einstein’s first derivation of mass-energy\nequivalence, as his famous result is called because one can select\nunits in which one can express it with an equation of the form \\(E =\nm\\), the result continues to receive outstanding empirical support.\nFurthermore, as the physicist Wolfgang Rindler has pointed out, the\nresult “has been found applicable and valid in many branches of\nphysics, from electromagnetism to general relativity” (Rindler\n1991, p. 74). Thus, from Rindler’s perspective, which is shared\nby many physicists, mass-energy equivalence “… is truly a new\nfundamental principle of physics” (Rindler 1991, p. 74). \n\n\nThe two main philosophical questions surrounding Einstein’s\nequation, which are the focus of this entry, concern how we ought to\nunderstand the assertion that mass and energy are in some sense\nequivalent and how we ought to understand assertions\nconcerning the convertibility of mass into energy (or vice versa).\n\n\n\nThe equation \\(E = mc^2\\) is, arguably, the most famous equation in\n20th century physics. To appreciate what Einstein’s\nfamous result is about, and what it is not about, we begin in Section\n1 with a description of the physics of mass-energy equivalence. In\nSection 2, we survey six distinct, though related, philosophical\ninterpretations of mass-energy equivalence. We then discuss, in\nSection 3, the history of derivations of mass-energy equivalence and\nits philosophical importance. Section 4 is a brief and selective\naccount of empirical confirmation of Einstein’s result that\nfocuses on Cockcroft and Walton’s (1932) first confirmation of\nmass-energy equivalence and a more recent, and very accurate,\nconfirmation by Rainville et al. (2005). \n\nA lot of philosophical attention has been paid to how the meaning of\nstatements concerning lengths and times changes in the context of\nspecial relativity. For example, we have learned from Stein (1968)\nthat a statement such as “the length of the table is 2m,”\nwhile perfectly meaningful in the context of Newtonian physics, is\neither elliptical at best or meaningless at worst in the context of\nspecial relativity. However, comparatively little philosophical\nattention has been paid to how special relativity brings about\ncorresponding changes to the third fundamental dimension in basic\nphysics: mass. Yet, assertions concerning mass, and other dynamical\nconcepts in mechanics into which it figures centrally, notably\nmomentum and kinetic energy, also have their meanings changed in\nspecial relativity.  \nTo illustrate these changes, Section 1.1 reviews the concepts of mass,\nmomentum and kinetic energy in Newtonian physics. In Section 1.2, we\nbegin exploring the concepts of mass and energy in special relativity\nand state the notation we use in all further discussions, a step we\nmust make explicit as discussions of the equivalence of mass and\nenergy have historically used different notations, which can lead to\nconceptual confusion. In Section 1.3, we discuss the physical\nsignificance of mass-energy equivalence as it applies to the analysis\nof bodies (construed as indivisible wholes) and idealized versions of\ncomposite systems, while in Section 1.4 we discuss mass and energy in\natomic physics. In Section 1.5, we present an elementary derivation of\nEinstein’s famous result with the hope that our readers will get\na sense of “why” mass and energy are equivalent according\nto special relativity. Finally, in Section 1.6, we consider the\nrelationship between the equivalence of mass and energy codified in\nthe equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\) and the nearly identical, though\nconceptually quite different, ubiquitous equation \\(E = mc^2\\).  \nIn Newtonian physics, a typical physical object, such as a billiard\nball, has associated with it a positive, real number called its\nmass, for which the symbol \\(m\\) is commonly used. When we\nare focusing on describing mathematically the motion of this object\nunder the action of contact forces, such as when one tries to predict\nwhere a billiard ball will go after a collision, the mass in question\nis also called the inertial mass. In the special case in\nwhich one considers how the billiard ball moves in response to\ngravity, say as it falls toward the earth, the measure of how the\nbilliard ball “responds” to the gravitational field is\ncalled the gravitational mass of the object. Using\nexperiments in which he filled wooden boxes with different materials\nand suspended them from strings to construct pendulums, Newton\ndiscovered that inertial mass and gravitational mass are directly\nproportional. Physicists have since customarily treated inertial and\ngravitational mass as numerically equal.  \nThe inertial mass in Newtonian physics (and even the gravitational\nmass) is routinely interpreted as an intrinsic property of an object.\nThe inertial mass of an object is a measure of the body’s\ninertia, i.e., its tendency to resist changes to its state of motion\nin response to the action of any kind of force. Since at\nleast the late nineteenth century and Mach’s criticisms of\nNewton’s physics, physicists have deprecated thinking of mass as\nthe “quantity of matter.”  \nThe physical intuition behind the Newtonian concept of inertial mass\nis basic if we can avail ourselves of the notion of a Newtonian force.\nGiven two bodies \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) in suitably idealized conditions,\nif it takes twice the force for \\(B_2\\) to attain the same final\nvelocity as \\(B_1\\), \\(B_2\\) has twice the mass of \\(B_1\\), i.e.,\n\\(B_2\\) has twice the inertia of \\(B_1\\). In Newtonian physics, the\ninertial mass of an object, and even its gravitational mass, can only\nchange by either physically removing a part of the object or attaching\na part to the object to make a bigger whole.  \nTwo important quantities for describing the motion of objects in\nNewtonian physics are momentum and kinetic energy. Unlike mass, each\nof these quantities is what we might call a relational, or extrinsic,\nquantity. Although all physical objects have some value (or amount) of\nmomentum and kinetic energy, the value of each of these quantities\ndepends on the inertial reference frame relative to which one is\nmeasuring these quantities.  \nNewton called momentum the “quantity of motion,” which is\nan apt label, because, very roughly, it is a measure of the extent to\nwhich an object is moving relative to an inertial reference frame. Our\ncolloquial use of the word “momentum” is related to this\nintuition and to its formal definition as the product of the mass of\nan object times its velocity relative to some inertial reference\nframe. If object \\(B_2\\) has twice the mass as \\(B_1\\) but moves with\nthe same velocity relative to a reference frame, \\(B_2\\) has twice the\nmomentum.  \nVelocity, however, is a directed quantity, because it codifies not\njust the speed \\(v\\) with which the object moves, but also its\ndirection. Velocity is formally represented by a vector\n\\(\\mathbf{v}\\), the magnitude of which is the speed of the object\n\\(v\\), which we sometimes also call the “velocity” of the\nobject while allowing the context to indicate that this is elliptical\nfor “the magnitude of the velocity.” Momentum is therefore\nalso a directed quantity, represented formally by a vector\n\\(\\mathbf{p}\\). To paraphrase Taylor and Wheeler (1992, p. 191), the\ndirection of momentum matters: A glancing blow is never as damaging as\none that is head on. By analogy with velocity, the magnitude of the\nmomentum is represented by the letter \\(p\\).  \nFinally, in Newtonian mechanics, an object in motion relative to a\nreference frame also has kinetic energy, or energy of motion. Kinetic\nenergy, like all forms of energy, can be transformed into another kind\nof energy. So, for example, one could measure the kinetic energy of a\nmoving billiard ball by having it collide with a ball of soft putty or\na spring that brings the ball to rest and measuring the energy\nabsorbed by the putty or spring. There is no single standard symbol\nfor kinetic energy, though most elementary physics textbooks use\n\\(KE\\), more advanced books tend to use \\(T\\).  \nUnlike the momentum, kinetic energy is not a directed quantity. It is,\nlike momentum, a function of the speed \\(v\\) of the object relative to\nan inertial frame. The faster an object moves relative to some\ninertial frame, the more momentum and kinetic energy it has. However,\nfor an object that is not accelerating, i.e., an object that covers\nequal spaces in equal times, one can always find an inertial reference\nframe in which both the momentum and the kinetic energy of the object\nis zero.  \nFollowing Griffiths’ approach, we might say that so far we have\nmerely defined some quantities (Griffiths 1999, p. 509 ff.). The\nphysics really lies in the three corresponding conservation principles\nassociated with these quantities: the principle of conservation of\nmass, the principle of conservation of energy, the principle of\nconservation of (linear) momentum. These principles contain the\nphysics, because each one states that a certain quantity, mass,\nenergy, or momentum, is conserved in all interactions. So, for\nexample, if we consider the collision of two billiard balls, one can\nuse the conservation of momentum to predict, given the initial motions\nand masses of the billiard balls, how they will move after the\ncollision.  \nAs Hecht has emphasized, Einstein never wrote down his famous result\nusing the symbols “\\(E\\)” and “\\(m\\)” as they\nappear in the famous equation attributed to him (Hecht 2012). Although\npart of the reason is merely that Einstein used different letters for\nenergy, mass, and the speed of light in his early papers discussing\nmass-energy equivalence (in 1905 and 1906), deeper reasons related to\nhow we should understand the result quickly emerged.  \nIn his review article on special relativity from 1907, Einstein shows\nthat a body of mass \\(\\mu\\) that has absorbed an amount of energy\n\\(E_o\\) as measured in its rest frame executes motion, in an inertial\nframe relative to which it moves with some velocity, as if its mass\n\\(M\\) was given by the expression (Einstein 1907b, p. 286):  \nIn a footnote, Einstein explains the convention, which he had already\nadopted in an earlier paper (Einstein 1907a, p. 250), of using\n“the subscript ‘\\(o\\)’ to indicate that the quantity in\nquestion refers to a reference system that is at rest relative to the\nphysical system considered” (Einstein 1907b, p. 286).  \nAfter 1907, Einstein’s notation crystalizes so that by 1921, in\nhis Princeton Lectures, Einstein expresses his famous result by\nwriting (Einstein 1922, p. 46):  \nOur main task in the next section is to explain the physical\nsignificance of the equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\), which we will henceforth\ncall “Einstein’s equation”, and its relationship to\nits iconic variant without the subscript “\\(o\\)” appearing\nbeside the letter “\\(E\\)”.  \nHowever, it is important before going much further to note that in\nEinstein’s equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\), the symbol \\(m\\) is the mass\nof an object as measured in the inertial frame in which that\nobject is at rest. Physicists also call this mass \\(m\\) the\n“rest-mass” of the object. The rest-mass of an object is\nnumerically equal to its Newtonian inertial mass, though arguably the\nsymbol \\(m\\) (or the corresponding term “mass”) has\ndifferent meanings in Newtonian and relativistic physics (see, e.g.,\nKuhn 1962, p. 101 ff. and Torretti 1990, p. 65 ff.).  \nFurthermore, there are conceptual reasons why both Einstein and many\ncontemporary physicists do not add a subscript “\\(o\\)” to\n\\(m\\) when denoting rest-mass. For example, Taylor and Wheeler argue\nthat the phrase “rest-mass” engenders potential confusion\nas it might lead the reader to ask: What happens to the rest-mass when\nthe object is moving? Answer: nothing (Taylor and Wheeler 1992, p.\n251). The rest-mass of an object is an invariant quantity in special\nrelativity; it has the same value for all inertial observers. Taylor\nand Wheeler quip: “In reality mass is mass is mass”\n(Taylor and Wheeler 1992, p. 251). From their perspective, which is\nquite standard now in physics textbooks and articles, there is no need\nto prefix the term “mass” with “rest,” because\nthere is no other kind of mass worth speaking about in special\nrelativity (see\n Section 1.6).\n  \nHenceforth, we will adopt the accepted convention, though it is\nadmittedly not universally followed especially in older sources, of\nusing the following symbols with their stated meanings (see Table 1):  Table 1. Notation used in this entry \nWe will first focus on the mechanics of idealized point particles in\nspecial relativity. Regardless of the macroscopic objects they\nrepresent, we shall treat such particles, and by extension the\ncorresponding physical objects, as un-analyzable wholes. We will then\nseparately discuss “composite systems” or systems composed\nof such particles. Physicists use composite systems to approximate\nphysical objects when they are interested in examining the\n“inner workings” of such objects, such as when they treat\na gas as a collection of idealized particles.  \nFollowing Geroch, we can begin to explain the physical significance of\nEinstein’s equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\) by considering a very simple\nphysical system. Imagine, as Geroch suggests, a brick being heated or\na battery being charged (Geroch 2005, p. 198). Suppose we consider\nthese objects in the inertial reference frame in which they are at\nrest. As the brick is heated, or the battery charged, it absorbs an\namount of energy \\(E_o\\) as measured in its rest frame.\nEinstein’s equation tells us that the mass of the brick, or\nbattery, after it absorbs an amount of energy \\(E_o\\) is increased\nexactly by an amount \\(E_o /c^2\\). The value of the mass of the hot\nbrick or charged battery is greater than it was before it absorbed\nenergy. So, for example, it takes just a little bit more\nforce to move the charged battery than it did to move the uncharged\nbattery. How much is “a little bit more”?  \nGeroch has a clever way to answer this question. Suppose we use the\namount of energy \\(E_o\\), as measured in the rest-frame of the\nbattery, to accelerate the battery (instead of charging it) so that it\neventually reaches a final speed of 670 mph. Since 670 mph seems like\nsomething moving pretty fast, at least by the non-relativistic\nstandards of human travel, one might think that one is using quite a\nbit of energy to accelerate the battery to that speed. Now suppose\nthat instead of using the energy \\(E_o\\) to accelerate the battery, we\nuse that same amount of energy \\(E_o\\) to charge the battery. The\nincrease in the mass of the charged battery is \\(E_o /c^2\\), but\nbecause the speed of light is such a large number, approximately 670\nmillion mph, “the mass of the battery would be\nincreased by about 1 part in a million-million (i.e., by a fraction\n\\(10^{-12}\\)…)” (Geroch 2005, p. 199).  \nThere is nothing unique about energy absorption in these examples. As\nthe battery loses energy, say by powering a device, or the brick emits\nthermal energy as it cools, its mass decreases. Consequently, imagine\na suitably idealized closed system in which two objects \\(B_1\\) and\n\\(B_2\\) are in a state of relative rest. If \\(B_1\\) radiates an amount\nof energy \\(E_o\\) and \\(B_2\\) fully absorbs that same amount of\nenergy, the mass of \\(B_1\\) decreases by \\(E_o /c^2\\) while the mass\nof \\(B_2\\) increases by the same amount. This physical change in the\nmasses of \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) is a novel prediction in special\nrelativity. For in Newtonian physics, there is no relationship at all\nbetween the inertial mass of a body and the amount of energy it\nradiates or absorbs. This is why Einstein was led to conclude that\n“If the theory agrees with the facts, then radiation transmits\ninertia between emitting and absorbing bodies” (Einstein 1905b).\nIf special relativity is supported by empirical evidence, the inertial\nmass of an object can change, not because we have chopped off a piece\nof the object or attached more stuff to it, but merely because the\nobject has radiated or absorbed energy. To physicists and philosophers\ntrained exclusively in the Newtonian tradition, this result would have\nseemed perhaps extraordinary but certainly revolutionary.  \nSo far, we have been focusing on what physicists such as Baierlein\n(2007) call the incremental version of mass-energy equivalence,\nbecause we have focused on the strict correlation in special\nrelativity between a change in the rest energy of a body \\(E_o\\) and a\nchange in its mass \\(m\\). However, Einstein also emphasized two subtly\ndifferent “readings” of his equation. First, as early as\n1906, Einstein argued that when one considers physical systems in\nwhich there are electromagnetic processes, such as a\n“complex” of light being emitted from the inside wall of a\nfreely-floating box and absorbed by the opposite wall, one could avoid\na fundamental conflict with the laws of mechanics “if one\nascribes the inertial mass \\(E/V^2\\) to any energy \\(E\\)”\n(Einstein 1906, p. 206. Note that \\(V\\) represents the speed of light. See also Taylor and Wheeler 1992, p. 254, for\na detailed discussion of this example). This insight, sometimes\nexpressed with talk about the “inertia of energy,” was an\nimportant step in the development of general relativity, because that\ntheory uses the principle of equivalence, which states very roughly\nthat inertial mass and gravitational mass are directly proportional,\nas a foundational principle.  \nAt a time when physicists were moving toward regarding energy-carrying\nfields, such as the electromagnetic field, as entities in their own\nright, combining the principle of equivalence with the “inertia\nof energy” led Einstein to the insight that fields themselves\ncould gravitate. So, for example, Einstein claims in 1907 to show that\n“radiation enclosed in a cavity possesses not only inertia but\nalso weight” (Einstein 1907b, p. 288). A more contemporary and\nfairly common way of making the same point is to say that a mirror box\nwith perfectly reflecting walls filled with light (conceived here for\nconvenience as an energy-carrying disturbance in the electromagnetic\nfield) is attracted by gravity by an amount that is greater than the\nrest mass \\(M\\) of the box itself. Specifically, if the energy of the\nlight in the box is \\(E_L\\), gravity acts on the box not as if the box\nhas a mass \\(M\\) but as if the box has a mass \\(M + E_L /c^2\\).\nAlthough the difference is numerically tiny, strictly speaking a\nbalance with an empty mirror box on one side and an identical mirror\nbox filled with light on the other would not be level.  \nConversely, Einstein also emphasized reading his famous equation\n“in the other direction,” as it were. For example, in his\nreview article from 1907, he says, “with respect to inertia, a\nmass \\(\\mu\\) is equivalent to an energy content of magnitude \\(\\mu\nc^2\\)” (Einstein 1907b, p. 287). Einstein uses the phrase\n“energy content” (translated from the original German\n“Energieinhalt”) to convey a notion that is new in special\nrelativity: A physical object contains within it energy that, at least\nin principle, could be transformed into other forms of energy such as\nkinetic energy (as we now know only too well). Because this rest\nenergy is contained within the boundaries of a body when we treat the\nobject as a whole, physicists, such as Rindler, also call it\n“internal energy” (Rindler 1991, p. 71).  \nAs Rindler suggests, it is not at all an idle or childish question to\nask: Where does all that “internal energy” reside (Rindler\n1991, p. 75)? Rindler’s answer to this question assumes that we\nwish to analyze a body all the way down to its subatomic components.\nHe explains:  \nHowever, when developing a theoretical description of a macroscopic\nobject, it is seldom practical to construct that description by\ntreating subatomic quantum objects as the fundamental constituents, as\nRindler suggests.  \nInstead, when one analyzes a physical object theoretically by looking\nat its component parts, one has to decide the level of granularity at\nwhich one wishes to analyze the object. For example, if the object we\nare analyzing is a chunk of iron, and we are studying magnetism, it\nmay be sufficient to analyze the iron by treating its magnetic domains\nas fundamental constituents. However, a magnetic domain is a chunk of\niron that contains many, many atoms. For other purposes, we may elect\nto analyze the sample of iron all the way down to the atomic level. Of\ncourse, the atoms themselves have parts. So, for yet different\npurposes, we may elect to analyze the sample of iron at the sub-atomic\nlevel of quantum objects.  \nAs Rindler’s description of where the rest energy resides makes\nclear, at each level of analysis, there are two main contributors to\nthe rest energy of the “macroscopic” sample we are\nanalyzing: (1) the energy equivalent of the sum of the rest-masses of\nthe constituent elements considered as fundamental and (2) the sum of\nthe energy “stored” or “carried” by the\nconstituent elements. To perform this kind of analysis for a concrete\nobject is a rather subtle affair. So physicists and philosophers\nwriting about mass-energy equivalence tend to focus on the highly\nidealized notion of an ideal gas.  \nFor the purposes of this kind of discussion, an ideal gas is composed\nof molecules that are treated as idealized point particles to each of\nwhich we assign a mass (i.e., a rest-mass). The molecules are treated\nas moving uniformly, i.e., with constant velocity, and as interacting\nonly in perfectly elastic collisions. Consequently, if we consider a\nsample of gas contained in a massless vessel, the only energy\n“carried” by the constituent elements is the kinetic\nenergy of the molecules.  \nWhen viewed from a Newtonian perspective, and assuming that the vessel\ncontaining the gas is itself massless, the mass of the vessel of gas\nis simply equal to the sum of the masses of the molecules. From a\nrelativistic point of view, this last assertion states\nincorrectly that the rest-mass of the vessel of gas is equal\nto the sum of the rest-masses of the molecules. Yet, from a\nrelativistic point of view, the rest-mass of the vessel of gas is\nequal to the sum of the rest-masses of the molecules plus the\nkinetic energy of the molecules divided by \\(c^2\\). Since, according\nto the Kinetic Theory of Gases, the temperature of the gas is\nproportional to the average kinetic energy of its molecules, if the\ngas temperature increases or decreases, the rest-mass of the vessel of\ngas increases or decreases accordingly by a tiny amount.  \nAssuming the principle of equivalence, which entails that we can\nmeasure inertial mass by measuring gravitational mass with a balance,\nwe can illustrate the difference between the Newtonian and\nrelativistic understanding of the ideal gas as follows. Imagine that\nwe have two otherwise identical massless vessels filled with exactly\nthe same amount and type of gas. In one vessel, the gas is at a\ntemperature very near absolute zero, so its molecules have very little\nkinetic energy. In the other vessel, the gas is at a temperature of\n500° C. Place these two vessels of gas on the ends of a balance.\nAccording to Newtonian physics, the balance will be level, because\nboth gas samples have exactly the same mass. According to relativity,\nthe balance will not be level and will be tipped on the side of the\nhot gas, because the high kinetic energy of the molecules contributes\nto the rest energy of the gas, which contributes, through\nEinstein’s equation, to the rest-mass of the vessel of gas.  \nPerhaps the most common examples used to illustrate Einstein’s\nequation concern collisions among sub-atomic objects. For our\npurposes, it is safe to treat atomic and sub-atomic objects as\nparticles involved in collisions where the total number of particles\nmay or may not be conserved. \nThe bombardment of a Lithium nucleus by protons is a historically\nsignificant and useful example for discussing mass-energy equivalence\nin collisions where the number of particles is conserved. Cockcroft\nand Walton (1932) were the first to observe the release of two\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles when a proton \\(p\\) collides with a \\({^7}\\Li\\)\nnucleus. The reaction is symbolized as follows: \nThat the number of particles is conserved in this reaction becomes\nclear when we recognize that the \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus consists of three\nprotons and four neutrons and that each \\(\\alpha\\)-particle consists\nof two protons and two neutrons. \nIn the bombardment of Lithium reaction above, the sum of the\nrest-masses of the reactants (the proton and the \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus) is\ngreater than the sum of the rest-masses of the products (the\ntwo \\(\\alpha\\)-particles). However, the total kinetic energy of the\nreactants is less than the total kinetic energy of the\nproducts. Cockcroft and Walton’s experiment is routinely\ninterpreted as demonstrating that the difference in the rest-masses of\nthe products and reactants (times \\(c^2)\\) is equal to the difference\nin the kinetic energies of the products and reactants (but see\n Section 4\n for further discussion of this experiment as a confirmation of\nmass-energy equivalence). \nDescriptions of collisions among sub-atomic particles such as the\nbombardment of Lithium make it seem as though one must admit that mass\nis converted into energy. However, influenced perhaps by the\nwidely-known discussion of mass-energy equivalence by Bondi and\nSpurgin (1987) (see\n Section 2.3.1),\n physicists now explain such reactions not as cases of mass being\nconverted into energy, but merely as cases where energy has changed\nforms. Typically, in these types of reactions, the potential energy\nthat “contributes” to the rest-mass of one (or possibly)\nmore of the reactants is transformed in a non-controversial\nway to the kinetic energy of the products. As Baierlein (2007, p. 322)\nexplains, in the case of the bombardment of \\({^7}\\Li\\) with protons and\nits subsequent decomposition into two \\(\\alpha\\)-particles, the\napparently “excess” kinetic energy of the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles did not simply “appear” out of\nnowhere. Instead, that energy was there all along as the potential and\nkinetic energy of the nucleons. In other words, one can explain the\nchange in mass and energy in the bombardment reaction by saying (i)\nthat the potential and kinetic energies of the nucleons that make up\nthe \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus contribute to its rest-mass and (ii) that the\nvast amount of energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles was not\n“created” in the reaction, or “converted” from\nmass, but was simply transformed from the various forms of energy the\nnucleons possess. \nCollisions among sub-atomic particles and their corresponding\nanti-particle are not quite so easily explained as merely involving\nthe re-arrangement of particles and re-distribution of energy. The\nmost extreme example of this sort, and one that is often used in the\nphysics literature, is pair annihilation. Consequently, let us\nconsider a collision between an electron \\(e^-\\) and a positron\n\\(e^+\\), which yields two photons \\(\\gamma\\). Symbolically, this\nannihilation reaction is written as follows: \nAccording to the currently accepted Standard Model of particle\nphysics, electrons and photons are both “fundamental\nparticles,” by which physicists mean that such particles have no\nstructure, i.e., such particles are not composed of other, smaller\nparticles. Furthermore, the photons that are the products in the\nannihilation reaction have zero rest-mass. Thus, the rest-masses of\nthe incoming electron and positron seems to “disappear”\nand an equivalent amount of energy “appears” as the energy\nof the outgoing photons. Of course, Einstein’s famous equation\nmakes all of the correct predictions concerning the relevant masses\nand energies involved in this reaction. So, for example, the total\nenergy of the two photons is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies\nof the electron and positron plus the sum of the rest-masses\nof the electron and positron multiplied by \\(c^2\\). \nFinally, although mass and energy seem to “disappear” and\n“appear” respectively when we focus on the individual\nconstituents of the physical system containing the incoming\nelectron-positron pair and the outgoing photons, the mass and\nenergy of the entire system remains the same throughout the\ninteraction. Before the collision, the rest-mass of the system is\nsimply the sum of the rest-masses of the electron and positron plus\nthe mass-equivalent of the total kinetic energy of the particles.\nConsequently, the entire system (if we draw the boundary of the system\naround the reactants and products—which is, of course, a spatial\nand temporal boundary), has a non-zero rest-mass prior to the\ncollision. However, after the collision, the system, which now\nconsists of two photons moving in non-parallel directions, also has a\nnon-zero rest-mass (for a detailed discussion concerning the rest-mass\nof systems of photons, see Taylor and Wheeler, 1992, p. 232).\n \nA common way in which the question “Why does \\(E_o\\)\nequal \\(mc^2\\)?” is interpreted by philosophers and physicists\nis that it is a request for a derivation that shows that given certain\nphysical principles, such as the principle of relativity and the\nprinciple of conservation of energy, Einstein’s equation is a\nlogical consequence of those assumptions. We will discuss briefly the\nhistory of derivation of Einstein’s equation in\n Section 3.\n  \nHowever, in this section, we wish to present a rather simplified\nversion of just one of Einstein’s derivations, published in 1946\n(Einstein 1946). We will follow closely the simplified version of\nEinstein’s 1946 derivation developed by Ralph Baierlein (1991),\nwho has used his derivation to teach Einstein’s equation to\nundergraduates who are not science majors. John Norton has used\nessentially the same simplified derivation in the Cambridge\nCompanion to Einstein (Norton 2014).  \nAs we will see, if Baierlein’s assessment of his own derivation\nis correct, the price to pay for this particular simplification is\nthat the derivation ceases to be relativistic, in the sense that none\nof the core principles at the heart of special relativity seem to be\nrequired to derive Einstein’s equation. Nevertheless, it may\nhelp readers get a “feel” for why \\(E_o = mc^2\\) and it\ndoes familiarize those not already conversant in the methods of\nrelativistic physics with a style of reasoning that is common in that\nfield. Those interested in a presentation of Einstein’s own 1946\nderivation, which explicitly shows all of the relativistic assumptions\nand key approximation steps Einstein takes, may be interested in\nconsulting the exposition by Fernflores (Fernflores 2018, vol. II,\n§3.3).  \nLike Einstein, many physicists and philosophers who wish to derive\nEinstein’s equation do so by considering an idealized physical\nconfiguration. Typically, one considers a physical object \\(B\\)\ninvolved in a symmetric physical interaction. For example, in\nEinstein’s original derivation from 1905, \\(B\\) emits two\nequally energetic pulses of light in opposite directions. Mermin and\nFeigenbaum have shown how one can also derive Einstein’s\nequation by considering the case where \\(B\\) emits two physical\nbodies, instead of pulses of light (Mermin and Feigenbaum 1990).  \nIn Einstein’s 1946 derivation, instead of emitting light, \\(B\\)\nabsorbs two equally energetic pulses of light symmetrically. The goal\nin all of these approaches is to perform a “before” and\n“after” comparison and to show that “after”\nthe body \\(B\\) absorbs or emits energy, its mass (i.e., rest-mass)\nincreases or decreases according to Einstein’s equation.  \nUsing a common heuristic in relativistic physics, one considers the\nphysical interaction first in the inertial reference frame in which\n\\(B\\) is at rest, which is sometimes called the “rest\nframe.” One then compares the mathematical description of this\ninteraction to the corresponding description from the perspective of a\ndifferent inertial reference frame that moves with a constant velocity\nrelative to the rest frame. Finally, using dynamical principles, such\nas the conservation of energy or conservation of momentum, and the two\nprinciples at the core of special relativity (i.e., the relativity\nprinciple and the light principle), one shows that the dynamical\nprinciples require that after \\(B\\) suffers the interaction in which\nit absorbs or emits energy, its mass (i.e., rest-mass) must change by\nan amount given by Einstein’s equation.  \nFrom a very general point of view, the reasoning in these types of\nderivations can be displayed schematically, if somewhat roughly, like\nthis:  \nFor a particular idealized physical interaction, if: then: \nEven at this very general level, one can see the limitations of these\napproaches. For example, since the analysis is based on a particular\nphysical interaction \\(\\boldsymbol{I}\\), one cannot immediately\nconclude that a body’s mass will change according to\nEinstein’s equation in a different type of physical interaction\nI’, for instance one in which\nelectromagnetism plays no role.  \nReasoning along these lines, Ohanian (2009, 2012) has argued that\nEinstein should not be credited with proving his famous equation. On\nthe other hand, the physicist N. David Mermin (2011, 2012) claims that\nOhanian’s demands for what counts as a “proof” in\nphysics are too stringent. Even though we are considering a very\nspecific interaction \\(\\boldsymbol{I}\\), Mermin might say, we can\nunderstand that it is such a generic situation that we can confidently\nexpect the result in all circumstances. Einstein himself believed that\nif \\(\\boldsymbol{I}\\) involved a physical process in which there was\nan interaction between an electromagnetic field (say in the form of\nlight) and an ordinary physical object, then \\(\\boldsymbol{I}\\) was\ntoo specific to support the general conclusion that in all\ncases, a change in the rest energy of a body is accompanied by a\nchange to its mass (i.e., rest-mass).  \nWith all of these caveats in place, we are almost ready to understand\nBaierlein’s derivation of Einstein’s equation. Because\nBaierlein’s derivation involves analyzing a physical interaction\nin which an object emits light, i.e., electromagnetic radiation, we\nneed first to state two dynamical properties of electromagnetic\nradiation. First, considered as an electromagnetic wave, like all\nwaves, light carries energy. This is quite familiar to us today at an\neveryday level, especially because of all the “solar”\ndevices we use. Second, light also carries momentum. As Baierlein\nreports, in the late nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell had\nalready determined that a burst of light of energy \\(E\\) had momentum\n\\(E/c\\). So, for example, if a laser beam strikes a freely-floating\nmirror in outer space, the collision of light against mirror will\nimpart a finite, non-zero momentum to the mirror. One can calculate\nexactly how the mirror will have its state of motion changed as a\nresult of this interaction by using the principle of conservation of\nmomentum.  \nBaierlein asks us to consider an atom that emits two photons of equal\nenergy “back-to-back” in opposite directions. Although\nBaierlein uses the Planck-Einstein expression \\(E = hf\\) for the\nenergy of a photon, where \\(f\\) is its frequency, and \\(h\\) is\nPlanck’s constant, as he himself points out the right-hand side\nof that expression does not figure significantly in his derivation.\nBaierlein’s derivation, he tells us, works in exactly the same\nway if we just think of an object that emits two “bursts”\nof light construed as classical electromagnetic radiation. We will\nadopt this latter approach and consider a body \\(B\\) that emits two\nbursts of light in opposite directions, each with an energy \\(E/2\\)\n(this is the approach Norton 2014 uses). The total energy emitted by\n\\(B\\) is therefore simply \\(E\\).  \nWe wish now to examine this emission of light by \\(B\\) from two\ndifferent inertial frames. The first inertial frame we consider is\nsimply the inertial frame in which \\(B\\) is at rest. Since we will not\nbe performing many calculations using quantities defined relative to\nthis inertial frame, we will label it \\(K'\\). The direction of\nmotion of the second inertial frame, which we will label \\(K\\), is\ncarefully chosen to simplify the calculations.  \nFirst, we choose \\(K'\\) so that \\(B\\) emits the two bursts of\nlight along \\(z'\\)-axis in opposite directions. We then choose\n\\(K\\) so that \\(K\\) moves with velocity \\(v\\) in the negative\ndirection along the \\(x'\\)-axis. Using standard conventions,\nthis means that an observer at rest in \\(K'\\) (Alice) judges\nthat the light emitted by \\(B\\) travels up and down the page. For an\nobserver at rest in \\(K\\) (Bob), the atom \\(B\\) moves to the right\nwith velocity \\(v\\) and the light is emitted toward the right making\nan angle \\(\\theta\\) with the \\(x\\)-axis.  \nAccording to Baierlein, “symmetry alone requires that the atom\n\\([B]\\) remain at rest in Alice’s frame” (1991, p. 170).\nIt also follows directly from this that since \\(B\\) remains at rest in\n\\(K'\\), the velocity of \\(B\\) does not change in \\(K\\) after the\nemission of light. However, as we will see shortly, the momentum of\n\\(B\\) does change in both \\(K\\) and \\(K'\\) because the light it\nemits carries away momentum. If we assume the classical definition for\nthe momentum of \\(B\\) as the product of its mass \\(m\\) and its\nvelocity \\(v\\), and \\(v\\) does not change, it follows that in order\nfor the law of conservation of momentum to be satisfied, the mass\n(i.e., rest-mass) of \\(B\\) must change.  \nLet us now examine the light emission from the perspective of the\ninertial frame \\(K\\). Relative to \\(K, B\\) moves (to the right) with\nvelocity \\(v\\). Because relative to \\(K'\\) the bursts of light\nare collinear, the \\(x\\)-component of the velocity of the light as\nmeasured in \\(K\\) must be \\(v\\). However, the velocity of the light\nalso has a vertical component, i.e., a \\(z\\)-component. This is\nsignificant, because we wish to calculate the change in the momentum\nof \\(B\\).  \nRelative to \\(K\\), the momentum of \\(B\\) only changes along the\n\\(x\\)-direction, because the changes to the momentum along the\n\\(z\\)-direction are equal and opposite. Using elementary trigonometry,\nfor one of the bursts of light, the momentum along the \\(x\\)-direction\nis:  \nSo, the total momentum of the emitted photons, relative to \\(K\\), is\nsimply:  \nwhich, by the principle of conservation of momentum, must be equal to\nthe amount of momentum lost by \\(B\\).  \nNow, since the velocity of \\(B\\) does not change (in either \\(K\\) or\n\\(K'\\)), and if we assume the classical expression for the momentum of\n\\(B\\), we have,  \nor simply,  \nFinally, since \\(E\\) is the amount of energy lost by \\(B\\) as measured\nin \\(B'\\)s rest-frame, we could more perspicuously write:  \nWe have thus shown that when \\(B\\) emits an amount of energy \\(E_o\\)\n(while remaining in its current state of inertial motion, which is a\nstate of rest relative to \\(K'\\)), the mass (i.e., rest-mass) of \\(B\\)\ndecreases by an amount \\(E_o /c^2\\).  \nRegardless of whether Ohanian (2009, 2011) is correct that\nEinstein’s own derivations do not constitute a\n“proof” of mass-energy equivalence because they consider\nphysical configurations that are too specific, a new concern arises\nwhen one considers “simplified” versions of derivations of\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) such as the one we have just reviewed. Baierlein\nconcludes his derivation by praising, as one of its merits, that it\n“requires only the ratio of momentum to energy for\nelectromagnetic radiation” (Baierlein 1991, p. 172). We have\nalready used this aspect of the derivation in our presentation above.\n \nHowever, Baierlein then goes on to state:  \nThis is a remarkable conclusion, for, if correct, it suggests that\nwhen we use this kind of simplified version of Einstein’s 1946\nderivation, we are not displaying how Einstein’s equation is a\nconsequence of special relativity. By contrast, Einstein’s own\n1946 derivation is explicitly relativistic (see Fernflores 2018, vol.\nII, Sec. 3.3).  \nAs we have seen, Einstein’s equation \\(E_o = mc^2\\) states that\nwhenever there is a change in the rest energy of an object, there is a\ncorresponding change in its mass (i.e., rest-mass). Although we have\nnot exactly demonstrated it, Einstein’s equation is also\ninterpreted as stating that any object with a non-zero mass (i.e.,\nrest-mass) possesses a rest energy (also sometimes called\n“internal energy”).  \nHowever, in relativistic mechanics, i.e., in the study of the motions\nof idealized point particles that move in accordance with the theory\nof special relativity, an object’s total energy \\(E\\), which is\ndefined as the sum of its kinetic energy and its rest energy, is given\nby the equation:  \nwhere \\(\\gamma(v)\\) is to so-called “Lorentz factor.” This\ntotal energy \\(E\\) differs from the rest energy \\(E_o\\) for any object\nthat moves with some velocity \\(v\\) relative to a given inertial\nframe. In such an inertial frame, an object will have a non-zero\nrelativistic kinetic energy and its total energy \\(E\\) is\ngiven by the equation above. In the inertial frame in which such an\nobject is at rest, however, the value of \\(\\gamma(v)\\) becomes 1 and\nthe total energy is equal to the rest energy \\(E_o\\), one might say,\nprecisely because in that inertial frame the object’s\nrelativistic kinetic energy is zero.  \nIn the early and mid twentieth century, some physicists, such as\nRichard Feynman (1963, Vol. I, Sec. 16-4), defined a new quantity,\nwhich they labelled \\(m\\) and called the “relativistic\nmass,” as the product of the rest-mass of the object, which they\nlabelled \\(m_o\\), and the Lorentz factor \\(\\gamma(v)\\) like this: \nUsing these notational conventions, the iconic equation \\(E =\nmc^2\\) is the equation for the total energy \\(E\\) of a body as a\nfunction of its relativitic mass. This equation is\nnot really of interest to us in discussing mass-energy equivalence.\nFurthermore, physicists today have generally given up this notational\nconvention and deprecate the notion of “relativistic\nmass,” which, as Griffiths quips, “has gone the way of the\ntwo dollar bill” (1999, p. 510 fn. 8).  \nThere are three main philosophical questions concerning the\ninterpretation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) that have occupied philosophers and\nphysicists: \nInterpretations of mass-energy equivalence can be organized according\nto how they answer questions (1) and (2) above (Flores 2005). As we\nwill see (in\n Section 2.5),\n interpretations that answer question (3) affirmatively assume that\nthe answer to question (1) is yes. \nThe only combination of answers to questions (1) and (2) that is\ninconsistent is to say that mass and energy are the same property of\nphysical systems but that the conversion of mass into energy (or vice\nversa) is a genuine physical process. All the other three combinations\nof answers to questions (1) and (2) are viable options and have been\nheld, at one time or another, by physicists or philosophers as\nindicated by the examples given in\n Table 2. Table 2. Interpretations of mass-energy equivalence \nIn this section, we will describe the merits and demerits of each of\nthe interpretations in\n Table 2.\n Beyond these interpretations, we will also discuss two other types of\ninterpretations of mass-energy equivalence that do not fit neatly in\n Table 2.\n First, we will discuss Lange’s (2001, 2002) interpretation,\nwhich holds that only mass is a real property of physical\nsystems and that we convert mass into energy when we shift\nthe level at which we analyze physical systems. Second, we will\ndiscuss two interpretations (one by Einstein and Infeld, 1938 and the\nother by Zahar, 1989), which we will call ontological\ninterpretations, that attempt to answer question (3) above\naffirmatively. However, we begin this section by addressing what has\nformerly been a fairly common misconception concerning mass-energy\nequivalence. \nAlthough it is far less common today, one still sometimes hears of\nEinstein’s equation entailing that matter can be converted into\nenergy. Strictly speaking, this constitutes an elementary category\nmistake. In relativistic physics, as in classical physics, mass and\nenergy are both regarded as properties of physical systems or\nproperties of the constituents of physical systems. If one wishes to\ntalk about the physical stuff that is the bearer of such\nproperties, then one typically talks about either “matter”\nor “fields.” The distinction between “matter”\nand “fields” in modern physics is itself rather subtle in\nno small part because of the equivalence of mass and energy.\nPhilosophically, to think of fields as stuff is also controversial.\n \nNevertheless, we can assert that whatever sense of\n“conversion” seems compelling between mass and energy, it\nwill have to be a “conversion” between mass and\nenergy, and not between matter and energy. Finally, our\nobservation obtains even in so-called “annihilation”\nreactions where the entire mass of the incoming particles seems to\n“disappear” (see, for example, Baierlein (2007, p. 323)). Of course, the older terminology of “matter” and\n“anti-matter” in the description of annihilation reactions\ndoes not really help our philosophical understanding of mass-energy\nequivalence and is perhaps partly to blame for some of the\nmisconceptions surrounding \\(E_o = mc^2\\). \nThe first interpretation we will consider asserts that mass and energy\nare the same property of physical systems. Consequently,\nthere is no sense in which one of the properties is ever physically\nconverted into the other. \nPhilosophers such as Torretti (1996) and physicists such as Eddington\n(1929) have adopted the same-property interpretation. For example,\nEddington states that “it seems very probable that mass and\nenergy are two ways of measuring what is essentially the same thing,\nin the same sense that the parallax and distance of a star are two\nways of expressing the same property of location” (1929, p.\n146). According to Eddington, the distinction between mass and energy\nis artificial. We treat mass and energy as different properties of\nphysical systems because we routinely measure them using different\nunits. However, one can measure mass and energy using the same units\nby choosing units in which \\(c = 1\\), i.e., units in which distances\nare measured in units of time (e.g., light-years). Once we do this,\nEddington claims, the distinction between mass and energy\ndisappears. \nLike Eddington, Torretti points out that mass and energy seem\nto be different properties because they are measured in different\nunits. Speaking against Bunge’s (1967) view that their numerical\nequivalence does not entail that mass and energy “are\nthe same thing,” Torretti explains: \nFor Torretti, the very existence of physical processes in which the\nemission of energy by an object is correlated with the decrease in the\nobject’s mass in accordance with Einstein’s equation\nspeaks strongly against the view that mass and energy are somehow\ndistinct properties of physical systems. Torretti continues: \nThus, this footnote in his masterly Relativity and Geometry\nsuggests that, for Torretti, we are misled into using different units\nfor mass and energy merely because of how we perceive space and time.\nAs we have seen, one can use the same units for mass and energy by\nadopting the convention Torretti himself uses of selecting units in\nwhich \\(c = 1\\) (pp. 88–89). However, it may be useful to\nremember that merely using the same units for spatial and temporal\nintervals does not entail that space and time are treated “on a\npar” in special relativity; they are not, as is evident from the\nsignature of the Minkwoski metric. \nThe main merit of Torretti’s view is that it takes very\nseriously the unification of space and time effected by special\nrelativity and so famously announced in the opening lines of Minkowski\n(1908). It is also consistent with how mass and energy are treated in\ngeneral relativity. \nInterpretations such as Torretti’s and Eddington’s draw no\nfurther ontological conclusions from mass-energy equivalence. For\nexample, neither Eddington nor Torretti make any explicit claim\nconcerning whether properties are best understood as universals, or\nwhether one ought to be a realist about such properties. Finally, by\nsaying that mass and energy are the same, these thinkers are\nsuggesting that the denotation of the terms “mass” and\n“energy” is the same, though they recognize that the\nconnotation of these terms is clearly different. \nAs we have displayed in\n Table 2,\n interpretations of mass-energy equivalence that hold that mass and\nenergy are different properties disagree concerning whether there is\nsome physical process by which mass is converted into energy (or vice\nversa). Although superficially Lange’s (2001, 2002)\ninterpretation seems to fall in this category, as he certainly treats\nmass and energy as different properties, he differs from others in\nthis category because Lange explicitly argues that only mass is a real\nproperty of physical systems. Consequently, we will discuss\nLange’s interpretation separately below (in\n Section 2.3.3). \nWe will begin with a discussion of Bondi and Spurgin’s\ninterpretation (in\n Section 2.3.1).\n They hold that mass and energy are distinct properties and that there\nis no such thing as the conversion of mass and energy. We will then\ndiscuss Rindler’s interpretation (in\n Section 2.3.2).\n He maintains that mass and energy are different properties but that\ngenuine conversions of mass and energy are at least permitted by\nmass-energy equivalence. \nBondi and Spurgin’s (1987) interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence has been influential especially among physicists concerned\nwith physics education. In an article where they complained about how\nstudents often misunderstand Einstein’s famous equation, Bondi\nand Spurgin argued that Einstein’s equation does not entail that\nmass and energy are the same property any more than the equation \\(m =\n\\varrho V\\) (where \\(m\\) is mass, \\(V\\) is volume, and \\(\\varrho\\) is\ndensity) entails that mass and volume are the same. Just as in the\ncase of mass and volume, Bondi and Spurgin argue, mass and energy have\ndifferent dimensions. Ultimately, this reduces to a\ndisagreement with philosophers such as Torretti who would argue that\ntime, as a dimension, is no different than any one of the spatial\ndimensions. Note well that this is not an issue about the\nunits we use for measuring mass (or energy). \nEveryone agrees that according to special relativity one can measure\nspatial intervals in units of time. We can do this because of the\npostulate of special relativity that states that the speed of light\nhas the same value in all inertial frames. If we perform what amounts\nto a substitution of variables and take our spatial dimensions to be\n\\(x_n^* = x_n /c\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light and \\(n = 1, 2,\n3\\), then we select units in which \\(c = 1\\). \nHowever, one can consistently use units in which \\(c = 1\\) and hold\nthat there is nevertheless a fundamental distinction between space and\ntime as dimensions. On such a view, which is the view that Bondi and\nSpurgin seem implicitly to be defending, while time is distinct from\nany given spatial dimension, the contingent fact that \\(c\\) has the\nsame value in all inertial frames allows us to perform the relevant\nsubstitution of variables. However, it does not follow from this that\nwe ought to treat time on a par with any spatial dimension, or that we\nought to treat the saptio-temporal interval as more fundamental (in\nthe way Torretti does). \nIn their influential article, Bondi and Spurgin then examine a variety\nof cases of purported conversions of mass and energy. In each case,\nthey show that the purported conversion of mass and energy is best\nunderstood merely as a transformation of energy. In general, Bondi and\nSpurgin argue, whenever we encounter a purported conversion of mass\nand energy, we can always explain what is taking place by looking at\nthe constituents of the physical system in the reaction and examining\nhow energy is proportioned among the constituents before and after the\nreaction takes place. \nExplanations of purported “conversions” along the lines\nsuggested by Bondi and Spurgin are now commonplace in the physics\nliterature. These explanations have the merit of emphasizing that in\nmany cases the mysteries of mass-energy equivalence do not\nconcern one physical property magically being transfigured into\nanother. However, the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence has the demerit that it fails to address reactions such as\nthe electron-positron annihilation reaction. In such reactions, not\nonly is the number of particles not conserved, but all of the\nparticles involved are, by hypothesis, indivisible wholes. Thus, the\nenergy liberated in such reactions cannot be explained as resulting\nfrom a transformation of the energy that was originally possessed by\nthe constituents of the reacting particles. Of course, Bondi and\nSpurgin may simply be hoping that physics will reveal that particles\nsuch as electrons and positrons are not indivisible wholes after all.\nIndeed, they may even use annihilation reactions combined with their\ninterpretation of mass-energy equivalence to argue that it cannot be\nthe case that such particles are indivisible. Thus, we witness here\nexplicitly just how closely related interpretations concerning\nmass-energy equivalence can be to views concerning the nature of\nmatter. \nThe second demerit of the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation, which it\nshares with all other interpretations of mass-energy equivalence that\nhold that mass and energy are different properties, is that it remains\nsilent about a central feature of physical systems it uses in\nexplaining apparent conversions of mass and energy. In order to\nexplain purported conversions along the lines suggested by\nBondi-Spurgin, one must make the familiar assumption that the energy\nof the constituents of a system, be it potential energy or kinetic\nenergy, “contributes” to the rest-mass of the system.\nThus, for example, in the bombardment of \\({^7}\\Li\\) reaction Bondi and\nSpurgin must explain the rest-mass of the \\({^7}\\Li\\) in the familiar\nway, as arising from both the sum of the rest-masses of the\nnucleons, and the mass-equivalents of their energies. However, the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation offers no explanation concerning why the\nenergy of the constituents of a physical system, be it potential\nenergy or kinetic energy, manifest itself as part of the\ninertial mass of the system as a whole. Of course, one can\nalways reply that even to ask for this type of explanation is to\nrefuse to accept relativistic thinking fully: the potential and\nkinetic energies of the constituents contributes to the rest energy of\nthe whole, and because of Einstein’s equation, contributes to\nthe rest-mass of the whole. \nAs we shall see, Rindler’s interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence attempts to address the first demerit of the Bondi-Spurgin\ninterpretation, while Lange’s interpretation brings to the\nforeground that the energy of the constituents of a physical system\n“contributes” to that system’s inertial mass. \nRindler’s interpretation of mass-energy equivalence is a\nslightly, though importantly, modified version of the Bondi-Spurgin\ninterpretation. Rindler (for example, in 1977), agrees that there are\nmany purported conversions that are best understood as mere\ntransformations of one kind of energy into a different kind of energy.\n \nHowever, for Rindler, there is nothing within special relativity\nitself that rules out the possibility that there exists fundamental,\nstructureless particles (i.e., particles that are “atomic”\nin the philosophical sense of the term). If such particles\nexist, it is possible according to Einstein’s equation that some\nor all of the mass of such particles “disappears” and an\nequivalent amount of energy “appears” within the relevant\nphysical system. Thus, Rindler seems to be suggesting that we should\nconfine our interpretation of mass-energy equivalence to what we can\ndeduce from special relativity. Thus, we should hold that\nEinstein’s equation at least allows for genuine conversions of\nmass into energy, in the sense that there may be cases where\na certain amount of inertial mass “disappears” from\nwithin a physical system and a corresponding amount of energy\n“appears.” Furthermore, in such cases we cannot explain\nthe reaction as merely involving a transformation of one kind of\nenergy into another. \nThe merit of Rindler’s interpretation is that it confines the\ninterpretation of Einstein’s equation to what we can validly\ninfer from the postulates of special relativity. Unlike the\ninterpretation proposed by Bondi and Spurgin, Rindler’s\ninterpretation makes no assumptions about the constitution of matter\nbut leaves that for future physics to determine. \nLange (2001, 2002) has suggested a rather unique interpretation of\nmass-energy equivalence. Lange begins his interpretation by arguing\nthat rest-mass is the only real property of physical systems.\nThis claim by itself suggests that there can be no such thing as a\nphysical process by which mass is converted into energy, for as Lange\nasks “in what sense can mass be converted into energy\nwhen mass and energy are not on a par in terms of their\nreality?” (2002, p. 227, emphasis in original). Lange then\ngoes on to argue that a careful analysis of purported conversions of\nmass-energy equivalence reveals that there is no physical process by\nwhich mass is ever converted into energy. Instead, Lange argues, the\napparent conversion of mass into energy (or vice versa) is an illusion\nthat arises when we shift our level of analysis in examining a\nphysical system. \nLange seems to use a familiar argument from the Lorentz invariance of\ncertain physical quantities to their “reality.” For Lange,\nif a physical quantity is not Lorentz invariant, then it is not real\nin the sense that it does not represent “the objective facts, on\nwhich all inertial frames agree” (2002, p. 209). Thus Lange\nuses Lorentz invariance as a necessary condition for the\nreality of a physical quantity. However, in several other places, for\nexample when Lange argues for the reality of the Minkowski interval\n(2002, p. 219) or when he argues for the reality of rest-mass\n(2002, p. 223), Lange implicitly uses Lorentz invariance as a\nsufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity.\nHowever, if Lange adopts Lorentz-invariance as both a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity, then he\nis committed to the view that rest energy is real for the very same\nreasons he is committed to the view that rest-mass is real. Thus,\nLange’s original suggestion that there can be no physical\nprocess of conversion between mass and energy because they have\ndifferent ontological status seems challenged. \nAs it happens, Lange’s overall position is not seriously\nchallenged by the ontological status of rest energy. Lange could\neasily grant that rest energy is a real property of physical systems\nand still argue (i) that there is no such thing as a physical process\nof conversion between mass and energy and (ii) that purported\nconversions result from shifting levels of analysis when we examine a\nphysical system. It is his observations concerning (ii) that force us\nto face again the question of why the energy of the constituents of a\nphysical system manifests itself as the mass of the system, though\nadmittedly the question itself may simply reveal a failure fully to\nappreciate a relativistic description of composite systems.  \nOne of the main examples that Lange uses to present his interpretation\nof mass-energy equivalence is the heating of an ideal gas, which we\nhave already considered above (see\n Section 1.3).\n He also considers examples involving reactions among sub-atomic\nparticles that, for our purposes, are very similar in the relevant\nrespects to the example we have discussed concerning the bombardment\nand subsequent decomposition of a \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus. In both cases,\nLange essentially adopts the minimal interpretation we discussed in\n Section 1.3.\n In the case of the ideal gas, as we have seen, when the gas sample is\nheated and its inertial mass concurrently increases, this increase in\nrest-mass is not a result of the gas somehow being suddenly (or\ngradually) composed of molecules that are themselves more massive. The\nrest-mass of any individual molecule does not change. It is also not a\nresult of the gas suddenly (or gradually) containing more molecules.\nInstead, the increased kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas\nconstitutes an increase to the rest energy of the gas sample which,\nthrough Einstein’s equation, manifests as an increase in the gas\nsample’s inertial mass. Lange summarizes this feature of the\nincrease in the gas sample’s inertial mass by saying: \nUnfortunately, Lange’s characterization threatens to leave\nreaders with the impression that if “we” had not shifted\nour perspective in the analysis of the gas, no change to the inertial\nmass of the gas sample would have ensued. Of course, it is unlikely\nthat Lange means this. Lange would likely agree that even if no human\nbeings are around to analyze a gas sample, the gas sample will respond\nin any physical interaction differently as a whole after it\nhas absorbed some energy precisely because its inertial mass will have\nincreased. \nThe merits of Lange’s view concerning the\n“conversion” of mass-energy equivalence are essentially\nthe same as the merits of both the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation and\nRindler’s interpretation. All these interpretations agree that\nthere are important cases where we have now learned enough to assert\nconfidently that purported “conversions” of mass and\nenergy are merely cases where energy of one kind is transformed into\nenergy of another kind. Aside from the comparatively minor issue\nconcerning the “reality” of rest energy, the main demerit\nof Lange’s view is that it might potentially mislead\nunsuspecting readers. \nThe relationship between mass-energy equivalence and hypotheses\nconcerning the nature of matter is twofold. First, as we have\nsuggested, some of the interpretations of mass-energy equivalence seem\nto assume implicitly certain features of matter. Second, some\nphilosophers and physicists, notably Einstein and Infeld (1938) and\nZahar (1989), have argued that mass-energy equivalence has\nconsequences concerning the nature of matter. In this\nsection, we will discuss the first of these two relationships between\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) and hypotheses concerning the nature of matter. We\ndiscuss the second relationship in the next section\n (Section 2.5). \nTo explain how some interpretations of mass-energy equivalence rest on\nassumptions concerning the nature of matter, we need first to\nrecognize, as several authors have pointed out, e.g., Rindler (1977),\nStachel and Torretti (1982), and Mermin and Feigenbaum (1990), that\nthe relation one actually derives from the special relativity is: \nwhere \\(K\\) is merely an additive factor that fixes the zero-point of\nenergy and is conventionally set to zero and \\(q\\) is also routinely\nset to zero. However, unlike the convention to set \\(K\\) to zero,\nsetting \\(q = 0\\) involves a hypothesis concerning the nature of\nmatter, because it rules out the possibility that there exists matter\nthat has mass but which is such that some of its mass can never be\n“converted” into energy. \nThe same-property interpretation of mass-energy equivalence rests\nsquarely on the assumption that \\(q = 0\\). Mass and energy cannot be\nthe same property if there exists matter that has mass some of which\ncannot ever, under any conditions, be “converted” into\nenergy. However, one could argue that although the same-property\ninterpretation makes this assumption, it is not an\nunjustified assumption. Currently, physicists do not have any\nevidence that there exists matter for which \\(q\\) is not equal to\nzero. Nevertheless, it seems important, from a philosophical point of\nview, to recognize that the same-property interpretation depends not\nonly on what one can derive from the postulates of special relativity,\nbut also on evidence from “outside” this theory. \nInterpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) that hold that mass and energy are\ndistinct properties of physical systems need not, of course, assume\nthat \\(q\\) is different from zero. Such interpretations can simply\nleave the value of \\(q\\) to be determined empirically, for as we have\nseen such interpretations argue for treating mass and energy as\ndistinct properties on different grounds. Nevertheless, the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation does seem to adopt implicitly a\nhypothesis concerning the nature of matter. \nAccording to Bondi and Spurgin, all purported conversions of mass and\nenergy are cases where one type of energy is transformed into another\nkind of energy. This in turn assumes that we can, in all cases,\nunderstand a reaction by examining the constituents of physical\nsystems. If we focus on reactions involving sub-atomic particles, for\nexample, Bondi and Spurgin seem to assume that we can always explain\nsuch reactions by examining the internal structure of sub-atomic\nparticles. However, if we ever find good evidence to support the view\nthat some particles have no internal structure, as it now\nseems to be the case with electrons for example, then we either have\nto give up the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation or use the interpretation\nitself to argue that such seemingly structureless particles actually\ndo contain an internal structure. Thus, it seems that the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation assumes something like the infinite\ndivisibility of matter, which is clearly a hypothesis that lies\n“outside” special relativity. \nEinstein and Infeld (1938) and Zahar (1989) have both argued that\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) has ontological consequences. Both of the\nEinstein-Infeld and Zahar interpretations begin by adopting the\nsame-property interpretation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\). Thus,\naccording to both interpretations, mass and energy are the same\nproperties of physical systems. Furthermore, both the Einstein-Infeld\nand Zahar interpretations use a rudimentary distinction between\n“matter” and “fields.” According to this\nsomewhat dated distinction, classical physics includes two fundamental\nsubstances: matter, by which one means ponderable material stuff, and\nfields, by which one means physical fields such as the electromagnetic\nfield. For both Einstein and Infeld and Zahar, matter and fields in\nclassical physics are distinguished by the properties they bear.\nMatter has both mass and energy, whereas fields only have energy.\nHowever, since the equivalence of mass and energy entails that mass\nand energy are really the same physical property after all, say\nEinstein and Infeld and Zahar, one can no longer distinguish between\nmatter and fields, as both now have both mass and energy. \nAlthough both Einstein and Infeld and Zahar use the same basic\nargument, they reach slightly different conclusions. Zahar argues that\nmass-energy equivalence entails that the fundamental stuff of physics\nis a sort of “I-know-not-what” that can manifest itself as\neither matter or field. Einstein and Infeld, on the other hand, in\nplaces seem to argue that we can infer that the fundamental stuff of\nphysics is fields. In other places, however, Einstein and Infeld seem\na bit more cautious and suggest only that one can construct a physics\nwith only fields in its ontology. \nThe demerits of either ontological interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence are that it rests upon the same-property\ninterpretation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\). As we have discussed above (see\n Section 2.4),\n while one can adopt the same-property\ninterpretation, to do so one must make additional assumptions\nconcerning the nature of matter. Furthermore, the ontological\ninterpretation rests on what nowadays seems like a rather crude\ndistinction between “matter” and “fields.” To\nbe sure, mass-energy equivalence has figured prominently in\nphysicists’ conception of matter in no small part because it\ndoes open up the door to a description of what we ordinarily regard as\nponderable matter in terms of fields, since the energy of the field at\none level can manifest itself as mass one level up. However, the\ninference from mass-energy equivalence to the fundamental ontology of\nmodern physics seems far more subtle than either Enstein and Infeld or\nZahar suggest. \nEinstein first derived mass-energy equivalence from the principles of\nspecial relativity in a small article titled “Does the Inertia\nof a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?” (1905b). This\nderivation, along with others that followed soon after (e.g., Planck\n(1906), Von Laue (1911)), uses Maxwell’s theory of\nelectromagnetism. (See\n Section 3.1.)\n However, as Einstein later observed (1935), mass-energy equivalence\nis a result that should be independent of any theory that describes a\nspecific physical interaction. This is the main reason that led\nphysicists to search for “purely dynamical” derivations,\ni.e., derivations that invoke only mechanical concepts such as energy\nand momentum, and the conservation principles that govern them. (See\n Section 3.2) \nEinstein’s original derivation of mass-energy equivalence is the\nbest known in this group. Einstein begins with the following\nthought-experiment: a body at rest (in some inertial frame) emits two\npulses of light of equal energy in opposite directions. Einstein then\nanalyzes this “act of emission” from another inertial\nframe, which is in a state of uniform motion relative to the first. In\nthis analysis, Einstein uses Maxwell’s theory of\nelectromagnetism to calculate the physical properties of the light\npulses (such as their intensity) in the second inertial frame. By\ncomparing the two descriptions of the “act of emission”,\nEinstein arrives at his celebrated result: “the mass of a body\nis a measure of its energy-content; if the energy changes by \\(L\\),\nthe mass changes in the same sense by \\(L/9 \\times 10^{20}\\), the\nenergy being measured in ergs, and the mass in grammes” (1905b,\np. 71). A similar derivation using the same thought experiment\nbut appealing to the Doppler effect was given by Langevin (1913) (see\nthe discussion of the inertia of energy in Fox (1965, p. 8)).\n \nSome philosophers and historians of science claim that\nEinstein’s first derivation is fallacious. For example, in\nThe Concept of Mass, Jammer says: “It is a curious\nincident in the history of scientific thought that Einstein’s\nown derivation of the formula \\(E = mc^2\\), as published in his\narticle in Annalen der Physik, was basically fallacious. . .\n  the result of a petitio principii, the conclusion\nbegging the question” (Jammer, 1961, p. 177). According to\nJammer, Einstein implicitly assumes what he is trying to prove, viz.,\nthat if a body emits an amount of energy \\(L\\), its inertial mass will\ndecrease by an amount \\(\\Delta m = L/c^2\\). Jammer also accuses\nEinstein of assuming the expression for the relativistic kinetic\nenergy of a body. If Einstein made these assumptions, he would be\nguilty of begging the question. However, Stachel and Torretti (1982)\nhave shown convincingly that Einstein’s (1905b) argument is\nsound. They note that Einstein indeed derives the expression for the\nkinetic energy of an “electron” (i.e., a structureless\nparticle with a net charge) in his earlier (1905a) paper. However,\nEinstein nowhere uses this expression in the (1905b) derivation of\nmass-energy equivalence. Stachel and Torretti also show that\nEinstein’s critics overlook two key moves that are sufficient to\nmake Einstein’s derivation sound, since one need not assume that\n\\(\\Delta m = L/c^2\\). \nEinstein’s further conclusion that “the mass of a body is\na measure of its energy content” (1905b, p. 71) does not,\nstrictly speaking, follow from his argument. As Torretti (1996) and\nother philosophers and physicists have observed, Einstein’s\n(1905b) argument allows for the possibility that once a body’s\nenergy store has been entirely used up (and subtracted from the mass\nusing the mass-energy equivalence relation) the remainder is not zero.\nIn other words, it is only an hypothesis in Einstein’s (1905b)\nargument, and indeed in all derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) in special\nrelativity, that no “exotic matter” exists that is\nnot convertible into energy (see Ehlers, Rindler, Penrose,\n(1965) for a discussion of this point). However, particle-antiparticle\nanihilation experiments in atomic physics, which were first observed\ndecades after 1905, strongly support “Einstein’s dauntless\nextrapolation” (Torretti, 1996, p. 112). \nIn general, derivations in this group use the same style of reasoning.\nOne typically begins by considering an object that either absorbs or\nemits electromagnetic radiation (typically light) of total energy\n\\(E_o\\) in equal and opposite directions. Because light carries both\nenergy and momentum, one then uses the conservation principles for\nthose quantities and the standard heuristic in relativity of\nconsidering the same physical process from two different inertial\nframes that are in a state of relative motion to show that in order\nfor the conservation principles to be satisfied, the mass (i.e.,\nrest-mass) of the emitting or absorbing object must increase or\ndecrease by an amount \\(E_o /c^2\\). For a more detailed description of\na simplified derivation in this group, see\n Section 1.5\n  \nOne of the few exceptions to this approach among derivations that use\nMaxwell’s theory is Einstein’s 1906 derivation (Einstein\n1906). In this derivation, Einstein considers a freely-floating box. A\nburst of electromagnetic radiation of energy \\(E_o\\) is emitted inside\nthe box from one wall toward a parallel wall. Einstein shows that the\nprinciple of mechanics that says that the motion of the center of mass\nof a body cannot change merely because of changes inside the body\nwould be violated if one did not attribute an inertial mass \\(E_o\n/c^2\\) to the burst of electromagnetic radiation (see Taylor and\nWheeler 1992, p. 254 for a detailed discussion of this example).  \nPurely dynamical derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) typically proceed by\nanalyzing an inelastic collision from the point of view of two\ninertial frames in a state of relative motion (the centre-of-mass\nframe, and an inertial frame moving with a relative velocity \\(v)\\).\nOne of the first papers to appear following this approach is\nPerrin’s (1932). According to Rindler and Penrose (1965),\nPerrin’s derivation was based largely on Langevin’s\n“elegant” lectures, which were delivered at the\nCollège de France in Zurich around 1922. Einstein himself gave\na purely dynamical derivation (Einstein, 1935), though he nowhere\nmentions either Langevin or Perrin. The most comprehensive derivation\nof this sort was given by Ehlers, Rindler and Penrose (1965). More\nrecently, a purely dynamical version of Einstein’s original\n(1905b) thought experiment, where the particles that are emitted are\nnot photons, has been given by Mermin and Feigenbaum (1990) and Mermin\n(2005). \nDerivations in this group are distinctive because they demonstrate\nthat mass-energy equivalence is a consequence of the changes to the\nstructure of spacetime brought about by special relativity. The\nrelationship between mass and energy is independent of Maxwell’s\ntheory or any other theory that describes a specific physical\ninteraction. We can get a glimpse of this by noting that to derive\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) by analyzing a collision, one must first define the\nfour-momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\), the “space-part” of which is\nrelativistic momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}_{\\rel}\\), and relativistic kinetic\nenergy \\(T_{\\rel}\\), since one cannot use the old Newtonian notions of\nmomentum and kinetic energy.  \nIn Einstein’s own purely dynamical derivation (1935), more than\nhalf of the paper is devoted to finding the mathematical expressions\nthat define \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\). This much work is required\nto arrive at these expressions for two reasons. First, the changes to\nthe structure of spacetime must be incorporated into the definitions\nof the relativistic quantities. Second, \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\)\nmust be defined so that they reduce to their Newtonian counterparts in\nthe appropriate limit. This last requirement ensures, in effect, that\nspecial relativity will inherit the empirical success of Newtonian\nphysics. Once the definitions of \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\) are\nobtained, one derives mass-energy equivalence in a straight-forward\nway by analyzing a collision. (For a more detailed discussion of\nEinstein’s (1935), see Fernflores, 2018.) \nAt a very general level, purely dynamical derivations of\nEinstein’s equation and derivations that appeal to\nMaxwell’s theory really follow the same approach. In both styles\nof derivations, although it may not seem like it at first glance, we\nare dealing with one of the most basic dynamical interactions: a\ncollision. So, for example, we can construe the physical configuration\nof Einstein’s original 1905 derivation (Einstein 1905b) as a\ncollision in which the total number of objects is not conserved. This\nis even easier to do if one adopts a “particle”\ndescription of light. In both the purely dynamical derivations and the\nderivations that appeal to an interaction with electromagnetic\nradiation, one then examines the collision in question and shows that\nin order for dynamical principles to be satisfied, the relationship\namong the masses and energies of the objects involved in the\ncollisions must satsify Einstein’s equation.  \nThe main difference between the two approaches to deriving\nEinstein’s equation is that in derivations that consider a\ncollision with light, one must use the dynamical properties of light,\nwhich are not themselves described by special relativity. For example,\nas we have seen, in Einstein’s 1946 derivation (see\n Section 1.5),\n we must appeal to the expression for the momentum of a burst of\nlight.  \nCockcroft and Walton (1932) are routinely credited with the first\nexperimental verification of mass-energy equivalence. Cockcroft and\nWalton examined a variety of reactions where different atomic nulcei\nare bombarded by protons. They focussed their attention primarily on\nthe bombardment of \\({^7}\\Li\\) by protons (see\n Section 1.4). \nIn their famous paper, Cockcroft and Walton noted that the sum of the\nrest-masses of the proton and the Lithium nucleus (i.e., the\nreactants) was \\(1.0072 + 7.0104 = 8.0176\\) amu. However, the sum of\nthe rest-masses of the two \\(\\alpha\\)-particles (i.e., the products)\nwas 8.0022 amu. Thus, it seems as if an amount of mass of 0.0154 amu\nhas “disappeared” from the reactants. Cockcroft and Walton\nalso observed that the total energy (in the reference frame in which\nthe \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus is at rest) for the reactants was 125 KeV.\nHowever, the total kinetic energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles was\nobserved to be 17.2 MeV. Thus, it seems as if an amount of energy of\napproximately 17 MeV has “appeared” in the reaction. \nImplicitly referring to the equivalence of mass and energy, without\nexplicitly mentioning either the result or Einstein by name, Cockcroft\nand Walton then simply assert that a mass 0.0154 amu “is\nequivalent to an energy liberation of \\((14.3 \\pm 2.7) \\times 10^6\\)\nVolts” (p. 236). They then implicitly suggest that this\ninferred value for the kinetic energy of the two resulting\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles is consistent with the observed value\nfor the kinetic energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles. Cockcroft and\nWalton conclude that “the observed energies of the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles are consistent with our hypothesis”\n(pp. 236–237). The hypothesis they set out to test,\nhowever, is not mass-energy equivalence, but rather than when a\n\\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus is bombarded with protons, the result is two\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles. \nStuewer (1993) has suggested that Cockcroft and Walton use\nmass-energy equivalence to confirm their hypothesis about what happens\nwhen \\({^7}\\Li\\) is bombarded by protons. Hence, it does not seem we\nought to regard this experiment as a confirmation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\).\nHowever, if we take some of the other evidence that Cockcroft and\nWalton provide concerning the identification of the products in the\nbombardment reaction as sufficient to establish that the products are\nindeed \\(\\alpha\\)-particles, then we can interpret this experiment as\na confirmation of mass-energy equivalence, which is how this\nexperiment is often reported in the physics literature. \nMore recently, Rainville et al. (2005) have published the results\nof what they call “A direct test of \\(E = mc^2\\).” Their\nexperiments test mass-energy equivalence “directly” by\ncomparing the difference in the rest-masses in a neutron capture\nreaction with the energy of the emitted \\(\\gamma\\)-rays. Specifically,\nRainville et al. examine two reactions, one involving neutron capture\nby Sulphur \\((\\S)\\), the other involving neutron capture by Silicon\n\\((\\Si)\\): \nIn these reactions, when the nucleus of an atom (in this case either\n\\({^{32}}\\S\\) or \\({^{28}}\\Si)\\) captures the neutron, a new isotope is\ncreated in an excited state. In returning to its ground state, the\nisotope emits a \\(\\gamma\\)-ray. According to Einstein’s\nequation, the difference in the rest-masses of the neutron plus\nnucleus, on the one hand, and the new isotope in its ground state on\nthe other hand, should be equal to the energy of the emitted photon.\nThus, Rainville et al. test \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta mc^2\\) by making very\naccurate measurements of the rest-mass difference and the frequency,\nand hence energy, of the emitted photon. Rainville et al. report that\ntheir measurements show that Einstein’s equation obtains to an\naccuracy of at least 0.00004%. \nIn this entry, we have presented the physics of mass-energy\nequivalence as widely understood by both physicists and philosophers.\nWe have also canvassed a variety of philosophical interpretations of\nmass-energy equivalence. Along the way, we have presented the merits\nand demerits of each interpretation. We have also presented a brief\nhistory of derivations of mass-energy equivalence to emphasize that\nthe equivalence of mass and energy is a direct result to changes to\nthe structure of spacetime imposed by special relativity. Finally, we\nhave briefly and rather selectively discussed the empirical\nconfirmation of mass-energy equivalence.","contact.mail":"ffernflo@calpoly.edu","contact.domain":"calpoly.edu"}]
