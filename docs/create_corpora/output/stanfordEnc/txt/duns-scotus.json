His\nbrilliantly complex and nuanced thought, which earned him the nickname\n“the Subtle Doctor,” left a mark on discussions of such disparate\ntopics as the semantics of religious language, the problem of\nuniversals, divine illumination, and the nature of human freedom. This\nessay first lays out what is known about Scotus’s life and the dating\nof his works. It then offers an overview of some of his key positions\nin four main areas of philosophy: natural theology, metaphysics, the\ntheory of knowledge, and ethics and moral psychology. \n\n\n\n\n‘Scotus’ identifies Scotus as a Scot.  His family name was\nDuns, which was also the name of the Scottish village in which he was\nborn, just a few miles from the English border.  We do not know the\nprecise date of his birth, but we do know that Scotus was ordained to\nthe priesthood in the Order of Friars Minor—the\nFranciscans—at Saint Andrew’s Priory in Northampton, England, on\n17 March 1291. The minimum age for ordination was twenty-five, so we\ncan conclude that Scotus was born before 17 March 1266. But how much\nbefore? The conjecture, plausible but by no means certain, is that\nScotus would have been ordained as early as canonically permitted.\nSince the Bishop of Lincoln (the diocese that included Oxford, where\nScotus was studying, as well as St Andrew’s Priory) had ordained\npriests in Wycombe on 23 December 1290, we can place Scotus’s birth\nbetween 23 December 1265 and 17 March 1266. \n\nScotus studied philosophy and then theology at Oxford beginning some\ntime in the 1280s. In the academic year 1298–99 he commented on\nthe first two books of the Sentences of Peter Lombard. Scotus\nleft Oxford for Paris, probably in 1302, and began lecturing on\nthe Sentences again (we think in the order Book I, Book IV,\nBook II, Book III).  In June 1303 Scotus was expelled from France\nalong with eighty other friars for taking Pope Boniface VIII’s side in\na dispute with King Philip IV of France.  After Boniface died in\nOctober 1303 the king allowed the exiled students and masters to\nreturn, so Scotus could have returned in the late fall of 1303 to\nresume his lectures on the Sentences.  Scotus became Doctor\nof Theology in 1305 and was Franciscan regent master at Paris in\n1306–07. He was transferred to the Franciscan studium\nat Cologne, probably beginning his duties as lector in October\n1307. He died there in 1308; the date of his death is traditionally\ngiven as 8 November. \n\nIt is generally agreed that Scotus’s earliest works were his\ncommentaries on the Old Logic: questions on\nPorphyry’s Isagoge and Aristotle’s Categories, two\nsets of questions on Peri hermeneias, and De sophisticis\nelenchis. These probably date to around 1295; the Quaestiones\nsuper De anima is also very likely an early work (the editors\ndate it to the late 1280s or early 1290s). Scotus’s other Aristotelian\ncommentary, the Quaestiones super libros Metaphysicorum\nAristotelis, seems to have been started early; but Books VI\nthrough IX are all late or were at least revised later in Scotus’s\ncareer.  Scotus also wrote an Expositio on\nAristotle’s Metaphysics.  It had been unidentified for\ncenturies but was recently identified and edited by Giorgio Pini. \n\nThings really get complicated when we come to Scotus’s commentaries on\nthe four books of Sentences of Peter Lombard, since he\ncommented on the Sentences more than once and revised his\nlectures over a long period; the relations among the various versions\nthat have come down to us are not always clear. Certainly\nthe Lectura presents us with Scotus’s Oxford lectures on\nBooks I and II of the Sentences in 1298–99. There is an\nOrdinatio (i.e., a version prepared for publication by the\nauthor himself) of lectures at Oxford, based in part on the\nLectura and on material from his lectures in Paris. The\nOrdinatio, which Scotus seems to have been revising up to his\ndeath, is generally taken to be Scotus’s premier work; the critical\nedition was at last completed in 2013. Finally, Scotus lectured on the\nSentences at Paris, and there are various\nReportationes of these lectures.  A critical edition is in\nprogress; at present we have a transcription of a reasonably reliable\nmanuscript of Book I.  Although the Paris lectures themselves were\nlater than the Oxford lectures, it seems probable that parts of\nthe Ordinatio—Book IV and perhaps also Book\nIII—are later than the corresponding parts of\nthe Reportatio. \n\nIn addition to these works, we have 46 short disputations called\nCollationes dating from 1300–1305, a late work in natural\ntheology called De primo principio, and Quaestiones\nQuodlibetales from Scotus’s days as regent master (either Advent\n1306 or Lent 1307). Finally, there is a work called\nTheoremata.  Though doubts have been raised about its\nauthenticity, the recent critical edition accepts it as a genuine work\nof Scotus. \n\nNatural theology is, roughly, the effort to establish the existence\nand nature of God by arguments that in no way depend on the contents of\na purported revelation. But is it even possible for human\nbeings to come to know God apart from revelation? Scotus certainly\nthinks so. Like any good Aristotelian, he thinks all our knowledge\nbegins in some way with our experience of sensible things. But he is\nconfident that even from such humble beginnings we can come to grasp\nGod. \n\nScotus agrees with Thomas Aquinas that all our knowledge of God\nstarts from creatures, and that as a result we can only prove the\nexistence and nature of God by what the medievals call an argument\nquia (reasoning from effect to cause), not by an argument\npropter quid (reasoning from essence to characteristic).\nAquinas and Scotus further agree that, for that same reason, we cannot\nknow the essence of God in this life. The main difference between the\ntwo authors is that Scotus believes we can apply certain predicates\nunivocally—with exactly the same meaning—to God and creatures,\nwhereas Aquinas insists that this is impossible, and that we can only\nuse analogical predication, in which a word as applied to God has a\nmeaning different from, although related to, the meaning of that same\nword as applied to creatures. (See\n medieval theories of analogy\n for\ndetails.) \n\nScotus has a number of arguments for univocal predication and\nagainst the doctrine of analogy (Ordinatio 1, d. 3, pars 1, q.\n1–2, nn. 26–55). One of the most compelling uses Aquinas’s own view\nagainst him. Aquinas had said that all our concepts come from\ncreatures. Scotus says, very well, where will that analogous concept\ncome from? It can’t come from anywhere. If all our concepts come from\ncreatures (and Scotus doesn’t deny this), then the concepts we apply to\nGod will also come from creatures. They won’t just be like the\nconcepts that come from creatures, as in analogous predication; they\nwill have to be the very same concepts that come from\ncreatures, as in univocal predication. Those are the only concepts we\ncan have—the only concepts we can possibly get. So if we can’t use\nthe concepts we get from creatures, we can’t use any concepts at all,\nand so we can’t talk about God—which is false. \n\nAnother argument for univocal predication is based on an argument\nfrom Anselm. Consider all predicates, Anselm says. Now get rid of the\nones that are merely relatives, since no relative expresses the nature\nof a thing as it is in itself. (So we’re not talking about such\npredicates as “supreme being” or “Creator,” since even though those\nproperly apply to God, they don’t tell us anything about what God is in\nhimself, only about how he is related to other things.) Now take the\npredicates that are left. Here’s the test. Let F be our\npredicate-variable. For any F, either \n(a) It is in every respect better to be F than not\nto be F. \n\n\n~or~\n\n(b) It is in some respect better to be not-F than\nF.\n \n\nA predicate will fall into the second category if and only if it\nimplies some sort of limitation or deficiency. Anselm’s argument is\nthat we can (indeed must) predicate of God every predicate that falls\ninto the first category, and that we cannot predicate of God any\npredicate that falls into the second (except metaphorically, perhaps).\nScotus agrees with Anselm on this point (as did Aquinas: see\nSCG I.30). Scotus has his own terminology for whatever it is\nin every respect better to be than not to be. He calls such things\n“pure perfections” (perfectiones simpliciter). A pure\nperfection is any predicate that does not imply limitation. \n\nSo Scotus claims that pure perfections can be predicated of God. But\nhe takes this a step further than Anselm. He says that they have to be\npredicated univocally of God; otherwise the whole business of\npure perfections won’t make any sense. Here’s the argument. If we are\ngoing to use Anselm’s test, we must first come up with our\nconcept—say, of good. Then we check out the concept to see\nwhether it is in every respect better to be good than not-good. We\nrealize that it is, and so we predicate ‘good’ of\nGod. That test obviously won’t work unless it’s the same concept that\nwe’re applying in both cases. \n\nOne can see this more clearly by considering the two possible ways\nin which one might deny that the same concept is applied to both God\nand creatures. One might say that the concept of the pure perfection\napplies only to creatures, and the concept we apply to God has to be\nsomething different; or one might try it the other way around and say\nthat the concept of the pure perfection applies only to God, and the\nconcept we apply to creatures has to be something different. Take the\nfirst possibility. If we come up with the idea of a pure perfection\nfrom creatures and don’t apply the same concept to God, we’re saying\nthat we can come up with something that is in every respect better to\nbe than not to be, but it doesn’t apply to God. Such a view would\ndestroy the idea that God is the greatest and most perfect being. So\nthen one might try the second possibility: the concept of the pure\nperfection really applies only to God. Scotus points out that that\ncan’t be right either. For then the perfection we apply to creatures\nwon’t be the pure perfection any more, and so the creature wouldn’t be\nbetter off for having this pseudo-perfection. But the whole way in\nwhich we came up with the idea of the pure perfection in the first\nplace was by considering perfections in creatures—in other words, by\nconsidering what features made creatures better in every respect. So\nthis possibility gets the test backwards: it says that we have to start\nwith knowing what features God has and thereby determining what is a\npure perfection, but in fact we first figure out what the pure\nperfections are and thereby know what features God has. \n\nNot only can we come up with concepts that apply univocally to God\nand creatures, we can even come up with a proper (distinctive)\nconcept of God. Now in one sense we can’t have a proper concept of God\nin this life, since we can’t know his essence as a particular thing. We\nknow God in the way that we know, say, a person we have heard about but\nhave never met. That is, we know him through general concepts that can\napply both to him and to other things. In another sense, though, we can\nhave a proper concept of God, that is, one that applies only to God. If\nwe take any of the pure perfections to the highest degree, they will be\npredicable of God alone. Better yet, we can describe God more\ncompletely by taking all the pure perfections in the highest degree and\nattributing them all to him. \n\nBut these are all composite concepts; they all involve putting two\nquite different notions together: ‘highest’ with\n‘good’, ‘first’ with ‘cause’, and\nso on. Scotus says that we can come up with a relatively\nsimple concept that is proper to God alone, the concept of\n“infinite being.” Now that concept might seem to be every\nbit as composite as “highest good” or “first\ncause,” but it’s really not. For “infinite being” is\na concept of something essentially one: a being that has infinity\n(unlimitedness) as its intrinsic way of existing. I will return to the\ncrucial role of the concept of infinite being in Scotus’s natural\ntheology after I examine his proof of the existence of God. \n\nScotus’s argument for the existence of God is rightly regarded as\none of the most outstanding contributions ever made to natural\ntheology. The argument is enormously complex, with several\nsub-arguments for almost every important conclusion, and I can only\nsketch it here. (Different versions of the proof are given at\nLectura 1, d. 2, q. 1, nn. 38–135; Ordinatio 1, d. 2,\nq. 1, nn. 39–190; Reportatio 1, d. 2, q. 1; and De primo\nprincipio.) \n\nScotus begins by arguing that there is a first agent (a being that\nis first in efficient causality). Consider first the distinction\nbetween essentially ordered causes and accidentally ordered causes. In\nan accidentally ordered series, the fact that a given member of that\nseries is itself caused is accidental to that member’s own causal\nactivity. For example, Grandpa A generates a son, Dad B, who in turn\ngenerates a son of his own, Grandson C. B’s generating C in no way\ndepends on A—A could be long dead by the time B starts having\nchildren. The fact that B was caused by A is irrelevant to B’s own\ncausal activity. That’s how an accidentally ordered series of causes\nworks. \n\nIn an essentially ordered series, by contrast, the causal activity\nof later members of the series depends essentially on the causal\nactivity of earlier members. For example, my shoulders move my arms,\nwhich in turn move my golf club. My arms are capable of moving the golf\nclub only because they are being moved by my shoulders. \n\nWith that distinction in mind, we can examine Scotus’s argument for\nthe existence of a first efficient cause: \n\nScotus then goes on to argue that there is an ultimate goal of\nactivity (a being that is first in final causality), and a maximally\nexcellent being (a being that is first in what Scotus calls\n“pre-eminence”). \n\nThus he has proved what he calls the “triple primacy”: there is a\nbeing that is first in efficient causality, in final causality, and in\npre-eminence. Scotus next proves that the three primacies are\ncoextensive: that is, any being that is first in one of these three\nways will also be first in the other two ways. Scotus then argues that\na being enjoying the triple primacy is endowed with intellect and will,\nand that any such being is infinite. Finally, he argues that there can\nbe only one such being. \n\nIn laying out Scotus’s proof of the existence of God, I passed\nrather quickly over the claim that God is infinite. But the divine\ninfinity deserves more detailed treatment. As we have already seen, the\nconcept of “infinite being” has a privileged role in Scotus’s natural\ntheology. As a first approximation, we can say that divine infinity is\nfor Scotus what divine simplicity is for Aquinas. It’s the central\ndivine-attribute generator. But there are some important differences\nbetween the role of simplicity in Aquinas and the role of infinity in\nScotus. The most important, I think, is that in Aquinas simplicity acts\nas an ontological spoilsport for theological semantics. Simplicity is\nin some sense the key thing about God, metaphysically speaking, but it\nseriously complicates our language about God. God is supposed to be a\nsubsistent simple, but because our language is all derived from\ncreatures, which are all either subsistent but complex or simple but\nnon-subsistent, we don’t have any way to apply our language\nstraightforwardly to God. The divine nature systematically resists\nbeing captured in language. \n\nFor Scotus, though, infinity is not only what’s ontologically\ncentral about God; it’s the key component of our best available concept\nof God and a guarantor of the success of theological language. That is,\nour best ontology, far from fighting with our theological semantics,\nboth supports and is supported by our theological semantics. The\ndoctrine of univocity rests in part on the claim that “[t]he difference\nbetween God and creatures, at least with regard to God’s possession of\nthe pure perfections, is ultimately one of degree” (Cross [1999], 39).\nRemember one of Scotus’s arguments for univocity. If we are to follow\nAnselm in ascribing to God every pure perfection, we have to affirm\nthat we are ascribing to God the very same thing that we\nascribe to creatures: God has it infinitely, creatures in a limited\nway. One could hardly ask for a more harmonious cooperation between\nontology (what God is) and semantics (how we can think and talk about\nhim). \n\nScotus ascribes to Aquinas the following argument for the divine\ninfinity: If a form is limited by matter, it is finite. God, being\nsimple, is not limited by matter. Therefore, God is not finite. This,\nas Scotus points out, is a fallacious argument. (It’s an instance of\ndenying the antecedent.) But even apart from the fallacy, simplicity\nis not going to get us infinity. As Scotus puts it: “if an\nentity is finite or infinite, it is so not by reason of something\naccidental to itself, but because it has its own intrinsic degree of\nfinite or infinite perfection” (Ordinatio 1, d. 1, pars\n1, q. 1–2, n.  142). So simplicity does not entail infinity,\nbecause finitude is not the result of composition. To look at it\nanother way, Aquinas’s conception of infinity is negative\nand relational.  The infinite is that which is not\nbounded by something else.  But Scotus thinks we can have a\npositive conception of infinity, according to which infinity is not a\nnegative, relational property, but instead a positive, intrinsic\nproperty. It is an “intrinsic degree of perfection.” \n\nHow do we acquire that conception of positive, intrinsic infinity?\nThe story goes like this. We begin with “the potentially infinite in\nquantity.” According to Aristotle, you can never have an actual\nquantitative infinity, since no matter how great a quantity you have,\nyou can always have more. What you can have (and in fact do have,\nAristotle thinks) is a quantitative infinity by successive parts. The\nnext step is to imagine that all the parts of that quantitative\ninfinity remained in existence simultaneously. That is, we imagine an\nactual quantitative infinity. Scotus then asks us to shift from\nthinking about an actual quantitative infinity to thinking about an\nactual qualitative infinity. Think of some quality (say,\ngoodness) as existing infinitely: so that there is, as it were, no more\ngoodness that you could add to that goodness to make it any greater.\nThat’s infinite goodness. But notice that you can’t think of infinite\ngoodness as in some way composed of little goodness-bits (just an\ninfinite number of them). If I say that an angel is better than a human\nbeing, I can’t mean that a human being has a certain number of\ngoodness-bits while the angel has that many plus some extras. Rather,\nthe specific degree of goodness of a thing is just an intrinsic,\nnon-quantitative feature of that thing. Infinite being is just like\nthat. Scotus describes it as “a measure of intrinsic excellence that is\nnot finite.” This is why the concept of “infinite being” is the\nsimplest concept available to us for understanding God. Infinity is not\nsome sort of accidental addition to being, but an intrinsic mode of\nbeing. Of course, if this is right, then the concepts of\n‘infinite goodness’, ‘infinite power’, and so\nforth, are every bit as simple as the concept of ‘infinite\nbeing’. So why does Scotus make such a big deal about\n‘infinite being’? Because ‘infinite being’\n“virtually contains” all the other infinite perfections of God. That\nis, we can deduce the other infinite perfections from infinite being.\nSo besides being the next best thing to a simple concept, it’s the most\ntheoretically fruitful concept we can have of God in this life. \n\nMetaphysics, according to Scotus, is a “real theoretical science”:\nit is real in that it treats things rather than concepts, theoretical\nin that it is pursued for its own sake rather than as a guide for doing\nor making things, and a science in that it proceeds from self-evident\nprinciples to conclusions that follow deductively from them. The\nvarious real theoretical sciences are distinguished by their subject\nmatter, and Scotus devotes considerable attention to determining what\nthe distinctive subject matter of metaphysics is. His conclusion is\nthat metaphysics concerns “being qua being” (ens inquantum\nens). That is, the metaphysician studies being simply as such,\nrather than studying, say, material being as material. \n\nThe study of being qua being includes, first of all, the\nstudy of the transcendentals, so called because they transcend the\ndivision of being into finite and infinite, and the further division of\nfinite being into the ten Aristotelian categories. Being itself is a\ntranscendental, and so are the “proper attributes” of being—one,\ntrue, and good—which are coextensive with being. Scotus also\nidentifies an indefinite number of disjunctions that are coextensive\nwith being and therefore count as transcendentals, such as\ninfinite-or-finite and necessary-or-contingent. Finally, all the pure\nperfections (see above) are transcendentals, since they transcend the\ndivision of being into finite and infinite. Unlike the proper\nattributes of being and the disjunctive transcendentals, however, they\nare not coextensive with being. For God is wise and Socrates is wise,\nbut earthworms—though they are certainly beings—are not wise. \n\nThe study of the Aristotelian categories also belongs to metaphysics\ninsofar as the categories, or the things falling under them, are\nstudied as beings. (If they are studied as concepts, they belong\ninstead to the logician.) There are exactly ten categories, Scotus\nargues. The first and most important is the category of substance.\nSubstances are beings in the most robust sense, since they have an\nindependent existence: that is, they do not exist in something\nelse. Beings in any of the other nine categories, called accidents,\nexist in substances. The nine categories of accidents are quantity,\nquality, relation, action, passion, place, time, position, and state\n(habitus). \n\nNow imagine some particular substance, say, me. Suppose I go from\nbeing pale to being tan. Now it is still I who exist both before and\nafter the sun has had its characteristic effect on me. This illustrates\nan important feature of substances: they can successively have contrary\naccidents and yet retain their numerical identity. This sort of change\nis known, appropriately enough, as accidental change. In an accidental\nchange, a substance persists through the change, having first one\naccident and then another. But clearly not all changes are accidental\nchanges. There was once a time when I did not exist, and then I came\ninto existence. We can’t analyze this change as an accidental change,\nsince there doesn’t seem to be any substance that persists through the\nchange. Instead, a substance is precisely what comes into being; this\nis not an accidental but a substantial change. And yet there\nmust be something that persists even through substantial change, since\notherwise we wouldn’t have change at all; substances would come to\nexist from nothing and disappear into nothing. Scotus follows Aristotle\nin identifying matter as what persists through substantial\nchange and substantial form as what makes a given parcel of\nmatter the definite, unique, individual substance that it is. (There\nare also accidental forms, which are a substance’s accidental\nqualities.) \n\nThus far Scotus is simply repeating Aristotelian orthodoxy, and none\nof his contemporaries or immediate predecessors would have found any of\nthis at all strange. But as Scotus elaborates his views on form and\nmatter, he espouses three important theses that mark him off from some\nother philosophers of his day: he holds that matter can exist without any form whatsoever, that not all created substances are composites\nof form and matter, and that one and the same substance can have more\nthan one substantial form. Let us examine each of these theses in\nturn. \n\nFirst, Scotus argues that God can create and conserve what was called “prime matter”: that is, matter that has no form whatsoever. (For an analysis of the arguments, see Ward 2014.) Matter and form are distinct things, as the case of substantial change makes clear: matter persists when forms come and go. Now that fact by itself might be taken to show only that matter can exist apart from any given form (and Scotus thinks that too), but Scotus takes the separability of matter and form even further. Divine omnipotence means that God can cause immediately (that is, without a secondary cause) whatever he ordinarily causes through a secondary cause. God ordinarily causes matter through form; but given divine omnipotence, he need not. He can create matter without any form. Moreover, given that matter is a thing distinct from form, God creates matter directly and immediately; and what God creates immediately, he can conserve immediately. So God can conserve matter without conserving any of the forms that characterize that matter. \n\nSecond, Scotus denies “universal hylomorphism,” the view that all\ncreated substances are composites of form and matter (Lectura\n2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55). Universal hylomorphism (from the Greek\nhyle, meaning ‘matter’, and morphe,\nmeaning ‘form’) had been the predominant view among\nFranciscans before Scotus. Saint Bonaventure, for example, had argued\nthat even angels could not be altogether immaterial; they must be\ncompounds of form and “spiritual matter.” For matter is potentiality\nand form is actuality, so if the angels were altogether immaterial,\nthey would be pure actuality without any admixture of potentiality. But\nonly God is pure actuality. But as we have already seen in his\naffirmation of the existence of prime matter, Scotus simply denies the\nunqualified equation of matter with potentiality and form with\nactuality. Prime matter, though entirely without form, could be actual; and a\npurely immaterial being is not automatically bereft of\npotentiality. \n\nThird, Scotus holds that some substances have more than one\nsubstantial form (Ordinatio 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). This\ndoctrine of the plurality of substantial forms was commonly held among\nthe Franciscans but vigorously disputed by others. We can very easily\nsee the motivation for the view by recalling that a substantial form is\nsupposed to be what makes a given parcel of matter the definite,\nunique, individual substance that it is. Now suppose, as many medieval\nthinkers (including Aquinas) did, that the soul is the one and only\nsubstantial form of the human being. It would then follow that when a\nhuman being dies, and the soul ceases to inform that parcel of matter,\nwhat is left is not the same body that existed just before death; there is an entirely new substance, with entirely new accidents (for accidents depend for their being on the substance in which they inhere). For\nwhat made it that very body was its substantial form, which (ex\nhypothesi) is no longer there. To Scotus and many of his fellow Franciscans it therefore seemed obvious that we need to posit a plurality of substantial forms to avoid these metaphysical incongruities. One standard form of such pluralism postulated a “form of the body”\n(forma corporeitatis) that makes a given parcel of matter to\nbe a definite, unique, individual organism, and the “animating form”\nor soul, which makes that body alive. At death, the animating\nsoul ceases to vivify the body, but numerically the same body remains,\nand the form of the body keeps the matter organized, at least for a\nwhile. Since the form of the body is too weak on its own to keep the\nbody in existence indefinitely, however, it gradually decomposes. Scotus’s view is more complicated still, for he treats each organ of a living body as a substance (a composite of matter and substantial form). Whether Scotus also acknowledges a forma corporeitatis over and above the forms of the bodily organs is disputed (see Ward 2014, 90–93). If he does not, he must accept the unpalatable conclusion that a corpse is not the same body as the body of the organism. He can, however, avoid the conclusion that no accidents of that body remain: any accidents that inhere in the organs can remain, because the organs are substances and continue to exist (for a while, anyway) when the body of which they were parts ceases to exist. \n\nNote that the general tendency of Scotus’s theories of form and\nmatter is to allow a high degree of independence to form and matter. In\npositing the existence of prime matter, Scotus envisions matter as\nexisting without any form; in denying universal hylomorphism, he\nenvisions form as existing without any matter. And the doctrine of the\nplurality of substantial forms strongly suggests that the human soul is\nan identifiable individual in its own right. So everything Scotus says\nin this connection seems to make room for the possibility that\nthe soul survives the death of the body and continues to exist as an\nimmaterial substance in its own right. But Scotus canvases a number of philosophical arguments for the claim that this possibility is in fact realized, and he finds none of them compelling. That the human soul survives the death of the body is something we can know only through faith. \n\nThe problem of universals may be thought of as the question of what,\nif anything, is the metaphysical basis of our using the same predicate\nfor more than one distinct individual. Socrates is human and Plato is\nhuman. Does this mean that there must be some one universal\nreality—humanity—that is somehow repeatable, in which Socrates and\nPlato both share? Or is there nothing metaphysically common to them at\nall? Those who think there is some actual universal existing outside\nthe mind are called realists; those who deny extra-mental universals\nare called nominalists. Scotus was a realist about universals, and like\nall realists he had to give an account of what exactly those universals\nare: what their status is, what sort of existence they have outside the\nmind. So, in the case of Socrates and Plato, the question is “What sort\nof item is this humanity that both Socrates and Plato exemplify?” A\nrelated question that realists have to face is the problem of\nindividuation. Given that there is some extra-mental reality common to\nSocrates and Plato, we also need to know what it is in each of them\nthat makes them distinct exemplifications of that extra-mental\nreality. \n\nScotus calls the extra-mental universal the “common nature”\n(natura communis) and the principle of individuation the\n“haecceity” (haecceitas). The common nature is common in that\nit is “indifferent” to existing in any number of individuals. But it\nhas extra-mental existence only in the particular things in\nwhich it exists, and in them it is always “contracted” by the\nhaecceity. So the common nature humanity exists in both\nSocrates and Plato, although in Socrates it is made individual by\nSocrates’s haecceitas and in Plato by Plato’s\nhaecceitas. The humanity-of-Socrates is individual and\nnon-repeatable, as is the humanity-of-Plato; yet humanity itself is\ncommon and repeatable, and it is ontologically prior to any particular\nexemplification of it (Ordinatio 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1–6,\ntranslated in Spade [1994], 57–113). \n\nScotus adopts the standard medieval Aristotelian view that human\nbeings, alone among the animals, have two different sorts of cognitive\npowers: senses and intellect. The senses differ from the intellect in\nthat they have physical organs; the intellect is immaterial. In order\nfor the intellect to make use of sensory information, therefore, it\nmust somehow take the raw material provided by the senses in the form\nof material images and make them into suitable objects for\nunderstanding. This process is known as abstraction, from the Latin\nabstrahere, which is literally “to drag out.” The intellect\npulls out the universal, as it were, from the material singular in\nwhich it is embedded. This activity is performed by the active or agent\nintellect, which takes the “phantasms” derived from sense experience\nand turns them into “intelligible species.” Those species are\nactualized in the possible or receptive intellect, whose function is to\nreceive and then store the intelligible species provided by the active\nintellect. Scotus denies that the active and passive intellect are\nreally distinct. Rather, there is one intellect that has these two\ndistinct functions or powers. \n\nPhantasms do not, however, become irrelevant once the intelligible\nspecies has been abstracted. Scotus holds (just as Aquinas had held)\nthat the human intellect never understands anything without turning\ntowards phantasms (Lectura 2, d. 3, pars 2, q. 1, n. 255).\nThat is, in order to deploy a concept that has already been acquired,\none must make some use of sensory data—although the phantasms\nemployed in using a concept already acquired need not be anything like\nthe phantasms from which that concept was abstracted in the first\nplace. I acquired the intelligible species of dog from phantasms of\ndogs, but I can make use of that concept now not only by calling up an\nimage of a dog but also by (say) imagining the sound of the Latin word\nfor dog. Scotus’s point is simply that there must be some sensory\ncontext for any act of intellectual cognition. \n\nAnd even that point is not quite as general as my unqualified\nstatement suggests. For one thing, Scotus believes that our intellect’s\nneed for phantasms is a temporary state. It is only in this present\nlife that the intellect must turn to phantasms; in the next life we\nwill be able to do without them. For another thing, Scotus argues in his later works that even in this life we enjoy a kind of intellectual\ncognition that bypasses phantasms. He called it “intuitive\ncognition.” \n\nScotus understands intuitive cognition by way of contrast with\nabstractive cognition. The latter, as we have seen, involves the\nuniversal; and a universal as such need not be exemplified. That is, my\nintelligible species of dog only tells me what it is to be a dog; it\ndoesn’t tell me whether any particular dog actually exists. Intuitive\ncognition, by contrast, “yields information about how things are right\nnow” (Pasnau [2002]). Sensory cognition, as Scotus explicitly\nacknowledges, counts as intuitive cognition on this account. It is,\nafter all, quite uncontroversial that my seeing or hearing a dog gives\nme information about some particular dog as it exists when I see or\nhear it. Scotus’s much bolder claim concerns intellectual\nintuitive cognition, by which the intellect cognizes a particular thing\nas existing at that very moment. Intellectual intuitive cognition does\nnot require phantasms; nor does it involve intelligible species (which, like phantasms, are abstractive). \n\nIntellectual intuitive cognition has two different kinds of objects:\nextramental sensible objects and the soul’s own acts. (Scotus comes\naround to affirming the possibility of such cognition of extramental\nobjects in his later works, having denied it earlier in his career; he\nis consistent about the possibility of intuitive cognition of the\nsoul’s acts. See Cross 2014, 43–64, on whom I draw thoughout\nthis section.) We must have intuitive cognition of extramental objects\nbecause we can cognize them intellectually as existing; we\ncan form propositions about them and use such propositions in\nsyllogisms. So, for example, if I form the proposition “This\nflower is red,” the contents of that proposition must be in the\nintellect, not merely in the sense. This is intellectual\ncognition because it is conceptual; it is intuitive cognition\nbecause it concerns something as existing. The information\ncontained in the sensible species—the shape and color of the\nflower—is \"promoted\" by the agent intellect from material\nexistence in an organ to immaterial existence in the non-organic\nintellect, so that it is available for intellectual cognition. The\nrole of sensible species in intuitive intellectual cognition explains\nwhy Scotus denies that we can have such cognition of non-sensible\nobjects, such as angels, in this life. We also have intuitive cognition of our mental acts. (As I discuss in the next section, Scotus attaches considerable importance to our intuitive self-knowledge). Abstractive cognition could provide me with an abstract concept of thinking about\nScotus, for example, but I need intuitive cognition to know that I am in fact\nexemplifying that concept right this minute. This kind of intuitive cognition clearly dispenses even with sensible species, since the intellect’s acts, like the intellect itself, are immaterial and therefore not the sorts of things that can be sensed. \n\nScotus argues that the human intellect is capable of achieving\ncertainty in its knowledge of the truth simply by the exercise of its\nown natural powers, with no special divine help. He therefore opposes\nboth skepticism, which denies the possibility of certain knowledge, and\nilluminationism, which insists that we need special divine illumination\nin order to attain certainty. He works out his attack on both doctrines\nin the course of a reply to Henry of Ghent in Ordinatio 1, d.\n3, pars 1, q. 4. (For a translation, see van den Bercken [2016],\n114–143.) \n\nAccording to Henry, truth involves a relation to an “exemplar.” (We\ncan think of this relation as akin to the relation of correspondence\nappealed to by certain theories of truth, and the exemplar itself as\nthe mental item that is one of the relata of the\ncorrespondence-relation. The other relatum, of course, is “the way\nthings really are.”) Now there are two exemplars: the created exemplar,\nwhich is the species of the universal caused by the thing known, and\nthe uncreated exemplar, which is an idea in the divine mind. Henry\nargues that the created exemplar cannot provide us with certain and\ninfallible knowledge of a thing. For, first, the object from which the\nexemplar is abstracted is itself mutable and therefore cannot be the\ncause of something immutable. And how can there be certain knowledge\napart from some immutable basis for that knowledge? Second, the soul\nitself is mutable and subject to error, and it can be preserved from\nerror only by something less mutable than itself. But the created\nexemplar is even more mutable than the soul. Third, the created\nexemplar by itself does not allow us to distinguish between reality and\ndreaming, since the content of the exemplar is the same in either case.\nHenry therefore concludes that if we are to have certainty, we must\nlook to the uncreated exemplar. And since we cannot look to the\nuncreated exemplar by our natural powers, certainty is impossible apart\nfrom some special divine illumination. \n\nScotus argues that if Henry is right about the limitations of our\nnatural powers, even divine illumination is not enough to save us from\npervasive uncertainty. To Henry’s first argument he replies that there\nis no certainty to be had by knowing a mutable object as immutable. To\nthe second he replies that anything in the soul—including the\nvery act of understanding that Henry thinks is achieved through\nillumination—is mutable. So by Henry’s argument it would be\nimpossible for anything whatever to preserve the soul from error. And\nto the third argument he replies that if the created exemplar is such\nas to preclude certainty, adding extra exemplars will not solve the\nproblem: “When something incompatible with certainty concurs,\ncertainty cannot be attained” (Ordinatio 1, d. 3, pars\n1, q. 4, n. 221). \n\nSo Henry’s arguments, far from showing that certainty is possible\nthrough divine illumination, actually lead to a pervasive skepticism.\nScotus counters that we can show that skepticism is false. We can in\nfact attain certainty, and we can do so by the unaided exercise of our\nnatural intellectual powers. There are four types of knowledge in which\ninfallible certainty is possible. First, knowledge of first principles\nis certain because the intellect has only to form such judgments to see\nthat they are true. (And since the validity of proper syllogistic\ninference can be known in just this way, it follows that anything that\nis seen to be properly derived from first principles by syllogistic\ninference is also known with certainty.) Second, we have certainty with\nrespect to quite a lot of causal judgments derived from experience.\nThird, Scotus says that many of our own acts are as certain as first\nprinciples. It is no objection to point out that our acts are\ncontingent, since some contingent propositions must be known\nimmediately (that is, without needing to be derived from some other\nproposition). For otherwise, either some contingent proposition would\nfollow from a necessary proposition (which is impossible), or there\nwould be an infinite regress in contingent propositions (in which case\nno contingent proposition would ever be known). Fourth, certain\npropositions about present sense experience are also known with\ncertainty if they are properly vetted by the intellect in light of the\ncausal judgments derived from experience. \n\nFor Scotus the natural law in the strict sense contains only those\nmoral propositions that are per se notae ex terminis along\nwith whatever propositions can be derived from them deductively\n(Ordinatio 3, d. 37, q. un.). Per se notae means that\nthey are self-evident; ex terminis adds that they are\nself-evident in virtue of being analytically true. Now one important\nfact about propositions that are self-evident and analytically true is\nthat God himself can’t make them false. They are necessary truths. So\nthe natural law in the strict sense does not depend on God’s will. This\nmeans that even if (as I believe) Scotus is some sort of divine-command\ntheorist, he is not whole-hog in his divine command theory. Some moral\ntruths are necessary truths, and even God can’t change those. They\nwould be true no matter what God willed. \n\nWhich ones are those? Scotus’s basic answer is that they are the\ncommandments of the first tablet of the Decalogue (Ten Commandments).\nThe Decalogue has often been thought of as involving two tablets. The\nfirst covers our obligations to God and consists of the first three\ncommandments: You shall have no other gods before me, You\nshall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, and\nRemember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. (Note that many\nProtestants divide them up differently.) The second tablet spells out\nour obligations toward others: Honor your father and mother,\nYou shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery,\nYou shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness\nagainst your neighbor, and two commandments against coveting. The\ncommandments of the first tablet are part of the natural law in the\nstrict sense because they have to do with God himself, and with the way\nin which God is to be treated. For Scotus says that the following\nproposition is per se nota ex terminis: “If God exists, then\nhe is to be loved as God, and nothing else is to be worshiped as God,\nand no irreverence is to be done to him.” Given the very definition of\nGod, it follows that if there is such a being, he is to be loved and\nworshiped, and no irreverence should be shown to him. Because these\ncommandments are self-evident and analytic, they are necessary truths.\nNot even God himself could make them false. \n\nBut even the first three commandments, once we start looking at\nthem, are not obviously part of the natural law in the strict sense. In\nparticular, the third commandment, the one about the Sabbath day, is a\nlittle tricky. Obviously, the proposition “God is to be worshiped on\nSaturday” is not self-evident or analytic. In fact, Scotus says it’s\nnot even true any more, since Christians are to worship on Sunday, not\nSaturday. So, Scotus asks, what about the proposition “God is to be\nworshiped at some time or other”? Even that is not self-evident or\nanalytic. The best one can do is “God is not to be hated.” Now that’s\nself-evident and analytic, since by definition God is the being most\nworthy of love and there is nothing in him worthy of hate. But\nobviously that’s far weaker than any positive commandment about whether\nand when we should worship God. \n\nSo by the time Scotus completes his analysis, we are left with\nnothing in the natural law in the strict sense except for negative\npropositions: God is not to be hated, no other gods are to be\nworshiped, no irreverence is to be done to God. Everything else in the\nDecalogue belongs to the natural law in a weaker or looser sense. These\nare propositions that are not per se notae ex terminis and do\nnot follow from such propositions, but are “highly consonant” with such\npropositions. Now the important point for Scotus is this: since these\npropositions are contingent, they are completely up to God’s\ndiscretion. Any contingent truth whatsoever depends on God’s will. \n\nAccording to Scotus, God of course is aware of all contingent\npropositions. Now God gets to assign the truth values to those\npropositions. For example, “Unicorns exist” is a contingent\nproposition. Therefore, it is up to God’s will whether that proposition\nwill be true or false. The same goes for contingent moral propositions.\nTake any such proposition and call it L, and call the opposite\nof L, not-L. Both L and not-L are\ncontingent propositions. God can make either of them true, but he can’t\nmake both of them true, since they are contradictories. Suppose that\nGod wills L. L is now part of the moral law. How do\nwe explain why God willed L rather than not-L? Scotus\nsays we can’t. God’s will with respect to contingent propositions is\nunqualifiedly free. So while there might be some reasons why God chose\nthe laws he chose, there is no fully adequate reason, no total\nexplanation. If there were a total explanation other than God’s will\nitself, those propositions wouldn’t be contingent at all. They would be\nnecessary. So at bottom there is simply the sheer fact that God willed\none law rather than another. \n\nScotus intends this claim to be exactly parallel to the way we think\nabout contingent beings. Why are there elephants but no unicorns? As\neveryone would agree, it’s because God willed for there to be elephants\nbut no unicorns. And why did he will that? He just did. That’s part of\nwhat we mean by saying that God was free in creating. There was nothing\nconstraining him or forcing him to create one thing rather than\nanother. The same is true about the moral law. Why is there an\nobligation to honor one’s parents but no such obligation toward\ncousins? Because God willed that there be an obligation to honor one’s\nparents, and he did not will that there be any such obligation toward\none’s cousins. He could have willed both of these obligations, and he\ncould have willed neither. What explains the way that he did in fact\nwill? Nothing whatsoever except the sheer fact that he did will that\nway. (For recent criticisms of this strongly voluntaristic reading of Scotus’s account of the moral law, see Borland and Hillman 2017 and Ward 2019.)\n \n\nScotus quite self-consciously puts forward his understanding of\nfreedom as an alternative to Aquinas’s. According to Aquinas, freedom\ncomes in simply because the will is intellectual appetite rather than\nmere sense appetite. Intellectual appetite is aimed at objects as\npresented by the intellect and sense appetite at objects as presented\nby the senses. Sense appetite is not free because the senses provide\nonly particulars as objects of appetite. But intellectual appetite is\nfree because the intellect deals with universals, not particulars.\nSince universals by definition include many particulars, intellectual\nappetite will have a variety of objects. Consider goodness as an\nexample. The will is not aimed at this good thing or that good thing,\nbut at goodness in general. Since that universal, goodness, contains\nmany different particular things, intellectual appetite has many\ndifferent options. \n\nBut Scotus insists that mere intellectual appetite is not enough to\nguarantee freedom in the sense needed for morality. The basic\ndifference comes down to this. When Aquinas argues that intellectual\nappetite has different options, he seems to be thinking of this over a\nspan of time. Right now the intellect presents x as good, so I\nwill x; but later on the intellect presents y as\ngood, so then I will y. But Scotus thinks of freedom as\ninvolving multiple options at the very moment of choice. It’s not\nenough to say that now I will x, but later I can will\ny. We have to say that at the very moment at which I will\nx, I also am able to will y. Aquinas’s arguments\ndon’t show that intellectual appetite is free in this stronger sense.\nSo as far as Scotus is concerned, Aquinas hasn’t made room for the\nright kind of freedom. \n\nThis is where Scotus brings in his well-known doctrine of the two\naffections of the will (see especially Ordinatio 2, d. 6, q.\n2; 2, d. 39, q. 2; 3, d. 17, q. un.; and 3, d. 26, q. un.). The two\naffections are fundamental inclinations in the will: the affectio\ncommodi, or affection for the advantageous, and the affectio\niustitiae, or affection for justice. Scotus identifies the\naffectio commodi with intellectual appetite. Notice how\nimportant that is. For Aquinas intellectual appetite is the same thing\nas will, whereas for Scotus intellectual appetite is only part of what\nthe will is. Intellectual appetite is just one of the two fundamental\ninclinations in the will. Why does Scotus make this crucial change? For\nthe reason we’ve already discussed. He doesn’t see how intellectual\nappetite could be genuinely free. Now he can’t deny that the will\ninvolves intellectual appetite. Intellectual appetite is aimed at\nhappiness, and surely happiness does have some role to play in our\nmoral psychology. But the will has to include something more than\nintellectual appetite if it’s going to be free. That something more is\nthe affectio iustitiae. But one can’t fully understand what\nthe affectio iustitiae is until Aquinas and Scotus are\ncompared on a further point. \n\nFor Aquinas the norms of morality are defined in terms of their\nrelationship to human happiness. We have a natural inclination toward\nour good, which is happiness, and it is that good that determines the\ncontent of morality. So like Aristotle, Aquinas holds a eudaimonistic\ntheory of ethics: the point of the moral life is happiness. That’s why\nAquinas can understand the will as an intellectual appetite for\nhappiness. All of our choosing is aimed at the human good (or at\nleast, it’s aimed at the human good as we conceive it). And choices\nare good—and, indeed, fully intelligible—only when they\nare aimed at the ultimate end, which is happiness. So Aquinas just\ndefines the will as the capacity to choose in accordance with a\nconception of the human good—in other words, as intellectual\nappetite. \n\nWhen Scotus rejects the idea that will is merely intellectual\nappetite, he is saying that there is something fundamentally wrong with\neudaimonistic ethics. Morality is not tied to human flourishing at all.\nFor it is Scotus’s fundamental conviction that morality is impossible\nwithout libertarian freedom, and since he sees no way for there to be\nlibertarian freedom on Aquinas’s eudaimonistic understanding of ethics,\nAquinas’s understanding must be rejected. And just as Aquinas’s\nconception of the will was tailor-made to suit his eudaimonistic\nconception of morality, Scotus’s conception of the will is tailor-made\nto suit his anti-eudaimonistic conception of morality. It’s not merely\nthat he thinks there can be no genuine freedom in mere intellectual\nappetite. It’s also that he rejects the idea that moral norms are\nintimately bound up with human nature and human happiness. The fact\nthat God creates human beings with a certain kind of nature does not\nrequire God to command or forbid the actions that he in fact commanded\nor forbade. The actions he commands are not necessary for our\nhappiness, and the actions he forbids are not incompatible with our\nhappiness. Now if the will were merely intellectual appetite—that\nis, if it were aimed solely at happiness—we would not be able to\nchoose in accordance with the moral law, since the moral law itself is\nnot determined by any considerations about human happiness. So Scotus\nrelegates concerns about happiness to the affectio commodi and\nassigns whatever is properly moral to the other affection, the\naffectio iustitiae.","contact.mail":"twilliam@cas.usf.edu","contact.domain":"cas.usf.edu"}]
