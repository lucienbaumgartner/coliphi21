Fleck claimed that cognition is a\ncollective activity, since it is only possible on the basis of a\ncertain body of knowledge acquired from other people. When people\nbegin to exchange ideas, a thought collective arises, bonded\nby a specific mood, and as a result of a series of\nunderstandings and misunderstandings a peculiar thought style\nis developed. When a thought style becomes sufficiently sophisticated,\nthe collective divides itself into an esoteric circle\n(professionals) and an exoteric circle (laymen). A thought\nstyle consists of the active elements, which shape ways in\nwhich members of the collective see and think about the world, and of\nthe passive elements, the sum of which is perceived as an\n“objective reality”.  What we call “facts”,\nare social constructs: only what is true to culture is true to\nnature. Thought styles are often incommensurable: what is a\nfact to the members of a thought collective A sometimes does not exist\nto the members of a thought collective B, and a thought that is\nsignificant and true to the members of A may sometimes be false or\nmeaningless for members of B.\n\nLudwik Fleck was born on July 11, 1896, in Lvov (now Lviv), at that\ntime under the rule of Austria-Hungary, to a family of Jewish\ncraftsman. His medical studies at the John Casimir University were\ninterrupted by military service. He graduated in 1922, when Lvov\nbelonged to the reborn Poland. At the end of his studies he was an\nassistant of the famous typhus specialist Rudolf Weigl. In 1923 Fleck\nfounded a private laboratory of medical analysis and was in charge of\nthe Lvov Sick Fund and the bacteriological-chemical laboratories of\nthe General Public Hospital. \nAlthough he was only loosely related with any academic environment at\nthat time, Fleck conducted medical research, the results of which he\npublished in about 40 papers, mostly in Polish and in German. In 1927\nhe published in Polish his first work in the philosophy of medicine:\n“Some Specific Features of the Medical Way of\nThinking”. Two years later he published in German a paper\n“On the Crisis of ‘Reality’”(1929) inspired\nmostly by the quantum revolution in physics. Both articles are of a\nprovisional character, but the first one already includes the terms\n“thought style” and “incommensurability”. \n\nIn September 1933 Fleck sent the manuscript of his book Die\nAnalyse einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache to Moritz Schlick. In\nMarch 1934, Schlick replied and expressed his willingness to recommend\nit for publication under the condition that a specialist on the\nhistory of medicine would also review it positively.  In 1935, Benno\nSchwabe finally published the book Entstehung und Entwicklung\neiner wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einführung in die Lehre vom\nDenkstil und Denkkolektiv (The Genesis and Development of a\nScientific Fact: An Introduction to the Theory of Thought Style and\nThought Collective). It was accompanied by a Polish summary of the\nmain theses of the book (1934) and two important papers:\n“Scientific Observation and Perception in General” (1935b)\nand “The Problem of Epistemology” (1936). In Poland the\nbook was criticized by Izydora Dąmbska and Fleck answered her critique\nin (1938). Fleck’s next Polish philosophical article (1939a)\nreferred, among others, to a book by a psychiatrist and historian of\nmedicine, Tadeusz Bilikiewiecz.  Bilikiewicz replied with a moderate\ncritique of Fleck’s epistemology. Fleck in turn wrote a paper\n“Rejoinder to the Comments of Tadeusz Bilikiewicz” (1939b)\nin which he stated strong anti-realistic theses.\n \n\nWhen Lvov was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1939,\nFleck had been appointed the head of the municipal laboratory of\nhygiene and bacteriology. On June 30, 1941, Lvov was captured by\nGermans. Anti-Jewish pogroms began, and Germans also started to murder\nuniversity professors of Polish origin. Fleck and his wife survived,\nprobably because Rudolf Weigl included him on the list of employees of\nthe Lvov Institute of Research on Typhus and Viruses. In August 1941,\nGermans resettled Fleck to the Lvov ghetto, where he developed and\nproduced an anti-typhus vaccine from the urine of sick people. He was\nthen relocated with his family to the area of the pharmaceutical\ncompany Laokoon and tasked with producing an anti-typhus vaccine for\nGerman soldiers. Finally he and his wife and son were deported to the\nconcentration camp in Auschwitz. At first he was forced to do physical\nlabor, but later he was transferred to the camp’s hospital with\nthe assignment to conduct bacteriological tests on prisoners. In\nDecember 1943 Fleck was transferred to the concentration camp in\nBuchenwald. There a group of prisoners—scientists and medical\ndoctors of various nationalities—led by a scientifically\nilliterate German doctor produced an anti-typhus vaccine. \nThe Buchenwald concentration camp was liberated in April 1945. One\nmonth later Fleck found his wife and son in Lvov, which once again\nbelonged to the Soviet Union. They hastily left for Poland, whose\nterritory—by the decision of the Allies—was moved 200 km to\nthe west. The Communist government in Poland was establishing Maria\nCurie-Skłodowska University in Lublin, and since Germans murdered many\nPolish scholars, there was a scarcity of employable professors. In\nOctober 1945 Fleck became the head of the Institute of Medical\nMicrobiology at that\nuniversity, and he became a full professor in 1950. In 1948 he\ntestified in the Nuremberg Trials of German doctors, who conducted\ncriminal experiments on prisoners of concentration camps. \nHe published two more epistemological papers in Polish: “Problems\nof the Science of Science” (1946) and “To Look, To See, To\nKnow” (1947). Those texts do not add anything important to the\ntheory which he formulated in the 1930's. He was absorbed by research\non a defence mechanism which he discovered in 1942 and named\n“leucergy”. It was the chief subject of most of his roughly\n80 medical papers which he published in those years, mostly in Polish,\nbut also in English and French. In 1952 he became the director of the\nbacteriology and immunology laboratory of the Institute of Mother and\nChild in Warsaw. Fleck was honored with\nmany high national distinctions; he had a company car at his disposal,\nand attended international conferences abroad. In 1954 he became a\nmember of the Polish Academy of Sciences.\n When Fleck emigrated with his wife to Israel in 1957, where his\nonly son had been living for many years, he was already very ill with\ncancer and heart problems. For a few years he was employed in the\nInstitute of Biological Research in Ness Ziona. He then wrote in\nEnglish his last philosophical paper “Crisis in Science. Towards\na Free and More Human Science”, that was rejected by several\nphilosophical journals.  Ludwik Fleck died on June 5, 1961, of a\nsecond heart attack. \n\nIn his epistemological works, Fleck combined: (1) experience of a\nscientist; (2) reflections on the history of medicine; (3)\nphilosophical ideas; and (4) sociological ideas. In the light of his\nown sociology and philosophy of science, one needs first to ask which\nthought collectives he belonged to and what thought styles he\nassimilated. \n\n(1) While working in a private laboratory and hospital Fleck conducted\ncertain medical research, but he remained outside university circles,\nand his research was rather marginal. \n(2) In the interwar period Poland was probably the only country where\nfaculties of medicine had chairs for the philosophy and history of\nmedicine (Löwy 1990). Between 1908 and 1919 Władysław Szumowski\ntaught the history of medicine in Lvov. Fleck also had some\nprofessional contact with two philosophers and historians of medicine,\nWłodzimierz Sieradzki and Witold Ziembicki. He was a friend of\nJakób Frostig, a philosophizing psychiatrist. It is worth\nmentioning a few remarks from Frostig's Das schizophrene\nDenken. Phänomenologische Studien zum Problem der widersinnigen\nSätze (Leipzig 1929), which can be seen almost without any\nchange among those written by Fleck: “We mean by [the expression\n‘social group’] any group of people bound together by a\ncommon ‘intention’. Thus the group of mathematicians is a\ngroup of a very special, mathematical mentality. (…) one and\nthe same person can (…) belong to several very different human\ngroups.  (…) the group's collective storehouse ever changes and\nwith it the criteria for truth. (…) It is only in relation to\nthe collective stores of the group in question that we can denote a\nstate of affairs as correct or as a personal error” (following\nSchnelle 1986, p. 9). However, Fleck does not mention any of these\nscholars in his writings, even though they created the thought style\nand intellectual mood that, according to his views, were necessary for\nhis sociology and philosophy of science to emerge.\n \n\n(3) Before World War II, Lvov had a “philosophical\nbranch” of a distinguished mathematical-philosophical\nschool—the Lvov-Warsaw School. Despite the fact that Fleck had\nconnections with this school, he never mentioned either Kazimierz\nAjdukiewicz or Leon Chwistek, even though Chwistek's idea of the\nmultiplicity of reality (in art but also in life and science) has much\nin common with his theory of thought styles. In his writings Fleck\nmakes a few critical remarks on conventionalists and logical empiricists;\nhowever, nothing really supports the claim that he knew their views\nwell. Also, Fleck’s remarks on epistemology of Kant, Mach, Wundt\nand Uexküll’s are superficial and dispersed—he does\nnot adopt views from them, but only looks for some superficial\nconfirmation of his own claims. Thus, we cannot include Fleck among any\nesoteric philosophical circles. \n\n(4) In (1935a) Fleck devotes only a few pages to the sociology of\nknowledge, and, moreover, he refers exclusively to the German\ntranslation of Lucien Levy-Bruhl's book\nDas Denken der Naturvölker, 1921 and to Wilhelm\nJerusalem’s paper of 1929. Clearly he did not know works of the\n“founders of sociology of knowledge”: Max Scheler and Karl\nMannheim. Schnelle (1986) even claims that Fleck had acquired the\nbasic information on the sociology of science from a popular paper\npublished in Polish by Paweł Rybicki. When Fleck mentions the\nworks of Durkheim, Levy Bruhl, Jerusalem or Gumplowicz, he does this\nsuperficially; he does not adopt any of their conceptions and is\ncontent with a general thesis that “What actually thinks within\na person is not the individual himself but his social community”\n(Gumplowicz; quot.  from Fleck 1935a, § II.4). Fleck accusses\nthem of ignoring the results of their research into the beliefs of\ntraditional societies once they turn to scientific thinking, where\nthey hold that “perceptions proper” displace mythical\nelements, and a traditional conviction on the existence of spirits and\ndaemons is replaced with justified beliefs about “what\nphysically is possible or impossible” (Levy-Bruhl, quot. from\nFleck 1935a, § II.4). In contrast, Fleck claims that scientific\nthinking is an object of sociological examination to the same extent\nas mythical thinking. \n\nAn interesting hypothesis was recently formulated by Eva Hedfors\n(2006), who critically evaluated Fleck’s competencies in the\nhistory of medicine. She claims that the chief role in the development\nof his thought was played by the interdisciplinary journal Die\nNaturwissenschaften, where on the turn of the 1920s and 1930s\nscientists and philosophers carried out a philosophical debate about\nthe relativistic and quantum revolution in physics. According to\nHedfors this debate inspired Fleck, who wrote on the “physics of\ntomorrow”: \n\nAs Fleck—because of the lack of education in this\narea—could not write about physics, he found corresponding episodes\nin the history of medicine with which he illustrated theses circulating\nin the thought collective of physicists who were debating what was happening\nin their discipline. \n\nImmanuel Kant made us aware that while we learn about nature from\nexperience, in order to do this we have to know something before\nexperiencing anything. According to Kant, a priori synthetic\nknowledge is unchangeable and plays an active role in cognition: our\npicture of the world is formed as much by things in themselves as by\nour forms of perception and categories of thought, and we will never\nknow whether and how that picture is similar to what exists\nindependently of our cognitive acts. Fleck adopted Kant’s thesis\non the active role of cognitive a priori: an empty mind would\nneither perceive nor think. So, before a mind starts to experience,\nand on the basis of experience starts to think, it has to be filled\nwith some initial knowledge. But the quantum revolution in physics has\nshown that there is nothing necessary or unchangeable in a\npriori forms and categories. A non-Kantian explanation of the\norigins of cognitive a priori was badly needed. \n\nAccording to Fleck, the basic phenomenon we have to accept in order\nto build the edifice of epistemology is the collective mental\ndifferentiation of men (1936, II). People perceive and think\ndifferently, but those differences concern groups rather than\nindividuals. So we speak of various ways of perceiving and thinking\nabout stars and planets by astronomers, by astrologists, by theologians\nor by mystics. Those people understand each other very well within\ntheir groups: an astronomer understands another astronomer well, and an\nastrologist another astrologist; but between groups—like\nbetween an astrologist and an astronomer—there is usually no\nunderstanding. \n\nCognition is a collective activity. It is confusing just to say that\nan individual X got to know a phenomenon P: one should say that\n“X got to know P in the thought style S from the epoch E”\n(1936, V)—yet the thought style S from the epoch E is a product\nof a certain thought collective to which X belongs. What to a stubborn\nmetaphysician appears as necessary forms of thinking results from the\nsocial nature of cognition: \n\nA thought collective is defined by Fleck as a community of persons\nmutually exchanging ideas or maintaining intellectual interaction\n(1935a, II.4). Members of that collective not only adopt certain ways\nof perceiving and thinking, but they also continually transform\nit—and this transformation does occur not so much “in their\nheads” as in their interpersonal space. It is easy to observe this\nphenomenon in everyday life. When a group of people speak about\nsomething important, they start to speak about things which would not\ncross their minds if they were alone and which they would not tell if\nthey were in another group of people. There arises a thought style\ncharacteristic for that group. There also arises a certain collective\nmood which straightens up the ties among the group members and inclines\nthem to act in a certain way. \n\nSome collectives last shortly—even only as long as an individual\nconversation lasts. When social forces connecting people operate for a\nlong time, there arise thought collectives lasting for many\ngenerations. They take forms of religious movements, folk traditions,\nart or science. Long-lasting collectives create social institutions\nwhich enable and regulate the method by which next generations are\nadded to a given collective: educational systems and social rituals\naccompanying the admission of new members. \nAll members of small ethnic groups belong to the same thought\ncollective: everybody perceives and thinks in the same way, just like\neverybody performs the same or very similar actions. Within more\ndeveloped societies there are many various collectives: religious,\nartistic, scientific, astrological, and those related to fashion, politics,\neconomy, medicine, quack, sport, etc.\n\nWhen a thought style, developed and employed by a collective,\nbecomes sufficiently sophisticated, the collective breaks into a small\nesoteric circle—a group of specialists which “are\nin the know”—and a wide exoteric circle for all\nthose members, who are under the influence of the style, but do not\nplay an active role in its formation. Members of the first group are\nthose “initiated”—priests and theologians in the\ncase of religion; artists and art critics in the case of art;\nscientists in the case of science etc. The corresponding exoteric\ncircles for those groups are: lay believers; art-lovers; school\nteachers of physics, chemistry, and biology, and also engineers and\nall people interested in science.  \nExoteric circles have an access to a proper thought style only\nthrough esoteric circles—for example through listening to\nsermons given by priests, or reading popular literature written by\nscientists.  Members of exoteric circles trust the initiated. But\nspecialists and members of esoteric circles are not independent of\nexoteric circles: this is the “public opinion” which\njustifies the efforts of specialists and gives them a stimulus to\ncontinue their work. \n\nIn contemporary societies almost everybody belongs to many thought\ncollectives; e.g. a scientist may be also a member of a certain church,\npolitical party, mountain climbing club. An individual usually belongs to \ndistant thought collectives, so that conflicts between thought styles coexisting \nin him/her do not arise. Most of people belong only to\nexoteric circles; only few become members of any esoteric circle,\nsporadically belonging to more than one. Everybody also belongs to a\nwide “everyday life” collective (which also differs from\nculture to culture). \n\nWithin the esoteric circle Fleck distinguishes the following\nsubgroups: (1) vanguard, “the group of scientists working\npractically on a given problem”, (2) the main body, “the\nofficial community”, and (3) the group of stragglers (1935a,\nIV,4). In other places he omits stragglers and introduces a distinction\nbetween professionals (specialists sensu stricto) and more\ngeneral specialists (1936, VI). Members of a thought collective naturally possess a certain bond,\nsome feeling of group solidarity, of being a “comrade”,\n“coreligionist”, “countryman”, or\n“colleague”. It is accompanied by the feeling of hostility\nor contempt to a “stranger”, who worships other gods, is\nguided by other values, or uses unfamiliar words etc. \nThese are collective moods which\ninduce members of collectives both to sacrifice themselves for others\nand to burn dissenters at stakes. They make scientists work for public\nenlightenment, and at the same time they arouse the feeling of disdain\nfor astrologists or alchemists. \nFleck stresses that there is no thinking which is free from emotions:\n“There is only agreement or difference between feelings, and the\nuniform agreement in the emotions of a society is, in its content,\ncalled freedom from emotions” (1935a, II.4). Emotions have a\nsocial character; they are already hidden in a language employed by a\ncollective. Technical terms not\nonly denote something determined by their definitions, but they also\nencompass “a certain specific power, being not only a name but\nalso a slogan”, they have “a specific thought-charm”.\nThis is why once the members of an esoteric circle master technical\nterminology there appears a sense of mission, and joining such a circle\nitself has “the value of the sacrament of initiation”\n(1936, V). \nIf the position of an elite is stronger than the position of the\nmasses, the elite isolates itself and demands obedience from the\nmasses. Such collectives develop dogmatic styles of thinking in which a\ntest of correctness is usually located in some distant past in a more\nor less mythical master or savior. Collective life acquires a\nceremonial character and access to the esoteric circle is\nwell-guarded. Conservatism reigns: there is no place for fundamentally\nnew ideas, and one can only better or worse realize the revealed\nprinciples. This is characteristic of most religious collectives. \nIf the position of the masses is stronger than that of an\nelite—like in scientific collectives—the elite endeavors\nafter trust and appreciation of the masses, pledging its commitment to\nserve common good. This collective has a democratic character: the test\nof correctness is “the recognition by everybody”. Everybody\nis encouraged to learn, and everybody who meets intellectual standards\ncan become a member of the esoteric circle.\n“This obligation is also expressed in the democratically equal\nregard for anybody that acquires knowledge. All research workers, as a\nmatter of principle, are regarded as possessing equal rights”\n(1935a, IV.5). In principle every man—not only an elite with\nspecial privileges—should be able to verify whether a statement\nis true, to repeat an experiment conducted by somebody else etc. \n\nHere an unsolvable problem arises. General education, necessary for\njoining a scientific collective, is acquired in schools before\nmaturing, and if this is not achieved an individual is practically\ndoomed to remain outside the scientific collective. In science no\ntransfers from the uneducated general public to the body of general\nspecialists occur. However, a democratic respect for an (imagined)\n“anybody” grants scientific thought styles an impersonal\ncharacter which in turn leads to the objectivization of collectively created\nthought structures. Objective truth expressed clearly and precisely\nbecomes an ideal. Of course, this ideal is to be realized in some\ndistant (maybe even infinite) future. However, even if a researcher\nherself is removed from the results of her work, a cult of scientific\nheroes and geniuses devoted to scientific service develops. \n\nPart of a collective mood arises at the point of contact between esoteric and \nexoteric circles. On the one hand, members of exoteric circles usually trust \nprofessionals and they admire them. On the other hand esoteric circles act under \npressure of expectations of the masses. When a certain domain lacks support from \noutside, it does not have significant achievements. Fleck here uses an analogy \nof sand carried by the wind. A rock sometimes hits its target and sometimes it \ndoes not, whereas sand carried by the wind unavoidably accumulates in hollows \n(1935a, III). So\nwhen some social pressure makes enough researchers work long enough on\na certain issue and obtain sufficient material support, they\nfinally arrive at more or less satisfying results. A condition of\nsuccess is not the alleged truth of employed theories but the systematicity\nof research. \n\nThe democratically equal regard for everybody makes scientists write\npopular works to familiarize laypersons—as far as it is\npossible—with a current state of knowledge. They use widely\nunderstood common language full of imprecise expressions and metaphors.\nSince popular texts cannot include complications which a professional\nmeets every day in her work and because an author speaks to the public\nas an authority, such books and articles have a dogmatic character.\nInstead of provisions like “it seems that”, “as we\ntried to prove” often present in scientific papers, in popular\nworks there are expressions like “it is a fact that” or\n“as science has proven”. This has serious (although not\nintended) effects on the development of science itself, for those who\nare to become scientists in future have their first contact with a\ndiscipline precisely through popular readings. Thus, what was\ncreated by a group of people acquires an impersonal, autonomous\ncharacter. “Social distance transforms the author from a creator\nto a discoverer”—and this is how a mythical ideal of knowledge\n“as representation of reality independent of the subject of\ncognition” (1936, VI) arises. \nOne should then start to read textbooks and experiment under the\nsupervision of specialists. This introduction into a domain still has a\ndogmatic character. An individual’s mind is introduced\n“into a self-contained world” and acquires a peculiar mystagogy.\nFinally, some people become fully-fledged members of a thought\ncollective of a scientific discipline—specialists: “the\nexpert is already a specially molded individual who can no longer\nescape the bonds of tradition and of the collective; otherwise he would\nnot be an expert” (1935a, III). \n\nAs a specialist she starts to face certain research problems. She\ndoes not face them alone: she is a member of a group, where everybody\nperceives the world similarly and thinks about it in (almost) the same\nway. And if an issue is new, then any success is achievable only if the\nwhole group of scholars is engaged. Usually the analyzed phenomena are\nextremely complicated and diversified—and they require\ndistinguishing, segregation, unification, and simplification, and those are\ntasks which exceed the capabilities of any single researcher. “Only\nthrough organized cooperative research, supported by popular knowledge\nand continuing over several generations, might a unified picture\nemerge” (1935a, II.1). \n\nWe do not only mean here that there is too much work to do. When phenomena \nare not sufficiently examined, we lack concepts by means of which we could\nadequately describe them. And we also cannot begin with gathering\nfacts. Traditionally—and today some still think so—facts\nwere considered to be what is given and accessible through the senses. Modern\nempiricists claimed that there is nothing in the mind that was not\nfirst in the senses. Fleck reversed this maxim: there is nothing in the\nsenses that was not first in the mind. So, in order to perceive we have\nto learn something before. It is not so that we first see some moving\ndashes and then we compose a whole of them. Quite the contrary: \n\nThis set of forms was transferred to an individual in the process of\nsocialization. When we bring a layperson to a laboratory and we ask\nher to describe a course of scientific experiments, professionals will\nfind out immediately that she is not able to do this. She will surely\ncreate a long description and bring up a lot of unimportant or\naccidental details, but she will not pay attention to what is\nimportant from a scientist’s point of view. “If we wanted\nnecessarily to render his experience in words, the most appropriate\nslogan would be: ‘I search’ or ‘I have a\nchaos'” (1935b). An expert sees differently than a layperson\nbecause she went through a special training during which she was\nfamiliarized with many examples—e.g. symptoms of a given disease\nand at the same time symptoms of other diseases (so with what X\nis and what X is not). At the same time she was equipped with a\ncertain set of views on what that disease is, on the course of it, on\nhow it is affected by external conditions etc. Thus, if the training\nprocess is successful a new member of a collective will directly see\nthe same as what other members see “with their own\neyes”. As Fleck states in the last sentence of (1935b),\n“'To see’ means: to recreate, at a suitable moment, a\npicture created by the mental collective to which one\nbelongs”. \n\nHowever, when a specialist starts research on phenomena of a new\nkind she is in the same situation as a layperson: she does not know\nwhat and how to observe. She does not recognize certain forms, she\nexperiences chaos in which it is very hard to grasp anything constant.\nThis is why—as it was mentioned above—scholars cannot\nstart from gathering experimental data. Fleck also stresses that there\nis no spontaneous creation of concepts (1935a, II.1). This is why a new research\nstarts usually—although not always—from proto-ideas which\noften are of a religious or philosophical character, which had existed\ncenturies before they acquired a scientific character. For example,\nlong before Copernicus there was a proto-idea of a heliocentric system,\nbefore Lavoisier—a proto-idea of chemical elements, before\nDalton—a proto-idea of atom, and before Leeuwenhoek—a\nproto-idea of microbe (1935a, II.2). Proto-ideas are vague, and therefore in the\nscientific understanding they cannot be considered as true or false.\n(Even though they were true for the members of corresponding thought\ncollectives). But they can become a point of departure for\ninvestigation. \n\nInquiries cannot be conducted by an isolated researcher, for she would\nchase her tail endlessly by repeating old formulas. As we have\nmentioned before, the constitution of a research collective is\nnecessary and it happens when an appropriate mood arises—a mood\nwhich unites people and makes them work. In the case of research that\nwas analyzed by Fleck, i.e., the research which led to the discovery\nof Wassermann’s reaction, the source of an appropriate mood was\nsocial pressure—a common demand for effective means for curing\nsyphilis which was considered as an embarrassing and\nreputation-damaging disease.  (Fleck brought forward a controversial\nclaim that the absence of any analogous success in the struggle with\ntuberculosis was related to a common approach to tuberculosis as\n“romantic”, which in turn resulted with insufficient social\npressure to overcome it.) This made the German government join the\nprocess of organizing research teams in that area; an additional\nreason was to make achievements of German scientists outmatch\nachievements of other nations. “The mood gave a driving power,\nand the proto-idea—the direction” (1934). \nIf a group of people participate in a research program there occurs a\npeculiar process.  Each member of the group reads different texts\n(both popular and professional), participates in different\nexperiments, and belongs to more or less different thought collectives\n(both scientific and non-scientific). So, when they start speaking to\neach other and reading each other’s papers, a series of\nmisunderstandings arises.  Ideas circulate within a collective and are\nenriched by new associations, and therefore the words that are used\nchange their meanings. Sometimes nothing is left of the original\nmeanings intended by those participating in the exchange of\nideas. Sometimes the changes stem from a clash of various\nproto-ideas. And that clash itself is a result of various social\nfactors. Having conducted countless studies and conversations and\nembarked upon a long journey, the scholars finally create a thought\nstyle which nobody intended. And after this has happened,\nnobody post factum knows when and how that style started to\noperate and who, specifically, created it. \n\nOf course this process—an important element of which are\nmisunderstandings among researchers—cannot be logically\nreconstructed. \n\nTogether with the mutation of ideas, new forms recognized in\nsensations occur. First, when observing phenomena of a new kind one\nreaches for the set of known forms—and starts to recognize that\nthis, what is new, sometimes and under a certain respect resembles what\nis known, but some other times and under other respects it is\ndifferent. In this period descriptions of results of experiments are\nfull of comparisons with what one earlier learned to perceive, but also\nare full of provisions that those comparisons are sometimes unreliable.\nThe unreliability manifests itself in the unrepeatability of initial\nexperiments: something goes differently than before, and we\nknow neither why it was so, nor what to do in order to get the same\nresult next time. This raises concerns and the readiness for change. A\nresearcher acting more or less blindly, searches for some constraints\nof thought: \n\nChanges in the way of seeing cannot—as it was said\nbefore—be made by an individual. Descriptions of experiments\ncirculate among scientists, and again as a result of misunderstandings\nand understandings the traditional forms are (and this fact is not\nnoticed by the participants of that process) restyled, some are\nrejected, other connected into unique wholes, “and, finally, a\nnew readiness is formed, i.e. the readiness to see a new, specific\nform” (1935b). Finally, in descriptions published in professional\npapers comparisons disappear and one states: this and that was\nobserved. (Similarly, after some time of being in contact with the\nLatin alphabet we directly recognize the letter A despite the enormous\nvariety of shapes it exists in, and at the same time we are not able to\nsay what this recognizing consists in, cf. Fleck 1947, I.) \n\nThus, it is impossible to see something radically new “simply\nand immediately”: first the constrains of an old thought style\nmust be removed and a new style must emerge, a collective's thought\nmood must change—and this takes time and work with others. In the\ncourse of interpersonal exchange concepts evolve and facts evolve\ntogether with them. This in turn stimulates creation of new concepts. \n\nSometimes new ideas come from unexpected directions and without any\nrelation to science itself. This is how Fleck explains the discovery of\nspermatozoon which happened together with the fall of political\nabsolutism and popularization of the idea of individual freedom\nunderstood mainly as freedom of personal movement. One could not\ndiscover spermatozoon just looking through a microscope. However\nsomeone, who thought about a free person, could notice freely\nmoving—so “free”—spermatozoa (1939a). This was the\ninfluence of environment which created a restless mood necessary for\nsearching for something new. And a new mode of thinking created in a\ndifferent domain of life allowed one to perceive, distinguish, and describe\nit in a way which would stimulate reflections of others—those\nparticipating in revolutionary social changes as well. \nBefore new sensual and thought forms arise, a certain\n“specific intellectual unrest must arise and a change of the\nmoods of the thought collective” (1935b). If a person makes an\nimportant discovery but social moods do not change, she will not find\npeople who take up her ideas and continue research. On the other hand\nfacts are mutually dependent\non each other, so “each new fact harmoniously—though even\nso slightly—changes all earlier facts” (1935a, IV.3). As a\nresult, it sometimes happens that those initial observations from which\na certain research began does not belong to the same class of facts as\nthe one emerging from that research. (The research on the variability\nof bacteria was initiated by observations made in 1906 by Neisser and\nMassini, which today are regarded as bacteriophage effects.) Sometimes \nnothing remains of the proto-ideas from which investigations\nstarted and which inspired early experimental work. (Like the\nproto-idea of syphilis blood has nothing to do with contemporary\nWassermann's reaction). And finally there arises the edifice of\nknowledge which was neither intended nor foreseen by anybody. \n\nIn this process there is nothing necessary; various accidental\ncircumstances decide which ideas become a basis for investigation and\nare disseminated within a collective; which meetings between scientists\nhappen; which research projects acquire social support; which\nexperiments are conducted first etc. Fleck claims that if e.g. Sigle's\nidea of protozoa-like structures as the causative agent of syphilis had\nacquired sufficient support, we would have reached a harmonious system\nof knowledge different from the current one. The scope of the name\n“syphilis” would have been somewhat different than it is\ntoday, just like the methods of research and therapy would. But when a\ncertain thought style develops and dominates researchers' minds,\nalternative ways of development become closed. Summing up this idea\nFleck claims that most—and maybe even the whole—content of\nscientific knowledge is conditioned by historical, psychological\nand sociological factors and one has to consider them when attempting\nto explain that content (1935a, II.1). \n\nOf course, a series of misunderstandings is not enough to create a\nthought style that connects everybody. This is why for the existence of a\ncertain discipline the main body of an esoteric circle is\nnecessary—the group composed of general specialists well prepared\nto choose among propositions of the vanguard those that are most useful,\nand to elaborate, employ and harmonize them with each other. I.e. to\ncreate from a set of provisional claims present in papers aimed at\nprofessionals a system and to pass it on to a next generation of\nresearchers. This occurs when textbooks are created. \n\nThe social structure of a scientific thought collective is reflected\nin types of scientific literature. Papers in scientific journals are\nwritten by scientists working practically on a given problem and are\naimed at other scientists. More general specialists write textbooks\nconsolidating their esoteric circle and educating its new members.\nPopular works are directed to exoteric circles. \n\nThe victory of a thought style depends on whether it will be\npossible to have a next generation of its followers, and to prevent \ninfluences of other styles. Certain research problems should be\npropagated, and other should be removed. A certain mental readiness must be\ncreated among the adepts of science. When it is achieved, all researchers\n“will see the new form directly, with their own eyes, as if it\nwere the only one, everlasting truth, independent of the people”\n(1935b). At the end of his life Fleck summarized this as\nfollows: \n\nThe victory of a given thought style is never ultimate. Each new\nexperimental discovery and every theoretical idea more or less changes\nthe whole system. Even if at the beginning one sees only what\ncorresponds with the theory, after a while there appear complications\nand exceptions (Kuhn's anomalies) which sooner or later leads to\nrevisions of concepts and assumptions. “Mutations” in a\nthought style, such as contemporary transformations in physics or in\nbacteriology, constantly occur. Sooner or later we will have to change\ne.g. the law of conservation of energy (1935a, II.1) and any other concept and claim.\nIn the historical development of science there is nothing determined\nonce and for all, nothing invariant. Both thinking and facts change. \n\nFleck defines a thought style as the readiness for directed\nperception, with corresponding mental and objective assimilation of\nwhat has been so perceived, characterized by specific problems of\ninterest, by judgments which the thought collective considers evident\nand by methods which are applied as a means of cognition (1935a, IV.3).\nWhat was collectively developed plays an active role in cognition:\nshapes modes of perception and the thinking of members of a thought collective. An\nindividual, who has assimilated a certain thought style, becomes \npassive when conducting standard research: recognizes in\nenvironment specific forms and draws specific—those and no\nother—conclusions from an assimilated theory and results of\nexperimental research. \n\nThe occurrence of passive elements cannot be explained\nsociologically. They are, so to speak, results of employing a conceptual\nmeasure which resulted from historical and cultural circumstances to the\nresults of experiments—which, as the title of Fleck's book \nsays, came to existence together with the\ncreation of a new though style and are developed with it. \n\nWhat Fleck calls active elements of a thought style, Henri\nPoincaré calls “principles” and sees as\n“disguised definitions”. Poincaré stresses that\nthere is nothing necessary in definitions—they can be various\nand they are chosen for pragmatic and aesthetic reasons. Fleck agrees\nwith him to a certain extent. He notices that in the 19th century\nsyphilis was defined in many ways: as a carnal scourge, as a\nmercury-treated decease, and finally as a set of typical symptoms. And\nhe claims that “(…) if syphilis can be defined in various\nways, the definition selected still determines some\nconclusions. (…) there are some associations which are open to\nchoice (…) and others that are constrained” (1935a, I).\nFor example if one defined syphilis as a “carnal scourge”,\nthen other diseases like gonorrhea, soft chancre, etc. would be cases\nof syphilis; and when proper experiments had been conducted one stated\nfor example that “sometimes mercury does not cure the carnal\nscourge but makes it even worse”. Looking at the same experiment\nthose who defined syphilis as a disease which can be treated with\nmercury would conclude that they are not dealing with syphilis.\nHowever, Fleck opposes the conventionalist idea that definitions can\nbe chosen freely. Definitions are born with the birth of a thought\nstyle, and their formulation is determined by both historical-cultural\nconditioning and by the process of exchanging ideas among researchers\nwhich was described above. A mature thought style is a system where\ndefinitions mutually condition each other and where accepting a\ncertain definition can prevent accepting some other ones. \n\nThe distinction between active and passive elements is still not\nclear. Some examples are obvious: if 16 is assumed—on the basis\nof some arbitrary convention—as the atomic weight for oxygen, the\natomic weight of hydrogen will necessary be 1.008. “This means\nthat the ratio of the two weights is a passive element of\nknowledge” (1935a, IV.1). However, as an active element of\nknowledge Fleck indicates also “the mere use of alcohol in\npreparing extracts”, adding however that “the actual\nusefulness of such extracts is a passive one and therefore a necessary\nconsequence”. He also writes that the concepts of chemical\nelement and of atom are derived “from collective\nimagination”, but “the usefulness of these concepts in\nchemistry (…) is really independent of the individual\nknower”. The active and passive elements of knowledge are\ninseparable either historically or logically, and every statement can\nbe divided into active and passive part. \n\nBoth kinds of elements can be found in each thought style, and also in\nmythical and religious thinking. In one place Fleck notices that\nwhereas a myth has little passive elements, the characteristic feature\nof science is that it attempts to add as many passive elements as it\ncan to its system. Fleck never developed this idea, and this is\nunfortunate, for this could be his contribution to the solution of the\nproblem of demarcation. There are some places where he makes remarks\ncomplementing argumentation developed in the last chapter: “What\nhas previously been classed with the passive elements of knowledge may\nlater join the active ones” (1935a, IV.2). We should regret\nagain that he did not develop the idea which could contribute to\nunderstanding the mechanism of those transformations which Kuhn later\ncalled “scientific revolutions”. For it suggests that not\nonly pre-scientific proto-ideas, but also passive results obtained\nwithin an old scientific thought style can serve as a starting point\nfor constructing a new one. \n\nAs explained above, what and how we see and what and how we\nthink depends on a collectively created thought style assimilated\nthrough contacts with others. However, \n\nIt is peculiar that those who participate in social creation of a\nthought style do not sometimes realize it either. After years they do\nnot remember that once they perceived and thought differently, and\nthey recall their research not as a winding road, full of turns, blind\nsteps, successes resulting from compensation of accidental errors,\netc. And above all they do not record in their memory those moments\nwhen new ideas appeared as a result of misunderstandings between\nresearchers. Fleck compares Wassermann’s texts from different\nperiods and his memories on the road which his team took and which\nfinally led him to the discovery of reaction that now carries his\nname. This comparison shows that after years Wassermann did not\nrealize how in the past, during collective debates and research, facts\nand meanings of words, research problems and methods of solving them\nhad changed. “(…) after fifteen years an identification\nbetween results and intentions had taken place in Wassermann's\nthinking. The meandering process of development (…) had become\na straight, goal-directed path” (1935a, III). Scientists also do not see the changes of facts and concepts that\nhad happened in their discipline. Since they perceive the world differently\nthan their predecessors and they think on the basis of different\nassumptions, they are not able to understand the meanings of words from old\ntexts. They do not know that in the past one not so much thought\ndifferently (for incorrectly) about what they now think about, and\nperceived differently (for incorrectly) what they perceive, as\none thought of and perceived something else. They instinctively\nunderstand old books and papers according to their own thought style\nand consider those texts as steps—although sometimes\nerroneous—towards this world-view which they possess now. \n\nThe next aspect of social nature of cognition is the phenomenon that\nmembers of a thought collective mutually reinforce themselves in the\nconviction that their thought style is true. Members of religious\ncommunities under group pressure do not consider their faith as one of\nmany, but as the definite truth; they do not consider the principles\nof conduct which their faith imposes on them as the principles of one\nof many ways of living, but as those grasping of the essence of\nmorality etc. Also scientists are convinced that their thought style\nis at least partially true today, and with time, when they work\ntogether, it will get closer and closer to being true. Yet, one may\nsay, the conviction as to the truth of a thought style can break down\nunder the pressure of facts that contradict it, and also as a result\nof confrontation with those who think differently. The remarks given\nabove quite clearly show that this is not the case. Nonetheless let us\nsummarize Fleck's views on those matters. A thought style is included already in meanings of words, and\nthose meanings are considered by members of the collective not as\nsomething formed by people but as “objective”. Thus,\nopposing a system is unthinkable: someone who opposes it is considered\nto be the one who does not understand meanings of the words used (1935a, IV.5; \n1936, VI). Scientific instruments which embody some results of a thought\nstyle, “direct our thinking automatically on to the tracks of\nthat style” (1936, VI). Forming our cognitive activity, our perception and thinking,\n“[c]ognition modifies the knower so as to adapt him harmoniously\nto his acquired knowledge” (1935a, IV.2). Since everybody\nsees the world in a way imposed by one's thought style, in every step\none notices facts corresponding with that style and does not notice\nwhat does not fit active assumptions of it. Even if facts incoherent with a given thought style are noticed,\none ignores them as unimportant. For example, for several decades\nphysicists knew that Mercury had not moved as it should according to\nNewton's mechanics, but they failed to mention this fact to the general\npublic. Only today one precisely\ndescribes those facts because they confirm a new thought style: the\ngeneral theory of relativity (1935a, II.3). Cognitive problems we choose to solve do not come from a neutral\nreservoir of problems which existed prior to the development of\nsciences, but we choose those which are born on the ground of a thought\nstyle imposed on us—and they are usually successfully solved\nwithin its confines. And we do not work with problems which are born\nwithin other styles—our collective considers them not worthy of\nattention or even senseless (1935a, IV.3). When anomalies can be no longer ignored, one attempts to show\nthat they are not incompatible with one's thought style (1935a, II.3). (Today we\nwould say one adds to the system various ad hoc\nhypotheses.) Sometimes in old texts we find descriptions of results of\nexperiments which we, as the users of another thought style, consider\nillusions. It happens that somebody sees something what corresponds\nwith prevailing views and other members of a collective confirm his\nexperiences (1935a, II.3). \n\nSo it is not possible to compare a theory with “reality in itself”.\nIt is true that those who use a thought style give arguments for their\nviews, but those arguments are of restricted value. Any attempt to\nlegitimize a particular view is inextricably bound to standards\ndeveloped within a given style, and those who accept those standards\naccept also the style. So legitimization is actually unnecessary, for\nit occurs within a collective with more or less similar education and a\nthought-stylized intellectual constitution. “In science, as in\nart and in life, only that which is true to culture is true to\nnature” (1935a, II.3). \n\nOne may however insist, that not only reality exists but also other \npeople with other thought styles. Can they not convince us that our thought\nstyle is erroneous? No—for every human thinks that those who\nbelong to the same thought collective as she does are\n“normal” and authoritative, and everybody else is\ndisregarded as more or less “abnormal” (1938). Since everybody's\nattention is directed at members of one's collective, one finds\nconfirmation of one's own views everywhere. Moreover, the conviction\nthat we have possessed truth is empowered by the circulation of\nthoughts between esoteric and exoteric circles. Laymen accept a\nspecialist's opinion as revelation, and when that opinion returns from\nlaypersons to the specialist, she considers it the people's voice\nconfirming her achievements. \n\nWhen members of various thought collectives meet, a peculiar\nphenomenon occurs. One sees passive elements in one's thought style,\nbut the active ones remain almost unnoticed. However, “any alien\nthought style appears like a free flight of fancy, because he can see\nonly that which is active and almost arbitrary about it” (1935a,\nIV.5). Since passive results obtained within another thought style\nappear to her as erroneous – as they are built on an arbitrary\nand false basis—she is not able to see their merits and does not\nunderstand that people thinking differently successfully use their own\nworld view. This leads us to the phenomenon called\n“incommensurability”. \nAs explained above, when people with different thought styles meet,\nthey do not fully understand each other, and at the same time one\nperson thinks that the other is a fool and heretic. Fleck, using\nexamples from the history of medicine, shows that such a lack of\nunderstanding manifests itself not only where a physicist and a\nmetaphysician or astrologer meet, but also when today's scientists\nread works of their ancestors from the distant past. (Just like Kuhn\nFleck does not think that the history of physics as science started\nwith Galileo and Newton, and the history of scientific chemistry with\nLavoisier.) For us the views of medieval scholars seem fantastic,\nunjustified, useless, so “non-scientific”. But what would\nhappen if they read our “scientific” dissertations? They\nwould probably consider them artificial, arbitrary, meaningless. They\nunderstood each other well and together developed their thought\nstyles. Just like our views allow us to deal with necessities of life,\n“theological” views allowed our ancestors to organize life\nand gave them an understanding of the sense of life (1935a, IV.5). \n\nOn several occasions, especially in (1927) and (1939a), Fleck uses\nthe term “incommensurability”\n(niewspółmierność) of concepts or ideas. He does\nnot develop this issue. Yet it is easy—by looking through the\nKuhnian glasses—to extract from his writings a quite well\ndeveloped theory of incommensurability of thought styles. Its core is\nconstituted by the claim that in the historical development of science\nthere are no invariants. \n\n(a) The language used to describe what to members of a collective\nappears as reality changes. Some words disappear, other appear, and\neven if words remain their meanings change to a greater or lesser\nextent. Fleck quotes some fragments of writings of a physicist James\nClerk Maxwell and a philosopher Henri Bergson on motion and knowledge\non motion and he concludes that the words “motion” and\n“knowledge” have different meanings for them: “it is\nnot as if the word of one of them meant a thing that the other would\ngive a different name, but that a thing to which one of them gave a\ncertain name does not exist at all for the other one” (1936, II).\nWe can find similar examples in writings of “scientists”.\nHeat in the second half of the 18th century was on the list of chemical\nelements, and in the 19th century it became the motion of atoms. What\nLavoisier or Carnot called “heat”, for Maxwell or Boltzmann\ndid not exist and vice versa. So if they could meet and talk\nthey would not make inconsistent claims about the same phenomenon, but would speak\nof something different. “It is not possible to express with\ntoday's words the content of a view of a distant epoch since particular notions\nof this epoch are incommensurable with the ones of today”\n(1939a). \n\nObviously, it is not possible to explain to somebody outside of\nour thought collective the meanings of the concepts we use through verbal\ndefinitions, for we define words by other words which she does not\nunderstand to the same degree as she does not understand the defined\nword. It is not possible to define a word ostensively, for that person\ndoes not perceive in the world those objects which we perceive as\nbelonging to the scope of the term defined. The only thing we can do is\nto teach her the basis of our thought style, like we teach our children\nand the young. The first step sometimes consists in creating a platform of\npartial understanding with a member of other collective for the price\nof impoverishing content and some deformations. But this is not\nargumentation but propaganda (1936, III). \n(b) After passing from one thought style to another within “the\nsame” scientific discipline, research problems change. Losses\nappear along with benefits. For example, when the contemporary concept\nof syphilis was created one learned very much, but many details of\nearlier theories were also lost. Earlier researchers did not know many\nof the details that we know, but knew more about what according to\nthem had a greater value. Later researchers see many problems which\ntheir predecessors treated as unimportant or senseless. “This\ncreates specialized valuation and characteristic intolerance, which\nare features shared by all exclusive communities” (1935a,\nIV.3). This valuation becomes stronger, for after passing from one\nthought style to another the research methods and standards for\nevaluating research results change to a greater or lesser extent. \n\n(c) Previous researchers—looking from the same point to the same\ndirection—did not see what we see, but they saw something we are\nnot able to see. Those people thought and saw differently than we do\n(1935a, IV.5). Their physical reality does not exist for us, and our\nphysical reality did not exist for them. \n\nThis all leads to an extremely anti-realistic standpoint. The\nthought style creates reality. Nowadays science is not closer to any\nobjective picture of the world than the science of 100 years ago\n(1946). The only difference is that there are now many more scientists\nthan ever and as a result our picture of the world is richer in details\nthan any prior picture. However, the fact that a certain view seems\nfor us to be true is only a sign of our education and not that of the\ncorrespondence to “an independently existing reality”\n(1938). What members of a collective call truth, from the point of view\nof sociology of cognition is the up-to-date stage of changes of\nthought-style (1936, VI) or stylized thought constraint (1935a,\nIV.3). \n\nSince in the historical development of science there is no constant,\nunchanging part, since scientific knowledge changes continuously as a\nwhole, then science does not contain any objective picture of the\nworld, and it does not even contain any part of such a picture (1946). Yet\ncontrary to Kuhn, Fleck does not avoid using the term\n“truth” in reference to scientific statements. And he\nemphasizes that truth is neither subjective nor relative: \n\nBefore World War II there appeared nineteen reviews of Fleck's book on\nthe genesis and development of a scientific fact, most of them\npositive; yet only one was published in a philosophical journal, and\nthe rest were published in medical or popular journals and\nnewspapers. After WWII Fleck's epistemology, in spite of all his\nefforts, was completely forgotten. Thomas S. Kuhn mentioned his book\nin the Preface to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions as\n“an essay that anticipated many of my own ideas” (Kuhn\n1962, p. VII); but for at least fifteen years during fierce debates\nprovoked by Kuhn's book, nobody paid attention to this remark. It was\nonly a paper by Wilhelm Baldamus (1977) and a book by his student\nThomas Schnelle (1982) that awakened a broader interest in Fleck's\nphilosophy and sociology of science. Fleck's book was republished in\nthe German language in 1980. In 1979 its English translation\nGenesis and Development of a Scientific Fact appeared; and\nbetween 1986 and 1990 most of Fleck's epistemological papers became\navailable in English. Fleck's book was translated into Italian,\nPolish, Spain, Swedish, Russian, Korean, French and Brazilian\nPortuguese. \nToday, in the English speaking world, Fleck is mostly considered to be\nan unappreciated forerunner of Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific\nrevolutions. It is in the German speaking community of philosophers\nand sociologists of science that Fleck is considered to be a highly\noriginal epistemologist, who presents human knowledge in a quite\npeculiar and explorative way which significantly transcends Kuhn's\ntheses. In France there is a group of philosophers and historians of\nmedicine—Ilana Löwy and others—who apply Fleck's\nideas in their research. In his famous introduction to the\nactor-network theory, Bruno Latour named Fleck “the founder of\nsociology of science” (Latour 2005, p. 112). In 2005 Ludwik\nFleck Zentrum was founded in Collegium Helveticum, Zürich, led by\nJohannes Fehr until 2014; since 2015 the centre is managed by Hartmut\nvon Sass. In Brazil Ludwik Fleck has influenced at least three\ndifferent “thought collectives”: his theory is applied by\nhistorians of science, in teaching and learning science, and in\nphilosophy.","contact.mail":"wojciech.sady@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
