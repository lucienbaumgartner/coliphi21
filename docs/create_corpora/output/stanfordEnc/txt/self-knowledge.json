At least since Descartes, most philosophers have\nbelieved that our knowledge of our own mental states differs markedly\nfrom our knowledge of the external world (where this includes our\nknowledge of others’ thoughts). But there is little agreement\nabout what precisely distinguishes self-knowledge from knowledge in\nother realms. Partially because of this disagreement, philosophers\nhave endorsed competing accounts of how we acquire\nself-knowledge. These accounts have important consequences for a broad\nrange of philosophical issues, especially issues in epistemology and\nthe philosophy of mind.\n\nThis entry focuses on knowledge of one’s own particular\nmental states. A separate topic sometimes referred to as\n“self-knowledge”, knowledge about a\npersisting self, is addressed in a\nsupplement: Knowledge of the Self.\n\nWhat is special about self-knowledge, compared to knowledge in\nother domains? Self-knowledge is thought to differ from other sorts of\nknowledge in one or more of the following ways. The differences between these are subtle. Statement (1) identifies\nthe distinctive feature of self-knowledge as the epistemic status of a\ncertain class of beliefs, whereas statement (2) identifies it by the\nmethod one uses in forming these beliefs. Statement (3) emphasizes the\nsubject’s cognitive agency. Statement (4) rejects purely\nfirst-personal characterizations, focusing instead on the way\nutterances like “I’m in pain” are treated by\nothers. Statements (1) and (2) are ways of cashing out the notion that\nwe enjoy “privileged access” to our own mental\nstates. Only these first two statements construe the distinctive\nfeature of self-knowledge as plainly epistemic; however, most who\nendorse (3) also claim that this agential relation grounds a special\nepistemic relation. A minority of philosophers denies that\nself-knowledge is special at all. The strongest epistemic claims on behalf of self-knowledge are\ninfallibility and omniscience. One is infallible about one’s own\nmental states if and only if (hereafter, “iff”)\none cannot have a false belief to the effect that one is in a certain\nmental state. One is omniscient about one’s own\nstates iff being in a mental state suffices for knowing that\none is in that state.  (This omniscience thesis is sometimes expressed\nby saying that mental states are self-intimating\nor self-presenting.)  Contemporary philosophers generally\ndeny that we are infallible or omniscient about our mental\nstates. Here is a simple counter-example to the claim of\ninfallibility. Kate trusts her therapist’s insights into her own\npsychology, and so she believes him when he tells her that she resents\nher mother. But the therapist is mistaken—Kate does not resent\nher mother. Hence, Kate has a false belief about her own\nattitude. This case also undercuts the claim of omniscience, assuming\nthat Kate is unaware of her genuine (non-resentful) attitude towards\nher mother. In the case described, Kate’s belief about her attitude is\nbased on the testimony of another person. Relying on testimony is, of\ncourse, a way of gaining knowledge about all sorts of things,\nincluding knowledge of others’ mental states. As mentioned\nabove, some philosophers believe that one has a special way of knowing\nabout one’s own states, a way that others cannot use to\napprehend one’s own states. If we restrict the relevant domain\nto beliefs formed by use of a method that is exclusively a method of\nattaining self-knowledge—perhaps introspection—we\ncan formulate a more plausible infallibility thesis. We can generate\nan even more plausible thesis by limiting this restricted\ninfallibility claim to pains and other sensations. Descartes endorsed\na limited infallibility thesis of this sort. He says: There remains sensations, emotions and appetites. These may be\nclearly perceived provided we take great care in our judgments\nconcerning them to include no more than what is strictly contained in\nour perception—no more than that of which we have inner\nawareness. But this is a very difficult rule to observe, at least\nwith regard to sensations. (Descartes 1644/1984: I.66,\np. 216) This thesis is still quite controversial. A common objection to\neven limited infallibility claims is the idea, often attributed to\nWittgenstein, that where one cannot be wrong, one cannot be right\neither. For instance, Wright maintains that the possibility of error\nis required for concept application, which is in turn required for\nsubstantial self-knowledge.“[E]rror—if only second-order\nerror—has to be possible, if a genuine exercise of concepts is\ninvolved” (Wright 1989: 634). The omniscience thesis seems even less plausible than the\nunqualified infallibility thesis. But consider the following passage\nfrom Locke. [It is] impossible for any one to perceive, without perceiving that\nhe does perceive. When we see, hear, smell, taste, feel, meditate, or\nwill any thing, we know that we do so. (Locke 1689/1975\nII.27.ix) Is Locke really saying that all of our thoughts and sensations are\naccompanied by (justified, true) beliefs about those thoughts and\nsensations? It is more likely that Locke means that we are\nalways conscious of our thoughts and sensations. This\nstatement is plausible on the “higher-order” theory of\nconsciousness, according to which conscious states are states one is\nconscious of. In any case, the omniscience thesis may also be qualified. Some\nmodify the omniscience thesis by claiming that, for some states,\nanyone who is in a state of that kind is justified in believing that\nshe is, even if the thinker doesn’t actually have this belief\n(Peacocke 1999; Siewert 1998; Smithies 2012). Horgan and Kriegel\n(2007) use a modified omniscience thesis, restricted to sensations (or\n“phenomenal experiences”), to argue for a qualified\ninfallibility thesis: The basic idea behind our approach to phenomenal\ninfallibility is that, because the occurrence of a phenomenal\nexperience already involves the subject’s awareness of it, for\nthe subject to acquire a belief about the experience may involve\nlittle more than an act of shifting or redirecting attention. (2007:\n135) Claims of infallibility and omniscience concern\ngeneral relations between beliefs about mental states and those mental\nstates themselves. What is relevant to the most famous philosophical\nargument involving self-knowledge is not these general relations but,\nrather, the certainty of a particular instance of\nbelief. This is Descartes’ cogito argument (Descartes\n1641/1895), which aims to demonstrate that, so long as you are\ncarefully attending to your own thoughts, nothing—not even a\nsupremely powerful evil genius who controls your thoughts and seeks to\ndeceive you—can render misleading your evidence that you are\nthinking (and that, therefore, you exist). Perhaps the most widely accepted view along these lines is that\nself-knowledge, even if not absolutely certain, is especially secure,\nin the following sense: self-knowledge is immune from some types of\nerror to which other kinds of empirical knowledge—most\nobviously, perceptual knowledge—are vulnerable. Some theorists\nwho take this line maintain that there is a causal gap between a\nperceptual state and its object, and this gap introduces sources of\nerror that are absent in direct introspective apprehension of a\nsensation (Gertler 2012; Horgan 2012; Siewert 2012). Those who maintain that beliefs about\none’s own mental states are especially secure, epistemically,\ntypically account for this fact by citing the distinctiveness of the\nmethod used to determine our own mental states. We now turn to this\n“special method” claim. Most philosophers accept that there is some method of grasping\none’s own mental states that is special in the sense\nthat it is available exclusively to the subject. Traditionally, this\nspecial method was construed as a kind of “inward” gaze,\ndirected at the mental state to be grasped. The term “introspection”’—literally,\n“looking within”—captures a traditional way of\nconceiving how we grasp our own mental states. This term uses a\nspatial metaphor to express a divide between the “inner”\nworld of thought and the “external” world. The term\n“introspection” is used in various ways in the\nself-knowledge literature. Perhaps the most common usage is that\nsuggested by the term’s literal meaning: on this usage,\nintrospection is inner observation—or “inwardly directed\nattention” (Goldman 2006: 246)—that, when successful,\nyields awareness of a mental state. The notion that inner observation\nis the special method by which we achieve self-knowledge is central to\nthe acquaintance and inner sense accounts\n(see 3.1 and 3.2\nbelow). While the term “introspection” connotes a looking\nwithin, a view that has recently gained prominence envisions the\nmethod unique to self-knowledge as requiring precisely the\nopposite. On this view, we ascertain our own thoughts by looking\noutward, to the states of the world they represent. This is known as\nthe transparency view, in that it takes self-knowledge to\ninvolve looking “through” the (transparent) mental state,\ndirectly to the state of the world it represents. This view is\nassociated with a famous passage from Evans. [I]n making a self-ascription of belief, one’s eyes are, so\nto speak, or occasionally literally, directed outward—upon the\nworld. If someone asks me “Do you think there is going to be a\nthird world war?”, I must attend, in answering him, to precisely\nthe same outward phenomena as I would attend to if I were answering\nthe question “Will there be a third world war?” (Evans\n1982: 225) The idea that the special method by which we achieve self-knowledge\ninvolves transparency is central to empiricist transparency\naccounts (see 3.5 below), as well as to some\nrationalist and agentialist accounts (see 3.6\nand 3.7). Many of our mental states, such as itches and tickles, are states\nwe simply undergo. But arguably, some are more active: for instance,\nwe commit to beliefs and form intentions on the basis of reasons.\n“Our rational beliefs and intentions are not mere mental\nattitudes, but active states of normative commitment” (Korsgaard\n2009: 39). According to agentialist views, the truly distinctive kind\nof self-knowledge is knowledge of these “active states of\nnormative commitment”. And what is truly distinctive about this\nkind of self-knowledge is that, when one believes or intends on the\nbasis of reasons, these attitudes are more profoundly one’s\nown than states (like itches and tickles) that merely occur\nwithin one. The agentialist contends that, whereas we know our itches\nand tickles only by observation, we can know our beliefs and\nintentions non-observationally, insofar as they are exercises of\nrational agency.  Section 3.7 surveys leading\nagentialist views. The views just described take the subject to be in a special\nepistemic position, vis-à-vis her own mental states. But a\ncompeting approach, sometimes attributed to Wittgenstein (Wright\n1989), maintains that the special authority of self-attributions is\nprimarily a matter of social-linguistic practices, which dictate that\nwe should treat subjects as authoritative about their own states. On\nthis view, one who responds to a self-attribution like “I\nbelieve that it’s raining” with “no, you\ndon’t” (in ordinary circumstances) exhibits a\nmisunderstanding of social-linguistic norms. The first-person authority view does not require that\nself-attributions be epistemically grounded. But our social-linguistic\npractice of treating others as authorities on their own states cries\nout for explanation: what could justify this practice other than the\nassumption that they are in an epistemically privileged position\nrelative to those states? Critics of the first-person authority view,\nincluding Wright (1998), worry that in failing to explain the practice\nof treating persons as default authorities, this view is “a mere\ninvitation to choose to treat as primitive something which we have run\ninto trouble trying to explain” (1998: 45). The first-person authority view diagnoses the authority granted to\nself-attributions in non-epistemic terms. Strictly speaking, then,\nthis position is not concerned with self-knowledge. However,\nneo-expressivist accounts (see 3.8 below) regard\nthe phenomenon of first-person authority as centrally important to\nunderstanding self-knowledge. The idea that self-knowledge is not profoundly special was\nespecially prevalent during the heyday of behaviorism. For instance,\nRyle (1949) suggests that the difference between self-knowledge and\nother-knowledge is at most a matter of degree, and stems from the\nmundane fact that each of us is always present to observe our own\nbehavior. He argues that if self-knowledge were epistemically direct,\nthen the higher-order mental state that constitutes immediate grasp of\none’s own mental state would have to be grasped as well. This\nwould quickly lead to a regress, which could be blocked only by\npositing a state that somehow comprehends itself. But Ryle regarded\nthis sort of reflexivity as impossible. Interestingly, skepticism\nabout reflexive self-awareness was already present in James\n(1884). Self-consciousness, if the word is to be used at all, must not be\ndescribed on the hallowed paraoptical model, as a torch that\nilluminates itself by beams of its own light reflected from a mirror\nin its own insides. (Ryle 1949: 39)  No subjective state, whilst present, is its own object; its\nobject is always something else. (James 1884: 2) Doubts about self-knowledge are also fueled by more general\nepistemological concerns, such as the familiar worry that the\nobservational process unavoidably alters the target of observation\n(Hill 1991),[1]\nand doubts about the possibility of theory-free observations (Dennett\n1991). Others argue that while self-attributions may constitute\nself-knowledge, they are not epistemically superior to other kinds of\nbeliefs.  I suspect … [that our] judgments about\nthe world to a large extent drive our judgments about our\nexperience. Properly so, since the former are the more\nsecure. (Schwitzgebel 2008: 268)\n In the same vein, some (including Stich 1983) deny that\nself-knowledge is special, relative to knowledge of others’\nstates, by claiming that ordinary (“folk”) concepts of\npsychological states are theoretical concepts. If psychological states\nare theoretical entities, both self-attributions and\nother-attributions will proceed by inference from observed\ndata—presumably, behavior. (See the entry on\n folk psychology as a theory.) Skepticism of a different kind stems from a puzzle raised by\nBoghossian (1989). According to some prominent accounts, mental\nstates—in particular, attitudes such as desires and\nbeliefs—are individuated in part by their relations to other\nstates and/or the environment. On standard views, desiring\nthat q partly consists in being disposed to A when\none believes “A-ing is an effective means of\nachieving q”; believing “A-ing is an\neffective means of achieving q” partly consists in\nbeing disposed to A when one desires that q. Some\nphilosophers take attitudes to be relational in another way as well,\nnamely that attitude contents depend on relations to the environment:\ne.g., one cannot desire water unless H2O is (or\nwas) present in one’s environment. Boghossian’s puzzle\nconcerns how we could have privileged access to our\nrelationally-defined mental states.  He notes that there seem to be\nthree ways we might know our mental states: (a) on the basis of inner\nobservation, (b) on the basis of inference, or (c) on the basis of\nnothing. But, he argues, each of these options presents\ndifficulties. Regarding (a): inner observation seems to reveal only\nintrinsic features of a desire or a belief, not relational\nfeatures. Regarding (b): that we must rely on inference, to know our\nown mental states, seems to imply that we lack privileged access to\nthem. Regarding (c): knowledge on the basis of nothing is rare at\nbest.  For example, the self-attribution “I’m now thinking\nthat writing requires concentration” involves thinking\nthat writing requires concentration. It is thus self-verifying, and\nhence may constitute knowledge on the basis of nothing beyond that\nthought (Burge 1988).  But most cases of self-knowledge are not like\nthis. Boghossian concludes that we face a trilemma regarding\nself-knowledge. Philosophers have responded to Boghossian’s trilemma in a\nvariety of ways. Some deny the assumption that recognizing a\nrelationally defined state requires identifying the relational\nproperties that make it the state that it is (Burge 1988; Heil 1988).\nOthers argue that self-knowledge can be privileged even if it rests on\ninference (Dretske 1994; Byrne 2005). And some maintain that we can\nknow our attitudes through introspective observation, and that this\nweakens the case for relational construals of attitudes (Pitt\n2004). Empirical work in psychology constitutes another source of doubt\nabout the epistemic status of self-attributions. In a widely cited\npaper, Nisbett and Wilson (1977) present studies showing that subjects\nroutinely misidentify the factors that influenced their reasoning\nprocesses. For instance, subjects in one study explained their\npreference for a product by its apparent quality, when in fact the\nproduct’s spatial position relative to its competitors seemed to\ndrive the preferences. The accuracy of subject reports is so poor as to suggest that any\nintrospective access that may exist is not sufficient to produce\ngenerally correct or reliable reports. (1977: 33) While these studies are instructive, their results are limited in\nthat they apply only to the unconscious sources of decisions; they are\nsilent as to our privileged access to our current states. Wilson now\nacknowledges this limitation. [T]o the extent that people’s responses are caused by the\nconscious self, they have privileged access to the actual causes of\nthese responses; in short, the Nisbett and Wilson argument was wrong\nabout such cases. (Wilson 2002: 106) Schwitzgebel (2002) has marshalled other sorts of empirical\nevidence to show that introspective reports are unreliable. But\nSchwitzgebel has also suggested that our attitudes about introspection\nmay be particularly obstinate. This conclusion is borne out by his\ncollaboration with a psychologist (Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel\n2007). The authors collect introspective reports from a single\nindividual, who carries a beeper that sounds at random moments; when\nit sounds, she is to note what she is currently thinking and\nfeeling. The two authors sometimes differ as to the correct\ninterpretation of the test subject’s reports, and as to her\nintrospective accuracy.  Strikingly, their disagreement about the\nreliability of introspection remains even after their lengthy\ndiscussion of the results.  Schwitzgebel attributes this disagreement,\nin part, to their respective prior attitudes about introspection\n(Hurlburt is “optimistic” while Schwitzgebel is “a\nskeptic”). This outcome suggests that not only careful empirical work, but\nalso difficult conceptual work, is required for determining\nintrospection’s reliability—or, in Goldman’s terms,\n“calibrating” it. A crucial problem for the theory of introspection is to fix its\nrange of reliability. This is the problem of calibration, which\narises for any scientific instrument and cognitive capacity. I would\nsubdivide the problem into two parts. One would seek to specify the\noperational conditions under which introspection is (sufficiently)\nreliable. The second would seek to specify the propositional contents\nfor which it is reliable. (Goldman 2004: 14) As Goldman notes, we can fix the range of introspective reliability\nonly by using introspection and evaluating its results for\ninternal coherence and for consistency with other sources. But since\nthere is no clear consensus as to how to evaluate the results of\nintrospection, or what weight to accord other sources of evidence\nabout mental states, such as external stimuli and behavior,\nintrospection faces an especially thorny and complex problem of\ncalibration. Williamson (2000) has argued against a particular, seemingly\nplausible thesis regarding self-knowledge: that someone experiencing a\nsensation can know that she is experiencing that sensation. (That is,\nsensations are “luminous”.) Williamson imagines a subject\nwho feels cold at dawn, but gradually warms until she feels warm at\nnoon. At some point she feels barely cold, and truly believes that she\nfeels cold. At the next moment, she feels only very slightly warmer\nthan at the previous moment; but since she felt barely cold at the\nprevious moment, at this later moment she may not, in fact, feel\ncold. The fact that the thought “I feel cold” at the later\nmoment would be false implies that the previous (true) thought is not\n“safe” enough to qualify as knowledge.  Given that\nsensations are usually regarded as especially accessible, the fact\nthat one is not always in a position to know whether one is\nexperiencing a given sensation suggests that one is not always in a\nposition to know whether one is in any given mental state. I will briefly sketch two prominent responses to Williamson. The\nfirst highlights the limits of Williamson’s argument. That\nargument appears to show that one is not always in a position to know\nall of one’s own sensations; in particular, one is not always\nable to detect sensations that are marginal or near-marginal, like\nbeing barely cold.  But the argument seems not to threaten knowledge\nin less marginal cases: if one is now very cold, the belief\n“I feel cold” would not be false, in a nearly identical\nsituation (DeRose 2002). So Williamson’s argument doesn’t\nshow that no sensations are luminous. In another response, Weatherson (2004) argues that sensations may\nbe constituents of corresponding self-attributions: the subject may\nthink “I’m having this sensation”, where\nthat thought incorporates the sensation as part of its content. (This\nresponse dovetails with acquaintance accounts.) \nIf having a sensation generally allows the subject to\nform a self-attributing belief that appropriately incorporates that\nsensation, then feeling cold may be luminous after all. For even a\nslight difference between feeling cold and feeling not-cold will make\na difference in the corresponding\nself-attributions.[2] The idea that we know our mental states\nthrough acquaintance with them is usually associated with\nRussell (1917), but such accounts trace their lineage at least to\nDescartes.  \n According to these\naccounts, our awareness of our mental states is sometimes\npeculiarly direct, in both an epistemic sense and a\nmetaphysical sense. It is epistemically direct in that I am not aware\nof my mental state by being aware of something else. It is\nmetaphysically direct in that no event or process mediates between my\nawareness and the mental state itself. By contrast, I may be aware\nthat it rained last night only by being aware of the wet pavement;\nand, more controversially, my visual experience may mediate between my\nawareness of the pavement and the pavement itself. The claim that introspective access is both epistemically and\nmetaphysically direct is most plausible for phenomenal states like\npain. This is because how a phenomenal state appears (epistemically)\nand how it actually is (its ontology or nature) are, according to many\nphilosophers, one and the same. Pain … is not picked out by one of its accidental\nproperties; rather it is picked out by the property of being pain\nitself, by its immediate phenomenological quality. (Kripke 1980:\n152–3) [T]here is no appearance/reality distinction in the case of\nsensations. (Hill 1991: 127) Limiting acquaintance accounts to self-knowledge of phenomenal\nstates—or, more strictly, self-knowledge of mental states\nindividuated by phenomenology—does not entirely fix their scope,\nas philosophers disagree as to which kinds of mental states are\nindividuated by phenomenology. Recently, the idea\nthat thoughts have a distinctive phenomenology has received\nrenewed attention (Bayne and Montague 2011; Kriegel 2013; see\nthe entry on \n consciousness and intentionality).\n Pitt (2004) uses the fact that we seem able\nto know what we’re thinking in a direct, highly secure\nway—one that is best explained by an acquaintance model of\nintrospection—to argue that thoughts have distinctive\nphenomenological properties with which we are acquainted. Some\nphilosophers also argue that conscious attitudes, such as judgments,\nhave distinctive phenomenologies. The purported epistemic and metaphysical directness of\nintrospection does not imply that we are either infallible or\nomniscient about our own states, since it is an open question whether\nwe routinely engage in introspection. But if introspection\ninvolves epistemically and metaphysically direct access to one’s\nphenomenal states, then its proper use may allow the relevant\nself-attributions to achieve a high degree of certainty. Acquaintance accounts hold special appeal for epistemic\nfoundationalists, who claim that all of our knowledge rests on a\nfoundation of beliefs that are justified, but not justified by other\nbeliefs.\n Acquaintance accounts provide for highly secure beliefs that are\njustified by experiences rather than by other beliefs. For\nexample, Fumerton (2005) argues that an experience can directly\njustify the belief that one is having that experience. In this\ncontext, the truth-maker for a belief is the mental state that makes\nit true: e.g., the truth-maker for “I’m in pain” is\nthe pain itself. (Terms in square brackets are mine). One wants the truth-maker ‘before’ consciousness\n[metaphysical directness] in a way that provides complete\nintellectual assurance [epistemic directness] concerning the truth of\nwhat one believes. (Fumerton 2005: 122) One approach to explaining how experiences can directly justify\nbeliefs about them draws on the phenomenon of demonstrative reference\n(Gertler 2001; Chalmers 2003). Demonstrative reference often involves\nliteral pointing: by pointing to my desk, I can demonstratively refer\nto it as “that (desk)”. Of course, we don’t\nliterally point to our experiences. But as Sosa aptly observes,\n“Selective attention is the index finger of the mind”\n(2003: 279). By attending to how an experience feels (or appears),\none can use this appearance—e.g., the itchiness of an\nitch—to refer to the feature demonstratively, as\n“this quality”. One can then register the\npresence of the itch by thinking “I’m now\nexperiencing this quality” Since reference is secured\nby attending to the itchiness, one grasps the feature in\nquestion, as itchiness. Chalmers, who has an especially\nwell-developed theory of phenomenal concepts along these lines, refers\nto this grasp of phenomenal features as a “direct phenomenal\nconcept”. The clearest cases of direct phenomenal concepts arise when a\nsubject attends to the quality of an experience, and forms a concept\nwholly based on the attention to the quality, “taking up”\nthe quality into the concept. (Chalmers 2003: 235) Some critics charge that acquaintance accounts construe\nintrospective beliefs as too close to their objects to qualify as\ngenuine, substantial knowledge. In effect, this objection denies that\nintrospective attention to an instance of a phenomenal quality can\nprovide for an understanding of that quality adequate for genuine\nfactual knowledge. Another worry about acquaintance accounts stems from the\nobservation that we sometimes err about our experiences. In a famous\nexample, a fraternity pledge is blindfolded and told that his hand\nwill be burned with a cigarette. An icicle is then applied to his\nhand, and the pledge responds by screaming as if in pain. On the\nrelevant interpretation of this case, the pledge mistakes coldness for\npain: it epistemically seems to him that his phenomenology is\nthat of pain. This kind of error is the basis for Schwitzgebel’s\nobjection to acquaintance accounts. Philosophers who speak of “appearances” or\n“seemings” in discussing consciousness invite conflation\nof the epistemic and phenomenal senses of these terms. …\n“It appears that it appears that such-and-such” may have\nthe look of redundancy, but on disambiguation the redundancy\nvanishes: “it epistemically seems to me that my phenomenology\nis such-and-such”. No easy argument renders this statement\nself-verifying. (Schwitzgebel 2008: 263) To answer this objection, acquaintance theorists will concede that\nwe can be wrong about our own phenomenal states. These accounts\nrequire only that, under certain conditions, the phenomenal reality of\nan experience constitutes its epistemic appearance (Horgan and Kriegel\n2007; Gertler 2012). The idea that we know (even some of) our sensations by acquaintance\nremains highly controversial; the idea that we know our thoughts, or\nour beliefs or other attitudes, by acquaintance is even more\ncontroversial. As James (1884) observed, self-knowledge requires more\nthan mere contact with a mental state: it requires that one properly\nconceptualize the state, classifying it as a state of a particular\nkind (e.g., as pain or coldness). The most difficult hurdle for\nacquaintance accounts is to explain how this conceptualization\noccurs. In particular, the difficulty is to explain how awareness of a\nmental state can be direct and immediate, yet epistemically\nsubstantial—a genuine grasp of the state as a state of\na certain kind. While acquaintance accounts construe self-knowledge as strikingly\ndistinctive in its directness and epistemic security, inner sense\naccounts take the opposite tack: they construe introspection as\nsimilar to perception in crucial respects. Locke, an early inner sense theorist, described the introspective\nfaculty as follows. This Source of Ideas, every Man has wholly in himself …\nAnd though it be not Sense, as having nothing to do with external\nObjects; yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be\ncall’d internal Sense. (Locke 1689/1975:\nII.1.iv.) Inner sense accounts construe introspection as similar to\nperception in that it involves a monitoring mechanism or\n“self-scanning process” (Armstrong 1993: 324) that takes\nmental states as input and yields representations of those states as\noutput. On such accounts, and in contrast to acquaintance accounts,\nthe connection between the introspected state (the input) and the\nintrospective state (the output) is causal and contingent. But inner\nsense accounts allow that introspection also differs from perception\nin significant ways.  Perception is achieved through dedicated organs\nsuch as eyes and ears, whereas there is no (literal) organ of\nintrospection. “The ‘organ’ of introspection is\nattention, the orientation of which puts a subject in an appropriate\nrelation to a targeted state” (Goldman 2006: 244). Perception\nordinarily involves sensory experiences, whereas “No one thinks\nthat one is aware of beliefs and thoughts by having sensations or\nquasi-sense-experiences of them” (Shoemaker 1994: 255). The monitoring mechanism involved in inner sense must form\nrepresentations of the mental states it takes as input. But how does\nthis process ensure that the output (the representation of the scanned\nmental state) matches the input (the scanned state itself)? On some\ninner sense accounts, the output representation\n“redeploys” the content of the input state (Nichols and\nStich 2003; Goldman 2006).  But as Goldman points out, the\nredeployment of content—even when “content” is used\nbroadly, to include sensory-experiential contents—cannot fully\nexplain the transition from the scanned mental state to the\nrepresentation thereof. A complete account must also explain how the\nintrospective process correctly classifies the type of mental\nstate at issue: as, e.g., a visual experience, belief, or\ndesire. Goldman proposes that the introspective process uses the\nneural properties of states to type-identify them (Goldman 2006:\nch. 9). Inner sense accounts’ construal of introspection as a causal\nprocess makes them particularly well-suited to reliabilist (or, more\nbroadly, epistemically externalist) approaches to self-knowledge.\n For example, Armstrong\ncharacterizes the introspective process as “a mere flow of\ninformation or beliefs” (Armstrong 1993: 326). The causal\nconnections involved in self-monitoring need not be known by the\nsubject in order to deliver self-knowledge, and inner sense accounts\ngenerally regard knowledge based in introspection as\nnon-inferential. Since the relevant scanners or monitoring mechanisms\nare directed only towards one’s own states, introspection is an\nexclusively first-personal method. But at least some inner sense\ntheorists note that the asymmetry of access is merely contingent, as\nit is possible, in principle, for one’s “inner\nsense” mechanism to be linked to someone else’s mental\nstates. Armstrong finds it “perfectly conceivable that we should\nhave direct [read: non-inferential] awareness of the mental states of\nothers”, through a kind of telepathic scanning (1993: 124). Perhaps the chief benefit of inner sense accounts is that they are\nespecially conducive to a broadly naturalistic picture of mentality,\naccording to which mentality is part of nature broadly continuous with\nthe nonmental realm. By assimilating introspection to perception,\ninner sense accounts construe mentality as epistemically continuous\nwith the nonmental, and thus allow a single overarching epistemology\nto apply to both self-knowledge and knowledge of external\nthings. Since most of the leading arguments for mind-body dualism\ndepend on the claim that our epistemic relations to mental states\ndiverge in crucial ways from our epistemic relations to physical\nobjects, the claim that the mental is epistemically continuous with\nthe nonmental paves the way for assimilating mentality to the\nnonmental realm ontologically as \nwell.[3] Shoemaker (1994) offers a sustained critique of inner sense\naccounts. His main objection centers on the charge that, if we knew\nour own mental states through a perception-like mechanism, then the\nfollowing scenario would be possible. A rational creature with\nordinary mental states like pains and beliefs, and possessing concepts\nof pain and belief, might be “self-blind”: that is, unable\nto recognize its own thoughts and sensations. But, he says,\nself-blindness in a rational creature is impossible. Inner sense\naccounts imply that self-blindness is possible, Shoemaker thinks,\nbecause they regard the capacity for self-knowledge as on a par with\nsensory capacities like vision, and hence as a capacity that a\nrational person might lack. Shoemaker’s discussion has been as\ninfluential for its positive suggestion—that our capacity for\nself-knowledge is closely tied to rationality\n(see 3.6 and 3.7)—as\nfor its critical treatment of inner sense accounts. Shoemaker presents three main arguments to show that self-blindness\nis impossible in a rational creature. First, mental states\nlike pains are defined, in part, by the behaviors they\nrationalize, such as taking aspirin; such behaviors aren’t\nrational unless the subject is aware of the pain. Second, one is not a\nrational subject unless one can recognize, in certain circumstances,\nthat one’s beliefs (or other attitudes) should be modified; and\nthis recognition requires awareness of one’s attitudes. Third,\nrational subjects will, necessarily, generally behave as if they are\naware of their beliefs: e.g., they will not assert “snow is\nwhite” unless they are also disposed to assert “I believe\nthat snow is white”. And this suggests that, necessarily,\nrational subjects are generally aware of their beliefs.\n  I am tempted to say that if everything is as\nif a creature has knowledge of its beliefs and desires, then\nit does have knowledge of them. (Shoemaker 1988:\n192) Kind (2003) contends that these arguments do not directly threaten\ninner sense accounts. At most, she thinks, Shoemaker has shown that\nrational creatures will generally be capable of self-awareness. But\nsince this conclusion is silent as to how such awareness\noccurs, it does not rule out the possibility that it is achieved\nthrough inner sense. Gertler (2011a: ch. 5) contends that the inner\nsense theorist can block Shoemaker’s objection by stipulating\nthat no creature qualifies as rational unless it has the\ncharacteristics Shoemaker sees as “essential to being a rational\nbeing”: this may mean that having a well-functioning inner sense\n(or something equivalent) is required for being rational.\nShoemaker’s challenge to inner sense views requires a stronger\nthesis, namely that rational beings must be capable of self-knowledge\nin order to exist at all. Another objection to inner sense accounts targets their epistemic\nexternalism. Peacocke notes that while these accounts postulate\n“a genuine explanation [of one’s self-ascription] at the\nsub-personal level”, this explanation does not explain why we\nhave any reason to endorse the self-attributions it generates\n(Peacocke 1999: 224). Inner sense accounts are not likely to appeal to\nthose who take self-knowledge to rest on internal or\naccessible reasons for belief. Like inner sense accounts, Carruthers’ interpretive-sensory\naccess (or ISA) account takes self-knowledge to arise through a\nsubpersonal cognitive system that is reliable yet fallible (Carruthers\n2011). But the ISA account denies a key assumption of inner sense\naccounts, namely, that there is a cognitive faculty dedicated\nspecifically to self-knowledge. It proposes that a single\n“mindreading” system detects both one’s own mental\nstates and the mental states of others. This “mindreading”\nsystem takes sensory data as input; interprets these data by\ndrawing on situational facts and background information; and yields\nrepresentations of mental states as output. One striking feature of the ISA account is its claim that nearly\nall self-knowledge requires self-interpretation. This fits with the\nidea that a single mindreading system provides both self-knowledge and\nother-knowledge, since it is plausible that we\nunderstand others’ attitudes by interpretation (of\ntheir speech and other behavior). Carruthers argues that the frequency\nwith which we err about our own attitudes, through confabulation or\nother sorts of processes, supports the claim that in\nidentifying our own attitudes we are forced to engage—often\nunsuccessfully—in self-interpretation. He hypothesizes that the\nmindreading system “evolved for outward-looking social\npurposes” and was only later co-opted for self-knowledge (2011:\n69). The ISA account converges with Ryle’s (1949) view about\nself-knowledge at some crucial points. (I’m indebted here to\nByrne 2012a.) One of these is the claim that inner speech contributes\nsignificantly to self-knowledge, in a way that roughly parallels outer\nspeech’s contribution to other-knowledge. Ryle suggests that the\nexperience of inner speech is a maximally effective type of\n“eavesdropping”. We eavesdrop on our own voiced utterances and our own silent\nmonologues. In noticing these we are preparing ourselves to do\nsomething new, namely to describe the frames of mind which these\nutterances disclose. But there is nothing intrinsically proprietary\nabout this activity. I can pay heed to what I overhear you saying as\nwell as to what I overhear myself saying, though I cannot overhear\nyour silent colloquies with yourself. (Ryle 1949:\n184) Drawing on Ryle’s remark about hearing our own silent\ncolloquies, Cassam (2011) sketches a proposal about how we know our\n“passing thoughts”, where having the passing thought\nthat p does not involve taking any particular attitude\ntowards p. Cassam proposes that “I know that I am\nhaving the thought that P by being conscious of saying to\nmyself that P in my internal monologue” (2011:\n3). Carruthers endorses a broadly similar proposal, arguing that\npassing thoughts expressed in inner speech can be known without\ninterpretation (Carruthers 2011: 107–8). On the ISA view,\ninterpretation is not required for such knowledge, or for knowledge of\nany state that can be recognized solely on the basis of raw sensory\ndata, since sensory data are the inputs to the mindreading system. Carruthers argues that because judgments, decisions, and other\nattitudes are defined by their causal roles, these cannot be known\npurely on the basis of an experience of inner speech or other sensory\ndata.  [T]he experience of [a sentence in inner speech]\nsurely isn’t, itself, a judgment, or a decision, or any other\noccurrent attitude. (2011: 68)\n  This point echoes the first horn of\nBoghossian’s trilemma; the ISA\ntheorist’s response to that trilemma is to take self-knowledge\n(of the relevant states) to be inferential. Some will balk at the idea\nthat self-interpretation is required for determining that I’m\nnow judging that p, or deciding to q. However, this\nissue may have more to do with disputes about whether occurrent\nattitudes have distinctive phenomenologies than with accounts of\nself-knowledge. Some critics will target the ISA account’s claim that a\nsingle mindreading system, one that developed to provide for\nother-knowledge, also subserves self-knowledge. This claim is closely\nlinked to the idea that our basic conception of mental\nstates—“folk psychology”—derives from\ntheorizing.  Those who reject that idea will maintain that the ISA\naccount reverses the proper explanatory order, since our basic\nconception of mental states derives not from theory but from our\nawareness of such states in ourselves, achieved by use of an\nexclusively first-personal faculty of introspection. The accounts discussed in 3.1–3.3 exemplify two starkly\ndifferent epistemological approaches to self-knowledge. Acquaintance\ntheorists maintain that self-knowledge can sometimes satisfy strongly\ninternalist conditions, conditions that require, for knowledge\nthat p, that one’s belief that p be based in\nreasons or evidence that are accessible to the subject. A pain or itch\nthat is known by acquaintance is grasped through accessible evidence:\nthe painfulness or itchiness itself. Inner sense accounts and the ISA\naccount construe (most) self-knowledge in epistemically externalist\nterms. Beliefs qualify as knowledge by virtue of some feature not\ndirectly accessible to the thinking subject, such as the fact that\nthey appropriately result from the exercise of a reliable (inner sense\nor mindreading) mechanism. The reasons account of self-knowledge, first advanced by\nPeacocke (1999), combines elements of internalism and elements of\nexternalism. Peacocke rejects pure externalism, maintaining that when\nI self-attribute the belief that (say) in Australia July is a winter\nmonth, this self-attribution seems to me rational, in that I have an\naccessible, “personal-level” reason for it. He attempts to\ncarve out a fourth option for self-knowledge, beyond the three options\nexpressed in Boghossian’s trilemma,\narguing that we can know some of our mental states without observing\nthem, or by inference; yet this knowledge is still on the basis of\nsomething, namely a reason. According to the reasons account, a conscious state can serve as a\nreason for belief or action, even if the thinker is not\nconscious of the state. The following analogy may illuminate\nthe basic idea here. An itch can serve as a reason for scratching,\neven if there is no further conscious state (distinct from the itch)\nthat constitutes an awareness of the itch. Peacocke argues\nthat, in a broadly similar way, a conscious judgment that p\ncan serve as a direct reason for my self-attributing the belief\nthat p, without my having any distinct awareness of\nthat judgment. (Compare Silins 2012.) The transition from judging that p (a conscious, occurrent\nstate) to believing that one believes that p (that is, to\nself-attributing a dispositional belief) is a rational one, on this\nview, because judging is conceptually linked with believing: making a\njudgment “is the fundamental way to form a belief”\n(Peacocke 1999: 238). Similarly, since remembering that p is\nconceptually linked with (dispositionally) believing that p,\na conscious memory that p can justify the belief that one\nbelieves that p. And anyone in a position to self-attribute\na belief will possess the concept of belief, and so will\ngrasp—or at least, manifest cognitive dispositions\nappropriately reflecting—these conceptual\ntruths.[4] Drawing on Peacocke, Paul (2012) develops a reasons account of how\nwe know our intentions. On this account, the transition from deciding\nto do something (or remembering that one has so decided) to believing\nthat one intends to do that thing is rational, since it is a\nconceptual truth that deciding normally suffices for intending. Coliva (2008) objects that judgments cannot rationalize\nself-attributions of belief in the way the reasons theorist contends,\nbecause they are not suitably accessible. Her argument rests, in part,\non the claim that the phenomenology of a conscious thought—such\nas “things will look up”—does not indicate whether\nthis is the content of a judgment or, instead, of a wish. McHugh\n(2012) responds on behalf of the reasons account, arguing that there\nis a “phenomenology characteristic of judging\nthat p” that is present in cases where ordinary\nself-knowledge is possible (2012: 148). The prospects for the reasons\naccount, as an account of self-knowledge of the attitudes, may depend\non whether attitudes have “proprietary phenomenology”\n(Pitt 2004). (For more on that question, see Bayne and Montague\n2011.) Transparency accounts are inspired by the idea discussed above, in\nconnection with Gareth Evans’ famous remark: that if asked\nwhether you believe that there will be a third world war, you answer\nby directly considering the likelihood of a third world war. The\nmetaphor of transparency expresses the notion that one “looks\nthrough” the (transparent) mental state to directly consider\nwhat it represents. Evans’ remark concerns beliefs specifically. Most\ntransparency theorists develop their accounts as explanations of how\nwe know our beliefs, and later expand these accounts to cover some\nother kinds of states. Within the class of transparency accounts,\nthere are profoundly differing views about how self-knowledge is\nachieved and its epistemic status. Some transparency theorists hold\nthat the self-attributions generated by following Evans’\nprocedure qualify as knowledge only because of our rational\nagency relative to our attitudes—roughly, the fact that\nbelieving, intending (etc.) are things we do, on the basis of\nreasons. These agentialist accounts will be discussed\nin subsection 3.7 below. The current subsection focuses on transparency accounts that see\nEvans’ procedure as generating empirical justification or\nwarrant for self-attributions, justification or warrant that does not\nrest on our rational agency relative to our attitudes. According to\nthese accounts, the transparency of mental states provides for an\nexclusively first-personal method of knowing them, and explains the\nspecial security of self-attributions. I will briefly survey the three\nleading empiricist transparency accounts—developed by Dretske\n(1994), Fernández (2003, 2013), and Byrne (2005, 2011a). Dretske describes self-knowledge as “a form of perceptual\nknowledge that is obtained—indeed, can only be obtained—by\nawareness of non-mental objects” (Dretske 1994: 264). E.g., I\ncan know that I’m thinking it’s snowing only by\ninference from my awareness of a non-mental object, such as the\nfalling snow. This account secures first-person authority, since my\nawareness of the snow would not similarly support an inference about\nanyone else’s mental state. The account requires that we rely on\nbackground beliefs to justify the inference from seeing snow\nto I’m thinking that it’s snowing. Aydede (2003)\nhas questioned whether these background beliefs will themselves be\navailable (or justified). Fernández’s version of the transparency account avoids\nthis worry about background beliefs, by taking self-knowledge to be\nnon-inferential. He argues that a mental state, and a self-attribution\nof that state, can share a single basis. For example, seeing snow\nfalling will ordinarily result in the belief that it’s snowing;\nthis visual experience may also form the basis for the\nself-attribution I believe that it’s snowing, according\nto Fernández. So a single state can serve as the basis for both\nthe belief that p and the belief that I believe\nthat p. Fernández (2013) labels this “the bypass model”, to\nindicate that the self-attribution is based directly on the basis for\nthe first-order belief, “bypassing” the first-order belief\nitself. The self-attribution is justified in a way that is\n“partly internalist, and partly externalist” (ibid.:\n44).  If I reflect on\nwhy I believe that I believe that it’s snowing, I will realize\nthat I (seem to) see falling snow; so I have access to the basis for\nmy self-attribution. And my seeming to see falling snow provides\nexternalist warrant for my self-attribution because that perceptual\nstate tends to correlate with my believing that it’s\nsnowing. The bypass method is exclusively first-personal, since only I can\nbase a belief directly on my perceptual state. And it is more\nsecure than others’ means of knowing my mental states. Others\nknow my states only by inference—from my behavior, and/or their\nobservations of the evidence available to me. But\nself-knowledge that satisfies the bypass model is non-inferential,\nsince the self-attribution (e.g., the belief that I believe that\nit’s snowing) is not inferred from its basis (e.g., seeing\nfalling snow). By contrast, Byrne’s (2005, 2011a) transparency account is\nexplicitly inferentialist. He claims that we know our beliefs by\nreasoning according to the “doxastic schema” described by\nGallois (1996). Byrne argues that reasoning in accord with the doxastic schema is\nin a certain sense self-verifying. To reason in accord with the\ndoxastic schema is to infer I believe that p from the\npremise p; one does not infer from a premise unless one\nbelieves the premise; so such reasoning will yield only true\nself-attributions. The doxastic schema is thus\nself-verifying.[5]\n And it is self-verifying regardless of\nwhether the premise is justified, or even whether the thinker regards\nit as justified.  Byrne’s main thesis, that self-knowledge is achieved through\nuse of the doxastic schema, rests on two basic claims. The first is\nthat it’s independently plausible that we actually use the\ndoxastic schema (as Evans’ remarks suggest). The second basic\nclaim anchoring Byrne’s view is that the hypothesis that we use\nthe doxastic schema best explains the special security and asymmetry\nof self-knowledge. On his proposal, the special epistemic security of\nself-knowledge is a matter of externalist warrant: the doxastic\nschema is not only self-verifying but also yields self-attributions\nthat are “safe” in that they could not easily have been\nfalse.[6] \n  Byrne’s proposal also captures the\nasymmetry of self-knowledge: reasoning from “p”\nto “s/he believes that p” will not reliably\nyield true other-attributions, since one’s own recognition\nthat p is not appropriately connected\nto others’ beliefs about whether p. How plausible are these transparency accounts? These accounts\nendorse Evans’ idea that directly considering whether p\ncan enable us to answer the question “Do you believe\nthat p?”. But as Shah and Velleman (2005) observe, this\nprocedure may generate a new belief. [O]ne can answer the question whether I now believe that p by\nforming a conscious belief with respect to p, whereupon one’s\nconsciousness of that belief will provide the answer; but one cannot\nanswer the question whether I already believe that p in a way that\nbegins with forming the belief. (2005: 506) For example, Evans’ suggestion seems to be that to answer the\nquestion “Do you believe that there will be a third world\nwar?” one should consider geopolitical matters. But\nsuch consideration may produce a new belief rather than revealing a\npre-existing belief. The transparency theorist cannot respond to this\nworry by stipulating that, when considering whether p, one\nshould not draw any new conclusions. Avoiding new\nconclusions would require already knowing one’s beliefs, that\nis, which conclusions one had already\ndrawn.[7] Transparency theorists will respond by noting that these accounts\ndo not recommend strategies for determining what one believes. They\nsimply aim to explain the provenance of privileged self-attributions,\nby identifying processes that could generate self-attributions with\nthe epistemic features characteristic of self-knowledge. IF my belief\nthat I believe that p is appropriately inferred from my\nawareness of p (Dretske), or based on my basis for believing\nthat p (Fernández), or inferred from the premise\nthat p (Byrne), THEN this belief is especially secure\nself-knowledge, achieved through an exclusively first-personal method.\nThese ways of arriving at self-attributions may not be conscious, and\nneed not be triggered by the thinker’s wondering about her\nbeliefs. Even if they are so triggered, and the process\ncreates a new belief, the self-attributions may nonetheless qualify as\nknowledge (about what one believes at the time of the\nself-attribution). Still, the objection exposes a limit to transparency accounts: they\ncannot distinguish newly-formed judgments from previous dispositional\nbeliefs, and so cannot account for our apparent ability to know what\nwe believe at the time the question “Do you believe\nthat p?” is posed (Gertler 2011b). Byrne responds\nthat  the transparency proposal … is not\nthat one can determine that one believes that p\nat t1 by examining the evidence at a later time t2 and\nconcluding that p. (Byrne 2011a: 208)\n  The significance of this limitation depends on a\nlarger question, as to whether privileged access attaches to\nknowledge of one’s own dispositional beliefs—which on\nmany views are the central type of belief—or only to conscious\nor occurrent judgments. A different objection concerns these accounts’ presumption\nthat self-knowledge need not meet epistemically internalist conditions\non knowledge. Boyle (2011) targets Byrne’s view on this point,\narguing that even if the inference from p to I believe\nthat p reliably yields true (and safe) self-attributions, this\ninference cannot explain self-knowledge since it will not appear\nreasonable to the thinker: after all, in general the fact\nthat p doesn’t imply that I believe that p.\n(Fernández addresses this worry, in arguing that beliefs formed\nthrough the bypass method will seem reasonable to the subject.)\nValaris (2011) argues that the transition from p to I\nbelieve that p is not a genuine inference, since it cannot be\nused in hypothetical contexts—e.g., when one reasons from a\npremise one doesn’t believe, merely to see what follows from\nit. Some transparency theorists extend the account to cover attitudes\nother than belief, such as desires and intentions (Byrne 2011a,\nFernández 2013; for worries about these extensions of\nthe transparency account, see Ashwell 2013a,b). Byrne also extends the\naccount to knowing what one thinks and what one perceives (Byrne 2011b,\n2012b). Other objections to the more general transparency approach to\ndesires and intentions are discussed in 3.7, as\nthey also apply to agentialist versions of transparency.  The accounts of self-knowledge outlined thus far share a common\nfeature: they all construe self-knowledge as a form of empirical\nknowledge. This is not to say that our capacity for reasoning plays no\nrole in these theories; after all, these are intended to explain how\nself-knowledge is achieved by thinkers like us, who can engage in\nordinary reasoning (such as making inferences and recognizing plain\nconceptual truths). But these theories attach no special importance to\nour rationality per se. Rationalist accounts of self-knowledge maintain that our status as\nrational thinkers contributes substantially to self-knowledge.\nAgentialist accounts (discussed in the next section) also take our\nstatus as rational thinkers to contribute substantially to\nself-knowledge, but on agentialist views this contribution is linked\nwith the agency exercised in rational deliberation. I reserve the term\n“rationalist” for accounts that emphasize the\nrationality’s significance for self-knowledge, independent of\nclaims about our cognitive agency. The two leading rationalist views\nare Gallois’ (1996) and Shoemaker’s (1994). Here again is Gallois’ “doxastic schema” (Gallois\n1996): Like Byrne, Gallois maintains that\nreasoning according to the doxastic schema generates\nself-knowledge. But unlike Byrne, Gallois takes the resulting\nself-knowledge to meet epistemically internalist conditions for\nknowledge. Gallois’ claim is that whenever a rational thinker\nconsciously believes that p, she is justified in\nself-attributing that belief. He argues as follows. No rational\nthinker will have a conscious belief unless she regards that belief\nas justified—that is, unless it is subjectively\njustified.  And subjective justification for a belief must be\navailable to the thinker, and recognizable as her subjective\njustification.[8]\nFinally, a rational person who regards herself as justified in\nbelieving that p is justified in self-attributing the belief\nthat p. Gallois’ view is a transparency account, since it denies that\nthe self-attribution of a belief is based on observing or scanning the\nbelief. But the central role played by rationality, in his picture,\nsharply distinguishes it from the empiricist transparency accounts\ndescribed in the previous subsection. This difference enables\nGallois’ account to allow for strong internalist justification\nfor self-attributions. But it also limits that account, to beliefs\nthat the thinker regards as justified. Shoemaker defends a thesis about the extent of self-knowledge known as\n “constitutivism”,[9]\n namely: for rational thinkers, being in\ncertain mental states constitutes knowledge that one is in\nthem.  [A]ll you have to add to the available first-order\nbelief, in order to get the second-order belief is the appropriate\ndegree of intelligence, etc. It is not that adding this pushes the\ncreature into a new state, distinct from any it was in before…\n(Shoemaker 1994: 288–9) Shoemaker limits the constitutivist thesis to rational thinkers who\nhave the appropriate repertoire of mental state concepts (the concepts\nof belief, desire, pain, etc.). His argument that such thinkers must\nbe capable of self-knowledge rests on his objections to perceptual\nmodels of introspection, outlined in  3.2 above: \nnamely, that no such thinker could be incapable of\nself-knowledge (“self-blind”). For a self-blind person\nwould (i) fall into certain conceptual errors, such as asserting\ntransparency-violating sentences (“It’s raining but I\ndon’t believe that it is”); (ii) be unable to communicate\nhis beliefs, and hence to engage in cooperative endeavors; (iii) be\ndevoid of true agency, since agency involves higher-order deliberation\nregarding lower-order states; and (iv) regard himself “as a\nstranger”, e.g., in observing himself taking aspirin without\ngrasping that he was in pain. Importantly, Shoemaker sees the capacity for self-knowledge as an\nessential part of our rational nature. In effect, he is proposing that\nwhat it is for a rational creature to have a belief is, in part, for\nthat creature to be aware of that belief; what it is for a rational\ncreature to be in pain is, in part, for it to be aware of that pain;\netc. He tentatively proposes a functionalist analysis of these\nconstitution relations (ibid.: 287–9). Constitutivism is, on its face, a very optimistic picture of our\naccess to our own mental states. An obvious worry concerns mundane\ncases of ignorance or self-deception. The constitutivist may regard\nsuch phenomena as involving failures of rationality and, therefore,\nas falling outside the scope of the constitutivist thesis. Peacocke\n(1999) worries that, if a mental state partly constitutes the belief\nthat one is in it, then from the thinker’s perspective, the\nlatter belief may seem \nbaseless.[10] Rationalist accounts must strike a delicate balance. The idea that\nour rationality guarantees that we grasp, or are capable of grasping,\nour own mental states is plausible only on a fairly demanding\nconception of what it is to be rational. For example, Gallois’\naccount requires that rational thinkers have access to (what they\nregard as) justification for every conscious belief they possess.\nInsofar as rationalist accounts invoke highly demanding conceptions of\nrationality, one may reasonably wonder whether they truly describes\nthe situation of cognitively flawed creatures like us. The accounts of self-knowledge canvassed thus far treat\nself-knowledge as a largely epistemic phenomenon, concerning the\nthinker’s access to her mental states. But as noted\nin Section 1, some philosophers deny that the\nspecial character of self-attributions is primarily epistemic. One\nversion of this denial charges that by focusing on our access\nto our mental states, standard accounts of self-knowledge portray the\nthinker engaged in self-reflection as passive, a mere spectator (or\ndetector) of a cognitive show.  Agentialists contend that some of our\nmental life expresses our agency—e.g., believing and intending\nare things we do.  Moreover, recognizing an attitude as\none’s own involves seeing it as a commitment for which one is\nresponsible (Burge 1996; Moran 2001; Bilgrami 2006; Boyle 2009; Coliva\n2012a). Here, Moran expresses the agentialist outlook. The phenomena of self-knowledge … are themselves based as\nmuch in asymmetries of responsibility and commitment as they are in\ndifference in capacities or in cognitive access. (Moran 2001:\n64) Agentialism is inspired by a broadly Kantian approach to reason and\nagency, according to which a thinker’s most basic\nself-conception is agential: to regard oneself as “I” is\nto see oneself as an author of thoughts, rather than as\nsomething in which thoughts merely\noccur. This self-conception is also a conception of oneself\nas rational, as a thing that believes and intends (etc.) on\nthe basis of reasons. Agentialists maintain that our rational agency guarantees that we\nare capable of—or even that we possess—self-knowledge. But\nparticular versions of agentialism differ as to the precise link\nbetween agency and self-knowledge. I begin with Burge, who maintains that our responsibility for our\nbeliefs entitles us to self-attributions. To establish this\npoint, Burge uses the following (seemingly transcendental)\nreasoning. Our rational agency confers on us certain\nobligations vis-à-vis our beliefs. In particular, we\nare obligated to (try to) satisfy certain rational norms: that\none’s beliefs should conform to one’s evidence; that a\nbelief set should be internally consistent; etc. In order to satisfy\nthese rational norms—e.g., to assess our beliefs for conformance\nwith our evidence, or for consistency with other beliefs—we must\nrely on judgments as to which beliefs we have. So our responsibility\nto satisfy rational norms epistemically entitles us to those judgments\nabout our attitudes that are crucial for satisfying those norms. [I]f one lacked entitlement to judgments about one’s\nattitudes, one could not be subject to rational norms governing how\none ought to alter those attitudes given that one had reflected on\nthem.  (Burge 1996: 101) The distinctively agentialist dimension of our entitlement to\nself-knowledge is that the relevant judgments about our own attitudes\nare permissible, since they are required for the kind of critical\nreasoning about our attitudes that we are obligated to undertake, in\nour effort to satisfy rational \nnorms.[11] Burge does not describe how we arrive at judgments about our\nattitudes to which we are entitled. What is crucial is that we are\ncapable of the kind of self-knowledge that is needed for critical\nreasoning. When engaged in critical reflection on one’s own\nbeliefs, those beliefs will be directly sensitive to one’s\nreasons: e.g., there will be an “immediate rationally necessary\nconnection” (1996: 109) between the discovery that a particular\nbelief is unjustified and the suspension of that belief. Moran, in contrast, does outline a procedure for achieving\nself-knowledge, namely, the transparency method. He argues that facts\nabout our rational agency justify our use of this method.\n  [A]s I conceive of myself as a rational agent,\n… I can report on my belief about X by considering\n(nothing but) X itself. (Moran 2001: 84)\n  Moran’s account of how the transparency\nmethod yields knowledge differs markedly from empiricist transparency\naccounts (3.5 above). First, on Moran’s\nview considering X itself involves marshaling reasons\nbearing on X. Returning to Evans’ example: in response\nto the question “Do you believe there will be a third world\nwar?”, I directly consider evidence bearing on that question,\ne.g., concerning geopolitics. Second, whereas empiricist transparency\naccounts are entirely compatible with our being passive, relative to\nour attitudes, Moran argues that the transparency procedure provides\nknowledge of one’s own beliefs only insofar as those beliefs\nexpress our rational agency. On his view, the transparency method\njustifies a self-attribution such as “I believe that there will\nbe a third world war” only because reflection on evidence\nenables one to commit to the self-attributed belief. That\nself-attribution is then an avowal: it does not simply\nregister the belief’s presence but expresses commitment to\nit. O’Brien worries that Moran’s account is too\ndemanding. She argues that I am not justified in self-attributing the\nbelief that there will be a third world war, on the basis of\nconsidering geopolitics, unless I recognize that my reasons for\nexpecting a third world war constitute evidence that I believe it will\noccur. But this recognition in turn requires a reflective grasp of the\nnature of deliberation that seems unnecessary for ordinary\nself-attributions (O’Brien 2003: 379–81). Moran accepts that the link between evidence bearing on\nwhether p, and the belief that p, should be\naccessible to ordinary thinkers. His explanation of this link\nillustrates the central significance of rational agency in his larger\nepistemic picture. He reasons as follows. We could not engage in\nrational thought unless we had the epistemic right to “something\nlike a Transcendental assumption of Rational Thought”: the\nassumption that we are rational, in that our attitudes are shaped by\nour reasons. So we do have the epistemic right to that assumption. And\nour right to that assumption gives us the epistemic right to use the\ntransparency method, that is, to answer to the question “do you\nbelieve that p?” by directly marshaling reasons bearing\non p. (Boyle (2009) provides a different argument for a\nMoran-style view.) Bilgrami (2006) also develops an agentialist view of\nself-knowledge.  Like Burge and Moran, Bilgrami regards self-knowledge\nas intimately tied to the phenomenon of rational agency. But his view\nis not merely that, as thinkers responsible for our attitudes, we must\nbe capable of coming to know them (Moran would add: by use of a particular\nmethod). Rather, he argues that we could not exercise the agency\ninvolved in believing unless, in believing, we already knew what we\nbelieved. Beliefs are necessarily known by the thinker because they\nare commitments. [I]t is the nature of commitments that they are [known by the\nthinker]. … [C]ommitments … are states that, were we\nnot to live up to them, we should be prepared to criticize ourselves\nand be prepared also to try and do better, by way of living up to\nthem… We cannot therefore have commitments without believing\nthat we have them. … Thus the very condition for having a\ncommitment presupposes that one has a second-order belief that one\nhas that commitment. (2006: 287) On similar grounds, Bilgrami argues that our agency, relative to\nour commitments, ensures that we will not err in self-ascribing a\ncommitment. This latter claim is also advanced by Coliva (2012a), who develops\na version of agentialism she calls constructivism. Coliva\nargues that self-ascriptions of commitments—which for her\ninclude not only beliefs and intentions but also rationally held\nconative attitudes, such as desires—will always be true\n(provided that the thinker in question is rational and has the\nrelevant concepts), because these self-ascriptions\nwill create the attitudes ascribed. When understood in the way proposed, a judgement (or a sincere\nassertion) such as  “I believe/desire/intend/wish/hope\nthat P” is like a performative, namely like “I\npromise to buy you an ice-cream”… : it makes a certain\nthing happen, for it does create the first-order\npropositional attitude as a commitment. … [This] is possible\nprecisely because judging “I believe/desire/intend/wish/hope\nthat P” becomes just an alternative way of undertaking the same\ncommitments one would make by judging that P (is worth\npursuing or having)… (2012a: 235–6) We now consider the prospects for agentialism generally. Some\ncritics will deny that agentialism can explain the epistemic dimension\nof self-knowledge. Although agentialists generally downplay the\nsignificance of the epistemic, agentialists must explain why certain\nself-attributions qualify as knowledge; otherwise, agentialism is not\na genuine competitor to the accounts of self-knowledge described\nabove.  Because the various versions of agentialism differ as to the\njustification or warrant attaching to judgments about one’s\nattitudes, their responses to this challenge will differ. A possible drawback of agentialism is its limited application.\nIt applies only to attitudes that express our rational agency, and\nhence only to attitudes that are sensitive to reasons. But many of\nour attitudes are insensitive to\n reasons.[12]\n Beliefs that are deeply entrenched (such as superstitions) or\ncomforting (as in wishful thinking) sometimes persevere in the face\nof counter-evidence. Intentions that run counter to one’s\ngoals sometimes withstand practical deliberation.  Desires sometimes\nclash with deeper values. Agentialists generally allow that we may\nhave privileged access to such attitudes, through some observational\nprocess. But they maintain that the need for observation signals\nthat the attitude is problematic. If I can know about my own\nattitude only through observation, then I am “alienated”\n(Moran 2001) from that attitude; my relation to it, qua agent, is\n“brute, contingent, non-rational” (Burge 1996); and I\ncan view it only from a “third-person perspective”\n(Bilgrami 2006) and not “as my own” (Boyle\n 2009).[13] Critics of agentialism maintain that knowing an attitude through an\nobservational process does not preclude a thinker from regarding it\nas her own in the relevant sense. Reed (2010) argues that\nempirical investigation is sometimes required to determine what one\nbelieves on a certain issue: in his example, an economist must\nconsult her previous work to determine her position on a complex\nquestion about taxation, but she nonetheless fully endorses that\nbelief as her own.  Similarly, Lawlor (2009) argues that reflection\non reasons (e.g., on larger goals or values) is sometimes\ninsufficient to grasp our desires.  In such cases, she claims, we\ngrasp a desire only through inference from introspected cues: e.g.,\nimagining the situation in question; noticing that this exercise is\nassociated with a certain phenomenology, say of eager anticipation;\nand inferring that we desire that that situation come\nabout.[14] Expressivist views highlight similarities between utterances like\n“I’m in pain” and direct expressions of one’s\nmental states, such as “ouch!” The most radical version of\nexpressivism—what Bar-On (2004) calls Simple Expressivism,\nsometimes attributed to Wittgenstein—denies that utterances like\n“I’m in pain” are even truth-apt, let alone reflect\nknowledge of one’s mental states. On this view, an utterance\nlike “I’m in pain” expresses only pain, and not the\nbelief or knowledge that one is in pain. This utterance does not\nexpress anything true or false, any more than wincing expresses\nsomething true or false. So while simple expressivism aims to explain\nhow utterances like “I’m in pain” function, it is\nnot an account of self-knowledge. However, the idea that utterances like “I’m in\npain”—avowals—directly express the mental\nstates they ascribe has inspired recent accounts of self-knowledge\n(Finkelstein 2003; Bar-On 2004). These more recent accounts differ\nfrom expressivism in allowing that avowals are true (or false). They\nare aptly characterized as neo-expressivist (borrowing\nBar-On’s label for her own view). Neo-expressivists emphasize the directness with which a mental\nstate can issue in an avowal. In particular, they maintain that no\njudgment to the effect that I’m in pain or desire water\nintervenes between my pain or desire and my utterance “I’m\nin pain” or “I want water”. Just as a wince flows\nfrom my pain directly, and is not based on a judgment to the effect\nthat I’m in pain, a spontaneous avowal like “I want\nwater” flows from my desire directly, unmediated by any\njudgment; but it may be true nonetheless. The central phenomenon that neo-expressivism seeks to explain is\nfirst-person authority: that we ordinarily accept avowals without\nhesitation, and we don’t expect the subject to be in a position\nto cite evidence that she is in pain or wants water.\n(Neo-expressivists allow that these practices, while standard, admit\nof exceptions.[15]) \n The special role of avowals is not\nlimited to public statements; one can avow “in thought”\nwith the same authority involved in spontaneous verbal expressions\n(Bar-On 2004: 9; Finkelstein 2003: 103).  First-person authority\nstems from the fact that it is only the subject herself who can\ndirectly express her states through an avowal. Neo-expressivists differ in how they understand first-person\nauthority and, relatedly, in how the distinctive features of avowals\nrelate to self-knowledge. Finkelstein allows that my avowal “I’m so happy!”\nmay be caused by my happiness. But he denies that this is a matter of\nbrute causation, as hitting someone’s knee with a hammer brutely\ncauses his leg to kick out. Rather, what differentiates these cases is\nthat my happiness and my spontaneous avowal have, we might say, a particular kind of\nintelligibility.  We might speak here of a distinctive logical space\nin which we locate mental items and their expressions along with the\ncircumstances against whose background they have the significances\nthat they do.  (2003: 126) Finkelstein emphasizes that, by “logical space”, he\ndoes not mean that my happiness rationalizes the avowal. (A relevant\ncontrast here is with the reasons account.) Instead, he says, my avowal,\n like my smiling, makes sense\ntogether with my happiness in something like the way that a\ndog’s pain and its moaning make sense together, in “the\nlogical space of animate life”. The dog’s moaning is not\nrationalized by its pain, according to Finkelstein; but nor is it\nmerely an effect of the pain. Since dogs are not usually thought to possess self-knowledge, this\nanalogy raises the question: Does my avowal “I’m\nhappy” represent (or indicate) knowledge that I’m\nhappy? The answer is complex, on Finkelstein’s view. He denies\nthat my happiness constitutes epistemic justification for my avowal;\nin fact, he denies that avowals are the sort of things that are\njustified.  Whether the avowing subject is to be credited with\nself-knowledge depends, he thinks, on how one understands\n“knowledge”: in particular, on whether one takes knowledge\nto require justification. For both Finkelstein and Bar-on, the explanation of avowals’\nauthority—the fact that we ordinarily accept avowals at face\nvalue, and don’t expect an avowing subject to have evidence in\nsupport of her avowal—is non-epistemic. Avowals are\nauthoritative, not because the avowing subject has\nspecial epistemic access to the states they ascribe, but\nsimply because avowals express mental states directly. But for Bar-On, unlike Finkelstein, explaining first-person\nauthority is a separate project from explaining the epistemic\ndimension of self-knowledge. Bar-On maintains that the avowal\n“I’m so happy!” can represent “genuine and\nprivileged self-knowledge” (Bar-On 2004: 405), although the\navowing subject typically has not “formed the active judgment\n[that he is happy] on some basis”, and cannot offer evidence\nbearing on his happiness (2004: 363). She is not committed to a\nparticular account of how avowals constitute knowledge, but\nshe presents a number of approaches compatible with her\nneo-expressivism. To give a sense of the epistemic resources available to the\nneo-expressivist, I’ll briefly describe one approach that Bar-On\npresents. On this approach, my happiness confers a positive epistemic\nstatus on my avowal “I’m so happy!” by being the\nreason for that avowal. This approach exploits an idea central to the\nreasons account, viz. that a\nconscious state can justify a self-ascription directly, without\nmediation by a judgment to the effect that one is in that state. (The\nneo-expressivist might balk at Peacocke’s requirement that the\nreason must be accessible to the knowing subject.) A subject who avows\nthat p “would accept p upon considering\nit”. Insofar as my happiness is the reason for my\navowal, I am warranted in the belief expressed by “I’m so\nhappy!”.  [A]vowing subjects enjoy a special epistemic warrant,\nsince their pronouncements, when true, are epistemically grounded in\nthe very states they ascribe to themselves, which states also serve\nas the reasons for their acts of avowing. This special warrant\naccrues to subjects only when issuing present-tense self-ascriptions\nof occurrent mental states, and only when they do so in the avowing\nmode—that is, only when they exercise their first-person\nprivilege. (Bar-On 2004: 405) This “first-person privilege” stems from the fact that\nonly the subject can directly express her states. Doubts about neo-expressivism center on the question whether it\ntruly explains knowledge of our mental states. One might question\nwhether avowals, which issue from the states they\nascribe directly, can represent the kind of epistemic\nachievement ordinarily associated with robust\nself-knowledge. (Epistemic internalists will be particularly likely to\nharbor doubts on this score.) But as we saw above, accounting for\nknowledge is not a primary goal of Finkelstein’s account. And\neven for a neo-expressivist like Bar-On, who is concerned to identify\npossible sources of epistemic warrant for avowals, explaining why\nsubjects’ attitudes towards the mental states they self-ascribe\nepistemically qualifies as knowledge is, at most, a peripheral\ngoal. The core of neo-expressivism is its non-epistemic account of\nphenomena often associated with self-knowledge, namely, first-person\nauthority.","contact.mail":"gertler@virginia.edu","contact.domain":"virginia.edu"}]
