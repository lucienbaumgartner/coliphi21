[{"date.published":"2019-10-03","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-law/","author1":"Michael Moore","entry":"causation-law","body.text":"\n\n\nIn this context the basic questions concerning causation in the law\nare: (i) what are the criteria in law for deciding whether one action\nor event has caused another (generally harmful) event; (ii) whether\nand to what extent causation in legal contexts differs from causation\noutside the law, for example, in science and everyday life; and (iii)\nwhat reason(s) (presumably based in the law’s use of causation\nto attribute responsibility) explain and/or justify such differences\nas may be found to exist.\n\nSeemingly the central interests that justify having an entry on\ncausation in the law in a philosophy encyclopedia are: to understand\njust what is the law’s concept of causation, if it has one; to\nsee how that concept compares to the concept of causation is use in\nscience and in everyday life; and to examine what reason(s) there are\njustifying or explaining whatever differences there may be between the\ntwo concepts of causation. Other entries in this encyclopedia deal\nwith the nature of causation as that relation is referred to in\nscience and in everyday life. The philosophical interest in the\nlaw’s concept of causation is largely comparative: how does the\nlaw’s concept differ, if at all, from the more general concept\nof causation analyzed in philosophy, and are there good reasons\nexplaining why there are such differences? \nThese three questions—what is the law’s concept of\ncausation and how and why does it differ from the general notion of\ncausation in science and everyday life—are deceptively simple in\ntheir appearance. Yet describing a concept like causation as it is\nused in a body of discourse such as law, depends on a number of\nvariables examination of which early-on will precisify the questions\nlater pursued in this entry. These preliminary, clarificatory\nvariables are four in number. \nFirst: human law, unlike the “natural law” of morality, is\ninherently parochial in the sense that human law varies from place to\nplace. (It does this because human law’s existence depends in\npart upon facts of institutional history and these facts vary from\nplace to place.) So the question, “whose law?”, looms\nlarge at the start of an enquiry such as this. What follows describes\ncausation as it is used in what may broadly be called the\nAnglo-American legal tradition—the legal tradition of the United\nKingdom, the domains of its Commonwealth, and the United States.\nDespite this confession of a somewhat parochial focus, there are\nnonetheless universalist implications of this analysis. This is\nbecause there are strong similarities in the legal uses of causation\nin all presently existing legal systems, even when one is not confined\nto those of the English-speaking world.  \nSecond, even when we restrict our focus to the law of some one legal\ntradition, within that tradition there will be discrete areas of law\nthat make use of causation in their liability rules, such as the areas\nof contracts, torts, property, constitutional, and criminal law within\nthe Anglo-American legal tradition. It is arguable that the precise\ncontours (and maybe even the central notion) of causation differs\nbetween such areas; for example, it is plausible to think that there\nis a significant difference between contract law’s notion of\nconsequential damages following upon breach and criminal law’s\nnotion of the proximate causation needed to make out a completed crime\n(Moore 2009a: Appendix). Accordingly, to prescind from any such\ndifferences as may exist between areas of law, this entry focuses on\nwhat those within the Anglo-American legal tradition regard as the\ndominant usage of causation in the law, which usage is to assign\nresponsibility to actors who cause harms to others. The areas\nof law where such assignment of cause-based responsibility\npredominates is in the law of crimes and the law of torts. The entry\naccordingly focuses on those two areas of law because they are central\nto the Anglo-American (and probably to any) legal system’s use\nof causation. They are also the areas of law in which (by far) the\ngreatest attention has been paid to causation in both law and legal\ntheory. \nThird, we need to distinguish propositions of law containing\nthe concept of causation, from propositions about the law of\ncausation. Our concern is with the former kinds of propositions; the\nlatter propositions are the hypotheses of theorists (such as the\npresent writer) about the content of the propositions that obligate\nlegal professionals within their roles as legal professionals, i.e.,\nlaw. But it is the law itself that is the data from which a\nlegal concept such as causation-in-the-law is to be extracted. \nFourth, teasing out the contours of a concept such as causation from a\nbody of discourse such as the law is not (just) a matter of quoting or\nparaphrasing explicit legal definitions of that concept, no matter how\nauthoritative such definitions purport to be. Legal definitions of\ncausation are only the start of an analysis of what\n“cause” means in law. Also needed are two other items. One\nis the implicit concept of cause to be teased out from usages\nof the concept in propositions of law. Complex legal concepts as used\nin the decided cases will only rarely coincide completely with\nofficial legal definitions (which Roscoe Pound [1910] called,\nrespectively, “the law in action” and “the law in\nthe books”), even when such definitions speak univocally in\nfavor of some particular concept. \nThe other additional item needed is the purpose or value served by\nlegal doctrines employing a concept of causation. Legal concepts are\nfunctional (sometimes styled, “interpretive”) concepts in\nthat their meaning is shaped by the values they serve in the doctrines\nin which they appear, as much as it is shaped by the linguistic\n(definitional and usage) facts above mentioned (Fuller 1958).  \nThe law’s concept of causation is thus a product of three\nfactors in combination: \nIn addition to these three factors (and remembering the cautionary,\nthird point made earlier distinguishing propositions of law from\npropositions about law), there are theories about what\ncausation does or should mean in law. Such theories have been proposed\nby legal theorists as they utter propositions about law. Such\ntheories, despite their non-authoritative source, have played a major\nrole in the history of thought about the nature of causation in the\nlaw. Some of such theories, to the extent their content accurately\nmirrors propositions of law, have even become part of the law of which\nthey are theories (Raz 2012). \nThe conventional wisdom about the causation requirement in both\ncriminal law and torts is that it in reality consists of two very\ndifferent requirements for liability. The first requirement is that of\n“cause in fact”. Such conventional wisdom holds that the\n“cause-in-fact” requirement is the only truly\ncausal component of the law’s two requirements (despite\nthe fact that both are framed in causal terms), because this doctrine\nis the only one that corresponds with any scientific or even factual\nnotion of causation. Whether cigarette smoking causes cancer, whether\nthe presence of hydrogen or helium caused an explosion, are factual\nquestions to be resolved by the best science the courts can muster,\nand these are classed as “cause-in-fact” questions. By\ncontrast, it is contested whether the second requirement, that of\n“proximate” or “legal” cause, is an evaluative\nissue, to be resolved by arguments of policy, or whether it too is a\nmatter of causal fact. Suppose a defendant knifes his victim, who then\ndies because her religious convictions are such that she refuses\nmedical treatment while knowing that such refusal will kill her\n(Regina v. Blaue). Has such a defendant (legally) caused her\ndeath? The doctrines of proximate cause are used to resolve such\nquestions, it being controversial whether such resolutions are matters\nof natural fact or of moral fact (“policy”). \nThose who accept the conventional division of causation in the law\ninto two parts, then posit a very minimalist notion of the first\nrequirement, that of “cause-in-fact”. This minimalist\nrequirement is by far the dominant explicit test for cause in fact in\nboth torts and criminal law. It is the “sine qua\nnon”, or “but-for” test. Such a test asks a\ncounterfactual question: “but for the defendant’s action,\nwould the victim have been harmed as she was?” This test is also sometimes\ncalled the necessary condition test, because it requires the\ndefendant’s action have been necessary to the victim’s\nharm. The appeal of this test stems from this fact. The test seems to\nisolate something we seem to care a lot about, both in explaining\nevents and in assessing responsibility for them, namely, did the\ndefendant’s act make a difference\nvis-à-vis how the world would have been had she not\ndone what she did? Insofar as we increase moral blameworthiness and\nlegal punishment for actors who cause bad results (and not\njust try to), we seemingly should care whether a particular bad result\nwould have happened anyway, even without the defendant. \nThere is no equivalently clear, crisp definition of legal or proximate\ncause. At the general level of an overall definition, the most one\ngets are the bromides: that a proximate cause cannot be\nremote from its putative effect; it must be a direct\ncause of the effect; it must not involve such\nabnormality of causal route that is freakish; it\ncannot be of harms that were unforeseeable to the actor; its\nconnection to the harm cannot be coincidental; it must make\nthe harm more probable; etc. These bromides are often uttered\nas if they were synonyms, which in truth the decided cases reveal that\nthey are not. \nTo the definitions just mentioned, we should add the usage facts about\nhow “causation” is used in resolving the problems that\narise in particular cases. This allows one to compare the\nexplicit legal definitions of causation that we have just\nsurveyed with the concept of causation implicit in the\ndecided cases. It also allows philosophers to compare their favored\nresolutions of various causal conundrums with the resolutions of those\nsame conundrums by people who have no philosophical axes to grind but\nwhose deliberations carry real world consequences with them, i.e.,\njudges. (As J.L. Austin (1957) said, philosophers may have as much to\nlearn from lawyers on such issues as causation, as lawyers do from\nphilosophers.) With considerable selectivity, some simplification, and\nlittle claim to completeness, fifteen facts are below selected as\nsalient in the legal usage of the concept of causation. \n1. In cases of actions rather than omissions, usually (but not\nalways—see the discussion below of the action-overdetermination\ncases) if the harm did not counterfactually depend on the\ndefendant’s action, then the defendant is not liable for that\nharm because he is not said to have caused it (American Law Institute\n1962). \n2. If the defendant’s act does not increase the probability of\nsome harm occurring, and particularly if that act decreases such\nprobability, then the defendant is not liable for that harm because he\nis not said to have caused it, even if that harm’s occurrence\ncounterfactually depended on the defendant’s action\n(Oxendine v. State). \n3. With regard to liability for omissions, usually there is no\nliability for omitting to prevent some harm even in cases where there\nis counterfactual dependence of the occurrence of that harm on that\nomission; yet sometimes (the status, undertaking, and causing of peril\nexceptions) there is such liability (so long as the occurrence of the\nharm counterfactually depends on such omission; Dressler 1995:\n466–467). \n4. With regard to liability for “double preventions”\n(where, for example, a defendant prevents a lifeguard from preventing\nanother from drowning), usually there is a supposedly cause-based\nliability for the unprevented harm in such cases because a defendant\npreventing a preventer from preventing some harm is regarded as the\ncause of that harm. Yet sometimes (for double preventions amounting to\nthe “allowings” as conceived by the centuries-old\ndoing/allowing distinction) double preventions are treated just like\nomissions so that there is no legal causation and no liability except\nfor those exceptional circumstances (the status, undertaking, and\ncausing of peril exceptions) that exist for omission liability (Moore\n2009a: 61–65, 459–460). \n5. In cases of probability-raising actions, omissions, and\ndoubly-preventative actions, there is occasionally and inconsistently\nstill no liability for harms that counterfactually depend on such\nactions, omissions, and double preventions if such harm does not also\ncounterfactually depend on that aspect of those actions, etc., that\nmade the defendant culpable. \n6. There is a complex pattern of liability for multiple cause cases\ninvolving actions: First, in ordinary, garden-variety concurrent cause\ncases (two or more factors individually necessary and only jointly\nsufficient for some harm), there is commonly liability even though the\ndefendant’s act is but one of many causal factors producing a\nharm and such liability is full (“joint and several”)\nindividual liability of such co-causing joint tort-feasors in torts\nand co-causing principals in criminal law. Second, in the symmetrical\noverdetermination variety of concurrent cause cases (where two or more\nfactors are individually sufficient and only jointly necessary for\nsome harm), there is universally liability where the acts of each of\ntwo or more culpable defendants is independently sufficient (and thus\nnot individually necessary) for the harm, and there is almost always\nliability where the sufficient condition alternative to the\ndefendant’s action is not the act of another human agent but is\na natural event or condition such as an avalanche. Third, there is\nalso liability in mixed cases (“mixed” between\noverdetermination and garden variety concurrent cause cases in that\nthere are three or more factors, any two of which are sufficient for\nthe harm, meaning no factor is individually necessary for that harm;\nJohnson 2016). Fourth, there is also liability in asymmetrical\noverdetermination concurrent cause cases, these being cases where one\nfactor is sufficient and other factors are neither individually\nnecessary nor individually sufficient, such liability uniformly being\nimposed for the big cause (the sufficient factor) and non-uniformly\nand inconsistently being imposed for the little causes (the\ninsufficient and unnecessary factors; Wright 1985b). Fifth, in the\npre-emptive variety of multiple cause cases (where one sufficient\nfactor pre-empts another equally sufficient factor from operating on\nthis occasion), there is liability for the pre-empting sufficient\nfactor but there is no liability for the pre-empted sufficient\nfactor. \n7. There is also a complex pattern of liability for a harm in multiple\ncause cases involving omissions that is different than it is for\nactions, even when we restrict our gaze to omission cases where there\nis a legal duty on each omitter not to omit to prevent that harm:\nFirst, there is liability on each omitter in ordinary, garden-variety,\nconcurrent omission cases just as there is in multiple cause cases\ninvolving actions and not omissions. Second, predominantly (but not\nuniversally) there is no liability for the overdetermination\nvariety of concurrent omissions—this is universally true where\none of the absences sufficient for the occurrence of the harm is\nnatural, not human, and it is predominantly true where all of the\nabsences individually sufficient for the occurrence of the harm are\nthe omissions of culpable human actors (Fisher 1992). Third, there are\nno pre-emptive omission cases because such cases are conceptually\nimpossible, and thus any liability questions here are moot (Moore\n2011b: 479–482; 2013: 342–348). \n8. There is also a complex pattern of liability for a harm in multiple\ncause cases involving double preventions rather than actions or\nomissions, and this pattern of liability is different yet again than\nit is in cases of actions or omissions: First there is liability in\nordinary, garden-variety, concurrent double-prevention cases just as\nthere is for actions and omissions. Second, there is predominantly\n(but not universally) no liability for the overdetermination\nvariety of concurrent double-preventions—this is universally\ntrue where one of the doubly-preventative acts sufficient for the\noccurrence of the harm is a natural event, not a culpable human\naction, and it is predominantly true where all doubly-preventative\nacts sufficient for the occurrence of the harm are the actions of\nculpable human actors (Moore 2009a: 466–467). Third, unlike in\nomission cases, there is such a thing as a pre-emptive double\nprevention case; in such cases, there is liability for the pre-empting\ndouble prevention but not for the pre-empted action that would\notherwise have been a double prevention (Moore 2011b). \n9. Liability exists for harms caused by a defendant even though such\nharms would not have occurred but for the victim’s freakishly\nabnormal condition so long as that condition pre-existed the\ndefendant’s action (this is the common law’s\n“thin-skulled man” or “you take your victim as you\nfind him” maxim). \n10. Yet no liability exists for harms in part caused by a defendant if\nthat harm was also in part caused by a freakishly large natural event\nthat intervened between the defendant’s act and the harm that he\nin part caused (the “vis major” part of the\ncommon law’s “superseding cause” doctrine; Larremore\n1909). \n11. There is no liability for harms due to a “coincidence”\n(defined as a freakishly unusual conjunction of events) even though\nsuch harms would not have occurred but for the defendant’s\nculpable action, so long as that coincidence is not used by the\ndefendant as a means to bringing about the harm (another part of the\ncommon law’s “superseding cause” doctrine; Hart\n& Honoré 1959, 1985). \n12. Intention has supposed aphrodisiac powers to extend legally\nrelevant causal influence to what otherwise would be legally remote\nevents (the “no harm is too remote if intended” maxim of\nthe common law; Terry 1914: 17). \n13. Under the intervening human actor branch of the common law’s\nsuperseding cause doctrine, there is no liability if a subsequent\nhuman actor (rather than a natural event) intervenes to “break\nthe causal chain” otherwise existing (because of counterfactual\ndependence) between the harm and the defendant’s earlier act,\nwhere that intervening actor: \n14. The set of doctrines presupposing scalarity of the causal relation\nas that relation is used in law (moore 2009a: 65–76, 118–123): \n15. The absence of liability in the freakish route cases even when a\nharm counterfactually depends on the defendants act, including both\ncases where the route is freakish vis-à-vis the\ndefendant’s plans or expectation, and cases where the route is\nfreakish to an outside observer. \nThere are two reasons to care about the rationale for the law’s\nuse of causation in the liability doctrines of tort and criminal law.\nThe less relevant one here is the legal reformer’s motive, which\nis to assess what the best test for causation is and to recommend that\nsuch a test ought to be legislated for future legal use. The\nsecond, and the more relevant motive here, is the lawyer’s\nmotive, which is to understand what the requirement for causation\npresently is under existing law. As was previewed in\n section 1,\n what the law provides on a given topic like causation is in part\nconstituted by the function such a requirement serves in a body of\nlaw, and such function thus constitutes the third ingredient we need\nto consult as we reconstruct the law’s concept of causation. \nLawyers and legal theorists alike have an unfortunate penchant for\nproclaiming that the law is, should be, and must be,\nautonomous from other disciplines (such as philosophy) in its\nuse of concept like causation (Stapleton 2008; 2015). As Sir Frederick\nPollack put it over a century ago, “the lawyer cannot afford to\nadventure himself with philosophers in the logical and metaphysical controversies that beset the idea of\ncause” (1901: 36). Yet whether such conceptual autonomy is\ndesirable, necessary, or even possible, presupposes that the law has\npurposes for its causal requirements that do not dovetail with the\nmetaphysics of causation so studied by philosophy. \nAs we will see below in\n section 5.2,\n the legal economists and other utilitarians believe that legal rules\nattaching liability to those who cause harm, have as their\nrationale preventing sub-optimal levels of such harms; they do this by\nincentivizing future behavior by the placement of liability (or\nrewards) on past behavior. On such a view, causation in the law might\nwell mean something different than it means when used in ordinary or\nscientific discourse—for to gain incentive effects from\ncause-based liability rules, one might well identify\n“cause” with the raising of conditional probability, as\nthe legal economists have indeed often urged. \nAn alternative view of legal purposes, however, returns the law to the\nmetaphysics of causation. That view holds that criminal law serves the\nvalue of retributive justice just as tort law serves the value of\ncorrective justice. Retributive justice requires that those who\nculpably cause harm suffer the censure and deprivations constitutive\nof punishment; corrective justice requires that those who culpably\ncause harm to another correct that injustice by compensating that\nother. In both cases, serving such kinds of justice demands that one\nnot identify “cause” as used in legal liability\nrules as anything other than that with which it is identified in such\njustice theories. Because such moral theories of justice require that\nthe true metaphysics of causation determines when someone has\ncaused an injury or other harm to another, so too must the\nlaw of torts and of crimes. On such an alternative view of the\nrationale for causal requirements in the law of torts and of crimes,\nthe lawyer thus must “adventure herself with the\nphilosopher” on the metaphysics of causation. Those who so\nadventure themselves will not regard all the candidates for the\nlaw’s concept of causation with equal favor. \nWhat the law of causation needs to be if it is to serve the\nvalue(s) constituting the function of the rules in which causation\nappears, thus makes a considerable difference to what the law of\ncausation is. As we proceed to describe what the law’s\nconcept of causation is, we should be eclectic on what these values\nare. We shall thus regard as unsettled what most theorists regard as\nsettled (not that they agree on how it is settled), and\nconsider things not only from the perspective of those who think that\ncriminal law and torts serve the ends of retributive and corrective\njustice, but also from the perspectives of those who think that these\nareas of law serve other values (both utilitarian and otherwise), or\neven no coherent set of values at all. \nHow one should combine these three ingredients—the explicit\nlegal definitions of causation, the concept implicit in legal usages\nof “causation”, and the value(s) served by requiring that\ncausation be present before one be held responsible for some\nharm—is a contested matter about which legal theorists have long\ndisagreed. The discussion that follows does not attempt to suppress\nthese disagreements. Different consolidations are thus described and\nsome problems are raised for each. \nThe supposed dominance of the sine qua non test in the law is\nsuperficial. The reality is that that test is modified/abandoned in a\nvariety of ways by the courts that are supposedly applying it. The\nbest way to understand the various modified tests for cause in fact in\nlaw is by examining problems that have been raised for the\ncounterfactual test, for it is these problems that motivate\nalternative tests of cause in fact. \nVery generally, there are four sorts of problems with the\ncounterfactual test for causation in fact that are raised in the legal\nliterature. The first of these problems has to do with proof and\nevidence. As an element of the prima facie case, causation in fact\nmust be proven by the party with the burden of proof. In criminal\ncases, that is the prosecution, who must prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt what would have happened absent the defendant’s act.\nCounterfactuals by their nature are difficult to prove with any degree\nof certainty, for they require the fact finder to speculate what would\nhave happened if the defendant had not done what she in actual fact\ndid. Suppose a defendant culpably destroys a life preserver on a\nseagoing tug. When a crewman falls overboard and drowns, was a\nnecessary condition of his death the act of the defendant in\ndestroying the life preserver? (New York Central RR. v.\nGrimstad). If the life preserver had been there, would anyone\nhave thought to use it? thrown it in time? thrown it far enough?\ngotten it near enough to the victim that he would have reached it? We\noften lack the kind of precise information that could verify whether\nthe culpable act of the defendant made any difference in this way. \nA second set of problems stems from an indeterminacy of meaning in the\ntest, not from difficulties of factual verification. There is a great\nvagueness in counterfactual judgments. The vagueness lies in\nspecifying the possible world in which we are to test the\ncounterfactual (Cole 1964a,b; Lewis 1973b). Suppose a\ndefendant negligently destroyed a life preserver and a sailor drowns\nfor want of one. When we say “But for the defendant’s act\nof destroying the life preserver”, what world are we imagining?\nWe know we are to eliminate the defendant’s act, but what are we\nto replace it with? A life preserver that was, alternatively,\ndestroyed by the heavy seas? A defendant who didn’t destroy the\nlife preserver because she had already pushed the victim overboard\nwhen no one else was around to throw the life preserver to the victim?\nAnd so on and so on. To make the counterfactual test determinate\nenough to yield one answer rather than another, we have to assume that\nthose applying this test share an ability to specify some definite\npossible world that is “similar” to our actual world save\nthat in that world the defendant did not do what she did in the actual\nworld. \nThe third and fourth sets of problems stem from the inability of the\ncounterfactual test to match what for most of us (including judges)\nare firm causal intuitions. The third set of problems arises because\nthe counterfactual test seems too lenient in what it counts as a\ncause. The criticism is that the test is thus overinclusive. The\nfourth set of problems arises because the counterfactual test seems\ntoo stringent in what it counts as a cause. The criticism here is that\nthe test is underinclusive. \nThe overinclusiveness of the test has mostly been raised in cases of\ncoincidence. Suppose a defendant culpably delays his train at\nt1; much, much later at t2, and\nmuch further down the track, the train is hit by a flood (Denny v.\nNew York Central RR). Had the delay at t1 not\noccurred, there would have been no damage or loss of life at\nt2. In this case, the counterfactual test yields the\nunwelcome result that the defendant’s delaying caused the harm.\nSuch cases of overt coincidences are rare, but they are the tip of the\niceberg here, in that innumerable remote conditions are necessary to\nthe production of any event. Oxygen in the air over England, timber in\nScotland, Henry VIII’s obesity, and Sir Francis Drake’s\nperspicuity, were all probably necessary for England’s defeat of\nthe Spanish Armada; but we should be loath to say that each of these\nwas a cause of that defeat. The problem is greatly exacerbated by the\nadmission of omissions as causes: the Spanish Armada was also defeated\nbecause Martian spaceships didn’t show up to help them. \nThe fourth set of problems for the counterfactual test has to do with\nthe test’s underinclusiveness, mostly exhibited in legal theory\nin the well-known overdetermination cases. These are cases in which\neach of a pair of two events, c1 and\nc2, is independently sufficient for some third event\ne. Logically, the sufficiency of c1 and of\nc2 entails that neither c1 nor\nc2 is individually necessary for e, and thus,\non the counterfactual analysis of causation, neither of them can be\nthe cause of e. The law uniformly rejects this conclusion\n(howevermuch some philosophers such as David Lewis have claimed\nuncertainty in their own intuitions about there being causation in\nsuch cases), so such cases pose a real problem for the counterfactual\nanalysis of causation in law. \nLegal theorists have long distinguished two distinct kinds of\noverdetermination cases. The first are the concurrent cause cases: two\nfires, two shotgun blasts, two noisy motorcycles are each sufficient\nto burn, kill, or scare some victim. The defendant is responsible for\nonly one fire, shot, or motorcycle. Yet his fire, shot, or noise joins\nthe other one, and both simultaneously cause their various harms. On\nthe counterfactual analysis, the defendant’s fire, shot, or\nnoise was not the cause of any harm because it was not necessary to\nthe production of the harms—after all, the other fire, shot, or\nnoise was by itself sufficient. Yet the same can be said\nabout the second fire, shot, or noise. So on the but-for test, neither\nwas the cause! And this conclusion has seemed absurd to legal\ndecision-makers. \nThe preemptive kind of overdetermination cases are different. Here the\ntwo putative causes are not simultaneous but are temporally ordered.\nThe defendant’s fire arrives first and burns down the\nvictim’s building; the second fire arrives shortly thereafter\nand would have been sufficient to burn down the building, only there\nwas no building to burn down. Here our intuitions are just as clear as\nin the concurrent overdetermination cases, but those intuitions are\nhere different: the defendant’s fire did cause the harm, and the\nsecond fire did not. Yet the counterfactual analysis again yields the\ncounterintuitive implication that neither fire caused the harm because\nneither fire was necessary (each being sufficient) for the harm. \nSituated rather nicely between these two sorts of overdetermination\ncases are what have been called the asymmetrical overdetermination\ncases (Moore 2009a: 417–18). Suppose one defendant non-mortally\nstabs the victim at the same time that another defendant mortally\nstabs the same victim; the victim dies of loss of blood, most of the\nblood gushing out of the mortal wound. Has the non-mortally wounding\ndefendant caused the death of the victim? Not according to the\ncounterfactual analysis: given the sufficiency of the mortal would,\nthe nonmortal wound was not necessary for, and thus not a cause of,\ndeath. This conclusion is contrary to common intuition as well as\nconsiderable (but not universal) legal authority (People v.\nLewis). \nDefenders of the counterfactual analysis of\n“cause-in-fact” are not bereft of replies to these four\nobjections, but rather than pursuing this further we shall move on to\ndiscuss other tests that have been substituted for the counterfactual\ntest in an attempt to avoid these four problems. With regard to the\nproblem posed by the overdetermination cases, the best known\nalternative is to propose an “INUS” (an Insufficient but\nNecessary element of an Unnecessary but Sufficient set) test (Mackie\n1980) or a “NESS” (Necessary Element of a Sufficient Set)\ntest (Wright 1985b; 2013): an event c causes an event e\nif and only if c is a necessary element in a set of conditions\nsufficient for e where the set itself need not be necessary for\ne. It is the stress on sufficiency in these tests that\nis supposed to end-run the overdetermination problems. In the\nconcurrent cause cases—the two sufficient fires joining to burn\nthe victim’s house—each fire is said to be a necessary\nelement of its own sufficient set, so each fire is a cause. In the\npreemptive case—the fires do not join and one arrives first\nbefore the second can get there to do the job—the first fire is\na necessary element of a sufficient set, and so is the cause; the\nsecond fire is not, because it is not thought to be part of a set that\nis sufficient at the time of the destruction (absent from its set is\nthe existence of a house to be burned). \nOther modifications of the counterfactual test have also been adopted\nin order to avoid problems for the test existing because of the\noverdetermination cases. One of these is the “fine-grained\neffect” approach of the Commentary to the Model Penal Code. On\nthis test, one does not ask whether a harm of a certain type\nwould have occurred but for the defendant’s act; rather, one\nasks whether the particular harm that actually occurred would\nhave occurred in the exact way that it did, in the absence of the\ndefendant’s act. So in the concurrent cause case of the two\nindependently sufficient fires that join to burn down the\nvictim’s house, we do not ask,  \nWas the defendant’s fire necessary to a destruction of\nplaintiff’s house?  \nRather, we ask,  \nWas the defendant’s act necessary to the destruction of\nthe victim’s house where, when, and in the manner that it was\ndestroyed?  \nIt is much more likely that the defendant’s fire was\nnecessary to the destruction of the victim’s house in just the\nway it was destroyed, so the counterfactual test seems to do better in\nthe concurrent overdetermination cases with this fine-graining of the\neffect approach. \nFor the preemptive overdetermination cases, the problem is easier for\nthe counterfactual test. Here one introduces a stipulation about the\ntime of the event: if the defendant’s act was necessary to the\nhouse destruction being earlier than it otherwise would have been,\nthen he was the cause, but if his act was only necessary to the house\ndestruction happening at some time or other (including later), his act\nis not necessarily the cause. As the cases put this point, causes must\naccelerate their effects; if they fail to accelerate them\n(either by making no change in temporal location or by retarding\nthem), then such factors are not causes even though necessary to when\nthe putative effect happened (Oxendine v. State). This helps\nwith the preemptive cause cases because a preempting fire is necessary\nto a house’s destruction at t1, even if (given that\nthere is a preempted fire right behind it at t2)\nthat first fire is not necessary either to a house destruction later\n(at t2) or to a house destruction sometime\n(t1 or t2). This stipulation\nregarding temporally asymmetrical necessity should be regarded as a\nthird modification of the law’s counterfactual test. \nThe coincidence objection to the counterfactual test yields a fourth\nmodification to that test. In cases like that of the negligently\nspeeding train that, because of its speed, arrives at just the place\nwhere a falling tree hits it (Berry v. Borough of Sugar\nNotch), one should not ask, “But for the act of driving\nwould the train have been hit?” Rather, one should isolate\nthat aspect of the act that made it negligent—speeding,\nnot the act itself—and ask whether that aspect was necessary to the\ntrain having been struck.  And arguably driving in excess of the speed\nlimit (“speeding”) was not necessary for the impact because any speed\nabove as well as below the speed limit would have resulted in no\nimpact on the train.  Speeding, in other words, wasn't necessary, only\nthe exact speed at which the driver in fact drove.  Asking after the\nnecessity of qualities of acts like speeding is called the\n“aspect cause” version of the counterfactual test (Keeton\n1963; Wright 1985b). \nA fifth modification to the counterfactual test of cause in fact is\nmore by way of substitution than of amendment. This is the First and\nSecond Restatement of Torts “substantial factor”\ntest. Motivated mostly by worries about overdetermination cases, the\nAmerican Law Institute in both of its first two Restatements\nurged that a “substantial factor” test be substituted for\nsine qua non as the test for cause-in-fact in torts. The test\nasks only whether a defendant’s action was a substantial factor\nin the production of the harm complained of. This admittedly circular\nand vague test was thought to help in overdetermination cases like\nthat of the joint fires, because so long as each fire was quite\nsubstantial (in comparison to the other fire) each was a cause of the\nharm, even though neither fire was a necessary condition of the\nharm. \nNotice that the substantial factor test “solves” the\noverdetermination problem mostly because it does not say enough to get\nitself into trouble in such cases. It thus allows our clear causal\nintuitions full play in these cases. The ad hoc nature of\nthis solution is evident when one sees how the First and Second\nRestatement of Torts managed to salvage what they could of\nthe sine qua non test: if a putative causal factor is a\nnecessary condition of some harm, then (under the\nRestatements) it is per se substantial. Necessary\ncondition–hood, in other words, is sufficient for cause\nin fact. But necessary condition–hood is not necessary\nfor cause in fact, so that a factor can be substantial even if it is\nnot a necessary condition. This amounts to saying that one should use\nthe necessary condition test when it works, but when it yields\ncounterintuitive results (as in the overdetermination cases) one\nshouldn’t use it but should rely instead on causal intuitions\nthat are not based on counterfactual relations. As much is admitted in\na recent revival of the two Restatements’ primitivism\nabout causation, according to which one is explicitly directed to find\neither counterfactual dependence of a harm or “actual\ncontribution” to that harm (Stapleton 2015). \nThe sixth and final modification of the counterfactual test of cause\nin fact is motivated by the proof problem. Particularly in criminal\ncases (where one has to prove causation “beyond a reasonable\ndoubt”) it is often impossible to prove that the harm would not\nhave happened but for the defendant’s act. What courts in effect\nadopt is a “lost chance” approach to counterfactuals. On\nthis modified test, one does not ask whether the act was necessary to\nthe harm actually occurring; rather, one asks only whether the act was\nnecessary to the harm having the chance of occurring that it did\n(Lewis 1986). This is a “necessary to chance (of harm)”\nsort of test, not a “necessary to harm” test (Johnson 2005). \nWhat courts and legal theorists have actually done in\n“modifying” the counterfactual test in these six ways is\nto propose quite different theories about the nature of causation. The\nINUS and NESS tests, for example, are in reality nomic sufficiency\ntests, a version of a generalist theory of\ncausation that reduces singular causal relations to general causal\nlaws and does not make essential use of counterfactuals (except\ninsofar as counterfactuals are part of the analysis of the idea of a\nscientific law.) The substantial factor test, to take another example,\nis really the law’s version of a primitivist approach to\nsingular causation, a version of singularist theories of causation in\nmetaphysics. The necessary-to-chance modification is in\nreality the substitution of a probabilistic theory of causation for a\npurely counterfactual theory. It is thus a mistake to think that the\nlaw’s explicit definition of cause in fact—sine qua\nnon—in fact evidences any deep or univocal commitment of\nthe law to a theory of causation that is truly counterfactual in its\nnature (as is for example Lewis 1973a). \nLegal theory, like philosophy, has had its share of skeptics about\ncausation. Most of such legally located skepticism has been directed\nat the proximate cause half of the conventional two-part definition of\ncausation in the law. As we shall see shortly, such skepticism there\nconsiders “proximate cause” a misnomer and\nreinterprets the proximate cause requirement in noncausal, policy\nterms. More radical is the skepticism here considered. Some legal\ntheorists are skeptical of there being any natural relation in the\nworld named by “causation”. This skepticism includes what\nthe law names “cause in fact” as well as “proximate\ncause”. \nBefore we describe such skepticisms in legal theory, we do well to be\nsure we have a firm grasp on what skepticism about causation is. Take\nDavid Hume, often listed as a skeptic about causation. Hume famously\nidentified singular causal relations as spatiotemporally located\ninstances of causal laws, and he identified causal laws as no more\nthan uniformity in sequence between types of events. Hume was thus\ndoubly a reductionist about the causal relation, reducing it\nultimately to regular concurrence. In this, he is commonly said to be\na skeptic. \nBecause Hume’s analysis takes “the glue” out of the\ncausal relation—a cause doesn’t make its effect\noccur, it is only regularly followed by its effect—it is\ncommonly classified as skeptical. And in a sense it is, if one treats\nthe making-things-happen “glue” to be essential to any\nrelation properly called “causal”. But Hume’s views\nare not radical enough to count as skeptical in the sense intended by\nlegal theoreticians. For Hume gives what Saul Kripke calls a\n“skeptical solution” to the problem of causation (1982:\n66–68): Hume doesn’t deny that causation exists, but he\nreduces it to something less ontologically queer than\n“glue”. \nA better model of the radical skepticism here considered is the\n“ascriptivist” views that Herbert Hart once held (but\nlater repudiated). In a famous analysis of our usage of the causative\nverbs of action such as “A hit B”, Hart\nurged that we describe no natural relations (such as that\nA caused there to be contact on B’s body), but\nrather we ascribe responsibility to A for the contact\non B’s body. (Hart 1949) If this bit of pre-Austin speech act\nanalysis were true, then causatives (and analogously, more explicit\nwords of causation) would only be the labels used to express\nconclusions about responsibility. Such words would not name real\nrelations that could be the justifying grounds for attributing\nresponsibility to someone. \nSuch are the conclusions of the legal skeptics here considered. Such\nskeptics appear to deny that causation exists as any kind of natural\nrelation, be it a “glue-like” natural relation, regular\nconcurrence in nature, or something else. Because it is easiest to\napproach such skepticism historically, I shall begin with the badly\nnamed American Legal Realists (badly named because in no sense were\nthey realists in the philosophical sense), with whom almost all of the\nskepticisms about proximate causation also originated. \nMost of Henry Edgerton’s much-cited work details his skepticism\nabout proximate causation. Some of it, however, reveals him to have\nbeen a skeptic about the cause-in-fact requirement as well. He notes,\nfor example, that the symmetrically concurrent overdetermination cases\nwere divided into two camps by the cause-in-fact doctrines of his day:\nwhere there were two culpable actors starting fires (where\nthe fires joined to produce a larger fire burning down the\nplaintiff’s house), either actor was a cause of the destruction;\nbut when only one of the fires was of culpable origin, the other being\neither natural or of innocent human origin, then the culpable\nactor was not a cause of the destruction. From such examples, Edgerton\nsuggested that the cause-in-fact requirement was (like the proximate\ncause requirement) all a matter of policy, a matter, that is,\ndepending on “our free and independent sense of justice\nand—perhaps—the interests of society”. \nA late blooming of this Legal Realist conclusion was the well-known\nwork of Wex Malone (1956). Malone largely focused on an issue that\npreoccupied philosophers of causation in the 1950s: the pragmatic\nfeatures by which we pick out “the cause” of some\nevent (Feinberg 1970: 143–147). Malone found, unsurprisingly, only\ncontext-specific, practical interests guiding such locutions of causal\nemphasis, and skeptically concluded that that was all there was to\ncausation itself. To be said to be “the cause” of some\nharm was just another way of saying one was responsible for the\nharm. \nThe skepticism of American Legal Realism has had two intellectual\ndescendants in legal theory. One of these consists of the self-styled\n“critical” theorists—the Critical Legal Studies\nmovement (or “Crits”) whose heyday was in the 1970s and\n1980s in America. Much of this movement’s skepticism is simply\nwarmed-over postmodernism, itself a passing fashion in many\ndisciplines besides law (Moore 1989). More interesting intellectually\nwere criticisms that were not based on postmodernist platitudes but\nwere specific to causation. \nMark Kelman’s skepticism was of this latter kind. Kelman urged\nthat all causal requirements in the law were part of the\n“liberal myth” of objective criteria for liability, but\nrather than reciting (yet again) the platitude of the historically\nsituated knower, Kelman actually directed arguments against the\nlaw’s cause-in-fact tests, arguments denying that such tests\nmirrored anything in natural fact. Kelman accurately perceived that\nthe NESS variation of the counterfactual theory was an ineffectual\nversion of it, and he produced some of the criticisms of that\nvariation that others who are not causal skeptics have also pursued.\nFrom the perceived failure of this one variation of the counterfactual\ntheory of cause in fact, Kelman concluded that cause in fact itself\ncannot be a matter of fact (Kelman 1987). \nThe general, positive prescription that is supposed to flow from the\nskepticisms of the Legal Realists and the Crits is not so clear. One\ngathers that once skepticism (about causation being a matter of\nobjective fact) has removed the blinders, we can see that it is only\ninterests and policies that lead us to conclusions about moral\nresponsibility and legal liability. Presumably, then, the positive\nprescription is for us to do this openly, balancing all relevant\nconsiderations of policy in deciding who should be liable and then\ncasting those liability conclusions in terms of what was the cause of\nwhat. \nThe other intellectual descendant of the American Legal Realists on\ncausation is the law and economics movement in contemporary legal\ntheory. These theorists are seeking to show that legal rules and\ninstitutions either are or should be efficient, in the\npost-Pareto sense of that word distinctive of modern welfare\neconomics. \nLike the Crits, legal economists tend to be radical skeptics about\ncausation. The leading early papers on causation all express\nskepticism about “causation” picking out any real relation\nin the world. On this skeptical view, lawyers are just doing intuitive\neconomics or some other policy balancing in their use of causal\nidioms, because that is all they can be doing. Shavell\n(1980), and Landes and Posner (1983) explicitly rely on Edgerton,\npicking up precisely where Edgerton began his skepticism, in the\nliability rules for symmetrically concurrent overdetermination\ncases. \nLike other skeptics about causation, the legal economists do not rest\ncontent in their demythologizing of the metaphysics of causation. Such\neconomists also have a more positive account of what should be made of\nthe law’s causation-drenched requirements for liability. The\npositive, reconstructive prescriptions of the law and economics\ntheorists differ from those of the Crits and the Legal Realists in\nthat the policy favored is much more specific: liability (including\nthe supposedly causal requirements for liability) should give\nincentives for efficient behavior. Yet unnoticed by the economists was\nthat this monistic policy focus on efficiency made their causal\nskepticism unnecessary and beside the point in their recommendations\nabout what “cause” should mean in law. \nThis is because if efficiency is the normative polestar for both tort\nand criminal law, then there is a basis for denying the relevance of\nthe metaphysics of causation to the interpretation of legal usages of\n“cause” that does not depend on any skepticism about that\nmetaphysics. Such a basis begins with the quite correct insight that\nlegal texts are to be interpreted in light of the purposes (values,\nfunctions, “spirit, “mischief”, etc.) such texts\nserve. Often such purposes will justify an interpreter in holding the\nlegal meaning of a term to be quite different from its ordinary\nmeaning in non-legal English. Whether this is so in the case of the\nlegal uses of “cause” depends on what one takes to be the\npurpose of those legal texts that use “cause”. Consider\nAmerican tort law.. Following the welfare economics of A. C. Pigou\n(1920), it was for a time fashionable to think that the purpose of\nliability rules in tort law was to force each enterprise or activity\nwithin an economy to pay its “true costs”. Those costs\nincluded damage caused to others by the activity as much as they\nincluded traditional cost items of production like labor, raw\nmaterials, and capital. The thought was that only if each enterprise\npaid its true costs would the goods or services produced by that\nenterprise be correctly priced, and only if such correct pricing\noccurred would markets achieve an efficient allocation of resources.\nThis came to be known as “enterprise liability” in the\ntort law theory of 1950s America (Calabresi 1961). \nIf the point of tort law were to achieve an efficient allocation of\nresources, and if such efficiency could be achieved only by\ndiscovering the “true costs” of each activity when such\ncosts are defined in terms of that activity’s harmful effects,\nthen “cause” as used in tort liability rules should mean\nwhatever the metaphysics of causation tells us the word means. For on\nthis theory it is the harmful effects that an activity really causes\nthat are the true costs for that activity; and this rationale thus\ndemands a robust use of some metaphysical view about causation. \nThis Pigouvian view of tort law has given way to the post-1960 view of\nRonald Coase: tort law indeed exists in order to achieve an efficient\nallocation of resources, yet such efficiency will be achieved whether\ntort liability tracks causal responsibility or not. Coase’s\nessential insight was that to economically rational actors opportunity\ncosts are real costs too, so that a forgone opportunity to accept a\npayment in lieu of causing another person some harm already forces the\nharm-causer to “internalize” all costs of his activities.\nSuch a harm-causer need not be liable for such harms in order to have\nhim pay for the “true costs” of his activity; he already\n“pays” by forgoing the opportunity to be bought off by the\nsufferer of the harm. As each harm-causer and harm-sufferer decides on\nthe desired level of his activity, he will thus take into account all\neffects of his interaction without a cause-based tort liability\nforcing him to do so (Coase 1960). \nOn this Coasean analysis of tort law, there is simply no need for\nliability to turn on causation. Rather, either tort liability is\nirrelevant to efficient resource allocation (in a world of low\ntransaction costs), or tort liability should be placed on the cheapest\ncost-avoider (in a world where transaction costs are high) in order to\ninduce that person to take the cost-effective precautions. In either\ncase, legal liability should not track causal responsibility, for even\nwhen there are high transaction costs the causer of a harm need not be\nthe cheapest cost-avoider for that kind of harm. \nThe irrelevance of causation to the giving of efficient incentives has\nleft economists struggling to make sense of the cause-in-fact\nrequirement of criminal law and tort liability rules. Since no\nmetaphysical reading of “cause” is appropriate to the goal\nof efficiency, some policy calculus is given as the legal meaning of\n“cause”. Such policy calculus typically generates a\nprobabilistic interpretation of “cause”, so that any\nactivity that raises the conditional probability of some harm that has\noccurred is said to have “caused” that harm (Calabresi\n1975). For any theory seeking to use the law to give incentives to\nefficient behavior in a world of high transaction costs, this\nprobabilistic interpretation is seemingly just what is required. To\ncriticize such probabilistic interpretation of legal cause on the\nground that probability is a poor metaphysical account of what\ncausation is (Wright 1985a, 1987), would thus be beside the\npoint—so long as one adheres to the economists’\nutilitarian views about the proper function of the concept of\ncausation in the law. \nIt was useful in taxonomizing the seven variations of the\ncounterfactual test to show how such variations were produced in\nresponse to problems perceived to exist for the first variation, which\nwas the simple, unmodified counterfactual test. While there is no test\nof proximate causation that is comparably dominant in law (even if\nonly in lip service) to the counterfactual test of cause-in-fact, it\nis nonetheless useful to display the various proximate cause tests as\nthey react to problems in other tests of proximate causation. Some\ndiscussion of standard problems with each version of the tests within\nlegal theory is thus included as we describe what motivates others of\nthe tests.  \nThe basic taxonomizing principle here is to separate tests that do not\nview proximate causation as having anything to do with real causal\nrelations (the conventional view within legal theory) from tests that\nare motivated by the contrary thought. We shall begin with the former\nkind of test, what should be called policy-based proximate cause\ntests. Policy-based proximate cause tests are themselves usefully\ndivided into two camps. Some—general policy tests—are\njustified by their service of a wide range of policies, indeed, as\nwide as are the policies that justify liability at all in torts or\ncriminal law. By contrast, other tests are in the service of only one\npolicy: the measurement of the culpability of the actor in terms of\nthe mental state she had or should have had as she acted. \nBeginning with the general policy-based proximate cause tests: the\nfirst of these are what we may call “ad hoc policy\ntests”. The idea is that courts balance a range of policies in\neach case that they adjudicate where a defendant has been found to\nhave caused-in-fact a legally prohibited harm. They may balance\ncertain “social interests”, like the need for deterrence,\nwith certain “individual interests”, like the unfairness\nof surprising a defendant with liability (Edgerton 1924). Courts then\ndecide wherever such balance leads. Whatever decision is reached on\nsuch case-by-case policy balancing is then cast in terms of\n“proximate” or “legal” cause. Such labels are\nsimply the conclusions of policy balances; the labels have nothing to\ndo with causation in any ordinary or scientific sense (Green\n1929). \nThe second sort of test here is one that adopts general rules of legal\ncausation. Such rules are adopted for various policy reasons also\nhaving nothing to do with causation, but such rules differ from the\nad hoc test by their eschewal of case-by-case balancing;\nrather, it is the per se rules of legal causation that are\nadopted for policy reasons. Thus, at common-law the rule for homicide\nwas that death must occur within a year and a day of the\ndefendant’s harmful action, else he could not be said to have\nlegally caused the death. Analogously, the last wrongdoer rule of both\ntorts and criminal law held that when a single victim is mortally\nwounded by two or more assailants, acting seriatim over time and not\nin concert, only the last wrongdoer could be said to be the legal\ncause of the death. As a third example, tort law for a time observed\nwhat was called a “first house rule”, according to which a\nrailroad whose negligently emitted sparks burned an entire town was\nonly liable for the house or houses directly ignited by its sparks,\nnot for other houses ignited by the burning of those first burnt\nhouses (Ryan v. New York Central RR). There is no pretense of\nmaking truly causal discriminations by such rules; rather, such rules\nwere adopted for explicit reasons of legal policy. The first house\nrule, for example, was said to be justified by the policy of\nsubsidizing the then developing railroad industry by protecting it\nfrom a liability that was thought to be potentially ruinous in its\nextent. \nThe main problem with both ad hoc and rule-based policy tests\ndoes not lie with their “functionalist” approach (Cohen\n1935; 1937). to legal concepts such as causation, for we should always\nask after the purpose of the rule or institution in which a concept\nfigures in order to ascertain its legal meaning. Yet for anyone who\nthinks that criminal law and torts have dominant, justice-oriented\npurposes, the open-endedness of these policy tests will be\ndisqualifying. If retributive justice is the value served by criminal\nlaw, and if such justice requires that we grade punishment\nproportionately to causation, then criminal law’s proximate\ncause tests should aid in finding when offenders really cause a harm.\nAnalogously, a tort law that uses causation to mark out those owing\nduties of corrective justice will limit those owing such duties of\ncompensation to those who have really caused the harms for which\ncompensation is sought. On such a view of tort law, proximate\ncausation should aid in separating those who really have caused a harm\nfrom those who have not. To serve both retributive and corrective\njustice, thus, the last thing one wants to do is to define legal\ncausation so that the label names a balance of values rather than the\nfactual state of affairs (real causation) that determines moral\nblameworthiness. The Legal Realists’ explicit policy tests are\nanathema to any justice-oriented scheme of punishment or of\ncompensation. \nThis problem does not so obviously infect the next two policy-based\nproximate cause tests, the foreseeability and the harm-within-the-risk\ntests. For those tests do seek to describe a factual state of affairs\nthat plausibly determines both moral blameworthiness and connects a\ndefendant’s culpability to particular harms. These tests are\nthus serving the kinds of policies that must be served by the concept\nof causation in justice-oriented theories of criminal law and of\ntorts. Their novelty lies in their relocation of how and where legal\ncausation determines fault. On these theories, “legal\ncause” is not a refinement of an admitted desert-determiner,\ntrue causation; it is rather a refinement of another admitted\ndesert-determiner, culpable state of mind. \nConsider first the well-known foreseeability test. Unlike the case\nwith the rule-based policy tests, here there is no multiplicity of\nrules for specific situations (like long drawn out processes of death,\nintervening wrongdoers, railroad fires, etc.). Rather, there is one\nrule universally applicable to all criminal and tort cases: was it\nforeseeable to a defendant at the time that she acted that her act\nwould cause the harm that it in fact caused? (Green 1967). This\npurportedly universal test for legal causation is usually justified by\none of two policies: either the unfairness of punishing (or extracting\ncompensation from) someone for harms that they could not foresee, or\nthe inability to gain any deterrence by sanctioning such actors (since\nthe threat value of tort or criminal law sanctions is commonly thought\nto be nonexistent for unforeseeable violations of liability\nrules). \nSome jurisdictions restrict the foreseeability test to one kind of\nsituation. When some human action or natural event intervenes between\nthe defendant’s action and the harm, the restricted test asks\nnot whether the ultimate harm to the victim was foreseeable but\nrather, whether that intervening action or event was foreseeable to\nthe defendant when he acted. This restricted foreseeability test is\nlike the restricted rules we saw before and is unlike the universal\ntest of legal causation the foreseeability test usually purports to\nbe. \nPrecisely because it is a culpability test, the foreseeability test\nbecomes subject to its own policy-based objection. The objection is\nthat of redundancy. Why should we ask two culpability\nquestions in determining blameworthiness? After we have satisfied\nourselves that a defendant is culpable—either because she\nintended or foresaw some harm, or because she was unreasonable in not\nforeseeing some harm, the foreseeability test bids us to ask\n“Was the harm foreseeable?” This is redundant, because any\nharm intended or foreseen is foreseeable, and any harm foreseeable\nenough to render an actor unreasonable for not foreseeing it, is also\nforeseeable. \nThe only way the foreseeability test avoids redundancy is by moving\ntoward the other alternative here, the harm-within-the-risk test. That\nis, the law could have said that in situations where the defendant was\nculpable in intending, foreseeing, or unreasonably risking some harm\ntype H, but what his act in fact caused was an instance of harm\ntype J, one should ask whether J was foreseeable, a\ndifferent question than the one asked and answered as a matter of\nmens rea (which was about H). Of course, H must\nbe “close” to J for there to be a mind guilty with\nrespect to the harm for which responsibility is sought. Yet this is to\ndo the work of the harm-within-the-risk test, which is to solve what\nshould be called the “fit problem” of mens rea\n(fitting the harm actually done, J, to the harm foreseen,\nintended, or risked, H; Moore 2011a). Moreover, it is to do such work badly.\nForeseeability is not the right question to ask in order to fit the\nharm in fact caused by a defendant to the type of harm with respect to\nwhich she was culpable (either because she intended to achieve, or\nforesaw that she would cause, or unreasonably risked achieving, such a\nharm). If to avoid redundancy the foreseeability test is to be\nrestricted to this non-redundant work, it is better abandoned for the\nharm-within-the-risk test. \nLet us examine, then, this fourth policy-based proximate cause test,\nthe misleadingly labeled “harm-within-the-risk” test. Like\nthe foreseeability test, this test purports to be a test of legal\ncause that is universally applicable to all tort and criminal cases.\nThis test, too, is justified on policy grounds and does not pretend to\nhave anything to do with factual or scientific causation. Doctrinally,\nhowever, the test differs from a simple foreseeability test. \nConsider first the arena from which the test takes its name, which is\nfrom crimes or torts of risk creation. If the defendant is\ncriminally charged with negligent homicide (or wrongful death in\ntorts), for example, this test requires that the death of the victim\nbe within the risk that made the actor’s action negligent. If it\nwas negligent to drop a can of nitroglycerin because it might explode\nand kill the victim, but instead it kills him by cutting his toe and\ncausing him to bleed to death, then the harm that happened (bleeding)\nwas not within the risk of harm (explosion) that made it negligent to\ndrop the can (American Law Institute 1934). Similarly, if the charge\nis manslaughter (for which consciousness of the risk is required in\nsome jurisdictions), this test requires that the death of the victim\nbe within the risk the awareness of which made the defendant’s\naction reckless. \nExtension of this test to non-risk-creation crimes or torts requires\nsome modification. For crimes or torts of strict liability, where no\nmens rea is required, the test requires that the harm that\nhappened be one of the types of harms the risk of which motivated the\nlawmaker to prohibit the behavior. For torts or crimes requiring\nknowledge (or “general intention”) for their mens\nrea, the test asks whether the harm that happened was an instance\nof the type of harm the foresight of which by the defendant made her\nculpable. For torts or crimes requiring purpose (or “specific\nintent’) for their mens rea, the test asks whether the\nharm that happened was an instance of the type of harm intended by the\ndefendant which intention made him culpable. \nWhat motivates all of these variations of the harm-within-the-risk\ntest is the following insight: when assessing culpable mens\nrea, there is always a “fit problem”. Suppose a defendant\nintends to hit his victim in the face with a stick; suppose further he\nintends the hit to put out the victim’s left eye. As it happens,\nthe victim turns suddenly as she is being hit, and loses her right ear\nto the blow. Whether the harm that happened (right ear loss) is an\ninstance of the type of harm intended (left eye loss) is what is\ncalled the fit problem. Fact finders have to fit the mental state the\ndefendant had to the actual result he achieved and ask whether it is\nclose enough for him to be punished for a crime of intent like mayhem.\n(If it is not close enough, then he may yet be found guilty of some\nlesser tort or crime of battery or reckless endangerment.) \nThe essential claim behind the harm-within-the-risk test is that\n“legal cause” is the label lawyers should put on a problem\nof culpability, the problem called the fit problem. Proponents of this\ntest urge that legal cause, properly understood, is really a mens\nrea doctrine, not a doctrine of causation at all (American Law\nInstitute 1985). \nThe main problem for the harm-within-the-risk test does not lie in any\nof the directions we have just explored with respect to foreseeability\nas a test. The harm-within-the-risk test is in the service of a\njustice-oriented policy in its seeking of a true desert-determiner\n(culpable mental state), and it does not ask a redundant question. To\ngrade culpability by the mental states of intention, foresight, and\nrisk, we do have to match the harm done to the type of harm intended,\nforeseen, or unreasonably risked. The real questions for the\nharm-within-the-risk test are why this culpability question is\nlabelled as a problem of legal causation, and whether this\ngrading by culpable mental states is all that is or should be going on\nunder the rubric of “legal cause”. \nConsider this last question in light of two well-known sorts of legal\ncause cases. It is a time-honored maxim of criminal and tort law that\n“you take your victim as you find him”. Standard\ntranslation: no matter how abnormal may be the victim’s\nsusceptibilities to injury, and no matter how unforeseeable such\ninjuries may therefore be, a defendant is held to legally cause such\ninjuries. Hit the proverbial thin-skulled man, and you have legally\ncaused his death if he dies, no matter how rare his condition might\nbe. This is hard to square with the harm-within-the-risk test. A\ndefendant who intends to hit or to cut does not necessarily (or even\nusually) intend to kill. A defendant who foresees that his acts will\ncause the victim to be struck or cut, does not necessarily (or even\nusually) foresee that the victim will die. A defendant who negligently\nrisks that his acts will cause a victim to be struck or cut is not\nnecessarily (or even usually) negligent because he risked death. \nThe second sort of case involves what are often called\n“intervening” or “superseding” causes. Suppose\nthe defendant sets explosives next to a prison wall intending to blow\nthe wall and to get certain inmates out. He foresees to a practical\ncertainty that the explosion will kill the guard on the other side of\nthe wall. He lights the fuse to the bomb and leaves. As it happens,\nthe fuse goes out. However, a stranger passes by the wall, sees the\nbomb, and relights the fuse for the pleasure of seeing an explosion;\nor, alternatively, lightning hits the fuse, reigniting it and setting\noff the bomb. When the guard on the other side of the wall is killed\nby the blast, standard doctrines of intervening causation hold that\nthe defendant did not legally cause the death of the guard. Yet this\nis hard to square with the result that seemingly should obtain under\nthe harm-within-the-risk test. After all, did not the defendant\nforesee just the type of harm an instance of which did occur? Because\nthe harm-within-the-risk question asks a simple type-to-token\nquestion—was the particular harm that happened an instance of\nthe type of harm whose foresight by the defendant made him\nculpable—the test is blind to freakishness of causal route\n(Moore 2009a: ch. 10). \nThe American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code modifies its\nadoption of the harm-within-the-risk test in section 2.03 by denying\nliability for a harm within the risk that is “too remote or\naccidental in its occurrence to have a [just] bearing on the\nactor’s liability or on the gravity of his offense”\n(American Law Institute 1962). This language was not intended as a\ngeneral, stand-alone test of proximate causation, as it is sometimes\nconstrued to be (Dan-Cohen 1983). Rather, the language gives a\nqualifying caveat to the more general harm within the risk test of the\nModel Penal Code. Such a caveat is an explicit recognition of the\ninability of the harm-within-the-risk test to accommodate the issues\ncommonly adjudicated as intervening cause issues. \nSuch a recognition is not nearly broad enough to cover the inadequacy\nof the harm-within-the-risk approach. The basic problem with the test\nis that it ignores all the issues traditionally adjudicated\nunder the concept of legal cause. The test is blind not only to\nfreakishness of causal route in the intervening cause situations,\nblind not only to the distinction between antecedent versus\nafter-arising abnormalities so crucial to resolution of the\nthin-skulled man kind of issue, but the test also ignores all those\nissues of remoteness sought to be captured by Sir Francis\nBacon’s coinage “proximate causation”. Even where\nthere is no sudden “break” in the chain of causation as in\nthe intervening cause cases, there is a strong sense that causation\npeters out over space and time. Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon\nmay well be a necessary condition for your reading of this essay, but\nso many other events have also contributed that Caesar’s causal\nresponsibility has long since petered out. The logical relationship at\nthe heart of the harm-within-the-risk test—“was the\nparticular harm that happened an instance of the type of harm whose\nrisk, foresight, or intention made the defendant\nculpable?”—is incapable of capturing this sensitivity to\nremoteness. As such, the harm-within-the-risk test is blind to the\nbasic issue adjudicated under “legal cause”. The\nharm-within-the-risk test asks a question that well serves\njustice-oriented theories of torts and criminal law, but it asks it in\nthe wrong place and in substitution of other questions needing an\nanswer for desert to be assessed. \nWe turn now from the policy-based tests of proximate causation to\nthose tests based on the view that proximate causation, like cause in\nfact, has to do with real causal relations in the world. The oldest of\nthese tests is that suggested by Sir Francis Bacon’s coinage\n“causa proxima” (1630: first maxim). The simple\nidea behind such a remoteness test is that causation is a scalar\nrelation—a more-or-less sort of thing, not an all-or-nothing\nsort of thing—and that it peters out over time. \nA criticism of the remoteness test, often voiced in the legal\nliterature, is that distance in space and remoteness in time are\nirrelevant to degrees of causal contribution. Examples like People\nv. Botkin, where poisoned candy went a great distance (from\nCalifornia to the victim in New Jersey), or an undetonated bomb left\nburied for many years before it explodes and injures a victim, are\ntrotted out in support of the criticism. Justice Cardozo rejoined that\nsuch criticism surely ran counter to strong community sentiment that\nspatiotemporal distance does matter to degrees of causal contribution\n(Bird v. St. Paul F. and Minneapolis Ins. Co.), but one would\nhope that one could do better than that. Spatiotemporal distance is\nperhaps a serviceable proxy for the number of events or states of\naffairs through which a cause exerts its influence on its effects, and\nthe number of events could be relevant to the degree of causal\ncontribution. This is the metaphysical view that causation\n“tires” through its links and that in this way the\nrelation is not fully a transitive one. \nA second and quite distinct kind of cause-based proximate cause test\nis the “direct cause” test. Despite the name, this test\ndoes not require that there be a complete absence of any\nevent or state of affairs intervening between a cause and its effect,\nfor that cause to be “direct”. Not even the ancient\ndirect/indirect distinction between the writs of trespass and\ntrespass-on-the-case in torts was this stringent in its requirement of\ndirectness (for trespass; Scott v. Shepard). On the contrary,\nchains can be sufficiently direct for the direct cause test\neven though they are quite long chains extending over considerable\nspace and time. It is only if a special kind of event—an\n“intervening” (aka “superseding”,\n“extraneous”) cause—intervenes that the chain is\ninsufficiently direct. The heart of the direct cause test is thus the\nidea that there are these chain-breaking, intervening causes. \nBeginning with a series of articles in the 1950s and culminating in\ntheir massive book of 1959, Causation in the Law, second\nedition 1985, Herbert Hart and Tony Honoré sought to describe\nthe idea of intervening causation that they saw the law adopting from\neveryday causal idioms. One can see their concept most easily in three\nsteps. First, presuppose some version of the counterfactual analysis:\na cause is at least a necessary condition for its effect, or perhaps a\nNESS condition (Honoré 1997). Second, a cause is not just\nany necessary condition; rather, out of the plethora of\nconditions necessary for the happening of any event, only two sorts\nare eligible to be causes rather than mere “background\nconditions:” free, informed, voluntary human actions, and those\nabnormal conjunctions of natural events we colloquially refer to as\n“coincidences”. Third, such voluntary human action and\nabnormal natural events cause a given effect only if some other\nvoluntary human action or abnormal natural event does not intervene\nbetween the first such event and its putative effect. Such salient\nevents, in other words, are breakers of causal chains\n(“intervening causes”) as much as they are initiators of\ncausal chains, so if they do intervene they relegate all earlier such\nevents to the status of mere background conditions. \nHart and Honoré built on considerable case-law support for\ntheir two candidates for intervening causes (Carpenter 1932,\n1940–43; Eldredge 1937). Indeed, it is arguable that the basic\ndistinction between principal and accomplice liability in criminal law\ndepends in large part on this conceptualization of causation (Kadish\n1985), as does the tort law distinction between “in\nconcert” and “concurrent causer” kinds of joint\ntort-feasors. One worry for this view of causation, nonetheless, is\nthat it is incomplete with respect to the remoteness range of issues\nusually dealt with under the rubric of “legal cause” in\nthe law. Causation in the law fades out gradually as much it breaks\noff suddenly, and the direct cause analysis ignores this. \nThe problems with the conventional legal analysis of\ncausation—in terms of a bifurcation into cause in fact and\nproximate causation—have tempted some legal theorists to abandon\nthe bifurcation of causation in the law and to search for a unitary\nnotion of causation that is much more discriminating (in what it\nallows as a cause) than the hopelessly promiscuous counterfactual\ncause-in-fact test of the conventional analysis. Indeed, the search is\nfor a unitary concept of causation that is so discriminating that it\ncan do the work that on the conventional analysis is done by both\ncause-in-fact and proximate cause doctrines. It is far from obvious\nthat causation is in fact a sufficiently discriminating relation that\nit can do this much work in assigning responsibility. Nonetheless,\nthere are three such proposals in the legal literature, each having\nsome doctrinal support in the law. \nOne we have seen already in the fourth variation in the counterfactual\ntest for cause in fact. If one does not ask whether the\ndefendant’s act was necessary for the occurrence of the\nharm—if one instead and more discriminatingly asks whether that\naspect of her act that made her negligent or otherwise\nculpable caused the harm—then one has a causal test almost as\ndiscriminating as the simple counterfactual test coupled with a\nharm-within-the-risk version of the proximate cause test (Keeton 1963;\nWright 1985b). This is not surprising, because both tests rule\nineligible any aspects of the defendant’s act that does\nnot make her culpable. For the aspect-causation view, such\nculpability-irrelevant aspects of the defendant’s action are not\n(relevantly) the cause of the harm; for the harm-within-the-risk test,\nsuch culpability-irrelevant aspects of the defendant’s action do\nnot fit the culpable mental states of the defendant. Whether one puts\nit as causation (the aspect-cause view), or as culpability (the\nharm-within-the-risk view), the discriminating power is roughly the\nsame. \nA second unified view of causation in the law is the oldest of these\nkinds of proposals. It conceives of causation as a metaphysical\nprimitive. Causation is not reducible to any other sort of thing or\nthings, so there is little by way of an analysis that one can\nsay about it and so very little that juries should be told about it\n(Smith 1911). The one thing we can say is that the causal relation is\na scalar relation, which is to say, a matter of degree. One thing can\nbe more of a cause of a certain event than another thing.\nGiven the scalarity of causation, all the law need do is draw the line\nfor liability somewhere on the scale marking degrees of causal\ncontribution. On matters that vary on a smooth continuum, it is\nnotoriously arbitrary to pick a precise break-point; where is the line\nbetween middle age and old age, red and pink, bald and not-bald, or\ncaused and not-caused? This approach thus picks an\nappropriately vague line below which one’s causal\ncontribution to a given harm will be ignored for purposes of assessing\nresponsibility. Let the defendant be responsible and liable for some\nharm only when the degree of his causal contribution to that harm has\nreached some non de minimus, or “substantial”,\nmagnitude. This is the original “substantial factor” test,\nas articulated by Jeremiah Smith in 1911. To the common objection that\nthe test tells us little, its defenders reply that that is a virtue,\nnot a vice, for there is little to be said about causation. Like\nhard-core pornography, causation is something we can “know when\nwe see it” (Potter Stewart’s language about pornography in\nJacobellis v. Ohio), without need of general definitions and\ntests (Borgo 1979). \nThe third and last of these unified notions of causation is\nphysicalist in its ambitions. Some theorists have thought that we can\nsay more about the nature of the causal relation than that it is\nscalar and that a substantial amount of it is required for\nresponsibility. On this third view, the nature of causation is to be\nfound in the mechanistic concepts of physics: matter in motion,\nenergy, force (Beale 1895, 1920; Epstein 1973). This test is similar\nto the substantial factor view in its conceiving the causal relation\nto be scalar but differs in its reductionist ambitions: causation is\nnot a primitive but can be reduced to some kind of physical\nprocess. \nThis view handles easily the overdetermination cases that are such a\nproblem for the conventional analysis. When two fires join, two\nbullets strike simultaneously, two motorcycles scare the same horse,\neach is a cause of the harm because each is doing its physical work.\nWhen one non-mortal wound is inflicted together with a larger, mortal\nwound and the victim dies of loss of blood, each is a cause of death\nbecause each did some of the physical work (loss of blood) leading to\ndeath (People v. Lewis). \nSuch a mechanistic conception of causation is mostly a suggestion in\nthe legal literature because of the elusive and seemingly mysterious\nuse of “energy” and “force” by legal theorists\n(Hart & Honoré 1959). One suspects that some such view is\noften applied by jurors, but unless theorists can spell out the\ngeneral nature of the relation being intuitively applied by jurors,\nthis test tends to collapse to the metaphysically sparer (because\nprimitivist) substantial factor test. \nAs we have seen, the Anglo-American law of torts and of crimes has a\nbafflingly large number of conceptions of legal causation. Displayed\nbelow is a review of what has been described above, organized by the\nvariables discussed earlier. \nAlthough it is possible to hold the view that causation in the law\nshares nothing with causation in science and in everyday life (save\nuse of the same word), such a view is very counterintuitive; some\nrelation between the two concepts of causation surely exists. That\nleaves two more plausible views of this relation. A strong view of\nthis relation would be that the concepts are the same. The three\nunified tests for legal causation last considered, and the two\nmetaphysical views of proximate causation earlier mentioned, all would\nmake such a strong relation plausible. A weaker view of this relation\nwould be to regard part of the law’s concept of\ncausation—“cause-in-fact”—to be the same as\ncausation in science and everyday life, but to regard the other\npart—“proximate causation”—to be the\nconclusions of policy analyses having nothing to do with anything that\ncould be thought of as causation in any ordinary sense. \nTo decide which version of this relation is the correct one, one has\nto adjudicate between the various competing conceptions of causation\nin the law that we have examined. To have a baseline of comparison,\none must also resolve the many conundrums surrounding the search for\nthe true metaphysics of causation in philosophy; among other things,\nthis involves hiving off all the features of ordinary usage of\n“cause” that are merely pragmatic features of appropriate\nutterance rather than semantic features fixing the reference of the\nterm. These are daunting tasks to be done on both sides of the\nequation. To complete them, truly the lawyer must “adventure\nhimself with philosophers in the logical and metaphysical controversies that beset the idea of cause”\n(Pollack 1901: 36). For philosophical lawyers and legal philosophers,\nthat will not be a cost but a benefit.","contact.mail":"micmoore@illinois.edu","contact.domain":"illinois.edu"}]
